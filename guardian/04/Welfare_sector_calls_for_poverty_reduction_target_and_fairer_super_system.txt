The Australian Council of Social Service has written to major political 
parties asking for election commitments to compare their approach to poverty, 
including calling for a national poverty reduction target.

Acoss has sought commitments for a range of measures including increasing 
Newstart payments, addressing housing affordability, closing tax loopholes and 
ensuring budget repair does not disproportionally impact on the lowest 40% of 
earners.

The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said: “Economic growth needs to 
be inclusive and to lift the living standards of people who have the least. To 
achieve this, active policies are needed.

“Despite over two decades of economic growth, and Australia being one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world, at least 2.6 million people and 600,000 
children are still living below the poverty line,” Goldie said.

“Inequality in Australia is on the rise. Forty percent of households in 
Australia earn just $68,000 or less and their share of overall incomes is 
declining.”

According to Acoss wealth has become more concentrated, with the richest 20% 
of Australians increasing their wealth by 28% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/21/australian-inequality-rising-as-top-20-increase-wealth-and-income-report>
 between 2004 and 2012, compared with just 3% for the lowest 20%.

“Governments control many of the levers than drive poverty and inequality and 
can reduce both through well-designed reforms,” Goldie said.

In the letters Acoss asked if parties were “committed to improving the 
fairness of superannuation and ensuring that the associated tax concessions are 
fit for purpose”.

“What action does your party propose to take to reduce the disproportionate 
share of tax concessions going to individuals with high incomes?

“What action does your party propose to take to curb the use of superannuation 
tax concessions, especially in the retirement phase, to avoid personal income 
tax, including capital gains tax and the tax payable on transfers of remaining 
superannuation balances to adult children?”

Acoss proposed extending superannuation tax concessions for contributions to 
low-income earners who pay tax at less than 15% on their wages.

Measures that could address housing affordability suggested by Acoss included 
increasing the supply of affordable rental housing through direct investment 
and investment incentives, and increasing rent assistance payments.

It also asked for parties’ commitment to “reduce the anomalies in the tax 
treatment of capital gains and other investment income, especially where 
investments are financed by debt (negative gearing arrangements)”.

To tackle unemployment, Acoss asked for a commitment to “meaningful and 
effective programs, especially paid work experience in regular jobs together 
with relevant training, for people unemployed long-term”.

It asked: “What protections does your party propose to ensure that unemployed 
people participating in these programs are not exploited and existing employees 
are not displaced?”

Acoss has welcomed the government’s shift from Work for the Dole towards work

 being at least equal to the minimum wage and other protections on work health 
and safety and against job replacement.

Acoss was critical of elements of the 2016 budget

, and modest tax cuts for people earning more than $80,000.

Commenting on Acoss’s suggestion of a poverty reduction target on Thursday, 
the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said “the best way to improve 
opportunity for everyone to get ahead, the best way to reduce poverty across 
Australia is to increase economic growth … to strengthen job creation”.

“That is precisely why we are implementing our plan for jobs and growth, and 
why in the budget we have such a strong focus on supporting disadvantaged 
youth, in particular, when it comes to helping them find a pathway into jobs 
and over time into better jobs and giving them the best possible opportunity to 
get ahead.”

Asked about the government’s changes to tighten superannuation tax concessions 
for high-income earners, Cormann said it was “structurally unsustainable to 
have a growing proportion of income generated in Australia completely outside 
the income tax system”.

Acoss also called for measures to promote an independent civil society sector, 
such as adequately funding peak representative bodies representing marginalised 
groups and ensuring government funding is not subject to restrictions on 
advocacy.
