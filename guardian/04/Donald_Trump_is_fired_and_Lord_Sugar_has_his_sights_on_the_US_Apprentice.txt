Exciting times for America, as Alan Sugar issues a come-and-get-me plea to 
producers of the US version of The Apprentice. Followingpresidential hopeful 
Donald Trump’s comments about Mexicans

, a vacancy has suddenly arisen on the NBC show – and his lordship has 
declared: “I would like the challenge.”

Well. LiS is glad to see him come out fighting after that disparaging passage 
inRichard Desmond’s newly published autobiography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/jun/18/reading-from-book-of-desmond-and-lo-richard-created-the-beckhams>
, in which the Express owner claimed he had been first choice for the UK 
Apprentice gig, with Philip Green as second, and Sugar himself gifted with 
sloppy thirds only by dint of the two men having put in a good – if pitying – 
word for him.

Whether his boardroom booster seat will be shipped stateside remains to be 
seen, but we wish Lord Sugar luck on this belated attempt to take the United 
States. As heexplained to the Mirror last year 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/alan-sugar-moved-america-id-3183318>: 
“People said that had I moved to America in the mid-80s, I’d have gone on to 
rule the world.”
