The UK government assault on trade union rights (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/15/the-guardian-view-on-trade-union-reform-partisan-politics-and-rotten-policy>
, 16 July) is an attack on democracy itself and poses a dangerous threat to 
income equality in this country.

I recently met the Chilean labour minister, who told me that, under its own 
labour reforms, Chile will be removing striker replacement rules from the 
statute book because they were an “unfortunate legacy” of Pinochet. Why is the 
Conservative party intent on following the example of Pinochet?
