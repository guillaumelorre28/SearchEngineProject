The story follows young school teacher John Grant who becomes stranded in the 
outback mining town of Bundanyabba, or “the Yabba” – scorchingly hot, eerily 
desolate and drowning in alcohol, sex and secrets.

The cast for the Network Ten series has not been announced, but the production 
team includes producers Helen Bowden (The Slap) and Kristian Moliere (The 
Babadook), director Kriv Stenders (Red Dog, A Place To Call Home), and writer 
Stephen M Irwin (Secrets and Lies).

The network’s head of drama, Rick Maier, said it would be a privilege to 
broadcast the “provocative, morally complex and brilliantly realised” story.

“There are few Australian stories as original or compelling as Wake in 
Fright,” he said.

The news follows Foxtel’s Tuesday announcement of a six-part Picnic at Hanging 
Rock series
