High in the Sierra Madre mountains, 280 miles north of Mexico City and well 
off the usual tourist trail, is one of the biggest and least-known artistic 
monuments of the 20th century. Las Pozas (the pools) was the eccentric vision 
of the wealthy British poet Edward James. An early sponsor of Dali and 
Magritte, between 1949 and 1984, James spent millions creating a “Surrealist 
Xanadu”, with Mexican follies sculpted from concrete to ensure their longevity 
in the rainforest.

The sprawling Las Pozas involves meandering across open bridges, past bamboo 
thickets and the crashing river to explore structures with names like The House 
on Three Floors Which Will in Fact Have Five or Four or Six, The House with a 
Roof like a Whale, and The Staircase to Heaven.

Venture through a round doorway and up the Road of the Seven Deadly Sins 
guarded by mosaic snakes and giant lilies, or climb the stairs that wrap around 
the open platforms of the Bamboo Palace to glimpse a waterfall in the distance 
while being serenaded by a deafening cricket chorus. Narrow paths weave among 
moss-covered ornate arches and towers on the 80-acre site, and huge abstract 
sculptures and staircases lead nowhere, but up to the sky.

In 2007, the Fondo Xilitla foundation bought the site to conserve the 
sculptures and to protect the surrounding land and gardens. Now workers ensure 
structures, with their flower-shaped arches and towering pillars topped with 
giant leaves, aren’t reclaimed by the ever-encroaching jungle foliage. James, 
who kept a menagerie of exotic animals here and put his need to build huge 
towers down to “pure megalomania”, never completed his tropical shrine to 
surrealism but his fantasy realm remains a joy to explore.
