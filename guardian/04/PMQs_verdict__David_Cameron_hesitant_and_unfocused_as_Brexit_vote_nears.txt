Key points

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, began, as his custom, by 
asking a question outside the day’s news agenda: this week it was about the 
Leveson inquiry. He moved closer to the the heart of the action with a question 
about migrant workers, before concluding by demanding David Cameron denounce 
the 57 MPs who signed a letter opposing George Osborne’s plan for an emergency 
budget in the event of a Brexit vote. Cameron gave low-key responses to all, 
culminating in a rallying call for a vote for remain.

Verdict

A peculiar PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs>, in some respects 
more interesting than usual, and perhaps most remarkable because Cameron seemed 
uncharacteristically hesitant and unfocused. Is the pressure getting to him? It 
would be very odd if it wasn’t, although Cameron was only unfocused relative to 
his usual suave professionalism. It is not really a day for normal party 
politics and Corbyn responded to that with a series of sharp, reasonable 
questions that did him credit, but did not go in for the kill. His best line 
was the one branding the 57 Tory MPs who are opposing George Osborne as 
converts to anti-austerity. Cameron enjoyed that – perhaps because he has 
little else to smile about at the moment.

Memorable line

The best line came from Corbyn, who demanded of Cameron: 

Will the prime minister take this opportunity to condemn the opportunism of 57 
of his colleagues who have suddenly had a Damascene conversion to the 
anti-austerity cause?
