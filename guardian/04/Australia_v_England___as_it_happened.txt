11.53am GMT 

That's it from me. A ridiculous mismatch, in the end. Well, also in the middle 
and pretty much at the beginning. From England we got reckless batting, 
thoughtless running and undisciplined bowling (but for Bresnan); from Australia 
we got decent bowling, excellent fielding and brutal, decisive batting. The 
tour ends, finally, with a third Twenty20 in Sydney on Sunday, which of course 
you can follow right here, and England's flight leaves within three hours of 
that match ending. After performances like that they'll find they'll return to 
a literally and figuratively frosty reception.


11.44am GMT 

Josh Hazlewood is the man of the match. "Australia outplayed us fantastically 
today," says Stuart Broad. "The two needless run-outs hurt us in the middle, 
which cost us in terms of getting a decent score. We've not clicked in these 
two games but it's not just the batting, we didn't bowl well today. I didn't do 
that, and Jade didn't do that."

"It was another great performance with the ball, which really set the game 
up," says George Bailey. "We thought starting with Hodge would just be a bit of 
a surprise for England. It's the magical juice [confidence], isn't it. We're 
seeing that from guys who are coming in for their first game, and that for me 
is the sign of a really good team environment."


11.35am GMT 

As the match ends and the players shake hands and stuff, a wild-eyed Dernbach 
gives White some lip. Just in case his bowling wasn't embarrassing enough …

Jade Dernbach might learn one day that there are times when it is best just to 
button it.

11.33am GMT 

Australia win the Twenty20 series!

Having won the Ashes after three Tests, and won the ODIs after three of those, 
Australia win the T20s after two.


11.32am GMT 

Australia win by eight wickets

Excellently done by Australia, aided by England's all-round awfulness. One 
more of these and it's all over.


11.31am GMT 

14.5 overs: Australia 131-2 (White 58, Bailey 60)

Three fours from Tredwell's over, Bailey hitting the last couple to overtake 
White and seal victory.


11.28am GMT 

13th over: Australia 118-2 (White 53, Bailey 52)

Bopara bowls, and Bailey completes a 24-ball half-century by guiding the ball 
backwards of point for four. And he celebrates by presenting Bopara with a 
caught-and-bowled chance that is, with depressing inevitability, put down. "I'm 
struggling to watch this," writes Mike Wood. "I know sports fans in general are 
capable of taking a lot of punishment, but this whole series is too much. This 
side are just too, too bad. I feel for Broad and Bresnan, cos they're looking 
forlorn at the state of the rest of their teammates. I want Jade Dernbach to go 
home, sit and think about himself and maybe decide that painting and decorating 
is more his bag. Seriously, watching this is like playing Brian LaraCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> when you're really really good and 
your opponent is a ten year old child."


11.24am GMT 

13th over: Australia 111-2 (White 51, Bailey 47)

Australia score three singles, one of them bringing White to his half-century, 
and then Bailey gets bored of that nonsense and belts the ball over mid on for 
six.


Updated at 11.24am GMT

11.20am GMT 

12th over: Australia 100-2 (White 48, Bailey 39)

Dernbach returns, and his first delivery is thundered back over the bowler's 
head for six by Bailey, who just plants his front foot and swings. His third is 
pulled through midwicket for four, a shot he enjoys so much he does it again a 
couple of ball later. Then the last ball is pushed through mid-off for another 
four. Another dreadful over from Dernbach, whose three so far completed have 
gone for 42.


11.15am GMT 

11th over: Australia 82-2 (White 48, Bailey 21)

After 10 overs England were 70-5, just six runs behind Australia, but three 
wickets worse off. After 11 they were 78-5. Luck is still on the Aussie side, 
Bailey swinging his bat and getting a fine top edge that sends the ball just 
out of Buttler's grasp and thence away for four.


11.10am GMT 

10th over: Australia 76-2 (White 47, Bailey 16)

Bopara gets to bowl himself, and it's a festival of singles. Five of them, 
there are, with the sixth delivery being kept off the stumps by the absolutely 
last-moment intervention of the very foot of White's bat.


11.05am GMT 

9th over: Australia 71-2 (White 44, Bailey 14)

George Bailey gets the first six of the day, rushing Tredwell and slamming the 
ball over mid-on – way over mid-on. Bopara then misfields from the last ball, 
turning it from a possible run-out to a straightforward two.


11.02am GMT 

8th over: Australia 62-2 (White 43, Bailey 6)

Bresnan continues, and he continues to be pretty disciplined and accurate, but 
Australia twice work the ball between deep square leg and fine leg for a 
couple, and a too-high bouncer brings a bonus delivery from which another two 
are scored.


10.58am GMT 

7th over: Australia 54-2 (White 41, Bailey 0)

Tredwell does some twirlin', Australia run some singles and when they try to 
increase the pace they get punished for it.


10.57am GMT 

WICKET! Maxwell c Bresnan b Tredwell 2 (Australia 53-2)

Maxwell gives the ball an extragant flick and Bresnan at deep square leg takes 
a decent catch at chest height.


10.53am GMT 

6th over: Australia 50-1 (White 39, Maxwell 1)

There's a long delay caused by distracted beach balls, and an inflatable 
whale, thrown on to seats covered by black cloth behind the bowler's arm. And 
it's another excellent over from Bresnan, whose two overs have gone for three 
runs, 21 fewer than Dernbach's.


10.48am GMT 

WICKET! Finch lbw b Bresnan 10 (Australia 48-1)

I thought on first viewing it looked a bit high. Sky's commentators thought it 
looked high. The umpire thought it looked good. No reviews. Out.


10.47am GMT 

5th over: Australia 48-0 (White 38, Finch 10)

The frustrating Dernbach, having changed ends, concedes three boundaries. Each 
of his two overs has gone for 12. "The suffering of Channel 9 commentary may 
continue for decades," sobs Garry Way. "Put it this way: the great thing about 
about watching Warnie bowl was not having to listen to him commentate." That's 
an international pleasure: Sky viewers also get to luxuriate in his expertise 
on a fairly regular basis.


10.42am GMT 

4th over: Australia 36-0 (White 26, Finch 10)

Just one run from Bresnan's first over, which makes it the cheapest of the day 
so far.


10.38am GMT 

3rd over: Australia 35-0 (White 25, Finch 10)

Broad puts the brakes on, with four good deliveries that bring just two 
singles, but then one is too full and powered down the ground for four, and one 
is too wide and short, and hooked through square leg for another.


10.35am GMT 

2nd over: Australia 25-0 (White 24, Finch 1)

Ten deliveries into the innings Cameron White has scored more runs than any 
English batsman managed. A drive through the covers and a pull that just evades 
a sprinting, diving square leg both earn four. Finch has so far faced just one 
ball.


10.30am GMT 

1st over: Australia 13-0 (White 13, Finch 0)

It's a good start for England, in as much as Australia don't score any runs 
off Broad's first delivery. Not a single one. Then White boshes the second 
through the covers, slides the third just wide of slip for another four and 
hoicks the fifth past square leg for a third.


10.18am GMT 

That was execrable stuff from England. Some excellent fielding did for Wright, 
well caught by Hodge, and Root, brilliantly run out by Maxwell although he was 
taking an unjustifiable risk, and some bad luck and a bouncing bat did for 
Morgan. There was a 16, three batsmen got 18 and Buttler top-scored with 22, 
but the scorecard is an exemplar of insufficiency. Stick with me to find out 
how long it takes Australia to knock off the total.


10.09am GMT 

20th over: England 130-9 (Broad 18)

Broad clobbers the ball high down the ground, just over the fielder, and it 
lands and plugs in the turf. The throw goes back to the bowler's end, where 
Broad dives in, and then to the other end, where Bresnan dives in, and just 
makes it. Both batsmen were nearly out there, one of them twice. And that sets 
the scene for an over full of diving batsmen, diving fielders and all sorts of 
harem-scarem fun. Twelve runs, in the shape of one four, two threes, and two 
ones, plus two wickets. The average first-innings score here in the Big Bash is 
145, and England are lucky to get that close to par.


"The comments by Mark Baker in the 16th over may relate to the idiots on 
channel 9 on Australian TV, who unanimously were complaining that the decision 
was incorrectm," writes Harry Randle. Mark has indeed emailed to clarify this, 
and it's true. "It took them until about over 15 to admit they were wrong, even 
then Michael Slater made a total mess of explaining it and commenting on the 
law. Whatever you say about Sky Sports commentators, listen to Channel 9 for 10 
minutes and you will never say a bad word about Sky again."

10.07am GMT 

WICKET! Tredwell b Hazlewood 0 (England 130-9)
 Hazlewood bowls full and straight, Tredwell misses, and out comes his middle 
stump. 
10.06am GMT 

WICKET! Bresnan b Hazlewood 18 (England 130-8)

Bresnan decides to paddle the wall towards fine leg, but when the ball ends up 
being quite wide, and he tries the shot anyway, he just helps it into the 
stumps. One delivery to go.


10.00am GMT 

19th over: England 118-7 (Bresnan 13, Broad 11)

Broad suffers from wildswingitis, Starc's first three deliveries sailing 
straight through to the wicketkeeper as Broad slashed away, the last missing 
the stumps by less than an inch. Things improve slightly from there, in that 
England start landing bat on ball, but they get only singles, three of them.


9.55am GMT 

18th over: England 115-7 (Bresnan 12, Broad 10)

Broad hooks the ball to within two feet of the midwicket boundary rope, and 
then clubs the next up in the air but nowhere near anyone and they run two. A 
total of 10 runs from the over – England last managed that in over No6.


9.50am GMT 

17th over: England 105-7 (Bresnan 9, Broad 3)

Starc returns, and his first ball hits Broad's thigh pad and flashes past the 
wrong-footed Wade and away for four, which represents two-thirds of the over's 
full take.


9.46am GMT 

16th over: England 99-7 (Bresnan 8, Broad 2)

Bresnan has a heave but the ball lands safe, and England just add a few 
singles. "Just to clear up the issue of the run-out, the TV commentary team are 
wrong," insists Mark Baker. "It's simple to check – just look up the October 
2010 change to law 29 re batsman out of his ground. If you assume that Morgan's 
bat was NOT grounded at the time of the bails being broken (which I think is 
the case - the shoulder of the bat just lifts up again), then the fact that he 
had previously grounded it is of no importance. The change to the law only 
protected a batsman who had made his ground from subsequently being out if he 
left his ground ONLY if his foot had been grounded at some point, not his bat. 
The law specifies that your foot must have been behind the crease. There is an 
additional provision in the run-out law, law 38, which says that you are 
protected if you leave your ground to avoid injury, but that obviously doesn't 
apply here." I'm not sure anyone is suggesting it wasn't out under the laws as 
they stand, but many are suggesting it should be out and that the laws should 
be ammended.


Updated at 9.47am GMT

9.42am GMT 

WICKET! Buttler lbw b Coulter-Nile 22 (England 96-7)

England's last proper batsman goes, plumb, to the first ball of the over.


9.41am GMT 

15th over: England 96-6 (Buttler 22, Bresnan 7)

The crowd are busy Mexican-waving as Muirhead ensured a dearth of action in 
the middle. His four overs go for 17.


9.38am GMT 

14th over: England 94-6 (Buttler 21, Bresnan 6)

A good over from Hazlewood, aided by some decent fielding. There's a wide, and 
a single, and that is very much yer lot.


9.34am GMT 

13th over: England 92-6 (Buttler 21, Bresnan 5)

Bopara survives a stumping appeal after a few replays – not that close, 
really, despite the long wait for a decision – but then gets himself out a wide 
later. This has gone almost as wrong as it could have gone for England, and now 
this pair must hang around for several overs.

mike selvey (@selvecricket) 
@JohnSunCricket <https://twitter.com/JohnSunCricket> not disagreeing. but they 
do practice precisely that situation and when push came to shove he didnt 
manage it.

9.32am GMT 

WICKET! Bopata c Maxwell b Muirhead 6 (England 87-6)

Served with wrapping paper and a lovely ribbon bow. Bopara slog-sweeps the 
ball straight to deep midwicket, where Maxwell collects, running to his right.


Updated at 9.32am GMT

9.27am GMT 

12th over: England 86-5 (Buttler 21, Bopara 6)

Coulter-Nile returns, ending Australia's go-slow, and the highlight of the 
over is Buttler cracking the ball through deep midwicket, a mighty blow. The 
Morgan run-out has provoked interesting Twitter-based discussion between our 
own Lord Michael of Selvey and the Sun's John Etheridge on whether it was 
Morgan's own fault or cricket's fault.

John Etheridge (@JohnSunCricket) 
@selvecricket <https://twitter.com/selvecricket> Irrespective of poor 
technique by Morgan, it is still a ridiculous law. Should not have been an 
issue. Not out.

9.23am GMT 

11th over: England 78-5 (Buttler 14, Bopara 5)

Mark Taylor on Sky is furious about Morgan's run-out, saying that once the bat 
has been grounded in the crease a batsman shouldn't then be run out unless he 
leaves the crease again. He's right, surely, and hopefully he'll get his chums 
at the ICC to get it fixed. Anyway, White's over, four more singles and a 
lovely improvised boundary, struck through midwicket by Buttler.

mike selvey (@selvecricket) 
Irrespective of anomalous interpretation of run out law, that was technically 
poor from Morgan. Should not have been an issue.

9.20am GMT 

10th over: England 70-5 (Buttler 8, Bopara 3)

Muirhead continues, as does England's recent diet of singles. Four of them 
there, and none in the least bit risky.


9.18am GMT 

9th over: England 66-5 (Buttler 6, Bopara 1)

Now Cameron White has a bowl, England lose another wicket and that "scary" 
batting line-up hasn't exactly frightened anyone yet.


Updated at 9.18am GMT

9.16am GMT 

WICKET! Root run out (Maxwell) 18 (England 63-5)

That was idiotic risk-taking, but brilliant fielding from Maxwell to collect 
the ball, size up his options and swing it straight to the stumps as England 
attempted a second run. If Morgan was unlucky (not unanimous), Root just made a 
bad call.

mike selvey (@selvecricket) 
Morgan not unlucky. Batsmen know if you dive in,you do so with the bat face 
down so it does not bounce. That was just poor.

9.13am GMT 

8th over: England 60-4 (Root 17, Buttler 2)

Muirhead bowls, and England get a few singles (and a wide). Hodge, with a 
brilliant catch and a run-out already in his locker, is now only a 20-ball 
half-century away from something really memorable.


9.10am GMT 

7th over: England 55-4 (Root 15, Buttler 0)

Morgan had brought up England's 50 with a first-ball reverse-sweep for four 
off Maxwell, and all looked dandy until that horrible, last-ball twist of fate. 
"Morning Simon, morning everyone," writes Guy Hornsby. Morning. "I guess the 
plan was always to get Morgan and Butler in as fast as possible, so I salute 
England's early handing over of wickets to the Aussies, it's all part of a 
grand design to score 120 off the last ten overs. That and Root going at over a 
run a ball. I'm expecting the four horsemen of the apocalypse to appear any 
moment now." Hmmm…


Updated at 9.11am GMT

9.09am GMT 

WICKET! Morgan run out (Hodge) 6 (England 55-4)

It's a big, bad blow for England. Morgan dives, Hodge throws and it's a direct 
hit. Morgan seems well in – his entire bat was over the line when the ball hit 
– but the bat had bounced and none of it was touching the ground at the time.


9.04am GMT 

6th over: England 48-3 (Root 14, Morgan 0)

Hazlewood's first delivery goes over cover's grasping hands and away for four, 
but that was to be his last contribution to England's tally. Root, though, hits 
a two and a four from the last two deliveries. There are some wicket-losing 
issues here for England.


9.01am GMT 

WICKET! Hales c Starc b Hazlewood 16 (England 42-3)

Hales tries to hit over midwicket, but the ball flies off the edge of hgis 
bat, way up in the air, and into the hands of Starc at third man.


Updated at 9.01am GMT

8.58am GMT 

5th over: England 38-0 (Hales 12, Root 8)

Starc gets the wicket, then Root's first delivery is eased through point for 
four, and his second goes through the covers for another, barely trickling over 
the boundary. His third is a wide full-toss, which he misses entirely.


Updated at 9.02am GMT

8.55am GMT 

WICKET! Wright c Hodge b Starc 0 (England 30-2)

Luke Wright, shortlisted for the Big Bash League's player-of-the-tournament 
award, is winning no prizes today. He thumps the ball towards cover, travelling 
at wild pace a foot or so off the ground, only for Hodge takes a great catch 
diving to his left.


8.53am GMT 

4th over: England 30-0 (Hales 12, Wright 0)

The first delivery after the wicket is thundered through midwicket for four by 
Hales, but however handsome that stroke was he makes up for it with the last, a 
wild swing that gets nowhere near the ball.


8.50am GMT 

WICKET! Lumb c Coulter-Nile b Hazlewood 18 (England 24-1)

Lumb hits the ball high down the ground, but not far enough, and Coulter-Nile 
sets himself and watches the ball fall from the heavens into his hands.


8.49am GMT 

3rd over: England 24-0 (Hales 6, Lumb 18)

Mitchell Starc, whose last competitive action was in the first Ashes Test last 
summer, makes his return, and he should have had a wicket from it. The fourth 
delivery is sliced straight to Maxwell at gully, arriving at knee height, and 
is unaccountably dropped! Hales celebrates that let-off by powering the final 
delivery to the midwicket boundary, though Hodge really should have stopped it.


8.43am GMT 

2nd over: England 18-0 (Hales 1, Lumb 17)

After a random introductory over of part-time off-breaks, the ball is thrown 
to Nathan Coulter-Nile. Three speedy and accurate deliveries follow, but the 
fourth gives Lumb space and height and he needs to do little more than get his 
bat to it to divert it for four. And again he immediately follows up with 
another, clubbing the next delivery through midwicket for another four, though 
Hodge really should have stopped it.


Updated at 8.49am GMT

8.39am GMT 

1st over: England 10-0 (Hales 1, Lumb 9)

Lumb's sweep is struck firm, low and true, but zips straight to a fielder. So 
the next ball is dispatched through midwicket for four, and the one after that 
swept again, but this time into space, for another. That, and a brace of 
singles, is the sum of the opening-over action.


8.36am GMT 

…and Brad Hodge, 39-year-old Melbourne-based comeback-merchant, is opening the 
bowling.


8.34am GMT 

Action!

Pads are being stapped, gloves pulled, and surely-not-really-necessary red 
carpets trod. Action is totally imminent.


8.30am GMT 

"What exactly does Root have to do not to be picked?" moans Lanky. "Really fed 
up with the 'boys club' ruling who plays for England to the point of not being 
interested anymore." Sure, his form's not the greatest, buthis average in T20s 
<http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013-14/content/player/303669.html> 
appears to be a half-decent if obviously not-out-assisted 123.


8.26am GMT 

Also at the MCG today: Australia won the women's Twenty20 by seven wickets, 
and legendary old-timer Neil Harvey was present for the unveiling of his statue 
just outside the ground.


8.17am GMT 

England have brought James Tredwell in, and left Danny Briggs out. Australia 
have brought back 39-year-old Brad Hodge, the all-time all-comers highest 
Twenty20 run-scorer in all of history, after a six-year absence, and Mitchell 
Starc.


8.14am GMT 

I just popped away for a slice of toast, and in my absence England have won 
the toss and decided to bat. Team news follows…


7.59am GMT 

It's deadline day! Not the Sky Sports-sponsored bloated self-promoting 
transfer-related blahfest, though it is that too (see separate liveblog, which 
should get under way shortly), but the last chance for England to possibly not 
lose a series against Australia this winter. The Ashes are gone, the one-dayers 
have passed, and the first Twenty20 has slipped by. Lose this one too and, with 
only Sunday's third match in Sydney ahead of them, England's winter of 
humiliation will be complete.

It's like something out of the Hunger Games, this tour, with players plucked 
from their homeland and taken to a strange country where they battle to make 
sense of the fearsome beasts and unknown conditions that they are forced to 
contend with, and every now and then the gamesmakers totally change the format 
of the game, throw in some unknown foes and watch with glee as the poor 
players, stuck far from home and intent merely on surviving long enough to 
return, fight, flap and flounder. Some of them haven't made it this far, and 
their shrivelled remains have been transported back to their families. Of the 
rest, well, none of them have killed each other, but I'm betting a few have 
been tempted.


6.05pm GMT 

Simon will be here shortly for over-by-over coverage of the second Twenty20 
international. In the meantime, if you ever wondered what happened to Ashton 
Agar, then wonder no longer:

Last year's Ashes golden boy Ashton Agar has been suspended from Western 
Australia's next four-day match for breaching the CA code of behaviour.

Agar was found guilty of showing dissent towards an umpire's decision during 
WA's Futures League match against Queensland earlier this week.

It was the 20-year-old's second similar offence within the past 18 months, 
meaning it was treated as a level two charge.

The sanction of two suspension points means he's out of WA's next Sheffield 
Shield match starting on 12 February against Tasmania.
