I do so adore May, one of the biannual months in which Tatler solicits my 
opinions on bikinis or farming. The current cover story reflects exactly the 
pastoral idyll of my existence in rural Gloucestershire. Here I am on a swing, 
smiling suggestively in a ball gown. I look just like that Fragonard painting, 
only with better use of collagen. There I am in another ball gown, giggling 
suggestively at an old goat - not for the first time - and there's a darling 
one in which I pull up my ball gown suggestively to show my wellies.

That's what's been so wonderful about coming to the country and buying a few 
organic hens and being feted at the fete. I've come back to my roots. Well, not 
literally back to my roots - I'm from Basingstoke - but to my imagined roots, 
which have seen me make my accent plummier by the hour and dress my son in the 
manner of a slightly sickly dauphin. He adores those kid leather button shoes, 
even if the other children can be perfectly beastly. The adults are divinely 
uncomplicated, though. As I told Tatler, my friends drive all the way from 
London just to ogle the builders doing my barn conversion.

And crumbs, everyone in the country is having sex all the time, usually on the 
astrakhan sheepskin rugs in front of their roaring fires. Not just me, of 
course, with my funny waxwork husband, but also the hot hunks who stack shelves 
in the Co-op. Even better, I've remembered to pronounce it "Corp" like a posh 
person. Just call me Eliza Doo-very-little.
