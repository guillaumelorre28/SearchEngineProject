 Caspar David Friedrich, Winter Landscape, c1811 
The spooky romantic art of Caspar David Friedrich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/feb/19/artsfeatures2> anticipates 
America’s abstract expressionists in its bleak sublimity. Death seeps into the 
colours of this icy Alpine landscape just as it does into Mark Rothko’s 
terrifying abstractions.

 A tree nostalgic of the dampness by Ying Ji. Photograph: Ying Ji 
This is taken from Prisoner of Childhood, a collection of Ying Ji’s work 
recently on show in Shanghai. The Chinese artist’s series is a means of 
confronting the death of her father when she was a child.She explains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/21/ying-ji-photography-morbid-surrealism-death>
: “During my creative process, I would call the girl out on my own initiative 
and release my emotions, then find peace. This process is not easy for me. 
Sometimes even dangerous. But I will continue in this subject, where I extract 
my memories, one piece at a time, to allow the little girl to grow up, to allow 
myself to find my father.”
