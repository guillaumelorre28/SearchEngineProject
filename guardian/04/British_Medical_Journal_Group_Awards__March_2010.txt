The Guardian's Health Editor, Sarah Boseley, has been named Healthcare 
Communicator of the Year at theBritish Medical Journal Group Awards 2010 
<http://groupawards.bmj.com/>, winning in a category of high calibre nominees 
including BBC Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh.

The award celebrates an individual who has shown excellence in promoting 
understanding of medicine and health through the media.

The judges said Sarah was chosen 'for her articles about the reality of the 
lack of access to essential medicines for poor people in the developing 
world...she was also able to describe how the Guardian had persuaded 
GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Andrew Witty to visit a village in Uganda to 
see the problems for himself and then recount what steps GSK was planning to 
take to increase access to essential medicines.'
