Blur have released a live album of their Olympic closing concert. Just days 
afterthe band played Hyde Park in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/13/blur-olympic-closing-concert-review>
, a recording of the gig is already for sale on iTunes, with a CD and DVD 
release to follow.

ParkLive features 25 tracks, including Under the Westway, London Loves, Song 2 
and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Parklife. Made with the help of Abbey Road's Live 
Here Now service,Blur <https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur> were able to mix 
and master the soundboard recording quickly, putting it up for sale online 
within 24 hours.

Next week, Blur will start selling the concert , through their website as a 
limited edition three-CD set. In addition to the music from the Olympic closing 
concert, the set contains a disc of material from the band's warm-up concerts 
in Margate, Plymouth and Wolverhampton.

Blur are also preparing a deluxe ParkLive box set, due in November. This 
expanded edition incorporates the three previous CDs, a live DVD, and an 
additional CD of songs from Blur's 100 Club concert in early August. There will 
also be a 60-page hardback book with photographs from the mini-tour.

This seems a clever way for Blur to make a bit of money from their Hyde Park 
concert. The band told Absolute Radio they received just £300 to play the free 
gig. "When you divide that between four and add publishing, management and tax, 
it's down to about a quid,"Damon Albarn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn> said. "But that's not why you 
agree to do it … I love this city."
