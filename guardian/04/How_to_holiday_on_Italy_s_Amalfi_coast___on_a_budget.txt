One of Europe’s most desirable and romantic destinations, the Amalfi coast has 
been seducing visitors since antiquity. But until the 40km-long Strada Statale 
163 – connecting the hilltop village of Meta, just outside Sorrento, with 
Vietri sul Mare in the east – was blasted out of the base of the Lattari 
mountains in 1852, there was no road linking the coastal communities.

Today, this “road of 1,000 bends” hugs soaring cliffs and weaves tortuously in 
and out of deep gorges, passing olive groves, lemon terraces and tumbling 
whitewashed villages, all against a background of a shimmering azure sea. It is 
barely wide enough for two lanes of traffic, so in the crowded summer months 
traffic jams are inevitable, and best avoided by visiting off-season. In 
spring, the colours are bright, the air is fresh but the sea is chilly; better 
to come in late September or early October when the evenings are balmy, the 
water is still warm and the crowds have all but disappeared.

Meal prices exclude drinks and cover charge. Room rates all include breakfast 

Sant’Agata sui Due Golfi


Named for its hilltop position overlooking due golfi, the two bays of Naples 
and Salerno, Sant’Agata makes a good base for exploring the coast if you want 
to combine it with some walking. Agriturismo Le Tore is an organic olive farm 
just outside the village that offers nine simple, pretty rooms with 
hand-painted stencils on white-washed walls and two family-friendly apartments. 
Breakfast – fruit from the garden, fresh eggs, homemade cakes – is served under 
a fragrant pergola of roses and jasmine. From here, the famous Nastro Azzurro 
road twists and turns its way down the mountainside towards the shimmering sea 
below and Positano.

 Adolfo restaurant, Positano 
This tumble of cubic pastel-hued buildings clinging impossibly to an almost 
sheer cliff face is the coast’s most picturesque town, in spite of the crowds 
that clog its steep, narrow lanes in high season. Sharing the same premium 
views from most of its bedrooms as its much pricier neighbours, the stylish, 
super-friendly Villa Rosa is one of Positano’s better hotel deals. The cool 
whitewashed rooms all have spacious bougainvillea-draped terraces with comfy 
deck chairs placed to make the most of the views. There’s no dining room, so 
fresh pastries and steaming cappuccinos are served on your terrace in the

Capri

Although not strictly part of the Amalfi coast, Capri is a classic day trip 
from Positano. To get a more authentic feel for this dramatically beautiful 
island you should stay overnight: once the last packed hydrofoil has departed, 
the place seems to breathe a sigh of relief. Leave Capri town to the super-rich 
and catch one of the Lilliputian orange buses to low-key (and slightly more 
affordable) Anacapri where, a gentle half hour stroll above the town, Da 
Gelsomina offers a taste of rural island life. Known for its excellent 
restaurant, this smallholding has a handful of simple, pastel-hued rooms (with 
terraces and sea views) plus a pool.

that leads along the ridged top of the Lattari mountains. Stay at Le Sirene, a

Directly above the deep Vallone del Furore gorge lies the rugged little town 
of Furore, known for colourful murals and excellent DOC wines. The road from 
the coast zigzags up through a dramatic landscape of bare limestone and 
precariously narrow terraces planted with vines and accompanied by increasingly 
extraordinary views. A stay at the welcoming Agriturismo Sant’Alfonso, set on 
the mountainside 400 metres above sea level in steeply terraced grounds, will 
give you a feel for life beyond the coast, with great walking nearby. The nine 
cosy rooms are in a former monastery building: you’ll find wonderful 
home-cooked food, gardens with a small Jacuzzi, a menagerie of farm animals and 
great walking nearby.

With a magnificent setting on a mountain buttress overlooking the Bay of 
Salerno, the ravishing town of Ravello remains aloof from the madness of the 
coast 350 metres below. Its shady gardens, quiet lanes and sense of faded 
grandeur attracted the likes of Wagner, DH Lawrence and the Bloomsbury set, and 
you can see why: the slower pace of life is still seductive today. On a steep 
hillside halfway between the coast and town, Torre dello Ziro is a 
super-stylish B&B with six smart modern bedrooms, sea views and a fantastic

The coastal towns to the east of Amalfi are much less fashionable than their 
neighbours to the west, but that’s part of the charm. Minori is an attractive 
old place with a sandy beach, the remains of a Roman villa and what is arguably 
the best pastry shop in the area. The nicest affordable place to stay locally 
is just along the coast in less appealing Maiori: Casa Raffaele Conforti is a 
slightly faded nine-room gem occupying the top floors (no lift) of a 
19th-century townhouse stuffed with antiques and knick-knacks. Think frescoed 
rooms, original tiled floors and wallpapers, asalone with grand piano and a 
certain retro charm.

The authentic, unprettified village of Cetara offers a taste of what the 
Amalfi coast must have been like before the advent of mass tourism and has the 
only remaining working fishing fleet on thecostiera. It also boasts several 
great restaurants where you can sample the local speciality,colatura di alici, 
a fermented anchovy essence thought to be similar to the Romangarum. There is a 
handful of simple B&Bs plus the swanky Hotel Cetus, built into the cliffside 
just outside the village: 37 fresh, sea-facing rooms have jazzy tiled floors 
and balconies or terraces. There’s also a good restaurant, a small spa and a 
private beach with sun beds and umbrellas.

Where to eat
Tables at contemporary Acqua Pazza spill on to the street in summer, giving 
harbour views which make a perfect backdrop for tucking into paccheri pasta 
with monkfish, capers and cherry tomatoes or spaghetti with the in-house 
colatura.

Don’t miss
The tiny 10th-century chapel of Santa Maria de Olearia 
<http://www.comune.maiori.sa.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=113>
 is an atmospheric place hewn out of sheer rock where early frescoes decorate 
the vaulted ceiling and apse. It’s just above the SS163 to the west of Erchie: 
blink and you’ll miss it.

At the eastern limit of the costiera lies the town of Vietri, a name that is 
synonymous with the production of the colourful ceramics you find in every 
restaurant, hotel and bar up and down the coast. It has very little reasonably 
priced accommodation, but gritty, buzzing Salerno is only 4km away and here 
there’s plenty of choice, such as the Verdi, a bright new B&B not far from the 
tourist port. Housed on the second floor of an apartment building, it has three 
comfortable bedrooms in bold colours (one with a small terrace) plus a living 
room with a long communal table for an excellent breakfast spread.

Where to eat
It’s a little way from the centre of town but the pizzas at the Due Fratelli, 
baked in a wood-fired oven, are superb and come in two sizes, 700g and a 
massive 1.1kg. The house special is panuozzo, a kind of long, filled pizza 
sandwich. Try and bag a table on the top floor terrace.

Don’t miss
Designed in the 1950s by Paolo Soleri, a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright, the 
Solimene ceramics factory in Vietri is an extraordinary building that houses an 
Aladdin’s cave of an outlet shop, stuffed with bargains. The colourful naive 
animal designs are instantly recognisable.
