Information (BHI) figures show more than 664,000 patients visited the state’s 
emergency departments between October and December 2015 – a jump of 2% on the 
previous year – or 900 more people a week.

The opposition’s health spokesman, Walt Secord, said wait times for more than 
a quarter of those patients exceeded four hours.

Emergency patients at the western Sydney hospitals of Liverpool, Westmead and 
Nepean experienced some of the longest delays in Australia, he said.

“Sadly these are not just numbers, they have a human face,” Secord said. “They 
are thousands of mothers, fathers, children and grandparents who rely on the 
health and hospital system.”

The health minister, Jillian Skinner, blamed the surge on a severe flu season 
but she said NSW hospitals continued to perform at the highest standard despite 
the record influx.

She said the BHI figures showed emergency wait times had improved since 2010 
and elective surgery waits remained stable.

“Our hospitals continue to deliver high-quality and timely care,” she said.

However, the Australian Medical Association of NSW said hospitals were 
straining to cope with the record patient numbers and warned treatment delays 
would only get longer.

The AMA president, Dr Saxon Smith, said the figures highlighted the dangers of 
federal government cuts to health funding

, which would hit home in 2017.

“Hospital staff are working more efficiently than ever but they are just 
swamped with demand,” Smith said.
