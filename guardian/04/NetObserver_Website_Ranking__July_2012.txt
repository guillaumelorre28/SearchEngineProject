The Guardian has been voted the nation's favourite newspaper website, 
following a study conducted by NetObserver and Harris Interactive.

The study, which questioned UK internet users on their preferred websites, saw 
theguardian.com <https://www.theguardian.com/international> scoring the highest 
percentage of the newspaper vote in the 'General News / Information' category. 
The Guardian was also honoured in the 'Favourite Websites for Sport' category, 
coming within the top five and was the only newspaper to feature in the top ten.

The NetObserver study, which began in 1998, examines the value of websites 
against three key aspects: the level of overall satisfaction of the site's 
visitors, their intention to return and their intention to recommend the site 
to family and friends. It is the largest study of European internet users of 
its kind, using a sample of over 17,000 individuals residing in the UK and its 
results are a mark of excellence in demonstrating user engagement.
