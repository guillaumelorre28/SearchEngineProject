 The Rape of Europa by Guido Reni (1637). Photograph: Alamy 
There’s an unexpected calm and gentleness to Europa’s wild ride on the back of 
a bull in this beautifully coloured baroque painting. To understand it you have 
to know that the bull in this Greek myth is really Zeus, king of the Gods. Reni 
makes the story a Christian allegory of the power of the divine, with Europa 
looking reverently heavenward.
