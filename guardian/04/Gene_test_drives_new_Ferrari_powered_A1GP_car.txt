Ferrari test driver Marc Gene has given the thumbs-up to the new A1GP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/a1gp> car â€“ which is based on the F2004 
chassis and powered by a V8 Ferrari engine.

"It's an interesting car and I had a lot of fun," said Gene. "It's not an F1 
car but it's not intended to be one. It will produce exciting racing, allows 
overtaking, and is an extreme drive."

The car has now covered 3,500km, equivalent to around half a season's mileage, 
with the majority of testing being done by Andrea Bertolini, while Patrick 
Friesacher has also taken to the wheel. It will make its race debut in the 
first round of the 2008/09 championship at the Italian Mugello track in 
September.
