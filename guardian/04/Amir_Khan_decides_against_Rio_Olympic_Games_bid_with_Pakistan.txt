Amir Khan has decided not to pursue the chance to represent Pakistan at the 
Olympic Games <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games> in Rio.

Khan, who won a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Games, had said this month he 
would“love” the opportunity to represent the country of his parents’ birth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/british-boxing-ridicules-plan-professionals-fight-rio-olympics>
. But he has now acknowledged he will not be ready to seek a place in Rio via 
the final qualification tournament in Venezuela early next month.

What next for Amir Khan? One thing is for sure, it’s not Kell Brook

Khan is still recovering from the brutal sixth round knockout he suffered at 
the hands of Mexican Saul Alvárez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/08/amir-khan-saul-canelo-alvarez-middleweight-title-fight-boxing>
 in their WBC middleweight title fight in Las Vegas in May.

He had raised the possibility of returning to the Olympics after the world 
governing body, AIBA, ratified the eligibility of professional boxers for the 
event at its extraordinary congress in Lausanne.

Khan, who risked a two-year ban by the World Boxing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Council had he made a return to the 
Games, is one of the few fully professional fighters to speak out in favour of 
the move.

Wladimir Klitschko and Manny Pacquiao, as well as the 2012 gold medallists 
Vasyl Lomachenko and Zou Shiming, have all dismissed the opportunity to return 
in Rio.

And although AIBA is remaining tight-lipped on prospective entrants, it is 
looking increasingly likely its move to rush through the new eligibility 
criteria could end with an embarrassing failure to land any of the big 
professional names they crave.

To date Canada is the only nation to come out explicitly in favour of the 
move, with the Boxing Canada president, Pat Flacco, who is also an AIBA 
executive board member, confirming this week they will seek to fill their 
remaining quota with professional fighters.

Fiacco told the Regina Leader-Post: “We have a list of boxers that we’re ready 
to nominate. We’ve been in discussions with them. July is going to come around 
the corner real quick and they have to be ready for that qualifying tournament. 
I’ve received a ton of emails from professional boxers since [AIBA] made this 
announcement.”

AIBA boxers will continue to pursue their respective places in Rio at the 
world qualification event in Baku, Azerbaijan this week. They include Pat 
McCormack and Josh Kelly, who will bid to take Great Britain’s quota of 
qualified men’s boxers to a full 10 when they compete at light-welterweight and 
welterweight respectively.

Great Britain flatly rejected a belated and seemingly publicity-driven inquiry 
from reigning British middleweight champion Chris Eubank Jr about pursuing 
qualification for Rio.

Safety fears have been raised over the prospect of seasoned professionals like 
Khan facing relative novices at the Games, but the GB chef de mission, Mark 
England, said he would have no concerns in that increasingly unlikely 
eventuality.

Pointing at Khan’s previous experience at the Games, England said: “I took 
Amir to Athens when he was 17 years old and he fought the European champion in 
the first round and the Olympic gold medallist in the final.

“It [the introduction of professionals] is a complex issue we have debated 
long and hard around, and I think GB Boxing have got it spot on in terms of 
their comments around who may or may not make the team for Rio.

“I think it’s an issue for Rob [McCracken, GB performance director] and the GB 
Boxing team and we have got every confidence in the ability of the team to do 
well.”
