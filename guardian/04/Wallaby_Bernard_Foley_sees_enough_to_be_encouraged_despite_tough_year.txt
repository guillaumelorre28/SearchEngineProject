Wallabies five-eighth Bernard Foley insists the tough times endured by 
Australia this year have laid the foundation for future success.


Australia won six of 15 Tests in 2016, with most of the Wallabies returning 
home on Tuesday from the tour of Europe, where they beatWales

Coach Michael Cheika opted to spend a couple of extra days overseas and is 
expected to return later this week.


Foley was the only man to start all of Australia’s 2016 Tests and the 
introduction of over a dozen debutants this year had him upbeat about 
Australia’s future despite their unflattering win-loss record.

They endured a six-match losing streak, starting with the 2015 World Cup final 
and their 2016 log included four defeats by England and three to New Zealand.


“I think we’ve got a lot of optimism, you see how far this team has come,” 
Foley said at Sydney Airport. “So many of the young guys got to debut this year 
and that’s a great milestone.

“There was a lot of optimism when we first got together this year and 
realistically we were shut down pretty quickly and so we had to rebuild and 
face the challenges.


“Out of those tough times and that adversity a lot of guys stood up and that’s 
where I think the optimism and the potential going forward is. Those tough 
times have put us in a really good position for future success.”
