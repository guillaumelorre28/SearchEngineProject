We finish our audio advent calendar with four hours of Christmas music  
<http://open.spotify.com/user/dominorecords/playlist/1QElmuMfT8MAS0mxLjMwnN> 
chosen by Domino to get you through the festive season. Here's what they had to 
say ...

Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> Day is loaded 
with tough decisions: what to wear, what to cook, what to pass off as a 
last-minute present and, most importantly, how to soundtrack the special 
day/domestic row. With this in mind Domino set about taking that final concern 
off your hands.

We've selected four hours of music from across the festive spectrum to keep 
the family happy: from the stately classicism of John Williams's Home Alone 
soundtrack and James Brown's Funky Christmas to indie favourites from Sufjan 
Stevens and the Fall. There's also an extra helping of novelty courtesy of 
Eazy-E's Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas.
