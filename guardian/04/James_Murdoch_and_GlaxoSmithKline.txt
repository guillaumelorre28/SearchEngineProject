Many thanks to @pharmagossip <http://twitter.com/pharmagossip>, who reminded 
me this evening that James Murdoch is currently a non-executive director at 
pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. A quick Google led me to this brilliant 
quote fromthe Guardian article reporting his appoinment in 2009 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/02/james-murdoch-in-glaxosmithcline-role>
.

Chairman Sir Christopher Gent said at the time that he was "delighted to 
welcome James to the board of GSK," and noted:

He will also be an excellent addition to the board's corporate responsibility 
committee, an area where he has shown particular leadership at BSkyB and News 
Corporation.

Hmm. 

As the PharmaGossip blog notes 
<http://pharmagossip.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-james-murdoch-doing-on.html>:

James was re-elected to the Glaxo board in May with 97 per cert of the votes 
cast, but much has emerged about News Corp and its subsidiaries since.

I wonder how that vote would swing today?

GSK make the MMR vaccine, and so with tedious inevitability the anti-vaccine 
brigade have leapt onto this as yet more proof of the establishment campaign 
against their hero, the disgraced Andrew Wakefield.Age of Autism

 crank the conspiracy dial to eleven with...

Within a fortnight of [James Murdoch's] appointment [in 2009] News 
International had published at least 5 articles attackingMMR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr> researcher Andrew Wakefield's 
integrity

...but then note that...

The Sunday Times campaign against Wakefield began in 2003.

Right. So it turns out we can add precognition to James Murdoch's list of 
achievements.
