This Changes Everything 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/this-changes-everything.html> by Naomi Klein 
(Allen Lane): whatever you may think of her solutions, the problems – climate 
change, plus everything that is changing as a result, plus the increasing 
toxicity of the planet – can no longer be denied. This is a conversation that 
needs to happen on a large scale, and on a local scale, and on a personal 
scale, very soon. If the oceans die, so do we. It’s that simple.

Julian Barnes | You’ll Enjoy It When You Get There by Elizabeth Taylor

Mariusz Szczygiel’s Gottland <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/gottland.html> 
(Melville House) is one of those delightfully unclassifiable books: a Polish 
journalist’s informal history of 20th-century Czechoslovakia. Like a 
non-fictionalBohumil Hrabal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/15/bohumil-hrabal>, Szczygiel is 
strange and funny, constantly off at jaunty tangents. He begins with 40 pages 
about the Bata shoe factory and ends with a brilliantly worked double narrative 
about a female burns doctor who translatesDick Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dick-francis> in her spare time. And it’s 
all true, too.

Margaret Drabble <https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaret-drabble>’s 
selection of Elizabeth Taylor’s short stories,You’ll Enjoy It When You Get There
 (NYRB), shows a novelist entirely at ease with the shorter form: seemingly 
quiet and suburban tales that enclose rage and despair; Taylor is also very 
good on pubs and drinking.

Bob Mankoff’s How About Never – Is Never Good for You? 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-about-never-is-never-good-for-you.html> 
(Henry Holt) is a charming autobiography that answers one of the minor yet 
gripping questions of magazine publishing: who gets to choose the cartoons in 
the New Yorker (he does), what’s it like to submit one (nerve-shredding), and 
what percentage gets chosen (infinitesimal). A cheering book, nonetheless.

The book that knocked me sideways this year was Matilda Tristram’s Probably 
Nothing <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/probably-nothing.html> (Viking) – an 
incredibly moving account of her experience of being diagnosed with bowel 
cancer while several months pregnant, told through the graphic memoir. It is at 
once heart-wrenching, hilarious and deliciously sardonic.

The other standout books of the year have been two wonderful but completely 
different poetry collections.Outside Looking On 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/outside-looking-on.html> (Influx) by Chimene 
Suleyman presents startlingly perceptive snapshots of human experience, delving 
powerfully into themes that range from big-city loneliness and longing, to 
prejudice and love.

And When I Grow Up I Want to Be Mary Beard 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/when-i-grow-up-i-want-to-be-mary-beard.html> 
(Burning Eye), by student slam-poet sensationMegan Beech 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/53f1fb64e4b038fb92169cac/1138438>, 
is a vibrant and exciting exploration of gender inequality, modern feminism and 
what it means to be a young woman in the 21st century.

I’ve just read Colin Jones’s The Smile Revolution 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/smile-revolution.html> (Oxford) – on the 
changing protocols of smiling in 18th-century France. It’s about as hard a 
subject for “history” as you can imagine, but Jones does brilliantly by 
approaching it partly through the history of dentistry, with some extraordinary 
stories about 18th‑century teeth (or the lack of them).

For the future, trips out in Cambridge will be enhanced by Simon Bradley’s 
revision of thePevsner (Buildings of England) Guide to Cambridgeshire 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cambridgeshire.html> (Yale). It was much in 
need of updating and Bradley manages it expertly, without destroying the sparky 
style of the original.

For Nabokovian completists (and I confess to being incurable) the great treat 
this year wasLetters to Véra 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/letters-to-vera.html> (Penguin Classics), 
edited and translated byOlga Voronina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/09/letters-to-vera-vladimir-nabokov-review-happy-marriage>
 andBrian Boyd <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/brian-boyd>. Here is Nabokov
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/vladimirnabokov> with his guard down, 
writing for only one reader, but the literary guile remains as shrewd and 
uniquely individual as ever. The book is also quietly revelatory, with a fresh 
light shone on the mysterious Mrs Nabokov.

Sailing the Forest <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/sailing-the-forest-2.html> 
(Picador) byRobin Robertson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview16>
 is a wonderfully generous selected poems. Great precision of language, limpid 
observation and a rare ability to make the narrative of the poems resonate 
evocatively. A ripple-effect that is remarkably profound.

The Interestings by Meg Wolitzer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/10/meg-wolitzer-interview> 
(Vintage) is a pacy, conventional novel of American life, following six friends 
from their teens through to middle age, charting their interconnected hopes, 
triumphs and disappointments, but it’s all done with such an acute eye for 
detail, and such a rare combination of wit and wisdom that it becomes something 
new. I’m relieved to discover that, behind my back, Wolitzer has written nine 
more novels, so I can rest easy next year.

A fan once came up to Bob Dylan and said: “You don’t know who I am, but I know 
who you are.” To which Dylan replied: “Let’s keep it that way.”The Dylanologists
 <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dylanologists.html> (Atria) by David Kinney 
is a razor-sharp study of the crackpot world of the obsessive fan, by turns 
very funny and slightly scary. Dylan’s extreme standoffishness has only served 
to fuel his fans’ need to get closer to him; the obscurity of his lyrics 
increases his fans’ need to interpret them. The great man seems to love and 
loathe it all, in roughly equal measures.

Eleanor Marx: A Life <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/eleanor-marx.html> by 
Rachel Holmes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/eleanor-marx-rachel-holmes-review>
 (Bloomsbury): this wonderful biography of the great feminist, internationalist 
and trade unionist (who was so much more than her father’s youngest daughter) 
is as much a gripping family drama and whodunnit as a serious work of 
19th-century history. And so relevant to many current challenges.

The Establishment (and How They Get Away with It) 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/establishment.html> by Owen Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones> (Allen Lane): at a time when 
politicians aspire to be pop stars and vice versa, it is refreshing that a 
genuine political writer and thinker can achieve such popular appeal. Whether 
you agree or disagree with the Jones analysis, I challenge you not to be 
captivated by the authenticity of his voice.

Dept. of Speculation <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dept-of-speculation.html>
 byJenny Offill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/dept-speculation-review-jenny-offill>
 (Granta) is an account of a marriage in crisis and the pressures of 
motherhood, and is written with such clarity and poetry that at times it is 
almost unbearably moving. And yet it has some intensely funny and witty 
moments, too.

Spoiled Brats <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/spoiled-brats.html> by Simon 
Rich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/20/spoiled-brats-simon-rich-review-funniest-book-year>
 (Serpent’s Tail) is a collection of offbeat, surreal short stories, some of 
which appeared in the New Yorker. “Sell Out”, the story of a simple man who 
falls into a vat of pickles and awakes in modern-day Brooklyn, is a very funny 
skewering of hipsterdom.

The Empathy Exams <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/empathy-exams.html> by 
Leslie Jamison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/05/leslie-jamison-empathy-exams-confessional-writing-not-self-indulgent>
 (Granta). To my mind, there aren’t enough British essayists, which is why, as 
a fan ofJoan Didion <https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion> and Nora 
Ephron <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron>, I turn so often to 
American writers. As the title suggests, this collection examines empathy and 
what it means to feel pain, and covers topics ranging from Morgellons to 
Nicaragua to a job Jamison once had as a medical actor for trainee doctors, and 
each essay is illuminating, stylish and a pleasure to read.

I am currently obsessed with small-press books by women, most of which I 
bought at Powell’s bookstore in Portland, Oregon. Liz Scheid’sThe Shape of Blue 
<http://store.thelitpub.com/product/liz-scheid-s-the-shape-of-blue> (The Lit 
Pub) is a book far smaller in size than it is in spirit. This slim volume of 
experimental prose examines motherhood, grief and the complex ways that both 
these states of being tint even our most mundane experiences. I touched my 
face, so absorbed in the subtle story (rich with poetic and scientific detail) 
that I hadn’t registered my own tears.

Chloe Caldwell’s Women <http://www.hobartpulp.com/books/women> (Hobart) is 
another deceptively teensy book. This is the tragicomic tale of the author’s 
doomed relationship with an older woman and it perfectly captures the way good 
sex can make us throw anything under the bus – even our identities.

Mira Gonzalez’s I’ll Never Be Beautiful Enough to Make Us Beautiful Together 
<http://sorry.house/product/i-will-never-be-beautiful-enough-to-make-us-beautiful-together/>
 (Sorry House) brings experimental poetry into the internet age with dark, 
distinctly female riffs on ambition, depression and love.

John Gray | Mr Weston’s Good Wine by TF Powys

Now out in a new edition published by Vintage, Mr Weston’s Good Wine 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/mr-weston-s-good-wine.html> by TF Powys is one 
of the classics of English literature – and one of the strangest and most 
delightful books I’ve ever read. The story and the style are unfathomably 
simple. Accompanied by an assistant called Gabriel, a woolly-haired wine-seller 
drives into a small Dorset town called Folly Down. Time stops, and the sign on 
the battered van appears in the sky. Some in the town drink the light wine Mr 
Weston is selling, others the dark. Realising that the town is his own 
creation, the wine-seller longs to drink the dark wine himself. If you want to 
know how Mr Weston’s visit ends, you’ll have to read the book.

Translated into English for the first time by Siân Reynolds, The Mahe Circle 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/mahe-circle.html> (Penguin Classics) is one of 
Georges Simenon <https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgessimenon>’s most 
powerful roman durs – the non-Maigret novels in which ordinary lives are 
suddenly, and at times seemingly inexplicably, unsettled and irrevocably 
changed. Written in Simenon’s spare signature style, it’s unputdownably 
gripping.

Anthony Powell <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/30/news.obituaries>
’sWhat’s Become of Waring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/10-best-john-mullan> first 
appeared in 1939, and has been republished this year by the University of 
Chicago Press. Recognisably the work of the author ofA Dance to the Music of 
Time <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/26/fiction4>, it’s lighter and 
funnier than the later 12-volume cycle. But in some ways it’s also more cruel – 
a tale of literary charlatanry, set in the decayed world of interwar London 
publishing. I found it irresistible, and wish it had been twice as long.

In a determined effort to win public acquiescence, if not active support, for 
austerity, both the government and its media apologists have tried to hide the 
human impact of slash-and-burn economics.Mary O’Hara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maryohara>’s superb Austerity Bites 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/austerity-bites.html> strips bare the reality 
of what Osbornomics means for human beings and, crucially, she gives a platform 
to voices that are otherwise unheard and deliberately ignored. Ever since the 
so-called “war on terror” was unleashed, Muslims have been widely demonised. 
All too often, they appear as terrorists, extremists and a threat to be 
contained.

Arun Kundnani <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arun-kundnani>’s The 
Muslims Are Coming <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/muslims-are-coming.html> is 
a fantastic counterblast to the rise of Islamophobia.

’s history of Weimar,Weimar: From Enlightenment to the Present 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/weimar.html> (Yale), is a rivetingly 
unpleasant story, solidly and even wryly done here.

James Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-hamilton>’s A 
Strange Business <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/strange-business.html> 
(Atlantic) is a brilliantly engaging account of the most interesting of all 
subjects: how artists make their money, in this case in 19th-century England. 
The book was published just in time to cast a curious light over the Tate’s

All My Puny Sorrows <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/all-my-puny-sorrows.html> 
by Miriam Toews (Faber) is one of those rare novels destined to become a 
lifelong companion. This magnificently written story of two sisters, one of 
whom is determined to take her own life and asks the other for assistance, is 
shockingly funny, deeply wise and utterly heartbreaking.

In non-fiction, Glenn Greenwald 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/glenn-greenwald>’s No Place to Hide 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/no-place-to-hide.html> (Hamish Hamilton) has 
far more staying power than the ripped-from-his-own-headlines topic might

fast-disappearing privacy.

Simultaneously prompting sadness (because there will be no more work) and joy

It’s unusual on these occasions to recommend books that are often almost

Penelope Lively | On Silbury Hill by Adam Thorpe

Adam Thorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-thorpe>’s On Silbury Hill
 <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/on-silbury-hill.html> (Little Toller) is 
about that mysterious Wiltshire mound – archaeology, history, landscape – but 
with an undertow of memoir: brilliant.

Margaret Forster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/09/my-life-in-houses-margaret-forster-review-memoir-homes>
’sMy Life in Houses <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-life-in-houses.html> 
(Chatto & Windus) is such a clever idea. It’s a memoir sited in bricks and 
mortar, from childhood home to student lodging to marital home, to holiday 
cottage in Cumbria – social and personal history spliced together.

My roots are in West Somerset, so the new Somerset: South and West edition of 
Pevsner’s Buildings of England 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/somerset-south-and-west.html> (Yale) is warmly 
welcome. The old one, by Pevsner alone, was somewhat skimpy; Julian Orbach’s 
revisit is huge, reflecting the architectural riches of the area, and there is 
wealth within – informative and scholarly text, handsome photographs.

me in from its first paragraph –it is aWaterland 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/waterland-4.html> for the Outer Hebrides, and 
seems to me a major moment in the modern literature of those islands.

The poems of Ancient Sunlight

Lastly, Philip Marsden

My best historical novel is Winter Pilgrims 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/kingmaker-winter-pilgrims.html> (Century), 
Toby Clements’s blood-fuelled “I was there” rampage through the Wars of the 
Roses.

Winter bouquets should be offered to the clever and stylish Rachel Cusk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk>: her novel Outline 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/outline.html> (Faber) is smoothly 
accomplished, and fascinating both on the surface and in its depths.

Jenny Offill’s excellent Dept. of Speculation 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dept-of-speculation.html> is a fascinating 
examination of the complexity of the female writer’s post-childbirth experience 
of work as well as an astute, unsentimental portrayal of a foundering marriage.

Martin Dyar’s poetry collection Maiden Names (Arlen House) is both poignant 
and incisive, while Nigel McDowell’s children’s novelThe Black North 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-north.html> (Hot Key) is a great read 
and a cunning reworking of Irish history and lore into fantasy.

But the unstoppable CB Editions’ reissue of Ágota Kristóf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/12/agota-kristof-the-notebook-slavoj-zizek>
’sThe Notebook <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-notebook.html> is the book 
I have not been able to stop thinking about all year.

Pankaj Mishra | A Voice Still Heard: Selected Essays by Irving Howe

The Collected Poems (1969-2014) of Arvind Krishna Mehrotra 
<http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/en/content/collected-poems> (Penguin), 
superbly introduced byAmit Chaudhuri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amit-chaudhuri>, represent an older kind 
of literary achievement: cumulative, unshowy and consistently brilliant.

Irving Howe’s A Voice Still Heard: Selected Essays 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/voice-still-heard.html> (Yale) reminds us of 
the void this great critic left in anglophone commentary – one that David 
Bromwich has been filling in the last decade with the searing pieces collected 
inMoral Imagination (Princeton).

As mendacious nationalisms pollute the air from Japan to Hungary, Ranjit 
Hoskote and Ilija Trojanow’sConfluences: Forgotten Histories from East and West 
<http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9788190618670> (Yoda) 
points to an unimpeachable history of culture and society.

In his angrily subversive but always funny comic novel Bumf 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bumf.html> (Jonathan Cape), the graphic writer 
Joe Sacco <https://www.theguardian.com/books/joe-sacco> has found a perfect 
target in the machinery of politics and mass manipulation.

Michael Morpurgo | Quentin Blake by Joanna Carey

Quentin Blake <http://shop.tate.org.uk/quentin-blake/quentin-blake/invt/16220> 
byJoanna Carey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview26>
 (The House of Illustration): in a way, this beautiful book is a celebration of 
the opening of The House of Illustration, a project instigated by the great and 
beloved Quentin Blake. Carey has composed a fond appreciation of the artist and 
his work, which is, of course, wonderfully illustrated.

A Ted Hughes Bestiary 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/ted-hughes-bestiary.html> selected by Alice 
Oswald <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-oswald> (Faber): a collection 
of Hughes’s poetry of animals, wild and imagined, selected by Oswald is very 
much the inheritor of his mantle and understands Hughes and his world as well 
as anyone. Hughes’s poems are not all tooth and claw, as often imagined, but, 
rather, he opens our senses to the natural world as no one else can.

You wait a century for a major Norwegian writer then two come along at once … 
InPer Petterson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/03/per-petterson-interview>’s 
novelI Refuse <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/i-refuse.html> (Harvill Secker), 
childhood friends Jim and Tommy meet by chance, decades later, at a point of 
crisis for them both. The familiar Scandinavian tropes are present (snow, 
skating and depression) but the texture is moreIngmar Bergman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/31/guardianobituaries.obituaries> 
thanStieg Larsson <https://www.theguardian.com/books/stieg-larsson>: the 
suspense isn’t in the plot but the prose, with its extraordinary looping 
sentences. The translator is Don Bartlett, the man responsible for bringing us
Karl Ove Knausgaard <https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard>, the 
third part of whose life writing epic,Boyhood Island 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/boyhood-island.html> (Vintage), also weighed 
in here this year: why its seemingly banal episodes should be so compelling 
remains one of the great mysteries of our time.

The best biography I’ve read in 2014 is Adam Begley’s Updike 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/updike.html> (HarperCollins), an admiring but 
not uncritical portrait of a novelist who was merciless in drawing on his own 
experiences, sexual and otherwise.

And I’m enjoying A Modern Don Juan 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/modern-don-juan.html>, edited by Andy Croft 
and NS Thompson (Five Leaves), in which 15 contemporary poets lend fresh 
interest to Byron’s cantos, thanks to some ingenious modern rhymes (sequined 
cap / Gangsta rap, Che poster / pop-up toaster, Minerva’s Owl / Simon Cowell).

Andrew Motion | Paper Aeroplane by Simon Armitage

The poet Rosemary Tonks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/rosemary-tonks> made her name in 
the 60s and 70s, then withdrew from public sight and published nothing in the 
later part of her life. Following her recent death, Neil Astley has collected 
and introduced her work inBedouin of the London Evening 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bedouin-of-the-london-evening.html> 
(Bloodaxe). It’s a highly original collection, mingling savage realism with a 
surreal fancy, and it restores an essential voice of late-20th-century British 
poetry to its rightful place.

And among our contemporaries: one mid-career gathering of great distinction – 
Simon Armitage’s new and selected poemsPaper Aeroplane 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/paper-aeroplane.html> (Faber), and two 
outstandingly good pamphlets from recent arrivals:Sam Riviere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/standard-twin-fantasy-sam-riviere-review-amuse-bouche>
’sStandard Twin Fantasy 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/standard-twin-fantasy.html> (Egg Box) and 
Declan Ryan’s selection forFaber New Poets 12 
<http://faberpoetry.co.uk/2014/09/26/declan-ryan-on-sabotage-reviews/> (Faber).

I rarely wish that books were longer, but Lorrie Moore’s latest collection, 
Bark (Faber), was over far too soon. Weightier but just as entertaining was 
Hermione Lee’s brilliant biography of Penelope Fitzgerald (Vintage). I enjoyed 
Viv Albertine’s frank and funnyClothes, Clothes, Clothes, Music, Music, Music, 
Boys, Boys, Boys 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/clothes-clothes-clothes-music-music-music-boys-boys.html>
(Faber); Jenny Offill’s dark and spiky story of marital breakdownDept. of 
Speculation <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dept-of-speculation.html> and, 
almost a companion piece, the one volume collection of Updike’s portrait of a 
marriage across the years,The Maples Stories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/11/maples-stories-john-updike-review>
(Evergreen). Finally, the great Denis Johnson’s dark espionage novelThe 
Laughing Monsters <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/laughing-monsters.html> 
(Harvill Secker), out early next year.

Ian Rankin | The Zone of Interest by Martin Amis

I Can See in the Dark 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/i-can-see-in-the-dark.html> by Karin Fossum 
(Vintage) is an off-kilter crime story about a disturbed care worker and his 
murderous life. Unsettling and scarily well written.The Zone of Interest 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/zone-of-interest.html> (Jonathan Cape) is 
Martin Amis’s best novel in years, a grim yet satire-flecked investigation of 
the Nazi death camps. Van Morrison’s Lit Up Inside 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/lit-up-inside.html> (Faber) collects many of 
the great man’s favourite lyrics, and includes a foreword by a long-time fan.

The deservedly prize-winning H Is for Hawk 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/h-is-for-hawk.html> by Helen Macdonald 
(Jonathan Cape): I’ve never read anything like it before. The writing is 
beautiful and the emotion rich on every page; reading it you sink into love and 
the kind of feelings you rarely, if ever, experience in fiction today, still 
less in a work that has won a distinguished prize for non‑fiction. The last 
lines brought tears to my eyes.

Sarah Waters’ The Paying Guests 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/paying-guests-3.html> (Virago): the only fault 
I have to find with Waters is that she writes too seldom. I expected to take 
this novel, all 564 pages of it, at a leisurely pace. But I raced through it, 
breathing fast and when I had finished had to reread parts of the wonderful 
early chapters. I don’t like historical novels but this is the exception. I 
shall let a few months go by and then read it all over again with, I’m sure, 
undiminished pleasure.

From among newer writers: Mirza Waheed’s The Book of Gold Leaves 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/book-of-gold-leaves.html> (Penguin) is a 
beautifully told and finely choreographed story of love, art and conflict in 
Kashmir – and should certainly be bought in hardback for the amazing cover 
illustration based on a gold painting made by the author’s great-grandfather. 
From among those we’ve been lucky enough to have had around for a good few 
years now: there is no one like Ali Smith, andHow to Be Both 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-to-be-both.html> (Hamish Hamilton) is 
glorious proof that she keeps getting better.

It’s been a year of trying to understand why the global economy is run on 
behalf of the rich. Try these: James Meek’sPrivate Island 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/private-island-why-britain-now-belongs-to-someone-else.html>
. Forget immigration; it’s the foreign rich who own us.How to Speak Money 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-to-speak-money.html> by John Lanchester 
(Faber). Funny and frightening dic(k)tionary of what the banksters mean when 
they talk money and how to get the “con” out of economics. Thomas Piketty –
Capital in the 21st Century 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century.html>. 
(Harvard). Had to read twice – hard work but worth it. Russell Brand’sRevolution
 <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/revolution-7.html> (Century). Facts, fun and 
a reminder that inequality is manmade and what we make we can unmake. As an 
unlikely ally,Mrs Moneypenny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/22/heather-mcgregor> says in her 
Financial Advice for Independent Women 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/mrs-moneypenny-s-financial-advice-for-independent-women.html>
 (Penguin): “You should aim to become more financially literate, with the aim 
of behaviour change.” Give it to George Osborne for Christmas.

And to stop myself going mad, add the sublime Don Paterson’s Smith 
<http://www.picador.com/books/smith-a-reader-s-guide-to-the-poetry-of-michael-do>
 (Picador), his eccentric, beautiful zen guide to the poetry of Michael Donaghy.
