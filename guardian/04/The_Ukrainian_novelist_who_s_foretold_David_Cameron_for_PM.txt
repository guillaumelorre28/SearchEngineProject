His opinion poll lead is shrinking, but David Cameron can rest assured: he's 
going to be the next prime minister of Great Britain. So says the Ukrainian 
writer Andrey Kurkov, whose novel The President's Last Love 
<http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/book.htm?command=Search&db=main.txt&eqisbndata=0099485044>
, published in 2004, has proved ­startlingly prophetic. Its fictional President 
Bunin is mysteriously poisoned – the same fate that befell Viktor Yushchenko, 
Ukraine's real president, six months later. (So uncanny was the parallel that 
two Ukrainian generals asked Kurkov over coffee and cognac whether his book 
might have ­inspired the attempted hit.)

In the novel's most memorable scene, set in 2013, Bunin and other European 
leaders go ice-dipping in Moscow. "On an identical strip of carpet to my right, 
robed in the Union Jack, the youthful Conservative prime minister of Great 
Britain," Bunin observes. And Russia's leader, of course, is one Vladimir Putin 
– said to have been re-elected as president after several years "in the 
wilderness". Most experts expect this scenario to happen for real in 2012.

Kurkov's novels are best­sellers across Europe; his tone of ­grotesque comedy 
captures the absurdities of life in the post-Soviet Union. Asked about 
­Britain, Kurkov says he can envisage Cameron as the next PM. But he confesses 
that he finds British politicians less interesting than their Ukrainian 
counterparts. "You don't have enough lunatics, like we have." But what about 
Boris Johnson, I suggest? "He's much more understandable for Ukrainians. I like 
him very much!" Kurkov says.
