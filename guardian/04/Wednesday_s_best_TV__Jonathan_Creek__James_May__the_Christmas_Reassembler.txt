Arrivals 
7pm, Channel 4

Watching strangers entering Heathrow airport arrival halls doesn’t sound like 
a thrilling way to spend an hour. But, actually, this film is rather sweet. And 
among the gap year kids and long-distance lovers, there’s real pathos in the 
shape of Khaled, a Syrian refugee waiting for his three-year-old, Ali, whom he 
hasn’t seen in a year. “Will he even recognise me?” he wonders. Their reunion 
is the documentary’s emotional gut-punch, making the occasional longueurs 
worthwhile.Phil Harrison

Robot Wars: Battle of the Stars
8pm, BBC2

Baying crowd? Tick. Underground carpark vibe? Tick. Heavy rock soundtrack? 
Tick. It couldn’t be better: a kind of guilt-free version of dogfighting with a 
thin veneer of engineering knowhow bolted on. Even celeb guests such as Suzi 
Perry and the Brownlee brothers can’t disguise the fact that the real stars of 
the show are the sheet-metal creations doing battle in the arena. Pro tip: 
build a big robot with a ramp at the front. Concludes tomorrow.John Robinson

Jonathan Creek 
9pm, BBC1

Kicking off with a gloriously lurid tribute to the heyday of Hammer horror, 
the latest mystery for Alan Davies’s mooching sleuth sees him drawn to the 
seemingly cursed country seat of Daemons’ Roost to reconnect with a previous 
client. Along with wife Polly (Sarah Alexander), he inevitably digs up much 
more than he bargained for. Warwick Davis provides enthusiastic comic support 
as an illusion-loving vicar, while Creek’s much-missed duffle coat makes a 
cameo.Graeme Virtue

James May: the Christmas Reassembler 
9pm, BBC4

It’s very easy to imagine the young James May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/james-may> on Christmas morning, 
1972, rapt with joy at his new Hornby Flying Scotsman. It’s also easy to 
imagine the little scamp a few hours later, in floods of tears after piloting 
his latest toy violently into a wall. In this festive special, he relives this 
childhood trauma by reducing his model train to its 138 tiny component parts 
and then lovingly restoring it to its full glory.PH

Disappeared: The Search for Cody Dial 
9pm, National Geographic

Cody Dial, a young adventurer from Alaska, went missing in the Costa Rican 
jungle in 2014, his parents Roman and Peggy last hearing from him in an email 
sent from a cafe in Puerto Jiménez. Having always suspected foul play, the 
Dials retrace his footsteps with the help of investigators, speaking to some of 
those he met in the days leading up to his disappearance. Could he have 
actually made it out alive?Ben Arnold

Pop Quiz: The Comeback
9.30pm, BBC4

Mike Read must have hoped that enough water had passed under the bridge since 
his Ukip calypso song for him to venture a proper return to TV. It hasn’t; 
there isn’t enough water in the universe for that. Here he is nonetheless with 
the first of two special editions of the 80s show. Stars of that era test their 
knowledge of what was arguably pop’s finest era, with guests including Toyah 
Willcox, Leee John, Mari WIlson and Andy McCluskey.David Stubbs

Scream Queens 
11.45pm, E4 

The zombie lovechild of Glee and Scream concludes with its trademark mix of 
comedy, horror and extreme darkness. Hester (Lea Michele) is desperate to 
secure her future so makes a bold move. Brock performs life-saving surgery on 
Munsch, but will it be too dangerous to succeed? It’s the Green Meanie who 
poses the biggest threat in this season finale, as one last plan for revenge 
begins. Ridiculously good fun, with a stellar cast who aren’t afraid to camp it 
up.Hannah Verdier

Film choices

Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of The Were-Rabbit (Nick Park, Steve Box, 2005) 
10.30am, BBC1
Wacky inventor Wallace and his much smarter dog Gromit are running a 
pest-control business that gets very busy when a supersized bunny threatens the 
produce at Lady Tottington’s giant vegetable fete. It’s a hilarious, 
heartwarming spoof brought joyously to life via stop-motion and modelling clay.
Paul Howlett

The African Queen (John Huston, 1951) 10.55am, Channel 5
Humphrey Bogart won his only Oscar as Charlie Allnutt, a gin-soaked skipper on 
the riverboat African Queen. He and Katharine Hepburn’s Rose make one of the 
great odd couples, sparking off each other in every cranky exchange along the 
leech-ridden river as they struggle to sink a first world war German gunboat.PH

 Tender and moving … Ethel & Ernest. Photograph: Vertigo Films 
This screen version of The Snowman creator Raymond Briggs’s graphic novel 
about his parents is tender and moving. Briggs’s artwork is beautifully 
reproduced in a tale that moves from a milkman wooing a maid in 20s south 
London to the birth of young Raymond, the blitz, through to the poignant, 
Alzheimer’s-shadowed conclusion.PH

Blue Is The Warmest Colour (Abdellatif Kechiche, 2013) 12midnight, Film4
This Palme d’Or-winning love story is an intense portrait of quivering 
youthful passion, much of which is down to the luminous performances of the two 
young stars. Adèle Exarchopoulos is a thoughtful high-school girl (also called 
Adèle) who becomes fascinated by mature, intellectual art student Emma (Léa 
Seydoux). Their ardent relationship is laid bare not just in the utterly honest 
sex scenes, but in the closeups on their enraptured faces. A deeply touching 
romance.PH
