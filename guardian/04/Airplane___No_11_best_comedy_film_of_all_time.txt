By rights you should hate Airplane!, simply because its influence stretches to 
every single woeful parody film made in the last three decades. Without 
Airplane! there'd be no Epic Movie or Date Movie or Meet the Spartans or Robin 
Hood: Men In Tights. But, despite all the pain and misery that it's indirectly 
inflicted on the world, do you hate it? Of course not. That's becauseAirplane! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/airplane> is untouchably brilliant.

The plot is an irrelevance – if you must know, there's a virus that takes hold 
of a plane full of passengers – because it's merely a peg to hang hundreds and 
hundreds of jokes on. The density of gags that writers Jim Abrahams and David 
and Jerry Zucker manage to squeeze into its 88 minutes is nothing short of 
breathtaking. They come so thick and fast, and they're delivered with such 
irresistible deadpan sincerity, that repeated views are a must. And what makes 
Airplane! all the more incredible is that it refuses to be dulled by 
familiarity. No matter how many times it gets quoted, or how many of its 
catchphrases have entered the modern lexicon, Airplane! is still as fresh now 
as it was on its release. Glorious.
