Mark Latham, Andrew Bolt and Eddie McGuire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/eddie-mcguire> have beaten tough competition 
to be recognised for their sexist remarks at the 2016 Ernie awards.

The event is a “fun but deadly attack” on sexism across Australian society and 
has been held annually since 1993.

The ceremony was held at New South Wales Parliament House in Sydney on 
Thursday night, with the winners of each category determined by the loudest 
response from the audience.

Mark Latham <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/mark-latham>, a 
three-time nominee, led a competitive political category with his comment about 
domestic violence in late January: “By attacking poverty rather than attacking 
men you’ll get a far better solution than the nonsense we’re hearing from Rosie 
Batty and the other left feminists.”


Latham also won the Clinton award for repeat offending.

Andrew Bolt won the media Silver Ernie for remarking of his ABC documentary on 
Indigenous recognition

 costar, the Indigenous politician Linda Burney: “It was tricky because she is 
gorgeous and she’s a woman and it’s very difficult for a white male to debate 
an Aboriginal woman and not be seen as a bully or mean.”

Burney was present at the awards, dressed as Nova Peris for the theme of 
golden girls.

on-air remark about drowning

 the sports journalist Caroline Wilson in June. “I’ll put in 10 grand straight 
away – make it 20. And, if she stays under the water, 50.”

Rolf Harris <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rolf-harris> won the 
celebrity Silver Ernie for his song Gutter Girls, which he wrote from prison in 
July with the lyrics: “Sleeping in the daytime, lying every night/She’s 
scheming, screaming bloody rape and she’s got you in her sight.”

The Elaine award for the “remark least helpful to the sisterhood” was awarded 
toPauline Hanson <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> 
for her maiden speech in Parliament, in which she linked domestic violence to 
family court decisions.

“Women make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to the 
children,” she said. “Until we treat mums and dads with the same courtesy and 
rights, we will continue to see murders due to sheer frustration and depression 
and mental illness caused by this unworkable system.”

Crikey’s political editor, Bernard Keane, who condemned Hanson’s “sickening” 
and “evil” speech, shared the Good Ernie award with Byron shire council, which 
banned Wicked Campers from its caravan parks.

The overall Gold Ernie award, given to one of the category winners, was 
jointly won by the Melbourne barrister Ben Mallick and the NSW Department of 
Education.

Mallick won the judicial Silver Ernie for a comment he made while representing 
a taxi driver charged with the indecent assault of a young woman in May.

“She sat in the front seat … she was advised by her mum not to do that,” 
Mallick told the Melbourne magistrates court 
<http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/illchosen-words-haunt-lawyer-who-defended-taxi-driver-on-indecent-assault-charges-20160512-gota8y.html>
. “She can avoid this happening by doing what other women do … by sitting in 
the back seat.”

The NSW Department of Education won the industrial Silver Ernie for its new 
teacher salary system 
<http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/new-teacher-salary-system-discriminates-against-women-20160708-gq1aaf.html>
, under which top teachers’ pay is downgraded to a beginner’s salary if they 
take time off to have children.

Organisers said in a statement that recipients of the gold award had varied 
over the years.


“Originally it was the judges and the trade unionists but, as they cleaned up 
their acts, the sportsmen and now the celebrities have taken over. Politicians 
are always a reliable standby.

“At the beginning of each year we fear that no one will say anything terrible 
during the year so we won’t be able to have an Ernies. We are never let down.”
