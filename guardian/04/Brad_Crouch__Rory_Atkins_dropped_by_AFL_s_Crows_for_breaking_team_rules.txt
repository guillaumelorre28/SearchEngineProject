Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> midfielders Brad Crouch 
and Rory Atkins have been dumped from the Crows’ team to take on Gold Coast in 
an AFL pre-season match on Friday night for disciplinary reasons.


Coach Don Pyke said the decision to omit the pair was taken following a 
recommendation by the Adelaide leadership group. “Our players have established 
a trademark and standards which govern their behaviour both on and off the 
field,” Pyke said. “In this instance, Brad and Rory did not meet those 
standards when the playing group had a break from training over the weekend.”

First-year coach Pyke said the indiscretions were not of a serious nature and 
wouldn’t comment when asked if alcohol was a factor, but the pair will now 
represent the SANFL Crows in a practice match against South Adelaide on 
Saturday. Crouch and Atkins will then be eligible for selection for Adelaide’s 
home and away season opener against North Melbourne on March 26.


“For both of those guys, it’s an opportunity to learn and understand that’s 
not how we’re going to operate as a footy club,” Pyke told reporters on 
Thursday. “Both boys were really contrite and disappointed in themselves. They 
understand they’ve let themselves down and they’ve let their teammates down.”

The highly-talented Crouch, 21, did not play any senior football last year due 
to a foot stress fracture. He joined the Crows as a 17-year-old on-traded draft 
selection in 2013 and has played 25AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> 
matches. The suspension robs him of valuable match practice before the start of 
the season.

The 21-year-old Atkins made his senior debut last year in a breakout campaign 
that yielded eight appearances at the top level. The Crows’ match against the 
Suns at Metricon Stadium is the final pre-season hit-out for both clubs.
