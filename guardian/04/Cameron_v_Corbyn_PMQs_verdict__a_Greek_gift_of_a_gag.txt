Key points

Jeremy Corbyn used all six of his questions to hold the government to account 
over its delayed free childcare policy, highlightedin a National Audit Office 
report 
<http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2016/03/outcomes-free-childcare-programme-unknown-says-nao>
, and the teacher recruitment crisis,previously brought up by the NAO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/teachers-are-leaving-as-government-falls-short-on-recruitment-nao-finds>
. He quoted a teacher called Tom, asking what Cameron was doing about the 
retention and recruitment crisis in teaching.

On the delayed free 30 hours of childcare for the poorest families, Cameron 
was able to update the NAO figures to show how things had improved since the 
report’s figures were collected, and on teachers, he sidestepped the current 
situation by comparing it with before his premiership.

Snap verdict

Corbyn is clearly on to something with his talk of “agency Britain”, and by 
and large, he successfully prodded Cameron on the issues of childcare and 
schools in a way that exposed government delivery weaknesses, but it was a 
performance that was competent rather than exciting. Cameron was left sounding 
awkward but never seriously embarrassed. As for the detail, the fact-checkers 
will have a bonanza, because this was a PMQs unusually rich in statistics. 
Cameron sidestepped the most tricky complaints about his record, but he was 
well armed with positive detail with which he could retaliate. The serious tone 
will appeal tothose who hated last week’s abuse

, but Cameron could not resist one snappy but largely irrelevant joke.

Best lines

Corbyn cited the burgeoning use of agency supply teachers in school, asking: 
“Aren’t we moving into an era that can be known as agency Britain?”

Cameron had a joke up his sleeve. Referring to Corbyn’s decision to ask Yanis 
Varoufakis, the former finance minister in Greece, to advise Labour, he said:

“The Labour economic policy in two words: Acropolis now.”

Twitter users were not impressed.
