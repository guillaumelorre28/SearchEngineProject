With risk seemingly back on the agenda, the gold safe haven has lost some of 
its glister.

The precious metal is currently down nearly $30 an ounce at $1843, and the 
recently strong gold mining companies have dipped back as a result.

Randgold Resources is the biggest faller in a fairly upbeat FTSE 100, down 
100p at £68.40 although it should be pointed out the group has climbed from 
£55.35 since the start of August.

Leading the mid-cap fallers is African Barrick Gold, down 17.5p at 586p. The 
miner, which has four gold mines in Tanzania, said it planned to list on the 
country's exchange by the end of the year. This is later than the initial plan 
of making the move by the end of this month. It also said it was planning to 
double output to 2m ounces by 2024 from an expected 1m ounces in 2014. It 
produced 700,000 ounces last year.

Elsewhere among the fallers Imperial Tobacco is 9p lower at £20.96 after 
Goldman Sachs removed the cigarette maker from its pan-European buy list and 
cut its target price from £24 to £21.90.

Diageo has dipped 6p to £12.14 as the drinks group's shares went ex-dividend.

Overall though the FTSE 100 has jumped 115.04 points to 5671.88, helped by 
news that a German court rejected lawsuits attempting to block its 
participation in the Eurozone bailouts. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist 
at City Index, said:
 A late rally in US markets last night and a positive session in Asia trading 
this morning has helped to convince bargain hunters to make their move in 
Europe today, helping to lift the FTSE, DAX and CAC higher by over 2%.

A ruing in the German Constitutional Court to reject a series of lawsuits 
aimed at blocking German participation in euro zone bailouts was well received 
by the market. Most investors had expected the ruling though given the 
sensitivity of market sentiment, there was natural caution for any surprises.
