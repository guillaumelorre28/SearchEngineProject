Central Sydney’s temperature will climb to 37C on Wednesday while the west can 
expect to hit 38C, according to the weather bureau. “We are going to have 
generally hot and dry north-westerly winds associated with these warm 
temperatures,” said a forecaster, Sarah Chadwick.

The hot north-westerlies will contribute to a higher risk of fire, she warns. 
Across NSW, a severe fire danger warning is in place for the lower central west 
plains and the south, eastern and northern Riverina districts.

The Red Cross has cautioned that people should keep an eye out for the 
vulnerable during the hot weather. “Remember to check on your neighbours 
because older people, pregnant women, children, those with a disability and 
people taking medications are among those who are more at risk in a heatwave,” 
the group said.

It’s expected cool relief will come on Thursday, with temperatures tipped to 
drop to 22C in Sydney.
