Sports journalists from the Guardian and The Observer have been featured in a 
list which names the UK's top 50 sports writers. The online survey, which was 
carried out by the industry magazine Press Gazette, named eleven Guardian and 
Observer writers in the list, with Guardian sports journalistDavid Conn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidconn> in the top five.

Press Gazette invited readers to take part in an online poll and name their 
top ten sports writers following the conclusion of the London 2012 Olympics 
this summer. Over 150 individuals took part in the survey, including some of 
the top names in British sports journalism.
