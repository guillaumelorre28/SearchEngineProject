The planned opening of Herbal Outfitters in Valdez comes nearly two years 
after voters approvedallowing people 21 and older to recreationally use pot

Herbal Outfitters’ offerings will mark the first time it is legal to buy pot 
under the voter initiative approved in November 2014. Passage of the measure 
made it legal under state law to possess up to an ounce of marijuana outside of 
a home.

The Valdez opening comes less than a week after the opening of the state’s 
first testing lab, CannTest, in Anchorage. The testing business opened on 
Monday after clearing regulatory hurdles days earlier. It will test cannabis 
flowers, edibles and concentrates.

Herbal Outfitters’ general manager, Derek Morris, said the store would 
initially carry only dried cannabis flowers. He said manufacturers of edibles 
and concentrates were still in various stages of the permitting process.

Morris said the operators expected to be steadily busy. People from around the 
state, including Anchorage, have said they plan to make the trip for the grand 
opening, he said.

In Fairbanks, two marijuana retail stores are planning to open next week after 
final inspections are completed, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported. A 
third Fairbanks store plans to open in about one month.
