walked at the front of the cortege as a horse-drawn hearse carried the 
flag-draped coffin.

Boutros-Ghali was a scion of a prominent Christian political family: the head 
of Egypt’s Coptic Church attended the service in Cairo, along with senior 
church dignitaries. The Coptic patriarch, Pope Tawadros II, saidEgypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> was bidding farewell to “this fine 
example in Egyptian life and in Egyptian history”.

The diplomat, who died on Tuesday at the age of 93, helped negotiate Egypt’s 
peace deal withIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel>, signed in 
1979, but then clashed with the US when he served a single term as the UN’s 
secretary general. He was the UN’s first chief from the African continent.

He is survived by his Jewish wife, Leia Maria. They had no children.

The current UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, described him as a respected 
statesman and scholar of international law who brought “formidable experience 
and intellectual power” to the job.

He headed the world body during one of its most difficult periods marked by 
crises in Somalia, Rwanda, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia.
