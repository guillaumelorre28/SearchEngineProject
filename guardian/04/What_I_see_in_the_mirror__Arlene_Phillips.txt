Mirrors are part of my life and an ever-changing source of delight, 
displeasure or even disaster, depending on which one I am looking in. I look in 
a magnifying mirror when I pluck my eyebrows in the morning, full-length 
mirrors every day in rehearsal, and I often nervously bring out a compact to 
check my make-up.

Generally, it is not that I like what I see but that I live with what I see, 
because there is not a lot I can change. When I am in rehearsal, my tracksuits 
are carefully placed to disguise parts of my body. I'll think, "My bum looks 
big today, so a cardigan will hide it."

I like to look as good as I can, and dancing keeps me strong physically and 
mentally, but I am 67 and nothing can change that. So, although I am constantly 
analysing what I see in the mirror, I am accepting of my appearance and try not 
to get frustrated. When I've plucked my eyebrows – which grow at a rate of 
knots – I quickly turn away from the magnifying mirror, because I know that's 
what I look like in HD – every wrinkle showing.

I am five foot two and a half, and vary between a size 10 and size 12. 
I constantly diet. People laugh when I arrive at rehearsal with my box of 
sliced beetroot and bag of chicory, but if I indulge in a cupcake binge or a 
large bowl of pasta, it shows. Although I'm still dancing a lot, it doesn't 
have much effect on my body any more.
