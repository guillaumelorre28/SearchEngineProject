Famed Spanish opera singer Montserrat Caballé has been placed under judicial 
investigation for alleged tax fraud, legal officials said on Tuesday.

Caballé, 81, is suspected of defrauding the Spanish tax authorities of more 
than €500,000 ($690,000) by funnelling earnings from foreign concerts through a 
company in the principality ofAndorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/andorra>, said a source at the Barcelona 
prosecutors' office.

The singer, who toured the world in a career spanning 50 years and came to 
worldwide prominence when she recorded a song with Freddy Mercury for the 1992 
Barcelona Olympic Games, is to face an investigating judge on 9 May, the source 
said.

An official at Catalonia's high court confirmed Caballé had been called to 
testify over a tax case but did not specify a date for the hearing. Caballé 
could not be reached immediately for comment.

In October 2012, the singer suffered a minor stroke and broke her arm while in 
Russia and was flown to hospital in Barcelona.
