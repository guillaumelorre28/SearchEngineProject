So The X Factor returns, with the format altered to create a sort of karaoke 
bear pit in which I more than ever resemble the eminently slappable Godzuki to 
Simon's Godzilla. Sometimes I think I'll gnaw off my own awkwardly flapping 
arms if I see one more shot of a crowd cheering like complete spanners. Plus, 
I've had to suffer my former judging panel nemisis telling the papers that 
"Louis is a genuine sweetheart. He melted my heart when he apologised for his 
behaviour last year".

Alas, warpings of the balance of power have necessitated an uneasy alliance 
with Dannii. If I had to liken it to anything, I'd say it resembles the allied 
coalition against Napoleon, only with slightly more riding on it. But it's all 
worth it for the chance to change someone's life, at least for the six months 
before they get ditched by their record label and passed over for nightclub 
personal appearances in favour of Chico.

Before the first audition, Simon gave us our new character notes. "Dannii, 
you're still serving up directionless platitudes, but now with a side order of 
what I'm calling wit, but which consists of the odd eyebrow movement in honour 
of Hans Blix declaring your face in compliance with UN resolutions against 
chemical proliferation. Cheryl, you're fabulous, dewy, luminous – you're the 
entire show." He turned on his heel.

"What about me?" I squeaked.

He smiled thinly. "Louis, you're still pathetically grateful to be here."

I've missed his kidding around.
