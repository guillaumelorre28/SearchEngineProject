The day in brief

Runs. Lots of them. Mostly to David Warner and Matt Renshaw. It was a frenetic 
start to the day as Warner raced to the first ever hundred before lunch by an 
Australian Test batsman playing on home soil. When he departed for 113 from 95 
deliveries, an entire nation groaned. He was simply astonishing in peeling off 
one of the most memorable of his 18 Test centuries.

When he departed Matt Renshaw hasn’t reached 40; now the Queensland youngster 
is 167 not out overnight having completed as impressive a maiden Testr hundred 
as you could hope for. The home side lost Warner, Usman Khawaja (13) and Steve 
Smith (24) – the latter pair to strange, avoidable dismissal – bot bossed it 
otherwise. They’re in a commanding position leading into day two.

Pakistan? Yasir tried and got belted for 1-132 from 30 overs. Wahab didn’t 
disgrace himself but two wickets were maybe more than he deserved, while Amir 
was luckless and never less than spirited. Which is all to say that it was a 
dirty day for the tourists. Things can only get better tomorrow, surely.

Stumps on day one - Australia are right on top thanks to Warner and Renshaw!

88th over: Australia 365-3 (Renshaw 167, Handscomb 40)

That is stumps on day one, a day of cricket which has belonged to David Warner 
and Matt Renshaw and their remarkably different but differently remarkable 
centuries. Warner unleashed his before lunch to make history, while the younger 
man walks off undefeated with 167 next to his name – the tortoise to his 
team-mate’s hare. And that is that for the day. Australia has dominated with 
the bat and Pakistan will now lick their wounds.

87th over: Australia 356-3 (Renshaw 161, Handscomb 37)

If Matt Renshaw is feeling any pressure late in the day he’s not showing it, 
though 160 runs in his kick no doubt helps. Amir’s line is tight and 
unrelenting but eventually too straight, so he’s turned for a single. That’s it 
for the over. Handscomb shuts up shop again and punishes Pakistan with his 
patience.

86th over: Australia 355-3 (Renshaw 160, Handscomb 37)

The most nervous man in the arena right now is the aforementioned Hilton 
Cartwright who is sitting nervously by the door in the Australian dressing room 
as the minutes tick down towards 6pm local time. As he sweats on the last few 
overs, Renshaw works another single off Wahab, who is on to replace Imran and 
produces a tidy but unthreatening over.

85th over: Australia 353-3 (Renshaw 159, Handscomb 37)

Renshaw pushes a single to cover off the second ball of Amir’s over, and the 
non-striker’s end looks the safest bet right now. This partnership is now worth 
109 from 25 overs and Handscomb looks good to see things through until the end 
of the day.

84th over: Australia 352-3 (Renshaw 158, Handscomb 37)

Bang! Peter Handscomb is back into the action now, sweating on something loose 
from Imran Khan and getting it from the final delivery of the over, which he 
whips off his pads to send the shiny Kookaburra thudding into the fence. The 
danger is at the other end, for sure, but the Australians are finishing the day 
strongly.

83rd over: Australia 345-3 (Renshaw 155, Handscomb 33)

Oof. It hasn’t been his day today but Amir produces an absolute snorter to 
swing one past Renshaw’s outside edge. The batsman nods in approval; ‘I’ve been 
pretty damned good today,’ his look says, ‘but that was a beauty.’ He gets a 
single behind point but that’s the only damage. The Australian pair will be 
very content with their work if they survive this Amir spell and head to the 
showers unscathed.

Matt Renshaw passes 150!

82nd over: Australia 344-3 (Renshaw 154, Handscomb 33)

Imran Khan comes back now with the new ball and he’s being clapped in as Matt 
Renshaw approaches the 150 mark, which he does by helping a straight one to the 
rope at deep mid-wicket. Sydney is in love with him, and why not?

81st over: Australia 339-3 (Renshaw 149, Handscomb 33)

Mohammad Amir returns now with the new ball, which Pakistan have taken in 
order to try and force the issue late in the day. The removal of either of 
these batsmen would bring debutant Hilton Cartwright to the crease, and 
anything could happen at that point. It’s a decent start from Amir but 
Handscomb drives him for an emphatic boundary from the final delivery.

Yasir fares no better than Shafiq, creamed through point for a boundary and 
barely hanging on in the face of the late onslaught. The tourists are a bit of 
a rabble right now. Stumps can’t come quick enough.

79th over: Australia 328-3 (Renshaw 144, Handscomb 27)

Asad Shafiq is back with his off spin, so Misbah is clearly bricking it about 
the over rate and wants to whiz through a few quick ones. The Australians trade 
in singles and Renshaw gets four rolling his wrists over a handsome on drive. 
Spinners don’t bowl short overs if they’re being belted all over the place, 
Misbah.

78th over: Australia 319-3 (Renshaw 137, Handscomb 25)

Yasir has a slip and a silly point to Handscomb, but you’d forgive him a 
feeling of resignation in these last 12 overs or so, especially after the 
reversal of that lbw call. The SCG crowd is, unsurprisingly, loving it.

Not out! Renshaw survives!

Huge inside edge! Decision reversed! Yasir Shah is out of luck today.

REVIEW! Pakistan think Renshaw is out LBW to Yasir

And the Australian thinks he’s edged it. Or at least I hope he thinks that 
because it looks dead in front.

77th over: Australia 318-3 (Renshaw 137, Handscomb 24)

We do know that Matt Renshaw loves a big hundred. It’s not a large sample size 
to choose from but he’s already made a 170 in first-class ranks, so if he can 
survive until stumps this one could be a daddy hundred. Right as I say that 
Peter Handscomb re-emerges, pasting Wahab through cover for four of his own to 
move into the 20s. He’s never been out for fewer than 54 in Tests. Trouble for 
Pakistan.

76th over: Australia 310-3 (Renshaw 136, Handscomb 17)

Reverse sweep! Renshaw is tacking the Mickey now and switches his grip to belt 
Yasir for another four down to conventional third man. He’s auditioning for the 
Big Bash as well! Misbah reacts by bringing in a gully when the horse is 
bolted, so Renshaw does a bit of galloping of his own to get down the track and 
lift the spinner over long-off for four more. Party time at the SCG.
Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) 
Matt Renshaw now the perfect hybrid between Glenn Maxwell and Bill Lawry.

75th over: Australia 301-3 (Renshaw 127, Handscomb 17)

OK, now some belated short stuff at Renshaw, for whom Wahab introduces a leg 
slip. Never mind that, Wahab is through him with a length ball that is too 
tight to cut. Has the field change induced that error by planting the seed? 
Maybe. A few balls later Renshaw regains the upper hand, latching onto some 
width and hammering Wahab through gully for another boundary to bring up 300 
for his side. What a day it’s turned into for the four-Test rookie opener.

 73rd over: Australia 294-3 (Renshaw 122, Handscomb 15)

He’s been a little scratchy in the early stages of this knock but Peter 
Handscomb middles one to pick up his first boundary, driving square off the 
returning Wahab Riaz. And with that, we’ll take drinks.
 Matt Renshaw of Australia celebrates after reaching his century earlier.

A reprieve for Handscomb as Sarfraz misses a stumping

 72nd over: Australia 288-3 (Renshaw 121, Handscomb 10)

Oh dear. Yasir is out of luck again at the start of this over as Handscomb 
dances down the track at him, misses a drive but gets a reprieve when a 
near-motionless Sarfraz entirely misses the stumping chance as it turns towards 
slip. He didn’t even move his hands! A few balls later, owing to Sod’s law, 
Yasir is driven through cover for another Renshaw boundary and kicks the turf 
in frustration. That’s as angry as he ever gets, the poor spinner. Rotten luck. 
With that Yasir is beyond a century himself but not the kind you want.

 71st over: Australia 280-3 (Renshaw 116, Handscomb 9)

Wow. What the heck was that? Renshaw tries to whip Imran over cow corner and a 
thick outside edge almost plonks across the rope at third man. That came a few 
balls after Imran had dropped one short and been dispatched through point. 
Everything is falling into place for Matt Renshaw.

 70th over: Australia 272-3 (Renshaw 108, Handscomb 9)

Warnie has picked up on a thread of mine from earlier, though I doubt he’s 
been reading this or any other blog; why didn’t Amir and his mates try a few 
more bouncers at Renshaw? Chivalry? Anyway, Handscomb sweeps Yasir for one here 
and the spinner seems to have recovered from his fielding mishap of the over 
prior. Renshaw glides the final delivery – a wrong ‘un – down near the rope at 
third man to pick up three.

69th over: Australia 267-3 (Renshaw 104, Handscomb 8)

Oh dear. This is not what Pakistan need at this point. Yasir Shah has chased a 
ball to the boundary and in the process of sliding to make a save and throwing 
it back in to Sarfraz he’s done himself some kind of mischief. Back? Knee? 
Hammy? I’m not really sure, but his usual grin is replaced by a pained grimace, 
so it clearly isn’t much fun. Whatever it is he appears to have stayed on the 
field. Just the single no ball from Imran in this over. In Oprah giveaway 
terms, there’s almost been one for every member of the audience in this series.

Relieved at passing his milestone, Renshaw gets just a touch casual now 
turning Yasir to the leg side for a single, because the short leg almost came 
into play. With just over 90 minutes to play on day one the home side are on 
top.

67th over: Australia 262-3 (Renshaw 100, Handscomb 8)

Imran Khan comes back into the attack now and starts ingloriously, 
overstepping with a no ball first up. He’s no Robinson Crusoe on that one but 
blimey, it’s a bad way to begin a spell. The rest of it is decent enough and 
Handscomb sits back and waits for something he likes.

Matt Renshaw reaches a maiden Test century!

66th over: Australia 261-3 (Renshaw 100, Handscomb 8)

Renshaw reaches his hundred! There was two to start the Yasir over and with 
one needed for his milestone the lumbering lefty turns one around the corner 
and benefits from some smart running by Peter Handscomb at the danger end to 
get home. He’s done it! His maiden Test ton has come from 201 deliveries and 
has Australia well positioned on day one. It came in stark contrast to the 
blazing century of his opening partner David Warner but it’s exactly the kind 
of mature knock that could kickstart a productive international career. He’s 
done it his way and he’s done it beautifully. At 20 years of age he’s opened 
his account.

65th over: Australia 255-3 (Renshaw 97, Handscomb 5)

I was half-expecting a bouncer here to start with but Amir strays onto 
Renshaw’s hip to be turned for one. Handscomb handles the rest, defending 
cautiously and never looking particularly troubled by what he sees.

64th over: Australia 254-3 (Renshaw 96, Handscomb 5)

There are three men in the deep for Renshaw as he approaches his hundred, but 
the youngster isn’t really the type to hole out at this point. He pulls Yasir 
for a single to move within four of his milestone and the over finishes with 
Handscomb being beaten all ends up but a Yasir leg break, which fizzes past the 
outside edge.

63rd over: Australia 251-3 (Renshaw 95, Handscomb 3)

He was almost undone by Amir’s bounce and venom two overs back but now Renshaw 
turns two and then one to leg when the paceman is a little too straight. Better 
still is a drive from Peter Handscomb, who caresses the ball through cover to 
get two more of his own.

62nd over: Australia 246-3 (Renshaw 92, Handscomb 1)

Yasir continues to the new man Handscomb, who takes four balls to get off the 
mark with a single to mid-on. Renshaw has recovered well from his knock and 
turns a single out to deep mid-wicket to retain the strike.

Matt Renshaw struck on the helmet!

61st over: Australia 244-3 (Renshaw 91, Handscomb 0)

It’s a laugh a minute now as Nine show some vision outside the ground, where a 
fan is cocking her leg up over the SCG’s Steve Waugh statue, as though she’s 
going to ride him like a horse. Nowthere is an Instragram post. 

What is far less funny is a Mohammad Amir bouncer that crashes into the grille 
of Matt Renshaw’s helmet as he takes evasive action. That one really followed 
him. Nightmare stuff. Renshaw was fully committed to a front foot movement and 
that weight transfer did him in once it was time to swivel out the way. After 
the heavy blow to his protective equipment he’s seen to by team staff, 
including Dr Peter Brukner, and looks OK. That was a brute of a ball from Amir, 
who finishes the over with a slower yorker. Renshaw keeps it out and greets the 
bowler with a toothy grin. Superb.

60th over: Australia 244-3 (Renshaw 91, Handscomb 0)

Victorian Peter Handscomb is the new man in for Australia and he’s almost off 
the mark from a misfield at cover, but decides against the potential for the 
cardinal sin of being run out thus. Speaking of Michael Clarke, there’s a more 
enjoyably awkward moment replayed now; a mid-pitch meeting between Australian 
coach Darren Lehmann and Micky Arthur, the man he replaced. Apparently it 
happened before play and Clarke was on hand with his camera phone. There’s one 
for your Instagram account.

WICKET! Smith c Sarfraz b Yasir 24 (Australia 244-3)

He’s out! Steve Smith is out! I can’t quite believe it but I’ve just seen it 
with my own eyes. Yasir drags another one down short and Smith rocks back to 
play the cut, but it perhaps shoots through a little quicker because the shot 
is faulty and sends a thick edge behind to Sarfraz. Smart catch that, but a 
truly odd sight. The Australian skipper is gorn!

59th over: Australia 243-2 (Renshaw 90, Smith 24)

At least Amir is making things happen here. Smith drives through cover for two 
at the start of the over but he’s soon hopping about and gets rapped on the 
gloves by the left-armer. Clearly it didn’t tickle, because he’s got his glove 
off and grimaces in pain as he checks there are still five digits underneath 
it. Channel Nine, meanwhile, are replaying some highlights of Pakistan’s win in 
the 1995 SCG Test, and Michael Clarke delights in reeling off all the 
names...until the camera pans to Steve Randell. Fair call.

58th over: Australia 237-2 (Renshaw 89, Smith 19)

Yasir returns after the break but the results are much the same as Smith 
sweats on something loose and then pounces, hammering a boundary down the 
ground and working three around the corner. An over whose first four deliveries 
impressed ends up costing eight runs.

57th over: Australia 229-2 (Renshaw 88, Smith 12)

We’re back after tea on day one, and Mohammad Amir will have his first whirl 
since before lunch. Facing him is Matt Renshaw, whose first Test century is 
creeping up on us. Well, it’ll it come even faster than that if Amir gives him 
half-trackers like the one he pummels through point to move to 87 here. There’s 
also a single to fine leg but that presents an interesting replay; were it not 
for a fine inside edge onto the pad he actually would have been trapped in 
front. If he’s going to wander across his stumps like his captain, he’ll need 
to make solid contact with those ones.

Tea on day one - Australia in control so far

56th over: Australia 224-2 (Renshaw 83, Smith 12)

That is tea on day one in Sydney, a day so far dominated by Australia, whose 
captain Steve Smith finishes the session by stroking four through cover of 
Yasir. If Matt Renshaw does indeed make it to his maiden Test hundred today, it 
will have contrasted as dramatically as could be imagined with that of his 
opening partner David Warner, who reached his before lunch and departed 23 
overs ago. Renshaw will reach his after tea at his current rate. I’ll be taking 
you through all of it, but might just nick off for a Gatorade of my own. Back 
soon.

55th over: Australia 219-2 (Renshaw 82, Smith 8)

And now for something completely different, Asad Shafiq appears with some 
off-spin, which will either delight or horrify club trundlers watching at home. 
Scared stiff of getting out to it, Renshaw takes his time and has a look before 
paddling three around the corner to move into the 80s. We’ll have one more over 
before tea.

54th over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

He’s made for excellent journalistic fodder on this Australian trip, but I am 
still a little bummed out that Yasir hasn’t delivered the goods. He’s such a 
magnificent bowler when he’s on song. Right now he’s bowling them so badly 
Steve Smith is unprepared for the just how awful one long-hop is, so mis-times 
his cut. Injury is added to insult when Smith hammers a drive down the pitch 
and Yasir misses it with his hand, copping it flush on the shin instead. Ouch. 
His motley collection of deliveries end up a maiden, and I can’t even explain 
how that is so.

53rd over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

We’re ten minutes from tea as Wahab starts this over and Australia are in a 
commanding position if these two see it through until the break. As they 
attempt to do so, Sydney has darkened to the extant that the lights are brought 
into action. Wahab abandons his third delivery, perhaps suspecting it’s going 
to be another of his frequent no balls. It does the trick. Maiden.

52nd over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

“I can’t believe this guy has been number one bowler in the world just 
recently,” says Waqar Younis by way of introduction as Yasir Shah returns with 
one of the ropiest, filthiest half-trackers seen since the last time Steve 
Smith bowled. This time, unfortunately for Pakistan, Smithy is the batsman on 
strike and flogs to the fence at deep mid-wicket. The over doesn’t cost anymore 
but that one blow seems a little wounding for Yasir.

51st over: Australia 212-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 4)

Wahab comes, Wahab goes. Matt Renshaw cashes in this time, ruthlessly flicking 
four through mid-wicket from the opening delivery of the over when the bowler 
strays onto his pads. Wahab has forced both breakthroughs today but bowled some 
real dross otherwise.

slip and a short leg, but drops short to Steve Smith to be cut for two, and 
there are plenty of runs to be had elsewhere. I know Pakistan need to get 
through some quick overs but they’re doing themselves no favours gently playing 
Smith in like this.

49th over: Australia 204-2 (Renshaw 74, Smith 1)

The only problem here for Wahab and his colleagues is that the dismissal of 
Khawaja brings Steve Smith and his 60.64 Test average to the crease. He’s made 
runs for fun this summer and works one to square leg to get off the mark.

WICKET! Khawaja c Sarfraz b Wahab 13 (Australia 203-2)

Khawaja departs! And not for the first time this summer the left-hander falls 
to a lazy swipe outside off stump, feathering an inside edge behind against a 
ball that might have been left. A worrying trend? He’ll be kicking himself to 
have missed out on this track. Wahab does the job again!

48th over: Australia 203-1 (Renshaw 74, Khawaja 13)

The partnership between these two reaches 50 from 91 deliveries with a single 
to Khawaja, who has contributed only 13 to the stand as he feels his way into 
this innings. Azhar Ali’s part-time spin is looking about as dangerous as 
Michael Buble’s Christmas album.

47th over: Australia 200-1 (Renshaw 72, Khawaja 12)

Wahab nipped out Warner before and replaces Imran now with the hope of 
repeating the feat, but starts with huge no ball. Deary me. He still hasn’t got 
it right. Has he not set his bowling mark back half a pace? Anyway, Renshaw is 
72 from 152 deliveries now and none less than Bill Lawry, his left-hand opening 
forefather, says he really needs to cash in with a hundred today. It’s 
certainly there for the taking.

46th over: Australia 198-1 (Renshaw 72, Khawaja 11)

Azhar continues with his spin, pushing men into the deep and hoping to race 
through a few overs to get Pakistan’s rate up a little. Khawaja remains 
lethargic in his knock so far but works the ball around without trouble to move 
into double figures. A woeful misfield at cover by Sharjeel Khan hands Renshaw 
two bonus runs.

45th over: Australia 192-1 (Renshaw 69, Khawaja 8)

Matt Renshaw has slowed a little again after his post-lunch spree, but slices 
a couple of runs past gully by opening the face of his bat, which is coming 
down at an awkward but effective angle. Far better is full-blooded cover drive 
a few balls later, which the Queenslander just lathers through the gap to hit 
the ropes. He loves it, grinning like a schoolboy as he greets Khawaja in the 
middle of the pitch.

44th over: Australia 185-1 (Renshaw 62, Khawaja 8)

Some part-time spin now as Azhar Ali replaces Yasir with his leggies, which 
are far more handy than his Test bowling average suggests. David Warner has 
appeared by the sidelines as that happens and says he was using a brand new bat 
today. Hats off to Stuart Kranzbuhler, who makes them down at the Gray Nicolls 
factory at Mordialloc in Melbourne’s south. It’s clearly one of his better 
creations.

43rd over: Australia 182-1 (Renshaw 60, Khawaja 7)

Imran soldiers on after drinks and he’s pursuing a fourth or fifth stump line 
to Khawaja, who is perfectly content to leave them as they tail away towards 
the cordon. It’s building a decent amount of pressure at the opposite end to 
Yasir, but pressure is a relative concept when you’re 182-1 from 43 overs. It’s 
a maiden in the end.

42nd over: Australia 182-1 (Renshaw 60, Khawaja 7)

Yasir has a leg slip for Matt Renshaw but there’s not much doing for the 
spinner right now. Renshaw moves off strike with a single, paving the way for 
Khawaja to cream a full bunger through cover for three runs. The latter hasn’t 
started as smoothly as we’ve come to expect, but I’m sure he’ll work his way in 
soon enough. He also might want to work on his calling; some pessimism costs 
Renshaw a third to end the over. That’s drinks.

41st over: Australia 174-1 (Renshaw 55, Khawaja 4)

Imran continues to charge in energetically, and as he does so there’s a sort 
of intriguing discussion between the Michaels Clarke and Slater (hear me out) 
regarding the suitability or not of Matt Renshaw for the upcoming India tour. 
Clarke is #TeamRenshaw, and adds that Australia should perhaps take Shaun Marsh 
with them, but that the young Queenslander has done enough to get first dibs at 
the opening spot. I’d tend to agree.

40th over: Australia 171-1 (Renshaw 52, Khawaja 4)

Yasir bounds in to Khawaja but he’s again pursuing that leg stump line, which 
brings the short leg into play but few other fieldsmen out there have much to 
worry about. Khawaja has a chance to unfurl a cover drive from the final 
delivery but mis-times the stroke and it’s easy enough to cut off.

Shots fired!

The day in brief

Runs. Lots of them. Mostly to David Warner and Matt Renshaw. It was a frenetic 
start to the day as Warner raced to the first ever hundred before lunch by an 
Australian Test batsman playing on home soil. When he departed for 113 from 95 
deliveries, an entire nation groaned. He was simply astonishing in peeling off 
one of the most memorable of his 18 Test centuries.

When he departed Matt Renshaw hasn’t reached 40; now the Queensland youngster 
is 167 not out overnight having completed as impressive a maiden Testr hundred 
as you could hope for. The home side lost Warner, Usman Khawaja (13) and Steve 
Smith (24) – the latter pair to strange, avoidable dismissal – bot bossed it 
otherwise. They’re in a commanding position leading into day two.

Pakistan? Yasir tried and got belted for 1-132 from 30 overs. Wahab didn’t 
disgrace himself but two wickets were maybe more than he deserved, while Amir 
was luckless and never less than spirited. Which is all to say that it was a 
dirty day for the tourists. Things can only get better tomorrow, surely.
 
88th over: Australia 365-3 (Renshaw 167, Handscomb 40)

That is stumps on day one, a day of cricket which has belonged to David Warner 
and Matt Renshaw and their remarkably different but differently remarkable 
centuries. Warner unleashed his before lunch to make history, while the younger 
man walks off undefeated with 167 next to his name – the tortoise to his 
team-mate’s hare. And that is that for the day. Australia has dominated with 
the bat and Pakistan will now lick their wounds.
 
87th over: Australia 356-3 (Renshaw 161, Handscomb 37)

If Matt Renshaw is feeling any pressure late in the day he’s not showing it, 
though 160 runs in his kick no doubt helps. Amir’s line is tight and 
unrelenting but eventually too straight, so he’s turned for a single. That’s it 
for the over. Handscomb shuts up shop again and punishes Pakistan with his 
patience.
 
86th over: Australia 355-3 (Renshaw 160, Handscomb 37)

The most nervous man in the arena right now is the aforementioned Hilton 
Cartwright who is sitting nervously by the door in the Australian dressing room 
as the minutes tick down towards 6pm local time. As he sweats on the last few 
overs, Renshaw works another single off Wahab, who is on to replace Imran and 
produces a tidy but unthreatening over.
 
85th over: Australia 353-3 (Renshaw 159, Handscomb 37)

Renshaw pushes a single to cover off the second ball of Amir’s over, and the 
non-striker’s end looks the safest bet right now. This partnership is now worth 
109 from 25 overs and Handscomb looks good to see things through until the end 
of the day.
 
84th over: Australia 352-3 (Renshaw 158, Handscomb 37)

Bang! Peter Handscomb is back into the action now, sweating on something loose 
from Imran Khan and getting it from the final delivery of the over, which he 
whips off his pads to send the shiny Kookaburra thudding into the fence. The 
danger is at the other end, for sure, but the Australians are finishing the day 
strongly.

83rd over: Australia 345-3 (Renshaw 155, Handscomb 33)

Oof. It hasn’t been his day today but Amir produces an absolute snorter to 
swing one past Renshaw’s outside edge. The batsman nods in approval; ‘I’ve been 
pretty damned good today,’ his look says, ‘but that was a beauty.’ He gets a 
single behind point but that’s the only damage. The Australian pair will be 
very content with their work if they survive this Amir spell and head to the 
showers unscathed.
 
82nd over: Australia 344-3 (Renshaw 154, Handscomb 33)

Imran Khan comes back now with the new ball and he’s being clapped in as Matt 
Renshaw approaches the 150 mark, which he does by helping a straight one to the 
rope at deep mid-wicket. Sydney is in love with him, and why not?
 
81st over: Australia 339-3 (Renshaw 149, Handscomb 33)

Mohammad Amir returns now with the new ball, which Pakistan have taken in 
order to try and force the issue late in the day. The removal of either of 
these batsmen would bring debutant Hilton Cartwright to the crease, and 
anything could happen at that point. It’s a decent start from Amir but 
Handscomb drives him for an emphatic boundary from the final delivery.
 
80th over: Australia 335-3 (Renshaw 149, Handscomb 29)

Yasir fares no better than Shafiq, creamed through point for a boundary and 
barely hanging on in the face of the late onslaught. The tourists are a bit of 
a rabble right now. Stumps can’t come quick enough.

79th over: Australia 328-3 (Renshaw 144, Handscomb 27)

Asad Shafiq is back with his off spin, so Misbah is clearly bricking it about 
the over rate and wants to whiz through a few quick ones. The Australians trade 
in singles and Renshaw gets four rolling his wrists over a handsome on drive. 
Spinners don’t bowl short overs if they’re being belted all over the place, 
Misbah.
 
78th over: Australia 319-3 (Renshaw 137, Handscomb 25)

Yasir has a slip and a silly point to Handscomb, but you’d forgive him a 
feeling of resignation in these last 12 overs or so, especially after the 
reversal of that lbw call. The SCG crowd is, unsurprisingly, loving it.
 
Huge inside edge! Decision reversed! Yasir Shah is out of luck today.
 
And the Australian thinks he’s edged it. Or at least I hope he thinks that 
because it looks dead in front.
 
77th over: Australia 318-3 (Renshaw 137, Handscomb 24)

We do know that Matt Renshaw loves a big hundred. It’s not a large sample size 
to choose from but he’s already made a 170 in first-class ranks, so if he can 
survive until stumps this one could be a daddy hundred. Right as I say that 
Peter Handscomb re-emerges, pasting Wahab through cover for four of his own to 
move into the 20s. He’s never been out for fewer than 54 in Tests. Trouble for 
Pakistan.
 
76th over: Australia 310-3 (Renshaw 136, Handscomb 17)

Reverse sweep! Renshaw is tacking the Mickey now and switches his grip to belt 
Yasir for another four down to conventional third man. He’s auditioning for the 
Big Bash as well! Misbah reacts by bringing in a gully when the horse is 
bolted, so Renshaw does a bit of galloping of his own to get down the track and 
lift the spinner over long-off for four more. Party time at the SCG.

75th over: Australia 301-3 (Renshaw 127, Handscomb 17)

OK, now some belated short stuff at Renshaw, for whom Wahab introduces a leg 
slip. Never mind that, Wahab is through him with a length ball that is too 
tight to cut. Has the field change induced that error by planting the seed? 
Maybe. A few balls later Renshaw regains the upper hand, latching onto some 
width and hammering Wahab through gully for another boundary to bring up 300 
for his side. What a day it’s turned into for the four-Test rookie opener.
 
74th over: Australia 296-3 (Renshaw 122, Handscomb 17)

We’re back after drinks and Ian Chappell is sharing Alan Kippax late cut 
anecdotes on Channel Nine. Geez we’ll miss him when he’s gone. He’s been giving 
a cricket history masterclass today.
 
 73rd over: Australia 294-3 (Renshaw 122, Handscomb 15)

He’s been a little scratchy in the early stages of this knock but Peter 
Handscomb middles one to pick up his first boundary, driving square off the 
returning Wahab Riaz. And with that, we’ll take drinks.

 72nd over: Australia 288-3 (Renshaw 121, Handscomb 10)

Oh dear. Yasir is out of luck again at the start of this over as Handscomb 
dances down the track at him, misses a drive but gets a reprieve when a 
near-motionless Sarfraz entirely misses the stumping chance as it turns towards 
slip. He didn’t even move his hands! A few balls later, owing to Sod’s law, 
Yasir is driven through cover for another Renshaw boundary and kicks the turf 
in frustration. That’s as angry as he ever gets, the poor spinner. Rotten luck. 
With that Yasir is beyond a century himself but not the kind you want.
 
 71st over: Australia 280-3 (Renshaw 116, Handscomb 9)

Wow. What the heck was that? Renshaw tries to whip Imran over cow corner and a 
thick outside edge almost plonks across the rope at third man. That came a few 
balls after Imran had dropped one short and been dispatched through point. 
Everything is falling into place for Matt Renshaw.
 
 70th over: Australia 272-3 (Renshaw 108, Handscomb 9)

Warnie has picked up on a thread of mine from earlier, though I doubt he’s 
been reading this or any other blog; why didn’t Amir and his mates try a few 
more bouncers at Renshaw? Chivalry? Anyway, Handscomb sweeps Yasir for one here 
and the spinner seems to have recovered from his fielding mishap of the over 
prior. Renshaw glides the final delivery – a wrong ‘un – down near the rope at 
third man to pick up three.

show for his efforts. Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP  
69th over: Australia 267-3 (Renshaw 104, Handscomb 8)

Oh dear. This is not what Pakistan need at this point. Yasir Shah has chased a 
ball to the boundary and in the process of sliding to make a save and throwing 
it back in to Sarfraz he’s done himself some kind of mischief. Back? Knee? 
Hammy? I’m not really sure, but his usual grin is replaced by a pained grimace, 
so it clearly isn’t much fun. Whatever it is he appears to have stayed on the 
field. Just the single no ball from Imran in this over. In Oprah giveaway 
terms, there’s almost been one for every member of the audience in this series.
 
68th over: Australia 263-3 (Renshaw 101, Handscomb 8)

Relieved at passing his milestone, Renshaw gets just a touch casual now 
turning Yasir to the leg side for a single, because the short leg almost came 
into play. With just over 90 minutes to play on day one the home side are on 
top.

67th over: Australia 262-3 (Renshaw 100, Handscomb 8)

Imran Khan comes back into the attack now and starts ingloriously, 
overstepping with a no ball first up. He’s no Robinson Crusoe on that one but 
blimey, it’s a bad way to begin a spell. The rest of it is decent enough and 
Handscomb sits back and waits for something he likes.

66th over: Australia 261-3 (Renshaw 100, Handscomb 8)

Renshaw reaches his hundred! There was two to start the Yasir over and with 
one needed for his milestone the lumbering lefty turns one around the corner 
and benefits from some smart running by Peter Handscomb at the danger end to 
get home. He’s done it! His maiden Test ton has come from 201 deliveries and 
has Australia well positioned on day one. It came in stark contrast to the 
blazing century of his opening partner David Warner but it’s exactly the kind 
of mature knock that could kickstart a productive international career. He’s 
done it his way and he’s done it beautifully. At 20 years of age he’s opened 
his account.

I was half-expecting a bouncer here to start with but Amir strays onto 
Renshaw’s hip to be turned for one. Handscomb handles the rest, defending 
cautiously and never looking particularly troubled by what he sees.

64th over: Australia 254-3 (Renshaw 96, Handscomb 5)

There are three men in the deep for Renshaw as he approaches his hundred, but 
the youngster isn’t really the type to hole out at this point. He pulls Yasir 
for a single to move within four of his milestone and the over finishes with 
Handscomb being beaten all ends up but a Yasir leg break, which fizzes past the 
outside edge.
 
63rd over: Australia 251-3 (Renshaw 95, Handscomb 3)

He was almost undone by Amir’s bounce and venom two overs back but now Renshaw 
turns two and then one to leg when the paceman is a little too straight. Better 
still is a drive from Peter Handscomb, who caresses the ball through cover to 
get two more of his own.
 
62nd over: Australia 246-3 (Renshaw 92, Handscomb 1)

Yasir continues to the new man Handscomb, who takes four balls to get off the 
mark with a single to mid-on. Renshaw has recovered well from his knock and 
turns a single out to deep mid-wicket to retain the strike.

It’s a laugh a minute now as Nine show some vision outside the ground, where a 
fan is cocking her leg up over the SCG’s Steve Waugh statue, as though she’s 
going to ride him like a horse. Nowthere is an Instragram post. 

What is far less funny is a Mohammad Amir bouncer that crashes into the grille 
of Matt Renshaw’s helmet as he takes evasive action. That one really followed 
him. Nightmare stuff. Renshaw was fully committed to a front foot movement and 
that weight transfer did him in once it was time to swivel out the way. After 
the heavy blow to his protective equipment he’s seen to by team staff, 
including Dr Peter Brukner, and looks OK. That was a brute of a ball from Amir, 
who finishes the over with a slower yorker. Renshaw keeps it out and greets the 
bowler with a toothy grin. Superb.

60th over: Australia 244-3 (Renshaw 91, Handscomb 0)

Victorian Peter Handscomb is the new man in for Australia and he’s almost off 
the mark from a misfield at cover, but decides against the potential for the 
cardinal sin of being run out thus. Speaking of Michael Clarke, there’s a more 
enjoyably awkward moment replayed now; a mid-pitch meeting between Australian 
coach Darren Lehmann and Micky Arthur, the man he replaced. Apparently it 
happened before play and Clarke was on hand with his camera phone. There’s one 
for your Instagram account.
 
He’s out! Steve Smith is out! I can’t quite believe it but I’ve just seen it 
with my own eyes. Yasir drags another one down short and Smith rocks back to 
play the cut, but it perhaps shoots through a little quicker because the shot 
is faulty and sends a thick edge behind to Sarfraz. Smart catch that, but a 
truly odd sight. The Australian skipper is gorn!
 
59th over: Australia 243-2 (Renshaw 90, Smith 24)

At least Amir is making things happen here. Smith drives through cover for two 
at the start of the over but he’s soon hopping about and gets rapped on the 
gloves by the left-armer. Clearly it didn’t tickle, because he’s got his glove 
off and grimaces in pain as he checks there are still five digits underneath 
it. Channel Nine, meanwhile, are replaying some highlights of Pakistan’s win in 
the 1995 SCG Test, and Michael Clarke delights in reeling off all the 
names...until the camera pans to Steve Randell. Fair call.
 
58th over: Australia 237-2 (Renshaw 89, Smith 19)

Yasir returns after the break but the results are much the same as Smith 
sweats on something loose and then pounces, hammering a boundary down the 
ground and working three around the corner. An over whose first four deliveries 
impressed ends up costing eight runs.
 
57th over: Australia 229-2 (Renshaw 88, Smith 12)

We’re back after tea on day one, and Mohammad Amir will have his first whirl 
since before lunch. Facing him is Matt Renshaw, whose first Test century is 
creeping up on us. Well, it’ll it come even faster than that if Amir gives him 
half-trackers like the one he pummels through point to move to 87 here. There’s 
also a single to fine leg but that presents an interesting replay; were it not 
for a fine inside edge onto the pad he actually would have been trapped in 
front. If he’s going to wander across his stumps like his captain, he’ll need 
to make solid contact with those ones.

56th over: Australia 224-2 (Renshaw 83, Smith 12)

That is tea on day one in Sydney, a day so far dominated by Australia, whose 
captain Steve Smith finishes the session by stroking four through cover of 
Yasir. If Matt Renshaw does indeed make it to his maiden Test hundred today, it 
will have contrasted as dramatically as could be imagined with that of his 
opening partner David Warner, who reached his before lunch and departed 23 
overs ago. Renshaw will reach his after tea at his current rate. I’ll be taking 
you through all of it, but might just nick off for a Gatorade of my own. Back 
soon.
 
55th over: Australia 219-2 (Renshaw 82, Smith 8)

And now for something completely different, Asad Shafiq appears with some 
off-spin, which will either delight or horrify club trundlers watching at home. 
Scared stiff of getting out to it, Renshaw takes his time and has a look before 
paddling three around the corner to move into the 80s. We’ll have one more over 
before tea.
 
54th over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

He’s made for excellent journalistic fodder on this Australian trip, but I am 
still a little bummed out that Yasir hasn’t delivered the goods. He’s such a 
magnificent bowler when he’s on song. Right now he’s bowling them so badly 
Steve Smith is unprepared for the just how awful one long-hop is, so mis-times 
his cut. Injury is added to insult when Smith hammers a drive down the pitch 
and Yasir misses it with his hand, copping it flush on the shin instead. Ouch. 
His motley collection of deliveries end up a maiden, and I can’t even explain 
how that is so.
 
53rd over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

We’re ten minutes from tea as Wahab starts this over and Australia are in a 
commanding position if these two see it through until the break. As they 
attempt to do so, Sydney has darkened to the extant that the lights are brought 
into action. Wahab abandons his third delivery, perhaps suspecting it’s going 
to be another of his frequent no balls. It does the trick. Maiden.
 
52nd over: Australia 216-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 8)

“I can’t believe this guy has been number one bowler in the world just 
recently,” says Waqar Younis by way of introduction as Yasir Shah returns with 
one of the ropiest, filthiest half-trackers seen since the last time Steve 
Smith bowled. This time, unfortunately for Pakistan, Smithy is the batsman on 
strike and flogs to the fence at deep mid-wicket. The over doesn’t cost anymore 
but that one blow seems a little wounding for Yasir.
 
51st over: Australia 212-2 (Renshaw 79, Smith 4)

Wahab comes, Wahab goes. Matt Renshaw cashes in this time, ruthlessly flicking 
four through mid-wicket from the opening delivery of the over when the bowler 
strays onto his pads. Wahab has forced both breakthroughs today but bowled some 
real dross otherwise.

50th over: Australia 208-2 (Renshaw 75, Smith 4)

For reasons unknown to me, Azhar Ali continues in place of Yasir. He’s gota 
slip and a short leg, but drops short to Steve Smith to be cut for two, and 
there are plenty of runs to be had elsewhere. I know Pakistan need to get 
through some quick overs but they’re doing themselves no favours gently playing 
Smith in like this.
 
49th over: Australia 204-2 (Renshaw 74, Smith 1)

The only problem here for Wahab and his colleagues is that the dismissal of 
Khawaja brings Steve Smith and his 60.64 Test average to the crease. He’s made 
runs for fun this summer and works one to square leg to get off the mark.
 
Khawaja departs! And not for the first time this summer the left-hander falls 
to a lazy swipe outside off stump, feathering an inside edge behind against a 
ball that might have been left. A worrying trend? He’ll be kicking himself to 
have missed out on this track. Wahab does the job again!
 
48th over: Australia 203-1 (Renshaw 74, Khawaja 13)

The partnership between these two reaches 50 from 91 deliveries with a single 
to Khawaja, who has contributed only 13 to the stand as he feels his way into 
this innings. Azhar Ali’s part-time spin is looking about as dangerous as 
Michael Buble’s Christmas album.
 
47th over: Australia 200-1 (Renshaw 72, Khawaja 12)

Wahab nipped out Warner before and replaces Imran now with the hope of 
repeating the feat, but starts with huge no ball. Deary me. He still hasn’t got 
it right. Has he not set his bowling mark back half a pace? Anyway, Renshaw is 
72 from 152 deliveries now and none less than Bill Lawry, his left-hand opening 
forefather, says he really needs to cash in with a hundred today. It’s 
certainly there for the taking.

Kolbe/Getty Images  
46th over: Australia 198-1 (Renshaw 72, Khawaja 11)

Azhar continues with his spin, pushing men into the deep and hoping to race 
through a few overs to get Pakistan’s rate up a little. Khawaja remains 
lethargic in his knock so far but works the ball around without trouble to move 
into double figures. A woeful misfield at cover by Sharjeel Khan hands Renshaw 
two bonus runs.
 
45th over: Australia 192-1 (Renshaw 69, Khawaja 8)

Matt Renshaw has slowed a little again after his post-lunch spree, but slices 
a couple of runs past gully by opening the face of his bat, which is coming 
down at an awkward but effective angle. Far better is full-blooded cover drive 
a few balls later, which the Queenslander just lathers through the gap to hit 
the ropes. He loves it, grinning like a schoolboy as he greets Khawaja in the 
middle of the pitch.

44th over: Australia 185-1 (Renshaw 62, Khawaja 8)

Some part-time spin now as Azhar Ali replaces Yasir with his leggies, which 
are far more handy than his Test bowling average suggests. David Warner has 
appeared by the sidelines as that happens and says he was using a brand new bat 
today. Hats off to Stuart Kranzbuhler, who makes them down at the Gray Nicolls 
factory at Mordialloc in Melbourne’s south. It’s clearly one of his better 
creations.
 
43rd over: Australia 182-1 (Renshaw 60, Khawaja 7)

Imran soldiers on after drinks and he’s pursuing a fourth or fifth stump line 
to Khawaja, who is perfectly content to leave them as they tail away towards 
the cordon. It’s building a decent amount of pressure at the opposite end to 
Yasir, but pressure is a relative concept when you’re 182-1 from 43 overs. It’s 
a maiden in the end.
 
42nd over: Australia 182-1 (Renshaw 60, Khawaja 7)

Yasir has a leg slip for Matt Renshaw but there’s not much doing for the 
spinner right now. Renshaw moves off strike with a single, paving the way for 
Khawaja to cream a full bunger through cover for three runs. The latter hasn’t 
started as smoothly as we’ve come to expect, but I’m sure he’ll work his way in 
soon enough. He also might want to work on his calling; some pessimism costs 
Renshaw a third to end the over. That’s drinks.
 
41st over: Australia 174-1 (Renshaw 55, Khawaja 4)

Imran continues to charge in energetically, and as he does so there’s a sort 
of intriguing discussion between the Michaels Clarke and Slater (hear me out) 
regarding the suitability or not of Matt Renshaw for the upcoming India tour. 
Clarke is #TeamRenshaw, and adds that Australia should perhaps take Shaun Marsh 
with them, but that the young Queenslander has done enough to get first dibs at 
the opening spot. I’d tend to agree.

West/AFP/Getty Images  
40th over: Australia 171-1 (Renshaw 52, Khawaja 4)

Yasir bounds in to Khawaja but he’s again pursuing that leg stump line, which 
brings the short leg into play but few other fieldsmen out there have much to 
worry about. Khawaja has a chance to unfurl a cover drive from the final 
delivery but mis-times the stroke and it’s easy enough to cut off.

Shots fired!
