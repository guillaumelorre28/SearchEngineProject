The play was optioned by the Weinsteins shortly after its stage premiere. 
"I've loved the writing since I was given a 240-page script for a three-hour 
play that starred nobody, that had no workshop," said Weinstein at the time. 
"My reaction was similar to the feeling I had when I read Quentin Tarantino's 
script for True Romance. Tracy has that kind of voice."
