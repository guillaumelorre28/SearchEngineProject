Guardian Travel is producing a guide to South Africa’s big, bare and beautiful 
region, the Great Karoo – and we need your help to do it.

We’d like you to tell us about the best game reserves, festivals, museums and 
galleries, places to stay, villages, bars and cafes, the most interesting 
things to do and the insider tips you’ve picked up by travelling or even living 
and working in the region. Whatever it may be, we want to know all the details.

You can share your tips and photographs with us using GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/56e01211e4b0dda7467488e3>. We’ll 
also be looking forTwitter <http://www.twitter.com/guardiantravel> replies and 
the most interestingInstagram <https://instagram.com/guardiantravelsnaps/?hl=en>
 pictures you’ve taken or found – with the hashtag#GuardianKaroo.

The best will be published next week as part of the alternative South Africa 
series of guides.
