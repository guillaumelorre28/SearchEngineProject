Women can’t drive, and teaching them to do so will ruin your marriage. This is 
the premise of a show that aired across Australia last night, inspiring more 
despair in the hearts of TV enthusiasts than endless reruns of Seinfeld.


Where once they might have played a classic movie, these days free-to-air 
channels plug the holes in their midweek programming with one-off reality TV 
features orcompilations of cat videos from YouTube

.

This week’s offering from Seven was UK import Never Teach Your Wife to Drive, 
an hour-long filler-feature from 2014. Three heterosexual couples allow cameras 
to film them during their amateur driving lessons, and the results are 
precisely as condescending as you would expect.

“Usually they never argue,” the narrator says of 33-year-old Becky and her 
beefcake boyfriend Greg. Becky calls the roundabout a “merry-go-round”, which 
is mildly amusing if you like laughing at slightly sad linguistic ineptitude. 
But then Becky reveals she was in an horrific car accident as a teenager in 
which her boyfriend at the time was killed.

One immediately suspects a therapist would be better placed to intervene here 
than a camera crew.

On the other hand, Yasmin and John – a young couple with a newborn baby – seem 
quite well-adjusted until they get into the car with Yasmin in the driver’s 
seat. John gets frustrated quickly, puts Yasmin down every time she makes a 
mistake (which is often; his explanation of how to use a clutch leaves a lot to 
be desired), and then can’t understand why she gets genuinely upset.

Um why is there a show called Never Teach Your Wife to Drive on ch 7?! Will 
the follow up be Never Teach Your Husband Emotional Intelligence

Then there is Yaveli, the “hotheaded Latino wife” (no, I’m not making this 
up), whose husband Matt’s preferred description for her is “fiery”. It was 
about this point when your correspondent (an excellent driver, incidentally, 
who once stopped a car from rolling when the gearbox failed at 80km an hour) 
wrote in her notebook, “I hate everyone.”

It’s one thing for TV networks to import cheap filler while they’re pinching 
pennies at the tail end of the year, but it’s another to go right for the 
lowest common denominator. This is the kind of show you expect to find when 
you’re insomnia-surfing at 3am in the middle of the summer holidays, not in 
midweek prime time. If the golden age of television has taught us anything, 
surely it’s that ratings success absolutely does not require treating viewers 
like idiots?

As if to labour the point, Never Teach Your Wife to Drive treats its audience 
to endless footage of the couples squabbling as they bunnyhop around car parks, 
sideswipe bushes or accidentally reverse on to the kerb. At one point, Becky 
very gently drives into a row of bins, not even knocking over a single one. 
This is about as exciting as it gets – it’s the kind of stuff that was tedious 
when most of us did it for ourselves at the age of 16, but reaches a whole new 
level of banal when broadcast on national TV.

The producers clearly played the whole setup for LOLs, but nothing draws out 
the arbitrary nature of sexism like driving lessons with an intimate partner. 
Aside from the underlying presumption that men are naturally better at all 
things practical or fuel-driven, these “brave men” (that’s a direct quote) give 
terrible instructions and then harangue their partners for failing to follow 
them.

In what is perhaps the only flash of insight throughout the whole grindingly 
tedious hour, Matt explains that within his relationship with Yaveli, “there’s 
definitely a power struggle”. Well, quite.

In the final act, the couples’ lessons are observed by supposedly qualified 
driving instructors. They inevitably conclude that the women would fare better 
with professional instruction (you think?), while simultaneously praising the 
men for being #sobrave in taking on the task of teaching their partners 
themselves.

Never Teach Your Wife to Drive has the dubious distinction of not only being 
sexist and racist, but mindnumbingly boring at the same time. Cat video 
compilations never looked so good.
