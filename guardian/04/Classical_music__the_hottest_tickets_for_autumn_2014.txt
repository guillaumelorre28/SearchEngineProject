This astonishing Congolese orchestra 
<http://www.kinshasa-symphony.com/index.php?id=6>, formed in the crucible of 
one Africa’s most horrific conflicts, represents one of the great stories of 
hope, talent, hard work and musical joy flowering in the most devastating of 
situations. And above all, it’s testament to the vision of their conductor 
Armand Diangienda, to inspire his musicians to real heights of musical quality 
and intensity. To hear these players perform music including Beethoven’s Ninth 
Symphony in conjunction withthe Hallé in Manchester 
<http://www.halle.co.uk/concerts-tickets-event.aspx?Event_ID=10507&pPK=0cf3337e-88a8-4df2-a967-0d2b26daccde>

Beethoven Week


During the 2012-13 season, Andris Nelsons  <http://www.andrisnelsons.com> 
conducted all nine of Beethoven’s symphonies with the City of Birmingham 
Symphony. Afterwards he and his orchestra were invited to take their cycle to 
theBeethovenfest <http://www.beethovenfest.de> that’s held each year in Bonn, 
the city where the composer was born. That’s quite an honour for any British 
orchestra, and when they return from Germany they are repeating their 
performances for the audience in Symphony Hall - a chronological survey across 
four concerts in just six days.
Symphony Hall <http://www.thsh.co.uk]> Birmingham (0121-345 0600), 16 to 21

National Opera’s version launches its autumn season. Updated to the 1820s, the 
time of the opera’s composition, it’s directed by David Pountney and conducted 
by Carlo Rizzi, with David Kempster as the Swiss nationalist hero and Clive 
Bayley as Gesler, governor of the occupying Austrians.
