Egypt cruise into African quarter-finals Four-times champions Egypt cruised 
into the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup on Thursday, beating Zambia 
2-1 on a stiflingly hot afternoon as veteran striker Hossam Hassan made his 
first appearance at the tournament.

Egypt, who finished Group D with six points from three games, won with two 
remarkably similar goals from Ajax striker Ahmed Hossam in the first half and 
Hazam Imam in the second.

Midfielder Gift Kampamba pulled a goal back in the 77th minute but Zambia's 
first goal of the tournament was too late to prevent them being knocked out in 
the first round for the third tournament running. They went home with one point 
and just one goal to their credit.

Tunisia became the only African World Cup qualifier to go out of the African 
Nations Cup at the group stage thanks toSenegal

save. Their early exit without scoring a goal will hamper coach Henri Michel's 
preparation for this summer's finals.

Senegal go on to face Congo in the quarter-finals.
