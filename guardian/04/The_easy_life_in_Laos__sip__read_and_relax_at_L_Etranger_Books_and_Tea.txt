L’Etranger Books and Tea is a great little treehouse-style refuge from the 
heat of the day. The city’s first licensed bookshop, it was founded in 2001 by 
Québecois filmmaker Isabel Dréan and her partner Simon Côté, and has a lovely, 
laid-back vibe. You can buy books – or swap yours for theirs – and there are 
plenty to choose from. The shoes-off policy makes you feel at home as you tuck 
your feet up on the wicker sofa or chill out on the shaded terrace.

It’s a place where people lounge for hours – and as the sun sets, it becomes 
even more cosy, as the fairy lights come on and pretty star lampshades start to 
glow. At 7pm each night there’s a film screening – from Hollywood blockbusters 
to more indie treats – in a charming attic room lined with old copies of 
National Geographic.

L’Etranger’s ethos is ultimately a communal one, reminding you that feeling at 
“home” isn’t about geography.

Your reading can be accompanied by delicious local or western cuisine – highly 
Instagrammable teas (served in proper pots), salads and curries (the green 
curry is particularly tasty).
