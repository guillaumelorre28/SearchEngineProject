South East London Wargames Group <http://www.selwg.org/> (venue: Grove Park 
Youth Centre), my friends and I acquired a boxed set of Dungeons & Dragons from 
an American guest. I suspect we were the first people in the UK to play, so by 
the 80s this was old hat to us. But I recall the huge excitement and pleasure 
of our first campaign, which lasted nine months and almost certainly clipped a 
grade off each of my A-Levels!

• In the 40 years I spent working at the Foreign Office, I was often reminded 
of the old adage that a diplomat is an honest man sent abroad to lie for his 
country. It appears our new foreign secretary already has 50% of the attributes 
he will need in his new job and has been recognised for this by the French 
foreign minister (Liar, celebrity, joke: how other countries see Britain’s new 
foreign secretary

• Clive James (Weekend

, 16 July) writes that when Roger Federer “floats up on to his toes … there is 
no woman in the world who is not sighing”. Doesn’t he realise that many of us 
women save our sighs for the likes of Martina Navratilova?
