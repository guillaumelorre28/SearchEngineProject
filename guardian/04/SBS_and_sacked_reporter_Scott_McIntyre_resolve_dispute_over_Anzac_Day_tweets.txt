Asked who he was referring to, Bornstein accused the former communications 
minister and now prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, the News Corp columnist 
Chris Kenny and the former human rights commissioner Tim Wilson of seeking to 
“crush” free speech,Mumbrella reported

“These are people who speak loftily about freedom of speech and when it is 
inconvenient to them ditch it and try and crush someone whose views they 
disagree with,” he said. “They should be ashamed of themselves.”
