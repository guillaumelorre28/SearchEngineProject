The Australian population is expected to tick over to 24 million at 12.51am on 
Tuesday, with more than half of that growth driven by new migrants.

The milestone will see Australia draw level with the population of Shanghai, 
which houses 24 million people in a thousandth of the space.

It is also twice the size that Prof Tim Flannery, in a paper arguing for a 
much, much smaller Australia 
<http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.172.8690&rep=rep1&type=pdf>
, set as the upper limit of the country’s long-term carrying capacity.

That figure, between 8 million and 12 million, was passed in 1968. Flannery’s 
controversial goal population of just 6 million was reached some time in the 
1920s and is now equivalent to the population of Victoria.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics illustrates the growth in Australia’s 
population, starting with 5 million people in 1918 and going up to the present 
day.

The latest population figure is drawn from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
population clock

, which shows a projected rate of population growth based on 12-monthly 
population estimates.

It anticipates a population increase of one person every 91 seconds, based on 
known birth, death and migration rates.

Based on these rates Australia will reach a population of 25 million in 2018 
and 50 million in 2086. By then the global population will have reached 10.6 
billion, according toUN forecasts based on medium projected fertility rates

Beidar Cho, the ABS director of demography, said overseas migration counted 
for 54% of Australia’s growth in 2015, according to net migration figures drawn 
from passenger cards filled in at the country’s international airports.

That’s down from 2009, when overseas migration accounted for 66% of the 
population growth.

Cho said overseas migration overtook the birth rate as the main source of 
Australia’s population rate in 2006, two years after the former treasurer Peter 
Costellourged Australian parents to have

 “one for the father, one for the mother and one for the country”.

The fertility rate was unperturbed by Costello’s impassioned plea, showing 
only a marginal increase from 1.75 in 2004 to 1.8 in 2015. That’s lower than 
New Zealand and the United Kingdom and significantly lower than Indonesia, 
which matches the global fertility rate at 2.5, but ahead of Taiwan, Japan, 
China and Canada.
