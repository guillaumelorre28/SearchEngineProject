 Anti-terrorism officers yesterday raided the British offices of the radical 
Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun, seizing documents and computers.
Police also raided the homes of two of its leaders, Omar Bakri Muhammad, and 
Anjem Choudary.

Al-Muhajiroun <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-muhajiroun> has been linked 
to alleged attempts to recruit British Muslims to fight abroad.

Sources told the Guardian that the raid was looking for evidence of the 
group's support through its propaganda for terrorism, rather than any 
involvement in violence.

Scotland Yard said it had executed search warrants gained under the Terrorism 
Act 2000, and that no arrests had been made.

Detectives were expected to scour computer hard drives seized in the raid. 

Al-Muhajiroun was linked to two British suicide bombers behind an attack in 
Israel.

After the raid the group said: "Al-Muhajiroun ... are known not to involve 
themselves in military activities or recruiting people for operations."
