position ofexecutive personal assistant to Jermain Defoe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/24/jermain-defoe-personal-assistant-sunderland-stocking-fridge>

Defoe’s phone apps to watering his plants. In-between duties include planning 
all birthday parties, securing all travel arrangements, liaising with sponsors

• The client, a high-profile executive and US political figure, seeks an 
assistant whose skillset combines the disciplines of professional hairdressing 
and structural engineering. Your ability to produce consistent results using 
detailed specifications will be crucial, especially under adverse conditions 
that may include high winds, rain, extreme humidity, sudden decompression of 
jet cabin, baseball cap snatched off by immigrant etc.

• Future projects: the client is exploring the idea of having his hair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/jul/15/emergency-hair-advice-for-donald-trump>
 3D-printed each morning to save time, so knowledge of computers/Cad software a 
plus.

• Flexibility to travel at short notice, even internationally, a requirement. 
Absolute confidentiality a must. Self-loathing Hispanics welcome – I love you 
guys.

Part-time political researcher for Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>

• The successful candidate will require no PR training, secretarial skills or 
fashion sense. I deal with most of my correspondence personally, arrange my own 
itinerary and dress myself. Confidentiality is unnecessary, as are contacts in 
the private sector or the ability to source fundraising. Basically, your only 
duty would involve accompanying me to political meetings and Googling the 
political history of everyone else on the platform. Quick thumb-typing, ability 
to get my attention essential.

Personal secretary to Katie Hopkins

• Executive assistants, lifestyle managers, office coordinators and diary 
techniciansneed not apply. I just require a good old-fashioned secretary to 
sort through my hate mail, someone with a knack for composing correctly spelled 
tweets that still manage to piss people off.

• Remember that you will be working for the woman behind the “monster”, so be 
prepared to be surprised by a tough but fair-minded employer who is also 
thoughtful, polite, generous and fun to be with. No fatties, oldies,Charmaines

Administrative professional for Noel Biderman

• Avid Life Media, the parent company behind the Ashley Madison website 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ashley-madison>, is looking for an 
experienced administrator to assist CEO Noel Biderman and family on a variety 
of levels.

• You will be coming on board at a very exciting and challenging time for the 
company, eventually assisting in damage limitation, managing an increasingly 
demanding client roster and working as a PR liaison with the international 
media. For the present, however, your job will consist of shooing angry 
adulterers from the Biderman’s driveway. Security is of paramount importance to 
the business, as is the personal privacy and security of our clients and their 
information.

Poor timekeeping essential

Personal assistant to top model

• This is a 24/7 position for a professional assistant capable of organising 
my diary so as to ensure that I am never accidentally on time for anything. The 
successful applicant will be both competent and cool-headed, as well as someone 
who understands social media and knows they’re getting a slap if I even think 
they’ve been touching my perfume again. Don’t worry, it’s not Naomi Campbell, 
although once you sign the confidentiality agreement you can’t say anything 
even if it is.
