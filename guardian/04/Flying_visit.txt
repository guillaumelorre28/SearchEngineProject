Why now? 
For the Festival d'Avignon (festival-avignon .com 
<http://www.festival-avignon.com/>), the French equivalent of Edinburgh, which 
runs until July 27. There's theatre, dance, music, opera, a lively fringe and a 
great festive buzz.

Getting there 
Trains to Avignon from Waterloo via Paris with Rail Europe (08708 304862, 
raileurope.co.uk <http://www.raileurope.co.uk>). 

Where to stay 
The lovely (but pricey) Le Prieure, just across the Rhone in 
Villeneuve-lès-Avignon (leprieure.com <http://www.leprieure.com>, from €140) 
still has rooms. The tourist office (vignon-tourisme.com 
<http://www.avignon-tourisme.com>) is also helpful and there are four campsites 
- the Auberge Bagatelle (campingbagatelle.com <http://www.campingbagatelle.com>
) also has dorm beds.

Where to eat 
Arts et Gourmets (0033 4 9086 8187, artetgourmets.com 
<http://www.artetgourmets.com>) in the place de la Principale is part gallery, 
part restaurant.

What to buy 
Fill up a basket with olives, goats cheese, freshly baked fougasse and pastis 
at Les Halles food market, then head up to Rocher des Doms for a picnic 
overlooking the Rhône.
