Earlier this year Andrew Bird released Break It Yourself to rave reviews, 
especially in the UK. In herGuardian review, Maddy Costa 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/01/andrew-bird-break-yourself-review> 
awarded it five stars, saying: "It's the perfect album: tender without being 
sentimental, experimental yet accessible, utterly unique to its maker."

As a result, fans in the know are more than a little excited about the 
follow-up, Hands of Glory, which serves as a companion piece to that record. 
Ghostly folk music, country covers (the Carter Family and the Handsome Family 
are both paid tribute to) and even the occasional bit of Arcade Fire-esque 
bombast â€¦ at times it's hard to believe Bird's seventh album was recorded in a 
barn with his band all crowded around a solitary microphone.

So how do you think it compares to Break It Yourself? Have a listen above and 
let us know your thoughts.
