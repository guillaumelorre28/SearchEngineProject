Egyptian <https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> state television has said 
it had sacked its head of news after an old interview with President Abdel 
Fatah al-Sisi was screened in error.

Sisi, who has been in New York for the UN 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> general assembly, was 
interviewed by US network PBS, as he had been last year. State-run Channel 1 
aired the interview from 2015.

The transmission was cut when staff realised the error.

Mostafa Shehata confirmed he had been sacked and told AFP it was illogical as 
others had also been involved in the broadcast but put it down to fate.

The blunder drew criticism from pro-Sisi private channels, which have devoted 
extensive coverage to the presidentâ€™s visit to New York.
