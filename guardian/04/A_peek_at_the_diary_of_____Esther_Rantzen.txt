As I told its good burghers at a hastily convened personal appearance, I've 
rather fallen in love with Luton South. I spent last weekend there, kissing 
babies shaped like vegetables and asking the natives to put into words how much 
they loved me.

I am aware the last thing British democracy needs right now is faux-humble 
egos bowdlerising the debate, so I asked them: "Would you rather have a local 
person with local achievements or a funny old lady who has been around in your 
lives?" I didn't hear one person suggesting I shouldn't stand as MP.

One of my rather green lackeys - I do miss Adrian Mills - suggested that was 
because all those who think has-been celebrities aren't the answer to this 
crisis were sitting in darkened rooms, rocking back and forth at news that I 
planned to stand. Made a mental note to excommunicate him when I sweep to power.

Frankly, this feels the natural next step. I've Done Strictly; I've learned 
French with Ron Atkinson. I've worn a basque and fishnets in the Daily Mail, 
and I've been to the jungle for I'm A Celebrity ... In a way, that was the 
formative experience as far as my political ambitions go, because the public 
really took to me. I was fifth to be voted out - a full day after Timmy 
Mallett. Which suggests to me I've not only got some sticking power, but that 
there is a corner of every British heart that is for ever Esther's. "Right

admiringly. "Why, you've never been anything else!"
