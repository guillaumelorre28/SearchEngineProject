Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman has won the award for 'Best factual 
newspaper or magazine article about older people's issues' at theOlder People 
in the Media Awards 2013 
<http://www.independentage.org/news-media/media-awards/about-the-media-awards/>.

Amelia won the award with her magazine piece on Gloria Foster - the 
81-year-old woman who was left to starve for 9 days when the company 
responsible for her care was shut down,When Elderly Care Goes Wrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/29/when-elderly-care-goes-wrong>. 
The judges said it was "very hard hitting and covers a really important issue 
which draws out wider implications."

Amelia said: "Gloria Foster was 81 when she died. She was being cared for by a 
private care company which was closed down, and she was forgotten about. She 
was left starving for nine days, and later died in hospital. This was an 
incredibly sad piece to report on. It would be amazing if this award keeps 
attention on the many failings that led up to her death, and helps prevent such 
a tragic situation from ever happening again."
