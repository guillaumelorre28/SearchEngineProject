The illustrator and graphic novelist Dave Gibbons – whose artwork has featured 
in the bestselling series Watchmen, as well as 2000 AD – has been appointed the 
UK’s first comics laureate.

His appointment to the new role, for a two-year stint, will see him 
championing children’s literacy through schools, teacher-training events and 
education conferences.

The 65-year-old has been given the role, which he will take up in February, by 
the charityComics Literary Awareness (CLAw) <http://www.claw.org.uk/>.

He said: “It’s a great honour for me to be nominated as the first comics 
laureate. I intend to do all that I can to promote the acceptance of comics in 
schools. It’s vitally important, not only for the pupils but for the industry 
too.”

 Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen, which was later made into a film. 
Gibbons has illustrated characters for Marvel and DC Comics during his art 
career, including Batman, Superman and Green Lantern. He began in underground 
comics after leaving his job as a building surveyor and then working as one of 
the regular artists in 2000 AD’s early days.

He went on to work on Doctor Who 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> and in the late 1980s was 
lauded for his work with the writer Alan Moore on the Watchmen series, which 
went on to become a 2009 movie.

His new appointment was announced at the Lakes international comic art 
festival, which is being held in Kendal, Cumbria, this weekend.

The charity aims to improve literacy levels and promote the variety and 
quality of comics, particularly in the education sector.
