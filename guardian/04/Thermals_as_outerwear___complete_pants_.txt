We on the fashion desk know how controversial tights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/19/fashion-black-tights-women-fashtag>
 can be. But those who feel the cold easily can take heart. Black tights may 
not have the fashion nod this winter, but thermals most certainly do. Think of 
it as the latest underwear-as-outerwear trend: thermals – those things usually 
hidden under clothes in subzero conditions – are now OK to wear solo.

While this is a unisex trend – everyone wears thermals, don’t they? – some of 
the idea comes fromDavid Beckham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-beckham>. In the campaign for his 
latest H&M collaboration, he has been snapped in a vest and thermal leggings, 
or long johns. If anyone can get the male population of the UK in a similar 
look, it’s Becks.

And, of course, Kanye West – someone who Asos cites as a key influence on its 
under-25-year-old malecustomer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/29/from-kanye-west-to-the-x-factor-the-rise-of-the-longline-sweater>
. For his autumn collection forYeezy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/16/kanye-west-new-york-fashion-week-yeezy>
, his army of mini-mes wore an appropriately military uniform of bomber 
jackets, hoodies and Yeezy Boost futuristic trainers, with male models in 
thermal-like leggings and women in the kind of super-stretchy nude-coloured 
tights that would be approved of by West’s wife, Kim Kardashian. West is no 
stranger to the long john look, wearing what appeared to be leather leggings on 
stage with a Givenchy sweatshirt in2012

.

As this is the kind of clothing that has practical uses, getting the look on 
the cheap is easy. TheAmerican Apparel waffle tops

 about them) but it’s the bottom half that really shows fashion mettle. Go for 
Beckham’s thermals atH&M <http://www.hm.com/gb/product/31960?article=31960-A>, 
or Uniqlo’s cult choice Heat Techlong johns 
<http://www.uniqlo.com/uk/store/goods/078003>. Rather than looking like you 
have forgotten to add your trousers, try the Kanye-approved look of longline 
sweatshirt and bulky boots, with your thermals bunched a bit around the top for 
that Mad Max warrior chic.

While there’s bound to be a bit of ribbing around this trend, it’s not as out 
there as, say, men inculottes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/oct/19/culottes-for-men-would-you-wear-them-down-the-pub>
. In a way, you could argue that this is the logical conclusion to men in 
skinny jeans. Is there that much difference between super-tight denim and a 
waffle-effect long john? There’s only one way to find out.
