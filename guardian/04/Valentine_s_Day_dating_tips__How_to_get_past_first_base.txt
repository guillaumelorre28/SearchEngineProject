What am I doing wrong?

From Ian, aged 40

Dear Carole, I am a fan of your column and have applied your guidance to my 
search for a suitable mate. My profile on a certain online dating site has been 
written to emphasise my evolutionary advantages (height, intelligence, 
employment status, alpha-male potential, physical fitness and social skills) 
and has proved to be successful at attracting attention from females of 
breeding age and, after carefully sifting out unsuitable candidates, converting 
that attention into a first date. For this I owe you a small debt of thanks, 
but here is where my problems start.

Despite choosing neutral locations with convivial atmospheres and ensuring I 
am well groomed, I have been unable to secure a second date from the dozen or 
so women I have met. None of these women is impolite enough to give me a proper 
reason for not wanting to meet again, preferring to use the excuse that some 
sort of vibe or chemistry is missing.

I have considered that my profile might be overselling my good points, so I 
have ensured the photos are recent and that the text accurately portrays me, my 
sense of humour and values. I am happy that what my potential mates see on 
paper is what they get when I walk though the door.

What am I doing wrong? Is it the choice of venue? What do women expect on a 
first date and what is the optimum strategy for getting a second date?

Carole replies:
Glad the advice has worked thus far. Now to get you to the next stage.

You say women give you the excuse that the "chemistry" isn't quite right, 
rather than a "proper reason". I think you should consider the possibility they 
might be telling you the truth. Chemosensory communication is crucial in 
primates. The chemical balance of axillary odour (otherwise known as BO) is 
governed by various factors including health and stress, and your pheromones 
give your potential mate unique information about your genotype, your immune 
system, parasitic infection and even body symmetry, among other things.

Women outperform males on olfactory tests and at a primal level make 
judgements based on how others smell. The major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) is a series of genes involved in immunity. Research suggests females can 
detect MHC type in sweat and for mating purposes seek out males with an immune 
system that is different from their own, thus ensuring the resulting progeny 
have strong immune systems.

In addition, just the right amount of androstadienone – a compound found in 
testosterone – in axillary odour can cause sexual arousal in females. But you 
can have too much of a good thing. High levels of testosterone in a male can 
cause various deficits such as mental retardation and aggressive behaviour.

So, when a female tells you the chemistry isn't quite right she may mean 
exactly that.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that you are entirely free of parasites 
and that the chemistry between you and your prospective mate is perfect. With 
the romance of StValentine's Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/valentines-day> upon us let's 
continue refining your mating strategy ...

I'm hoping you dress in smart casual clothes that flatter you and give you an 
appearance of having stamina and being fit, active and healthy, and capable in 
a sudden emergency – females favour males who pull their weight in a crisis.

Novel locations

Imaginative intelligence is a sexually selected trait, so show yours off and 
come up with novel locations and activities for your date rather than meeting 
in a generic wine bar, restaurant or cafe.

For thrills take your date to Alton Towers, or a dry ski slope followed by 
après ski. For something more sedate you could visit a country house and 
gardens followed by afternoon tea. A trip to the zoo might get her in the mood.

But whatever you do, be an original person who likes to have fun.

Avoid egocentric behaviour on your date. In other words don't do all the 
talking and don't brag. Self-aware psycholinguistic heuristic strategies, such 
as self-deprecation, are sexually selected indicators of intelligence. Put 
another way, females tend to appreciate subtlety in conversation.

Make sure you listen to what your date has to say and be interested in her. In 
general, women talk more than men and they like to feel understood, so try to 
engage with your date's personality.

Most women enjoy emotional intimacy with their female friends and bond more 
intensively. Some attempt to find a similar depth of emotional intimacy with 
the men they date but this cannot always be achieved. Disappointment over this 
issue frequently causes relationships to break own.

So try to make your potential mate feel that she is special, rather than just 
another in a long line of dates. But don't show so much interest in the factual 
details of her life that you become predatory – don't interview her.

Don't objectify her

Similarly, don't gaze at her as though she is a body to have sexual 
intercourse with. Don't objectify her. Try to avoid making comments about her 
physical appearance, even complimentary ones (you have seen her photo so she 
knows you like the way she looks). If she agrees to see you again you can then 
begin the compliments and continue with them ad infinitum.

Male baboons who want sex offer themselves as babysitters/protectors to the 
infants of females they are attracted to. You could try something similar, for 
example if you have nieces or nephews casually let photos of them fall out of 
your wallet, communicating that you are a male who is good fatherhood material.

Male chimps sometimes give meat or fruit to females they wish to mate with, 
known as "provisioning". So if you see an opportunity to spontaneously 
provision your date, do so, whether it's an ice cream, candyfloss or a bag of 
nuts.

Females are usually highly observant so you don't need to be ostentatious 
about your resources. But it is important to be generous with your time, your 
humour and your money – be someone with lots to give who enjoys sharing. So if 
you see a dog while in the company of your date make sure you pat it, if you 
see birds that can be fed, buy a bun and feed them, if there's a charity box 
handy shove money in it. Females have a preference for spontaneous altruism in 
males.

Don't let the first date drag on too long. End on a high note, leaving your 
prospective mate wanting more of the same so she emails you for a repeat 
performance.

But don't forget, research shows females are adept at discerning between 
genuine behaviour and insincerity. So, Ian, all you have to do now is make 
these behavioural strategies real.
