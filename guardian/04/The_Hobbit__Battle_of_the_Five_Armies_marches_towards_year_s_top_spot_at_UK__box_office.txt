The winner

Dropping an OK 45% in its second frame, final Hobbit film Battle of the Five 
Armies stands at a healthy £20.35m after 10 days of play. That’s just ahead of
Desolation of Smaug 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/hobbit-desolation-of-smaug-review>
, which had reached £20.04m at the same stage of its run. Smaug went on to 
experience an exceptionally strong third session (going up 2% from the second 
weekend), so the pressure is now on for Five Armies to manage a similar feat 
this coming weekend.

Five Armies is only the fourth film this year to crack £20m after two 
weekends’ play. The others are The Lego Movie,The Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-2> and The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay Part 1. As you can see from the top 25 chart below, which lists the 
biggest-grossing films of 2014, these previous titles occupy three of the top 
four places. By the time it has run its course at UK cinemas, it’s reasonable 
to expect Five Armies will be the top hit of the year, based on the performance 
of the previous Hobbit movies.

The runner-up

Dropping just 14%, Paddington has delivered another strong session at the UK 
box office, and now stands at £18.12m. With kids on holiday for Christmas,
Paddington <https://www.theguardian.com/film/paddington> and other family films 
should continue to play robustly – and not just at weekends.

Paddington was able to resist the challenge of the PG-rated Night at the 
Museum: Secret of the Tomb, which landed in third place with £1.85m. That 
number compares very disappointingly with predecessorNight at the Museum 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/22/review-night-at-the-museum-2>, 
which debuted in May 2009 with £4.16m, including £883,000 in previews. The 
originalNight at the Museum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/dec/22/actionandadventure.comedy> kicked 
off in December 2006 with £7.69m, including £3.70m in previews. Both films 
ended up in a similar place – between £20m and £21m – and Fox now has its work 
cut out to get the third instalment to that level. Such an outcome looks 
distinctly unlikely.

Annie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/16/annie-review-pink-sparkly-radioactive-waste>
, which was originally set to arrive in cinemas on Boxing Day, in fact started 
playing on Saturday – presumably to diminish the impact of the online leak of 
the film. It is technically in previews, so its takings have not been included 
in official reports, and will all be added next time.

The late surge

Only one film in the top 10 saw a rise in takings from the previous frame, and 
that was Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey?! Box office rose 16%, for a total 
to date of £6.37m. At the same stage, the weekend before Christmas, predecessor
Danger in the Manger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/22/nativity-2-danger-manger-review> 
had reached £7.37m.

It’s not unusual to see Christmas-themed films rise in box office as the 
holiday approaches. However, Get Santa failed to match the Nativity 
performance, dropping 19%. Both titles are likely to see audiences dwindling 
rapidly after Boxing Day.

Admissions update

Admissions figures for November – measuring the number of tickets sold rather 
than box office value – are now in, and they show a dip on the same month in 
2013. Overall for the first 11 months of the year, admissions are trailing 2013 
levels by 6%. Cinemas would need to sell 25m tickets in December – roughly 
double what they sold in November – to make up the shortfall on 2013 and end 
the year level. That won’t happen.

The year hasn’t been plagued by huge money-losing flops – no John Carter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/20/john-carter-lose-disney-200m>, 
for example – but it has lacked the occasional giant hit that can really help 
the overall picture. In 2012,Skyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/23/skyfall-highest-grossing-film-uk-box-office>
 grossed more than £100m, while the same year saw Marvel’sAvengers Assemble 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/avengers-assemble-review> with 
£52m andThe Dark Knight Rises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/19/the-dark-knight-rises-review> 
with £56m. So far, no 2014 release has cracked even £35m (see chart below), 
although that picture should change when Five Armies completes its run.

If Five Armies falls short of £40m, that would make 2014 the first year with 
no £40m-plus hit since 1998. The Desolation of Smaug managed £42.92m, so Five 
Armies will need to pretty much match the pace of its predecessor to ensure 
this doesn’t happen.

The future

Despite the decent holds for Five Armies and Paddington, grosses were overall 
14% down on the equivalent frame from 2013, when The Desolation of Smaug 
performed robustly,Frozen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen> delivered 
another exceptional result andAnchorman 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anchorman-2-the-legend-continues> achieved a 
nice opening. Cinema owners are now pinning their hopes on the final frame of 
2014, which will see the official opening of Annie, plus Ridley Scott’sExodus: 
Gods and Kings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/29/exodus-gods-and-kings-review-christian-bale-ridley-scott>
, Tim Burton’sBig Eyes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/big-eyes-film-review-tim-burton-art-60s-kitsch-waif-paintings>
 and Angelina Jolie’sUnbroken <https://www.theguardian.com/film/unbroken>. 
Whatever happens in the final weekend, 2014 will go down as a year that most 
distributors and exhibitors will want to forget.
