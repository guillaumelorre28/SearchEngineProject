FT: Congo 2-4 DR Congo

So, DR Congo rally spectacularly against their neighbours, and progress, 
deservedly in the end, to the semi-finals.

That’s about it from me. Don’t forget to join Nick Miller for Chelsea v Man 
City

, which is well underway. Thanks for reading.Bye!

GOAL! Congo 2-4 DR Congo (Mbokani)

A second goal for Mbokani, a fourth for DR Congo, and that’s the game. Not a 
bad second half, this.

An awful waste from Yannick Bolasie, who has two team-mates wide open 
alongside him in a counter attack, but scuffs a low shot into the goalkeeper’s 
arms. That would have been that.

Just over five minutes of normal time for Congo to find an equaliser. Their 
defence may have crumbled spectacularly, but they’ve continued to cause 
problems going forward. The winner will play either Ivory Coast or Algeria in 
the semi-finals, by the way.

And there it is. DR Congo have attacked relentlessly since going 2-0 down, and 
now they’re level. It’s Bokila with the goal, smashing the ball into the roof

So, DR Congo rally spectacularly against their neighbours, and progress, 
deservedly in the end, to the semi-finals.

That’s about it from me. Don’t forget to join Nick Miller for Chelsea v Man 
City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jan/31/chelsea-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live>
, which is well underway. Thanks for reading.Bye!
 
A second goal for Mbokani, a fourth for DR Congo, and that’s the game. Not a 
bad second half, this.
 
An awful waste from Yannick Bolasie, who has two team-mates wide open 
alongside him in a counter attack, but scuffs a low shot into the goalkeeper’s 
arms. That would have been that.
 
Just over five minutes of normal time for Congo to find an equaliser. Their 
defence may have crumbled spectacularly, but they’ve continued to cause 
problems going forward. The winner will play either Ivory Coast or Algeria in 
the semi-finals, by the way.
 
The comeback is complete. Substitute Kimuaki flicks the ball in from a set 
piece, and from 2-0 down, DR Congo lead!
 
And there it is. DR Congo have attacked relentlessly since going 2-0 down, and 
now they’re level. It’s Bokila with the goal, smashing the ball into the roof 
of the net at the second attempt.
 
Match reports ahoy

Why not catch up on today’s top-flight games while we await DRC’s inevitable 
equaliser? The match reports from all six 3pm games are in...

A quick results round-up: it finished Dundee United 2-1 Aberdeen in the 
Scottish League Cup semi-final,Marseille 1-0 Evian in Ligue 1, and Sheffield 
Utd 2-0 Swindonin, well, League 1.

And here’s the last word on Jon Walters:
 
DR Congo pour forward, and from Bolasie’s low cross, Mbokani scores! This game 
has exploded into life...
 
Thiévy Bifouma, once of West Brom, tucks away a rebound after DR Congo’s 
defence gets in a muddle. Moments ago, DR Congo hit the bar from a free kick, 
but it looks like their neighbours will progress to the semi-finals...
 
All happening in the Congo derby now, as DRC’s Yannick Bolasie goes down in 
the box – but no penalty is given! And that’s not to mention the scenes in the 
stands...
 
A breakthrough in Bata – and it’s the underdogs who lead! DRC fall asleep from 
a free-kick, and Ferebory Dore is on hand to flick the ball home.
