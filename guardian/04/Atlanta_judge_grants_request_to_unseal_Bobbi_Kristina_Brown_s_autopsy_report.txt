A judge in Atlanta has granted a news media request to unseal the autopsy 
report forBobbi Kristina Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/06/bobbi-kristina-brown-whitney-houston>
.

The 22-year-old daughter of singer Whitney Houston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/whitney-houston> was found face-down and 
unresponsive in a bathtub in her suburban Atlanta town home on 31 January 2015, 
and died in hospice care on 26 July.


 Local news media reported that Fulton County superior court judge Henry 
Newkirk on Thursday granted a motion filed by media organizations.

WXIA-TV reports the judge will probably sign an unsealing order in the coming 
days. The state is appealing.

Media lawyers argued the September sealing order violated the state and 
federal constitutions and court rules, because it was entered without public 
notice and without an opportunity for a hearing. The state argued the law 
exempts records sealed by court order.
