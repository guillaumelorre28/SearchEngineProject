Hara made six films for Ozu, including the widely acknowledged masterwork 
Tokyo Story in 1953, in which she played a grieving widow who befriends the 
parents of her dead husband, after they are ignored by their surviving children.
In a blog posted to mark her 90th birthday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/jun/16/setsuko-hara-birthday-tokyo-story>
, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw described her performance in Tokyo Story 
as “absolutely captivating … I defy anyone to watch this film and not feel 
simply overwhelmed with a kind of love for Hara”.

Hara’s first film with Ozu was Late Spring, in 1949, in which she played an 
unmarried daughter whose father plays a trick on her to ensure she gets 
married, but she had been working as an actor since 1935, when she made her 
debut at 15 in a studio film for Nikkatsu Corporation.

Hara was born Masae Aida in Yokohama in 1920. A family connection through her 
brother-in-law, the film director Hisatora Kumagai, led to a contract with 
Nikkatsu. She made numerous films in the prewar and wartime Japanese film 
industry, including the German-Japanese co-production Daughter of the Samurai, 
shot in 1936 with Nazi propagandist Arnold Fanck as co-director and intended to 
boost relations between the two countries.

After the war, Hara became a key face in Japan’s cinematic revival, and was 
cast in a lead role in Akira Kurosawa’s No Regrets for Our Youth (1946) and 
Kōzaburō Yoshimura’s A Ball at the Anjo House (1947), both of which lamented 
the priceJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> paid for its prewar 
militarism. In addition to the series of finely observed dramas she made with 
Ozu in the 50s, she played the female lead in Kurosawa’s adaptation of 
Dostoevsky’s The Idiot in 1951, and her final role, in the samurai epic 
Chūshingura, directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, in 1962.

Hara then retired from acting at 42, and had little contact with the media 
thereafter.
