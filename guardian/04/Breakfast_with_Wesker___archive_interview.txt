The real tragedy of the English theatre is that it means nothing to most 
people, for all attempts so far to establish a truly people’s theatre in 
England have failed. Occasionally a company will try to get through to the 
theatreless millions –Theatre <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> 
Workshop is a notable example – but there has not been any real breakthrough. 
The theatre is not yet a real part of English life.


Arnold Wesker <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/wesker>, who has to his 
credit the most solid achievements of the younger dramatists, thinks the trade 
unions and the Labour party are at least partly to blame. With their unique 
contacts, they could have organised the breakthrough. Wesker wonders if it is 
too late to persuade them to do it. He is going to try by appealing to all the 
unions to help to put on plays, to build theatres and produce films, but above 
all to help artists to make contact with people who have so far been out of 
reach.

A cynic would say that it was a waste of time even to try, that nobody will 
listen. Wesker, an eloquent and friendly man, is no cynic – he is far too 
lively for that – and he hopes that when his trilogy is performed at the Royal 
Court in London, perhaps in May, it will give him enough prestige to persuade 
somebody to listen: perhaps only one union secretary, but he would be a start.

Wesker obviously feels deeply the theatre’s comparative isolation because it 
means so little in the lives of many of the people with whom he has so far 
spent his life. He was born in 1932 in the East End of London and has worked as 
a plumber’s mate, kitchen porter, and pastry-cook. He told me sadly of two 
youths who had said they did not go to the theatre because: “That’s not for us, 
it’s for the nobs.” TheLabour party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and the unions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions> had emancipated the working 
class economically, but what had they done to show the worker that he ought to 
take his share of the nation’s cultural life, that everyone was a “nob” in the 
theatre?

Yet even if the Labour party and the unions tried to remove the cultural 
barriers in the country, it would not mean that those untouched by the arts – 
nor the artists – would respond. Wesker has no illusions here either only hope. 
The heroine ofRoots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/09/roots-arnold-wesker-review> 
quotes the artists as saying: “The masses is too stupid for us to come down to 
them ... If they don’t make no effort why should we bother?” And she ends by 
crying: “It’s our own bloody fault. We want the third rate – we got it!”

Wesker adds in a note to actors and producers: “I am at one with these people 
– it is only that I am annoyed with them and myself.” And his heroine at the 
end – “articulate at last” – is obviously emancipated in the way that he thinks 
everyone should be, perhaps helped by the Labour party and the unions. “I’m 
beginning, on my own two feet – I’m beginning,” she cries. It is one of the 
most moving curtain lines in the contemporary theatre it is also an eloquent 
example of what Wesker is appealing for generally.

Perhaps it would help the unions and the Labour party to get the deeper roots 
they need in the country. One can see possible advantages from their point of 
view. But what of Wesker’s future as a dramatist if he becomes deeply involved 
in politics and wants to bring political organisations into the arts ? I 
cornered him early one morning in his London basement flat, and he made some 
black coffee for us and sat down to talk – to try to put a theatregoer’s fears 
at rest!

Q: Do you think then that you have a message us a writer?
AW: I wouldn’t be much good as a writer if I was only concerned with putting 
over a message. But no writer can write anything without saying something or 
other. Every action you do, every judgment you make, every character you 
perpetrate implies a value. You can’t get away with saying nothing, and if you 
realise this you sort of assume a responsibility. You have to ask yourself: 
“What do I really feel, what do I really see?” I don’t start off with a 
message. I start as a human being with my own attitude to life, then people and 
situations fall into place. I’ll not write about characters simply for their 
own sake – because they’re odd or they’re supposed to have a funny face or 
strange mannerisms. That’s a sort of slumming. It doesn’t get me anywhere and I 
don’t think it gets an audience anywhere. I want to organise experience which 
to a large extent is what art is, and infuse it with my own idealism, attitude 
to life – call it what you like – and then perhaps I can produce a play that 
means something, that is worthwhile.

Should a writer be committed to a party?
It must be very difficult for anyone to be alive today and not be dissatisfied 
with something or other. It’s not that I start off from a distance, as it were. 
Supposing that I had a reasonably secure background, not upper class but middle 
class, and I looked round and saw that there were things that were wrong and I 
went and wrote about them: that would be different. It doesn’t happen like 
that. I start off as a human being involved in living. I was involved with the 
family ofChicken Soup with Barley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/08/chicken-soup-with-barley-review> 
(the first play in his trilogy) and I felt the rise and fall of the family. 
That play could have ended with the son’s attacks and the mother deflating, 
beaten, but it doesn’t. She gets up again. As a human being. That’s something 
which I personally added to a situation that I had experienced, because it 
seemed to me that one could easily die of one’s misfortunes and the things that 
depress, deflate one. I didn’t want that. I saw the whole sort of series of 
mistakes and stupidities of the Stalinist era affecting so much more than the
communist <https://www.theguardian.com/world/communism> parties throughout the 
world. It affected the whole of the Labour movement’s progressive thought and 
religious bodies as well, like the Quakers. That was a whole period of 
depression, of deflation. But it seems to me the one thing that was forgotten 
was that socialism in its set-up and theory contains the seeds of its own 
rejuvenation. Even though it fails, it contains a constitution that insists on 
right being done eventually. That is why I think things win improve in the 
Soviet Union. I believe that the right kind of socialist society must be 
organised so that human beings are doing the kind of jobs they enjoy. I think 
this doesn’t exist now because of the kind of society in which we live.

You preach this in your work?
Not preach, but it may sort of come up. I take a situation in which an 
individual tries to do a job on his own and I show how he fails. This is it. 
But I’m not the kind of writer who leaves everything in by implication only, 
because I think implications bypass some of the most intelligent audiences. I’m 
not writing to the general, sophisticated audiences anyway. I voted like the 
man-in-the-street who has never been to a theatre to come into my plays and 
know what I’m writing about. That’s how Brecht works. I’ve just got on to him. 
Thank God I have written four plays before reading about Brecht. I might have 
been overwhelmed.

Wouldn’t your plan to get the Labour party and the unions to help the theatre 
give it over to the politicians?
I don’t believe in a theatre in the hands of a political party. The Labour 
party must say that we believe the arts to be an important part of the nation’s 
strength and we therefore give it our backing. I can’t think of any of the 
talented men of the theatre who would stomach dictatorship from any party or 
organisaton. There’s really a much more subtle form of dictatorship in the 
present system. The theatre really belongs to one class.

Who has influenced you as a dramatist?
Quite honestly I’d hardly been to the theatre before writing Chicken Soup with 
Barley. I owe a lot toLindsay Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/03/2> (the director).

Your technique was largely instinctive?
It must have been. A lot of the critics suggest it’s not very good. Some say 
my plays are really radio plays, television plays, novels turned into plays. 
About the biggest influence has been the cinema – Italian films, the half-dozen 
good films that come out of Hollywood every now and then, the Japanese cinema – 
that’s great.

What are your plans?
A musical. And I’m in the process of scripting The Kitchen for a film. I will 
be starting work on an original film script soon. Later on I hope to start work 
on an original film musical, the first anywhere in England.

No work for the theatre?
I very much want to write a play completely out of the style of my previous 
work. I’m a pretty conventional playwright. I have used the proscenium arch and 
second and third acts. I’m not an innovator. I would like to develop the kind 
of mind that could discard convention. I might find I can’t do it, that my 
virtue lies in being very ordinary. (Baby cries come from the next room.) 
Aren’t they marvellous sounds? (He brings put his son who was born in November 
and named after Lindsay Anderson and Wesker’s father. Lindsay Joe replaces his 
father as the centre of attention for a few minutes.) Sooner or later this new 
generation is going to be put into perspective. I don t think any of us claim 
we are doing anything new - just rather relevant.

 The Guardian, 18 January 1960. 
You are surely extending the scope of the theatre by the kind of people you 
write about?
I don’t know. We tend to forget The Corn is Green 
<https://youtu.be/xrFGMvnqeT8>, Love on the Dole 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXuEei4VET4>, and other plays.

Some of them are written from the distance you were talking about and have 
characters with those funny faces.
I don’t think of my work as consciously working-class. People don’t run around 
saying: “I’m working class.” I’m one with the people I write about. I go back 
to trade union and Socialist party backing. I think I have missed out an 
important aspect. It’s not so much that one wins the propaganda machine of a 
political party, but this organisation represents a section of the community 
which hitherto has not been involved in the cultural life of the community 
because it has not seemed important. Nobody has said it was important. It 
should have been a duty of the trade unions, of the Labour party, to say it was 
important. They have the means to make a cultural contact with people the arts 
haven’t contacted. We want to use these means to get through. The big problem 
for a lot of us is this barrier. We can’t make contact. We are still looked on 
as odd, art is odd. There’s been perpetrated a myth that art is a different 
world. There was a tragic, terribly sad interview on television. Two boys asked 
why they didn’t go to Bristol Old Vic said: “That’s not or us, it’s for the 
nobs.” That’s tragic. It’s been partly perpetrated by artists themselves and 
certainly by the press. Perhaps through the unions and the Labour party, we 
could make contact, show it’s not “for the nobs.”

 How do you plan to do it?
My trilogy is going to be put on at the Royal Court. It may be in May. The 
last part, I’m talking about Jerusalem, opens at Coventry – the Belgrade – on 
28 March. Most people think the title’s odd at first, then they like it more. 
When this has happened, I think I’ll be better known and any appeal I make will 
have more weight behind it. I don’t think many people in the Labour movement 
will yet know who I am. As soon as I feel in a strong enough position, I plan 
to get a letter written to the secretary of every union and see what comes of 
it. It will be a miniature manifesto stating why I think they should take an 
active interest in the arts and suggest what they can do, such as sponsoring a 
documentary film about the changing face of Britain; finance an investigation 
through the trade union movement into folk culture and ballads; guarantee half 
a dozen plays a year at Stratford East, the Royal Court, the Belgrade; and 
perhaps be responsible for building a new theatre in a new industrial town. 
These don’t sound wild schemes. They’re all practical, don’t you think? They 
would be a very small beginning. And the community would be told from 
responsible organisations that represent them – it would be indicated to them, 
suggested to them, that they have something to get from the cultural life of 
the community. It could do something for them if we could make contact – if 
only we could. Somebody said this could all be done on television.
