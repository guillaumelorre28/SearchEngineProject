Eighty per cent of rural people in sub-Saharan Africa depend on smallholder 
agriculture for their livelihood, and women provide seventy per cent of the 
agricultural labour and produce over ninety per cent of the food. Despite the 
hugely significant contribution that women make to Africa's food security, 
their voices are often ignored by policy makers.

Progress in bringing women's issues onto the policy makers' agendas has been 
slow and it has been further reduced by local traditional structures that often 
favour men. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa, rural women, consistently lack 
access to land, credit, agricultural inputs like seeds, training, technology, 
and information on their rights e.g. land rights, meaning they cannot escape 
poverty and lead the life they want.

When will people start listening to rural women? Why are rural women not able 
to enforce their rights? What will it take to make policy makers act to improve 
women's lives?
