This is the first of two supplements published from winning entries in the 
Guardian international development competition.

Last March, the paper and website put out a call for entries to a development 
journalism competition; more than 400 people entered, both amateur and 
professional journalists. The finalists - including the eight amateurs featured 
in this supplement - were each sent to a country in Africa or Asia to write an 
article for it. The judges chose Sylvia Rowley as the winner in the amateur 
category; she writes here about the oppression, and resulting HIV risk, 
experienced by men in India who have sex with other men.

Each supplement is based around the millennium development goals, so next 
there is an introductory feature talking about the MDGs in one country, 
Tanzania, and how it is progressing.

Across much of the developing world, girls have less education than boys. Our 
next article explains how things are changing in Tanzania. Next, we take a look 
at malaria in Uganda, and how it is being treated. Laws against abortion in 
Ghana and Ethiopia have been liberalised. So why do so many risk illegal 
abortions? In Bangladesh, we find out why sanitation should be available to 
all. We consider how radio is getting children's voices heard in Senegal and 
also take a look at 'witchcraft' in Tanzania and Mozambique, and the murders of 
suspected witches. And in India, we find out how blind children are reclaiming 
their place with the rest of society.
