, an interactive feature focusing on the Snowden Files and produced by the 
Guardian's US team, won a gold medal in the competition.

Commenting about the interactive, judges said that "this in many ways took a 
complicated subject and presented it in a complete way," adding that "it was 
flawless. I really enjoyed the experience."

The Guardian was also awarded a silver medal in the best of multimedia 
category forFirestorm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family>
, a multimedia ebook created by the Guardian Australia team telling the story 
of the 2013 Dunalley bushfire in Tasmania through the eyes of an affected 
family.

One of the judges commented: "The graphics are holistic in the sense that they 
blend very easily together. There's nothing you don't need to be focused on 
while you're in that piece of the story. They added, "It did an amazing job of 
conveying the feeling that you're there, almost to the point that you're 
smelling the smoke the way it's described."
