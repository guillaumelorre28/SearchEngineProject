The hosts, Equatorial Guinea, benefited from a hotly disputed penalty in the 
last minute of normal time to go on and beat Tunisia 2-1 in extra time in the
Africa Cup of Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> 
quarter-finals.

The Mauritian referee, Rajindraparsad Seechurn, ruled Ivan Bolado was fouled 
in the 90th minute withEquatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> trailing 1-0 and on 
the way out of the tournament.

Seechurn’s highly contentious decision sparked fury from Tunisian players and 
the coaching staff on the sidelines. There were ugly confrontations between 
both camps near the dugouts and riot police even moved in to restore order.

Javier Balboa scored from the spot-kick deep in stoppage time and curled in a 
brilliant free-kick in the first half of extra time to send Equatorial Guinea 
into the semi-finals for the first time.

At the final whistle there was more trouble when the sides clashed again near 
the dugouts. Seechurn was surrounded by furious Tunisian players and then 
chased by them across the field and down the tunnel as riot police and 
yellow-jacketed security officials tried to escort him away safely.

Equatorial Guinea will play the winner of Sunday’s quarter-final between Ghana 
and Guinea.
