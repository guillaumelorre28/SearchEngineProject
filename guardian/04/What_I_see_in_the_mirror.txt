The first mirror I come across is in my bathroom. My face isn't dramatically 
altered by make-up so I don't feel I need a massive disguise to face the world.

It's always difficult to see yourself as other people do but I'm realistic 
about my appearance. I wasn't born with one of those pretty, pretty faces so 
I've never been absorbed with the way I look. I just try to make the most of 
what I've got.

I've got blond hair, very large eyes and full lips. In an ideal world I'd like 
longer fingers. I'd rather just do some specific exercises to mould myself into 
a better shape than go under the knife.

I went through a schoolgirl punk stage in which I dyed my hair green and pink 
and wore safety pins in my ears - and other places - so I do like to play with 
my image, but today it tends to be more sombre and serious. I no longer feel 
the need to draw attention to myself. I tend to wear the same simple style of 
clothes - variations on black.

I've always been fascinated how we construct our public image, even more so 
when looking at celebrities. Photography can be a deceitful, superficial medium 
that leads us into believing something even though we know it's not necessarily 
true. It lulls us into a false sense of complacency.

We now live in this virtual world of ever expanding media and imagery and we 
don't know what's real, or what's the whole truth and what's part truth.
