Glad to see Timothy Garton Ash touching on the question of corruption in 
parliament (It’s not just parliament’s buildings that require extensive 
renovation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/27/parliament-lawmakers-pmqs-special-advisers>
, 28 March). The full charge sheet is as follows: cash for questions, cash for 
access (twice), cash for honours, cash for influence (twice), Jowellgate, Peter 
Watt, Michael Brown, Bernie Ecclestone, Werrittygate, Hunt, Rifkind and Straw. 
One scandal every 18 months or so. Then we have the institutionalised cultural 
corruption of corporate lobbying, directorships, revolving doors and political 
donations. And last but not least, the alleged 14 cases where the Metropolitan 
police terminated investigations that were implicating MPs and establishment 
figures and the 46 instances where similar cover-ups took place. All these are 
in addition to the absurd spectacle of PMQs and the House of Lords, and 
spadocracy and MPs’ expenses, which were mentioned by Timothy Garton Ash.

In the face of this elephantine boil on the fat buttock of Westminster, we are 
being treated to prolonged national debate over the layout of Miliband’s second 
kitchen. No wonder so many people are turning away from electoral politics.
