Here’s a theory: Jenny Beavan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jenny-beavan> 
is the most disruptive force working in the film industry today. In the last 
few weeks, she’s won two highly prestigious awards – a Bafta and an Oscar, both 
for her work designing costumes for Mad Max: Fury Road – and both times it’s 
been as if someone has let a bomb off.

It was her win, remember, that prompted Stephen Fry’s Twitter exit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/stephen-fry-deletes-twitter-account-after-baftas-bag-lady-offence>
, after people questioned his decision to call her a “bag lady 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/stephen-fry-hits-back-at-criticism-of-baftas-bag-lady-joke-she-got-it-derrr>
” on air. And now there’s a Vine of her going unapplauded as she walked down 
the aisle to collect her Oscar last night [see footnote].

In fact, the Vine is much worse than that. People weren’t just failing to clap 
Beavan. They were literally flinching at the sight of her. Tom McCarthy gave 
her such a withering up-and-down that you’d think he was auditioning for Meryl 
Streep’s role in a touring theatrical version of The Devil Wears Prada.

Alejandro Iñárritu glowered as if a woman in a leather jacket was somehow more 
repulsive than DiCaprio chomping down a raw bison liver. One man, bless his 
heart, all but leapt into the arms of his companion as she sauntered past, in 
the same manner that a housewife in a 1950s cartoon would if a mouse suddenly 
crawled out from under the skirting board.

Why did Stephen Fry leave Twitter? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/feb/15/stephen-fry-left-twitter-bafta-video-explainer>
What’s the real story here? Are these people really offended by the idea that 
a middle-aged British woman has chosen not to massacre her body in the name of 
chasing an impossible Hollywood ideal? Are they really outraged by the notion 
of someone dressing for comfort? Hardly. This is theOscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> we’re talking about, the very 
heartland of two-faced air-kissing insincerity. These people are professional. 
They can smile and clap through anything.

So it’s likely that the truth is more sinister. What could Jenny Beavan 
possibly have done to these people to inspire such outright hostility?

Ten unproven and purely speculative theories


1. The bejewelled skull on Beavan’s leather jacket was modelled after 
Iñárritu’s dead grandmother.

2. Ten seconds before her name was announced, Beavan was seen strangling a 
homeless man for his loose change with her scarf.

3. Jenny Beavan is actually Donald Trump doing a weird Mrs Doubtfire turn.

4. The audience had heard a draft of Beavan’s controversial victory speech, 
and realised that they couldn’t possibly be seen condoning a message as 
aggressive as “it’s nice when people are nice to each other”.

5. They all thought that this was the ceremony where they had to clap people 
of colour, not women.

6. It was a simple case of jealously. Tom McCarthy was still bitter that 
Beavan had refused to dress Mark Ruffalo’s Spotlight character in a silver body 
armour made entirely of human pelvises.

7. They were reminded of the old nursery rhyme “If you publicly clap a woman 
named Beavan, none of your children will go to heaven”.

8. The men knew that their significant others were in attendance, and they 
realised that clapping Beavan would give away the torrid, decades-long affair 
that they’ve all been having with her.

9. This was approximately the 15th successive award won by Mad Max: Fury Road, 
and the directors were starting to worry that people might have preferred a fun 
film about some cool cars to their interminably worthy and hard-to-watch 
meditations on endless constant hardship.

10. The Oscars are really long and incredibly boring, and clapping Beavan 
would have distracted these people from the near-impossible task of remaining 
awake until the show reached its conclusion.

• The following footnote was appended on 3 March 2016: after this article was 
published, Alejandro González Iñárritu issued a statement pointing out that, 
while he was not clapping as Jenny Beavan walked down the aisle past him and 
other guests,he did applaud her as she ascended the stairs to the stage
