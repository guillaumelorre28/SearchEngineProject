The Odd Couple in Brisbane

Queensland Theatre Company’s artistic director Wesley Enoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/02/wesley-enoch-sydney-festival-director-interview>
 directs his final play in Brisbane before taking on his new role at the helm 
of the Sydney festival: Neil Simon’s 1965 playThe Odd Couple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/neil-simon>, famously adapted for the screen 
in 1968, tells the story of two very different men unexpectedly united under 
one roof.

Jason Klarwin is Oscar, a slobby sports journo whose once-palatial apartment 
is a sea of domestic detritus, following his divorce. Tama Matheson is Felix, a 
pernickety neat-freak (“the only man in the world with clenched hair”) who, 
until his own recent divorce, had nothing in common with Oscar. UnderEnoch’s 
direction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/29/wesley-enoch-australia-lacks-vocal-arts-leaders-it-deserves>
, the play places gender centre stage, looking at how men’s roles have – or 
haven’t – changed over 50 years.

 * The Odd Couple <http://www.qpac.com.au/event/qtc_odd_couple_15.aspx> is at 
Playhouse, QPAC from 17 October to 8 November

 Proximity festival, Perth Photograph: Mat Sav/Art Gallery of Western Australia 
Intimate styles of theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/mar/03/theatre2> and performance are 
ever growing in popularity. TheOne-on-One festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/jun/29/one-on-one-theatre> 
was a big hit at London’s Battersea Arts Centre in 2010, and two years later, 
Australia got its own Proximity festival.

Each year since, artists have taken over a building in Western Australia, 
repurposing it for 12 days of experimental performance, with the emphasis on 
proximity. This year, the Art Gallery of Western Australia plays host, as 
curators Sarah Rowbottam and Kelli Mccluskey bring 12 emerging and established 
artists in for the festival.

Proximity kicks off with an aptly named Party for 1, although everyone, space 
permitting, is invited. Performers will lurk in unexpected spots, luring 
individuals into one-on-one performances. The festival continues with tours, 
talks and workshops.

 * Party for 1 <http://proximityfestival.com/proximity-2015/> opens the 
Proximity festival at the Art Gallery of Western Australia on 31 October

 Four Weddings and a Funeral Photograph: Palace Cinemas 
There might have been a renaissance of Australian film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/20/australias-lost-wave-of-film-or-the-renaissance-nobodys-noticed>
 in the past decade, but Australians still have a penchant for British cinema.

Box office numbers suggest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/not-love-actually-british-romcoms-bridget-jones-relationship-go-so-wrong>
 an affection for British romantic comedies spiked globally from the late 1990s 
to early 2000s. But even before then, the Brits had something to say about 
love. And for the BBC First’s third annual British Film festival, Palace 
Cinemas will host a series ofretrospectives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/the-romance-25>, Love Actually: A 
Century of British Romance.

From love in the English countryside of the 1900s with Joseph Losey’s Palme 
d’Or winning The Go Between, to Ken Russell’s take on Women in Love by DH 
Lawrence; from John Schlesinger’s 1970 Sunday Bloody Sunday, which peaked at a 
bisexual love triangle, to the classic Oscar nominated romantic comedy Four 
Weddings and a Funeral (1994), the romance series covers it all.

In September 2015, Chippendale’s latest urban development opened to provide a 
Melbourne-style laneway in a heritage listed colonial Sydney spot. The 
converted 1840s workers’ cottages and warehouses on Kensington Street sit next 
to the $2bn “urban village” of Central Park, with a paved street of 
restaurants, cafes, small bars and all things relatively hip.

As part of Sydney Living Museum’s Sydney Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sydney-living-museums-partner-zone/gallery/2015/sep/23/sydney-open-2015-in-pictures>
, architects Tom Greer and Tonkin Zulaikha Greer will discuss how their project 
unfolded, and introduce a monthly alfresco art and design market, showcasing 
emerging luminaries of Sydney’s artisan makers scene.

 Author Lucy Treloar Photograph: The Wheeler Centre 
Lucy Treloar’s 2015 novel Salt Creek takes readers back to the South 
Australian coastline of 1850. There, a family struggles to survive in harsh 
conditions on the coastal wetland that is the traditional home of the 
Ngarrindjeri people. At the Moat in Melbourne, Treloar will talk about her 
writing process, alongside other Australian literary voices in the October 
edition of The Next Big Thing.

This series of monthly discussions is run by the Wheeler Centre to help 
readers keep up with all that is new in books and writing. The event also 
showcases the writers to watch for on the book scene. Treloar will be joined by 
Claire Varley, Luke Beesley and Rafael SW (long-listed for Guardian Australia’s
Richell prize for emerging writers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/26/emerging-writers-prize-launched-by-hachette-and-guardian-australia>
) to discuss their work over food and drink.
