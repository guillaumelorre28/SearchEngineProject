Alejandro González Iñárritu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu> has won the 
Oscar for best director for The Revenant at the 88th Academy awards, his second 
in a row after triumphing in the same category in 2015 for Birdman. Iñárritu 
was the favourite for the award, despite strong competition from the likes of 
Tom McCarthy for Spotlight and Adam McKay for The Big Short.

Based on a novel by Michael Punke, The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio as 
19th-century frontiersman Hugh Glass, who is left for dead in the wilderness 
after a bear attack. The film was reportedly a gruelling production, with 
Iñárritusuggesting he may have made “an irresponsible decision”

 in the way he went about it. However, The Revenant proved a box office hit, 
grossing over $380m worldwide to date.

 The Revenant – video review 
The film has already proved an awards magnet for the director, with Iñárritu 
picking up the Bafta and Golden Globe for best director, as well as the 
reliable Oscar bellwether of the Directors Guild of America award. With this 
Academy award, Iñárritu is the first director to win twice in a row since 
Joseph L Mankiewicz in 1950 and 1951, for A Letter to Three Wives and All About 
Eve respectively.
