Cheick Diabaté's double ensured Mali beat 10-man Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> in the third place play-off to 
secure their best finish at an Africa Nations Cup for 40 years.

The Bordeaux midfielder scored in each half to complete a memorable tournament 
forMali <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mali>, capped by just their 
second ever win over their western Africa rivals.

Diabaté opened the scoring after 23 minutes and after Ghana had Isaac Vorsah 
sent off in the 64th minute he secured victory 10 minutes from time.

Mali had lost their previous three third-place play-off but after Garra 
Dembélé shot narrowly wide Diabaté gave them a lead thanks to his poacher's 
instinct. Adam Larsen failed to hold on to Bakaye Traoré's low shot and Diabaté 
was on hand to stab home the loose ball.

Ghana threatened only once before the break to pull a goal back, but Jordan 
Ayew's 20-yard effort was comfortably held by Oumar Sissoko.

Ghana thought they had levelled eight minutes after the interval when Sulley 
Muntari lashed in a knockdown but he was just caught offside.

The four-time champions' hopes were then dealt a major blow when Vorsah was 
needlessly booked for the second time when he kicked out at Samba Diakité.

Mali always looked the likely winners thereafter and, while Ayew curled 
another effort from the edge of the area just wide, Diabaté made the game safe 
when he prodded in Adama Tamboura's low pass across the six-yard box.
