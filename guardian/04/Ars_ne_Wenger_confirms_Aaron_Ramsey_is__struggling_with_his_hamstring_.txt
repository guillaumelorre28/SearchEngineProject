Ramsey limped out of the club’s opening game of the Premier League season, the 
4-3 home defeat to Liverpool on 14 August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report>
, and it was originally hoped that he would be out for around three weeks. But 
he has not yet been able to train fully because he has felt pain every time he 
has prepared to do so.

The 25-year-old, who has a history of hamstring problems, starred for Wales at 
Euro 2016 had said that hedid not expect to be match fit for the beginning of 
the new season <http:>. Chris Coleman, the Wales manager, said that he was 
surprised to see Ramsey play against Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/chris-coleman-aaron-ramsey-wales-arsene-wenger-arsenal>
 and has questioned whether the injury could have been prevented.

Ramsey is set to miss his club’s next three games – against Chelsea, Basel in 
the Champions League and Burnley – and theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> manager does not expect him to 
join up with Wales for their World Cup qualifiers against Austria and Georgia 
on 6 and 9 October. Arsenal’s first fixture after the international break is at 
home to Swansea City on 15 October.

Wenger: I don’t plan on reading book about José Mourinho

“Aaron is still struggling with his hamstring and I don’t think that he will 
be available against Basel or at Burnley so, before the break, he will not be 
available,” Wenger said. “We had a few disappointments because he was close to 
joining again and, every time, he is not completely ready. He is not far, but 
we have to be cautious with him.

“He has a small grade-one hamstring but he is not completely free in his mind 
yet to push completely, so we stop him every time when he has a little pain. He 
is in the last days of his rehab and, as long as he is not completely 
comfortable, we do not push him.”

Wenger was asked whether Ramsey’s injury history influenced how he was 
handled. “Not really, because it’s nothing major,” Wenger replied. “But I am a 
bit more cautious than I would be. If he was ready to play, I would involve him 
in the squad, but he is not. Will he go away withWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales>? I don’t think so.”
