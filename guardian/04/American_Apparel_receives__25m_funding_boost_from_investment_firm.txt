American Apparel <https://www.theguardian.com/business/american-apparel> has 
reached a preliminary deal with investment firm Standard General to receive a 
$25m investment to bolster the clothing chain's finances, a person close to the 
negotiations said Wednesday.

The deal will help pay off a $10m loan from investment firm Lion Capital, 
which made a formal demand for payment Monday. Lion Capital claimed that the 
chain defaulted under its credit agreement because it ousted its founder and 
CEO Dov Charney.

The pact will also mean shaking up American Apparel's board of directors, said 
the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of 
the discussions. The deal is expected to be announced later Wednesday.

What remains to be seen is what role Charney will play.

On June 18, the Los Angeles-based company's board fired Charney as chairman 
and suspended him as president and CEO. His contract requires a 30-day period 
before he can be terminated. The board cited "alleged misconduct."

Charney signed a five-year loan agreement two weeks ago with Standard General 
to increase his stake in American Apparel to 43%, but the terms strip him of 
his rights to vote on those shares without Standard General's consent.

According to the terms, Charney agreed that he will not serve on the board nor 
play any leadership role in the company until the investigation is complete. 
And Charney will not serve a role at the company if he is deemed "unfit."

Standard General said Monday in a regulatory filing that it has "opened a 
constructive, detailed and substantive dialogue with members of the current 
board."

According to the terms of the agreement between American Apparel and Standard 
General, co-chairmen Allan Mayer and David Danziger will be the only current 
directors who will stay on the seven-member board.
