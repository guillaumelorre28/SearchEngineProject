Manuel the receptionist

There are more laughs in these 90 seconds than many sitcoms manage in an 
entire episode. “Where are your ears, you great big halfwit?” asks Manuel, left 
in charge. He has clearly learned from his boss – and is now answering the 
phone with a rudeness to rival Basil’s. Then, of course, it turns out to be 
Basil on the phone. Unable to actually beat Manuel in person as punishment, 
Basil manages to manoeuvre things so that the builder – “You are a hideous 
orangutan” – punches Manuel in the face. It’s pure slapstick: cruel and 
hilarious.

Basil the rat

Manuel’s loneliness in the permanently grey Torquay drives him to acquire a 
pet rat, resulting in perhaps the greatest scenes of farce Fawlty Towers ever 
conjured up. Andrew Sachs’ delighted greeting of his new friend, clapping his 
hands together and trilling “Ba-seel!”, is the trigger for a hotel-wide rat 
hunt, around a plummy young couple and towards the cheese biscuits. Manuel’s 
sheer terror as the farce climaxes – “you put Basil in the ratatouille!” – is a 
masterpiece of double meaning.

“I know nothing!”

While Manuel was subjected to occasional lapses into casual 1970s xenophobia 
(“you dago dodo!”), the cultural rift between him and the Brits around him was 
full of comic potential – particularly his terrible language skills, a simple 
and sublime foil for Basil Fawlty’s rising blood pressure. As Basil tries to 
keep his betting on the down-low from Sybil, it’s up to him to explain to 
Manuel that he must pretend not to know about it. Of course, Manuel’s poor 
English and man-child innocence mean the scheme is doomed to fail.

The talking moose

This clip really belongs to the Major (Ballard Berkeley), and is all about the 
terrific double-take he does upon hearing what he believes to be a moose 
talking, but is actually an English actor playing a Spanish waiter attempting 
his version of received pronunciation (“I can speak English, I learned it from 
a booook”). Once again, Manuel’s blithe innocence is the bass note around which 
the entire comic riff is built.

“Breakfast kaput!”

One of the neatest jokes in Fawlty Towers is how Basil’s constant abuse of 
Manuel always comes back to haunt him. Manuel is quite literally a cowed figure 
– never walking so much as retreating – and in his desperation to please he 
becomes hopelessly rigid in following the rules. In this scene, his dogmatic 
adherence to breakfast hours reduces an upstanding guest to barking “I’m a 
doctor and I want my sausages!” in a matter of seconds. Basil, of course, is 
left sweaty and defeated.
