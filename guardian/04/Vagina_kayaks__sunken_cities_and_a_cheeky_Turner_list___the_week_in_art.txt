Exhibition of the week

Sunken Cities
Egypt is the most darkly alluring of ancient cultures. Underwater archaeology 
is one of the most adventurous ways to study the past. Put them both together 
and the British Museum hopes for a summer smash hit with this survey of two 
lost cities whose treasures have been recovered from the depths.

 Antoine Watteau’s Sous un habit de Mezetin. 1717- 1719. Photograph: The 
Wallace Collection, London 
The commedia dell’arte character Mezetin looks at us with lyrical intimacy as 
he strums his guitar. His silken costume, bohemian company and the theatrical 
feel of the setting all reflect the fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere Watteau’s 
brush creates. Yet the robust, earthy quality of the faces tells us these are 
real people. Mezetin is a portrait of Watteau’s art dealer Pierre Sirois. Art 
and life magically merge.
