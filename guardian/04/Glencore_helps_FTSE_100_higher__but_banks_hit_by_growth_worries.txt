Controversial commodities trader Glencore has made a fairly disappointing 
start to its life in the public spotlight.

The hitherto secretive business floated in May at 530p a share and it has been 
pretty much downhill from there. On Friday it touched a low of 505p but it has 
bounced 10p to 515p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. The main 
catalyst was a positive note from Deutsche Bank, which began coverage of the 
company with a buy rating and 650p price target. Deutsche said:
 The combination of a growing producing base and a successful trading business 
means that Glencore is different to the diversified miners. The company is able 
to generate profits all along the commodity value chain, benefitting from 
rising prices, growing trade and increased volatility. The stock is currently 
being valued as a diversified miner, at a discount to BHP Billiton and its 
commodity trading peer group. We believe the stock will re-rate as the market 
gains more confidence in the sustainability of this business. 
But Xstrata - where Glencore <https://www.theguardian.com/business/glencore> 
has a 34.49% stake - fell 8p to 1355.5p on concerns about its operations in 
Peru after reports of an election victory for former army commander Ollanta 
Humala, who may extend the state's role in the economy and regulate strategic 
sectors like mining.Hochschild Mining was 46.5p lower at 500p for the same 
reason. Analysts at Liberum Capital said:
 [The election victory] heightens the risk of higher taxes on Peruvian miners 
= potential bad news for Xstrata and Hochshild. Xstrata is the most exposed of 
majors, Peru was 4.5% of earnings in 2010 but it is where all of Xstrata's 
copper growth will come from. We do not expect expropriation but without Peru, 
Xstrata's growth to 2015 falls from 45% to 26% and would reduce 2012 earnings 
per share by 21%. Expect Xstrata to underperform until the outcome. 
Overall the market struggled to find direction, with investors still nervous 
about a possible Greek default and the prospect of weak global growth, as 
evidenced by Friday's disappointing US non-farm payroll numbers. After falling 
to 5827, theFTSE 100 finished 8.15 points higher at 5863.16. But volumes were 
again fairly thin, and the market's recent uninspired performance is backed up 
by the fact that, as things stand, there may be no changes to the FTSE 100's 
constituents at this week's quarterly review (althoughTui Travel, down 2.6p at 
225p, is on thin ice as far as demotion goes.)

But Czech miner New World Resources, up 3.5p at 893.5p, could join the FTSE 
250. If it does, then tracker funds would be chasing shares in what is a fairly 
illiquid stock, unless existing shareholders decide to cash in some of their 
holdings.

Banks were among the leading fallers, with Lloyds Banking Group 1.835p lower 
at 46.9p after reports its new chief executive expected any turnaround to take 
up to five years.Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 0.06p to 41.48p and Barclays 
lost 1.5p to 264p.

Elsewhere Severn Trent dropped 17p to £14.63 after a downgrade from JP Morgan 
Cazenove, partly due to the fact water companies will take control of 
maintaining most of the UK's private sewers and drains this year, previously 
the responsibility of householders. The bank said:
 We are downgrading our Severn Trent recommendation to underweight from 
neutral based on valuation and earnings momentum. We have reduced our March 
2012 earnings per share by 17% from 97.4p to 81.1p due to additional costs from 
private sewers, lower services profits and higher IRE (infrastructure renewals 
expenditure).

The bank was also neutral on United Utilities, 8p lower at 602p, saying:
 We believe that there is some uncertainty regarding whether the companies 
will be able to recover all of the operating costs associated with the adoption 
of private sewers. We think that this is particularly true for United Utilities 
[which] has guided to total private sewer operating expenditure of £55m to 
March 15, which offsets the £50m of additional efficiency savings outlined at 
the full year results. 
International Airlines Group - the merged British Airways and Iberia - lost 
7.1p to 229.6p followinga forecast of falling profits this year for the 
industry from the International Air Transport Association 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/06/airline-industry-profit-slump-oil>
. ButEasyjet added 1.8p to 361.5p after an 11.3% rise in May passenger numbers.

Engineering group IMI added 17p to £10.38 after a positive note from 
Citigroup. The bank said:
 IMI is our top pick in the UK engineers. We see it as an attractive 
multi-year investment driven by accelerated growth and margin expansion. We 
expect margin targets to be achieved by 2013 and see further upside potential. 
We are raising our target price to £13.50 from £12.60. 
Talk of a possible bid from Richemont for Tiffany renewed speculation that UK 
luxury goods groupBurberry, up 2p at £13.07, could find itself in the sights of 
a predator.

Among the mid-caps, Aegis added 9.8p to 151p after the media buying group said 
it was in talks with French market research group Ipsos about a potential £500m 
sale of its Synovate division 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jun/06/aegis-in-talks-on-synovate-sell-off>
. Analysts said such a move could lead to a bid for the rest of the business. 
Singer Capital Markets said:
 This is likely to lead to trigger speculation that if Synovate is sold that 
Vincent Bollore, who is Havas Chairman and Shareholder and owns a large stake 
in Aegis, will pursue the remaining Aegis Media business. 
Singer also said other market research companies could now come under the 
spotlight, includingCello, down 1.5p at 43p.

Moneysupermarket.com rose 2.55p to 101.5p after positive notes from Credit 
Suisse and Numis. Numis even compared Moneysupermarket to much hyped US 
flotation Groupon, to the latter's detriment:
 Why buy Groupon, when you could have moneysupermarket.com, where we believe 
chances are, the long term shareholder return will be greater? 
Lower down the market HMV was 4.05p higher at 12.25p after a report the 
struggling retailer was close to agreeing a two-year refinancing deal with its 
banks.
