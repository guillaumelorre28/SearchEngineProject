Iran’s supreme leader has awarded medals to navy commanders for capturing US 
sailors who entered Iranian territorial waters this month,Iran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> state media said on Sunday.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei>, who has said Iran 
should remain wary of its arch-enemy the US even after a landmark accord over 
Tehran’s nuclear programme, awarded the Fath (Victory) medal to the head of the 
navy of the Revolutionary Guards and four commanders involved in the seizure of 
two US navy boats.

 Iran has awarded the Fath medal since 1989 to war heroes, military commanders 
and politicians, especially those linked to the eight-year Iran-Iraq war in the 
1980s.

 Iran freed the 10 US sailors on 13 January, a day after detaining them aboard 
the two US navy patrol boats in the Gulf, bringing a swift end to an incident 
that had rattled nerves shortly before the expected implementation of the 
nuclear accord with world powers.

 The Revolutionary Guards said it had determined the patrol boats had entered 
Iranian territorial waters by mistake.

 The quick resolution contrasted with previous cases in which British 
servicemen were held by Iran for considerably longer, in once case almost two 
weeks.
