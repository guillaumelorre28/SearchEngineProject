The winner


January is the month when awards contenders jostle for attention at cinemas, 
but none of the Oscar-bait films posed much threat to grizzled action star Liam 
Neeson.Taken 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/06/taken-3-review-a-very-exhausted-set-of-skills>
 wiped the floor with the competition, grossing £6.71m, including previews of 
£926,000. Audiences paid no attention to critics – the ones tracked by 
MetaCritic awarded the film a poor 26/100 rating – rallying to a franchise that 
has not strayed far from its original winning formula.

Taken 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/04/taken-2-review> – which 
earned a warmer 45/100 score at MetaCritic – debuted in October 2012 with a 
slightly stronger £7.38m, including £1.19m in previews. Since the Taken concept 
relies on calamities befalling the family of retired CIA operative Bryan Mills, 
it’s not an obvious premise to yield sequels, and Neeson assures us that no 
more are planned. In the current film, Mills goes on the run after being framed 
for the murder of a family member.

Taken 3 faced no competition for the action audience. From Friday, Clint 
Eastwood’sAmerican Sniper <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper>, 
starring Bradley Cooper, should pull adult males, although it’s an altogether 
more serious affair, based on the memoir of an Iraq war combatant.

The head-to-head


Two films – both straddling the multiplex-specialised divide – fought for 
second place, ending up less than £15,000 apart for the weekend.The Theory of 
Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/theory-of-everything-review-hawking-eddie-redmayne>
 had the best of the early running on Friday, butInto the Woods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/17/into-the-woods-review-meryl-streep-rob-marshall-stephen-sondheim>
 surged on Saturday and Sunday, finally overtaking the Stephen Hawking film by 
a whisker. Woods ended on £2.48m, and Theory on £2.46m. Of course, it’s worth 
remembering that this was the second session of play for Theory – the film had 
already grossed £5.48m going into the weekend.

From Disney’s perspective, the 132% rise in Into the Woods’ box office from 
Friday to Saturday confirms that the Stephen Sondheim musical is appealing to 
families. But the film is working at all showtimes, indicating that it also has 
broad adult appeal, with older audiences presumably attracted more by the 
Sondheim angle, and others pulled in by star cast, Disney brand and 
appropriation of famous fairytales. Best site was Empire Leicester Square 
(perhaps suggesting a theatreland skew) ahead of Vue Westfield in Shepherds 
Bush, so often the top site for a newly released film. According to Disney, the 
top 20 sites across the UK and Ireland include Plymouth, Crawley, Nottingham, 
Sheffield and Dublin. “The film refuses, rather wonderfully, to be 
pigeon-holed,” said Disney’s UK and Ireland sales director Tom Batchelor.

The obvious comparative title for Into the Woods is Tim Burton’s Sweeney Todd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/25/musical.horror>, which began in 
January 2008 with a more robust £3.18m, plus £1.35m in previews. Sweeney Todd 
benefited from being the more famous brand, at least in the UK. In the US, Into 
the Woods has left Sweeney Todd for dust, with $105m so far, as opposed to $53m 
lifetime for the demon barber of Fleet Street.

In third place, The Theory of Everything fell a slim 16%, presumably buoyed by 
warm word-of-mouth and the 10 Bafta nominations, announced on Friday morning.
Eddie Redmayne’s Golden Globe win will help 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jan/12/golden-globes-2015-winners-boyhood-eddie-redmayne-video>
. After 11 days, the film has clocked up a nifty £7.94m, and should play right 
up to the Oscars ceremony on 22 February and beyond.

The wider awards race


While awards nominations are not a key part of Into the Woods’ marketing plan, 
they are playing a bigger role for two titles that battled in the middle of the 
table. Birdman, with 10 Bafta nominations, managed a decent hold, down 28%, 
although it’s worth noting that its cinema count moved up from 259 to 302. The 
film grossed £826,000 for the weekend, for an 11-day total of £2.99m. 
Foxcatcher, debuting at 333 venues, achieved £877,000.Foxcatcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/foxcatcher> was not so beloved by Bafta – 
just supporting actor nominations for Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo – but 
remains very much part of the awards conversation.

Foxcatcher distributor eOne afforded the film a much more ambitious release 
than any previous Bennett Miller title. The result is that Foxcatcher has 
already outgrossed the lifetime ofMoneyball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/24/moneyball-review> (£856,000) and 
eOne hopes to overtakeCapote <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/24/3>
 (£1.60m) by the end of this week. After nine weeks of play in the US, 
Foxcatcher has grossed only $8.75m. By rule of thumb, the equivalent UK result 
would be £875,000 – what Foxcatcher has managed in just three days. The 
challenge for Foxcatcher remains the tough competitive environment, which will 
get even fiercer. (See “The future”, below.)

Thanks to nine Bafta nominations, The Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-imitation-game> fell a slim 10% in its 
ninth frame, adding a handy £203,000 to its tally. Conversely, or perversely, 
the disappointing nominations forMr Turner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mr-turner> – or at least the incredulous 
media reporting thereof – may be behind the film’s 7% rise at the weekend. The 
Imitation Game now stands at £14.76m and Mr Turner at £6.58m.

Despite big drops from the previous frame, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five 
Armies and Paddington both added another £1m each at the weekend. Five Armies 
now stands at £39.20m, and is well on course to be the only 2014 release to 
crack £40m at the box office. Paddington, with £32.83m so far, has now overtaken
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film>(£32.72m) 
to become the fourth biggest hit of the year, behind Five Armies,The Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie> and The Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-2>.

The future


Overall, the market was a slim 10% down on the previous frame, but a very 
healthy 33% up on the equivalent session from 2014, when12 Years a Slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave> debuted at the top of the 
chart. The weekend was the fifth highest-grossing of the past year. Programmers 
at independent cinemas, already struggling to accommodate a wealth of titles, 
now face the mother of all headaches with the arrival ofWhiplash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/whiplash>, American Sniper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper>, Wild 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/wild> and Testament of Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/testament-of-youth>. A simple lack of screen 
space may mean that a couple of those pictures will find no room at your local 
arthouse, so expect upscale multiplexes to pick up the slack. Whiplash, which 
picked up five Bafta nominations (plus Miles Teller in the rising star 
category) and predictably won the supporting actor Golden Globe forJK Simmons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/jk-simmons-whiplash-interview>, 
should play in plexes and independent cinemas. The film has earned only $6.2m 
in the US so far, so there is plenty of scope for the UK to produce a better 
equivalent result for distributor Sony.
