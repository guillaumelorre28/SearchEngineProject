This year's â€¦

The Descendants in terms of its character-based comedy and themes of family 
tension.

Also, confusingly, this year's Argo in that it is co-produced by George 
Clooney and Grant Heslov (who scooped the crowning best picture Oscar for Ben 
Affleck's Iranian siege caper last February).

What's it all about?

Interior: a roomy Oklahoma house, the closets full of skeletons. At the head 
of the table sits Violet (Meryl Streep), a dying matriarch, addicted to 
prescription meds. Orbiting her come Julie Roberts (as Violet's brittle oldest 
daughter), Juliette Lewis (wayward youngest daughter) andBenedict Cumberbatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch> (deadbeat 
illegitimate son). Misty Upham lends support as the Cheyenne housekeeper who 
bears witness to the domestic squalls.

How did it happen?

Tracy Letts's original stage-play has won rave reviews, the 2008 Pulitizer 
prize for drama and (happy bonus) a powerhouse champion in producer Harvey 
Weinstein. The combination of the play's pedigree and Weinstein's backing 
ensured a smooth transition to the screen, although scheduling niggles meant 
that Andrea Riseborough (originally cast as the younger daughter) had to drop 
out in favour of Lewis. The film began shooting in the town of Bartlesville, 
Oklahoma in September last year, with a relatively modest budget of $25m and 
John Wells (a veteran of ER and The West Wing) in the director's chair.

Nominations it wants

Handsome, well-upholstered family sagas like this tend to dominate the acting 
and screenplay categories, thoughAugust: Osage County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/august-osage-county> also looks a shoo-in for 
the best picture shortlist. If so, don't rule out TV specialist Wells as an 
outside bet to join the hunt for the directing Oscar too.

What it might win

August: Osage County stars three-time winner Meryl Streep playing a provincial 
American Lear. She's an overbearing matriarch raging against the dying of the 
light. She has cancer and is addicted to drugs. All of which makes her the 
putative favourite for a fourth acting Oscar.Julia Roberts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts> (an Oscar-winner for 2000's 
Erin Brockovich) and Tracy Letts (who adapted his own stage-play) will also 
fancy their chances.

 It provides a banquet of rich dramatic meat, a keen sense of familial strife 
and a series of attention-grabbing roles for its big-name players. Possibly it 
even has a sense of the wider picture, too. As with Death of a Salesman, Letts 
installs his dysfunctional American family as a sly metaphor for a 
dysfunctional America.

Reasons it might fail

Might this domestic firestorm turn out too stagey, too relentlessly talky? 
Does director John Wells have enough big-screen exuberance to bring it to life? 
August: Osage County has got the revered source material, the family dramatics, 
andMeryl Streep <https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep> in the leading 
role. Might it even be a little too precision-tooled for its own good? Oscar 
voters may just baulk at being catered to so slavishly.

When can we see it

The release schedule positively reeks of Oscar ambitions. August: Osage County 
premieres at the Toronto film festival in September and is released in the US 
on Christmas Day. The UK roll-out duly follows just 24-hours later.
