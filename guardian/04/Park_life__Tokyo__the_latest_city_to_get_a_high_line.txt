New York and Paris have one, Singapore and Seoul want one. London can’t make 
its mind up. High lines – regenerating the elevated sections of disused railway 
lines to make new public spaces – have become a must-have for many cities. Like 
Tokyo.

One metro stop from the tourists walking Shibuya’s “scramble” crossing is an 
urban village, still in central Tokyo, called Daikanyama, where Log Road is the 
world’s newest high line. The best thing is: it’s also the most low-key.

Log Road is a collection of wooden cottages built on top of the old Tokyu line 
tracks, where trees and plants sprout next to benches. After the madness of 
Shibuya, walking through the tenements and green spaces of Log Road is an 
unfamiliar Tokyo experience.

Number 1 Log Road is Spring Valley Brewery <http://www.springvalleybrewery.jp/>
, owned by Japanese brewer Kirin. Local hipsters queue for lunches of Okinawan 
pork sausage and beer flights out on its terrace (try the sweet On The Cloud 
and bitter Afterdark). Or get a seat in the industrial interior, which shows 
off huge fermentation tanks through glass cases.

Crucially for this high line, there’s plenty of outdoor space. If you can’t 
get a table at Spring Valley or outside atGarden House Crafts 
<https://www.facebook.com/gardenhousecrafts/>, go to the end of Log Road: 
there’s an elevated space with picnic benches. This particular afternoon, the 
sun shines and couples are taking selfies in front of the district’s low-rise 
buildings. I’m drinking a flat white and eating a green matcha doughnut. A 
moment of peace in the world’s largest city.
