Stephen O'Donnell, Chairman and founder of the National Online Recruitment 
Awards <https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards> said: "I believe 
it speaks volumes that Guardian Jobs has now won the award for Best Online 
Recruitment by a Consumer Publication for the past four consecutive years...The 
service delivered to candidates goes way beyond the mere delivery of vacancy 
adverts, and actively engages job seekers throughout their search. It is no 
coincidence that Guardian Careers was also shortlisted as a Finalist for the 
Best Employment Advice Website."
