Paul Merson has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal and their manager Arsène 
Wenger in the wake of Tuesday’sChampions League capitulation against Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/04/arsenal-anderlecht-champions-league-match-report>
, branding the team “tactically clueless”.

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> had been coasting at 
3-0 before a second-half collapse earned the Belgian champions an unlikely 3-3 
draw.

The former Arsenal midfielder Merson, who was a pundit for the Group D clash 
for Sky, said: “I think they are tactically clueless, that’s an honest opinion. 
This is not the first time it’s happened, it’s happened a lot. It’s absolutely 
clueless. For me the manager has to get a message on, but these are 
international footballers, they are not little kids.

“They play for their countries, in World Cups, in the Premier League, and they 
are all bombing forward. Surely something in your head, if you know football, 
you say let’s stop here, let’s have two banks of four, leave two up front and 
let them break us down. It’s clueless as football knowledge.”

His fellow pundit Dietmar Hamann labelled the performance as naive. “The 
naivety is staggering, they were still attacking at 3-1 and 3-2 with five or 
six men,” said Hamann. “Collectively it comes back to the manager to make the 
changes. At 3-0 or 3-1 he could have brought Walcott on to maybe get another on 
the counter.

 The Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger says he is very disappointed with his team’s 
3-3 draw 
“The players never thought about the team success, they wanted to get on the 
scoresheet and they got the ultimate punishment tonight. As Mikel Arteta said 
it’s not acceptable for a team that wants to win and challenge for trophies at 
the highest level to be 3-0 up against that team and let them come back to get 
a draw.”

Wenger was scathing about the defensive performance, although he disagreed 
with the accusation that his team had been too open as they continued to press 
for goals. Besnik Hasi, theAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> manager, said that Arsenal 
had “tried to play the same way” and “didn’t just sit back [at 3-0]”.

“We dropped off too much and we didn’t go into the challenges any more,” 
Wenger said. “Then, you are always open. We didn’t stop the crosses, the long 
balls. In the second half, it was bad defending more than being out-numbered.

“We gave a poor defensive performance from the first to the last. We never 
felt comfortable. There was a bit of bad luck because the first [Anderlecht] 
goal was offside but our defensive performance was not good enough. Across the 
pitch defensively, we were very, very poor.”
