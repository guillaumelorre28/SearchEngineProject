When Pam Horan, President of the Online Publishers Association (OPA), wrote in 
December 2012 that"programmatic buying does not build brands" 
<http://digiday.com/publishers/programmatic-buying-doesnt-build-brands/>, few 
would have disagreed. Today, times have changed as big data, programmatic 
buying and real-time bidding have collectively paved the way for a new 
generation of brand opportunities online.

Recognising the growing shift in buying trends from single-site buys to RTB, 
many of the traditionally "exclusive" publishers are putting their inventory up 
for auction, allowing all parties to benefit. The resultant platform is 
sophisticated, universal and creates opportunities for all involved: buyers can 
now easily purchase across premium siteswithout juggling multiple publisher 
orders

, while the advertiser benefits from myriad targeting and optimisation.

Display has historically been associated, paradoxically, with poor 
viewability. Ads bought programmatically result inaround 54% "out-of-view" 
impressions 
<https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Viewability_Benchmarks_Show_Many_Ads_Are_Not_In-View_but_Rates_Vary_by_Publisher>
, so it is little wonder that brand marketers gravitated toward big-name 
publications on and offline. But this is changing.

With the Internet Advertising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/advertising> Bureau (IAB) announcing 
new trading standards for viewability, there is more pressure than ever for 
networks, supply side platforms (SSPs) and publishers to give advertisers what 
they want: guaranteed viewable ads. And it is the ability to trade on 
viewability that makes this possible.

So how can marketers run a successful RTB brand campaign?

1. Reach
RTB gives brand advertisers access to millions of users instantly across both 
private and public ad exchanges – there are no restrictions on how many unique 
users you can reach when buying individual sites.

2. Targeting
How do you know you're targeting the right people? Uniquely, RTB permits 
trading on an impression-by-impression basis rather than the traditional cost 
per mille (CPM), which minimises wastage considerably. Using a partner with the 
right technology allows you to achieve a tightly targeted campaign with access 
to any of these parameters:

• Demographics: comScore <http://www.comscore.com/> and others have brought 
offline data to the web, enabling marketers to target by gender, age, household 
income and social grade.
• Interest: audience interest profiles are key to identifying target users, 
choosing a provider with proprietary data on a large majority of your core 
market(s) is crucial.
• Location: geo-location can be vital for some advertisers – targeting to 
postcode level with companies such asDigital Element 
<http://www.digitalelement.com/> promises up to 95% accuracy.
• Psychographic: many suppliers offer a range of psychographic data enabling 
you to reach your core audience using traditional offline definitions.

3. Creative
Ads that have impact and can be bought at scale are key – formats that are 
readily available through exchanges are ideal as they give the greatest reach.

Non-expanding IAB-standard rich media creative offers maximum reach and 
targeting while the video element ups the ante in the engagement stakes. 
Utilising converted TV campaigns for web ads can create effective and cohesive 
campaigns, while expanding rich media can be used for ultimate interactivity 
and user engagement. Whatever format you choose, build in HTML5 to get full 
functionality on tablets and mobile too – these account for a huge proportion 
of your audience.

4. Inventory quality
As revealed earlier, the accessibility of premium inventory is on the up. 
Publishers want to cash in on the RTB exchange, and that's great news for brand 
advertisers.

With an ocean of inventory available, good content verification will pay 
dividends. Look for these capabilities from your provider: URL visibility, 
brand safety, viewability and media quality.

5. Viewability
"A viewable ad is a unit that is 50% viewable, for one second." (IAB 
<http://www.iabuk.net/about/press/archive/iab-lifts-advisory-against-trading-on-viewable-impressions-for-display>
). With new approved trading guidelines, the IAB has paved the way for a new 
currency for brands advertising online: CPV (cost per view). This metric allows 
branding campaigns to be bought on the "opportunity to see" – just like 
traditional branding ads on TV.

To summarise, real time branding, executed well, is a brand campaign unlike 
any other. Not confined to the pokey corridors of fixed site lists, this new 
breed of advertising allows brands to spread their wings without fear of 
injury. It allows them to navigate safely and quickly to the right person, in 
the right place, at the right time – with increasing efficiency, something to 
which no individual publisher can ever lay claim.
