Burkina Faso <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso> beat Ghana on 
penalties to reach their first Africa Cup of Nations final in a stunning upset 
on Wednesday, coming from behind to draw 1-1 after 120 minutes and then sending 
the four-times champions crashing out 3-2 in the shootout.

Three Ghanaians failed with their spot kicks, with the Burkina Faso 
goalkeeper, Daouda Diakit√©, pulling off the decisive save from Emmanuel 
Agyemang Badu to send the underdogs through to Sunday's final against Nigeria 
at Soccer City.

The Burkinabes did not even need to take their last kick as Ghana's players 
failed dramatically at the end, having led the second semi-final at Mbombela 
Stadium through Wakaso Mubarak's 13th-minute penalty.

But Burkina Faso, playing in only their second semi-final and their first in 
15 years, dragged themselves back into the game with Aristide Bance's equaliser 
in the 60th minute and then unleashed a succession of attacks against the 
fading Ghanaians in extra time.

While Burkina Faso celebrated their biggest footballing achievement, Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> again missed out painfully. They 
last won the title in 1982 and made the last four in the past four tournaments, 
only to fail in the late stages.
