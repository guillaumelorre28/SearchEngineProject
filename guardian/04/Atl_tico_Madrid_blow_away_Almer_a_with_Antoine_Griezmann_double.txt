Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> showed 
the intensity that was missing in their defeat last weekend by Celta Vigo and 
victory over Almería never looked in doubt after Mario Mandzukic scored a 
13th-minute penalty following a foul by Tomer Hemed on Diego Godín.

Mandzukic was then twice the provider for a clinical Antoine Griezmann, who 
struck after 20 and 29 minutes before Atlético eased off in the second half.

In injury time, the Atlético full-back Guilherme Siqueira was dismissed after 
receiving a second yellow card for handball.

The result moved Atlético within four points of the leaders, Real Madrid, who 
play their game in hand at Elche on Sunday.
