Dev Hynes continues our 24 Plays of Christmas with a nine-song tracklist  
<http://open.spotify.com/user/dominorecords/playlist/2TVbFb2dy03o20IRyVbmzT>
that aims to soothe your soul. Here's what he had to say ...

"This playlist is based around relaxing. It's for when you're in the mood for 
something melodic yet soothing. I tried to pick a range of genres, but I could 
definitely see myself listening to all of these in the same afternoon."
