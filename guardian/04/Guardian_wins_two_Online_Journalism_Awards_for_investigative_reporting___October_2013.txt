The Guardian has won two Online Journalism Awards 
<http://journalists.org/2013/10/19/guardian-boston-globe-axisphilly-texas-tribune-take-home-2013-online-journalism-awards/>
 for its coverage of the NSA leaks.

At a ceremony in Atlanta organised by the Online News Association 
<http://journalists.org/about/>, the Guardian was awarded the Gannett 
Foundation Award for Investigative Journalism and the Watchdog Journalism Award.

Guardian US editor in chief Janine Gibson, said: "We're very proud to accept 
these awards from the ONA and the Gannett Foundation. It means a great deal to 
have the endorsement of our peers in the US media and we are thankful for their 
support.

"These awards are significant, not just to our team who have worked 
relentlessly for months on this story, but because they recognise the 
importance of difficult watchdog journalism in the public interest."

The Online News Association was founded in 1999 and has more than 2,000 
members around the world.
