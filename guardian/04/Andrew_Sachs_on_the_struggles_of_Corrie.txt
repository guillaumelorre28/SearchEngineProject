Spare a thought for Andrew Sachs. No, nothing to do with Jonathan Ross, 
Russell Brand or his granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. No, seriously. It's just 
that, with his new job on ITV1'sCoronation Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street>, he's having a bit 
of trouble remembering all his new colleagues' names. "Since on the payroll 
there are about 70 actors, I try to learn at least some of their names, which 
means learning the character's name and who's playing it, which is 140 names, 
so it's a wonder I can't learn my lines as well. I look in the mirror and 
wonder who it is!" Not that the former Fawlty Towers star, who plays Ramsay 
Clegg, half brother of corner shop assistant Norris Cole, isn't enjoying 
himself. Far from it. Just don't ask him what time of day it is. "I'm very 
happy to be there, it's such a lovely company. The atmosphere there is 
terrific, I have to say, unexpectedly so. But it's very confusing. Not so much 
the role, but trying to work out what episode you're in, what scene you're 
doing next, and it all goes out of order. And I don't know where I am, so I'm 
always checking and double-checking... should I be up in Manchester, no, that's 
tomorrow. So it's all going on. But I'm getting there â€“ it takes about three or 
four weeks."
