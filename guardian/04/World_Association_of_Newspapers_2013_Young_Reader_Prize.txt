The Guardian Education Centre <https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre> 
has been awarded with a World Young Reader Prize, hosted by the World 
Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA).

The Guardian Education Centre was awarded the top prize in the 'enduring 
excellence category' for its facilities and commitment to educating students 
and children.

Funded by the Guardian Foundation, the Guardian Education Centre provides a 
range of workshops to enable visitors to interact with the news and to get a 
realistic understanding of what it is like to work in a busy news gathering 
organisation. Since it opened in 2002 94,000 visitors have taken part in our 
news and multimedia workshops and activities.

Judges said that the centre's work was incredibly impressive and important and 
demonstrated a wonderul commitment to educating the young in the workings of a 
media company and journalism.

The World Young Reader prize honours excellence across the media industry in 
engaging the young in newspapers and journalism. The awards are decided by a 
panel of expert judges and will be given out at the Young Engagement Summit in 
December.
