 ‘Highly recommended’: Annie Siddons’s How (Not) to Live in Suburbia. 
Photograph: Claire Nolan 
I saw this play by Annie Siddons at the Summerhall in Edinburgh. Siddons was 
raised in London, then when she moved out to Twickenham her marriage broke up 
and she found herself there with two small children and no friends. It’s about 
coping with loneliness, really. To preserve their privacy the children were 
represented by two olive trees, because they put down shallow roots and need 
looking after – that was very funny and clever. It’s a show about parenting as 
much as anything, and I’ve got two small children of my own. Highly recommended!

So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-is-shame-necessary-jennifer-jacquet-review-think-before-you-tweet>
 by Jon Ronson

I’m a big Jon Ronson <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jon-ronson> fan and 
I try to read all his books and watch his documentaries. What he’s done with 
this book is look at people who have been taken apart on social media; people 
going about their lives, putting up a tweet and before they know it they’ve 
gone viral and everything’s ruined for them. Rather than giving ourselves a 
platform for freedom of expression, we are creating an environment where 
everybody’s cowering in fear of being pursued by an angry pitchfork cyber-mob. 
I speak as somebody who was on Twitter for a while and now doesn’t go near it 
because of the toxicity of much of what’s on there.

 Documentary film Peace Officer. 
I was touring my standup in New Zealand at the same time as the international 
film festival, and watched a few films while I was there. I saw this 
documentary, which follows the founder of Utah’s first Swat unit. He 
investigates the death of his son-in-law and other shootings related to an 
increase in violent Swat team raids. He thinks the deaths were unnecessary and 
presents a compelling case, but also has sympathy with the officers who are 
putting their lives on the line. I found it very interesting because although 
it’s not a film motivated by race relations, the victims all happen to be 
white. When there is much publicity rightly being given toBlack Lives Matter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/06/black-lives-matter-uk-found-vital-social-justice>
, it’s an interesting parallel issue.

This vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh is one of my favourites. I don’t eat 
meat – I do eat seafood sometimes, but usually because there isn’t a good 
vegetarian option. Everyone should try veggie food. If you think it’s only for 
vegetarians you’re making a big mistake. The dishes are always quite 
surprising, they do some quite clever and inventive things on the menu, but 
equally they’ll do you some stir fry, noodles and veg. It’s a classy, upmarket 
kind of place, but entirely unpretentious. I wish there was one on every street 
corner in the country.

The best novel I’ve read in the past 12 months is Gone With the Wind. The 
reason I read it is interesting: my mum died when I was six, and on her bedside 
table was a copy ofGone With the Wind, which was left there by my dad. It was 
her favourite book. When I was growing up it was thought of as a woman’s book, 
therefore not of interest to me. It’s written by a woman and the central 
character is a woman, but it’s about the history of racial tension in the US. I 
was expecting some elongated Mills & Boon scenario and I found something 
profoundly interesting about a period of history that I’m quite interested in. 
It’s a broad, sweeping novel, an epic of Dickensian scale, and I had no idea.

 ‘Quite sardonic’: Will Franken 
He was the best comedian I saw at the Edinburgh fringe this year. You can’t 
really describe it as standup because he does so many different voices, and 
goes off on so many tangents. It’s quite a sardonic approach. Sometimes you see 
a comedian who has so much talent and such little recognition, you feel like 
there’s an imbalance in the world. Some people are so inventive that it makes 
them almost inaccessible to a wider audience, but I thought he was a brilliant 
comic.

 ‘A fantastic place’: Glasgow film theatre. Photograph: Alamy 
I’ve just been filming a Jonathan Creek Christmas special based in Glasgow. I 
didn’t know about the Glasgow film theatre, but I stumbled upon it quite early 
in my stay and what a fantastic place it is. I sawBorn to Be Blue, the Chet 
Baker biopic, as well as this Danish film,The Commune, which was compelling. At 
work the director would say, “What did you do last night?” I’d say, “I went to 
the GFT again!” You can sit there with a merlot and watch this amazing film and 
you’re really comfortable.
