Three years ago she was a truckdriver's daughter in smalltown Louisiana; now, 
the other side of an Oscar nomination for best actress, she's likely to be the 
mainstay of a potential Christmas blockbuster. And she's still only 10.
Quvenzhan√© Wallis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/25/quvenzhane-wallis-annie-remake>' 
acting career is nothing short of miraculous, so it's probably appropriate that 
she's the star of a remake ofAnnie 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_%281982_film%29>, which Columbia is aiming 
at the this year's American festive season market.

The trailer has just been released, so what can we deduce? Well, it's been 
thoroughly updated to a contemporary feeling, withJamie Foxx 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/jamie-foxx-django-unchained-angry>
 stepping into what we can call theAlbert Finney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/Player/Player_Page/0,,45377,00.html> role, 
and Wallis chirping away as the plucky little orphanage dweller. Foxx isn't 
just a lonely billionaire though; his relationship with Annie has been retooled 
around a PR campaign for political office, and this is how Wallis gets a taste 
of the life of the modern super-rich.

No doubt inspired by the Jazy-Z version of Hard Knock Life 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxtn6-XQupM>, this is frantically selling 
itself as brightly coloured fun for all the family. What do you think?
