There is a temptation to play safe when money gets tight. In areas such as 
adult social care, the focus could easily switch to keeping staff in jobs, 
rather than making sure that people get the services they need.

We must ensure that the momentum that is building behind personalisation isn't 
lost. In the short term, individual budgets may well end up costing more. Yet 
the long-term impact is potentially enormous – both on people's wellbeing and 
in financial terms. Instead of pointing to the occasional seemingly generous 
individual budget, we should focus on the "failure demand" that exists in the 
social care system – demand that wouldn't be there if more people were just 
given what they want and need first time round.

Procurement is another key area. If the past 12 months have taught us 
anything, it is that we should challenge economic orthodoxies. One such 
orthodoxy – economies of scale – ignores the diseconomies that come from 
bundling services into massive contracts, which only big businesses, distant 
from the people who should be served, can win. Procurement, when it comes down 
to it, is just the state's way of shopping – and it's vital that the state 
becomes a smarter shopper.
