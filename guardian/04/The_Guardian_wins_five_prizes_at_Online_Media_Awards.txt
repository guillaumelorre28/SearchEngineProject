The Guardian won website of the year and four other awards at the 2014 Online 
MediaAwards <https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards> in central 
London on Wednesday 11 June.

theguardian.com <https://www.theguardian.com/international> won the grand 
prix, also taking away the prizes for outstanding digital team of the year and 
best national/world news site â€“ beating competitors such as the International 
New York Times, Al-Jazeera, Vice and the Wall Street Journal.

The Guardian's revelations about NSA and GCHQ surveillance, based on documents 
leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, took away the award for best 
campaigning or investigative journalism. Ewen MacAskill, one of the reporters 
who broke the story, collected the award on behalf of the paper, which won the 
Pulitzer prize for the scoop earlier this year.

The Guardian's live blogs won in the best commentary or blogging category. Its 
crowdsourcing app GuardianWitness was commended and the website's fashion team 
was also nominated.
