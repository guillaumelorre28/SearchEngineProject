Eugene O’Neill: A Life in Four Acts by Robert Dowling (2014) 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/eugene-o-neill-420215.html>

This is the most recent biography of [US playwright] Eugene O’Neill. Dowling 
had access to previously unpublished material: letters and manuscripts as well 
as things like wonderful photographs of O’Neill’s time at the Provincetown 
playhouse. They were doing some of his plays in a fisherman’s shack on the 
beach, and water was coming up under the floorboards. It’s a comprehensive 
biography. The previously unpublished stuff is fascinating, including on 
O’Neill’s drinking and the circuitous route he took to become a playwright. It 
makes you realise his plays are very autobiographical, particularly the later 
ones, which was a real eye-opener. It’s what made his plays so dense and so 
rich, I think.

This is in a small town called North Adams, which used to be a mill town. When 
the industry went away all these mills and warehouses were empty, and there’s a 
gentrification process going on. One of the first things to move in was the 
Museum of ContemporaryArt <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art>. They 
bought this huge factory building and have turned it into a fantastic art 
collection, filled with Rothkos and Pollocks. They’ve managed to preserve the 
integrity of the original building; very much like Tate Modern in London, it 
still looks like what it was originally, but inside there’s this feast of 
contemporary art. I’ve been twice, there’s so much to take in – you need time, 
and good museums are always worth revisiting anyway.

A Hero in France by Alan Furst (2016) 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hero-in-france.html>

I encountered Furst when I saw The Polish Officer 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/polish-officer.html> on someone’s desk and 
got curious.A Hero in France is a novel about the resistance in Paris at the 
beginning of the second world war. Furst creates these fantastic pictures: the 
detail about the smells and sounds and feel of walking along cobbled streets in 
the dark, and the noise it makes, clattering and echoing. He has fantastically 
rich and varied characters. He catches speech patterns very accurately, so 
you’re completely in there. I’ve got a soft spot for spy novels. I grew up 
readingJohn le Carré <https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnlecarre> and Eric 
Ambler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/06/eric-ambler-mask-dimitrios-journey-fear>
, so it’s right in my wheelhouse, as they say.

 Between Hall & Oates and Otis Redding: Mayer Hawthorne. 
I love music – it’s always on in the car or when I’m working around the house. 
I’ve been listening to this guy a lot recently. He’s not a brand-new artist – 
his first album came out in 2009 – but he’s new to me and he’s really 
fantastic. Like a magpie, he’s taken all these flavours and influences from 
different genres and mashed them all up with a wonderful new, modern 
sensibility in terms of the lyrical content and the way he sings. You listen to 
one album and think, “That sounds a bit like Hall & Oates,” or “That sounds a 
bit like Otis Redding.” It’s really interesting. His albumMan About Town is 
really fantastic.

 An American Daughter by Wendy Wasserstein at Williamstown theatre festival. 
Photograph: T Charles Erickson Photography 
This is the last play I saw. It was a revival of a play by Wendy Wasserstein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/01/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries>
, which is about 20 years old, about a woman who has been appointed surgeon 
general, and how the media and people in her family sabotage her professional 
chances. The play asks “Can a woman really have it all? Can she have a career 
and a family?” It’s interesting, 20 years ago this was a very hot topic, and I 
think it still is. It’s very prescient and timely, especially when we’ve got 
Hillary Clinton hopefully about to become the first female president of the 
United States.

I’d never seen this before, and it’s one of those movies you always hear 
about. It’s about the corrosive quality of ambition and how it can kill you; 
it’s a wonderful morality tale about its dangers. An older actress who is still 
at the prime of her career befriends a younger actress who seems to want to 
learn everything she can, but turns out to be incredibly ambitious and prepared 
to do almost anything to take her place. It’s a great movie in terms of the 
pressures that female actors particularly are under when it comes to getting 
older. It’s a pressure men don’t feel in the same way.

This is my favourite restaurant in LA, right on Sunset Boulevard. It’s a 
funky, unpretentious place with a great little menu. It’s kind of European with 
an American twist; they do great pastas and pizza but they’ve also got things 
like omelettes and breakfasts. I discovered it in 2007 when I was getting ready 
to leave for a big job in Europe, and I was packing and treated myself to a 
really nice lunch there. I couldn’t wait to get back and I’ve been a regular 
customer since. I donated a painting to them a few years ago. It feels a little 
bit like someone’s back room; it’s got that kind of feel.
