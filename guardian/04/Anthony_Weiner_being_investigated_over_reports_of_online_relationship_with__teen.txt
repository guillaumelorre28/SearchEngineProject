Disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner is being investigated by the 
New York police department and also reportedly by the federal authorities after
reports 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-latest-sexting-scandal-probed-nypd-article-1.2802042>
 emerged that he was allegedly conducting an online sexual relationship with a 
15-year-old in another state earlier this year.


Weiner, whose career previously nosedived after he was caught sending sexually 
explicit texts and images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york>
 to women while he was still married, allegedly spent several months this year 
in highly explicit exchanges with the 15-year-old girl.


The former politician and failed New York mayoral candidate asked her to 
undress for him during a video call and engage in rape fantasies among a 
plethora of explicit exchanges that began in January 2016, the Daily Mail
reported

 on Wednesday.

Weiner is still married to Huma Abedin, Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and campaign vice-chairman, although the two 
are now separated.

A spokesman for the NYPD <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nypd> confirmed 
on Thursday afternoon that Weiner, 51, who lives in the city, was under 
investigation.

“We are aware of the allegations against him and we are looking into it,” the 
spokesman said, without releasing any further details.

The girl in question had given a lengthy interview, accompanied by her father, 
to the Daily Mail and provided pictures and other records of messages she says 
she exchanged with Weiner.

Federal prosecutors at the US attorney’s office in New York declined to 
comment and an inquiry to the FBI office inNew York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> was not immediately returned, 
but if the alleged suspect was in one state and the alleged victim was in 
another, that would trigger the involvement of federal authorities in a 
criminal investigation.

“A situation such as this could involve an array of crimes, depending on what 
is done and what a minor is asked for,” said John Wilkinson, an attorney 
adviser and former prosecutor with Aequitas, a consultancy and research 
organization that advises on prosecuting violence against women.

Any investigation into Weiner could involve child sex abuse, child 
endangerment or child abuse image statutes, depending on the nature and content 
of the exchanges.

There are also relevant federal laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation of 
children and other statutes involving the transfer of obscene materials to a 
minor. Wilkinson also explained that even if an adult claims a teenager 
initiated contact and they did not realize their young age, that is not 
accepted as a defense in court.

Abedin announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal>
 in August that she was separating from her husband after Weiner wasrevealed in 
another report 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/>
 to have sent another woman a provocative picture of himself in his underwear, 
with his young son next to him.

After the August scandal, Weiner first denied and then admitted 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/nyregion/anthony-weiner-confirms-child-welfare-agency-is->
 that he was being investigated by New York’s child services authorities.

It was but the most recent in a series of scandals involving Weiner.

The couple are apparently still sharing a home in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> and were photographed by the 
Daily Mail leaving separately on Wednesday morning.

Weiner allegedly communicated with the girl, who appeared to live in a state 
other than New York, using Twitter, Skype, Facebook and other digital platforms 
to exchange videos, texts, photographs and have voice calls.

The girl – who was not named in the report in order to protect her identity as 
a minor – reportedly approached the publication and, along with her father, who 
is also not named, gave detailed interviews and shared messages, images and 
screen grabs of communications exchanged with Weiner.

She said she struck up the initial contact with Weiner but discontinued it 
after the August revelation of picturesin the New York Post 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/>
, which he is said to have sent to a 40-year-old woman.

The law of consent in most states is between 16 and 18, although in many 
states teens younger than 16 can have consensual sexual contact with each other 
provided the age gap is not more than four years.

By all accounts Weiner and the 15-year-old did not meet or have any physical 
contact. He allegedly sent her explicitly sexual messages and asked her to 
undress and masturbate over video chat. When an exchange escalated and he 
allegedly tried to engage her in talk of a rape fantasy, she objected and he 
dropped the subject, according to the Daily Mail’s report.

Weiner reportedly admitted to the Daily Mail that he had engaged in 
flirtatious exchanges with the girl but did not comment further on any of the 
specific allegations. He maintained that some of the details may be a hoax.

In some screenshots accompanying the report, Weiner’s picture and name can be 
seen on screen. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Weiner said, in part: “I have 
repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated 
with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken 
for those I have hurt.”

He sent a similar 
<http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/21/new-low-disgraced-dem-anthony-weiner-sorry-after-texts-to-15-year-old-revealed.html>
 statement to Fox News and also apologized for his behavior, while repeating 
that he may be the subject of a hoax.
