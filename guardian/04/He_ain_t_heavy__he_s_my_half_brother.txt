Blood brothers

From a female, aged 40
Dear Carole, I have a son (age 5) and I recently had a baby boy with my new 
partner. My partner and my elder son get along nicely and I hope that we can 
succeed as a family of four. I want my sons to bond, as full blood brothers 
should. Can they do so?

Carole replies:
Your sons have five years of growth separating them. Research suggests that 
sibling rivalry is more common among sibs close in age. Thanks to the age gap 
your sons will occupy different developmental stages and shouldn't become 
rivals for your attention.

On average, wild chimpanzee mothers have four years between offspring, the 
mother breast-feeds for two years and she then supplements her youngster's diet 
with breast milk for another two years. Chimpanzee infants may well have 
different fathers but what unites them is their mum. Chimp siblings have close 
familial bonds, they spend time grooming one another, playing, sharing food and 
defending each other. They take an interest in one another throughout their 
lives, which can be more than 50 years in the wild.

Goodall's famed chimp Flo, was an Alpha female and mother par excellence. Flo 
spent a great deal of time grooming her children and playing with them. She was 
endlessly patient, never admonishing them when they were under four years. Over 
the decades and through political upheavals, Flo retained her social position 
(and thus her access to resources), her sons became dominant males and her 
daughter Fifi rose to an even higher social rank than Flo.

Thus, Flo didn't just pass on her good genes, she taught her progeny the 
importance of social politics: friends in high places can help you survive and 
occupying a high social rank will enhance your reproductive fitness. And once 
her sons had become dominant males, they protected their old mum from 
aggressive strangers.

Despite having different biological fathers, your sons have 25% of their genes 
in common. Living with you means they also have nurture and the environment in 
common. Shared time and common ground helps primates to bond. If they share 
personality traits this will mean similarities in, for example, their sense of 
humor, love of sport, or interest in stamp collecting. Your sons are more 
likely voluntarily to share time in later life if they enjoyed doing so when 
young.

Your family resources (love, time and money) need to be openly shared between 
your sons. No doubt caring for them and supporting their bond is something that 
will occupy you for many years to come. You could encourage big brother to be 
involved in the grooming of little brother, perhaps with hair washing and skin 
moisturising, and in time the youngest should reciprocate.

With a devoted dad in the mix the future looks bonded.

Pray for creationists

From Alfred, no age given
Dear Carole, There are plenty of people who believe in God and see evolution 
as evidence of his divine plan. This is all right for now in my opinion – 
Einstein and Stephen Hawking have used God as a metaphor. But WHAT IS THE DEAL 
with thesefundamentalists 
<http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2010/01/05/evolutionary-problem-column>
, and, short of learning how to field-strip an assault rifle, what can I do to 
stop them lying to children?

Carole replies:
I understand your frustration. More than 80 years of scientific endeavour has 
taken place sinceThe Scopes Monkey Trial 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial> in 1926. Geneticists have confirmed 
that chimpanzee and bonobos are our closest living relatives and that they are 
genetically closer to humans than they are to gorillas or orang-utans. The 
Human Genome Project is almost complete, we know from mitochonrial DNA that we 
can all trace our roots back to Africa. Ancestral hominid fossils, such as the 
Laetoli footprints (Australopithecus afarensis), the "hobbit" (Homo 
floresiensis), and Ardi (Ardipithecus ramidus) are just three of the many 
fascinating palaeontological discoveries made since 1926.

In short, the evidence that Charles Darwin was right and that natural 
selection is indeed the process by which humans (and all other life on Earth) 
have evolved is irrefutable. Yet the present climate of religious 
fundamentalism suggests that another Scopes Monkey Trial could be just around 
the corner.

You ask what you can do to stop creationists lying to children. You are one 
person, creationists and the children over whom they have influence are many. 
Perhaps you can find consolation in the fact that while science, by its nature, 
is cutting edge – it evolves, expands and self-corrects – religion does not. 
Thus, one day these ever-accumulating pieces of evolutionary evidence will 
swamp the static God fiction.

Hallelujah! Praise be to Darwin.
