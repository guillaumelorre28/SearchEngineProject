The Nigerian government has come under fire after plans to send 20 politicians 
- all expenses paid - to the African Cup of Nations were discovered.

Phonelines on Lagos-based Brila FM's regular phone-in were jammed with calls 
from listener demanding that the trip be cancelled.

"They're going there to waste Nigeria's taxpayers money when many of us are 
swimming in poverty," said Jones Afebi, a Nigeria fan.

The total cost of the trip is estimated at $400,000 - that's $20,000 per head 
- a far cry from the average monthly wage of Nigerians, which sits at $50.

Fears that politics will seep into team affairs have also been raised: "They 
should watch the matches on television at home and not go and cause 
distractions in the camp like (they did) in Mali," another fan warned.

Nigeria will hope to avoid the kind of political and in-fighting that 
accompanied their 2002 campaign in Mali, where they were knocked out by Senegal 
in the semi-finals.
