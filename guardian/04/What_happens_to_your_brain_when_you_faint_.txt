Hillary Clinton’s stumble at a 9/11 anniversary ceremony last Sunday may have 
been pounced on by her critics, but many also pointed out that she still 
managed to fulfil her obligations despite suffering from pneumonia.

The knees buckling, as Clinton’s did, is a classic symptom of fainting. Weak 
and wobbly legs might seem to be caused by the reduction in blood pressure that 
often results in fainting. But, in fact, this lack of oxygen being pumped 
around the body does not affect the limbs directly. Instead, it’s a reaction 
sparked by the brain to ensure its own survival, as limited oxygen supply is so 
dangerous. If the brain is starved of oxygen for more than a minute or two it 
is irreversibly damaged.

While fainting carries the risk of hitting your head, evolution has judged a 
potential knock to be less dangerous than the threat of oxygen starvation. So, 
the brain sends a signal to the leg muscles to stop working. This gets the head 
closer to the level of the heart quickly, where less pumping effort is needed 
to receive a life-saving supply of blood. Ironically this is exactly the kind 
of tough call a future commander in chief might be called upon to make.
