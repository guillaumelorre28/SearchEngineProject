A $83,536 luggage lift has been installed into the prime minister’s Canberra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra> residence at taxpayers’ 
expense.

The lift was part of a $150,000 renovation of the Lodge, the true cost of 
which has been revealed on Monday by answers to Senate estimates.

Labor has also used Senate estimates to criticise the lack of checks on the 
use of WhatsApp by ministers and government staff

The deputy secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 
Elizabeth Kelly, told estimates on Monday the luggage lift had been installed 
to protect staff.

“The stairs are of an unusual depth, so we have had a member of the staff 
injure herself on the stairwell,” she said.

Kelly said the lift also protected the heritage value of the stairs. It cost 
$83,536 excluding GST, implying a total cost of $92,818.

Labor’s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said “no other prime minister” had 
needed the lift. Kelly said the luggage lift was part of renovation plans in 
2010 but confirmed that onlyMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> had lived in the 
refurbished Lodge.

The renovation also included $24,680 on upholstery, $22,356 on white goods and 
$18,000 on window soft furnishings. The total cost of refurbishing the Ruth 
Lane Poole lounge and two matching chairs was $11,524.22.

Asked about the reportedly widespread use of WhatsApp by ministers and their 
staff

, the department’s deputy secretary, Allan McKinnon, said he was confident that 
security-cleared staff were aware of their responsibilities.

“It’s not our responsibility to be sitting over ministers’ and 
parliamentarians’ shoulders as they have their communications whether it’s by a 
telephone or app or anything else,” he said.

“I have seen a range of statements by the prime minister which indicates he is 
well aware of his obligations for sensitive and secure information being 
transmitted across a range of platforms … including government systems and his 
own.”

The prime minister’s special adviser on cyber security, Alastair MacGibbon, 
and the attorney general, George Brandis, confirmed they communicate with 
colleagues including Turnbull overWhatsApp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp>. They said the messages did 
not relate to national security or cabinet.

Brandis said the messages were entirely unremarkable but he declined Wong’s 
offer to share them with the public.

The cost of renovations was revealed in answers taken on notice from Senate 
estimates in February which were not provided until Monday, just hours before 
the start of new hearings.

Wong expressed “disappointment at the discourtesy” shown by the department in 
returning the supplementary answers late.

The Senate finance and public administration legislation committee had set 14 
September as the date for the answers’ return.

Kelly said the tardiness was due to the caretaker period. Wong said that as a 
courtesy the committee did not call the departmental secretary, Martin 
Parkinson, but would do so if answers were not more timely.
