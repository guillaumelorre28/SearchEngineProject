The Australia captain, Stephen Moore, says that England deserved their 
unprecedented series whitewash

 because they have “played well all year” but the hooker is confident the 
Wallabies’ collective self-belief will not be dented despite their worst home 
series defeat in 45 years.

Moore thought England’s sturdy defence was key to the tourists’ series win, 
but also cited his own team’s deficiencies without the ball as Eddie Jones’s 
side broke several records in their first series win down under – including 
posting a highest score in the country on two separate occasions,in the opening

 and Saturday’s third Test.

“It’s been a tough series,” Moore said. “We’ve given up 44 points, you just 
can’t give up that many points and win the game. There were some good things we 
have done through the series. We’ve got to keep that belief in the team and we 
have a lot of footy left this year.

“To England’s credit they deserved it. They played well. There’s no doubt 
about that. They deserved to win the series and have played well all year. We 
just weren’t quite good enough in this series and there are things we need to 
do a bit better. We will get on and do that now. I thought we stuck to our 
gameplan much better tonight – that’s a positive. And England didn’t give us 
much chance in attack, they defended really well.”

Despite his attempts to remain optimistic about the future, Moore called on 
frustrated Australia supporters to keep supporting the team. The Wallaby 
players will return to their Super Rugby clubs on Monday before regrouping in 
preparation for the Rugby Championship, which begins with a daunting double 
header against New Zealand on 20 and 27 August.

Moore added: “We will go away from here, we are a really tight group. We have 
a lot of footy left. The fans have been terrific all season. All I can say to 
them is stick with us, we will be working hard to improve. We’ll dust off and 
go again at our clubs on Monday.”
