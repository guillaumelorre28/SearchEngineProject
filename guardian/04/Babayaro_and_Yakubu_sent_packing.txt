Premiership pair Celestine Babayaro and Aiyegbeni Yakubu have been thrown out 
of the Nigeria's African Nations Cup squad for indiscipline. Chelsea defender 
Babayaro, Portsmouth striker Yakubu and Schalke's Victor Agali have all been 
asked to leave the team camp in Tunisia.

Nigeria were preparing at their Monastir base for their second match of the 
tournament against South Africa. "They did not respect the rules of the camp, 
they were supposed to be in quarters with the rest of the squad," Taiwo 
Obunjobi, general secretary of the Nigerian Football Association, told French 
sports newspaper L'Equipe. "They only returned to the hotel this Friday morning.

"We have informed the team through the captain, Jay-Jay Okocha, and have 
received the approval of the sports minister and it was decided that discipline 
must be maintained and the players involved leave the camp immediately."

Nigeria lost their opening game 1-0 to Morocco on Tuesday, and now face a 
must-win encounter against Bafana Bafana if they want to progress.
