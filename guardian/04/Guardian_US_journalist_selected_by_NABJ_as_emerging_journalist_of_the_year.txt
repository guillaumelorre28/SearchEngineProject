.

Commenting on the award Lartey said “All individual awards are really the 
reflection of a group effort and nothing in my young journalism career could 
have been accomplished without the mentoring and support of the people I work 
with at the Guardian US. I’m thrilled and humbled by the opportunity to go 
forward and try to prove the NABJ right for seeing that potential in me, and to 
tell important stories - specifically as they pertain to black and African 
descended people.”
