A British bank holiday usually calls for a trip to the ice cream van, even if 
there is more drizzle than dazzling sunshine. But go easy - a big bite of 
a 99 Flake can quickly give you a headache, sometimes known as ‘brain freeze’.

While this name describes the feeling, it’s wrong, as the brain doesn’t have 
any pain receptors of its own. So why does a cold sensation in the mouth lead 
to pain in the head?

The long trigeminal nerve picks up sensations from the mouth, nose, teeth and 
forehead. A sudden chill causes blood vessels in the roof of the mouth to 
constrict and dilate, sending pain signals through the trigeminal nerve to the 
brain.

But this pain is felt in the forehead instead of the mouth. This could be 
because the forehead is more exposed to the outside world, so the brain assumes 
the signal is coming from there instead. This phenomenon is known as ‘referred 
pain’, and is also seen in heart attacks, when pain is felt in the shoulders or 
back. Luckily ‘brain freeze’ only lasts a few seconds and can be easily ended 
by swallowing quickly – at least until your next bite.
