Senior Guardian reporter Ian Cobain has won this year's Martha Gellhorn prize 
for journalism for a series of pieces on British involvement in the overseas 
torture of terrorism suspects. The judges said: "Ian Cobain's remarkable series 
in the Guardian linked not only MI5 but government policy with collusion in 
torture. This was investigative journalism at its finest. Cobain's determined, 
forensic and courageous work revealed a deep political and moral corruption at 
the heart of British executive power."

The prize is awarded in honour of one of the 20th century's greatest reporters 
to what the organisers describe as "a journalist whose work has penetrated the 
established version of events and told an unpalatable truth that exposes 
establishment propaganda, or 'official drivel', as Martha Gellhorn called it".
