Though a relatively short walk, the ascent to Cleveland's most famous hill can 
be a challenge. It is a fascinating place to explore for its human and 
geological history, as well as its abundant wildlife. But it's the views from 
the top that will give you most reward for your efforts; the coastline, across 
the North York Moors and down onto industrial Teesside – a rich and varied 
landscape that's unveiled before you.

While most visitors to Roseberry Topping head straight for the hill, there's 
plenty to see in the woods too. Newton Woods, just below it, is a wonderful 
place to walk and will take you to some of the best wildlife spotting 
opportunities. A haven for birds, look out for blue tits during April and May 
bringing caterpillars back for their chicks or listen out for the call of the 
green woodpecker; it's quite distinctive, sounding like hoarse laughter. And of 
course, in late spring Newton Woods is an amazing place to see carpets of 
bluebells as the ground is awash with colour.

Take a walk along the Yorkshire coastline to Boggle Hole from Robin Hood's Bay 
– across the clifftops or the beach (at low tide only) and then return along 
the old railway back to your starting point. If the tide is low enough to walk 
the beach, take some time to look for fossils or in the rock pools.

Soak up the views as you discover Ravenscar, past and present, on this short 
walk. The little village boasts stunning views of the Yorkshire coastline 
across to Robin Hood's Bay. On this circular walk, you'll take in the old peak 
alum works but also have the option to find a wealth of flora and fauna – from 
bluebells in late spring to butterflies in summer. Keep an eye out for adders 
and damselflies too.

Take a walk from the top of Sutton Bank, with panoramic views across to 
Kilburn Woods. The woodland walk will take you along the old thieves' highway – 
once a quick getaway for highway robbers from the nearby drovers and stagecoach 
roads. You'll also walk past the white horse, which isn't as old as other 
landmarks across the country – it dates back to 1857.

Much of the North York Moors is farmland, with dry-stone walls, hedges and 
open moorland marking out the landscape. Look closely at the dry-stone walls 
and you may be able to spot fossil shells in amongst the stones. This walk will 
take you along footpaths and country lanes – in the summer, look out for 
wildflowers, buzzing bees and buttlerflies.

Rievaulx Terrace is perfect for a gentle walk. These 18th-century landscape 
gardens were created for unwinding, relaxing and for spending time with others. 
In Ryedale, boasting views across the Hambleton Hills and down to Rievaulx 
Abbey, a walk along the Terrace will give you unrivalled views of the 
surrounding countryside and, if you're lucky, a glimpse of the wildlife that 
makes this Georgian landscape its home.

In the heart of Ryedale, not far from Helmsley, is the village of Nunnington. 
The hall, owned by the National Trust is just one reason to find your way to 
this part of Yorkshire, but be sure to explore the village and surrounding area 
a little wider too. Rievaulx Terrace is just eight miles away and itself boasts 
unrivalled views of the Hambleton Hills and Rievaulx Abbey.

Hutton-le-Hole sits within the North York Moors national park and, according 
to their walking guide, in Victorian England it was described as "an 
ill-planned and untidy" village. Thankfully, times and opinions have changed 
and it now recognised as one of Britain's most beautiful and picturesque. A 
circular walk towards Spaunton will help you escape into the national park and 
across fields and country tracks.
