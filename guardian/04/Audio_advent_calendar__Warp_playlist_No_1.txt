Not to be outdone by Domino's playlist yesterday, Warp continues our 24 plays 
of Christmas (basically an audio adventure with a sonic treat each day) with
their own playlist.

Here's what they had to say ...

Warp is a kind of ever-evolving organism, and to give a succinct overview of 
what we do in just 12 songs is tricky. Rather than reaching (and failing) to be 
definitive, this is hopefully an interesting, frosty glimpse of some members of 
the family you'll recognise and some you may not ... but should."
