Alan Moore’s second novel Jerusalem – a fantastical exploration of his 
hometown ofNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/northampton> which 
runs to more than a million words in draft form – is slated for publication 
next spring.

Describing the novel as Moore’s “best work to date, rich and glorious”, Tony 
Bennett at UK publisher Knockabout Comics said: “We expect that it will be a 
spring 2016 title, published in the UK at the same time as in North America.” A 
“firm announcement” about publication date will be made late this year, Bennett 
added, with the book “currently undergoing editing and proofreading”.

Liveright will publish the book in the US, according to the New York Times 
<http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/alan-moores-graphic-novel-jerusalem-coming-in-2016>
, and Bennett said that “rights have been sold to Italy and Brazil with other 
territories in discussion” at present.

The acclaimed comics writer began work on Jerusalem in 2008 and finished his 
gargantuan draft last September, as his daughter Leah Mooreannounced on Facebook

.

The novel is said to explore the small area of Northampton where Moore grew 
up, ranging from his own family’s stories to historical events to fantasy, with 
chapters told in different voices. The author told the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/helen-lewis-hasteley/2011/06/alan-moore-novel-jerusalem>
 that there would be a “Lucia Joyce chapter, which is completely 
incomprehensible ... all written in a completely invented sub-Joycean text”, 
while another chapter would be written in the style of a Samuel Beckett play, 
and a third would be “a noir crime narrative based upon the Northampton pastor 
James Hervey, whom I believe was the father of the entire Gothic movement”.

He told the BBC <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7307303.stm> that 
the “middle bit” is “a savage, hallucinating Enid Blyton”, andthe Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/22/alan-moore-comic-books-interview>
 that the last “official chapter” was being written “somewhat in the style of 
Dos Passos”.

Moore is best known for comics such as Watchmen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/16/alan-moore-watchmen-lost-girls> 
andV for Vendetta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/14/v-for-vendetta-politcal-resonance>
 which have expanded the possibilities of graphical storytelling. Readers 
looking for further indications of what Jerusalem may hold can turn to his 1996 
novel in prose, Voice of the Fire, which is also set in Northampton. Weaving 
together the stories of 12 different characters over a period of 6,000 years, 
from a cave-boy to a Roman emissary to a crippled nun, the novel opens in 
4000BC.

“A-hind of hill, ways off to sun-set-down, is sky come like as fire, and walk 
I up in way of this, all hard of breath, where is grass colding on I’s feet and 
wetting they,” writes Moore, as he sets in motion a novel described by Neil 
Gaiman as the work of a “master storyteller tak[ing] the voices of the dead as 
his own”.
