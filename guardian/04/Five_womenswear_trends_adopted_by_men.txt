In his latest video On A Level <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRfRzsEhgVQ>, 
Wiley, the world’s most brilliant (and most grumpy) grime artist, is shown 
casually strolling out of his suburban mansion in Nike socks and pool sliders. 
Incidentally, it’s not the first time this unisex look has appeared on an 
unlikely style icon, from David Beckham and Justin Bieberto Kristen Stewart and 
Alexander Wang’s five-year-old niece Aila. And now Wiley. We have arguably 
reached peak sock-and-sandal.


If you’re after a unisex look, here are five ways you might do it:

1. The Wiley look

Christopher Kane showed pool sliders in his spring/summer 2012 womenswear 
collection – reflecting a look that was already popular with internet artists 
and off-duty footballers – and they’ve since started appearing everywhere. If 
you’re after the Wiley look, all you’ll really need arematching socks and 
sliders <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRfRzsEhgVQ>. Most choose Adidas, but 
Wiley chooses Nike as he hangs out in his driveway with his health goth rapper 
mates in all-black sportswear.

That said, just the other day a mate of mine was complaining about “gazing 
miserably into the middle distance in Soho Square, amid the filthy mist and 
pigeon shit, thinking how living in London in 2014 feels like being stuck in 
some perpetual IKEA nightmare, surrounded by bored couples in matching trainers 
glumly traipsing around in circles looking at things they neither need or even 
want to buy”. So if you sympathise with his thoughts yet still wish to stay 
on-trend, you could always resort to the trusted Birkenstocks-and-woolly-socks 
combination. Just don’t wear it round Wiley’s house.

I like: sliders

2. The Juicy look

Today, the Californian dream has turned sour – it’s Lana Del Rey singing sad 
girl songs about death and Kendall Jenner dressing sort of like a goth. But not 
so long ago it was a velour candyland, one symbolised by Paris Hilton in her 
pink Juicy Couture tracksuit. Now, mostly through the efforts of Joey Essex, 
and young designers such as Nasir Mazhar and Astrid Andersen, that velvety look 
has crossed over into menswear.

Most recently Mr Essex turned up at Los Angeles International Airport in an 
all-white Nasir Mazhar tracksuit. Before that he appeared onThis Morning in a 
red velvet jumper and gold chain and, in my opinion, looked rather regal; like 
William III of Orange, or a posh Christmas tree ornament. If you would like to 
look and feel luxurious on the cheap, velour is always a good option.

I like: velour top, £36, from American Apparel

3. The One Direction look

The strangest look to have crossed over from womenswear to menswear, one that 
still flabbergasts me, is leggings and Uggs; or meggings and Muggs, to use the 
masculine parlance. This style has transcended its Sloanie Pony origins and 
somehow found its way on to the legs of lads – yes, lads – as exemplified by 
One Direction singer and heartthrob Louis Tomlinson, who loves to take a stroll 
down the shops in a pair of Ugg boots. Oddly it’s not a look that comes from 
the fashion crowd, but rather one that comes from contemporary British youth 
culture, and the first time I actually encountered it was when I was out 
shopping in the countryside lastChristmas

4. The Rick Owens look

Last of all, dark American-in-Paris designer Rick Owen has popularised the 
wearing of T-shirts so oversized, and tunics so long, that they’re in effect 
dresses for men. The difference though is that you wear them with trousers. 
It’s a straightforward look, and if you have a sudden change of heart, well, 
you only have to tuck your T-shirt in to make it disappear.

I like: long T-shirt, £10, from ASOS

5. The Parisian look

In the fashion world some men have started styling themselves like chic 
Parisian fashion editors, most notably wearing their coats over their shoulders 
like a vampire’s cape; something that any of us can try at home. If you enjoy 
your cape, you only need Google the amazing USVogue contributor “André Leon 
Talley”, or indeed the “Larry David cape”, for a wealth of inspiration.

However, if you’re not that daring just try a stripy T-shirt, which was one of 
many unisex styles that Northern Irish designer JW Anderson experimented with 
in his acclaimed first collection for fashion house Loewe. His silky 
short-sleeved top costs a lot, but of course nice striped Breton shirts are 
available in many shops for a lot less.

I like: striped T-shirt, £650, from Loewe
