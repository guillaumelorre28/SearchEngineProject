This book revolves around a girl called Sophie who doesn’t believe her last 
name is Nieuwenleven. She goes on to tell her story about her family’s move to 
Belgium and in the meantime she is trying to find out the truth to explain her 
parent’s decision to move.

Before starting this book I didn’t know what to expect and you could say I was 
surprised at the outcome. This book is full of discovery about Sophie’s 
background and where she really comes from. The plot opens out as you read on 
in the book and I found myself trapped in Sophie’s world.

The themes of this book are: family, young adult and contemporary. I enjoyed 
the family theme because it made the book more realistic and I was able to 
exactly see how the parents were taking Sophie’s discovery. Moreover I would 
say there is a lot of friendship and discovery. In a way the themes fitted 
together in the book and it made the book a very “deep” read.

One of the most prominent parts of the book was the unique language that 
Sophie used. For example, “pigeon” stands for person and “freckle” is a 
substitute for a friend. This unique language gave me a different reading 
experience and I was caught up in Sophie`s world.

The plot of the book itself lays out as you read the book and you get to find 
out about Sophie’s past as she finds out. I enjoyed this book because it meant 
that I was in the dark as Sophie was, and I would be feeling the emotions she 
would be feeling.

Overall I think this was quite an emotional read. If you love contemporary 
books or you are looking for a unique YA book, then this book could be for you.
