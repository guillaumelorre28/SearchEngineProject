The family of an unarmed man fatally shot by an Atlanta-area police officer 
has filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against the DeKalb County police 
department, officer Robert Olsen, the county and its board of commissioners.

A spokesman for the police department did not immediately respond to emails 
seeking comment. County attorney OV Brantley said she doesn’t comment on 
pending litigation.

Olsen shot Anthony Hill on 9 March while responding to a call of a man 
behaving erratically outside a suburban Atlanta apartment complex. Hill wasa 
27-year-old US air force veteran

 who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. His girlfriend later told the 
Guardian he was forced to self-medicate with marijuana when treatment was 
unavailable through the Atlanta VA medical center.

DeKalb county district attorney Robert James is considering whether to present 
the case to a grand jury for indictment. Olson was put on administrative leave 
after the shooting, and theGeorgia

has been looking into the shooting.

Hill’s mother, Carolyn Giummo, says officers must held accountable, and she 
hopes the lawsuit will prompt change in police training.
