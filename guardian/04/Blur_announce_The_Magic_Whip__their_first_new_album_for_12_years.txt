Fans of Britpop <https://www.theguardian.com/music/britpop> pioneers Blur had 
reason to celebrate on 19 February, as the group announced details of their 
first album in 12 years, entitled The Magic Whip.

Describing the follow-up to 2003’s Think Tank as a return to “the way we 
recorded when we started,”Damon Albarn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn> said that the album was 
similar in style to the music David Bowie made during his mid 70’s Berlin 
period.

Initially conceived in Hong Kong, during downtime following a cancelled show 
in Japan, the band spent five days laying down ideas. It wasn’t untilGraham 
Coxon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/graham-coxon> reprised these sessions 
and presented them to long-time producer Stephen Street, who went on to develop 
them with the guitarist, that they realised they might have material worthy of 
a new album.


“They did some editing and some production work and sent around the initial 
tracks and we all realised we’d done something quite special there,” said 
drummer Dave Rowntree. “There was 18 months [in-between recording the songs] 
which allowed us to have a bit of perspective on it. When they played it back, 
that was the time everyone got very excited.”

The band made their announcement at a hastily arranged press conference in a 
Chinese restaurant in London, hosted by Zane Lowe, which was also live-streamed
on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/blur>. Until this point, Albarn admitted 
that the band had gone as far as they could go without returning to the studio: 
“I really felt at the end of the last gigs that that was it - there was no way 
we could do another gig without an another album.”

Since the album’s completion last year, the band have kept information about 
the new record under wraps. “We had a blood pact between us about who we were 
allowed to tell and who we weren’t so I’ve had to do a lot of catch up phone 
calling today!” said Rowntree. “A fair few angry people going ‘Why wasn’t I in 
the circle of trust!”

The songs featured on The Magic Whip were influenced by their surroundings in 
Hong Kong. “There’s nothing pastoral about it - it’s very urban,” said Albarn. 
“It wasn’t a flash studio, it was pretty claustrophobic and hot. We went in and 
knocked about loads of ideas.”

One track, Ong Ong, was described by bassist Alex James 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alex-james> as a “banger”, while another 
is said to describe Albarn’s thoughts on North Korea. “It’s my impression of 
the place, in an abstract, veiled way,” he said.

In support of the album, Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree also announced that 
they will headline this year’s British Summer Time in Hyde Park on 20 June, the 
fourth time they have played there.

While Think Tank, the band’s seventh album, remains the last under the Blur 
banner, Coxon was absent for the majority of its recording process: the 
guitarist only features on one song, its melancholic closer, Battery in Your 
Leg. The Magic Whip marks their first proper full-length as a quartet since 
1999’s13 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/21/favourite-album-blur-13>
.

In the intervening years, the group have reformed for a number of major live 
shows: they headlined Hyde Park andGlastonbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/29/blur-glastonbury-2009> in 2009, 
not to mention the London Olympics closing concert in 2012. So far, fans have 
only been privy to two new tracks since their reformation: the one-off single
Under the Westway/The Puritan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/02/blur-under-westway-puritan>, in 
2012.

; not to mention his Mercury-nominated solo album,Everyday Robots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/24/damon-albarn-everyday-robots-review>
, in 2014.

 franchise.

Albarn first hinted that there might be an eighth Blur album in 2013, 
following the cancelled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/25/damon-albarn-blur-havent-got-time-for-new-album>
 Japan shows. “The opportunity came and we took it,” James told Bang Showbiz. 
“We were just jamming, but it was good.”

The frontman’s jam-packed schedule has often been held responsible for 
impeding the band’s musical progress: in 2012, William Orbit claimed that 
Albarn pulled the plug on a set of “amazing” recording sessions. “Damon, 
brilliant and talented tho he is, is kinda a shit to the rest of Blur,”he wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/24/blur-album-sessions-william-orbit>
.


Having formed at London’s Goldsmiths College in the late 80s, Blur’s debut 
album, Leisure, was released in 1991. Famous for pioneering the Britpop 
movement, the band went on to challenge their northern rivals, Oasis, in 1995 
when the bands released singles at the same time: Blur’s Country House outsold 
the Oasis’s Roll With It by 274,000 to 216,000. “Blur won the battle, Oasis won 
the war, then Blur went on to win the whole campaign,” bassistJames once said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/may/08/inspring2008blurandoasis>
. What with suggestions thatOasis might one day re-form 
<http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/82441>, perhaps the fight isn’t quite over just 
yet.

The Magic Whip will be released on 27 April. The full tracklist is as follows: 

Lonesome Street
