1 Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them (12A) 

(David Yates, 2016, UK/US) 133 mins.

This lavishly designed Potter prequel delivers on the promised magical 
menagerie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
, as wrangled by Eddie Redmayne’s wizarding wildlife whisperer (think Doctor 
Who meets David Attenborough). Equally intriguing is the alternative 1920s 
America he stumbles into: a society beset by segregation, paranoia and 
witch-hunts. It’s escapist spectacle with a dash of political substance.

Marvellously stirring sci-fi that caters to both the head and the heart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/arrival-review-amy-adams-denis-villeneuve-alien-contact>
. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are enlisted to provide translation services when 
an alien race turns up on Earth with unfathomable intentions and an 
undecipherable language. There’s an eerie charge to their close encounters, 
which ties in with Adams’s bereavement issues in unexpected ways.

A Miyazaki-sized smash in Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/09/makoto-shinkai-director-anime-your-name>
, this anime begins as a teen gender-swap comedy (Tokyo boy and rural girl 
regularly wake up in each other’s bodies) but develops into something 
altogether less predictable and more epic. Natural disaster, time-travel and 
bittersweet romance are major ingredients in a unique story, rendered with some 
gorgeous animation.

Classy in its design and construction, Ford’s melodramatic thriller mixes 
fiction, past and present exquisitely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-amy-adams-jake-gyllenhaal>
. Amy Adams is sucked back to her Texan youth by her ex’s violent revenge 
novel, which impacts on her unhappy LA life in the present day.

A highbrow fan doc, maybe, but the Stooges’ music and proto-punk attitude have 
barely dated, and a surprisingnumber of band members are still alive to tell 
the tale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/iggy-pop-jim-jarmusch-stooges-gimme-danger-cannes-2016>
; principally, the eloquent, ravaged Iggy Pop. It’s a definitive rock career, 
taking in life-threatening live shows, drug abuses, industry-related setbacks 
and an enduring, collective spirit.
