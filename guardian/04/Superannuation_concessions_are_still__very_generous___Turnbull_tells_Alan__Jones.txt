Alan Jones has challenged Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> on superannuation 
changes and the Safe Schools anti-bullying program in a largely friendly 
encounter on 2GB radio.

The interview on Wednesday was the first time Turnbull has appeared on Jones’ 
program sincea bruising encounter in June 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/malcolm-turnbull-clashes-with-alan-jones?CMP=soc_567>
 in which Turnbull refused to “take dictation” from Jones, who had asked him to 
back the 2014 budget.

Turnbull praised Jones’ eloquence in earlier statements pointing out the 
generosity of superannuation tax concessions and highlighted the need to “live 
within our means”. It followed appeals from senior Liberals for Turnbull to 
make peace with Jones.

Jones asked Turnbull about elements of the Safe Schools program, and whether 
it was appropriate for 15-year-olds to role play characters including a lesbian 
or a bisexual girl who rarely practises safe sex.

Turnbull said he was not familiar with that element of the program but the 
government had made changes to the Labor program to require parental 
involvement and consent

.

He said the program was “no substitute for very active, engaged and involved 
parents ... We believe parents should be right into it.”

Jones suggested the Coalition and Labor both appeared to support the role play 
elements, which should be “wiped out of the curriculum”.

Jones also peppered Turnbull with questions about the $25,000 annual limit on 
concessional contributions to superannuation introduced by the 2016 budget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/superannuation-coalition-tighter-tax-concessions-budget-wealthiest>
. Jones warned the measure would make it more difficulty for a hypothetical 
40-year-old to build up their super balance to $1m before retirement.

Turnbull explained a person earning $100,000 a year would have about $9,000 
automatically put into super, allowing them to contribute an extra $16,000 a 
year taxed at the concessional rate of 15%.

“This is one of the things we’ve done to make super fairer and more flexible,” 
he said.

Turnbull defended taxing income from super balances over $1.6m as the “most 
administratively straightforward” way to trim the generosity of super tax 
concessions.

“We’re talking about less than 1% of the population, the vast majority of the 
population don’t have anything like this [amount],” he said.

“We believe our changes to superannuation are fair and well targeted. The 
reality is we have to live within our means. The super concessions are very 
generous, they remain very generous. What we’ve done is dialled them back a bit 
for people on very high incomes and with very high super balances, people like 
you and me for example.”

Jones quipped, “I’m not in your league [prime minister]”, to which Turnbull 
chuckled and replied, “Well, who knows?”

“Yes there are people who are unhappy about it,” Turnbull said. He said a 
person with a super balance of $4m would be pay no tax on earnings from the 
balance up to $1.6m, and just 15% on the balance, which he noted was lower than 
the lowest rate of personal income tax.

Turnbull defended the requirement for superannuants to draw down their 
balances by explaining the idea of super was to achieve financial independence 
in retirement not to amass wealth.

“The idea of super is not to be a wealth creation exercise, to build up a 
large capital amount,” he said. “The idea is you get big tax incentives to put 
money into super ... the idea is that people live off that and consume both the 
income and a portion of the capital.”

How did the Coalition reach the $66bn 'black hole' figure for Labor's policies?

Turnbull said the draw-down rates, which Jones described as “steep”, would be 
reviewed every five years.

The interview also included Turnbull’s explanation of the government’s agenda 
for “jobs and growth” and the planned trajectory to surplus in 2020.

Turnbull blamed housing unaffordability on constraints on supply, which he 
said were caused by state and local governments.

He said the federal government would not be a “passive ATM that hands out 
money willy-nilly” but would encourage increased supply of housing with its 
cities policy linking land release to funding.

Turnbull criticised Labor’s negative gearing policy by claiming “rich people” 
who earn income from rent and shares would still be able to lower their tax on 
that income with negatively geared property. By contrast people who earned 
income from “personal exertion” and “the sweat of their brow” would not be able 
to reduce their tax with negative gearing, he said.
