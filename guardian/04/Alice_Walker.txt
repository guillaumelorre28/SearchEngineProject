The Color Purple, the novel that would earn Walker the Pulitzer prize and 
bring her fame beyond her previous books and poetry, also brought fierce 
criticism from those furious with her portrayal of violent black men. But 
Walker's work has always been about the experiences and inner lives of black 
women â€“ she coined the term "womanism" that describes a movement of black 
feminists who felt ignored by mainstream feminism.

The eighth child of sharecroppers, Walker grew up in segregated Georgia. When 
she married the white Jewish civil rights lawyer Mel Leventhal, they were the 
first legally married interracial couple in Mississippi, defying threats from 
the Ku Klux Klan. A longtime activist, she has been a vocal member of the civil 
rights movement, the anti-nuclear movement, and in recent years has protested 
against the Iraq war and been part of a mission to deliver aid to Gaza.
