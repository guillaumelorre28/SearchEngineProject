Wassinissa began her story: "I have many times without laugh. I wake up and am 
just relieved to be alive."

In Gaza and Maputo provinces in southern Mozambique, elder abuse takes the 
form of intimidation and destruction of property, often perpetrated by sons and 
daughters-in-law. This is a part of Africa where the lure of the glittering 
mines surrounding Johannesburg and the forced separation of young men from 
their families is intrinsically connected to enduring ties of neighbourhood, 
property, a sense of home and, above all, envy. The recent xenophobic attacks 
against non-South Africans sent frustrated young men home without the fortunes 
they had left in search of.

When Wassinissa's husband died, rumour spread around the village that she had 
bewitched him. Anxious at being the subject of village gossip and fearful of 
worse reprisals, she packed up her meagre belongings into a cloth sack and 
built a makeshift shelter amongst the thorns and cacti several kilometres away. 
After a lifetime's hard work raising a large family and cultivating fields, 
Wassinissa has to walk for a whole morning to fetch a heavy bucket of water. 
She says that her son gave her some zinc sheets to provide limited shelter for 
when the rains come.

When prompted as to why she didn't contact village paralegals for help, she 
explained that she didn't want to cause harm to her children: "Better that I 
stay out the way and keep quiet."
