It's been hard enough to get proper support and entitlements for the last 
12 years, says Christine Ransome-Wallis, so the prospect of cuts to public 
spending hardly fills her with enthusiasm. She's been the main carer for her 
91-year-old mother, Margaret (pictured), for much of that time and it has been, 
she admits, "an uphill struggle".

But if a financial crisis forces public services – from the benefits system to 
the NHS and social services – to become more efficient, she wonders if some 
good may come of it. She has little confidence, however, that the authorities 
will find innovative approaches to delivering services. "If anyone has a new 
idea, it's not going to happen overnight."

Local authorities should hire ex-carers to do some of the jobs currently 
reserved for professionals, says Birmingham-based Ransome-Wallis, who worked 
for the NHS. She believes carers have a key role to play in enabling public 
services to refine efficient ways of working. They know where the system breaks 
down, where it creates duplication, and how it can better meet needs.

"They should talk to people who know what they are talking about, rather than 
people in glass palaces and ivory towers."
