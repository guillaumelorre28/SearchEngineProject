When I tell people I go to Oxford University, they look at me with admiration. 
“Wow, that’s fantastic,” they say. “You must have the best time there.” There’s 
not much else to do but smile and agree. You know that, for most people, this 
is an incredible achievement, but that can’t overcome the feeling of dread you 
feel at the start of every term.

People say I must be really clever, but most of the time I feel incredibly 
stupid. At school, I was the best at my subject, one of 10 from my year to get 
into Oxbridge, but here I am decidedly subpar. I spend my time desperately 
trying to complete my work, only to get it back full of corrections in red or 
with no comments at all.

If I’m ill, I feel about guilty lying in bed, staring at the pile of 
books on my desk. An email from my tutor refusing to extend the deadline 
only makes it worse. I shouldn’t be lying in bed, I’m not that ill; I’ll dose 
myself up and be fine. I drag myself to the library and sit in the corner. The 
words are swimming in front of my eyes, but I power through. The sooner 
I finish it, the sooner I can go back to bed. I meet the deadline, knowing it 
is one of my worst attempts this term.

The work is never-ending; you hand in one essay only to be set another; the 
all-nighters are a vicious circle. I’m convinced I’m going to fail all my 
exams. What’s the point in me even being here? Why put myself through this?

The truth, however, is terrifying: I can’t stand to see the looks of 
disappointment on people’s faces when they hear that I have failed.
