A difficult night for France but all’s well that ends well. Albania defended 
brilliantly for much of this match and even went close to nicking a goal on the 
break. They deserved more. ButFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> kept plugging away and though 
they weren’t at their best, they were rewarded for their persistence thanks to 
late, late goals from Antoine Griezmann and Dimitri Payet. They’ll need to 
improve as the tournament progresses but for now they’re top of Group A with 
six points from two matches and that’s them through to the last 16. A point 
against Switzerland in their final group match will confirm them as group 
winners. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.

GOAL! France 2-0 Albania (Payet, 90min+5)

Paul Pogba sets Gignac away with a raking diagonal pass that turns defence 
into attack in an instant. Gignac slips on the left but the ball runs to Payet. 
He cuts inside past Xhaka, dropping the shoulder elegantly, and whips a right 
footer into the far corner. What a player.
 Payet scores the second. Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA  And celebrates.

GOAL!!! France 1-0 Albania (Griezmann, 90 min)

Antoine Griezmann doesn’t look so tired now! France have done it again. Albania
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> thought that they had done 
enough after repelling another French attack. But the ball was only cleared to 
Rami on the right and the centre-back channelled his inner Payet by lifting an 
inviting cross into the area. Griezmann was unmarked and he nods it into the 
bottom right corner from six yards!

81 min: The Marseille pitch is rather poor. It’s cut up badly. One of the 
semi-finals is meant to be held here. They’ll be a debate about later in the 
tournament. Meanwhile Amir Abrashi has been booked. Payet curls the resulting 
free-kick into the area. Koscielny peels away from his marker and completely 
misses his header. Oh dear.

79 min: Xhaka’s first contribution is to slip and gift the ball straight to 
Pogba. This time he passes to Gignac, whose first touch on an admittedly bobbly 
pitch is poor. If he’d got it under control, he’d have been able to slip 
Griezmann in. Instead he has to hang a cross to the far post. Eventually it 
comes to Payet, who twists and turns, attempting but failing to find an angle 
for a shot. He settles for a cross. It’s headed away as far as Sagna, who 
wallops a volley high and wide.

70 min: Pogba bursts through the middle and has options right and left. Yet he 
hangs on to the ball too long and the chance to set someone up disappears. 
Eventually Kante has a pop but it’s blocked. Was Pogba too eager to impress 
there?

crosses for Giroud, who rises above theAlbania

67 min: Kante atones for dawdling on the ball by winning it back straight 
away. It’s shifted out to Coman on the left and his cross is headed wide by 
Giroud at the near post. A poor miss. Is he clinical enough?

55 min: Kukeli is booked for fouling a counterattacking Coman. It’s his second 
booking of the tournament, so he’ll miss the Romania game. “Unless one side 
(presumably France) puts its foot on the gas, this game will be a record 
breaker: in the first 14 matches of thisEuropean Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/european-championship>, neither side has 
scored three goals,” says Joe Meredith. “The previous record is also 14 games, 
in 1996, ended by Germany’s 3-0 defeat of Russia. Just a “fun” stat for you 
there.”

52 min: Albania hit the post! Hysaj - I think - flings a wonderful cross into 
the area from the right. Sadiku can’t rise high enough to head it in but there 
are players behind him. Lenjani tumbles as he tries to bundle it in and the 
ball hits the unwitting Sagna before trundling against the post. Lloris looked 
beaten. He’s helpless as it bounces out but it comes off the prone Lenjani and 
goes behind.

47 min: France have started this half with ominous intent, winning a free-kick 
on the left. Payet curls it in again, into the corridor of uncertainty. It’s 
one of those that needs only a touch, with Berisha rooted to his line, but it 
evades everyone and bounces wide of the far post.

46 min: France get the second half underway. Paul Pogba has replaced the 
disappointing Anthony Martial, which means that Payet has moved to the left.
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> are back to 4-3-3 and 
they’re on the attack straight away. Giroud crosses from the left, Matuidi 
flicks it on and Coman flings himself at the ball at the far post. Under 
pressure, his header dribbles just wide.

Peep! There are loud whistles from the home fans. Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> will be delighted; France less 
so. How long until we see Pogba and Griezmann?

45 min+1: There will be one added minute. Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have a corner. They’re finishing 
the half strongly. France get the corner away in unconvincing fashion. “Forget 
Martial, am I the only one to have been very impressed by Memushaj in this 
first half?” says Richard Mellor. “Very good feet, balance, tekkers and always 
trying to play forward. I’m feeling all Harry Redknapp - can my club 
(Leicester) please sign him?”

42 min: Albania are awarded a free-kick after Evra catches Lila with a high 
foot on the edge of the area. That was so high. Both players are down. Evra 
looks like he’s pulled his groin! “Not that France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> were a smoothly running machine 
in their first game, but the experiment of trying to improve a team by 
sidelining its two most accomplished players really doesn’t seem to be 
working,” says Kari Tulinius.

39 min: Albania produce a training ground trick from the corner, Lila sliding 
a low ball into the middle, the unmarked Lenjani speeding on to it. He’s got a 
clear sight of goal but he scuffs his effort, when he might have done better, 
and the ball deflects wide off aFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> leg. The second corner comes to 
nothing. That’s the best chance either side’s created.

31 min: Martial is starting to drift into more central position in the last 
few minutes. Maybe that will work.

A difficult night for France but all’s well that ends well. Albania defended 
brilliantly for much of this match and even went close to nicking a goal on the 
break. They deserved more. ButFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> kept plugging away and though 
they weren’t at their best, they were rewarded for their persistence thanks to 
late, late goals from Antoine Griezmann and Dimitri Payet. They’ll need to 
improve as the tournament progresses but for now they’re top of Group A with 
six points from two matches and that’s them through to the last 16. A point 
against Switzerland in their final group match will confirm them as group 
winners. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.

Well, that was an eventful finish.
 
Paul Pogba sets Gignac away with a raking diagonal pass that turns defence 
into attack in an instant. Gignac slips on the left but the ball runs to Payet. 
He cuts inside past Xhaka, dropping the shoulder elegantly, and whips a right 
footer into the far corner. What a player.

90 min+5: Play finally resumes.
 
90 min+3: Koscielny is down after a clash of heads.
 
90 min+2: As engrossing as this game has been, Griezmann’s goal was the first 
shot on target.
 
90 min+1: There will be five minutes of stoppage time.
 
Antoine Griezmann doesn’t look so tired now! France have done it again. Albania
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> thought that they had done 
enough after repelling another French attack. But the ball was only cleared to 
Rami on the right and the centre-back channelled his inner Payet by lifting an 
inviting cross into the area. Griezmann was unmarked and he nods it into the 
bottom right corner from six yards!

89 min: Albania mount their first attack for what seems like an eternity. Rosi 
dribbles past Payet, who slips, and his cross comes to the edge of the area. An 
Albanian shot is blocked.France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> 
break. Payet slips a pass through to Matuidi and Gignac attacks his cross. 
Corner. It comes to nothing. But...
 
88 min: Kante lifts a fine ball into the area. Pogba takes it on his chest. 
And slips.Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> counter down 
the left and the attack is illegally halted by Kante, who’s booked.
 
85 min: Before the corner can be taken, the concussed Arlind Ajeti is replaced 
by Frederic Veseli. That substitution out of the way, Payet lifts the ball into 
the area. It drops to a France player butAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> defend stoutly, shovelling the 
ball clear.
 
84 min: Matuidi shoots. Blocked. Kante shoots. Deflected. Wide. Just. Here 
comes a Payet corner.
 
83 min: Sagna fizzes a cross into the six-yard box and Ajeti does just enough 
to put Griezmann off. Otherwise it was a goal.
 
81 min: The Marseille pitch is rather poor. It’s cut up badly. One of the 
semi-finals is meant to be held here. They’ll be a debate about later in the 
tournament. Meanwhile Amir Abrashi has been booked. Payet curls the resulting 
free-kick into the area. Koscielny peels away from his marker and completely 
misses his header. Oh dear.
 
79 min: Xhaka’s first contribution is to slip and gift the ball straight to 
Pogba. This time he passes to Gignac, whose first touch on an admittedly bobbly 
pitch is poor. If he’d got it under control, he’d have been able to slip 
Griezmann in. Instead he has to hang a cross to the far post. Eventually it 
comes to Payet, who twists and turns, attempting but failing to find an angle 
for a shot. He settles for a cross. It’s headed away as far as Sagna, who 
wallops a volley high and wide.
 
77 min: Andre-Pierre Gignac replaces Olivier Giroud. Gignac’s arrival/Giroud’s 
departure is greeted by a huge roar.

76 min: Memushaj’s free-kick is easily cleared. The France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> fans are still chanting for 
Gignac, who’s a popular man in Marseille.
 
75 min: Rosi is fouled by Evra on the right. Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have a free-kick.
 
74 min: The injured Burim Kukeli is replaced by Taulant Khaka, whose younger 
brother happens to be very proficient with house keys.
 
71 min: Albania make their first change, Odise Roshi replacing Andi Lila.
 
70 min: Pogba bursts through the middle and has options right and left. Yet he 
hangs on to the ball too long and the chance to set someone up disappears. 
Eventually Kante has a pop but it’s blocked. Was Pogba too eager to impress 
there?
 
69 min: Giroud hits the base of the post! Evra drives down the left and 
crosses for Giroud, who rises above theAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> defence majestically. It’s a 
beautiful header and he’s unlucky to see it hit the right post and bounce to 
safety. The French fans are chanting for Gignac.

missed chance. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters  
68 min: Antoine Griezmann replaces Kingsley Coman.
 
67 min: Kante atones for dawdling on the ball by winning it back straight 
away. It’s shifted out to Coman on the left and his cross is headed wide by 
Giroud at the near post. A poor miss. Is he clinical enough?
 
65 min: France win another corner. They haven’t been able to come up with the 
final ball.
 
63 min: Payet’s corner is a waste, but France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> work it back to him. This time 
his delivery is better but Koscielny heads it over at the near post. It needed 
a glance.
 
62 min: France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> probe carefully. 
Sagna’s cross is deflected behind for another corner on the right.
 
61 min: Pogba hits own man with a shot from miles out. This is a test of 
France’s mentality. Will they be patient enough?
 
59 min: Payet shifts the ball on to his right foot but he can’t keep his shot 
down from 20 yards.

56 min: Coman snatches at a shot and sends it well wide from 25 yards. 
Griezmann is warming up.
 
55 min: Kukeli is booked for fouling a counterattacking Coman. It’s his second 
booking of the tournament, so he’ll miss the Romania game. “Unless one side 
(presumably France) puts its foot on the gas, this game will be a record 
breaker: in the first 14 matches of thisEuropean Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/european-championship>, neither side has 
scored three goals,” says Joe Meredith. “The previous record is also 14 games, 
in 1996, ended by Germany’s 3-0 defeat of Russia. Just a “fun” stat for you 
there.”
 
54 min: Pogba misses an excellent chance. Payet swings a cross to the far post 
from the left and Pogba arrives unnoticed, only to crash the ball just over on 
the half-volley.

53 min: France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> look to respond 
after that scare but Payet’s shot is deflected wide. The corner comes to 
nothing.
 
52 min: Albania hit the post! Hysaj - I think - flings a wonderful cross into 
the area from the right. Sadiku can’t rise high enough to head it in but there 
are players behind him. Lenjani tumbles as he tries to bundle it in and the 
ball hits the unwitting Sagna before trundling against the post. Lloris looked 
beaten. He’s helpless as it bounces out but it comes off the prone Lenjani and 
goes behind.

49 min: Payet lofts the ball into the area for Matuidi to chase and Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> almost get themselves into an 
awful muddle at the back. Berisha’s punch hits his own man and with the goal 
unguarded, he’s fortunate that the ball doesn’t bounce to an opponent.
 
47 min: France have started this half with ominous intent, winning a free-kick 
on the left. Payet curls it in again, into the corridor of uncertainty. It’s 
one of those that needs only a touch, with Berisha rooted to his line, but it 
evades everyone and bounces wide of the far post.
 
46 min: France get the second half underway. Paul Pogba has replaced the 
disappointing Anthony Martial, which means that Payet has moved to the left.
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> are back to 4-3-3 and 
they’re on the attack straight away. Giroud crosses from the left, Matuidi 
flicks it on and Coman flings himself at the ball at the far post. Under 
pressure, his header dribbles just wide.

Peep! There are loud whistles from the home fans. Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> will be delighted; France less 
so. How long until we see Pogba and Griezmann?

45 min+1: There will be one added minute. Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have a corner. They’re finishing 
the half strongly. France get the corner away in unconvincing fashion. “Forget 
Martial, am I the only one to have been very impressed by Memushaj in this 
first half?” says Richard Mellor. “Very good feet, balance, tekkers and always 
trying to play forward. I’m feeling all Harry Redknapp - can my club 
(Leicester) please sign him?”
 
44 min: With teams momentarily down to 10 men, Memushaj’s curls the ball just 
over the bar. Lloris had it covered.
 
43 min: Both players are receiving treatment. Evra actually looks like he hurt 
his back on landing. Lila is suffering from a more prosaic blow to the head.
 
42 min: Albania are awarded a free-kick after Evra catches Lila with a high 
foot on the edge of the area. That was so high. Both players are down. Evra 
looks like he’s pulled his groin! “Not that France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> were a smoothly running machine 
in their first game, but the experiment of trying to improve a team by 
sidelining its two most accomplished players really doesn’t seem to be 
working,” says Kari Tulinius.

40 min: Albania carve France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> 
open on the right, Martial going to sleep, but Hysaj’s cross from the byline is 
just too high for those waiting in the middle.
 
39 min: Albania produce a training ground trick from the corner, Lila sliding 
a low ball into the middle, the unmarked Lenjani speeding on to it. He’s got a 
clear sight of goal but he scuffs his effort, when he might have done better, 
and the ball deflects wide off aFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> leg. The second corner comes to 
nothing. That’s the best chance either side’s created.

38 min: Koscielny is forced into a spot of expert defending, heading a driven 
Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> free-kick over his own 
bar.
 
36 min: Another free-kick from Payet; another header over the bar from Giroud. 
It looked like it came off his shoulder.

35 min: Coman beats Kukeli with a sublime piece of skill on the right 
touchline, bouncing past him as if he wasn’t there, but the youngster’s low 
cross is too close to Berisha.
 
34 min: Payet whips a free-kick into the Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> area from the right. It’s a 
simple catch for Berisha.

31 min: Martial is starting to drift into more central position in the last 
few minutes. Maybe that will work.
