The Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-symonds> will find out later today if 
he will face disciplinary action after accusations that he was involved in a 
bar brawl on Sunday night. Cricket Australia has been interviewing witnesses to 
the incident at a pub in Brisbane and is expected to interview Symonds, the 
Australia captain Ricky Ponting and coach Tim Nielsen before making an 
announcement tonight, British time.

Symonds yesterday claimed that he had not provoked the incident and had been 
harassed by a member of the public, with the pub's management issuing a 
statement confirming Symonds' version of events. "A member of the public acted 
unreasonably towards me while I was with friends, at which time I took steps to 
remove myself from the situation," Symonds said.

"The member of the public was subsequently removed from the premises as a 
result of his actions. I was sharing some drinks with other players and close 
friends and did not in any way provoke this situation."

Symonds has just completed a suspension for going on a fishing trip in August 
instead of attending a compulsory team meeting. He was suspended for two 
matches played in England in 2005 for turning up after a few late-night beers 
for a one-day international against Bangladesh, which Australia subsequently 
lost prior to their Ashes defeat.
