The media sector comes under the spotlight of analysts at Goldman Sachs this 
morning with a boost forITV in particular.

The investment bank flags up a stronger advertising recovering as well as some 
positive currency effects. In a note to clients, it writes:

"Having already increased our 2010 earnings per share forecasts by around 35% 
since May 2009, we now raise them a further 3%, driven by even stronger ad 
recovery as well as some positive FX benefit. The stronger than expected 
improvement in advertising has been particularly pronounced in TV and outdoor, 
with double-digit growth in some areas."

It maintains a "Conviction Buy" on ITV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> "due to the strength of the ad 
recovery coupled with positive structural, regulatory and competitive 
developments".

"ITV has one of the lowest fundamental market valuations against a Bloomberg 
EPS consensus that is still more than 20% too low, in our view."

ITV shares are up 0.55p, or almost 1%, at 68.55p, outperforming a wider FTSE 
250 that is up just 15 points or 0.1%, at 10554.

The analysts also keep a "Buy" recommendation on WPP and upgrade advertising 
groupAegis from "Neutral" to "Buy" following "recent strong new business 
performance."

Within professional publishers Reed Elsevier remains the bank's "Conviction 
Buy".

"As its premium to most of its peers has largely closed, we believe it remains 
very good fundamental value, and it is beginning to see cyclical improvement in 
its markets."

It is also positive on Informa and United Business Media "given signs of 
improvement in B2B publishing and attractive valuations", has a "Buy" 
recommendation on newspaper groupTrinity Mirror but remains negative on most 
directories businesses, with a "Sell" recommendation onYell.
