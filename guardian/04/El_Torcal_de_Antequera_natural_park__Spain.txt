About 30km north of Málaga lies the majestic El Torcal de Antequera natural 
park. There’s only 17 square km of it, and it was under the sea until 100 
million years ago – quite recently in geological terms. It’s a special place – 
a craggy landscape of dramatic limestone formations, and also a good spot to 
escape the beautiful but crowded towns of Málaga province for some peace.

Entry to the park is free and walkers can explore it by taking one of three 
routes of varying length and difficulty. The 1.5km green and 3km yellow routes 
can be done independently by just following the coloured arrows, but the more 
difficult 4.5km red trail takes about three hours and requires a guide (about 
€8 per person). Climbing to a height of 1,339 metres, it offers spectacular 
views.

Standing in this ancient landscape, I felt time had stood still. My moment of 
solitude came with a gentle musical soundtrack: as the sun dipped in the sky, 
casting a golden light across the rocky shapes, the sound of bells from a herd 
of sheep grazing in the hills was carried to me on the breeze.
