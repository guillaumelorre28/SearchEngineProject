 The dark regions in this image are cosmic clumps so dark, dense and dusty that 
they throwthe deepest shadows ever recorded 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-158>. The clumps were 
discovered within a huge cosmic cloud of gas and dust. Infrared observations by

 Jupiter's Great Red Spot â€“ a swirling storm feature larger than Earth â€“ has 
shrunken to its smallest size since measurements began in the 1930s. 
Astronomers have followed this downsizing since the 1930s.This series of images

 The largest known galaxy cluster in the distant universe is living up to its 
nickname, El Gordo ("the fat one"). By measuring how much its gravity warps 
images of far more distant galaxies in the background, astronomers have 
calculated its mass to be as much as three million billion times the mass of 
our Sun. Credits: Chandra X-ray Observatory  <> Facebook
