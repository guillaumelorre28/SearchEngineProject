Tumaini left primary school aged 15, married a lumberjack, and soon fell 
pregnant. The young couple paused to reflect upon their situation. "When Lucas 
was born we sat down together and said, 'What are we going to do? This child 
will only grow up to be poor like us.'"

They decided they had to act immediately to provide for their infant son. In 
the good soil behind their house they planted as many trees as they could. Ten 
years later, their firewood business is doing well, providing for a family 
which has grown significantly: Tumaini now also takes care of her elderly 
parents, three children from various relatives and her own three-year-old 
daughter, Jacqueline.

With such a large household, Tumaini had to diversify her business. In March 
she used

their savings to buy two pigs, and a Cama grant of about £20 paid for feed and 
medicine. She has since sold five piglets at £10 a pop.

The income has helped her 

maintain her house and send 

her children to school.

Cama is Camfed's network of young rural women, designed to help school leavers 
to support themselves. It provides members with health and business training 
and mini-grants for start-ups. In Tumaini's village, Ng'ang'ange, Cama has 
enabled an explosion of small business activity - commercial farms, groceries, 
clothes shops, restaurants - all in a remote village which had none of these 
things until March this year.

Cama is about young women gaining financial independence, but their businesses 
also provide a basis for hope and ambition. I asked Tumaini what she wants for 
little Jacqueline. She laughed: "University, and beyond!"ER
