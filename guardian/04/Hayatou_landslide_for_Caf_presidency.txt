Issa Hayatou of Cameroon easily beat Botswana's Ismail Bhamjee to be 
re-elected as president of the Confederation for African Football.

Hayatou, who also is vice president of Fifa, won the vote at the Caf Congress 
with a 46-6 margin over his challenger to earn a fifth term of four years.

In another election, Tunisia's Slim Chiboub won a place on Fifa's executive 
committee to replace countryman Slim Aloulou.

Two years ago, Hayatou narrowly failed in his bid to oust Sepp Blatter as Fifa 
president, but his re-election on Thursday means he will extend his reign over 
African soccer to two decades.

After Thursday's result, Blatter hugged Hayatou and raised his arm in the air. 

Hayatou said his biggest challenge now was to improve soccer facilities and 
stadiums throughout the continent.

"It is a task worth fighting for. Together we will develop the future of 
African soccer," he said.

"I guarantee you one thing. My fidelity and comradeship. The Caf will stay 
amicable, run for Africa, by Africa and for the benefit of the continent."

Caf was established in 1957 to unite all Fifa member soccer teams in Africa. 

In the vote for Fifa's executive committee, Chiboub won 31 votes, compared to 
13 for Egypt's Hary Abu Rida and five for Moroccan Said Belkhayat.

"With such a majority, the African federation has total faith in Chiboub," 
Blatter said.

Chiboub is 46 and is the organizer of the African Cup of Nations, which opens 
in Tunis on Saturday.
