<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards-2012>, which took place on 
Monday 14 May 2012.

The Science Weekly podcast won the Best Internet Programme category for the 
'Sounds of the Space Shuttle - An Acoustic Tribute' 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2011/jul/12/science-weekly-podcast-space-shuttle?INTCMP=SRCH>
 edition, which formed part of the Guardian's coverage of the last shuttle 
mission in July 2011. The podcast featured interviews with astronauts Piers 
Sellers and Scott Altman to create a sonic picture of a shuttle mission from 
launch to landing, and was praised by the judges for being "a great piece of 
storytelling pulled off with huge skill and imagination."

Another series of Guardian podcasts - 'A Day in the Life' 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/manchester-international-festival+content/audio>
, which created unique soundscapes around four editions of the Guardian - came 
second in the same category.
