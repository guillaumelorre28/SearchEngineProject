The Democratic congressional primary race in North Carolina between former 
American Idol <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/american-idol> 
runner-up Clay Aiken and textile entrepreneur Keith Crisco remained very close 
and without a clear winner.

Aiken and Crisco each had about 40% of the vote, trailed by licensed family 
counselor Toni Morris of Fayetteville in Tuesday's primary race in the 2nd 
congressional district.

Aiken's first political campaign drew an unusual amount of celebrity buzz 
thanks to his singing career and a second-place finish on Celebrity Apprentice. 
Crisco spent four years as the state's top business recruiter under under 
former Democratic governor Beverly Perdue.

The primary winner will challenge incumbent Republican US representative Renee 
Ellmers in November. Ellmers, first elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, handily 
defeated her challenger in the heavily Republican district.

Aiken has said reporters are the only people asking whether being a gay man 
could impede his campaign to represent such a conservative district. Both he 
and Crisco touted themselves as centrists.

"We need to stay out of people's bedrooms," Bob Finch, a 57-year-old Democrat 
from Lee County, said Tuesday.
