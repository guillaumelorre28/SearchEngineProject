Car hire firm Avis Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aviseurope> 
has given up on plans to streamline its information technology system leaving 
it with a multi-million pound write-off against the failed initiative.

Yesterday the group said that it would take a net exceptional charge of 
between €40m (£28m) and €45m in the second half of this year - though that 
appears to cover only part of the costs of abandoning the IT programme.

The extent of second-half write-offs has been reduced because Avis has 
recovered more money than it expected from Centrus, the credit hire business it 
closed last year. Avis declined to detail the extent to which that had offset 
the cost of scrapping the IT system.

Avis shares fell almost 9% to 62p after news of the charge. 

Avis employs about 6,000 people at some 1,250 locations in 96 countries. The 
new IT system was designed to integrate the company's different systems.

The chief executive, Murray Hennessy, said: "We are very disappointed that 
major IT parts of the project have incurred substantial exceptional costs and 
will not deliver anticipated benefits."

However he said the group felt that it had been right to take "decisive 
action" and that existing IT systems were continuing to function "as normal".

Avis was also continuing to centralise its back office operations in Budapest 
where it opened a new service centre in February.

Avis said that despite the exceptional charge "the board's expectations for 
the group's profit before tax and exceptional items for the full year remain 
unchanged".

In a research note analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the company's 
broker, described the news as "clearly disappointing". The IT restructuring was 
"meant to drive a significant improvement in productivity and a 100 basis point 
improvement in margins".
