In the middle of the Sahara desert, five of the world's tallest spires jut 
from the sand like red fingers reaching for the sky. This natural wonder is 
known as the Hand of Fatima. To view this 830-metre-high rock formation, you 
start with a flight to Bamako, Mali, then spend roughly two days on a bus to 
reach the town of Hambori. From there, you need to find a jeep (or hire camels) 
to complete the last leg of the journey.

For this shot, photographer and professional climber Jimmy Chin spent two days 
creating a new route up the Kaga Pamari spire, then abseiled down, leaving the 
safety devices in place. Once that was done Chin had to climb and set a fixed 
rope for the spire he's shooting from. Two hours before the sun was where he 
wanted it, he and Wright started racing up the spires to these perches, 300m 
off the ground. Chin managed to get the shot just in time. Soon after, the 
infamous harmattan wind kicked up. "It was like a dark cloud coming right at 
us," he says. "The sand is so fine, it's like a mist, and gets into everything. 
All my camera equipment was destroyed."
