A lot has changed since Goumbé's mother was young. The 15-year-old is the 
first girl in her family to be sent to school. She was excited when she learned 
the topic for the radio programme she would produce was to be girls' education. 
"It's important that girls go to school. Boys and girls can both be important 
in the world."

Life is not easy for Goumbé. Each morning she rises at 6am and walks the five 
kilometres-plus journey to school. When school finishes for the afternoon she 
must rush back to help around the house. She doesn't consider education to be 
of greater importance than her chores. "Both are important. Sometimes it's hard 
to do the housework and homework for school. But I want to do both. I like 
helping at home."

In this village girls tend to marry at the age of 17 or 18. Goumbé 
acknowledges that it will be difficult for her to steer away from that trend 
but she sounds determined. "Sometimes it's difficult. There is family pressure. 
Parents make suggestions to keep everyone happy. I have a friend who is married 
and is 14. She lives in Dakar. I think it would be better to wait until you are 
at least 18. You should be given the chance to go to university."

Goumbé would like that chance. "I would like to study English, my favourite 
subject, and maths." She laughs when I suggest she could become a teacher. 
"Teach? No, not at all. Anything else except teaching! I want to work in a 
bank. That's where all the money is!"
