Asio made more than twice as many recommendations for passports to be refused 
or cancelled on security grounds in 2014-15 than the previous year, and the 
number of terrorism investigations doubled to 400, the security agency’s annual 
report says.


The number of adverse security assessments issued in relation to passports 
leapt to 93 in the year to June 2015, up from 45 the previous year and 18 in 
2012-13.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, whose funding was boosted 
by $196.8m last year after Isis made gains in Iraq andSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, predicted its staff numbers would 
balloon by nearly 20% over the next four years.

The report noted that far-right activity in the past year had graduated from 
“online posts and occasional inflammatory publicity stunts” to larger protests, 
such as the Reclaim Australia rallies and those against mosque plans in Bendigo.

Asio used its new power to recommend passports be suspended — requiring less 
evidence than cancellation — nine times last year, the report said.

There was “an increase in the number of Australians drawn to and motivated by 
the violent extremist narrative” in the past year, and the social media 
attraction of Isis to teenagers was “of particular concern”.

Passport cancellations have become a source of grievance inside Muslim 
communities, particularly after the case of Omar Chandab was publicised.

According to Asio’s negative security assessment of the Melbourne man, seen by 
Guardian Australia, it recommended his passport should be cancelled because he 
had associated with two men, Roger Abbas and Sammy Salma, who were killed 
fighting in Syria.

Chandab told Guardian Australia in September he had voluntarily told Asio of 
his contact with the pair in 2012, and that they had trained in the same gym 
but had done “no socialising at all”.

The power to use force to execute a warrant, introduced in September, was 
drawn on once in the reporting period, by a police officer assisting Asio 
during a search,according to a separate annual report by the intelligence 
watchdog 
<https://www.igis.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/Annual-Reports/2015/IGIS_AR_14-15.pdf>
.

Asio officers had also recently started being trained in “self-defence”, the 
inspector-general of intelligence and security (Igis) said.

Questioning and detention warrants, which allow Asio to interrogate 
non-suspects for up to 24 hours and detain them for up to seven days, were not 
used in the past year, according to Igis.

The number of “higher-priority” counter-terrorism investigations jumped from 
200 to 400 in the past year, Asio’s annual report said.


At the end of June 2015, the agency was aware of about 120 Australians 
fighting in Iraq and Syria, up from 60 at the same time the previous year. Two

, both from Melbourne and members of Isis – had undertaken suicide attacks.

Asio said at least 25 and as many as 35 Australians had been killed fighting 
in the conflict, and about 160 people in Australia were “actively supporting 
the conflict”. It did not specify which groups they were supporting.

The agency identified two terrorist attacks in the past year: the stabbing of 
two police officers by Abdul Numan Haider in September 2014, which resulted in 
the 18-year-old’s death; and the siege at Sydney’s Lindt Cafe by Man Haron 
Monis in December.

An inquest is yet to be held into Haider’s death, and experts are split 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2015/aug/25/sydney-siege-inquest-experts-debate-whether-it-was-a-terrorist-attack-rolling-report>
 over whether the Sydney siege constituted a terrorist attack.

Six other alleged terrorist plots had been disrupted, all initially identified 
by Asio and then handed over to law enforcement, the agency said.

Among them are likely to be the alleged plan to “kill any random unbeliever

 in February allegedly only hours before they carried out a knife attack.

The Shia militia group Hezbollah, whose “external security” branch was named 
as a terrorist organisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/22/hezbollahs-external-security-group-remains-listed-by-australia-as-terrorist>
 in June, had supporters in Australia, but they engaged in “little security 
relevant activity”, the report said.


Violent rhetoric was common among extreme rightwing and leftwing activists, 
“however, acts of violence by either side were rare and largely opportunistic”, 
the report said.
