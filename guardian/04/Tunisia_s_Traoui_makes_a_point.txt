Mejdi Traoui scored with a stunning long-distance shot late in the game as 
Tunisia salvaged a 2-2 draw in their grudge match against Senegal at the 
African Cup of Nations yesterday.

Senegal looked set to take the points in the Group D game when Diomansy Kamara 
fired them in front midway through the second half. Issam Jomaa had put Tunisia 
ahead in the ninth minute and Moustapha Bayal Sall equalised before half-time.

Senegal were hoping for revenge after losing 1-0 to the North Africans in the 
2004 final when a fiery game ended with the Bolton Wanderers striker El Hadji 
Diouf, who was playing again yesterday, being restrained by his team-mates from 
attacking the referee.

Morocco's hat-trick hero Soufiane Alloudi will miss today's encounter with 
Guinea, the French national coach, Henri Michel, revealed yesterday. The 
in-form 24...#8209;year...#8209;old, who grabbed the first three goals in 
Monday's hugely impressive 5-1 win over Namibia in the opening game, was 
substituted in the second half after taking a knock on his knee.

"We hope he will be OK for the third game next week," Michel told reporters in 
Accra. "The injury is really unfortunate. He was our man of the match and it 
was the only black mark of the game for us." Morocco share top place with the 
host nation, Ghana, in Group A. If both teams win their games today they will 
qualify for the quarter-finals.Reuters
