Whisper to Me is an amazing, eye-opening book that was so gripping that I read 
it in one go.

I like the way that it’s written as one long email so there are no chapters as 
such. I prefer it like this because it makes the story continuous and without 
breaks, which is what makes it more gripping. It has very interesting and 
contrasting characters that are very believable and the plot is very tense and 
has lots of twists in it.

This book is really good because it covers lots of different styles and topics 
such as; murder mystery, depression, schizophrenia, prostitution and true love. 
I found that it introduced me to other genres that I would not usually read.

Cassandra’s mother is dead and her father does not seem to care about her. He 
spends more time with his pet bugs and insects than he does with her and he is 
also a workaholic. He is an ex army SEAL and suffers from post traumatic stress 
disorder, which leads to him getting extremely angry with Cassie.

In Cassie’s small town there is the Houdini Killer that goes around killing 
prostitutes (this is not as inappropriate as it sounds!). When Cassie becomes 
good friends with Paris, only for her to get kidnapped she tries to rescue her 
and with only a number plate to go by, is it impossible to save her? Can the 
boy that delivers fairground soft toys help her? Will she find Paris and true 
love along the way? Or will she have to choose one?
