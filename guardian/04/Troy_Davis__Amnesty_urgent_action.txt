Troy Anthony Davis was convicted of the murder of police officer Mark Allen 
MacPhail in 1991. Since 2007, Amnesty has campaigned intensively alongside 
Davis's family and other supporters for a series of new trials or hearings.

No physical evidence links Davis to the crime. Seven out of nine witnesses on 
whose evidence he was convicted in 1991 have since changed or retracted their 
testimony, with some citing police coercion.

In June 2010, Davis was given an opportunity to present new evidence that 
could prove his innocence at a hearing in Savannah, Georgia. However, despite 
ongoing doubts about his guilt, the judge ruled against him, putting him back 
on track for execution.

Davis has now exhausted all legal avenues to challenge the conviction. This 
means that the state of Georgia could set his execution date at any time.
Amnesty International <https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international> 
is now campaigning for mercy to be shown to him. It is Amnesty's hope that he 
will be exonerated and join the 138 people who have been released from death 
row since 1973.

Davis has said, "I would like to thank all of you very much from the depths of 
my heart because my family and I really need more people out there fighting for 
us and being our voice and showing support.

"And all of you have really opened the eyes of people all around the world 
about injustice, not only to me, but about the United States's legal system. 
And it's an honour to have all of you - your friendship, your support, your 
letters, and your activist work, it really means a lot."
