Paok Thessaloniki have the advantage after the first leg of their Champions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> play-off against 
Schalke, with Miroslav Stoch's 73rd-minute strike earning them a 1-1 draw in 
Gelsenkirchen. The hosts had gone 1-0 up after half an hour when Jefferson 
Farfan guided a shot in off the post.

The outcome was the same in Steaua Bucharest's home match against Legia Warsaw
. Federico Piovaccari put Steaua ahead in the first half by hoisting a bouncing 
ball over the advancing goalkeeper Dusan Kuciak, with Jakub Kosecki then making 
it 1-1 by sweeping home after the break.

A 2-0 away win put Austria Vienna firmly in the driving seat of their tie 
againstDinamo Zagreb, Marin Leovac and Marko Stankovic providing the goals in 
the final 22 minutes of the contest. In between those strikes Dinamo were 
reduced to 10 men when Ante Rukavina was sent off.

Basel also look very much in control of their play-off having triumphed 4-2 at 
Ludogorets Razgrad. The home side had come from behind to lead 2-1 thanks to 
goals from Marcelinho, who cancelled out Mohamed Salah's opener, and Ivan 
Stoyanov.

But Salah then brought things level once more and a Giovanni Sio finish and 
Fabian Schar penalty – awarded for a foul that earned Junior Caicara a red card 
– subsequently wrapped up the victory forBasel
