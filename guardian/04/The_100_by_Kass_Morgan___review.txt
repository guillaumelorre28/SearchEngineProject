During the nuclear war on earth, the Earth developed a radioactive surface, 
and for centuries afterwards what was left of humanity lived in spaceships 
above Earth’s surface. One hundred juvenile delinquents are to be sent to Earth 
to re-colonise and discover if it is possible to live on the 
thought-to-be-uninhabitable planet, but they are all expected to die. They 
survived.

The ships had started to run low on food supplies and air, so they are hoping 
to inhabit earth once again.

The book consists of four points of view, Clarke, Wells and Bellamy (who are 
sent to Earth), and Glass, who barely escaped the expected suicide mission. 
During the book, we glimpse in each characters’ past life and relationships, 
which they ponder in their thoughts. Even though Glass escaped being sent to 
Earth she has yet to learn that staying on the ship means certain death.

At first I didn’t think I would enjoy this book, because I don’t really read 
sci-fi and I got a little confused between the alternating characters’ views 
and pasts, but I soon adjusted and enjoyed the book thoroughly. An absolutely 
fascinating read, I haven’t read anything similar and I found the synopsis 
intriguing as we got to see views from the collapsing ship and Earth, which 
turns out not to be radioactive any longer.
