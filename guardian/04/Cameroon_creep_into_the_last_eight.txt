Cameroon squeaked into the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup, but the 
Indomitable Lions whimpered rather than roared in a scoreless and largely 
thrill-less encounter with Egypt, who needed a win to stay put. Cameroon's 
chances of lifting a record-breaking fifth title remain intact, but to do so 
they will need to improve.

"After our poor performance at the 2002 World Cup, I have made many changes," 
said Cameroon's coach Winfried Schafer. "We are bringing up a new team, but I 
am not worried, we will be good."

Egypt's manager Mohsen Salah has more to fret about, starting with the need to 
find a new job. "I have worked hard but I have failed," he said. "When I go 
back to Egypt I will resign, and I wish my replacement good luck."

In the group's other game Algeria lost 2-1 to Zimbabwe but qualify by virtue 
of having scored more goals than Egypt.

Sevilla's midfielder Julio Baptista has been called up by Brazil for the 
friendly in Ireland on February 18. However, Rivaldo was left out as he will be 
playing in the Libertadores Cup for Cruzeiro. Carlos Alberto Parreira picked 20 
European-based players and only two playing in Brazil - the goalkeeper Marcos 
and forward Luis Fabiano.

Internazionale's central defender Marco Materazzi has been suspended by the 
Italian FA until March 29 as a result of his clash with Siena's Bruno Cirillo 
after Sunday's game.

Cirillo appeared on live television sporting a cut lip and bruised face within 
minutes, claimed that the former Everton defender, who was not in Inter's 16 
for the game, had been taunting him throughout it. "Here's what Materazzi did," 
Cirillo said. "I want to tell everyone so people know what type of person he 
is. The linesman saw everything, now we'll see what happens."
