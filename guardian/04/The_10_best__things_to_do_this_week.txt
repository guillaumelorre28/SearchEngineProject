Planet Earth II

A gripping lizard/snake foot race. Bruising battles between Komodo dragons. 
And the deeply creepy sight of a swimming sloth. Last week’s opening episode of 
Planet Earth was every bit as spectacular 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/06/planet-earth-ii-review-david-attenboroughs-rollercoaster-tour-of-the-worlds-wildlife-returns>
 as you might have expected from a series 10 years in the making. But the 
show’s return is also bittersweet given the significant – even catastrophic – 
changes to the environment in the decade it has been off our screens. It 
continues on Sunday with an episode on those creatures who have to survive in 
mountainous areas, including warring snow leopards and lethal golden eagles.
Airs Sundays, 8pm, BBC1

From Midnight Special to Black Mirror, 2016 has been a strong year for smart 
sci-fi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/arrival-review-amy-adams-jeremy-renner-science-fiction>
. Now, we have a worthy addition to the canon with this moody effort from 
Sicario director Denis Villeneuve. Strange, egg-shaped spaceships suddenly 
start appearing on Earth, and it’s up to Amy Adams’s linguist to figure out 
whether they want war or peace.In cinemas now

 Star Wars Identities. 
Appealing to the Venn overlap between “likes Star Wars” and “is interested in 
the notion of identity”, this London O2 exhibition delves into how two 
genetically similar types (Skywalkers senior and junior)coud become such 
different people and, by extension, how all our personalities blossom. Merch, 
art and props all feature, and visitors can create their own character in a 
galaxy far, far away.

Books

The Secret History Of Twin Peaks

 Long before HBO’s Westworld or even Lost befuddled viewers with their riddles 
and elliptical storytelling, there was David Lynch’s Twin Peaks. The first TV 
headscratcher, it continues to inspire debate among fans 25 years after it 
first aired. Ahead of a much-anticipated new series in 2017, co-creator Mark 
Frost has released this rather handsome book, which – while not directly 
answering some of the show’s big questions – does maintain the sinister tone 
that made the original such a beguiling watch. It’s available to buy now.
