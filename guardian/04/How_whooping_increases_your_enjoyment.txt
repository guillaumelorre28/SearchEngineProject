Whatever the outcome of tonight’s Euro 2016 final, it’s the football fans – 
the well-behaved ones, at least – who really stole the show. From the Wales 
supporters’ wild euphoria to the Iceland fans’ coordinated clapping, 
celebrations in the stands were matched in pubs and living rooms around the 
world.

Because of the way the brain works, shouting and whooping when your team 
scores actually increases your enjoyment of the game. When you display how 
happy you are by jumping up and down and cheering, your body movements loop 
back to the emotion centres in the brain. This enhances these feelings of 
excitement, possibly making you jump around even more. While the origins of 
this feedback loop are probably social, to help us mirror and bond with those 
around us, it has evolved to be so powerful that it even works when you’re on 
your own. Just ask all the people startling their neighbours and knocking 
things over by accident when watching the match alone at home.

You can control this reaction, of course – for example, if you are watching 
the match secretly at work or in a library. But you will enjoy it less, however 
spectacular the goals are.
