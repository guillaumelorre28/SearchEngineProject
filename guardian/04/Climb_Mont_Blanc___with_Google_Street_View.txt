Mont Blanc, western Europe’s highest peak, can now be explored using Google 
Street View <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-street-view>, after 
a team from the company climbed to the top of the mountain range with a hi-tech 
Trekker camera.

The panoramic imagery 
<https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/street-view-mont-blanc.html>, 
available to view now, lets the viewer traverse the mountain, offering a 
360-degree look at the dramatic, snow-covered surroundings.

To complete the project the Street View team collaborated with some of the 
world’s most experienced mountaineers, and they can be spotted in the resulting 
images. Viewers can findKilian Jornet

, thanks to elite guideKorra Pesce <http://korrapesce.blogspot.com/>, who 
carried the Street View Trekker all the way to the summit and back down again. 
Google hopes the Street View imagery will also serve as an important digital 
record of Mont Blanc, which is being affected by global warming.

It’s not the first time Google Street View has taken on a vertical challenge. 
Last year the team mapped Yosemite national park’s infamous cliff faceEl Capitan

, with the help of renowned climbers Lynn Hill, Alex Honnold, and Tommy 
Caldwell.

Other impressive destinations to be mapped by Google over the last year 
include Peru’s Inca citadelMachu Picchu

 and Jordan’s desert temples atPetra
