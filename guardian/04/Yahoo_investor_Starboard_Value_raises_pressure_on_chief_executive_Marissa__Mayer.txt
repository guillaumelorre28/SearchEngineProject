The activist investor Starboard Value ramped up the pressure on Yahoo on 
Wednesday as it took aim at the company’s chief executive,Marissa Mayer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/marissa-mayer>, and her leadership team.

In a letter to the internet company’s board of directors, Starboard implied 
that Mayer and her fellow executives needed to go, without naming her 
specifically.

“To be successful, dramatically different thinking is required, together with 
significant changes across all aspects of the business starting at the board 
level, and including executive leadership,” Starboard chief Jeffrey Smith said 
in the letter.

Starboard, which owns about 0.75% of the company, has been pushing for changes 
at Yahoo since 2014, urging it to separate its Asian assets including stakes in 
Chinese e-commerce companyAlibaba <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba>
 and Yahoo Japan Corp, and auction off the core business, which includes search 
and advertising businesses. Yahoo shares were trading at around $32 yesterday, 
far from the 12-month high of $50.41.

“Unfortunately, it appears that shareholders have no confidence that 
management and the board will be able to execute on a separation of these 
assets or improve the performance of the core business,” Smith added.

Yahoo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo> is resisting the calls, 
instead pursuing a tax-free spinoff of the core business, which could take at 
least a year.

“If the board is sufficiently confident that their current management team has 
the right plan, then the board needs to prepare to be replaced because that’s 
probably going to happen,” said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.
