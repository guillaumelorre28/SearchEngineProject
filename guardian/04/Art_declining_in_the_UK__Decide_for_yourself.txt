Since 2007, a lot has changed in UK politics and business and there are 
abundant measures of those changes (however disputed those measures might be). 
But when it comes to the arts, numbers can seem like a thornier issue which has 
made for some difficult policy-making. 

The UK Arts <https://www.theguardian.com/education/arts> Index has attempted 
to overcome that by measuring what changed over the past five years, and 
looking at how those changes differ across the country. 

West End theatres relatively unaffected

Compared to other areas of the index, West End theatre has emerged fighting 
fit from the financial crisis. Looking at total revenue (including VAT) from 
the Society of London Theatre reveals that tourists and UK citizens continue to 
head there regularly.

£3.22 less public funding per person

In 2009/10, each person in the UK received around £19.64 in terms of public 
funding for the arts. Just two years later, that had dropped to £16.42.

Looking at where the money comes from reveals some slightly different patterns 
though; national lottery funding has almost doubled since 2007 while national 
funding from the Treasury and local government funding have dropped off.

Thousands more adults volunteering in the arts

Despite (or because of) that, the percentage of adults volunteering in the 
arts in the UK has increased from 1.7% in 2007/08 to 2.1% this year - an 
increase that represents almost a quarter of a million people.

Business contributions down 30%

In 2007/08, private companies were an important source of arts funding for 
each person in the UK, giving around £2.70 per person - a figure that has since 
fallen to £1.88.

Individual contributions have fallen too, albeit by a smaller amount (10%). 
Philanthropy <https://www.theguardian.com/society/philanthropy> still 
represents £6.15 of all private arts funding per person. 

Taken together, private investments continue to make up around 40% of all arts 
funding per person.

More 'high quality' arts

One surprising finding from this year's results is that despite the trends 
described above, 63% of adults now say that their last experience of the arts 
was of a "high quality" whereas just 57% said the same in 2007/08. Satisfaction 
levels with local provision are far lower though - around 41%. 

Fewer jobs

As a proportion of all jobs, employment in music, the visual and performing 
arts is slowly shrinking. Arts jobs now represent 0.4% of the total workforce. 
There are 736 fewer roles than there were in 2007.

Overall, it's a complex picture. This report attempts to package up these 20 
different measures into a single index which they claim demonstrates an 
overall, small rise in the arts since 2009/10.
