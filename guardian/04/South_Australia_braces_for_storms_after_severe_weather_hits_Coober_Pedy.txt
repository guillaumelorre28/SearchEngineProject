South Australians were warned to batten down the hatches on Tuesday as heavy 
rain and destructive winds hit the state.

More than 115mm of rain fell and wind gusts of up to 104km/h were felt around 
Coober Pedy on Tuesday.

The weather is being fed by the same severe weather system that caused 
flooding in the Northern Territory

.

Storms were due to hit Adelaide at about midnight, the Bureau of Meteorology 
said, with strong winds of up to 125km/h continuing throughout the night. Up to 
50mm of rain was set to hit the capital.

It was feared strong wind gusts might threaten powerlines, especially those 
that had been damaged before.

But the bureau’s regional director, John Nairn, said the weather pattern was a 
little different to that whichplunged the state into darkness

 in September.

“They are northerly winds and I’m aware that those big power lines are more 
exposed to westerly winds,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “So these are going 
to be winds that blow down the length of those connecting infrastructures up in 
the north.”

The SES advised people to move cars away from trees, secure loose items and 
stay indoors.
