The judges said the work "creates narrative out of chaos", is "absolutely 
forensic and consistently excellent" and "is important because the event is so 
contested." The in-depth investigation is presented in a multimedia format with 
an interactive map and timeline of the events.

Patrick Kingsley said "It's extremely humbling to win – particularly as I was 
actually rooting for Martin Chulov, who was also nominated, and whose work is a 
huge inspiration to me. None of it would have been possible without Charlie 
English – who commissioned the piece and has given me so much support this 
year. I'm very grateful to him, his wonderful team on the international desk – 
and particularly to Mowaffaq Safadi, who translated many of the interviews I 
did for this story."

The Frontline Club Awards annually recognises emerging talents and established 
names for outstanding work, in print, broadcast and photojournalism. The 
judging panel for 2013 included Carlotta Gall, Jon Lee Anderson, Patrick 
Cockburn, Gary Knight, Jeremy Bowen and Vaughan Smith. The winners were 
announced by Channel 4's Jon Snow.
