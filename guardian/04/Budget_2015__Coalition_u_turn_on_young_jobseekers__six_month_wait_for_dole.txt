The federal government has backed down on its plan to force young jobseekers 
to wait six months before accessing unemployment payments, budget papers will 
reveal.

Instead, jobseekers under the age of 25 will have to wait four weeks before 
they receive Newstart or Youth Allowance, an extension of the current one-week 
waiting period.

The six-month waiting period for under-30s was one of the most controversial 
savings measures listed in last year’s budget. It was slated to save $1.2bn and 
encourage more young people into paid employment.

But the policy stalled in the Senate after failing to secure the support of 
Labor, the Greens and the majority of crossbenchers.


The treasurer, Joe Hockey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/joe-hockey>, indicated that the 
policy would be scrapped when asked about it early on Tuesday morning.

“You’ll see a changed version of that,” he said. “You’ll see it tonight.” 

The backdown is part of the Coalition’s $330m jobs package.

It includes:

 *  $106m in support for jobseekers who face significant barriers to 
unemployment, including young migrants and people with mental illness; 
 * $212m for a youth transition to work program for people with long-term 
welfare dependency; 
 * $14m for early school leavers to get into work or study.
