Banking is reaching its “Uber moment” as technological advances will lead to 
hundreds of branch closures and a possible halving of people employed in the 
sector, the former chief executive ofBarclays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> has warned.

In a speech reported by Reuters 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/24/barclays-banking-employment-idUKL8N13J5G720151124>
, Antony Jenkins described technology as an “unstoppable force” that would lead 
to better customer service and a wave of new banks becoming household names.

Jenkins, who was ousted from Barclays in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins>
, said: “The number of branches and people employed in the financial services 
sector may decline by as much as 50% over the next 10 years, and even in a less 
harsh scenario I predict they will decline by at least 20%.”

“I’m predicting that over the next 10 years we will see a number of very 
significant disruptions in financial services, let’s call themUber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> moments,” he said, as new 
financial technology firms exploit their advantage over the incumbent players.

If his predictions come true, Barclays could cut between 26,000 and 66,000 
jobs worldwide, and shut between 280 and 700 branches on the high street.

Jenkins was delivering a speech at Chatham House entitled Approaching the Uber 
Moment in Financial Services. His successor at the helm of Barclays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive>
, Jes Staley, an American banker, takes over next week.

When he was in charge of Barclays, Jenkins regularly discussed the impact of 
new technology on the industry. As long ago as 2013,he had said he could 
foresee circumstances under which 40,000 roles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/07/barclays-antony-jenkins-foresees-40000-fewer-jobs>
 from the 140,000-strong workforce could be axed, as technology automated 
services and cut costs.

“This was not about replacing colleagues with robots,” he told his audience at 
Chatham House, but encouraging staff to focus on customers.

Barclays has been trying to lead the way with new technology alongside its 
branch network, introducing services such as Pingit which allows transactions 
on mobile phones.

New banks that will not have any branches are being established notably Atom 
bank, which intends to operate entirely as a smartphone app 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/25/atom-uber-online-banking>. 
Spanish bank BBVA this week took a 30% stake in Atom, spending £45m to get its 
first major foothold on retail customers in Britain.

“Truly digital banks ... won’t need to sustain a network of physical 
branches,” Jenkins said, adding that they could provide a much more personal 
service.

 But, he said, for it to be a true “Uber moment” the services need to be at 
least 10 times better than those already provided.

These new banks have advantages over the incumbent players, which are weighed 
down by high cost bases of branches and old technology. Eventually they may be 
forced into mergers, Jenkins said.

“The barriers to entry are quite high in financial services, so that will 
allow the incumbents to probably last longer than in many other industries,” he 
said.

“The risk is that incumbents will be pushed into this utility, capital-heavy 
role that we’ve seen in other industries like telecoms. Ultimately, that will 
become intolerable to shareholders, so we could see consolidation and mergers,” 
he said.


He also said there was a major challenge for the banking industry in 
recruiting staff, discussing his recent visit to Silicon Valley which he 
described as a “ruthless meritocracy”.

“If banks want to really compete for talent successfully, they are going to 
have to make themselves interesting places to work. It can’t just be about the 
money, because frankly the money isn’t going to be there the way it was before 
2008,” Jenkins said.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley predicted that banks would launch pilots and form 
new partnerships with fintech companies. They predicted the first moves would 
be on peer-to-peer lending and robo-advisers, a means of automating financial 
advice.

“We think the digital agenda will come even more to the fore in 2016 and see 
growing concern from some management teams about the threats,” the Morgan 
Stanley analysts said.
