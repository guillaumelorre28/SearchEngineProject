Neon: The Charged Line

Neon might once have been considered a quintessentially American medium but 
the British artists who have worked with it are numerous. Martin Creed, Tracey 
Emin, Cerith Wyn Evans and Eddie Peake are just some of the homebred talents to 
feature alongside international names in this major survey of neon art in, 
where else, Blackpool. Home to the world-famous Illuminations, first switched 
on in September 1879, the city has played a central role in the UK history of 
neon, as the Grundy seeks to prove with an exhibition that includes rare 1930s 
designs for the biggest free light show on earth.

You Say You Want a Revolution?

It was the age when Jean-Luc Godard made a film of the Rolling Stones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/21/28> rehearsing Sympathy for the 
Devil as an image of revolt, Jim Morrison rocked the Roundhouse and students 
seized the streets of Paris. This exhibition revisitsthe most intoxicating four 
years in modern cultural history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley>
, from 1966 to 1970, when some of the best rock music of all time was recorded 
and it seemed that youth and love were about to change the world. It all ended 
in acid meltdown and the mayhem of Altamont, but this exhibition claims that 
the legacy of the late 60s still shapes our age.

bonanza will feature exhibitions from more than 30 different countries, from 
Albania to the United Arab Emirates, structured around the theme “utopia”, in a 
nod to the 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s book. Explicitly “not a trade

Oslo Architecture Triennale

Coming at the end of a year of unprecedented global migration, the theme of 
this year’s Oslo Triennale couldn’t be more timely. Through exhibitions, 
debates and workshops, After Belonging will examine questions of citizenship, 
residence, property and identity in our fluid, globalised world. One highlight 
promises to be the New World Embassy, an installation that will explore the 
ideals of“stateless democracy” 
<http://www.debalie.nl/agenda/programma/stateless-democracy%3A-the-revolution-in-rojava-kurdistan/e_9757236/p_11680112/>

Graham Keen: 1966 and All That

Fifty years after Time magazine declared Swinging London the global capital of 
cool, comes an exhibition by one of the relatively overlooked visual 
chroniclers of that heady pop cultural moment. Graham Keen, now 80, 
photographed the new pop aristocracy, CND marchers and political agitators, 
working for Oz underground magazine. Curated by Terence Pepper and Lucy Bell, 
memorable images include Michael X meeting Muhammad Ali and a young Marc Bolan 
marching alongside Joan Baez, Donovan and Vanessa Redgrave.

Samson Kambalu

Kambalu’s terrific little films in which almost nothing happens, again and 
again, were a high point of the recent Liverpool Biennial. The Malawi-born 
artist and author has also been selected for an artist commission at the 
upcoming Frieze art fair this autumn. His first show at Kate MacGarry is a 
chance to catch up, or be surprised for the first time, by an artist whose work 
is full of life, humour and pathos.

Daphne Wright: Emotional Archaeology

Including casts of her sons and of animals, videos of children at play and 
people praying, agglomerations of domestic objects and works in unfired clay, 
Wright’s art is mostly concerned with relationships – between people, humans 
and animals, and between the living and the dead. The Arnolfini show runs 
parallel to two installations specially made for National Trust Tyntesfield.

Wifredo Lam

The modernist movement is sometimes accused of making a fetish of the 
“primitive”, taking inspiration from African and Pacific masks without caring 
about the people who made them. If so, then Wifredo Lam is a startling 
subversive who turned this cultural arrogance upside down. This Cuban painter 
moved in avant-garde circles in pre-second world war Paris, joined the 
surrealist movement, then returned home to paint his masterpiece The Jungle 
(1943) in which masked dancers move in a dreamlike space. Lam is a truly 
powerful modern artist who deserves to be much more famous. This is a 
much-needed retrospective for the man who painted Cuba into the story of modern 
art.

Richard Serra 

Old man Serra, he just keeps rolling out the steel. There are very few things 
in today’s art that can hold a candle to the formidable and moving sculpture of 
this great American artist – except perhaps his drawings. The Gagosian Gallery 
is showing both, in a two-site stunner that combines Serra’s latest colossal 
creation with his savagely bleak works on paper. His vision is as unforgiving 
and unquestionable as the blackness of a full stop.

Bedlam: The Asylum and Beyond

William Hogarth <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hogarth> 
immortalised 18th-century Bedlam, as London’s infamous lunatic asylum Bethlem 
Royal Hospital was nicknamed, in his painting of voyeurs from the world of the 
“sane” peering at its tragic denizens with their paper crowns and shaven heads. 
TheVictorian fairy artist Richard Dadd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/17/richard-dadd-victorian-artist-bedlam-mental-illness-fairies>
 was incarcerated at Bedlam after killing his father, and Boris Karloff even 
starred in a horror film set there. This exhibition takes London’s darkly 
mythic madhouse as a starting point to explore the history of asylums. When 
were mentally ill people first segregated from society and why did the asylum 
decline? Do we treat mental illness with any more understanding today?

Tracey Emin and William Blake 

When Tate Liverpool planned to put Tracey Emin’s My Bed on display, the artist 
asked for it to be shown alongside the works of the Romantic poet and 
printmaker William Blake. This promises to be a fascinating encounter between 
two great British artists who share a straight-talking beauty of voice and 
vision. Emin is the most creative and authentic of all the British artists who
leapt to fame in the 1990s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/12/tracey-emin-sarah-lucas-shop>
. What she most shares with Blake, who created his radical art in the age of 
the French Revolution, is a desire to change how we see and how we live.

William Kentridge: Thick Time 

Growing from his excoriating hand-drawn animations about apartheid in his 
native South Africa, William Kentridge’s art has developed and diversified into 
lecture/performances, full-blown installations and even opera direction. 
Kentridge’s exhibition features works about Leon Trotsky, the inexplicable 
nature of time, and models for his forthcoming production of Alban Berg’s Lulu 
(1935) forEnglish National Opera <https://www.eno.org/whats-on/lulu/>.

Lucia Nogueira

Brazilian-born sculptor Lucia Nogueira was a maker of delicate, violent, and 
psychologically intrusive and unstable objects. This rare UK exhibition, 
including work never shown before, is a reminder of just how inexplicably 
complex and rewarding her art was, and how her sculpture and drawing could both 
raise the hairs on the back of your neck and make you burst out laughing.

Jannis Kounellis


The man who made live parrots an art material reveals his latest work. At the 
age of 80, this Greek-born artist is very much of the moment, his installations 
with their often unpredictable elements and ecological sensibilities in tune 
with much younger artists. History will see him as the greatest artist of the
arte povera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/03/giuseppe-penone-arte-povera-whitechapel-gallery>
 movement that came together in 1960s Italy. It is not just that he is edgier 
than other arte povera artists: there is a profound sense of the history of 
things in his work, a gritty, poetic feel of the rural past and rage at the 
industrial present. There’s so much more to him than an undead parrot.

Mike Kelley: Framed and Frame

The uneven, sprawling work of troubled and talented LA artist Mike Kelley 
shows an endless curiosity and dark humour, and frequently had an 
autobiographical source. His giant two-part sculpture, Framed and Frame, has at 
its heart a Chinatown gateway and baroque, wishing well, recalling Kelley’s 
formative years in the LA punk-music scene.

Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture

A sparkly arrival to Washington DC’s sober National Mall, David Adjaye’s new 
museum building stands like a startling golden crown, erupting from the lawn 
between the slender obelisk of the Washington monument and the blank stone 
mausoleum of the National Museum of American History. Wrapped in a filigree 
skin of bronze-coloured aluminium panels – inspired by ironwork produced by 
enslaved craftsmen – the five-storey pavilion belies the vast size of this 
$540m (£409m) complex, more than half of which lies underground.
• Opens 24 September

Abstract Expressionism

At the end of the second world war, the art of New York had a seriousness and 
scope that left Europe far behind and established a truly sublime style of 
painterly freedom. Abstract expressionism is a mystery to this day – how did a 
nation that had seemed artistically provincial suddenly speak so powerfully and 
with such soul? Where did this grand and tragic sensibility come from – and 
where did it go? Today, a reality TV star spouts terrifying idiocy, and it is 
called politics. Once America produced a Pollock, a Willem de Kooning, a Mark 
Rothko … see them and weep.

? The Image as Question: An Exploration of Evidential Photography

Though photographers as diverse as Peter Beard and Weegee, Harold Edgerton and 
Simon Norfolk, this exhibition looks at how documentary photographs were used 
in the past to illustrate facts or provide evidence and how, over the years, 
those same images have accrued new meanings and become unmoored from their 
original contexts. Taken from Michael Hoppen’s personal collection, the images 
add up to a visual inventory of the strange and familiar.

Turner prize

Featuring sculptors Michael Dean, Helen Marten, multimedia artist Anthea 
Hamilton and photographer and installation artist Josephine Pryde, this year’s 
prize looks a much more balanced show than in recent years. There might even be 
a conversation here about the nature of objects and images, and the ways in 
which we read them.

 Trafalgar square gets the thumb’s-up ... Really Good by David Shrigley. 
David Shrigley <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-shrigley>: 
Really Good

What we need now is a big, positive symbol on the empty plinth in Trafalgar 
Square. Fist clenched, thumb erect, Shrigley’s gigantic bronze thumb’s-up will 
show not only that London is open for business, but that we’ve fixed a chirpy, 
cheeky stoic’s death-rictus grin to our faces. Shrigley’s ludicrous monument 
arrives with a horrible timeliness. Maybe it is timeless too, like Stonehenge. 
Really Good, really.
• From 29 September, Fourth Plinth, Trafalgar Square, London.

Helen Marten: Drunk Brown House 

Marten’s curious and original syntax weaves sculpture, painting, objects and 
images together in her gorgeous and dumbfounding art, in which every last 
detail counts as a clue, an inference or a visual rhyme. Her Serpentine show 
coincides with her Turner prize exhibition. Also nominated for the inaugural 
Hepworth sculpture prize, Marten’s art is as refreshing as it is bewildering.

Marc Camille Chaimowicz 

Rock art comes to the Serpentine – glam rock, that is. Marc Camille Chaimowicz 
burst on to the boringly serious art scene of the early 1970s with scatterings 
of glitter, David Bowie soundtracks and homages to Jean Cocteau in an exuberant 
and sexy version of conceptual art that’s hugely admired by younger artists 
today. His art is full of feeling, and this retrospective reflects that in its 
title,: An Autumn Lexicon. See it while the leaves are falling.

 protesting that while only 5% of the artists in the modern section of New 
York’s Metropolitan Museum are women, 85% of its nudes are female is definitive 
in that way (the figure was still at 4% and 76% when they updated the work in 
2011). But wait, the Guerrilla Girls are not just a name in every modern 
art-history book, they’re real, and they’re in the UK to point out – with 
copious amounts of freshly researched data – that women artists are even more 
marginalised in Europe than in the US.

Opus Anglicanum: Masterpieces of English Medieval Embroidery

Today we pride ourselves on art that radically defies boundaries between 
media, but that would have seemed completely normal in the middle ages, when 
visual beauty was found as happily in coloured glass or the pages of a book as 
in a painting or statue. This exhibition reveals another aspect of medieval 
beauty, embroidery, and asks us to admire ecclesiastical robes and other 
centuries-old textiles as works of art. Medieval England was so famous for its 
fine embroidery there is a name for it – “English work”, or in Latin, Opus 
Anglicanum.

Philippe Parreno Hyundai Commission 2016 

An ideal artist to occupy the Turbine Hall, Parreno has previously taken on 
Paris’s Palais de Tokyo and New York’s Park Avenue Armory, filling them with 
ensembles of musical canopies, fields of snow, videos, sounds and furies and 
enchantments. The French artist’s exhibitions are mental journeys as much as 
physical engagements, that evolve over time. I do not say this lightly, but be 
prepared to be astonished, beguiled and moved.

Frieze and Frieze Masters art fairs

Here we go again in the annual double whammy of rampant oligarchical 
consumerism, blue-chip wonders and dumb artefacts, specially commissioned 
films, a rolling season of talks, and a cast of wandering celebs, walking

things you wish you’d never seen and things you can’t quite believe the human 
mind had the misplaced wit to concoct.

Beyond Caravaggio

The scathing realism of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio did not end with his 
death in 1610. This dangerous artist – dangerous aesthetically in his 
destruction of any emotional screen between a painting and its beholder, 
dangerous in person if he had his sword with him – inspired a legion of 
followers with his dark charisma. These “Caravaggisti” spread his influence all 
over Europe. This exhibition starts with Caravaggio himself and goes on to 
reveal the power of such 17th-century disciples as Georges de la Tour and 
Jusepe de Ribera. It is a shadowy voyage through the afterlife of one of 
Europe’s most unsettling and mesmerising artists.

“Vulgarity,” says the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/adam-phillips-life-in-writing>, 
“exposes the scandal of good taste.” Together with fashion curator Judith 
Clark, he is preparing to expose the great scandal in all its extravagant, 
ostentatious and downright crude glory. From a pair of 18th-century “mantua” 
gowns, with 2.5-metre-wide overskirts, to Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm 
McLaren’s“tits top” <http://www.paulgormanis.com/?p=4470>, and Walter van 
Beirendonck’selephant skirt <https://www.flickr.com/photos/pasteques/4365184864>
, the exhibition will shine a garish light on a world of fashion where taste 
knows no bounds.

Rodin and Dance 

The art of Rodin is powerfully torn between tradition and modernity, 
responding to the flow and speed of a new kind of world while holding on to the 
gesture, portrayal and narrative that enable sculpture to make haunting public 
statements. This exhibition reveals yet another dimension to his genius as it 
explores his study of dance and movement in drawings and small sculptures of 
terracotta and plaster. It promises an intimate glimpse of some of Rodin’s last 
works and final visions.

Yves Klein

The man who leapt into the void in suburban Paris, used women as living 
paintbrushes, painted with fire (with fireman on hand) and turned the world, 
canvases and sculptures an incandescent patented blue arrives at Tate Liverpool 
to ravish, annoy, rock the eyeballs and make us laugh. One critic said Klein 
had the kind of taste that kept an ocelot for a pet. Sounds good to me.

Paul Nash

Surrealist, Romantic, official artist in both world wars, photographer and 
writer (and sometime art critic), Paul Nash was the greatest English modernist, 
whose art was a synthesis both of artistic conflict and personal difficulty, 
and borne out of the horrors of the century itself, with its shell-cratered 
landscapes and acres of twisted airplane wreckage, seen under a gibbous moon.

South Africa: The Art of a Nation

The oldest known work of art is a piece of ochre incised with abstract lines 
found at Blombos cave. It was made about 70,000 years ago (at a site in use 
100,000 years ago), and people have been creating all kinds of art in South 
Africa ever since. In the 19th century, the San hunter-gatherers were still 
making rock art reminiscent of ice-age cave painting. This and other traditions 
suffered at the hands of colonialism and apartheid. But today’s SA celebrates 
its complex cultural heritage, and this exhibition promises an epic survey from 
the first efforts of Homo sapiens to contemporary installations. It should be a 
trek worth taking.

Intrigue: James Ensor by Luc Tuymans

Masks, skulls, madness and light fill the half-English, Ostend painter’s rich 
and disturbing art, selected by fellow Belgian painterLuc Tuymans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/oct/29/luc-tuymans-artist-interview-video>
. Ensor (1860-1949) was part-symbolist, part-expressionist and visionary, and 
his carnivalesque art, rooted as much in a sense of place as in his 
imagination, is a foil to Tuyman’s own deadpan morbid humour.

The new Design Museum

Breathing welcome life into the swooping concrete tent of Kensington’s 1960s 
Commonwealth Institute, the new Design Museum will finally open its doors in 
November, two years later than originally planned, upping sticks from its Shad 
Thames home. Masterminded by arch-minimalist John Pawson, the renovated 
building will triple the museum’s current exhibition space to almost 10,000 
square metres, promising to “do to design what Tate Modern did for contemporary 
art”.
• Opens 24 November <https://designmuseum.org/>.

Robert Rauschenberg 

One of the most liberating and poetic artists of the last 100 years, Robert 
Rauschenberg showed the way forward for art after the dream of early modernism 
was exhausted. His complex but always deeply humane creations weave an 
endlessly rich meditation on art and life as they voraciously, generously gorge 
on love, memory, photographs and relics. Rauschenberg makes most art seem 
one-dimensional.• 1 December to 2 April, Tate Modern, London

Joan Eardley

When this powerful Scottish artist died in 1963 at the age of just 42, she 
left behind indelible images of Glasgow street kids that belong alongside Jean 
Dubuffet and Frank Auerbach in the raw, tough art of postwar Europe. Eardley 
always painted the places and people she knew: as well as urban Glasgow, she 
created vivid images of the fishing village of Catterline. This exhibition 
includes her sketches and photographs to reveal one of the most memorable 
artists of modern Scotland.
