Do we need 24 teams in this competition? Well, maybe not. Except, how can we 
even contemplate fewer after watching the Albanians go at it. They now have a 
reasonable chance of making the knockouts - they need results to go for them, 
and all look possible. Sweden and Ireland fail to beat Belgium and Italy, and 
then either Czech Republic and Turkey draw, or Germany cane Northern Ireland. 
Either way, they’ve made a major contribution to this tournament.

Anyhow, thanks all for your company and comments - night night.

90+5 min Abrashi chases down the goalline and overruns the ball but slides in 
heroically, forcing a corner! That will be it!

90+4 min Romania have created almost nothing these last ten minutes; Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have prevented them creating 
almost nothing these last ten minutes. Stanciue finds space outside the box, 
smashes a shot over, and this is basically done!

90+3 min Torja shoves Lila to the ground, and is booked. The ref somehow 
avoids awarding a free-kick, but it makes no odds -Albania

90+2 min France and Switzerland have drawn 0-0. Memushaj, who has been superb, 
flicks a ball around the corner, putting Roshi in, but draws the foul at the 
same time. More time elapses, and the ball goes towards Cana at the far post - 
he hads into the keeper’s arms.

84 min Again, Torje breaks with conviction, attacking the Albanian box - so 
Ajeti kncks him over from behind. Free-kick, 30 yards out, just left of centre, 
and Memushaj is booked for encroachment before Torje’s kick hits the wall.

76 min That’s more like it from Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, a lively touch from Torje 
finding Sanmartean, who flicks himself, finding Andone. From just inside the 
box, he absolutely rousts a drive that clips the bar and shoots over the top. 
Great move, great effort.

just outside their box and Romania fly forwards, but Ajeti does superbly to 
marshall Stanciu away from goal before diving in and rescuing possession.

72 min Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> break the 
Albanian line down the right, and just as Torje crosses, up goes the flag. and 
up goes Balaj’s thumb, thanking the linesman for his benevolence - for that was 
on, and he knew it.

the right, hurled at Balaj to chest down for Memushaj to shoot. He doesn’t

develop.

66 min Lovely from Sanmartean, who rides one tackle then another, taking care 
to hurtle over it and win a free-kick, 30 yards out, left of centre. He takes 
it himself, looking to go round the far side of the wall, instead hitting his 
team-mate. Not that it made much difference - it was not going to trouble 
Berisha.

65 min Sanmartean fouls Lenjani for no reason, and Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have another free-kick close to 
the corner flag, this time on the left. But by the time it comes over, the 
ref’s spotted a foul, and Romania start again.

Match report

Armando Sadiku winner makes Albania history in win over Romania
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/19/romania-albania-euro-2016-match-report> 
Do we need 24 teams in this competition? Well, maybe not. Except, how can we 
even contemplate fewer after watching the Albanians go at it. They now have a 
reasonable chance of making the knockouts - they need results to go for them, 
and all look possible. Sweden and Ireland fail to beat Belgium and Italy, and 
then either Czech Republic and Turkey draw, or Germany cane Northern Ireland. 
Either way, they’ve made a major contribution to this tournament.

Anyhow, thanks all for your company and comments - night night. 

 
ALBANIA HAVE THEIR FIRST WIN IN TOURNAMENT FOOTBALL! WHAT A PERFORMANCE THAT 
WAS! THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR THE SECOND PHASE - ROMANIA ARE OFF HAME!

90+5 min Abrashi chases down the goalline and overruns the ball but slides in 
heroically, forcing a corner! That will be it!
 
90+4 min Romania have created almost nothing these last ten minutes; Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have prevented them creating 
almost nothing these last ten minutes. Stanciue finds space outside the box, 
smashes a shot over, and this is basically done!
 
90+3 min Torja shoves Lila to the ground, and is booked. The ref somehow 
avoids awarding a free-kick, but it makes no odds -Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> clear when the ball comes in, 
AND THEY’RE NEARLY THERE!
 
90+2 min France and Switzerland have drawn 0-0. Memushaj, who has been superb, 
flicks a ball around the corner, putting Roshi in, but draws the foul at the 
same time. More time elapses, and the ball goes towards Cana at the far post - 
he hads into the keeper’s arms.
 
90+1 min Memushaj and Roshi do very well to win a corner down the left, then 
equally well to spend 30 seconds not taking it.
 
90 min One of the Albanians is down, clutching his head and face, so there’s a 
short break while he pretends to recover. There’ll be a minimum additional five 
minutes of play.
 
89 min But Andone throws himself at a short ball, knocking Mavraj out of the 
road - only for Ajeti, who has been superb, to block tackle a clearance. That’s 
an actual block tackle, not one of these.
 
88 min Lyon is about to witness the mother, father, any other of all parties. 
 
87 min Monstrous effort from Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> to win another corner, this time 
from right, and from it comes another free header - Hysaj guides it wide from 
10 yards.
  The Albanian fans cheer on their team, a famous victory could be on the cards.

86 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> break, and 
Roshi’s fresh legs pace downfield, winning a corner - he exhorts the fans to 
even greater efforts, then Mavraj wins the header at the near post, ruffling 
the side-netting and causing some to celebrate the clinching goal.
 
84 min Again, Torje breaks with conviction, attacking the Albanian box - so 
Ajeti kncks him over from behind. Free-kick, 30 yards out, just left of centre, 
and Memushaj is booked for encroachment before Torje’s kick hits the wall.

Cipriani/AP  
83 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> make their final 
change, Cana on for Basha.
 
81 min Stanciu weaves past Basha 40 yards out and accelerates towards goal, 
but as he shoots his left foot gives way and the ball flies miles over the top. 
The Albanian fans are absolutely having it.
 
79 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> are sitting in 
now, and Romania’s changes have made a differenc, or, put another way, 
Iordanescu got his team wrong. No, you tell him.
 
78 min Change for Albania: Roshi replaces Lenjani. 
 
76 min That’s more like it from Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, a lively touch from Torje 
finding Sanmartean, who flicks himself, finding Andone. From just inside the 
box, he absolutely rousts a drive that clips the bar and shoots over the top. 
Great move, great effort.
 
75 min France-Switzerland is still 0-0 and Payet has just hit the bar - but 
they don’t need to start playing for another 14 minutes.
 
74 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> gives it away 
just outside their box and Romania fly forwards, but Ajeti does superbly to 
marshall Stanciu away from goal before diving in and rescuing possession.

72 min Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> break the 
Albanian line down the right, and just as Torje crosses, up goes the flag. and 
up goes Balaj’s thumb, thanking the linesman for his benevolence - for that was 
on, and he knew it.
 
71 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> win a throw on 
the right, hurled at Balaj to chest down for Memushaj to shoot. He doesn’t 
trouble Tatarusanu, but really, Romania had no business allowing that to 
develop.
 
70 min Romania have 20 minutes to save themselves. They really do not look 
like so doing.
 
68 min Final change for Romania: Andone replaces “Big” Popa. 
 
66 min Lovely from Sanmartean, who rides one tackle then another, taking care 
to hurtle over it and win a free-kick, 30 yards out, left of centre. He takes 
it himself, looking to go round the far side of the wall, instead hitting his 
team-mate. Not that it made much difference - it was not going to trouble 
Berisha.
 
65 min Sanmartean fouls Lenjani for no reason, and Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> have another free-kick close to 
the corner flag, this time on the left. But by the time it comes over, the 
ref’s spotted a foul, and Romania start again.
 
63 min Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> haven’t shown 
much in attack this last bit, but then the outstanding Memushaj wriggles 
between two spaces just outside the right corner of the box, swinging though a 
snap=shot that forces Berisha to beat away.
 
61 min Some conviction from Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, Sanmartean finding Torje who 
spreads wide to the right. Sapunaru then crosses, winning a corner which comes 
to nothing.
 
60 min When did attacking players become known as “progressive”? The first 
usage I can recall is Alex Ferguson talking about Kleberson. Surely that 
should’ve been an end to it?
 
59 min Lila jumps and Matel nails him with the little leg nudge that sends him 
toppling. No one seems to mind too much, though it looks a right sair yin.
 
59 min Change for Albania: “the goalscorer Sadiku” departs; Balaj replaces him.
 
58 min Joy we’ll never know.
UEFA EURO 2016 (@UEFAEURO) 
Sadiku's sixth goal for #ALB <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ALB?src=hash> - and 
surely his most memorable.#EURO2016

57 min Torje replaces Alibec, who departs on a stretcher, gesticulating.
