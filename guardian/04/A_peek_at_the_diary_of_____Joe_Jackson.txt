I continue to be amazed at my ability to compartmentalise my trauma. It's such 
a special gift. Take the burial. Knowing that the grave will become a place of 
pilgrimage for the many millions who loved my son, Michael, I wanted the 
perfect floral tribute to lay there - a way of expressing my grief and love 
through the medium of flowers. So I got the florist to make up a tribute 
reading "CALL 1-800- BLU-RAY TODAY". It's beautiful; it spans four graves. 
Ought to find out whose, and bill their families for all the free publicity I'm 
getting them.

But it's wonderful having kids around my house again. I love children. Yes, I 
love Prince, Paris and ... the other one. Coverlet? Comforter? Whatever the 
little brat's name is. I love them all. It's a beautiful thing.

Of course, they've been spoilt. They're still whining about missing their 
daddy, but like I keep telling them, the best way to get over it is to do what 
their grampa's been doing: to see daddy's bizarre and untimely passing as a 
beautiful opportunity from God, and to throw themselves into their work. And 
four hours of harmonies practice later, let me tell you those kids weren't 
whining any more. They were crying with gratitude for the opportunity their 
grandaddy's given them.

Like I screamed lovingly at them: millions of kids would kill to be in The 
Michael Jackson <https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson> Juniors. Now 
keep practising while I go and work my magic on your uncles, the Jackson Four. 
Yes, it never stops. Everybody wants a piece of Joe Jackson.
