This autumn’s films will be full of exceedingly intense actors playing 
exceedingly intense men in glasses: Tom Hardy as Ronnie Kray in his half-rimmed 
spectacles; Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs in his rimless ones; Dane DeHaan 
as James Dean in his tortoiseshells. Men’s glasses are about to have a fashion 
moment,and it’s about time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/feb/24/book-doctor-wearing-glasses>
. Glasses can make you appear cleverer in a job interview, they can be lowered 
slightly and peered over quizzically, they can be whipped off in complete 
exasperation. Also, they’ll improve your vision – no longer will life pass you 
by in a vague and abstract blur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/31/glasses-latest-must-have-accessory>
. Here are five frame styles from the silver screen.

Ronnie Kray

In the (rather tasty) trailer for Legend, Hardy plays both Kray twins, Reggie 
and Ronnie. You can tell them apart because the latter wearsnice 60s glasses 
and a permanently displeased expression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/18/niece-of-kray-wife-frances-shea-mortified-by-biopic-starring-tom-hardy>
 – like Mark Lamarr on Shooting Stars – and acts like an absolute nutcase.

Reggie didn’t wear glasses, except once when he snuck into Dartmoor prison in 
disguise to visit Frank “The Mad Axeman” Mitchell. “Of course, I stuck a hat on 
and a pair of heavy glasses,” he recalled in his memoir. But Ronnie was 
renowned for his half-rimmed spectacles, with which he exuded an air of 
studious menace. “When he was in Broadmoor, he had a tortoiseshell pair,”his 
wife, Kate Kray, explained recently 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/husband-ronnie-kray-wife-london-3701361>
, “because I wore a pair on one visit and he said he wanted glasses like mine.” 
Last summer, she sold off his original frames at a rural auctioneers in 
Towcester, Northamptonshire, but Ray-Ban makes a rather similar model.

 Life, starring Dane DeHaan as James Dean. Photograph: AMF Photographs 
In Anton Corbijn’s forthcoming film Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/life-trailer-anton-corbijn-james-dean-biopic-trailer-debut>
, about James Dean (more specifically, about photographer Dennis Stock shooting 
thethen-unknown actor for Life magazine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/dec/06/dennis-stock-magnum-american-cool-in-pictures>
), DeHaan spends much of the time moping around in Dean’s trademark 
tortoiseshell spectacles, smoking cigarettes and squinting. There’s something 
quite cool and arty about wearing glasses and smoking. It brings to mind Andy 
Warhol and David Hockney, and suggests an intoxicating mix of wild nights out 
and nerdy afternoons in. It’s bad for your heart, but good for your sight. It 
suggests a very cinematic inner complexity.

Photograph: Corbis 
Whatever you may think of Apple products, Steve Jobs certainly knew a thing or 
two about stylish design; his look was inspired, apparently, by a calligraphy 
class he took after dropping out of college. His signature black rollneck has 
already swept through the world of menswear: JW Anderson and Raf Simons showed 
variants of it on their catwalks, and everybody followed suit. Now, with 
Michael Fassbender portraying the Apple founder in a second biopic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/27/danny-boyle-steve-jobs-new-york-film-fest>
 (this time directed by Danny Boyle, so it will be much better than the 
atrocious first effort, Jobs), the signature rimless spectacles are set to do 
the same. These are the most serious, business-like frames out there.

 Colin Firth as George in A Single Man. 
Tom Ford’s directorial debut A Single Man (2009) was sad, yes, but also very 
stylish <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review>. Its 
abiding image was George Falconer (Colin Firth) in his suit, tie and thick, 
horn-rimmed vintage frames. These were extra large – allowing him to clearly 
see all the tragedy, regret and longing in the world. They were also very 
popular, so much so that Ford eventually released his own take on the classic 
frame: the TF 5178.

 Really, though, if we’re thinking about glasses from recent cinema, then 
Harry Potter’s thin, round metal frames are the mosticonic and the most magical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter>. They’re not just for imaginary 
wizards – Le Corbusier and John Lennon also favoured something similar. If 
you’re interested in looking like a sorcerer, a modern architect or an 
experimental musician (or an owl professor), these are a little unusual and 
well worth trying on for size.
