Smith, the department's minister of state, leads on the Office of the 
Government Chief Information Officer, Information Security and Assurance, 
according to a full list of ministerial responsibilities released on 14 October.

Before joining the Cabinet Office, Smith was parliamentary private secretary 
to Yvette Cooper at Communities and Local Government and the Treasury, and had 
joined the Transport Select Committee. She has campaigned on jobs for steel 
workers in Sheffield and for transport investment in the north of England.

The government was reshuffled in July. At the time the government confirmed 
Stephen Timms' new role as Digital Britain minister at the Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills and Mike O'Brien's responsibility for NHS IT at 
the Department of Health. Lord Brett is covering for Meg Hillier at the Home 
Office during her maternity leave, leading on identity cards, criminal records 
and the Independent Safeguarding Authority.

The new list also shows that Jim Knight's responsibilities at the Department 
for Work and Pensions include digital inclusion, Directgov, departmental IT and 
data security. At the Department for Children, Schools and Families, Diana 
Johnson's responsibilities include ICT and the digital curriculum. However, 
Baroness Morgan of Drefelin leads on the ContactPoint database of children in 
England.
