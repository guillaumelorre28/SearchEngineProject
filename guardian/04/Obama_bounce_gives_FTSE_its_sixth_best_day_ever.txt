The FTSE 100 recorded its sixth best day ever 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/table/2008/sep/19/ftse100.best.days> today 
amid enthusiasm for Barack Obama's planned stimulus package for the US economy.

The London markets lapped up the US president-elect's proposals to spend 
hundreds of billions of dollars creating some 2.5 million jobs on a public 
works campaign.

Hopes that the US car industry would be bailed out also buoyed sentiment, with 
£61bn added to the value of London's leading shares.

The index was strongly positive all day, eventually closing at 4300.06 – some 
250.69 points or 6.19% up on Friday night's close and its best level for four 
weeks.

In one day, the blue-chip index wiped out last week's loss of 238.64 points.

Financial stocks were strong, led by Prudential, up more than 23% or 67.5p at 
358.5p.

Insurer Old Mutual rose more than 15% or 6.6p to 49.7p, while Barclays led the 
high-street banks, up 14% or 19.6p to 157.9p.

The miners and oil companies also boomed, thanks to rising commodity prices.

The FTSE 100 had just three fallers, including two - transport group Stagecoach
 and oil firmJohn Wood - that are tipped to drop out of the index at its 
quarterly review on Wednesday.

Stagecoach <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stagecoachgroup>, which 
warned last week that its rail operations would be hit by job losses in London, 
dropped 4.5p to 114.8p, while John Wood fell 8.1p to 155.7p.

Others tipped for the drop include the miners Lonmin and Fresnillo, and oil 
companyPetrofac, while candidates for promotion include insurer Amlin and Home 
Retail, the owner of Argos and Homebase.

Down in the FTSE 250, shares in Russia-focused group Imperial Energy fell more 
than 17% after the Takeover Panel said Indian group ONGC could not take any 
more time over its bid.

ONGC had challenged an earlier ruling that it should not have an extension, 
but a Panel committee today upheld the original decision.

ONGC, which does not intend to appeal against the latest ruling, now has to 
post its offer document by tomorrow night.

Despite the shares falling 180p to 850p, sources close to the deal said there 
was no reason for any last-minute hitch.

The bid values Imperial at £12.50 a share and has already received the 
approval of the Russian authorities.

Entertainment Rights, the owner of Postman Pat and Basil Brush, appointed a 
chief executive and announced new bank facilities today, sending its bombed–out 
shares up 0.2p to 0.95p.

The company said its north American chief and former Disney executive, Deborah 
Dugan, would replace Nick Phillips, who left last week after less than nine 
months at the company.

The debt-laden group said it had secured additional funding of £13m from HBOS 
to keep cash flowing until the end of February.

Another media minnow, Media Corporation, saw its shares rise by 44% - up 0.5p 
to 1.63p - after it signed a £2m two-year deal to manage advertising on Express 
Newspapers websites.

Finally, shares in Aim-listed medical company Plethora surged nearly 20% or 
3.5p to 21.5p after the company raised £1m to continue developing a treatment 
for premature ejaculation.
