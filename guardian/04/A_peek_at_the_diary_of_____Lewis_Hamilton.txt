2009 is not a year on which I'll look back with unadulterated pleasure. In the 
words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be a 
season horribilis

I find myself gripped by a sort of Byronic disillusionment with formula one, 
and hanker for those old days in the lower leagues, where it was all about the 
racing and the honour. Money means nothing to me, as people would see if they 
knew me. Unfortunately, I can spend only a few days in the UK each year for tax 
reasons, so this false impression of me builds up.

To outsiders, the world's decision to pigeonhole me as an abundantly praised, 
lavishly rewarded driver of extraordinary talent may seem to be a victimless 
crime. But the reality ofLewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> MBE is different. Spygate, 
Liargate, My-Car-Is-No-Longer-Much-Cop-gate - why must misfortune dog me at 
every chicane?

Still, like I told the papers after the Monaco Grand Prix, I think of myself 
as Rocky Balboa. Not like in Rocky III, where he's got really rich, lost sight 
of his values and spends all his time promoting his sponsors, and then along 
comes a sort of Jenson Button figure in the form of Mr T, who's been grafting 
away in dirty gyms, and basically KOs him for his hubris. So not like that. 
More like Rocky in Rocky I, with the running up the steps and the shy 
girlfriend. I realise Adrian worked in a pet shop, while my Nicole is lead 
singer with the painfully retiring Pussycat Dolls. But otherwise the 
similarities are eerie.
