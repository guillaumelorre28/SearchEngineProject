About 1,500 moose live in and around Anchorage, Alaska 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/26/alaska-anchorage-moose-roam-free>
, (population 300,000) and this time of year is calving season. The animals 
usually give birth in the city’s many wooded parks and the occasional 
residential back yard, but this week, a female moose gave birth to a tiny, 
spindle-legged calf in the parking lot of a large mall, right outside a Lowe’s 
home-improvement store.


Onlookers with smartphones and local media documented the event. When the 
little moose took its first steps, people cheered. The mall where the birth 
happened is relatively new. It wasn’t long ago that the area was just a stretch 
of woods.

“A lot of times moose will return to give birth the same place they were 
born,” saidErin Kirkland <http://akonthego.com/blog/>, an Anchorage-based 
family travel writer and outdoor advocate. “I wonder if she’s just returning.”

Kirkland said there are moose “regulars” that appear in her neighborhood to 
calve year after year. She’s careful to warn her kids to give the animals 
space, especially when they have small calves. Moose can be temperamental. A 
female moosewho may have had a calf trampled a pair of women walking

 in a city park on 27 May. Kirkland was happy that the people watching the 
moose in the parking lot seemed to respect the animal.

“It’s an amazing thing that they manage to live in the middle of this urban 
growth,” she said.
