Mali qualified for the semi-finals in Kayes yesterday, a 2-0 victory over 
South Africa sparking scenes of jubilation across the country and a mass pitch 
invasion on the final whistle in which Bassala Touré, the scorer of the host 
nation's first goal, was injured after being submerged beneath a sea of 
celebrating fans.

It was Touré's thunderous shot, placed wide of Hans Vonk's outstretched arm 
after the Mali striker jinked into the box, that ignited what had been a 
ponderous match just after the hour.

South Africa did not seriously threaten until they were forced to push 
forward. Their substitute Delron Buckley came closest, volleying a loose ball 
from a poorly defended corner only for Boubacar Diarra to clear off the line.

Touré once again proved South Africa's undoing in injury-time, passing low 
into the area for Dramane Coulibaly to tap home. Coulibaly ripped off his 
shirt, laid it neatly on the pitch and danced around it with his team-mates. 
Within seconds they had been joined by several thousand uninvited partners.

This is only the third occasion that Mali have competed in the finals of this 
tournament, and they have reached the semi-finals every time. They were joined 
at that stage by Nigeria, who beat Ghana 1-0 in Bamako last night thanks to a 
late, great goal by Garba Lawal.

Having spurned several chances it appeared that the Super Eagles were to be 
taken to extra-time until, in the 80th minute, the midfielder reacted first to 
a poor clearance and volleyed into the corner of Sammy Adjei's goal from 30 
yards.
