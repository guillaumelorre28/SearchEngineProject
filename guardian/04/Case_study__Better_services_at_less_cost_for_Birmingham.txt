As chief executive of Birmingham city council, Stephen Hughes is overseeing 
the city's role in the government's 13 Total Place pilot scheme, where agencies 
are looking at ways they can provide better public services at less cost.

"We calculated that £7.5bn a year was being spent each year by Birmingham's 
public services [including health, education, social care, other council 
services and police and probation] on a population of around 1 million people. 
We want better outcomes for less money by working together to redesign 
services. We have calculated that for every £1 spent on children's early years 
intervention all public services would save £4 further down the line in terms 
of, say, the costs of antisocial behaviour and treating severe health problems.

Joint commissioning and joint budgets are ways to break down silos … but 
getting organisations to work towards common goals and focus on common 
outcomes, which I believe is key to more effective public services, requires 
changes from central government. Each Whitehall department currently measures 
performance in a different way.

"What we need is one set of performance criteria per area, not agency. And 
instead of each agency having to account for every last penny it spends, this 
again could be done by place. So to collectively provide better public services 
with the resources we will have that focus on outcomes, target the right people 
and are more preventative, requires political leadership to make it happen. We 
haven't got all the answers yet, but the alternative is not palatable."
