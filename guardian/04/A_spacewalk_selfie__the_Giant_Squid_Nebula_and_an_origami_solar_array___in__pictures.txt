On 24 August a flare erupted from the sun, seen on the left edge of our home 
star in this image from Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (above). Solar flares 
are powerful bursts of radiation, which can’t penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere 
to harm humans but can disrupt the layer through which GPS and communications 
signals travel. This one was classified as an M-class flare, 10 times weaker 
than the most intense type, known as X-class flares.

This is a ‘globular cluster’ – a ball of old stars orbiting their host galaxy. 
The cluster lies within our own Milky Way galaxy and new data from the Hubble
Space <https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> Telescope suggests it is 
about 12bn years old. All of its stars are the same age: stellar siblings that 
were all born at roughly the same time.

The European Space Agency released a timelapse video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2014/aug/26/northern-lights-filmed-from-space-timelapse-video>
 of the ISS flying through the aurora australis. In this still image, Achernar 
(just to the right of centre) is the brightest star in this southerly view. The 
orbital outpost was flying at an altitude of 420 kilometres above the Earth’s 
surface at 51.6 degrees south latitude and 110.3 degrees east longitude. Two 
solar array panels are partially visible.

In September 2016, Nasa will attempt to land a spacecraft on Mars that will 
probe the interior of the planet by listening for seismic signals – 
particularly following the violent impact of objects such as meteorites. Quite 
by chance, a potential landing site is already scarred by a fresh crater (blue).
InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat 
Transport) <http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/home.cfm> will be able to detect large 
impacts that are far from the lander and smaller impacts that are closer. This 
recent image taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbitershows a distinctive crater 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA18776> indicating a very 
recent impact between 2008 and 2012. During the InSight mission, fresh craters 
spotted by orbiting cameras will be matched to seismic signals.

Meanwhile, astronomers from Esa 
<http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Integral_catches_dead_star_exploding_in_a_blaze_of_glory>
 studying the same supernova said they’d found proof that it was caused by a 
white dwarf star reigniting and exploding. The space agency used itsIntegral 
<http://sci.esa.int/integral/> observatory to detect gamma rays from the 
radioactive elements created during the explosion.

This sequence of artist’s impressions shows some of the steps leading up to 
and following the explosion. A white dwarf, containing up to 1.4 times the mass 
of the sun squeezed into a volume about the size of the Earth, leeches matter 
from a companion star (image 1). A belt of gas from the companion star builds 
up around the equator of the white dwarf (image 2). This belt detonates (image 
3) and triggers the internal explosion that becomes the supernova (image 4). 
Material from the explosion expands (image 5) and eventually becomes 
transparent to gamma rays (image 6).

Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraftcrossed the planet’s orbit 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-287>. The piano-sized New

2.75bn miles (4.4bn kilometres) from Earth. The spacecraft is en route to 
Pluto, scheduled to arrive on 14 July 2015.

This image shows two dramatic star-formation regions in the southern Milky 
Way. The one on the left is dominated by the star cluster NGC 3603, located 
20,000 light-years away in the Carina–Sagittarius spiral arm of our galaxy. The 
other is a collection of glowing gas clouds known as NGC 3576 that lies only 
about half as far from Earth.The image <http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1425/>
 was captured by the Wide Field Imager at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile.

The VLT Survey Telescope at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile captured this 
stunning image <http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1424/> of the galaxy Messier 
33, often called the Triangulum Galaxy. The galaxy is a cosmic stone’s throw 
from our own, about three million light-years away in the small northern 
constellation of Triangulum (The Triangle). It was observed by the French comet 
hunter Charles Messier in August 1764, but was probably first documented by the 
Sicilian astronomerGiovanni Battista Hodierna 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Hodierna> around 100 years 
earlier.

Chasma Boreale is a canyon 560 kilometres long that cuts through the northern 
polar ice cap of Mars. The canyon’s sides reveal layers resulting from the 
seasonal melting and deposition of ice and dust, so the past climate of the red 
planet may one day be revealed in these stripes – just like tree ring patterns 
and ice cores on Earth.

The squid-like apparition is very faint but spans some 2.5 full moons toward 
the constellation Cepheus in the Earth’s night sky. It is a planetary nebula – 
the gaseous shroud of a dying, sun-like star.

This neat spiral galaxy, known as PGC 54493 
<http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-sees-spiral-in-serpens/#.VCk46kj6rRo>
, is located in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). It is part of a 
cluster that has been studied by astronomers exploring an intriguing phenomenon 
known as weak gravitational lensing. This is caused by the uneven distribution 
of matter – including invisible dark matter – throughout the universe, which 
distorts images of distant galaxies. Dark matter does not emit or absorb light 
or other forms of electromagnetic energy, but it accounts for some 27% of the 
total contents of the universe.

One day, we may get much of our electricity from orbiting solar arrays that 
beam energy wirelessly back to Earth via microwaves. The problem is folding up 
the arrays small enough to send into space, then unfurling them in orbit 
without jamming or snagging. Researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, 
Utah, are finding solutionsinspired by the ancient Japanese art of origami 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-277>. They’ve designed a 
solar array that is 2.7 metres in diameter when folded up, but a whopping 25 
metres across when unfolded. The one illustrated here is a 1/20th-scale 
prototype.
