Patrick Dangerfield rose to the occasion, brilliantly leading Geelong to a 
31-point AFL win over the ladder-leadingNorth Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/north-melbourne>. The star recruit produced 
one of the best games of his stellar career as the third-placed Cats broke away 
in the second half to beat the league leaders 15.15 (105) to 12.2 (74).

After two upset losses to Collingwood and Carlton, the Cats have returned to 
form emphatically with wins over GWS and now the Kangaroos. And they beat North 
without suspended key forward Tom Hawkins.

Dangerfield had a career-high 48 possessions and kicked two goals on Saturday 
night at Etihad Stadium. Fittingly, his second goal 13 minutes into the last 
term gave the Cats a 28-point lead and put the result beyond doubt.

It was the Danger-Joel double act for the Cats, with their captain Joel 
Selwood amassing 38 possessions. Their outstanding performances in the midfield 
showcased exactly why Geelong worked so hard to lure Dangerfield fromAdelaide

The Kangaroos have a massive match next Friday night against Hawthorn, and the

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/western-bulldogs>.

It was a bad night for North, with captain Andrew Swallow concussed in the 
second term and forced out of the game. Front-line midfielders Ben Cunnington 
and Nick Dal Santo were also clearly hampered by leg injuries in the first half.

The inaccuracy that has become a worrying feature of the Cats’ game in the 
past month was again a factor in the first half. They had kicked a wasteful 5.9 
to half time and trailed by 10 points.

Two goals in two minutes at the start of the third term immediately erased 
that deficit andGeelong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/geelong> were away. 
The Cats kicked 10 goals to four in the second half and, against one of the 
league’s best midfields, won the clearances 48-32.

Eddie Betts produced a trademark masterclass as Adelaide came from 26 points 
down to post a 29-point win over West Coast at Domain Stadium. The Eagles 
appeared to have the game in the bag after Elliot Yeo’s goal midway through the 
third quarter gave the home side a 74-48 lead but a five-goal haul to Betts 
inspired Adelaide to victory, with the Crows booting the last eight goals of 
the match to secure the 15.15 (105) to 11.10 (76) win.

The result improved Adelaide’s record to 8-4 heading into their bye week. West 
Coast’s (7-5) first home loss since round 19 last year saw them slip two wins 
adrift of fourth spot.

The Eagles won all six of their previous home games this season by an average 
of 68 points, but this match was the first time they’d hosted a bona fide 
finals outfit – and they came up well short. Betts was critical in the result, 
with the former Blue snaring some big marks and kicking some opportunistic 
goals to keep Adelaide within striking distance.

West Coast headed into the final quarter with a 12-point lead, but Adelaide 
slammed through six unanswered goals to seal the win and silence the 37,591 
home crowd.

Forward Jack Redpath kicked four goals as the Western Bulldogs pipped Port 
Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/port-adelaide> by three points on 
Saturday. The Dogs came from nine points down at three-quarter-time to triumph 
15.10 (100) to 14.13 (97) at Adelaide Oval, where Redpath’s team-mate Jake 
Stringer was instrumental in the revival, booting two of his three goals in a 
gripping final quarter.

The Bulldogs, now with nine wins and three losses this season, were well 
served by onballers Marcus Bontempelli (30 disposals), Tom Liberatore (24 
touches) and Mitch Wallis (27 disposals), while veteran Matthew Boyd (28 
possessions) was superb in defence.

Port, gallant but yet to beat a top-eight side this year, fell short despite 
the brilliance of Robbie Gray, who recorded a game-high 32 disposals, and 
influential backman Jasper Pittard (26 touches), while Chad Wingard, Aaron 
Young and Jake Neade kicked two goals each.

The Bulldogs opened strongly, kicking four of the initial five goals of the 
game in a free-flowing first term and held a 10-point lead at quarter-time but 
Port reduced the deficit to just two points at half-time after a bruising 
second quarter, which featured just three goals.

The Power sparked in the third stanza with five goals to three for a 
nine-point buffer at three-quarter-time but Stringer then inspired the visitors 
with two goals in five minutes as the Dogs hit the front. And that’s where they 
stayed, despite a late scare when Port’s Aaron Young kicked a goal with 17 
seconds left to reduce the margin to three points.

Fremantle recorded their second victory in succession and also of the season, 
smashing a woefulBrisbane Lions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/brisbane-lions> by 83 points at the Gabba. 
Young key forward Matt Taberner kicked five goals and Chris Mayne, Lachie 
Weller and Hayden Ballantyne contributed four each as the Dockers romped to a 
23.9 (147) to 9.10 (64) victory.

Both teams came into the match with one win to their names, but will leave 
with far different perspectives on the future. The Dockers will now look to put 
a horror first 10 games of the season behind them while the Lions might end up 
battling it out with Essendon for the wooden spoon.


In a week in which Justin Leppitsch suggested the worst period for his side 
may be over, his players put in a performance to potentially make him reassess 
this judgment. Plenty of Lions fans left the ground from early in the third 
quarter leaving far fewer than the 12,899 – the second-lowest Lions attendance 
– at the Gabba at the game’s conclusion.

For Ross Lyon’s side there were lots of positives and evidence that they may 
be able to transition into the more free flowing style of football played by 
most of the competition in 2016.


With the Dockers’ veteran spearhead Matthew Pavlich out with a groin injury, 
Taberner impressed throughout with his contested marking and kicking at goal in 
what may be looked back on as his breakout game.


Young midfielders Weller, probably the best on ground, and Connor Blakely, 
with a team-high 29 disposals, outplayed their Brisbane counterparts, in a 
match in which ball-magnet Lachie Neale was kept to 17 possessions by Mitch 
Robinson in one of the rare positional wins for the Lions.


The match began brightly for Brisbane who scored three goals in the first 
seven minutes, as the Fremantle defence allowed uncontested marks close to goal 
for Josh Schache and Daniel Rich.


The scores were level at quarter-time, but in the second quarter the Lions 
conceded nine goals in succession to effectively kill off the game. Although 
Brisbane scored the first two goals of the second half to reduce the deficit to 
35 points, the deluge continued soon afterwards and did not let up until the 
final siren.
