Guardian US special projects editor James Ball, who worked closely on the 
Guardian's coverage of the Snowden revelations, has won the XCity alumni award 
from City University for his achievements in data journalism.

The XCity Award was established in 2011 and is awarded to a graduate of City 
University London who has made an outstanding contribution to journalism in the 
past year.

City University head of journalism George Brock commented, "James is a worthy 
winner of this year's XCity Award. There could hardly be a more significant 
story to show how we prepare City students for the world of journalism."

Ball said: "Receiving this award is incredibly gratifying and I am extremely 
grateful to City, both for the award and for the skills I learnt as a student."
