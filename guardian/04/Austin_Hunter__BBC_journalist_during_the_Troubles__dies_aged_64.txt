A BBC television reporter who covered some of the worst atrocities of Northern 
Ireland’s Troubles before going on to head up the police’s communications 
office in the region has been killed in Bahrain.

Austin Hunter, who also worked as editor of the Ulster Newsletter, was knocked 
down while crossing the road in the Gulf state.

The 64-year-old was on business in Bahrain when the accident happened on 
Saturday night.

In a statement the Hunter family said on Sunday that this wife Jean, son Simon 
and daughter Rachael were “absolutely devastated at the loss of a loving 
husband, father and grandfather”.

The family added: “We are deeply touched by the warm tributes paid by so many 
and they have given us some comfort at this awful time. Right now, we want to 
focus on our family and despite media interest we would gratefully appreciate 
the space to grieve.”

Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, tweeted:

journalist and nice man”.
