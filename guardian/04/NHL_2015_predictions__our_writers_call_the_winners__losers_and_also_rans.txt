Biggest surprise team

Mike Coppinger: New Jersey Devils. They don’t have a top scorer, but an elite 
goaltender and up-and-coming defense corps should carry them in the fight for 
the No8 seed.

DJ Gallo: Philadelphia Flyers. Unlike most seasons, the Flyers have few 
expectations. But they still have some talent, and could slip into the playoffs 
if they avoid another bad start.

Colin Horgan: Living in Toronto, it’s tempting to believe that with the mega 
summer moves, the Maple Leafs will finally be contenders. So, I’ll say the 
Winnipeg Jets.

Amanda Stein: Washington Capitals. With the addition of TJ Oshie and Justin 
Williams to the core of Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom (and Braden Holtby 
between the pipes), this could be a group that turns heads afterlast year’s 
capitulation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/14/derek-stepan-the-hero-as-rangers-beat-capitals-in-game-7>
 against the New York Rangers.

Biggest disappointment

MC: Phil Kessel. Big things are expected for the former Maple Leaf, now 
playing with Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, but he won’t realize expectations of 
a career resurgence.

DJG: Capitals. Braden Holtby had a career year and Alex Ovechkin had his best 
all-around season in 2014-15. It’s unlikely both happen again.

CH: Mike Babcock <https://twitter.com/MapleLeafs/status/601090583759822848>.

AS: Red Wings. Detroit’s remarkable streak of 24 consecutive playoff 
appearances, a record for major league sports, will finally come to an end in a 
significant transition year.

One bold prediction

MC: The New York Rangers miss the playoffs. They will rely on an aging Henrik 
Lundqvist who has been injury prone of late and lack depth on offense.

DJG: Mike Babcock will be out by the end of the season as Leafs coach. Yes, he 
has a new, eight-year contract. But nothing would surprise in Toronto.

CH: The Calgary Flames will make the playoffs again.

AS: This will be the last season for Steven Stamkos in Tampa. Still no 
contract, the allure of free agency and those mega bucks becomes more alluring 
as you get closer to 1 July.

First coach to get fired

MC: Mike Yeo. The Minnesota Wild have the talent but always come up short. 
This season won’t be any different and his fifth season will mark his last in 
Minny.

DJG: Todd Richards, Blue Jackets. Columbus has big expectations after 
finishing strong last year and adding Brandon Saad. If they struggle early, 
Richards might be gone.

CH: (crosses fingers) Don Cherry? Probably Claude Julien.

AS: Claude Julien. Missed the playoffs last season, and new general manager 
Don Sweeney inherited him, even though he made the decision to keep him. Will 
he stay or go has been a broken record for Julien the last couple of years. If 
the Bruins start slow, I say Sweeney pulls the trigger.

Will there be an NHL team in Las Vegas within the next 10 years?

MC: Yes. There’s too much momentum – the season-ticket drive was a rousing 
success – and theNHL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl> seems intent on 
cashing in that massive expansion fee.

DJG: Yes. Putting a team in Vegas would be a marriage of Gary Bettman’s two 
great loves: placing teams in warm locations and making questionable decisions.

CH: Yes. They shall be called Las Nordiques.

AS: Absolutely. It feels as though the league has been moving towards it for 
years. The arena is there, and there is a keen interest in being the first 
major league sport to lay down roots in Nevada. Let’s make some money!

Gary Bettman is ... 

MC: ... once again in over his head if he believes the NHL needs two more 
teams before relocating existing struggling franchises. The Coyotes are in 
disarray and the Panthers can’t draw. Fix those clubs first.

DJG: ... better than Roger Goodell. In a shocking turn, over the past year, 
NHL fans have come to realize Bettman is somehow not the worst sports 
commissioner.

CH: ... still not getting it about concussions.

AS: Remarkable at tolerating the cacophony of boos every time he speaks in 
front of fans. He is doing the job asked of him: representing the interests of 
the owners, which isn’t always the popular ones. I like Gary Bettman.

Hart Trophy winner (most valuable player)

MC: Jamie Benn. The Dallas Stars forward snagged the Art Ross trophy one year 
ago and plays alongside one of the best forwards in the game in Tyler Seguin. 
Add in Patrick Sharp and Benn could even improve on his banner season.

DJG: Jonathan Toews. He has a Conn Smythe, but rarely gets serious Hart 
consideration. Making the playoffs with Chicago’s depleted roster could change 
that.

CH: Alex Ovechkin.

AS: Sidney Crosby. The Kid always seems to be in the running, and with Phil 
Kessel on his line this year he could earn himself a few more points than 
usual. In a league where scoring seems to have taken a slight hit, Crosby keeps 
on producing.

Norris Trophy winner (top defenseman)

MC: Erik Karlsson. The Swede is a good bet to pick up his second consecutive 
award for best defenseman. He’s one of the best scorers in the league, full 
stop, and is only improving at 25.

DJG: Kris Letang. Letang may have been the frontrunner last year before 
getting injured. If he can avoid concussion/mumps/this year’s Penguins mystery 
malady, the trophy is his.

CH: Mark Giordano.

AS: Drew Doughty. It will be about time for last year’s runner-up, not least 
because the Kings should be better. Doughty can and does do it all.

Vezina Trophy winner (top goaltender)

MC: Carey Price. Another repeat selection here. Price was the best goalie in 
2014-15 and there wasn’t a close second. There’s no reason to believe that kind 
of dominance will subside.

DJG: Henrik Lundqvist. The Ranger roster has had a bit of a makeover, but 
their star remains and will get a lot of (deserved) credit for keeping New York 
in contention.

CH: Carey Price.

AS: Carey Price. Montreal’s goaltender has given no reason to believe he’ll 
slow down after his out-of-this-world numbers last season. He simply has been 
in a league of his own since the Sochi Olympics. Even if his numbers dip, 
they’re still the best in the league.

Adams Trophy winner (top coach)

MC: Dan Bylsma. The Sabres should improve greatly under the former Pittsburgh 
coach’s watch and have an infusion of young talent do so, spearheaded by 
Evander Kane and No2 overall pick Jack Eichel.

DJG: Joel Quenneville. Quenneville has three Cups with Chicago, but hasn’t won 
coach of the year there. Lesser talent this year will get him a trophy, but not 
the one he wants.

CH: Todd McClellan if the Oilers turn it around. Lindy Ruff if Dallas goes 
deep.

AS: Barry Trotz. In year one Washington’s Trotz brought a level of consistency 
to the Capitals game we hadn’t seen in years. In year two Trotz has the 
pleasure of coaching one of the most complete Capitals lineups since 2010.

Calder Trophy winner (top rookie)

MC: Connor McDavid. The Oiler is a generational talent and will put up monster 
numbers for a bad team. Eichel will push him for the trophy, though.

DJG: Jack Eichel. Does this mean Eichel will be the better player than Connor 
McDavid long-term? Not at all. Remember that Ovechkin won the Calder over 
Crosby.

CH: It’s so obviously going to be McDavid or Eichel that it won’t be McDavid 
or Eichel. In other words: Sam Bennett.

AS: Connor McDavid. I feel like being a Canadian myself, and having heard 
about McDavid for the last 10 years I have no choice but to say Connor McDavid. 
He’s the next Sidney Crosby, right?

Atlantic Division champion

MC: Lightning. The defending Eastern Conference champions are one of the 
speediest teams in the league and will benefit greatly from the Cup experience.

DJG: Lightning. Tampa Bay return a young, stacked roster that nearly won the 
Cup. Winning the Atlantic shouldn’t be a problem.

CH: Wouldn’t it be great it if were Buffalo?

AS: Lightning. A balanced returning cast with more experience and a strong 
one-two punch between the pipes. A team once motivated by a first-round sweep 
will surely be spurred by a Cup loss.

Metropolitan Division champion

MC: Islanders. The upstarts now playing in Brooklyn are poised to overtake the 
rival Rangers. The Isles boast one of the best young forward groups in the game 
led by John Tavares. Only their questionable goaltending can stop them.

DJG: Penguins. Like Letang and the Norris, if the Penguins can avoid weird 
medical problems this year they’ll have Phil Kessel treating himself to 
celebratory hot dogs.

CH: Washington Capitals. They are no joke. TJ Oshie is a frightening addition. 
Though I’d like to see the Islanders pull it off, somehow.

AS: Capitals. Defense may be the biggest question mark with no real superstar, 
but they have a solid group in place with Holtby there to pick up the slack in 
net. Expect big things.

Central Division champion

MC: Predators. Pekka Rinne is one of the game’s elite and their young defense 
group will mature even more. Look for Roman Josi and Seth Jones to break out 
and bring home a tough division.

DJG: Blues. Picking St Louis to win the division is never all that bold. 
Picking them to win the Cup is entirely different.

CH: Predators. Remember the Nashville Predators?

AS: Predators. Toughest division in hockey. A Laviolette sophomore season, 
coupled with a talented cast of returning players and some new talent. Pekka 
Rinne has one of the better teams he’s had front of him, and managed to put up 
Vezina-worthy numbers with lesser talent.

Pacific Division champion

MC: Ducks. Simply one of the most well-rounded teams in the league from the 
net out, they roll four lines as well as any club.

DJG: Ducks. Echoing my pick of the Blues in the Central: Picking the Ducks to 
win the division is never all that bold. Picking them to win the Cup? Entirely 
different.

CH: Probably Anaheim, let’s be honest. But for fun: Calgary.

AS: Ducks. Anaheim appears to be the most talented team on paper (which of 
course guarantees nothing). Big, bad, strong and talented, and now with more 
depth! I get nervous for the Pacific division just reading through their roster.

Eastern Conference finals prediction

MC: Pittsburgh Penguins over Washington Capitals.

DJG: Tampa Bay Lightning over Pittsburgh Penguins.

CH: Tampa Bay Lightning over Washington Capitals.

AS: Washington Capitals over Tampa Bay Lightning.

Western Conference finals prediction

MC: Anaheim Ducks over Nashville Predators.

DJG: Anaheim Ducks over Nashville Predators.

CH: Anaheim Ducks <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anaheim-ducks> over 
Chicago Blackhawks.

AS: Anaheim Ducks over Nashville Predators.

Stanley Cup Finals prediction

MC: Anaheim. Under Bruce Boudreau, they’ve been knocking at the door for years 
and will finally come through this season. Their forward group features great 
two-way players (Ryan Getzalf, Ryan Kesler), strong goaltending (Frederick 
Andersen) and a top D pairing (Cam Fowler, Sami Vatanen).

DJG: Tampa Bay. If you’re looking for the next Blackhawks-esque ‘dynasty’ 
contender, look to the Lightning. Even after pushing Chicago to six games in 
the Final last year, they have the third-youngest roster in the NHL. Hopefully 
the people of Tampa appreciate what they have.

CH: Anaheim. The McSorley curse endures. Canadians grumble about no real 
hockey cities in the Final. Canadians grumble about undeservedly cheap playoff 
tickets in SoCal. Viewership north of the border plummets. A southern expansion 
team beats a southern expansion team. Gary Bettman smiles.

AS: Anaheim. They were very close last season and tick just about every box 
for a contender. Big strong offence, check. Mobile, young (but not too young) 
defense, check. A capable goalie in Frederik Andersen, check. Off-season 
tinkering additions with Chris Stewart and Carl Hagelin, check. This team looks 
poised for the franchise’s second Stanley Cup.
