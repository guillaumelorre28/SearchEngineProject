Duran Duran, Phil Collins and the Human League helped Absolute Radio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/absolute-radio> top 4 million listeners 
across its seven-strong network for the first time, powered by a strong 
performance by nostalgia station Absolute 80s.

The five-year-old station is now the most popular commercial digital-only 
radio service in the UK, with 1.43 million listeners each week on average 
between 23 June and 14 September, a year on year increase of 18%, according to 
the latest official Rajar figures published on Thursday.

Absolute 80s appears on course to eclipse the main Absolute Radio station, 
which broadcasts on FM in London and AM nationwide, as well as digital, which 
has been in long-term decline and now has a total of 1.87 million listeners.

The station’s most played tracks over the last 30 days, according to 
comparemyradio.com <http://comparemyradio.com>, included Billy Ocean’s When The 
Going Gets Tough The Tough Get Going, Live It Up by Mental As Anything and 
Calling All the Heroes by It Bites.

Absolute Radio was bought by Kiss and Magic owner Bauer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bauer> Media last year after its ill-fated 
ownership by the Times of India Group.

It now spans seven stations, including services dedicated to each of the last 
five decades, with a total weekly reach of just over 4 million, up 18% on the 
same period in 2013.

Absolute 80s is the most successful, with Absolute Radio 70s managing a weekly 
reach of just 167,000 listeners, and Absolute Radio 60s not much further ahead 
with 208,000.

Absolute Radio 90s is its second best performer, with 665,000 listeners a 
week. Its (almost) contemporary spin-off, Absolute Radio 00s, had 165,000 
listeners.

Absolute’s breakfast host Christian O’Connell now appears on all seven of the 
broadcaster’s stations, with different music played in between as part of an 
initiative dubbed “Project Banana” launched earlier this year.

Absolute 80s breakfast show had 462,000 listeners, almost as many as the main 
Absolute station had in the competitive London market (580,000).

Capital stays ahead


In the battle for London listeners Global Radio’s Capital held on to the 
number one spot among commercial stations, but only just. Capital had an 
average weekly audience of just under 2 million despite losing nearly 8% of its 
audience year on year.

Capital was ahead of Bauer’s Magic, breathing down its neck on 1.96 million, 
and Magic’s sister station Kiss, with 1.8 million.

Global’s Heart is some way further back on 1.45 million, down nearly 17% year 
on year.

Global Radio’s LBC, the former London talk station that has gone nationwide 
and is home to phone-in shows with Nick Clegg, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and 
Harriet Harman, had 1.28 million listeners, marginally up on the previous 
quarter but down 3.8% year on year.

Among the other national commercial networks, Global’s Classic FM had 5.2 
million listeners, down 2.3% year on year, and UTV’s TalkSport 3.1 million, up 
5.3% on the same period in 2013.

Digital’s total share of radio listening grew to 37.8%, with the lion’s share 
(24.5%) via digital audio broadcasting (DAB) radio.
