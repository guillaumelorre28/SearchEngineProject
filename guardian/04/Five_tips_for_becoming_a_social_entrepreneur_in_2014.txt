What's great about this generation is the strong belief that business can and 
should be done differently. We've lived through decades of business models that 
were profitable, but too often at the expense of quality or compassion. What 
folks such as Blake Mycoskie, founder ofTOMS shoes <http://www.toms.co.uk/>, 
and the late Paul Newman, founder ofNewman's Own 
<http://newmansownfoundation.org/>, have proven is that businesses can meet 
financial goals as well as have a positive, social impact.

But how to know if your idea for a social venture is a good one, or if you are 
the right person to make it happen? Sometimes that realisation comes 
unexpectedly. My turning point took place in a meeting between a large global 
corporation and a social media executive. They were discussing ways to 
capitalise on the loopholes that helped them avoid paying taxes and pour 
profits into another business venture. I knew then that I could no longer 
devote my time and energy to furthering their cause. I was determined to 
develop a business model that could generate profits but also make a difference 
in the world. That was the start ofDoGoodBuyUs <http://www.dogoodbuy.us/>.

If you have an idea or philosophy about creating a for-profit business where 
you can do well and do good, here are five important tips to get you headed in 
the right direction:

1) Three approaches to building a platform
Unlike a traditional business that is structured solely for profit, social 
entrepreneurs can choose one of these three methods for integrating giving back 
into their business: a) donate a percentage of company profits b) affiliate 
with a cause, community, and/or charity and develop a product or service that 
will raise money and c) fundraise and share in the upside.

2) Understand the role of benefit corporations and business incubators
In the past few years, numerous organisations have developed to help make 
social entrepreneurship more accessible and successful. They can be a source of 
financial support as well as provide mentorship and guidance. Incubators such as
The Unreasonable Institute <http://unreasonableinstitute.org/>, Civic Ventures 
<http://www.civicventures.org/nextchapter/overview.cfm>, Conscious Labs 
<http://www.consciouslab.org/> and hundreds of others are springing up. 
Investigate and make yourself known.

3) Dream big, but start small
Every entrepreneur (social or not) hopes to see their idea prosper into a 
successful venture, but patience is a virtue. A new business needs time and 
space to evolve and grow. The key is to start by building a solid foundation 
through developing smaller, more manageable partnerships and then learn what 
works or doesn't. In other words, partner with organisations that match your 
scale. Nobody is too small at the start.

4) Don't lose sight of your mission
If I make a business decision strictly for the profit potential, it often 
fails. If I take the mission and our passion into consideration, I stay on the 
path and attract the right programmes, partners and the publications.

5) Don't be deterred by constant change
It is rare to find your unique selling proposition right away. It takes time 
for your business ideas and goals to evolve and for things to fall into place. 
For the two and a half years since we have been in business, we have tried 
seven different business models until we found the right direction. Clarity 
takes time but it's worth the wait.

It's a new year and a great time to pursue your dream of being a social 
entrepreneur.
