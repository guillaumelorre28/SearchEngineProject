Senior bureaucrats have rejected claims the attorney general’s department 
(AGD) was “ducking for cover” after it discovered it had mishandled a letter 
from theSydney siege <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney-siege> 
gunman, but conceded the series of mistakes was astounding.


The secretary of the department, Chris Moraitis, came under pressure at a 
Senate hearing on Monday about a delay in correcting the parliamentary record 
about a letter Man Haron Monis sent to the attorney general,George Brandis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-brandis>, two months before 
the deadly December siege.


On 27 May the AGD’s deputy secretary, Katherine Jones, said the letter – 
asking whether it was legal to contact the Islamic State leader – had been 
provided to the review of the siege’s handling. The claim was repeated by 
Brandis and the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who pointed to the lack 
of any adverse findings in the review report todefend the government’s handling

Internal emails show Tony Abbott’s office was made aware 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/06/abbott-may-have-known-about-monis-letter-three-days-before-record-corrected>
 on Monday 1 June that the AGD had failed to send the letter to the joint 
federal and New South Wales government review into the siege – but parliament 
was nottold about the error in the department’s previous testimony to a Senate 
inquiry until Thursday 4 June

.

The deputy secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 
Allan McKinnon, wrote to the prime minister’s office at 11.50am on 1 June that 
the AGD was “ducking for cover” over the issue.


An attached briefing note stated definitively that “AGD never provided the 
Monis/Brandis letter to the Martin Place review team”, but noted that an AGD 
officer was aware of this fact as far back as 2 February.

Moraitis told Monday’s hearing in Canberra that he was surprised to learn on 1 
June of the junior officer’s earlier discussions with the review team about the 
unsent Monis correspondence. A member of the review team replied that the 
report had already been completed, so it was too late to send the 
correspondence.

The AGD secretary said he had chosen not to correct the record on 1 June and 
instead requested an internal review of all the facts because he was concerned 
there could be further mistakes.

“I had real concerns about correcting the record accurately,” Moraitis told 
the Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs references committee, which is 
conducting an inquiry into the handling of the Monis letter.

“I was presented with a series of revelations, let us say, which pretty much 
left me astounded to be honest. The one thing I wanted was to ensure that any 
correction that was done was accurate … to ensure we made no more mistakes.

“That was another concern I had – that there’s this series of administrative 
errors, oversights, people not communicating up the line, checking material 
that frankly you couldn’t make up, and then making sure that if and when we do 
correct it was corrected properly and please, no more mistakes. That was the 
mindset in which I was approaching this.”


Moraitis said he was “mortified about what has happened” and rejected the 
“ducking for cover” description.

“It wasn’t my impression of what was going on in the department, to be honest 
with you,” he said.

Were we running around like headless chooks? Perhaps, But ducking for cover is 
not the language I would have used
Chris Moraitis 
“Were we running around looking for answers? Yes. Were we running around like 
headless chooks, if you might use that phrase, colloquialism? Perhaps. But 
ducking for cover is not the language I would have used.”

Labor has been highly critical of the government for waiting until the final 
day of a parliamentary sitting fortnight to retract the previous claims, saying 
it was to avoid scrutiny.

Labor senator Joe Ludwig said the AGD should have promptly retracted the false 
claim and indicated it was still investigating the facts.


Ludwig said the AGD opened itself up for criticism by waiting for the internal 
review to be completed before issuing any public correction.


“Ultimately then any subsequent correction of the record looks untidy, it 
looks delayed, and in this instance it looked like a cover-up,” he said.


Moraitis said he did not realise that he “could half-correct the record”.


Jones said she took “ultimate responsibility” for her original claim about the 
Monis letter and the timing of the correction. But she said she needed to know 
whether the Monis letter had been provided to the review team from another 
source.


“I didn’t say in my evidence AGD provided the letter; I said the letter had 
been provided to the review, so it was a slightly broader statement that needed 
to be corrected,” Jones said.


The Australian federal police (AFP) told the Senate inquiry they had not been 
made aware of the Monis correspondence before the siege occurred.


“Our understanding is the particular letter that is the focus of this inquiry 
was seized by the NSW police either on the days of the siege [15-16 December 
2014] or shortly thereafter,” said Neil Gaughan, the AFP’s acting deputy 
commissioner.


“The AFP was not in receipt of the correspondence and wasn’t aware of its 
existence until 28 January [2015].”


NSW police notified the federal police of the existence of the correspondence 
on 28 January, which prompted the federal police to email the AGD the same day 
seeking copies of all such letters.


Abbott’s office has previously defended the government’s handling of the 
issue, saying a “thorough review” was launched “as soon as it became clear that 
there was a possible problem with the testimony”.
