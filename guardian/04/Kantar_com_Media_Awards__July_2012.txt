The Guardian and The Observer have been named Britain's most trusted 
newspapers at the Kantar.com MediaAwards 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards-2012>.

The winners were based on a Kantar.com <http://kantar.com/> survey of 1,000 
people on their favourite outlets, news consumption, predictions for the future 
and the effects of the Leveson Inquiry.

The survey also revealed that over 80% of 18- to 34-year-olds think they will 
be buying newspapers in five years' time.
