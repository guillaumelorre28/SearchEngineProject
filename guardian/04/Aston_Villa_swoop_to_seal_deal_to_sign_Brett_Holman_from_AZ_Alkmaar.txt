The Australia midfielder Brett Holman has agreed to join Aston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> at the end of his contract 
with AZ Alkmaar this summer. The 27-year-old winger, who joined the Eredivisie 
leaders in 2008, will head to England after a decade in Holland, having 
initially signed for Feyenoord. Spells with Excelsior and NEC Nijmegen followed 
before he joined AZ, with whom he won the title in his first season.

He is ready to head to the Premier League, though, and said: "I am delighted 
to have agreed terms with Aston Villa and I am looking forward to joining up 
with the team in the summer. Villa have a long and prestigious history in 
English football and a fantastic set of fans." Holman has won 53 caps for 
Australia and was named by the country's football writers as player of the year 
for 2011.

"Brett is a very intelligent player, a great team player and a man who is 
recognised in the game as a non-stop, committed wide midfielder player," the 
Villa manager Alex McLeish said. "He has international experience and has 
played in the Champions League. He will add significantly to the experience in 
the Villa squad."
