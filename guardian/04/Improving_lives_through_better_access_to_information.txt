Increasing poor and marginalised people's capacity to access information helps 
to improve governance, democracy and people's ability to earn a living. It can 
empower many isolated communities who are often excluded from knowing about and 
influencing decisions that affect their daily lives, and helps them demand for 
more from their governments. It can also help people in developing countries to 
make their governments more accountable, and to prevent them from misusing 
their power.

For example, having access to timely information about market prices via the 
internet or through their mobile phones can help fishermen bargain for the best 
price for their daily catch; and poor citizens can find out what their 
financial and other entitlements are and how to access these from their 
governments. Panos London has seen how supporting some of the world's poorest 
people living in developing countries to access information helps to reduce 
poverty, improve democratic rights, and tackle exclusion.
