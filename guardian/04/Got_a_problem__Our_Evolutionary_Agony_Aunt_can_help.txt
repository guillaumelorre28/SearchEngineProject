"I love fools' experiments. I am always making them."

Charles Darwin <https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin> had a 
wonderful way with words and as a nod to the great man's now infamous comment, 
we thought we'd try our hand at what you might call our very own fools' 
experiment.

We want to help you with your problems. They don't need to be huge ones and 
they don't need to involve your love life, though it's fine if they are and 
they do.

There's a catch, though. Our Agony Aunt is only allowed to dispense advice 
based on current evolutionary thinking. The rest we'll leave to the glossy 
magazines.

over your problems so you don't have to.
