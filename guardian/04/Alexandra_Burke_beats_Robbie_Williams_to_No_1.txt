X Factor winner Alexandra Burke has scored her second No 1 as a solo artist 
with the UK's fastest-selling single of the year so far, Bad Boys. The 
21-year-old beatRobbie Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/robbie-williams>, currently at No 2 with his 
comeback single Bodies, by selling 185,000 copies in one week. According to the 
Official Charts Company, that figure is more than half as much as this year's 
previous fastest-selling single, Dizzee Rascal's Bonkers.

Burke's feat is all the more extraordinary because the singer's version of 
Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah became the fastest-selling single by a female artist 
in the UK when it was released as her debut last year. The song went on to 
become the biggest-selling single of 2008 in the UK and Ireland, eventually 
going twice platinum.

The singer also contributed to a cover version of Mariah Carey's Hero with X 
factor finalists in aid of The Royal British Legion, which went to No 1 in the 
UK singles chart in 2008.

London-born Burke shot to fame last year when she won the fifth series of 
ITV's hugely popular talent contestThe X Factor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-factor>. In February 2009, just 
two months after winning the show, Burke signed a Â£3m, five-album record deal 
with American record label Epic. A series of big-name producers and 
songwriters, including Pharell Williams and Akon, were enlisted to write the 
singer's debut album, Overcome, which is released today.
