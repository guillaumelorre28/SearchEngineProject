Job: founder and chairman, Brunswick Group
Age: 56
Industry: public relations
2011 ranking: 65

Alan Parker's Brunswick is the City's biggest PR group. Dubbed the godfather 
of modern financial public relations, Parker is close to both Labour and the 
Conservatives â€“ David Cameron was a guest at his wedding in 2007.

A one-time oil rig worker and rock band manager, Parker founded Brunswick in 
1987. Unlike his longstanding rival, Finsbury co-founder Roland Rudd, Parker 
eschews the limelight.

A 50% stakeholder in Brunswick, Parker handed 40% of the company's equity to 
its 90 partners in an overhaul of its management structure.

He also took on an "increasingly external and client facing role" after the 
company's US managing partner, Susan Gilchrist, wasnamed as its new chief 
executive
