The winner

In recognition of the increasing value of live events to the cinema sector, 
data gatherer Rentrak started including this alternative content in its UK box 
office reports last November. Now, for the first time, a live event has topped 
the UK box office chart. Despite playing just one performance on Sunday,Billy 
Elliot the Musical Live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/30/billy-elliot-reunion-london> 
took more money (£1.90m) than any other film over the Friday-to-Sunday period. 
Denzel Washington action thriller The Equalizer, playing a typical 12 times in 
each venue over the weekend period, was edged into second place.


Repeat screenings – encores, in the industry parlance – should soon see the 
Billy Elliot musical push past the £2m mark, although it has a long way to go 
to catch the market leader in this sector, the National Theatre’s production of 
War Horse (£2.7m in UK cinemas).

While unseasonably warm late-September weather at the weekend will have 
affected box office negatively across the market, Billy Elliot seems to have 
proved the exception. Most audience members will have pre-booked their tickets, 
and this was their one chance to see a show that returned Liam Mower (an 
original Billy) to the stage as the older Billy, and presented 26 of the actors 
who had played the title role over the years in a mash-up finale. The fact that 
Billy Elliot the Musical Live began at 2pm, meaning that cinemas could still 
programme films in their regular evening slots, represented a big win for them.

The runner-up

Having convincingly led the market on Friday and Saturday, Sony will be 
disappointed that The Equalizer was pipped at the post by Billy Elliot’s 
stunning Sunday gross. The £1.89m debut compares with a £1.42m opening for 
Washington’s previous film,2 Guns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/15/2-guns-review>. It’s the biggest 
opening for Washington sinceSafe House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/23/safe-house-review>, co-starring 
Ryan Reynolds, began its run in February 2012 with £2.14m.

The plucky Brit flick

Since its debut in 2007, TV sitcom Outnumbered has proved a consistent ratings 
winner for the BBC. For that reason, there was a large potential audience for
What We Did on Our Holiday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/what-we-did-on-our-holiday-review-david-tennant-rosamund-pike>
, which was written and directed by the show’s creators Andy Hamilton and Guy 
Jenkin, and uses the same improvisational techniques and also features two 
London parents and their three young children. On the other hand, the film does 
not carry a hit TV show’s brand – unlike, say, BBC Films’ Mrs Brown’s Boys 
D’Movie – and the cast is different.

 From the creators of Outnumbered … What We Did On Our Holiday 
Distributor Lionsgate will be reasonably satisfied with the result, especially 
considering the sunshine and the competition from Billy Elliot. What We Did on 
Our Holiday kicked off with £811,000 from 448 cinemas, yielding a £1,810 
average. That compares with a £4.30m debut for Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie back in 
June, although the comparison is hardly apt.


There’s a strong showing overall for British product in the current UK top 10, 
withPride <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pride> and The Riot Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-riot-club> both present, and of course 
Billy Elliot the Musical Live occupying the top spot. Rowan Joffe’sBefore I Go 
to Sleep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/04/before-i-go-to-sleep-review-nicole-kidman-colin-firth>
 is at number 11.

Admissions report

Admissions figures – number of actual tickets sold, rather than revenue – are 
in for August, and they show the highest monthly tally (17.07m) for the year so 
far, boosted by the likes ofGuardians of the Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes>
 andThe Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/06/inbetweeners-2-review-film>. 
However, this isn’t necessarily a cause for celebration, because August is 
traditionally a strong month for cinemagoing, and this year’s figure represents 
a dip from August 2013 (17.64m). Likewise, January, March, May, June and July 
were all down from 2013. Overall, 2014’s figures are 7% down on last year’s.

The arthouse sector

While independent cinemas have a profusion of crossover titles to choose from 
– Pride, The Riot Club, A Most Wanted Man, Magic in the Moonlight – there are 
leaner pickings among films in limited play. David Cronenberg’sMaps to the Stars
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/maps-to-the-stars> went out on a restrained 
67 screens, achieving a reasonably healthy average of £1,956. Its opening 
number of £131,000 is a modest improvement on Cronenberg’s last film, 
Cosmopolis, which began with £117,000 from 62 venues.

 A nun’s tale … Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida 
The top foreign-language film, outside the Bollywood sector, is Paweł 
Pawlikowski’sIda <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ida>, which delivered a 
healthy £52,600 from 16 cinemas, including previews of £5,600, yielding an 
average of £3,288. Ida won best film in the official competition at last 
October’s London film festival, and Curzon Artificial Eye waited nearly a year 
to release it. September can be a good time to unleash an arthouse title since 
many films that appeared earlier at Sundance, Berlin and Cannes are playing in 
the London festival and need to release after it – creating a potential vacuum 
in the release calendar.Five-star reviews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ida-pawel-pawlikowski-nun-road-movie>
 in the Guardian, Time Out and elsewhere will have helped snag audience 
interest.

The flop

Released on 51 screens, sci-fi flick I Origins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/28/i-origins-review-soul-searching-sci-fi>
 proved a distribution challenge for Fox. Despite having premiered in January 
at the Sundance film festival and boasting a cast including indie actor Michael 
Pitt, the title seemed to lack proper arthouse credentials. But neither did it 
seem likely to appeal to the mainstream genre fan. With a critics’ Metascore of 
57/100 and a marketing spend that may be politely termed fiscally responsible, 
it was always hard to imagine this one working. An opening gross of £15,000 
resulted.

The future

Although the weekend market overall landed among the dozen lowest-grossing for 
the past year, takings are nevertheless 22% up on the previous frame, and 17% 
up on the equivalent from 2013, when Prisoners (starring Hugh Jackman and Jake 
Gyllenhaal) led a lacklustre session. Salvation for cinema owners is surely at 
hand, with the arrival on Friday of David Fincher’sGone Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl>, adapted from the Gillian Flynn 
bestseller.

cinemagoing in the UK, so exhibitors will be hoping to see some steep rises on 
last year’s figures. Also in the mix areDracula Untold

family title Dolphin Tale 2. Spandau Ballet documentarySoul Boys of the Western

special event this evening, presented with a performance by the band beamed 
live from London’s Royal Albert Hall.
