Draghi comments lift markets

European markets have closed sharply higher following ECB president Mario 
Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> suggested the 
central bank was ready to act in June to tackle the lowly inflation rate,writes 
Nick Fletcher. With some positive company updates and signs of the tensions 
easing in Ukraine, investors were in fairly upbeat mood. The Pan-European 
FTSEEurofirst 300 closed more than 1% ahead, close to a six year high. 
Elsewhere the closing scores showed:


• The FTSE 100 finished 42.81 points or 0.63% higher at 6839.25

• Germany's Dax rose 0.9% to 9607.40

• France's Cac closed 1.37% to 4507.24

• Italy's FTSE MIB jumped 2.3% to 21,729.64

• Spain's Ibex ended 1.7% higher at 10,591.2

On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 94 points or 
0.57%.

Draghi's comments certainly succeeded in taking the froth out of the euro. 
Having climbed to a two and a half year high of $1.3992 against the dollar, it 
is now at $1.3864 as investors bet that Draghi would back up his words by 
either cutting rates or unveiling some other stimulus measures in June.

On that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow.

3.57pm BST 

 Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons it's impossible for the European 
Central Bank to do NOTHING next month, after today's comments from Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-slashes-7000-investment-banking-jobs-ecb-live#block-536b8c96e4b0987a2069eeb4>
.


Ostwald says:

It has to be observed that Draghi & Co's continued ability to tease markets 
with the promise of further policy easing measures, but not actually 
delivering, is impressive, but looks to have run its course. One might even 
suggest that there as an ostensible drift back to the old days of Trichet style 
communication today with the phrase "the governing council is comfortable with 
acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come 
out in early June", which looks like "strong vigilance" and "we are never 
pre-committed", though the contingency on the staff forecasts is rather more 
heavily emphasized in this instance.

On the other hand, it is now nigh on impossible for the ECB not to act in 
June, having stated that "there is consensus about being dissatisfied with the 
projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to 
expecting this ... We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff 
projections in early June." The slip in the euro versus the dollar certainly 
reflects this.

So, the markets could expect to see 10-15 bps cut in the ECB's headline 
refinancing rate (to 0.1%-0.15%), and in the deposit rate it pays on banks 
deposits (to between -0.1% and -0.15%). The marginal lending rate, charged when 
banks borrow from the ECB, could fall by 25 basis points to 0.5%.

3.50pm BST 

Danae Kyriakopoulou of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says:


So far, the ECB has been very generous with dovish promises to do “whatever it 
takes” and take action when needed. All eyes will be on the updated economic 
outlook and decision next month to see whether these will eventually be 
translated into action.

What did we learn from today's ECB press conference?

• There's no-one quite like Mario Draghi for getting a market reaction without 
actuallydoing anything. 

The European Central Bank chief is in a class of his own for casually 
producing a rabbit from his hat -today's surprise was that the ECB is 
"comfortable" about taking action next month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-slashes-7000-investment-banking-jobs-ecb-live#block-536b7d47e4b01757cacd2ed3>
, having left rates unchanged today.

As Draghi put it:

I would say that the governing council is comfortable with acting next time 
but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early 
June...

There is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of 
inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this 
... We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in 
early June.


That was enough to wipe 1.5 cents off the euro - from the brink of $1.40 to 
just $1.385 at pixel time, on anticipation of an interest rate cut in June.

• The Ukraine crisis is a big worry for central bankers. Draghi was clear -- 
the euro's strength is, in part, due to money flowing into the euro area 
because of fears over the Russian economy.

Geopolitical risks would have more impact on the euro area than on other parts 
of the world. This includes the situation in Ukraine and the economic situation 
in Russia.

• Europe remains fragile. The recent rally in peripheral bonds may show that 
the risk of default has receded, but it does not mean the recovery is secure.

Draghi said:

The recovery is proceeding but it is proceeding at a slow pace, and it still 
remains fairly modest, and there are some downward risks now. The risks have to 
do with the possible weakening of global demand, have to do with geopolitical 
risks that are of serious significance, and have to do with the exchange rate.

• Draghi understands why people are sceptical about Europe, but he doesn't 
support them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-slashes-7000-investment-banking-jobs-ecb-live#block-536b8129e4b0ece0827b0ce7>
.

He said he welcomed the debate, but insisted that Europe shouldn't 
"renationalise" its economies -- the answer is to move forwards with closer 
integration, not backwards.Will the voters agree at this month's elections?

• The ECB has had quite enough of being told what to do.

As Draghi put it:

"Over the last few day we received plenty of advice from political figures, 
from institutions on almost everything ... so we are certainly thankful for 
this advice... but you know by the treaty we are independent so people should 
be aware that if this might be seen as a threat to our independence it could 
cause long-term damage to our credibility."

"Certainly thankful", indeed. Reminded me of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho 
congratulating the referee on a "fantastic" performance after a recent defeat.

The press conference ended with Draghi repeating that Europe must push 
forwards, not go back.

"Our crisis would not have been so severe if we had more integration, not less 
integration", Draghi insists. The future does not lie with "the 
renationalisation of our economies".

And that was the end of the press conference - seven minutes early!

What did Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup (euro area finance 
ministers) tell the ECB at the meeting?

Draghi says that Dijsselbloem gave a presentation on the euro area that was 
rich and detailed, and "to some extent positive".

Countries who have been in economic reform programmes have either left them (
Ireland, soon to be followed by Portugal) or have made progress in them.

It is encouraging that, after efforts that were so painful, for so long, are 
now producing some positive outcomes, Draghi adds.

Juergen Baertz of Associated Press seeks more information about the ECB's 
fears over the Ukraine crisis - what effect is it having on the euro?

Draghi says that it's a big issue for politicians, central bankers and policy 
makers - many national central banks who are most exposed to Ukraine and Russia 
have their own working groups on potential consequences.

And the ECB chief agrees that the Ukraine crisis has been pushing the euro up.

Draghi reminds the press pack of the mistake that led to the eurozone debt 
crisis -- the original fiscal rules were broken by Germany, France, Italy, 
which weakened those rules.

Other countries then ran up debt levels that were unsustainable once market 
lost confidence in the euro area.

Mario Draghi suggests that some Russian money could flow into the Cyprus

renewed confidence in the island.

2.12pm BST 

The next question is on the rise of euroscepticism in Europe, ahead of the 
European elections later this month:

Draghi replies that the debate taking place at this time is welcome - it's 
important that we he have a discussion about the benefits and costs about 
living in a monetary union.

After all, this is a democracy, he adds.

We, at least I, would not want to go back to the crisis of the 70, the 80s, or 
even the early 90s.


And some of the causes of the crisis are because we didn't have enough 
integration in the past -- the answer is to move forwards, not back.

But Draghi also acknowledges the anger and disappointment in parts of the euro 
area - saying that it's not good enough if people aren't benefitting from 
growth and jobs.

Next question - how worried is the ECB that the Ukraine crisis will send the 
euro higher.

Draghi says that if geopolitical tensions deepen, the eurozone will be more 
badly hit than the rest of the world, due to close ties with Russia.

The press pack demand more details - what is the ECB governing council 
comfortable with doing in June, exactly?

Draghi replies that there is a consensus on the governing council with being 
dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation.

And there is there is a consensus that they council should not be resigned to 
a prolonged period of low inflation, and simply accepting it as " fact of 
nature".

1.55pm BST 

Draghi: the ECB governing council is comfortable with acting next time

Is the ECB gearing up for action in June, asks Brian Blackstone of the WSJ.

Draghi gives a lengthy answer, saying that he'd describe today's discussion as 
"a preview" of the discussion we are going to have next time.

While the recovery is firming up, the governing council is not resigned to 
inflation remaining at such low levels, he says.

Draghi also reiterates that the geopolitical risks facing the eurozone are 
influencing the exchange rate.

Recent weak inflation has been down to food and energy prices - the ECB needs 
to decide what else is pushing inflation down. The euro's strength is one 
factor - another is weak domestic demand, and unemployment levels.

And then he drops the bombshell:

The governing council is comfortable with acting next time, but it wants to 
see the new economic forecasts drawn up by the ECB staff first [they arrive in 
early June].

And the euro is tumbling back down.....

1.49pm BST 

Next question - is the ECB worried about exchange rates, and the strength of 
the euro?

Draghi says that the ECB doesn't have a target for the euro, but obviously 
it's a very important issue.

A high exchange rate, and low inflation, is a cause for serious concern.

1.47pm BST 

What does Draghi think about politicians offering advice about what the ECB 
should do?

Draghi reiterates that ECB is independent, and its credibility could be hurt 
if people lose faith in it. He said the Bank was "thankful" for recent advice - 
with a touch of sarcasm.

Updated at 3.21pm BST

1.46pm BST 

Claire Jones of the Financial Times goes first -- asking when a "prolonged 
period of inflation" becomes a "too prolonged period of inflation".


Draghi explains that the key issue is whether medium-terms inflation 
expectations have become "de-anchored" (rather than people having faith that 
inflation will rise back to target).

Credit conditions have stabilising in recent months, says Mario Draghi -- 
easing a little for households, but unchanged for firms.

Small businesses in some eurozone countries have reported that credit 
availability has improved recently, but banks are still reporting that 
conditions are tight in a historical basis.

So, limited progress here.

It's essential that the "fragmentation" in the eurozone banking sector is 
reduced, Draghi insists, to avoid hampering the recovery.

1.25pm BST 

With eurozone monetary policy unchanged, the financial markets are - once 
again - looking to Mario Draghi for guidance on the ECB's thinking when the 
press conference starts in five minutes....

But can Draghi simply jawbone the markets again, without actually doing 
anything?

Nancy Curtin, CIO at Close Brothers Asset Management says investors are 
starting to look for action.


Without a shadow of a doubt Europe’s fragile economic recovery is gaining 
ground. Numbers are improving week in week out and we’re seeing signs of 
improved competitiveness in the periphery. But let’s not forget there are still 
deep rooted underlying problems. Inflation remains disturbingly low and there 
are mumblings that economic recovery could falter if euro strength is 
sustained. What’s more, the general state of the emerging markets has meant a 
slowdown in these economies has kept a lid on global trade and continued to put 
downward pressure on tradable goods prices. Ukraine remains a lurking concern. 
If these issues become worse, Draghi may find himself with little choice but to 
step in and to bring Europe back to health. Further rate reductions may be the 
first step but the most likely remedy would be buying of assets through 
quantitative easing-European style.

So far Draghi has done a sound job of talking the talk, and often talking is 
almost as good as doing it. But investors are starting to look for actual 
movement - ‘Will he, won’t he’ has kept many on their toes for several months 
already. In part because Europe is seen to be recovering in spite of these 
underlying issues. So far, Draghi hasn’t needed to make a move. However, his 
positioning in Europe creates an air of uncertainty, adding to the clouds of 
unease already hovering over many part of the globe. Murky markets in the UK, 
US and Asia have meant many investors are fairly muted in their risk. By the 
end of the year we expect the clouds to have cleared for Europe, and quite 
possibly the UK too, but until then all eyes will be on Draghi’s next move, 
followed by the China, and then the BOJ. Waiting for policy makers is the new 
investment normal in a post financial crisis world.

Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank has an alternative view -- he thinks Britain's 
record low borrowing costs are" increasingly unnecessary and difficult to 
justify".

He explains:

One reason to keep rates on hold for longer would be if wage growth does not 
pick-up through this year. But wages are already improving, particularly 
outside the finance and business services sectors.

Berenberg expect the first quarter-point rate rise in the first three months 
of 2015, with a 35% chance that it comes between October and December this year.

And hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee could call for rate rises this 
summer, he added:

We look for at least one of the rate setters to break ranks and vote for a 
hike after the August Inflation Report.

David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), wants 
theBank of England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> 
to strengthen its forward guidance, to calm calls for a rate rise everytime 
some decent economic data is announced:


Businesses need clarity that encourages them to increase investment, and at 
the moment the MPC is delivering this.

However its efforts are hampered by repeated calls for interest rate rises 
whenever a piece of positive news is published. Such a move would be premature.

12.25pm BST 

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says there are plenty of reasons for the 
Bank of England to be considering a rate hike.

He thinks rates will remain unchanged until the second quarter of next year, 
though.


With the UK economy seemingly starting off the second quarter strongly 
following GDP growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, the 
unemployment rate falling markedly to 6.9% in three months to February and 
annual house price inflation moving above 10.0% on the Nationwide’s measure in 
April, there is growing pressure on the Bank of England to seriously consider 
hiking interest rates.

Sujatha Krishnan-Barman, financial services analyst at The Economist 
Intelligence Unit, warns that the coming months will be tricky for Barclays (
especially for staff who are laid off).

The bank will still need to reserve capital for the loans in the bad bank, 
which will constrain lending capacity

The large job cuts will make for a painful 12-18 months at Barclays, as the 
bank seeks to shift its focus from investment banking to retail operations in 
Britain and in emerging markets."

Barclays isn't the only company pinning its hopes on a shiny turnaround plan. 
Supermarket chainMorrisons has been defending its own strategy after reporting 
a 7% tumble in like-for-like sales in the last 13 weeks.

CEO Dalton Philips insists that the company's new "I'm cheaper" strategy of 
price cuts will pay off, in a tough trading environment for most supermarkets.


But analysts are far from impressed by today's results. Independent retail 
analyst Nick Bubb described the sales decline was "dreadful". 

After a shaky start, Morrison's share are now up 2.8% today, but have shed 
almost a quarter of their value so far this year.

Brenda Kelly of IG says Morrisons continues to serve up "cold hard gruel to 
its shareholders"

Shareholders must be hoping that the firm has deliberately front-loaded all 
the bad news, but executing such a major turnaround in the full glare of 
analyst scrutiny is going to be a far harder task than many realise.

 (£),Martin Arnold explains why Barclays is shunting its European banking 
operations into its new bad bank:

The unit is expected to include Barclays’ retail banking businesses in France, 
Italy, Spain and Portugal, which it has been attempting to sell for several 
years. Losses from its 572 branches in continental Europe widened from £277m to 
£964m last year.

Robert Lyddon, General Secretary of international banking network IBOS, says 
Barclays is now entrenching into its domestic arena and regarding "overseas 
business as innately speculative":

This is the apogee of the ‘home markets’ strategy, pressed on the UK banks by 
the government and regulators, and designed to deprive UK businesses of access 
to normal banking services outside the UK.

costs.

Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital explains the mini-rally:

Traders were worried that the Fed may suddenly tighten policies and the lack 
of clarity in forward guidance didn’t help. Yellen’s remarks yesterday however, 
will go some way in soothing worries about unexpected rate hikes.

Adding further support to market sentiment, Russia’s president Putin called on 
separatists in Ukraine to delay a planned referendum and said his troops had 
been withdrawn from Ukraine’s border.

This move is widely being seen as risk-positive in markets as it shows Russia 
attempting to de-escalate the crisis. There are now growing hopes that Russia 
continues down this path and that this latest move isn’t just a one-off.

Over in the insurance world, Prudential has reported a 35% drop in individual

defer retirement.

"Alongside other market participants, we anticipate a disruption to sales, 
which could be significant, in the individual annuities market."


Prudential reported 29% growth in new business profit in the first quarter, 
with Asia up 20%, the US 67% ahead and the UK 90% higher, thanks to three big 
bulk annuity deals. Its fund management arm saw net inflows of £1.4bn.

Jill Treanor on Barclays' radical overhaul

Here's Jill Treanor's full news story on Barclay's job cuts and transformation 
plan:

Barclays is axing 19,000 jobs in a radical overhaul of its business, including 
a dramatic scaling back of its troublesome investment banking operations, where 
almost one in three jobs are to go. More than half of the 19,000 job cuts will 
fall in the UK.

Facing pressure to bolster the bank's profits, Barclays' chief executive, 
Antony Jenkins, said: "This is a bold simplification of Barclays. We will be a 
focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, 
scale and competitive advantage."

The cutbacks will see the headcount reduced to 120,000 by 2016 although 
Jenkins has previously indicated the number could eventually fall to 100,000 as 
technology replaces people.

Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said that demand remains pretty

"Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is

"However, with supply of properties being slow to respond to market 
conditions, stronger demand in the past year has resulted in upward pressure on 
house prices."

well positioned to deliver lower volatility, higher returns, and growth.

My goal is unchanged: to create a Barclays that does business in the right

deserve. However, the way in which we will achieve this is different.

Today we are setting out how we will reach that goal and create the 'Go-To'

Central Banks meet; Barclays announces turnaround plan

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, 
the world economy, business and the eurozone.

Busy day ahead, with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both 
holding their monthly monetary policy meetings. We're not expecting any major 
changes, but Mario Draghi's press conference (from 1.30pm) will be as 
unmissable as ever.

In the corporate world -- Barclays is announcing its long-awaited strategic 
plan, with thousands of investment bankers being let go. Morrisons, BT and 
Centrica are all reporting results too.

And in the financial markets, shares are expected to rise after Russian 
president Vladimir Putin pulled a Ukrainian u-turn yesterday, and called for 
pro-Russia separatists in the east of the countrry to pause their referedum.

I"ll be tracking all the main developments through the day.
