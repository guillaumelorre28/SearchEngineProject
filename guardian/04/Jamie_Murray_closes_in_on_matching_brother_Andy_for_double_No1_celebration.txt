Jamie Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamie-murray> has always 
marched to the beat of his own drum, sparing the odd glance to the front of the 
parade, where his younger brother Andy has invariably been swamped in applause. 
Now they could be about to make history together, the first brothers to be No1 
in the world in singles and doubles.

Murray moved a step closer last night when he and his Brazilian partner, Bruno 
Soares, won their third match in a row at the ATP World Tour finals, defeating 
the Croatian Ivan Dodig and Soares’s compatriot, Marcelo Melo, 6-3, 3-6, 10-6 
to seal a place in the semi-finals.

They have real prospects of winning the tournament. Today, Murray’s former 
partner John Peers could even help him and Soares get there, as they play 
Pierre-Hugues -Herbert and Nicolas Mahut.

As the elder Murray said after their final round-robin doubles match: “It’s 
not something I really thought about at the start of the season. I entered the 
year with a new partner. Of course I was hoping it was going to go well. I 
really thought that it would. We got off to a great start. We were just 
focusing on our games, our tournaments. To be honest, it was probably harder 
for Andy than us, because [Novak] Djokovic is, like, winning everything. To get 
past him was going to take a monumental effort. The doubles was a lot more open.

“The French guys [-Herbert and Mahut] dominated for a while, especially the 
first half of the season. But we won the right tournaments that kept us in the 
hunt for it.”
