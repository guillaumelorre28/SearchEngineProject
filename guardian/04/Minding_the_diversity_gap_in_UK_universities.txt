While welcoming the prime minister’s latest announcement that universities 
must be transparent about the admission of black and minority ethnic students (
Top universities stand by record on diversity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/31/university-of-oxford-rebuts-camerons-claims-over-student-diversity>
, 1 February), an issue of greater importance is the attainment of BME students 
once at university. 

A slightly higher proportion of the BME population attend university than 
their white British counterparts, but fewer achieve the “good” degree – a first 
or 2:1 – that is so important for future success. (A recent study has shown 
that BME graduates are less likely to be employed six months after graduating 
than their white colleagues, and earn less.) Of all UK-domiciled students 
graduating in 2013 across all universities, 33% more of the white cohort 
received a good degree than the BME cohort. This is in stark contrast to the 
position in schools, where many ethnic groups outperform white schoolchildren.

We know from the research that this gap cannot be explained away by prior 
qualifications, subject of study or other student characteristics. Yet this 
disparity has not received the attention it deserves; perhaps it has been just 
too uncomfortable and difficult to deal with. At Kingston University we are 
determined to address this gap and are holding ourselves to account by making 
the gap a board-level key performance indicator. At the heart of our approach 
is a university-wide strategy and the use of the Guardian’s value-added 
methodology, which has allowed us to raise awareness by demonstrating clearly 
to our staff at faculty, school and course level how their BME students are 
falling short of the attainment we should be expecting given their entry 
qualifications and subject of study.

We do not have all the answers as to why this is – the issues are clearly 
complex – but we are committed to working with our staff and students to tackle 
this major failing in higher education.

• The Higher Education Act 2004  
<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/8/contents>made university admissions 
a matter of academic freedom. If the government were serious about broadening 
access, it could amend the act to give theOffice for Fair Access 
<https://www.offa.org.uk/> the power to ensure university admissions processes 
were fair, using information it already has. Unfortunately, the government’s
recent green paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/nov/16/dont-let-social-mobility-fade-out-in-the-noise-of-university-reform>
 proposes the abolition of Offa.
