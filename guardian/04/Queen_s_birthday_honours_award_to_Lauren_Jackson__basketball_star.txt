When Lauren Jackson was asked to be Australia’s flag bearer at the London 
Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, she immediately questioned why.

Her reply was hardly different when told she’d made the Queen’s birthday 
honours list.

“How?!” the basketball star said. “It’s one of those things that never in my 
wildest dreams did I think I’d be honoured with.”

Jackson has been appointed an officer in the Order of Australia (AO), having 
won four Olympic medals, Commonwealth Games gold and several other achievements 
in the WNBA and WNBL.

The accolade also recognises her role as a mentor to women in sport and social 
work.

With injuries limiting her time on court in recent years, the 34-year-old has 
spent much of her time studying gender equality and pursuing causes such as the 
campaign against domestic violence.

“I feel my social responsibility is to give back to the community, and that’s 
where I’m passionate,” she said.

Jackson added the award also provided added motivation to overcome an ongoing 
knee injury and return for “one last year” before retiring.

“When you achieve or get accolades like this, it makes you want to be able to 
be successful again – especially at the point of my career – and just say thank 
you,” she said.

She was among a handful of sporting identities to be honoured on Monday.

Former CEO of the International Cricket Council Malcolm Speed was appointed an 
officer in the Order of Australia, while Olympic canoeing coach Ben Hutchings 
was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM).

Former Wallaby forward and long-serving Australian Rugby Union chairman and 
president Ron Graham also became a member of the Order of Australia (AM).
