Australia’s financial intelligence unit, Austrac, is taking wagering and keno 
operator Tabcorp to court, claiming it has failed to comply with anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) has launched 
civil penalty proceedings against Tabcorp in the federal court.

The maximum penalty for a contravention of the anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorism financing laws is $17m.

Austrac said on Wednesday it had made a long and comprehensive assessment of 
Tabcorp’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing compliance, and 
Tabcorp had failed to take steps to make improvements.


“Noncompliance of this nature provides opportunities for organised crime to 
exploit vulnerabilities and puts at risk the integrity of the Australian 
financial system,” Austrac said in a statement.

“Austrac works to keep dirty money out of our financial system, which helps 
protect the Australian community from serious and organised crime.”

Tabcorp said it had been advised of the legal proceedings on Wednesday.

“Tabcorp takes its compliance obligations extremely seriously,” the company 
said in a statement. “Tabcorp is reviewing the nature of the proceedings and 
will inform the market of its intended response.”

Shares in Tabcorp were 10.5 cents lower at $4.875 shortly after noon.
