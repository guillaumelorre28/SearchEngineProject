Six Observer and Guardian colleagues have made it on to the Press Gazette's 
list of the top 50 business journalists in the UK.

The list is based on a survey of 50 journalists working in the sector who were 
asked to name their top five contemporaries. This was combined with a survey of 
1,000 members of the public, carried out by iCD Research. The survey focused on 
front line reporters rather than editors.

The BBC's Robert Peston took the top spot, with Martin Lewis from 
MoneySavingExpert.com in second place, although all his votes came from the 
public. The Corporation also took the number one slot in the list of the UK's 
top 10 most trusted sources for news about business. The Guardian was in 9th 
position.

Congratulations to our journalists included in the top 50: Tim Webb, Larry 
Elliott, Jill Treanor, Will Hutton, Nils Pratley, William Keegan.
