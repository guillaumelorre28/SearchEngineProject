Small Island 
<http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,12084,1146440,00.html>, Andrea 
Levy's humane, generous exploration of post-war England through the eyes of two 
couples, one English and one Jamaican, has beenchosen from the 10 winners of 
the Orange Prize for Fiction 
<http://books.theguardian.com/news/page/0,8097,1583857,00.html> for the 'best 
of the best' award. The award was conceived to celebrate 10 years of Orange 
Prize, which has overcome the controversy sparked at its inception by its 
woman-only policy to become one of the UK's most prestigious literary prizes. 
It was judged by the chairs of previous Orange judging panels and chaired by 
Kate Mosse, the award's co-founder and honorary director.

At this evening's ceremony at the Lyric Theatre in London, a delighted-looking 
Levy - who beat Carol Shields, Linda Grant and Ann Patchett, among others, to 
the gong - was presented with a silver statuette in honour of the occasion. 
After congratulating Levy on her win, Mosse went on to describe the new award 
as "a fantastic way to celebrate 10 years of exceptional women's fiction and 
mark the achievements of the Orange Prize," and "a great opportunity to 
introduce a new generation of readers to some of the outstanding novels they 
may have missed first time round."

Certainly, there were plenty of outstanding novels to choose from, and the 
judges must have had a tough time deciding whom to vote for. Do you think they 
got it right?
