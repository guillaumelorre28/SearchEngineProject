So, two corporate corpses strew the business super highway and we’re only two 
episodes in. The body count is only going to rise from here on in. Do you have 
the stomach for it?

Because I’ll be back here next Wednesday to basically type all of this again.

Back at chump HQ, the wallies eat pasta and await the return of their 
“friends”. There’s a lot of American whooping but they’re all aware that their 
corporate death is but weeks away. It’s like life, isn’t it?

We all end up on the receiving end of the firing finger, one way or another. 
Oh my god we’re all going to die!!!

Who says The Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> 
is just a reality TV show? It’s actually quite profound isn’t it? Am I reading 
too much into it?

How about them apples. I truly think he chooses these early sacrificial lambs 
on the basis of who jips him the most. Try to imagine he and Aisha actually 
working together. She’d drive him to drink.

You're fired

The plinky music of doom begins. The final protestations are silenced as he 
sums up his concerns... “And for that reason...” is the tease phrase he uses to 
trick us into thinking he’s about to sack someone.

But he’s actually sacking... come on Alan... he’s actually sacking... Aisha!

I don’t think Natalie is going home. Aisha butts in and tries to play the 
superior card, pointing out further reasons why the other two should go. I 
think he’ll fire more than one of them.

Natalie gets it in the neck for delivering a shite pitch. She was rubbish, to 
be fair. She blames the product and says her pitch would have been fine it it 
weren’t for the crappy shampoo.

Vana’s sour chops say it all. She’s got to stop the sulk or she’ll be out of

Natalie gets both barrels from Karrren (both barrrels) for saying that people 
over 45 don’t like new things and generally fear change.

Coming back to the boardroom are Vana, Aisha and Natalie. Who to fire?

Focus switched to Vana as she gets that face that candidates get when they 
start to wine and hurl excuses any which way to deflect the blame elsewhere.

Claude points out that Elle is the naysayer of the group, constantly 
criticising group decisions but coming up with nothing of her own. She tries to 
blend into the wall and luckily for her, someone else starts talking.

Aisha is suddenly very quiet in the sad cafe. Elle seizes the opportunity to 
slam her and doesn’t mince words when she declares the project manager to be a 
total bust. Who will Aisha bring back to the boardroom with her? If I were her, 
I’d nix Vana and Selina. But I only say Selina because I can’t think of a 
single thing she’s said or done since the show began.

Alan announces that Western is the winning shampoo. Well stone me, the boys 
have done it. He tells them they have done the best advert in Apprentice 
history and sends them to an anti-gravity yoga class. What a crud prize.

So, two corporate corpses strew the business super highway and we’re only two 
episodes in. The body count is only going to rise from here on in. Do you have 
the stomach for it?

Because I’ll be back here next Wednesday to basically type all of this again. 
Join me!
 
Back at chump HQ, the wallies eat pasta and await the return of their 
“friends”. There’s a lot of American whooping but they’re all aware that their 
corporate death is but weeks away. It’s like life, isn’t it?

We all end up on the receiving end of the firing finger, one way or another. 
Oh my god we’re all going to die!!!

Who says The Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> 
is just a reality TV show? It’s actually quite profound isn’t it? Am I reading 
too much into it?
 
How about them apples. I truly think he chooses these early sacrificial lambs 
on the basis of who jips him the most. Try to imagine he and Aisha actually 
working together. She’d drive him to drink.
 
The plinky music of doom begins. The final protestations are silenced as he 
sums up his concerns... “And for that reason...” is the tease phrase he uses to 
trick us into thinking he’s about to sack someone.

But he’s actually sacking... come on Alan... he’s actually sacking... Aisha!
 
I don’t think Natalie is going home. Aisha butts in and tries to play the 
superior card, pointing out further reasons why the other two should go. I 
think he’ll fire more than one of them.
 
“Sorry, don’t touch me,” snarks Aisha as Natalie’s elbow brushes against her. 
Fight!
 
Natalie gets it in the neck for delivering a shite pitch. She was rubbish, to 
be fair. She blames the product and says her pitch would have been fine it it 
weren’t for the crappy shampoo.
 
Vana’s sour chops say it all. She’s got to stop the sulk or she’ll be out of 
the door faster than you can say, “Thank you for the opportunity, Lord Sugar”.
 
Natalie gets both barrels from Karrren (both barrrels) for saying that people 
over 45 don’t like new things and generally fear change.

Coming back to the boardroom are Vana, Aisha and Natalie. Who to fire?
 
Focus switched to Vana as she gets that face that candidates get when they 
start to wine and hurl excuses any which way to deflect the blame elsewhere.

Claude points out that Elle is the naysayer of the group, constantly 
criticising group decisions but coming up with nothing of her own. She tries to 
blend into the wall and luckily for her, someone else starts talking.
 
Alan is already quite cross with Aisha and she is raising her defensive 
shields as the team descend into blame and in-fighting. Wise move, Aisha. You 
have made no friends this night.
 
Aisha is suddenly very quiet in the sad cafe. Elle seizes the opportunity to 
slam her and doesn’t mince words when she declares the project manager to be a 
total bust. Who will Aisha bring back to the boardroom with her? If I were her, 
I’d nix Vana and Selina. But I only say Selina because I can’t think of a 
single thing she’s said or done since the show began.
 
The anti-gravity yoga appears to be normal yoga, but in hammocks.
 
A man went last night, which woman are we sacking off this evening? Aisha has 
been fairly awful throughout but will she try to drag Charleine down with her?
 
Alan announces that Western is the winning shampoo. Well stone me, the boys 
have done it. He tells them they have done the best advert in Apprentice 
history and sends them to an anti-gravity yoga class. What a crud prize.
 
“As guys” says Richard, we don’t want to see hair blowing in the wind. This 
doesn’t make any sense at all. David directed the video but basically that 
involved doing what he was told. By the way, this is my first awareness of 
David. He is like the Jenny of the boys’ team. Stealth candidate, trying to fly 
sub-radar for the first few weeks.
