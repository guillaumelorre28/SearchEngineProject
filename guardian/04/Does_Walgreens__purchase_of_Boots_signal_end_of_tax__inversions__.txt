Is the game up for US companies seeking tax "inversions"? Walgreens, in 
completing the purchase ofAlliance Boots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceboots>, chose not to take the low 
road to Bern and will stay in Chicago instead.

This was not quite the act of corporate patriotism President Obama has been 
trying to encourage. Walgreens said the technicalities of its two-stage 
purchase of Boots meant it might not have qualified for an inversion anyway. 
But it had another reason: it was "mindful of the ongoing public reaction to a 
potential inversion" especially as a "major portion" of its revenues flow from 
US public healthcare programmes.

The latter point applies to Pfizer, so it was logical that AstraZeneca's 
shares should fall 3.5%. Pfizer's sums only worked with a tax flip. If US 
public and political opinion is now too hostile to inversions, a fresh tilt at 
AZ is definitely less likely.

AbbVie's planned £30bn takeover of the UK's Shire is slightly different. A 
deal has been agreed and a stiff penalty – $500m (£296m) or $960m (£569m) 
depending on circumstances – applies if the bidder doesn't complete. AbbVie, 
not being a household name in the US, may also not give a damn about US opinion.

But it is harder to ignore Obama and the US Treasury taking executive action 
to combat inversions. That is what is now being threatened. The 10% gap between 
Shire's share price and the implied takeover price says the deal is in serious 
trouble.
