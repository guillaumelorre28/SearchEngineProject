Few things are unimproved by the addition of a slide. Stairs at home. Improved 
with a slide!

 Anish Kapoor’s £23m steel-company-sponsored Orbit in the Olympic Park that has 
been losing taxpayers£10,000 a week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/20/olympic-parks-orbit-tower-costing-taxpayer-10000-a-week>
? Improved with a slide! Wait … or is it? Kapoor has been complaining that the 
178m tunnel slide created by Carsten Höller (of Tate Modern Turbine Hall 
slide-fame) wasfoisted upon his artwork by London mayor Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/26/anish-kapoor-addition-artwork-foisted-on-him-boris-johnson>
 in an attempt to raise revenue (which should do the trick given that sliding 
down the Orbit will cost an acrophobic £17; that’s £12 to get to the top, £5 to 
slide down).

“It may be theoretically losing money,” said Kapoor with a pleasingly artistic 
reading of the balance sheet, “but the fact that it has over 200,000 visitors, 
I think that’s a considerable gain.” Tell you what’s more of a gain, pal, a 
178m slide. With that in mind, we asked the Guardian’s crack in-house team of 
slide engineers to revamp other British landmarks with the aim of maximising 
revenues to a Boris-pleasing degree. Wheeeeeeeeee!!

When Antony Gormley’s giant geordie was unveiled in 1998 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/29/how-we-made-the-angel-of-the-north>
, a common criticism, and one that particularly bothered Gormo was the 
suggestion that it looked a bit fascist. Well, Mussolini may have made the 
trains run on time, but how many giant plastic slides did he build down the 
Spanish Steps? Zero. No wonder he lost the war.

It’s a decent church all right. Not a bad church at all. And sure, when it was 
the tallest building on the planet for 250 years it was impressive. But imagine 
how much more impressive it would have been if Norman builders had had access 
to mouldable polyethylene. Take note, revenue-maximising officials, that this 
slide sends riders straight back inside to the gift shop.

How much fun are a load of old stones anyway? Exactly. If only the mayor of 
Amesbury had the commercial nous of London’s fun-happy CEO. Purists and hippies 
may disapprove, but give them a few complimentary rides on the water flumes and 
they’ll come around quicker than you can say “recurring tailbacks on the A303”.

Tower Bridge may be a beautiful, Grade I-listed, city-defining masterpiece of 
19th-century bascule-bridge engineering, but does it have a slide? No. Sorted.
