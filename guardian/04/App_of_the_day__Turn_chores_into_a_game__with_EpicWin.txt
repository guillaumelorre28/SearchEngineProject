Stop what you are doing, and check out EpicWin <http://www.epicwinapp.com/>. 
This is undoubtedly the best productivity app you willever find. 

Created by Rex 'LittleBigPlanet <http://www.littlebigplanet.com/>' Crowle and 
Tak 'Fox vs Duck <http://www.foxvsduck.com/>' Fung, EpicWin will, for the 
modest sum of £1.79, rescue those of us who find time to plant virtual 
vegetables. but struggle to get the actual, real washing up done. The solution? 
Turn daily tasks into a role playing game.

"By getting points for your chores it's easier to actually get things done," 
said Crowle. "We all have
good intentions but we need a bit of encouragement here and there. Doing the 
laundry is an
epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?"

Build up a to-do list for your EpicWin character (Dwarf? Warrior? Treeman 
Berzerker for an extra 59p? Yes please!) and as you battle through it every 
day, your character completes quests and earns points. Your quest is plotted on 
a map (Put the rubbish out - tick! Rescue mobile from drooling baby - tick!) 
and you collect loot, and quests can be autotweeted if you dare.

"The more you do, the further you will journey and the further you go, the 
more loot you will uncover and the more your character will level-up in skills 
and stature. And unlike traditional videogames you'll then benefit from a 
tidier home, a more organised working day or succeeding in whatever other life 
goals you wish to achieve."

In short: It's an absolute delight - funny, great looking and actually useful. 
In my experience, productivity apps are dull and take as much time setting up 
as they might save. But heck - at least this is fun.
