So it is possible to get justice in modern Russia. Alexander Lebedev's 
sentence to 150 hours of community service 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jul/02/alexander-lebedev-sentenced-community-service>
for punching – or appearing to punch – a man during a television talkshow seems 
about right in the circumstances.

However much Lebedev was provoked by the man, Sergei Polonsky, he should not 
have got physical. Media owners should know better.

That said, it could have been so much worse for Lebedev if the ridiculous (and 
sinister) charge of hooliganism motivated by "political hatred" had stuck 
rather than the simple battery offence. Then he would have gone to jail, which 
would have been a travesty.

It is not far-fetched to suggest that such a politically influenced 
prosecution would have been seen across the world as some kind of revenge by 
the authorities on behalf of Russia's president,Vladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>.

Lebedev is co-owner, with a former president, Mikhail Gorbachev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-gorbachev>, of a paper that Putin 
and his Kremlin cronies despise – the Moscow-based Novaya Gazeta.

A liberal paper, it has a record of critical and investigative journalism that 
has often embarrassed Putin's administration. It is to Lebedev's and 
Gorbachev's credit that they have continued to publish the paper, especially 
given that four Novaya Gazeta journalists, including the excellentAnna 
Politkovskaya <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya>, have been 
murdered.

It will surely also be the case that journalists working in Britain for 
Lebedev and his son, Evgeny, will be relieved by Tuesday's sentence.

If he had gone to jail, it was possible that the Russian businesses that are 
the basis of his fortune would have been devastated too, thereby putting the 
future of the Independent, Independent on Sunday, i and theLondon Evening 
Standard <https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard> in 
jeopardy.

No wonder his son Evgeny tweeted immediately after the sentence was announced 
that it was "not as bad as it might have been" and called it "the end, finally, 
of a deeply worrying time for us all."

The worrying time began with that silly moment in September 2011 when Lebedev 
swung a punch at Polonsky, a billionaire property developer known for his 
eccentric behaviour, during a TV chat show.

Everyone who knows Lebedev said it was an uncharacteristic act on his part. 
Lebedev said he was provoked because Polonsky threatened him.

Polonsky, in a bizarre turn of events, was arrested in Cambodia at end of last 
year on a charge of kidnapping several Cambodian seamen.

He then turned up in Israel and started to taunt Lebvedev in a series of 
tweets before, in yet another odd twist, calling for Lebedev to be acquitted 
and pleading with the state prosecutor to drop the hooliganism charge.

He did not attend the trial and is being sought in Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> on charges of embezzlement.

In others words, the whole business has been excruciatingly embarrassing for 
Lebedev. Thank goodness for him, and for his employees, that good sense 
prevailed in the end.
