Battleborn (Granta) is a collection of 10 short stories rooted in small-town 
Nevada. Unsettling and compelling, Claire Vaye Watkins's writing has deservedly 
been likened toCormac McCarthy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy> and Annie Proulx 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/annie-proulx> for its fresh, foreboding 
approach to America's west, withHari Kunzru 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harikunzru> hailing her as "one of the 
most exciting young voices in American fiction".

Vaye Watkins wrote Battleborn during her master of fine arts at Ohio State 
University (the first time she had lived away from the west) and two months 
after her mother died. "It's kind of a homesick book and a grieving book," she 
says. "A lot of the stories are mutated, exaggerated or sculpted versions of 
rumours whispered around my town and the mythology of the Mojave desert, where 
I was from."

The dark, backstreet tales feature a tourist lost in Death Valley, a teenage 
girl whose boyfriend tries to give her an abortion, and an emotional encounter 
in a brothel. The title is both a reference toNevada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada> (the Battle Born State) and an 
overarching motif in this spellbinding book.
