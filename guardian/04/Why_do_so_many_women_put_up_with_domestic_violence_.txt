From an anonymous female
My daughter (aged over 40) has been with her husband for more than 15 years. 
He is a heavy drinker and while drunk often beats her up. She has fled to my 
home on several occasions but always returns to him.

Lately he has lost his job and his drinking is now daily, with my daughter 
suffering frequent beatings in front of the three children. He's always 
insisted she shouldn't work and now he has no income either so I find myself 
sending them money and food regularly.

Carole, when I suggest she should leave him, she just laughs. What's up with 
that?

Carole replies:
For your daughter simply to pack and go seems, on the surface, like the 
obvious choice, but what has he threatened to do to her if she attempts this? 
If she leaves will she have to change the children's schools, and where will 
she go? Back to her mum?

It has been theorised that some women who live with domestic violence do so 
because they learned how to when they themselves were growing up.1 
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/u3v7j0121t431kr1/> If so, this would mean 
that your three grandchildren are, at this very moment, adapting to abnormal 
patterns ofattachment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory> that 
could well give them pain throughout their lives. Other research has suggested 
that while battered mothers can provide the maternal warmth their children 
need, they are unable to supply maternal authority due to low self-esteem.2

According to some surveys, approximately a quarter of all heterosexual women 
experience physical or sexual abuse, or both, by an intimate partner at some 
time during their lives.3 <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/181867.htm> 
This damage radiates outwards from the victim, scarring her children and others 
emotionally close to her.4

Women habituated to battery are frequently unable to step back and take stock 
of the bigger picture. The trauma impacts upon cognition and they tend to 
employ short-term coping strategies, such as fleeing when violence erupts, only 
to return during a hiatus when things are quiet and he has said sorry.5 
<http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pst/34/4/410/> 

Frequently men who batter their partners justify the violence by saying she 
provoked them and should have realised they would become angry or jealous. 
Jealousy of the perpetrator is a universally cited reason given by victims for 
why their male partner battered them. Incidentally, male jealousy is theorised 
to have evolved as a way to dominate females and assure paternity.6

Victims are often blamed and frequently blame themselves. They may feel guilt 
or shame. In addition, a woman's uncertainty over finances or inability to 
manage the situation will result in anxiety and feelings of helplessness.

Unfortunately, if a victim empathises with her abuser's psychological 
weaknesses she may forgive and even pity him. Women like this need external 
intervention to help them to objectify their relationship and see it for what 
it is, so they can start to prioritise their own needs without feeling guilt or 
pity.7 <http://www.springerlink.com/content/h163405tn1v87232/>

You say your son-in-law has just lost his job and he has always forbidden your 
daughter from working. The tighter money becomes the more your daughter will be 
punished.8 <http://vaw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/5/2/110>,9 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Out-Darkness-Contemporary-Perspectives-Violence/dp/0761907769>
 He sounds like a socially inflexible, jealous, controlling man, who suffers 
low self-esteem, has intentionally isolated your daughter and stamps on her to 
raise his own status. His uncontrollable anger is never far from the surface 
and soon your grandchildren will not just be witnesses, they will become 
physical victims of battery too.

What can you do to put a stop to this? There is no single, universally 
effective strategy for ending abuse.10 
<http://vaw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/5/514> You want to help your 
daughter, but you also feel frustrated by her. Don't tell her she has brought 
this on herself and that you tried to warn her but she wouldn't listen to you. 
She needs help to self-assess so try not to judge her.

The money and food parcels that you send are only perpetuating the problem. 
You've got to get her professional help. I would suggest you go with your 
daughter to her GP and ask for a referral to the localChild and Adolescent 
Mental Health Services (CAMHS) <http://www.camhscares.nhs.uk/> department. 
Insist that your daughter and grandchildren are assessed by a clinical 
psychologist/psychiatrist with expertise in this domain. An application for 
sheltered accommodation and re-housing may be justified. The multidisciplinary 
staff found at a CAMHS department can help negotiate this and also offer other 
therapies.

Change will, in the short term, cause stress, but eventually if your daughter 
and her children stick together and make a break from this man they will not 
remain as victims of violence. Instead, over time and with help, the children 
will develop into the people they should have been had they lived in a stable 
and harmonious environment from birth.

Once re-settled your daughter should get a part-time job, or volunteer at her 
children's school, or re-train, so long as the hours suit her children's needs.
11 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16134046> This will help raise her 
self-esteem and stop her from remaining isolated at home.

It's not too late for any of these changes to be successfully implemented, but 
the time is now.
