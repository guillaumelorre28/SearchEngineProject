Kara Walker had her first major success as an artist with her intricate and 
compulsive black-and-white paper silhouettes of imagined scenes from slave 
history in the American south. In 1994, her room-size mural,Gone: An Historical 
Romance of a Civil War as It Occurred b’tween the Dusky Thighs of One Young 
Negress and Her Heart, won her international acclaim, and made her at 27 one of 
the youngest ever recipients of a MacArthur “genius” grant.

In the years since, she has continued to develop her private mythology, which 
dramatises and deconstructs racial and sexual stereotypes. This work has 
included last year’sA Subtlety, a vast sphinx-like sculpture made of sugar, 
which filled a derelict sugar warehouse in Brooklyn, and attracted more than 
100,000 visitors. She is currently in London,at the Victoria Miro gallery 
<http://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/481/>, for a show that features a 
cut-out mural dwelling on the symbolism ofStone Mountain 
<https://www.stonemountainpark.com/activities/history-nature/Confederate-Memorial-Carving>
, a monolithic confederate monument in Atlanta, Georgia. She gave this 
interview last Sunday, in front of a wall of black paper, immediately before 
embarking on the cutting process.

You moved from California to Atlanta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta>, Georgia, when you were 13. That 
seems to have been an abrupt and formative transition for you…
Yes. There is I suppose, historically, this seminal moment in the lives of 
African Americans where one becomes black. Frantz Fanon and everyone talks 
about it. There is a moment when you go from subject to object and I guess that 
was my moment. I think of California as golden diverse kind of period, which is 
not entirely true. But certainly in Georgia, in high school, things were very 
locked down into black and white. You were forced to determine your allegiance.

This show specifically dwells on Stone Mountain, a huge carved civil war 
monument. Why did you want to go back to it?
I was talking about confederate emblems to a friend, a photographer. This has 
been a big topic of conversation since the nine African American churchgoers 
wereshot in South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/18/charleston-church-shooting-nine-dead-after-hate-attack>
 and I happened to mention that there is this mountain that I grew up in the 
shadow of, kind of literally. The mountain was claimed by the Ku Klux Klan in 
1915 as their spiritual birthplace and the carving was proposed in 1916. It was 
finally completed in 1972. So we came down to photograph it, and this show 
arose out of that.

Have you ever shown your work in Atlanta?
No, I haven’t had a solo exhibition there since graduate shows. [Laughs] I 
thought maybe Atlanta will pay attention if I have a show about Atlanta in 
London.

The mountain was claimed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1915 as their spiritual 
birthplace

How come no gallery will show the work in the south?
I don’t know. Early on I had a letter from a museum in Mississippi that was 
interested to show my work but “not with the sex and violence”. I was like: I 
can’t censor it for you, it’s all in there.

Where did the impulse to make the cut-out murals come from originally?
I think it goes back to when I first got to graduate school. I was 22. I was 
writing to find my voice, because I didn’t talk very much. This kind of Marquis 
de Sade stuff started coming out of me, which I didn’t know was there. I was 
writing on a typewriter in an open studio. A friend later called those my 
Unabomber writings. It was a release that was very real, disruptive and 
secretive. I think the cut paper has that same quality.

The murals are both shocking and angry and sometimes gruesomely comic, the 
tone is hard to pin down…
Yes, I was looking at the identity politics of the 1970s and 1980s and 
thinking the idea of a single identity – the militant black woman, or whatever 
– wasn’t enough. At any one moment I felt like 13 different characters piecing 
themselves together. Some of it was coming out of bizarre lived sexual 
experiences I’d had with people who will go unnamed, some of it was, like, I 
don’t know, readingGone With the Wind. The feeling I was left with was that it 
was probably my job to gather all those pieces back into one room. They were 
all pieces of me and they were unruly. There is a stream of consciousness thing 
that happens when I do the cut paper pieces. I am making the piece here in the 
gallery for that reason.

It’s a change of scale from last year’s sugar sphinx – how did you come to be 
working at that scale?
I was asked to go and look at this factory and see what I could do. I mean, in 
retrospect, making that piece was extremely pleasurable but it took me a long 
time to work out how to use that space. It was frigging colossal and it stank 
of molasses. The process was too rich in a way, brain chaos. In the end the 
piece had this kind of sparkly big life. The sphinx came about when there was 
no more time. I was reading this book,Sweetness and Power, and I came across 
these sugar sculptures called subtleties that they had at medieval banquets. Up 
until that point I had been thinking of finger-wagging doom-laden things about 
the history of slavery and sugar and America. It didn’t take into account what 
people wanted to look at. When I came up with the idea and made it, it reminded 
me of wanting to do the cut-outs, that sense of giving people something they 
wanted to look at, working with their attention span in a way.

Are you returning to the paper cut-out work with a sense of relief or 
trepidation?
There is a lot of trepidation, but that is partly because I am making it here 
in the gallery, and I have been thinking about it for two months and I haven’t 
started it yet. I have a load of drawings and things in notebooks but I don’t 
want it to be fixed, or solid in that way. So most of that will be discarded.

When are you going to start?
This afternoon!
