National Gallery, London 
Artists before Rembrandt portrayed themselves and their families, but his 
paintings lay his life bare in a way that is unmatched. Here is his wife Saskia 
looking frail and vulnerable as he salutes her in a costume that symbolises 
spring and joy. She would die young in 1642. Rembrandt’s love is heartbreaking.

 Durango in a Canal, Belle Glade, FL. Photograph: Roe Ethridge 
Featured as this week’s My Best Shot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/27/roe-ethridge-best-photograph-car-florida-canal>
, Roe Ethridge told us the story behind his rental car falling in a canal near 
his parents’ hometown of Belle Glade, Florida. “It’s like the opening shot in a 
film noir: a car being pulled from a canal. But there’s a self-deprecating side 
to it, too. People ask: ‘Did someone die?’ No, it was just stupid old me, 
embarrassing my family again.”
