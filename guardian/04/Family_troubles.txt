Fifty-year-old Komariah lives with his wife and son in an immaculate one-room 
house in the countryside of southern Andhra Pradesh. The walls are a washed-out 
blue, and a shiny plastic clock featuring Hanuman the monkey god hangs on the 
wall.

Komariah and his wife Narasamma (who is out working in the fields) know that 
their 23-year old son, Bhumesh, is a kothi. Unlike many families who discover 
this, they have not thrown him out. But their relationship is not easy.

 "About three years ago, I came home and found Bhumesh having sex with a man," 
says Komariah. "That is how I found out. I was very distressed. I beat him and 
said, 'Why are you doing this? You are my only son.'

"After this, Bhumesh ran away from the house. His mother was very nervous and 
stopped eating. Neighbours kept asking, 'Where is your son?' So after 10 days I 
rang him and told him come home."

"What to do? He is habituated now, he can't stop. So many times we told him, 
'Don't do, don't do, don't do,' but still he doesn't listen to these words.

"It has become worse. Many people are asking, 'Why is your son not getting 
married? Why is your son like this?' He is my one son. I am suffering. His 
mother tried to commit suicide because of the shame.

"Because he is the only one son I decide: OK let him stay. After a time he has 
to look after things. If I had two, three sons it would be different, but he is 
the only one son. If I die he has to look after things."
