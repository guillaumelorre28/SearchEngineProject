Unbelievable. I was told I was going to be a tsar, and it turns out I'm only 
going to be a lord. The minute Margaret explained it to me, I summoned Gordon 
Brown. "I don't care if he's in a meeting," I barked at my secretary. "Get him 
over here now."

He arrived desperately out of breath, and was ushered in with the words, 
"Tsaralan will see you now."

"Lord?" I exploded. "Anybody can be a lord. That cretin Roy Jenkins was a 
lord. If I'd wanted to be a lord, I'd have paid the 100 grand years ago. I want 
to be a tsar. Or at the very least a doge."

"Enterprise doge it is, then," gibbered Gordon. "These are big times calling 
for big personalities, and a man of your big brain is absolutely essential to 
the war effort ..."

"Yeah, yeah," I snapped, my gnat-like attention span wandering. "But like I 
told Andrew Marr, I would never accept anything off of you that would 
compromise my work withThe Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>."

"That's just the right way round to look at it," agreed Gordon. "But if you 
could be just a tenth less dismissive of me in public, I'd be pathetically 
grateful. After all, at this point in my career, taking on a man whose 
catchphrase is, 'You're fired!' has seemed something of a risk ..."

"Don't begin to explain risk to me," I snorted, "because I've been a 
risk-taker all my life. Just look at the amount of 47-year-old strikers I 
bought when I was at Tottenham. Now get back to the penthouse." Bladdy idiot.
