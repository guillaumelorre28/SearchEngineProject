I donned my Pierre Cardin turtleneck and walked briskly north up 6th Avenue. 
Towards 53rd St. As I entered the Museum of Modern Art, a heavily tattooed 
pygmy slipped a note in my Harris tweed jacket. "Bollocks," it said. I 
instantly recognised the secret message and headed for the Jackson Pollocks. 
But which painting could the pygmy have meant? I stopped at the iconic 
stenographic figure. Of course! MoMA had hung it upside down! That squiggly W 
in the middle wasn't a W at all. It was an M! Pollock's art was celebrated for 
its Zoroastrian allusions and, according to ancient Bihistun inscription, M 
referred to the Ark of the Covenant.

"You've dropped your HB pencil, sir," a woman whispered.

"We haven't a moment to lose," I said, grabbing her arm and taking her though 
a secret portal to a golden chamber deep below Manhattan. "There are 871 rogue 
CIA operatives on our tail." We emerged in Mount Sinai hospital. "There," I 
gasped, pointing to a sinister, three-pointed symbol on a yellow background.

"That must be the X-ray department," my love interest said.

"That's what they want you to think," I said. "In the ancient tradition of the 
Grützedirndl Bavarian Society, that sign is the Death's Head Eagle."

It could mean only one thing. I called my publishers. "This could be the end 
of the world as we know it. Hitler is still alive."

"Fantastic," they said. "We can flog serialisation of his diaries to 
the Sunday Times."
