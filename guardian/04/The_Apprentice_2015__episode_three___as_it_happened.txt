There is no way in the world that a jury would have let Vana go free today. 
Elle says she has learned that there is nowhere to hide in the boardroom and 
they must all stand by their mistakes. Surely there won’t be enough room in the 
boardroom for the contestants AND all of their mistakes?

Next week, the gits attend a pet show and make a small boy cry. We can’t miss 
that can we?

I’m diving down among the comments now but thanks for coming. See you next 
week!

The moving finger fires...

Elle’s boat was too pricy, Jenny bought nothing and Vana was in charge so 
should take the bullet but will she?

We wait, they wait. He’s saving Elle for the last blast, isn’t he? No, it’s 
Jenny. Totally disagree with his decision. She was the least awful by a hundred 
miles. I guess the other two are better TV.

Lord Sugar will see you now (to fire one of you)

Vana, Jenny and Elle await their fate. Vana accuses Jenny of wavering and 
energy-sapping. I do not get this from Jenny at all. Alan points out that Jenny 
bought nothing and there’s no excuse for that.

Elle is back, according to Vana, because, as set up earlier, she gave her full 
UK responsibility.

Natalie incurred £61 worth of fines for buying the wrong cheese. It’s the 
wrong cheese, Gromit! But she says the tasks didn’t fail on the cheese alone. 
At which, Vana turns on Kent bureau chief Jenny. She describes Jenny as “dead 
weight”. Ouch.

Selina finally lets rip with her opinions on Vana and Charleine and Vana seem 
to band together and turn on her, dubbing her a “wasp at a picnic”. Karren 
cautions team leader Vana not to laugh.

Surprise, Vana fingers Elle and Jenny for a boardroom return. Oh it is on.

Team Versatile tasting wine is the new thing I’ll now think of when I don’t 
want to laugh, say at a funeral or similar.

At the sad cafe, Elle and Vana finally pull their knives and start stabbing. 
They’ve been waiting all episode. Charleine calls Selina a morale vacuum. Nice 
turn of phrase but WOW she wanted to draw blood with that one. And so it’s back

There is no way in the world that a jury would have let Vana go free today. 
Elle says she has learned that there is nowhere to hide in the boardroom and 
they must all stand by their mistakes. Surely there won’t be enough room in the 
boardroom for the contestants AND all of their mistakes?

Next week, the gits attend a pet show and make a small boy cry. We can’t miss 
that can we?

I’m diving down among the comments now but thanks for coming. See you next 
week!
 
He is 100% allowing Vana to stay because she’s shaping up to be one of the 
worst people of all time.The Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> needs her sort.
 
Hang on, will he fire another one? Elle is given a free pass...
 
Elle’s boat was too pricy, Jenny bought nothing and Vana was in charge so 
should take the bullet but will she?

We wait, they wait. He’s saving Elle for the last blast, isn’t he? No, it’s 
Jenny. Totally disagree with his decision. She was the least awful by a hundred 
miles. I guess the other two are better TV.
 
Elle says it’s all Vana’s fault for making bad decisions about where to buy 
what. Jenny agrees that it’s Vana’s fault and Vana blames Jenny.
 
Vana, Jenny and Elle await their fate. Vana accuses Jenny of wavering and 
energy-sapping. I do not get this from Jenny at all. Alan points out that Jenny 
bought nothing and there’s no excuse for that.

Elle is back, according to Vana, because, as set up earlier, she gave her full 
UK responsibility.
 
“You got covered in bullshit,” says Alan as if reading from the script I have 
written for him. How hilarious that his new book is called “Unscripted”.
 
Natalie incurred £61 worth of fines for buying the wrong cheese. It’s the 
wrong cheese, Gromit! But she says the tasks didn’t fail on the cheese alone. 
At which, Vana turns on Kent bureau chief Jenny. She describes Jenny as “dead 
weight”. Ouch.

Selina finally lets rip with her opinions on Vana and Charleine and Vana seem 
to band together and turn on her, dubbing her a “wasp at a picnic”. Karren 
cautions team leader Vana not to laugh.

Surprise, Vana fingers Elle and Jenny for a boardroom return. Oh it is on.
 
Does anyone else think that April has totally wound her neck in this week? I 
miss April giving it some chat. Even her bun says, “oh don’t ask me, I’m just a 
follower, not a leader”.

Elle describes the agony of being sent back into the same shop four times, 
only to buy the boat she didn’t even slightly want to buy. Karren slams her for 
going against her gut instinct. Are the boys really getting away with Gary’s 
toy boat? What a swizz.
 
Team Versatile tasting wine is the new thing I’ll now think of when I don’t
