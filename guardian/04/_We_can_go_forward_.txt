Andrew Flintoff yesterday tried to be upbeat about the next Ashes series in 
2009. The captain's hope is that England will analyse and respond to defeat 
with the same ferocity as did Australia. "Though we have been beaten 5-0 it 
can't be a pointless exercise," Flintoff said. "It's a young side. As long as 
we have learned from this we can go forward.

"Some of the young lads have had success and shown they can compete against 
the best in the world. Every one has learned something. Australia have stuck to 
plans and exploited weaknesses, and that is something we can do. The 
Australians used their defeat at The Oval as a spur. I'm sure in 2009 we will 
remember what has happened here. Conceivably everyone who was in this Test 
could play in 2009."
