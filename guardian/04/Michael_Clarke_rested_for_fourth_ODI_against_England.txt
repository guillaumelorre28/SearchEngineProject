Michael Clarke <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-clarke> will be 
rested from the Australia side for Friday's fourth one-day international 
against England in Perth, with George Bailey to captain the side. Australian 
selectors have also decided to rest Shane Watson, Brad Haddin and David Warner.

While Clarke and Watson will return for the final game of the series on 26 
January, Haddin and Warner will also miss the Adelaide fixture.

On the back of their 5-0 Ashes victory, Clarke's side claimed the one-day 
series against England at the SCG on Sunday with a seven-wicket win that handed 
them an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five series.

Clarke revelled in another triumph for Australia after the game, but admitted 
to feeling tired after an arduous few months of cricket and said he was looking 
forward to some rest.

"I'm looking forward to spending a few days with my beautiful wife and not 
thinking about cricket at all," Clarke said. "It's been a long, tough summer 
and I'm looking forward to a break. It will be good to have four or five days 
away from cricket."

Bailey, who filled in as skipper in Australia's one-day side in India last 
year in Clarke's absence, takes on the captaincy in Perth as he returns from a 
groin injury that ruled him out of the SCG clash.

"He is in good hands, he has a few days to recover and he should be fine," 
Clarke said. "He has shown he is a good leader. He is experienced and I know 
they can go to Perth and have success."

Mitch Johnson has been appointed vice-captain for Perth.

Steve Smith has been named in the squad and is likely to replace Clarke in the 
middle order, while Matt Wade will replace Haddin.

National Selector John Inverarity said two players were likely to be released 
from the squad when Clarke and Watson returned after the Perth match.
