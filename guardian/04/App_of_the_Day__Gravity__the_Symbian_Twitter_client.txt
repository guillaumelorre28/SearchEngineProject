 Gravity, the Symbian Twitter client 
Gravity <http://mobileways.de/products/gravity/gravity/>

Price: Varies, but around Â£6.76

Store: Fastspring <http://mobileways.de/c/order/>

What it does: Full-featured Twitter client for Symbian S60 3rd and 5th edition 
smartphones.

Features: The range of Twitter functionality you'd expect - tweet, reply, 
direct message, retweet, follow and unfollow, profile view, block, search and 
the rest - and a stack of customisable features too. Messages auto-update, 
multiple accounts and audio alerts and tabbed browsing for search results, 
replies and DMs. There's also extensive support for other third-party tools 
like posting links to Delicious or Instapaper, image preview for services 
including Twitpic, YFrog and Posterous and support for post aggregator Ping.fm.

The good bits: Several PDA readers swear by this app. @solobasssteve 
<http://twitter.com/solobasssteve> says: "It has every Twitter function I could 
ever need, handles links and photos beautifully, multiple accounts integrate 
well, great UI. I often choose Gravity over using my laptop, even when I have 
both to hand." It also integrates with Facebook and Google Reader. Any danger 
of seeing that functionality on an iPhone Twitter app?

The bad bits: It's on the pricey side, but hard to better in this market. 

More: There are two options for themes, kinetic scrolling if you're using a 
Nokia 5800 or N97 and full-screen mode.
