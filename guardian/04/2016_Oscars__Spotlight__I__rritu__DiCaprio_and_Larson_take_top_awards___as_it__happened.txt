That’s it from us on the Oscars 2016

reaction to the awards, Lanre Bakare’s verdict on Chris Rock as host and a 
special extremely sleepy version of the Dailies podcast. Cheers for sticking

Meanwhile, in the non-bingo world, Nigel M Smith is still plugging away on 
backstage duties. He’s spoken to Sam Smith, who’s realised his suggestion that 
he was the first openly gay man to win an Oscar wasn’t quite correct:
Nigel M. Smith (@nigelmfs) 
Sam Smith on mistakenly saying he's the first openly gay #Oscar 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oscar?src=hash> winner: "Sh*t - f*ck that. Two’s 
my lucky number so it’s all good."
 <https://twitter.com/nigelmfs/status/704175664685944832> February 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/nigelmfs/status/704175664685944832> 
The first openly gay winner was Stephen Sondheim in 1991.

That’s it! BINGO! BINGO! Because we swear – in that inaudible garble at the 
end of the transmission – we heard Rock make a “Poo joke that got pegged to the 
Martian”. That means Simon from Hatton-on-Grange is this year’s Oscar BINGO! 
winner!

Congratulations Simon. Your prize will be in the post. Please make sure the 
box’s airholes remain open. Watch your hands when you open it! Thanks for 
playing all. It’s been a delight.

And with that, the 2016 Oscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> grind 
to a close. There will be considered reaction to the ceremony in due course, 
but not now and not by me, because I’m so tired that I can barely think and I’m 
pretty sure I just heard my baby waking up upstairs and oh god why won’t anyone 
let me sleep. Still, at least it’s over and I am smiley. Carol Smillie.

A quick word of thanks to The Guardian’s film desk, for helping to keep this 
ridiculous ship afloat tonight. And thanks, of course, to you for reading. You 
didn’t have to – and you probably shouldn’t have done – so I appreciate it 
greatly. Same time next year? Anyone?

There will be GIFs, any minute now, of the weird scrunched-face fistpump that 
Michael Keaton did on the way to the stage. But they can wait.Spotlight

And that just leaves us with best picture. Tonight dragged a bit in the 
middle, but this feels stirring enough to count as a big finish.

environment in his acceptance speech. You MUST have bingo by now Simon?

Leonardo DiCaprio <https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio> has 
clearly memorised the CRAP out of this speech, but god bless him. He’s thanking 
every single person he’s ever met. He’s literally attempting to solve climate 
change all by himself. He’s not being played off in the slightest. But, christ, 
if anyone deserves a bit of waffle tonight it’s him. Seriously, I think I just 
felt the entire internet exhale.

Easily the biggest cheer of the night for Leo. Which, again, is what you get

To contrast Brie Larson’s delight and good cheer, here’s “Twitter”; big, bad 
and furious because that limp ballad from Sam Smith beat that slightly less 
limp ballad from Lady Gaga to the best song prize. All this fury over an award 
whose past winners include ... Phil Collins, The Muppets and Randy Newman - 
many, many times.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/oscars-host-chris-rock-diversity-controversy> 
That’s it from us on the Oscars 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2016> liveblog. Check 
theguardian.com/film for all of our Oscars coverage, including Peter Bradshaw’s 
reaction to the awards, Lanre Bakare’s verdict on Chris Rock as host and a 
special extremely sleepy version of the Dailies podcast. Cheers for sticking 
with us. Go to bed now. We certainly are. Bye!
 
Meanwhile, in the non-bingo world, Nigel M Smith is still plugging away on 
backstage duties. He’s spoken to Sam Smith, who’s realised his suggestion that 
he was the first openly gay man to win an Oscar wasn’t quite correct:
Nigel M. Smith (@nigelmfs) 
Sam Smith on mistakenly saying he's the first openly gay #Oscar 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oscar?src=hash> winner: "Sh*t - f*ck that. Two’s 
my lucky number so it’s all good."
 <https://twitter.com/nigelmfs/status/704175664685944832> February 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/nigelmfs/status/704175664685944832> 
The first openly gay winner was Stephen Sondheim in 1991. 
 
That’s it! BINGO! BINGO! Because we swear – in that inaudible garble at the 
end of the transmission – we heard Rock make a “Poo joke that got pegged to the 
Martian”. That means Simon from Hatton-on-Grange is this year’s Oscar BINGO! 
winner!

Congratulations Simon. Your prize will be in the post. Please make sure the 
box’s airholes remain open. Watch your hands when you open it! Thanks for 
playing all. It’s been a delight.
 
And with that, the 2016 Oscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> grind 
to a close. There will be considered reaction to the ceremony in due course, 
but not now and not by me, because I’m so tired that I can barely think and I’m 
pretty sure I just heard my baby waking up upstairs and oh god why won’t anyone 
let me sleep. Still, at least it’s over and I am smiley. Carol Smillie.

A quick word of thanks to The Guardian’s film desk, for helping to keep this 
ridiculous ship afloat tonight. And thanks, of course, to you for reading. You 
didn’t have to – and you probably shouldn’t have done – so I appreciate it 
greatly. Same time next year? Anyone?
 
There will be GIFs, any minute now, of the weird scrunched-face fistpump that 
Michael Keaton did on the way to the stage. But they can wait.Spotlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight> won!
  Writer-directo Tom McCarthy is embraced by Michael Keaton as the actors and 
crew of Spotlight gather on stage to celebrate winning best picture.

abuse by the clergy wins the top prize.Read more

And that just leaves us with best picture. Tonight dragged a bit in the 
middle, but this feels stirring enough to count as a big finish.
 
That’s bingo Simon! That must be bingo! Leo’s given a shout out to the 
environment in his acceptance speech. You MUST have bingo by now Simon? 
Please?! PLEASE?!
 
Leonardo DiCaprio <https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio> has 
clearly memorised the CRAP out of this speech, but god bless him. He’s thanking 
every single person he’s ever met. He’s literally attempting to solve climate 
change all by himself. He’s not being played off in the slightest. But, christ, 
if anyone deserves a bit of waffle tonight it’s him. Seriously, I think I just 
felt the entire internet exhale.
 
Easily the biggest cheer of the night for Leo. Which, again, is what you get 
when you don’t run for president.
 
...One. Oh thank god.
