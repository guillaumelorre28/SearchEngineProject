The Guardian and Observer's iPad app has been named as the 'world's best 
designed iPad news app' by the Society for News Design.

Hundreds of sites from around the world were nominated by users and were 
reviewed by a panel of judges. Each winner required a unanimous vote.

Judges thought that the experience the app provided was "sublime," with each 
issue featuring "a jaw-dropping use of photography," as well as the use of 
simple tools to strike the perfect balance of identity, style and pacing.
