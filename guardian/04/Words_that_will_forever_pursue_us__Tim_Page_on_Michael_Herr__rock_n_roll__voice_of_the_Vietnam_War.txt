It’s a rare quality of friendship when you acquire an instant nickname for a 
new mate.

We were instantly “Nub” and “Plum”. Me Nub, for my mangled left index finger; 
Plum for Mike and his always slightly reddened face.

That was Mini Tet at the start of May ’68, when the media took heavy 
casualties – eight killed in a week, plus a dozen wounded. We had an instant, 
stoned, brotherly rapport. A communication in short syntax borrowing from each 
other’s drift. We understood the same madness, the noir and the glamour of it 
all. Mike had already survived Tet and Khe Sanh.

Mini Tet brought the band of brothers back to light. A hard core of 
photographers, writers and a few TV folks that were regulars in the field who 
understood the fear and the horror, yet who could still groove on its edge. 
Mike spoke of our voice in the argot of the epoch, its syntax and nuance, the 
lines that still haunts us to this day. The same lines that were etched into 
our consciousness fromApocalypse Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/apocalypse-now> and Full Metal Jacket.

Apart from the combat belt with obligatory water bottle, he packed little save 
for a small notebook into which occasional nuggets were scribbled. And a Zippo 
for the always reassuring doobie or ciggie.

Did we really traipse down that mountain through a minefield stoned, in the 
dark at Ba Xoai special forces camp? Blew the A-Team dudes away. Did we really 
attend a Cambo strikers wedding, clicks away, travelling back and forth in a 
3/4 tonner with hardly a weapon, the whole team pissed?

We chugged up the Perfume river atop a barge full of 155mm shells, clung to 
the side of a hovercraft. We goofed around at the war until the incoming made 
you as straight as needed.


As he said, “like snails on the edge of a razor blade”. The war only got 
wackier, even more deadly, and his little notes caught each shift in the 
nuances of the insanity. We wore the man’s green and yet we were able to mock 
it and see the mess from another point of view. It endeared you to the grunts 
and made officers nervous: the new voice of reason. But then he always had that 
compassionate rephrase for the victims: the Vietnamese themselves.

By ’69 we were all back in the Big Apple. Mike burnt out from the ’Nam, 
struggling to keep perspective on his writing. I was lying hemiplegic in a 
hospital on River Side East. A landmine had gone off three metres in front of 
me as I went to aid other mine victims. Ended up DOA, requiring nine hours of 
surgery to make life feasible. A long haul to recovery.

Somewhere in there, Plum appeared with a bound, hand-corrected, typed copy of 
Colleagues, the quintessential chapter from Dispatches that expands on the Band 
of Brothers, the Bao Chi, the mateship of the hardcore among the media.

As a piece in Esquire, it had been heralded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time-no-9-dispatches-michael-herr-vietnam-war-apocalypse-now>
 – and here was the original grail. It was like a shot of adrenaline, a big 
awakening, with more mentions of my fate than I could fess to. An arrow 
pointing to recovery, a certain acclaim and fame. The attention needed to 
stimulate the therapy of getting back to work, back to life.

Together we revisited Rock Is Hell for the now defunct Crawdaddy magazine, 
when we took to the heavy metal road with Aerosmith and then Ted Nugent, 
through the northeast states. The flame still flickered. In Detroit, Mike gave 
me the third copy of Dispatches that was ever printed.

A long story later, Dispatches launched as a theatrical piece, in the round at 
the Cottesloe in the National Theatre on London’s South Bank. We were all back 
in London, drawn by the play; the theatre was packed for 52 nights to rave 
reviews. It was beyond gonzo to sit through performances of our former traumas. 
Meantime, the BBC was filming a doco titled Mentioned in Dispatches and 
Apocalypse Now was in the cinemas; our newfound notoriety was talk of the town. 
My ship had new credibility sails.

We saw each other regularly, hanging and talking. South Kensington had good 
pubs and coffee. Valerie and baby Claudia – we would all go for Chelsea 
preambles. Enough old comrades were in country. The Dispatches oeuvre boosted 
me back to work, and a new platform. An exhibition, a return to Indochina and 
eventually myfirst tome 
<https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Pages-Nam-Page/dp/050054087X>. Mike only applauded 
– grinning each time the BBC replayed Mentioned in Dispatches, and when the 
book quickly sold 10,000 copies.

It was good that finally we were all making it, less troubled than before 
though still riddled with what I suspect now was PTSD – battling addictions and 
long moments of inexplicable torture.

I went back to the ’Nam, and Mike wrote the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick’s 
Full Metal Jacket. He once said to me over a pint, “It’s my only sin”. (The 
battle for Hue was filmed in a former gasworks, in what was then the derelict 
East London docklands).

He and the family left London back to the verdancy of Upstate New York, his 
roots a retreat to that sanity of Buddhism and the green. I moved to the Weald 
of Kent, only once getting close to Upstate forRequiem at the George Eastman 
house <https://www.eastman.org/product/requiem>. Mike was snowed in 100 miles 
away.

Without the platform he ascribed, that homage to our comrades in Requiem would 
never have come to pass. The synergy needed to keep the unfathomable spin a 
whirl would never have been generated.

His energy will forever pursue us in his awesome words.
