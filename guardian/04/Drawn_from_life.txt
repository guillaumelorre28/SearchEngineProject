When the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan, Norwegian journalist 
Asne Seierstad, who travelled with the Northern Alliance during the fighting, 
'happened upon an elegant, grey-haired man', Sultan Khan, the owner of a chain 
of bookstores.

His life's work had been to build a huge and rare archive which he had endured 
imprisonment and the threat of torture to protect. When Seierstad asked if she 
could write a book about his family, he readily agreed and she moved into his 
house in Kabul.

The result is thinly disguised as a work of fiction but listening to the 
arguments, marriage proposals and the grim reality of everyday life, it is 
clear that every conversation and piece of gossip is real.

Seierstad has created a colourful, accessible insight into Afghan life, while 
Emilia Fox breathes softness and beauty into a tale of oppression.
