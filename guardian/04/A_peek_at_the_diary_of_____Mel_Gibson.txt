Still I feel the steely disapproval of some of my fellow congregants at my 
heavily fortified Church of the Holy Family compound high in the Malibu, the LA 
beach-front community I famously own. Their judgment incenses me. Honestly, you 
spend $42m building them a private church; you let them deny the Pope; you fund 
every single one of their anti-gay marriage bake sales - and they take all 
that. But you knock up one hot Russian musician out of wedlock and it's all, 
"Blah blah Ten Commandments, blah blah never going to be saved, blah blah burn 
in bloody hellfire for all eternity."

Then it hit me. These ingrates have cast me out into a notional wilderness, 
and I'm being tested by my father. Not my earthly father - lovable old bigot 
that he is - but my heavenly one.

And you know what? I'm not going to give in to the temptation to go back to my 
dowdy wife and stick it out for the sake of our kids, my principles or 
whatever. Get thee behind me, people who don't think I ought to be having 
midlife crisis sex!

And the minute I had howled that, I was sent a sign. I found an obscure 
version of the Bible that hasn't been recognised since the Beverly Hills 
Council of 1601, in which Jesus falls in love with a very talented 
singer-songwriter and begins appearing on Nazarene red carpets with her. It's 
possibly the most romantic interlude in the history of humanity, and it's a 
story that deserves to be told - probably in Aramaic, and definitely on 
celluloid.
