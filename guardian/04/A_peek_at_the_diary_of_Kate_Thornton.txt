My wilderness years are over. I am to co-host Loose Women, the ITV daytime 
show in which four women sit around a table and cackle about willies for an 
hour in the slightly confusing, sixth-wave feminist belief that they're engaged 
in something to do with empowerment.

In your face, Cowell! This proves sacking me from The X Factor was a big 
mistake. For three series, I had brought something no one else can bring to 
that job: my personality. Which consists of putting my arm round a contestant 
and turning to the audience with the words, "Ooh, we love [contestant's name], 
don't we?"

But my agent was amazingly optimistic. He said, "Kate, from the moment you 
were editor of Smash Hits and told the Spice Girls to go away because you were 
too busy, just before the release of Wannabe, IÂ knew you had the right stuff. I 
knew it when you were a regular talking head on I Love 1982, even though you 
had been only nine at the time, and probably punctuated your false memories 
about deely boppers with lines like, 'Ooh, we love the Falklands war, don't 
we?' I can't explain it, Kate, but it's true: in 20 years, when human beings 
have become Earth's dispossessed, living down in her catacombs and forced to 
distil drinking water from their own urine, you will probably still be getting 
presenting work. In fact, your continued ability to get presenting work will 
actually have been one of the key harbingers of that apocalpyse."

Ooh, we love my agent, don't we?
