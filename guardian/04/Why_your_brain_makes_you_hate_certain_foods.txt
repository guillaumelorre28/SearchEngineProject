Mealtime is a common battleground in many families. Exasperated parents may be 
relieved to learn their children’s fussy eating might not be their fault. New 
research suggests picky eaters are just as likely to be influenced by their 
genes as environmental factors. But fussy children can grow into fussy adults – 
so if there’s one food you particularly despise, it’s worth thinking back to 
what might have caused this.

Young children have many more sweet tastebuds than adults to encourage them to 
drink milk and not eat bitter berries. Over time, tastebuds are ‘pruned’ to 
tolerate many new flavours. But a single bad experience can be enough to put 
someone off a food for life.

Violent vomiting after eating dodgy fish or a terrible tantrum before eating 
spinach can create an almost permanent connection in the brain between the food 
and a strong adverse reaction to it. The psychologistMartin Seligman

, who tested this theory on rats, called it ‘sauce-béarnaise syndrome’ after 
his own bad experience with a gone-off French dish.

Time to stop nagging the kids to eat spinach or brussels sprouts, perhaps.
