The Sony Radio Academy Awards might have a tiny bit more kudos than their 
commercial-only counterparts, theArqiva Commercial Radio Awards. But the Sonys 
can't compete with the Arqiva gongs' special live act â€“ it's A-Ha! The 
Norwegian popsters will play in front of 600 radio types at the awards in 
London's Royal Lancaster Hotel on 5 June, with hits includingThe Sun Always 
Shines on Radio <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYeFWmc21Fc>, Take on Global 
Radio's Debt <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AXNBR2smPY>, and, er... Hunting 
High and Low for a Decent DAB Radio Signal 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCNkfP3KzM>. Sad to say it will be Absolute 
Radio's Christian O'Connell hosting the event, notAlan Partridge 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srA862GJ2JI>, who could of course introduce 
them with a huge "A-ha!".
