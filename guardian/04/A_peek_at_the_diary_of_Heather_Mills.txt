I'm back – and this time it's veganism. It's actually been my mission all 
along, but the press don't want people to know about that.

As I keep saying about my new cafe, literally anyone can be vegan. Even though 
I don't like to talk about it too often, I used to live rough under Waterloo 
Bridge when I was younger. I kipped in a box with all the tramps, and I was the 
Tinkerbell to their Lost Boys. But I would make them these delicious vegan 
dinners from stuff we'd forage, and we'd sit around and talk about nutrition 
and literature, and how we were going to change the world. Like everything in 
life, homelessness is what you make it. I chose to make a success of it.

Of course, all the Lost Boys cried when I left to become a successful aid 
worker – or was it a journalist? What did I say last time? Anyway, I still go 
back and visit them under the bridge and it's just like old times. They're 
amazing, they phone me and say, "Tink, can you bring us some of those vegan 
cupcakes?" and I say, "Absolutely, no bother." I don't forget my roots.

Meanwhile, I did my first tweet about one of my customer's "poop" last week, 
before pointing out that we are much more than what we eat. Watch out, Gillian 
McKeith! I'm kidding. In this next phase of my life, I know me and Gillian are 
going to be the friendliest of rivals. It's one of those battles where it's 
just a shame there has to be a loser.
