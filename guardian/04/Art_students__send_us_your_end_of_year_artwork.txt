As the French artist Edgar Degas once said: “Art is not what you see, but what 
you make others see.” And what better way to make people see things than to 
share your art with the Guardian.

Students Express 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/series/students-express> is a way for 
students to send us their work through platforms including GuardianWitness, 
Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. This month, we’re asking you to submit your 
end-of-year artwork. At the end of June, we’ll compile our favourites into a 
gallery.

Whatever your medium, we want to see the culmination of your creative 
endeavours this academic year: whether you prefer to paint, draw, photograph, 
sculpt - or maybe something more unusual that we haven’t thought of.

The deadline for submissions is midnight on Tuesday 28 June 2016.
