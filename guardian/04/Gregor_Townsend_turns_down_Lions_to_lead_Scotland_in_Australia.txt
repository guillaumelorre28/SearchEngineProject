The Australia tour will be the Glasgow coach’s first chance to work with his 
full squad after he takes over from Vern Cotter.

Quoted on the Scottish Rugby Union website, Townsend said: “It’s a case of 
timing. I feel hugely privileged to be given the Scotland job and our first 
opportunity to work with the players is at the same time as the Lions tour. I 
was approached a couple of weeks ago – and I was obviously flattered – but my 
priority now is Glasgow, and at the end of the season Scotland are going on 
tour, so that’s the priority then.

“I had a good think and didn’t give an immediate answer. I really wanted to 
reflect on what was involved but I quickly realised the Scotland tour to 
Australia is my No1 priority at the end of this season.

“At international level you don’t get that much access with the players. This 
is the most access you’ll get with them. On a tour you get to work with them, 
preparing them and spending time with them, so that’s the biggest factor.”
