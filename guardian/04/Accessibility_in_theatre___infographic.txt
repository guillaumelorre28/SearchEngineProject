We at Purple Seven <http://www.purpleseven.co.uk/> work with more than 200 
theatres nationally to increase attendance and accessibility. Our company 
provides a free email survey tool for theatre companies and venues to gather 
feedback on shows, as well as demographics and disability info.

Recent research we carried out shows that the number of disabled people 
engaging with theatre is increasing, at least in the theatres with which we 
work. According to our study, the number of audience members with a disability 
has increased to 7% from 5% three years ago.

Our study looked at results from more than 45,000 tickets across 6,500 
productions between January 2012 and July 2015. You can see some of the stats 
in the infographic below.
