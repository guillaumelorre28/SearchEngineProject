This book oversteps the boundaries of "really good" and crosses into the 
section marked "favourites". Written in the point of view of 10-year-old Jamie, 
the language is easy enough to understand, but the subtext and subject of the 
book is quite adult.

The book starts with Jamie talking about his dead sister, killed by a 
terrorist attack, and how his family view her – as still living. When his mum 
walks out on him, his dad and remaining sister, his dad turns to alcohol, and 
they move to the Lake District for a new start. But the only person at school 
who doesn't bully him is Sunya, and she's Muslim. Jamie has been brought up 
with the belief that Muslims are bad, and he never argued – after all, some of 
them killed his sister – but Sunya is different; they can be superheroes 
together.

Annabel Pitcher <https://www.theguardian.com/books/annabel-pitcher> cleverly 
balances the underlying themes of bullying, racism, depression, and alcoholism 
with the excitement of forbidden friendship, hope, and ultimately the strength 
to move on. The result is an amazing book; one you won't be able to put down 
because you wish so much that Jamie will be okay.
