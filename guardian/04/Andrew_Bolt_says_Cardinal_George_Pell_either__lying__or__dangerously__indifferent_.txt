News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, a staunch defender of Cardinal George Pell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-pell>, has declared the 
Catholic cleric’s evidence at the royal commission on Tuesday “disastrous” and 
the case against him “very damning”.

In a dramatic reversal of his consistent defence of Pell, the Herald Sun 
commentator now says the Vatican’s finance chief was either lying or 
“dangerously indifferent” to the fact children were being raped.

On Tuesday afternoon Bolt stunned viewers when he told Sky News Australia that 
he had just witnessed Pell’s cross-examination in the hearing room in Rome and 
it was “terrible” and his image was forever damaged.

Under cross-examination by Gail Furness SC, counsel assisting the royal 
commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse,Pell said he 
hadn’t asked about Gerald

: “It was a sad story and of not much interest to me. I had no reason to turn 
my mind to the evils Ridsdale had perpetrated.”

Outside the hearing room in Rome where Bolt is reporting for Sky News he said: 
“Those words about the Ridsdale case – where George Pell said that it was a sad 
story but it was not of interest to me – I just think those will be hung around 
his neck for the rest of his career.

“Whether or not he directly knew – and the case against him is circumstantial 
– did he actually do what was necessary for any moral person and pursue the 
interests of the children being abused? And on that ground I think the case 
against him is very damning.”

Sky News contributor Andrew Bolt's take on Cardinal Pell's testimony today.

It was an about-face from his earlier comments on Sky when he said: “One would 
hope that this inquiry can go forward in the spirit of actually finding the 
truth, not being a witch hunt and perhaps giving George Pell more benefit of 
the doubt than a lot of media has given him.”

Last month Bolt wrote that Pell was the victim “of one of the most vicious 
witch hunts to disgrace this country. 
<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/andrew-bolt/cardinal-george-pell-is-the-victim-of-a-vicious-witch-hunt/news-story/29e8036f329dfee742adf48949ed8743>
 It is shameful. Disgusting. Frightening”.

“People pretending to be moral have competed with each other to slime Pell as 
the defender of paedophiles, if not a paedophile himself.”

But witnessing Pell’s testimony first-hand profoundly changed Bolt’s previous 
view of the cardinal as a victim of the media and later on Tuesday evening he 
reiterated his response, telling Steve Price on 2GB that it was “a shocker” and 
it appeared the royal commission didn’t believe Pell’s evidence.

“I think it’s a disaster I really do,” Bolt told Price 
<http://webstore.2gb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/nights-with-steve-price/201603/01-steve-price-and-andrew-bolt-tues.mp3>
. “I thought it was awful and in once sense it was so awful because it fit into 
the narrative but it also seems to confirm a pattern … that he hadn’t picked up 
hints.

“Either he is lying when he said he never knew ... was never told or that he 
wasn’t diligent in following up the kind of clues that were picked up by a 
number of other people.”

Bolt continued his theme in his Herald Sun column on Wednesday morning, 
writing that Pell’s words would “stain his reputation forever”.

 “Here is the question now for the royal commission into sex abuse of 
children: is the Vatican’s third-most powerful leader a liar when he says he 
never knew what Ridsdale, his colleague, was doing in Ballarat?”Bolt wrote

.

 “Or was he just dangerously indifferent to his responsibilities and to the 
warning signs that children were being raped?

“But the devastating admission drawn from Pell by Gail Furness SC, counsel 
assisting the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual 
abuse, was that he never bothered to ask.

“Now a royal commission seems poised to consider whether this prince of the 
Catholic church is a liar.”

However, Bolt now seems to be clawing back some of his harshest criticism. 
Appearing on Sky on Wednesday morning Bolt said it was an exaggeration to 
interpret Pell’s evidence as proof that he didn’t care about children; and he 
explained what he thought Pell “meant to say”.

“For the first time in my life I am trending positive on Twitter and you know 
what I feel embarrassed because I think I’ve joined the pack attacking Pell,” 
Bolt said.

“What he [Pell] seems to have said, meant to say, was that he had no reason to 
look at what was happening in that parish of Inglewood by Gerard Ridsdale and 
as a result, those things slipped his mind.”

According to 2GB’s Price, Bolt has secured “an exclusive, one-on-one interview 
with Cardinal Pell” which will air on Friday morning on 2GB and Sky News.
