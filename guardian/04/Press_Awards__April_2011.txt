The Guardian has been named newspaper of the year at the 2011 Press Awards 
<http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=Judges-Awards> for its 
partnership with WikiLeaks, which produced the leaked US embassy cables.

The judges said the story put 'the Guardian at the top of the news headlines 
and some say it will change relationships between governments and the press and 
public forever'.

The paper also triumphed in a further three categories: Andrew Sparrow was 
named political journalist of the year, Amelia Gentleman was awarded best 
features writer, and the Guardian's 2010 World Cup Guide came top as special 
supplement.

Adam Gabbatt was also highly commended in the young journalist of the year 
category.
