Job: founder and chairman, Brunswick Group
Age: 57
Industry: public relations
2012 ranking: 63

Alan Parker <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-parker> has been a fixture 
of the MediaGuardian 100 since it first appeared in 2001. "As with any great PR 
man, Alan Parker's influence far outweighs his visibility," we said then. We 
still do.

Brunswick, the City PR firm that he founded 26 years ago, represents about a 
quarter of the companies in the FTSE 100. Dubbed the godfather of modern 
financial public relations, Parker's firm straddles politics, big business and 
the media.

Son of the late Sir Peter Parker, former head of British Rail, the Brunswick 
chairman is close to both Labour and the Conservatives (he holidays with David 
Cameron, who was a guest at his wedding) straddling the two political camps 
like few others.

"Since the financial crisis, the rules of engagement have changed," he warned 
<http://www.brunswickgroup.com/files/html/brunswickreviewIssue7/index.html>. 
"Many companies have found that they must deal with a far more intense level of 
scrutiny from politicians and regulators, who are pursuing their own agendas. 
Companies also have to navigate a more complex and hostile public terrain."

You know who to call.
