Ebrahim Raisi is the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, the wealthiest charity in 
the Muslim world and the organisation in charge of Iran’s holiest shrine. It is 
believed he is being groomed to be a leading candidate to succeed 77-year-old
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei>.

Khamenei’s tenure, which has spanned more than a quarter-century, will end 
only with his death; butthe sudden death on Sunday of Ayatollah Hashemi 
Rafsanjani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/iran-former-president-rafsanjani-dies-aged-82>
, the country’s greatest political survivor, has revived speculation about the 
succession. In 2014, Khamenei, the country’s ultimate decision-maker and its 
commander-in-chief, was announced to have undergone prostate surgery, which 
broke a taboo on the topic.

Rafsanjani, who will be buried on Tuesday, was a major political force in Iran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran>. Although his influence had diminished 
in recent years as he shifted his political allegiance to reformists, he was 
still considered to have influence in pushing for a more moderate candidate to 
succeed Khamenei.

 Sadeq Larijani. 
Rafsanjani revealed in a newspaper interview in June that two people had been 
shortlisted by the assembly of experts, the clerical body in charge of choosing 
the next supreme leader, although there has been no official confirmation.

 Hashemi Shahroudi. 
Three others touted are ayatollahs Hashemi Shahroudi and Sadeq Larijani, the 
former and current judiciary chiefs, and the current president, Hassan Rouhani. 
Raisi is closer to Khamenei’s inner circle but has comparatively little 
executive experience.


Raisi’s rise in prominence since his appointment in March has surprised many 
political commentators. He wears a black turban, indicating he is aseyed – a 
descendant of the prophet Muhammad, in ShiaIslam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam>. Mohsen Kadivar, who has taught at 
Qom seminary, Iran’s most prominent Shia religious hub, said this fact alone 
increases his chances of gaining the top job by 30 to 40%. Ayatollah Shahroudi 
is also aseyed. 


Hossein Rassam, a former Iran adviser to the British Foreign Office, said 
Raisi’s current role is a strong platform for his leadership chances. “He is 
the guardian for a shrine that is the destination of millions of Shia pilgrims 
every year and I think that is extremely important,” Rassam said. Nearly 30 
million pilgrims are estimated to visit Imam Reza each year.


“He has also very close links to key players in the Islamic Republic [of 
Iran], from the supreme leader himself to the revolutionary guards. All the 
signs suggest … his chances of becoming the next supreme leader are growing 
very fast.”

Raisi had barely reached adulthood by the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but rose 
quickly through the ranks. In the summer of 1988, he was one of the four sharia 
judgesbehind the mass execution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/aug/11/hossein-ali-montazeri-audio-file-calls-for-inquiry-1988-massacre-iran-political-prisoners>
 of leftists and dissidents.


More recently he was Iran’s prosecutor-general and still holds a very 
important division within the judiciary as the head of the court that 
prosecutes troublemaking clerics. He is married to the daughter of a hardline 
ayatollah who is the representative of Khamenei in the eastern province of 
Khorasan-Razavi, home to the Imam Reza shrine.

Rassam said Raisi is also advantaged by Shahroudi and Larijani’s involvement 
in corruption cases, and the distance he has kept from Iran’s factional 
infighting. His role in the mass execution of political dissidents in the 1980s 
is unlikely to damage his standing, Rassam said, while pictures that emerged of 
senior military commanders symbolically sitting at his feet during a visit to 
Raisi in Mashhad underlined his authority.

Morteza Kazemian, a prominent political activist living in exile in Paris, 
said Raisi’s relations with the Revolutionary Guards, intelligence agencies and 
Khamenei’s inner circle – including his son Mojtaba – made him the frontrunner 
to be the next supreme leader.

“Raisi’s chances are high, but what will happen the day Khamenei dies rests 
much on the political balance at that exact moment,” he said.

Kadivar, who is currently a research professor at Duke University, stuck a 
more cautious note. Although he sees Raisi as a potential candidate, he 
believes there are not sufficient signs to consider him the frontrunner. 
“Khamenei’s authority is effective so long as he is alive but once he dies, all 
political allegiances may shift, which makes all the talk about potential 
candidates very speculative,” he warned.

“Rouhani’s chances are much bigger than the others. He has the experience, the 
Islamic knowledge and credibility among the elites.”

Kadivar, a strong critic of Islamic jurisprudence, believes there are signs 
that Khamenei wants to make constitutional changes to abolish the position of 
president, or make it symbolic and reinstate the role of prime minister. 
“Presidents in Iran have proved too troublesome for the supreme leader, while 
the parliament has usually acted within the red lines. A prime minister 
appointed by such a parliament would alleviate the leader’s concerns,” Kadivar 
said.

Another theory is that Khamenei could limit the term of the top job to 10 
years, making the next supreme leader less supreme. And while many believe 
Khamenei’s character means he will want to choose his own successor, Rassam 
thinks the ayatollah will leave the decision to his confidantes and the 
assembly of experts will simply rubber-stamp the appointment.

And in Iran’s current climate, Raisi has “a very high chance of becoming the 
next supreme leader”, Rassam says.
