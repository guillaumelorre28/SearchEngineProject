Cheryl Cole's debut solo effort is on course to become the fastest-selling 
single of 2009, just a week after the record was broken by X factor winner
Alexandra Burke <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke>. Fight for 
This Love has already sold more on its first day (19 October) than Burke's Bad 
Boys did last week. Cole's single was performed during X Factor last Sunday (18 
October), a year after the Girls Aloud singer mentored Burke to victory on the 
same show.

A spokesman for the Official Charts Company confirmed that Cole was on course 
to smash Burke's record of 185,000 copies sold in a week. "This will be the 
second successive week of massive single sales, led by Cheryl," said Martin 
Talbot. "Her first day's sales are just amazing and put her in pole position to 
top the charts on Sunday. Together with Alexandra Burke, she is likely to set 
the sales standard by which everyone will be judged for the rest of the year, 
in the run-up to Christmas."

Cole joined Girls Aloud after winning a place on Popstars: The Rivals in 2002. 
The five-piece have since gone on to win numerous awards and are regularly 
touted as Britain's biggest girl group, having reportedly amassed a joint 
fortune of Â£25m. Cole overcame controversy in 2003 when she was convicted of 
assaulting a toilet attendant in a Guildford nightclub and has since won over 
the public as a guest judge onThe X Factor

Fight for You Love is taken from Cole's debut solo album, 3 Word, which is out 
next Monday (26 October).
