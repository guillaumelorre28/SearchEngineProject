Arsène Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger> was heavily 
critical of Arsenal’s defensive performance and his team’s mentality, accusing 
them of complacency, after he watched them throw away a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 
against Anderlecht.

The result meant that Arsenal are unlikely to advance to the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> last 16 as group 
winners, and stands to give them a more difficult draw in the first knockout 
round. Arsenal have exited the competition at the last-16 stage in each of the 
previous four seasons following difficult draws.

But Wenger, who stormed straight down the tunnel at full-time, did not look 
beyond the looseness that had undermined his team for the 90 minutes at the 
Emirates. The game ought to have over when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored 
Arsenal’s third on 58 minutes. ButArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> switched off and it was not 
entirely surprising when the substitute, Aleksander Mitrovic, headed the 
equaliser in the 90th minute.

“At 3-0, we thought the job was done,” Wenger said. “It was fatigue, as well. 
They finished stronger and sharper. We got punished. Maybe, we subconsciously 
underestimatedAnderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> and 
we got punished. In the Champions League you need to be at the right mental 
level or you get punished. Certainly, we were not. Subconsciously, you can 
think the game is won.”

 The Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger says he is very disappointed with his team’s 
3-3 draw 
Wenger was scathing about the defensive performance, although he disagreed 
with the accusation that his team had been too open as they continued to press 
for goals. Besnik Hasi, the Anderlecht manager, said that Arsenal had “tried to 
play the same way” and “didn’t just sit back [at 3-0]”.

“We dropped off too much and we didn’t go into the challenges any more,” 
Wenger said. “Then, you are always open. We didn’t stop the crosses, the long 
balls. In the second half, it was bad defending more than being out-numbered.

“We gave a poor defensive performance from the first to the last. We never 
felt comfortable. There was a bit of bad luck because the first [Anderlecht] 
goal was offside but our defensive performance was not good enough. Across the 
pitch defensively, we were very, very poor.”

Wenger lost Mikel Arteta to a hamstring injury after 62 minutes and the 
manager was unable to say how serious the problem was. It is the latest 
muscular problem to affect the defensive midfielder and he is primed to undergo 
scans. “When we lost Arteta we lost a bit today,” Wenger said. “He was one of 
the few who defended well.”

Arteta said: “It is just not good enough. We have thrown everything away 
today. Even after conceding the first goal we still had a two-goal lead. It has 
blown our chances of winning the group and that is the main aim at the start of 
the competition.”
