African Barrick Gold has run into trouble at another one of its Tanzanian 
mines following an earlier power failure at its Buzwagi site.

It has just announced that its north Mara mine was attacked yesterday by a 
group of 800 intruders, who attempted to remove ore from the site. The 
Tanzanian police were called and were set upon by the intruders armed with 
machetes, rocks and hammers.

In the ensuing fracas, several intruders suffered gunshot wounds, with seven 
fatalities and twelve injuries. An investigation by both the police and the 
company is underway, and there is now additional security at the mine.

African Barrick said it sincerely regretted any loss of life or injury:

The company will continue to support the government and the community in their 
efforts to improve law and order and security in the north Mara region.

The attack comes just a day after the company announced the power outage at 
Buzwagi, which it said would take two weeks to resolve, given the need to 
replace one of the motors. It said the problem would cause a loss of production 
of around 10,000 ounces of gold in the current quarter but this should be 
recovered in the second half of the year. Analysts at FoxDavies said:

The company believes that the loss of production will be recouped in the 
second half of the year. This will be achieved through bring forward essential 
maintenance and so avoiding downtime in the second half. Further, higher grade 
ore will be processed in the second half. It is hoped that these measures will 
minimise the loss of production.

But as we commented in our note on the first quarter's production, the company 
is already behind the production schedule necessary for it to achieve guidance 
and this latest problem is only going to make things more difficult.

African Barrick's shares are down 18.6p at 479p, making it the biggest faller 
in the FTSE 250 at the moment.
