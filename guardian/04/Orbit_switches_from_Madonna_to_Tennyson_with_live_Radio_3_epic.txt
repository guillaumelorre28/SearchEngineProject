William Orbit, the Grammy award-winning producer and composer who collaborated 
on hit albums with Blur and Madonna, is to give a live performance of his new 
setting of Alfred Lord Tennyson's epic poem In Memoriam on BBCRadio 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-3> on Friday night.

Orbit said he hopes to create more settings for classic literature, and one 
day to write an opera. "I love poetry, lyrics of course, but the spoken word in 
particular," he said.

The 52-year-old Briton, who left school at 16 and now lives in Los Angeles and 
London, is a keen fan of Victorian writing and often carries Tennyson's Morte 
D'Arthur or the poetic works of Thomas Hardy with him on long flights. "I love 
the complete lack of cynicism in that era," he said.

Orbit's work on Madonna's 1998 Ray of Light album helped it sell more than 16 
million copies worldwide, but he said he was apprehensive about the live 
broadcast on Friday. "I have never done something in a theatre like this."

His setting of Tennyson's epic, which was written to commemorate the poet's 
great friend Arthur Henry Hallam, was commissioned for The Verb, theRadio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 3 show that celebrates poetry, new 
writing and performance.
