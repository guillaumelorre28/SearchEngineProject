 The leader of the militant Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun sought to distance his 
organisation last night from claims that a member had called for the 
assassination of Tony Blair to avenge the bombing of Afghanistan.
Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad, the group's founder, denied a spokesman in Lahore 
had made the comments to French news agency AFP.

Abdul Rehman Saleem reportedly said: "What it means is that if any Muslim 
wants to assassinate him, wants to get rid of him, I am not going to shed any 
tears for him, and from the Islamic point of view this person is not going to 
be chastised... this person will be praised."

Mr Bakri said no member of his group would call for the assassination of Mr 
Blair as it goes against Islam's teachings.

He said: "Mr Saleem did not call for the assassination of anyone. He is 
prohibited from doing this by the teachings of Islam. I talked to him in Lahore 
and he has completely condemned this."

The reports come as a leading Muslim group warned that the bombing of 
Afghanistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> would widen the 
gulf between the west and the Muslim world.

The Muslim Council of Britain said it feared western military action was 
threatening to "spiral out of control".
