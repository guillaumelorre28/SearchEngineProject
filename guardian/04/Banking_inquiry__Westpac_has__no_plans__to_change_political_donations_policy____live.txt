Conclusion of bank hearings and questions remain over tribunal proposal

So concludes three days of hearings into the four big banks. It’s possible the 
Coalition-controlled committee will ask bank executives to return. Labor has 
demanded further hearings but will demand a royal commission either way.

Here’s what we learned in the afternoon session on Westpac:

 * Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, revealed bank bosses spoke to the 
treasurer about a tribunal to regulate banks in April or May, but the function 
and powers of the proposed body are unclear 
 * Westpac has “no plans” to change its donations policy, which allows it to 
buy seats at fundraisers but not to give cash to political parties 
 * The chief executive said the concept of “passing on” an RBA cash rate 
reductions is “essentially an inaccurate statement” because banks get funds 
from many other sources 
 * The Westpac boss apologised for “operational errors” and the “trust gap” 
with consumers 
 * Hartzer said that in the past six years 22 financial planners have been 
referred to Asic and all of them are no longer at the bank after being sacked 
or resigning. 
Further in the bowels of the blog I wrote a summary of the morning’s hearing 
with NAB executives

.


My colleague Gareth Hutchens wrote a report that NAB’s chief executive, Andrew 
Thorburn, faced more aggressive and disciplined questioning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/bank-inquiry-nab-chief-faces-grilling-and-says-mistakes-not-systemic>
 but refused to describe the sacking of 43 financial planners as a “systemic” 
issue.

These past three days have been my first spin on the live blog. I’ve lost my 
B-plates. Thanks for joining us.

Westpac evidence reveals lack of clarity on bank tribunal proposal

The main take-away from the afternoon session wasn’t about Westpac at all, but 
rather the lack of clarity around the proposed bank tribunal.

The idea originated in a report in May from a Senate committee inquiry into 
customer loans that recommended 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/customer_loans/Report/b02>
 the banking industry be required to fund a tribunal if financial institutions 
did not appoint independent experts to consider restitution for customers who 
feel they have been ripped-off.

Liberal MP Warren Entsch latched on to the idea as an alternative to a royal 
commission, arguingthe tribunal should be able to grant victims compensation 
for bank scandals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/02/bank-royal-commission-labor-to-use-tight-election-result-to-push-policies>
.

In her questioning this afternoon Liberal MP Julia Banks suggested the 
tribunal would be “under the auspices of Asic” and have “strong interventionist 
powers” to set benchmarks on sales, and mandate ethics and unconscious bias 
training. Not a word on compensation, but all kinds of other regulatory powers.

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, revealed the heads of the banks had 
discussed the tribunal with the treasurer in April or May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/06/banking-inquiry-nab-and-westpac-bosses-face-questions-as-focus-turns-to-donations-live?page=with:block-57f5cdd2e4b0e2a2a25af70c#block-57f5cdd2e4b0e2a2a25af70c>
, before the election, then added it had been discussed only “in passing”.

I’ve never had a long conversation about the tribunal. I’m not really aware of 
the details of what is recommended.


Hartzer said he didn’t want more prescriptive regulation but supported the 
idea if it was the last step in the complaints framework:

There may be occasions that people say they’re still not happy. It’s entirely 
appropriate to look at that appeal framework. I don’t have a strong view about 
whether that’s a tribunal or something else.

Brian Hartzer has clarified his earlier comment that a bank tribunal was 
discussed in a meeting in April or May with the treasurer, by adding the 
tribunal was mentioned only “in passing”.

Labor’s Matt Thistlethwaite asks about whether “avoiding a royal commission” 
was also discussed.

Hartzer said Westpac accepts whatever regulatory response the government 
chooses but would prefer to make changes now rather than wait for a royal 
commission and then make change. He said that was the essence of what he 
advised the treasurer.

Westpac over alleged manipulation of the bank bill swap rate and what review it

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, said there was an external

The conclusion of our investigation is that our people have not done anything 
wrong, and that’s why we’re defending that matter in court.

Liberal MP Trevor Evans asks about small business lending rates and whether 
they will remain high.

Brian Hartzer blames increased funding costs relative to the cash rate, 
requirements to hold more capital for small business loans, and the need to 
“price risk through the cycle”.

When you look at small business lending over time, those loans are more likely 
to go bad, [and] you lose more when they go bad.

Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has given a spiel against the deposit guarantee 
offered by Labor for the second time today.

He argues it cost big banks 70 basis points to buy into the guarantee compared 
with 150 for smaller banks, although asthe scheme’s official page makes clear 
<http://www.guaranteescheme.gov.au/qa/deposits.html> that’s because big banks 
have a better credit rating.

MP Craig Kelly has asked if a consumer with $500 of credit card debt misses a 
$25 minimum monthly repayment, how much they will be charged? $9. He then wants 
to know how much the lateness actually costs the bank, and the Westpac execs 
take it on notice.

Hartzer says the bank has “no plans” to increase its fees now ANZ has won a 
high court case in defence of a $35 late payment fee.

Kelly wants to know how high fees could go if $35 isn’t an unlawful penalty. 
Hartzer said it’s a “hypothetical” because Westpac had decreased its fee to $9.

Adam Bandt has asked about a couple who banked with Westpac for more than 20 
years and had an inflated income in a loan application.

The chief executive, Brian Hartzer, said he could not go into detail but 
denied the bank was responsible for inflating their income.

We have no incentive and no desire to lend people more than they can afford.

Asked to rule out anyone else’s incomes being altered or inflated, Hartzer 
said: “I can’t say it’s never happened, but not to my knowledge.”

"No plans" by Westpac to change political donations policy

Greens MP Adam Bandt has asked about $1.8m in donations in recent years by 
Westpac to the Labor and Liberal parties.

Hartzer said its policy is “open and transparent”. 

We don’t give cash donations to political parties. We support political 
parties and the political process by attending conferences and the like. We 
disclose everything we donate fully to the [Australian Electoral Commission].

Asked about NAB’s answer that it wanted to avoid the perception of a conflict 
by stopping donations, Hartzer said it had “no plans” to change its donations 
policy.

practically possible to assess individual risk for each business customer.

He accepts Westpac could reduce credit card interest rates and still be 
profitable.

Brian Hartzer has come up with the magic number of what an ATM transaction 
costs: 20 cents. He doesn’t have to hand a figure for how much a transaction by 
a customer from another bank costs.

He said Westpac absorbed the cost of the ATM network for its customers, which 
explained why only customers of other banks pay a fee. The foreign fee “defrays 
the cost but comes nowhere near” paying for the whole network.

It’s a “reasonable assumption” that the fee is higher than the marginal cost 
of the transaction by customers of other banks, Hartzer said.

Matt Keogh has returned to asking about the UK’s new laws requiring individual 
accountability of executives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/fca-new-uk-banking-regulations-tracey-mcdermott>
. He suggests senior managers are responsible for training and systems around 
incorrect financial advice, not just the financial planners who give it.

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, says risk is inherent in investing, 
and laws punishing innovation can have “unintended consequences”.

When they’ve been poorly advised, absolutely there should be consequences. But 
if people feel you can’t take risk because you’ll blame me and I’ll get a 
criminal penalty, a normal person would be much more reticent to give advice.

Labor’s Matt Keogh has gone on the attack claiming no part of the $2.7m 
short-term incentive Brian Hartzer is paid is for “customer satisfaction”.

Hartzer said a net promoters’ score (customers’ willingness to recommend a 
product to others) is 10% of his score card and a number of other measures are 
about becoming a more service-oriented organisation such as technological 
innovation and people and culture.

Treasurer consulted banks on tribunal before election

MP Matt Keogh has asked about consultation on a banking tribunal and when the 
idea was first raised.

Hartzer said there was a meeting in April or May with the heads of the banks 
and the treasurer about resolution of complaints and the tribunal was raised 
there.

I’ve never had a long conversation about the tribunal. I’m not really aware of 
the details of what is recommended.

He supported consideration of gaps in accountability and improving the 
consumer complaints processes.

Brian Hartzer said Westpac had unconscious bias training for the top four 
layers of its management and would “continue to look at everything we can from 
the customer interface point of view to make sure women are very welcome”.

MP Julia Banks suggests the tribunal could mandate ethics and unconscious bias 
training to “provide benefits to consumers ... and ensure all employees across 
the bank are appropriately trained”.

Hartzer has concerns with “more prescriptive regulation”.

The more you prescribe what the bank does the more there are unintended 
consequences that have to be thought through carefully.

So concludes three days of hearings into the four big banks. It’s possible the 
Coalition-controlled committee will ask bank executives to return. Labor has 
demanded further hearings but will demand a royal commission either way.

Here’s what we learned in the afternoon session on Westpac:

 * Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, revealed bank bosses spoke to the 
treasurer about a tribunal to regulate banks in April or May, but the function 
and powers of the proposed body are unclear 
 * Westpac has “no plans” to change its donations policy, which allows it to 
buy seats at fundraisers but not to give cash to political parties 
 * The chief executive said the concept of “passing on” an RBA cash rate 
reductions is “essentially an inaccurate statement” because banks get funds 
from many other sources 
 * The Westpac boss apologised for “operational errors” and the “trust gap” 
with consumers 
 * Hartzer said that in the past six years 22 financial planners have been 
referred to Asic and all of them are no longer at the bank after being sacked 
or resigning. 
Further in the bowels of the blog I wrote a summary of the morning’s hearing 
with NAB executives

.


My colleague Gareth Hutchens wrote a report that NAB’s chief executive, Andrew 
Thorburn, faced more aggressive and disciplined questioning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/bank-inquiry-nab-chief-faces-grilling-and-says-mistakes-not-systemic>
 but refused to describe the sacking of 43 financial planners as a “systemic” 
issue.

These past three days have been my first spin on the live blog. I’ve lost my 
B-plates. Thanks for joining us.
 
The main take-away from the afternoon session wasn’t about Westpac at all, but 
rather the lack of clarity around the proposed bank tribunal.

The idea originated in a report in May from a Senate committee inquiry into 
customer loans that recommended 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/customer_loans/Report/b02>
 the banking industry be required to fund a tribunal if financial institutions 
did not appoint independent experts to consider restitution for customers who 
feel they have been ripped-off.

Liberal MP Warren Entsch latched on to the idea as an alternative to a royal 
commission, arguingthe tribunal should be able to grant victims compensation 
for bank scandals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/02/bank-royal-commission-labor-to-use-tight-election-result-to-push-policies>
.

In her questioning this afternoon Liberal MP Julia Banks suggested the 
tribunal would be “under the auspices of Asic” and have “strong interventionist 
powers” to set benchmarks on sales, and mandate ethics and unconscious bias 
training. Not a word on compensation, but all kinds of other regulatory powers.

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, revealed the heads of the banks had 
discussed the tribunal with the treasurer in April or May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/06/banking-inquiry-nab-and-westpac-bosses-face-questions-as-focus-turns-to-donations-live?page=with:block-57f5cdd2e4b0e2a2a25af70c#block-57f5cdd2e4b0e2a2a25af70c>
, before the election, then added it had been discussed only “in passing”.

I’ve never had a long conversation about the tribunal. I’m not really aware of 
the details of what is recommended.


Hartzer said he didn’t want more prescriptive regulation but supported the 
idea if it was the last step in the complaints framework:

There may be occasions that people say they’re still not happy. It’s entirely 
appropriate to look at that appeal framework. I don’t have a strong view about 
whether that’s a tribunal or something else.
 
Thursday’s hearing has just concluded, I’ll bring you a summary of the 
afternoon shortly.
 
Brian Hartzer has clarified his earlier comment that a bank tribunal was 
discussed in a meeting in April or May with the treasurer, by adding the 
tribunal was mentioned only “in passing”.

Labor’s Matt Thistlethwaite asks about whether “avoiding a royal commission” 
was also discussed.

Hartzer said Westpac accepts whatever regulatory response the government 
chooses but would prefer to make changes now rather than wait for a royal 
commission and then make change. He said that was the essence of what he 
advised the treasurer.
 
The deputy chairman, Matt Thistlethwaite, has asked about Asic action against 
Westpac over alleged manipulation of the bank bill swap rate and what review it 
ordered.

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, said there was an external 
investigation:

The conclusion of our investigation is that our people have not done anything 
wrong, and that’s why we’re defending that matter in court.
 
Liberal MP Trevor Evans asks about small business lending rates and whether 
they will remain high.

Brian Hartzer blames increased funding costs relative to the cash rate, 
requirements to hold more capital for small business loans, and the need to 
“price risk through the cycle”.

When you look at small business lending over time, those loans are more likely 
to go bad, [and] you lose more when they go bad.

 
Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has given a spiel against the deposit guarantee 
offered by Labor for the second time today.

He argues it cost big banks 70 basis points to buy into the guarantee compared 
with 150 for smaller banks, although asthe scheme’s official page makes clear 
<http://www.guaranteescheme.gov.au/qa/deposits.html> that’s because big banks 
have a better credit rating.
 
MP Craig Kelly has asked if a consumer with $500 of credit card debt misses a 
$25 minimum monthly repayment, how much they will be charged? $9. He then wants 
to know how much the lateness actually costs the bank, and the Westpac execs 
take it on notice.

Hartzer says the bank has “no plans” to increase its fees now ANZ has won a 
high court case in defence of a $35 late payment fee.

Kelly wants to know how high fees could go if $35 isn’t an unlawful penalty. 
Hartzer said it’s a “hypothetical” because Westpac had decreased its fee to $9.
 
MP Craig Kelly has asked whether Westpac faced legal proceedings for late 
credit card fees.

Its chief financial officer, Peter King, said the proceedings were 
discontinued after ANZ won a similar case in the high court. He takes on notice 
whether the bank asked for costs in the case.
 
Adam Bandt has asked about a couple who banked with Westpac for more than 20 
years and had an inflated income in a loan application.

The chief executive, Brian Hartzer, said he could not go into detail but 
denied the bank was responsible for inflating their income.

We have no incentive and no desire to lend people more than they can afford.

Asked to rule out anyone else’s incomes being altered or inflated, Hartzer 
said: “I can’t say it’s never happened, but not to my knowledge.”
 
Greens MP Adam Bandt has asked about $1.8m in donations in recent years by 
Westpac to the Labor and Liberal parties.

Hartzer said its policy is “open and transparent”. 

We don’t give cash donations to political parties. We support political 
parties and the political process by attending conferences and the like. We 
disclose everything we donate fully to the [Australian Electoral Commission].

Asked about NAB’s answer that it wanted to avoid the perception of a conflict 
by stopping donations, Hartzer said it had “no plans” to change its donations 
policy.
 
Liberal MP Scott Buchholz asked why credit card customers who never missed 
payments still paid interest rates up to 19%.

Risk is assessed on a “mass basis”, Hartzer explains, because it’s not 
practically possible to assess individual risk for each business customer.

He accepts Westpac could reduce credit card interest rates and still be 
profitable.
 
Brian Hartzer has come up with the magic number of what an ATM transaction 
costs: 20 cents. He doesn’t have to hand a figure for how much a transaction by 
a customer from another bank costs.

He said Westpac absorbed the cost of the ATM network for its customers, which 
explained why only customers of other banks pay a fee. The foreign fee “defrays 
the cost but comes nowhere near” paying for the whole network.

It’s a “reasonable assumption” that the fee is higher than the marginal cost 
of the transaction by customers of other banks, Hartzer said.
 
Matt Keogh has returned to asking about the UK’s new laws requiring individual 
accountability of executives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/fca-new-uk-banking-regulations-tracey-mcdermott>
. He suggests senior managers are responsible for training and systems around 
incorrect financial advice, not just the financial planners who give it.

Westpac’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, says risk is inherent in investing, 
and laws punishing innovation can have “unintended consequences”.

When they’ve been poorly advised, absolutely there should be consequences. But 
if people feel you can’t take risk because you’ll blame me and I’ll get a 
criminal penalty, a normal person would be much more reticent to give advice.
 
Labor’s Matt Keogh has gone on the attack claiming no part of the $2.7m 
short-term incentive Brian Hartzer is paid is for “customer satisfaction”.

Hartzer said a net promoters’ score (customers’ willingness to recommend a 
product to others) is 10% of his score card and a number of other measures are 
about becoming a more service-oriented organisation such as technological 
innovation and people and culture.
 
MP Matt Keogh has asked about consultation on a banking tribunal and when the 
idea was first raised.

Hartzer said there was a meeting in April or May with the heads of the banks 
and the treasurer about resolution of complaints and the tribunal was raised 
there.

I’ve never had a long conversation about the tribunal. I’m not really aware of 
the details of what is recommended.

He supported consideration of gaps in accountability and improving the 
consumer complaints processes.
 
Brian Hartzer said Westpac had unconscious bias training for the top four 
layers of its management and would “continue to look at everything we can from 
the customer interface point of view to make sure women are very welcome”.

MP Julia Banks suggests the tribunal could mandate ethics and unconscious bias 
training to “provide benefits to consumers ... and ensure all employees across 
the bank are appropriately trained”.

Hartzer has concerns with “more prescriptive regulation”.

The more you prescribe what the bank does the more there are unintended 
consequences that have to be thought through carefully.
