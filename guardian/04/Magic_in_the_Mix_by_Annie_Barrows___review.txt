Magic in the Mix by Annie Barrows is the sequel to The Magic Half. Molly and 
Miri haven’t always been twins. They have come together through a magic door 
that allows them to travel through time. Now, they have lived with their family 
for years in a very old house in the south of the US.

One day, a new door in time opens to the year 1935 which upsets their world. 
The two girls decide to figure out the meaning of this magic. In 1918 Miri 
meets her parents when they are about to get to know each other (how creepy is 
that!). The two time travellers are also dropped into the 1860s, during the 
time of the Civil War! Will they find the connection between the different time 
lines? Will they do the right thing without interfering too much?

I really like the story because I love books with time travel. I couldn’t wait 
to see what was going to happen next and I’ve also learned a little bit about 
the American Civil War. Time travel also makes you think about how an action 
can change the future in a good or bad way. For example, I’m glad Molly escapes 
her horrible aunt but I felt worried about her brothers when they got trapped 
in the past.


Above all I liked the relationship between the twin sisters. They really love 
and care for each other. Sometimes they don’t need to speak to understand one 
another. Other times they have to guess, it gets stressful and they clash. They 
are sisters and best friends. They are also very brave and try to help people.


I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about time travel, magic 
and friendship. I give it a 9 out of 10!!!
