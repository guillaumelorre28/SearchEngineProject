Why, when packing for a holiday, does one thing end up left behind? For a 
simple task, it’s surprisingly easy to forget the suncream, spare socks or, if 
you’re unlucky, your passport.

The way the brain works makes it much more difficult to remember to do 
something at a later moment, known as prospective memory. Retrospective memory, 
remembering something that has already happened, is much easier. This is 
because the neural encoding of retrospective memories is activated by context - 
sounds, thoughts and conversations. So, it’s easy to tell someone what you’ve 
packed if they ask, but nearly impossible to be sure in advance that you will 
remember to pack the right things, as you can’t predict the exact context of 
when you’ll be packing. A slight change to the circumstances, such as an 
interruption, can thwart the prospective memory of even the most conscientious 
person.

Perhaps one day we will understand how not to forget things but, for now, the 
best solution is detailed checklists, or phone alarms – as long as you remember 
to consult them, or recall what that alarm was supposed to remind you of.
