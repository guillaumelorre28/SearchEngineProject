His best-loved comic creation, Baldrick, couldn't see the point in theatre â€“ 
butTony Robinson

 evidently does, having signed up to act on stage for the first time in 16 
years.

Robinson, who received a knighthood in the Queen's birthday honours earlier 
this year, will play theScottish children's author Kenneth Grahame

narrating theRoyal Ballet's production of The Wind in the Willows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jul/09/wind-in-willows-royal-opera-house>
 when it transfers to London's West End this December.

Will Tuckett's production, the ROH's first West End transfer, will run for 
three months at the Duchess Theatre with Robinson reading a text written by the 
former poet laureateAndrew Motion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/andrewmotion>. He'll be joined on stage by 
original cast member Will Kemp, who returns as Ratty.

Though he performed an improvised, standup tour in 2006, Robinson hasn't acted 
on stage since 1997, starring in a nationwide tour ofAlan Bennett's public 
school-set Forty Years On

, reportedly "revelling in the chance to milk the piece's comic potential".

However, Robinson has a broad range of theatre credits, thanks to stints with 
the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Chichester Festival 
theatre, playing everything from Ibsen to Agamemnon. He made his theatre debut 
at the age of 12, playing one of Fagin's gang in theoriginal production of 
Lionel Bart's Oliver! <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk0JQnq6yLQ>
