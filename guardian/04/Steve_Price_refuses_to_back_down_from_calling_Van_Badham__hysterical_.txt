Steve Price has refused to back down from calling Van Badham “hysterical” on 
Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jul/12/qa-steve-price-says-van-badham-just-being-hysterical-about-domestic-violence>
 and has accused the ABC program of ambushing him with a question about family 
violence.

Price, who has been a regular Monday-night panellist on the Ten program The 
Project for five years, was interviewed about the exchange with Badham in a 
special segment on Tuesday.

 Badham, a Guardian Australia columnist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/van-badham>, was approached by a Project 
producer to be interviewed for the show but was later dropped without 
explanation, despite telling them she was keen to be given the right of reply.

“They don’t seem to understand that giving him a platform enables him to 
perpetuate an ongoing distortion and reframing of the incident to suit himself 
– like describing me as an “aggressive woman” who “verballed” him, as he 
claimed on The Project,” she said.

I'm still reeling from Q&A – but not because I was called 'hysterical' | Van

“Without me there, he gets to paint me as some kind of indefensible folk 
villain: his followers are dogwhistled towards the demon he’s created out of me 
and the attack is predictably inhuman.

“Over the past two days I’ve been told hundreds of times that I’m fat, stupid, 
a retard, that I’m unfuckable, I’m a liar, a fraud, I’m mentally ill, I should 
be sent to a psychiatrist, I must be childless, I should be sterilised, I’m a 
bitch who should have her face smashed in.”




 Price said on 3AW Drive with Tom Elliott that he had eavesdropped on Badham’s 
conversation in the ABC’s makeup room. He went on to reveal details about her 
personal life, which he repeated on his own program later.

 The veteran radio broadcaster told Project hosts Carrie Bickmore and Waleed 
Aly he had no regrets about the heated moment on Monday night’s show, which has 
led to calls for him to be dropped by Ten.



 “I think I accurately described how Van Badham was behaving,” Price said. 
“I’m not going to be verballed by an aggressive woman sitting next to me who 
thinks you can only be upset by domestic violence if you’re female.”

 Price said he was disappointed to be “ambushed” on Monday night because a Q&A 
producer told him a question about Eddie McGuire and family violence would be 
asked, but not that “the person asking that question would be the victim of 
such horrific family violence”.

 The question was from audience member Tarang Chawla, who told the panel his 
sister had been murdered by her husband.

None of the politicians or other panellists on Q&A are given advance warning 
of the questions the audience will ask
ABC spokeswoman 
 “Sam Newman has courted controversy yet again for defending Eddie McGuire, 
who joked about drowning Caroline Wilson,” Chawla said. “I work as an 
ambassador for Our Watch, White Ribbon and the Safe Steps Family Violence 
Response Centre. Male violence is a leading cause of death and disability for 
women under 45 in Australia.

 “My sister Nikita was stabbed to death by her partner in January last year 
with a meat cleaver. She was 23. How will politicians and the media play a 
better role in bringing about long-overdue culture shift so tragedies like what 
happened to my family are not normalised?”

 A spokeswoman for the ABC told Guardian Australia the program never told 
panellists the specific questions before the live show. “None of the 
politicians or other panellists on Q&A are given advance warning of the 
questions the audience will ask,” she said. “It is up to the panellists how 
they respond.”

 As well as appearing on The Project, Price used several other platforms to 
criticise Badham, includinghis own show on 2GB 
<http://www.2gb.com/audioplayer/189811> with Andrew Bolt, on which he called 
the writer aggressive and a disgrace.

 Bolt also attacked Badham on his Sky News program and put up screenshots from 
tweets she posted years ago.
