Last year more than one fifth of the UK's postgraduate students were enrolled 
on business and administrative courses, making it one of the most popular areas 
of postgraduate study.

The masters of business administration (MBA) offers intensive training in 
managerial and technical skills. Many people see it as a fast track to 
promotion for those whose careers have plateaued.Students 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/students> are offered the chance to grow 
a network of industry contacts through alumni and develop specialisms in areas 
such as global energy or sustainability.

But with some programmes costing as much as Â£57,500, many will question whether
MBAs <https://www.theguardian.com/education/mbas> are worth the tuition fees.

If you're considering enrolling on an MBA course but aren't sure if it's right 
for you, don't fear. From 1-3pm on Tuesday we'll be joined by representatives 
from business schools across the country. They'll be able to answer your 
questions about finding the perfect course, making an application and securing 
financial support.

To take part in the discussion post your questions in the comments thread now 
or join us between 1-3pm on Tuesday.
