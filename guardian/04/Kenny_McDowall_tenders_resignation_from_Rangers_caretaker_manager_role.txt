A short statement from the club said: “Kenny McDowall has tendered his 
resignation as caretaker manager of Rangers Football Club, citing personal 
reasons for stepping down.

“Kenny, who has been a fantastic servant of the club, will serve his 12-month 
notice period, during which time he will remain 100% committed to his normal 
duties. The club respects Kenny’s decision and he will continue to have the 
full support of everybody at Rangers.”

McDowall first joined Rangers in 2007 when Walter Smith brought in the former 
Partick and St Mirren striker from Celtic, where he was working with the 
Parkhead youngsters. As first-team coach he helped the Ibrox side to three 
league titles in a row and was also credited for the role he played as the club 
progressed to the 2008 Uefa Cup final.
