Australian Rugby Union chief Bill Pulver has criticised the unstable playing 
surface at AAMI Park as below Test standard and threatened to tear up an 
agreement to play another match there next year if it doesn’t improve.

In a major embarrassment for the ARU, and despite assurances from ground 
staff, the turf consistently tore up under the weight of scrums duringEngland’s 
23-7 victory over the Wallabies

Pulver said the ARU had expressed its “extreme disappointment” to the 
Melbourne and Olympic Trust, which runs the venue, and has failed to repair the 
surface despite similar issues during every Super Rugby match held this year.

Pulver also revealed the ARU has an existing contract in place with AAMI Park 
to host a Test in 2017 but said it would be revisited if there is no 
satisfactory progress in the coming months.

Eddie Jones: England can win Australia series 3-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jun/19/eddie-jones-england-can-win-australia-series-3-0-video-rugby-union>
“The venue is obligated to provide a playing surface which is safe for the 
playing of international rugby and clearly this was not delivered upon last 
night,” Pulver said.

“While we haven’t yet announced the fixture ... prior to making any decision 
about 2017, the stadium must put specific measures in place, including an 
independent turf expert providing regular reports back to the ARU.

“I have suggested previously that the stadium should investigate a hybrid 
playing surface, similar to the one used at Twickenham, which is 90% grass and 
10% synthetic and stood up superbly to the rigours of the Rugby World Cup.

“AAMI Park must investigate all technology available to improve the surface. 
If [not] we’ll need to revisit our agreement with them for 2017.”

The ARU chose to stage the match at the boutique AAMI Park – instead of the 
adjacent MCG, which was vacant – to ensure spectators were closer to the action.

The atmosphere was indeed electric and a new ground record crowd of 29,871 was 
set, but the situation put players at risk of injury – fortunately none were 
hurt.

Referee Craig Joubert offered his sympathy to players but told them: “It is 
what it is.”

Both the venue and the ARU were openly mocked on social media during the 
match, with large divots scattered across the field by full-time.
