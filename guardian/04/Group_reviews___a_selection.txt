The Grunts in Trouble <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/grunts-in-trouble.html>
 by Philip Aardagh

Review by Scarlet

This book is about a family of ugly people who stole a boy from a washing 
line! They live in a caravan that Mr Grunt made with his father. They are 
always moving because if they stayed in one place they would cause trouble.

I think girls aged about 10 would enjoy this book. It’s really funny and not 
too long! I give it five out of five stars. My favourite bit was when the 
fireworks are set off by Larry Smalls.

Attack of the Demon Dinner Ladies 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/372564/> by Pamela 
Butchart

Review by Emily 

This book is about some children who try to stop the new ‘demon’ dinner ladies 
at their school. The children get into lots of mischief along the way before 
they realise they are wrong.

I personally think that all ages would love this book. I did, but it is 
probably focused on younger ages. I loved it because it was very funny and 
entertaining. It almost turns the pages for you as you can’t put it down. I 
give it four stars out of five. My absolutely favourite bit was when Maddie was 
in with the basketballs. I read this book in one evening!

Witchworld <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/witchworld.html> by Emma Fischel

Review by Lexie

Witchworld is about Flo who lives with her mum and her sister. Her sister 
Hetty thinks her nose isn’t warty or pointy enough. Her mum runs a magazine 
called Hocus Pocus which is full of gossip and scandal about famous witches. 
Flo’s grandma comes to stay and tells everyone that the ghouls are going to 
attack and no one believes her.
 Witchworld 
I think people who loved Goth Girl would love this book as Chris Riddell does 
the pictures. I really liked it as it was really fun. I’m reading the next one 
now. I give it 4.5/5.
