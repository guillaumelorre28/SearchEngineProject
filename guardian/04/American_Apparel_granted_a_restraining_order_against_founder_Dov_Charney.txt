American Apparel <https://www.theguardian.com/business/american-apparel> has 
been granted a restraining order against its founder and former chief 
executive, Dov Charney.

The order, the latest salvo in an ongoing legal skirmish, temporarily 
restrains Charney from breaching terms of an agreement that prevents him from 
seeking removal of the company’s board members and making negative statements 
in the press against the company or its employees, American Apparel said in a 
regulatory filing on Tuesday.

The order, issued Monday by the Delaware court of chancery, expires in July.

The retailer sued Charney in May for breaching a so-called “standstill” 
agreement preventing him from seeking board changes and from publicly attacking 
the company’s executives.


Charney, a Canadian who founded American Apparel as a T-shirt wholesaler in 
1998, was fired by the company last December after a series of scandals 
including allegations of sexual misconduct. The company said it had terminated 
his position “for cause” after an internal investigation.

Charney has filed an arbitration claim and sued American Apparel for $20m 
accusing the company and Colleen Brown, the company’s chairwoman, of defamation.

That suit is one of a series that have been launched by Charney’s lawyers. 
Charney’s lawyer has also backed former employees who have complained to the 
National Labour Relations Board that American Apparel has blocked workers 
seeking to unionize. The lawyers are also supporting a suit by 200 former 
employees who claim they were improperly dismissed.

American Apparel has denied the claims and characterised them as an attempt by 
its former founder to wrest back control of the company.
