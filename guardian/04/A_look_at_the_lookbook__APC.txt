The arrival of the APC lookbook always causes a flurry of excitement on the 
fashion desk. It's filled with brilliantly boring things that we love. In fact, 
it's always a thing of boring beauty in itself.

This time around it's a poster cum paint-chart which shows clothing samples 
rather than colour samples. It's a simple but genius idea which manages to 
emphasize what APC does so well: simple shapes in exactly-right-for-now 
colours. If my next season wardrobe bears any resemblance to this neat 
coloured-coded 2D wardrobe then I'll be happy.
