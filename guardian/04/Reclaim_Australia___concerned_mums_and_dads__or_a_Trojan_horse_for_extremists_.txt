There are few movements that can claim, while struggling to weed out 
neo-Nazis, white supremacists and far right extremists in their midst, to have 
the ear of government.

For all their dire image problems, organisers for Reclaim Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/reclaim-australia> are already 
counting their successes in a self-styled grassroots campaign against the 
advance of radical Islam in Australia.

Reclaim spokesman John Oliver notes that despite the group being “carved up” 
in the media and drawing vociferous counter protests since their first public 
rallies in April, the federal government has “never publicly denounced Reclaim”.

Indeed, Oliver says Reclaim has taken heart from a series of moves since by 
the Abbott government that they say have partly allayed their fears.

Chief among these are the government’s bill to deport citizens suspected of 
links to terrorism

“In a way by [the government] not saying anything and actually putting these 
bills and these investigations in place … it’s almost like a nod to us, that we 
might be on the right track,” Oliver says.

Nevertheless, Oliver, a former landscape gardener and father of two from 
Newcastle, says it is “kind of unclear where we go from here”.

“How far are we going to push it? I mean, we’re getting everything we ask 
for,” he says. “We can’t rally in the streets for no reason.”

Future dilemmas include how to translate Reclaim concerns such as face 
coverings – equally objectionable on Muslim women as on left-wing protesters, 
says Oliver – into fully-fledged political campaigns.

There is also the question of which political party Reclaim will throw its 
support behind. TheCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, which Oliver says for 
the moment is “doing a fantastic job”? One Nation, whose founder Pauline Hanson 
is a two-time speaker at Reclaim rallies? Or a single issue party like the 
Australian Liberty Alliance, which shares Reclaim’s concerns about Islam – but 
with an opposition to abortion and gay marriage which the likes of Oliver 
cannot abide?

As far as uneasy alliances go, however, Reclaim has more pressing concerns.

The group’s moment of peak respectability, attracting federal government 
backbencher George Christensen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/16/coalition-mp-will-speak-against-radical-islam-threat-at-reclaim-australia-rally>
 to speak at their Mackay rally, was marred by the revelation that almost all 
of its Queensland organisers haddefected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/19/reclaim-australia-brisbane-rally-organisers-announce-split-from-group>
 overnight to form a group called Australians Against Islam (AAI).

They also included the very organisers who invited Christensen, who like 
Oliver was at pains to point out his problem was with “radical Islam” not an 
entire religion.

“As far as I’m concerned, people are free to criticise any religion that they 
want, really,” Christensen told Guardian Australia.

“But I would not turn up to a rally that’s organised by Australians Against 
Islam <https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam>, that’s for sure.”

One Queensland AAI defector, the operator of a dating website, said he was 
approached to run a Reclaim rally via his Facebook page “Australian Patriots” 
before it was suspended because of complaints.

The defector, who asked not to be named out of concerns for his safety, said 
the Queensland contingent was ready to leave Reclaim fortnight ago but remained 
to see their rallies through.

On Oliver’s account, the people who formed Reclaim Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/reclaim-australia> were “mostly 
concerned mums and dads, some religious, some not” who met through sharing 
their concerns online in the wake of the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney in December.

“You can sort of tell we’re hacks,” he says. 

“We’re really struggling to … there’s no real leadership. We got a couple of 
press statements coming out but that’s about as professional as we get.”

But Oliver says Reclaim Australia tries hard to shun the more extreme 
viewpoints he admits the group has inevitably galvanized and drawn into its 
circle.

The AAI defectors, he says, were “in the national organisers group just 
leading up to this rally and they were causing trouble for all of us who 
weren’t anti-Muslim”.

“If their title was Australians against Radical Islam, I think they’d get more 
support,” he says.

Some bedfellows are easier to shun then others.

Christensen has learned of another unwelcome element that attended the Mackay 
rally he addressed: two recruiters from the far-right United Patriots Front 
that “people were avoiding like the plague”.

“This group is bad news,” Christensen said.

Reclaim Australia has struggled to distance itself from the UPF, whose earlier 
formation represented the first split in a movement barely months old.

It is led by Reclaim’s onetime chief social media promoter, the Canberra truck 
driver, neo-Nazi metal band member and self-proclaimed “Great Aussie Patriot”, 
Sherman Burgess.

It includes Neil Erikson, who pleaded guilty last year to stalking a Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> rabbi, which a judge 
concluded was out of racial prejudice “if not hatred”.

It also includes Blair Cottrell, who has been jailed for arson, and posted on 
social media that Mein Kampf should be read in schools.

This notwithstanding, the UPF, which organised its own rally at the site of 
the Reclaim demonstration inMelbourne last Saturday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/18/anti-racism-protesters-outnumber-reclaim-australia-supporters-as-groups-clash>
, made much of helping to eject neo-Nazi Glen Anderson.

Oliver says Reclaim had earlier ejected Anderson and fellow neo-Nazi Ross May 
from their “patriot bus” which took protesters fromSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> to Melbourne.

He says Reclaim may “never recover” from the public damage caused by a 
photograph of the swastika on the back of May’s skull at Reclaim’s first rally 
in April.

“We copped a lot of flak. It was just some blatantly racist people in the 
movement with some really hardline views on just Muslims in general,” Oliver 
says.

“Because that’s not who we are, we’ve done a lot of work to separate ourselves 
form them. That’s how the UPF was born. They were the hardliners who we didn’t 
want to be associated with a bunch of mum and dads like myself. We split them 
off; we got rid of the Nazi element real early.”

Oliver estimates there are 100 neo-Nazis in Australia, from groups including 
Squadron 88 and the Hammerskins.

“There’s not a lot of them but they jumped on board. And when you get a 
movement like ours, you’re going to get people who try to hijack it for their 
own means,” he says.

“I can understand why we get so many people countering Reclaim Australia 
because even I would counter that if Reclaim was about that.”

Oliver is more equivocal about the UPF. When first asked about the group’s 
involvement, he told Guardian Australia: “We obviously know each other and 
we’re going to keep in contact.”

“Some people are obviously taking it too far, maybe a bit too extreme. [But] a 
lot of our goals are still the same, we’re all still fighting radical Islam.

“We’re not going to work with bloody Nazis. But people in the UPF, if they 
want to support us in a rally, we wouldn’t say no, let’s put it that way.”

When told about Christensen’s view of the UPF a day later, Oliver said: “We’ve 
got nothing to do with those guys. I wouldn’t want to be seen in the same pub 
as them.”

“But at the same time, they’re far right. They’re on our side. We can’t get 
away from them,” he said.

Oliver said Reclaim had asked the UPF not to attend the Melbourne rally but 
was as powerless to stop their presence as that of the larger anti-racist 
counter protest.

“If Reclaim had nothing to do again with UPF we’d be quite happy with that. We 
asked them not to show up this time and they still did. We can’t stop them,” he 
said.

“It doesn’t mean we support them or they support us, it just means they’re 
using the publicity that Reclaim brings to further their own cause.”

Oliver also dismissed as a “beat up” reports that a UPF member had a gun 
confiscated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/23/demonstrator-on-way-to-melbourne-reclaim-australia-rally-had-gun-seized>
 in Sydney en route to the rally.

He said the man was not a UPF member, and was a licensed gun owner who had no 
intention of taking the handgun to the rally but to a Victorian shooting range 
of which he was formerly a member.

“I can understand some people are trying to paint it as some one trying to 
take [a gun] to a rally, almost trying to say somebody was going to get shot 
down there. That’s not the truth.

“No crimes were committed. No one’s done anything wrong.”

Reclaim Australia would seem unlikely to attract further mainstream 
endorsement while beset with such issues.

But Oliver says in the event of “another terrorism attack on Australia, the 
Reclaim movement will likely double overnight”.

Frank Mols, a political scientist from the University of Queensland who has 
studied the rise of right-wing populist groups across the world, says such a 
crisis is just as likely to galvanise support for mainstream political parties.

But Mols says his own research in political psychology demonstrates that, 
contrary to conventional belief, groups like Reclaim Australia can appeal as 
much to the affluent middle class as the “stereotypical low-educated, typically 
male, working class, on the fringe of society, maybe with a criminal record”.

“I can see it growing to some extent. It’s bound to attract some opportunist 
leader [who] could be another figurehead [like Pauline Hanson],” he says.

 “The real danger of these movements is not the movements themselves but the 
normative hardening that happens through alignment and the gradual shift on 
issues like border protection, immigration and asylum seekers.

“Bill Shorten’s u-turn [on border protection] is a classic example of what 
started with Pauline Hanson, which permeated into the Liberal party and then 
the Labor party. That’s the danger, that we’re not aware of the shift from 
tolerant to hard.”
