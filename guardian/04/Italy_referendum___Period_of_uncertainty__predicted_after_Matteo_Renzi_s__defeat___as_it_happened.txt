Closing summary

Here’s a roundup of the latest on Italy’s referendum and its aftermath:

 * Matteo Renzi is preparing to formally submit his resignation after voters 
dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a crushing referendum that saw 
close to 60% of voters opt for “no” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/matteo-renzi-due-to-formally-submit-resignation-as-italy-ponders-what-next>
. He said “My experience in government ends here … I did all I could to bring 
this to victory. Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which 
he said he would tender his resignation. 
 * The margin of the rejection– close to 20 percentage points – was much wider 
than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% 
went for yes. Overseas votersbucked the trend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d#block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d>
, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes.

 * The vote prompted the euro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the 
dollar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/euro-falls-to-20-month-low-after-italy-referendum-defeat>
 and then bounce back to itshighest level since mid-November

.But shares in Italian banks have tumbled.

 * Shares in the world’s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena 
<http://english.mps.it/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx> - fell sharply. Concerns 
about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the European 
Banking Authority in July, when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 
European institutions subjected to the annual assessment. 
 * France’s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italian referendum 
as an anti-austerity signal to France. She said: “After the Greek referendum, 
after Brexit, this Italian No adds a new people to the list of those who would 
like to turn their backs on absurd European policies which are plunging the 
continent into poverty.” 
 * Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, 
according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. “The 
difference between Italy and other states such as Germany andAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> is that, until now, in Italy there 
has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),” he said. 
 * Germany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the 
result was a “concern’. But finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> should continue with Renzi’s economic 
policies. “Italy has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken 
economically and politically”, he said. 
 * The referendum – which was on questions of constitutional reform 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844d574e4b015a427f778b9#block-5844d574e4b015a427f778b9>
 not the euro or EU – was nonethelessseized upon by populist groups 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/referendum-win-may-lead-nowhere-for-five-star-and-northern-league>
 including the Five Star movement and the anti-immigration Northern League 
(Lega Nord), which called for snap elections. 
 * Matteo Salvini, head of Italy’s far right Northern League party, has hailed 
the referendum result as Italy’s ‘liberation day’ from the Renzi government.He 
said it sent a message to Europe. 
 * European commissioners and finance ministers put a brave face on the result.
Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, 
said he had “full confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation”. 
French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, said: “The referendum wasn’t about 
Europe.” 
 * Italy’s president Sergio Mattarella is thought unlikely to call fresh 
elections but is instead expected to appoint a caretaker prime minister. 
Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and 
Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted.

Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which he said he would 
tender his resignation.

 Reuters looks at the possible contenders to succeed him and what happens next:

 Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, who has pulled out of meetings with 
European finance ministers in Brussels this week, is viewed as a possible 
candidate to replace Renzi.

Senate President Pietro Grasso and Transport Minister Graziano Delrio have 
also been tipped as possible successors.


 It is unclear if Renzi will have enough support in his Democratic Party (PD) 
to remain party leader - a role that could give him a say in who becomes the 
next prime minister.

President Sergio Mattarella will consult with party leaders before naming a 
new prime minister - the fourth successive head of government to be appointed 
without an electoral mandate, a fact that underscores the fragility of Italy’s 
political system.

 In the meantime, Renzi would stay on as caretaker. 


 The new prime minister, who will need the backing of Renzi’s PD to take 
office, will have to draw up a new electoral law, with the Five Star Movement 
urging a swift deal to open the way for elections in early 2017, a year ahead 
of schedule.

 “From tomorrow, we will start work on putting together 5-Star’s future 
programme and the team of people that will make up a future government,” said 
Luigi Di Maio, tipped to be the group’s prime ministerial candidate.

 Opinion polls put 5-Star neck-and-neck with the PD.

Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister and leading contender to replace 
Renzi, has told European finance leaders thatItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> cannot make commitments for extra 
funds for the 2017 budget.

He cited the “political situation” in Italy, according Jeroen Dijsselbloem, 
the head of the group of 19 countries that use the euro.

Earlier Dijsselbloem said there is no need for “emergency steps” after Italian 
voters rejected constitutional reforms.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem (@J_Dijsselbloem) 
Spoke to Italian minister Padoan today. Due to political situation impossible

 He told reporters in Brussels that “it doesn’t really change the situation 
economically in Italy or in the Italian banks. It doesn’t seem to require any 
emergency steps.”

MPS shares fall

Jill Treanor

Shares in the world’s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena 
<http://english.mps.it/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx> - have fallen after the 
vote, writes the Guardian’s city editor Jill Treanor.

Investors in MPS, which was founded in 1472, fear the resignation of Matteo 
Renzi as prime minister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
will affect attempts to clinch a €5bn (£4.2bn) lifeline from investors by the 
end of the year. The shares plunged 10% before recovering some losses. They 
were trading 3% lower at around midday in London.

Concerns about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the 
European Banking Authority in July, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests>
when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions 
subjected to the annual assessment.

A consortium led by JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, is reportedly 
meeting to discuss the fundraising. There were also reports that Monte dei 
Paschi bank officials will meet the Qatar Investment Authority – the gulf 
state’s sovereign wealth fund – to try to secure backing from a key investor.

Even so, there are expectations that the Italian government will need to prop 
up the bank, despite new EU rules which prevent state aid unless bondholders 
have been forced to take losses.

Alberto Chiandetti, a manager at the Fidelity European Opportunities and 
Fidelity FundsItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> investment funds, 
said: “The focus is on whether an anchor investor will materialise or not. If 
not, Monte Paschi needs a plan B and in that scenario, bank shares are likely 
to suffer most. We should know [on Monday] whether such an anchor investor 
exists for Monte Paschi.”


The prospects of a capital injection for MPS being found entirely from private 
investors appeared to be receding, analysts said. “I think a precautionary 
recapitalisation is ultimately still probable as a private sector-only solution 
is now highly unlikely to work,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of 
Eurasia Group.

Lizzy Davies

Our former Paris correspondent Lizzy Davies has a better translation of Le 
Pen’s reaction to the Italian referendum.

Welcoming the “huge No” to Renzi’s proposals, Le Pen said it was “a No to the 
absurd policy of ultra-austerity which Matteo Renzi pursued, a policy wanted by 
theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and imposed on Italy.” 

The “austerity purge” in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> had 
led to no economic gain, Le Pen claimed, using the referendum result to attack 
her opponents in France, particularly François Fillon, the right’s Thatcherite 
presidential candidate, who Le Pen said would like to “speed up” austerity.

She added: “After the Greek referendum, after Brexit, this Italian No adds a 
new people to the list of those who would like to turn their backs on absurd 
European policies which are plunging the continent into poverty. More broadly - 
and the impressive growth of the [far-right] Freedom Party inAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> shows just this - the global 
rejection of all the European Union’s policies, its economic and migration ones 
in particular, is speeding up on the continent.

“It is time that France chose someone capable of being the leader of a Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of nations and freedoms, able 
to coalesce the energy of all countries which reject an austerity-led, free 
trade-supporting and pro-immigration political model.”

Italy’s former prime minister, Mario Monti, predicts there will be no early 
elections and that a new centre-left government will be formed and returnItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> to a policy of fiscal tightening.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, Monti said: “I do not 
believe there will be early elections. I’m convinced that the president of the 
republic, in his wisdom, will find a solution within the space of the current 
political majority of the centre left.”

He said there was no need for alarm. “In the financial markets the reactions 
are considerably cooler than many feared,” Monti said.

He claimed that in the last 18 months, Renzi’s government had relaxed fiscal 
policy a “bit too much” in the hope of winning the referendum.

Monti, who backed a no vote, added: “With the distraction of the referendum 
over, there may well be a refocussing of economic policy on its core business 
which is not that of creating a favourable consensus.”

Monti said the no vote was not the result of populist sentiment. “It would be 
inappropriate to see this result as another victory for populism. Prime 
minister Renzi himself had played the populist card quite strongly from the 
top, particularly against theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”

Monti argued the voters demonstrated maturity in rejecting money being 
transferred by the state to the banks.

He also denied that the vote was a rejection of the euro. “Among the parties 
which recommended the no vote, there is the Five Star Movement and separately 
they say that if they were in majority government one day they would promote a 
referendum for Italy to go out of the euro. But I know so many people who voted 
no though being fervent pro-Europeans.”

Before the vote, Monti argued that there was no reason for Renzi to resign if 
he lost the referendum. But in his interview Monti said: “the negative outcome 
for him was so massive that I understand and respect his immediate [decision 
to] resign.”

Le Pen: Italian referendum is a signal to France
 Marine Le Pen Front Photograph: MESSYASZ/SIP/REX/Shutterstock 
France’s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> referendum and claims it boosts her 
chances of becoming France’s next president.

In a statement the Front National  
<http://www.frontnational.com/2016/12/italie-un-non-despoir/>leader said the 
result was a signal to France. She claimed her key opponent in the presidential 
election François Fillon backed Renzi and his austerity policies

She said after Brexit and the Greek referendum, Italy was the latest country 
“to turn its backs on absurd European policies that are plunging the continent 
into misery.”

She added: “It is time that France chooses a leader who can be the leader of 
freeEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of nations, able to 
unite the energy of all these countries in rejecting a political project based 
on austerity, free-market and immigration.”

Matteo Renzi is preparing to formally submit his resignation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
 before Italy’s president, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner in her latest roundup 
from Rome.

Renzi conceded shortly after midnight on Monday and is expected to head to the 
presidential palace, the Quirinale, on Monday afternoon.

The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Northern League 
quickly sought to capitalise on Renzi’s defeat and say they want snap 
elections, even before a planned reform of electoral laws is to go ahead.


Luigi Di Maio, one of the M5S’s rising stars, declared that the populist 
movement was ready to create the future government, while the xenophobic 
Northern League head, Matteo Salvini, said his fringe party – which has its 
roots in secessionism – ought to be considered a “serious alternative”. Salvini 
called the result – and the strong showing of the far right Austrian party in 
elections yesterday, which itultimately lost 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/far-right-party-concedes-defeat-in-austrian-presidential-election>
 – a clash of “all against one”.

Theres’ no need to panic or hyperventilate argues analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta. 
In ablogpost for the Open Europe 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/renzi-waves-arrivederci-crushing-referendum-defeat-sky-hasnt-fallen/>
 thinktank he writes:

European politics is slightly more complex than dominos. What took place in 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> yesterday was neither a general 
election nor a referendum on the single currency. Either would likely be a 
different proposition. The ‘No’ camp was a very broad church. This makes me 
wary of describing the result simply as ‘Renzi being brought down by the 
populist wave’ – unless we want to describe Mario Monti or former Italian 
Constitutional Court President Valerio Onida (to mention but two examples) as 
populists for being against the reform.

There was certainly an anti-establishment (and anti-Renzi) element involved, 
but one should also bear in mind that – beyond the headlines and the slogans – 
the proposed constitutional changes did raise some genuine issues and proved 
more controversial than many seem to appreciate.

Undeniably, Renzi’s resignation opens a period of greater political fluidity 
during which the reform process in Italy will slow down – and that will be 
regarded as bad news in Brussels, Berlin, and other European capitals. However,
as I already wrote last week 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/the-italian-constitutional-referendum-what-is-it-about-and-what-may-happen-next/>
, the framework is completely different from late 2011 and there are simply too 
many unknowns at this stage to predict – as some are doing – that the next 
Italian general election will certainly open the door to an anti-euro 
government in the Eurozone’s third-largest country.

Here’s a roundup of the latest on Italy’s referendum and its aftermath:

 * Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
 on Monday after voters dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a 
crushing referendum that saw close to 60% of voters opt for “no”. He said: “My 
experience in government ends here … I did all I could to bring this to 
victory. If you fight for an idea, you cannot lose.” 
 * Though Renzi had been predicted to lose, the margin – close to 20 
percentage points – was much wider than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 
59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% went for yes. Overseas votersbucked the trend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d#block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d>
, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes. 
 * Renzi’s departure – and the prospect of politically uncertain months ahead 
– prompted theeuro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the dollar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/euro-falls-to-20-month-low-after-italy-referendum-defeat>
. But after early losses it bounced back to itshighest level since mid-November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
 after traders realised there was little prospect of Italy leaving the single 
currency. 

 * Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, 
according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. “The 
difference between Italy and other states such as Germany andAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> is that, until now, in Italy there 
has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),” he said. 
 * Germany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the 
result was a “concern’. But finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> should continue with Renzi’s economic 
policies. “Italy has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken 
economically and politically”, he said. 
 * The referendum – which was on questions of constitutional reform 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844d574e4b015a427f778b9#block-5844d574e4b015a427f778b9>
 not the euro or EU – was nonethelessseized upon by populist groups 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/referendum-win-may-lead-nowhere-for-five-star-and-northern-league>
 including the Five Star movement and the anti-immigration Northern League 
(Lega Nord), which called for snap elections. 
 * Matteo Salvini, head of Italy’s far right Northern League party, has hailed 
the referendum result as Italy’s ‘liberation day’ from the Renzi government.He 
said it sent a message to Europe. 
 * European commissioners and finance ministers put a brave face on the result.
Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, 
said he had “full confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation”. 
French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, said: “The referendum wasn’t about 
Europe.” 
 * Italy’s president Sergio Mattarella is thought unlikely to call fresh 
elections but is instead expected to appoint a caretaker prime minister. 
Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and 
Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted. Facebook

The Markets expected Renzi to be defeated in the referendum so priced in the 
outcome, according to Reuters. But they were surprised by the scale of the 
defeat hence the initial fall in the value of the euro.

Luigi Scazzieri, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, argues that the 
vote is unlikely to lead of more instability inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Writing for the Guardian’s 
Opinion section he says:

A new government would likely be made up of the same political majority 
currently supporting Renzi, with the possible addition of Berlusconi’s Forza 
Italia party. It would face the same challenges and would continue to act in 
much the same way, steering the country towards new elections in late 2017 or 
2018 and pursuing the stony path of incremental economic reform. Indeed, while 
Renzi sought to portray the reforms as a make or break moment forItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the economic reforms of the past 
five years are not about to be undone.

A takeover by the populist Five Star Movement is unlikely either now or in the 
next election. The movement may run out of steam, as it increasingly becomes 
embroiled in political mishaps arising from its administration of Rome and 
Turin. Crucially, planned electoral reforms are likely to lead a form of 
proportional representation that will make it difficult for any single party to 
form a government. The continuation of coalition governments will exclude the 
Five Star Movement, which refuses to take part in them.

And any new Italian government is likely to behave in the same way as Renzi’s 
government did towards its European allies, seeking to bend fiscal rules in its 
favour and to press for a more expansive fiscal policy. It will also continue 
to demand solidarity from the EU with its efforts to deal with migrants and to 
rebuild the areas affected by recent earthquakes. Italy is unlikely to be the 
domino that leads to more instability inEurope

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> might have to spend public 
money to rescue some of its banks, including by taking stakes in them, 
according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny.

“The difference between Italy and other states such as Germany and Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> is that, until now, in Italy there 
has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),” Reuters 
quoted him saying.

Nowotny, who heads Austria’s central bank, added: “It therefore cannot be 
ruled out that it will be necessary for the state to take stakes (in banks) in 
some way.”

Here’s a roundup of the latest on Italy’s referendum and its aftermath:

 * Matteo Renzi is preparing to formally submit his resignation after voters 
dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a crushing referendum that saw 
close to 60% of voters opt for “no” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/matteo-renzi-due-to-formally-submit-resignation-as-italy-ponders-what-next>
. He said “My experience in government ends here … I did all I could to bring 
this to victory. Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which 
he said he would tender his resignation. 
 * The margin of the rejection– close to 20 percentage points – was much wider 
than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% 
went for yes. Overseas votersbucked the trend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d#block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d>
, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes.

 * The vote prompted the euro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the 
dollar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/euro-falls-to-20-month-low-after-italy-referendum-defeat>
 and then bounce back to itshighest level since mid-November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
.But shares in Italian banks have tumbled.

 * Shares in the world’s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena 
<http://english.mps.it/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx> - fell sharply. Concerns 
about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the European 
Banking Authority in July, when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 
European institutions subjected to the annual assessment. 
 * France’s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italian referendum 
as an anti-austerity signal to France. She said: “After the Greek referendum, 
after Brexit, this Italian No adds a new people to the list of those who would 
like to turn their backs on absurd European policies which are plunging the 
continent into poverty.” 
 * Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, 
according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. “The 
difference between Italy and other states such as Germany andAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> is that, until now, in Italy there 
has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),” he said.

Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and 
Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted.  
Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which he said he would 
tender his resignation.

 Reuters looks at the possible contenders to succeed him and what happens next:

 Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, who has pulled out of meetings with 
European finance ministers in Brussels this week, is viewed as a possible 
candidate to replace Renzi.

Senate President Pietro Grasso and Transport Minister Graziano Delrio have 
also been tipped as possible successors.


 It is unclear if Renzi will have enough support in his Democratic Party (PD) 
to remain party leader - a role that could give him a say in who becomes the 
next prime minister.

President Sergio Mattarella will consult with party leaders before naming a 
new prime minister - the fourth successive head of government to be appointed 
without an electoral mandate, a fact that underscores the fragility of Italy’s 
political system.

 In the meantime, Renzi would stay on as caretaker. 


 The new prime minister, who will need the backing of Renzi’s PD to take 
office, will have to draw up a new electoral law, with the Five Star Movement 
urging a swift deal to open the way for elections in early 2017, a year ahead 
of schedule.

 “From tomorrow, we will start work on putting together 5-Star’s future 
programme and the team of people that will make up a future government,” said 
Luigi Di Maio, tipped to be the group’s prime ministerial candidate.

 Opinion polls put 5-Star neck-and-neck with the PD.

Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister and leading contender to replace 
Renzi, has told European finance leaders thatItaly

funds for the 2017 budget.

He cited the “political situation” in Italy, according Jeroen Dijsselbloem,

Earlier Dijsselbloem said there is no need for “emergency steps” after Italian

Shares in the world’s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena 
<http://english.mps.it/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx> - have fallen after the 
vote, writes the Guardian’s city editor Jill Treanor.

Investors in MPS, which was founded in 1472, fear the resignation of Matteo 
Renzi as prime minister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
will affect attempts to clinch a €5bn (£4.2bn) lifeline from investors by the 
end of the year. The shares plunged 10% before recovering some losses. They 
were trading 3% lower at around midday in London.

Concerns about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the 
European Banking Authority in July, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests>
when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions 
subjected to the annual assessment.

A consortium led by JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, is reportedly 
meeting to discuss the fundraising. There were also reports that Monte dei 
Paschi bank officials will meet the Qatar Investment Authority – the gulf 
state’s sovereign wealth fund – to try to secure backing from a key investor.

Even so, there are expectations that the Italian government will need to prop 
up the bank, despite new EU rules which prevent state aid unless bondholders 
have been forced to take losses.

Alberto Chiandetti, a manager at the Fidelity European Opportunities and 
Fidelity FundsItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> investment funds, 
said: “The focus is on whether an anchor investor will materialise or not. If 
not, Monte Paschi needs a plan B and in that scenario, bank shares are likely 
to suffer most. We should know [on Monday] whether such an anchor investor 
exists for Monte Paschi.”


The prospects of a capital injection for MPS being found entirely from private 
investors appeared to be receding, analysts said. “I think a precautionary 
recapitalisation is ultimately still probable as a private sector-only solution 
is now highly unlikely to work,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of 
Eurasia Group.

Our former Paris correspondent Lizzy Davies has a better translation of Le 
Pen’s reaction to the Italian referendum.

Welcoming the “huge No” to Renzi’s proposals, Le Pen said it was “a No to the 
absurd policy of ultra-austerity which Matteo Renzi pursued, a policy wanted by 
theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and imposed on Italy.” 

The “austerity purge” in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> had 
led to no economic gain, Le Pen claimed, using the referendum result to attack 
her opponents in France, particularly François Fillon, the right’s Thatcherite 
presidential candidate, who Le Pen said would like to “speed up” austerity.

She added: “After the Greek referendum, after Brexit, this Italian No adds a 
new people to the list of those who would like to turn their backs on absurd 
European policies which are plunging the continent into poverty. More broadly - 
and the impressive growth of the [far-right] Freedom Party inAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> shows just this - the global 
rejection of all the European Union’s policies, its economic and migration ones 
in particular, is speeding up on the continent.

“It is time that France chose someone capable of being the leader of a Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of nations and freedoms, able 
to coalesce the energy of all countries which reject an austerity-led, free 
trade-supporting and pro-immigration political model.”

Italy’s former prime minister, Mario Monti, predicts there will be no early 
elections and that a new centre-left government will be formed and returnItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> to a policy of fiscal tightening.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, Monti said: “I do not 
believe there will be early elections. I’m convinced that the president of the 
republic, in his wisdom, will find a solution within the space of the current 
political majority of the centre left.”

He said there was no need for alarm. “In the financial markets the reactions 
are considerably cooler than many feared,” Monti said.

He claimed that in the last 18 months, Renzi’s government had relaxed fiscal 
policy a “bit too much” in the hope of winning the referendum.

Monti, who backed a no vote, added: “With the distraction of the referendum 
over, there may well be a refocussing of economic policy on its core business 
which is not that of creating a favourable consensus.”

Monti said the no vote was not the result of populist sentiment. “It would be 
inappropriate to see this result as another victory for populism. Prime 
minister Renzi himself had played the populist card quite strongly from the 
top, particularly against theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”

Monti argued the voters demonstrated maturity in rejecting money being 
transferred by the state to the banks.

He also denied that the vote was a rejection of the euro. “Among the parties 
which recommended the no vote, there is the Five Star Movement and separately 
they say that if they were in majority government one day they would promote a 
referendum for Italy to go out of the euro. But I know so many people who voted 
no though being fervent pro-Europeans.”

Before the vote, Monti argued that there was no reason for Renzi to resign if 
he lost the referendum. But in his interview Monti said: “the negative outcome 
for him was so massive that I understand and respect his immediate [decision 
to] resign.”

France’s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italy

chances of becoming France’s next president.

In a statement the Front National  
<http://www.frontnational.com/2016/12/italie-un-non-despoir/>leader said the 
result was a signal to France. She claimed her key opponent in the presidential 
election François Fillon backed Renzi and his austerity policies

She said after Brexit and the Greek referendum, Italy was the latest country 
“to turn its backs on absurd European policies that are plunging the continent 
into misery.”

She added: “It is time that France chooses a leader who can be the leader of 
freeEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of nations, able to 
unite the energy of all these countries in rejecting a political project based 
on austerity, free-market and immigration.”

<https://twitter.com/MLP_officiel/status/805757145459359744>  
Matteo Renzi is preparing to formally submit his resignation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
 before Italy’s president, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner in her latest roundup 
from Rome.

Renzi conceded shortly after midnight on Monday and is expected to head to the 
presidential palace, the Quirinale, on Monday afternoon.

The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Northern League 
quickly sought to capitalise on Renzi’s defeat and say they want snap 
elections, even before a planned reform of electoral laws is to go ahead.


Luigi Di Maio, one of the M5S’s rising stars, declared that the populist 
movement was ready to create the future government, while the xenophobic 
Northern League head, Matteo Salvini, said his fringe party – which has its 
roots in secessionism – ought to be considered a “serious alternative”. Salvini 
called the result – and the strong showing of the far right Austrian party in 
elections yesterday, which itultimately lost 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/far-right-party-concedes-defeat-in-austrian-presidential-election>

Theres’ no need to panic or hyperventilate argues analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta. 
In ablogpost for the Open Europe 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/renzi-waves-arrivederci-crushing-referendum-defeat-sky-hasnt-fallen/>
 thinktank he writes:

European politics is slightly more complex than dominos. What took place in 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> yesterday was neither a general 
election nor a referendum on the single currency. Either would likely be a 
different proposition. The ‘No’ camp was a very broad church. This makes me 
wary of describing the result simply as ‘Renzi being brought down by the 
populist wave’ – unless we want to describe Mario Monti or former Italian 
Constitutional Court President Valerio Onida (to mention but two examples) as 
populists for being against the reform.

There was certainly an anti-establishment (and anti-Renzi) element involved, 
but one should also bear in mind that – beyond the headlines and the slogans – 
the proposed constitutional changes did raise some genuine issues and proved 
more controversial than many seem to appreciate.

Undeniably, Renzi’s resignation opens a period of greater political fluidity 
during which the reform process in Italy will slow down – and that will be 
regarded as bad news in Brussels, Berlin, and other European capitals. However,
as I already wrote last week 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/the-italian-constitutional-referendum-what-is-it-about-and-what-may-happen-next/>
, the framework is completely different from late 2011 and there are simply too 
many unknowns at this stage to predict – as some are doing – that the next 
Italian general election will certainly open the door to an anti-euro 
government in the Eurozone’s third-largest country.
 
Here’s a roundup of the latest on Italy’s referendum and its aftermath:

 * Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
 on Monday after voters dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a 
crushing referendum that saw close to 60% of voters opt for “no”. He said: “My 
experience in government ends here … I did all I could to bring this to 
victory. If you fight for an idea, you cannot lose.” 
 * Though Renzi had been predicted to lose, the margin – close to 20 
percentage points – was much wider than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 
59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% went for yes. Overseas votersbucked the trend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/dec/04/italian-referendum-and-austrian-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d#block-5844efffe4b015a427f7791d>
, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes. 
 * Renzi’s departure – and the prospect of politically uncertain months ahead 
– prompted theeuro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the dollar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/euro-falls-to-20-month-low-after-italy-referendum-defeat>
. But after early losses it bounced back to itshighest level since mid-November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
 after traders realised there was little prospect of Italy leaving the single 
currency. 

 * Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, 
according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. “The 
difference between Italy and other states such as Germany andAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> is that, until now, in Italy there 
has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),” he said. 
 * Germany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the 
result was a “concern’. But finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> should continue with Renzi’s economic 
policies. “Italy has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken

The Markets expected Renzi to be defeated in the referendum so priced in the 
outcome, according to Reuters. But they were surprised by the scale of the 
defeat hence the initial fall in the value of the euro.
 
Luigi Scazzieri, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, argues that the 
vote is unlikely to lead of more instability inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Writing for the Guardian’s 
Opinion section he says:

A new government would likely be made up of the same political majority 
currently supporting Renzi, with the possible addition of Berlusconi’s Forza 
Italia party. It would face the same challenges and would continue to act in 
much the same way, steering the country towards new elections in late 2017 or 
2018 and pursuing the stony path of incremental economic reform. Indeed, while 
Renzi sought to portray the reforms as a make or break moment forItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the economic reforms of the past 
five years are not about to be undone.

A takeover by the populist Five Star Movement is unlikely either now or in the 
next election. The movement may run out of steam, as it increasingly becomes 
embroiled in political mishaps arising from its administration of Rome and 
Turin. Crucially, planned electoral reforms are likely to lead a form of 
proportional representation that will make it difficult for any single party to 
form a government. The continuation of coalition governments will exclude the 
Five Star Movement, which refuses to take part in them.

And any new Italian government is likely to behave in the same way as Renzi’s 
government did towards its European allies, seeking to bend fiscal rules in its 
favour and to press for a more expansive fiscal policy. It will also continue 
to demand solidarity from the EU with its efforts to deal with migrants and to 
rebuild the areas affected by recent earthquakes. Italy is unlikely to be the 
domino that leads to more instability inEurope
