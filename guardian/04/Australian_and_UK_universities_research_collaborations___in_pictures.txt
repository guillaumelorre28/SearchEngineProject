, professor in conservation science, Imperial College London


• Benefits: “In conservation science, international collaboration is essential 
because the problems that the world faces are often international or are 
similar in different places. The more we can learn and act together the more 
powerful our impact will be.”

• Challenges: “Collaboration at long distance can be challenging in terms of 
logistics and keeping communications going.”

Morena Mills <http://www.gpem.uq.edu.au/morena-mills>, postdoctoral research 
fellow, University of Queensland

• Benefits: “International collaboration between researchers allows us to 
understand which ideas can be applied across different countries.”

• Challenges: “International collaboration has challenges such as differences 
in culture or priorities, language barriers and the need to work around various 
time zones.”

• Benefits: “The exchange of ideas, the fresh and new perspectives provided, 
the sharing of knowledge, experience, and research techniques.”

• Challenges: “Not being able to discuss research ideas on a day-to-day basis.”

Graeme Hays, chair of marine science, Deakin University 

• Benefits: “I keep in regular contact with Jacques in Swansea by email and by 
Skyping. Academics typically work well beyond 9-5, so often I’ll see Jacques 
online either early morning or late at night and we’ll have a chat about our 
work.”

• Challenges: “Dealing with the time difference between the UK and Australia 
when having chats via Skype needs late nights or early mornings online."

Steve Schneider, professor of computing, University of Surrey

• Benefits: “The introduction of electronic voting into Australia provides a 
demanding testbed for the practical application of our research into secure 
electronic voting.”

• Challenges: “Often there can be a 24-hour turnaround on an email exchange, 
and we have to be well-organised and well-prepared for Skype calls, especially 
if they involve our Luxembourg collaborators as well.”

Vanessa Teague <http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vjteague/>, research fellow, 
University of Melbourne

• Benefits: “I like working with colleagues in the UK because we get twice as 
much work done in a week: one side works while the other side sleeps.”

• Challenge: “Funding round-the-world travel is always a challenge, but we've 
managed to finance just enough plane tickets to keep the collaboration going 
well."

professor of human factors in transport safety, Loughborough University

• Benefits: “Loughborough University has a very strong track record of 
collaboration with Monash University as there’s strength in road safety 
research at both of the institutions."

• Challenges: “The fact that we’re separated by several time zones and operate 
in different hemispheres could have been challenging, but we have always 
managed to work extremely well together."

, associate director of regulation and in-depth crash investigations, Monash 
University

• Benefits: "The joint collaboration provides the opportunities for large 
scale collaborations in road safety, providing the critical mass that is 
necessary to address questions that otherwise could not be answered."

• Challenges: "Technology has played an enormous role in shrinking the world 
and has in large part overcome the tyranny of distance that has made this type 
of collaboration in the past difficult."

• Benefits: "Our students can be jointly supervised and mentored by academic 
staff in Manchester and Queensland so they get a great international overview 
of the developments in this area."

• Challenges: "I really enjoy working with collaborators in Australia – I can 
send something off in the evening and next morning a reply is ready and 
waiting. So the time difference actually speeds things up."

Matthew Sanders <http://www.psy.uq.edu.au/directory/index.html?id=33>, 
professor of clinical psychology, University of Queensland

• Benefits: "We have had an excellent collaboration. Skype combined with 
periodic visits and contact at international conferences has allowed for very 
efficient communication with our UK partners."

• Challenges: "The narrow window for communications to take place each day 
means conversations need to be efficient, brief and seriously outcome-focused."

• Benefits: “International exchange operates at all levels, and in my opinion 
is especially beneficial within the context of doctoral and postdoctoral 
training, as it significantly enhances career opportunities.”

• Challenges: “In the face of local workload pressures it is challenging to 
keep up international collaborations, but they are essential if one wants to 
create world-leading research.”

Aleks Owczarek, head of the department of mathematics and statistics, 
University of Melbourne

• Benefits: “The benefits extend far beyond the individual interaction between 
the two researchers but encompass students and departments by creating multiple 
connections.”

• Challenges: “Modern means of communication, such as Skype, do not replace 
intensive face-to-face interactions, which can be a challenge for long-distance 
collaborations.”

• Benefits: "Our mental health services are similar, though have some key 
differences. Our practice-focused research helps us to understand how to work 
more effectively, improve outcomes and learn from each other."

• Challenges: “We want to engage practitioners from both countries in 
real-time discussions about research, but this means being more internet-savvy 
and flexible about when we work during the day."

Lynette Joubert, director of research, department of social work, University 
of Melbourne

• Benefits: "Our collaboration exists on multiple levels, which has also 
extended to a global classroom where Martin participated in a practice research 
class that I was teaching at the University of Melbourne via Skype."

• Challenges: "Seeking opportunities for competitive Anglo-Australian research 
funding is a challenge."

• Benefits: "Researching Australian art in Aberystwyth is easier than you 
might think. There is so much online these days. The Australian libraries are 
way ahead of us in making their archives accessible. And sending an email to 
research colleagues in Melbourne or Perth is just as quick as sending one to a 
person in the next door office."

• Challenges: "It’s difficult to get the necessary funding to develop or 
sustain a collaborative project over the medium to long term. The Leverhume 
Trust does offer an international networks grant to build a new collaborative 
research project with overseas institutions over three years but competition is 
fierce."

Jaynie Anderson, herald chair of fine arts and foundation director of the 
Australian institute of art history, University of Melbourne


• Benefits: "Simon's project is to develop with us a database that will be 
about dealing and the art industry in Australia. We have taught courses on the 
art market but this will be the first time that there will be a permanent 
online research project hosted by the institute."

• Challenges: "In the 21st century long distance collaboration is easier than 
at any other period. When I wrote my undergraduate thesis I had to order key 
articles by microfilm six months in advance, now they are easily available 
online. The arts faculty at the University of Melbourne gives scholars the 
chance to travel abroad to conferences twice a year, if their presentation will 
be published, giving us opportunities to create research networks. Australians 
have in the past not worked very much on European archives for Australian art, 
but this is gradually changing as we break down the tyranny of distance."
