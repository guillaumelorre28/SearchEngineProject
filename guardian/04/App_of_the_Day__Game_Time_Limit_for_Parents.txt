This one is for parents who have trouble getting some time on their own iPad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad>, or retrieving the device their 
kids think is a games console but isactually used for Mummy's very important 
business calls.

Developer Johnny Ixe at XVision <http://xvisionnow.tripod.com/cgi-bin/index.pl>
 says he's used the app on his own daughter and is convinced it provides the 
answer. It's not a complicated idea - it's a password controlled timer. Once 
you (the parent) how much freedom little Jimmy can have with your phone and 
click 'start'. Handover the phone and then let him or her fiddle to his heart's 
content.


On the plus side, it's very easy to use. Install the app, select time, click 
start and you're off. When time's up, the phone will flash a'Time limit: game 
over' sign unless Mum or Dad enters the password. Press 'close', the alarm pops 
up again. Press 'stop alarm' and you're asked for the password.

On the down side, cunning little Jimmy might be well aware of Mummy or Daddy's 
favourite password. Even more, the app doesn't offer which apps to restrict, so 
little Jimmy might be merrily ploughing through Mummy's work email for 20 
minutes rather than flicking angry birds into greenhouses.

It's simple, but a bit too simple. What this app really needs is a second list 
of preferences that let the parent choose from the locally installed apps and 
decide which can be opened and for how long. But otherwise a good idea.

Where: Apple App Store

Do say: Step away from the iPad, little Jimmy.

Don't say: Game Time Limit for Parents? How do parents have time to play 
mobile games?!
