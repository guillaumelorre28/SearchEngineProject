Start-up ideas are like fashion. They have their trends and fads. Currently, 
paid content start-ups seem to be all the rage. Industry heavyweights including 
Rupert Murdoch andMathias Doepfner, CEO of German giant Axel Springer 
<http://news.morningstar.com/newsnet/ViewNews.aspx?article=/DJ/200906190806DOWJONESDJONLINE000567_univ.xml>
, all say that paid content will be part of the revenue mix for content 
companies and news organisations. The question remains what content will news 
organisations and other publishers charge for and how will they charge for it? 
Will it be based on site subscriptions, syndication, micro-payments for 
individual pieces of content – the so-called iTunes model – or something else?

We have seen start-up Kachingle promise to allow people to effortlessly 
support their favourite sites 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/02/internet-startups-kachingle>
 whether those sites are blogs or mainstream media sites. Steve Outing at 
Editor and Publisher has an excellentoverview of Kachingle

 andother companies trying to create payment models 
<http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/stopthepresses_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003986123>
 "with no effort or 'mental transactions' necessary". Outing highlights 
companies such asContenture <http://contenture.com/>, Inamoon 
<http://inamoon.com/> and Payyattention <http://payyattention.com/>. And of 
course, I couldn't mention paid content companies and leave out Stephen Brill 
and former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz's Journalism Online 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/apr/15/newspapers-digital-media>. 
The traditional media big hitters promise to create a suite of tools to help 
people monetise their content, and they have had a number of meetings with US 
newspaper executives.

To this crowded field, we now have Circulate <http://www.circlabs.com/>. 
Longtime newspaper executive Martin Langeveld and Bill Densmore, formerly with 
theMedia Giraffe project <http://www.mediagiraffe.org/WhoWeAre> to "foster 
participatory democracy and community", are involved with the new venture that 
promises to be provide content personalisation and recommendation services for 
people while also helping build new revenue streams for content companies. The 
announcement is a wonderful mix of 1990s and new millennial internet-speak:

With Circulate, you can take a big step into the post-search, Web 3.0 world. 
Circulate is a personal information agent that works just for you.

That much sounds a lot like Feedly <http://www.feedly.com/>, a Firefox plug-in 
that sits on top of Google Reader and provides a personalised daily magazine 
based on your favourite sites mixed with popular news and information sites and 
Twitter and Friendfeed links as well. But to this, they will add revenue tools 
for content creators, including:

• Local branding
• Increased high-value site traffic
• Local advertising on Circulate
• Subscription revenue
• Per-item revenue
• Other forms of commercial revenue

That menu of options speaks to the reality that the answer to the question of 
generating revenue from digital content will most likely be a mix of options 
and not one silver-bullet solution. The power has shifted to the consumer, and 
generating revenue won't be something imposed on consumers but rather a menu of 
choices for consumers.

The immediate issue I see with a service like this is that newspaper companies 
are already nervous that they have ceded too much control over their digital 
advertising to Google. Will they be open to partnering with another digital 
middle-man? Will news organisations prefer to build their own solutions? With 
the current economic climate, do news organisations have a choice?

Someone asked me last week if I had heard about a UK startup along the lines 
of Journalism Online. I haven't. Have you?Drop me an e-mail
