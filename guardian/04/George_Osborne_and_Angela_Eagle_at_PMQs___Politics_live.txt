 * Sterling risks being “considerably” weakened in the event of a Brexit and 
could lose its status as a reserve currency, credit ratings agency Standard and 
Poor’s has warned. As the Press Association reports, the S&P report warned that 
the loss of reserve currency status could push up the cost of government 
borrowing and threaten the UK’s AAA credit rating. The paper said that Brexit 
would be a “step into the unknown” in terms of the trading relationship with 
the rest of the EU. 
 * Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, has said David Cameron is “just 
about on course” for the kind of convincing victory he needs to be able to 
return the UK to politics as normal after the referendum. At a Westminster 
briefing he said:

Absent any eruptions due to terrorism or the eurozone, I would expect, as in 
so many past referendums around the world, the status quo to gain towards the 
end.

So I think David Cameron is on course for a 55% to 60% remain vote. But I 
think 55% is the real winning post because if it’s narrower than that then I 
think the consequences for British politics are pretty dire.

Once you get a gap into double digits in percentage terms then I think you at 
least have a possibility but not a certainty of some kind of return to 
conventional politics.

So I think Cameron is just about on course for what he needs. But with four 
weeks to go, if you make a bet on what I’ve just said, on your own head be it.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Sturgeon sets out her programme for government

Libby Brooks

Nicola Sturgeon has set out her programme for government to the Scottish 
parliament this afternoon, focusing on education and attainment.

Promising to harness consensus, Sturgeon expanded her programme with ideas 
cherry-picked from the manifestos of every other party in the chamber bar the 
Conservatives: a dedicated minister for mental health, as per the Lib Dem 
manifesto, and consideration of a young carers’ allowance as suggested by the 
Greens. One hopes that the Labour idea chosen related to expansion of the 
‘minor ailments service’ at pharmacies is not an indication of how the first 
minister now views the party that once dominated Scottish politics.

Reiterating that education would be “the defining mission of this government”, 
Sturgeon announced a flurry of summits and appointments, including an 
International Council of Education Advisers, a national summit on school reform 
and raising attainment, a commissioner for fair access to further education, 
and the reappointment of an independent poverty adviser.

Sturgeon also described the Scottish government’s ongoing expansion of 
childcare as “the most important infrastructure project of the next 
parliament”, and dwelt once again on the crowd-pleasing manifesto pledge of 
Finland-inspired baby boxes, packed with essentials for new parents.

Concluding with a passage on empowering communities, she said that - at a time 
when the UK government is still considering repeal of the Human Rights Act - 
the Scottish government would work with civic Scotland to establish a set of 
social and economic rights for all of Scotland’s citizens. It will be 
interesting to know how this shapes up, especially after all the discussion of 
a Scottish bill of rights during the referendum campaign.

MSPs are also voting today on a motion to extend future sessions of first 
minister’s questions to 45 minutes, to allow backbench MSPs more opportunity to 
challenge Sturgeon.

Cameron says IFS verdicts are 'accepted by every political party'

David Cameron has recorded a clip for broadcasters during his trip to Japan 
heaping praise on theInstitute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>. He said:

The Institute for Fiscal Studies is the gold standard is the gold standard in 
independent, impartial economic forecasting and commentary in our country. It 
is accepted by every political party.

They couldn’t be clearer. Leaving the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> would be bad for growth, bad for our 
economy, bad for jobs, and bad for families’ finances.

Cameron may suffered a minor memory failure on the flight to Japan because it 
is not true to say that the IFS’s views are “accepted by every political 
party”. There was a good example last autumn when the IFS said that it was 
impossible for the increase in the minimum wage to compensate people losing out 
from the tax credit cuts. A senior Tory went on the Andrew Marr Show to say 
that the IFS was wrong. And who was said senior Tory? (Really, this is too 
easy, isn’t it?)

Here is the key exchange from the Marr interview. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/04/conservative-conference-david-camerons-andrew-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-5610fae8e4b02d70c46aa1ca#block-5610fae8e4b02d70c46aa1ca>

Marr: I’m sorry to butt in, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it is 
arithmetically impossible for that to make up the cut in tax credits.

Cameron: That’s not right. If you take a family where someone is on minimum 
wage, when you take into account all the things we are changing in tax, in the 
national living wage, and tax credits, that family will be better off, not 
least because you’ve got the national living wage, and we are also cutting tax 
so you can earn £11,000 before you start paying any tax at all.

Another delicious consequence of Cameron’s comment today is that for the rest 
of this parliament, when the IFS produces its annual post-budget demolition, 
the IFS’ Paul Johnson will be able to start his press conference with Cameron’s 
words from today.

An annual average of £16.3bn has flowed from the UK to the EU over the last 
five years, according to new figures, the Press Association reports.

Analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that Britain 
made an average net contribution to the EU budget of £7.1bn per year between 
2010-2014 while receiving an average of £5.6bn a year from the EU in credits 
for the public and private sectors for the same period.

Public sector funding included payments to farmers, while private money was 
targeted at areas such as funding research in universities.

When taken together with the UK’s average annual rebate of £3.6bn, this adds 
up to a total of £9.2bn.


The figures are based on data from the European Commission, which the ONS 
argues gives “a more complete picture of the money that flows between the UK 
and the EU”.

Operation Black Vote, which campaigns for equality by encouraging black and 
minority ethnic people to get involved in politics, has produced a poster to 
encourage people to vote in the EU referendum.

OBV said the poster, which is due to be displayed on 37 digital billboards in 
London and Manchester - highlighted the “demonisation of foreigners and people 
of colour” in the campaign. It said:

The campaign shows that their vote carries as much weight as the other, 
frequently more vocal sides of the political spectrum.

Many people feel that this debate, whether it’s the Remain or the Leave camps, 
has been characterised by anger, not much objective information and at times 
the demonisation of foreigners and in particular people of colour.

Our campaign poster illustrates that.

According to the Press Association, around 30% of the around 4m BME voters in 
the UK are not registered to vote. The deadline for eligibility to take part in 
the referendum is June 7.

Lunchtime summary

 * George Osborne has been accused by a Conservative MP of plotting to break 
the law in order to “bludgeon” people into voting in favour of staying in the 
EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/25/tory-mp-accuses-george-osborne-planning-to-break-law-eu-referendum-bernard-jenkin>
 * The Vote Leave campaign has dismissed the respected Institute for Fiscal 
Studiesas a “paid-up propaganda arm” of the European Union after the thinktank 
said that leaving the EU would extend austerity by two years.

Vote Leave’s rebuttal tactics have been criticised by some on the Leave side as 
crude and implausible. For example,Andrew Lilico, chair of the pro-Brexit group 
Economists for Britain, posted these messages on Twitter. Andrew Lilico 
(@andrew_lilico) 
The IFS - for whom I used to work - is not a paid up propaganda arm of the EU. 
I hope that clears that up.

Over-simplified messaging, fear-mongering & controversialism are hard-minded 
campaigning. Accusing folk of corruption & ill intent isn't.

And on the World at One Lilico said Vote Leave should focus on arguing that 
being in the EU was bad for jobs, as unemployment figures in countries like 
Spain showed. He told the programme:

That kind of messaging I think could have made all the difference in this 
campaign ... I just see it as a campaigning failure to put forward simple 
messages that the public had an appetite to hear.

 * Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has set out a six-point 
programme for EU reform, arguing that people need to hear a positive case for 
staying in the EU.(See 11.05am.)

 * Labour’s Dan Jarvis has said the party must make “the hard-headed case to 
remain” in the EU, during a speech to army veterans alongside TV hard-man Ross 
Kemp.

 * The World Trade Organisation has said that if Britain leaves the EU, extra 
tariffs imposed on imported goods could cost the British consumer £9bn. As the 
Press Association reports, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said in an 
interview with the Financial Times that the UK would have to negotiate 
membership of the organisation - as it is currently represented by the EU - and 
trade deals with countries around the world. Here isan extract from the FT’s 
story. 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/745d0ea2-222d-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d.html#axzz49frCFPgO>
An exit from the EU, for example, would cause the UK to lose the preferential 
access to other markets covered by 36 trade agreements with 58 countries 
negotiated by the EU. As a result, to remain compliant with WTO rules the UK 
would have to impose higher “most favoured nation” tariffs on imports from 
those 58 countries while they would have to levy their own surcharges on 
British exports, Mr Azevêdo said.

A WTO analysis had calculated the cost of the additional tariffs on goods 
imports to British consumers at £9bn, while British merchandise exports would 
be subject to a further £5.5bn in tariffs at their destination.

“The consumer in the UK will have to pay those duties. The UK is not in a 
position to decide ‘I’m not charging duties here’. That is impossible. That is 
illegal,” Mr Azevêdo said.

The only other option available to the UK would be removing all barriers for 
all WTO members, effectively turning its economy into a duty-free one like 
Singapore and lifting the protections politically sensitive domestic industries 
enjoy under the EU. “That is possible. But that is also very unlikely,” he said.

 * Former military chiefs have claimed that the UK will be forced into an EU 
army if it stays in the EU.As the Press Association reports, launching the 
Veterans For Britain campaign,Major General Tim Cross insisted the Remain camp 
was talking down Britain’s capabilities. “The Prime Minister and others who 
constantly tell me to be afraid, frankly, speaking soldierly about it, they can 
bugger off. I will not lead my life dominated by fear,” the former commander of 
UK forces in Iraq said. Falklands War veteran Major General Julian Thompson, 
and former SAS chief General Sir Michael Rose, also backed the drive to get 
serving and retired military personnel to support Brexit. 
 * A cross-party coalition of MPs have written to the home secretary, Theresa 
May, to demand an inquiry into alleged police brutality during the miners’ 
strike at Orgreave in Rotherham.

 * Lord Sugar, star of The Apprentice and a former Labour peer, has been 
signed up by David Cameron as his new enterprise tsar, and will launch a 
campaign to encourage young people to start their own business.

 * Sadiq Khan has admitted he has no targets for the number of affordable 
homes he wants to build in London every year.As the Press Association reports, 
the new mayor of London has accused his predecessor Boris Johnson of “leaving 
the cupboard bare” on affordable housing and focused his campaign on tackling 
the housing crisis. Facing a grilling at his first mayor’s question time at 
City Hall, Khan denied claims he had pledged to build 80,000 affordable homes a 
year. He said he has not got a yearly target and is instead focused on 
“building the right kind of homes”. 
 * David Cameron has warned China that it must abide by the outcome of 
international arbitration on its increasingly assertive territorial claims in 
the South China Sea – the cause of bitter disputes with the Philippines and 
other countries in the region.

More than £6.7m of the almost £12m reported to the Electoral Commission between 
January and March went to the Tories. Labour took £3.7m and its sister 
Co-operative Party another £363,000.
The Liberal Democrats’ coffers were swelled by almost £529,000 and Ukip was 
given £187,080, the Press Association reports. Facebook

At PMQs George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> 
welcomed the appointment of Lord Sugar as the government’s new enterprise tsar. 
Labour have been pointing out that Sugar has not been so complimentary about 
Osborne in the past.

This is what Sugar told the Daily Mirror in 2012. 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/lord-sugar-says-george-osborne-1172098>
 At the time he was a Labour peer.

There is an underlying lack of confidence in the current chancellor.

I never rated him in the beginning. I don’t know what his qualifications are 
to be chancellor, but we need someone in there who has got a handle on the 
economics. He’s proving too indecisive.

I don’t know if there is a reshuffle but if I were David Cameron I would 
seriously think about [sacking Osborne].

PMQs - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> on Twitter.

Generally they think Eagle did best, but views are mixed and there seems to be 
a consensus that Osborne is getting better.

From the Times’s Patrick Kidd
Patrick Kidd (@patrick_kidd) 
PMQs was more fun than usual. Osborne's bombast cheered his backbenchers, but 
Eagle, sleeves rolled up, gave him a good biffing.

PMQs - Verdict

PMQs - Verdict: There is a theory that PMQs should be about the leader of the 
opposition holding the prime minister to account, by asking serious questions 
and by expecting him or her to reply to them. It is a proper description of one 
of the functions of parliament, and it helps to explain the approach taken to 
PMQs by Jeremy Corbyn. As regular readers will know, I personally sign up to 
the alternativePMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> thesis, which 
is that it is primarily a forum for asserting political authority, that getting 
answers doesn’t always matter that much, and that a win can be achieved by the 
delivery of a rhetorical clobbering.

Angela Eagle takes this view too, and today she delivered a good example of 
how an opposition leader can use PMQs to taunt and ridicule the government. She 
focused on Google’s tax deal, Tory splits over Europe, the Queens speech and 
the government’s record generally. Little of this will be remembered next week, 
but it was strong, punchy stuff, and Labour MPs will have enjoyed it immensely. 
As I said earlier, she has given better performances from the despatch box. On 
paper, her best line was the one about how David Cameron andGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> “can’t even get their own 
backbenchers to vote for nothing without a fight”, but she did not deliver it 
well, and so you may not hear it on the TV news. But even Eagle at her second 
best is more cheering for Labour than some of the performances they have been 
getting from Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs recently.

Osborne was not squashed, but he was not hugely impressive either, and this 
afternoon is a reminder that taking PMQs is much harder than it looks. He tried 
to discomfort Eagle by asking about Trident, but she parried that easily by 
telling him: “We look forward to the vote on Trident and he should get on with 
it.” Eagle challenged Osborne overEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, partly so that she could use 
the line about how Osborne “agreed with Len McCluskey” and not Priti Patel. 
Interestingly Len McCluskey and Unite are in favour of Trident renewal too, and 
so in this PMQs Osborne was siding with the Unite general secretary on two 
separate issues.

Osborne responded to the Google attacks by challenging Angela Eagle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> to explain what she did 
about this when she was a Treasury minister. This is the kind of attack that 
Osborne used against Ed Balls when he was shadow chancellor, and against Balls 
it worked, because Balls effectively ran the Treasury for many years. But 
against Eagle it did not work. She was a junior Treasury minister, and no one 
can pretend that she is is to blame for the Labour government’s failing. It is 
good example of the value of “clean skins” (or cleanish skins) in politics.

because I was writing the snapPMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> 
verdict, but here is it.

He asked about a Scottish deportation case, covered here by the National. 
<http://www.thenational.scot/news/the-uk-government-want-to-deport-seven-year-old-lachlan-whose-first-language-is-gaelic.15812>

A young Australian boy whose first language is Gaelic faces being kicked out 
of the UK later this month along with his parents, after the Home Office 
rejected their case to stay. Seven-year-old Lachlan Brain and his parents Gregg 
and Kathryn have lived in Dingwall for more than four years and the youngster 
has even competed at the local Mod in Inverness.

But they face being forced out of the country after their application for an 
interim visa was dismissed.

Robertson, the SNP leader at Wesminster, asked what George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> had to say to the family. 
Osborne replied:

As I understand it the family don’t meet the immigration criteria, the Home 
Secretary says she’s very happy to write to the right honourable gentleman 
about the details of this specific case.

Then Robertson said that was not good enough.

The chancellor of the exchequer clearly knew nothing about it. The problem in 
the Highlands of Scotland is not immigration, it has been emigration ... Will 
the chancellor speak to the home secretary, speak to the prime minister, and 
get this sorted out?

Osborne replied:

The home secretary will write to the right honourable gentleman on the details 
of the case, but can I make a suggestion to the SNP - they now have very 
substantial tax and enterprise powers and if they want to attract people to the 
Highlands of Scotland, why don’t they create an entrepreneurial Scotland that 
people want to move to from the rest of the UK where they can grow their 
business and have a successful life.

I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. <https://www.politicshome.com>

Sir Edward Garnier says the Prison Reform Trust published a report saying too 
many children in care end up in the criminal justice system.

Osborne says Garnier speaks very powerfully. The Queen’s speech addresses 
this, he says. And the government is reforming prisons.

 * Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, has said David Cameron is “just 
about on course” for the kind of convincing victory he needs to be able to 
return the UK to politics as normal after the referendum. At a Westminster 
briefing he said:

Absent any eruptions due to terrorism or the eurozone, I would expect, as in 
so many past referendums around the world, the status quo to gain towards the 
end.

So I think David Cameron is on course for a 55% to 60% remain vote. But I 
think 55% is the real winning post because if it’s narrower than that then I 
think the consequences for British politics are pretty dire.

Once you get a gap into double digits in percentage terms then I think you at 
least have a possibility but not a certainty of some kind of return to 
conventional politics.

So I think Cameron is just about on course for what he needs. But with four 
weeks to go, if you make a bet on what I’ve just said, on your own head be it.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments. 

 
Nicola Sturgeon has set out her programme for government to the Scottish 
parliament this afternoon, focusing on education and attainment.

Promising to harness consensus, Sturgeon expanded her programme with ideas 
cherry-picked from the manifestos of every other party in the chamber bar the 
Conservatives: a dedicated minister for mental health, as per the Lib Dem 
manifesto, and consideration of a young carers’ allowance as suggested by the 
Greens. One hopes that the Labour idea chosen related to expansion of the 
‘minor ailments service’ at pharmacies is not an indication of how the first 
minister now views the party that once dominated Scottish politics.

Reiterating that education would be “the defining mission of this government”, 
Sturgeon announced a flurry of summits and appointments, including an 
International Council of Education Advisers, a national summit on school reform 
and raising attainment, a commissioner for fair access to further education, 
and the reappointment of an independent poverty adviser.

Sturgeon also described the Scottish government’s ongoing expansion of 
childcare as “the most important infrastructure project of the next 
parliament”, and dwelt once again on the crowd-pleasing manifesto pledge of 
Finland-inspired baby boxes, packed with essentials for new parents.

Concluding with a passage on empowering communities, she said that - at a time 
when the UK government is still considering repeal of the Human Rights Act - 
the Scottish government would work with civic Scotland to establish a set of 
social and economic rights for all of Scotland’s citizens. It will be 
interesting to know how this shapes up, especially after all the discussion of 
a Scottish bill of rights during the referendum campaign.

MSPs are also voting today on a motion to extend future sessions of first 
minister’s questions to 45 minutes, to allow backbench MSPs more opportunity to 
challenge Sturgeon.

David Cameron has recorded a clip for broadcasters during his trip to Japan 
heaping praise on theInstitute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>. He said:

The Institute for Fiscal Studies is the gold standard is the gold standard in 
independent, impartial economic forecasting and commentary in our country. It 
is accepted by every political party.

They couldn’t be clearer. Leaving the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> would be bad for growth, bad for our 
economy, bad for jobs, and bad for families’ finances.

Cameron may suffered a minor memory failure on the flight to Japan because it 
is not true to say that the IFS’s views are “accepted by every political 
party”. There was a good example last autumn when the IFS said that it was 
impossible for the increase in the minimum wage to compensate people losing out 
from the tax credit cuts. A senior Tory went on the Andrew Marr Show to say 
that the IFS was wrong. And who was said senior Tory? (Really, this is too 
easy, isn’t it?)

Here is the key exchange from the Marr interview. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/04/conservative-conference-david-camerons-andrew-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-5610fae8e4b02d70c46aa1ca#block-5610fae8e4b02d70c46aa1ca>

Marr: I’m sorry to butt in, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it is 
arithmetically impossible for that to make up the cut in tax credits.

Cameron: That’s not right. If you take a family where someone is on minimum 
wage, when you take into account all the things we are changing in tax, in the 
national living wage, and tax credits, that family will be better off, not 
least because you’ve got the national living wage, and we are also cutting tax 
so you can earn £11,000 before you start paying any tax at all.

Another delicious consequence of Cameron’s comment today is that for the rest 
of this parliament, when the IFS produces its annual post-budget demolition, 
the IFS’ Paul Johnson will be able to start his press conference with Cameron’s 
words from today.

An annual average of £16.3bn has flowed from the UK to the EU over the last 
five years, according to new figures, the Press Association reports.

Analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that Britain 
made an average net contribution to the EU budget of £7.1bn per year between 
2010-2014 while receiving an average of £5.6bn a year from the EU in credits 
for the public and private sectors for the same period.

Public sector funding included payments to farmers, while private money was 
targeted at areas such as funding research in universities.

When taken together with the UK’s average annual rebate of £3.6bn, this adds 
up to a total of £9.2bn.


The figures are based on data from the European Commission, which the ONS 
argues gives “a more complete picture of the money that flows between the UK 
and the EU”.
 
Operation Black Vote, which campaigns for equality by encouraging black and 
minority ethnic people to get involved in politics, has produced a poster to 
encourage people to vote in the EU referendum.

OBV said the poster, which is due to be displayed on 37 digital billboards in 
London and Manchester - highlighted the “demonisation of foreigners and people 
of colour” in the campaign. It said:

The campaign shows that their vote carries as much weight as the other, 
frequently more vocal sides of the political spectrum.

Many people feel that this debate, whether it’s the Remain or the Leave camps, 
has been characterised by anger, not much objective information and at times 
the demonisation of foreigners and in particular people of colour.

Our campaign poster illustrates that.

According to the Press Association, around 30% of the around 4m BME voters in 
the UK are not registered to vote. The deadline for eligibility to take part in 
the referendum is June 7.
 
 * George Osborne has been accused by a Conservative MP of plotting to break 
the law in order to “bludgeon” people into voting in favour of staying in the 
EU.

 * The Vote Leave campaign has dismissed the respected Institute for Fiscal 
Studiesas a “paid-up propaganda arm” of the European Union after the thinktank 
said that leaving the EU would extend austerity by two years.

Vote Leave’s rebuttal tactics have been criticised by some on the Leave side as 
crude and implausible. For example,Andrew Lilico, chair of the pro-Brexit group 
Economists for Britain, posted these messages on Twitter. Andrew Lilico 
(@andrew_lilico) 
The IFS - for whom I used to work - is not a paid up propaganda arm of the EU.

And on the World at One Lilico said Vote Leave should focus on arguing that 
being in the EU was bad for jobs, as unemployment figures in countries like 
Spain showed. He told the programme:

That kind of messaging I think could have made all the difference in this 
campaign ... I just see it as a campaigning failure to put forward simple 
messages that the public had an appetite to hear.

 * The World Trade Organisation has said that if Britain leaves the EU, extra 
tariffs imposed on imported goods could cost the British consumer £9bn. As the 
Press Association reports, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said in an 
interview with the Financial Times that the UK would have to negotiate 
membership of the organisation - as it is currently represented by the EU - and 
trade deals with countries around the world. Here isan extract from the FT’s 
story. 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/745d0ea2-222d-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d.html#axzz49frCFPgO>
An exit from the EU, for example, would cause the UK to lose the preferential 
access to other markets covered by 36 trade agreements with 58 countries 
negotiated by the EU. As a result, to remain compliant with WTO rules the UK 
would have to impose higher “most favoured nation” tariffs on imports from 
those 58 countries while they would have to levy their own surcharges on 
British exports, Mr Azevêdo said.

A WTO analysis had calculated the cost of the additional tariffs on goods 
imports to British consumers at £9bn, while British merchandise exports would 
be subject to a further £5.5bn in tariffs at their destination.

“The consumer in the UK will have to pay those duties. The UK is not in a 
position to decide ‘I’m not charging duties here’. That is impossible. That is 
illegal,” Mr Azevêdo said.

The only other option available to the UK would be removing all barriers for 
all WTO members, effectively turning its economy into a duty-free one like 
Singapore and lifting the protections politically sensitive domestic industries 
enjoy under the EU. “That is possible. But that is also very unlikely,” he said.

 * Former military chiefs have claimed that the UK will be forced into an EU 
army if it stays in the EU.As the Press Association reports, launching the 
Veterans For Britain campaign,Major General Tim Cross insisted the Remain camp 
was talking down Britain’s capabilities. “The Prime Minister and others who 
constantly tell me to be afraid, frankly, speaking soldierly about it, they can 
bugger off. I will not lead my life dominated by fear,” the former commander of 
UK forces in Iraq said. Falklands War veteran Major General Julian Thompson, 
and former SAS chief General Sir Michael Rose, also backed the drive to get 
serving and retired military personnel to support Brexit. 
 * A cross-party coalition of MPs have written to the home secretary, Theresa 
May, to demand an inquiry into alleged police brutality during the miners’ 
strike at Orgreave in Rotherham.

 * Sadiq Khan has admitted he has no targets for the number of affordable 
homes he wants to build in London every year.As the Press Association reports, 
the new mayor of London has accused his predecessor Boris Johnson of “leaving 
the cupboard bare” on affordable housing and focused his campaign on tackling 
the housing crisis. Facing a grilling at his first mayor’s question time at 
City Hall, Khan denied claims he had pledged to build 80,000 affordable homes a 
year. He said he has not got a yearly target and is instead focused on 
“building the right kind of homes”.

January and March went to the Tories. Labour took £3.7m and its sister 
Co-operative Party another £363,000.

given £187,080, the Press Association reports.  
At PMQs George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> 
welcomed the appointment of Lord Sugar as the government’s new enterprise tsar. 
Labour have been pointing out that Sugar has not been so complimentary about 
Osborne in the past.

This is what Sugar told the Daily Mirror in 2012. 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/lord-sugar-says-george-osborne-1172098>
 At the time he was a Labour peer.

There is an underlying lack of confidence in the current chancellor.

I never rated him in the beginning. I don’t know what his qualifications are 
to be chancellor, but we need someone in there who has got a handle on the 
economics. He’s proving too indecisive.

I don’t know if there is a reshuffle but if I were David Cameron I would 
seriously think about [sacking Osborne].

Osborne's best outing subbing in for PM - neutralised Eagle's good material

<https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/735435156241125376>  
PMQs - Verdict: There is a theory that PMQs should be about the leader of the 
opposition holding the prime minister to account, by asking serious questions 
and by expecting him or her to reply to them. It is a proper description of one 
of the functions of parliament, and it helps to explain the approach taken to 
PMQs by Jeremy Corbyn. As regular readers will know, I personally sign up to 
the alternativePMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> thesis, which 
is that it is primarily a forum for asserting political authority, that getting 
answers doesn’t always matter that much, and that a win can be achieved by the 
delivery of a rhetorical clobbering.

Angela Eagle takes this view too, and today she delivered a good example of 
how an opposition leader can use PMQs to taunt and ridicule the government. She 
focused on Google’s tax deal, Tory splits over Europe, the Queens speech and 
the government’s record generally. Little of this will be remembered next week, 
but it was strong, punchy stuff, and Labour MPs will have enjoyed it immensely. 
As I said earlier, she has given better performances from the despatch box. On 
paper, her best line was the one about how David Cameron andGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> “can’t even get their own 
backbenchers to vote for nothing without a fight”, but she did not deliver it 
well, and so you may not hear it on the TV news. But even Eagle at her second 
best is more cheering for Labour than some of the performances they have been 
getting from Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs recently.

Osborne was not squashed, but he was not hugely impressive either, and this 
afternoon is a reminder that taking PMQs is much harder than it looks. He tried 
to discomfort Eagle by asking about Trident, but she parried that easily by 
telling him: “We look forward to the vote on Trident and he should get on with 
it.” Eagle challenged Osborne overEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, partly so that she could use 
the line about how Osborne “agreed with Len McCluskey” and not Priti Patel. 
Interestingly Len McCluskey and Unite are in favour of Trident renewal too, and 
so in this PMQs Osborne was siding with the Unite general secretary on two 
separate issues.

Osborne responded to the Google attacks by challenging Angela Eagle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> to explain what she did 
about this when she was a Treasury minister. This is the kind of attack that 
Osborne used against Ed Balls when he was shadow chancellor, and against Balls 
it worked, because Balls effectively ran the Treasury for many years. But 
against Eagle it did not work. She was a junior Treasury minister, and no one 
can pretend that she is is to blame for the Labour government’s failing. It is 
good example of the value of “clean skins” (or cleanish skins) in politics.
 
I missed Angus Robertson’s question during the minute by minute summary, 
because I was writing the snapPMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> 
verdict, but here is it.

He asked about a Scottish deportation case, covered here by the National. 
<http://www.thenational.scot/news/the-uk-government-want-to-deport-seven-year-old-lachlan-whose-first-language-is-gaelic.15812>

A young Australian boy whose first language is Gaelic faces being kicked out 
of the UK later this month along with his parents, after the Home Office 
rejected their case to stay. Seven-year-old Lachlan Brain and his parents Gregg 
and Kathryn have lived in Dingwall for more than four years and the youngster 
has even competed at the local Mod in Inverness.

But they face being forced out of the country after their application for an 
interim visa was dismissed.

Robertson, the SNP leader at Wesminster, asked what George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> had to say to the family. 
Osborne replied:

As I understand it the family don’t meet the immigration criteria, the Home 
Secretary says she’s very happy to write to the right honourable gentleman 
about the details of this specific case.

Then Robertson said that was not good enough.

The chancellor of the exchequer clearly knew nothing about it. The problem in 
the Highlands of Scotland is not immigration, it has been emigration ... Will 
the chancellor speak to the home secretary, speak to the prime minister, and 
get this sorted out?

Osborne replied:

The home secretary will write to the right honourable gentleman on the details 
of the case, but can I make a suggestion to the SNP - they now have very 
substantial tax and enterprise powers and if they want to attract people to the 
Highlands of Scotland, why don’t they create an entrepreneurial Scotland that 
people want to move to from the rest of the UK where they can grow their 
business and have a successful life.

PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> is meant to last half an 
hour. But this one dragged on until 12.42, which could be a record.
 
Labour’s Alan Whitehead asks about a Southampton lettings agency banned for 
not giving tenants their deposits back. But this sector is largely unregulated, 
he says.

Osborne says the government wants to increase protections in this field.
 
Sir Edward Garnier says the Prison Reform Trust published a report saying too 
many children in care end up in the criminal justice system.

Osborne says Garnier speaks very powerfully. The Queen’s speech addresses 
this, he says. And the government is reforming prisons.
 
Osborne says he agrees more needs to be done to help the social care sector. 
It needs to be more integrated with the NHS, he says.
