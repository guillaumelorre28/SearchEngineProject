Amnesty International <https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international>
 has urged the Iranian judiciary to quash a death sentence against a 
22-year-old woman accused of murdering her husband, whom she said had 
repeatedly abused her.

 Zeinab Sekaanvand was arrested in February 2012 and convicted of her 
husband’s murder after what Amnesty called a “grossly unfair trial”. She faces 
execution by hanging as soon as 13 October.

Sekaanvand was 17 when she allegedly committed the crime, making her a minor 
by international legal standards. “This is an extremely disturbing case,” said 
Philip Luther, research and advocacy director for theMiddle East and North 
Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast> at Amnesty International. 
“Not only was Zeinab Sekaanvand under 18 years of age at the time of the crime, 
she was also denied access to a lawyer and says she was tortured after her 
arrest by male police officers through beatings all over her body.”

 Last year a similar case drew condemnation from rights groups when Iran 
executed Fatemeh Salbehi

, who had suffocated her husband after drugging him when she was only 17. Like 
Sekaanvand, Salbehi said her husband had abused her.

In the past decade, Iran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> has executed 
at least 73 juvenile offenders, according to the January Amnesty report. Under 
Iranian law, adulthood is legally determined by puberty, which is defined as 
age 15 for boys and nine for girls. In recent years the judiciary has generally 
postponed executing people until they turn 18.
