The spectre of witchcraft hovered over the March 26 stadium in Bamako last 
night before the home team Mali's semi-final against the African Nations Cup 
favourites Cameroon, though it was probably more a case of partisan policing 
seeking to put the visitors off their game, writes Chris Curtain .

The Cameroonians, who eventually won 3-0 to set up a final against Senegal, 
had threatened not to play after a bizarre pre-match incident when their 
goalkeeping coach Thomas Nkono was led away handcuffed after being pounced on 
by a dozen Malian police.

Nkono, who played for Cameroon in two World Cups, was accused by a policeman 
of dropping "magic" on to the pitch, officials said. He had been standing on 
the sidelines talking to team members and watching the stadium's big screen, 
which was showing pictures from the earlier semi-final, when he was set on, 
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed in full view of spectators.

He was carried off the pitch by at least eight policemen. He then walked over 
to the media area and furiously displayed his handcuffs to the press. He was 
later released and returned sobbing to the team's dressing room.

Cameroon players also clashed with police as they tried to get on to the pitch 
for a walkabout, and claimed that they had been systematically harassed when 
training at the stadium the previous day.
