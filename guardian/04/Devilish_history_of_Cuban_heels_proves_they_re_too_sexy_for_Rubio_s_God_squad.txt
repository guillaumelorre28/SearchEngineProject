On Wednesday, a photo surfaced of presidential candidate Marco Rubio 
hot-stepping in some very flashy footwear. His black leather “Beatle boots” 
with high Cuban heels earned him a hearty round ofpublic mockery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/06/marco-rubio-high-heeled-cute-boots-mocked>
, from his rivals in the race for the Republican presidential nomination and 
political pundits alike.


“They’re straight out of an Austin Powers movie,” said 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCcShMYnczc> MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, laughing 
if not guffawing. “They’re shagalicious!”

And that’s the problem. It’s a matter of juxtaposition: these boots are just 
too sexy for Marco Rubio’s wholesome, God-fearing image.

Marco Rubio has made the critical political mistake of not dressing like a

As the image of him in fuck-me pumps circulated, the Rubio campaign also 
released a remarkably pious televisionad 
<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/06/marco-rubio-courts-christian-conservatives-with-ad>
 in an effort to woo Iowa’s more religious voters. “The purpose of our life is 
to cooperate with God’s plan,” says Rubio, wearing flats.

“To those who much has been given, much is expected. And we will be asked to 
account for that. Were your treasures stored upon earth or in heaven?”

Compare those righteous words to the history of the Cuban heel – a history 
teeming with devilish fornication. These boots were not made for walking, they 
were made for sliding, grooving, strutting. They were made, really, for 
dancing. And as anyone who saw Footloose knows, God does not like dancing. 
Because dancing leads to premarital S-E-X.

Just look at the previous wearers of the style below.

Rubio’s boots are the very essence of rock’n’roll. As legend has it, they were 
invented by none other than the Beatles, who commissionedfour pairs 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatle_boot> of common Chelsea boots with the 
addition of the higher Cuban heel from the London shoemaker Anello & Davide to 
match the suits they’d taken to wearing upon their return to England from 
Germany in 1963.

Like all things Beatle, Cuban-heeled boots swept the mid-60s like a wildfire. 
Soon every rock band breaking in their wake was wearing the style – including 
their friends and rivals, theRolling Stones 
<http://www.billydhenderson.com/wp-content/themes/grunge-music/images/BeatleBoots.jpg]>
. A few years later the Stones would be involved in the notorious “Redlands 
bust”, when they were arrested for drug possession at guitaristKeith Richards’s 
house 
<http://thehistoryofrockmusic.com/1967/02/12/police-raid-keith-richards-redlands-home-in-sussex-for-drugs/>
, with Marianne Faithfull – girlfriend of singer Mick Jagger at the time – 
infamously wearing nothing but a fur rug. (Let’s try to see Rubio pullthat look 
off in cold and windy New Hampshire!)

 John Travolta: the Cuban heel reaches Fever pitch. Photograph: Channel 4 
Picture Publicity 
The opening scene of John Badham’s 1977 movie Saturday Night Fever is perhaps 
the Cuban heel’s most famous moment. The very first thing we see is John 
Travolta as Tony Manero,checking <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfwQ_7xqO7Y> 
his own newly shined boots against a pair he spots in a store window, as he 
carries a bucket of paint through the gritty streets of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. 
Then he gets two slices of pizza, folds them together as one portable meal, and 
struts his way into disco history. Remember: at home, as the movie depicts the 
drama of a devoutly religious Italian family, Tony’s the bad boy, the 
ne’er-do-well; his brother Frank, the favored son, is a priest.

The 1980s brought us another Cuban-heeled antihero, this one from Rubio’s 
hometown of Miami. It wasAl Pacino <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alpacino> 
playing the role this time, in Brian DePalma’s Scarface: the murderous drug 
kingpin Tony Montana.


In light of Pacino’s harrowing intensity, Rubio looks more the Tony Montana 
action figure <http://www.mwctoys.com/images/review_gstscarface_1.jpg]>.

If you want to know how you’re really supposed to rock these boots, look no 
further than the wonderful scene that “McG <http:// 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McG>” (remember him?!) directed in the thoroughly 
enjoyable Charlie’s Angels.

Millionaire tech developer Eric Knox, played by the always-great Sam Rockwell, 
twitches to the boom-bap beat of Pharoahe Monch’s Simon Says, adjusting his red 
shades, smoking heavily, and sliding a gorgeous pair of Cuban heels across his 
own personal dance floor.

He’s got the moves, baby! Up to this point in the movie, we thought that Knox 
was a good guy, the Angels were enlisted to save him from kidnappers, but here 
we learn that he’s in cahoots with the kidnappers! He’s a baddie – and a 
superbad one at that!

What I’m saying is this: Cuban heels are not going to work for Rubio. It’s 
eitherMod Squad <http://reefermadnessmuseum.org/chap08/ModSquadA.jpg> or God 
squad. Can’t have it both ways.
