Nigeria, one of England's World Cup group opponents this summer, have sacked 
their coach. Shaibu Amodu yesterday paid the penalty for a disappointing 
performance at the African Nations Cup in Mali when they were knocked out by 
Senegal in the semi-finals.

Adegboyega Onigbinde, the head of the Nigeria Football Association's technical 
department, will now take the squad to the World Cup where they meet England on 
June 12 in Osaka. Many of Amodu's critics were backing the appointment of a 
foreign coach.

Onigbinde led Nigeria when they were losing finalists in the 1984 African 
Nations Cup in the Ivory Coast. He also coached Trinidad and Tobago in the late 
90s but left after disagreements over money.

Aston Villa have applied to enter the Intertoto Cup for the second successive 
season. John Gregory had expressed reservations about taking part again after 
Villa's last experience, which started in mid-July and took six matches to book 
a place in the Uefa Cup.

But his replacement Graham Taylor is committed to the competition. "European 
football is what we want," he said, "and if we get there through the Intertoto 
Cup then it's something we should try and do."
