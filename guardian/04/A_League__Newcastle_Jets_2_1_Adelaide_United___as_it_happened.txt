Final thoughts

Where to start with that one? Hats off to Newcastle for battling right to the 
end. They’re in the top six now after back-to-back wins and, who knows, with 
confidence building and quality players returning from injury, they might well 
stay up there.

But it was an analysis-defying performance from Adelaide. Did someone hear a 
whistle at the 90-minute mark and figure the game was over? They just seemed to 
clock off. The Reds dominated possession, had several clear chances and towards 
the end had Newcastle on the ropes - yet they got what they deserved purely for 
that bizarre final three minutes.

It’s a long road back for Adelaide from here, but the Jets are already a few 
steps down the same track with the wind behind them.

Thanks for joining me tonight, I’ll catch you next time

Full time: Newcastle Jets 2-1 Adelaide United

Unsurprisingly, that’s it. Newcastle have won it with almost the last kick of 
the game. Duncan at the other end of the pitch looks like a very relieved man.

GOAL! Newcacastle Jets 2-1 Adelaide United

90+4 mins: And that IS the winner! Nordstrand nicks it in injury time, making 
no mistake where his two teammates failed just moments earlier. A clinical 
finish, side-footing it past the keeper into the bottom corner.

89 mins: Late corner for the Jets. Leilei flicks it in but a good punch from 
Galekovic clears the danger. The Jets keep the pressure up but Boogaard commits 
a cynical foul just as the Reds are looking to break away and that’s that.

87 mins: Not long to go, and a share of the spoils would probably be about 
right. Leilei comes on for Nabbout - who deservedly gets a big round of 
applause. He’s been the best player on the pitch.

85 mins: Like new year fireworks in the rain, this game is starting to fizzle 
out. Adelaide look the more likely to nick it - especially as Duncan is clearly 
rattled by that error. If I was Amor, I’d be telling his team to pepper the 
goal from all angles.

82 mins: Adelaide look a lot more confident since that slice of luck to get 
them back in the game. Is that the moment when they get their old magic back 
and charge back up the table? Probably not, but it’s definitely lifted them.

81 mins: Hoffman with a free header at the back post, but the angle is too 
fine and he can only find the sidenetting. It was a definite chance though, he 
might have been put off by his own man (Brown) lurking behind him.

80 mins: Ugarkovic with a glancing header from distance but it’s too high and 
Galekovic watches it sail over the bar. Is there another goal in this game? It 
feels like it, although it’s tough to say who’s more likely to nick it.

75 mins: Some of the fire has gone out of the game, though that might be an 
intentional ploy by Adelaide who are passing it around with a little bit more 
confidence now.

as they look to hit straight back. There’s a bit of a scramble from the second 
one but Adelaide get away with it.

GOAL! Newcastle Jets 1-1 Adelaide United

68 mins: Dear oh dear. A stinker from Duncan. A free-kick from Isaias is 
curled in straight to the keeper’s chest - but instead of catching it, Duncan 
goes for the punch and it flies off the bottom of his fist, hits the deck, then 
bounces into the roof of the net. Adelaide have had enough chances to say they 
deserve that.

64 mins: Time for Adelaide to change things up. The subs are warming up. 
Henrique again very close to going clean through from a curling Carrusca pass - 
but he controls it with his arm.

61 mins: The Jets whip a free-kick into the box - but the referee blows for a 
bit of push and shove and Adelaide are off the hook. The pace has slowed down 
again, though chances are still coming. Boogaard makes a fantastic block to 
deny Guardiola at the back post. It didn’t look pretty but the ball was 
bouncing at an awakward height and he didn’t have many options under pressure.

58 mins: The substitute almost makes an instant impact - catching the defence 
flatfooted (most of them looking to the linesman for help), then cracking a 
shot on the edge of the box straight at the keeper.

55 mins: Carrusca slices one wide for Adelaide. The Jets still look the more 
likely to score but Adelaide have had more than enough chances to get off the 
mark. Newcastle win a corner and Galekovic just manages to punch it to safety 
under pressure.

52 mins: Terrible miss from Hoole. So bad it made me chuckle. The Jets man 
charges into the box full of intent but the final ball slices off the side of 
his boot and flails wide to the relief of Galekovic.

49 mins: Another Jets free-kick after a failed Adelaide counter-attack. They 
play it short, and pass it all the way back to Duncan... who takes a nervous 
touch before passing it out wide. They don’t do defensive passing quite as 
fluently as Adelaide.

47 mins: The Jets still doing all the running, looking more urgent to get it 
up the pitch. Hoole pounces on an error and sets Brown free. He can’t get a 
decent shot away but he still wins a corner.

Second half

Peeeeep! And we’re back. Adelaide with the kick-off and - surprise, surprise - 
they’re happy to play it around the back four. That possession counter keeps 
ticking higher and higher - but the scoreline stays the same.

Right now, I’d say the chances of Adelaide claiming back-to-back titles are 
about as realistic as this.

Where to start with that one? Hats off to Newcastle for battling right to the 
end. They’re in the top six now after back-to-back wins and, who knows, with 
confidence building and quality players returning from injury, they might well 
stay up there.

But it was an analysis-defying performance from Adelaide. Did someone hear a 
whistle at the 90-minute mark and figure the game was over? They just seemed to 
clock off. The Reds dominated possession, had several clear chances and towards 
the end had Newcastle on the ropes - yet they got what they deserved purely for 
that bizarre final three minutes.

It’s a long road back for Adelaide from here, but the Jets are already a few 
steps down the same track with the wind behind them.

Thanks for joining me tonight, I’ll catch you next time
 
Unsurprisingly, that’s it. Newcastle have won it with almost the last kick of 
the game. Duncan at the other end of the pitch looks like a very relieved man.
 
90+4 mins: And that IS the winner! Nordstrand nicks it in injury time, making 
no mistake where his two teammates failed just moments earlier. A clinical 
finish, side-footing it past the keeper into the bottom corner.

90+3 mins: No... THAT should have been the winner! Hoole goes clean through 
but hits the outside of the post. How did he miss?
 
90+2 mins: That should have been the winner! Brown in a one-on-one with the 
keeper but it’s a poor effort straight at Galekovic who blocks it.
 
90+1 mins: Mileusnic comes on for Cirio as Adelaide make a last roll of the 
dice/eat up more time.
 
89 mins: Late corner for the Jets. Leilei flicks it in but a good punch from 
Galekovic clears the danger. The Jets keep the pressure up but Boogaard commits 
a cynical foul just as the Reds are looking to break away and that’s that.
 
87 mins: Not long to go, and a share of the spoils would probably be about 
right. Leilei comes on for Nabbout - who deservedly gets a big round of 
applause. He’s been the best player on the pitch.
 
85 mins: Like new year fireworks in the rain, this game is starting to fizzle 
out. Adelaide look the more likely to nick it - especially as Duncan is clearly 
rattled by that error. If I was Amor, I’d be telling his team to pepper the 
goal from all angles.
 
82 mins: Adelaide look a lot more confident since that slice of luck to get 
them back in the game. Is that the moment when they get their old magic back 
and charge back up the table? Probably not, but it’s definitely lifted them.

81 mins: Hoffman with a free header at the back post, but the angle is too 
fine and he can only find the sidenetting. It was a definite chance though, he 
might have been put off by his own man (Brown) lurking behind him.
 
80 mins: Ugarkovic with a glancing header from distance but it’s too high and 
Galekovic watches it sail over the bar. Is there another goal in this game? It 
feels like it, although it’s tough to say who’s more likely to nick it.
 
78 mins: Kitto comes on for Guardiola as Adelaide finally make that change.
 
77 mins: That goal has changed the whole complexion of the game, there’s a 
little bit of nervousness creeping into the Jets defence.
 
75 mins: Some of the fire has gone out of the game, though that might be an 
intentional ploy by Adelaide who are passing it around with a little bit more 
confidence now.
 
73 mins: The Duncan howler is currently on repeat on my Twitter feed. It get 
worse with every viewing.
 
70 mins: The Jets on the attack at the other end, winning a couple of corners 
as they look to hit straight back. There’s a bit of a scramble from the second 
one but Adelaide get away with it.
 
68 mins: Dear oh dear. A stinker from Duncan. A free-kick from Isaias is 
curled in straight to the keeper’s chest - but instead of catching it, Duncan 
goes for the punch and it flies off the bottom of his fist, hits the deck, then 
bounces into the roof of the net. Adelaide have had enough chances to say they 
deserve that.

66 mins: Adelaide pushing and probing for an opening. A great ball through 
finds Henrique and Hall nicks the back of the legsjuuuust before he reaches the 
box. Free-kick on the left for Adelaide.
 
64 mins: Time for Adelaide to change things up. The subs are warming up. 
Henrique again very close to going clean through from a curling Carrusca pass - 
but he controls it with his arm.
 
61 mins: The Jets whip a free-kick into the box - but the referee blows for a 
bit of push and shove and Adelaide are off the hook. The pace has slowed down 
again, though chances are still coming. Boogaard makes a fantastic block to 
deny Guardiola at the back post. It didn’t look pretty but the ball was 
bouncing at an awakward height and he didn’t have many options under pressure.

Feder/Getty Images  
58 mins: The substitute almost makes an instant impact - catching the defence 
flatfooted (most of them looking to the linesman for help), then cracking a 
shot on the edge of the box straight at the keeper.
 
57 mins: Nordstrand on for Clut as Newcastle make the first change of the game.
 
55 mins: Carrusca slices one wide for Adelaide. The Jets still look the more 
likely to score but Adelaide have had more than enough chances to get off the 
mark. Newcastle win a corner and Galekovic just manages to punch it to safety 
under pressure.

52 mins: Terrible miss from Hoole. So bad it made me chuckle. The Jets man 
charges into the box full of intent but the final ball slices off the side of 
his boot and flails wide to the relief of Galekovic.
 
49 mins: Another Jets free-kick after a failed Adelaide counter-attack. They 
play it short, and pass it all the way back to Duncan... who takes a nervous 
touch before passing it out wide. They don’t do defensive passing quite as 
fluently as Adelaide.
 
47 mins: The Jets still doing all the running, looking more urgent to get it 
up the pitch. Hoole pounces on an error and sets Brown free. He can’t get a 
decent shot away but he still wins a corner.
 
Peeeeep! And we’re back. Adelaide with the kick-off and - surprise, surprise - 
they’re happy to play it around the back four. That possession counter keeps 
ticking higher and higher - but the scoreline stays the same.
 
Right now, I’d say the chances of Adelaide claiming back-to-back titles are 
about as realistic as this.
 
It has been pretty blatant. The Jets would have been clean through a couple of 
times if not for a some cynical trips on the halfway line.
 
The whistle blows and the Jets jog off with their heads up. You can tell which

45 mins: Henrique is cutting a frustrated figure as he gives away an offside. 
A couple of inches and he would have been clean through. That could be their 
last chance of the half.
