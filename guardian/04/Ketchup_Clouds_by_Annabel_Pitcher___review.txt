 Annabel Pitcher, Ketchup Clouds 
Imagine having a deep, dark terrible secret that haunts you everywhere you go 
and everything you do.

Zoe Collins is just an ordinary teenage girl living with her two sisters, Dot 
and Soph, and her parents; but she gets into a complicated situation and 
doesn't know what to do, doesn't know who to tell. Zoe dares to confess until 
she can't keep it in any longer. Desperate to confide in someone, anyone, Zoe 
one day picks up a pen and starts writing letters to Stuart Harris, a man 
locked up on death row in Texas, who she found on the Internet and felt sorry 
for. Letter after letter, Zoe's reveals all her emotions from heartache to 
betrayal and her compelling tale of secrets, lies and guilt

I felt both happiness and sadness, and wasn't able to put this book down. I 
would definitely recommend this novel. An enjoyable read, each part unfolding 
an admissible part to Zoe's tale, with the first letter having you hooked and 
leaving you questioning but wanting more!

Without a doubt I would give Ketchup Clouds five stars!
