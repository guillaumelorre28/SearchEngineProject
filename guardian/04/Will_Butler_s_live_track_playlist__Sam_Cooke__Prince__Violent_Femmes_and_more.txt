Alvino Rey Orchestra – My Buddy 

This is my grandfather playing steel guitar with his big band, taken from a 
live radio broadcast in 1940. Where to start? How about with the strikingly 
beautiful vocoder (technically talk-box, but whatever) performance. But also 
that one emotional brass moment that swells a third of the way in and never 
returns. The ghost of a hi-hat. A piano playing in what sounds like another 
room. The murmur of voices in the background. I swear I hear a bellhop clearing 
dishes at one point. This is essentially an accidental recording, done for 
archival purposes and pulled out years later. They were playing for the folks 
and the room in the folks on the other end of the radio, not for us. But we get 
to listen in, and it’s amazing.

Sam Cooke – Feel It (Don’t Fight It) 

High energy, yet hypnotic. Laid back but tight. Loud but sweet. You can hear 
the vocal mic distort and the drummer dig in, but there’s a fundamental 
lightness that makes you wanna move and makes you wanna groove and makes you 
wanna pat your feet. Don’t fight it – feel it.

Violent Femmes – I Held Her in My Arms 

This song is utterly classic. The first time I heard it, it felt like a song I 
subliminally learned in childhood. Was it someSpringsteen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/19/bruce-springsteen-10-of-the-best>
 orRoy Orbison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/why-roy-orbison-is-one-of-the-rock-n-roll-greats>
 song that I forgot I knew? Nope. This live version from Add It Up (a strange 
kind of greatest hits compilation) is wildly superior to the original album 
version (though, by the way, the original album version is great).

Electrelane – The Partisan

Electrelane <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/14/popandrock> take an 
already great song and make it new. They give it different energy, different 
emotion, different political resonance. It matters that this recording is live 
– it’s raw, it’s tired but hepped up. It matters that there’s an audience – a 
room full of people. They aren’t playing this song for art’s sake. They’re 
trying to communicate face to face.

 in front of an audience, he recorded it, put it on a soundtrack, sold millions 
of copies, won an Oscar and defined the 1980s and defined some people’s whole 
lives and changed the shape of modern music forever.
