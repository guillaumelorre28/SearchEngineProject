In September we hired a car from Avis in Perugia, Italy, but we reversed the 
car into a water hydrant in the hotel car park causing some damage.

We were advised by Avis at the airport that we would receive an email to 
inform us of the cost of a repair prior to any money being deducted from my 
husband’s credit card. We had taken out extra insurance in the UK to cover the 
excess after reading an article in the Guardian about just this eventuality.

We lodged a claim with insurance4carhire. Our credit card bill shows that Avis 
had taken £420 from our card. However, they have not sent the receipt, and 
without it insurance4carhire says we can’t claim.

I have been ringing Avis every week to be told each time that they will 
“urgently” email Italy to obtain said information but nothing has happened.

KD, by email

Another week, another car hire problem. This was, at least, easy to resolve. A 
call to Avis UK’s office may not have resulted in a explanation but it has now 
sent you the invoice.

You did the right thing buying the third party insurance, even though it may 
not feel like it right now.
