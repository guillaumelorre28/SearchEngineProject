2016 was a year full of possibility. From new wireless earbuds to virtual 
assistants built into speakers a lot of what we saw seemed like a glimpse of a 
better future. But what if someone actually made the tech we dream of? Here’s 
the products we’d love to see in 2017.

A full-body Dyson Airblade

Scraping the water off your hands with blades of air is great, but what if 
Dyson’s hand dryer technology could be applied on a larger scale? What better 
way to wake up in the morning than walking out of the shower through a 
human-sized Airblade? From soaking to super in just five seconds. Make it 
happen, Sir James.

A fitness band that makes you fit just by wearing it

 Getting fit in 2017 could look like this Photograph: Alamy 
Fitness bands have long promised a revolution in public health, but simply 
tracking your steps or your heart rate is not really making the strides one 
might hope. Surely a true smart fitness band would do all the work for you so 
you don’t actually have to do anything. Maybe by firing tiny electric pulses or 
something – there must be a way. Slap it on, press a button and be transformed 
into Brad Pitt in Fight Club.

Self-walking shoes

Self-driving cars will be great, but what about that last mile? You step out 
of the car, train, plane or bus and, what, you have to manually walk to your 
destination. Hoverboards exploded, so let’s count them out, but what about 
shoes that know where they’re going? All you’d have to do is take the first 
step and the shoes will do the rest – leaving you safe to stare down at your 
phone without fear of walking into a lamppost.

Waterproof laptops

Waterproof smartphones have been a thing for a few years now. There have even 
been a few waterproof tablets, but why not waterproof laptops? Coffee, beer, 
wine and vodka gets spilled on laptops just as much as tablets and smartphones. 
You (probably) can’t drop a laptop down the toilet, but you can douse it in 
your quad-venti soy latte with hazelnut syrup and whipped cream just as easily 
as you can your phone. Fixing this one is simple. Maybe.

 The world in 2017 needs a real-life Iron Man Photograph: null/PR 
With electric cars, rockets to space and more money than you can shake a stick 
at,Elon Musk <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk> is only lacking 
a mechanical suit in which he can blast into the air with a snarky remark about 
being a billionaire playboy philanthropist. Because with Donald Trump in the 
White House, the world needs a real-life Iron Man with all the trimmings.

Synthahol, the alcohol you can take a pill to get rid of

Silicon Valley has attempted to solve the problem of the human need for food 
with a liquid mulch called Soylent – which eventually made people sick. But 
there’s a first-world problem that needs solving and Sci-Fi has promised a 
solution for decades. Where is the alcohol substitute that you can drink, be 
happy and merry but then take a pill and be genuinely sober within minutes so 
you can just drive home at the end of the night? They have this in Star Trek, 
so why not in 2017?

OK, OK so we know this one is pure fantasy, but indulge us. What if the iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> was slightly thicker so the 
camera lens didn’t stick out of the back and the battery could actually last a 
day? Sorry, we’ve gone beyond the realms of even science fiction, haven’t we?
