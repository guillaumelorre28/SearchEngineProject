Antonio Valencia has signed a new four-year deal with Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. The Ecuador winger is 
now contracted to the Premier League champions until the end of the summer of 
2015.

The 25-year-old's progress last season was stalled by an ankle injury that 
sidelined him for five months, but he made a successful return to the first 
team. He was a stand-out performer as United beat Schalke in the Champions 
League semi-finals and was part of the side defeated by Barcelona in the final.

Competition for places has been increased by the signing of Ashley Young from 
Aston Villa, but Sir Alex Ferguson was delighted to agree terms with Valencia, 
who has scored 10 goals in 69 appearances since joining from Wigan Athletic two 
years ago.

"Antonio has made a fantastic contribution since his arrival," the manager 
said. "His speed, crossing ability and versatility have been a big asset for 
us. He has a quiet, unassuming way of going about his business, which is 
underlined by great strength of character â€“ as his recovery from such a bad 
injury last season proves."

Valencia added: "Since my first day at Carrington, I have been happy here. I 
hope that I can continue to develop as a player. I am looking forward to making 
my contribution to helping this squad compete for more trophies."
