Thank you for sending a message <https://www.theguardian.com/take-action-now> 
to your Member of Parliament (MP).

As your elected representative to Parliament, it is his/her role and duty to 
represent the views of his/her constituents, including yours.

You can play a vital role in influencing the political agenda by informing 
politicians and civil servants and persuading them to act. Gathering support 
can and does lead to lasting change.

Why not get your friends, family and colleagues involved?

Maintain the pressure! The more messages MPs receive, the more an issue will 
get profile and minsters' attention. Encourage your friends, family and 
colleagues to send a message about development aid to their MP by forwarding 
this link to them:www.theguardian.com/take-action-now

Other Things You Can Do

1. Write to your MP
2. Visit your MP
3. Ask your MP to table a Parliamentary Question or Early Day Motion
4. Write to your Member of European Parliament (MEP)
5. Write a letter to your local / national newspaper
6. At school or college

As a constituent your MP has a duty to listen to you and you can request 
him/her to act on your behalf. In this way, MPs create a link between 
government and the public.

In all likelihood your MP will contact the relevant Minister, who will in turn 
reply to them. Sometimes a public statement is made by the Minister. In 
response to an MPs question, letters sent directly to the Foreign Secretary or 
one of his Ministers will likely result in a reply from their civil servants 
which cannot be credited to the Minister.

1. Write to your MP

MPs welcome communication from their constituents and a letter or email is a 
great way to get either a detailed message across or a simple statement of deep 
concern for an issue that requests the MP to act.

You can find out who your MP is and their contact details by visiting 
http://www.theyworkforyou.com <http://www.theyworkforyou.com> and inserting 
your postcode in the box provided.

Please address your letter to your MP and send to either his/her constituency 
address or to the House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA.

• Your letters should just begin with Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms Name, and be signed 
"yours sincerely".
• Find out all you can about the issue, then write a personal, well considered 
response that explains why you care about the issue.
• Write about your own experience if possible 
• Be courteous and respectful – like the rest of us, MPs are not likely to 
respond well to insults!

2. Visit your MP 

Every week your MP holds a surgery in their constituency office focusing 
specifically on their constituents' concerns. This is a great opportunity to 
meet them face to face and outline the issue you care about and find out what 
they can do to raise it in Parliament.

To find out where you MP's constituency office is, click on: 
http://www.theyworkforyou.com <http://www.theyworkforyou.com> and visit their 
website. Contact their office directly to make an appointment if necessary.

Be well prepared
When you meet with your MP, introduce yourself as one of their constituents 
and as someone who has a deep concern about the UK government's role in 
overseas development aid.

Your MP will not expect you to have the same level of understanding and 
knowledge about the issue as a policy specialist but it certainly helps to be 
well prepared and have accurate information available. Print out any of the 
fact sheets available on this website or fromthe following websites 
<https://www.theguardian.com/partners> about the issue you want to discuss. If 
you need further information contact the relevant organisation directly and ask 
for clearer details!

Going to meet your MP might feel intimidating, so why not ask friends to join 
you? This will have a positive impact and help to show additional levels of 
support for the issue.

After you have visited his/her office, it is a good idea to write a follow up 
letter to your MP. Thank them for their time and highlight the points you 
discussed and actions you agreed. This will both help to remind them and also 
let them know that you are watching and waiting for action!

3. Ask your MP to table a Parliamentary Question or Early Day Motion

Parliamentary Questions (PQs)
ORAL PQ's are questions designed to put pressure on the government, for 
signalling concern or for eliciting information. They are submitted to 
ministers to be answered on a particular day. The main advantage of oral 
questions is that they can be followed by a supplementary question which is not 
confined to seeking information. MPs can thus use supplementary questions to 
make a topical
political point that can be seen by all the other MPs and ministers.

WRITTEN PQ's are responded to in writing, and therefore may contain more 
detailed information. If you decide to ask your MP to 'table' a question it is 
important to send him/her concise background information and, if possible, a 
draft for the question. Don't worry about the format; your MP will put the 
question in parliamentary language.

Early Day Motions (EDMs)
EDMs are brief expressions of concern, support or dismay, often about 
something the government has or hasn't done. EDMs are put down in writing by 
one or more MPs, either from the same or from different parties. Other MPs can 
then put their signature to the EDM to signify support.

Issues expressed in EDMs only very rarely lead to a debate, but they can 
encourage government action and provide a focus for lobbying. If a significant 
number of (over 100) signatures are collected, this can be used to attract 
press coverage. Gaining cross-party support for an EDM can make it much more 
effective.

Once an EDM is tabled it is given a number, which you can give to any MP you 
ask to sign it, and which you can use as a reference when enquiring about the 
number of signatures it has attracted.

4. Write to your Member of European Parliament (MEP)

The EU is one of the world's largest donors with more than €50 billion 
allocated to development aid between 2007 and 2013. The Parliament plays a key 
role in scrutinising how this money, our money, is spent by the European 
Commission. In this sense, MEPs have more direct influence than national 
parliamentarians.

Following the European election on 04 June 2009 many new MEPs are in post who 
have not yet been exposed to the issues you care about. This is the perfect 
time to contact them!

Find out who your MEP is and write to them outlining your concerns.
http://www.europarl.org.uk/section/your-meps/your-meps 
<http://www.europarl.org.uk/section/your-meps/your-meps>
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/geoSearch/zoneList.do?country=GB  
<http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/geoSearch/zoneList.do?country=GB>

5. Write a letter to your local / national newspaper 

Sending a letter to the letters' page / editor is another good way of raising 
the profile of an issue. Letters are sent in response to an article that has 
already appeared in the newspaper or in response to another letter. Linking 
international issues with local concerns can increase your chances of getting 
the letter published. It is always worth following up with a phone call to 
check it has been received.

To have the desired impact your letter should:
• Be opinionated but convey the campaign message and statistics
• Be short and to the point – check the number of words
• Include your name and contact details
• Refer to the article or letter you are responding to quoting the writer and 
date

6. At school or college

With half of the world's population under the age of 25, the need for 
meaningful involvement of young people is being increasingly recognised. Young 
people are experts on the needs and interests of their own lives and can be 
active agents of change.

There are many ways you as a young person can raise awareness about an issue - 
in addition to all the ways above, and bring about positive change in support 
of a cause.

At school/college, you could get your fellow students / teachers / colleagues 
involved in various activities:

• Organise a non uniform day (make sure you get permission!) and let other 
students know what you are doing and why you are doing it. This can work really 
well in combination with an assembly.
• Run an assembly and invite a speaker to talk about the issue.
• Organise an event / stall to raise awareness about the issue. 
• Use the school website, school newspaper and social networking sites, such 
as Facebook and Twitter, to spread your message.

Other activities could be to raise money for organisations and projects that 
you think are important, or to organise an online Action Day, providing young 
people, organisations and individuals the opportunity to debate the issue and 
take action together. Let the participants sign a statement / petition that you 
can send to MPs, or to No. 10 Downing St.

The most important thing when advocating and taking action for young people is 
that you should be doing something that you really believe in.

And there is a lot more you can do:
Organise a stall, an event, a public meeting, a screening. You can find more
