Pakistan end Day 2 behind by 412 with 8 wickets in hand

A day for Australia, no doubt, though Pakistan’s current pair fought back well 
through that wicketless last session. Australia started at 365 for 3, with 
Renshaw and Handscomb at the crease. The former fell 16 short of a possible 
double hundred that would have made him one of the youngest to record the feat, 
but that was the only wicket to fall before lunch. The latter went on to make 
his second Test century before late-cutting his own stumps for 110.


It was one of those rare cases where third umpire adjudication is required to 
decide whether someone is bowled. Eventually the footage showed there was 
slight contact between bat and stump. “I probably would have been alright if it 
wasn’t for Spidercam,” Handscomb says ruefully on ABC radio. “I heard something 
but I didn’t feel it on the bat. Looked around and there’s a bail on the 
ground, which isn’t ideal.”

Truth bombs. Australia slogged a few more via Starc, Wade, and Hilton 
Cartwright, who cover drove his first ball in Tests for four, and made a pretty 
decent looking 37, albeit from a very comfortable position starting off. It was 
386 for 4 when he came out, the fourth-highest match position for an Australian 
No6 to commence from in his first match, as opposed to having 8 runs on the 
board when Callum Ferguson came out for his frst bat in Hobart, the lowest ever 
for a debut No6. Those numbers from Twitter stattoSwamp Thing 
<http://twitter.com/sirswampthing>.

That left Pakistan 7 overs to survive before tea, and they muffed it. 
Replacement opener Sharjeel Khan showed why T20 is more his go, out slashing 
for 4, then Babar Azam was railed by a perfect Hazlewood ball that had him leg 
before.

It was down to Younus Khan and Azhar Ali to staunch the flow, and they did so 
with an initially obdurate partnership that expanded as the session went on. 
Younus looked the most comfortable and controlled that he has all series, while 
Azhar went on with his absurd run of form. He’s currently level for the series 
with Steve Smith on 382, and if he makes 9 more tomorrow then he’ll pass Mohsin 
Khan for the most runs by a Pakistani batsman in a Test series in Australia. 
Younus, for his part, is now 147 runs away from the 10,000 mark in Test cricket.

So we’ll resume tomorrow with this pair needing to add another couple of 
sessions to their stand to have any hope of getting back into the match, but 
it’s also a very nice batting pitch and so far a somewhat limited attack. 
Things change quickly in cricket, even when they’re changing very slowly. The 
Sydney Thunder are playing any moment if you want more, and we’ll be back 
tomorrow for Adam Collins and Russell Jackson to guide you through the Test 
OBO, before I return on Day 4 to call Younus’ quintuple century. See ya, Lara.


Can’t wait. Geoff Lemon bidding you farewell from the Guardian, and click the 
match report on your way out the door.

41st over: Pakistan 126-2 (Azhar 58, Younus 64)


Last over of the day. Hazlewood again. I think Smith has missed a trick here, 
his fast bowler is far from at his best. But perhaps there’s no other obvious 
candidate, if Starc is tired and O’Keefe hasn’t produced much danger. Hazlewood 
bowls too straight, and Azhar goes twice through square leg, once for a couple 
of runs, then again, hard and perfectly middled, in the air but safely into a 
large open field for four. Nice way to see off the second-last ball of the day.

40th over: Pakistan 120-2 (Azhar 52, Younus 64)


Drop! So nearly a late wicket, out of nothing, against the run of play. That 
would have filled the Australians with encouragement tonight, but Warner is 
going the wrong way at leg slip. Azhar saw Lyon’s line going down leg and 
glanced it away. Warner saw the shape of the shot and leaned to his left. It 
came much finer to his right, and by the time he saw that, hsi weight was too 
far the wrong way. He straightened his crouching right leg, threw his hand out, 
but could only palm it into the grass. Azhar is suitably unfazed to work a 
single to midwicket a few balls later.

Half century!

39th over: Pakistan 118-2 (Azhar 51, Younus 63)


By now Azhar is prepared to milk Hazlewood. And he does it well, a couple 
through midwicket from the straighter ball, thenopening the face outside off to 
drive three more runs and raise a fifty from 110 balls. Younus produces a 
similar shot for the same number of runs, and the over costs eight.

38th over: Pakistan 110-2 (Azhar 46, Younus 60)


A couple more overs to go. Lyon to Younus, who works three runs through fine 
leg. Azhar blunts one to the leg side. Simon Katich on ABC radio is talking 
about playing for Croatia in the Mediterranean Premier League. Now that would 
be a dream for all cricket-loving humans. A Mighty Ducks story with a 
difference. Here in this game, the Australian bowlers look very ready for the 
day to be done. There’s no sense of late-session menace.

37th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 57)


Josh Hazlewood looks tired with only a couple of voers remaining. his pace is 
down, he just plonking the ball ont the spot. Luckily Azhar is still in a 
defensive frame of mind, and he’s content just to face it out. ABC Grandstand 
statistician Ric Finlay says that if Azhar gets to 76, he’ll be the first 
Pakistani to make 400 in a Test series in Australia.

36th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 57)


Lyon back. Younus greets his third ball with a perfectly placed sweep. There 
are two men out but neither can stop it. Nailed that one, he’s up and running 
now, and has raced past Azhar’s score. But the lights are coming on and the 
clouds are growing gloomy.

Half century!

35th over: Pakistan 102-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 53)

Crack. Starc went very full, and Younus utterly nailed that. It went straight 
at Usman Khawaja in the covers, but on the bounce, and at such speed that it 
flew through the fieldsman’s grasp and away for four.Then another, fifth ball, 
this one not so full, but Younus strode forward and met it on the up, whacking 
it away straighter through wide mid-off, before driving a single from the last 
ball.


He raises fifty with that second boundary, easily his most confident innings 
of the series. That makes 33 career half-centuries for him now, which means 
that if he gets out between here and 99, he’ll ruin his record as being one of 
the very few batsmen in Test history with more centuries than fifties.


Pakistan’s hundred is also up.

34th over: Pakistan 93-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 44)


Another 90-second Steve O’Keefe over, forgive my brevity, but the only result 
is a Younus single from the final ball. He’s sneaking up behind Azhar Ali like 
a pantomime villain.

33rd over: Pakistan 92-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 43)


Remember how I was just praising Younus Khan’s maturity, sense, insight, 
restraint, responsibility and general statesmanlike wisdom against Australia’s 
most dangerous bowler? Well, he starts this over with the foulest widest slog 
you can imagine, going for some trash metres outside off without a hint of 
footwork. Misses it. Thankfully spares himself more strike by getting a single 
to point, and allows Azhar to play the Murtaugh to Younus’ Riggs when it comes 
to defusing the over.

Hello, replays are suggesting that Younus nicked that wide ball. Slight 
disturbance on Snicko. But the Australians didn’t appeal. Just like Pakistan in 
Brisbane. The tables have turned, have they?

32nd over: Pakistan 91-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 42)


Azhar is playing everything to leg, Younus everything through covers. The 
single comes via the first method, then a couple of runs from the latter. 
O’Keefe the bowler as Younus drives one more single to raise his1000th run 
against Australia.


Meanwhile, in the big news from the ground...

31st over: Pakistan 87-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 39)

Starc coming hard in this over, and Younus recognises it. Gets behind the line 
of the ball and keeps it out. Ducks one. Sensible to know when to survive - 
that shot in Starc’s last over could easily have gone awry. Maiden.

30th over: Pakistan 86-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 39)


Identical over: O’Keefe around the wicket, Younus sweeps, Azhar mops up. Just 
the single. The TV heads are talking about India. Shots fired.
Rob Moody (@robelinda2) 
Warne just said Mark Waugh was a great player of spin, but just not against 
India (av 33) or Sri Lanka (24). Smashed Peter Such though.

29th over: Pakistan 86-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 38)


Must be fun times when Hilton and Joel Paris bowl together for Western 
Australia. Anyway, he’s off now, and the slightly more threatening form of 
Mitchell Starc comes back. Younus gets a couple of good balls, then reaches out 
and cracks the square drive away for four, then glances one.

27th over: Pakistan 80-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 32)


“Hey baby, ooh, ahh, I wanna know will you be my girl,” sings a portion of the 
crowd made up of people who you can only hope don’t have girls, for the 
respective sakes of those girls.

Nearly a run-out, meantime, as Cartwright floats down another one and Azhar 
taps to mid off. Younus tries to run, got sent back, is stranded, and guess who 
misses the stumps again with the batsman metres out? And they get two 
overthrows from Renshaw’s second shot at the stumps, before Azhar slaps a 
boundary through midwicket.


Yes, this was from before the second miss.
Brett McKay (@BMcSport) 
Serious question: when did David Warner last hit the stumps with a throw? Is 
it just me, or does he just not hit them very often?

25th over: Pakistan 72-2 (Azhar 37, Younus 31)

Younus flicks a single from Cartwright’s first ball as though he’s so 
disgusted that he can’t bear to face any more. Azhar is happy to: three shots 
straight to the field, before he finally breaks through. Warner can’t magically 
appear to save a half-tracker from being belted through square for four.

Brendan Fawkes has a classy confession. “Re Stuart Laws unbeaten 54 mentioned 
earlier: one of my favourite things as a youngster watching cricket at the Waca 
when Queensland came to play, was yelling abuse at Stuart Law until he told me 
to, ahhh, copulate with myself. Then I would respond with ‘Awww, you’re just 
upset because we’ve got the same Test average’. Not the most juvenile thing 
I’ve done, but pretty close.”

24th over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 33, Younus 30)


Steve O’Keefe. At last. The stocky left-arm spinner. He starts in his natural 
manner, around the wicket at leg stump, but moves across to an off-side line 
after Azhar turns over the strike with a glance. Younus drives a run to mid-off 
and darts with the shot for another single.


See, I’m not the only one.

Younis looks solid. Would love to see him get a 50 #AUSvPAK

23rd over: Pakistan 65-2 (Azhar 32, Younus 29)

Another plinky-plonky over from Cartwright, mostly on the leg stump. Azhar 
bluts a couple, then flicks one. Younus goes under a very slow bouncer. At that 
speed it was almost embarrassing. Not in the league.

22nd over: Pakistan 64-2 (Azhar 31, Younus 29)

The old one-two punch. Azhar tucks the single square against Lyon, Younish 
produces another smooth off-drive for four. He’s starting to look really good, 
Younus. What a difference it would make for Pakistan if one of their leading 
lights could go past 50 and think about what’s next.

21st over: Pakistan 59-2 (Azhar 30, Younus 25)


Hilton Cartwright. The hotel wagon-builder. The name on at least several 
people’s lips after a few runs earlier today. Going to have his first bowl now, 
sensible move by Smith to help ease the debutant into the game early, let his 
nerves dissipate. Bowls his first ball in Tests down leg, then straightens up. 
Slow, about 120 kmh. Azhar produces a lovely, back-foot punch, and Warner 
spares Cartwright from conceding a boundary in his first over by producing a 
100-metre sprint and then possibly hte most perect diving save I’ve ever seen. 
Was lvitating over the ball and flicked it back about an inch from the rope 
before zooming several more metres and crashing into the fence. Commitment? 
Yeah, he was married to that save.


Apparently having Tests and T20 matches in the same city on the same day is a 
bad idea. Said someone conventionally wise.

20th over: Pakistan 56-2 (Azhar 27, Younus 25)

“He came in like a wreeeeeckkking ball,” Miley Cyrus might have sung of Nathan 
‘Nathan’ Lyon’s bowling speed. Actually maybe a cannonball would be better. 
More darts at Azhar, who finds a run via a mis-hit. Last ball though, Younus 
utterly demolishes a cover drive, against the spin, when Lyon slows it up a 
bit. That settles the question, doesn’t it? (Nope.)

19th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 21)


Younus looks in control, in his own weird way. His technique at the best of 
times does have the appearance of a lobster learning to rollerblade, but when 
the rest of his game is working then it can be devastatingly, eternally, 
benumbingly effective. He’s crabbing about to Hazlewood, but covering the line 
when he needs to defend, and twice goes to the fat side of the ground via the 
cover drive for doubles. Raises Paistan’s 50. Looks a lovely batting pitch on 
day two.


“Did not Bob Willis add Dylan to his suite of names because he liked the music 
of Bob Dylan and felt that a man needed three Christian name initials in order 
to captain England?” asks BFW Doherty. “Quite possibly apocryphal but a nice 
story regardless (and has enough verisimilitude about it to be repeated).”

Perhaps he wanted to sound like an internet phrase. NBD FTW FML BRB LOL.

18th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 17)


Lyon still going fast, Younus still waiting back and working his square as he 
did a billion times in the UAE in November 2014. Made a double and two other 
centuries in four innings. Two triple-century makers together at the crease 
right now, in fact.

17th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 16)


Hazlewood back for his 7th over, and Azhar creams an on-drive but Steve 
O’Keefe denies him the runs. Azhar should stick to those straight -bat shots 
though: he tries to pull Hazlewood and isntead gets a bottom edge past his leg 
stump through to the keeper. Reverts to his strenghts and drives two runs 
through cover.

The Australian attempts at singing in the crowd are execrable today. Two or 
three lame players songs on high rotation. Endless Garry work. That’s about it.
Adam Collins (@collinsadam) 
Imagine what the Barmy Army must be thinking at home. They're going to beat 
the Australian equivalent by an innings.#Ashes

16th over: Pakistan 44-2 (Azhar 24, Younus 16)

That’s a better shot! Azhar Ali gets low to Lyon and nails the sweep shot, 
hard through backward square for four. Lovely stuff. Then a far less orthodox 
boundary as Younus drives back to the bowler, Lyon picks up in his 
follow-through and hurls at the stumps. Misses them. Misses Wade.Misses the 
point. Misses out on a tidier over. Four down through long stop, where as 
Alison Mitchell observes on ABC radio, “a child in the stands wryly unfuls a 
Nice Garry banner.”

15th over: Pakistan 34-2 (Azhar 19, Younus 11)

Curious approach from Azhar today. Normally he’s Pakistanman, gobbling up dots 
for fun. But he’s played a few erratic shots today, as though he’s sick of his 
teammates relying on his stability. Four dots from Hazlewood carefully 
negotiated, then Azhar wipes a hook shot at a short ball and top edges it for 
two runs.

14th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Azhar 17, Younus 11)

Lyon is bowling fast, something he’s been criticised for many times before, 
but he’s keeping Younus scoreless. A maiden to the spinner. O’Keefe hasn’t been 
seen since his single exploratory over before lunch.

13th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Azhar 17, Younus 11)


Starc loses his rag - he’s angry when Younus pulls away, then realises that 
the towel in the waistband of his trousers has fallen out during his approach 
to the wicket. Azhar has already glanced two runs and nudged one, then Younus 
goes the other side of the wicket for another single to Warner. Nyah nyah nyah 
nyah nyah.


“Of course, Australia actually has a 4th 3-initial player in this game: 
Stephen Norman John O’Keefe,” comes in the message from Raf (no middle 
initials) Kaplan. Of course, this part of the world is home to the cricketer 
who I consider to have the best triple-initials in history, Stuart Charles 
Glyndwr MacGill. Because SCG MacGill played 8 of his 44 Tests, and took over a 
quarter of his 208 career wickets, at the SydneyCricket

12th over: Pakistan 28-2 (Azhar 14, Younus 10)


Nice, Garry? How long before we get sick of that catchphrase. No doubt some of 
us already are. But the roar echoes around the ground as Lyon comes on for his 
first trundle of the game. The Pakistanis don’t mind, working three singles 
immediately to the leg side. Comfort zone.

11th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 9)


Nearly a run out. But Warner so rarely hits the stumps. I know he did to get 
Rahat Ali in the first innings in Brisbane, but he has a lot of shots for very 
little contact, given he’s otherwise such a good fieldsman. Younus has been 
ducking and weaving against Starc, then Azhar tries to bolt down for a single. 
Younus sends him back, and Azhar was stranded, metres out, but Warner missed 
from short range by a couple of metres. Could probably even have thrown to the 
bowler. Two balls later, Younus glides Starc away for four. Looked good 
superficially, that shot, but still dicey I reckon. All Younus’ weight was on 
his back foot there, hit front one was lifting, he was off balance, but he 
reached outside the line of his off stump and made enough contact. I don’t 
think that was very controlled, even though it ran smoothly away through 
backward point.

10th over: Pakistan 21-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 5)


Weird old shot from Azhar. After defending a couple of full balls from 
Hazlewood, he gets a slightly shorter ball outside off and plays a kind of 
bottom-hand force. Uncontrolled, could have gone anywhere. Didn’t, luckily. A 
maiden.

“Test cricketers with three initials always exude a greater aura of 
permanence, don’t they?” ponders Ian Forth. “Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman, 
Robert George Dylan Willis, Leslie Ethelbert George Ames. Now Australia have 
added not one, not two, but three contributions to the role of honour. Think 
it’ll be a while before we see another Ethelbert, though.”

Spoken directly, because Ian Forth = right. The men he refers to in this 
instance are Steven Peter Devereux Smith, Peter Stephen Patrick Handscomb, and 
Hilton William Raymond Cartwright.

9th over: Pakistan 21-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 5)


Not great signs for Younus against Starc early. Over the wicket, left-arm 
inswing, Starc has the veteran batsman falling over to keep a full ball out, 
then jumping to defend a short one. Either of those methods are liable to lead 
to dismissal, missing the full ball or fending the short one to hand. Twice 
Younus makes contact with the fuller ball and scores two runs square, but it 
still feels dicey to me.

8th over: Pakistan 17-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 1)


Hazlewood to commence after tea, and in a rare moment he doesn’t find his 
perfect line immediately. One to Younus is down leg, one is wide of off, 
another is full and driven for a single. YK, a dodgy starter in this series, is 
allowed off the mark. Azhar Ali, the obdurate rock on which Pakistan’s batting 
is now built, lets the rest of the over run off him like rain.

Seriously though, the fact that Handscomb still hasn’t been out in Tests for a 
score lower than 54 is absurd. If he keeps that up through the India series, 
he’ll raise Lazarus from the dead.


Let me know your favourite bit of the Test if you like. The contest may not be 
there as we’d like, but we’ll find some fun in it yet.

Best part of today for me: The Ballad of Peter Handscomb. Nothing better than 
totally premature talk about batting averages. Adam Voges in our hearts 
forever. I couldn’t work out how to post this photo because I’m smart, but 
here’s the Twitter version.

Poor Peter Handscomb. He flew too close to the sun (average 119.66), now it 
ends in the waves.pic.twitter.com/i754w8GdhY <https://t.co/i754w8GdhY>

Wheel wheel wheel. That’s all the Pakistan bowlers could do this morning, 
while runs stacked up for fun. Then as so often in Test cricket, one team 
having a merry bat-a-thon is followed by another that can’t string a score 
together. Thanks Russell, the teller of truth, for that introduction and for 
taking us through the last two sessions. Geoff with you until stumps. Send me a 
mail thing or a tweet thing, why not.

Tea on day two - Pakistan in trouble at 16-2 replying to 538-8

7th over: Pakistan 16-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 0)

That is tea on day two. I’m not sure what Nathan Lyon is to make of it but 
Steve O’Keefe was honoured with the final over of the session in the form of a 
speculative burst of spin. Azhar was facing and dealt with it well enough, 
defending his way through to the break. That over down, Pakistan now assess an 
awful day of cricket that has seen them hammered from pillar to post in the 
field, then lose two quick wickets in the seven overs available before tea. It 
doesn’t get much worse. Geoff Lemon will be here soon to take you through until 
tea. Give him a warm welcome.

6th over: Pakistan 16-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 0)

You can’t keep Azhar Ali down. Now the in-form opener leans into a straight 
one from Josh Hazlewood and rolls his wrists over a perfectly-timed drive 
through mid-on, which races away to the fence. If Pakistan are to get close to 
Australia’s declared first innings total of 538 he might need get 400 of them.

5th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Azhar 7, Younus 0)

Poor Azhar knows a thing or two about playing a lone hand and gets going again 
after the chaos of Hazlewood’s over to pick up a couple of twos. As all that’s 
happening, my colleague Pádraig Collins informs methere’s a Twitter account for 
communist cats <https://twitter.com/communist_cats?lang=en>. I suppose I 
shouldn’t be surprised.

Hmm...

4th over: Pakistan 6-2 (Azhar 2, Younus 0)

I know we drone on endlessly about Mitchell Starc but Josh Hazlewood is 
Australia’s most valuable Test paceman right now; both strike bowler and master 
of containment. He’s got four slips in place as Younus takes strike here and 
the Pakistan veteran gets a big stride in first up to play his forward defence. 
An over ago Pakistan looked good to reach tea without loss. Now they’re in dire 
straits.

WICKET! Babar lbw Hazlewood 0 (Pakistan 6-2)

Babar goes for a fourth ball duck! This is a shambles for Pakistan now. 
Hazlewood strikes again, nagging away outside the off stump of the new man 
Babar before angling in a yorker and trapping him plumb in front. He has two 
wickets in the over!

close  
A day for Australia, no doubt, though Pakistan’s current pair fought back well 
through that wicketless last session. Australia started at 365 for 3, with 
Renshaw and Handscomb at the crease. The former fell 16 short of a possible 
double hundred that would have made him one of the youngest to record the feat, 
but that was the only wicket to fall before lunch. The latter went on to make 
his second Test century before late-cutting his own stumps for 110.


It was one of those rare cases where third umpire adjudication is required to 
decide whether someone is bowled. Eventually the footage showed there was 
slight contact between bat and stump. “I probably would have been alright if it 
wasn’t for Spidercam,” Handscomb says ruefully on ABC radio. “I heard something 
but I didn’t feel it on the bat. Looked around and there’s a bail on the 
ground, which isn’t ideal.”

Truth bombs. Australia slogged a few more via Starc, Wade, and Hilton 
Cartwright, who cover drove his first ball in Tests for four, and made a pretty 
decent looking 37, albeit from a very comfortable position starting off. It was 
386 for 4 when he came out, the fourth-highest match position for an Australian 
No6 to commence from in his first match, as opposed to having 8 runs on the 
board when Callum Ferguson came out for his frst bat in Hobart, the lowest ever 
for a debut No6. Those numbers from Twitter stattoSwamp Thing 
<http://twitter.com/sirswampthing>.

That left Pakistan 7 overs to survive before tea, and they muffed it. 
Replacement opener Sharjeel Khan showed why T20 is more his go, out slashing 
for 4, then Babar Azam was railed by a perfect Hazlewood ball that had him leg 
before.

It was down to Younus Khan and Azhar Ali to staunch the flow, and they did so 
with an initially obdurate partnership that expanded as the session went on. 
Younus looked the most comfortable and controlled that he has all series, while 
Azhar went on with his absurd run of form. He’s currently level for the series 
with Steve Smith on 382, and if he makes 9 more tomorrow then he’ll pass Mohsin 
Khan for the most runs by a Pakistani batsman in a Test series in Australia. 
Younus, for his part, is now 147 runs away from the 10,000 mark in Test cricket.

So we’ll resume tomorrow with this pair needing to add another couple of 
sessions to their stand to have any hope of getting back into the match, but 
it’s also a very nice batting pitch and so far a somewhat limited attack. 
Things change quickly in cricket, even when they’re changing very slowly. The 
Sydney Thunder are playing any moment if you want more, and we’ll be back 
tomorrow for Adam Collins and Russell Jackson to guide you through the Test 
OBO, before I return on Day 4 to call Younus’ quintuple century. See ya, Lara.


Can’t wait. Geoff Lemon bidding you farewell from the Guardian, and click the

41st over: Pakistan 126-2 (Azhar 58, Younus 64)


Last over of the day. Hazlewood again. I think Smith has missed a trick here, 
his fast bowler is far from at his best. But perhaps there’s no other obvious 
candidate, if Starc is tired and O’Keefe hasn’t produced much danger. Hazlewood 
bowls too straight, and Azhar goes twice through square leg, once for a couple 
of runs, then again, hard and perfectly middled, in the air but safely into a 
large open field for four. Nice way to see off the second-last ball of the day.


 
40th over: Pakistan 120-2 (Azhar 52, Younus 64)


Drop! So nearly a late wicket, out of nothing, against the run of play. That 
would have filled the Australians with encouragement tonight, but Warner is 
going the wrong way at leg slip. Azhar saw Lyon’s line going down leg and 
glanced it away. Warner saw the shape of the shot and leaned to his left. It 
came much finer to his right, and by the time he saw that, hsi weight was too 
far the wrong way. He straightened his crouching right leg, threw his hand out, 
but could only palm it into the grass. Azhar is suitably unfazed to work a 
single to midwicket a few balls later.


 
39th over: Pakistan 118-2 (Azhar 51, Younus 63)


By now Azhar is prepared to milk Hazlewood. And he does it well, a couple 
through midwicket from the straighter ball, thenopening the face outside off to 
drive three more runs and raise a fifty from 110 balls. Younus produces a 
similar shot for the same number of runs, and the over costs eight.


 
38th over: Pakistan 110-2 (Azhar 46, Younus 60)


A couple more overs to go. Lyon to Younus, who works three runs through fine 
leg. Azhar blunts one to the leg side. Simon Katich on ABC radio is talking 
about playing for Croatia in the Mediterranean Premier League. Now that would 
be a dream for all cricket-loving humans. A Mighty Ducks story with a 
difference. Here in this game, the Australian bowlers look very ready for the 
day to be done. There’s no sense of late-session menace.


 
37th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 57)


Josh Hazlewood looks tired with only a couple of voers remaining. his pace is 
down, he just plonking the ball ont the spot. Luckily Azhar is still in a 
defensive frame of mind, and he’s content just to face it out. ABC Grandstand 
statistician Ric Finlay says that if Azhar gets to 76, he’ll be the first 
Pakistani to make 400 in a Test series in Australia.


 
36th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 57)


Lyon back. Younus greets his third ball with a perfectly placed sweep. There 
are two men out but neither can stop it. Nailed that one, he’s up and running 
now, and has raced past Azhar’s score. But the lights are coming on and the 
clouds are growing gloomy.


 
35th over: Pakistan 102-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 53)

Crack. Starc went very full, and Younus utterly nailed that. It went straight 
at Usman Khawaja in the covers, but on the bounce, and at such speed that it 
flew through the fieldsman’s grasp and away for four.Then another, fifth ball, 
this one not so full, but Younus strode forward and met it on the up, whacking 
it away straighter through wide mid-off, before driving a single from the last 
ball.


He raises fifty with that second boundary, easily his most confident innings 
of the series. That makes 33 career half-centuries for him now, which means 
that if he gets out between here and 99, he’ll ruin his record as being one of 
the very few batsmen in Test history with more centuries than fifties.


Pakistan’s hundred is also up.

 
34th over: Pakistan 93-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 44)


Another 90-second Steve O’Keefe over, forgive my brevity, but the only result 
is a Younus single from the final ball. He’s sneaking up behind Azhar Ali like 
a pantomime villain.


 
33rd over: Pakistan 92-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 43)


Remember how I was just praising Younus Khan’s maturity, sense, insight, 
restraint, responsibility and general statesmanlike wisdom against Australia’s 
most dangerous bowler? Well, he starts this over with the foulest widest slog 
you can imagine, going for some trash metres outside off without a hint of 
footwork. Misses it. Thankfully spares himself more strike by getting a single 
to point, and allows Azhar to play the Murtaugh to Younus’ Riggs when it comes 
to defusing the over.

Hello, replays are suggesting that Younus nicked that wide ball. Slight 
disturbance on Snicko. But the Australians didn’t appeal. Just like Pakistan in 
Brisbane. The tables have turned, have they?


 
32nd over: Pakistan 91-2 (Azhar 45, Younus 42)


Azhar is playing everything to leg, Younus everything through covers. The 
single comes via the first method, then a couple of runs from the latter. 
O’Keefe the bowler as Younus drives one more single to raise his1000th run 
against Australia.

31st over: Pakistan 87-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 39)

Starc coming hard in this over, and Younus recognises it. Gets behind the line 
of the ball and keeps it out. Ducks one. Sensible to know when to survive - 
that shot in Starc’s last over could easily have gone awry. Maiden.

 
30th over: Pakistan 86-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 39)


Identical over: O’Keefe around the wicket, Younus sweeps, Azhar mops up. Just 
the single. The TV heads are talking about India. Shots fired.

29th over: Pakistan 86-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 38)


Must be fun times when Hilton and Joel Paris bowl together for Western 
Australia. Anyway, he’s off now, and the slightly more threatening form of 
Mitchell Starc comes back. Younus gets a couple of good balls, then reaches out 
and cracks the square drive away for four, then glances one.

O’Keefe slows up the scoring, Younus happy to wait four balls for one that

27th over: Pakistan 80-2 (Azhar 44, Younus 32)


“Hey baby, ooh, ahh, I wanna know will you be my girl,” sings a portion of the 
crowd made up of people who you can only hope don’t have girls, for the 
respective sakes of those girls.

Nearly a run-out, meantime, as Cartwright floats down another one and Azhar 
taps to mid off. Younus tries to run, got sent back, is stranded, and guess who 
misses the stumps again with the batsman metres out? And they get two 
overthrows from Renshaw’s second shot at the stumps, before Azhar slaps a 
boundary through midwicket.


Yes, this was from before the second miss.
Brett McKay (@BMcSport) 
Serious question: when did David Warner last hit the stumps with a throw? Is 
it just me, or does he just not hit them very often?

More darts from O’Keefe: Younus sweeps one and Azhar flicks one, and we make 
it to drinks.

25th over: Pakistan 72-2 (Azhar 37, Younus 31)

Younus flicks a single from Cartwright’s first ball as though he’s so 
disgusted that he can’t bear to face any more. Azhar is happy to: three shots 
straight to the field, before he finally breaks through. Warner can’t magically 
appear to save a half-tracker from being belted through square for four.

Brendan Fawkes has a classy confession. “Re Stuart Laws unbeaten 54 mentioned 
earlier: one of my favourite things as a youngster watching cricket at the Waca 
when Queensland came to play, was yelling abuse at Stuart Law until he told me 
to, ahhh, copulate with myself. Then I would respond with ‘Awww, you’re just 
upset because we’ve got the same Test average’. Not the most juvenile thing 
I’ve done, but pretty close.”
 
24th over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 33, Younus 30)


Steve O’Keefe. At last. The stocky left-arm spinner. He starts in his natural 
manner, around the wicket at leg stump, but moves across to an off-side line 
after Azhar turns over the strike with a glance. Younus drives a run to mid-off 
and darts with the shot for another single.


See, I’m not the only one.

23rd over: Pakistan 65-2 (Azhar 32, Younus 29)

Another plinky-plonky over from Cartwright, mostly on the leg stump. Azhar 
bluts a couple, then flicks one. Younus goes under a very slow bouncer. At that 
speed it was almost embarrassing. Not in the league.

 
22nd over: Pakistan 64-2 (Azhar 31, Younus 29)

The old one-two punch. Azhar tucks the single square against Lyon, Younish 
produces another smooth off-drive for four. He’s starting to look really good, 
Younus. What a difference it would make for Pakistan if one of their leading 
lights could go past 50 and think about what’s next.

 
21st over: Pakistan 59-2 (Azhar 30, Younus 25)


Hilton Cartwright. The hotel wagon-builder. The name on at least several 
people’s lips after a few runs earlier today. Going to have his first bowl now, 
sensible move by Smith to help ease the debutant into the game early, let his 
nerves dissipate. Bowls his first ball in Tests down leg, then straightens up. 
Slow, about 120 kmh. Azhar produces a lovely, back-foot punch, and Warner 
spares Cartwright from conceding a boundary in his first over by producing a 
100-metre sprint and then possibly hte most perect diving save I’ve ever seen. 
Was lvitating over the ball and flicked it back about an inch from the rope 
before zooming several more metres and crashing into the fence. Commitment? 
Yeah, he was married to that save.


Apparently having Tests and T20 matches in the same city on the same day is a 
bad idea. Said someone conventionally wise.

20th over: Pakistan 56-2 (Azhar 27, Younus 25)

“He came in like a wreeeeeckkking ball,” Miley Cyrus might have sung of Nathan 
‘Nathan’ Lyon’s bowling speed. Actually maybe a cannonball would be better. 
More darts at Azhar, who finds a run via a mis-hit. Last ball though, Younus 
utterly demolishes a cover drive, against the spin, when Lyon slows it up a 
bit. That settles the question, doesn’t it? (Nope.)

Kolbe/Getty Images  
19th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 21)


Younus looks in control, in his own weird way. His technique at the best of 
times does have the appearance of a lobster learning to rollerblade, but when 
the rest of his game is working then it can be devastatingly, eternally, 
benumbingly effective. He’s crabbing about to Hazlewood, but covering the line 
when he needs to defend, and twice goes to the fat side of the ground via the 
cover drive for doubles. Raises Paistan’s 50. Looks a lovely batting pitch on 
day two.


“Did not Bob Willis add Dylan to his suite of names because he liked the music 
of Bob Dylan and felt that a man needed three Christian name initials in order 
to captain England?” asks BFW Doherty. “Quite possibly apocryphal but a nice 
story regardless (and has enough verisimilitude about it to be repeated).”

Perhaps he wanted to sound like an internet phrase. NBD FTW FML BRB LOL.

 
18th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 17)


Lyon still going fast, Younus still waiting back and working his square as he 
did a billion times in the UAE in November 2014. Made a double and two other 
centuries in four innings. Two triple-century makers together at the crease 
right now, in fact.


 
17th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Azhar 26, Younus 16)


Hazlewood back for his 7th over, and Azhar creams an on-drive but Steve 
O’Keefe denies him the runs. Azhar should stick to those straight -bat shots 
though: he tries to pull Hazlewood and isntead gets a bottom edge past his leg 
stump through to the keeper. Reverts to his strenghts and drives two runs 
through cover.

The Australian attempts at singing in the crowd are execrable today. Two or 
three lame players songs on high rotation. Endless Garry work. That’s about it.

16th over: Pakistan 44-2 (Azhar 24, Younus 16)

That’s a better shot! Azhar Ali gets low to Lyon and nails the sweep shot, 
hard through backward square for four. Lovely stuff. Then a far less orthodox 
boundary as Younus drives back to the bowler, Lyon picks up in his 
follow-through and hurls at the stumps. Misses them. Misses Wade.Misses the 
point. Misses out on a tidier over. Four down through long stop, where as 
Alison Mitchell observes on ABC radio, “a child in the stands wryly unfuls a 
Nice Garry banner.”

 
15th over: Pakistan 34-2 (Azhar 19, Younus 11)

Curious approach from Azhar today. Normally he’s Pakistanman, gobbling up dots 
for fun. But he’s played a few erratic shots today, as though he’s sick of his 
teammates relying on his stability. Four dots from Hazlewood carefully 
negotiated, then Azhar wipes a hook shot at a short ball and top edges it for 
two runs.

 
14th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Azhar 17, Younus 11)

Lyon is bowling fast, something he’s been criticised for many times before, 
but he’s keeping Younus scoreless. A maiden to the spinner. O’Keefe hasn’t been 
seen since his single exploratory over before lunch.

Gray/Reuters  
13th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Azhar 17, Younus 11)


Starc loses his rag - he’s angry when Younus pulls away, then realises that 
the towel in the waistband of his trousers has fallen out during his approach 
to the wicket. Azhar has already glanced two runs and nudged one, then Younus 
goes the other side of the wicket for another single to Warner. Nyah nyah nyah 
nyah nyah.


“Of course, Australia actually has a 4th 3-initial player in this game: 
Stephen Norman John O’Keefe,” comes in the message from Raf (no middle 
initials) Kaplan. Of course, this part of the world is home to the cricketer 
who I consider to have the best triple-initials in history, Stuart Charles 
Glyndwr MacGill. Because SCG MacGill played 8 of his 44 Tests, and took over a 
quarter of his 208 career wickets, at the SydneyCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. 





 
12th over: Pakistan 28-2 (Azhar 14, Younus 10)


Nice, Garry? How long before we get sick of that catchphrase. No doubt some of 
us already are. But the roar echoes around the ground as Lyon comes on for his 
first trundle of the game. The Pakistanis don’t mind, working three singles 
immediately to the leg side. Comfort zone.


 
11th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 9)


Nearly a run out. But Warner so rarely hits the stumps. I know he did to get 
Rahat Ali in the first innings in Brisbane, but he has a lot of shots for very 
little contact, given he’s otherwise such a good fieldsman. Younus has been 
ducking and weaving against Starc, then Azhar tries to bolt down for a single. 
Younus sends him back, and Azhar was stranded, metres out, but Warner missed 
from short range by a couple of metres. Could probably even have thrown to the 
bowler. Two balls later, Younus glides Starc away for four. Looked good 
superficially, that shot, but still dicey I reckon. All Younus’ weight was on 
his back foot there, hit front one was lifting, he was off balance, but he 
reached outside the line of his off stump and made enough contact. I don’t 
think that was very controlled, even though it ran smoothly away through

Weird old shot from Azhar. After defending a couple of full balls from 
Hazlewood, he gets a slightly shorter ball outside off and plays a kind of 
bottom-hand force. Uncontrolled, could have gone anywhere. Didn’t, luckily. A 
maiden.

“Test cricketers with three initials always exude a greater aura of 
permanence, don’t they?” ponders Ian Forth. “Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman, 
Robert George Dylan Willis, Leslie Ethelbert George Ames. Now Australia have 
added not one, not two, but three contributions to the role of honour. Think 
it’ll be a while before we see another Ethelbert, though.”

Spoken directly, because Ian Forth = right. The men he refers to in this 
instance are Steven Peter Devereux Smith, Peter Stephen Patrick Handscomb, and 
Hilton William Raymond Cartwright.




 
9th over: Pakistan 21-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 5)


Not great signs for Younus against Starc early. Over the wicket, left-arm 
inswing, Starc has the veteran batsman falling over to keep a full ball out, 
then jumping to defend a short one. Either of those methods are liable to lead 
to dismissal, missing the full ball or fending the short one to hand. Twice 
Younus makes contact with the fuller ball and scores two runs square, but it 
still feels dicey to me.


 
8th over: Pakistan 17-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 1)


Hazlewood to commence after tea, and in a rare moment he doesn’t find his 
perfect line immediately. One to Younus is down leg, one is wide of off, 
another is full and driven for a single. YK, a dodgy starter in this series, is 
allowed off the mark. Azhar Ali, the obdurate rock on which Pakistan’s batting 
is now built, lets the rest of the over run off him like rain.


 
Seriously though, the fact that Handscomb still hasn’t been out in Tests for a 
score lower than 54 is absurd. If he keeps that up through the India series, 
he’ll raise Lazarus from the dead.


Let me know your favourite bit of the Test if you like. The contest may not be 
there as we’d like, but we’ll find some fun in it yet.

 
Best part of today for me: The Ballad of Peter Handscomb. Nothing better than 
totally premature talk about batting averages. Adam Voges in our hearts 
forever. I couldn’t work out how to post this photo because I’m smart, but 
here’s the Twitter version.

Poor Peter Handscomb. He flew too close to the sun (average 119.66), now it 
ends in the waves.pic.twitter.com/i754w8GdhY <https://t.co/i754w8GdhY>

Wheel wheel wheel. That’s all the Pakistan bowlers could do this morning, 
while runs stacked up for fun. Then as so often in Test cricket, one team 
having a merry bat-a-thon is followed by another that can’t string a score 
together. Thanks Russell, the teller of truth, for that introduction and for 
taking us through the last two sessions. Geoff with you until stumps. Send me a 
mail thing or a tweet thing, why not.

 
7th over: Pakistan 16-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 0)

That is tea on day two. I’m not sure what Nathan Lyon is to make of it but 
Steve O’Keefe was honoured with the final over of the session in the form of a 
speculative burst of spin. Azhar was facing and dealt with it well enough, 
defending his way through to the break. That over down, Pakistan now assess an 
awful day of cricket that has seen them hammered from pillar to post in the 
field, then lose two quick wickets in the seven overs available before tea. It 
doesn’t get much worse. Geoff Lemon will be here soon to take you through until 
tea. Give him a warm welcome.
 
6th over: Pakistan 16-2 (Azhar 12, Younus 0)

You can’t keep Azhar Ali down. Now the in-form opener leans into a straight 
one from Josh Hazlewood and rolls his wrists over a perfectly-timed drive 
through mid-on, which races away to the fence. If Pakistan are to get close to 
Australia’s declared first innings total of 538 he might need get 400 of them.
 
5th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Azhar 7, Younus 0)

Poor Azhar knows a thing or two about playing a lone hand and gets going again 
after the chaos of Hazlewood’s over to pick up a couple of twos. As all that’s 
happening, my colleague Pádraig Collins informs methere’s a Twitter account for 
communist cats <https://twitter.com/communist_cats?lang=en>. I suppose I 
shouldn’t be surprised.

Hmm...

4th over: Pakistan 6-2 (Azhar 2, Younus 0)

I know we drone on endlessly about Mitchell Starc but Josh Hazlewood is 
Australia’s most valuable Test paceman right now; both strike bowler and master 
of containment. He’s got four slips in place as Younus takes strike here and 
the Pakistan veteran gets a big stride in first up to play his forward defence. 
An over ago Pakistan looked good to reach tea without loss. Now they’re in dire 
straits.
 
Babar goes for a fourth ball duck! This is a shambles for Pakistan now. 
Hazlewood strikes again, nagging away outside the off stump of the new man 
Babar before angling in a yorker and trapping him plumb in front. He has two 
wickets in the over!
