Lloyd's of London insurers were some of the hardest hit companies on the 
markets this morning, as investors worry about the final bill for the cleanup 
of Hurricane Sandy bearing down on New York City.

On the blue chip index of the FTSE 100, some of the biggest fallers were 
Admiral Group (down 39p, 3.5%, at Â£10.78), Old Mutual (down 3.3p, 1.9%, at 
169.9p), while on the FTSE 250, four of the top ten biggest fallers were 
insurers.

The fallers included Catlin (down 19.1p, 4%, at 454p) Hiscox

Amlin(down 11.9p, 3.2%, at 362.3p), Lancashire (down 27p, 3.2%, at 831p) and 
Beazley (down 4.7p, 2.7%, at 171.3p).

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor said:
 Equity markets have started the week on the back foot, with some traders no 
doubt taken aback by the late decision to suspend electronic trading across a 
number of US exchanges in preparation for hurricane Sandy's arrival.

The hurricane looks set to continue dominating the news agenda and perhaps 
it's no surprise that insurers Aviva, Old Mutual, Prudential and Legal & 
General are some of the biggest losers on the day so far. 
Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital added:
 I think it's fairly natural that the market's fretting a wee bit in terms of 
potential exposure.

It's going to hit the eastern seaboard at some point in the next 24 hours. How 
hard it does and the potential losses are just too difficult at this stage to 
gauge. The market doesn't like that uncertainty and I think that's what's 
moving the prices.
