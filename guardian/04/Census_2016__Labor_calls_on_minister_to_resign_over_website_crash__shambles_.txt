At least one Labor MP has called on the minister responsible for the census to 
resign after the website was unavailable on Tuesday evening due to a denial of 
service attack.

But the shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, first wants an investigation 
to discover how the government andAustralian Bureau of Statistics

botched the census so badly.

The census website was back up at 11.30am on Wednesday but the form could not 
be accessed because the site was “very busy”.

All inquiries to the ABS about when it would be back to normal were referred 
to the federal minister responsible for the census, the small business 
minister, Michael McCormack.

The attacks on the ABS and census will now be investigated by the Australian 
privacy commissioner.

On Wednesday the ABS chief statistician, David Kalisch, told ABC news radio 
the census site was shut down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/09/the-great-australian-census-fail-of-2016-website-crashes-under-load>
 “to protect the the integrity of the data” after a denial of service attack at 
about 7.30pm AEST on Tuesday.

“From the scale of the attack it is clear it is malicious,” he said. “I can 
certainly reassure Australians the data they provided is safe.”

Asked on ABC’s Radio National whether McCormack should resign or be sacked 
over the government’s handling of the census, Leigh said: “Absolutely Labor 
believes there is ministerial accountability.

“But this is less about who keeps jobs and more about getting to the bottom of 
how the government so badly botched the 2016 census.”

Leigh told Guardian Australia there should first be an independent 
investigation and McCormack should consider resigning or be sacked after that.

“The points we’re making are the chief statistician job was vacant for a year 
and the ABS has suffered successive budget cuts,” he said.

Leigh also took aim at the “succession of ministers who have been responsible 
for the census, none of whom have grabbed the bull by the horns”, referring to
his concern they failed to explain changes

 to hold name and address information for four years, up from 18 months.

The Labor senator Sue Lines did not hold off in calling for McCormack to 
resign:

On Wednesday the Australian privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, announced 
he would open an investigation into the ABS with regards to the cyber attacks.

“My first priority is to ensure that no personal information has been 
compromised as a result of these attacks,” he said.

Pilgrim said the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner had been 
briefed on privacy protections and would continue to work with the ABS to 
ensure it was taking appropriate steps to protect personal information.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and McCormack both posted tweets about 
the ease with which they completed the census – in Turnbull’s case just minutes 
before the census form was shut down:

The shadow defence minister, Richard Marles, told Sky News on Wednesday the 
census had been a “shambles from beginning to end”.

“Whoever is responsible for the hacking last night, contingencies should have 
been put in place, there should have been an understanding of the amount of 
volume on the system last night,” he said.

“This has been absolutely hopeless and chaotic, and the census is a very 
important exercise for Australian public policy.”

Marles said the government had to answer for not just the system failure on 
Tuesday but the inability to call and long waits calling the ABS hotline to get 
a paper form.

The ABS said it would provide an update about availability of the census at 
9am on Wednesday but none had been provided by press time.

At 10am respondents attempting to fill in the census were still greeted with a 
message saying: “Thank you for participating in the census. The system is very 
busy at the moment. Please wait for 15 minutes before trying again. Your 
patience and cooperation are appreciated.”
