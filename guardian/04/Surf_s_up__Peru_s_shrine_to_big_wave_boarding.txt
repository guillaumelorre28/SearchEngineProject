Thirty miles south of Lima and well off the tourist trail, Punta Hermosa is 
the go-to summer getaway for Limeños. For decades it has attracted surf 
fanatics in search of the perfect wave. I love visiting, as surfing is so much 
more than just a pastime here – it’s an inherent part of the community, and 
surfers young and old come together to bond over the best breaks in the 
country. They join Peru’s surfing star, Sofía Mulánovich, winner of theWorld 
Surfing Championships in Hawaii in 2004

Punta Hermosa home.

The Kon-Tiki Surfboard Museum is a shrine to Peruvian surf culture. It’s just 
off the beach, and is in the 1950s home of veteran surfer José A Schiaffino 
(father of leading Peruvian chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino, of London’sMalabar

 fame). This is the place to really soak up what surfing means to the locals. 
Kon-Tiki is named after the notorious break that gives Hawaii’s waves a run for 
their money, and visitors are welcomed with pisco sour.

The walls are adorned with surfing memorabilia from Peru’s famous Waikiki Surf 
Club 
<http://spinalsurfer.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/waikiki-surf-club-lima-peru.html>, 
and from around the world, and José guides visitors round his extensive 
collection of vintage and modern surfboards – donated by legends of the sport 
such asNat Young <http://www.worldsurfleague.com/athletes/139/nat-young>, Mark 
Foo and Mulánovich.

 The Kon Tiki Surfboard Museum 
While most historians credit Hawaii as the birthplace of surfing, there is 
evidence that Peru’s first surfers were riding waves 2,000 years ago.

International visitors are rarely aware of how important surfing is in modern 
Peruvian culture – another reason that a visit to Kon-Tiki can add colour to a 
trip.
