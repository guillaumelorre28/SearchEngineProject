Afternoon summary

 * The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has sought to reassure business about the 
potential economic shock of Brexit, unveiling a new guarantee over EU funding 
and promising the referendum result should not result in people becoming poorer 
or less secure.

As Peter Walker reports, speaking to the Conservative party conference in 
Birmingham, Hammond also talked of what he called a pragmatic approach to 
austerity, reiterating that he would not seek a budget surplus by the end of 
this parliament in 2020. Here is my colleaguePhillip Inman’s analysis of the 
speech.

 * The pound sunk to a three-year low against the euro on Monday on worries 
over the UK’s prospects outside the EU, after the government set a timetable 
for Brexit negotiations and fanned fears it would go for a deal that leaves 
Britain excluded from the single market.

education secretary Nicky Morgan has told the Conservative conference.

Richard Adams

Nick Gibb, the schools minister who outlasted his bosses Michael Gove and 
Nicky Morgan at the DfE, gave a careful defence of expanding grammar schools. 
He told a Policy Exchange panel that it would not mean “a return to the 1950s” 
with one in four pupils attending selective schools - suggesting the government 
has more modest aims in terms of the number of new selective schools.

But Rebecca Allen, director of the Education Datalab research unit, argued 
that selection at the age of 11 was a poor means of promoting social mobility. 
“We don’t need a sorting hat at 11,” Allen said.


There were few signs of enthusiasm for grammar schools among conference 
delegates who attended the panel, or at similar events in Birmingham so far. 
Perhaps the issue is less of a winner among party faithful than many people 
assume?

Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Treasury committee, 
has welcomed Philip Hammond’s decision to ditch George Osborne’s fiscal rule. 
He said the government should replace with a longer-term deficit reduction 
target.

The chancellor has sent the right message in his speech today by ditching the 
fiscal rule to maintain stability. We’ve seen numerous rules, targets and 
guidelines which have been too short term and therefore not worth a great deal.

A longer term rule is essential to achieve economic credibility and to signal 
to the markets that there is a plan.

Liam Fox's speech - Summary

The final speech in the conference hall was from Liam Fox, the international 
trade secretary. Much of what he said was similar to what he said in a speech 
last week, making the case for free trade, but there were some new arguments in 
it. Here are the key points.

 * Fox said globalisation offered great opportunities to the UK. 
The phenomenon that we have come to know since the mid-1990s as globalisation 
represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world is increasingly 
compressed economically, culturally and politically.

It brings with it an increasing interdependence that means we cannot insulate 
ourselves from instability in far-flung parts of the global economy.

But it has also brought the chance to share prosperity, liberty and 
empowerment with millions of our fellow human beings across the world who had 
only ever known poverty, hopelessness and oppression.

The ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the 
opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who 
are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us.

Technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance. 

I have often said that if Francis Fukuyama had called his book “the end of 
geography” rather than “the end of history” then he would have been more 
accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves.

I think the term globalisation could almost have been written with Britain in 
mind. It is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the 
world around us for the benefit of all.

 * He said the government should help those at risk of losing out from 
globalisation by focusing on improving people’s skills. 
 * He said “isolationism and protectionism never end well”. 
 * He confirmed that Britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained 
a member of the EU. 
While we remain inside the European Union we are bound by its rules not to 
negotiate any new trade agreements, although we are able to discuss the 
impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach 
with other countries when we leave.

It is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what David Davis 
saidin a ConservativeHome article in July about the Brexit strategy.  
<http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html>
Writing shortly before he became Brexit secretary Davis said:

So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do 
them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to 
immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most 
favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of 
them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months.

So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be 
complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate 
a free trade area massively larger than the EU. Trade deals with the US and 
China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU, and of 
course we will also be seeking deals with Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, India, 
Japan, the UAE, Indonesia – and many others.

 * He said no one should doubt Theresa May’s commitment to Brexit. 
The prime minister has said clearly that Brexit means Brexit – and for those 
who believe it can be indefinitely postponed or that there might be a second 
referendum or that we might stay by some back door mechanism, let me tell you,
Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> is not someone 
who is known for saying anything, other than what she absolutely means.

 * He said he would conduct a joint trip to Africa in the new year with Priti 
Patel, the international development secretary.That was because trade and 
development had to go together, he said. 
A continued focus on good governance, mediated and encouraged by international 
aid and assistance programs, combined with increasing attempts to see a more 
open and liberal trading environment, are our best hope to see grotesque levels 
of poverty consigned to history.

If Andrea Leadsom had not dropped out when she made the final two of the 
Conservative leadership contest, and if Theresa May’s campaign had crashed, 
Leadsom would have been today getting ready for her first conference speech as 
prime minister.

As it was, she ended up as environment secretary. In her speech she focused on 
arguing that “theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> have always been the party 
of the environment” and that Brexit would offer great trade opportunties.

She included just one, self-deprecating reference to the leadership contest.

I don’t know about you, but it seemed to me [Labour’s] leadership election 
dragged on far too long.


If only they’d come to me for advice on how to keep it short.

She also included this odd claim.

I hear that tourists are even buying bottled English countryside air for up to 
£80 a go.

That was a reference to this story in the Daily Mail, 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3433515/Former-public-schoolboy-sells-bottled-AIR-British-countryside-smog-plagued-Chinese-elite-80-go.html>
 which looks a bit like a spoof but which seems to be true.


My colleague Marina Hyde is alarmed.

French and German elections could help UK in Brexit talks, says Redwood

John Redwood, the Conservative former cabinet minister and leading 
Eurosceptic, told a fringe meeting that next year’s elections in France and 
Germany could help the UK negotiate a good Brexit deal.

I think the European elections are a cracking food reason to get on with 
Brexit, because it seems to me that if Hollande and Merkel have got to face the 
electors, they are not going to want to make one of their key planks putting on 
penal tariffs against their exporters into Britain.

And if they did think that was a good wheeze they would soon have their 
equivalent of the CBI and the TUC saying ‘we cannot afford to have any tariffs 
on French cheeses or French wines or German cars into Britain’, because we have 
an awful lot of jobs here and some of them will be in marginal constituencies.

So I say that’s a very good thing. People are the only way of keeping 
governments honest and sensible, so we need to trust the people.

Normally people argue the opposite; that the French and German governments 
will be less willing to offer concessions to the UK, not more willing, when 
they are facing re-election.

In her speech Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, said that, although she 
was an accountant, that did not mean she did not appreciate culture.

As a chartered accountant, I couldn’t help starting this speech with numbers - 
even though some commentators have said that being one means I must have no 
interest in the arts.

Well, I’m really proud I did a maths degree - and I enjoyed working as an 
accountant.

But if you think what I wanted to do after a day of looking at spreadsheets 
was read more spreadsheets…

…then your grip on reality is as weak as Jeremy Corbyn’s.

Accountants are – shock horror – people too. And so we tend to like TV, music, 
film, art, and sport just as much as other people.

I love sport and I’ve been a Manchester City fan all my life – whatever 
division they were in.

I’m a regular at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

 And I have paintings by Moorlands artists such as David Hunt on my wall at 
home.

She also said culture made a vital contribution to the economy.


Tourism is worth more than £60 billion. Creative industries contribute more 
than £87 billion. The fashion industry alone is worth £26 billion.

To give you some context, our revitalised – and very important – automotive 
industry is worth around £19 billion.

Altogether, DCMS [department for culure, media and sport] sectors account for 
more than 13 per cent of ALL of our goods and services.

Well, Karen Bradley is now making you all look pretty silly

Davidson says Scottish Tories won't adopt May's grammar school plans

Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has said that Nicola 
Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, should focus on helping Scotland cope with 
Brexit rather than trying to “wish away” the referendum result.

Speaking to reporters, she said:

There was an acknowledgement that the UK was the member state, the decision 
was a UK-wide decision. [Sturgeon] absolutely bought into that by going down 
south in order to argue to an audience in other parts of the UK that it was a 
UK-wide decision.

She, like me, was on the different side of the argument to the side that won. 
She, like me, is disappointed with the result. But she can’t wish away the idea 
that this is going to happen, because it is going to happen.

Instead of using this as a constitutional chisel, there is work that needs to 
be done to make sure that we get a better deal out of this for Scotland than we 
otherwise might do.

Davidson also said the Tories would not be advocating extending grammar 
schools in Scotland. She said:

It’s not something that I have ever suggested, it’s never been in any 
manifesto in Britain and it won’t be in any manifesto that I write for Scotland 
as long as I am leader of the Scottish Conservative party.

Extending grammars could undermine progress made in improving schools, says 
Nicky Morgan

The government’s plan for new grammar schools risks being a distraction to 
education reforms and could undermine wider progress in improving schools, the 
former education secretary,Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, told a 
fringe meeting.

Speaking at a fringe meeting about inequality in schools, Morgan, who was 
removed from the job byTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> in July, warned that a 
government department “only has so much bandwidth in terms of delivering of 
reform”, and that grammars were an unnecessary diversion. She said:

For me, I do worry that a return to more selection risks undermining the 
progress that we have seen over the course of the last decade in our schools, 
by throwing something else into the education debate, rather than focusing on 
every school offering an excellent education.

Here is Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem economic spokesman, on Philip Hammond’s 
speech.

Philip Hammond’s speech failed to address one simple fact: he has already lost 
the most important battle of his time as chancellor. The Hard Brexit plan set 
out by his boss will damage our economy, kill jobs and blow a hole in our 
finances. Hammond knows it, he even hinted at it, but he won’t come out and be 
honest about it with the British people.

After the Brexit announcement yesterday, today the pound had hit a new three 
year low. Recycled spending on housing, some commons sense of deficit reduction 
and rubbish jokes about Ed Balls won’t cut it. We need real, radical action to 
turn the ship around, and this speech shows thatPhilip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> is incapable of 
delivering it.

Tories should stop being 'complacent' about Corbyn and understand his 
popularity, says Halfon

The Conservatives should not be “complacent” about Jeremy Corbyn, a senior 
Tory told a fringe meeting.As PoliticsHome reports, 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/79537/tory-minister-warns-party-we-must-not-be>
Robert Halfon, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now skills 
minister, said that the Tories needed to work out why Corbyn was so 
inspirational to people. He told the meeting:

When Jeremy Corbyn got re-elected there were too many Conservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> celebrating on Twitter and 
implying that it’s a walk in the park, that we can all go to the Bahamas for 
the next five years, that the 2020 election is already won.

Now, the reason why that is wrong is actually we’re not looking at the much 
deeper meanings of how he won ... Not every one of the 600,000 members who have 
joined the Labour party is a hard-left Trotskyite ... There are also many 
hundreds of thousands of people, I suspect, who have joined the Labour party, 
who support the Labour party, because they believe they have a noble mission 
which is helping working people and helping people on lower incomes.

When we think “oh whoop dee doo, Jeremy Corbyn’s got re-elected” we should 
actually be thinking why are so many young people joining the Labour party? Why 
do they still have a powerful message on the doorstep despite the fact that 
many Conservatives believe they get it wrong? So the first task of the 
Conservative party is we have to be a party with an ethical, moral mission too.

We must not be complacent about the Labour party for one minute.

SNP says Hammond's speech was 'incredibly complacent' given Brexit concerns

Stewart Hosie, the SNP’s Treasury spokesman, has accused Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> of being “incredibly 
complacent” in his speech this morning. Hosie said:

After the chancellor’s summer of silence on Brexit this was an incredibly 
complacent speech.

Alongside the Tories damaging austerity plans they are now planning on taking 
the UK out of the single market, putting jobs, investment and trade at risk. 
The chancellor is set to preside over an act of economic vandalism that is 
simply reckless.

Philip Hammond at least acknowledged there was great uncertainty because of 
his government’s disastrous Brexit vote, but the chancellor had no answers. No 
answers on tariffs; no answers on access to the single market; no answers on 
anything.

The chancellor admitted his own government’s failure to turn around the UK’s 
poor productivity levels but there was no mention of the Conservative 
government’s failure to stimulate it.

George Freeman, the Tory MP who chairs Theresa May’s policy board, implied on 
the World at One that Jeremy Corbyn was taking Labour to the “lunatic fringe”. 
TheConservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> wanted to 
take the “centre ground” of UK politics, he told the programme:

If Jeremy Corbyn is taking the Labour party of to the lunatic fringe of 
politics we will take that centre ground and Theresa has signalled very loud 
and clear there are no no-go areas for 21 century Conservatives. If the Labour 
party won’t speak for those people we will. And we want to look at the hard 
policies that can tackle what we heard in that Brexit vote. Yes, a clear 
message on Europe, but it was a roar as well about a model of growth that isn’t 
working for people in the right way.

Rudd says government not planning to increase immigration from Commonwealth

Amber Rudd, the home secretary, speaking at a Times/Redbox fringe gave little 
away about her department’s progress on what a post-Brexit immigration system 
is going to look like. She did however stress that it was the freedom of 
movement of EU labour rather than of tourists or visitors that she was 
interested in restricting.

She said that the important thing was to restrict the freedom of movement but 
“we must make sure that we do not disadvantage the economy as we do it. There 
are areas where we can reduce immigration without damaging the economy.”

Rudd confirmed that the 2015 Conservative manifesto commitment to reduce net 
migration to the tens of thousands still stands.

The only hint she gave of future immigration policy came when she was asked 
about Vote Leave campaign promises that curbs on EU migration could lead to 
increases in migration from Australia, India and other parts of the 
Commonwealth. She made quite clear that increasing Commonwealth immigration was 
not being considered: “There are no plans to increase immigration from 
Australia. Did somebody promise to increase migration from Australia? Who was 
that?” she asked.

“Oh Mr Johnson again,” she said when she was told it was the foreign secretary.

CBI and IoD back decision to delay deficit reduction

Here is some business reaction to Philip Hammond’s speech.

Generally, business seems happy with the decision to delay deficit reduction, 
but wants more detail from Hammond about his investment plans.

From Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general 
<http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/chancellor-sets-out-right-chapter-headings/>

With the clock now ticking on an EU exit, it’s good to see the government set 
out the right chapter headings on how to boost confidence in our economy. We 
must now hear more on how government will work with business to build an 
inclusive, long-term industrial strategy. The autumn statement must move us 
several steps on to drive future investment and innovation across the country.

The government is right to adopt a more flexible approach to fiscal policy at 
this point, but it remains essential that public finances are sustainable over 
the economic cycle.

From James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors

The chancellor hit the right notes today, talking of boosting house-building, 
investing in technology and innovation and the importance of getting value for 
money from infrastructure. But soon, businesses will need to see this positive 
mood music turn into something more concrete.Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> has between now and the 
autumn statement in November to develop an economic plan that boosts confidence 
and sees business through the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations ...

 Business is prepared to give the government some leeway on the deficit. After 
the referendum, most IoD members agreed with pushing back the target to run a 
budget surplus by the end of the parliament.

From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce

As the UK negotiates its exit from the European Union, Philip Hammond is right 
to reaffirm the need to boost infrastructure, business investment, and to raise 
productivity, while being mindful of reducing the deficit. However, there were 
no substantive details on these, and UK businesses will eagerly await further 
details in the autumn statement.

 * The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has sought to reassure business about the 
potential economic shock of Brexit, unveiling a new guarantee over EU funding 
and promising the referendum result should not result in people becoming poorer 
or less secure. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-vows-to-match-lost-eu-funding-for-business>
As Peter Walker reports, speaking to the Conservative party conference in 
Birmingham, Hammond also talked of what he called a pragmatic approach to 
austerity, reiterating that he would not seek a budget surplus by the end of 
this parliament in 2020. Here is my colleaguePhillip Inman’s analysis of the 
speech. 
Philip Hammond to spend his way out of Brexit fallout

 * The pound sunk to a three-year low against the euro on Monday on worries 
over the UK’s prospects outside the EU, after the government set a timetable 
for Brexit negotiations and fanned fears it would go for a deal that leaves 
Britain excluded from the single market. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade>
 * The European commission has rejected Theresa May’s call for preparatory 
talks on Brexit before the UK’s formal resignation from the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/eu-commission-still-refuses-uk-talks-before-article-50-triggered>
 * The government’s plan to create new grammar schools risks distracting from 
education reforms and could undermine progress in improving schools, the former 
education secretary Nicky Morgan has told the Conservative conference. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-plan-could-undermine-progress>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Nick Gibb, the schools minister who outlasted his bosses Michael Gove and 
Nicky Morgan at the DfE, gave a careful defence of expanding grammar schools. 
He told a Policy Exchange panel that it would not mean “a return to the 1950s” 
with one in four pupils attending selective schools - suggesting the government 
has more modest aims in terms of the number of new selective schools.

But Rebecca Allen, director of the Education Datalab research unit, argued 
that selection at the age of 11 was a poor means of promoting social mobility. 
“We don’t need a sorting hat at 11,” Allen said.


There were few signs of enthusiasm for grammar schools among conference 
delegates who attended the panel, or at similar events in Birmingham so far. 
Perhaps the issue is less of a winner among party faithful than many people 
assume?

 
Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Treasury committee, 
has welcomed Philip Hammond’s decision to ditch George Osborne’s fiscal rule. 
He said the government should replace with a longer-term deficit reduction 
target.

The chancellor has sent the right message in his speech today by ditching the 
fiscal rule to maintain stability. We’ve seen numerous rules, targets and 
guidelines which have been too short term and therefore not worth a great deal.

A longer term rule is essential to achieve economic credibility and to signal 
to the markets that there is a plan.
 
The final speech in the conference hall was from Liam Fox, the international 
trade secretary. Much of what he said was similar to what he said in a speech 
last week, making the case for free trade, but there were some new arguments in 
it. Here are the key points.

 * Fox said globalisation offered great opportunities to the UK. 
The phenomenon that we have come to know since the mid-1990s as globalisation 
represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world is increasingly 
compressed economically, culturally and politically.

It brings with it an increasing interdependence that means we cannot insulate 
ourselves from instability in far-flung parts of the global economy.

But it has also brought the chance to share prosperity, liberty and 
empowerment with millions of our fellow human beings across the world who had 
only ever known poverty, hopelessness and oppression.

The ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the 
opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who 
are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us.

Technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance. 

I have often said that if Francis Fukuyama had called his book “the end of 
geography” rather than “the end of history” then he would have been more 
accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves.

I think the term globalisation could almost have been written with Britain in 
mind. It is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the 
world around us for the benefit of all.

 * He said the government should help those at risk of losing out from 
globalisation by focusing on improving people’s skills. 
 * He said “isolationism and protectionism never end well”. 
 * He confirmed that Britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained 
a member of the EU. 
While we remain inside the European Union we are bound by its rules not to 
negotiate any new trade agreements, although we are able to discuss the 
impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach 
with other countries when we leave.

It is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what David Davis 
saidin a ConservativeHome article in July about the Brexit strategy.  
<http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html>
Writing shortly before he became Brexit secretary Davis said:

So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do 
them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to 
immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most 
favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of 
them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months.

So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be 
complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate 
a free trade area massively larger than the EU. Trade deals with the US and 
China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU, and of 
course we will also be seeking deals with Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, India, 
Japan, the UAE, Indonesia – and many others.

 * He said no one should doubt Theresa May’s commitment to Brexit. 
The prime minister has said clearly that Brexit means Brexit – and for those 
who believe it can be indefinitely postponed or that there might be a second 
referendum or that we might stay by some back door mechanism, let me tell you,
Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> is not someone 
who is known for saying anything, other than what she absolutely means.

 * He said he would conduct a joint trip to Africa in the new year with Priti 
Patel, the international development secretary.That was because trade and 
development had to go together, he said. 
A continued focus on good governance, mediated and encouraged by international 
aid and assistance programs, combined with increasing attempts to see a more 
open and liberal trading environment, are our best hope to see grotesque levels 
of poverty consigned to history.

If Andrea Leadsom had not dropped out when she made the final two of the 
Conservative leadership contest, and if Theresa May’s campaign had crashed, 
Leadsom would have been today getting ready for her first conference speech as 
prime minister.

As it was, she ended up as environment secretary. In her speech she focused on 
arguing that “theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> have always been the party 
of the environment” and that Brexit would offer great trade opportunties.

She included just one, self-deprecating reference to the leadership contest.

I don’t know about you, but it seemed to me [Labour’s] leadership election 
dragged on far too long.


If only they’d come to me for advice on how to keep it short.

She also included this odd claim.

I hear that tourists are even buying bottled English countryside air for up to 
£80 a go.

That was a reference to this story in the Daily Mail, 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3433515/Former-public-schoolboy-sells-bottled-AIR-British-countryside-smog-plagued-Chinese-elite-80-go.html>
 which looks a bit like a spoof but which seems to be true.


My colleague Marina Hyde is alarmed.

John Redwood, the Conservative former cabinet minister and leading 
Eurosceptic, told a fringe meeting that next year’s elections in France and 
Germany could help the UK negotiate a good Brexit deal.

I think the European elections are a cracking food reason to get on with 
Brexit, because it seems to me that if Hollande and Merkel have got to face the 
electors, they are not going to want to make one of their key planks putting on 
penal tariffs against their exporters into Britain.

And if they did think that was a good wheeze they would soon have their 
equivalent of the CBI and the TUC saying ‘we cannot afford to have any tariffs 
on French cheeses or French wines or German cars into Britain’, because we have 
an awful lot of jobs here and some of them will be in marginal constituencies.

So I say that’s a very good thing. People are the only way of keeping 
governments honest and sensible, so we need to trust the people.

Normally people argue the opposite; that the French and German governments 
will be less willing to offer concessions to the UK, not more willing, when 
they are facing re-election.

In her speech Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, said that, although she 
was an accountant, that did not mean she did not appreciate culture.

As a chartered accountant, I couldn’t help starting this speech with numbers - 
even though some commentators have said that being one means I must have no 
interest in the arts.

Well, I’m really proud I did a maths degree - and I enjoyed working as an 
accountant.

But if you think what I wanted to do after a day of looking at spreadsheets 
was read more spreadsheets…

…then your grip on reality is as weak as Jeremy Corbyn’s.

Accountants are – shock horror – people too. And so we tend to like TV, music, 
film, art, and sport just as much as other people.

I love sport and I’ve been a Manchester City fan all my life – whatever 
division they were in.

I’m a regular at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

 And I have paintings by Moorlands artists such as David Hunt on my wall at 
home.

She also said culture made a vital contribution to the economy.


Tourism is worth more than £60 billion. Creative industries contribute more 
than £87 billion. The fashion industry alone is worth £26 billion.

To give you some context, our revitalised – and very important – automotive 
industry is worth around £19 billion.

Altogether, DCMS [department for culure, media and sport] sectors account for 
more than 13 per cent of ALL of our goods and services.

I will post a summary of the highlights (such as they are) shortly.

Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary and surprise runner up in the Tory 
leadership contest, is speaking now.
 
Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has said that Nicola 
Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, should focus on helping Scotland cope with 
Brexit rather than trying to “wish away” the referendum result.

Speaking to reporters, she said:

There was an acknowledgement that the UK was the member state, the decision 
was a UK-wide decision. [Sturgeon] absolutely bought into that by going down 
south in order to argue to an audience in other parts of the UK that it was a 
UK-wide decision.

She, like me, was on the different side of the argument to the side that won. 
She, like me, is disappointed with the result. But she can’t wish away the idea 
that this is going to happen, because it is going to happen.

Instead of using this as a constitutional chisel, there is work that needs to 
be done to make sure that we get a better deal out of this for Scotland than we 
otherwise might do.

Davidson also said the Tories would not be advocating extending grammar 
schools in Scotland. She said:

It’s not something that I have ever suggested, it’s never been in any 
manifesto in Britain and it won’t be in any manifesto that I write for Scotland 
as long as I am leader of the Scottish Conservative party.

The government’s plan for new grammar schools risks being a distraction to 
education reforms and could undermine wider progress in improving schools, the 
former education secretary,Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, told a 
fringe meeting.

Speaking at a fringe meeting about inequality in schools, Morgan, who was 
removed from the job byTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> in July, warned that a 
government department “only has so much bandwidth in terms of delivering of 
reform”, and that grammars were an unnecessary diversion. She said:

For me, I do worry that a return to more selection risks undermining the 
progress that we have seen over the course of the last decade in our schools, 
by throwing something else into the education debate, rather than focusing on 
every school offering an excellent education.
 
Here is Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem economic spokesman, on Philip Hammond’s 
speech.

Philip Hammond’s speech failed to address one simple fact: he has already lost 
the most important battle of his time as chancellor. The Hard Brexit plan set 
out by his boss will damage our economy, kill jobs and blow a hole in our 
finances. Hammond knows it, he even hinted at it, but he won’t come out and be 
honest about it with the British people.

After the Brexit announcement yesterday, today the pound had hit a new three 
year low. Recycled spending on housing, some commons sense of deficit reduction 
and rubbish jokes about Ed Balls won’t cut it. We need real, radical action to 
turn the ship around, and this speech shows thatPhilip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> is incapable of 
delivering it.
 
The Conservatives should not be “complacent” about Jeremy Corbyn, a senior 
Tory told a fringe meeting.As PoliticsHome reports, 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/79537/tory-minister-warns-party-we-must-not-be>
Robert Halfon, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now skills 
minister, said that the Tories needed to work out why Corbyn was so 
inspirational to people. He told the meeting:

When Jeremy Corbyn got re-elected there were too many Conservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> celebrating on Twitter and 
implying that it’s a walk in the park, that we can all go to the Bahamas for 
the next five years, that the 2020 election is already won.

Now, the reason why that is wrong is actually we’re not looking at the much 
deeper meanings of how he won ... Not every one of the 600,000 members who have 
joined the Labour party is a hard-left Trotskyite ... There are also many 
hundreds of thousands of people, I suspect, who have joined the Labour party, 
who support the Labour party, because they believe they have a noble mission 
which is helping working people and helping people on lower incomes.

When we think “oh whoop dee doo, Jeremy Corbyn’s got re-elected” we should 
actually be thinking why are so many young people joining the Labour party? Why 
do they still have a powerful message on the doorstep despite the fact that 
many Conservatives believe they get it wrong? So the first task of the 
Conservative party is we have to be a party with an ethical, moral mission too.

We must not be complacent about the Labour party for one minute.

Stewart Hosie, the SNP’s Treasury spokesman, has accused Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> of being “incredibly 
complacent” in his speech this morning. Hosie said:

After the chancellor’s summer of silence on Brexit this was an incredibly 
complacent speech.

Alongside the Tories damaging austerity plans they are now planning on taking 
the UK out of the single market, putting jobs, investment and trade at risk. 
The chancellor is set to preside over an act of economic vandalism that is 
simply reckless.

Philip Hammond at least acknowledged there was great uncertainty because of 
his government’s disastrous Brexit vote, but the chancellor had no answers. No 
answers on tariffs; no answers on access to the single market; no answers on 
anything.

The chancellor admitted his own government’s failure to turn around the UK’s 
poor productivity levels but there was no mention of the Conservative 
government’s failure to stimulate it.
 
George Freeman, the Tory MP who chairs Theresa May’s policy board, implied on 
the World at One that Jeremy Corbyn was taking Labour to the “lunatic fringe”. 
TheConservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> wanted to 
take the “centre ground” of UK politics, he told the programme:

If Jeremy Corbyn is taking the Labour party of to the lunatic fringe of 
politics we will take that centre ground and Theresa has signalled very loud 
and clear there are no no-go areas for 21 century Conservatives. If the Labour 
party won’t speak for those people we will. And we want to look at the hard 
policies that can tackle what we heard in that Brexit vote. Yes, a clear 
message on Europe, but it was a roar as well about a model of growth that isn’t 
working for people in the right way.
 
Amber Rudd, the home secretary, speaking at a Times/Redbox fringe gave little 
away about her department’s progress on what a post-Brexit immigration system 
is going to look like. She did however stress that it was the freedom of 
movement of EU labour rather than of tourists or visitors that she was 
interested in restricting.

She said that the important thing was to restrict the freedom of movement but 
“we must make sure that we do not disadvantage the economy as we do it. There 
are areas where we can reduce immigration without damaging the economy.”

Rudd confirmed that the 2015 Conservative manifesto commitment to reduce net 
migration to the tens of thousands still stands.

The only hint she gave of future immigration policy came when she was asked 
about Vote Leave campaign promises that curbs on EU migration could lead to 
increases in migration from Australia, India and other parts of the 
Commonwealth. She made quite clear that increasing Commonwealth immigration was 
not being considered: “There are no plans to increase immigration from 
Australia. Did somebody promise to increase migration from Australia? Who was 
that?” she asked.

“Oh Mr Johnson again,” she said when she was told it was the foreign secretary.

Here is some business reaction to Philip Hammond’s speech.

Generally, business seems happy with the decision to delay deficit reduction, 
but wants more detail from Hammond about his investment plans.

From Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general 
<http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/chancellor-sets-out-right-chapter-headings/>

With the clock now ticking on an EU exit, it’s good to see the government set 
out the right chapter headings on how to boost confidence in our economy. We 
must now hear more on how government will work with business to build an 
inclusive, long-term industrial strategy. The autumn statement must move us 
several steps on to drive future investment and innovation across the country.

The government is right to adopt a more flexible approach to fiscal policy at 
this point, but it remains essential that public finances are sustainable over 
the economic cycle.

From James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors

The chancellor hit the right notes today, talking of boosting house-building, 
investing in technology and innovation and the importance of getting value for 
money from infrastructure. But soon, businesses will need to see this positive 
mood music turn into something more concrete.Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> has between now and the 
autumn statement in November to develop an economic plan that boosts confidence 
and sees business through the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations ...

 Business is prepared to give the government some leeway on the deficit. After 
the referendum, most IoD members agreed with pushing back the target to run a 
budget surplus by the end of the parliament.

From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce

As the UK negotiates its exit from the European Union, Philip Hammond is right 
to reaffirm the need to boost infrastructure, business investment, and to raise 
productivity, while being mindful of reducing the deficit. However, there were 
no substantive details on these, and UK businesses will eagerly await further 
details in the autumn statement.
