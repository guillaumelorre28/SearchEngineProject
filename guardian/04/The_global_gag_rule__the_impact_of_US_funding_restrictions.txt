Just two days into his first term of office, on January 22 2001, President 
George Bush reintroduced a policy known as the "global gag rule". This policy 
restricts foreign NGOs that receive US family planning funds from using their 
own, non-US funds to provide or advocate for legal abortion services.

In Ethiopia thousands of NGOs found their funding slashed immediately as a 
result. "Prior to 2001 we got USAid funding specifically for our community 
healthcare programme, which is not at all associated with the provision of 
abortion services," Getachew Bekele of MSI Ethiopia explains. "But simply 
because we stand in principle for abortion rights the money was withdrawn, 
which meant that we had to scale down our programmes."

The UK Department for International Development and other donors have stepped 
up to provide a counterbalance to this policy and ensure that support is 
provided to help improve access to services to help stop unsafe abortion. DFID 
has contributed of Â£4m to the International Planned Parenthood Federation's 
Global SafeAbortion <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion> Programme to 
help groups affected by the global gag rule.

In October 2008, USAid halted the supply of contraceptives to MSI in Ghana. In 
Ghana, a country with very low contraceptive use, this move could pose yet 
another obstacle for advances in maternal health. Professor Sai, presidential 
adviser on reproductive health is angered by the ruling: "How dare they use 
their financial clout to keep our women dying?"JH
