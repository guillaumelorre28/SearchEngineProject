produced by child workers in dangerous conditions, Amnesty International has 
claimed.

The human rights organisation traced a range of well-known products back to the
palm oil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/palm-oil-production-social-environmental-impacts>
 company Wilmar, which it alleged employs children to do back-breaking physical 
labour on refineries in Indonesia.

Singapore-based Wilmar counts multinational companies including Kellogg’s, 
Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive,Reckitt Benckiser 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/reckittbenckiser> and Nestlé among its 
major clients, according to Amnesty.

In a 110-page report <http://www.amnesty.org.uk/palmoil> accompanied by a video
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs69nfp8Ay4&feature=youtu.be>, Amnesty 
alleged products sold by those companies were “tainted by appalling human 
rights abuses ... with children as young as eight working in hazardous 
conditions”.

It called on the companies implicated to tell customers whether the palm oil 
in individual products such as Magnum ice-creams, Ariel detergent, Knorr soup, 
Pantene shampoo and Aero chocolate bars were made using child labour.

“These findings will shock any consumer who thinks they are making ethical 
choices in the supermarket when they buy products that claim to use sustainable 
palm oil,” said the senior Amnesty investigator Meghna Abraham.

“There is nothing sustainable about palm oil that is produced using child 
labour and forced labour. Something is wrong when nine companies turning over a 
combined revenue of £260bn in 2015 are unable to do anything about the 
atrocious treatment of palm oil workers earning a pittance.”

She said allegations of child labour at Wilmar were not “isolated incidents 
but are systemic and a predictable result of the way Wilmar does business”.

In the report, Amnesty alleged that children aged from eight to 14 were 
carrying out dangerous work without safety equipment, were exposed to toxic 
pesticides and regularly carried sacks of palm fruit weighing 25kg.

One 10-year-old boy, who claims he started working for a Wilmar supplier aged 
eight, said he gets up at 6am to gather fruit and works every day but Sunday. 
“I don’t go to school ... I carry the sacks with the loose fruit by myself but 
can only carry it half full. My hands hurt and my body aches,” he said.

When approached by Amnesty, seven of nine companies admitted that they use 
palm oil from Wilmar’s Indonesian supply network but only two – Kellogg’s and 
Reckitt Benckiser – offered any detail about which products were affected.

The two companies cited “traceability” as a factor in why they had not been 
aware of abuses at the plantations supplying them palm oil through Wilmar.

“Using mealy mouthed excuses about ‘traceability’ is a total cop-out from 
those companies,” said Amnesty’s business and human rights programme director, 
Peter Frankental.

“You can be sure that if one of these companies’ products were contaminated 
and had to be taken off the shelves of supermarkets, they would ensure that 
they could trace the source to specific plantations.”

Wilmar said it was aware of allegations about labour rights abuses before it 
was contacted by Amnesty and was alreadytaking steps to remedy any failings

“Wilmar has put a lot of effort and systems in place to deal with labour and 
social issues in our operations and supply chain,” the company said. “We 
acknowledge that there are ongoing labour issues in the palm oil industry, and 
these issues could affect any palm company operating in Indonesia.

“The focus on Wilmar, as the largest processor and merchandiser of palm and 
lauric oils worldwide, is often used to draw attention to problems in the wider 
palm oil industry.”

Colgate-Palmolive said: “We are concerned about the specific allegations 
raised byAmnesty International 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international> and will hold Wilmar 
accountable for addressing any issues.”


It said it would “terminate any supplier that fails to address labour and 
human rights concerns”.

A Nestlé <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nestle> spokesperson said: “We 
will investigate allegations related to our purchasing of palm oil, along with 
our suppliers.” The company said it was not currently able to trace its 
products back to the plantations in Amnesty’s report.

Kellogg’s said: “If we find ... any supply chain violations of our global palm 
oil principles, we work with the supplier to understand corrective actions and 
ensure they understand our commitments. If the concerns are not adequately 
addressed, we take action to remove them from our supply chain.”

Another company, Procter and Gamble, said it had been “working with Wilmar to 
ensure they can remedy any potential human rights infringements in their supply 
chain”.
