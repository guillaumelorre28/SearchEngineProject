The Guardian has won two awards at this year’s British Society of Magazine 
Editors (BSME)Awards <https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards>.


The BSME honours the best publishers, editorial and advertising teams in 
British magazines.


Guardian Weekend magazine received the ‘Cover of the Year - Consumer’ award 
while the magazine’s editor Melissa Denes was recognised as Editor of the Year 
under the ‘Newspaper or Current Affairs Brand’ category.


The judges praised Melissa Denes for “refreshing an already excellent read”.


Speaking about both of the awards wins Melissa Denes said: “I’m thrilled with 
the awards, and that they recognised the work of a brilliant magazine team - 
from words and stories, through to photography, art direction and production. A 
year into a redesign, it’s wonderful to have the judges praise our ‘refresh of 
an excellent read’ - this was very much the plan.”
