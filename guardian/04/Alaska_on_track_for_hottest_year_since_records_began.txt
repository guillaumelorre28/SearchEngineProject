Alaska just can’t seem to shake the fever it has been running. This spring was 
easily the hottest the state has ever recorded and it contributed to a 
year-to-date temperature that is more than 10°F (5.5°C) above average, 
according todata released <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201605> 
Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).

The Lower 48, meanwhile, had its warmest spring since the record-breaking 
scorcher of 2012.

While May as a whole was only slightly above average – thanks in part to 
whiplashing weather from the beginning of the month to the end – every state in 
the contiguous US had warmer-than-normal temperatures for the spring as a whole.

The main area of relative cool in May was in the central and southern plains, 
whereconsiderable rains 
<http://wxshift.com/news/record-flooding-continues-to-mess-with-texas> fell 
during the month. Storm systems generally tend to drag in cooler air and cloudy 
days help to keep a lid on temperatures.

“In addition, when soils are waterlogged it prevents afternoon temperatures 
from rising as high as they would if soils were dry,” Deke Arndt, chief of the 
monitoring branch of Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, 
said in an email.

The contiguous US is having its fourth warmest year to date; May’s milder 
weather brought that trend down a bit from April when 2016 was in thenumber two 
slot

The clear standout of above-average temperatures for the Lower 48 – both in 
May and spring as a whole – was the coastal Pacific north-west. Seattle had its 
fourth-hottest May and several spots in Washington, including Seattle-Tacoma 
airport, were having their hottest year-to-date.

Alaska <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska>, for first time in modern 
records, had a spring average temperature of 32°F (0°C) – that may sound cold, 
but warmth is a relative term. That temperature handily beat the previous 
record hot spring of 1998 by 2°F (1°C), according to Noaa.

Several spots in Alaska 
<https://twitter.com/NWSAlaska/status/740573263546490880>, including Anchorage, 
Fairbanks, and Juneau, recorded their hottest springs. Several others, 
including Barrow, the northernmost city in the US, had their second-warmest 
spring.

For the year-to-date, the state is running 10.3F above the 1925-2000 average 
of 26.1°F (-3.3°C) and 2.4°F (1.3°C) higher than the previous mark of 23.7°F 
(-4.6°C) set in 1981. In fact, the past three January-May periods are among the 
four warmest in Alaska’s records.

Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager for the NWS’s Alaska region 
<http://www.arh.noaa.gov/>, said that several factors had converged to keep 
Alaska so relatively toasty 
<http://www.climatecentral.org/news/winter-warmth-could-herald-alaskas-future-20245>
, including persistent high pressure systems over the region and warm waters 
off the coast. Early snowmelt has also exacerbated the spring heat.

The effects of the elevated temperatures are readily apparent, Thoman said, 
with berries ripening weeks earlier than usual, very early “last frosts” and an 
early start to construction projects.

Temperatures in Alaska have also steadily risen — like the planet as a whole, 
and the Arctic in particular — thanks to the excess heat trapped by human 
emissions of greenhouse gases. There is a99% chance 
<http://www.climatecentral.org/news/99-percent-chance-2016-hottest-year-20359> 
that 2016 will be the hottest year on record globally, mainlydue to that excess 
heat 
<http://www.climatecentral.org/news/global-warming-key-driver-record-heat-19734>
.

Noaa forecasters expect the odds this summer to continue to favor 
above-average temperatures across Alaska, and there’s a good chance that 2016 
as a whole could be record-hot for the state as well. But that depends on how 
the rest of the year plays out.

“Certainly, the combination of five months already in the books and the 
outlook for continued warmth raises the chances for the warmest year on 
record,” Arndt said. “But it would just take one or two really cold months to 
change the scenario from ‘warmest year’ to ‘one of the warmest years.’”
