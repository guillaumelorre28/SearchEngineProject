Former Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> finalist Lisa 
Snowdon said yesterday axing Arlene Phillips from the TV dance contest would 
change the whole dynamic of the show. Radio host Snowdon, who came third in 
last year's series, said the new series of Strictly would lack the "bickering" 
between judges when choreographer Phillips is replaced by pop star Alesha 
Dixon. She said Dixon lacked the experience of her predecessor in giving 
constructive feedback. "I'm really interested to see how it changes the dynamic 
of the judging panel because personally I really loved the bickering between 
Len and Arlene."
