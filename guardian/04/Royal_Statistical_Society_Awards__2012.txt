Simon Rogers, editor of the Guardian's Datablog and Datastore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/data>, received the Royal Statistical Society 
award for journalistic excellence in its online category.

The judges praised the Datablog, saying it "not only used statistics to 
address questions of political importance but challenged assertions and 
behaviours of policy makers in a well-argued way".

The awards, now in their sixth year, recognise journalists' use of statistics 
in their work.
