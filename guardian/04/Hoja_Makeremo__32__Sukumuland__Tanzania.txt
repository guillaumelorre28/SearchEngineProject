In a dusty clearing, decorated by shells and animal skins believed to deter 
evil spirits, lives Hoja Makeremo*, a Sukumuland traditional healer. His son, 
the apprentice, stands in the background. A revered community position, to be a 
healer is a calling passed on by ancestors.

Diagnoses come in broad, ambiguous statements akin to horoscopes or sooth 
saying. Makeremo treats about five patients at any one time using twigs. 
Payment can be in cash or with goats.

Throughout our interview, deep inner murmuring, garbling noises reverberated 
from Salu's body as the spirits of ancestors made contact with him. A 
traditional healer registered by Sukumuland village authorities, Makeremo 
claims to uphold a code of ethics and appears very progressive in his attitude 
to women's rights. He believes that modern clinics and traditional healing can 
coexist and even complement each other. He is far from typical.

Often blamed for encouraging killings by proclaiming people as witches, 
traditional healers may ironically have an influential role to play in 
mobilising communities towards greater protection for older women. The occult 
economy in divination and protection is blamed for deflecting savings from the 
poor, providing legitimacy to acts of abuse and eroding social capital. But 
perhaps they have become scapegoats for merely telling people what they want to 
hear. Watched by his son, he carries a heavy burden of responsibility for the 
future - balancing an age-old tradition and pivotal community role with 
advances in modern medicine.
