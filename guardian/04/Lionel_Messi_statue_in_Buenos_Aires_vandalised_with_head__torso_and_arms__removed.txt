The statue was installed in late June, shortly after Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> and Messi lost the final of the 
Copa América against Chile. The city government said it is working to 
reconstruct the statue.

The Messi statue is among several others in the area, all of them dedicated to 
Argentinian sports stars. They include a figure of the basketball player Manu 
Ginobili, those of the tennis players Gabriela Sabatini and Guillermo Vilas, 
the Formula One champion Juan Manuel Fangio, and the hockey player Luciana 
Aymar.

Vandals also stole the racket from Sabatini’s statue in 2014
