Hampton said a search for the woman began when she didn’t return home after 
her shift.

He said there was evidence she tried to get out, but he didn’t elaborate. He 
said he isn’t sure whether a mechanism to get out of the freezer was in working 
order.

US media reports said Carolyn Robinson, 61, apparently became trapped inside 
the freezer at about 8pm on Monday

.

Her body was found 13 hours later. 

Hampton said the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration would 
investigate.

“It appears that there was some type of mechanism to allow anyone who was 
inside to be able to exit,” he said. He wasn’t sure if it was working properly.

“Right now there does not appear to be any foul play,” Hampton said. 

The hotel said in a statement it was devastated by the tragic loss of its 
long-time worker.

“We are working closely with the authorities in their investigation, and we 
are providing whatever support that we can for her family,” the statement said.

Police plan to wait for an autopsy to determine whether the woman had any type 
of medical condition that may have prevented her from getting out, Hampton said.

Walk-in freezers are designed so that anyone stuck inside can dismantle the 
locking mechanism easily and get out.
