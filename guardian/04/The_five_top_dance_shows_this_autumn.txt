Akram Khan Company: Desh 
<http://www.akramkhancompany.net/html/akram_production.php?productionid=37>

Choreographer Akram Khan may perform less than he used to, but he has always 
had a spellbinding stage presence, both in contemporary and classicalkathak 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM4o0GrheFI> dance styles. In Desh, his first 
full-length contemporary solo, Khan addresses the multiple faces of Bangladesh 
(the ancestral home of his parents) and his own shifting relations with them.

Merce Cunningham Dance Company: Legacy Tour 
<http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=12496>

Before he died in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/27/obituary-merce-cunningham>, 
American modern dance master Merce Cunninghamhad already made plans for his 
legacy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/05/pina-bausch-merce-cunningham-legacies>
: his company would make one major farewell tour, and then disband. That tour 
now reaches London, with six pieces spread over three different programmes, 
including UK premieresAntic Meet <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Yock-KhEM> 
(1958) andSecond Hand <http://www.merce.org/company/secondhand.php> (1970), the 
large-scaleRoaratorio <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ghChuTNVEc> (1983) and 
the numinously beautifulBiped <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QMlTsNtxM> 
(1999). Your last chance to see Cunningham's work danced by Cunningham's 
company.

Lucinda Childs Dance Company: Dance 
<http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=12497>

Dance is a visionary work from 1979, by American choreographer Lucinda Childs 
<http://www.lucindachilds.com/>, composer Philip Glass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass> and artist Sol LeWitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2007/apr/10/art>. It's a "process" 
piece: as the work unfolds, it reveals how it is made. Choreography and score 
are constructed from minimal elements, repeated, varied and multiplied, while 
LeWitt's large film projection – variously angled, edited and scaled shots of 
the dancers performing Dance – turns the piece into its own decor. Together, 
they build a shimmering edifice of sound, image and action.

Alternating with Frederick Ashton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frederickashton>'s La Fille Mal Gardée on 
its autumn tour, Birmingham Royal Ballet presents a fascinating assorted 
programme of three historic and highly contrasting British ballets:Ninette de 
Valois <https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/09/guardianobituaries1>'s 
darkly dramatic Checkmate (1937), Ashton's sublime Symphonic Variations (1946), 
andJohn Cranko <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/mar/30/dance>'s 
Pineapple Poll (1951), a jaunty cross-dressing comedy of sailors and wenches 
based on themes by Gilbert and Sullivan.
