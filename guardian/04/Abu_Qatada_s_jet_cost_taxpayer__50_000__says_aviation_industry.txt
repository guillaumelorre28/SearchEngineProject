The private jet flight taken by Abu Qatada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-qatada> to Jordan at the weekend cost 
the British taxpayer around £50,000, according to aviation industry estimates.

The radical cleric was flown out of RAF Northolt, west London, on a chartered 
jet operated by London Executive Aviation (LEA), which boasts it often ferries 
around heads of state, politicians and people from the film, music and sports 
industries.

The market rate for the charter of the 13-seat Embraer Legacy long-distance 
jet from London to Amman is £51,126, according to Private Fly, a booking agent 
that works with the plane's operator.

It is understood the fee was negotiated directly with the Home Office and LEA 
declined to comment on the arrangement. The expense adds to the estimated £1.7m 
cost of government efforts to remove the 53-year old preacher, who was on 
Sunday charged by military prosecutors in Amman with terrorism offences 
relating to plots inJordan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/jordan> in 1998 
and 1999.

The plane was equipped with a galley for hot and cold food, a full bar, a 
satellite telephone and data connection. The Home Office declined to comment on 
the charter "for operational security reasons".

It is unlikely that Abu Qatada, who has previously described as Osama bin 
Laden's righthand man in Europe, could have securely been transported on a 
scheduled flight.

Abu Qatada was accompanied by four Metropolitan police extradition officers on 
the flight and, it is understood, a representative of Adaleh, the Jordanian 
human rights organisation which is acting as a monitor. The plane returned to 
the UK from Marka airport in Amman shortly after 8am on Sunday morning.
