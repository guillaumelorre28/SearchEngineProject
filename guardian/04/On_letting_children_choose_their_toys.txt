Shops are reproached for dividing their toy departments into boys' things 
(engines) and girls' things (dolls) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/22/gendered-toys-stereotypes-boy-girl-segregation-equality>
on the grounds that typecasting little girls as lovers of pink discriminates 
against them, and discourages them from thinking that they, too, might 
understand engines one day.

But it could be argued – is argued by shops – that girls like different things 
anyway so they are just giving them what they want. Certainly adopting too much 
maleness in the interests of equality isn't always sensible. During my 
ill-fated time at Roedean we were offered Harrow's school song, which spoke 
warmly of games and "the tramp of 22 men" – hardly what the girls wanted to 
emulate.

It is often said that it's only grown-up expectations that make little girls 
want different things, but I know that whereas my sons refused to have figures 
in their Lego constructions – they apparently muck up the scale – the 
granddaughters immediately wanted people with the buildings; and when they 
found that their inherited dolls' house had a baby chair but no baby, they 
wanted my husband to make one, which he did, out of plaster and cloth (saying 
as he did that of the two ways he knew of making a baby he preferred the other).

It may be discrimination to make girls stick to pink

, but surely it's just as absurd to assume that football and engines are 
better, just because that's what the boys like. Let them all choose.
