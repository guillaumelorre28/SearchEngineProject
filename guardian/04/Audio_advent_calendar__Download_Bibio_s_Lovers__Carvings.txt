Taken from his 2009 album Ambivalence Avenue, you'll no doubt have heard 
Lovers' Carvings soundtracking the latest Kindle advert. It's a great song 
inspired by Walt Whitman and Zen Buddhism, as Bibio explains:

I think I wrote this track in 2007. It started off as just the waltz riff at 
the start of the song, played on guitar. There was something
about the notes and the way I recorded the guitar that made me think of a 70s 
romance film. I pictured a blissful scene of a young couple in an idyllic 
setting, the boy keeping look out for passers by while the girl scratches their 
initials into a sandstone wall. There are two specific places I think of where 
there are lovers' names scratched on to walls, one in England and one in Wales, 
and I'm reminded of them every time I think of the lyrics.

When I wrote this song I was inspired by Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and 
his claims that we are immortal – something I now feel is reflected in what 
I've learned about Zen Buddhism. The lyrics of my song can be taken literally 
or metaphorically. I was moved by Whitman's line from his Song of Myself: 
"Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched 
from."

I guess Lovers' Carvings is my rendition of the same theme. I love the point 
of view that whatever you touch affects everything else, and everything else 
affects you – and so all is divine and mysterious. A unifying force permeates 
through space, rocks and minerals, and the shaping of star stuff through the 
miracle of evolution into the sensual lifeform that is a man or woman – makes 
each and every one of us a beam of godly light."
