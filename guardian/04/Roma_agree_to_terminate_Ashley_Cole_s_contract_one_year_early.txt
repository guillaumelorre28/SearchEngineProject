 after the expiration of his Chelsea contract, made only 11 Serie A appearances 
last season and has hardly featured in coach Rudi García’s pre-season 
preparations.

On Friday, Cole, who made 107 England appearances, was not included in the 
26-man squad to be presented to fans at the Stadio Olimpico before the match 
against the Europa league winners Sevilla, and the Italian club confirmed to 
the Guardian that they had agreed to terminate his contract one year early.

Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> have been linked with a move 
for the Paris Saint-Germain defender Lucas Digne, with the 22-year-old 
Frenchman expected to join on loan.

New signings from the Premier League Wojciech Szczesny, Mohamed Salah and Edin 
Dzeko are in the Roma squad, alongside the 38-year-old Francesco Totti – about 
to begin his 24th season at the club.
