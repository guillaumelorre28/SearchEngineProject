Moctar Diop has been president of the board of governors at Ecole Mamadou 
Charles Niang since the day it first opened its doors in 1972. At the ripe old 
age of 76, Diop has led the school through many difficulties and changes over 
the years. Despite being illiterate and never having attended school, he is 
passionate about education, and stubborn about handing over the reins to 
someone younger. "I want to be here to make sure things go smoothly. I have 
helpers who write for me."

The most recent radio programme made by the school was on the topic of caring 
for the environment and good sanitation. Diop smiles and speaks with pride when 
asked about the radio broadcasts the school took part in. "Indeed this has a 
very positive impact. People are more informed about how to take care of the 
environment. They had meetings, rehearsals, drama activities. Only after the 
radio broadcast did they ask Plan to help them get lavatories and set up the 
rubbish collection. Thank Allah things are going much better now!" he says.

Diop recognises the power he is placing into the hands of children. "The media 
can reach a wide range of people. You can see the impact on people's lives. It 
can be listened to everywhere. Everyone can afford a radio." He laughs and 
adds, "People can pay too much attention to it sometimes!"
