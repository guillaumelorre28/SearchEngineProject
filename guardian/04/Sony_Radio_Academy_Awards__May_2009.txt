The Guardian's Media Talk podcast won a Sony Radio Academy silver award in the 
Internet Programme category for 'The Rout at Radio 2' presented by Matt Wells 
and produced by Ben Green and Scott Cawley. The judges described the programme 
as 'an illuminating analysis of the Brand/Ross affair, which combined an 
informal sound with being really well informed. This was the definitive 
broadcast take on the media story of the year.'
