‘The violence that women suffer is the result of an underlying ideology that 
is common to all’


I marched from the Obelisk to Plaza de Mayo because I don’t remember a time 
when I wasn’t afraid of the harassment that comes with being a woman. I am 
joined in this feeling by so many others. And we are finally taking a stance.

I wanted to help make a point together with all my fellow Argentines that 
misogyny is a social disease and that we are ready to fight to erradicate it.


Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> is finally learning 
that attacks on women are not just something that belong in the private life 
sphere. We are realizing that the violence women are suffering is the result of 
an underlying ideology that is common to all society. And the only way to 
eradicate a social behaviour is by talking about it and filling all our 
squares, schools and businesses with discussions on how we can evolve to a 
better and feminist society.

‘Education is needed to empower girls’


I did not take part in the strike, though I fully support the cause. 
Organisers believe the protest will make things more visible. They may be 
right, but macho culture won’t change overnight - it’s education that’s needed 
to empower girls, and in many cases therapy for women in abusive relationships. 
Once the violence starts, it’s hard to stop. Even if there were no gender bias, 
police response would come too late.


There are economic issues at stake, too, as many women can’t afford to leave 
their husbands or partners - the current slow-down doesn’t help. This is more 
or less what my friends think.

‘We took the opportunity to discuss what we can do to prevent violence against 
women’


We are a language school and we decided to take advantage of this day to hold 
an open class with our students reflecting upon how violence affects women and 
debating about what we can do in our everyday lives to prevent it - in English, 
of course.


Instead of striking, we consider it more productive to debate on the topic. In 
Argentina, around 280 women died in 2015 due to violence against women. About 
4000 calls a day are received in the help line; this means there is a lot to 
do, specially from us teachers: creating awareness in our students is essential 
to stop this.

‘We’re laughed at when we denounce domestic abuse’

I am a journalist that work for La Poderosa, a social collective group that 
fights for social justice for vulnerable sectors and women rights.


Salta is one of the cities with the highest number of femicides in the 
country. Every single month since the beginning of the year a woman has been 
violently murdered, in most cases at the hands of their partner.

 I’m a woman who doesn’t feel safe in the streets where I grew up and have 
friends and family who feel the same way. We live in constant fear and it’s no 
longer about social backgrounds, it’s about how vulnerable women are in this 
country: laws don’t really protect us; we’re laughed at when we denounce 
domestic abuse; told it is our fault when we’re raped because of how we dress; 
find it impossible to access management positions as the workplace is male 
dominated and are constantly exposed to verbal and physical violence.


 The strike ‘Ni Una Menos’ represents our wishes: no more women killed, no 
more violence against girls and women.

‘I joined the strike because I was a victim of domestic violence’


People wore black in Chile as a symbol of them mourning the femicide that 
happens all over the world.


I joined the strike because I was a victim of domestic violence, and because I 
freed myself and can empathise with other women who have gone through the same 
thing.


I want to fight for those who are not able to and for generations to come, 
that we can put a stop to violence against women for good.

‘I was abused when I was 13-years-old. We must stop the violence against women’


I striked on Wednesday so that women in my country can have a better quality 
of life. Stop the abuse, the violence, the silencing of the victims, the 
harassment, and the victimization of women. I want the wage gap to stop 
existing, and I want abortions to be legalized.


I was abused in the street when I was 13-years-old and many of my friends were 
as well at different ages. I’ve heard things that nobody should and I’ve seen 
things that no child should. I also lost a friend from school to gender 
violence.

I tell my friends the badge number of the cab I’m taking as a security 
measure, and tell them when I’ve arrived home. I have to make sure to be in 
control at all times, so as not to put myself in more risk. I don’t like to 
walk alone at night due to the risk of being raped, abused or harrassed. These 
are all the reasons why I marched.

‘It is about making the situation we currently live in public’


Sadly, I couldn’t stop working because I’m an English teacher at a primary 
school and the children are very demanding, but I did talk with them about the 
whole subject. I was pleased with the debate we had!


‘Ni Una Menos’ is about making the situation we currently live in public. We 
want everyone to know this is happening and it is wrong. It is about wanting to 
ensure a safer world, a safer country for our future daughters, a world in 
which they can come home without the fear of being murdered in the process, 
without doubting their outfits before they leave the house, without the 
assurance that they are safe. It is on us, and the government should take 
responsibility.
