The Guardian has been inducted into the prestigious Design Week Hall of Fame 
<http://awards.designweek.co.uk/> at the Design Week Awards 2010. It is the 
only publication to have received this accolade alongside the likes of British 
design company Established & Sons and the Victoria & Albert Museum.

The judges wanted to honour The Guardian's continued commitment to design 
including the Berliner relaunch and new look Guardian.co.uk.

There was further success in the Wayfinding & Environmental Graphics category 
where GNM came top for the internal signage at Kings Place designed by 
Cartlidge Levene.
