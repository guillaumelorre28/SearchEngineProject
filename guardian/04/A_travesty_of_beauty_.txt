Miss Landmine <http://www.miss-landmine.org/misslandmine_project.html> is an 
alternative beauty contest mixed with political statement dreamed up by the 
Norwegian artist Morten Traavik, in which 10 Angolan women injured by mines 
model specially adapted clothes and prosthetic limbs.

The project currently exists as a website, but the plan is to create "a 
fashion magazine in the style of Elle, Vogue and Cosmopolitan" to showcase the 
contest.

Angola was chosen over other potential countries, such as Afghanistan or 
Cambodia, because it has "a relaxed and open attitude to physicality and 
sensuality", the organisers say.

So, a laudable effort to change our perceptions of beauty?

Not at all, argues the Black Looks blog, which calls 
<http://www.blacklooks.org/2007/03/miss_landmine_angola_2007.html> the contest 
ill-judged and patronising, an "offensive, disgusting exploitation of African 
women".

Sokari, the author of those outraged quotes, goes on: 

In the background of some of the photos there are white people smiling and 
glowing as they make up and dress the women - like mannequins. Putting the 
issue of beauty pageants aside and the patronising comments on western opinions 
and African cultural traditions, it is still an inappropriate tool, which 
objectifies women. Besides, landmine survivors are men as well as women ... And 
who the hell is going to be buying these glossy magazines and wearing these 
fancy clothes? Certainly not the women survivors who are poor unemployed women?

One commentator on the blog agrees, saying that: "[t]hese middle class/rich 
Norwegian folks" would be better off campaigning against the production of 
mines.

Brave and liberating or appallingly misjudged? Surely the question remains 
open.
