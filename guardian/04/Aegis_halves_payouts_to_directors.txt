Aegis <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aegis> Media, the UK-based 
media-buying and research group, halved its payouts to directors to just over 
£3.5m last year.

Jerry Buhlmann, who was promoted to chief executive on 1 May 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/18/aegis-chief-executive-profit-fall>
, was the highest paid Aegis director, taking home a remuneration package of 
£974,000. This represents a 14.4% increase over his £851,000 pay packet in 2008.

Aegis did not pay out any cash bonuses last year, but Buhlmann received a 
deferred bonus of £334,000 for achieving performance targets in previous years.

The chairman, John Napier, received £510,000 last year, a significant increase 
over the £124,000 he received in 2008. This was because on top of his 
£200,000-a-year chairman fee he was paid an extra £300,000 for taking on the 
role of interim chief executive for more than a year.

Aegis, which implemented a severe cost-cutting plan last year to cope with the 
downturn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/19/aegis-cut-global-workforce>, 
reported a total remuneration bill for directors of £3.6m.

In 2008 the total payout was £7.2m. However, this included the £2.1m for 
Robert Lerwill, the former chief executive who wasousted in November 2009 and 
given a £1.4m termination payment
