Didier Drogba's Ivory Coast are heading home after the substitute Hameur 
Bouazza earned Algeria a 3-2 extra-time win in Cabinda tonight and a place in 
theAfrica Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> semi-finals.

The France-born Blackpool midfielder Bouazza headed home two minutes into 
extra-time afterAlgeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> twice 
came from behind in the quarter-final between two World Cup-bound teams. The 
Algerians will now play either the defending champions, Egypt, or Cameroon, who 
meet in Benguela tomorrow.

Karim Matmour cancelled out Salomon Kalou's fourth-minute opener for Ivory 
Coast <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ivorycoast>, one of the 
pre-tournament favourites, just before the break. No sooner had Abdulkader 
Keita fired into the top corner one minute from time to restore the lead than 
Algeria's Madjid Bougherra headed home to force the game into the extra 30 
minutes.

Drogba failed to impose himself on the Algerian defence and missed a couple of 
clear chances. Kolo Tour√©, the Manchester City defender, had the ball in the 
net in the dying seconds but was flagged offside.
