 She dances, she cavorts, she wears skinny black leggings. Audrey Hepburn has 
been reincarnated as the latest muse for Gap, brought back to life to help sell 
one of the clothing chain's staple products - skinny black pants.
An advert featuring Hepburn, which made its television debut this month and 
can be seen on billboards across America, doctors a scene from the 1957 Stanley 
Donen film, Funny Face. She plays a clerk who is discovered by a photographer 
and taken to Paris, where she becomes the toast of the fashion world. The 
advert opens with a scene showing her dancing through a cafe in a black 
turtleneck top and those pants. The tagline reads: "It's back - the skinny 
black pant."

Not everyone is enamoured with this latest instance of a large corporation 
using a dead celebrity to sell a product. "Gap should be ashamed," wrote a 
contributor to the ThirdWay advertising blog. "It's a desperate attempt by a 
desperate company, to align itself with someone classy."

Gap was unrepentant, saying it had worked with Hepburn's son, Sean Ferrer, and 
renamed the trousers The Audrey Hepburn™ Pant. It also pledged to make "a 
generous contribution" to theAudrey Hepburn

Hepburn, who died of cancer in 1993, is also attracting attention for another 
item of clothing. The little black dress she wore in the 1961 film Breakfast at 
Tiffany's goes on auction in London in December and is expected to fetch more 
than £50,000.
