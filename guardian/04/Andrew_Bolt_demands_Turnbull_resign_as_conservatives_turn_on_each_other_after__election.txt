Andrew Bolt has called on Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> to resign after 
leading the Liberals “to humiliation” in the election as rightwing commentators 
and politicians appeared to turn on each other.


Bolt posted a scathing open letter to the prime minister, titled “Malcolm 
Turnbull – you are finished”,on his Herald Sun blog 
<http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/malcolm_turnbull_you_are_finished/>
 on Saturday night.


He accused Turnbull of having “assassinated” Tony Abbott and said Turnbull 
“treated the Liberal base like dirt”.

“And now look. Almost everything turned to ruin.”

Malcolm Turnbull: ‘I’m confident that we can form a majority government’ – video
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video>
Bolt concluded the post by calling for Turnbull to resign, threatening that 
his popularity, “already plummeting”, could only fall further.

“You have been a disaster. You betrayed Tony Abbott and then led the party to 
humiliation, stripped of both values and honour. Resign.”

Speaking on Sky, Bolt said Turnbull would be “dragged out by his heels” if he 
did not go himself and the party should reinstate Abbott.

But the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/barnaby-joyce>, told the ABC that 
he disagreed.

“I don’t think the Australian people want this revolving door of prime 
ministers, I don’t,” he said. “I’ve had a couple of calls with Malcolm tonight 
and I’m looking forward to Malcolm being the PM of our nation.”

With the election result still too close to call 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jul/02/australian-federal-election-2016-results-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-politics-live>
 on Saturday night, questions overTurnbull’s wresting power from Abbott in 
September last year

 have resurfaced and tensions within the Liberal party seem to be starting to 
fray.

Abbott gave a speech at his electorate party in which he said it would be 
“nice to see a bit of democracy in the Liberal party”.

Tony Abbott expects a Coalition election win despite a ‘difficult night’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/tony-abbott-confident-in-a-coalition-election-win-following-a-difficult-night-video>
Alan Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-jones> accused James 
McGrath, the Liberal senator and key Turnbull supporter, of being “chief 
bedwetter” in the leadership spill.

McGrath retorted that Jones was no friend of the Liberal National party given 
that he campaigned against Campbell Newsman’s one-term government in Queensland.

“I don’t care what you think,” McGrath told Jones.

Earlier, Senator Cory Bernardi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cory-bernardi> had sent an opaque 
tweet to Liberal strategist Mark Textor that echoed Bolt’s criticisms of 
Turnbull’s mistreatment of the party base.

Cory Bernardi (@corybernardi) 
@TextorMark <https://twitter.com/TextorMark> Hey Tex, I'm thinking that 
Conservatives actually do matter.
 <https://twitter.com/corybernardi/status/749195932818771968> July 2, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/corybernardi/status/749195932818771968> 
Textor had told the Australian in September 2015 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/disgruntled-liberals-explore-farright-party-options/news-story/2a31a2bb50fc1788395b470c2add0b22>
 there was “qualitative evidence” that conservatives did not matter: “The sum 
of a more centrist approach outweighs any alleged marginal loss of so-called 
base voters.”

Conservative senator Eric Abetz said he was not going to speculate about the 
impact of the change but nonetheless managed to sneak in a veiled dig: “Suffice 
to say a change was made for better or worse and we move on.”

Other senior Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> figures have blamed 
Labor’s scare campaign over their plans for Medicare for the knife-edge result.

Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, said Labor had been “boasting about 
this monstrous lie at the heart of its campaign”.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said similar on the ABC’s election panel: “We 
know they told the lie ... yet they continued to back it in with the phone 
calls and the mail and the little cards and the whispers at the booths and all 
of these sorts of things.

“This was the Labor party’s campaign. It wasn’t a campaign about growing the 
economy, it was a campaign about fright.”

Morrison said we would “never know” what would have happened if the party did 
not change to Turnbull. He himself thought it was “highly unlikely” that the
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would have had 
a better result under Abbott: “I think the party room made its own judgment 
last September.”
