Winning tip: The White Lounge, Mayerhofen, Austria

The White Lounge is a six-metre-high candlelit igloo and the perfect place to 
chill out or party. It’s pure kitsch: there are cosy insulated rooms and a huge 
dance floor where waiters skate around serving drinks. Outside there’s a 
tanning terrace with deck chairs and great sunset views. You can even stay the 
night if the vibe becomes too full-on.

The Drop Inn, Le Praz, Courchevel, France

Friendly and unpretentious, this place will keep you smiling after a day on 
the slopes. The pool table is extremely popular, as are Tapas Tuesdays (free 
tapas) and live music nights. There is also a quiz night and other great 
offers. It has everything covered – from hot drinks and cake at tea time to 
chilled-out early-evening vibes.

Trofana Alm bar, Ischgl, Austria

This is the perfect après-ski cocktail, mixing Italian style and Germanic 
atmosphere. A giant nodding bear greets you, before friendly waiters carrying 
huge trays of drinks make you feel welcome. All styles of music blast away 
until happy hour ends at 7pm, when the place transforms into a candlelit 
restaurant for couples, friends and families.

Nederhütte, Obergurgl, Austria

This bar rocks – even my usually quiet wife was dancing on the tables! What a 
place: the music is wild, the atmosphere electric. But if it’s all too much, a 
snowcat will take you back down to the village.

Le Vagabond, Chamonix, France

A Chamonix institution, the Vaga attracts almost as many visitors to the 
picturesque valley town as Mont Blanc itself. Sit in the beer garden and marvel 
at the beauty of Europe’s highest peak while sharing stories of the day’s 
adventures. Unrivalled hospitality and a hint of magic prevail. Good food too.

Roo Bar, St Moritz, Switzerland

Come for the vitamin C (apple juice and Grand Marnier) and homemade glühwein. 
With a good mix of locals and visitors, this is one of the few bars with a 
relaxed feel among all the ritzy lounges. The music is joval and the people 
laid-back.

Downstairs at Eric’s, Breckenridge, USA

It’s all about the chicken wings. Eric’s is great after your last run. No 
attitude, just beer and chicken wings, sport on big TVs, lots of people and 
no-frills decor. It became our go-to spot every day.

Men with bulging biceps, check shirts and lederhosen stride around with trays 
held high, laden with beers and shots. Jägerbombs, Hot Widows and weissbier are 
all within easy reach as you are already up on the tables dancing to Schlager 
music. It is frenzied. And awesome.

Bruno’s Bar, Champoluc, Italy

Bruno’s Bar is your last chance to grab a beer on the slopes before heading to 
town. Legend has it the owner named the bar after an unfortunate hunting trip. 
During the safety briefing, the landowner asked the hunters not to shoot the 
company’s mascot – Bruno the wild boar – only to shoot it himself, by mistake. 
Bruno is now on display, half outside the building and half in.

 Le Rond Point, Méribel, France 

Known as the “Ronnie”, it features a huge outdoor terrace, with chunky picnic 
tables and an awesome beer and hot food bar – the sweet chilli noodles with 
beef were a favourite of mine last season, served in a carton with chopsticks. 
Combine that with mountain views and a pitcher of Amstel while you overlook the 
slopes. When the clock strikes 5pm live music kicks off the après-ski. Fun 
covers bands play most nights – don’t miss The Elements, the best band on the 
Alps circuit.
