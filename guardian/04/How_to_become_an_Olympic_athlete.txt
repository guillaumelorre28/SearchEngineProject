As this year’s Olympics draws to an end, governments around the world are 
hoping the games will motivate their countries’ young people to become the 
medal-winning athletes of the future. But though this sounds like a good idea, 
it is not enough incentive on its own.

In fact, studies show that motivation has almost no effect on how well you can 
learn to fence or swim. Improvements to your performance also have relatively 
little to do with innate ability. In the end, it’s all about how many training 
hours you put in – whether you wanted to or were forced into it by a coach or 
pushy parent.

In a study involving violinists (which also applies to athletes), scientists 
looked at the bits of the cortex connected to the musicians’ left and right 
hands. They found the bit of the brain which controls the left hand was 
slightly thicker than the part which controls the right hand.

This change in brain structure was not related to willpower or the motivation 
centres, which are found in the frontal cortex, but simply to hours and hours 
of repetitive practice. Perhaps those tough Olympic coaches are the ones who 
truly deserve a medal.
