Produced in partnership with The Mill 
<http://www.themill.com/portfolio/2876/6x9%3A-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement>
, 6x9 is the Guardian’s first virtual reality project. The experience places 
viewers in a virtual segregation cell which they can explore and interact with 
and aims to highlight the psychological deterioration and sensory deprivation 
that can be the effects of long term solitary confinement for many of the 
people who have experienced it first hand around the world.
