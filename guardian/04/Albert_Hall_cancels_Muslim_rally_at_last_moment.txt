 The Royal Albert Hall in London has cancelled a booking for a rally tomorrow 
by the Muslim group Al Muhajiroun, saying it had been misled over the rally's 
purpose.
A spokesman for Al Muhajiroun, led by a radical cleric, Omar Bakri Muhammad, 
said it was too short notice to prevent people attending. "It's up to the 
police now. We sold 1,700 tickets, and cannot tell 1,700 people individually 
not to go."

The booking at the hall in Kensington was made five months ago, but cancelled 
on Tuesday. Al Muhajiroun went yesterday to the high court for an injunction to 
enforce the booking, but it was rejected. The booking had cost Â£60,000 in 
advertising and other preparations, the spokesman said, blaming "Islamophobia" 
and pressure from MI5 and police for the cancellation.

The hall's chief executive David Elliott said: "We had reason to believe the 
event would be quite different to what we were told when it was booked. It was 
billed to us as a Muslim women's event, but when we found out more , we decided 
it would be harmful to the hall's reputation. We discovered Omar Bakri Muhammad 
was to speak, and looking at his internet site, we would not want to be 
associated with many of the views expressed."

Mr Muhammad, who lives and preaches in Tottenham, north London, has previously 
called for Muslims to begin a jihad, or holy war, against the United States and 
its allies.
