The Daily Telegraph was rather carried away by Ashes fever on Saturday, and 
not in a good way. The front page picture featured Stuart Broad celebrating 
with his England team-mates as his five-wicket spell helped dismiss Australia 
for just 160 in their first innings in the deciding Ashes Test at the Oval. 
Alas the picture caption had him down as Chris Broad instead. Chris Broad, as 
any cricket fan knows, is Stuart Broad's father, an Ashes-winning 1980s England 
Test cricketer turned ICC match official. What will Telegraph third umpire, AKA 
associate editor and style tsar Simon Heffer, make of that?
