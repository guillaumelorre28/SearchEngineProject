Name: Tom Stoppard.

Age: 77.

Appearance: Well-lunched Mick Jagger.

Occupation: Don’t be silly. You know exactly who he is.

Some sort of writer, isn’t he? Our greatest living playwright, to be precise.

The Birthday Party, isn’t that one of his? You’re thinking of Harold Pinter.

Oh yeah, easily confused. I take it you’re not a theatregoer.

I prefer to spend the evening in the pub. You make Sir Tom’s point for him.

What point? That audiences are less cultured than they used to be, and that he 
has to dumb down his allusions accordingly. “Theatregoers have become more 
ignorant since the 1970s, when playwrights could rely on them to have a basic 
knowledge of Shakespeare,”he complained in a talk at the National Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/09/tom-stoppard-audiences-references-hard-problem>
, where his new play The Hard Problem has just opened.

Does he give any examples? Goneril. He referred to her in his play Travesties 
in 1974, and everyone got it. Then, when the play was revived in 1990, only 
half the audience knew who she was.

Goneril, Goneril ... it rings a bell. Shakespeare is the clue.

Sexually transmitted disease? You may be thinking of Chlamydia – sorry, 
Calpurnia – in Julius Caesar. Goneril was King Lear’s eldest and nastiest 
daughter.

Ah. Why are dumber audiences a problem for Stoppard? Because his plays are 
often intertextual. This, after all, is the playwright who found fame almost 50 
years ago withRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead

. If you don’t know which play R&G are from, it doesn’t work. Ditto Jumpers, 
Travesties, After Magritte and The Real Inspector Hound. You need to understand 
what’s being commented on before you can appreciate the play.

They sound too clever for their own good. Funnily enough, you’re not the first 
person to say that.

Did everyone understand The Hard Problem? Only after Stoppard had rewritten 
one scene three times because preview performances had left audiences bemused.

What’s it about? It’s about 100 minutes, with no interval.

Did the critics like it? Only the Daily Mail’s Quentin Letts

.

Oh dear. Yes, unfortunate. Most of the rest found that a play examining 
consciousness lulled them into a state of unconsciousness.

Do say: “Education isn’t what it was in my day.”

Don’t say: “You don’t think it’s sour grapes, do you?”
