Never seen Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's masterful, terrifying Hollywood 
amnesiac adventure, nominated for an Oscar, ranked number three in our poll to 
find thebest film of the noughties 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/series/100-best-films-of-the-noughties>, and 
quite the most seductively baffling movie ever made?

Or did you see it on release, love it, but somehow fail to work up the courage 
– and find two-and-a-half-hours in the diary – to sit down, watch it again, and 
try and figure out what on earth was going on?

Now's your chance. This Sunday at 7pm, we want as many of you as would like to 
to put your free DVD into the player and press "play movie" at the same moment. 
We'll be liveblogging from Guardian towers with Steve Rose; over in California, 
David Thomson will be on hand with expert analysis of key scenes.

Join us here <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film> then. If you dare.
