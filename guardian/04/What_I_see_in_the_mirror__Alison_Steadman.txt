When I look in the mirror I see grey hair. Or as my friends call it, silver 
fox. It's still a shock because I went grey only six months ago. I was on tour 
and wearing a wig in an Alan Bennett play. I couldn't get to the hairdresser 
and the lady who was doing my hair in the show, said, "Why don't you leave it, 
it's a nice colour." So when I got back to London, I didn't have 
highlights, I just had a cut and by the time I'd had it cut twice, all the 
blond was out and it was grey, well silver fox.

I would love a new set of teeth – like most people in their 60s, I've got 
fillings and crowns. My skin isn't bad. I look after it – I take my make-up off 
and I moisturise. I didn't use any moisturiser until my 40s – I didn't need to. 
I don't use expensive products – they are a load of rubbish. I once made a 
terrible mistake and spent a fortune on a tube of moisturiser because 
I thought, "I'm getting older, I'll treat myself." I promise you, I was 
flinching as I was handing over the money, and I came out in that many spots.

I don't like looking at myself in the mirror now. I still want to be 25 and 
slinking around. It's silly because we've all got to age. I think keeping a 
good spirit inside is important, the more you laugh and the warmer 
your thoughts, the more it shows in your face. If you are grumpy and miserable 
it shows, so I try to keep happy.
