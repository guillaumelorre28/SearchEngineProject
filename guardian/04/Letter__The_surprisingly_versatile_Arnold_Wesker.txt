Arnold Wesker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/13/sir-arnold-wesker-obituary> was 
not only a talented playwright but also a surprisingly versatile performer. 
When a student, I wrote to him to ask, rather cheekily, for money for our new 
women’s theatre company, Trouble and Strife. He said he wasn’t rich, but 
offered to come to Cambridge and perform his one-woman play Annie Wobbler and 
donate the proceeds. It was a remarkable performance and he captured this 
feisty working-class woman beautifully. The money helped Trouble and Strife to 
grow from a student company into an award-winning professional one.
