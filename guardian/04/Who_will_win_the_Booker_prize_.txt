 are Parrot and Olivier in America by Peter Carey, Room by Emma Donoghue, In a 
Strange Room by Damon Galgut, The Finkler Question by Howard Jacobson, The Long 
Song by Andrea Levy, and C by Tom McCarthy.

Lots of debate on the books desk about which book will emerge victorious â€“ who 
do you think will win? And who should?
