Peter Jackson’s final visit to JRR Tolkien’s Middle Earth, The Hobbit: The 
Battle of the Five Armies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies>, scored 
a huge $90.6m five-day opening to top the US box office this weekend.

The film’s debut compares favourably to previous instalments An Unexpected 
Journey and The Desolation of Smaug, which bowed with $84.6m and $73.6m 
respectively in 2012 and 2013. Both earlier films secured their opening totals 
over a three-day period, however.


The Battle of the Five Armies also pulled in another $105.5m outside the US 
over the weekend and now stands at $355.6m globally after just two weeks of 
release. With the film apparently outpacing its predecessors, Jackson’s film 
looks on course to repeat the feat managed by An Unexpected Journey, which just 
broke through the $1bn mark at the worldwide box office.

Success for The Battle of the Five Armies inevitably meant other releases 
suffered. Hoary Ben Stiller fantasy sequelNight at the Museum: Secret of the 
Tomb <https://www.theguardian.com/film/night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb> 
opened in second with a crushingly disappointing $17.3m, the lowest yet seen 
for the three-movie franchise about a New York institution where the exhibits 
come to life at night. The new film features the final on-screen performance of 
the late Robin Williams, as a wax model of Theodore Roosevelt.

Third place went to musical remake Annie with an opening of $16.3m. Starring 
Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx, the film is one of five from studio Sony 
which were illegally released online by cyber-attackers last month. Given its 
availability for free, executives may be relieved at what under the 
circumstances looks a reasonable return.Annie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/annie>, for comparison, cost $65m to make, 
while Secret of the Tomb cost $127m.

Elsewhere, Ridley Scott’s controversial biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/exodus> suffered a dramatic drop in its 
second week after a disappointing opening last time around. It fell from first 
to fourth with just $8.1m for a two-week total of $38.9m. The top five was 
rounded out by enduring sci fi sequel The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - part one, 
which pulled in another $7.8m for a North American total of $289.2m in its 
fifth week of release.

The only other new entry to make the top 10 was Indian comedy drama PK, with a 
surprising $3.46m debut in tenth spot. However Oscar-tipped Reese Witherspoon 
vehicle Wild, about a woman who treks thousands of miles through the wilderness 
to get over the death of her mother, broken into the top 10 at No 6 after 
expanding from limited release. Jean-Marc Vallée’s film took $4.2m for a total 
of $7.2m.
