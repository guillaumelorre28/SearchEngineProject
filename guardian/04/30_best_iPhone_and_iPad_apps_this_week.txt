A little later than usual, here's our weekly roundup of the most notable new 
apps for iPhone and iPad, following Friday's publication of the weeklybest 
Android apps 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2013/jan/18/best-android-apps-talking-angela>
 roundup.

As ever, the price in brackets refers to the initial download: often (Free) 
means (Freemium) with in-app purchases. Read on for this week's roundup:

Temple Run 2 (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/temple-run-2/id572395608?mt=8>

Dealt with at more length in the full review last week 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2013/jan/17/temple-run-2-review>
, Temple Run 2 is a logical sequel to the hugely-popular endless runner, 
bumping up the graphics, adding a mine-cart section and more customisation for 
the characters.
iPhone / iPad

NewsWhip (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/newswhip/id569523615?mt=8>

I'm still thinking about raising VC money for an aggregation app to aggregate 
all the news aggregation apps. It's an aggregation play... Flippancy aside, 
NewsWhip is an interesting addition to the massed ranks of such apps, claiming 
to scan "a billion people on Facebook and Twitter" to see which stories are 
popular right now, then serving them up in category-based streams.
iPhone / iPad

Rolling Stone Magazine (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rolling-stone-magazine/id584432649?mt=8>

Only available in the US for now – a shame given its global reputation 
– Rolling Stone magazine finally has its owniPad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> app. Charging $1.99 a month, 
$19.99 a year or $4.99 per issue, it's a replica of the print edition with 
added streaming samples of songs and iTunes Store links.
iPad

Kingdom Conquest II (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kingdom-conquest-ii/id566278805?mt=8>

Remember when Sega's Super Monkey Ball was the first big hit in the App 
Store's early days? Now the veteran publisher is finding its way in the 
free-to-play market too, with strategy game Kingdom Conquest having been a 
sizeable hit. This sequel mixes up card-battling, real-time strategy and 3D 
dungeoneering, with in-app purchases funding your ambitions.
iPhone / iPad

Herd Absurd! (£1.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/herd-absurd!-mix-match-collect/id577357125?mt=8>

Herd Absurd! is a characterful take on those children's books where you flip 
sections of the page to put different heads, bodies and legs of characters 
together. Here, it's animals that your kids will be mixing and matching, with 
suitably-cheeky animations making them smile along the way.
iPhone / iPad

Final Fantasy All The Bravest (£2.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/final-fantasy-all-the-bravest/id581058256?mt=8>

I have mixed feelings including this game. It's certainly notable: a brand new 
Final Fantasy <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/final-fantasy> 
action-strategy game designed for mobile. Yet it's also one of the more 
controversial exponents of in-app purchases in recent memory: not just charging 
69p to unlock "premium" characters – there are 35 to collect but you get a 
random one each time – but also charging for hourglasses needed to re-enter 
battles quickly when you get defeated.
iPhone / iPad

Car Jack Streets: Directors Cut (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/car-jack-streets-directors/id574759891?mt=8>

Openly inspired by the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games, Car Jack 
Streets was an early hit on the App Store. Now it's been rebooted as a 
free-to-play game, as you drive around Jack City completing nefarious missions 
to pay off your Mob debts.
iPhone / iPad

Riven for iPad (£3.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/riven-for-ipad/id536344854?mt=8>

Several games out in the last week will be giving gamers of a certain age a 
nostalgic glow. Riven is the sequel to adventure game Myst, with a 
similarly-enormous footprint on your iOS device – 1.93GB. It looks an accurate 
conversion of the original PC game, which sees you exploring a 
beautiful-looking world.
iPad

Britain in 2013 magazine (£3.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/britain-in-2013-magazine/id588125219?mt=8>

Britain in 2013? Freezing! But thankfully Immediate Media's new app has its 
sights set on loftier topics than a spot of snow. It aims to showcase "the 
state of the nation through the realm of social science", from climate change 
(okay, a bit on snow) through to police behaviour, our ageing society and 
educational reforms.
iPhone / iPad

PinYinPal (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pinyinpal-only-free-mandarin/id573873383?mt=8>

iPad app PinYinPal looks a lot like Words With Friends (well, Scrabble, 
obviously) but it's actually got even-more educational ambitions. It's actually 
an app for learning Chinese through play, as you use letters of the alphabet to 
spell traditional Mandarin characters. A clever idea that looks good for anyone 
learning Chinese.
iPad

American Idol Official (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/american-idol-official/id593353522?mt=8>

It's a little while before X Factor fever strikes again in the UK, but over in 
the US the viewing public are already gearing up for the newAmerican Idol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/american-idol> series. It's got a 
very slick second-screen app too, with voting, social feeds, video clips and 
news on the contestants and judges.
iPhone / iPad

GroupVox (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/groupvox-ptt-walkie-talkie/id586533379?mt=8>

A few years ago, the idea of Push-To-Talk (PTT for short) was all the rage 
among some mobile operators, who thought adding walkie-talkie features to 
phones was The Future. It wasn't. Can the idea make a comeback with apps? 
GroupVox hopes so: it's a walkie-talkie app for talking to your Facebook 
friends, including the ability to record messages for people when they're 
offline.
iPhone

Conor Maynard (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/conor-maynard/id579754631?mt=8>

Increasingly, music artists' apps are going beyond pure news, tweets and 
iTunes links, which is good. In the case of youthful starConor Maynard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/conor-maynard>, his app's twist is a 
photo-sharing feature that puts him in the photo with you, lets you scribble 
your own messages on top (OMG!) then share to social networks.
iPhone

Pitchero (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pitchero/id590231780?mt=8>

A few companies have had a bash at creating connected sports apps, with Fanatix
 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/12/fanatix-app-back-page-sports>
 being the most high-profile here in the UK. Now Pitchero is entering the 
market, but with a wider focus on sports clubs at all levels, including 
non-league. Its app offers news, fixtures, tables, photos and videos and other 
content from more than 10,000 clubs.
iPhone

Jongla (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jongla-instant-messenger/id564199158?mt=8>

More messaging, but this time the instant variety. Jongla is a new 
cross-platform messaging app with hopes (even if they're slim hopes) of taking 
on WhatsApp and the like. Sharing photos and locations is included, and the app 
uses push notifications to ensure messages aren't missed.
iPhone

Heroes and Castles (£1.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/heroes-and-castles/id563297418?mt=8>

There are more orcs, goblins and giants than you can shake a (great big 
flaming) stick at in this impressive castle-defence game, which throws in 
action-RPG elements to put you in the heart of the battle. It sees you taking 
on hordes of monsters while upgrading your castle walls and buildings to keep 
your army in spiffing condition.
iPhone / iPad

The Land of Me - Shape, Size and Colour (£1.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/land-me-shape-size-colour/id592688649?mt=8>

British startup Made In Me has been exploring interactive children's fiction 
with its The Land of Me apps, scooping a BAFTA nomination in the process. This 
latest example focuses on, yes, shapes, sizes and colours as kids create 
monsters, animals and vehicles.
iPad

Five Little Monkeys Play Hide and Seek (£1.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/five-little-monkeys-play-hide/id582853306?mt=8>

Here's another app for kids, this time from US publisher Oceanhouse Media (of 
Dr. Seuss apps fame). It's a digital version of a book starring five cheeky 
monkeys trying to get out of bedtime by playing games. Expect rhyming text, 
lots of chances to practise counting, and a mixture of voice narration and 
word-highlighting to help young readers.
iPhone / iPad

The Sun Smile (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-sun-smile/id587782294?mt=8>

Also covered last week in a standalone story 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/appsblog/2013/jan/18/the-sun-smile-iphone-app>
, this is a new appy spin-off from The Sun newspaper, serving up "the day's 
funniest stories" in a free app, tying in with News International's latest 
marketing campaign.
iPhone

Crazy Blind Date by OKCupid (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crazy-blind-date-by-okcupid/id573701569?mt=8>

Better when used in the US than in the UK by all accounts, but still an 
interesting launch. Released by dating website OKCupid, this strips the idea of 
online dating down to suggesting a time and place, then seeing who's in the 
area for a speedy blind date there.
iPhone

Amazing Alex Free (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/amazing-alex-free/id549771710?mt=8>

It seems harsh to criticise Rovio's Amazing Alex for not being an Angry 
Birds-sized hit, given thatnothing has been an Angry Birds-sized hit apart from 
Angry Birds. Now the puzzler is getting a second lease of life as a cut-down 
free title, with 16 levels to play before deciding whether to upgrade to the 
full version's 100+ puzzles.
iPhone / iPad

Medical Recorder (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/medical-recorder/id587367456?mt=8>

There are all sorts of hurdles to jump before new technology can be adopted 
across the board by doctors and the medical professions. Still, some 
individuals – and medical students in particular – may be attracted by this 
app, which helps them take voice notes, text and images when treating patients.
iPhone

Ku: Shroud of the Morrigan (£1.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ku-shroud-of-the-morrigan/id581362461?mt=8>

Dublin developer bitSmith games has a hit on its hands in its native Ireland 
with Ku: Shroud of the Morrigan, but the game deserves a wider audience too. 
It's an action-RPG with plenty of monsters and puzzles to negotiate, but its 
appeal is as much in its lovely hand-drawn graphics.
iPad

D.O.T. Defender of Texel (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/d.o.t.-defender-of-texel-rpg/id577574041?mt=8>

Here's a game from Japanese social games giant DeNA (well, its Mobage 
subsidiary) which sees you doing battle with robots and dragons in a pixelly 
8-bit universe. Your job is to explore the world, evolve your characters and 
tinker with battle formations to get the best results.
iPhone

Tomo Garage (£0.69) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tomo-garage/id590412417?mt=8>

There are dozens – if not hundreds – of independent developers making quirky, 
fun apps for children. Thats Junior is one of them with Tomo Garage, which sees 
kids playing a letter-blocks game to collect virtual items, which they can then 
play with. No in-app purchases involved.
iPhone / iPad

Blue Stage by Sennheiser (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blue-stage-by-sennheiser/id587393960?mt=8>

Blue Stage is an iPad magazine for audiophiles, created by audio firm 
Sennheiser. With a new issue due every month, it'll offer a mixture of 
features, videos and music promising to "turn you from the average sound buff 
into a fully-fledged sound connoisseur".
iPad

Underground Kingdom (£1.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/underground-kingdom/id586380210?mt=8>

We've covered retro games, but what about retro game-books? Underground 
Kingdom is an attempt to rethink the Choose Your Own Adventure books that were 
all the rage in the 1980s. That means a story – complete with artwork and 
animation – with choices for you to make along the way to decide how it 
progresses.
iPad

OrSaveIt (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/orsaveit/id592139569?mt=8>

This is a great idea for anyone whose new year's resolution is "stop blowing 
my salary on booze / fags / CDs / other consumable goods that, let's face it, 
aren't going to make me happy in the long run (possibly)". The idea: you choose 
an amount of money that you want to save, and then tell the app every time you 
DON'T spend money on a range of things – which counts up against your saving 
goal.
iPhone

DataMan Next (£0.69) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dataman-next-track-data-usage/id592962356?mt=8>

DataMan Next could also be a handy money-saver, but this time to track data 
usage on youriPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> in 
real-time, so you know when you're in danger of going over your limit. 
Colourful alerts make it even clearer when you're at risk of slamming into 
per-MB charges.
iPhone

Chromasphere (£0.69) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chromasphere/id541260483?mt=8>

Steering balls around multi-levelled, ahem, levels has a long and rich history 
on all gaming platforms, so Chromasphere has a reassuringly familiar feel. It 
uses the accelerometer to guide its sphere through a series of obstacle-strewn 
levels.
