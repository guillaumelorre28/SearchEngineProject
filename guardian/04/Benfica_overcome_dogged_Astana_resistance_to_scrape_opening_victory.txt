Benfica opened their Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> campaign with a 2-0 
victory over group stage new boys Astana in Lisbon.

Astana – a club only founded six years ago – became the first Kazakh side to 
reach the group stages after beating Cypriot side Apoel in last month’s 
play-off round and refused to be overawed at the Estádio da Luz.

They provided resilient opposition in the first half and the striker Aleksei 
Schetkin struck a post from six yards out within seconds of the restart.


Second-half goals from Nico Gaitán and Kostas Mitroglou gave Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> a winning start in Group C 
before tougher tests against Galatasaray and Atlético Madrid.

Astana knew they would have to soak up early Benfica pressure and Eric was 
forced into a smart second-minute save from Talisca. Junior Kabananga saw his 
shot blocked for the visitors but Benfica were dominating possession and Eliseu 
missed the target when well placed.

Foxi Kethevoama sent a shot across Benfica bows with Astana’s first on-target 
effort but Júlio César held his free-kick at the second attempt.

Benfica struggled to create openings as the first period drew to a close, 
although Talisca fired wide from 25 yards and Eric used his feet well to block 
Oliveira Jonas’ shot on the stroke of half-time, but they closed out the 
victory in comfortable fashion.

Gaitan broke the deadlock after 51 minutes when the Argentinian winger broke 
onto Mitroglou’s pass and powered a shot under the body of Astana goalkeeper 
Nenad Eric.

Mitroglou, the Greece striker on loan from Fulham, added a second 11 minutes 
later when he atoned for an earlier bad miss by tapping home Eliseu’s low 
centre across goal. Gaitan went close to his second of the night but Eric did 
well to hold his attempt from 12 yards out.
