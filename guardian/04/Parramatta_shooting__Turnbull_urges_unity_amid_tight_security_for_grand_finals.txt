Malcolm Turnbull has called for unity and says Australians should “go on and 
lead our lives” in the wake of what he described as the “cold-blooded murder” 
of aNew South Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales>
 police employee by a 15-year-old in an “act of terrorism”.

Curtis Cheng, who had worked in the NSW police finance department for 17 
years, was leaving the state crime command in Parramatta in Sydney’s west on 
Friday afternoon when he was shot from behind at close range by the teenager.

His killer, who has not been named but was born in Iran and from a 
Iraqi-Kurdish background, was then shot dead as officers returned fire.

The prime minister said the Muslim community would be “shocked and appalled” 
by the killing and issued a warning against vilifying or shaming the community 
for the actions of “a very, very small percentage”.

He warned that any attempt to blame the Muslim community would be utterly 
counterproductive.

“The Muslim community are our absolutely necessary partners in combating this 
type of violent extremism,” he said.

Turnbull said the government could never guarantee that attacks would not take 
place, but that security agencies were working to prevent them and that 
Australians must “go on and lead our lives” and not be deterred from events 
such as the grand finals.

“We have challenges, terrorism is one of them. But they must never divert us 
from our commitment to being free Australians, working together to ensure we 
achieve our common goals,” he said.

Turnbull also said he had received advice from the Asio director general 
Duncan Lewis and the Australian federal police commissioner, Andrew Colvin, 
about the shooting.

The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, echoed Turnbull’s comments, 
reassuring Australians the country’s security and police agencies were among 
the best in the world and that people should not be deterred from attending the 
AFL or NRL grand finals this weekend.

“At times like this, it’s critical that we guard against dangerous division – 
we are stronger and safer when we stand together,” he said.

“We must not surrender the very qualities and liberties that we seek to 
protect.”

Baird said it was a “chilling act” and his thoughts were with the family of 
Cheng.


“(But) the important message as part of this is we have to go on with our 
lives,” he told the media inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> on Saturday.

“This is an incredibly important weekend both here and in Melbourne in terms 
of grand finals. They should go on and they will go on.”

“There’s no doubt that this tragedy will echo around the world, as people try 
and understand how someone so young could admit such a hideous crime,” Mr Baird 
said.

“I can assure you, we will as the Commissioner said, get to the bottom of it. 
We will understand it and we will take the actions necessary as that 
information comes to hand. But I do want to say this – it is important that 
this city stays together, that this state stays together.

“We cannot let actions such as this divide us. We cannot let hate overtake us. 
We have to come together, and I’m sure that’s what we’ll see from this city and 
state.”

The New South Wales police commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said those 
organising security at the AFL and NRL grand finals had taken the events of 
Friday into consideration.

“The planning around these events doesn’t just happen five minutes before 
kick-off,” he said.

“There will be a very high police presence regardless (but) you may well 
expect to see higher visibility.”

Scipione said stopping the radicalisation of people was “the global question 
at the moment” but repeated the calls for unity.

“Simply because a person is of the Muslim faith doesn’t mean they are a 
terrorist,” he said.

“We shouldn’t be treating entire communities like they are all suspects, 
because that’s simply not the case. This is a small, small, small minority,” he 
said.
