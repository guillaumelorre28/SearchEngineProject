, Boris Johnson wascriticised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/24/boris-johnson-foreign-secretary-criticised-munich-shooting-islamist-terrorists>
 for publicly speculating that Islamist extremism was behind the shooting in 
Munich.

While our new foreign secretary’s comments may have been inappropriate - and 
wrong - his brain, like most people’s, was subject to an overwhelming impulse 
to find a possible motivation for an action as soon as it occurs.

Our desire to understand the motivations of a killer involves a particular 
part of the brain called the ‘temporo-parietal junction’. Also known as the 
‘mindreading’ area of the brain, it automatically ascribes possible incentives, 
beliefs and desires to others.

This reflex developed to help us socialise, but is so powerful that we also 
apply it to inanimate objects such as computers, shouting, ‘Why are you doing 
this to me?’ as they crash yet again. Evena pair of triangles

motivations, as proved by a psychological test called the Heider-Simmel 
animation.

However, while Boris’s brain is partly to blame for his speculations, 
unfortunately it couldn’t help him keep them to himself.
