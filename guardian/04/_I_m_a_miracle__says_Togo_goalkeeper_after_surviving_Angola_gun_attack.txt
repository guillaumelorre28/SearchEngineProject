The Togo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/togo> goalkeeper Kodjovi 
Obilalé feels he is akin to "a miracle" after surviving the attack on the team 
bus in Angola.

The 25-year-old was travelling to the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> with the rest of his 
team-mates prior to the start of the competition when they were shot at with 
machine guns in the Cabinda region of the country.

Three people died in the 8 January incident – the bus driver, an assistant 
coach and a press officer – while Obilalé, who was initially also reported as 
dead, had to be flown to South Africa for emergency treatment after sustaining 
gunshot wounds in the lower back and abdomen.

"I'm a miracle," the France-based goalkeeper told L'Equipe newspaper from 
Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, where he has been since the attack. "I'm 
alive, I'm doing well, I'm talking, eating and breathing.

"I want to go back home. When the tension increases in me, I lose it, I want 
to break everything. I want to see my children again and be back with those 
closest to me."
