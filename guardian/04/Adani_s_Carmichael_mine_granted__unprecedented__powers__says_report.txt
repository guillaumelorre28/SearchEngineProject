Powers granted by the Queensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government for Adani’s 
proposed Carmichael mine are unprecedented for a private commercial 
development, new findings reveal.

Legal analysis by the Environmental Defenders Office in Queensland provided 
exclusively to Guardian Australia ahead of its public release on Thursday shows 
that the broad powers have previously applied only to essential endeavours.

Anthony Lynham, the state minister for natural resources and mines, declared 
the Carmichael mine

 and its associated infrastructure a “prescribed project” and “critical 
infrastructure” on 7 October.

There has been only a handful of critical infrastructure declared since laws 
enabling it were introduced to the State Development and Public Works 
Organisation Act in 2006. Most of the five relate to water supply.

Most notably, in 2007, the then infrastructure minister declared parts of the 
water grid in south-east Queensland critical infrastructure because that region 
was experiencing unprecedented drought.

Jo-Anne Bragg, chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office 
Queensland, said the use of a declaration power “largely designed to protect 
Queensland from the worsening effects of drought” for the Adani Carmichael 
combined project was “deeply inappropriate”.

At the time of the declaration Lynham told the Sunday Mail 
<http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/queensland-government/adani-mine-will-controversial-mines-hurdles-ever-be-cleared/news-story/3eb71447183bf160cca8a269e90610ac>
: “This is a critical project. The government is serious about seeing it 
happen. We have to get jobs happening for central and northern Queensland.”

Under the law governing critical infrastructure, the coordinator general may 
speed up or progress assessment and, with ministerial consent, step in and take 
control of any legal decision still required for the project to proceed.

At that point opportunities for the community to interrogate the impacts of 
the project on groundwater may be limited.

The Queensland courts are also stripped of their usual statutory powers to 
review and determine the lawfulness of any decisions that might be made by the 
coordinator general.

Bragg said this meant the critical infrastructure declaration “could be used 
to potentially short-circuit legal protection for vital groundwater resources”.

“We believe the provision has been wrongly used in its application to the 
Adani project, and believe this could open the floodgates to all manner of 
major private developments demanding to be fast-tracked through the assessment 
process,” she said.

She recommended that the state government revoke both declarations to assure 
Queenslanders that proper procedure would be followed, and for the State 
Development Act to be amended to constrain the broad powers of the coordinator 
general in future.

The Environmental Defenders Office’s analysis found that the Adani coal 
project was assessed faster than the average time taken for major coordinated 
projects in Queensland.

A review of the Queensland government’s “coordinated projects” website showed 
that the average time between the lodgment of an initial advice statement by a 
proponent and the delivery of a coordinator general report was four to five 
years.

In the case of the Carmichael mine only three and a half years passed between 
Adani lodging the initial advice statement for the project and the delivery of 
the coordinator general’s report.

“Despite the size and impact of the Adani mine, the proposal has passed 
through the process in less time than an average comparable project,” Bragg 
said.

“The government needs to stop bowing to industry pressure and instead ensure 
that the impacts on our precious and irreplaceable groundwater resources are 
thoroughly scrutinised.”

A spokeswoman for the coordinator general’s office confirmed to Guardian 
Australia that the Adani mine was the first commercial project to be determined 
critical infrastructure.

Asked why it merited these powers, and whether its approval was fast-tracked 
in any way, shereferred to the statement
