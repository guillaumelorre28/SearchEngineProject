Apple has issued a “fix” for battery life complaints from users of its new 
MacBook Pro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/apple-macbook-pro-review-the-best-computer-you-shouldnt-buy>
 and other Mac computers.


The latest MacOS update, 10.12.2, has tackled the issue of frequently 
inaccurate battery life estimates by removing the feature. The change means 
users will no longer be provided with any estimate of how long theirApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> laptop battery will last, except 
the percentage left, and therefore be unaware when it underperforms.

The update which “improved the stability, compatibility and performance” of 
Mac computers and is “recommended for users”.

Battery life estimates have always been notoriously unreliable. Some point to 
the power consumption variability of modern processors, which have the ability 
to ramp their performance up and down in response to the task at hand and 
therefore alter their power requirements, as the biggest issue in attempting to 
calculate the remaining time left.

Some of Apple’s laptops also include two graphics cards – one energy efficient 
integrated GPU and one discreet, more powerful one. When the graphics demands 
of an app currently running breach a threshold, the power-hungry graphics card 
fires up, which has a significant impact on battery life.

But many users are unhappy with the removal of the feature.

1/ Mac time remaining indicator: as a realtime countdown, useless. Nothing can 
reliably predict the energy that'll be used in the future.

2/ Mac time remaining indicator: as a frequently updated factor that 
fluctuates and alludes to major changes in power draw, MEGA USEFUL.

3/ "Power dropped four hours since I checked it an hour ago? Better close some 
apps!"

Microsoft’s Windows 10 continues to give estimates of battery life under 
similar conditions with the same types of processor and graphics card 
configurations. Apple’s battery meter is now limited to percentage remaining 
only.
