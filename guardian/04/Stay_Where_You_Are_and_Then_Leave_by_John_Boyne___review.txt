This is yet another brilliant book by John Boyne, author of The Boy in the 
Striped Pyjamas. He gets across to children what it would be like for a child 
during the first world war.

Alfie is a five-year-old boy when his dad signs up to join the army in 1914. 
Alfie starts off well, adapting to not having father around. He enjoyed 
receiving letters from him. When no more letters are received, Alfie starts to 
get suspicious. He discovers that his father is ill in hospital because of 
shell shock. He sets on a mission, a mission to save his father.

This magnificent book is written in the third person and is talking about the 
way Alfie saw things. Stay Where You Are and Then Leave is a thoughtful book, 
but funny in places. I think it is suitable for age 10â€“12.
