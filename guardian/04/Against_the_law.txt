Homosexuality is illegal under section 377 of the Indian penal code, which 
outlaws "carnal acts against the order of nature". The law was passed by 
British colonialists during the 1860s and means that penetrative sex between 
two men is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Convictions under the law are rare, but police around the country use it to 
harass men who have sex with men. Outreach workers at Mithrudu, a community 
organisation for men who have sex with men in Hyderabad, complain that abuse by 
the police stops them from doing their jobs.

"We were being beaten up by the police, having our money taken," an outreach 
worker says. "They accused us of promoting homosexuality. They would say, 'You 
should stop all of those things, I will inform your family.' We can't even give 
out condoms; they will harass us."

The police also forced Mithrudu to remove an image of two men having sex from 
their HIV education booklet. Pictures such as this are an important part of HIV 
education: an image of a heterosexual couple under a duvet with a symbol of a 
condom above it is hardly going to get the message across to a man who has sex 
with men outside in the bushes.

Advocacy with the police has been successful say the men at Mithrudu, and the 
picture is back in their booklet. ID cards for outreach workers signed by the 
police sub-inspector have also helped, but there is a constant battle to 
educate new recruits.
