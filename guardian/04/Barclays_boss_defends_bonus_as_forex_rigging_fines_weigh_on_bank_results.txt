The boss of Barclays <https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> has been 
forced to defend his £5.5m pay packet as the bank set aside £1.25bn in 
preparation for a wave of fines and penalties for rigging foreign exchange 
markets.

Antony Jenkins – who is in the midst of cutting 19,000 jobs  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-to-cut-19000-jobs-scale-back-investment-bank-antony-jenkins>
and scaling back the once dominant investment bank – said he would take his 
first annual bonus of £1.1m since taking the helm in the wake of the 2012 
Libor-fixing scandal.

“I completely understand that I am very well remunerated for what I do. But 
... I think it is appropriate that I accept my bonus,” said Jenkins, who 
revealed he was taxed on his worldwide income both in the UK and, as a green 
card holder, in the US. The bank provided a comparative figure of £1.6m for his 
pay in 2013.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said his £5.5m pay would take 
someone working full time on the minimum wage 465 years to earn.

A spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign said: “Bonus season has again been 
dominated by pay controversies, scandals and fines – underlining that too 
little reform has taken place in the sector.”

However, the Institute of Directors, which was very critical of the bank a 
year agofor increasing bonuses as profits tumbled, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/11/barclays-hikes-bonuses-profits-slide>
 felt placated by the fall in the bonus pool to £1.9bn, 22% down on a year ago.


Profits were knocked 21% lower to £2.3bn by a string of legal and regulatory 
issues, including £1.1bn for compensating people missold payment protection 
insurance.

A £935m hit for the way loans for education, social housing and local 
authorities are valued also ate into the bottom line although the bank 
preferred to focus on adjusted profits, which increased by 12% to £5.5bn.

The bank acknowledged that part of the fall in the bonus pool was the result 
of separate allowances being handed out, alongside salaries and bonuses, to 
sidestep the EU bonus cap. The cap limits bonuses to one times salary or twice 
if shareholders approve.


With these allowances stripped out the bonus pool was down 11%. The bank said 
359 people earned more than £1m, compared with 481 the year before. Three 
received more than £5m, including one who received around £10m.

Meanwhile, 72,262 staff were paid £25,000 or less. These are likely to be 
branch staff as well as those in India, where it employs more than 12,000 
people, and across Africa.

The investment bank, which grew rapidly under Jenkins’ predecessor Bob 
Diamond, reported a 32% fall in profits to £1.3bn and an increase in its 
cost-income ratio – a measure of efficiency – to 82% from 77%.


Bonuses in the division were down by 24%, on one measure, although the bank 
insisted payouts to staff had fallen in line with profits.

Simon Walker, the IoD director general, said: “The group as a whole appears to 
be taking significant steps to change its structure and improve its internal 
culture.”

Jenkins said the investment bank could be cut back after its return on equity 
– a measure of performance – was 2.7%, far below the 12% being targeted. “I’m 
not a very patient person,” he said.

Jenkins is also cutting high street branches – 91 were shut last year – as 
customers switch to banking online or via digital channels instead.


In its legal warnings, Barclays said another unnamed regulator was 
investigating its 2008 fundraising from investors in Qatar. The Financial 
Conduct Authority wants to fine the bank £50m.


It also facing scrutiny from the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of 
Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Barclays also 
noted it was providing information to the US justice department in an 
unconnected investigation into precious metals trading.

After withdrawing from an industry-wide settlement last year, when six banks 
were fined £2.6b 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/foreign-exchange-fines-ubs-hsbc-citibank-jp-morgan-rbs-penalties-market-rigging>
n, Barclays is yet to be fined for rigging foreign markets. It will find out by 
27 June if the potential fine will have an impact on the non-prosecution 
agreement that the bank signed with the justice department at the time of its 
2012 Libor fine.

Sir John Sunderland, chair of the the remuneration committee, said the bonus 
pool had been reduced as a result of the anticipated fines for foreign exchange 
manipulation and that bonuses were being withheld from some staff.


The bank is paying a 6.5p dividend for the year – lower than the City had been 
expecting. The shares fell more than 2%.
