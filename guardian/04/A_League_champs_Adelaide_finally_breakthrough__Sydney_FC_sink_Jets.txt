Henrique scored two screamers as the Reds climbed from the bottom of the 
A-League table with a 2-0 win against Wellington.

Henrique’s double came in a 15-minute span in Sunday’s first half as Adelaide 
banked a breakthrough first win of the season.

Wellington are now at the foot of the ladder after being jumped by Adelaide, 
who held a 2-0 lead from 40 minutes into their home match.

Henrique’s brilliant brace highlighted the Coopers Stadium clash.

First, he opened scoring with a thundering left-footer in the 26th minute 
after being played into space, and range, by the industrious James Holland.

The Brazilian then topped that feat within a quarter-hour, pounding a 20m 
blast into the net – after being set up via Isaias from an Adelaide corner, 
Henrique’s launch sailed at terrific pace barely head-high before smacking into 
the net.

Adelaide’s tide, and perhaps season, had earlier turned on their captain and 
goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic, whose diving save of a Roy Krishna penalty in the 
20th minute inspired the locals.

Galekovic was busy but assured through the first half, making five saves when 
the Phoenix attacked on the break but Adelaide had their measure.

The trend continued in the second stanza: despite the best efforts of Phoenix 
playmaker Kosta Barbarouses, Adelaide’s defence remained resolute.

Barbarouses fed substitute Hamish Watson for a tap-in, only to be adjudged 
offside in arguably the brightest moment in a lacklustre half from the New 
Zealanders.

The Reds, with Spanish striker Sergi Guardiola threatening and Marcelo 
Carrusca influential in midfield, controlled the tempo en route to a victory 
achieved without suspensed coach Guillermo Amor, who watched from the stands 
for a second game in a row after being banned for making contact with a fourth 
official.

Adelaide’s caretaker coach Pau Marti described the win as satisfying.

“It was a deserved win,” he said.

“It’s a good moment for the players, for the team, for the club because we did 
enough to get this three points so lets enjoy it.”

Wellington coach Ernie Merrick again lamented a lack of polish in his charges.

“I thought we started off well, we were pretty solid at the back, our midfield 
was gaining control,” Merrick said.

“And when we missed the penalty, I think that lifted the Adelaide boys and 
some of our boys dropped their head a little bit.”

Sydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> have corrected a 
slight wobble in their A-League season with a 2-0 defeat of depleted battlers 
Newcastle, but will have to raise the bar further against Melbourne City next 
weekend.


Two second-half moments of brilliance from Milos Ninkovic and substitute 
Bernie Ibini ensured the Sky Blues remained unbeaten and extended their lead at 
the top of the table to six points.


Both sides had a woeful number of turnovers but the injury-ravaged Jets, who 
have now added Ben Kantarovski (knee) to their ever-growing treatment table, 
are now winless in seven games.


Mark Jones’ side showed promise on the counter-attack and Andrew Hoole found 
space on the right flank, but the former Sky Blues winger was too often without 
support for it to manifest into anything meaningful.

Sydney coach Graham Arnold had clearly hoped a shake-up to his starting XI 
would be the difference following two draws and Wednesday’s FFA Cup final loss.


Four changes is the most Arnold has made all campaign and it was telling two 
of the victims were marquees Bobo and Filip Holosko, who’ve struggled to 
maintain their searing early-season form.


Skipper Alex Brosque, David Carney and youngster George Blackwood led the 
attack but it was none of that trio who shone.


First-time starter Milos Dimitrijevic was arguably Sydney’s strongest 
performer despite having played just 12 minutes ofA-League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> football this season.


Dimitrijevic delivered a lovely through ball for Brosque early on and laid off 
the pass for Ninkovic’s 63rd-minute goal, though could not take credit for the 
marauding solo effort of his fellow Serb, who eased past three defenders and 
drilled home his fifth goal of the season.


As Arnold started to ring the changes more began to happen, and Ibini’s 
introduction proved the most fruitful.


Running out of space just wide of the penalty area, the 24-year-old used some 
slick footwork to weave around two Jets defenders before beating another and 
making two attempts at Jack Duncan’s goal, the second nestling into the corner.
