It might be the sexiest come-on in film history. Truck-stop waitress Bonnie 
Parker (Faye Dunaway) has been waiting her whole life for something to happen. 
Then, one sweltering day she eyes a man – the kind momma warned against – 
loitering by the car. Liking what she sees, she arranges herself naked at the 
window, calling out: "Hey boy," in an easy drawl. A cocksure smirk spreads 
across Clyde Barrow's (Warren Beatty) face. Within minutes she is caressing the 
shaft of his pistol. Bonnie and Clyde: they consummate their first robbery 
before formal introductions.

"Who'd want to see the rise and fall of a couple of rats?" asked a studio 
executive at Warner Brothers, which grudgingly financed the film. In 1967, 
plenty wanted to watchBonnie and Clyde

Influenced by New Wavers François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard (both were 
offered the script before it went to Arthur Penn), this was sex and violence 
done in the spirit of European arthouse. Dunaway smoulders (enjoying a killer 
fashion moment in those berets), more than a match for Beatty's strutting, 
cheap charms. For better or worse, going out convulsing in a hail of bullets 
never looked this seductively stylish.
