Summary

Well. How bout that. At 2-0 up it looked all Easy Rider with Bruno Fornaroli 
as Dennis Hopper – but you can’t discount the reigning Premiers and Champions, 
even with this horrific injury list. A great attempted fightback, but to no 
avail – Amor can take heart, but for his men it’s a third-consecutive 2-1 loss.

City looked very good value for all three points for a good two-thirds of that 
encounter but without the experienced heads of Cahill and Jakobsen (also 
Sorensen) on the pitch you just worried for a moment that they might roll over.

Adelaide perhaps lacking a real link player in attack – the Carrusca role, if 
you will, to link up with Guardiola, who despite his toil looked isolated at 
times. Kitto showed promise once more, and all of the Adelaide youngsters who 
came in offered hope for the future, but you very much wonder what a Cirio or 
Henrique might have brought to that last ten minutes.

Van ‘t Schip will take that, you’d hazard, after City’s FFA Cup heroics 
midweek. It’s a third win in four, and they roll on nicely in the league after 
last week’s upset at the hands of Perth.

Full-time: Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United

90 + 4 min: “They think it’s all over – it is now”.

A courageous late challenge from the Reds, but it’s all in vain. City have the 
three points, and a relieved John van ‘t Schip puffs out the cheeks.

Over-exuberance in the corner though, and that’s a freekick to City. Is that it?

90 min: Handball called against Muscat, accidental, but still the case. 
Kilkenny and Malik break up the play, and Brandan heads for the corner flag.

McGree does well in midfield and now the Reds attack down the left. Choi and 
Garuccio look to double up on Muscat, but the former Nix player stands tall. 
Good defending.

Now it’s Brandan off for a time-sapping substitution.

Have they done enough City?

89 min: Adelaide with the lion’s share of possession, as you’d expect – they 
still build patiently, probing and prying, to see if they can find an opening.

It’s been all round the outside and down the flanks from both sides tonight, 
neither have necessarily really split each other straight down the guts.

87 min: Caceres then brings down Elrich – it’s getting scrappy right at the 
finish.

Choi whips in another good ball, and Chapman is forced to clear his lines. 
Corner to Adelaide – Choi to send in once again.

He finds La Rocca! But it’s header wide, amid heavy traffic.

85 min: Now it’s Brattan that heads to the bench, van ‘t Schip is staggering 
his substitutions here to break up the momentum, as is his prerogative. On 
comes Caceres.

Definitely a tug on La Rocca, replays suggest, but I’d warrant perhaps a harsh 
one if that was handed a penalty.

Now Elrich goes straight through Brandan who rolls between sixteen and 
twenty-seven times; he got the ball first, yes, but some definite feeling 
there. A leveller for the Argentine’s early horror-tackle?

83 min: Ooh, McGowan appeals for a penalty – was there a tug on La Rocca? 
Chris Beath says no, but they might have had a shout there, Chapman the alleged 
infringer.

Choi looking lively on the left flank, he’s been lively since his inclusion.

81 min: Muscat fouls Guardiola, Choi looks to beat his marker out wide. Now he 
clips in another cross, but Bouzanis dives to intercept.

Elrich looks to cross, but a bubbling deflection of the shin of Brandan almost 
sets up a calamity! Bouzanis backpedals rapidly and just tips it over! What an 
equaliser that could have been.

Corner to the Reds, they’re starting to build something now.

79 min: Marc Marino – remember him, City fans? He’s just come on for Adelaide 
– what can this young striker fashion?

La Rocca flashes a header just wide after a very fine ball in from Isaias. And 
then Retre also goes in the book, City’s fifth, for a cynical break in play 
with McGree racing through.

Is it starting to bubble nicely? What type of last ten do we have in store?

Bruce Kamau heads off, he’s replaced by Nick Fitzgerald.

77 min: A scampering counter attack with Brandan driving the charge through 
the middle. As Adelaide push further forward for the equaliser gaps 
increasingly open up.

But the Argentine then blots his copybook with a frankly horror tackle on 
Elrich. Shades of Santalab in that one as he leaps in two-footedly, and catches 
the right back.

Elrich looks okay, thankfully, and it’s a yellow for Brandan.

71 min: A sixth corner for the home side, after fine close control from 
Fornaroli. It’s not Brattan’s best – before Fornaroli and Kamau combine to test 
Galekovic at his near post, and in the process picking up another corner. So 
lively – and would you believe it, the same combination have almost picked each 
other out on a lightning counter attack.

Result? A corner.

68 min: So game on now – that’s taken the bravado out of the home crowd. To 
their credit they’re still cheering their side with voice and drum.

Isaias picks out the youngster, O’Doherty, but his final ball is poor. City 
look to counter now, but it’s Retre with a sloppy final pass for Kamau. No 
excuses for midweek tiredness there, Retre only made a cameo of the bench.

66 min: Choi comes on and Kilkenny goes into the book – gifting United another 
freekick set piece. Surely they can’t fashion a quick-fire double?

It’s intricately worked – which as always is code for: “they tried something 
really tricky, and completely botched it”.

Goal! Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United (Garrucio)

64 min: Welly, well, well, well! With City apparently very much in control 
it’s a moment of real quality from Garuccio who jinks round his opposite number 
and puts a tantalising cross in.

Guardiola bisects his markers, Chapman and Malik, far too easily – were they 
expecting the ‘keeper to come claim just then?

Oh dear, City – let’s hope their trademarked ‘fragility’ from seasons past 
isn’t about to rear again!

60 min: Home fans now in fine fettle, and why not – even without Tim Cahill 
their lads are putting on another imposing display thus far.

Garuccio with a long raking ball looking for Guardiola – almost a miracle ball 
there but it’s well intercepted by Chapman.

Kamau goes down with cramp; he’s only just back from that Dino 
Djulbic-inspired concussion, so perhaps a touch short of full match fitness.

57 min: Well, we made much of City’s midweek heroics, and how they might be 
facing some tiredness late in this game – but can anyone see Adelaide getting 
three here?

They’ve not created great moments (two strikes of the frame aside, that is) 
but Reds fans will hope they only need one.

29 goals in 33 A-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> games 
for Bruno Fornaroli. Now that is some track record.

Goal! Melbourne City 2-0 Adelaide United (Fornaroli, pen)

55 min: How do you like that! Facing one of the best shot-stoppers in the 
history of theA-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league>, Bruno 
clips it straight and high – it’s a panenka and Galekovic has no chance!

52 min: Now it’s Elrich in the book – the fourth yellow card of the evening.

Fornaroli tries another shot, and as City win a corner it’s Makarounas who 
joins his teammate with a booking, for his late clattering tackle on Fornaroli.

Ooh, it’s going from bad to worse for Adelaide here – the balls played in and 
it’s Brandan with the header, and it strikes the out-raised arm of Sergio 
Guardiola!

What does Chris Beath say? Yes, penalty!

50 min: Garuccio getting the better of Kamau on that occasion, great little 
tussle that one. Now it’s Brattan who rotates into the wide space as Kamau cuts 
inside, and his side have won a corner.

Short corner combination between Brattan and Kamau and an excellent ball puts 
it on a platter for Fornaroli! He heads over from about six yards – too much on 
that already stinging cross from Brattan.

47 min: For fans of the AAMI Park seagulls, be assured they are out in strong 
numbers tonight. REALLY, strong numbers. Reminds me of a Test match about 
fifteen years back when one of the batsman cracked an unwitting pigeon out on 
boundary, and Bill Lawry in commentary was almost beside himself with emotion.

Second half: Melbourne City 1-0 Adelaide United

45 min: And we’re back (as I brush chip crumbs off the keyboard). Don’t tell 
the big boss. No changes from either manager, not that you’d have necessarily 
fancied any after that first offering – no real weak spots or glaring tactical 
deficiencies.

Troy Henderson’s offered his thoughts on that Kilkenny-Isaias flashpoint:

“Six of one half a dozen of the other”.

Thanks there, both a touch cryptic, and arguably entirely fair. Isaias did 
make contact with the face of the City player but he really did make a meal of 
it – and certainly by rugby standards it was nowhere near a decent ol’ 
eye-gouging.

Your two cents otherwise on that first opening stanza?

Feel free to offer us your version of what happened there – bonus points if 
you only use emojis.

So, City very much in control under the watchful eyes of Ange Postecoglou. 
Brattan and Kamau pulling the strings with Brandan and Fornaroli lively as 
always.

The half-time stats suggest it was more even than perhaps it looked; City only 
shading possession 53-47% but they did presumably a lot more with it. Nine 
shots to four – and except for that late, late header all the best efforts came 
from City.

An update on Fornaroli’s yellow card – for touching the referee apparently. 
Not inappropriately, obviously. But also, inappropriately, by the letter of the 
law.

Half-time: Melbourne City 1-0 Adelaide United

45 min: Wow. Great drama right at the death! It’s Adelaide with a freekick and 
remarkably after all that’s happened in the first 45 minutes it’s only the 
width of the crossbar that’s prevented the Reds from going in on an even 
standing!

Great ball to the far post and there’s a run that’s not been picked up – I 
want to say Kitto, but to be deadly honest the bl**dy office cleaners just 
turned the vacuum on and I’ve missed the commentary..

It is ALL happening here at Guardian HQ; as well as at AAMI Park evidently.

42 min: Not sure if Foxsports still has their Cahill-Cam option on, but as 
things on the pitch drift into a lull we’re treated to an extensive close up of 
the Socceroo great in the crowd in his civvies.

It’s another freekick for City now, and it’s Brattan to deliver.

Ooh, wickedly curled in – just evades the first man and it flies off an 
Adelaide boot behind for a corner! That could have gone absolutely anywhere.

From the resulting corner it’s Kamau who has a shot cleared off the line, 
before Fornaroli lofts an attempted effort just over the bar.

Real hearts-in-mouths moments for Reds fans there; they’ll take a half-time 
whistle about now you’d hazard.

40 min: Adelaide continue to play out from the back, and this time it’s 
Garuccio who’s almost caught in possession by Kamau. They have to be careful 
the Reds – they’re not subscribing to once bitten, twice shy – and fair enough, 
that’s the way Amor has them playing, and presumably he’ll take the good with 
the bad.

37 min: Well, maybe there is some spite out there – Kilkenny and Isaias have a 
coming together and the City midfield falls to the ground dramatically. He’s 
claiming a poke in the eye, but that looks a touch far-fetched.

There’s a yellow card out – is it for simulation by Kilkenny, or a second 
yellow for the Spaniard?!

Neither – it’s for the skipper Fornaroli; not entirely sure why, perhaps 
something in the ensuing melee.

Well officiated by Chris Beath, it would have been a real game-ruiner if 
Isaias had gone then for what was, well, frankly a big load of not much.

35 min: Meanwhile it’s Isaias in the book for a block on Fornaroli. Too wily 
from the Uruguayan – good to see it’s not just agricultural Aussie defenders 
who fall for his tricks.

Kilkenny with a raking pass to find Brandan – it’s called offside but replays 
suggest that was harsh on the Argentine. Unlucky City, there was something on 
there.

33 min: Brandan tangles with Elrich, and he’s perhaps unlucky not to be booked 
the Argentine. That was a crude hack, and the three-cap Socceroo limps away 
gingerly.

He’s all bustle and bump the be-rats-tailed Brandan, but he’s the type of 
player every teammate wants.

31 min: A rare give away from Isaias and Brattan almost picks out Fornaroli 
with a long lofted pass, but La Rocca intercepts.

Meanwhile O’Doherty pins the ears back to test Manny Muscat, but doesn’t win 
the corner.

29 min: First yellow – it’s Rose in the book, and to be fair it seemed 
reasonably innocuous.

The City left back has been pinged for possibly an elbow, but it’s just a hand 
in the throat of a young opponent. Nothing malicious there.

27 min: Brattan again pulls out wide to deliver a teasing cross, he’s got such 
a strong delivery, does the former Roar man. They may have lost Aaron Mooy in 
the off-season, but they’ve not lost too much in the set piece department.

Here’s Brattan again, whipping in a fine delivery after Brandan was clattered. 
Adelaide scramble clear.

25 min: And out of nowhere, it’s Adelaide crashing one against the post! Not 
much on there, but Kitto’s done well to skip inside two defenders – his shot is 
a worm-burner and Bouzanis seems to take an age to scramble across his own goal 
– but his blushes are spared by the base of the upright.

23 min: Now it’s Fornaroli with the effort! It’s shooting fish in a barrel at 
the moment. Lovely work from Brattan, he clips a well-paced cross in to a 
charging Fornaroli, who collects at the near post but flicks his shot just wide.

Eugene Galekovic isn’t one to ever look flustered but even the veteran 
‘keeper’s eyes must have lit up then. Great passage.

21 min: Josh Rose now fires off a shot, it’s very much City in the ascendancy 
in front of their own fans. Now it’s Kilkenny and Kamau exchanging tight 
passes, but the former Birmingham City man fails to pull the trigger. Not known 
for his goals, Kilkenny, but he plays such a crucial role in the heart of the

19 min: Lovely interchange between Brattan and Kamau – gee, he’s been 
prominent the Kenyan-born winger. Great quick feet as he tries to skip round 
Garuccio, and after a pinballing moment, gets away a shot, but it’s scuffed and 
Galekovic isn’t troubled.

17 min: Great skill from Brandan to beat his man Garuccio, but the left back 
recovers to concede a corner. It’s Kamau with the header, amid a crowded pack 
of players, but it drifts to the left of Galekovic’s upright.

15 min: Straight into the wall; didn’t look the sharpest that freekick, alas 
for Reds fans.

Now it’s City looking slightly more content to sit back and allow Adelaide the 
ball at the back. Why not? It’s already reaped dividends once.

13 min: What can Adelaide muster now? It’s a daunting early task they’ve now 
been set; and it’s a stern-looking Amor scowling and prowling on the touch line.

Kamau fired the warning shot, and then banging-Bruno – gee, doesn’t he like 
hitting them at AAMI Stadium – went even better.

Meanwhile Malik goes in heavily on Guardiola. Garuccio’s left foot appears to 
fancy this one from just to the side of the box.

Goal! Melbourne City 1-0 Adelaide United (Fornaroli)

11 min: Oh dear. The Reds look to play out from the back, but it’s Elrich 
who’s trapped in possession. Great pressing from Brandan, I believe, and then 
Kamau – it falls to City’s captain just outside the box and he fires a great 
curling effort.

Galekovic, no chance – lovely strike!

10 min: Wow. Well, we said Ange was here to watch Brattan but he wouldn’t mind 
the early sightings of Kamau.

The young winger finds himself with a touch of space, jinks inside one 
defender before firing off an improbable 30m rocket – Galekovic looks to have 
it covered but it still flicks the top of the crossbar; great driven shot 
there; and inch-perfect confidence from the veteran ‘keeper in leaving it.

8 min: Bouzanis launches a quick counter looking for Kamau, but it’s just two 
long and goes into touch. Reds players remonstrating in backplay for a 
perceived late challenge from Brattan on La Rocca.

6 min: City probe down Adelaide’s right but Elrich does well to intercept. 
Well won back by O’Doherty and a sumptuous ball from Isaias finds Garuccio out 
wide. He swings in a lovely cross and it’s Mells who gets a shot away – 
deflected behind for a corner.

Nice passage, Adelaide.

4 min: Guardiola pinged for offside, the Spaniard starting his run just too 
early.

A close up of Ange Postecoglou in the stands – most likely having a good look 
at Luke Brattan who he’s named in his extended squad of 30 for the Socceroos 
next World Cup fixture against Thailand.

2 min: First early look for City, Brandan does well out wide and just for half 
a second it looks like Brattan has space on the edge of the box – but he 
dallies before trying an ambitious lofted chip that sails harmlessly over.

Chris Beath is our man with the whistle tonight so all your Shaun Evans haters 
can go back to burning ants with magnifying glasses.

There shouldn’t be excessive feeling between these two – Victory and Adelaide 
might have had their set-tos in the past, but that original SA v Vic rivalry 
hasn’t necessarily translated to these two clubs. That said, they do have a 
decent record of poaching each other’s players, so watch this space.

The players are in the tunnel, and so’s Yoshi – we’re just a few moments away.

A stack of changes for both teams therefore – for City: Thomas Sorensen 
remains on the bench with Dean Bouzanis preferred to the veteran Premier League 
shot-stopper.

Connor Chapman comes in for fellow Dane Michael Jakobsen who along with Tim 
Cahill is rested after their midweek FFA Cup heroics.

It looks like van ‘t Schip might shift back to a 4-3-3 tonight, with Osama 
Malik coming in against his old club, and Bruce Kamau also returning from 
concussion to possibly haunt his former employees.

No Henrique or James Holland for the Reds, youngster Jordan O’Doherty flies 
into the starting XI – what a big moment for the teenage forward, with George 
Mells also coming in.

Still a pretty experienced defence for the Reds, but it’s an extremely young 
looking bench. Watch for Marc Marino – released by City in May to look for

Preamble

It’s not been the ideal start to their title defence for the champions (and 
premiers) – they’ve gone within one minute of remaining unbeaten twice in a row 
– and after 90th minute slip ups against Victory and Wanderers you’d imagine 
Guillermo Amor will be dreading added time with the likes of Bruno Fornaroli 
circling.

Melbourne City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/melbourne-city> suffered 
their own late slip up last week, as a rampaging Andy Keogh upset the early 
form favourites, with his 85th minute hat-trick.

They’ll be boosted by the key announcement midweek – FFA media campaign 
poster-child Yoshi was urged #gottahaveateam, and he duly announced he’s found 
one: Melbourne City

It was a decision reportedly largely driven by the presence of Tim Cahill; but 
if the youngster has made the long trek from his home city, Sydney, to support 
his new side then he’s in for bad news; Timmy hasn’t made the squad this 
weekend after a midweek knock sustained in that bruising FFA Cup semi-final 
against rivals Melbourne Victory.

Adelaide themselves are having a horror run of injuries – after Jack Clisby’s 
crude challenge put Cirio on the sidelines for a few months now the news that 
there’s no James Holland or Henrique around tonight, let alone Marcelo Carrusca 
who remains on the sideline with a foot injury.

A tough proposition for the Reds therefore, but if anyone remembers their 
turnaround after round 8 last season, you’d be a brave person to write them off 
completely.

An intriguing match up therefore tonight, Adelaide haven’t lost on the road in 
their last eleven matches. Can a fatigued City delight their home fans, or can 
the Reds carry out a smash-and-grab mission of their own? Find out shortly.

Well. How bout that. At 2-0 up it looked all Easy Rider with Bruno Fornaroli 
as Dennis Hopper – but you can’t discount the reigning Premiers and Champions, 
even with this horrific injury list. A great attempted fightback, but to no 
avail – Amor can take heart, but for his men it’s a third-consecutive 2-1 loss.

City looked very good value for all three points for a good two-thirds of that 
encounter but without the experienced heads of Cahill and Jakobsen (also 
Sorensen) on the pitch you just worried for a moment that they might roll over.

Adelaide perhaps lacking a real link player in attack – the Carrusca role, if 
you will, to link up with Guardiola, who despite his toil looked isolated at 
times. Kitto showed promise once more, and all of the Adelaide youngsters who 
came in offered hope for the future, but you very much wonder what a Cirio or 
Henrique might have brought to that last ten minutes.

Van ‘t Schip will take that, you’d hazard, after City’s FFA Cup heroics 
midweek. It’s a third win in four, and they roll on nicely in the league after 
last week’s upset at the hands of Perth.
 
90 + 4 min: “They think it’s all over – it is now”.

A courageous late challenge from the Reds, but it’s all in vain. City have the 
three points, and a relieved John van ‘t Schip puffs out the cheeks.
 
90 + 3 min: Great chase by Guardiola he draws a throw in out of Rose. 
Over-exuberance in the corner though, and that’s a freekick to City. Is that it?
 
90 min: Handball called against Muscat, accidental, but still the case. 
Kilkenny and Malik break up the play, and Brandan heads for the corner flag.

McGree does well in midfield and now the Reds attack down the left. Choi and 
Garuccio look to double up on Muscat, but the former Nix player stands tall. 
Good defending.

Now it’s Brandan off for a time-sapping substitution.

Have they done enough City?
 
89 min: Adelaide with the lion’s share of possession, as you’d expect – they 
still build patiently, probing and prying, to see if they can find an opening.

It’s been all round the outside and down the flanks from both sides tonight, 
neither have necessarily really split each other straight down the guts.
 
87 min: Caceres then brings down Elrich – it’s getting scrappy right at the 
finish.

Choi whips in another good ball, and Chapman is forced to clear his lines. 
Corner to Adelaide – Choi to send in once again.

He finds La Rocca! But it’s header wide, amid heavy traffic.
 
85 min: Now it’s Brattan that heads to the bench, van ‘t Schip is staggering 
his substitutions here to break up the momentum, as is his prerogative. On 
comes Caceres.

Definitely a tug on La Rocca, replays suggest, but I’d warrant perhaps a harsh 
one if that was handed a penalty.

Now Elrich goes straight through Brandan who rolls between sixteen and 
twenty-seven times; he got the ball first, yes, but some definite feeling 
there. A leveller for the Argentine’s early horror-tackle?
 
83 min: Ooh, McGowan appeals for a penalty – was there a tug on La Rocca? 
Chris Beath says no, but they might have had a shout there, Chapman the alleged 
infringer.

Choi looking lively on the left flank, he’s been lively since his inclusion.
 
81 min: Muscat fouls Guardiola, Choi looks to beat his marker out wide. Now he 
clips in another cross, but Bouzanis dives to intercept.

Elrich looks to cross, but a bubbling deflection of the shin of Brandan almost 
sets up a calamity! Bouzanis backpedals rapidly and just tips it over! What an 
equaliser that could have been.

Corner to the Reds, they’re starting to build something now.
 
79 min: Marc Marino – remember him, City fans? He’s just come on for Adelaide 
– what can this young striker fashion?

La Rocca flashes a header just wide after a very fine ball in from Isaias. And 
then Retre also goes in the book, City’s fifth, for a cynical break in play 
with McGree racing through.

Is it starting to bubble nicely? What type of last ten do we have in store?

Bruce Kamau heads off, he’s replaced by Nick Fitzgerald.
 
77 min: A scampering counter attack with Brandan driving the charge through 
the middle. As Adelaide push further forward for the equaliser gaps 
increasingly open up.

But the Argentine then blots his copybook with a frankly horror tackle on 
Elrich. Shades of Santalab in that one as he leaps in two-footedly, and catches 
the right back.

Elrich looks okay, thankfully, and it’s a yellow for Brandan.
 
75 min: A break in play now as Fornaroli stays down after a challenge from 
Isaias.

You don’t want to tempt fate with 15 to come, but credit where credit is due – 
Chris Beath has adjudicated this one very capably thus far.
 
73 min: Kilkenny tries his hand at this delivery – but it’s even worse than 
Brattan’s last! Easily cut out by the Reds defence.

Another young face, Riley McGree, jogs on for Adelaide – what can he bring to 
the mix?
 
71 min: A sixth corner for the home side, after fine close control from 
Fornaroli. It’s not Brattan’s best – before Fornaroli and Kamau combine to test 
Galekovic at his near post, and in the process picking up another corner. So 
lively – and would you believe it, the same combination have almost picked each 
other out on a lightning counter attack.

Result? A corner.
 
68 min: So game on now – that’s taken the bravado out of the home crowd. To 
their credit they’re still cheering their side with voice and drum.

Isaias picks out the youngster, O’Doherty, but his final ball is poor. City 
look to counter now, but it’s Retre with a sloppy final pass for Kamau. No 
excuses for midweek tiredness there, Retre only made a cameo of the bench.
 
66 min: Choi comes on and Kilkenny goes into the book – gifting United another 
freekick set piece. Surely they can’t fashion a quick-fire double?

It’s intricately worked – which as always is code for: “they tried something 
really tricky, and completely botched it”.
 
64 min: Welly, well, well, well! With City apparently very much in control 
it’s a moment of real quality from Garuccio who jinks round his opposite number 
and puts a tantalising cross in.

Guardiola bisects his markers, Chapman and Malik, far too easily – were they 
expecting the ‘keeper to come claim just then?

Oh dear, City – let’s hope their trademarked ‘fragility’ from seasons past 
isn’t about to rear again!
 
63 min: Amor may be looking to freshen things up here – Danny Choi (he of the 
NPL and FFA Cup wonder goals) could be about to come on for just his 4th minute 
of A-League action. Incidentally Galekovic just notched up 23,000 in theA-League
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league>. Stats, eh?
 
60 min: Home fans now in fine fettle, and why not – even without Tim Cahill 
their lads are putting on another imposing display thus far.

Garuccio with a long raking ball looking for Guardiola – almost a miracle ball 
there but it’s well intercepted by Chapman.

Kamau goes down with cramp; he’s only just back from that Dino 
Djulbic-inspired concussion, so perhaps a touch short of full match fitness.
 
57 min: Well, we made much of City’s midweek heroics, and how they might be 
facing some tiredness late in this game – but can anyone see Adelaide getting 
three here?

They’ve not created great moments (two strikes of the frame aside, that is) 
but Reds fans will hope they only need one.

29 goals in 33 A-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> games 
for Bruno Fornaroli. Now that is some track record.
 
55 min: How do you like that! Facing one of the best shot-stoppers in the 
history of theA-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league>, Bruno 
clips it straight and high – it’s a panenka and Galekovic has no chance!
 
52 min: Now it’s Elrich in the book – the fourth yellow card of the evening.

Fornaroli tries another shot, and as City win a corner it’s Makarounas who 
joins his teammate with a booking, for his late clattering tackle on Fornaroli.

Ooh, it’s going from bad to worse for Adelaide here – the balls played in and 
it’s Brandan with the header, and it strikes the out-raised arm of Sergio 
Guardiola!

What does Chris Beath say? Yes, penalty!
 
50 min: Garuccio getting the better of Kamau on that occasion, great little 
tussle that one. Now it’s Brattan who rotates into the wide space as Kamau cuts 
inside, and his side have won a corner.

Short corner combination between Brattan and Kamau and an excellent ball puts 
it on a platter for Fornaroli! He heads over from about six yards – too much on 
that already stinging cross from Brattan.
 
47 min: For fans of the AAMI Park seagulls, be assured they are out in strong 
numbers tonight. REALLY, strong numbers. Reminds me of a Test match about 
fifteen years back when one of the batsman cracked an unwitting pigeon out on 
boundary, and Bill Lawry in commentary was almost beside himself with emotion. 
Scenes.
 
45 min: And we’re back (as I brush chip crumbs off the keyboard). Don’t tell 
the big boss. No changes from either manager, not that you’d have necessarily 
fancied any after that first offering – no real weak spots or glaring tactical 
deficiencies.
 
Troy Henderson’s offered his thoughts on that Kilkenny-Isaias flashpoint:

“Six of one half a dozen of the other”.

Thanks there, both a touch cryptic, and arguably entirely fair. Isaias did 
make contact with the face of the City player but he really did make a meal of 
it – and certainly by rugby standards it was nowhere near a decent ol’ 
eye-gouging.

Your two cents otherwise on that first opening stanza?
 
Feel free to offer us your version of what happened there – bonus points if 
you only use emojis.

So, City very much in control under the watchful eyes of Ange Postecoglou. 
Brattan and Kamau pulling the strings with Brandan and Fornaroli lively as 
always.

The half-time stats suggest it was more even than perhaps it looked; City only 
shading possession 53-47% but they did presumably a lot more with it. Nine 
shots to four – and except for that late, late header all the best efforts came 
from City.

An update on Fornaroli’s yellow card – for touching the referee apparently. 
Not inappropriately, obviously. But also, inappropriately, by the letter of the 
law.
 
45 min: Wow. Great drama right at the death! It’s Adelaide with a freekick and 
remarkably after all that’s happened in the first 45 minutes it’s only the 
width of the crossbar that’s prevented the Reds from going in on an even 
standing!

Great ball to the far post and there’s a run that’s not been picked up – I 
want to say Kitto, but to be deadly honest the bl**dy office cleaners just 
turned the vacuum on and I’ve missed the commentary..

It is ALL happening here at Guardian HQ; as well as at AAMI Park evidently.
 
42 min: Not sure if Foxsports still has their Cahill-Cam option on, but as 
things on the pitch drift into a lull we’re treated to an extensive close up of 
the Socceroo great in the crowd in his civvies.

It’s another freekick for City now, and it’s Brattan to deliver.

Ooh, wickedly curled in – just evades the first man and it flies off an 
Adelaide boot behind for a corner! That could have gone absolutely anywhere.

From the resulting corner it’s Kamau who has a shot cleared off the line, 
before Fornaroli lofts an attempted effort just over the bar.

Real hearts-in-mouths moments for Reds fans there; they’ll take a half-time 
whistle about now you’d hazard.
 
40 min: Adelaide continue to play out from the back, and this time it’s 
Garuccio who’s almost caught in possession by Kamau. They have to be careful 
the Reds – they’re not subscribing to once bitten, twice shy – and fair enough, 
that’s the way Amor has them playing, and presumably he’ll take the good with 
the bad.
 
37 min: Well, maybe there is some spite out there – Kilkenny and Isaias have a 
coming together and the City midfield falls to the ground dramatically. He’s 
claiming a poke in the eye, but that looks a touch far-fetched.

There’s a yellow card out – is it for simulation by Kilkenny, or a second 
yellow for the Spaniard?!

Neither – it’s for the skipper Fornaroli; not entirely sure why, perhaps 
something in the ensuing melee.

Well officiated by Chris Beath, it would have been a real game-ruiner if 
Isaias had gone then for what was, well, frankly a big load of not much.
 
35 min: Meanwhile it’s Isaias in the book for a block on Fornaroli. Too wily 
from the Uruguayan – good to see it’s not just agricultural Aussie defenders 
who fall for his tricks.

Kilkenny with a raking pass to find Brandan – it’s called offside but replays 
suggest that was harsh on the Argentine. Unlucky City, there was something on 
there.
 
33 min: Brandan tangles with Elrich, and he’s perhaps unlucky not to be booked 
the Argentine. That was a crude hack, and the three-cap Socceroo limps away 
gingerly.

He’s all bustle and bump the be-rats-tailed Brandan, but he’s the type of 
player every teammate wants.
 
31 min: A rare give away from Isaias and Brattan almost picks out Fornaroli 
with a long lofted pass, but La Rocca intercepts.

Meanwhile O’Doherty pins the ears back to test Manny Muscat, but doesn’t win 
the corner.
 
29 min: First yellow – it’s Rose in the book, and to be fair it seemed 
reasonably innocuous.

The City left back has been pinged for possibly an elbow, but it’s just a hand 
in the throat of a young opponent. Nothing malicious there.
 
27 min: Brattan again pulls out wide to deliver a teasing cross, he’s got such 
a strong delivery, does the former Roar man. They may have lost Aaron Mooy in 
the off-season, but they’ve not lost too much in the set piece department.

Here’s Brattan again, whipping in a fine delivery after Brandan was clattered. 
Adelaide scramble clear.
 
25 min: And out of nowhere, it’s Adelaide crashing one against the post! Not 
much on there, but Kitto’s done well to skip inside two defenders – his shot is 
a worm-burner and Bouzanis seems to take an age to scramble across his own goal 
– but his blushes are spared by the base of the upright.
 
23 min: Now it’s Fornaroli with the effort! It’s shooting fish in a barrel at 
the moment. Lovely work from Brattan, he clips a well-paced cross in to a 
charging Fornaroli, who collects at the near post but flicks his shot just wide.

Eugene Galekovic isn’t one to ever look flustered but even the veteran 
‘keeper’s eyes must have lit up then. Great passage.
 
21 min: Josh Rose now fires off a shot, it’s very much City in the ascendancy 
in front of their own fans. Now it’s Kilkenny and Kamau exchanging tight 
passes, but the former Birmingham City man fails to pull the trigger. Not known 
for his goals, Kilkenny, but he plays such a crucial role in the heart of the 
City midfield.
 
19 min: Lovely interchange between Brattan and Kamau – gee, he’s been 
prominent the Kenyan-born winger. Great quick feet as he tries to skip round 
Garuccio, and after a pinballing moment, gets away a shot, but it’s scuffed and 
Galekovic isn’t troubled.
 
17 min: Great skill from Brandan to beat his man Garuccio, but the left back 
recovers to concede a corner. It’s Kamau with the header, amid a crowded pack 
of players, but it drifts to the left of Galekovic’s upright.
 
15 min: Straight into the wall; didn’t look the sharpest that freekick, alas 
for Reds fans.

Now it’s City looking slightly more content to sit back and allow Adelaide the 
ball at the back. Why not? It’s already reaped dividends once.
 
13 min: What can Adelaide muster now? It’s a daunting early task they’ve now 
been set; and it’s a stern-looking Amor scowling and prowling on the touch line.

Kamau fired the warning shot, and then banging-Bruno – gee, doesn’t he like 
hitting them at AAMI Stadium – went even better.

Meanwhile Malik goes in heavily on Guardiola. Garuccio’s left foot appears to 
fancy this one from just to the side of the box.
 
11 min: Oh dear. The Reds look to play out from the back, but it’s Elrich 
who’s trapped in possession. Great pressing from Brandan, I believe, and then 
Kamau – it falls to City’s captain just outside the box and he fires a great 
curling effort.

Galekovic, no chance – lovely strike!
 
10 min: Wow. Well, we said Ange was here to watch Brattan but he wouldn’t mind 
the early sightings of Kamau.

The young winger finds himself with a touch of space, jinks inside one 
defender before firing off an improbable 30m rocket – Galekovic looks to have 
it covered but it still flicks the top of the crossbar; great driven shot 
there; and inch-perfect confidence from the veteran ‘keeper in leaving it.
 
8 min: Bouzanis launches a quick counter looking for Kamau, but it’s just two 
long and goes into touch. Reds players remonstrating in backplay for a 
perceived late challenge from Brattan on La Rocca.
 
6 min: City probe down Adelaide’s right but Elrich does well to intercept. 
Well won back by O’Doherty and a sumptuous ball from Isaias finds Garuccio out 
wide. He swings in a lovely cross and it’s Mells who gets a shot away – 
deflected behind for a corner.

Nice passage, Adelaide.
 
4 min: Guardiola pinged for offside, the Spaniard starting his run just too 
early.

A close up of Ange Postecoglou in the stands – most likely having a good look 
at Luke Brattan who he’s named in his extended squad of 30 for the Socceroos 
next World Cup fixture against Thailand.
 
2 min: First early look for City, Brandan does well out wide and just for half 
a second it looks like Brattan has space on the edge of the box – but he 
dallies before trying an ambitious lofted chip that sails harmlessly over.
 
1 min: And we’re under way! Adelaide in trademark red, City in white with 
light blue trim. City with early possession, just caressing round the back, and 
not being pressed too heavily.
 
Chris Beath is our man with the whistle tonight so all your Shaun Evans haters 
can go back to burning ants with magnifying glasses.

There shouldn’t be excessive feeling between these two – Victory and Adelaide 
might have had their set-tos in the past, but that original SA v Vic rivalry 
hasn’t necessarily translated to these two clubs. That said, they do have a 
decent record of poaching each other’s players, so watch this space.

The players are in the tunnel, and so’s Yoshi – we’re just a few moments away.
 
A stack of changes for both teams therefore – for City: Thomas Sorensen 
remains on the bench with Dean Bouzanis preferred to the veteran Premier League 
shot-stopper.

Connor Chapman comes in for fellow Dane Michael Jakobsen who along with Tim 
Cahill is rested after their midweek FFA Cup heroics.

It looks like van ‘t Schip might shift back to a 4-3-3 tonight, with Osama 
Malik coming in against his old club, and Bruce Kamau also returning from 
concussion to possibly haunt his former employees.

No Henrique or James Holland for the Reds, youngster Jordan O’Doherty flies 
into the starting XI – what a big moment for the teenage forward, with George 
Mells also coming in.

Still a pretty experienced defence for the Reds, but it’s an extremely young 
looking bench. Watch for Marc Marino – released by City in May to look for 
minutes against his old teammates.
 
Our respective sets of players are just warming up – kickoff not too far away. 
Some team news therefore:

Evening all, Rich Parkin in the chair, as advertised on the can. Looking 
forward to a decent ol’ battle between these two – the reigning champions and 
the pretenders to the crown.

As always, we love to hear from you, the people – are you following this 
coverage from anywhere especially intriguing? (Can you get internet reception 
whilst scuba diving? I’ve never tried). What do you make of Sophie’s  Yoshi’ 
choice?

Gutted; supportive; largely unmoved? #UGottaHaveAHashtag

Shoot me a tweet @rrjparkin or via email richard.parkin.casual@theguardian.com 
to join the coverage – as always it’s a better ride with you along.
 
It’s not been the ideal start to their title defence for the champions (and 
premiers) – they’ve gone within one minute of remaining unbeaten twice in a row 
– and after 90th minute slip ups against Victory and Wanderers you’d imagine 
Guillermo Amor will be dreading added time with the likes of Bruno Fornaroli 
circling.

Melbourne City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/melbourne-city> suffered 
their own late slip up last week, as a rampaging Andy Keogh upset the early 
form favourites, with his 85th minute hat-trick.

They’ll be boosted by the key announcement midweek – FFA media campaign 
poster-child Yoshi was urged #gottahaveateam, and he duly announced he’s found 
one: Melbourne City

It was a decision reportedly largely driven by the presence of Tim Cahill; but 
if the youngster has made the long trek from his home city, Sydney, to support 
his new side then he’s in for bad news; Timmy hasn’t made the squad this 
weekend after a midweek knock sustained in that bruising FFA Cup semi-final 
against rivals Melbourne Victory.

Adelaide themselves are having a horror run of injuries – after Jack Clisby’s 
crude challenge put Cirio on the sidelines for a few months now the news that 
there’s no James Holland or Henrique around tonight, let alone Marcelo Carrusca 
who remains on the sideline with a foot injury.

A tough proposition for the Reds therefore, but if anyone remembers their 
turnaround after round 8 last season, you’d be a brave person to write them off 
completely.

An intriguing match up therefore tonight, Adelaide haven’t lost on the road in 
their last eleven matches. Can a fatigued City delight their home fans, or can 
the Reds carry out a smash-and-grab mission of their own? Find out shortly.
 
Richard will be here shortly. In the meantime, in case you missed it, here’s 
David Squires’ review of last weekend’s action, including Kevin Muscat as Tom 
Cruise, Kenny Lowe in a corporate hospitality box andthat Aaron Mooy banner.
