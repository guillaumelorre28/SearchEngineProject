Standing 3,000km from Antarctica, Bruny might as well be the end of the earth. 
The small island, situated at the southern point of Tasmania, is a secluded 
escape for Australian holiday goers and, increasingly, foreign tourists seeking 
breathtaking walks in the wilderness coupled with exquisite local produce. We 
travelled with theBruny Island Long Weekend 
<https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brunyislandlongweekend.com.au%2F&ei=rRAQU7-jIIfIlAWZl4G4Cw&usg=AFQjCNGCFkjFm1ilCQsBdS8qXxZC97DGRw&sig2=hIxC27gwa147pPmaFywZGw&bvm=bv.61965928,d.dGI>
, a guided tour with a focus on nature and food – but you could also create 
your own itinerary. Just make sure to bring sunscreen, good hiking boots and 
your appetite.

 The Avalon City Retreat in Hobart. Photograph: Jessica Reed for the Guardian 
If you're travelling to Tasmania before heading out to Bruny, an overnight 
stop in Hobart makes a great start to the trip. We stopped atAvalon City Retreat
 <http://www.avalonretreats.com.au/city/index.html>, a splendid top-floor pad 
in the heart of Hobart with views of the harbour. (At $680 a night, it's 
expensive – but if you're travelling with friends or family, the flat sleeps 
four in two bedrooms.) Of course, it’s all about the details: a basket of 
Tasmanian produce – bread,bush pepperberry 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmannia_lanceolata> mustard, leatherwood honey, 
biscotti, sparkling wine and more – awaits us, the spacious apartment is 
tastefully decorated with local and European art, and there's a choice of three 
different types of pillows. Outside, a large pine bath allows visitors to 
simmer under the stars on the terrace.

Photograph: Jessica Reed for the Guardian 
Garagistes <http://www.garagistes.com.au/>, a fusion restaurant in downtown 
Hobart serving a five-course set menu ($90 a head), is built in an old garage. 
The resulting atmosphere is subdued and tastefully lit; an open-plan kitchen 
allows you to watch the chefs prepare your meal as you sip sake or wine at your 
table. The extensive, carefully curated wine list provides a paragraph for each 
offering describing theterroir and aims of the producers – we opt for Gamay 
Sans Tra La La 
<http://www.livingwines.com.au/wines/Domaine_de_la_Garreliere.htm>, an organic 
red from the Loire valley.

The menu can appear intricate 
<http://www.garagistes.com.au/documents/GaragistesSampleMenu2014.pdf>, if not 
intimidating– dishes include verbena-curedstriped trumpeter

 suckling pig with pickled nectarine, kohlrabi and lovage. But this pompousness 
is easily forgotten after the first bite: this is perfectly, painfully crafted 
food made to impress.

 Morning at camp. Photograph: Jessica Reed for the Guardian 
Our Bruny Island adventure <http://www.brunyislandlongweekend.com.au/> begins 
the next morning. Bleary eyed, we meet our local expert guides Rob Knight and 
Alex Hern at the harbour and jump on a catamaran for an hour and a half scenic 
journey to Bruny. With clement weather, one of the most legendary and dangerous 
surfing spots in the world,Shipstern Bluff 
<http://tastrails.com/shipstern-bluff/>, is visible from the boat.

A solar-powered campsite in the middle of Bruny’s former logging forest (the 
industry hasn’t been active since 2011) is our home for the next two nights. 
Our tent is a luxurious affair with comfortable king bed and duvet, and 
hotwater bottle provided – sore backs in the morning are ruled out right away. 
The best feature is an outdoor sheltered shower proudly planted on a hill 
overlooking centenarian trees. One certainty: there are few finer things in a 
life than a hot, steaming shower in the great outdoors.

At night, guests (currently limited to eight) gather in the bothy, a small 
cabin serving as a kitchen and dining room, heated with firewood. But more on 
that later ...

Long, scenic afternoon walks

The weekend revolves around two long hikes of about five hours each. For the 
first of these, our guides usher us along a less-walked trail bordering the 
coastline. It’s a little under 13km and we get to do a little climbing as we 
admire geological rock formations and fossils scattered along the way. We are 
taught about bush plants (some of which we munch on) and native fauna. Tasmania 
is host to an incredible range of endemic birds and we are lucky enough to spot
green rosellas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Rosella>, fan-tailed cuckoos 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-tailed_Cuckoo>, pied oystercatchers 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Oystercatcher> and the rare and endangered 
40-spotted pardalote <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-spotted_Pardalote>. 
Wildlife lovers will not be disappointed: along the way we also watchwhite 
wallabies 
<http://www.brunyisland.org.au/files/1713/5595/9744/White-Wallaby-280.jpg> and 
echidnas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna>. 

Our second long hike takes us surely but slowly up the cliffs bordering Cloudy 
Bay until a magnificent view is fully revealed. We learn about Tasmania’s 
Aboriginal heritage and the grimhistory of colonisation 
<http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/european-discovery-and-colonisation>
 that followed, coupled with stories about early European explorers – from 
David Collins to La Pérouse and Dumont d’Urville – and their dangerous feats. 
There is something quite magical about learning the history of a place while 
standing on a cliff top; I picture magnificent ships precariously anchoring 
near land; the first apple tree planted by Captain William Bligh; and the 
apparently amicable meetings betweenAntoine Bruni D’entrecasteaux and 
Aboriginal people 
<http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/discovery/display/70314-admiral-bruni-d%60entrecasteaux>
 across the Bruny channel. (As opposed to contact with the British, which was 
atrociously violent.)

The weather is volatile and the wind ferocious, so when you're told to bring 
sunscreen and a Gore-Tex jacket, be sure to do so.

The best walk, however, probably is the Mavista nature walk 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQuCuTMvFQ>, a short trek through Bruny’s 
rainforest. In the morning, as you follow a stream of clear running water and 
the sun gently filters throughtowering sassafras 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherospermataceae>, eucalyptus and myrtle trees, 
it is hard not to be awed by the ecological diversity of this small island.

Local produce: a fantastic feast
 Wallaby and striped trumpeter. Photograph: Bruny Island Long Weekend 
For an island with around just 600 inhabitants, Bruny's local produce is 
simply mind-blowing. Almost 100% of food we consume over the weekend has been 
sourced by our guides from the island itself or within Tasmania. We are plied 
withlocal oysters <http://www.getshucked.com.au/> (some of which we pick and 
shuck ourselves), wine (there's a trip to the cellar door atBruny Island 
Premium Wines <http://www.brunyislandwine.com/> for a tasting) and succulent 
smoked pulled pork <http://www.brunyislandfood.com.au/> from pigs raised by 
producer Ross O’Meara a few minutes away from our camp.

And despite our guides’ protestations that they are “not really cooks”, the 
food is delicious. There are three courses for dinner each night, which include 
homemade flat bread, roasted vegetables with quinoa and yoghurt dressing, a 
surprisingly delicious wallaby carpaccio, panna cotta with ruby-red 
raspberries, and platters of local cheese by theBruny Island Cheese Company 
<http://www.brunyislandcheese.com.au/>. I haven’t eaten so well in months.

 Up in the air: a seaplane journey from Bruny Island back to Hobart. 
Photograph: Jessica Reed for Guardian Australia 
On our final day, we embark at the aptly named Adventure Bay for a two-hour 
tour of the southern tip of the island. From the boat we spy geological 
formations, peer at the second highest dolomite cliffs in the southern 
hemisphere and gape at the colony of fat, smelly seals lounging on the rocks. 
Dolphins jump alongside our boat for long minutes, to the delight of everyone.

Saving the best for last, the journey back to Hobart is made by ... seaplane. 
The 15-minute journey is magical: landing in the harbour in front of tourists, 
it’s hard not to feel like a rock star (or at the very least likeMacGyver 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver>).

Practicalities

Getting there and around 

Hobart is a one-hour flight from Melbourne or a two-hour flight from Sydney. 
The Bruny Island ferry terminal is 40 minutes from Hobart and the journey lasts 
15 minutes. A seaplane journey will take 15 minutes.

When to visit and what to bring

No doubt about it: summer and early autumn are the best times to embark on 
this tour. There's frequent rain and the weather can change abruptly, so bring 
a windproof and rainproof jacket, warm socks, a swimming costume and powerful 
sunscreen.
