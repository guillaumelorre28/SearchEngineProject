The 23-year-old, who scored 11 goals in 22 league appearances for the 
Eredivisie club last season, has agreed on a four-year contract at Vicarage 
Road in a deal understood to be worth around £4.6m.

“I’m very excited to be here,” Berghuis told the club’s website. “There were 
long discussions about whether I would come and I’m looking forward to playing 
here.

“I was happy at my old club but if you want to make steps in your career you 
have to take other steps and prove yourself again. This club wants to play 
football and I am a footballing player. I like it.

“[The Premier League] is the biggest competition with a lot of good teams. The 
teams are almost all good, instead of just two or three, and you have to prove 
yourself every week.Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> have 
a good vision and I know they want to stay in the Premier League.”

Berghuis becomes Watford’s 10th summer signing for the new Premier League 
season. José Manuel Jurado, Miguel Britos, Sebastian Prödl, Giedrius Arlauskis,
