Guardian photographer Tom Jenkins has won the Barclays Shot of the Season 
award for 2011 - 2012.

The photograph shows an unimpressed Swansea City mascot being left out of a 
pre-match huddle ahead of Swansea's match against Arsenal in September 2011.

Jenkins said the award was an honour, "especially for an image that captures 
the quirky and fun side of football. I've worked hard over the years to capture 
iconic moments, so it's great that this has been recognised by the judges."

The judging panel included the Sky commentator Martin Tyler, Andy Dunn, 
chairman of the Football Writers' Association, last year's winner Martin 
Rickett and chief sports photographer from The Times, Marc Aspland.
