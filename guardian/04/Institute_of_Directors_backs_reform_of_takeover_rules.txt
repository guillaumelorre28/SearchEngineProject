Takeover rules should be toughened up, according to the Institute of Directors 
(IoD), which also warned that many takeovers can be destructive rather than 
enhancing the value of the company.

While Miles Templeman, director general of the IoD, argued against the Liberal 
Democrats' plans to give governments power to block takeovers

 on public interest grounds, he supported proposals by the government that 
would require companies to receive more support from their shareholders than 
they currently do when being taken over.

The hostile takeover of Cadbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/09/roger-carr-takeover-rules> by 
Kraft has prompted the debate about takeover rules after the government found 
itself powerless to protect the confectioner from its US rival. The takeover of 
the transport companyArriva by Germany's Deutsche Bahn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/apr/22/arriva-deutsche-bahn-takeover>
 has now reignited the issue, although, unlike the Cadbury board, the directors 
of Arriva have backed the Â£1.5bn deal.

The IoD is largely concerned about hostile takeovers, which can take place 
provided the company being taken over can secure a simple majority vote from 
shareholders. The government wants this to be changed to two-thirds of 
shareholders, while the IoD is calling for the companies conducting the bid to 
be subjected to the same rules.

Templeman said: "It is important to ensure that as many shareholders as 
possible are fully supportive of takeovers."

But, he said that governments should only be able to block takeovers "where 
there are competition concerns or in cases of national security".

The IoD is dubious about the government's proposals to be able to block 
takeovers of infrastructure and utility companies.
