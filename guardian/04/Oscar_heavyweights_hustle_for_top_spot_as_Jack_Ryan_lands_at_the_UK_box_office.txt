The £11m Oscars club

In the battle for UK audiences, it's honours even between best picture Oscar 
nomineesThe Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155767/wolf-of-wall-street>, American 
Hustle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156243/american-hustle> and 12 
Years a Slave <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156376/12-years-a-slave>, 
which have all achieved totals so far between £10.9m and £11.2m (see chart 
below). Respective distributors Universal, Entertainment Films and eOne all 
have reason to be proud of the results.

The previous best result for a team-up between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo 
DiCaprio – or any Scorsese film at all, for that matter – wasThe Departed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/114997/departed>, which reached £12.86m 
over its lifetime. The Wolf of Wall Street will easily cruise past that tally 
this week. With £10.9m after just 10 days, it's conceivable that the film could 
overtakeHannibal <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86940/hannibal> 
(£21.6m) to become the biggest ever 18-certificate hit at the UK box office. 
Other notable 18-cert titles includeAmerican Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81856/american.beauty> (£21.3m) and 
Seven (£19.5m).

As for American Hustle, David O Russell's previous best was Three Kings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82593/three.kings> with just under £7m, 
followed byThe Fighter  <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140166/fighter>
(£6.3m) andSilver Linings Playbook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148764/silver-linings-playbook> 
(£5.3m). The new picture is already at £11.2m, and a sum in the mid-teens 
millions looks likely.

Perhaps most remarkable of all is the UK performance of 12 Years a Slave. The 
film is lagging far behind the Scorsese and Russell films in the US, having 
grossed $43.6m (£26.3m) there, as against $98.6m for Wolf and $127m for Hustle. 
Fox Searchlight is pushing Slave back into US cinemas, and grosses went up 32% 
at the weekend, but it has a long way to catch up. So far, the positioning 
there has been relatively niche for a sobering historical drama from auteur
Steve McQueen <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen>. Whereas here 
in the UK, an aggressive campaign by eOne has seen the film expand to a broad 
481 cinemas, achieving £11.0m so far, dead level with both Wolf and Hustle. 
Again, mid-teens millions looks a slam-dunk, and probably more. If it wins the 
best picture Oscar on 2 March, the number goes higher.

Last year, two wildly commercial best picture nominees, Les Miserables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150107/miserables> and Life of Pi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149778/life-of-pi>, delivered a 
combined £70m at the UK box office. This year's nominees seemed creatively very 
strong, but commercially weaker. However, withGravity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156058/gravity> closing in on £30m, the 
2014 best picture contenders look set to match the box office of the 2013 crop, 
at least in the UK. Other highlights includeCaptain Phillips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154515/captain-phillips> with £15.9m and
Philomena <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156219/philomena> on £10.9m. 
Fellow nomineesDallas Buyers Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156634/dallas-buyers-club> and Her 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156796/her> have yet to release.

The marathon runner 

Dropping a slim 4% from the previous weekend, Frozen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155770/frozen> has now achieved an 
amazing eighth consecutive weekend at £1m-plus. Not evenSkyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144416/skyfall> managed that, since its 
eighth-weekend takings were £809,000. Among other box-office monsters, the 
front-loadedHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141606/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows>
 only managed five weekends at £1m-plus, andThe Dark Knight Rises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises> achieved six. 
The last film to pull off the feat was the slow-burnThe King's Speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech> , back in 
January-February 2011. Others that managed it areMamma Mia! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125168> and Avatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131170/avatar>.

Frozen has so far reached £35.6m, and is set to receive a further boost from a 
singalong version being released into UK cinemas to coincide with the February 
half-term school holiday. Disney long ago billed Frozen as its biggest UK hit 
from Walt Disney Animation Studios (NB Pixar is separate), having quickly 
overtaken The Lion King's 2D tally of £23.14m. However, now it has genuinely 
earned this accolade, having passed the combined £35.5m earned by The Lion King 
from its various 2D and 3D releases.

The new arrivals

Twelve years after The Sum of All Fears 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92688/sum.of.all.fears>, franchise 
rebootJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156244/jack-ryan>, lands in the UK with 
an OK £1.28m. That's up on the £1.14m debut of Sum, but down in number of 
admissions when you consider ticket price inflation since 2002. IMDBPro lists 
the worldwide gross as $77m to date, and the film has a fair way to go before a 
further sequel becomes an attractive business decision, given hefty marketing 
costs.

With Oscar nominees Wolf, Hustle and Slave continuing to dominate the UK 
market, distributor StudioCanal would be forgiven if it experienced a nervous 
moment as it unleashedInside Llewyn Davis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154516/inside-llewyn-davis> into UK 
cinemas. One of the most competitive awards seasons in living memory saw the 
critically loved film pick up Oscar nods just for cinematography and sound 
mixing, hardly categories that could be exploited in marketing messaging.

However, the Coen brothers evidently didn't need validation from the US 
Academy to connect with UK audiences, and the film opened with a decent 
£758,000 from 206 cinemas, yielding a strong £3,679 average.

Blessed with slightly more useful Oscar love nominations for actress (Meryl 
Streep) and supporting actress (Julia Roberts)August: Osage County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156238/august> nevertheless proved a 
somewhat tougher sell. Released on a more aggressive 302 screens, a £537,000 
gross and £1,779 average resulted. The critical response was more muted for 
Osage,including the Guardian's own verdict 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/23/august-osage-county-review>. 
Streep and Roberts are not favourites to win their categories, so sustaining 
the film may prove a challenge, with further strong titles coming into cinemas. 
On the other hand, given an older audience skew, it could thrive on weekdays 
and especially matinees, so the battle is far from over.

Grudge Match <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/159119/grudge-match>, 
starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro, was a predictable flop, landing 
in 14th place with £266,000 and an £828 average. Given the strong choices 
currently for cinema bookers, it's hard to envisage the film sticking around.

The future 

With top new arrival Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit delivering just £1.3m, the box 
office overall proved a disappointing 18% down on the previous frame and 12% 
down on the equivalent weekend from 2013, whenLincoln 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149491/lincoln> and Zero Dark Thirty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149492/zero-dark-thirty> were the top 
new releases. The coming weekend sees the arrival ofLone Survivor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/159112/lone-survivor>, which opened in 
the US earlier this month with a whopping $39.9m presumably boosted by a 
patriotic fervour that may not be matched in foreign territories. The market 
has a gap for a relationship comedy, and that lack will be supplied on 
Wednesday by That Awkward Moment, with a cast topped by Zac Efron. Also 
arriving Wednesday is I, Frankenstein, starring Aaron Eckhart,already a notable 
US flop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/27/i-frankenstein-us-box-office-aaron-eckhart>
.Out of the Furnace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/159051/out-of-the-furnace> is another 
awards contender barely blessed with actual nominations, but a cast including 
Christian Bale (who is nominated, albeit for American Hustle) and Casey Affleck 
may help punch it through.
