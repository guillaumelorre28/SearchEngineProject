As Iran prepares for elections on 26 February for parliament and the Assembly 
of Experts, the body that chooses Iran’s supreme leader, the name of Akbar 
Hashemi Rafsanjani crops up frequently in media and political discussions. 
Iran’s former president, whose political presence faded during the presidencies 
of Mohammad Khatami andMahmoud Ahmadinejad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad>, is once again on the 
rise.


At 81, Rafsanjani is embroiled again in a new political battle. Over the past 
few years he has gained popularity among ‘moderates’, a term that has become 
popular since Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 and which includes 
some figures previously seen as reformists and others as ‘principle-ists’. He 
is already one of the Assembly’s 78members 
<http://www.majlesekhobregan.ir/fa/majlesmemberlist.html?categoryitemid=1006&pn_168=1>
. This week he was cleared to run again.

Saeed Abutaleb, a former principle-ist parliamentary deputy, predicts 
Rafsanjani is going to have a big win in the Assembly of Experts. “I think not 
only that Rafsanjani and his allies will be successful in the election, but 
it’s even possible that Rafsanjani becomes the chairman of the assembly,” he 
told Tehran Bureau.


The next chairman will have a “very significant” role, said Abutaleb, given 
the assembly may in its next eight-year term choose a successor toAyatollah Ali 
Khamenei <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei>, Iran’s 
supreme leader, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery.

And things do not end there for Rafsanjani. His supporters have also geared up 
for the parliamentary elections, for which significant numbers of moderates 
leaning toward Rafsanjani have stepped forward.


The Guardian Council, which vets candidates for elections, has failed to 
qualify 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/19/iran-guardian-council-blocks-reformists-february-parliamentary-poll>
 most of these candidates. But despite all the hurdles, the new ‘moderate’ 
faction still has the upper hand in the parliamentary elections, said Sadegh 
Zibakalam, professor of political science at Tehran University, given they have 
enough candidates qualified to win more seats than the nearly 30 they hold out 
of 288, which is about 10%.


The Guardian Council is reviewing the mass disqualifications and may reverse 
itself in some cases.


“Rafsanjani and the moderates benefitted a lot from all the developments since 
the establishment of the new government [in 2013], especially the nuclear deal 
and consequently the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” 
he told Tehran Bureau. “So their chances are quite high for the election.”


Any successes would leave them well short of a majority, said Abutaleb: “The 
next parliament is not going to be dominated by moderates and Rafsanjani’s 
allies, but I believe their presence would be more significant than the current 
parliament.”

These days Rafsanjani is far more popular with the public than during the 
presidencies of Khatami and Ahmadinejad, when he was under constant attack by 
the government. The roots of this unpopularity lay in his time as president 
from 1989 to 1997.

Prior to becoming president, Rafsanjani also played a key role in Khamenei’s 
ascent to supreme leader. In 1989 when Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the 
Islamic Republic and its leader, died without designating a replacement, 
Rafsanjani, then a powerful parliamentary speaker, argued that Khomeini had been
in favor of Khamenei’s candidacy 
<http://aftabnews.ir/fa/news/269216/%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D8%AA%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C>
. Khamenei was elected as the new supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts in 
June 1989 and two months later, Rafsanjani took over as the next president.

turban), Ayatollah Khomeini’s representative to the armed forces, and prime 
minister Mohammad Ali Rajai, who was briefly president before he was 
assassinated in August 1980. 
Rafsanjani’s focus was on reviving the country’s war-torn economy through 
economic liberalisation. Arguably, he was successful asaverage annual GDP 
growth was 5.3% 
<https://www.google.com.tr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&idim=country:irn:syr:isr&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:IRN&ifdim=region&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false>
 during his presidency, far higher than the 1.6% average growth under his 
predecessor Ali Khamenei (1981-1989).


But the Rafsanjani era brought 
<http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/287381/politics/government> little in the 
way of political reform or openness. His presidency was a time when dissidents 
were assassinated in the so-called “chain murders 
<http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/01/the-chain-murders-killing-dissidents-and-intellectuals-1988-1998.html>
” and when theuniversities 
<http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13921218000584> were subjected to 
tight control.

As Rafsanjani’s first term ended in 1993, discontent with his performance, as 
well as a challenge from three other candidates, saw the 94% of votes he gained 
in the 1989 election against just one challengerdrop to 63% 
<http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8802260290>. 

During the mid-90s, as talk of reform and change emerged and gained momentum, 
Rafsanjani appeared cautious. When Khatami swept to office in 1997, the 
Rafsanjani presidency was seen by reformists as “patriarchal” and financially 
corrupt. The exposure of the state’s role in the “chain murders” by journalist 
Akbar Ganji further tainted Rafsanjani among reformists.

When he stood in Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election, Rafsanjani barely 
made it and later resigned. The reformists held a majority in the parliament, 
while Rafsanjani’s party,Kargozaran 
<https://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/parties/kargozaran/kargozaranpdf.pdf>
, formed in 1996 largely on a platform of economic development, won around 40 
seats.

When Rafsanjani ran in the 2005 presidential election, he lost a run-off 
ballot to the then mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who attacked him, if 
not by name, as corrupt. Charges of corruption against him and his family 
ranged from bribery to accumulating illicit wealth through the oil trade, and 
these continued when Ahmadinejad was president. A leading figure since the 1979 
Revolution, Rafsanjani went into political isolation.

But 2009 marked a turning point in Rafsanjani’s long career. As protests over 
the presidential election results erupted, Rafsanjani earned the protesters’ 
attention by criticising Ahmadinejad’s government. On 17 July, 2009, during his 
Friday sermon in Tehran,Rafsanjani attacked the authorities 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antfmkpbak8> for mishandling the protests and 
called for the release of jailed protesters.

That marked his last appearance <http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/55964> as 
Friday prayer speaker, and attacks intensified against Rafsanjani and his 
family, including daughterFaezeh <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pblpfthf4y> 
and sonMohsen <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85h1ift2zla>. Another son, 
Mehdi, wasbriefly detained

Over the years following the 2009 unrest, Rafsanjani’s political presence was 
less visible. In March 2011 hestepped down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/08/iran-president-rafsanjani-assembly>
 as the chair of the Assembly of Experts. In 2013, hewas disqualified 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/21/iran-presidential-election-rafsanjani-disqualified>
 from running in the presidential election ostensibly on grounds of age.

But since Rouhani took office in August 2013, Rafsanjani has once again 
publicly engaged in politics while making clear he has revised many of his 
views. “Looking at Rafsanjani’s political stands and comments over the past few 
years, we see that his opinions have changed and become more moderate,” said 
Abutaleb. “Now he is supported not only by reformist intellectuals, but also 
some of the moderate principle-ists.”

Where Rafsanjani once wanted dissident students expelled  
<http://taghato.net/article/13817> from universities, he now calls for more 
openness

 in academia. While he once rejected talk of“reconciliation with the USA” 
<http://www.farsnews.com/13921110000170>, by 2012 he expressed support 
<http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13910115000406> for negotiations with 
Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme, and he now insistsIran

 not interfere unduly in the way people dressed.

But Rafsanjani is not the only politician who has changed. The reformists have 
too, said Zibakalam. “Many of his radical opponents among the reformists and 
traditional leftists have realised that their strategy of destroying 
Rafsanjani’s reputation was a big mistake,” he explained.


“So since the Ahmadinejad era, the reformists have got closer to him. Now an 
unwritten coalition has formed between the reformists and Rafsanjani. And even 
a wide range of moderate reformists have accepted his leadership.”
