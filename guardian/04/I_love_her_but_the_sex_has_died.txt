From an anonymous male, aged 40+
I have been in several very loving, amorous, "serious" relationships as an 
adult, none frivolous and none (at least on a conscious level – who the hell 
knows what's going on with me subconsiously) with the intention of being 
short-term.

Inevitably, however, my sexual attraction for my partner wanes to the point 
where we become virtually non-sexual. This can happen in less that a year after 
the relationship started. This condition consistently contributes to the 
relationship falling apart. My emotional feeling of love stays constant, and 
the breakup is traumatic for both of us. Add to the mix my undeniable enjoyment 
of and never-failing satisfaction with masturbation, and it seems to be a 
recipe for disaster. Is there an evolutionary take on any of this?

Trying to sustain a long-term relationship that is also sexual presents humans 
with a chemical catch-22.

Studies on the length of relationships have shown that couples in harmonious, 
stable and trusting long-term relationships have higher blood levels of 
oxytocin (a chemical that regulates attachment, promotes cooperation and 
facilitates sensations of joy and love) than people who are not in compatible 
relationships.1

 These happy couples also reap other benefits in terms of longer lifespan, 
lower rates of alcoholism, depression and illness, and more rapid recovery 
after accidental injury.2

But there are conflicting chemicals at work in sexual relationships that 
sometimes prevent them from ever becoming long-term.Dopamine 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine> is a neurotransmitter in the limbic 
system <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system> – the brain's primitive 
reward centre. It mediates both the sex drive and addiction to drugs. Brain 
scans have shown that the rapid rise in dopamine levels during orgasm is 
similar to that seen in a heroin high.5 
<http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/23/27/9185> But dopamine falls 
rapidly following orgasm in both males and females and is replaced with rising 
levels of a hormone calledprolactin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin>.

Both are part of the brain's "dopaminergic" reward system.

At first, rising prolactin causes sleepy post-orgasm contentment. 
(Interestingly the amount of prolactin produced is far greater after sex with a 
partner than after masturbation. Thus there is little prolactin relief for 
those who masturbate.) But once this sleepy feeling of satiation has passed, 
prolactin may go on rising and cause problems for couples wanting to sustain a 
long-term sexual relationship. In both men and women excess levels of prolactin 
can cause loss of libido, anxiety, headaches, mood swings and depression.6 
<http://www.reuniting.info/science/prolactin_hormonal_politics_jeremy_heaton>

High prolactin is associated with sensations of despair. When the prolactin 
levels of newly caged wild monkeys were monitored, the hormone was seen to rise 
once the animals realised they were trapped.7 
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15193069> Levels of the hormone were much 
higher in monkeys incarcerated for months compared with wild animals that had 
only just been caged. Science has yet to determine how long prolactin continues 
to rise and remain high in humans after orgasm, so this is speculative, but in 
a relationship with lots of sex it could mean levels are elevated for weeks or 
even months.

How does all this tie in with your predilection for maturbation? There have 
been some illuminating studies of this behaviour in non-human primates. It has 
been found, for example, that male monkeys who masturbate tend to be of low 
status, whereas high-status male monkeys are likely only to experience 
ejaculation during sex.8 <http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7508l6033g17187/>
 It also seems that the frequency of masturbation is higher in captive primates 
than in wild animals. You can make of this what you will.

The dopaminergic system varies among humans, some people exhibiting more 
reward-seeking behaviour than others, and this may go some way towards 
explaining why many relationships are burnt out after a year.9 
<http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n3/full/5201763a.html> In reproductive 
terms, 12 months is long enough for fertilisation to take place. It is also 
certainly long enough for prolactin levels to rise. Once your libido flags and 
anxiety sets in, the short-term reward gained from masturbating may give you a 
dopamine "high" without risking bringing on that post-orgasmic prolactin "low".

Chemical compatibility is essential to all good relationships. Couples lucky 
enough to enjoy long-term partnerships may have similar sex drives (perhaps not 
too much sex, or even none at all?) and dopaminergic systems that don't flood 
their bodies with too much prolactin. Human behaviour seems to be under the 
control of two evolutionary programs: one that results in fertilisation, 
disillusionment and a series of partners, and the other that enables humans to 
develop the lasting relationships that lead to long, happy and healthy lives.
