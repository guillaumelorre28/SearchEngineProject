Rebel Bully Geek Pariah is a story about an extraordinary night where four 
teenagers, who are initially strangers to one another, are brought together due 
to an unfortunate event. This book is actually in flashback form and is 
narrated by one of the main characters.


They run away from the police for all the wrong reasons which makes them seem 
guilty but did they actually break the law? Four people who never acknowledged 
each otherâ€™s presence; the rebel, the bully, the geek and the pariah, are 
speeding down a highway in a stolen police car. The same police car that was 
used to hit a police man and also contains a trunk full of drugs. Every step 
they take somehow backfires and they end up getting into worse and worse 
situations.

Since the story starts at the end with Sam, the pariah, telling her drug 
addict mum the whole story while being held prisoner. The story is a blend of 
the common high school culture and crime thriller. It is written from the point 
of view of the pariah which makes sense since the rebel, geek and bully can 
still relate to one another but the pariah is an outcast and is always 
different.

This book is an interesting read and I think if you are a fan of books such as 
Perfectionist by Sara Shepherd, this would be a gripping read.

Rating: 4/5
