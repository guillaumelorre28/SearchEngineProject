When were you happiest? 
There was a moment at my wedding in 1997 when I got the bumps from all my male 
friends. We were in the garden and they grabbed me and threw me up and down in 
the air. It was a fantastic moment of complete irreverence. Another incredible 
moment was when my second child, Jasmine, was born and I caught her; I was the 
first person to hold her.

What is your greatest fear? 
Losing the people I love most.

What is your earliest memory?
I have a photograph of it: it’s me outside my grandad’s house in Birmingham, 
dressed in shorts, socks and a tank top, trying to look grown up. In my mind’s 
eye, I am really big and have my good clothes on, but when I look at the photo, 
I’m about three and a half and a tiny kid.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
I am brilliant at not doing paperwork. I could teach a degree in 
procrastination.

Property aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought? 
My wife’s wedding ring. I had it made by a Hatton Garden jeweller.

What is your most treasured possession?
My health.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
Running naked across Trafalgar Square for Hustle. It wasn’t when they shouted 
“Action!”; it was when they shouted “Cut!” and I had to walk back to where I 
had started. That was when I realised I hated the person who invented camera 
phones.

What would your superpower be?
To read minds.

If you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?
Manners.

What is your favourite smell?
Summer rain evaporating on a garden.

Is it better to give or to receive?
Apart from awards, it’s best to give.

What does love feel like?
I can feel myself growing every day. The first time I met Lolita, I was 14, 
but it was only when we got together at Rada that we traced our history back 
and realised we’d met before.

Which words or phrases do you most overuse?
“Brilliant” and “fantastic”.

What has been your biggest disappointment?
That my dad never got to meet my children.

When did you last cry, and why?
On stage last night. In real life, it was at home and one of those moments 
where you are talking to your partner and being honest.

What single thing would improve the quality of your life?
The ability not to have a hangover.

What do you consider your greatest achievement?
Maintaining a marriage in this industry.

What song would you like played at your funeral?
As, by Stevie Wonder <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWhMyOs0pCQ>.

What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
Don’t wait.
