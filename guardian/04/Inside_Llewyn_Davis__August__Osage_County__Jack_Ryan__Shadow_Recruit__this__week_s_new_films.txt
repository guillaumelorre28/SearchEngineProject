Inside Llewyn Davis <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFphYRyH7wc> (15) 
(Joel & Ethan Coen, 2013, US) Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, 
Adam Driver, Garret Hedlund, John Goodman. 105 mins

Bob Dylan hadn't written Like A Rolling Stone when this is set (New York, 
1961), but Isaac's eponymous hero could almost be the inspiration. He's the 
archetypal drifter: a complete unknown with no direction home and little 
prospect of realising his folk-star dream, despite, or perhaps because of, his 
artistic integrity. The Coens let us know exactly how it feels. This is their 
most mature drama to date: subdued, sincere, bleakly funny, and as finely 
crafted as we've come to expect.

August: Osage County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/august-osage-county-always-ended-one-way>
 (15)
(John Wells, 2013, US) Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts. 121 mins

Heavy acting artillery is positioned for a full-on awards assault, with 
Streep's malign matriarch marshalling her fractured family for some mourning 
and bloodletting. Sparks and crockery fly in a predictably theatrical workout.

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqeh-OzqEs> (12A) 
(Kenneth Branagh, 2014, US/Rus) Chris Pine, Kevin Costner, Keira Knightley. 
105 mins

Not ready for another incarnation of Tom Clancy's action hero? Well, tough. 
But this franchise opener at least brings the pulpy spy up to 21st-century 
speed, as Pine's sceptical CIA analyst is thrown into violent opposition with 
Branagh's parody of a Russian oligarch.

Teenage <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2B-Jgupg_o> (12A) 
(Matt Wolf, 2013, US/Ger) Ben Whishaw, Jena Malone, Julia Hummer. 78 mins

An engaging angle on 20th-century history, following the development of the 
modern teenager as a cultural, social and political force. It's a judicious 
collage of archive images and reconstruction with diary-like first-person 
narration, going workhouses to dance crazes to Hitler Youth.

Fonzy (15) 
(Isabelle Doval, 2013, Fra) José Garcia, Audrey Fleurot, Lucien Jean-Baptiste. 
102 mins

After Delivery Man, a French version of Canadian "I was a sperm-donor and now 
I've got 500 kids" comedy Starbuck. How many more are there out there?

Grudge Match <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bQSOBJCPQE> (12A) 
(Peter Segal, 2013, US) Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Kim Basinger. 113 
mins

Dreaming up a bout between Rocky and Jake LaMotta was the easy bit; making it 
vaguely plausible and fitfully amusing requires an excess of sports-movie/old 
guy-movie cliches.

The General <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXAKkp-iE9M> (U) 
(Clyde Bruckman, Buster Keaton, 1926, US) Buster Keaton, Marion Mack

Nearly a century later, Keaton's action comedy is an exhilarating ride. 
Reckless momentum gathers as his stone-faced hero homes in on his beloved 
locomotive, risking life and limb without a safety net.

Dark Days <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPR5N0wZVYM> (15) 
(Marc Singer, 2000, US) 80 mins

Astounding journey into New York's subterranean underworld, to discover a 
functioning community of outcasts – a flipside to Manhattan affluence.

Jai Ho <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7xFJVWbMlQ> (NC) 
(Sohail Khan, 2014, Ind) Salman Khan, Tabu, Sana Khan. 150 mins

Khan socks it to the corrupt baddies in this amped-up tale of local heroism.
