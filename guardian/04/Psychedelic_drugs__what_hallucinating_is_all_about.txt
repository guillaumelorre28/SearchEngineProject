What’s so great about Glastonbury? As I’ve never been, I often wonder. Clearly 
the music and suspension of social norms that makes rolling in the mud seem 
like a good idea can encourage a new mindset.Some of the 175,000-strong crowd 
famously reach this altered state through psychoactive substances. However, the 
change to neural activity caused by psychedelic drugs isn’t as significant as 
you might think.

Whatever a stoned hippy might tell you in a field at 3am, hallucination isn’t 
an entirely different way of seeing - it’s just a different balance between 
what you’re imagining and what’s going into your eyes. Even when you’re sober, 
what you see is driven by expectations and prejudices, what you’ve seen in the 
past and what you’re thinking about at that moment. We constantly see shapes 
that look like objects and things that aren’t really there – but you are more 
likely to do a double-take and look more closely at whatever is in front of you 
if you’re not high. Hallucinogens can pause this inner fact-checking mechanism 
and cause us to project our memories and musings out into the real world – 
hence the purple clouds and talking teacups.
