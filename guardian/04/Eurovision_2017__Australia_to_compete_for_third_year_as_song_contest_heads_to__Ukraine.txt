The relationship between Eurovision and Australia has grown in recent years. 
In 2014, at the interval of the second semi-final, Australian singer Jessica 
Mauboy became the first non-European solo artist to be invited to perform.

In 2015 the Australian singer Guy Sebastian became the country’s first ever 
contestant, with a wild-card entry that sent him straight through to the 
finals. He came fifth.

In May this year SBS announced it had an exclusive deal with the European 
Broadcasting Union todevelop an Asia Pacific version of the contest

, Eurovision Asia, which would bring together up to 20 competing countries in 
the Asia Pacific region. At the time, they said the inaugural event would be 
hosted by Australia in 2017 but, on Tuesday, could offer no further updates.

“We are still in a development stage of an Asian Eurovision and hope to have 
more to share soon,” a spokesperson said.

Eurovision 2017 will be held in Ukraine and broadcast on SBS in May.
