I’m rooting for Greece. I mean, broadly, who the hell isn’t rooting for 
Greece? Even if you’re super right wing, or super German, or super capitalist 
you probably don’t want Greece tumbling out of the Euro and defaulting on its 
debts.

But beyond that, I like that they’re a young government. I like Yanis 
Varoufakis, the new finance minister. To a certain extent, I’ve bought into the 
media portrayal of him (from the Guardian and NPR and all over) as a straight 
shooting rapscallion who might – just might – be crazy enough to, um, 
responsibly manage the Greek financial situation?

I was reading the Guardian’s live coverage of the forthcoming Greek proposals 
of how they’re going to pay off their debts, when a little blurb popped up 
explaining that the Greek markets were closed today because it was “Clean 
Monday” – the Greek Orthodox equivalent of Ash Wednesday. It was an 
amazing/hilarious (well, maybe mildly amusing) coincidence to me that the Greek 
ministers were scrambling and figuring out how to avoid strict austerity on the 
day that Lent starts.


And all this scrambling is just to figure out the next few months. It’s gonna 
be a long winter, and a long spring, and maybe a really long summer for Greece. 
But my fingers are crossed.
