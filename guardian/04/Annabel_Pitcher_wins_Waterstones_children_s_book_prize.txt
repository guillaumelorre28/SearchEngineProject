A coming-of-age tale about a teenage girl who reveals a dark secret in letters 
to a prisoner on Death Row has won theWaterstones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/waterstones> prize for new and emerging 
talent.

Annabel Pitcher's Ketchup Clouds took the teen category and went on to beat 
the other category winners - a book for pre-teens about a boy with a facial 
deformity and a picture book about a girl who does not want to eat her lunch – 
to the overall prize.

Pitcher burst onto the children's books scene two years ago with My Sister 
Lives on the Mantelpiece, which received 25 awards nominations, including the 
CILIP Carnegie medal, the Red House children's book award and the Guardian 
children's book prize. Ketchup Clouds is a confessional story aimed at an older 
readership and is partly based on her experience as a teenager of writing to a 
prison inmate in America after getting involved in a "penpal" scheme through 
Amnesty International.

"I was keen to explore love and guilt, so I had to come up with a character 
and plot that enabled me to do that,"Pitcher told Guardian children's site 
member Lyd 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/2013/mar/13/annabel-pitcher-interview>
. "After a lot of false starts, I imagined this girl, Zoe, who has killed a boy 
that she is supposed to like, and has completely gotten away with the crime. 
However, she is burdened by terrible guilt and decides to write a letter, 
confessing anonymously to someone who might understand. I came up with various 
recipients for Zoe's letters (the Pope and Santa Claus to name but two!) before 
deciding upon a man on Death Row."

"Pitcher is a genuine literary star." said Melissa Cox, children's new titles 
buyer for Waterstones. "Ketchup Clouds is a classic coming-of-age story 
featuring death, betrayal and redemption. Pitcher's handling of the subject is 
beautifully wrought and peppered with humour, layering the everyday teen 
experience with the extraordinary and traumatic. It's an unsettling yet 
fantastically fresh and brave take on the teen confessional."

The winner of the Best fiction for 5-12s category was a debut novel, Wonder, 
by an American art director, RJ Palacio. The book was described by judge Cox as 
"an unsentimental and ultimately hopeful exploration of the ugly reaction that 
physical disability and difference can provoke in children and adults alike … a 
thought-provoking read with timeless
appeal."

Rebecca Cobb triumphed in the picturebook category with her second solo book 
(she has previously worked with Richard Curtis and Julia Donaldson), Lunchtime, 
about a reluctant eater.

The category winners picked up cheques for £2,000 at the ceremony at 
Waterstones Piccadily, while Pitcher garnered an extra £3,000 for her overall 
win. Last year's winner was Jonny Duddle with The Pirates Next Door. Previous 
winners include Sita Brahmachari, Julia Golding, Sally Nicholls, Michelle 
Harrison and Katie Davies.

To be eligible for the prize, authors must have no more than one previously 
published fiction title or, in the case of author-illustrator partnerships, 
have had no more than four previously published picture books.
