Let the bells ring. War and Peace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/war-and-peace> concludes in triumph. 
5.7m viewers can’t be wrong. The critics agree:the man did it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/08/war-and-peace-watched-by-57m-as-writer-signs-up-for-les-miserables>
. He crammed Tolstoy’s massive quarts into half a dozen pint pots. Genius in a 
box set. Andrew Davies, reportedly, is signing up for Les Misérables. No 
warbling. No subtitles. If it has to beVictor Hugo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/mar/02/artsandhumanities.highereducation>
 I rather wish he’d gone for Toilers of the Sea, just to see how TV handled the 
giant squid (beatsMoby-Dick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick>
 any day of the week).

Davies’s breakthrough was Middlemarch, long ago in 1994. It was a book which 
Victorians like Trollope thought far too difficult for the common reader (among 
whomthe Chronicler of Barsetshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/11/anthonytrollope> counted himself 
– he, too, has been given the Davies kiss of life). Amazingly, Middlemarch shot 
to the top of the 1994 paperback bestseller list. The common reader, it turned 
out, lovedEliot’s Study of Provincial Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/01/fromthearchives.georgeeliot>.

I would guess that a sizeable bulk of those 1994 purchasers “knew” the book 
but hadn’t quite got round to reading it. Life was short, the book was long. 
But, having watched the TV adaptation, time was found. I would guess every 
well-read person has a guilty literary bucket list. Often it’s the highest 
hanging fruit. The very difficult ones. Or, as with Middlemarch, the awkwardly 
long ones (Clarissa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/100-best-books-clarissa-samuel-richardson>
? I’ll just read those chapter summaries Richardson so usefully provided).

TV is the perfect lubricant and abbreviator. You could even argue it enriches; 
giving a visual dimension (and in Davies’s case an erotic dimension) to those 
small black marks on a white surface. Of course the TV adaptation “gives the 
plot away” – but most of the high-hanging stuff isn’t the-butler-did-it kind of 
thing, and no spoiler alert is needed. We know Napoleon isn’t going to win.


The higher up the tree you go, the sweeter grows the berry, says the folk 
song. What fruit is hanging up there, in the top branches, awaiting the 
adaptor’s subtle hand?

 Would fit TV like a glove … Finnegans Wake 
Finnegans Wake is a contender for topmost spot. Of course it’s difficult. So 
what; spend a lifetime on it, Joyce blandly instructed. One has a momentary 
vision of Hibernian madrassas, or yeshivas, neophytes “shokeling” (I think the 
term is) over passages (words?) like:


“bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!”

Everyone knows the first word (riverrun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/14/riverrun-joyce-finnegans-wake-olwen-fouere-national-theatre>
), the fact that it keeps Lynne Truss awake at night because of that missing 
apostrophe in the title … most know nothing else. Paradoxically this most 
difficult of novels would fit TV like a glove.

The richness of Irish literature (per capita they produce great novels like 
Serbs produce tennis champs) is plausibly traced back to the orality of their 
culture. Their mouthiness.Hearing Finnegans Wake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday>
 would be a short-cut to making sense of it.


The novel’s plot is, intrinsically, as simple as Anne Enright’s indirect 
homage, The Gathering 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview17>
. A funeral for Finnegan is followed by a wake in which everyone gets royally 
pissed including (spoiler alert) the corpse.


But language spills out of Finnegans Wake like lava. The Wake calls out for 
audio-visual adaptation. Inside that verbal mass there’s a four-part miniseries 
struggling to get out.

 Great dialogue … Paradise Lost Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images 
It’s the greatest story ever told. Everyone knows it, but I would bet even 
many English graduates have never honestly read Milton’s English epic, line by 
line, from the pre-Edenic battle in heaven to the post-Edenic couple, stumbling 
out into the bleak wilderness that is our world.

What makes Paradise Lost superior to Genesis (a story as full of holes as a 
colander) is that Milton makes wonderful sense of such holy writ nonsense as 
“knowledge” being forbidden fruit.


Forget Paradise Regained. It's feebler than Godfather 3

The poem hinges on that moment when Adam elects to eat the apple. Why? He’s 
got plenty of spare ribs left. But he loves this woman. At that moment, it’s 
world well lost. And after? With that mouthful he dooms himself, and all 
mankind, to life sentences of hard labour and death.


Paradise Lost has wonderful, Miltonic, dialogue – the seduction of Eve by the 
serpent rings in the ear as you read it and you can see the coiling tempter at 
his irresistibly slimy work. TV would solidify those impressions, and stimulate 
us to go back and read. We ought, as a literary nation, to be familiar with the 
greatest poem we have.


Forget Paradise Regained. It’s feebler than Godfather 3.

 Hyper paranoiac … Gravity’s Rainbow 
The academic George Levine – a man of unusually determined intellect – once 
wrote an article describing how he had taken three months off from university 
teaching to read Thomas Pynchon’s magnum opus. And nothing else.


A good TV adaptation, I believe, would save us Levine’s heroic 
self-punishment. Pynchon’s masterpiece opens in 1944 London. I was there. 
Pynchon (born 1937) wasn’t. But his reconstruction of the time and place is 
eerily accurate. It would make wonderfully visual TV.


The two great drivers of Pynchon’s narrative are paranoia and entropy. 
Gravity’s Rainbow is hyper-paranoiac. The paranoid person sees narratives 
everywhere – explaining the horrific randomness of our lives.


Nothing was more random than a V2 dropping on London in 1944. You’d be dead 
before the sound waves reached you. The hero, Tyrone Slothrop, a US Army 
officer works out that wherever he has an erection, a V2 drops. His penis is a 
missile guidance system. Or is he merely paranoid? It gets crazier. There has 
been one attempt to adapt it for TV. Aborted.

 Shrieks for the small screen … Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged 
Rand’s is the most reviled yet influential novel of the post-war period. With 
its book-length supplement on ‘Objectivism’ (ie screw your neighbour as he will 
screw you) and its breeze-block bulk (1,100 pages) Atlas Shrugged was generally 
off-putting for the average 1957 consumer of novels. One reviewer, Robert 
Kirsch, said: ‘It would be hard to find such a display of grotesque 
eccentricity outside an asylum’.


But the book gradually took off. Now getting on for 20 million sales. John 
Galt, the hero’s “sign of the dollar” has become iconic (Rand chose to be 
buried under a huge bouquet shaped into the greenback symbol).


Want to know what’s driving those Wall Street scum in The Big Short? Read 
Atlas Shrugged

The book inspired Reagan and Bush (via the influence of Rand’s objectivist 
disciple, Alan Greenspan) and diffuses into Gordon Gecko’s “Greed is good”. You 
want to know what’s driving those Wall-Street scum in The Big Short who are 
making themselves billionaires by betting on homelessness for the masses? Read 
Atlas Shrugged.


The plot is simple. All the “wealth creators in America” (collectively the 
‘Atlas’ who’s holding up the world on his shoulders) decide to bugger off and 
leave it to the “looters” and “socialisers” (ie the Democratic party and 
unionised labour). They too can ‘strike’.


It’s a novel with good visual scenes (the crucifixion of John Galt is 
particularly powerful) and it has, for my money, the best train crash ever 
described on paper. It shrieks for screen adaptation.

 Peace and war, life and death … Between the Acts Photograph: PR Image 
Most of us, nowadays – following the posthumous elevation of reputation – will 
have read theWoolf canon <https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf>: Mrs 
Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, etc.


Between the Acts has slipped through the net, somehow. Although too few of us 
get round to it, it is Woolfian gold. The “acts” of the title are Tolstoyan: 
peace and war. They’re also Miltonic: life and death. It can also be read as 
the decay of Old England and the New England, struggling to be born. If, that 
is, it survives the jackboot.


Between the Acts can also be read as a suicide note in fictional form. It was 
published posthumously and unrevised (something that the perfectionist in her 
would have hated), a few months after Woolf drowned herself. The flat in which 
she wrote most of the novel had been destroyed by bombs in the Blitz.

In the early scenes of the novel the characters are constantly looking up at 
the skies (“is it a nightingale?”)

The action takes place over one day in high summer 1939. War broke out in 
early September. The Germans took France with ease. England soon, they fondly 
expected. The Woolfs were on the Gestapo death list.


The novel works in minor key. It opens:


It was a summer’s night and they were talking, in the big room with the 
windows open to the garden, about the cesspool. The county council had promised 
to bring water to the village, but they hadn’t.

It’s about much more than mains water. If you haven’t read Between the Acts 
read it, and if you can’t find time to read it, pray for a TV adaptation.
