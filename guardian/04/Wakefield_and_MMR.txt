Having read your piece on Andrew Wakefield (Autism, Inc 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/06/what-happened-man-mmr-panic>, 
Weekend 6 April) I am surprised that Dr Yudkin found the piece "galling" (
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/09/fitting-epitaph-thatcher-football-picture>
, 10 April) as it would appear to be exactly the kind of hatchet job she would 
wish to read. I must declare an interest as he is my brother in law. I must 
also confess that, on the balance of evidence, his views on the link between 
autism and MMR are probably incorrect.

However, I have never for one minuteÂ doubted that his views are sincere and 
not motivated by some kind of financial greed as strongly implied in your 
piece. The main point I would wish to remind your readers of is, that at no 
time hasAndrew Wakefield <https://www.theguardian.com/society/andrew-wakefield> 
advised parents not to get their children vaccinated against measles, mumps or 
rubella. He advised single vaccinations rather than "all at once".

It was the Department of Health <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> 
that prevented this option being open to parents and when, at times of measles 
outbreaks, another slagging off of Andrew Wakefield occurs it might be as well 
to remember that fact when trying to vilify him further.
