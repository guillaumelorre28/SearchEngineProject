Discover an area of ancient limestone pastures, upland hill farms and the 
beautiful Malham Tarn on a walk through this popular beauty spot. Passing Tarn 
House as you walk, call into the bird hide – a fantastic place to look for the 
wide variety of birds that reside by Malham Tarn. Bring your binoculars and 
look out for great crested grebe, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon, teal, goosander 
and, occasionally, hen harrier. The tarn is also home to a unique community of 
rare plants and animals; stonewort covers most of the bed of the tarn, 
sheltering pea mussels and three-spined stickleback. It also provides food for 
diving birds, such as great crested grebes.

Follow the Dales Way from Yockenthwaite towards Beckermonds. As you walk, 
you'll pass a lime kiln as well as a stone circle that was possibly the base of 
a bronze age burial mound or maybe even a ritual site. Langstrothdale is hay 
flower rich and in spring, try to find the small bird's eye primrose which 
grows just above the road.

Malham Tarn archaeology walk

Start Street Gate car park, grid ref SD905657

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/local-to-you/yorkshire/view-page/item610179/>
Discover archaeological remains in a landscape which has been used by man 
since the Mesolithic era. Follow in the footsteps of monks who farmed much of 
this land by Fountains Abbey. In the 18th century drovers from Scotland would 
bring up to 20,000 cattle here to trade. It is now, a much more peaceful place, 
but the impact of man can clearly be seen.

Upper Wharfedale is a landscape of limestone pavement, glaciated valleys and 
flower-rich hay meadows. The farming of this area has moulded and created many 
interesting wildlife habitats: from hillside streams and craggy outcrops to 
blanket bog and dry-stone walls. The limestone pavement in Strans Wood is made 
up of blocks ("clints") and cracks ("grikes"), where you'll find wild thyme, 
limestone bedstraw and bird's-foot trefoil. The roadsides bloom with wild 
flowers such as the aniseed-scented sweet cicely and pink splashes of bistort. 
A myriad of dry-stone walls dominate the land and the hay meadows enclosed 
within them can be spectacular in late spring and summer when the wild flowers 
blossom.

A great route to follow if you're looking for a longer challenge is the 
Herriot Way. Covering 52 miles, this circular trek combines strolling in the 
valley bottoms with some energetic work on the skylines. It takes in parts of 
Swaledale and Wensleydale including Aysgarth, Grinton, Keld, Askrigg and Hawes. 
It also boasts some of the most stunning walking features of the dales in 
Hardraw Force, Aysgarth Falls and Bolton Castle, as well, of course, open 
moorland and the natural landscape of the dales.

This easy but invigorating walk will take you up Horse Head Pass and along 
remote moorland ridge. The walk gives you views of the Three Peaks of 
Ingleborough, Whernside and Pen-y-ghent before returning along the beautiful 
River Wharfe. The Wharfe flows right through the dales before joining the Ouse 
– while you're out walking, keep an eye out for kingfisher, oystercatcher and 
dippers down by the water's edge.
