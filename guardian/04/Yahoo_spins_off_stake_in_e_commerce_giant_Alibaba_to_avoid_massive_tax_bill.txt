Yahoo is spinning off its $40bn stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba> in order to avoid a 
multibillion-dollar US tax bill.

The plan will place Yahoo’s 15% stake in Alibaba – which has recently been the 
technology company’s most successful moneymaker – into a secondary new firm 
called SpinCo, Yahoosaid in a statement Tuesday 
<https://investor.yahoo.net/ReleaseDetail.cfm?&ReleaseID=893147>.

“I am proud and happy to announce a plan for a tax-free spin-off of our 
Alibaba holdings,”Yahoo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo> CEO and 
president Marissa Mayer said. “Throughout my tenure with the company, we have 
worked tirelessly on a tax-efficient alternative that would maximise the value 
of our Alibaba investment for our shareholders. A tax-free spin-off 
accomplishes this and delivers value directly and exclusively to our 
shareholders.”

Yahoo’s chief financial officer, Ken Goldman, said the company has spent years 
trying to work out how to return capital from the Alibaba stake to shareholders 
without being handed a major tax bill.

“We have actively engaged experts in tax-efficient structures over the past 
two years and have considered a variety of alternatives. We remain aligned with 
our shareholders and our plan is designed to achieve the most advantageous 
return of capital to Yahoo shareholders with the absolute highest probability 
of success,” he said. “The structure provides the investment community with 
clear visibility into the respective entities’ fundamentals, and also 
facilitates valuation transparency in SpinCo because Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba 
will constitute almost all of its value.”

The new entity, which will be created within the next three months and listed 
publicly, will include Yahoo’s 384m shares in Alibaba as well as an unspecified 
“legacy, ancillary” Yahoo business.

Yahoo shares rose by 10% in extended trading. The stock had declined by 2.9% 
to $48 at the close in New York.

“It’s all about Alibaba,” Brian Wieser 
<http://topics.bloomberg.com/brian-wieser/>, an analyst at Pivotal Research 
Group, told Bloomberg. “It’s all that investors have been focused on.”

Yahoo also reported its fourth quarter results, with sales, excluding revenue 
shared with partner websites, falling 1.8% to $1.18bn.
