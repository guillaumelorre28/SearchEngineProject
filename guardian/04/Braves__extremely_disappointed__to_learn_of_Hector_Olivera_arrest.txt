Police have arrested Atlanta Braves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-braves> outfielder Hector Olivera 
after a woman accused him of assault at a hotel outside Washington.

Police in Arlington, Virginia, said a woman at the Ritz-Carlton in Pentagon 
City called them at 6.51am ET. When police arrived, they found a woman with 
visible bruises claiming she had been assaulted by Olivera.

Olivera, who is waiting to appear before a magistrate, was taken into custody 
but has not been formally charged. The woman was taken to Virginia Hospital 
Center in Arlington.

Police said Olivera and the woman know each other, but do not know the nature 
of their relationship.

“We are extremely disappointed and troubled to learn of the allegations 
involving Hector Olivera,” the Braves said in a statement issued Wednesday 
afternoon. “We will continue to gather information and will address this matter 
appropriately as we determine the facts.”

Major League Baseball <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball> has placed 
Olivera on administrative leave, effective immediately.

The 31-year-old Olivera joined the Braves last July as part of a three-team 
trade with the Dodgers, with whom he signed a six-year, $62.5m contract last 
May after defecting from Cuba.

Olivera will continue to receive his $4m salary while on leave. He may ask 
baseball’s independent arbitrator, Fredric Horowitz, to reinstate him to the 
active roster pending MLB’s investigation. If a request is made, a live or 
telephone hearing is to be held within 24 hours of the request.

The Braves, who are are in Washington for a series against the Nationals, have 
recalled infielder Daniel Castro from Triple-A Gwinnett to take Olivera’s spot 
on the roster while he is on leave.

Olivera has appeared in six games this season, batting .211 with two RBIs in 
19 at-bats.
