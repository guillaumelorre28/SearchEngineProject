Guardian US has picked up the Deadline Club’s digital innovation award for The 
Counted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database>
, its ongoing series exposing and documenting lethal force used by law 
enforcement officers across the United States.

The Deadline Club <http://www.deadlineclub.org/> - the largest chapter of the 
Society of Professional Journalists <https://www.spj.org/> - recognized 
reporters Jon Swaine, Oliver Laughland, Jamile Lartey, Ciara McCarthy and Tom 
McCarthy; interactive journalists Kenan Davis, Rich Harris, Nadja Popovich, 
Kenton Powell; filmmakers Valerie Lapinski, Mae Ryan and Laurence 
Mathieu-Leger; production editors Maraithe Thomas and Tom Gottlieb; picture 
editor Sarah Gilbert; and audience editors Mike Barry and Mary Hamilton for 
their work on the project.

The judges’ citation stated: “The Guardian utilized digital innovation in the 
highest degree - through photos, interactive graphs, videos, text and more - to 
showcase stories of people killed by police officers in the United States, and 
the effect it has had on local communities around the country. The reporting 
was extremely comprehensive, and offered a depth of viewpoints that diverged 
from the common reporting rhetoric around this topic. “The Counted” was also 
presented in a beautiful and easily digestible way, giving it the ability to 
reach a wide audience. All of these factors made it a stand-out feature in this 
category.”

Last month the Counted team was also honored with an SPJ Sigma Delta Ch 
<http://www.spj.org/sdxa15.asp>i award for online public service.
