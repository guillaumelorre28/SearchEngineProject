Alejandro González Iñárritu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu>, who won the 
best director Oscar on Sunday for The Revenant, has defended himself in the 
face of criticism for appearing not to applaud the costume designer Jenny 
Beavan as she made her way to the stage to pick up her award.

In a widely-circulated clip – the Vine <https://vine.co/v/igWT9HBUnXp> has 
been viewed over 38m times – Iñárritu is among a number of attendees who are 
shown not to be clapping, instead regarding Beavan with what many have 
interpreted as disdain

 Jenny Beavan makes her way to the stage 
In a statement issued to the Guardian on Thursday, Iñárritu called such 
speculation “mean-spirited and false”.

“I think Jenny Beavan is a masterful costume designer and very deserving of 
the Oscar forMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy>
,” he said. Iñárritu also sent a gif showing that he did clap later, as Beavan 
made her way up the steps to the stage, where she was presented with the award 
by Cate Blanchett.

Iñárritu continued: “By editing and omitting the full reality and suggesting I 
felt anything but admiration is mean-spirited and false. What you don’t see in 
the 10 second clip being circulated is my applause for Jenny as she ascended 
the stairs to the stage.”

He director concluded: “I’ve learned a lot this awards season … that I should 
never cross my arms when I am sitting down.”

Iñárritu’s film took three Academy Awards at the ceremony – best director, 
best cinematography (for Emmanuel Lubezki) and best actor (for Leonardo 
DiCaprio). It missed out on the best picture award toSpotlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight>. The director of that film, Tom 
McCarthy, was another of those in the audience apparently appearing not to 
applaud at any point. Representatives for McCarthy have not responded to the 
Guardian’s request for comment.


Beavan, who celebrated her second Oscar win on Sunday (the first was for A 
Room with a View 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/room-with-view-romance>), has 
subsequently said she didn’t mind the response.

“People don’t have to clap for you,” she told the Hollywood Reporter, “they 
don’t have to like the work.” She added: “[H]onestly, I didn’t clap the whole 
time – your hands get tired. We had done a huge amount of clapping by that 
time.”


Beavan also explained the thinking behind her unconventional outfit: “I am 
British with a slightly rebellious character; I always have been. But, 
actually, in truth … I’m short, I’m fat. I really would look ridiculous in a 
gown. What I was actually wearing at the Oscars was sort of an homage to Mad 
Max – a kind of biker outfit.

“I thought, ‘If I can’t beat them, or if I can’t sort of join them, then why 
not try doing something a little bit fun?’ And George [Miller] loved it. The 
[vegan] leather jacket had the Immortan Joe symbol on the back and I was just 
giving a little wink to Mad Max.”

She also said she was pleased with the response to her clothing choice: “I 
think my Oscar outfit succeeded to some extent because I think the majority in 
the audience seemed to like it. And if I ever happen to get nominated for an 
Oscar again, I’ll probably wear something a little more in line with the film. 
But it will always be trousers, because there is absolutely no way I would 
frighten the LA natives with my legs.”
