Many readers would have included the actor’s performance in the Ealing Studios 
black comedyKind Hearts and Coronets, a film “best known now as an early 
showcase for Alec Guinness”, according to Liese Spencer, writing for the
Guardian in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/favourite-film-kind-hearts-coronets>
. In the film, Guinness plays eight different characters belonging to the same 
aristocratic D’Ascoyne family, quickly transforming from suffragette to 
admiral, from man to woman, from young to old man, often disappearing behind 
layers of makeup and dress.

“My Left Foot is a special favourite of mine,” writes Telvannah, adding that 
the actor “has made some absolutely astounding movies where his change was 
beyond belief”. In the film, Day-Lewis plays an Irish writer and artist with 
cerebral palsy. Reportedly, the actor spent the entire shoot being fed and 
carried around in a wheelchair

. “The transformative genius of Day-Lewis is such that it wouldn’t surprise me 
at all if it later emerges that it was in fact him playing at least four of the 
roles cited [in your list],” concludes reader overrated.

“Where’s Oscar winner John Hurt’s Elephant Man?” asks Yossarianspal, echoing 
many of our readers, who were expecting to see the British actor’s famous 
metamorphosis into Joseph Merrick, the Victorian Englishman whose physical 
deformities took him from sideshow circuit to high society, to be featured in 
our list. “No CGI, either – straight makeup and prosthetics that took many 
hours to apply every day,” explains chephren. But “it wasn’t just the 
prosthetics”, adds AbFalsoQuodLibet, “it was everything, including [his] voice”.

“Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich surprised me,” shares ts808. “I had no 
idea it was her until afterwards,” agrees Yosserian. In Spike Jonze’s 1999 
film, Diaz is barely recognisable, with brown contact lenses, plain makeup and 
an uncontrollable, frizzy brunette wig. She adopts a new acting style and hides 
away the features that made her famous to play animal-obsessed character Lotte 
Schwartz.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/max-von-sydow> 40+ years later,” notes 
njwilson. “It’s astonishing makeup work,” continues the reader, referring to 
the 44-year-old actor’s transformation into 80-year-old priest Father Merrin. 
Each makeup session would last three to four hours. “I don’t think when I saw

“Robin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire,” proposes Sussexperson. “If anything, an 
even more credible bit of cross-dressing [thanDustin Hoffman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman> in Tootsie],” adds the reader. 
The actor had to spend four and a half hours a day in makeup sessions to 
transform into the Scottish nanny, and the film won an Oscar for best makeup in 
1994. His mask was designed in separate pieces to ensure Williams’s facial 
expressions would appear through the layers of makeup.

Another great metamorphosis that should have made the list, according to our 
readers, is Fassbender’s performance in Steve McQueen’sHunger. In the film, 
“[the actor] played the role of Bobby Sands,” explains DonnaWhite, the member 
of the Provisional Irish Republican Army who led the 1981 hunger strike in 
Northern Ireland’s Maze prison. “There are some scenes at the very end where he 
is so severely emaciated I found it hard to watch,” continues the reader. 
“Fassbender inHunger is truly harrowing,” agrees BeckByrneBrian. “He cups his 
own rib cage!”

Many readers noted the absence of Dustin Hoffman’s “largely-forgotten Little 
Big Man,” as Pazuzu describes the film “in which [the actor] plays the 
hundred-year-old sole survivor of the battle of Little Big Horn”. Hoffman was 
32 at the time and transformed into a 121-year-old man thanks to a set of 
eyelid prosthetics and add-on foam latex pieces.

“I would add Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf in The Hours,” says angloserbmom. 
“She is so completely unrecognisable in terms of looks, accent and body 
language, it’s difficult to believe that it really is her.” Dunnock49 agrees, 
adding that “if transformation means being somewhat unrecognisable, I expected
Nicole Kidman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman> to be on the list 
for that wonderful nose inThe Hours”. Kidman had to go through a three-hour 
long makeup session every day to acquire the features of Virginia Woolf.
