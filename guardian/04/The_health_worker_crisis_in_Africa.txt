In Africa, the majority of people do not have access even to basic health 
care. Many die from preventable diseases. At the root of the crisis is a 
critical shortage of health workers. Africa has the fewest per capita of any 
region in the world.

The "brain drain" is part of the problem. Health workers are often underpaid 
and underequipped to meet demand for their services, especially in rural and 
slum areas where the burden of care is heaviest. Understandably, they are drawn 
to better paying jobs in the major cities and abroad.

To make matters worse, many African countries simply do not have the capacity 
to train enough doctors, nurses and clinical officers.

As part of its commitment to strengthening health systems and building healthy 
communities, AMREF trains health workers from across Africa every year. These 
include community members who work to promote health in their own communities, 
as well as professionals attached to the formal health care system.
