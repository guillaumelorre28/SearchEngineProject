Morgan speaks!

Before a ball had been bowled we certainly would have taken 300 as a chase. 
It’s always comforting having guys down the order that can play well and have a 
lot of experience. Willey opened the floodgates. We had Australia 30-3, which 
was pretty unexpected. He took advantage of the conditions, of his chance as 
well. Him coming in and producing a performance like that I thought was 
outstanding.

Death bowling is something we’re trying to improve on. We’ll continue to do 
that over the next year or so.

We’ve got the momentum now. We’re growing in confidence. Tonight has helped a 
huge amount, and hopefully we’ll continue this on Sunday.

Steve Smith says:

We didn’t get our bowling in the right places enough. The first and last ball 
of a lot of overs went for four, and that really cost us. I regretted batting 
first a little bit this morning. I guess it just didn’t work out well for us at 
the start. We’ve got to be more watchful at the beginning and make sure we’ve 
got wickets in the shed at the end. It’s a final now, and we’re certainly going 
to be up for the challenge.

So England canter to 304 runs, with nearly two overs to spare. It is the third 
highest run chase in their history (though really it’s the fourth – they needed 
to score 301 to beat West Indies at Bridgetown in 2007 and did, which is 
probably a smidgeon better than needing to score 300 and getting 304, but I’m 
being picky here) and was achieved with the very minimum of fuss and panic.

Maxwell batted excellently, bowled excellently and took two of the finest 
catches you’ll ever see. His team may have lost, but if he’s not Man of the 
Match there’s something wrong with the world.

England draw level in the series at 2-2 with one to play

That’s a fine run chase from England, who always looked in control of their 
destiny, bowled well and batted excellently, with everyone but Hales, out for a 
two-ball duck, contributing. Hales excepted every batsman but Plunkett, who was 
sent out with a give-it-some-welly brief and fell to an astonishing catch from 
Maxwell, failing to reach 30.

48th over: England 297-7 (Moeen 20, Willey 6)

It starts with Willey driving to cover for one, but then they steal a second 
when Wade lets the ball clip the stumps and deflect away. A single leaves Moeen 
on strike, four runs needed, one decent hit from victory and four balls to find 
it. Instead he takes three to get a single. Anyway,England need three runs from 
12 deliveries.

A dot, a single, a dot, and then an inch-perfect sweep from Moeen that just 
evades the fielder and goes for four! Another couple of singles, andEngland

46th over: England 286-7 (Moeen 14, Willey 1)

To be frank, the match should have stopped right there with Maxwell awarded 
the win, named man of the match, knighted, immediately immortalised in bronze 
and given the Nobel Prize for Defying Physics. Instead Moeen plays out a couple 
of dots and then gets three big runs. England need 14 from four overs at 3.5 
each, and Maxwell will bowl the next.

WICKET! Another brilliant catch from Maxwell! Plunkett c Maxwell b Cummins 17

Another big hit from Plunkett. Maxwell takes the catch on the wicket, knows 
his momentum is carrying him backwards and over the rope, throws the ball back 
into the air, does indeed go over the rope, stops himself, leaps back onto the 
field, catching the ball in mid-air, and lands safe! That’s just awesome!

45th over: England 282-6 (Moeen 11, Plunkett 17)

Pattinson’s back, and Plunkett welcomes him with a hammer blow through the 
covers for four. There follows a single and a post-review leg bye, before 
Plunkett pulls the trigger again, hoisting the ball down the ground for six! 
England need 18 runs and have five overs to get them, at 3.6 runs an over. 
England are edging towards victory here, unless wickets fall and fast.

REVIEW! Is Moeen Ali lbw here?

No, he isn’t. But Australia might as well chance their arm, eh?

44th over: England 269-6 (Moeen 11, Plunkett 5)

Cummins’ penultimate over starts with a couple of dots, and then Plunkett 
mishits to deep square leg for a single. Then another dot, before Moeen steers 
to deep backward point for a couple. No hurry here for England, it’s wickets 
they need to worry about. Talking of which, Moeen feathers the final ball 
through to the keeper, who drops it! That’s an absolute clanger! England need 
31 from six overs at 5.17 each.

43rd over: England 266-6 (Moeen 8, Plunkett 4)

Maxwell bowls, and Moeen pulls his first ball high in the air towards Burns on 
the boundary at deep midwicket, who catches it, lands with his heel on the 
rope, trips over it and falls over backwards. Six runs! The next ball goes – 
along the ground this time – to the same fielder, allowing the fans to do much 
cheerful “whooooaaaaaa…”ing as it heads in his direction, before he fields it 
cleanly. Then, the wicket. Plunkett comes in, and creams his first ball through 
midwicket for four. England need 34 runs from seven overs at 4.86 each.

OUT! Bairstow c Wade b Maxwell 31 (England 261-6)

Very many replays are shown. There is a great deal of rocking and rolling. But 
hotspot shows that, Bairstow having attempted a reverse sweep and missed the 
ball with the bat, there’s a tiny flicker of heat on the glove, and he’s gone! 
That’s a big moment in this match (potentially).

REVIEW! Is Bairstow out here?

I thought Australia had reviewed an earlier catch, but in fact though they 
signalled for a review, it wasn’t required – the umpires sent the decision 
upstairs all by themselves. Anyway, they think Bairstow has been caught behind 
here …

42nd over: England 254-5 (Bairstow 31, Moeen 2)

Cummins bowls, and Bairstow cuts past backward point – no stopping that one, 
Mr Maxwell – for four. And then he totally messes one up, the ball slipping out 
of his hand early and flying to Bairstow at belly-button height. Somehow he 
scoops it over his left shoulder for six – a pretty brilliant shot, and it’s 
obviously called a no-ball. The follow-up is ludicrously wide, but Bairstow 
flings himself and his bat at it, and Australia get away with conceding one run 
when it would otherwise have been a wide, and another free hit. England require 
46 runs from eight overs at 5.75 each.

Maxwell, surely still buzzing after that catch, gets another chance to show 
off, this time with the ball. And he does pretty well again, conceding three 
singles. England require 59 runs from nine overs at 6.56 an over.

40th over: England 238-5 (Bairstow 18, Moeen 0)

Australia, needing wickets, bring back Cummins and Smith sticks himself at 
slip. The over starts with a dot, and it would have continued with a dot as 
well but for a Maxwell misfield. Then Bairstow inside-edges past the stumps – 
England have got away with a few of those today – and Morgan, back on strike, 
gives Maxwell a chance to atone for that misfield in the most eye-catching 
style! Slow-motion replays of that catch make it look even more wildly 
impressive. Just two off the over, and England need 62 at – yes – 6.2 each. I 
didn’t even use a calculator for that one.

WICKET! Morgan c Maxwell b Cummins 92 (England 238-5)

Cummins bowls wide to Maxwell, who cuts wide of Maxwell at backward point – 
but the fielder dives to his right, and holds it! That’s some smart catching!

39th over: England 236-4 (Morgan 91, Bairstow 17)

Marsh bowls, after a change of ends, and Morgan sends the ball looping limply 
towards extra cover. It’s really quite a lot like the stroke that accounted for 
Roy, first ball after a Cummins change of ends. Fortunately for the England 
skipper, this time there’s nobody there to catch it. Nine runs off the over, 
the highlight being a Bairstow boundary, pummelled past mid off. England 
require 64 runs from the final 11 overs, at 5.82 each.

38th over: England 226-4 (Morgan 87, Bairstow 12)

Pattinson’s first delivery is smacked through the covers for four, and when 
his next goes for three England have the requisite seven runs and have four 
balls left to just have a little fun. They get a single, then a dot, then 
another single, and it seems like an unusually sedate form of fun, but then 
Bairstow sends the last past extra cover for four! England require 74 runs from 
12 overs at 6.17 each.

“Is not today proof positive that the speed gun is a very false friend?” 
writes Armand. “The ball that did for Roy definitely stuck itself in a 
bubblegum patch and didn’t come on, clearly visible to the naked eye. Speed gun 
called it in the late eighties. No chance. And if Stoinis bowls at 87mph then 
I’m Waqar Younis’ much much faster younger brother (something which my mother 
categorically denies).” Yes, the speed gun may have whispered a few porkies 
this afternoon.

37th over: England 213-4 (Morgan 79, Bairstow 7)

Hastings bowls and that’s a lovely shot from Morgan! A perfect, delicate late 
nibble to send the ball very fine for four. Then, a dot later, he attacks and 
sends the ball to very nearly the same spot – a lot less deliberately this time 
– off the edge. 10 off the over, and England need 87 from 13 overs, at 6.69 
each.

36th over: England 203-4 (Morgan 70, Bairstow 6)

Morgan is starting to sing here, and he thumps down the ground again – not 
nearly as violently as in the last innings, mind – for four. Seven runs, in 
all, from Marsh’s eighth over, which – it so happens – is precisely what 
England need from every remaining over if they are to win – they need 97 from 
14 overs, at precisely 6.93 per each one.

35th over: England 196-4 (Morgan 64, Bairstow 5)

Hastings is back, and … blammo! … Morgan thunders one down the ground, onto 
the roof of the stand, very nearly over it and down the other side! It gets 
stuck in a gutter somewhere, and a new ball is called for. Eleven, in all, from 
the over, in the shape of three singles, a two and that six.

34th over: England 185-4 (Morgan 57, Bairstow 1)

A lovely wicket-taking delivery, a bit slower than normal and perfectly 
pitched. An important wicket, and the teams remain very evenly matched 
(Australia were 179-4 after 34 overs). Morgan ensures England’s slender 
superiority with four off the last.

33rd over: England 180-3 (Morgan 53, Stokes 41)

Maxwell keeps constructing single city. Four singles off his seventh over. 
Indeed in only one of those seven has anyone scored any number of runs but one 
(and in that one they really went wild, with a two, a four and a six).

Mitch Marsh returns, and concedes three runs from his first couple of

the middle, though, they were impeccable.

30th over: England 166-3 (Morgan 46, Stokes 34)

Stoinis looks incredibly nonchalant, for a man making his ODI debut. Chewing 
gum, strolling to the start of his run-up, doin’ a bit of bowling. Like you do. 
Stokes clubs one through cover for four, which might add at least the hint of a 
crease to his brow.

29th over: England 161-3 (Morgan 45, Stokes 30)

Another Maxwell over, another small cluster of singles. Four of them. Slow and 
steady, no reason to panic. Yet.

28th over: England 157-3 (Morgan 43, Stokes 28)

After a Stokes single, Stoinis bowls one short and Morgan bludgeons it from 
shoulder height. I think he wanted to hit through midwicket, but the ball 
swerves in midair and ends up going straight down the ground for four.

Pattinson’s last over having cost 14 runs, he’s hooked and Maxwell’s back 
again. Four singles later, England are precisely halfway to their target.

26th over: England 146-3 (Morgan 36, Stokes 24)

Stoinis certainly isn’t very expensive (or hasn’t been yet, anyhow). Three 
singles from his second over, and five from his first two combined.

25th over: England 143-3 (Morgan 34, Stokes 23)

Pattinson returns, and Stokes gets another edge – and this one does carry! 
There are no slips, though, so that’s four. Then the same batsman pulls fine, 
getting his angles just right to frustrate the covering fielder, and that’s 
four more! And then he attacks, takes a couple of little steps forward, and 
hits down the ground for four even more! At this point, statistic fans, 
Australia were also 143-3.

24th over: England 129-3 (Morgan 33, Stokes 11)

A first look, then, at Marcus Stoinis, and it’s fairly ho-hum 
medium-to-medium-plus-paced stuff. England get a couple of singles, but then 
the last, short, wide and edged by Stokes, would have brought a wickeet had the 
ball just carried six inches further.

Not out!

Australia seemed keeen, or at least everyone except for Wade, tellingly. And 
replays very clearly show the ball bouncing just before the gloves.

REVIEW! Is Stokes out here?

Marcus Stoinis thinks he’s got a wicket to end his first over. There was a 
sound, but was there a nick? And if there was a nick, was there a bounce on the 
way to the keeper’s gloves?
 Stoinis appeals for a catch behind of Stokes. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty

23rd over: England 127-3 (Morgan 32, Stokes 10)

Six runs! Off one ball! Morgan goes down on one knee in order to fetch 
Maxwell’s delivery and heave it over midwicket. England’s first maximum! And 
then he gets four more through the covers!

22nd over: England 115-3 (Morgan 21, Stokes 10)

Marsh is trying to tempt Morgan into chasing wide balls again. To such an 
extent that his first delivery is called a wide, and the second should have 
been. He then reins things in a bit, and three singles follow.

21th over: England 110-3 (Morgan 18, Stokes 9)

Stokes hits a fine shot into his own ankle, and isn’t far off getting out to 
it as the ball runs behind him. One run from Maxwell’s second over.

20th over: England 109-3 (Morgan 17, Stokes 9)

Marsh bowls, and Morgan smacks one pretty hard, but straight to mid off, and 
then cuts nicely, but again to a fielder. It’s just not really happening for 
England at the moment on the run-accumulation front. At the end of the 14th 
over they were 20 runs ahead of where Australia had been at that stage, and a 
wicket to the good. Now they lead by nine, having lost the same number of 
wickets.

18th over: England 103-3 (Morgan 15, Stokes 6)

Ooof! Morgan chops the ball into the ground, just wide of the stumps. And then 
Marsh bowls really wide, Morgan stretches to fetch it and he pokes the ball 
between cover and backward point, and above both of them, for four, tickling 
England’s score into treble figures. “I’m getting big waves of tearful 
nostalgia here,” writes Robert Wilson. “In an era obsessed by height, weight 
and BMI, Taylor is showing the distinct advantage of being a titch. As soon as 
it’s wide, he’s in the ascendancy. We’ve all seen this in cricket we’ve 
actually played, the inexplicable cutting and pulling brilliance of some 
unlikely Munchkin but Taylor is old-school. It reminds me of hazy childhood 
memories of Gavaskar and Vishwanath cutting sataniclly fast West Indian quicks 
from a foot and a half above their heads and then going down to tap the pitch 
like it was justnothing. Oh bumcakes, he’s out.”

17th over: England 96-3 (Morgan 11, Stokes 3)

England showing a huge variety of different ways to slightly mistime strokes 
currently. As a result, the runs are coming in drips rather than waves (and one 
of the five off this Cummins over was a wide). One boundary in the last seven 
overs now.

And with that, I’m off. It’s been a blast. Bye!
 
Morgan speaks!

Before a ball had been bowled we certainly would have taken 300 as a chase. 
It’s always comforting having guys down the order that can play well and have a 
lot of experience. Willey opened the floodgates. We had Australia 30-3, which 
was pretty unexpected. He took advantage of the conditions, of his chance as 
well. Him coming in and producing a performance like that I thought was 
outstanding.

Death bowling is something we’re trying to improve on. We’ll continue to do 
that over the next year or so.

We’ve got the momentum now. We’re growing in confidence. Tonight has helped a 
huge amount, and hopefully we’ll continue this on Sunday.
 
And the man of the match is … Eoin Morgan!

I hope that magnum of Champagne is corked.
 
Steve Smith says:

We didn’t get our bowling in the right places enough. The first and last ball 
of a lot of overs went for four, and that really cost us. I regretted batting 
first a little bit this morning. I guess it just didn’t work out well for us at 
the start. We’ve got to be more watchful at the beginning and make sure we’ve 
got wickets in the shed at the end. It’s a final now, and we’re certainly going 
to be up for the challenge.
 
So England canter to 304 runs, with nearly two overs to spare. It is the third 
highest run chase in their history (though really it’s the fourth – they needed 
to score 301 to beat West Indies at Bridgetown in 2007 and did, which is 
probably a smidgeon better than needing to score 300 and getting 304, but I’m 
being picky here) and was achieved with the very minimum of fuss and panic.

Maxwell batted excellently, bowled excellently and took two of the finest 
catches you’ll ever see. His team may have lost, but if he’s not Man of the 
Match there’s something wrong with the world.
 
That’s a fine run chase from England, who always looked in control of their 
destiny, bowled well and batted excellently, with everyone but Hales, out for a 
two-ball duck, contributing. Hales excepted every batsman but Plunkett, who was 
sent out with a give-it-some-welly brief and fell to an astonishing catch from 
Maxwell, failing to reach 30.
 
48.2 overs: England 304-7 (Moeen 21, Willey 12)

And Willey finishes it in style, smashing down the ground for six!

48.1 overs: England 298-7 (Moeen 21, Willey 6)

Hastings bowls, and Moeen pulls to deep square leg for an easy single. Two 
needed.
 
48th over: England 297-7 (Moeen 20, Willey 6)

It starts with Willey driving to cover for one, but then they steal a second 
when Wade lets the ball clip the stumps and deflect away. A single leaves Moeen 
on strike, four runs needed, one decent hit from victory and four balls to find 
it. Instead he takes three to get a single. Anyway,England need three runs from 
12 deliveries.
 
47th over: England 293-7 (Moeen 19, Willey 3)

A dot, a single, a dot, and then an inch-perfect sweep from Moeen that just 
evades the fielder and goes for four! Another couple of singles, andEngland 
need seven runs from three overs at 2.3 each.
 
46th over: England 286-7 (Moeen 14, Willey 1)

To be frank, the match should have stopped right there with Maxwell awarded 
the win, named man of the match, knighted, immediately immortalised in bronze 
and given the Nobel Prize for Defying Physics. Instead Moeen plays out a couple 
of dots and then gets three big runs. England need 14 from four overs at 3.5 
each, and Maxwell will bowl the next.

Another big hit from Plunkett. Maxwell takes the catch on the wicket, knows 
his momentum is carrying him backwards and over the rope, throws the ball back 
into the air, does indeed go over the rope, stops himself, leaps back onto the 
field, catching the ball in mid-air, and lands safe! That’s just awesome!

45th over: England 282-6 (Moeen 11, Plunkett 17)

Pattinson’s back, and Plunkett welcomes him with a hammer blow through the 
covers for four. There follows a single and a post-review leg bye, before 
Plunkett pulls the trigger again, hoisting the ball down the ground for six! 
England need 18 runs and have five overs to get them, at 3.6 runs an over. 
England are edging towards victory here, unless wickets fall and fast.
 
Mainly because the ball pitched about a foot outside leg stump.
 
No, he isn’t. But Australia might as well chance their arm, eh?
 
44th over: England 269-6 (Moeen 11, Plunkett 5)

Cummins’ penultimate over starts with a couple of dots, and then Plunkett 
mishits to deep square leg for a single. Then another dot, before Moeen steers 
to deep backward point for a couple. No hurry here for England, it’s wickets 
they need to worry about. Talking of which, Moeen feathers the final ball 
through to the keeper, who drops it! That’s an absolute clanger! England need 
31 from six overs at 5.17 each.
 
43rd over: England 266-6 (Moeen 8, Plunkett 4)

Maxwell bowls, and Moeen pulls his first ball high in the air towards Burns on 
the boundary at deep midwicket, who catches it, lands with his heel on the 
rope, trips over it and falls over backwards. Six runs! The next ball goes – 
along the ground this time – to the same fielder, allowing the fans to do much 
cheerful “whooooaaaaaa…”ing as it heads in his direction, before he fields it 
cleanly. Then, the wicket. Plunkett comes in, and creams his first ball through 
midwicket for four. England need 34 runs from seven overs at 4.86 each.
 
Very many replays are shown. There is a great deal of rocking and rolling. But 
hotspot shows that, Bairstow having attempted a reverse sweep and missed the 
ball with the bat, there’s a tiny flicker of heat on the glove, and he’s gone! 
That’s a big moment in this match (potentially).
 
I thought Australia had reviewed an earlier catch, but in fact though they 
signalled for a review, it wasn’t required – the umpires sent the decision 
upstairs all by themselves. Anyway, they think Bairstow has been caught behind 
here …

42nd over: England 254-5 (Bairstow 31, Moeen 2)

Cummins bowls, and Bairstow cuts past backward point – no stopping that one, 
Mr Maxwell – for four. And then he totally messes one up, the ball slipping out 
of his hand early and flying to Bairstow at belly-button height. Somehow he 
scoops it over his left shoulder for six – a pretty brilliant shot, and it’s 
obviously called a no-ball. The follow-up is ludicrously wide, but Bairstow 
flings himself and his bat at it, and Australia get away with conceding one run 
when it would otherwise have been a wide, and another free hit. England require 
46 runs from eight overs at 5.75 each.
 
41st over: England 241-5 (Bairstow 20, Moeen 1)

Maxwell, surely still buzzing after that catch, gets another chance to show 
off, this time with the ball. And he does pretty well again, conceding three 
singles. England require 59 runs from nine overs at 6.56 an over.
 
40th over: England 238-5 (Bairstow 18, Moeen 0)

Australia, needing wickets, bring back Cummins and Smith sticks himself at 
slip. The over starts with a dot, and it would have continued with a dot as 
well but for a Maxwell misfield. Then Bairstow inside-edges past the stumps – 
England have got away with a few of those today – and Morgan, back on strike, 
gives Maxwell a chance to atone for that misfield in the most eye-catching 
style! Slow-motion replays of that catch make it look even more wildly 
impressive. Just two off the over, and England need 62 at – yes – 6.2 each. I 
didn’t even use a calculator for that one.
 
Cummins bowls wide to Maxwell, who cuts wide of Maxwell at backward point – 
but the fielder dives to his right, and holds it! That’s some smart catching!
 Morgan walks for 92. Photograph: BPI/REX Shutterstock  
39th over: England 236-4 (Morgan 91, Bairstow 17)

Marsh bowls, after a change of ends, and Morgan sends the ball looping limply 
towards extra cover. It’s really quite a lot like the stroke that accounted for 
Roy, first ball after a Cummins change of ends. Fortunately for the England 
skipper, this time there’s nobody there to catch it. Nine runs off the over, 
the highlight being a Bairstow boundary, pummelled past mid off. England 
require 64 runs from the final 11 overs, at 5.82 each.
 
38th over: England 226-4 (Morgan 87, Bairstow 12)

Pattinson’s first delivery is smacked through the covers for four, and when 
his next goes for three England have the requisite seven runs and have four 
balls left to just have a little fun. They get a single, then a dot, then 
another single, and it seems like an unusually sedate form of fun, but then 
Bairstow sends the last past extra cover for four! England require 74 runs from 
12 overs at 6.17 each.

“Is not today proof positive that the speed gun is a very false friend?” 
writes Armand. “The ball that did for Roy definitely stuck itself in a 
bubblegum patch and didn’t come on, clearly visible to the naked eye. Speed gun 
called it in the late eighties. No chance. And if Stoinis bowls at 87mph then 
I’m Waqar Younis’ much much faster younger brother (something which my mother 
categorically denies).” Yes, the speed gun may have whispered a few porkies 
this afternoon.
 
37th over: England 213-4 (Morgan 79, Bairstow 7)

Hastings bowls and that’s a lovely shot from Morgan! A perfect, delicate late 
nibble to send the ball very fine for four. Then, a dot later, he attacks and 
sends the ball to very nearly the same spot – a lot less deliberately this time 
– off the edge. 10 off the over, and England need 87 from 13 overs, at 6.69 
each.
 
36th over: England 203-4 (Morgan 70, Bairstow 6)

Morgan is starting to sing here, and he thumps down the ground again – not 
nearly as violently as in the last innings, mind – for four. Seven runs, in 
all, from Marsh’s eighth over, which – it so happens – is precisely what 
England need from every remaining over if they are to win – they need 97 from 
14 overs, at precisely 6.93 per each one.
 
35th over: England 196-4 (Morgan 64, Bairstow 5)

Hastings is back, and … blammo! … Morgan thunders one down the ground, onto 
the roof of the stand, very nearly over it and down the other side! It gets 
stuck in a gutter somewhere, and a new ball is called for. Eleven, in all, from 
the over, in the shape of three singles, a two and that six.
 
34th over: England 185-4 (Morgan 57, Bairstow 1)

A lovely wicket-taking delivery, a bit slower than normal and perfectly 
pitched. An important wicket, and the teams remain very evenly matched 
(Australia were 179-4 after 34 overs). Morgan ensures England’s slender 
superiority with four off the last.
 
Stokes is profoundly yorked by Marsh, the ball dipping under his bat and into 
off stump!

33rd over: England 180-3 (Morgan 53, Stokes 41)

Maxwell keeps constructing single city. Four singles off his seventh over. 
Indeed in only one of those seven has anyone scored any number of runs but one 
(and in that one they really went wild, with a two, a four and a six).
 
32nd over: England 176-3 (Morgan 51, Stokes 39)

Mitch Marsh returns, and concedes three runs from his first couple of 
deliveries and then four from the last, whipped away by Stokes. The three in 
the middle, though, they were impeccable.
 Morgan brings up his 50. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images  
31st over: England 169-3 (Morgan 48, Stokes 35)

Maxwell has now bowled three full overs since either batsman last scored any 
number of runs off any of his deliveries that wasn’t one. Three more ones here.
 
30th over: England 166-3 (Morgan 46, Stokes 34)

Stoinis looks incredibly nonchalant, for a man making his ODI debut. Chewing 
gum, strolling to the start of his run-up, doin’ a bit of bowling. Like you do. 
Stokes clubs one through cover for four, which might add at least the hint of a 
crease to his brow.
 
29th over: England 161-3 (Morgan 45, Stokes 30)

Another Maxwell over, another small cluster of singles. Four of them. Slow and 
steady, no reason to panic. Yet.
 
28th over: England 157-3 (Morgan 43, Stokes 28)

After a Stokes single, Stoinis bowls one short and Morgan bludgeons it from 
shoulder height. I think he wanted to hit through midwicket, but the ball 
swerves in midair and ends up going straight down the ground for four.
 
27th over: England 150-3 (Morgan 38, Stokes 26)

Pattinson’s last over having cost 14 runs, he’s hooked and Maxwell’s back 
again. Four singles later, England are precisely halfway to their target.
 
26th over: England 146-3 (Morgan 36, Stokes 24)

Stoinis certainly isn’t very expensive (or hasn’t been yet, anyhow). Three 
singles from his second over, and five from his first two combined.
 
25th over: England 143-3 (Morgan 34, Stokes 23)

Pattinson returns, and Stokes gets another edge – and this one does carry! 
There are no slips, though, so that’s four. Then the same batsman pulls fine, 
getting his angles just right to frustrate the covering fielder, and that’s 
four more! And then he attacks, takes a couple of little steps forward, and 
hits down the ground for four even more! At this point, statistic fans, 
Australia were also 143-3.
 
24th over: England 129-3 (Morgan 33, Stokes 11)

A first look, then, at Marcus Stoinis, and it’s fairly ho-hum 
medium-to-medium-plus-paced stuff. England get a couple of singles, but then 
the last, short, wide and edged by Stokes, would have brought a wickeet had the 
ball just carried six inches further.
 
Australia seemed keeen, or at least everyone except for Wade, tellingly. And 
replays very clearly show the ball bouncing just before the gloves.
 
Marcus Stoinis thinks he’s got a wicket to end his first over. There was a 
sound, but was there a nick? And if there was a nick, was there a bounce on the 
way to the keeper’s gloves?
 Stoinis appeals for a catch behind of Stokes. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty 
Images  
23rd over: England 127-3 (Morgan 32, Stokes 10)

Six runs! Off one ball! Morgan goes down on one knee in order to fetch 
Maxwell’s delivery and heave it over midwicket. England’s first maximum! And 
then he gets four more through the covers!
 
22nd over: England 115-3 (Morgan 21, Stokes 10)

Marsh is trying to tempt Morgan into chasing wide balls again. To such an 
extent that his first delivery is called a wide, and the second should have 
been. He then reins things in a bit, and three singles follow.
 
21th over: England 110-3 (Morgan 18, Stokes 9)

Stokes hits a fine shot into his own ankle, and isn’t far off getting out to 
it as the ball runs behind him. One run from Maxwell’s second over.
 
20th over: England 109-3 (Morgan 17, Stokes 9)

Marsh bowls, and Morgan smacks one pretty hard, but straight to mid off, and 
then cuts nicely, but again to a fielder. It’s just not really happening for 
England at the moment on the run-accumulation front. At the end of the 14th 
over they were 20 runs ahead of where Australia had been at that stage, and a 
wicket to the good. Now they lead by nine, having lost the same number of 
wickets.
 
19th over: England 107-3 (Morgan 16, Stokes 8)

Some spin, then, from Maxwell, and some singles for England. Three of them. 
And a wide.

18th over: England 103-3 (Morgan 15, Stokes 6)

Ooof! Morgan chops the ball into the ground, just wide of the stumps. And then 
Marsh bowls really wide, Morgan stretches to fetch it and he pokes the ball 
between cover and backward point, and above both of them, for four, tickling 
England’s score into treble figures. “I’m getting big waves of tearful 
nostalgia here,” writes Robert Wilson. “In an era obsessed by height, weight 
and BMI, Taylor is showing the distinct advantage of being a titch. As soon as 
it’s wide, he’s in the ascendancy. We’ve all seen this in cricket we’ve 
actually played, the inexplicable cutting and pulling brilliance of some 
unlikely Munchkin but Taylor is old-school. It reminds me of hazy childhood 
memories of Gavaskar and Vishwanath cutting sataniclly fast West Indian quicks 
from a foot and a half above their heads and then going down to tap the pitch 
like it was justnothing. Oh bumcakes, he’s out.”
 
17th over: England 96-3 (Morgan 11, Stokes 3)

England showing a huge variety of different ways to slightly mistime strokes 
currently. As a result, the runs are coming in drips rather than waves (and one 
of the five off this Cummins over was a wide). One boundary in the last seven 
overs now.
