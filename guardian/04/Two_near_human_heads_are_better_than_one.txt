The actors who played two of the most iconic cyborgs of the 80s are to join 
forces in the forthcoming Alien vs Predator movie.

Peter Weller, the Wisconsin-born actor who played the eponymous man-machine in 
two of the three Robocop films, will join Lance Henriksen, who starred as the 
humane android Bishop in both Aliens and its follow-up Alien 3, in the new film.

According to cult US website Aint it Cool News, Henriksen will play Charles 
Weyland, a senior figure in the greedy Weyland-Yutani corporation featured in 
all four of the Alien movies. Weller will play his billionaire industrialist 
partner.

Alien vs Predator is based on the comic book of the same name, which brought 
together the acid-dripping monsters made famous in four increasingly vapid 
Sigourney Weaver films with the equally nasty hunter species from Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's 1987 sci-fi in the jungle outing.

The new film, directed by Paul Anderson of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil 
fame, sees a team of scientists and archaeologists finding themselves caught up 
in a battle between a hive of aliens and five teenage predators during an 
archaeological expedition in Antarctica.

The implausibility of either species being on Earth in the first place is 
unlikely to bother the type of producers who killed off Alien's Ripley in the 
third movie and then brought her back as a clone for Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien 
Resurrection.
