Once enormously popular and much-memorised, this week's poem, Alfred 
Tennyson's The Charge of the Light Brigade, was also vilified, according toJB 
Steane <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Steane>, as "horrid rubbish". It's a 
verdict Steane himself tentatively commends ("I think there might be something 
in it.") Even the poet seems to have found its popularity irritating. So how 
does it look from 2014? Great poem, good poem, bad poem, good bad poem?

It's certainly the kind of poem people love or hate for anything-but-literary 
reasons. The subject is an emotive one, centred on the timelessly appealing 
stereotype of heroic ordinary soldier versus incompetent high command (a theme 
which continued to grip the imagination of the poets of the first world war). 
Tennyson's poem is not, of course, a fantasy: it's a largely accurate account 
of an actual, and very dreadful, historical eventwhich took place during the 
Battle of Balaclava <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade>. 
To its admirers, the poem's a tribute to the Light Brigade's selfless courage: 
to its attackers, it's the sentimental glorification of war and empire.

Written in response to a Times editorial, in which the author referred to "a 
hideous blunder" 
<http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/publication-%E2%80%98-charge-light-brigade%E2%80%99>
 in the conduct of the battle, The Charge of the Light Brigade may signal a new 
journalistic genre of poetry, where, if the news can't be got from poems, poets 
can certainly get their poems from the news. But this is also poetry in the 
ancient costume of the ballad, re-tailored for new times by the Romantic poets 
a little earlier. The genre is an oral one, and it's significant that, before 
he wrote anything down,Tennyson sang the poem aloud 
<http://www.paularmfield.com/press/dr-brian-hintons-full-sleevenotes-for-tennyson-album/>
 as he walked over the chalk ridge nearhis home on the Isle of Wight 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennyson_Down%E2%80%9D 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennyson_Down>. Back in his study he swiftly 
transcribed it, then sent it to the London Examiner, where it was published a 
week later, on 9 December 1854.

The Times article seems to have led Tennyson to the phrase, "Someone had 
blunder'd", and so to his perfectly-chosen metrical scheme – dactylic dimeter. 
"Blunder'd," though used only once, begets the rhyme with "the six hundred", 
main component of the poem's trenchant refrain. Tumultuous hoof-beats sound in 
these repetitions. It's as if one word had acted as an aural shortcut into 
Tennyson's whole imagination. The line, "Someone had blundered," almost 
casually inserted in verse two, is an understatement in the context, and all 
the more effective for it.

Since the poem soon became essential reading for the soldiers in the field, it 
seems that Tennyson's imagination stood the test of authenticity: at least, he 
had produced a story which drew assent. The poem is remarkable for the 
simplicity and dramatic immediacy of its description. The relentless pace of 
the cavalry as they gallop into "the mouth of Hell" is vividly rendered in the 
breathlessly short lines and thundering rhythms, whereas the return of the 
survivors brings a gasp of shocked recognition: "but not/ Not the six hundred".

Tennyson's poem doesn't contribute to the analysis of the "blunder" itself, 
though he might have found rich material in the psychology of the main players. 
I don't think it sets out to glorify war, but it's certainly not a protest. It 
recreates the sabre-flashing excitement of warfare, even in the ironical 
context of bare sabres against guns. There's a certain theatricality and 
exaggeration in the twice-repeated line, "All the world wonder'd". Skilful 
elision and brilliantly descriptive shorthand at times approach cliche. Yet its 
narrative grip and verve are beyond question. It's not a great poem, perhaps, 
but it is a great ballad.

Tennyson himself recites the poem on a wax-cylinder recording here

And, yes, the text has even beentranslated into Russian

 The Charge of the Light Brigade

       I
HALF a league, half a league, 
   Half a league onward, 
All in the valley of Death 
   Rode the six hundred. 
'Forward, the Light Brigade! 
Charge for the guns!' he said: 
Into the valley of Death 
   Rode the six hundred.

       II
'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
Was there a man dismay'd? 
Not tho' the soldier knew 
   Some one had blunder'd: 
Their's not to make reply, 
Their's not to reason why, 
Their's but to do and die: 
Into the valley of Death 
   Rode the six hundred.

       III 
Cannon to right of them, 
Cannon to left of them, 
Cannon in front of them 
   Volley'd and thunder'd; 
Storm'd at with shot and shell, 
Boldly they rode and well, 
Into the jaws of Death, 
Into the mouth of Hell 
   Rode the six hundred.

       IV
Flash'd all their sabres bare, 
Flash'd as they turn'd in air 
Sabring the gunners there, 
Charging an army, while 
   All the world wonder'd: 
Plunged in the battery-smoke 
Right thro' the line they broke; 
Cossack and Russian 
Reel'd from the sabre-stroke 
   Shatter'd and sunder'd. 
Then they rode back, but not 
   Not the six hundred.

       V
Cannon to right of them, 
Cannon to left of them, 
Cannon behind them 
   Volley'd and thunder'd; 
Storm'd at with shot and shell, 
While horse and hero fell, 
They that had fought so well 
Came thro' the jaws of Death, 
Back from the mouth of Hell, 
All that was left of them, 
   Left of six hundred.

       VI
When can their glory fade? 
O the wild charge they made! 
   All the world wonder'd. 
Honour the charge they made! 
Honour the Light Brigade, 
   Noble six hundred!
