"If a person falls ill or has a problem here in Ghana, the first point of call 
will be with a traditional healer, then a chemical seller (licensed drug 
store), then a pharmacy and only then a health clinic," says Faustina from 
Marie Stopes International (MSI) Ghana. "The same chain applies if a woman 
falls pregnant. Therefore in order to reach the most people we must bring our 
services to the doorsteps of our clients."

MSI launched its BlueStar franchising scheme in Ghana this March to widen 
access to safe abortion services. This scheme uses existing private providers 
to give quality sexual and reproductive health services. They now have over 100 
franchises as part of their network.

As a franchisee, a provider receives training in areas such as family planning 
and counselling and can also purchase family planning products at subsidised 
rates. Facilities are refurbished and branded with the BlueStar logo. They are 
then promoted to clients to assist them in quality services. Because of this 
branding, franchisees' income can go up by over 500 GHC (Â£250) a month.

Very few of these private providers were providing long-term family planning 
services or complete abortion care services before they joined the scheme. 
Since BlueStar was launched, 1,093 safe, complete abortion care services have 
been provided by BlueStar franchisees. By this method, MSI is able to improve 
and standardise services, and offer a more sustainable solution for providing 
safe abortions.JH
