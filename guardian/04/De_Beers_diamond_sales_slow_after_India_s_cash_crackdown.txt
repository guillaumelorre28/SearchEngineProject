Anglo American <https://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-american> has said 
demand at its latest De Beers diamond sale showed a slowdown in response to 
India’s withdrawal of high-value banknotes, but was still higher than a year 
ago when commodity trade was slumping.

 The decision by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to scrap 500-rupee and 
1,000-rupee banknotes as part of a crackdown on tax dodgers and counterfeiters 
has dented consumer spending in a country where most people are paid in cash, 
and buy what they need with cash.

 Anglo American said rough diamond sales for De Beers’ final sale of the year 
amounted to $418m, compared with the $476m value of the previous sales cycle 
this year.

 “While the trade in lower value rough diamonds is experiencing a temporary 
slowdown as a result of the demonetisation programme in India, demand across 
the rest of the product mix continued to be healthy,” the De Beers chief 
executive, Bruce Cleaver, said.

 “Pleasingly, sales were also significantly higher than those for the 
equivalent cycle in 2015.”
