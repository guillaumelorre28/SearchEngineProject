While predominantly helping the batsmen, the 38-year-old has fed into all 
aspects of England’s planning, dispensing advice drawn from his vast experience 
of playing in Asia and speaking to Alastair Cook on the art of captaining 
leg-spinners beforeAdil Rashid’s standout debut

With three further assignments on the subcontinent in the next 12 months – the 
World Twenty20 is held in India next March before Test and one-day tours to 
Bangladesh and India at the end of the year – England could once again tap the 
knowledge of a player with 25,957 international runs.

“We’d love to have him back so I’ll have to speak to Straussy about that,” 
said Bayliss, the England head coach, who worked with Jayawardene when in the 
same role with Sri Lanka. “The boys enjoyed him. I think he gave all of our 
players a little bit of a different perspective on things; a different way of 
thinking about how to play the game in Asian conditions.

“He’s a very down-to-earth, normal bloke. The guys were having a joke with 
him, taking the mickey out of him at the end and he was doing the same with 
them. To be honest, within a day or two it was like he was one of the team.”

Speaking about his time in the England set-up Jayawardene told the ECB 
website: “I love the approach of the young guys who haven’t had a lot of 
experience in the subcontinent. Guys like Jonny Bairstow and James Taylor, plus 
Moeen Ali wants to learn and is always asking lots of questions.

“Even Belly [Ian Bell] and Cooky – they’re obviously experienced campaigners 
but the attitude they have is to improve. And there are naturally gifted 
players like Stokesy [Ben Stokes] who just enjoy these kinds of challenges.”
