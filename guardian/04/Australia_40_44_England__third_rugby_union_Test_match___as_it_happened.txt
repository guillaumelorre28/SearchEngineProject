That was a whirlwind of a game for the live blogger and I’m spent. Sorry I 
couldn’t get to your late flurry of emails and tweets. Don’t you hate it when 
the game gets in the way of your correspondence?

Wallabies fans will be smarting, no doubt, but I’m sure most will find 
admiration for this England side, one that came, saw and conquered. After the 
Brexit, never mind the stunning de-crowning of Miss Great Britain, this result 
will no doubt put a smile on many faces that are in desperate need of one.

I’ll leave you with Robert Kitson’s match report. Fare well, dear readers, and 
cheerio.

England complete Australia whitewash with thrilling 44-40 win in third Test

For the first time since 1971 the Wallabies have lost their first three 
matches of the calendar year. Having made the World Cup final I can’t say many 
would have expected such a flat start to 2016. But England deserve enormous 
credit. They’ve outplayed Australia comprehensively.

Tonight’s game, though free-flowing, wasn’t really a classic. There were too 
many mistakes and sloppy moments (and, possibly, points) for that. But it sure 
was entertaining.

Farrell is man of the match, by the way, and now Hartley is on the dais 
accepting the Cook Cup. He graciously thanks his hosts and praises his team for 
completing their goal of winning 3-0. “We go again, boys, we go again!”

Dylan Hartley now, beaming brightly to the point you barely notice his ears, 
which wouldn’t look out of place in an aloo gobi. “Obviously very happy with 
the tour. We can all agree it wasn’t out perfect game today but we put 
everything into it, it was our last 80 minutes of the season. I’m really proud 
of the guys. And we’ve made history.”

Stephen Moore: “It’s been a tough series, and you can’t give up 44 points and 
expect to win a game... We’ve got to keep belief. To England’s credit they 
deserved it. They played well and we weren’t quite good enough.”

Don’t look now, Stephen, but the All Blacks await.

Schalk van der Merwe, en route to Cape Town, will be delighted. “Following 
your updates ... from an Emirates flight 30 000 feet in the sky. Go ENGLAND...”

Time to celebrate. Order some more in-flight peanuts!

David Bradley puts it out there: “[This] must be one of England’s greatest 
sporting achievements ever. Not really a big rugby fan but fantastic for 
English rugby.”

Try! Australia 40-44 England (Naiyaravoro 80 + 1 min)

Naiyaravoro catches it and there’s no stopping him from there, earning a 
consolation try that will offer the Wallabies no consolation at all.

80 min The Wallabies regain the ball after England fail to hold possession and 
a scrum is called as the final siren sounds.

Australia win the ball and move the ball to the right wing, then back towards 
the left. Foley gets himself close to the England line before Phipps picks up 
from the back of the ruck and rifles a ball to Naiyaravoro standing inside the 
left corner post.

78 min From an England lineout on the Wallabies 22 England build through a 
dozen or so phases of one-out running, the kind that eats minutes on a clock. 
On phase 12 the Wallabies, desperate for the ball, are penalised when Phipps 
steps over the ruck taking out Care. It’s 35m out, right in front.

73 min Australia find touch on the England 22. England win the lineout and get 
rid of the ball in the manner you’d get rid of a hand grenade with the pin 
pulled out of it.

Haylett-Petty soon returns the kick. Brown kicks it back. Haylett-Petty does 
the same. Perhaps itis an unexploded hand grenade.

71 min From the kickoff Australia swarm on Brown and force a loose ball. 
England dive on it but are penalised for not releasing. This is right in front 
and Foley will take the certain three points on offer.

looking like missing.
 Boom! Dead-eye Owen Farrell slots another penalty between the sticks.

Try! Australia 32-36 England (George 67)

Jamie George is over! What a comedy of errors in the lead-up. Phipps picked up 
a loose ball facing his own posts and passed into Folau’s boots. England 
regained possession and Itoje drove ever so close to the line before England 
recycled. Danny Care then passed left to George and the ball hit George’s knees 
and was propelled into the in-goal. George followed through to score his first 
Test try!

65 min England building momentum and find touch 15m out from the Wallabies’ 
line. Polota-Nau to take it from the spot where Moore threw straight to Robshaw 
early in the second half. No such error this time.

64 min England pinch the ball in midfield and they shift it left. From Ford to 
Farrell to Watson, and the winger has a sliver of daylight in front of him. 
Enough to get the crowd on its feet. But Foley pulls the blinds, bundling 
Watson into touch.

63 min There’s another penalty for England for Australia not rolling away. 
Nice pressure release for England, that one, as they were metres out from their 
own line.

Jonathan Dowson writes: “This game is sounding like a classic end to end Test 
match….. sadly I’m working the nightshift and it’s not on in the office.”

Not on in the office? What kind of Dickensian hellhole do you work in?

Try! Australia 30-28 England (Folau 57)

That was too easy! Australia pass laterally along the England 22 with nothing 
seemingly on. But Toomua steps off his right and he brushes out of Billy 
Vunipola’s tackle. Folau looms up on his left shoulder like a sports car and he 
outpaces the cover defence to score.

to Hooper running an angled line back inside. Hooper is hit by three tacklers 
but he wiggles and wriggles and reaches out to place the tip of the ball just 
on, or just short of, the line.

Try! Australia 18-22 (B. Vunipola 44)

From a scrum a few metres out the Wallabies steel themselves for a shove ... 
but Vunipola catches them offguard, picks the ball up from the back of the 
scrum and scoots down the blindside to dive over despite the cover tackle of 
Hooper and Haylett-Petty!
 Billy Vunipola of England holds off Michael Hooper to score their third try.

44 min England almost score! From a Wallaby line-out on their own try line 
Stephen Moore throws it over Coleman and straight into the arms of a charging 
Robshaw. He looks certain to score but gold jerseys converge on him and, though 
he gets over the line, he’s held up!

42 min Coleman gets into the action, taking a ball from his fellow twin tower, 
Skelton. Slipper then burrows a little deeper before Foley attempts a cheeky 
midfield grubber for Hooper sprinting through the line. Nowell is on to it, 
however, and he cleans up.

An England kick then hits the overhead wires, I presume the ones the overhead 
camera runs along. Not an internet wire that a dodgy electrician installed.

Half-time: Australia 18-17 England

Phew, quite a bit of to and fro don’t you think? It’s certainly more open than 
the first and second Tests. Anyone’s game.

Penalty! Australia 18-17 (Foley 40 + 1 min)

And with the last action of the half, Foley gives Australia the most slender 
of leads.

40 min Australia push into England’s half through Skelton, Folau and Slipper 
as the siren goes. McMahon finds half a yard, Haylett-Petty finds 10 more on 
the right wing. Then a cross-field kick is aimed for Folau who out jumps Nowell 
a few metres out from England’s line — but as he falls to earth the ball is 
dislodged and lost. Had he stayed on his feet he would have taken some stopping.

But we’re going back for an off-side penalty and Foley will kick from 20m out, 
five metres to the right of the posts.

38 min A nice touch finder by Ford takes play from the England 22 to 35m out 
from the Aussie line.

After winning the lineout Australia sweep left but Vunipola pilfers the ball 
like a bully pinching sweets! England settle through six phases but then, on 
the edge of the Wallabies’ 22, Youngs throws a suspect short ball that makes 
the crowd groan. Yes, says the referee, it was forward.

36 min The Wallabies have the ball in hand again and a chip over the top is

28 min From the kickoff Skelton takes out Anthony Watson as the England winger 
leaps to catch the re-start. It looks bad, and he did take him out in the air, 
but after a replay you can see Skelton is clearly looking at the ball the whole 
time. Still, his arm — which is about the size of a 5-year-old child — drags 
Watson down while he was in the air.

Penalty England.

24 min England are full of running and a few big runs takes them to 
Australia’s 22. Ford and Youngs are marshalling their forwards well.

And now we’ll pack it down for a scrum after an Australian knock-on.

That was a whirlwind of a game for the live blogger and I’m spent. Sorry I 
couldn’t get to your late flurry of emails and tweets. Don’t you hate it when 
the game gets in the way of your correspondence?

Wallabies fans will be smarting, no doubt, but I’m sure most will find 
admiration for this England side, one that came, saw and conquered. After the 
Brexit, never mind the stunning de-crowning of Miss Great Britain, this result 
will no doubt put a smile on many faces that are in desperate need of one.

I’ll leave you with Robert Kitson’s match report. Fare well, dear readers, and 
cheerio.

England complete Australia whitewash with thrilling 44-40 win in third Test

For the first time since 1971 the Wallabies have lost their first three 
matches of the calendar year. Having made the World Cup final I can’t say many 
would have expected such a flat start to 2016. But England deserve enormous 
credit. They’ve outplayed Australia comprehensively.

Tonight’s game, though free-flowing, wasn’t really a classic. There were too 
many mistakes and sloppy moments (and, possibly, points) for that. But it sure 
was entertaining.

Farrell is man of the match, by the way, and now Hartley is on the dais 
accepting the Cook Cup. He graciously thanks his hosts and praises his team for 
completing their goal of winning 3-0. “We go again, boys, we go again!”

Dylan Hartley now, beaming brightly to the point you barely notice his ears, 
which wouldn’t look out of place in an aloo gobi. “Obviously very happy with 
the tour. We can all agree it wasn’t out perfect game today but we put 
everything into it, it was our last 80 minutes of the season. I’m really proud 
of the guys. And we’ve made history.”
 
Stephen Moore: “It’s been a tough series, and you can’t give up 44 points and 
expect to win a game... We’ve got to keep belief. To England’s credit they 
deserved it. They played well and we weren’t quite good enough.”

Don’t look now, Stephen, but the All Blacks await.
 
Schalk van der Merwe, en route to Cape Town, will be delighted. “Following 
your updates ... from an Emirates flight 30 000 feet in the sky. Go ENGLAND...”

Time to celebrate. Order some more in-flight peanuts!

David Bradley puts it out there: “[This] must be one of England’s greatest 
sporting achievements ever. Not really a big rugby fan but fantastic for 
English rugby.”

Foley drags his conversion attempt left of the posts and that’s the game! A 
lazy 84 points in it and England have whitewashed the Wallabies.
 
Naiyaravoro catches it and there’s no stopping him from there, earning a 
consolation try that will offer the Wallabies no consolation at all.
 
80 min The Wallabies regain the ball after England fail to hold possession and 
a scrum is called as the final siren sounds.

Australia win the ball and move the ball to the right wing, then back towards 
the left. Foley gets himself close to the England line before Phipps picks up 
from the back of the ruck and rifles a ball to Naiyaravoro standing inside the 
left corner post.
 
Bread, butter, and jam for Farrell who puts England nine points clear! And 
that’s the game!
 
78 min From an England lineout on the Wallabies 22 England build through a 
dozen or so phases of one-out running, the kind that eats minutes on a clock. 
On phase 12 the Wallabies, desperate for the ball, are penalised when Phipps 
steps over the ruck taking out Care. It’s 35m out, right in front.
 
76 min Vunipola off for Daly as time begins to run out for the Wallabies. 
 
73 min Australia find touch on the England 22. England win the lineout and get 
rid of the ball in the manner you’d get rid of a hand grenade with the pin 
pulled out of it.

Haylett-Petty soon returns the kick. Brown kicks it back. Haylett-Petty does 
the same. Perhaps itis an unexploded hand grenade.

Australia back within a converted try. Eight minutes to go. Going on what 
we’ve seen, time for plenty more points.
 
71 min From the kickoff Australia swarm on Brown and force a loose ball. 
England dive on it but are penalised for not releasing. This is right in front 
and Foley will take the certain three points on offer.
 
That’s 21 points for Farrell tonight, his long-range penalty attempt never 
looking like missing.
 Boom! Dead-eye Owen Farrell slots another penalty between the sticks.

69 min Australia force a few passes and turn it over. They look a little 
rattled, Australia.
 
Farrell puts England out to a [counts on fingers] six point lead. 
 
Jamie George is over! What a comedy of errors in the lead-up. Phipps picked up 
a loose ball facing his own posts and passed into Folau’s boots. England 
regained possession and Itoje drove ever so close to the line before England 
recycled. Danny Care then passed left to George and the ball hit George’s knees 
and was propelled into the in-goal. George followed through to score his first 
Test try!

65 min England building momentum and find touch 15m out from the Wallabies’ 
line. Polota-Nau to take it from the spot where Moore threw straight to Robshaw 
early in the second half. No such error this time.
 
64 min England pinch the ball in midfield and they shift it left. From Ford to 
Farrell to Watson, and the winger has a sliver of daylight in front of him. 
Enough to get the crowd on its feet. But Foley pulls the blinds, bundling 
Watson into touch.
 
63 min There’s another penalty for England for Australia not rolling away. 
Nice pressure release for England, that one, as they were metres out from their 
own line.

Jonathan Dowson writes: “This game is sounding like a classic end to end Test 
match….. sadly I’m working the nightshift and it’s not on in the office.”

Not on in the office? What kind of Dickensian hellhole do you work in?
 
On the Australia 40m line Australia, at the breakdown, give away their third 
straight penalty. Farrell makes them pay.
 
Not a tough one for Foley but he makes no mistake all the same. 

This game has become so breathless that I suddenly have no time to copy in all 
these emails I begged for! Sorry!
 
That was too easy! Australia pass laterally along the England 22 with nothing 
seemingly on. But Toomua steps off his right and he brushes out of Billy 
Vunipola’s tackle. Folau looms up on his left shoulder like a sports car and he 
outpaces the cover defence to score.

57 min The Wallabies put together 11 phases, slowly working their way towards 
the England 22...

Oh, there’s a crowd of 44,065. Apparently a ground record!
 
As Farrell lines up, “Swing low, sweet chariot” floats across the ground. 
Farrell drills his kick and England retake the lead.
 
54 min England make two changes, Youngs and Robshaw off for an early shower, 
replaced by Care and Clifford.

And from a scrum on the Aussie 22 the Wallabies are penalised for not driving 
square. Farrell with the penalty attempt...
 
And Foley steers it over to level the scores. 
 
It just touched the chalk and a try is awarded! Hooper had no right to score 
that.

51 min Possible try to Australia! Phipps zips right, draws Itoje, and offloads 
to Hooper running an angled line back inside. Hooper is hit by three tacklers 
but he wiggles and wriggles and reaches out to place the tip of the ball just 
on, or just short of, the line.
 
49 min Toomua breaches the England left-side defence and then Coleman, like a 
rampaging giraffe, gallops into the England 22. Youngs brings him down and 
though the ball comes loose the first knock-on is called against England.

From 35m out and straight in front, Farrell puts England a converted try ahead.
 
47 min But he’ll get another kick in a second after the Wallabies are 
penalised for pulling down an England maul.
 
46 min Farrell misses to the right from the right touchline. He’s human. 
 
From a scrum a few metres out the Wallabies steel themselves for a shove ... 
but Vunipola catches them offguard, picks the ball up from the back of the 
scrum and scoots down the blindside to dive over despite the cover tackle of 
Hooper and Haylett-Petty!

44 min England almost score! From a Wallaby line-out on their own try line 
Stephen Moore throws it over Coleman and straight into the arms of a charging 
Robshaw. He looks certain to score but gold jerseys converge on him and, though 
he gets over the line, he’s held up!
 
42 min Coleman gets into the action, taking a ball from his fellow twin tower, 
Skelton. Slipper then burrows a little deeper before Foley attempts a cheeky 
midfield grubber for Hooper sprinting through the line. Nowell is on to it, 
however, and he cleans up.

An England kick then hits the overhead wires, I presume the ones the overhead 
camera runs along. Not an internet wire that a dodgy electrician installed.
 
41 min Here we go, Foley gets us going ... 40 mins remaining in this already 
successful England tour.

And Coleman is on for the Wallabies. 
 
An email! Lee Garnham is wishing he/she was watching this game, but she’s 
settling for this MBM. Good to have you aboard, Lee.
 
Enjoying the game, people? Drop me a line. Haven’t heard a peep tonight. Is 
that email address up to the job, I wonder. Try this one:

Phew, quite a bit of to and fro don’t you think? It’s certainly more open than 
the first and second Tests. Anyone’s game.

And with the last action of the half, Foley gives Australia the most slender 
of leads.

40 min Australia push into England’s half through Skelton, Folau and Slipper 
as the siren goes. McMahon finds half a yard, Haylett-Petty finds 10 more on 
the right wing. Then a cross-field kick is aimed for Folau who out jumps Nowell 
a few metres out from England’s line — but as he falls to earth the ball is 
dislodged and lost. Had he stayed on his feet he would have taken some stopping.

But we’re going back for an off-side penalty and Foley will kick from 20m out, 
five metres to the right of the posts.
 
38 min A nice touch finder by Ford takes play from the England 22 to 35m out 
from the Aussie line.

After winning the lineout Australia sweep left but Vunipola pilfers the ball 
like a bully pinching sweets! England settle through six phases but then, on 
the edge of the Wallabies’ 22, Youngs throws a suspect short ball that makes 
the crowd groan. Yes, says the referee, it was forward.
 
37 min Fardy bumps and grinds over the England 22 but an Itoje knee knocks the 
ball out of Foley’s hands at the back of a ruck and a knock-on is called.
 
36 min The Wallabies have the ball in hand again and a chip over the top is 
caught by Billy Vunipola. Just as well, too, as Folau was bearing down on it.
 
34 min Foley’s kick from 35m out shaves the outside of the left upright. 
Australia never seem to have the quality of goal-kicker that the northern 
hemisphere nations seem to routinely possess. That’s five dropped points for 
the Wallabies tonight through missed kicks.
 
33 min It’s end to end stuff here... now the Wallabies are awarded a kickable 
penalty from a late Cole tackle on Foley.
 
From the left touchline, Farrell nails it. Too good, that man.
 
... and he drags two tacklers over the line! Great try! And Brown gets up 
after scoring with a look of part joy, part anger. Janger?

29 min Youngs dances through a weak tackle and is suddenly in space within the 
Australia 22, but the space closes much faster than that garbage compacter in 
Star Wars.

But moments later, Youngs takes play down the blind side, Watson kicks inside 
off the outside of his right boot and Mike Brown catches a room service 
bounce...
 
28 min From the kickoff Skelton takes out Anthony Watson as the England winger 
leaps to catch the re-start. It looks bad, and he did take him out in the air, 
but after a replay you can see Skelton is clearly looking at the ball the whole 
time. Still, his arm — which is about the size of a 5-year-old child — drags 
Watson down while he was in the air.

Penalty England.
 
From 20m out, Foley, facing his own face on the giant screen, drills it 
straight and true.
 
27 min Australia march down the other end and are awarded a penalty of their 
own straight from the kick-off when England fail to release the ball.
 
And over it goes.
 
24 min Australia’s scrum caves in and England are awarded a penalty that 
Farrell could throw over with his eyes closed. He resists the temptation, 
however...
 
24 min England are full of running and a few big runs takes them to 
Australia’s 22. Ford and Youngs are marshalling their forwards well.

And now we’ll pack it down for a scrum after an Australian knock-on.
