The Wigan manager, Roberto Martínez, has confirmed that the midfielder Modeste 
Mbami, who has been on trial with thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> side, will not be joining 
the club permanently after the two parties failed to agree an acceptable deal.

The 26-year-old Cameroon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cameroon> 
international, who is a free agent after the expiry of his contract with 
Marseille, has spent the last fortnight with the Latics.

Wigan were only prepared to offer a short-term contract and Mbami was looking 
for a longer deal.

It is believed the Spanish Primera Division side Almería are now lining up a 
move for the former Paris Saint-Germain player.
