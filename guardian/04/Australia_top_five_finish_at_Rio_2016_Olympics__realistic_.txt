Olympic team chef de mission Kitty Chiller insists a top-five finish is a 
realistic goal for Australia at the 2016 Games despite only coming 10th in 
London two years ago.

Chiller outlined some of the AOC goals for Rio at a press conference in Sydney 
to mark two years until the start of the 2016 Games. She said Australia would 
get a better idea of where it stands after the next couple of months, with 
world championships or major international events scheduled in several sports 
including sailing, triathlon, swimming, rowing and basketball.

“We’ve been looking at benchmark events for the last year and at the moment 
we’re sitting seventh in the benchmark events,” Chiller told reporters. “In the 
next two months, there’s a lot of world championships coming up that are really 
going to give us a very good indication of where we are sitting.

“I think it is realistic. I wouldn’t set a goal and put the expectations on 
our athletes in our team if I didn’t think it was a realistic goal.”

Chiller anticipated Australia would take a team of around 476 to Brazil, 
though that number was based on qualifying teams for every event, which didn’t 
happen in London, where the men’s and women’s football teams missed out.

“That will be just shy of the biggest away team, which was 483 athletes in 
Athens in 2004,” Chiller said. “The number of course relies on several 
qualifications. We’re hoping for full qualification, especially from our team 
sports.”

 for rights across all media platforms to the 2016 and 2020 Games and the 2018 
Winter Olympics.

Six more team leaders were announced to add to the 10 selected in April, with 
notable appointments including major winner Ian Baker-Finch (golf) and former 
Wallabies five-eighth Scott Bowen (women’s rugby sevens team).
