The Abbott government is winning back Queensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> voters, a new poll 
shows.

The Coalition leads Labor by 51% to 49% on a two party preferred basis in the 
sunshine state, a Galaxy poll conducted for the Courier-Mail reveals.

It is the first time the Coalition has polled ahead of Labor in Queensland for 
a year.

However, the LNP vote is still six percentage points off the 57 per cent 
two-party result it achieved in Queensland at the last federal election.

The poll, which surveyed 800 voters, also showed that 23% thought the federal 
budget would be bad for Queensland.
