Race organisers say the 29-year-old Dutchman has had a high fever for the last 
two days.Boom had been at the centre of controversy before the start 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/04/astana-lars-boom-tour-de-france-vincenzo-nibali>
.

The Movement for Credible Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling>, 
which applies stricter anti-doping measures than cycling’s governing body or 
the World Anti-Doping Agency, said it had temporarily suspended Astana after 
pre-race tests showed Boom had an abnormally low cortisol level. Such low 
readings can indicate cortisone doping but is not conclusive proof of doping.

Boom won stage five in last year’s Tour, the same day that the 2013 Tour 
winner, Chris Froome, crashed out of the race. Astana’s Vincenzo Nibali went on 
to win the 2014 Tour.
