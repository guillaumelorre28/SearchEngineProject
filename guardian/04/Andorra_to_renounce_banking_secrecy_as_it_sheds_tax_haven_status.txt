Andorran lawmakers have agreed to end banking secrecy in the Pyrenees 
mountains principality, approving automatic sharing of information on accounts 
held by non-residents.


The General Council, Andorra’s unicameral parliament, approved a measure that 
will come into effect from January 2018 for accounts held by people from EU 
countries.

“Not approving this would have sent a very negative message to the world,” 
said the finance minister, Jordi Cinca.

“grey list” of non-cooperative tax havens drawn up as part of a crackdown on 
tax evasion after the global financial crisis.

In 2015 the Banca Privada d’Andorra (BPA), the principality’s fourth-largest 
bank, was accused by US treasury officials of taking bribes to channel profits 
and facilitate laundering of cash from Russian and Chinese organised crime as 
well as Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA.

The charge led Andorran regulators to take control of the bank, whose chief 
executive was arrested.

Automatic transfer of banking account data is becoming the international 
standard to help reduce tax evasion.

Andorra follows Monaco, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and San Marino in signing a 
deal with the EU, which wants to cut down on fraud and tax evasion via 
neighbouring countries.
