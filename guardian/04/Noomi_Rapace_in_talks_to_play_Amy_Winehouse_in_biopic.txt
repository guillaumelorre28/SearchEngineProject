According to Screen Daily 
<http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/afm/amy-winehouse-biopic-tempts-noomi-rapace/5096496.article>
, Rapace, best known for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Prometheus, is in 
early discussions for the film that has the simple working title of Amy 
Winehouse.

The script has been written by Kirsten Sheridan who is also set to direct. 
Sheridan directed the 2007 fantasy August Rush, starring Robin Williams, and 
also picked up an Oscar nomination for co-writing In America, directed by her 
father Jim Sheridan.

The film arrives soon after Asif Kapadia’s critically acclaimed and 
commercially successful documentary Amy, which took a close look at the 
singer’s life and untimely death. It also attracted controversy, with Amy’s 
father Mitch Winehouse claiming the portrayal of him as careless and 
irresponsible was“very hurtful”

.

Winehouse became a worldwide success after two chart-topping albums, but 
struggled with alcohol and drug problems before dying at the age of 27.

Rapace has been recently seen in crime drama Child 44, and will next star in 
sci-fi thriller Rupture as well as Prometheus sequel Alien: Paradise Lost. She
