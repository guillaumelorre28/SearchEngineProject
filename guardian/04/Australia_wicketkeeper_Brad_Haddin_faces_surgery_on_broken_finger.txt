The Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/brad-haddin> could miss out on the Champions 
Trophy and subsequent tour of India after it was announced he would undergo 
surgery for a broken finger later this week.

Haddin, who returned home from Australia's Ashes tour of England today, 
suffered the injury to his left hand while warming up before the start of the 
third Test at Edgbaston. He was examined by a specialist in Sydney and has 
opted to undergo surgery tomorrow.

"It has been decided that the fracture of the ring finger of the left hand, 
sustained in the Test series in England, will be best dealt with by Brad having 
surgery," theCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia 
doctor, Trefor James, said in a statement.

"Brad will undergo corrective surgery â€¦ he will therefore not be available for 
the limited-over internationals in England. His fitness for theICC Champions 
Trophy <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/iccchampionstrophy> in South Africa 
and the ODI series in India in October and November will be reviewed at a later 
date."

The Champions Trophy starts on 22 September, while Australia have a 
seven-match one-day series in India from 25 October.
