Antonio Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia>, 
Wigan Athletic's highly-coveted Ecuador winger, has probably played his last 
match for the club before a move to a major European side, the manager Steve 
Bruce has admitted.

Wigan have already had one offer from Real Madrid for the 23-year-old, but he 
has also attracted the interest of other clubs, Bruce added.

"It's inevitable that the lad will be leaving in the summer as there are clubs 
queueing up, jostling for position," he told the Wigan Evening Post.

"I won't lie to fans about that. Of course I would love to keep him, but it's 
going to be impossible for that to happen. I have only worked with the kid for 
18 months but he has got a special talent. He's a very good player."

Bruce said a hamstring injury is likely to keep Valencia out of Wigan's last 
game this season against Portsmouth on Sunday.
