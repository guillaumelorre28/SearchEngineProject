They added that it was the death

 of group member Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor earlier this year that led to them 
completing this final record. In a handwritten note,Q-Tip 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/15/q-tip-urban-music-hattie-collins>
 talked about their reunion on The Tonight Show in November 2015: “It was our 
first TV performance in 18 years. The energy for us that night was one that we 
hadn’t experienced on stage together in some time!”

Making reference to the Paris attacks, which happened that same night, he 
continued: “As we left 30 Rock, I felt the need, we all did, to get back to the 
studio … So we got to it! It was coming together nicely.”

Phife Dawg died on 22 March 2016, but Q-Tip said he left them with the 
“blueprint” of what the group needed to do. LA Reid, the CEO of Epic Records
previously claimed

 the material, which will be released on 11 November 2016, is “something 
special.”
