Editorial staff were evidently shocked by the announcement, which comes little 
more than a month after the paper celebrated its 140th anniversary.

According to the report, some people have been told by mangers they will lose 
their jobs. The paper is majority-owned by Indalo Media,part of a diverse group 
<https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Indalo> run by Cristóbal López.

In March, the Herald’s Spanish-language rival, Clarín, claimed the Herald was 
losing about AR$2m (£108,000) a month

.

Founded in 1876, it originally served the large number of English-speaking 
people who arrived in Buenos Aires during an immigration boom.


It is best remembered for ignoring censorship during the brutal 1976-83 
dictatorship by reporting on the government’s abductions of people, later known 
as “the disappeared”.

The Herald’s then editor, Robert Cox 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cox_(journalist)>, was forced into exile 
with his family because of threats and intimidation. His heroism wasfinally 
recognised in 2010

 when he received honorary citizenship.

The switch to weekly format is due to start with the 4 November issue, 
according to the report in The Bubble, the digital news outlet. It did not 
obtain any comment from Indalo Media or the paper’s editor-in-chief, Sebastián 
Lacunza.
