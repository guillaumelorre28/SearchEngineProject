Arcade Fire’s Will Butler is working on solo material for a potential album. 
The multi-instrumentalist brother of frontman Win Butler performed a full set 
in Brooklyn ahead of a possible LP release next year.


According to the website for Brooklyn’s Baby’s All Right concert venue 
<http://babysallright.ticketfly.com/event/719477-will-butler-arcade-fire-brooklyn/>
: “He’s currently finishing up his debut album.” At the subsequent gig, Butler 
played 10 songs of garage-y pop reminiscent of the Strokes, the Pixies and 
Richard Hell and the Voidoids. These included aloopy blues called Surrender

melancholy piano track calledSun Comes Up 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDTA2MSSm20>. 

A spokesperson for Arcade Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> 
confirmed the news: “[Win]’s working on tracks for release at some point in the 
future, maybe on [the band’s US label] Merge Records, and he keeps updating on 
their socials.”

According to ArcadeFireTube <https://www.facebook.com/ArcadeFireTube?fref=nf>, 
Butler played guitar and synth at the show, accompanied by two female back-up 
singers. The sameArcade Fire fansite also reports 
<https://twitter.com/ArcadeFiretube/status/531552427947081728> that there are 
“pretty strong indications” Butler’s solo debut will be released on Merge. But 
“nothing [is] confirmed”, andButler himself said that “God only knows” 
<https://twitter.com/ArcadeFiretube/status/532698974629933056> when the record 
will be released.

Although the elder Butler brother, Win, and his wife Régine Chassagne, are 
Arcade Fire’s principal songwriters, Will has been a leader on recent projects 
like the band’s soundtrack for the Spike Jonze film Her, composed with musician 
Owen Pallett. Will, whostudied poetry at university
