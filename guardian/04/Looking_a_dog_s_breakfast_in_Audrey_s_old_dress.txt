Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/breakfast-at-tiffany-s> (1961), wearing the 
dress auctioned at Christie's today.

Fashion is all about context. A woman in a frumpy floral dress, brown shoes 
and swinging about an oversized leather bag is working aMitford look 
<http://www.zoozoom.com/preview/preview.aspx?storyID=123>, even if she actually 
looks like a teacher from Grange Hill, circa late 80s.

Meanwhile a young man in a button down shirt, light trousers and jumper 
affixed about his neck is going forBurberry's Merchant Ivory look 
<http://www.burberry.com/HomeUK.aspx>, although he might well be Nigel Havers 
in his natural garb. You might want to make that distinction before passing 
comment.

So when considering who should buy the Givenchy dress worn by Audrey Hepburn 
in Breakfast at Tiffany's

 - auctioned at Christie's today and expected to fetch up to Â£70,000 - one 
needs to consider the context in which it was worn. Yes, yes, this dress has 
been cited as that much vaunted concept - "fashion inspiration" - by style 
aspirants, and, yes, it is a very pretty dress. But I feel that the context in 
which it was worn has been forgotten.

We see Holly wearing it as she emerges from a taxi 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YZLdg3pNM> at the break of dawn, chewing on a 
takeaway croissant and gazing dumbly in the Tiffany's window. In short, she 
hasn't been home from the night before, the filthy stop-out, and has no doubt 
fled from wherever she did lay her head last night, grabbed some necessary 
carbs to soak up the toxins and shame and is now wandering the streets lost in 
a fug of self-loathing.

It is an often forgotten fact, not least because the movie attempted to gloss 
it over, that in the book Holly is quite clearly some kind of working lady in 
the old, euphemistic sense of the term. So let's get this straight again - a 
dress worn by an escort girl for a night out.

Well, lots of people come to mind about who should wear the dress in the sense 
they are famous for no other reason than for whom they sleep with, none of whom 
shall libellously be mentioned here. But just for sheer contrast value, here 
are a few people I'd quite like to see in it.

Ann Widdecombe

, for example, has been looking increasingly hot since her new blond ambition 
makeover. Meanwhile Kirsty Wark is alwaysfond of getting out a posh frock 
<http://www.baftascotland.co.uk/images/DSC_0103.JPG> and I reckon this one 
would work a treat when discussing the fine semantic points of Borat with Rod 
Liddle onNewsnight Review 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/default.stm>.

Ultimately, though, the obvious choice is the morally lax female icon of 
today. Yes, it'sVicky Pollard <http://www.littlebritain.tv/characters_vicky.htm>
 we're talking. Admittedly, the dress will have to be taken out a bit, perhaps, 
but fashion, asHubert Givenchy 
<http://www.infomat.com/whoswho/hubertdegivenchy.html> (possibly) said at some 
point, must move with the times.
