Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> closed to within a 
point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga after an emphatic, if not always 
totally convincing, 4-1 victory over Almería in Sunday's late kick-off at Camp 
Nou.

Alexis Sánchez set the hosts on their way in the 10th minute before a superb 
Lionel Messi free-kick made it 2-0 inside 25 minutes and seemingly set Barça on 
their way to a routine win.

However, a moment's sloppiness in the Barça defence allowed Angel Trujillo to 
pull one back for Almería three minutes later and at 2-1 Barcelona endured 
several nervy moments as the visitors probed for an equaliser either side of 
the break.

It took until the 83rd minute for Barcelona to put the contest to bed, Carles 
Puyol following up with a smart finish after Messi's header had come back off 
the crossbar.

Xavi then put some gloss on the scoreline with a sumptuous fourth as 
Barcelona's win saw them go into second place, two points ahead of Atlético and 
one behind Real with 12 games remaining.
