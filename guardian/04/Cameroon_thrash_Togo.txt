Reigning champions Cameroon completed a 100% success rate from their three 
group matches today with a 3-0 humbling of Togo.

After a goalless first half, the 'Indomitable Lions' went ahead in the 51st 
minute through Lucien Mettomo before two late goals wrapped up victory.

Real Mallorca striker Samuel Eto'o slotted the second into an open goal after 
82 minutes, after unselfish work by strike partner Patrick Mboma, and Salomon 
Olembe fired home the third two minutes from time.

In the other Group 3 match played today, The Democratic Republic of Congo 
claimed the second qualifying spot behind Cameroon with a 3-1 win over Ivory 
Coast.

Muzinga Yuvuladao gave Congo a lead after 28 minutes which Monaco's Shabani 
Nonda doubled after 66 minutes.

Papy Kimoto's penalty in the 79th minute secured a quarter-final place. Ivory 
Coast claimed a last-minute consolation through Kandia Traore.
