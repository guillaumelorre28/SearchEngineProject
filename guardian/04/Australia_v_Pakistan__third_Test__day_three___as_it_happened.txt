The day in brief

It rained all morning at the SCG, putting a bit of a dampener on Jane McGrath 
Day, but once play was possible after lunch it was the Younus Khan show. The 
Pakistani batting hero ended the day undefeated on 136 from 279 deliveries – 
his 34th Test century and first on Australian soil. It was a knock of sheer 
class as wickets tumbled around him. The only black mark was his role in the 
run-out of Azhar Ali, whose 71 was the only other significant contribution.

For Australia, Nathan Lyon finished the day with 3-98 from 27 overs of superb 
off-spin, while Mitchell Starc (1-65 off 21) and Josh Hazlewood (2-53 off 25) 
were never less than impressive. The negatives for Australia were the loss of 
Matt Renshaw to suspected concussion after he ducked into a sweep shot at short 
leg and copped a heavy blow to the head (he was wearing a helmet at the time 
but it’s clearly shaken him up) and a stomach bug for Matthew Wade, who handed 
the gloves to Peter Handscomb two overs into play.

All things being equal, Australia will press on for another victory in this 
Test. Younus stood in the way today, but they look good to heap more pain on 
the tourists with the bat tomorrow, then stick them back in by the end of the 
day. We’ll be here to take you through every over of it. Until then, thank you 
to Adam Collins for his contributions this morning and all of you readers for 
your wonderful emails, poems, insults and sub-keeper nominations. We loved the 
lot of them.

Stumps on day three - Pakistan are in trouble

95th over: Pakistan 271-8 (Younus 136, Yasir 5)

And that is it for day three. Yasir sees off the final delivery from Steve 
O’Keefe but his side are in real trouble, still well short of the follow-on 
mark and staring at another big loss to end the series. On a day dominated by 
rain, and bowlers, Younus Khan scored his 34th Test century and first in 
Australia to be Pakistan’s shining light. He’s simply a legend of the game.

94th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Younus 135, Yasir 5)

Yasir is the new man at the crease for Pakistan and he’s immediately encircled 
by close-in fielders, but does the typically, brilliantly Yasir thing and clubs 
a cross-batted swipe high over mid-on for a boundary off his first ball faced. 
What a genius. A single follows, but he’s hobbling down the pitch in obvious 
discomfort from his hamstring strain. “He’s a happy cricketer, isn’t he?” says 
Bill Lawry, and not for the first time today he’s spot on. As that’s happening 
we see Matt Renshaw taking a rest in the sheds. Hopefully he’ll be back bigger 
and better tomorrow after that nasty blow to the head at short leg.

WICKET! Wahab b Lyon 8 (Pakistan 264-8)

Lyon strikes with a huge off-break! Hooley dooley, that was a gem of a ball 
from the off-spinner, who pitches it a foot outside off stump and rips it back 
to remove Wahab. The tailender didn’t know what hit him there. A classic, 
hugely gratifying wicket from Lyon, who is now getting just rewards for a 
superb day off bowling.

93rd over: Pakistan 264-7 (Younus 134, Wahab 8)

Am I the only one in a slightly hallucinatory state at this point? 6:40pm is 
very late for Test cricket. In that light, Younus Khan’s powers of 
concentration are something to behold. He’s almost grown a beard in this 
innings. I already had one, but I think it’s grown a bit.

92nd over: Pakistan 263-7 (Younus 134, Wahab 7)

Again Younus is flirting with danger in this over, but he’s also gone steady 
with excellence for most of the day, so let’s not be too harsh on him. He 
sweeps perilously off the bowling of Lyon, but survives a scare or two to deny 
the spinner.

91st over: Pakistan 261-7 (Younus 132, Wahab 7)

I won’t lie folks, this day is really dragging on now. Josh Hazlewood returns 
for another burst but there’s something a little lethargic about it. Can 
someone email me another sub-keeper? My fingers are getting sore. Another 
reminder that we live in a country where there are two televised cricket games 
on at once. Another half-hour at the SCG and we can all knock off to Big Bash 
and Chill:

90th over: Pakistan 260-7 (Younus 131, Wahab 7)

This is getting really silly now. After a one-over spell, O’Keefe is gone and 
Lyon is back. OK. Weirder, Wahab swats at one of the deliveries in this over 
and appears to hit it twice, though through inattention or perhaps diplomacy, 
Australia don’t appeal. Next ball Wahab clumps one over the fence at deep 
mid-wicket. He’s here for a good time, not a long time. There’s a bit of fun as 
a man attempting to catch that Wahab blow topples over the seat in front and 
reveals his underwear, whose waistband reads: “THURSDAY”. He missed the catch 
but he’s nailed his selection of jocks.
 Nathan Lyon could have done with more luck today. Photograph: Mark

89th over: Pakistan 252-7 (Younus 130, Wahab 0)

I guess he might be straining for pace now but Starc errs to the leg side at 
the start of this over and Younus helps it around the corner for four, then 
clips a couple through mid-wicket. We’ll have six overs after this one, so 
Australia at least won’t contend with the headache of what they do without Matt 
Renshaw, who is off the field being checked following another blow to the head 
when he was fielding at short leg. P.S. Nathan Lyon wasn’t just changing ends.

88th over: Pakistan 246-7 (Younus 124, Wahab 0)

The definition of surprise: Nathan Lyon’s early appearance in the last over to 
take that wicket. The definition of incredulity: Nathan Lyon being replaced by 
Steve O’Keefe to bowl this over. I suppose they might be changing ends, but if 
not, Lyon has every right to be miffed with Steve Smith’s call. The right-arm 
spinner has bowled like a dream today. 2-82 from 24 overs doesn’t reflect how 
good he’s been.

87th over: Pakistan 245-7 (Younus 123, Wahab 0)

This has been a devilish spell from Mitchell Starc and he continues sending 
them past the outside edge of Younus, who eventually gets off strike with a 
single. Pakistan are 293 runs behind and also 90-odd behind the follow-on 
target.

86th over: Pakistan 244-7 (Younus 122, Wahab 0)

Wahab is the new man for Pakistan and he does the team thing to start, 
defending the last delivery of the Lyon over. Meanwhile, the sub-keepers 
continue to roll in, this one involving the last one for bonus Mike Veletta 
points.

WICKET! Amir c Warner b Lyon 4 (Pakistan 244-7

Amir holes out! Boy oh boy that was ordinary cricket. Smith brings Lyon back 
into the attack and it works a treat. Amir bizarrely survives and LBW chance 
when the Australians don’t appeal, but then cracks a drive straight to David 
Warner at mid-off. Just dismal stuff from a talented player. He won’t want to 
watch that replay.

85th over: Pakistan 244-6 (Younus 122, Amir 4)

Just to update readers who were away earlier, Peter Handscomb is keeping 
wicket for Australia because Matthew Wade left the field with a stomach ailment 
after the second over of play. He’s gone straight to the team hotel to rest and 
honestly didn’t look too crash hot in the brief spell he had on the ground. 
Handscomb has done the fill-in job with credit. He has kept for Victoria in 
Shield cricket, but not for a couple of years. Right now he’s taking plenty of 
away-duckers from Mitchell Starc, who is making the new ball talk. Even Younus, 
240-odd deliveries into this century, cannot lay bat on him in this maiden.
 It really has been a big day for Bill Lawry fans. Photograph: Ryan Pierse -

84th over: Pakistan 244-6 (Younus 122, Amir 4)

Wondering what you’ll do with that cash burning a hole in your pocket now that 
you’ve secured an interest-free loan for that 75” OLED TV? Wonder no more and 
nab yourself the official, “limited edition” bat honouring the feat. They’ve 
somehow roped Sir Donald Bradman in too, though I’m assuming the great man 
wasn’t able to sign any himself. More on that if he has. It’d be the story of 
the day.

83rd over: Pakistan 241-6 (Younus 121, Amir 2)

Mohammad Amir is the new man for Pakistan and he gets off the mark with two 
runs through square leg when Starc strays onto his pads. Peter Handscomb does a 
power of work to reel in a wide one a few balls later, acrobatically tumbling 
to stop a ball that might have raced to the fine leg boundary.

WICKET! Sarfraz c sub (Bird) b Starc 18 (Pakistan 239-6)

Starc strikes! And again it’s sub-fielder Jackson Bird with the catch. Sarfraz 
has a little width to work with and drives hard towards cover, but it flies off 
a thick outside edge and Bird drops a little at the knees to snare it above his 
head. Superb catch. A promising partnership is doneski.

82nd over: Pakistan 239-5 (Younus 121, Sarfraz 18)

Josh Hazlewood is back into the attack to pair with Starc and a two to Younus 
makes this partnership with 42 from 53 deliveries, and Steve Smith is probably 
starting to get a little tetchy about that. There’s a decent LBW shout against 
Younus to end the over but nothing’s doing.

81st over: Pakistan 236-5 (Younus 119, Sarfraz 17)

Australia take the new ball here and Mitchell Starc gets first go at it. 
Australia have a second sub fielder on in place of Matt Renshaw. I wonder if 
it’s an Ed Cowan type situation where he’s been sitting with his mates sinking 
schooners. Starc could do with a few more mates in the slips here; Younus edges 
him through about fourth to pick up a boundary. Why do Australia have only two 
slips? Sheesh. Worse for the home side, the Younus boundary has taken a decent 
old chunk out of the ball and Starc eyes it like a disobedient pet.

80th over: Pakistan 230-5 (Younus 113, Sarfraz 17)

Lyon gets biffed around a bit to finish his spell, which is a bit of a shame 
but that’s been his lot today. Unlucky. Sarfraz is proving a bit of a pain here 
for Australia. I think I”ve mentioned it before, but he does after all possess 
a better Test batting average than Mark Waugh.

79th over: Pakistan 220-5 (Younus 112, Sarfraz 10)

Speaking of dizzy, I’ve just been knocked out for what I’d have to say is a 
contender for the best OBO email I’ve ever received. This from Daniel McDonald:

“Some stream of consciousness doggerel for your afternoon,” he says, but it’s 
far better than that. Behold:


Mao the communist cat, A big fan of the Bradbury bat,


Was asked to wicket-keep, Cos Wade’s stomach went to sleep. 

He’d not had lunch or tea, And was needed on the SCG,

So he stole food from a stocking, Pretending to be Gary Hocking.

He made it to the middle after rain, As Misbah Ul-Haq lost his brain.

He took up the thrust and parry, Purring to those around “Nice, Gary”.

As Hawke was superior to Peacock, So Mao proved better than de Kock.

How fortunate his study of Friedrich Engels, Was combined with that of Matthew 
Engel.

78th over: Pakistan 219-5 (Younus 112, Sarfraz 9)

This hasn’t ended up the spell Lyon wanted but it’s been a very good one. 
He’ll have one more over before the arrival of the new ball, so it’s closing 
time at the last chance saloon. We lost a couple of hours earlier in the day, 
but it’s been a pleasure to watch this Younus Khan century.

Another injury update: Matt Renshaw is hobbling off the ground now? Is it a 
leg injury of the blow to the head? More on that soon but as he reaches the 
sheds it definitely looks like he’s a little dazed from what was his second 
knock to the head in this Test.

77th over: Pakistan 215-5 (Younus 110, Sarfraz 7)

Clonk! Phew, Matt Renshaw is a lucky boy here. He cops a decent old blow to 
the head at short leg, ducking into a Sarfraz Ahmed pull shot. Not all that 
smart, you’d have to say. They’ve asked for a new helmet, but Renshaw appears 
to be OK. The chaotic over ends with a boundary for Sarfraz, who is having ball.

76th over: Pakistan 209-5 (Younus 110, Sarfraz 1)

Nathan Lyon has only one wicket to show for his efforts in this truncated day 
of play, but let me tell you, it’s just about the best he’s bowled all summer. 
Emblematic of his luck is a sweep from Younus in this over, which reaches the 
fence but also flirted with danger as he only just cleared Josh Hazlewood at 
backward square leg. It’s the only damage in another bright over from the

75th over: Pakistan 205-5 (Younus 106, Sarfraz 1)

Sarfraz gets in on the act now, sweeping in eye-catching style to get off the 
mark. As far as Younus goes, there’s a lovely if unintentionally revealing 
tribute from Michael Clarke, referring to the Pakistan veteran’s impending 
retirement: “He’ll be missed with statistics like that.”

Younus Khan reaches his first Test century in Australia!

74th over: Pakistan 202-5 (Younus 104, Sarfraz 0)

He’s done it! Steve Smith had no mercy here, bringing his field in to apply 
pressure to Younus, but the Pakistani champion reaches his milestone with a 
lavish sweep to the fence at deep square leg. What a masterful batsman he is. 
He shakes the hand of Sarfraz, walks a quick lap of the square acknowledging 
the crowd, then sticks his helmet back on to start again. He’s 108 runs away 
from 10,000 in Tests. Might he get there in this innings? Maybe. This one took 
him 208 deliveries, featured 11 boundaries and a six, and confirmed his class. 
Younus is that rare batsman who has a Test ton against every nation. He’s a 
superstar.

73rd over: Pakistan 197-5 (Younus 99, Sarfraz 0)

The O’Keefe over ends with one delivery to Sarfraz, but the focus will return 
to Younus in the next Lyon over. He’s one away from his first Test ton on 
Australian soil, and his 34th all up.

WICKET! Shafiq c Smith b O'Keefe 4 (Pakistan 197-5)

Shafiq goes to a superb catch from Smith! Wowsers. It looked like an lbw shout 
to start with but there was a thin inside edge before it hit the pad and Smith 
keeps his composure to dive for the catch at slip, reeling it in with one hand. 
The Pakistan pair briefly consider a review but Shafiq departs. To add to the 
drama, it looked as though Younus had reached his ton moments earlier but 
Umpire Ravi signalled byes!

72nd over: Pakistan 196-4 (Younus 99, Shafiq 4)

Crunch! Younus is taking the path of least resistance to get to this ton now. 
He skips down the track to Lyon, frees his arms and clubs a big six over long 
on to move to 98. He’s 99 with a flick to the leg side and Shafiq sees off the 
rest.

71st over: Pakistan 189-4 (Younus 92, Shafiq 4)

With the overs ticking down until Australia can take the second new ball, 
Steve O’Keefe is handed his 12th over and sets about drifting it in to the 
right-handers. He’s successful too, angling it in to Younus for a big lbw 
shout. Smith thinks about a review. “I think he hit it,” shouts the bowler, and 
replays reveal it was outside the line too. A more eventful over than perhaps 
expected.

70th over: Pakistan 186-4 (Younus 90, Shafiq 3)

Lyon continues to Shafiq, who is off the mark with a canny little late cut for 
three. Replays show that Hazlewood’s aforementioned muttering was actually a 
sustained one-way conversation with Shafiq, who did a bit of gardening as the 
Australian paceman unloaded his frustrations. Umpire Ravi just looked on a bit 
disinterested. He’s seen it all before. Lyon has a leg slip and a short leg for 
Shafiq and looks genuinely threatening with his sharp turn and bounce. A 
testing over, that one.

Today’s match report

Is right about here. See you all tomorrow.

Nathan Lyon spins Australia into strong position despite Younus Khan century
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/05/nathan-lyon-spins-australia-into-strong-position-despite-younus-khan-century> 
The day in brief

It rained all morning at the SCG, putting a bit of a dampener on Jane McGrath 
Day, but once play was possible after lunch it was the Younus Khan show. The 
Pakistani batting hero ended the day undefeated on 136 from 279 deliveries – 
his 34th Test century and first on Australian soil. It was a knock of sheer 
class as wickets tumbled around him. The only black mark was his role in the 
run-out of Azhar Ali, whose 71 was the only other significant contribution.

For Australia, Nathan Lyon finished the day with 3-98 from 27 overs of superb 
off-spin, while Mitchell Starc (1-65 off 21) and Josh Hazlewood (2-53 off 25) 
were never less than impressive. The negatives for Australia were the loss of 
Matt Renshaw to suspected concussion after he ducked into a sweep shot at short 
leg and copped a heavy blow to the head (he was wearing a helmet at the time 
but it’s clearly shaken him up) and a stomach bug for Matthew Wade, who handed 
the gloves to Peter Handscomb two overs into play.

All things being equal, Australia will press on for another victory in this 
Test. Younus stood in the way today, but they look good to heap more pain on 
the tourists with the bat tomorrow, then stick them back in by the end of the 
day. We’ll be here to take you through every over of it. Until then, thank you 
to Adam Collins for his contributions this morning and all of you readers for 
your wonderful emails, poems, insults and sub-keeper nominations. We loved the 
lot of them.
 
95th over: Pakistan 271-8 (Younus 136, Yasir 5)

And that is it for day three. Yasir sees off the final delivery from Steve 
O’Keefe but his side are in real trouble, still well short of the follow-on 
mark and staring at another big loss to end the series. On a day dominated by 
rain, and bowlers, Younus Khan scored his 34th Test century and first in 
Australia to be Pakistan’s shining light. He’s simply a legend of the game.
 
94th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Younus 135, Yasir 5)

Yasir is the new man at the crease for Pakistan and he’s immediately encircled 
by close-in fielders, but does the typically, brilliantly Yasir thing and clubs 
a cross-batted swipe high over mid-on for a boundary off his first ball faced. 
What a genius. A single follows, but he’s hobbling down the pitch in obvious 
discomfort from his hamstring strain. “He’s a happy cricketer, isn’t he?” says 
Bill Lawry, and not for the first time today he’s spot on. As that’s happening 
we see Matt Renshaw taking a rest in the sheds. Hopefully he’ll be back bigger 
and better tomorrow after that nasty blow to the head at short leg.
 
Lyon strikes with a huge off-break! Hooley dooley, that was a gem of a ball 
from the off-spinner, who pitches it a foot outside off stump and rips it back 
to remove Wahab. The tailender didn’t know what hit him there. A classic, 
hugely gratifying wicket from Lyon, who is now getting just rewards for a 
superb day off bowling.
 
93rd over: Pakistan 264-7 (Younus 134, Wahab 8)

Am I the only one in a slightly hallucinatory state at this point? 6:40pm is 
very late for Test cricket. In that light, Younus Khan’s powers of 
concentration are something to behold. He’s almost grown a beard in this 
innings. I already had one, but I think it’s grown a bit.

92nd over: Pakistan 263-7 (Younus 134, Wahab 7)

Again Younus is flirting with danger in this over, but he’s also gone steady 
with excellence for most of the day, so let’s not be too harsh on him. He 
sweeps perilously off the bowling of Lyon, but survives a scare or two to deny 
the spinner.

91st over: Pakistan 261-7 (Younus 132, Wahab 7)

I won’t lie folks, this day is really dragging on now. Josh Hazlewood returns 
for another burst but there’s something a little lethargic about it. Can 
someone email me another sub-keeper? My fingers are getting sore. Another 
reminder that we live in a country where there are two televised cricket games 
on at once. Another half-hour at the SCG and we can all knock off to Big Bash 
and Chill:

90th over: Pakistan 260-7 (Younus 131, Wahab 7)

This is getting really silly now. After a one-over spell, O’Keefe is gone and 
Lyon is back. OK. Weirder, Wahab swats at one of the deliveries in this over 
and appears to hit it twice, though through inattention or perhaps diplomacy, 
Australia don’t appeal. Next ball Wahab clumps one over the fence at deep 
mid-wicket. He’s here for a good time, not a long time. There’s a bit of fun as 
a man attempting to catch that Wahab blow topples over the seat in front and 
reveals his underwear, whose waistband reads: “THURSDAY”. He missed the catch 
but he’s nailed his selection of jocks.

Kolbe/Getty Images  
89th over: Pakistan 252-7 (Younus 130, Wahab 0)

I guess he might be straining for pace now but Starc errs to the leg side at 
the start of this over and Younus helps it around the corner for four, then 
clips a couple through mid-wicket. We’ll have six overs after this one, so 
Australia at least won’t contend with the headache of what they do without Matt 
Renshaw, who is off the field being checked following another blow to the head 
when he was fielding at short leg. P.S. Nathan Lyon wasn’t just changing ends.
 
88th over: Pakistan 246-7 (Younus 124, Wahab 0)

The definition of surprise: Nathan Lyon’s early appearance in the last over to 
take that wicket. The definition of incredulity: Nathan Lyon being replaced by 
Steve O’Keefe to bowl this over. I suppose they might be changing ends, but if 
not, Lyon has every right to be miffed with Steve Smith’s call. The right-arm 
spinner has bowled like a dream today. 2-82 from 24 overs doesn’t reflect how 
good he’s been.
 
87th over: Pakistan 245-7 (Younus 123, Wahab 0)

This has been a devilish spell from Mitchell Starc and he continues sending 
them past the outside edge of Younus, who eventually gets off strike with a 
single. Pakistan are 293 runs behind and also 90-odd behind the follow-on 
target.

86th over: Pakistan 244-7 (Younus 122, Wahab 0)

Wahab is the new man for Pakistan and he does the team thing to start, 
defending the last delivery of the Lyon over. Meanwhile, the sub-keepers 
continue to roll in, this one involving the last one for bonus Mike Veletta 
points.

Amir holes out! Boy oh boy that was ordinary cricket. Smith brings Lyon back 
into the attack and it works a treat. Amir bizarrely survives and LBW chance 
when the Australians don’t appeal, but then cracks a drive straight to David 
Warner at mid-off. Just dismal stuff from a talented player. He won’t want to 
watch that replay.

85th over: Pakistan 244-6 (Younus 122, Amir 4)

Just to update readers who were away earlier, Peter Handscomb is keeping 
wicket for Australia because Matthew Wade left the field with a stomach ailment 
after the second over of play. He’s gone straight to the team hotel to rest and 
honestly didn’t look too crash hot in the brief spell he had on the ground. 
Handscomb has done the fill-in job with credit. He has kept for Victoria in 
Shield cricket, but not for a couple of years. Right now he’s taking plenty of 
away-duckers from Mitchell Starc, who is making the new ball talk. Even Younus, 
240-odd deliveries into this century, cannot lay bat on him in this maiden.

Wondering what you’ll do with that cash burning a hole in your pocket now that 
you’ve secured an interest-free loan for that 75” OLED TV? Wonder no more and 
nab yourself the official, “limited edition” bat honouring the feat. They’ve 
somehow roped Sir Donald Bradman in too, though I’m assuming the great man 
wasn’t able to sign any himself. More on that if he has. It’d be the story of 
the day.

83rd over: Pakistan 241-6 (Younus 121, Amir 2)

Mohammad Amir is the new man for Pakistan and he gets off the mark with two 
runs through square leg when Starc strays onto his pads. Peter Handscomb does a 
power of work to reel in a wide one a few balls later, acrobatically tumbling 
to stop a ball that might have raced to the fine leg boundary.
 
Starc strikes! And again it’s sub-fielder Jackson Bird with the catch. Sarfraz 
has a little width to work with and drives hard towards cover, but it flies off 
a thick outside edge and Bird drops a little at the knees to snare it above his 
head. Superb catch. A promising partnership is doneski.
 
82nd over: Pakistan 239-5 (Younus 121, Sarfraz 18)

Josh Hazlewood is back into the attack to pair with Starc and a two to Younus 
makes this partnership with 42 from 53 deliveries, and Steve Smith is probably 
starting to get a little tetchy about that. There’s a decent LBW shout against 
Younus to end the over but nothing’s doing.

In sub-keeper news:

81st over: Pakistan 236-5 (Younus 119, Sarfraz 17)

Australia take the new ball here and Mitchell Starc gets first go at it. 
Australia have a second sub fielder on in place of Matt Renshaw. I wonder if 
it’s an Ed Cowan type situation where he’s been sitting with his mates sinking 
schooners. Starc could do with a few more mates in the slips here; Younus edges 
him through about fourth to pick up a boundary. Why do Australia have only two 
slips? Sheesh. Worse for the home side, the Younus boundary has taken a decent 
old chunk out of the ball and Starc eyes it like a disobedient pet.
 
80th over: Pakistan 230-5 (Younus 113, Sarfraz 17)

Lyon gets biffed around a bit to finish his spell, which is a bit of a shame 
but that’s been his lot today. Unlucky. Sarfraz is proving a bit of a pain here 
for Australia. I think I”ve mentioned it before, but he does after all possess 
a better Test batting average than Mark Waugh.

79th over: Pakistan 220-5 (Younus 112, Sarfraz 10)

Speaking of dizzy, I’ve just been knocked out for what I’d have to say is a 
contender for the best OBO email I’ve ever received. This from Daniel McDonald:

“Some stream of consciousness doggerel for your afternoon,” he says, but it’s 
far better than that. Behold:


Mao the communist cat, A big fan of the Bradbury bat,


Was asked to wicket-keep, Cos Wade’s stomach went to sleep. 

He’d not had lunch or tea, And was needed on the SCG,

So he stole food from a stocking, Pretending to be Gary Hocking.

He made it to the middle after rain, As Misbah Ul-Haq lost his brain.

He took up the thrust and parry, Purring to those around “Nice, Gary”.

As Hawke was superior to Peacock, So Mao proved better than de Kock.

How fortunate his study of Friedrich Engels, Was combined with that of Matthew 
Engel.
 
78th over: Pakistan 219-5 (Younus 112, Sarfraz 9)

This hasn’t ended up the spell Lyon wanted but it’s been a very good one. 
He’ll have one more over before the arrival of the new ball, so it’s closing 
time at the last chance saloon. We lost a couple of hours earlier in the day, 
but it’s been a pleasure to watch this Younus Khan century.

Another injury update: Matt Renshaw is hobbling off the ground now? Is it a 
leg injury of the blow to the head? More on that soon but as he reaches the 
sheds it definitely looks like he’s a little dazed from what was his second 
knock to the head in this Test.

77th over: Pakistan 215-5 (Younus 110, Sarfraz 7)

Clonk! Phew, Matt Renshaw is a lucky boy here. He cops a decent old blow to 
the head at short leg, ducking into a Sarfraz Ahmed pull shot. Not all that 
smart, you’d have to say. They’ve asked for a new helmet, but Renshaw appears 
to be OK. The chaotic over ends with a boundary for Sarfraz, who is having ball.

76th over: Pakistan 209-5 (Younus 110, Sarfraz 1)

Nathan Lyon has only one wicket to show for his efforts in this truncated day 
of play, but let me tell you, it’s just about the best he’s bowled all summer. 
Emblematic of his luck is a sweep from Younus in this over, which reaches the 
fence but also flirted with danger as he only just cleared Josh Hazlewood at 
backward square leg. It’s the only damage in another bright over from the 
off-spinner.
 
75th over: Pakistan 205-5 (Younus 106, Sarfraz 1)

Sarfraz gets in on the act now, sweeping in eye-catching style to get off the 
mark. As far as Younus goes, there’s a lovely if unintentionally revealing 
tribute from Michael Clarke, referring to the Pakistan veteran’s impending 
retirement: “He’ll be missed with statistics like that.”
 
74th over: Pakistan 202-5 (Younus 104, Sarfraz 0)

He’s done it! Steve Smith had no mercy here, bringing his field in to apply 
pressure to Younus, but the Pakistani champion reaches his milestone with a 
lavish sweep to the fence at deep square leg. What a masterful batsman he is. 
He shakes the hand of Sarfraz, walks a quick lap of the square acknowledging 
the crowd, then sticks his helmet back on to start again. He’s 108 runs away 
from 10,000 in Tests. Might he get there in this innings? Maybe. This one took 
him 208 deliveries, featured 11 boundaries and a six, and confirmed his class. 
Younus is that rare batsman who has a Test ton against every nation. He’s a 
superstar.

King - CA/Cricket Australia/Getty Images  
73rd over: Pakistan 197-5 (Younus 99, Sarfraz 0)

The O’Keefe over ends with one delivery to Sarfraz, but the focus will return 
to Younus in the next Lyon over. He’s one away from his first Test ton on 
Australian soil, and his 34th all up.
 
Shafiq goes to a superb catch from Smith! Wowsers. It looked like an lbw shout 
to start with but there was a thin inside edge before it hit the pad and Smith 
keeps his composure to dive for the catch at slip, reeling it in with one hand. 
The Pakistan pair briefly consider a review but Shafiq departs. To add to the 
drama, it looked as though Younus had reached his ton moments earlier but 
Umpire Ravi signalled byes!
 
72nd over: Pakistan 196-4 (Younus 99, Shafiq 4)

Crunch! Younus is taking the path of least resistance to get to this ton now. 
He skips down the track to Lyon, frees his arms and clubs a big six over long 
on to move to 98. He’s 99 with a flick to the leg side and Shafiq sees off the 
rest.
 
71st over: Pakistan 189-4 (Younus 92, Shafiq 4)

With the overs ticking down until Australia can take the second new ball, 
Steve O’Keefe is handed his 12th over and sets about drifting it in to the 
right-handers. He’s successful too, angling it in to Younus for a big lbw 
shout. Smith thinks about a review. “I think he hit it,” shouts the bowler, and 
replays reveal it was outside the line too. A more eventful over than perhaps 
expected.

West/AFP/Getty Images  
70th over: Pakistan 186-4 (Younus 90, Shafiq 3)

Lyon continues to Shafiq, who is off the mark with a canny little late cut for 
three. Replays show that Hazlewood’s aforementioned muttering was actually a 
sustained one-way conversation with Shafiq, who did a bit of gardening as the 
Australian paceman unloaded his frustrations. Umpire Ravi just looked on a bit 
disinterested. He’s seen it all before. Lyon has a leg slip and a short leg for 
Shafiq and looks genuinely threatening with his sharp turn and bounce. A 
testing over, that one.
