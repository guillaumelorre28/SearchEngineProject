Amlin <https://www.theguardian.com/business/amlin>, a syndicate at Lloyd's of 
London, the insurance market, said yesterday that first-half results would beat 
analysts' forecasts, with pre-tax profits of Â£120m.

The firm said business had been boosted by better than expected trading, 
strong investment returns and the adoption of international accounting rules. 
Charles Philipps, the chief executive, said: "The first-half performance has 
been extremely strong across all parts of the group. While much of the 
wind-storm season remains, which may affect our second-half performance, we 
look forward to a strong set of full-year results."

Analysts have been unwilling to raise full-year earnings forecasts as 
meteorologists predicted more storms than usual this year.
