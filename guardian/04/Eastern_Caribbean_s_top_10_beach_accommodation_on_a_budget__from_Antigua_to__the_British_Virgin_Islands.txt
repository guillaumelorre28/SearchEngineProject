Galley Bay Cottages, Antigua

Tucked away on a hillside in a quiet area of north-west Antigua – and a 
stone's throw from Giorgio Armani's cliffside estate – Galley Bay Cottages are 
a rare find on an island where pricey all-inclusives and super-high-end resorts 
seem to dominate. These four one- and two-bedroom cottages have great sea views 
from their wooden verandas; interiors have unfussy antiques, nautical prints 
and romantically mosquito-netted beds. Marco, the cheerful Italian manager who 
lives on site, will collect guests from the airport and direct them to a 
company that delivers hire cars to the cottages. A car is a must for exploring 
this somewhat sprawling island, and handy for picking up groceries to cook in 
the cottage kitchens – taking taxis will put a good dent in your budget.

Antigua is famous for its 365 beaches – one, the brochures say, for every day 
of the year – but the closest to the cottages, a quiet, sweeping arc of sand 
known as Galley Bay, is just a three-minute walk down the hill.  The surf can 
get a little high here, so watch the kids.

Catamaran Hotel, Antigua
 Catamaran Hotel, Antigua, Caribbean 
This small, friendly hotel is smack on the beach, on the island's buzzing 
southern coast. The 14 self-catering rooms are almost like studio apartments, 
with kitchens in the corners, and are simply and brightly furnished, with 
aircon, television and daily cleaning – even of your dirty dishes. The upstairs 
rooms have especially nice views of the marina and boats in Falmouth Harbour. 
The on-site restaurant is only open for special events and doesn't serve 
breakfast, but a short walk down the jetty is Cambusa, an Italian restaurant on 
the seafront serving freshly caught fish. The village of English Harbour, a 
magnet for the sailing set, is a few minutes' taxi ride away, and has a 
smattering of lively restaurants and bars, often full of festive crews from the 
mega-yachts nearby. The beach at the Catamaran is small, but a perfect spot to 
sit with a book and a cocktail.

Barbuda Cottages, Barbuda
 Barbuda Cottages, Barbuda, Caribbean 
The long, uninterrupted stretches of pink-tinged sand lining this island are 
among the most stunning on the planet, and much of the time there's not a soul 
on them. This cottage (the owner is planning to build more, hence the plural 
name) is a few steps from the beach, with a fantastic, sweeping view of the 
Caribbean from its elevated deck. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms make it 
comfortable for families or couples. The grocery stores in Codrington, 
Barbuda's quiet main village, are fairly limited, so guests often stock up on 
basics beforehand in Antigua, about 30 miles away (daily flights; ferry five 
days a week). There are only a few options for dining on this sleepy island, 
but one, Uncle Roddy's, is about 50m from the cottage – almost like having an 
in-house chef. Roddy's Barbuda Smash, with rum and coconut juice, manages to 
enhance the sunsets, and the restaurant's locally caught lobster or snapper are 
delicious options if you tire of the cottage's kitchen. Barbuda currently has 
three beachfront resorts – Coco Point Lodge, Lighthouse Bay Resort and North 
Beach – but they cost at least £320 a night, making the cottage a relative 
bargain. Bring repellent because the sand flies can be aggressive, especially 
after a rain shower, although the cottage owners spray the area regularly.

Guavaberry Spring Bay, Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands
 Guavaberry Spring Bay, Virgin Gorda, Caribbean 
The rocks that give so much character to the beaches of the Baths and Spring 
Bay on Virgin Gorda, the third-largest of the British Virgin Islands, run 
through the Guavaberry resort too. Great boulders, covered in bougainvillea and 
night-blooming sirius cactus, surge from the rising ground on both sides of the 
quiet road near the south of the island. In among them stand 20 cottages, each 
with kitchen, living room, barbecue and lovely outside space, and one, two or 
three bedrooms. A small central area has shop, internet, laundry, books, 
snorkelling gear and regulars who gather to shoot the breeze. But life centres 
on the delightful beach and its superb sand and sea, framed by the famous 
boulders, jumbled on one another to create nooks, sun traps and explorable 
caves. There are bars and restaurants within walking distance.

Mongoose Apartments, Tortola, British Virgin Islands
 Mongoose Apartments, British Virgin Islands, Caribbean 
Beach bars stand shoulder to shoulder for 300m on Cane Garden Bay, the 
liveliest beach on Tortola, so there is plenty of choice of loungers, 
watersports, live music and happy hours. You may want to avoid the beach on 
cruise ship day, when it heaves, but in the evening it can be your own – for 
truly spectacular views of the sun setting between Jost van Dyke and distant St 
Thomas. Mongoose Apartments are hidden in greenery just three minutes from the 
sand, with six one-bedroom apartments in a block surrounded by palms, each with 
kitchen and balcony. They're simple, comfortable, and the welcome's friendly.

The Horny Toad Guesthouse, St Maarten
 The Horny Toad guesthouse, St Maarten, Caribbean 
Here's a conundrum. How it is that one of the best beaches on an island which 
has bought determinedly into tourism has no big hotels? Presumably it's because 
the airport is too close. The result is that Simpson Bay, superb mile-long 
curve of blinding-white sand and surreal blue water, has just a few small 
places to stay, of which the most sympathetic is the unlikely named Horny Toad. 
It was once the island governor's home and inside you can still feel a sense of 
that – but it has been adapted and added to, to create eight one- and 
two-bedroom beach apartments with rattan furniture and bright floral fabrics. 
There's plenty of sand to walk, a couple of beach bars to retire to and, of 
course, superb, swimmable sea.

Auberge de Terre Neuve, St Barts

Finding somewhere inexpensive to stay in St Barts is an issue – the Auberge de 
Terre Neuve offers some of the best value out there. And it's just a short (but 
steep) walk from Flamands beach, which has magnificent waves that roll in off 
the reefs, clapping and hissing, and then racing up the sand in protruding 
fingers of surf. There is so much sand, and it's so soft, that walking along 
the beach becomes aerobic exercise. Terre Neuve is a mainly residential area 
and the nine pink and white painted apartments of the auberge stand in a line 
within a small compound. They are modern and quite simple, but have a 
kitchenette, air-con and a large balcony with views over the coast and the 
beach.

Hurricane Cove Bungalows, Nevis
 Hurricane Cove, Nevis, Caribbean 
The view from Nevis across the Narrows to St Kitts is one of the loveliest in 
the Caribbean, and Hurricane Cove has the best of it. The greens of the other 
island's mountainous spine stand out beautifully against the blues of tropical 
sea and sky. Hurricane Cove is a hillside collection of 12 self-contained 
bungalows with one, two (mainly) and three bedrooms. The wooden cottages have 
an almost alpine feel – with a bit of Caribbean gingerbread trim – and 
facilities include a laundry and a pool. But they're also a three-minute walk 
from the delightful, protected Oualie beach, with calm water, a beach bar and 
sports including scuba diving, windsurfing and mountain biking.

Lloyd's Guest House, Anguilla
 Lloyd's Guest House, Crocus Hill, Anguilla 
A West Indian home from home, this family business has been going for years, 
since before Anguilla's "revolution" in 1967, and eventual secession from St 
Kitts. Lloyds sits at the top of the hill above The Valley (Anguilla's 
diminutive capital), five minutes' walk from Crocus Bay. It's very much a 
guesthouse, with just a handful of brightly painted bedrooms around a sitting 
room and a dining room where everyone eats their Anguillian home-cooked 
breakfast together at one table. The family has another business –da'Vida 
<http://http://www.davidaanguilla.com/html/>, a bar and restaurant down on the 
beach. Crocus Bay has shallow water and is protected by steep walls of rock, so 
it is calm and a sun trap. And if you don't want to order dinner at Lloyd's, 
you can linger beyond sunset and shell out for dinner at the main restaurant, 
which has a modern twist on Caribbean fare.

Timothy Beach Resort, St Kitts

Don't confuse the two sides of Frigate Bay, St Kitts' best known beach. 
Frigate Bay North has most of the hotels, but it is also the Atlantic side, 
where the tradewinds and rollers come in off the ocean. The side to be on is 
Frigate Bay South, where the waves merely lap in the soporific heat and the 
dark sand can be so hot you can barely walk barefoot. Timothy Beach has pride 
of place just above all this – on the hillside at the corner of the bay, its 
restaurant right above the sand. Set in modern, sky-blue blocks, the 60 or so 
rooms are quite large and are decorated with Caribbean pastels on white. But of 
course you will gravitate to the beach, where the bars and watersports 
concessionaires stand shoulder to shoulder beneath the palms, humming by day 
and then heaving by night – particularly on Friday and Saturday.
