Guardian News & Media has won the Bar Council's Legal Reporting Award for the 
second year running, for two stories published on the foreign pages in October.

The stories both focused on the global campaign by UK human rights groups to 
remove legislation that criminalises homosexuality, with particular focus on 
Jamaica and the landmark case which seeked to abolish violent attacks on 
Carribean homosexuals. Both pieces were written by Owen Bowcott and Maya 
Wolfe-Robinson.
