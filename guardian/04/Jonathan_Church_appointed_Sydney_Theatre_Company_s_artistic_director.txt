It’s quite a journey from the mudflats of the English south coast to the 
sparkling waters of the southern hemisphere’s most famous harbour. But it’s a 
journey British theatre-maker Jonathan Church will be making in 2016, when he 
takes over the reins of SydneyTheatre

Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh: two decades on stage for the Sydney 
Theatre Company – in pictures

Church, 48, departing artistic director at Chichester festival theatre where 
he nurtured such theatrical hits asEnron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/23/enron-review-by-michael-billington>
, will replace writer-director Andrew Upton, who will have been at the helm of 
“the Wharf” for eight years, five of those job-sharing with his wife, actor 
Cate Blanchett.

The Australian theatre community has been waiting the best part of a year 
since Upton announced his departure to find out who would take over the top 
Sydney job, with names as varied as young Australian directorKip Williams 
<http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/theatre/features/13716/kip-williams> and 
Hollywood heavyweightKenneth Branagh 
<http://dailyreview.com.au/kenneth-branagh-to-take-over-sydney-theatre-company/27807>
 bandied about by insiders.

While a less starry appointment and one likely to rile local talent seemingly 
overlooked for the job, Church is a savvy and imaginative hire by the STC 
board, whose chairman, businessman and philanthropist David Gonski, said he was 
confident in their choice.

“We wanted to find the best person for the job today,” he told Guardian 
Australia. “We believeSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>
 Theatre Company has come of age and is able to look widely and, indeed, 
immodestly, we were thinking why people would look at us, too.”

During his decade at Chichester, Church has led one of the biggest turnarounds 
in British theatre: the transformation of a fading regional house – albeit once 
home to the fledgling National Theatre – into a commercial and critical success 
and the launchpad for countless West End and international transfers, including 
Patrick Stewart’sMacbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/sep/28/theatre3>, directed by Rupert 
Goold (now running the Almeida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/12/rupert-goold-almeida-headlong-theatre-chimerica-american-psycho>
), andThe Judas Kiss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/12/the-judas-kiss-review>, directed 
by Australia’s own Neil Armfield.

In March, Church announced 
<https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/jonathan-church-alan-finch-leave-chichester-festival-theatre/>
 his Chichester departure in 2016 to explore new projects, including developing 
his own independent production company,Jonathan Church Productions,  
<http://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/Chichesters-Jonathan-Church-to-Launch-Indie-Production-Company-20150603>
but said when he was approached by Sydney, it was too good an opportunity to 
miss.

“It’s not every day a situation of such international importance, with such an 
incredible track record and network, comes up,” he told Guardian Australia.

“Over the last three years, I’ve been spending more and more time in Australia 
and I’m deeply impressed by the acting talent, not just the established actors 
one knows about, but the drama school graduates as well as the new writers and 
directors you’ve got there.”

Church travelled to Melbourne to catch Geoffrey Rush in The Importance of 
Being Earnest in 2011, since when he has returned to tour David Suchet in 
Chichester’s production ofThe Last Confession 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/sep/25/the-last-confession-review-david-suchet-sydney>
 with Australian producers Andrew Kay and Liza McClean and to audition local 
casts for his international revival ofSingin’ in the Rain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/17/singin-in-the-rain-review>, 
which comes to Sydney and Melbourne in 2016, featuring Adam Garcia.

If these tastes signal a switch of pace for STC – more musical theatre, 
perhaps (the Upton/Blanchett years, while charmed in many ways, focused heavily 
on drama) – Church stresses that he wants to “elevate and expand” on their 
legacy, rather than reverse it.

“Very cleverly, successive Sydney managements – but particularly Andrew and 
Cate – have brought some really challenging writing into the repertoire,” he 
said. “Not many companies would doBotho Strauss’s Gross und Klein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/15/big-small-gross-klein-review> 
and, of course, that’s been supported with some great Australian work. People 
talk about the sort of actors I’ve been able to attract – and Cate and Andrew, 
too – but the real thing is using those actors to introduce people to work they 
wouldn’t expect to see.”

There will be pressure to fundraise and though Church cannot boast a Hollywood 
rolodex, he led a £22m (AUS$46m) building redevelopment at Chichester for its 
50th anniversary as only a former theatre electrician who grew up in a theatre 
family could. For someone who started out in stage management, STC’s four 
performance spaces and on-site set and costume facilities were a huge part of 
the job’s appeal, Church said.

Upton, who will reveal his final STC season in September, called Church “a 
terrific choice” for Sydney. “After a period being led by an actress and a 
writer, I think it’s important to have a theatre director once more at the 
helm,” he said.

Church himself identifies more as a producer. “I direct and I’m passionate 
about directing,” he said. “It’s the only way you can understand a company 
where you want to make work. But enabling other artists, that’s what I most 
enjoy.”

He said he is prepared for “questions” over his appointment but pointed to 
Rafael Bonachela at nearbySydney Dance Company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/11/frame-of-mind-review-sydney-dance-company>
 as a successful and popular European hire. “I’ll have to take all sorts of 
speculation until I deliver my first programme in 2016 – it’s only through the 
delivery of the work that you are judged.”


Gonski said: “For sure, we would have loved it to be an Australian and one 
day, we hope it would be again. But Jonathan was the best on the day.

“Having read his CV, I expected someone who was arrogant and proud. Jonathan 
has got a wonderful, well-contained ego and we could see right up front that he 
would be a great contributor to the company.”

Church will announce his first season in a year’s time but plans to start 
setting up home in Sydney before Christmas, to be followed by his wife and four 
children once he finishes up in Chichester. He is excited rather than daunted 
by the leap.

I think I’m going to be at home in Sydney
Jonathan Church 
“Look, I’ve spent my life moving from city to city. It’s a bigger move, 
perhaps, and it will be a big learning curve certainly. But my last move was 
from Birmingham [Repertory Company] to Chichester and two more different 
audiences and cities you’d never meet,” he said.

“The thing that brought me into theatre was both a love of the art form and a 
belief in its ability to connect with people and make communities cohesive. So 
culturally and politically, I think I’m going to be at home even if there are a 
new set of challenges.”
