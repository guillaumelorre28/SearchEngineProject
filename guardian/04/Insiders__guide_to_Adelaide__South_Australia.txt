Even when Adelaide is at its best, during the annual Adelaide Festival in 
March, it's standard for every comedian performing at a fringe event to make a 
wisecrack about the place. Adelaide doesn't have a reputation for being the 
most exciting city in Australia, so you can only be pleasantly surprised by 
what the "big small town" has to offer: immaculately kept parkland encircling 
the city centre; impressive restaurants, with local produce and wine on offer 
everywhere; and a vibrant scene of young creatives making the best of their 
home town, nicknamed Radelaide.

But what is so rad about Adelaide? We asked locals for their tips.

See a band at the Thebarton

David Sefton, director, the Adelaide Festival 
<http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au> 
For me it's a joy that I've ended up living in Adelaide. I spend a lot of time 
at the Thebarton, or the Thebbie as it's known locally. Pretty much every big 
band touring will stop here – recently it's had Portishead, Nick Cave, and the 
Pixies. This autumn will see Iggy and the Stooges, Birdy and The Kooks. It's a 
top-quality place to see bands.

The art of Hans Heysen

Max Anderson, editor, Adelaide Hills magazine
Hans Heysen (1877-1968) is arguably Australia's most famous artist, yet very 
few people visit his home, The Cedars, in the Adelaide Hills. I never tire of 
stepping into the stone studio, and seeing his work up close always takes my 
breath away. The studio and the residence make for an amazing window into the 
pastoral idyll established by Prussian émigrés in 1836. It's a quintessentially 
South Australian experience – gentle, beautiful and revealing a side to the 
nation far from beaches and barbecues.
• Heysen Road, Hahndorf, hansheysen.com.au

Coffee Branch
 Coffee Branch, Adelaide, Australia. 
Jane Howard, culture journalist
Coffee Branch serves the best coffee in Adelaide (on ice, if you need it in 
summer) and, if you get there early enough in the morning, beautiful pastries. 
The baristas always say hello and, on some days, it can seem like everyone 
there knows everyone else, the hole in the wall cafe bringing everyone that bit 
closer together.

Picnic in the Himeji garden

Chanelle Leslie, photographer
Hire one of the free city bikes (bikesa.asn.au/AdelaideCityBikes 
<http://bikesa.asn.au/AdelaideCityBikes>), pick up a picnic from our famous 
Central Market (adelaidecentralmarket.com.au 
<http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/>) and cycle to the little-known 
Adelaide-Himeji Japanese garden on South Terrace. It is a gorgeous, fenced-in 
space with water features, and just far enough from the city to be a quiet 
escape. With freshly baked bread from the market's Dough stall, some cheese 
from Say Cheese and a made-to-order juice from Zedz, it's a charming way to 
spend a couple of hours in the city.
• Himeji garden, South Terrace (uk.southaustralia.com 
<http://uk.southaustralia.com/info.aspx?id=9000712&rs=b|AU|UK>) open daily 
8am-5.30pm, free

Local wine at Udaberri


Rob Dean, owner of food truck Burger Theory (burgertheory.com 
<http://www.burgertheory.com/>) 
Udaberri is a wine and pintxos bar that opened last year in Leigh Street, in 
the city's west end. It's always packed and always awesome, and its success is 
contributing to legislation that will see more small bars open up in the city.

Taste wine at Eastend Cellars

Michael Hoffman, project manager
If you go to a winery they will obviously just try to sell you their wines. At 
Eastend Cellars they sample everything they sell, which is over 2,000 
varieties, and choose their stock on taste alone. They have bottles from all 
over the world but are particularly passionate about the local vineyards.
• 22-26 Vardon Avenue, eastendcellars.com.au <http://www.eastendcellars.com.au>

<http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au>
My daughter and I have a tradition whereby each weekend we go out for eggs 
benedict and freshly squeezed orange juice. There are some lovely cafes on East 
Terrace, particularly the Continental at number 6 (open daily 7am-4pm,
etccafe.com.au <http://www.etccafe.com.au>), a New York-style deli, and the 
more upmarket Jolleys Boathouse (1 Jolleys Lane, open Mon-Sun from noon,
jolleysboathouse.com <http://jolleysboathouse.com/>) by the river. And Rundle 
Street is fantastic for alfresco dining.

Dine at press*

Debbie Duong, food blogger (dbites.com <http://dbites.com/>)
One of my favourite places for a fantastic and casual dinner is press*. Book 
to guarantee a spot upstairs. The menu changes frequently but I recommend the 
steaks, notably ribeye to share, and the chilli crab pasta.

Catch a film at The Trak

Michael David Johns, restaurant manager
The Trak is an Adelaide institution, on the edge of Toorak Gardens, an 
affluent suburb, and shows out-there films to a diverse crowd: you'll see a guy 
with a ponytail and thongs (flip-flops) queuing next to a woman in a suit.
