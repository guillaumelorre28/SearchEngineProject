England


Alastair Cook 7/10

The captain promised more than he delivered, looking good but making only two 
fifties, yet this series was more about his leadership than his batting. That 
part was a fulfilling story of redemption, reinvention and reinvigoration

Adam Lyth 3

Spent the summer being tormented in an endless corridor of uncertainty. His 
forceful 37 at Cardiff was deceptively important, but thereafter he kept 
nicking off to both good balls and bad

Gary Ballance 5

His figures in his two Tests were modest, and they flattered him. He looked in 
awful nick before being dropped after Lord’s, though his ugly 61 at Cardiff – a 
triumph of mental strength – was extremely important

Ian Bell 5

Usually looks good even when not making runs, yet looked badly out of form 
either side of his match-winning contribution at Edgbaston. Form may be 
temporary but class is not permanent; at 33, some will wonder if his is 
deserting him

Joe Root 9

When he gets a hundred, England almost always win. Scores important runs and 
his 134 at Cardiff is among the greatest tone-setting innings in Ashes history. 
He makes runs for fun in more ways than one, but England are far too dependent 
on him

Jonny Bairstow 6

Made a brisk, uncomplicated 74 in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge but overall 
he was not as convincing as he – and lovers of county cricket – would have 
hoped after a prolific early-season spell with Yorkshire

Ben Stokes 6

At times Botham and Flintoff; at others Irani and Ealham. Will have learned 
how to turn good spells into wickets, and where the line lies between 
aggressive and reckless batting. His catch to dismiss Voges at Trent Bridge was 
the champagne moment of the series

Jos Buttler 4

Given his talent, Buttler’s batting was probably England’s biggest 
disappointment. There were many soft dismissals and he struggled against Nathan 
Lyon in particular. His keeping, though, was quietly excellent

Moeen Ali 7

His breezy cameos were vital – no lower-order batsman has ever scored more 
runs in a series against Australia – but his bowling was generally dependent on 
unforced errors. England need to establish his identity in the side

Stuart Broad 9

Best series of his career, in which he learned to stop worrying and love 
pitching the ball up. His eight for 15 at Trent Bridge confirmed his status as 
England’s greatest Aussie-basher since Botham. Face – or rather the #broadface, 
below – of series

Mark Wood 6

An instant cult hero who brought infectious exuberance and much needed 
old-ball menace – not to mention an imaginary horse – to the side. Took the 
Ashes-winning wicket in only his fifth Test

Steven Finn 7

His eight-wicket comeback at Edgbaston was the feelgood story of the series. 
There was a slight comedown after in both pace and intensity. But after being 
dropped during the victories in 2010-11 and 2013, he can feel this Ashes win 
belongs to him

Jimmy Anderson 7

In his career dotage, as he starts to lose his nip, Anderson has gone back to 
the days of Good Jimmy and Bad Jimmy. Wicketless – for the first time in 60 
Tests – at Lord’s, his six for 47 on the first day at Edgbaston turned the 
series England’s wayRob Smyth

Michael Clarke 4/10

Statistically his worst performance in a series lasting more than two Tests. 
The feet and hands weren’t as quick as they used to be but the brain’s as sharp 
as ever: cycled through his bowlers effectively and was always one step ahead 
in the field

Chris Rogers 8

The one player who really “gets” what playing in English conditions requires. 
His 11 seasons in county cricket help, of course. Finished with a hundred at 
Lord’s and a career average of 43

David Warner 7

Didn’t quite go “Kaboom” nor did he remain dormant like a World War I shell at 
the bottom of a garden in Reading. Consistent up top with five half-centuries 
but never quite took a game away from England

Steve Smith 8 

Wowed without wowing: a brace of 33s were followed by a 215 at Lord’s, which 
was followed by 58, 7, 8, 6, 5, 0 and then 143 in the dead rubber. Still oozed 
class but his wicket triggered the series-losing collapses.

Adam Voges 4

Easy to discard him on age, but with Rogers, Clarke and Haddin on the way out, 
experience in the middle order is a necessity. Didn’t do himself justice in 
familiar surroundings. Two half-centuries and little else

Mitchell Marsh 5

Not quite a coming of age series but an indication that the future is far from 
bleak. Won’t face the moving ball for a while now so the runs will come but 
it’s his bowling that has really impressed. Consistent and capable of a little 
extra when he needs it

Peter Nevill 5

Clean behind the stumps, gritty in front of them – not quite as 
counterattacking as Haddin but more than capable of batting time. We will see 
him again in 2017

Mitchell Johnson 7

The odd demonic spell reminded us that, even over here, he’s worth the fear. 
He found something in a placid Lord’s deck and got 6-80 in the match, and his 
two brutes in three balls at Edgbaston to remove Bairstow and Stokes were the 
stuff of nightmares. One fifty, too

Mitchell Starc 6

Outside off-stump, down the leg-side, unplayable yorker, down the leg-side, 
unplayable bouncer – all series long. Exciting to watch but meant Australia 
always needed control from one end when he was sending them down at the other

Josh Hazlewood 5

Sound numbers that mask what turned out to be a difficult tour for the newest 
“new Glenn McGrath”. Struggled by the end to maintain his lines and should have 
made way for Siddle at Trent Bridge, truth be told

Nathan Lyon 8 

A fine tour for a player who is finally being taken seriously. Turned the ball 
more than Moeen, operated either side of the wicket intelligently while 
confirming himself as the best fielder in the side

Brad Haddin 4

A tour too far. It is just a shame that family issues saw him sit out the 
match at Lord’s and eventually leave the tour early. He may have been dropped 
anyway, but this series really missed his mongrel

Shane Watson 4



The saddest sad clown got two lbws at Cardiff, reviewed them both 
unsuccessfully and then had the ignominy of getting out leg before against 
Northamptonshire in the final tour match

Peter Siddle 6

His stock went up when out of the side, then through the roof with his spells 
at the Kia Oval. Produced a superb ball to square up Bell and clip off-bail. By 
his own admission, poor displays in warm-up games didn’t help his cause.

Shaun Marsh 3

Probably looked good in the nets. Definitely looked good in the tour games 
with hundreds against Division Two’s Kent and Derbyshire. But scored 0 and 2 in 
his one Test at Trent Bridge
