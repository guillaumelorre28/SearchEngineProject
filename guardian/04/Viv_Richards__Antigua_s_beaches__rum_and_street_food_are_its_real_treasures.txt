You only have to look at our cricket grounds to see we are a vibrant island. 
When foreign cricket fans tour the West Indies, they have more of a party here 
than on other islands. The noise and atmosphere at the old Recreation Ground 
was legendary, as was our most famous fan, a cross-dressing local character 
called Gravy, who would get the whole crowd going by writhing and swinging from 
the rafters.

Me and a bunch of guys meet every day and “hold parliament” just behind the 
Rec. We discuss all the problems on the island and put the world to rights 
while having lunch from the street food shacks.

I love those street food shacks. You can find them everywhere, serving 
pepperpot (a one-pot slow-cooked dish), stewed fish, steamed fish, “goat water” 
(which is like a soup and can be spicy), and bull foot soup – that’s very 
potent. I love all that Caribbean cuisine. For something more fancy, I head to
Le Bistro <http://www.antigualebistro.com/> on the eastern side of the island, 
a classic French restaurant.

Antigua has 365 beaches, one for each day of the year, which I think is rather 
unique for such a small island. My favourite is Fort James, which has real 
history: the fort was built by the British in the 18th century, the old cannons 
are still in place, and there’s a great view of the surrounding harbour. And 
Pigeon Point, on the south of the island, is one of the most picturesque 
beaches you can imagine on any island.

Playing a Test in front of my home crowd at the Rec was the greatest feeling 
of my career. It was the first time I felt pressure on me to perform, because I 
wanted to do so well. And I scored the fastest-ever Test century there, in 1986 
… against England (ha!).

My old friend Ian Botham comes to visit. And no, we don’t call each other 
“sir” … he’s still Beefy to me!He loves to go big-game fishing. I have a friend 
who runs a boat and we go out from Halcyon Cove fishing for marlin – and 
anything else Ian can get to bite.

The West Indies team I played for in the 1970s and 80s was truly blessed to 
have so many brilliant individuals in one group. We had many great fast bowlers 
but the deadliest was my fellow Antiguan Andy Roberts. He put so many batsmen 
out of commission. He broke Sadiq Mohammad and David Hookes’ jaws, Majid Khan’s 
cheekbone and both Colin Cowdrey and Ian Botham lost a few teeth facing Andy. I 
was always pleased he was on my side.

When I moved to England, at 19, I had a rude awakening. I knew it would be 
chilly but when I saw leaves falling off the trees I thought someone had 
dropped a nuclear something! But I came to love the West Country and playing 
for Somerset. It was just as chilled and quiet as where I came from. It was a 
home away from home.

The sand in Barbuda, Antigua’s sister island, is actually pink and feels like 
salt between your toes. If the beaches on Antigua are good, you should see 
Barbuda. It’s a unique island – Codrington Lagoon is one of the largest lagoons 
in the world. It’s more high-end than Antigua, with boutique hotels, and a lot 
of celebrities stay there. Princess Diana used to visit the K-Club hotel every 
year to get away from the paparazzi, and Robert De Niro is going to redevelop 
and reopen the place in the next year or so.

I’m not a guy who goes to nightclubs, I prefer to hit the beach bars where you 
can enjoy a drink on the sand with a nice evening breeze. I go to Millers by 
the Sea on Fort James and OJ’s on Crabbe Hill beach, which does great seafood.

Antigua is known for its big hotels, but I urge visitors to venture out – to 
the little rum shops that produce some of the best rums in the world, try the 
spicy food, and see a different side of the island.

Some of our food is very special. Barbuda produces some of the best lobster on 
Earth, and Antigua’s black pineapple is the sweetest pineapple you’ll ever 
taste.

A secret place on Antigua that not many tourists visit is Rendezvous beach. 
The route is pretty rough and you’ll need a 4WD, but once there it’s a good 
place to relax in your birthday suit!
