The 2014 Bafta for best supporting actress has gone to Jennifer Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence> for her role in American 
Hustle.

Lawrence was unable to attend the ceremony due to filming commitments, but the 
prize was received on her behalf by the film's director, David O Russell. He 
read acceptance speech in which Lawrence thanked her fellow actors, writers and 
the director himself and celebrated the opportunity to enact "heartbreak, 
romance, rebirth, music and life".

She beat the much-fancied Lupita Nyong'o 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lupita-nyong-o>, who was nominated for her 
role in 12 Years a Slave. The award was presented by Leonardo DiCaprio who said 
he "was completely blown away" by the talent in the category.
