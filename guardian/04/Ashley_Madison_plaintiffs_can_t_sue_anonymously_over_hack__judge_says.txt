Plaintiffs leading a lawsuit against online dating website Ashley Madison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ashley-madison> over a security breach 
that exposed the personal data of customers must publicly identify themselves 
to proceed with the case, a US judge has ruled.

 Forty-two plaintiffs, seeking to represent users of the website who had their 
information compromised, had proceeded anonymously against Ashley Madison’s 
Toronto-based parent company Avid Life Media, the ruling released on 6 April 
showed.

 The plaintiffs are suing Ashley Madison, a website that facilitates 
extramarital affairs, for failing to adequately secure their information, 
marketing a “full delete removal” service that did not work, and using fake 
female accounts to lure male customers, according to the ruling.

 Their action comes after hackers who claimed to be unhappy with Avid Life’s 
business practices publicly released Ashley Madison customer data last August.

 Reuters has not independently verified the authenticity of the data, emails 
or documents.

 Judge John A Ross, of a district court in Missouri, wrote in his ruling that 
being publicly named as an Ashley Madison user amounts to more than common 
embarrassment but noted the 42 plaintiffs have special roles in the case that 
require identification.

 The plaintiffs are “class representatives” and may need to testify or offer 
evidence, unlike “class members”, those in the lawsuit who do not need to 
participate as actively, Ross wrote.

 He ruled that the plaintiffs must either identify themselves or proceed as 
class members, who can remain anonymous.

 The “class” for the collective lawsuit has not yet been certified, the ruling 
noted. There are at least 10 plaintiffs who are publicly named.

 Avid Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
