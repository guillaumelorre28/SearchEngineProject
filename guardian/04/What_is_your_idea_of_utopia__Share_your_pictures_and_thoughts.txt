Utopia. The-magical sounding term comes from the Greek οὐ (“not”) and τόπος 
(“place”) and is used to describe imagined communities or societies that appear 
to be perfect. It was first coined by Sir Thomas More from the Greek language 
in 1516, in a book that described a fictional island society in the Atlantic 
Ocean. But what does it mean today?

In celebration of 500 years since the launch of More’s book, and to coincide 
withSomerset House’s utopia fair (24-26 June) 
<http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/about/press/press-releases/utopia-2016-a-year-of-imagination-and-possibility>
, we want to get our readers to share their ideas on this topic.


What does your utopia look like? Is it rooted in nature or is it man-made? Is 
it modern or closer to More’s imaginings? What rules or laws would there be (if 
any)? Do any modern cities or communities come close to your ideal? Tell us 
about your utopia and draw it too.


Share your stories and photos and we’ll roundup the best ones on the site.
