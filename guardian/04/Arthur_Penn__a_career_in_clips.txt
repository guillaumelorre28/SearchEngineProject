Arthur Penn <https://www.theguardian.com/film/arthur-penn> cut his teeth as a 
director on the American television drama circuit of the 1950s, contributing to 
a range of the playhouse and showcase series that were a staple of the 
industry. Western stories were among the episodes he delivered and his feature 
debut was a genre piece, a version of the Billy the Kid story called The Left 
Handed Gun (1958), starring Paul Newman, also at the start of his cinema career 
after a small-screen apprenticeship. The film had hints of the broadly 
sympathetic – or at least empathetic – view of outlaw psychology that would 
mark Penn's most famous film.

For his next film, Penn drew on his stage directing experience, transferring 
to the screen the Broadway production of The Miracle Worker in which he 
directed Anne Sullivan and Patty Duke and Anne Sullivan as Helen Keller and the 
woman who teaches her to experience the world. Both won Oscars; Penn was 
nominated.

Mickey One (1965), starring Warren Beatty, drew on French New Wave stylings 
and disillusionment with McCarthyite hysteria to tell the story of a comic on 
the run from mysterious persecutors – more hints of what was to come.

The following year, The Chase saw Robert Redford's convict on the run from 
Marlon Brando's sheriff in another story of ambiguous sympathies and rotten 
society. Then in 1967, Penn brought these concerns to a head with the 
sensational Bonnie and Clyde, starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Although Penn 
only came on board after the likes of Truffaut and Godard passed on the 
project, he proved perfect for it, able to apply his experience of outlaw genre 
filmmaking while being in tune with the penetrating sense of disaffection that 
made the picture so resonant to contemporary audiences. The film's unabashed 
violence – the flipside of its unabashed sensuality – culminated ina death 
scene set a new Hollywood standard for the onscreen annihilation of leading 
characters <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5GDcs8i2ng>.

It earned Penn another Oscar nomination, as did his next feature, Alice's 
Restaurant (1969), a satirical counterculture take on Thanksgiving based on the 
song by Arlo Guthrie, who stars as himself. He followed it withLittle Big Man 
(1970) <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LB8NfxjFhk>, another unconventional 
Western in which Dustin Hoffman starred (alongside Dunaway) as a man brought up 
by Cheyennes rather than white settlers. Violence and gunplay were again put to 
satirical use.

After contributing a film to the Olympics, Penn told another chase story in 
Night Moves (1975), about a private detective hired to find a runaway (Melanie 
Griffith) but discovering more about himself. It starred Gene Hackman, whose 
breakthrough role had been in Bonnie & Clyde.

Then came The Missouri Breaks (1976), another revisionist take on the Western 
that would prove something of an overreaching project. Penn was reunited with 
Brando, playing a violent bounty hunter opposite Jack Nicholson's horse 
rustler. Atmospheric and eccentric, it had a troubled production and 
disappointing reception but has lately attracted more admirers.

Penn's directing career never really found its way back on track after that. 
Four Friends (1981) was a kind of summing-up of the Sixties, Target (1985) 
another thriller with Hackman, Dead of Winter a Hitchcockian thriller. His last 
feature (after which he completed more TV work) was Penn & Teller Get Killed, a 
big-screen outing for the revisionist magicians boasting such lines as 'Do what 
you want to the girl but leave me alone.'

If not the most illustrious conclusion to an often brilliant career, it still 
has hints of Penn's characteristic interests in violence, subversion and the 
darkest humour.
