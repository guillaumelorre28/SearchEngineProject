Casanova complex

From a male, aged 42
Dear Carole, I wonder what, evolutionarily speaking, is going on with men such 
as myself who have a long history of promiscuity but are reluctant to 
reproduce. I am 42 and I still don't want children. The idea of marriage or a 
long-term partner with children repulses me still, though sex is still very 
much on my agenda. I usually seek women who have already had children so that I 
don't feel pressure to reproduce. I accept the central premise of all your 
posts, but what's going on with me?

Carole replies:
If a male willingly reproduces he usually does so intending to do his best to 
support his child and the mother of his child. From your description it appears 
you do not want to invest your resources in others, including another who 
carries your genes. Modern contraception allows you to exercise your ancient 
sex drive while saving you from responsibility for progeny.

In general, males find short-term mating strategies more acceptable than do 
females 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V9F-4WXGVVG-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1246362915&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=5a8ec8eea4e6865dd2f73323e17270fa>
. You are not alone: there are plenty of men on the lookout for short-term 
mating opportunities. But I doubt the thought of long-term commitment and 
parenthood fills them all with repulsion.

Your repulsion at the thought of parenthood and all that goes with it may help 
you to remain as an overgrown adolescent. Without the pressures of 
responsibility you have not had demands put upon you that would have activated 
certain behavioural strategies. Thus, you have not adapted and cognitively 
matured in accordance with the demands of responsible breeding.

Narcissism in males can accompany an attractive boyishness 
<http://www.citeulike.org/article/6006846>, which on first impressions can 
appeal to females. But selfish, egocentric and immature behaviour in males will 
eventually contribute to the breakdown of a relationship.

Perhaps I should give you the benefit of the doubt and say that it is 
possible, after all that promiscuous sex, that you still haven't found a female 
good enough for you and that when you finally do the narcissism and feelings of 
repulsion will evaporate.

If you are happy and not making those single mums miserable with your cold 
repulsion of them as potential long-term mates, there's no reason for you to 
change your ways. But promises are made in bed and the fact that you have 
written to me suggests you are reflecting on your behaviour.

A word of warning: you may end up as the oldest swinger in town, which could 
be a lonely role, and by then your choice of mates will be vastly reduced.

Nostalgia trip

From a female, no age given
Dear Carole, While listening to Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits recently I was 
struck by the relevance of the lyrics of The Chain to my current relationship. 
I have just become re-engaged with an ex-flame and am totally smitten by the 
thought of it all. Yet we ended our relationship a few months back after 
agreeing that neither of us was over our exes. We then both dabbled with our 
old flames before the two of us were drawn back together under unusual 
circumstances. I hate to be the one to over-analyse a good thing but my friends 
think I'm crazy.

Carole replies:
I believe the lyrics go something like this:

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chain>

Mistrust is embedded in these lyrics. The singer is realising that if love and 
commitment are not forthcoming now they never will be, and that second chances 
shouldn't be given because promises have been broken.

You say that you are smitten by the "thought of it all" but your friends (who 
surely know you and care for you) consider you to be crazy. You and your 
partner both seem to be chained to the past and you are lovingly lost in your 
musings.

Nostalgia and remembrance for the good times motivates us all 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJB-4MNJ2W5-1&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1246353910&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=db4e6fac72e1000d6165383c0de4722a>
, but your relationship ended for a reason, and you are now wasting time by 
looking back through rose-tinted glasses. Nostalgia can raise our sense of 
wellbeing and general optimism. We can generate feelings of being securely 
attached via sentimental memories.Secure attachment is essential in primates 
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/kq528435882rw16t/>. Without it our mental 
health suffers and our status and immunity decline dramatically. Nostalgia can 
serve to keep us well and happy, but eventually reality comes a-calling.

Is it possible that if you put aside your nostalgia for a moment you will come 
to see the truth of why these lyrics are talking to you?
