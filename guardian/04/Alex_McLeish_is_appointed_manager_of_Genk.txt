Alex McLeish <https://www.theguardian.com/football/alex-mcleish> has been 
appointed coach of the Belgian club Genk on a two-year contract. The 
55-year-old Scot has not worked in football management since leaving Nottingham 
Forest by mutual consent in February 2013.

“KRC Genk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/krc-genk> is proud to present 
its new trainer – Alex McLeish,” the Belgian club posted on Facebook. “He 
signed a contract for two seasons. Welcome, Mr Alex McLeish.”

The club added on their website that the former Rangers, Scotland, Birmingham 
and Aston Villa manager would be presented to the press on Monday. Genk are 
currently ninth in the 16-team Jupiler Pro League, having collected six points 
from their five games. McLeish succeeds Emilio Ferrera, who was sacked after 
the 3-1 opening defeat by Mechelen last month.
