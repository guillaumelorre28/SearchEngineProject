Amy Schumer <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-schumer> shut down a 
sexist heckler during a standup show in Stockholm this week before having him 
removed from the arena after he repeatedly attempted to disrupt the show.

The comedian, who comes to the UK this weekend, was performing at the Swedish 
capital’s Hovet arena on Wednesday when a man interrupted her by calling out 
“Show us your tits” just minutes into her set.

In a video she posted online, the Trainwreck writer is seen to stop the show 
to call out the heckler. “OK, wait, I want the guy who just yelled ‘show us 
your tits’ to come up here,” she said. “Everybody point at him, so I know which 
one.”

Members of the audience pointed to the man, who said he was wearing a shirt 
which read: “I love pussies.”

“Now don’t get shy, what do you do for a living?” Schumer asked the man, to 
which he responded: “Sales.”


“Sales?” Schumer said. “How’s that working out? Is it going well? Because 
we’re not buying it.

“That’s really cute, but if you yell out again, you’re going to be yelling 
‘show your tits’ to people in the parking lot, because you’re going to get 
thrown out, motherfucker.

“Don’t throw him out, just look him in the eye, tell me if you’re going to see 
a scarier motherfucker than that guy … I’ll show my tits when I want to.”

When the man yelled out for a second time Schumer finally decided to have him 
removed, to which he said: “I was about to go anyway.” She replied: “We’re 
going to miss you so much. I already miss you,” before telling the audience to 
clap if they think he should be kicked out. The arena burst into applause.

Schumer has a history of confronting sexist or derogatory remarks. In January, 
she chastised a 17-year-old film critic

 after he aimed a sexist tweet at her.

 Jackson Murphy, who runs the review site Lights Camera Jackson, met Schumer 
at the Critics’ Choice awards and tweeted a picture of the pair together with 
the caption: “Spent the night with@amyschumer 
<https://twitter.com/amyschumer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
. Certainly not the first guy to write that.”

 The tweet was deleted but Schumer responded: “I get it. Cause I’m a whore? 
Glad I took a photo with you. Hi to your dad.”

Murphy later apologised claiming he thought she would “like the joke” and that 
he should leave the comedy to her in future.


In May, Schumer turned her attention to body shamers by captioning an 
Instagram photo of herself in a one-piece swimsuit: “I meant to write ‘good 
morning trolls!’ I hope you find some joy in your lives today in a human 
interaction and not just in writing unkind things to a stranger you’ve never 
met who triggers something in you that makes you feel powerless and alone. This 
is how I look. I feel happy. I think I look strong and healthy and also like 
miss trunchbull from Matilda, Kisses!”

An extract from Schumer’s new book, The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo, was 
published in the Guardian last week
