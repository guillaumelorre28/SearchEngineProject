You might be doubtful that your choice of briefs can be a catalyst for global 
change, but consider the statistics. The UK underwear market was valued at 
£4.1bn in 2009. Most of that money is spent on multinational-produced pants. 
Some are constructed from a mixture of oil-based synthetics, including nylon 
(which results in emissions of nitrous oxide, a poisonous greenhouse gas).

Received wisdom tells us that cotton, the main underwear fibre, is the type of 
natural material we need in these delicate regions. Received wisdom is wrong. 
Although cotton covers less than 1% of the earth's landmass, it soaks up 25% of 
all pesticides and herbicides. A single pair of cotton pants uses 10ml of 
pesticides.

In the past year a number of NGOs have got their knickers in a twist about 
cotton pesticide endosulfan, banned in 62 countries. It is linked to 
reproductive and developmental damage in animals and humans and is manufactured 
by pharmaceutical brand Bayer. PantsToPoverty.com, a leader in fairtrade cotton 
underwear, instigated a "pants amnesty" whereby protestors sent their worst 
pair of pants to Bayer – which quickly pledged to phase out endosulfan by the 
end of 2010.

Greenknickers.org <http://www.greenknickers.org/> offers zero-carbon pants

is a workers' co-operative in Southampton employing women who have been granted 
asylum but find it difficult to get work. They take knickers seriously (like 
Alan Greenspan, who has said he looks at sales of men's underwear to indicate 
the direction of the economy). Ethical smalls can become a big deal.
