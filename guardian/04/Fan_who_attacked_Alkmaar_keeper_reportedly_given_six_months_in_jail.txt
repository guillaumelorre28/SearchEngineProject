 during a cup match against Ajax to a six-month prison term.

The hooligan, identified under Dutch privacy laws only as Wesley van W, ran on 
to the Amsterdam Arena pitch on 21 December and tried to kick the goalkeeper 
Esteban Alvarado from behind. The Costa Rican keeper spun around and parried 
the attack before twice kicking the hooligan as he lay on the turf.

Prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison term at Thursday's trial.

A police judge at Amsterdam district court also ordered the 19-year-old to 
report to police during allAjax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax>, 
Alkmaar and Dutch national team matches for the next two years, according to 
reports.

Two months of the prison term were suspended, meaning Van W will only have to 
serve them if he commits another offence in the next two years. Calls to the 
court and prosecutors seeking confirmation of the sentence went unanswered on 
Thursday.

The match was halted after the attack with Ajax leading 1-0 after Alkmaar's 
coach, Gertjan Verbeek, ordered his players off the pitch. The match is to be 
replayed in full next month.

Esteban was sent off for kicking Van W but authorities later retracted the red 
card.
