What is it?

An app that lets you donate to charity via your mobile phone, as well as set 
up fundraising event pages on your mobile. You can automatically addGift Aid 
<http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/giving/gift-aid.htm> to your donations (if 
you are a UK taxpayer) meaning your chosen charity gets an extra boost.

Is it easy to use?

Donating is reasonably straightforward. You can search for a charity from a 
list (which is expanding quickly) and if you think you might donate regularly 
you can star it as a favourite, making it quicker to find. Donations are made 
via text, which is a little confusing as there is no prior warning of this, but 
it works smoothly enough.

If you set up a fundraising event page on the app, you can generate a QR code 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code> that people can scan to reach your 
donation page quickly, but they will have to download the fundraising app 
themselves (you can send them a QR code that will take them to the relevant app 
store, depending on what device they have).

The QR code scanner is not immediately obvious within the app itself – it's 
the icon at the top right of the screen – so this could be beefed up in future 
updates.

Is it fun?

If you were to define fun as that warm glow you get from giving to those less 
fortunate than yourself then, yes, this is a riot.

Is it pretty?

It's well designed and easily navigable. Icons, buttons and clickable areas 
are nicely rendered, while donating is easy – simply tap one of the clickable 
little hearts to donate sums of £1, £3 or £5.

Should you download it?
 Download Give On The Mobile 
Definitely. Rather than having to connect to an individual charity's website 
you can find it instantly through the app. Moreover, the Gift Aid facility 
makes it quick and easy for charities to scoop the additional 25% in relief.

The cost to charities is a token £100 a year – for that they get the potential 
to access charitable folk from the smartphone-carrying demographic, and they 
can publish news stories on the app too.

GOTM takes 3% of donations, meaning more of your cash goes to the charity of 
your choice than it would if you used a rival web-based service such as
JustGiving <http://www.justgiving.com/>, which charges up to 5%.
