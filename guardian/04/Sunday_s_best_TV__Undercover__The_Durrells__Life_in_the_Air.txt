The Durrells

8pm, ITV
A charming take on Gerald Durrell’s Corfu trilogy, adapted by Simon Nye and 
starring Keeley Hawes. A widow and her unruly brood relocate to a sunny island 
in a bid to reboot family life. The move from foggy English suburbia to 
glinting Mediterranean hills is like the lights being turned on, albeit fraught 
with new troubles. The children are splendidly spirited, the island locals 
remain on the right side of ingratiating/convivial, and Hawes holds the whole 
thing aloft on her terrifically capable shoulders. An absolute sunny delight.

Life In The Air

5pm, BBC1
Debut of a new programme by the BBC’s Natural History Unit, which is as much 
recommendation as any sane viewer should require. As the title suggests, this 
three-parter focuses on creatures that live a significant amount of their lives 
unbound by the surly bonds of Earth. This first episode examines the basic 
mechanics of animals defying gravity, whether in the flight of birds, the 
hopping of kangaroos or the leaping of caracal cats to bring down airborne 
prey. Predictably glorious viewing.Andrew Mueller

Undercover

9pm, BBC1
Riffing on revelations about how close some undercover cops get to the 
subjects of their investigations, former barrister Peter Moffat’s new drama 
once again addresses the justice system. And not just the UK justice system – 
this drama begins with a death row encounter in Louisiana. Acting as a 
transatlantic bridge is Maya (Sophie Okonedo), a lawyer seemingly on the verge 
of becoming Director of Public Prosecutions. A taut opener blessed with fine 
performances from the likes ofAdrian Lester

A Fanatic Heart: Geldof On Yeats

9pm, BBC4
To paraphrase WB Yeats, what rough beast, its hour come round at last, 
slouches towards a television studio with a book of verse? Well, take your pick 
from the likes of Shane MacGowan, Van Morrison, Colin Farrell and Noel 
Gallagher, all among those reading from the works of the iconic Irish poet in 
this exploration of his life and art. While Bob Geldof argues he was a key 
figure in Ireland’s fight for independence, Bono performs Yeats’s poem 
Politics. Tread softly, because you tread on our ears.Ali Catterall 

The Olivier Awards 2016

10.15pm, ITV
It seems funny to find a theatre awards ceremony on primetime ITV – until you 
remember the celebrity heft an event like this offers. Good as it presumably 
was, it’s unlikely we’ll be finding out if, say, George Dennis’s sound design 
for The Homecoming was triumphant. Instead, we’ll be luxuriating in the 
presence of nominees Benedict Cumberbatch (Hamlet), Nicole Kidman (Photograph 
51) and Gemma Arterton (Nell Gwynn). Genius stage perennials like Mark Rylance 
and Kenneth Cranham will also be in the running.John Robinson

Callaghan Night Presented By James Naughtie

7pm, BBC Parliament
Forty years after Jim Callaghan took over from Harold Wilson as Labour prime 
minister, James Naughtie presents a night of archive programmes remembering the 
leadership contest, Callaghan’s three bumpy years in charge, and the dramatic 
night in 1979 when his government lost a confidence motion by a single vote, 
paving the way for Margaret Thatcher. Naughtie was a Westminster newspaper 
correspondent at the time, so expect some first-hand colour.Jack Seale

Duck Quacks Don’t Echo

8pm, Sky1
Lee Mack returns for a fourth run of the celebrity panel show that’s somewhere 
between a budget QI and mythbusting show Brainiac. On hand to present their 
most meme-worthy facts to a trio of in-house scientists before putting them to 
the test are tonight’s guests Dara O Briain, Davina McCall and Jessica Hynes. 
Weirdly, the show’s title is itself a debunked theory rather than a fun bit of 
trivia – although admittedly We Share 50% Of Our DNA With A Banana wouldn’t be 
quite as catchy.Hannah J Davies

Age Of Uprising: The Legend Of Michael Kohlhaas
(Arnaud des Pallières, 2013), 10.40pm, BBC4
Mads Mikkelsen, who recently played a husband who turns to violent retribution 
when his wife is killed in the revenge western The Salvation, here plays a 
husband who turns to violent retribution when his wife is killed, this time in 
16th-century France. It’s a beautifully shot, gripping period drama, and 
Mikkelsen – resembling Jack Palance’s kid brother – is really very good at 
smouldering vengeance.Paul Howlett

 I Love You Phillip Morris

(Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, 2009), 12midnight, Channel 4
There’s an air of constant intrigue about this entertaining true-life tale. 
Jim Carrey is in fine fettle as former married cop Steve Russell who, it turns 
out, is gay, and also a brilliant conman. Finally imprisoned, he falls for Ewan 
McGregor’s quiet and tender Phillip Morris and turns all his dodgy talents to 
obtaining his release so they can live in an ill-gotten lap of luxury together. 
It’s a fascinating portrait of a complex, larger-than-life character.PH

A Prophet

(Jacques Audiard, 2009), 1am, Film4
This riveting drama from Audiard, whose Dheepan is out from Friday, tells the 
story of Tahar Rahim’s Malik, a 19-year-old French Arab who is sent to prison 
to begin a brutal education. Forced into the service of the Corsican gang 
ruling the jail, he gradually, via a messy murder, becomes the trusted 
lieutenant of gang leader Cesar (the charismatic Niels Arestrup), in a film 
that grips with total conviction and gritty authenticity.PH
