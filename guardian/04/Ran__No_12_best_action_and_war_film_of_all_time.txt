Kurosawa's last great film was made after many years in the wilderness. His 
star had fallen in Japan after a period of extraordinary artistic fertility 
ended in the mid-60s. His eyesight was failing; he'd attempted suicide. In 
1980, he returned to favour with Kagemusha, which was seen as a rehearsal for 
his long-planned adaptation of King Lear.Ran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ran> finally appeared in 1985, and in its 
portrait of a great man who has lost control of his offices of power, critics 
were quick to read the experiences of the director himself.

Appropriating Lear gave Kurosawa scope to meditate on man's diminishing 
through age, but, in so doing, he produced, at 75, a film of breath­taking 
power and scale, and one of the most visually arresting war films ever 
made. The title translates as "chaos", and this is what erupts when 
Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), the patriarch of the Ichimonji clan, attempts to 
divide his kingdom between his three sons. The youngest son, like Cordelia, 
alerts the father to his folly and is banished. Accompanied by his fool Kyoami 
(played by the Japanese pop star Pita), Hidetora stumbles from one catastrophe 
to the next, watching powerlessly as his realm burns around him. The 
silent battle scene at the centre of the film, set to Toru Takemitsu's funereal 
score, has to be seen to be believed.
