Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> kept alive their 
chances of overhauling Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league when they 
came from behind to beat Almería 2-1. Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael van der 
Vaart scored Real's goals.

Barça followed up Saturday's 2-0 victory over Real with a 3-0 home win over 
Deportivo la Coruña yesterday to move six points clear on 83 points. Real's 
dogged win in Andulacia has put the gap back to three.

Real started badly and Albert Crusat gave Almería a shock lead in the 14th 
minute at the Juegos Mediterraneos stadium. Ronaldo carved his way through the 
home defence to equalise just before the half-hour.

Real nearly went ahead through the midfielder Guti, whose low shot hit the 
post three minutes later, while Gonzalo Higuaín had an effort cleared off the 
line before Van der Vaart drove home from just outside the area, midway through 
the second half.
