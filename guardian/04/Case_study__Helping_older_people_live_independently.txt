Gill Coupland is the co-founder of Angels Housekeeping, a Leeds-based social 
enterprise that helps older people live independently. Over the past four years 
her customer base has grown from seven to 350 as the local council's social 
care budget has shrunk. With the state increasingly withdrawing care services 
from all but the most needy, and with the population ageing, she believes more 
and more people will turn to services such as hers.

But Angels is not about profit at all costs. Offering not just cleaning, but 
shopping, pension collecting and a thorough assessment of any other needs, 
Angels Housekeeping charges over-60s and disabled people Â£11.50 an hour, a 
price subsidised by the services they provide for other clients.

"Voluntary services are realising that things can't stay as they are and if 
they're going to survive, they're going to have to be more enterprising. 
There's a network of areas that social enterprise fits nicely into, things like 
healthy-eating services, getting people exercising."

Her task is to educate the public about social enterprise values. "Once they 
really understand what it means, they will be more likely to purchase services, 
in the same way people choose to buy Fairtrade."
