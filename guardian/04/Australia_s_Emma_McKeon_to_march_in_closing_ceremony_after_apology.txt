Australian swimmer Emma McKeon will take part in the Olympics closing ceremony 
after a ban was overturned.

McKeon was punished by the

 Australian Olympic Committee for failing to tell her team leader of her 
whereabouts when she did not return to the athletes’ village after a night out 
in Copacabana.

The 22-year-old was abiding by rules that forbid athletes from travelling to 
the village alone, but did not tell her manager that she was spending the night 
with Swedish swimming friends.

To clarify, I've followed AOC safety protocol in not travelling to village 
alone. My error was not texting my team manager.#noclosingforme

Josh Palmer, another Australian swimmer, also did not return to the athletes’ 
village after drinking with a friend on Tuesday night. He told officials he was 
robbed at gunpoint at an ATM the following morning.

Both were banned from participating in the closing ceremony on Sunday and 
subjected to a curfew to the village between 8pm and 8am for the rest of the 
competition.

McKeon, from Wollongong, won a gold, two silvers and a bronze medal in Rio, 
and had reportedly been a contender to bear the flag for Australia in the 
closing ceremony.

But on Thursday the AOC overturned McKeon’s ban, with Kitty Chiller, 
Australia’s chef de mission, stating that McKeon had written a letter to her 
apologising for breaching protocols.

McKeon would now be permitted to attend the swimming team’s dinner on Thursday 
night and the closing ceremony.

“She understands how she placed herself in jeopardy and all I was ever trying 
to do was protect Emma and the 420 other athletes in our team.

“Based on the content and tone of her letter and my conversation with her, I 
am satisfied that she does now understands what she has done and she is 
apologetic.”

She had not heard from Palmer.

Chiller rejected suggestion that public pressure had to do with the decision.

“It is not a capitulation towards anything,” she said.

“I am aware of the criticism from people in Australia ... They are not in Rio. 
Rio is a very different city to Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane. It is a 
dangerous city. Rio is a different city. That night could have ended in tragedy 
for Emma.”

Many of her supporters had felt the punishment was disproportional to the 
offence and had rallied against the ban on social media with the hashtag 
#LetHerDance.

I'm surprised this is not the punishment handed out by @AUSOlympicTeam

Melanie Wright, a former Australian Olympic swimmer, started a Change.org 
petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/all-australians-let-emma-mckeon-walk-in-the-olympic-closing-ceremony-the-punishment-is-too-harsh>
 calling on the AOC to let McKeon walk in the closing ceremony, arguing that 
the punishment was too harsh for her “simple mistake”.


“Please help to rectify this kneejerk overreaction.”


It had received more than 17,600 supporters by time the ban was overturned.

Wright tweeted that it was “wonderful news” to hear that McKeon had been 
reinstated.

Wonderful news to hear @emma_mckeon <https://twitter.com/emma_mckeon> 
reinstated. Thankyou AOC & Kitty. I have no doubt it was Emma's character that 
ultimately convinced them

The Labor MP for Keira in New South Wales, Ryan Park, had told the ABC 
Illawarra 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-19/rio-2016-mckeon-closing-ceremony-ban-disgraceful-supporters-say/7766216>
 McKeon’s ban was disgraceful.

“Rules are rules and common sense needs to prevail too.

“This is a woman in an environment that is not familiar, in an environment 
that we all know has had some security issues.

“She wasn’t intoxicated, she wasn’t using illicit substances, she simply by 
her own accord forgot to text her team manager to tell her where she was.

“She could have been spoken to without banning her from this Olympic ceremony.”

McKeon’s father, Ron, told ABC Illawarra that his daughter had been 
disappointed by the ban and felt the penalty was harsh.
