It has been billed as the literary comeback of the recession. But the truth is 
thatAyn Rand <https://www.theguardian.com/books/ayn-rand> has never really gone 
away. Her Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead have always had a following, and 
an A-list one at that.

Brad Pitt, Oliver Stone, Angelina Jolie, Rob Lowe, Jim Carrey, Sandra Bullock 
... even Raquel Welch has got in on the act in her declaration of the 
life-changing properties of Rand's deathless, self-important iconoclasm. In the 
popular TV series Mad Men, advertising agency boss Bert Cooper namedrops Ayn 
Rand a few times and lends a copy of Atlas Shrugged to favoured employees.

The devotion doesn't stop there. Tennis stars Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean 
King and Chris Evert, along with any number of American football and basketball 
players, are slaves to her art. Even supreme court judge Clarence Thomas and 
former president Ronald Reagan outed themselves as fans.

And you can see why, though you would put money on few of them having made it 
to the end of one of Rand's 700-page epics. It's the idea of Rand they all 
love, rather than the turgidly dull stories themselves. What Rand offers is a 
sub-Nietzschean world of supermen and superwomen, where the brightest and the 
best effortlessly trample their way to the top and where money isn't just a 
reward for getting there but a thing of beauty in itself.
