The Astana cycling team have been thrown out of the Movement for Credible 
Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> after they failed to comply 
with the association’s strict anti-doping rules at this year’s Tour de France.

“After hearing Team Astana representative Dmitriy Fofonov’s arguments, the 
board of directors of MPCC has decided to exclude TeamAstana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/astana> for non-compliance with article 9 of 
the regulations,” the MPCC said in a statement on Friday.

The Astana rider Lars Boom started the Tour in July despite showing low levels 
of cortisol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/lars-boom-tour-de-france-astana-cortisol>
 in a test on the eve of the race. Low levels of the hormone can be explained 
by the use of corticoids, anti-inflammatory drugs that are allowed out of 
competition but forbidden while racing unless a rider is granted a therapeutic 
use exemption.

MPCC applies stricter rules than the International Cycling Union and the World 
Anti-Doping Agency. Under MPCC rules, Boom should have rested for eight days 
but UCI regulations, by contrast, did not forbid him from racing.

“Although cortisol hormones are an allowed medicine when prescribed by a 
physician, the use of that medicine has frequently been abused in the history 
of sports [including in cycling] for the purpose of increasing the 
performance,” the MPCC statement added. “Besides, a low level of cortisol can 
potentially endanger the health of athletes in certain circumstances.”

Astana are the team of the Italian Vincenzo Nibali, the 2014 Tour de France 
champion, and of the current Vuelta leader Fabio Aru of Italy.
