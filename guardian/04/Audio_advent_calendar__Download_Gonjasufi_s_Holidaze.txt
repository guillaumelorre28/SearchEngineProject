This year we loved the hiss, crackle and pop of Gonjasufi's debut album, A 
Sufi and a Killer. So as part of 24 Plays of Christmas, our advent calendar 
countdown, Warp Records is giving away (just click on the little arrow symbol 
on the right of the Soundcloud widget) the brilliant track Holidaze.
Gonjasufi plays the Rhythm Factory tomorrow night (9 December) in London.
