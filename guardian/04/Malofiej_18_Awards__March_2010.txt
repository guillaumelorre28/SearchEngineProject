The Guardian was the only British newspaper to feature at the prestigious 
Malofiej18 infographic design awards in Pamplona.

The silver medal was awarded for the Guardian's 'What We Pay Them' centre 
spread. A graphic about the UK's debt mountain and the collection of wallcharts 
both took bronze awards.
