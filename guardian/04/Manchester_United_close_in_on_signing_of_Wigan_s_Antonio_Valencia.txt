Luis Antonio Valencia, the man Sir Alex Ferguson believes can take the place 
of Cristiano Ronaldo, is tonight formalising the details of his proposed 
transfer toManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>.

Valencia has travelled to Manchester to undergo his medical after United 
settled on a fee withWigan Athletic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> in the region of £16m. 
Real Madrid and Bayern Munich have also made similar bids for the 23-year-old 
but Valencia has decided to stay in England and has cut short a break in his 
native Ecuador to meet Ferguson for the first time.

United hope to announce the transfer in the next 48 hours, Valencia's arrival 
representing the first piece of rebuilding at Old Trafford since the club 
accepted Madrid's £80m offer for Ronaldo and established that Carlos Tevez 
would leave when his two-year loan arrangement expires tomorrow.

Ronaldo's transfer will officially go through on Wednesday but Madrid have 
already deposited the full amount into United's bank account and Valencia will 
be rewarded with a salary in the region of £70,000 a week, quadrupling what he 
was earning at Wigan.
