Two people rescued from the central Australia floods were found severely 
dehydrated after trekking 58km across the outback.

The 30-year-old man and 27-year-old woman were part of a group of six who went 
missing when they attempted a Christmas Day trip from the Kiwirrkurra community 
in Western Australia’s Gibson Desert.

Acting Superintendent Brendan Muldoon said it was extraordinary that they had 
managed to walk so far across the desert in two days.

“They walked a small access drive off the main road which made our efforts a 
lot more difficult in that they continued to move,” he said.

A helicopter rescued four of the six on Tuesday afternoon, after they failed 
to make the 180km trip to Kintore in theNorthern Territory

were spotted on foot almost 60km away on Wednesday and have been taken to 
Kintore medical centre to be treated for dehydration.

 near Alice Springs. The man and woman, from Hong Kong and Taiwan, managed to 
escape from the vehicle as it was washed down the Hugh River on Tuesday.

Muldoon said it was remarkable they weren’t killed and commended the “very 
courageous” officers and bystander who risked their own lives to save them.

“They’ve put themselves in harm’s way, no doubt about that, but they’ve done 
it in the belief that if they hadn’t done so those people would have most 
likely died,” he said. “It was an extremely dangerous road they have tried to 
cross in those floodwaters.”

The man was found clinging to a tree in the river and the woman was discovered 
unconscious on the shore. Police initially thought there were three people 
inside the vehicle but have since confirmed that there were only two.

About 50 people will spend at least another night in an emergency shelter 
after their houses were swamped by the floodwaters.
