Afternoon summary

 * Jeremy Corbyn has said the “vast majority” of Labour MPs should not fear 
deselection, as he prepares to strengthen members’ grip on policymaking. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-most-labour-mps-should-not-fear-deselection>
As Heather Stewart reports, Corbyn won the bitter leadership race on Saturday 
against challenger Owen Smith with 62% of the vote. He has said he will “wipe 
the slate clean” for MPs who have criticised him, but some still fear a 
backlash. Appearing on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, he was asked about 
deselection, which is being openly advocated by some of his backers, with the 
Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, saying disloyal MPs were “asking for 
it”. Corbyn saidLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs across 
the country would have to stand for selection as constituency boundaries change.
 * John McDonnell has defended describing a Conservative MP as a “stain of 
inhumanity” by arguing that it is better if politicians are honest about the 
way they feel.

Corbyn’s critics. (See 1.36pm.)

Angela Eagle condemns culture of abuse in Labour

Rajeev Syal

Angela Eagle, the former leadership candidate and minister, has accused Jeremy 
Corbyn’s supporters of allowing a culture of abuse of MPs andLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party staff which could lead to a 
form of “populist authoritarian rule”.

The Labour MP who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership before 
withdrawing from the contest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-angela-eagle>
, said that allegations of homophobia, sexism and anti-semitism are being used 
to silence those standing against the current leader.

Her contentious words came at a packed Labour First fringe meeting at Labour’s 
annual conference. A succession of speakers including Hilary Benn, Ruth Smeeth 
and Yvette Cooper promised to oppose the policies and practises of supporters 
of Corbyn just a day after the Labour leader was re-elected. Eagle said:

The people who have run the narratives in the Labour party in the last year 
have decided that the problem with the party is its MPs and the people who work 
selflessly, our Labour staff.

They have turned one part of the party against another in a huge blame game. 
We have all been subject to massive amounts of disgusting and disgraceful vile 
abuse.

I changed my photo on my Facebook page and I got 47,000 pieces of abuse from 
individual people. They are trying to drive people out of the social media 
space, drive people out of the public square, drive people out of the party.

The only way we can deal with this is to stand up to it together. We have got 
to fight for decency in our party together. We have got to fight the kind of 
homophobia that has happened in my Labour party together - which is now denied 
by the way.

We have got to fight the anti-semitism, the sexism and the abuse, the 
coarsening of political debate and the politics of grievance. That way can only 
lead to populist authoritarian rule.

Carwyn Jones says Labour must focus on 'successful pursuit of power'

Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, 
can claim to be the two most powerfulLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> politicians in the UK. They are 
the only figures with executive roles that put them in charge of multi-billion 
pound budgets.

In his speech to the conference Jones spoke in detail about what Labour is 
doing in Wales, but he also used his speech to make a wider point. Here are the 
key points.

 * Jones stressed the importance of Labour winning power. 
Conference we need to constantly remind ourselves what Labour being in 
Government actually means. That is our historic mission - that is the journey 
that Hardie started and every Labour leader since must try and advance.

 How was it that Bevan finished his great quote “the Language of priorities is 
the religion of socialism”? It was with these words: “only by the possession of 
power can you get the priorities correct” ...

This country needs the Labour party, but we don’t have a God-given right to 
exist. It is time for us to focus on the things that really matter, and as 
Bevan said, only the successful pursuit of power can truly give you that focus.

 * He said the Labour government in Wales would be bringing forward plans to 
prevent the use of agency workers to undermine strike action in the public 
sector. 
 * He said the the Labour government in Wales was both pro-business and 
pro-union. 
Conference, when we launched our programme for government, both the CBI and 
TUC could see how we had reflected their priorities.

We are not playing a zero sum game in Wales between capital and communities. 
Massive infrastructure investment will get Wales moving, it will boost our 
economy and it will bring better jobs closer to home for Welsh communities.

 * He said the Welsh government would soon investigate the changing nature of 
work. 
We don’t just want jobs, we want better jobs. And as Yvette Cooper has written 
about so passionately and persuasively, it is down to Labour to recognize the 
changing patterns of work, the challenges and opportunities of new 
technologies, and the insecurity that stalks too many working lives.

These are lessons not lost on us in Wales, and the Welsh government will 
shortly begin a deep and thorough investigation into the changing nature of 
work to make sure we keep pace with the new challenges.

 * He said the Welsh government would tomorrow launch “a new universal child 
health programme to ensure every child gets excellent, consistent health 
services across Wales”. 
 * He said Labour members had to treat each other with more respect. 
And a starting point for us must be to regain our dignity in the way we speak 
to one another and the way we speak to the world.

It wasn’t that long ago that the Party’s priority was anti-poverty policies, 
but now we’re commissioning reports on anti-Semitism in our own Party. How has 
that happened?

We have no hope of creating an open, tolerant country if we cannot first do 
the same for our own Party. If we really want to shape what post-Brexit Britain 
looks like, we have to start treating one another with respect.

In his speech to the conference Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, 
confirmed thatLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> was 
committed to bringing the railways back into public ownership.

What we have now is a government clinging to a failed model for purely 
ideological reasons, and passengers and taxpayers are being made to pay an ever 
increasing price.

We are clear about this. We’ll put an end to Britain’s rip-off railways, so as 
private contracts expire, the routes will return to public ownership so profits 
can be re-invested to improve services and hold fares down.

Because passengers, not profit, should be at the heart of Britain’s railway.

Let us have the same confidence as other countries like the Netherlands, 
Germany and France.

Labour will take back control of our railways.

They don’t write poems about David Cameron or Theresa May. But Jeremy Corbyn 
does inspire people to verse, and at the Momentum The World Transformed 
alternative conference a volume called “Poems for Jeremy Corbyn” on sale. It 
costs £10. There was even a session there today where they were read out, 
although it was not well attended.

On Sky News the Telegraph’s Michael Deacon gave viewers a flavour of what the 
volume contains.

Rachael Maskell, the shadow environment secretary, told delegates in her 
speech to the conference thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> would embrace “the circular 
economy”. She was talking about recycling.

Unlike the government, Labour will embrace the circular economy – reducing our 
consumption, recycling and generating energy from our waste, not turning it 
over to landfill. We all have our part to play in Labour’s recycling revolution.

We also have a poor relationship with food – where it comes from, what we eat, 
how much it really costs to produce, how much we need, how much we waste. A 
quarter of adults are overweight or obese, families put £470 per year of food 
straight into the bin.

We will change that relationship with education and labelling, better health 
interventions and a new food framework.

Labour would abolish 'hidden health fee' for domestic violence

Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, told the conference in his speech this 
morning thatLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> would campaign 
to get rid of fees that mean women wanting to access legal aid to help them 
divorce or separate from an abusive partner are being charged up to £125. He 
described it as a “hidden health fee”.

Women have to pay the moneyso they can receive a letter from their GP 
confirming any illness or harm has been caused by domestic violence, he said. 
He told delegates he was taking up the issue following talks with Lisa Clover, 
coordinator of the Manchester-based domestic abuse campaign, the Safe Spots 
Centre.

[Lisa] told me that women who are in the same position as she was, women who 
have tried to escape an abusive relationship, tried to get help for themselves 
and their families from our courts, are being charged £75 for a letter from 
their GP to say they’re a victim of domestic violence, so that they can access 
legal aid - sometimes even more.

Lisa told me women are coming into the Safe Spots Centre asking for help 
because they’re getting charged £125 for a letter - £125 for a piece of paper, 
a piece of paper which says ‘Yes, this woman is suffering from domestic abuse, 
yes she needs help’.

I don’t need to pass this through the national policy forum to say that a 
future Labour government will scrap this hidden health fee.

Immigrants should be forced to integrate into British life, says Umunna

Helen Pidd

Immigrants should be forced to integrate into British life to stop them 
leading “parallel lives”,Chuka Umunna told a Fabian Society fringe meeting.

The government should make clear to foreigners working and living in the UK 
that “not getting involved in the community is not an option”, theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP for Streatham in south London 
said. “There should be an expectation that you become part of the community,” 
added the former shadow business secretary.

Umunna, who was born in London to a Nigerian father and Anglo-Irish mother, 
said Labour had made a mistake by assuming that those who raise fears about 
immigration only did so through a “lack of understanding.”

He said too many Labour supporters rubbished anyone who voiced objections to 
immigration by dismissing them as “bigots and racists … who have been reading 
too much of the Daily Mail.”

Such a view, he said, was “unbelievably patronising, not just in respect of 
immigration by the way, but in respect of economic policy as well.”

He rounded on those loyalists to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who like to 
call their opponents within the Labour party “Red Tories” and “Tory-lite”. Such 
insults would do nothing to win back Tory voters, he said.

Treating them like the devil incarnate is not going to be the way you’re going 
to get them to vote for the Labour party and have a Labour government in future.

Labour should not fear patriotism, he added: 

I don’t think anyone in the Labour movement should underestimate the 
importance of us illustrating that we are as patriotic as anyone else. And 
that’s why things like your national anthem, support for the armed services and 
all these things should never, ever allow those to be the exclusive preserve of 
the Conservatives.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has said the “vast majority” of Labour MPs should not fear 
deselection, as he prepares to strengthen members’ grip on policymaking. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-most-labour-mps-should-not-fear-deselection>
As Heather Stewart reports, Corbyn won the bitter leadership race on Saturday 
against challenger Owen Smith with 62% of the vote. He has said he will “wipe 
the slate clean” for MPs who have criticised him, but some still fear a 
backlash. Appearing on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, he was asked about 
deselection, which is being openly advocated by some of his backers, with the 
Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, saying disloyal MPs were “asking for 
it”. Corbyn saidLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs across 
the country would have to stand for selection as constituency boundaries change.
 * John McDonnell has defended describing a Conservative MP as a “stain of 
inhumanity” by arguing that it is better if politicians are honest about the 
way they feel.

Angela Eagle, the former leadership candidate and minister, has accused Jeremy 
Corbyn’s supporters of allowing a culture of abuse of MPs andLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party staff which could lead to a 
form of “populist authoritarian rule”.

The Labour MP who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership before 
withdrawing from the contest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-angela-eagle>
, said that allegations of homophobia, sexism and anti-semitism are being used 
to silence those standing against the current leader.

Her contentious words came at a packed Labour First fringe meeting at Labour’s 
annual conference. A succession of speakers including Hilary Benn, Ruth Smeeth 
and Yvette Cooper promised to oppose the policies and practises of supporters 
of Corbyn just a day after the Labour leader was re-elected. Eagle said:

The people who have run the narratives in the Labour party in the last year 
have decided that the problem with the party is its MPs and the people who work 
selflessly, our Labour staff.

They have turned one part of the party against another in a huge blame game. 
We have all been subject to massive amounts of disgusting and disgraceful vile 
abuse.

I changed my photo on my Facebook page and I got 47,000 pieces of abuse from 
individual people. They are trying to drive people out of the social media 
space, drive people out of the public square, drive people out of the party.

The only way we can deal with this is to stand up to it together. We have got 
to fight for decency in our party together. We have got to fight the kind of 
homophobia that has happened in my Labour party together - which is now denied 
by the way.

We have got to fight the anti-semitism, the sexism and the abuse, the 
coarsening of political debate and the politics of grievance. That way can only 
lead to populist authoritarian rule.

Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, 
can claim to be the two most powerfulLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> politicians in the UK. They are 
the only figures with executive roles that put them in charge of multi-billion 
pound budgets.

In his speech to the conference Jones spoke in detail about what Labour is 
doing in Wales, but he also used his speech to make a wider point. Here are the 
key points.

 * Jones stressed the importance of Labour winning power. 
Conference we need to constantly remind ourselves what Labour being in 
Government actually means. That is our historic mission - that is the journey 
that Hardie started and every Labour leader since must try and advance.

 How was it that Bevan finished his great quote “the Language of priorities is 
the religion of socialism”? It was with these words: “only by the possession of 
power can you get the priorities correct” ...

This country needs the Labour party, but we don’t have a God-given right to 
exist. It is time for us to focus on the things that really matter, and as 
Bevan said, only the successful pursuit of power can truly give you that focus.

 * He said the Labour government in Wales would be bringing forward plans to 
prevent the use of agency workers to undermine strike action in the public 
sector. 
 * He said the the Labour government in Wales was both pro-business and 
pro-union. 
Conference, when we launched our programme for government, both the CBI and 
TUC could see how we had reflected their priorities.

We are not playing a zero sum game in Wales between capital and communities. 
Massive infrastructure investment will get Wales moving, it will boost our 
economy and it will bring better jobs closer to home for Welsh communities.

 * He said the Welsh government would soon investigate the changing nature of 
work. 
We don’t just want jobs, we want better jobs. And as Yvette Cooper has written 
about so passionately and persuasively, it is down to Labour to recognize the 
changing patterns of work, the challenges and opportunities of new 
technologies, and the insecurity that stalks too many working lives.

These are lessons not lost on us in Wales, and the Welsh government will 
shortly begin a deep and thorough investigation into the changing nature of 
work to make sure we keep pace with the new challenges.

 * He said the Welsh government would tomorrow launch “a new universal child 
health programme to ensure every child gets excellent, consistent health 
services across Wales”. 
 * He said Labour members had to treat each other with more respect. 
And a starting point for us must be to regain our dignity in the way we speak 
to one another and the way we speak to the world.

It wasn’t that long ago that the Party’s priority was anti-poverty policies, 
but now we’re commissioning reports on anti-Semitism in our own Party. How has 
that happened?

We have no hope of creating an open, tolerant country if we cannot first do 
the same for our own Party. If we really want to shape what post-Brexit Britain 
looks like, we have to start treating one another with respect.

In his speech to the conference Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, 
confirmed thatLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> was 
committed to bringing the railways back into public ownership.

What we have now is a government clinging to a failed model for purely 
ideological reasons, and passengers and taxpayers are being made to pay an ever 
increasing price.

We are clear about this. We’ll put an end to Britain’s rip-off railways, so as 
private contracts expire, the routes will return to public ownership so profits 
can be re-invested to improve services and hold fares down.

Because passengers, not profit, should be at the heart of Britain’s railway.

Let us have the same confidence as other countries like the Netherlands, 
Germany and France.

Labour will take back control of our railways.

Rachael Maskell, the shadow environment secretary, told delegates in her 
speech to the conference thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> would embrace “the circular 
economy”. She was talking about recycling.

Unlike the government, Labour will embrace the circular economy – reducing our 
consumption, recycling and generating energy from our waste, not turning it 
over to landfill. We all have our part to play in Labour’s recycling revolution.

We also have a poor relationship with food – where it comes from, what we eat, 
how much it really costs to produce, how much we need, how much we waste. A 
quarter of adults are overweight or obese, families put £470 per year of food 
straight into the bin.

We will change that relationship with education and labelling, better health 
interventions and a new food framework.
 
Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, has been 
elected as the new chairman of the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison 
Organisation (Tulo), which co-ordinates the activities of unions affiliated to
Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.
 
At a fringe meeting Angela Eagle, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership before standing down 
to make way for Owen Smith, refused to say whether she would return to the 
shadow cabinet. “I’m not going to answer questions like that at this stage,” 
she said.
 
Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, told the conference in his speech this 
morning thatLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> would campaign 
to get rid of fees that mean women wanting to access legal aid to help them 
divorce or separate from an abusive partner are being charged up to £125. He 
described it as a “hidden health fee”.

Women have to pay the moneyso they can receive a letter from their GP 
confirming any illness or harm has been caused by domestic violence, he said. 
He told delegates he was taking up the issue following talks with Lisa Clover, 
coordinator of the Manchester-based domestic abuse campaign, the Safe Spots 
Centre.

[Lisa] told me that women who are in the same position as she was, women who 
have tried to escape an abusive relationship, tried to get help for themselves 
and their families from our courts, are being charged £75 for a letter from 
their GP to say they’re a victim of domestic violence, so that they can access 
legal aid - sometimes even more.

Lisa told me women are coming into the Safe Spots Centre asking for help 
because they’re getting charged £125 for a letter - £125 for a piece of paper, 
a piece of paper which says ‘Yes, this woman is suffering from domestic abuse, 
yes she needs help’.

I don’t need to pass this through the national policy forum to say that a 
future Labour government will scrap this hidden health fee.
