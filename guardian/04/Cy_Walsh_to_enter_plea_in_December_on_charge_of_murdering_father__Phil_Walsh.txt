Dressed in a green windcheater, he stared straight ahead during the brief 
hearing and spoke only to indicate that he could hear the magistrate.

The court was told that results of toxicology tests on the defendantâ€™s hair 
had been obtained and would be subject to expert analysis.

That process would take three to four weeks, the prosecutor, Lucy Boord, said.

At a previous hearing the court heard that Walsh may have been experiencing a 
drug-induced psychosis when he allegedly murdered his father.
