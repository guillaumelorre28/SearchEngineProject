Innovation is an overused and abused word in the technology industry but if 
you strip it down to the basic principle of “new ideas”, it’s clear that 
there’s a lot of it going on in mobile games. When you gather some of the best 
examples together, you realise how many new ideas are out there. For example, 
there have been some creative experiments with the idea of interactive fiction, 
from the round-the-world thrills of80 Days <http://www.inklestudios.com/> 
to the beat-the-censors story ofBlackbar <http://mrgan.com/blackbar/>.

There are games that play with sound in new and interesting ways: Papa 
Sangre II <http://www.papasangre.com/> is played entirely by listening rather 
than looking, whileDark Echo <http://darkechogame.com/> visualises your sounds 
on the screen. Both are – and this may not be a coincidence – among the 
creepiest mobile games available.

Some games get you moving in the real world: wandering in the case of Ingress; 
jogging for your (virtual) life with Zombies, Run!; and even dancing with 
Bounden <http://bounden.gameovenstudios.com/>. Smartwatch games like Lifeline: 
Silent Night <http://3mingames.com/2015/04/lifeline/> and Spy_Watch 
<http://www.spywatchgame.com/> play with the potential of storytelling on your 
wrist.

Games exploring real-world issues include Endgame: Syria 
<http://gamethenews.net/index.php/endgame-syria/> and Papers, Please 
<http://papersplea.se/> and others splice together new genres, such as Framed 
<http://framed-game.com/>, with its motion-comic puzzles, and ambient 
grow-’em-upPrune <http://www.prunegame.com/>.

Even for familiar genres, there are new ideas: Twofold Inc finds a new twist 
on match-three puzzling;Capitals <http://www.nimblebit.com/> reinvents the 
competitive word game; andMidnight Star <https://www.midnightstargame.com/> 
finds a way for first-person shooters to work well on touchscreens.

Read on for a list of 50 games trying new things on your mobile devices, often 
below the limelight at the top of the app store charts.

One final, important point: the games in this list are innovative, but they’re 
also great. Technical invention or genre crossovers married to a poor game are 
of little value to players. What the developers of this selection have managed 
is to ally their new ideas with fun gameplay.

 80 Days: ‘You’ll want to read and play it several times to try different 
routes.’ 
80 Days <http://www.inklestudios.com/80days/>
Android/iOS (£3/£3.99) 
Phileas Fogg’s famous journey around the world, reworked as an interactive 
steampunk-themed novel. It’s a very clever idea, but that cleverness never gets 
in the way of the story: you’ll want to read and play it several times to 
try different routes.

Adventure Time Game Wizard <http://www.atgamewiz.com/>
Android/iOS (£3.96/£3.99) 
In its regular adventure mode, this is a fun platform game based on popular 
cartoonAdventure Time. But the real fun comes when you start drawing your own 
levels – on paper or on screen – sharing them with other players and trying out 
their efforts.

A Study in Steampunk 
<https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/study-in-steampunk/>
Android/iOS (£2.99/£3.18) 
Publisher Choice of Games <https://www.choiceofgames.com/> has released a 
succession of interactive novels, with the innovation being its engine for 
wrapping the story around your decisions. This is a great example: 277,000 
words of narrative with you in the central role.

Blackbar <http://mrgan.com/blackbar/>
Android/iOS (£1.22/£2.29) 
One of the apps exploring a blend of literature and gaming, Blackbar is a game 
told through text – censored letters between its principal characters where you 
have to guess the words hidden by the black bars. Also check its prequel,Grayout
 <http://mrgan.com/grayout/>.

Blown Away <http://www.blackpants.de/project-blown-away/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP/£2.29) 
This is an engaging platform game starring a cheerful hero named Hendrik, who 
wears “teleporting shoes”. They’re the key to the game’s twist on the genre: 
you teleport around the levels rather than jumping, which brings new 
puzzle-solving possibilities.

Bounden <http://bounden.gameovenstudios.com/>
Android/iOS (£2.99/£2.29) 
You’ll want your partner in this game to be someone with whom you’re 
comfortable sharing personal space. It’s “a mix of Twister and ballet” as you 
both hold your smartphone and follow its instructions to dance together to 
classical music.

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons <http://www.brothersthegame.com/>
iOS (£3.99) 
A beautiful story, as you control two brothers trying to find a cure for their 
sick father. You control both brothers at once with onscreen joysticks, but 
it’s the narrative – and a now-famous twist – that packs an unusually emotional 
punch.

Capitals: Free Word Battle <http://www.nimblebit.com/>
iOS (Free + IAP) 
Words With Friends <https://www.zynga.com/games/words-friends> did a great job 
of turning Scrabble into a multiplayer mobile word-battler.Capitals is really 
inventive, though: a word game that involves capturing tiles on a screen 
and conquering your opponent turn-by-turn.

Clumsy Ninja <http://www.naturalmotion.com/clumsy-ninja/3909/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
Clumsy Ninja may be getting on a bit now but it remains one of the most 
innovative character-driven games on mobile. You train up the initially klutzy 
warrior through mini-games, but it’s the console-quality animation that gives 
him bags of character.

Code Warriors: Hakitzu Battles 
<http://www.codewarriorsgame.com/kai-web-kai/login>
iOS (Free) 
How do you make learning to program more entertaining for children? Getting 
them to battle giant mecha-robots with their fledgling JavaScript skills is how
Code Warriors approaches it. Children can battle alone or take on their 
Facebook friends’ bots.

Crashlands <https://www.crashlands.net/>
Android/iOS (£4.22/£3.99) 
The developers say this game is a “crafting RPG”, which neatly summarises its 
gameplay. After crash-landing on an alien planet, you have to forage, fight and 
craft your way in the world. The way the game opens up the more you play is 
excellent.

 Dark Echo: make pretty pictures as you bounce sound around the game’s terrain 
– but watch out for the enemy… 
Dark Echo <http://darkechogame.com/>
Android/iOS (£1.49) 
A spooky game that relies on “visualised sound” to explore its 80 levels. That 
means you make sounds which ping off the obstacles around you in the game’s 
world, making pretty pictures on screen. The enemy you face, though, 
is far from pretty…

Does Not Commute <http://www.mediocre.se/commute/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
This tears up the traditional driving game format by putting you in charge of 
a small town’s rush hour – controlling all the vehicles. Expect plenty of 
crashes, although it’s fun rather than frustrating, and includes a practice 
mode to refine your skills.

Endgame: Syria  <http://gamethenews.net/index.php/endgame-syria/>
Android (Free) 
Basing games on real-world wars can be tricky – this exploration of the 
conflict in Syria had to be reworked as  Endgame: Eurasia 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/endgame-eurasia/id607705356?ls=1&mt=8> to get 
an iOS release. On Android, it’s uncensored and, two years after its release, 
still makes you think hard.

Evoland <http://evoland.shirogames.com/>
Android/iOS (£3.49/£3.99) 
A love letter to role-playing games (RPG) in the form of a game that evolves 
its way through the genre’s history. It starts as the kind of monochrome RPG 
that you might have played on a Game Boy, and ends up as a lush-looking 3D 
adventure.

Framed <http://framed-game.com/>
Android/iOS (£1.74/£2.99) 
This has been described as a “motion-comic puzzler” – the first in the genre. 
It’s a good description, too: you play the game by rearranging animated 
comic-strip panels to progress through its story. An atmospheric jazz 
soundtrack adds to the appeal.

Guitar Hero Live <https://www.guitarhero.com/uk/en/game>
iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/guitar-hero-live/id1024764676?mt=8> (Free 
+ IAP)
In 2015, console gamers were rocking out in their living rooms once more with 
a newGuitar Hero game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/15/guitar-hero-live-music-gaming-legend>
. This time though Apple TV owners could join in: the iOS version of the game 
can be played on the TV, complete with its own guitar-controller bundle.

Her Story <http://www.herstorygame.com/>
iOS (£3.99) 
Fancy playing detective? Her Story is a gripping murder-mystery based 
around video footage of interviews with the chief suspect. Your job is to 
watch the clips, think of new search terms to mine the video database, 
and figure out the truth.

Ingress <https://www.ingress.com/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
Less a game, more a way of life for its keenest fans: this is the best example 
of location-based gaming yet. You choose a side in its sci-fi plot, then 
explore the game’s environment as you wander around the real world, working 
alone or with fellow players.

Letterpad: Free Word Puzzles <http://www.nimblebit.com/>
iOS (Free + IAP) 
On iPhone and iPad, Letterpad is a simple, addictive letter-puzzles game, 
where you find words relating to more than 200 themes in 3x3 grids. Its 
innovation comes with its Apple Watch edition, with the game working smoothly 
on the smartwatch.

Lifeline: Silent Night <http://3mingames.com/2015/04/lifeline/>
Android/iOS (83p/£1.49) 
One of several games here designed to run across your smartphone 
and smartwatch. LikeSpy_Watch <http://www.spywatchgame.com/>, the gameplay here 
happens via notifications, with prompts for you to influence the game by 
interacting with stranded astronaut character Taylor.

 The first-person shooter and the touchscreen are not natural bedfellows: 
Midnight Star has rethought the genre. 
Midnight Star <https://www.midnightstargame.com/>
iOS (Free + IAP) 
First-person shooter (FPS) games can struggle on touchscreens, without a mouse 
and keyboard, or joypad, to control them.Midnight Star had an impressive crack 
at rethinking the genre to work well for touch, ensuring you can pinpoint-aim 
while moving.

Minecraft: Pocket Edition 
<https://mojang.com/2011/05/minecraft-pocket-edition/>
Android/iOS/Windows Phone (£4.99/£4.99/£5.39) 
An obvious choice, perhaps, but even for seasoned players, Minecraft is 
capable of constant surprises as you explore its blocky landscapes. The game 
that forged a new genre from open-world crafting – and one whose mobile version 
is improving fast.

Monument Valley <http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/>
Android/iOS/Windows Phone (£2.99 + IAP) 
Some parts of Monument Valley are familiar but it’s the way this architectural 
puzzler puts them together that feels so fresh. You have to slide, twist and 
flip the scenery in its geometrically beautiful levels to solve the mazes. 
Wonderful.

Motion Tennis <http://www.rolocule.com/games.html>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP/£3.99) 
Remember how you could play tennis on Nintendo’s Wii by swinging your arms in 
the real world?Motion Tennis performs a similar trick with your smartphone and 
an Apple TV or Chromecast plugged into your TV. You’ll need a firm grip on your 
phone, mind.

Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector <http://nekoatsume.com/games/neko/index.html>
Android 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.hit_point.nekoatsume>/iOS 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nekoatsume/id923917775?l=ja&ls=1&mt=8> (Free + 
IAP)
The world’s only – as far as we’re aware – cat-collecting game. This Japanese 
game is as quirky as they come: you place food in your garden to attract cats, 
logging them in a virtual “catbook” and hoping for rarities. Cute  and very 
addictive.

New Star Soccer <http://www.newstarsoccer.com/nssmobile.php>
Android/iOS/Windows Phone (Free + IAP) 
You can play FIFA on your smartphone or tablet, and it’s impressive, but New 
Star Soccer has done the best job of rethinking football for the small screen. 
Retro graphics belie deeply addictive gameplay and pixel-perfect touch controls.

Papa Sangre II <http://www.papasangre.com/>
iOS (£3.99) 
Another older game whose ambition has yet to be bettered: Papa Sangre II is 
played with your ears. You explore its creepy afterlife world through sound 
alone, with monsters and traps to avoid, and the voice of Sean Bean guiding you 
(you hope) to safety.

Papers, Please <http://papersplea.se/>
iOS (£5.99) 
Papers, Please makes you a border guard for the fictional dictatorship of 
Arstotzka, telling its story through scanned papers and shifty travellers. 
Bleak but thought-provoking, it may even shape your views on real-life 
immigration debates.

PrideFest <http://pridefestgame.com/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
PrideFest may not look that innovative: it’s a familiar city-building social 
game. What’s new is its focus: it celebrates the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community, with Pride carnivals central to the 
game as your city revives.

Prune <http://www.prunegame.com/> 
Android/iOS/Windows Phone (£2.99/£2.99/£3.09) 
“A love letter to trees”, according to its app store listing, Prune is one of 
the most relaxing games you’ll play, but also one of the most imaginative. You 
have to grow your tree with gentle swipes on the screen, seeking out the 
sunlight.

Race the Sun <http://flippfly.com/racethesun/>
iOS (£3.99) 
You may have seen futuristic racing games before but Race the Sun comes with a 
clever concept: the world that you zip your solar glider through changes every 
day, as you race constantly against the sunset. It’s very hard but rewarding 
too.

Roblox <https://www.roblox.com/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
Roblox has been described as gaming’s equivalent of YouTube: where players 
make their own games and share them with the community. The results can be 
brilliant: even a quick browse will reveal a few dozen that you’ll want to play.

Ryan North’s To Be Or Not To Be 
<http://gamebookadventures.com/gamebooks/to-be-or-not-to-be/>
Android/iOS (£4.88/£4.49) 
Shakespeare diehards beware: this game lovingly takes a sledgehammer to the 
playHamlet, reimagining it as a “second-person nonlinear branching narrative 
format”. It’s part book and part game, and always mischievously entertaining.

Scribblenauts Unlimited <http://www.5thcell.com/scribblenauts_unlimited/>
Android 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.scribblenauts3&hl=en>
 /iOS 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/scribblenauts-unlimited/id1030902626?mt=8&v0=WWW-NAUS-ITSTOP100-PAIDAPPS&l=en&ign-mpt=uo%3D4>
 (£3.96 + IAP/£3.99 + IAP)
A colourful puzzle-adventure with a startling twist: your character’s magic 
notebook, which summons any object you want in an attempt to solve 
puzzles. It should be impossible but the system can cope with most things your 
imagination comes up with.

Shadowmatic <http://www.shadowmatic.com/>
iOS (£2.29 + IAP) 
Another clever idea: a puzzle game based on rotating objects to make shadow 
shapes on a wall. Yes, one of them is a rabbit, shadow puppet fans, but there 
are plenty more to provide a challenge. And for those who find it tough, you 
can buy hints.

Skylanders SuperChargers 
<https://www.skylanders.com/video-games/skylanders-superchargers>
iOS (Free + IAP) 
Activision’s Skylanders games – and their physical toys – have been big hits 
with children. The latest iOS version breaks boundaries by matching its console 
versions – and also with its physical tablet stand and “portal” that you buy 
separately.

Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon <http://www.shroudedmoon.com/>
Android/iOS (£1.61/£2.29) 
Games where you play a spider are pretty thin on the ground but this makes the 
life of an arachnid a bewitching experience. You creep around a mysterious 
manor catching insects but also solving the mystery of why the mansion has been 
abandoned.

SPL-T <http://simogo.com/work/spl-t/>
iOS (£2.29) 
Another inventive new approach to puzzle games. Here, you start with a blank 
black screen. Tap, and it divides in half. Keep tapping and it keeps dividing, 
according to logic that becomes clear as you play. Bends your brain inside out, 
in a good way.

 Spy_Watch: use your Apple Watch to direct agents in the field. 
Spy_Watch <http://www.spywatchgame.com/>
iOS (99p) 
One of the early examples of a game created just for smartwatches, this puts 
Apple Watch owners in charge of their own espionage agency. Your spy reports in 
from the field on your watch via notifications, and you direct them on missions.

Swapperoo <http://www.fallentreegames.com/swapperoo-to-hit-steam-this-weekend/>
iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/swapperoo/id999771588?mt=8> (79p) 
Another puzzle game that involves matching three things of the same colour, 
but with some inventive twists,Swapperoo’s uniqueness comes in the different 
rules by which certain tiles play, as well as “freeform” stages that vary each 
time you play.

The Room Three <http://www.fireproofgames.com/games/the-room-three-2>
Android/iOS (£3.99) 
All three The Room games could qualify for this feature: they offer tactile 
physical puzzles to solve, tailor-made for touchscreens rather than any other 
gaming device.The Room Three is the best looking yet, with ingenious puzzles to 
solve.

The Sailor’s Dream <http://simogo.com/work/the-sailors-dream/>
iOS (£2.99) 
Any game from developer Simogo is guaranteed to think well outside the norm. 
The Sailor’s Dream is as much a story as a game: a sailor’s life 
refracted through a hazy filter of narrative and music. It’s unlike anything 
else on mobile.

This War of Mine <http://www.11bitstudios.com/games/16/this-war-of-mine>
Android/iOS (£10.99) 
The innovation in This War of Mine is that it puts you into a war game – but 
you’re not playing the soldiers, rather the civilians trying to survive in a 
war-torn city. You craft, trade and scavenge for your life, with some tough 
decisions to make.

Thomas Was Alone  <http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/>
Android/iOS (10p/79p) 
One of the few games where a rectangle takes the title role – and certainly 
the best story of the lot. This “minimalist game about friendship and 
jumping” pairs stripped-down gameplay with a story that grabs you and doesn’t 
let go until the end.

Toca Blocks <http://tocaboca.com/app/toca-blocks/>
Android/iOS (£2.99) 
Aimed at children, this is as much an open-ended creative toy as a game, with 
no scores or specific goals. It’s like a side-onMinecraft, with kids able to 
build and destroy different kinds of blocks to create anything they like, with 
superheroes thrown in, too.

Twofold Inc <http://www.twofoldinc.com/>
Android/iOS (£2.99) 
Another example of a developer finding new shapes into which to twist 
the match-three puzzle genre. Your task is to connect same-coloured tiles, 
emptying bars at the top of the screen, while planning several moves ahead. 
It’s brain-dizzyingly clever.

Vainglory <http://www.vainglorygame.com/>
Android/iOS (Free + IAP) 
Vainglory’s innovation lies in bringing one of the most hardcore game genres – 
multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) – to touchscreen devices. It 
works beautifully, too, with the fast response times and the frenetic action 
fans of the genre demand.

You Must Build a Boat <http://eightyeightgames.com/you-must-build-a-boat/>
Android/iOS (£2.29) 
Endless-runner games have been popular on mobile since the excellent Canabalt 
<http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/>. You Must Build a Boat does a great job of 
twisting the genre into a new shape, working in match-three puzzle elements as 
well as clever power-ups and personalisation.

Zombies, Run! <https://zombiesrungame.com>
Android/iOS/Windows Phone (Free/Free/£1.49 + IAP) 
There are plenty of apps trying to get you jogging but how many of them 
involve being chased by zombies? That’s the sharp idea behindZombies, Run! but 
it’s more than just scary sound effects: there’s a great story here that will 
help you stick with it.
