 A touch of the grotesque … Degas’s At the Café Châteaudun. Photograph: 
National Gallery, London 
Edgar Degas – At the Café Châteaudun (about 1869-71)
There are hints of the great caricaturist Honoré Daumier 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_Daumier> in this acute, even 
grotesque portrayal of two men doing business in a cafe who look like 
villainous characters in a novel byZola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilezola>. Some people still think Degas 
just did ballet dancers, but he is the most varied and risk-taking of all the 
impressionists.
