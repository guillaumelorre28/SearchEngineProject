As anyone familiar with the internet will know, American Apparel is more than 
just a purveyor of tight, brightly coloured clothes that sometimes (often) 
cause chafing. Right now, American Apparel is a company in crisis.Its CEO, Dov 
Charney, has been sacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/17/american-apparel-ceo-dov-charney-fired-fall-icon-sleaze>
. A new leader,Paula Schneider, has been parachuted in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/17/american-apparel-paula-schneider-dov-charney>
, and is attempting to de-sleaze its image. How to promote the brand at this 
delicate moment without causing any offence?

Here’s a decent attempt: its latest campaign features a sloth called 
Buttercup, chilling in an “ironic” lady pose, while promoting both American 
Apparel’s eco credentials andthe Sloth Sanctuary in Costa Rica 
<http://www.slothsanctuary.com/>. Surely we all agree that clothes should be 
ethical and sloths should be saved – particularly, mercifully, as Buttercup is 
not wearing disco pants or spandex. Ominously, though, the advert warns that 
“Buttercup has a surprise. Stay tuned.” Let’s keep this clean, guys.
