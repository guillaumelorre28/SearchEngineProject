"Information is a vital form of aid in itself… Disaster affected people need 
information as much as water, food, medicine, or shelter. Information can save 
lives, livelihoods and resources. "
IFRC World Disasters Report 

In the immediate aftermath of a disaster the first people to act are the 
affected communities themselves. If the humanitarian community can get the 
right information to them during that time it can make a huge difference.

Lives can be saved when humanitarian agencies work together to ensure messages 
about how people can effectively help their own communities – such as how to 
make water safe to drink and where to take shelter – reach them in time.

It is time to work together to resolve: How aid agencies and media 
organisations can work better together to provide life-saving information to 
disaster affected communities? And what are the obstacles to working in this 
way?
