What is it?

An app to help you find services, events and people when you're on the go. As 
well as providing a detailed directory, together with maps and directions, it 
includes an interactive search feature. Supposedly, this means you can make 
restaurant reservations having read a review, view film trailers and buy cinema 
tickets, and find the best petrol prices nearby.

Is it easy to use?

The menu is user-friendly and you can navigate your way to a result based on 
location (determined by GPS) or by conducting a specific search. There is 
plenty of information attached to search results, including phone numbers, 
addresses and directions.

However, when I tested it in central London on a BlackBerry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blackberry>, I was able to find a list 
of restaurants but unable to book a table or access any reviews. It was also 
impossible to buy cinema tickets, a process seemingly unsupported by my local 
search results â€“ strange given the country's biggest cinemas were within a mile 
of my location.

Is it fun?

More so than trudging round towns and cities haplessly searching for a 
destination that continues to elude you. Not so much when the app fails to 
deliver on its claims.

Is it pretty?

With a background that changes according to local weather conditions and a 
menu decorated with stylish icons, it is certainly eye catching.

Should you download it?

I think so. It is easy to use and well-designed, and importantly is free. 
Although it doesn't seem to do all the things it promises, the app makes 
getting from A to B a little more stress free and is therefore worthwhile.
