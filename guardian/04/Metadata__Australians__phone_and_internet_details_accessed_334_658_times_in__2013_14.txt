Government departments, agencies and councils accessed metadata from 
Australians’ phone calls and internet use 334,658 times in 2013-14, according 
to the the Telecommunications (Interceptions and Access) Actannual report 
<https://www.ag.gov.au/NationalSecurity/TelecommunicationsSurveillance/Documents/Telecommunications-Interception-and-Access-Act-1979-Annual-Report.pdf>
.

The act allows organisations to apply for access to “existing information or 
documents” which can include details of phone calls (but not the contents of 
the call) and internet access details such as subscribers’ personal 
information, and dates and times of internet usage.


Authorisations are granted for agencies either pursuing criminal enforcement 
matters or enforcing fines.


The figure for 2013-14 represents an increase of 1.3% in total requests over 
the previous year, but when adjusted for population the number of requests per 
100,000 people has dropped.


Police forces were the heaviest users, with New South Wales police making 
111,889 requests. Other agencies, such as the RSPCA and councils, are also able 
to make warrantless metadata requests, with RSPCA Victoria making 64 requests 
in 2013-14.


This year’s figures also included a revision to last year’s total, with the 
addition of a number of previously undeclared requests from the Department of 
Immigration and Border Protection.


The government has passed legislation with bipartisan support 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/26/mandatory-data-retention-becomes-law-as-coalition-and-labor-combine>
 requiring telcos and internet service providers to store customers’ metadata – 
including the time and participants in phone calls, text messages and emails – 
for two years. But not all agencies can access the data stored under the new 
legislation.

Here’s the full breakdown of requests by agency, for requests relating to 
criminal matters:
