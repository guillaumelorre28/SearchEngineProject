Over 200 million women globally want to control the number of babies they have 
but are unable to do so. Almost all of these women live in the developing world.

Marie Stopes International has first hand experience of the devastating 
consequences a lack of access to family planning can have for women, children, 
families and entire communities. If all women who desired it had access to 
modern contraceptive methods, 52 million unintended pregnancies would be 
prevented annually, which in turn would result in:

• 23 million fewer unplanned births
• 22 million fewer abortions
• 7 million fewer miscarriages
• 1.4 million fewer infant deaths
• 142,000 fewer pregnancy related deaths
• 505,000 fewer children losing their mothers

Women are empowered by family planning; they will be better placed to access 
education and new work opportunities and make a greater contribution to the 
economy.

Donor investment in family planning needs to increase substantially in order 
to prevent levels of unmet need rising exponentially in the next few decades. 
UN estimates suggest that, if current levels contraceptive don't increase – 
then the world's population could almost double to a staggering 11.9 billion by 
2050.

A Midwife Speaks Out
"In rural areas there is no planning to have children or not. Women accept 
every pregnancy as their fate. Mostly I have seen that women are not happy 
after their third or fourth pregnancy. Due to malnutrition women become weak 
and when they become pregnant their responsibilities double. The woman has to 
perform housework, has to take care of the children and of other family 
members. Some women use local methods to abort the baby and some consult with 
doctors, lady health visitors and traditional birth attendants. It is true that 
our religion and culture don't permit abortion. But in the case of the 
constrained, God may forgive them."
