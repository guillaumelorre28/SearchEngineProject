The game that nobody wanted to play - a battle for third place on the eve of a 
final which would be cheered on by 60,000 spectators rather than just 2,500 - 
hosted the two sides who had met at this stage last time out. And once again 
Nigeria were too strong forMali <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mali>.

Jay-Jay Okocha put Nigeria in front after just 17 minutes with a free kick 
which took him top of the tournament's goalscoring charts along with Mali's 
Fredi Kanoute and Cameroon's Patrick Mboma.

The kick was typically powerful and a deflection off Mali captain Mahamadou 
Diarra saw Nigeria into the interval with a one goal advantage.

Scorer then turned provider shortly after the break, with Okocha sending over 
a cross for Peter Odemwingie to nudge into the net via his forehead.

Mali struck back in the 70th minute with a terrific volley from Janvier Abouta 
but had their own poor finishing to blame as About a and Mohamed Lamine 
Sissokho lashed at chances and Kanoute, rendered ineffective for much of the 
match, was substituted after 65 minutes.

Djibril Sidibe forced a good save from Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama 
with a swerving free kick, but for the second successive tournament Mali were 
pushed into fourth place by a far stronger Nigerian side.

Captain Jay Jay Okocha was named best player of the 2004 African Cup of 
Nations by the Confederation of African Football on Saturday.

The 30-year-old midfielder received his award at halftime of Saturday's 
African Nations Cup final between Morocco and Tunisia at Rades.

Okocha said he had thoroughly enjoyed the tournament, in which he had 
contributed four goals to Nigeria's third place.

"I had a great tournament, a great time in Tunisia," he said. 

"I was very happy the way they (the crowd) appreciated us. I think I value my 
experience at this tournament more than I did in 1994."
