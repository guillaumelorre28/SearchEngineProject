Alien <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alien> vs Predator exceeded all 
expectations to fight its way to the top of the American box office this 
weekend. The monster tale took an impressive $38.3m (£20.8m), delighting its 
distributors, Fox. It also became the sixth Fox film in a row to open with more 
than $20m - the longest run for any studio.

"It's a great number," Fox's Bruce Snyder told Variety. "We couldn't be 
happier."

There was also good news for Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. It too 
performed better than expected, taking $23m (£12.5m) over the weekend. The 
film, which stars Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews, has now earned an estimated 
$37.2m (£20.2m) since opening on Wednesday, only slightly down on the entire 
first week of the original Princess Diaries.

Expectations at the box office were not high on Friday. The opening of the 
Olympics, coupled with the destructive hurricane Charley, were predicted to 
dent audiences. In the end, that doesn't seem to have happened. Young men 
poured in to see Alien vs Predator; figures show that audiences were 70% male 
and 55% under 25. Young women couldn't get enough of Princess Diaries 2; 
audiences were 76% female and 51% under 18.

In the rest of the top ten, last week's number one, Tom Cruise's Collateral, 
dropped to third place, taking a further $16m (£8.7m). It was followed by the 
animated film Yu-Gi-Oh!, based on a popular television series and card game. 
According the Hollywood Reporter, distributors Warner Bros bought worldwide 
rights to the film (excluding Japan) for an estimated $5m (£2.7m). It made 
$9.4m (£5.1m) in its opening weekend.
