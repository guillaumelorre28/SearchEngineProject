Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and Italy have issued widely 
different figures for how many people are still not accounted for in the ferry 
fire that killed at least 11 people in the Adriatic Sea.

The numbers ranged from as many as 98, according to the Italian prosecutor 
Giuseppe Volpe, to 18, according to the Greek merchant marine ministry. Greece 
says Italy’s list is full of duplications and misspellings but the discrepancy 
could not be immediately explained since the prosecutor’s office was closed for 
the New Year holiday.

A tug began towing the fire-ravaged ferry across wind-whipped seas toward Italy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> on Thursday afternoon.

Giuseppe Barretta, the owner of the tug boat company, told the Associated 
Press in the Adriatic port of Brindisi that the operation had started near the 
coast ofAlbania <https://www.theguardian.com/world/albania>, where the Norman 
Atlantic ferry had been stranded after Sunday’s pre-dawn fire. He estimated the 
towing could take 15 hours, depending on weather.

Earlier, the Italian coastguard said waves in the region were as high as five 
metres (16ft) and winds were blowing at more than 40 knots (46mph).

Once the ferry arrives in Brindisi, Italian authorities will inspect its 
interior for any possible other bodies.

Floriana Segreto of the Italian coastguard said a total of 477 people had been 
rescued from the stricken ferry. That figure, plus the 11 dead, would mean at 
least 488 people had been on board as it sailed from Greece to Italy.

Greek officials said 474 people were officially on the ferry – leading to 
questions about Italy’s tally or suggestions that the ferry had also been 
carrying an unknown number of unregistered migrants.

Italy says it rescued or discovered 170,000 migrants and asylum seekers at sea 
last year as they tried to slip intoEurope
