Exhibition of the week

Jorge Otero-Pailos: The Ethics of Dust
This latex cast of a medieval wall captures the dust and dirt of centuries of 
British parliamentary history. It is a timely artwork in the Palace of 
Westminster at a time when the mother of parliaments is threatened by 
architectural decay and public disillusion.
• Westminster Hall <https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/the-ethics-of-dust/>,

Antony van Dyck – Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart (c. 
1638)
This painting is haunted by the blood of civic strife. Both of these elegant 
young men – the very epitome of “cavaliers” – were soon to die fighting on the 
Royalist side in the English civil war. Van Dyck’s opulent, silky, portrait 
reminds us of a long ago time when peaceful Britain fell apart.
