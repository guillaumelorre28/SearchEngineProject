Sir Martin Sorrell has backed Aegis Media's largest shareholder, Vincent 
Bolloré, to take over the UK media buying company after the conclusion of the
sell-off of its research arm Synovate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/21/aegis-ipsos-vincent-bollore-synovate?INTCMP=SRCH>
.

Sorrell, speaking to MediaGuardian.co.uk at the Cannes Lions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/cannes-lions> International, also said he 
had no problem with the potential market impact of News Corporation's proposed 
takeover of the 60% of BSkyB it does not already own.

"It is totally fine, I don't see the difference to where they are now and 
where they would be," he said.

Sorrell has previously said he is not interested in buying Synovate – WPP 
acquired research firm TNS in 2008 – but on Thursday admitted that some parts of
Aegis <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aegis> Media were attractive to WPP.

Analysts have pointed out that there are likely to be anti-trust issues in 
some countries, asWPP <https://www.theguardian.com/business/wppgroup> is 
already a dominant force in media buying in most major advertising markets.

However, Aegis Media also owns creative businesses such as the Isobar network 
and recent acquisition Mitchell's in Australia.

Sorrell said WPP <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wpp> had "not looked at 
it" but said there were "bits" of Aegis Media that were "interesting". 
"Anti-trust doesn't apply to everywhere in the world," he added.

However he made it clear that speculation on the potential sell-off of either 
Synovate, which is likely to be sold to French research firm Ipsos, or Aegis 
Media was purely an "academic question" given Bolloré's 26.5% share holding.

"Jerry Buhlmann is chief executive [of Aegis Group] in a company with a 30% 
shareholder sitting on his shoulder, a Bolloré parrot on his shoulder," he 
said. "It is not in his gift [to sell], you have to go and bend the knee to 
Vincent, have to ask his permission. He decides what happens, he can stop it. 
Even if it is 51% [of voters required to sell Synovate or Aegis Media] it is 
51% of those voting and he is in control of it."

Some analysts have installed Maurice Levy's Publicis Groupe – which has also 
said it is not interested in Synovate – in pole position for buying Aegis Media 
if it comes to market.

Sorrell's money is on Bolloré, who despite recently claiming that his stake in 
Aegis was now just "financial" and not "strategic" has previously long argued 
the logic of a tie-up with Havas.

"I think the primary candidate [to take control of Aegis Media] is Bolloré," 
he said. "If you own Havas then Havas plus Aegis has got to be worth more than 
Havas alone."

Sorrell also said he believed that Ipsos will be the victor in the £500m 
acquisition of Synovate – no rival bids have yet emerged – but felt that Aegis 
Group executives should have made Bolloré aware of the talks earlier.
