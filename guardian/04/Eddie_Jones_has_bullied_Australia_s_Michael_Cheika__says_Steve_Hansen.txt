Australia’s misery at their Test series defeat by England has intensified 
after the Wallabies’ head coach, Michael Cheika, was accused of allowing Eddie 
Jones to “bully him”. New Zealand’s World Cup-winning coach, Steve Hansen, 
launched the attack in response to Australia’sseries defeat with a match to 
spare following losses in Brisbane and Melbourne

A feature of the first two matches was Cheika’s refusal to engage in the 
phoney war, while Jones repeatedly used the media to land psychological blows 
on Australia, their team and coach. Jones even took on Fox Sports, the host 
broadcaster, and won, forcing them toissue an apology

 after he objected to a vulgar line of questioning from one of their pundits, 
the former Wallabies loose forward Stephen Hoiles, at a press conference.

Cheika, however, has refused to return fire and Hansen believes that has 
weakened Australia on the pitch. Hansen said: “Cheika’s not come back, he’s 
letting Eddie have a free rein – to the point where it actually seems like he’s 
letting Eddie bully him in the media. I don’t know if that’s because they know 
each other that well, or if there’s a pecking order from the old days. That’s 
gone on to the park, hasn’t it?”

The final Test will be played at Sydney’s Allianz Stadium on Saturday when 
Australia will seek to salvage some pride while England go in search of a 
whitewash – having not previously won a series in Australia. Responding to 
Hansen’s comments, Jones said he has not deliberately tried to intimidate his 
counterpart.

“I haven’t tried to win a war of words,” he said. “I am the coach, you guys 
ask me questions, I give you answers. And then you guys decide whether it is 
mind games or whether I am being a bully or whether I am trying to be clever or 
whether I am just an idiot. You decide that, not me. I just try to answer the 
questions truthfully and honestly.”

Jones is in little doubt over Hansen’s motive for a remark that is sure to 
antagonise Cheika. “Steve has got the Rugby Championship coming up,” he said. 
“He’s only being mischievous ... to help himself for the Rugby Championship.”
