Exhibition of the Week

South Africa: Art of a Nation
100,000 years of art history are spanned in the blink of an eye in this survey 
of South Africa’s many arts – from the earliest known painting workshop to the 
video art of William Kentridge.
• British Museum

from 27 October to 26 February.

Also showing

Edward Krasiński
The humour of this Polish conceptual artist, who died in 2004, is infectious 
and liberating. False perspectives and illusory architecture question the 
nature of reality but his most surreal stunt was putting a line of blue tape 
over everything. You had to be able to laugh in Soviet-ruled Poland.
• Tate Liverpool 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/edward-krasinski> 
until 5 March.

Paul Nash
One of the most powerful and original British painters of the early 20th 
century bears witness to the horrors of war and the magic of landscape.
• Tate Britain 
<https://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/on-now-coming-soon/the-view-from-here/>

, Oxford, until 15 January.

 A stag antler headdress made from the skull of a red deer, circa 8,000BC. 
Photograph: The British Museum 
This strange and evocative object, a pair of antlers made into a headdress, 
conjures up images of wild ritual dances in stone age Britain. It comes from 
Star Carr in Yorkshire, and suggests that shamanism – a belief in animal 
transformations, may have been prominent in prehistoric culture.

For this week’s My best shot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/20/nick-knight-photograph-erin-o-connor>
, Nick Knight selected his photograph of supermodel Erin O’Connor, wearing a 
Clockwork Orange-style nose while smashing a piano. “Erin loves all the drama 
and performance of a shoot, so I just said: ‘OK, here’s a piano, here’s a 
sledgehammer, off you go.’”
