Australia’s weakest growth in wages for nearly 20 years has reinforced the 
prospect that the Reserve Bank will be forced to cut interest rates at least 
once more in 2016.

Private sector wage rates rose by just 1.9% over the year to March, the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday

. When public sector wage increases are included, the overall figure was growth 
of 2% – the slowest since the data series began in 1997.

against a backdrop of falling wages, stuttering growth and a rising deficit, 
undermining Malcolm Turnbull’s “jobs and growth” campaign message.

But the more longer term economic impact is likely to be another reduction in 
borrowing costs by the central bank in the next few months.

The cash rate is already at a record low of 1.75% after the RBA lowered it by 
0.25% on 3 May

 in the wake the biggest fall in inflation for seven years.

David Bassanesse at the investment group Betashares said the RBA was for the 
first time trying to encourage higher rather than a lower wage inflation.

“That’s why the RBA cut interest rates earlier this month even though the 
economy is growing reasonably well, and it’s why it will likely cut again. 
Trend growth and steady unemployment is insufficient to boost the pace of wage 
growth and hence inflation over time,” he said.

“Instead, the RBA is effectively targeting a decline in the unemployment rate 
and higher wages – which is only possible through a return to above-trend 
economic growth.

Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, agreed and noted that 
Australia’s economy was following a trend in other developed economies where 
improving labour markets andfalling unemployment rates had not translated into 
higher wages

.

“Today’s data will be seen as increasing the possibility of another rate cut 
by the RBA, perhaps as soon as August,” he said. “Lower wages will tend to 
entrench reduced price pressure throughout the economy. As the inflation 
outlook declines, employers will be more likely to offer sub 2% annual wage 
rises.

“Soft wage growth also tends to weigh on consumer confidence and spending.”

The wage price figures came the day after the RBA had expressed confidence 
that a forecast pickup in economic growth and downward drift in unemployment 
would start to lift wages growth within a couple of years.

The minutes of its 3 May policy meeting, released on Tuesday, said: “In 
addition, information from the bank’s business liaison suggested that firms 
generally had been unwilling to make offers of wage growth below two per cent.”

But Wednesday’s ABS figures show the bank’s confidence may be misplaced 
because wages growth among businesses had already fallen below the 2% pace well 
before the RBA’s board had even met.

The outlook for wages is a key plank in the RBA’s forecast for price 
inflation, which in turn feeds into its interest rate decisions.

The RBA wants to boost economic growth to head off a vicious cycle of lower 
expectations feeding into smaller wage and price rises, which in turn validate 
and entrench those expectations.
