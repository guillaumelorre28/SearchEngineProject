It quickly emerged that Michael and his older brother Daniel, who plays for 
Adelaide, were the subjects of the investigation.

Pickering manages the pair.

Michael was an elimination final emergency for the Bulldogs, while Daniel 
played in the game.

“The boys obviously can’t speak at the moment because there’s an AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> investigation, as much as they’d like 
to,” Pickering told the Nine Network’s The Footy Show.

“They’re extremely angry and hurt and upset by what’s gone on.

“Daniel obviously, he’s been cleared by his club - there’s no issues from that 
end.

“The one who’s been left hanging out to dry is Michael, which is really 
disappointing.”

Pickering claimed Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge was yet to speak to Michael 
about the issue.

“I’m really surprised and a little bit disappointed that he hasn’t heard from 
the coach still,” Pickering said.

“He’s left him a number of messages.”

Pickering also had no doubt about Talia’s fate at the Bulldogs.

“He’s not going to be there next year, as simple as that, which is really 
disappointing,” Pickering said.

“The last few days have played out really ordinary in the public.

“There’s been hysteria around it.

“You hear words like treason and treachery from journalists - it’s absolutely 
disgraceful.

“They’re brothers - they have discussions every second night.”
