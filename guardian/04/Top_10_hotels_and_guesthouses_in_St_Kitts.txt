Seaview Inn, Basseterre

Seaview is a small guesthouse in central Basseterre, and the owner, Javier 
Cordero, makes visitors exceptionally welcome. There is nothing very fancy 
about the accommodation, but the location – close to the ferry terminal – and 
the service make it great value for money. It has a small restaurant and a 
well-stocked bar.

Ottley's Plantation Inn, Basseterre

You are greeted like an old friend at this elegant, 18th-century sugar 
plantation. Now a small hotel, lovingly run by the Keusch and Lowell families, 
Ottley's Plantation sits in 35 acres of gardens and rainforest, with a shuttle 
taking guests to the nearby beach. The 23 rooms, in the main house or in 
charming cottages in the grounds, are decorated in colonial-style chintz. It is 
pricier than guesthouses elsewhere, but worth it for the service and 
surroundings.

Bird Rock Beach Hotel, Basseterre

The views are striking at this neat little hotel, perched on cliffs close to 
Basseterre. As the name suggests, this is a good place to sit and watch 
magnificent frigate birds circling. There are 38 comfortable rooms, a private 
beach and an on-site diving centre. Rocky's beach bar is the place to kick back 
with a beer and a burger, while Diana's is a more formal dining option.

Timothy Beach Resort, Frigate Bay

Overlooking several beach bars on Frigate Bay – such as the lively Mr X's 
Shiggedy Shack – the affordable Timothy Beach Resort has plenty of nearby 
action, yet noise is rarely a problem here. Do, however, expect to wake up to 
parties of monkeys prancing on the lawns. This is the island's only hotel right 
on the Caribbean Sea and, with a choice of suites and studios with 
self-catering facilities, its simple, clean accommodation is especially good 
for families. Snorkelling and other water sports are available 
here. The ocean-front Sunset Café restaurant is casual and relaxed, and serves 
good breakfasts and seafood.

Banyan Tree B&B, near Charlestown, Nevis 

On St Kitts' sister island, Nevis – 30 minutes by ferry from Basseterre – 
artist Jonathan Rose and his herbalist wife Anne have restored a 17th-century 
stone property and made it into a characterful guesthouse, Banyan Tree. The 
eponymous tree is 300 years old and – often full of birds and monkeys – is a 
much-loved feature of the gardens, which are well planted. The accommodation is 
in the grounds: the Bamboo House, with a one-bedroom suite with antique 
four-poster, and the Guest House, with two pretty bedrooms.

Rock Haven B&B, Frigate Bay 

If you're after multiple facilities and entertainments, book into the 394-room 
Marriott Resort on Frigate Bay, complete with golf course, spa and casino. But 
for those who appreciate simpler surroundings, there is this small 
and traditional private home just down the road. With only two suites, Rock 
Haven is an intimate and rather luxurious B&B, with ocean views – and peace and 
quiet. Both suites have pretty, private patios, and the home-cooked breakfast 
is legendary, prepared with devotion by friendly owners Judith and Keith 
Blake. It's a tranquil, typical Caribbean house, minutes from Frigate Bay.

Mariposa Villas, Frigate Bay

Bay – close to shops and restaurants, but a quiet district. The property is

two-bedroom villas are decorated in soft colours and have private balconies or 
patios. There's a concierge on hand to advise on local restaurants and

Ocean Terrace Inn, Basseterre

Situated close to Basseterre, "OTI", as it's known, sits high on a hill 
overlooking Basseterre port and the Caribbean sea. It offers 69 rooms of 
various sizes, yet still has an intimate feel – and is convenient for shops and 
exploring the capital. The beautifully kept gardens are a delight. Note, 
though, that a stay here is not for the unfit: this is a property set over many 
levels and with many steps.

Golden Rock Inn, near Charlestown, Nevis 

What heaven. Set on the incredibly lush slopes of Nevis Peak, this 11-room inn

atmospheric 19th-century mill with a romantic tower. Dining is at The Rock 
restaurant, which serves locally grown food and fresh fish.
