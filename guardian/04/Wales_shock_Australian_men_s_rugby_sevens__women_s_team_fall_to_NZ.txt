The Australian men’s rugby sevens team suffered an upset quarter-final loss in 
the Dubai Sevens, losing 21-12 to Wales before recovering to finish fifth in 
the tournament.

South Africa won the competition, beating Olympic gold medallists and two-time 
defending series champions Fiji 26-14 in the final.

Wales were first to strike against Australia, going out to a 7-0 lead before 
the men in gold levelled the score.

Simon Kennewell then scored to give Australia a 12-7 lead at the break before 
Wales came roaring back with 14 unanswered points to take the victory.

The loss left the team and coach Andy Friend heavily disappointed.

“Credit to Wales they are a good aside and they played better than us and they 
took their chances,” he said.

The loss seemed to steel the Australians and they went on to beat New Zealand 
20-12 and then Scotland 19-12.

The win over New Zealand saw tries to Boyd Killingworth, Sam Myers, Henry 
Hutchison and Alex Gibbon.

Myers was again at the heart of the scoring against Scotland.

He burned the covering the Scottish defence after a solid passage of play to 
take the score 5-0, before a late converted try to the Scots gave them the 7-5 
lead heading into the break.

The second half saw the same struggle between the two teams as defence was the 
order of the day on tired legs.

Again, Australia struck first with a try that allowed the men in gold to take 
the lead 12-7 before Tim Anstee buried the Scots with a late try.

Friend was happy with the way his team bounced back and especially happy to 
get past New Zealand.

“It’s massive for us to beat New Zealand, it’s a good feeling and the 
performance we put out against Scotland was special for the team,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Australian women’s team were unable to repeat their Rio 
Olympics exploits, falling at the final hurdle, losing 17-5 to New Zealand in 
the gold-medal game.


Portia Woodman got things going for the Black Ferns burning the cover defence 
on the outside to give New Zealand a 5-0 lead from which they never looked back.


They extended their lead to 12-0 just before the break and as Australia made 
numerous errors managed to run out the game 17-5 winners.

The win was especially sweet for new coach Allan Bunting, who said: “We’re 
pretty stoked with that win. It’s been a while since we got a win over 
Australia and I’m sure they’ll go away and come back a lot stronger as a result 
of that match.

“We always go out to win but we’re still learning a lot. Most importantly the 
girls went out and played with heart.”

New Zealand playmaker Tyla Nathan-Wong added: “Honestly it’s the best feeling. 
This team is incredible ... I’m so proud of them. I can’t wait for the next 
round because I’m loving this team.

“It was pretty hard losing to Australia in Rio but full credit to the girls 
today.”
