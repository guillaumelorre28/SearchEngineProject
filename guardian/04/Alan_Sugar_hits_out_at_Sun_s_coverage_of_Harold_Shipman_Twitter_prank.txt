Alan Sugar has criticised the Sun <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> over 
its coverage of how he was tricked into retweeting a fake birthday message 
containing an image of the serial killerHarold Shipman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/shipman>.

The business magnate <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/alan-sugar> and star of 
BBC showThe Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> 
fell victim to a prankster who claimed the image was of his father and asked 
Lord Sugar to wish him a happy birthday.

A report in the Sun 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6833216/Lord-Alan-Sugar-tweets-birthday-message-to-vile-doc-serial-killer-Harold-Shipman.html?CMP=spklr-_-Editorial-_-TWITTER-_-TheSunNewspaper-_-20160101-_-News-_-320507471-_-Imageandlink>
, which said Sugar had “carelessly” tweeted the birthday message, was met with 
a furious response from the businessman, who recalled criticism of the 
newspaper’scoverage of the Hillsborough disaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/10/hillsborough-inquest-police-admit-sun-report-fans-looted-corpses-false>
 and said it had shown “no compassion” for the victims.

Sugar went on to tell his 4.8 million followers 
<https://twitter.com/Lord_Sugar/status/682907607372271616>: “When u leave a 
junior in charge of newsroom over the holidays this is what happens. I hope the 
kid keeps the job. #firesuneditor.”

He also turned his ire on the Daily Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror>, recalling its publication of 
photographs that were alleged to show a British solider urinating on an Iraqi 
prisoner but were subsequently discovered to have been faked.

Sugar’s counterpart on the US version of The Apprentice, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, was duped in 2014 into 
inadvertently sharing a picture of Fred and Rose West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/29/donald-trump-retweets-serial-killer-photos-in-comedians-twitter-prank>
 by a prankster who claimed that his parents had died.

Trump was also tricked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/12/donald-trump-duped-into-retweeting-picture-of-jeremy-corbyn>
 last year into tweeting a picture of the Labour party’s new leader,Jeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, after being told 
that the image showed the father of a supporter of the US presidential 
candidate.
