Australian cricket legend Shane Warne has honoured Michael Clarke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-clarke> in a video tribute, likening 
the retiring captain to the celebrated Allan Border.

“Allan Border was the most meticulous in preparation and I think Michael 
Clarke rivals Allan Border for his preparation in leading up to a game,” Warne 
said.

One of Clarke’s greatest tests as captain, said Warne, was his “unbelievable” 
leadership after the death of fellow batsman Phillip Hughes, who was struck on 
the head by a bouncer in the NSW-South Australia Sheffield Shield match and 
never recovered.

 Warne’s tribute to Clarke 
“He was representing the family and Australian cricket, so to be able to 
handle that when it was one of his best mates, like his brother ... I thought 
the way he handled that stuff was unbelievable.”

Warne has high hopes Clarke will go on to mentor the next generation of 
Australian cricketers and said he will be known not only for his skill but his 
on-field showmanship.

“Clarke will be remembered as a fleet-footed batsman that was a fantastic 
player of spinners, was great to watch, was easy on the eye, was a flamboyant 
player,” he said.

“The way he got his runs was pretty great to watch, and the way he did it was 
with a bit of flare and imagination.”
