Dinamo’s youngsters appeared to have secured a quarter-final against Barcelona 
by beating Anderlecht 2-0 – only for it to emerge after the game that Matije 
Fintica, a substitute brought on in the closing stages, was actually suspended.

Uefa subsequently launched an investigation into the case – which may result 
in Dinamo being disqualified and Anderlecht being handed their place.

However, Jean Kindermans, Anderlecht’s youth director, told local media: “We 
do not want to take their place. They beat us fairly on the pitch, and we don’t 
want to benefit from an appeal, especially as the suspended player had no 
influence on the outcome. We hope we are not asked to take part in the 
quarter-final.”

Dinamo also urged the governing body not to penalise their young players for 
what was an administrative mistake, saying in a statement: “After Dinamo’s 
young players won against Anderlecht the Uefa delegate discovered the mistake 
made by Dinamo administration. Anderlecht decided not to appeal because the 
better team won and that is the point of sport, but despite that Uefa decided 
to open the case against Dinamo anyway.

“We are ready to face a financial or any other kind of punishment – but we 
hope and believe that Uefa will recognise true values and will allow our 
brilliant youngsters, who proved their value on the pitch, to play in the 
quarter-final.”

Uefa, who are set to rule on Monday 29 February, are also investigating the 
bizarre incident in Chelsea’s game against Valencia in the same competition,

In 2014, Legia Warsaw fielded a suspended player in a Champions League

, which made the aggregate score 4-4. The Scottish club advanced to the 
play-offs on away goals, despite having originally lost the tie 6-1 on 
aggregate.
