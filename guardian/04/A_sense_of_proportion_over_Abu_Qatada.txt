The "most dangerous man in the world" who allegedly conspired to carry out 
terrorist bombings, among other criminal activities, could not, apparently, be 
tried and convicted in a British court. So the government is vowing to change 
the human rights laws to make such deportations easier (As Abu Qatada leaves, 
May vows to change law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/07/abu-qatada-human-rights>, 8 
July) Surely if such a dangerous criminal cannot be successfully prosecuted 
under our present, very comprehensive laws, it is they that need changing, not 
human rights legislation? I find it frightening, as Victoria Brittain points 
out (Comment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/abu-qatada-no-terrorist>
, 8 July), that hysteria is whipped up, massive amounts of money and time is 
wasted on one man.

• So "May reaps the rewards for getting her man" (8 July). But she is still 
set on leaving the European convention on human rights, because of the time it 
has taken to achieve this triumph. It has taken so long because successive home 
secretaries did not take seriously the commitment to human rights and, in 
particular, the right to the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair 
trial, even though these are also traditional British rights. Had any of them 
done so, they would have recognised that it would be wrong to deportAbu Qatada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-qatada>, who had not been convicted of 
any offence in the UK, to Jordan, where he had been convicted in his absence on 
the basis of evidence obtained under torture, without first obtaining bankable 
assurances from Jordan that, in a new trial, evidence obtained under torture 
would not be used. Had they done so, then they would have started the matter in 
the way in Mrs May eventually ended it, and no appeal to the European court of 
human rights or the UK courts would have succeeded.

• Sorry to spoil the party, but there has been no deportation. The man left 
voluntarily following an inter-state treaty.
