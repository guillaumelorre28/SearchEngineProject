The United Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> marks its 
70th birthday this autumn. But beyond the balloons, the bunting and the Ban 
Ki-moon speeches, there will be plenty of soul-searching about the future of 
the organisation.

Its centrepiece – the security council – appears increasingly incapable of 
delivering security: its peacekeepers can’t always keep the peace, its health 
body has been shown up by theEbola <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola> 
epidemic, while its refugee agency is struggling to deal with record numbers of 
people fleeing conflict or persecution.


And the UN itself has ballooned: 85,000 bureaucrats, an annual spend of about 
$40bn (£26bn) – 2,000 times that of the organisation’s budget during its first 
year in 1946. Spending has quadrupled in the past 20 years – and still several 
agencies struggle to balance their books.

What can be done? Over a period of three weeks this September, in the run-up 
to a crucial general assembly at the end of the month, and anticipating the 
birthday celebrations at the end of October, the Guardian is publishing a 
special series on the UN that focuses on its successes and failures.

In dispatches, films, interviews and data exercises, we examine how the UN 
became so big, what it is good at, where it is lacking and why it is so 
unaccountable. We speak to top officials and ousted whistleblowers, frontline 
staff and tax-free bureaucrats about reform, and whether the problem is the 
intransigence of member states or the bureaucracy itself.

There’s a game in which you can explore exactly what the UN has done for you. 
And we welcome reader insights, either alongside the work that we publish or at 
one of our live events.

It’s your UN. But is it working for you?
