That’s probably all you need to know from me for now. Thank you for joining us 
at Guardian Australia today, and throughout the season. It’s been a belter.

And it’s Eugene Galekovic who receives the trophy from the FFA chairman. He 
makes a little speech beforehand, referencing the perilous position of his team 
after round eight, and then eschews the traditional platform to join his 
team-mates in front of a perfect photo-op and hoists the golden toilet side 
into the air.

“Campiones, campiones ole ole ole!” rings out as golden confetti spurts out 
over the players.

Nikolai Topor-Stanley said a few words on behalf of his team. Poor bloke must 
be devastated.

Adelaide’s players now receiving their medals, Michael Marrone on crutches. 

Steven Lowy at the end of the presentation line looks a lot surer footed on 
the dais than his old man.

Joe Marston Medal - Isaias

This one was never in doubt from the moment the Spaniard’s free kick sent 
Adelaide two-nil up. His performance was more than just one swing of the boot 
though. Defensively he was vital, intercepting, tackling, disrupting. Going 
forward he kept Adelaide in motion, albeit without their regular fluency.

Summary

It was gripping, breathless, and not entirely according to script. Neither 
side really asserted their preferred playing style on the match but a 
marvellous spectacle ensued regardless.

Western Sydney Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/western-sydney-wanderers> gave their all 
but lacked composure in the final third to convert their rapid and frequent 
attacks into clear threats on goal. A third grand final goes begging for Tony 
Popovic.


After two previous grand final defeats Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united> finally tasted victory 
courtesy of two moments of first half brilliance. The second, from Isaias, was 
the standout incident of the game.


The best team of the home and away season were the best team in the finals. 
Congratulations Guillermo Amor and Adelaide United.

92 min: Adelaide Oval is rocking now. Victory is secured. The premiers become 
champions. They were made to work in the second half but they rode their luck 
and fought back in style.

GOAL! Adelaide United 3-1 Western Sydney Wanderers (Sanchez 90)

Game over! Pablo Sanchez seals it for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. An unerring strike past 
Redmayne inside the box. There was nothing on until the substitute robbed 
Baccus on the edge of the penalty area, strode forward and smashed home the 
winner.

89 min: Kamau remains Adelaide’s outlet on the break and he’s run his socks 
off to help his team hem the Wanderers in towards the right-hand corner flag. 
Not long left for the visitors now.

Redmayne’s left-hand post. Wanderers still pressing, still on top, but Adelaide 
resisting.

85 min: Baccus has done well since he came on and his crisp through ball 
reaches Castelen and he forces a corner. Dimas takes it and Topor-Stanley 
thumps a good header goalwards that’s dealt with by the safe hands of Galekovic.

Pablo Sanchez replaces Marcelo Carrusca for Adelaide. 

Shannon Cole is on for Scott Jamieson for Western Sydney.

81 min: Dimas the latest Wanderer into the book, probably more for his 
explosive reaction to being adjudged to have fouled Goodwin. Another chance for 
Adelaide to break up the play.

It almost leads to a goal too as Carrusca whips in a cross that Redmayne 
struggles to deal with. Kamau then goes to ground far too easily again and the 
Wanderers escape.

79 min: Pressure relieving corner for Adelaide and Carrusca milks the clock to 
stem the flow. The header from the dangerous delivery flies behind. Final 10

77 min: 88%-12% possession in favour of Western Sydney over the last five 
minutes. It hasn’t converted to goals yet though as another chance goes 
begging. This time Neville’s pullback trickles agonisingly through the Adelaide 
box.

Andreu off for Kearyn Baccus - second Wanderers substitution.

75 min: Adelaide can’t retain possession high up the field. Kamau the latest 
to be bullied off the ball. Consequently the ball keeps heading back at speed, 
carried by a man in white. Vidosic and Bridge are increasingly influential. 
Castelen is seeing plenty of the ball but he’s not been as penetrating as he 
was against Brisbane, so far...

73 min: Substitution for Adelaide. Elrich a more than handy replacement for 
the injured Marrone. Amor will presumably instruct the Socceroo to push his 
defence up the field. They are sliding further and further to wards Galekovic 
and inviting the Wanderers to attack them.

70 min: Disallowed goal for Adelaide! Corner from the right leads to a 
scramble and the ball ricochets its way in but the linesman’s flag is up for 
offside. It looks debatable. Cirio adjudged to be offside and interfering with 
play while he was on the ground nearby Redmayne. Replays confirm a brilliant 
call from the assistant referee. It took eagle eyes and bravery to make that 
call, credit where it’s due.

69 min: Backs to the wall by Adelaide. One punch away from a knockout just 10 
minutes ago, now they’re fighting to remain ahead.

Chances are coming at both ends though as the game stretches. Djite almost 
scores from a deep cross from the left but his header is repelled by Redmayne 
scrambling towards his far post. This is dynamic stuff now.

67 min: Another Wanderers attack leads to a half chance for Castelen and his 
volleyed effort forces a corner. Jamieson again can’t beat the first defender. 
Double forfeit for him for a second offence.

The full-back has a chance to redeem himself in open play but his first-time 
cross just eludes the leaping Santalab, the return ball finds Vidosic but he 
heads tamely towards Galekovic.

64 min: Vidosic is stationed on the left with Bridge occupying the number 10 
role vacated by Nichols. The change has worked too with pockets of space 
opening up all over the place.

The space is also there for Adelaide too and Cirio exploits it, speeding 
towards the Wanderers’ penalty area only to be met with a sumptuous tackle from 
Alberto. think Bobby Moore versus Pele in the 1970 World Cup.

61 min: Suddenly everything has changed. Wanderers are breaking through 
midfield at pace. Castelen the latest to fashion a chance. The energy levels 
have upped from the visitors and they’re somehow finding space where none could 
be located in the first half.

GOAL! Adelaide United 2-1 Western Sydney Wanderers (Neville 58)

Wallop! Out of nowhere the Wanderers have one back. A small period of pressure 
sees Castelen and Santalab link up well on the right and feed Scott Neville to 
smash home his first goal for the club, arrowing one across Galekovic into the 
top corner.

The comeback is on again!

56 min: When Western Sydney look like mounting an attack a red shirt always 
seems to be in the right place at the right time. Both full-backs have made 
telling tackles and Isaias is shepherding everything at the base of midfield. 
It would take something special to deny the Spaniard the Joe Marston Medal 
you’d think.

Vidosic on - Nichols off. Popovic has made his first move (maybe he’s been 
reading this blog?).

52 min: Good example of Amor’s tactical success. Goodwin forcing Castelen to 
defend in his own corner, not once but twice, and eventually Djite spins in the 
box to fire in a shot that runs out for a corner. Not a great sign for Popovic 
if that head to head down the Western Sydney right is in such defensive 
territory.

49 min: During the interval the lights took hold at Adelaide Oval and the 
glare and shadows of the first half are no more.

All Adelaide in these opening exchanges, Redmayne forced into another save, 
this time from Cirio, after a good move down the right. Jamieson is unimpressed 
and whacks Isaias to become the third Wanderer in Gillett’s notebook.

47 min: No changes from either coach at the break. 

The second period begins at a much more acceptable pace than the first. United 
take advantage and Mauk shoots from distance forcing a save from Redmayne.

I know you’re all thinking, “what would Howcroft do at half-time?” Well, funny 
you should ask.

If I was Amor, I’d do very little. I’d probably tell Mauk to sit closer to 
Isaias and not allow Western Sydney to overrun them in midfield.

If I was Popovic I’d give this XI 10 minutes to show more composure in the 
final third before bringing Vidosic on in the playmaker role and invite him to 
prove me wrong.

Did I get enough odd first/third person mix-ups in their? Good, on with the 
show!

There’s only one stat that matters, and that’s the one on the glorious old 
scoreboard behind the goalAdelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united> found twice.

I think that shows contested possessions anyway, my eyesight’s not great.

Half-time: Adelaide United 2-0 Western Sydney Wanderers

A decisive first half for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. A feisty contest 
without much composure changed after 22 minutes when Kamau finished off 
Carrusca’s good work. One of the all-time grand final highlights followed 12 
minutes later with Isaias’ free kick putting daylight between the best two 
teams in the A-League.

Wanderers have looked lively, getting behind United on a number of occasions 
but their final ball has been disappointing. Plenty for Popovic to think about 
during the interval.

45 min: What should Popovic do? And when?

He’ll welcome half-time and a chance to tell Castelen to be more direct. Again 
the winger dithers after he’d looked like he’d beaten his man.

Two minutes of stoppage time.

43 min: The ball is hot again in midfield, neither side owning it for any 
length of time. When Adelaide do string passes together they look dangerous 
though, almost getting in behind Jamieson.

41 min: Chances for Adelaide. Isaias is starting to run the midfield and his 
trickery feeds Djite and his power creates space in the area but his cross 
fails to hit its target, Mauk shooting over from the clearance.

Andreu the second name in the book for a bad foul on Djite.

39 min: Wanderers are still creating half chances but their composure is

36 min: That was a strike befitting the venue and the occasion. Nothing

GOAL! Adelaide United 2-0 Western Sydney Wanderers (Isaias 34)

Isaias steps up, wraps his right boot around the ball and sends it arcing over 
the wall, past the post, and into the side netting of Redmayne’s goal. 
Centimetre perfect from the Spaniard.

33 min: Kamau tripped on the edge of the D by Topor-Stanley. First yellow card 
of the game and a free-kick in a very dangerous situation.

31 min: Suggestions the ball’s bobbling a little on the Adelaide Oval surface. 
Not that Castelen seems to mind, dribbling with purpose past Goodwin and into 
the box. A corner results that again fails to beat the first man, Dimas the 
culprit.

An immediate corner is much better and loops to the edge of the six yard box 
in the centre of goal but Santalab can’t steer his stooping header on target. 
ONe of those chances that looks tough at full speed but wasteful in slow motion.

29 min: It’s now Western Sydney that are attacking with speed, Adelaide more 
methodical in possession, defending their lead. The visitors look like creating 
chances when they break but the final ball has so far evaded their forward 
targets. Neither side really operating as you might have imagined pregame. Both 
midfields pressuring the six role, forcing the fullbacks to play the first 
release pass.

26 min: Chance for Wanderers! Excellent breakaway down the left and the cross 
just eludes the diving Santalab at the far post. This has livened up nicely in 
recent minutes.

Amor can feel satisfied with Kamau’s goal. Had he opted to select Elrich at 
left-back, Kamau would have been the likely started shuffled out.

24 min: An early home goal is perfect for the spectacle. The Wanderers were 
disrupting play successfully in the early exchanges, now they’ll have to commit 
to attacking.

By the way, that’s the second fastest grand final goal and just the sixth 
first-half effort in the decider.

Adelaide United crowned A-League champions after grand final win over Western 
Sydney

That’s probably all you need to know from me for now. Thank you for joining us 
at Guardian Australia today, and throughout the season. It’s been a belter.
 
And it’s Eugene Galekovic who receives the trophy from the FFA chairman. He 
makes a little speech beforehand, referencing the perilous position of his team 
after round eight, and then eschews the traditional platform to join his 
team-mates in front of a perfect photo-op and hoists the golden toilet side 
into the air.

“Campiones, campiones ole ole ole!” rings out as golden confetti spurts out 
over the players.

Nikolai Topor-Stanley said a few words on behalf of his team. Poor bloke must 
be devastated.

Adelaide’s players now receiving their medals, Michael Marrone on crutches. 

Steven Lowy at the end of the presentation line looks a lot surer footed on 
the dais than his old man.
 
This one was never in doubt from the moment the Spaniard’s free kick sent 
Adelaide two-nil up. His performance was more than just one swing of the boot 
though. Defensively he was vital, intercepting, tackling, disrupting. Going 
forward he kept Adelaide in motion, albeit without their regular fluency.

It was gripping, breathless, and not entirely according to script. Neither 
side really asserted their preferred playing style on the match but a 
marvellous spectacle ensued regardless.

Western Sydney Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/western-sydney-wanderers> gave their all 
but lacked composure in the final third to convert their rapid and frequent 
attacks into clear threats on goal. A third grand final goes begging for Tony 
Popovic.


After two previous grand final defeats Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united> finally tasted victory 
courtesy of two moments of first half brilliance. The second, from Isaias, was 
the standout incident of the game.


The best team of the home and away season were the best team in the finals. 
Congratulations Guillermo Amor and Adelaide United.

and fought back in style.
 
Game over! Pablo Sanchez seals it for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. An unerring strike past

90 min: A minimum of three minutes of added time to be played. 
 
89 min: Kamau remains Adelaide’s outlet on the break and he’s run his socks 
off to help his team hem the Wanderers in towards the right-hand corner flag. 
Not long left for the visitors now.
 
87 min: Mauk fires in a snapshot from the edge of the box that fizzes past 
Redmayne’s left-hand post. Wanderers still pressing, still on top, but Adelaide 
resisting.

85 min: Baccus has done well since he came on and his crisp through ball 
reaches Castelen and he forces a corner. Dimas takes it and Topor-Stanley 
thumps a good header goalwards that’s dealt with by the safe hands of Galekovic.

Pablo Sanchez replaces Marcelo Carrusca for Adelaide. 

Shannon Cole is on for Scott Jamieson for Western Sydney.
 
81 min: Dimas the latest Wanderer into the book, probably more for his 
explosive reaction to being adjudged to have fouled Goodwin. Another chance for 
Adelaide to break up the play.

It almost leads to a goal too as Carrusca whips in a cross that Redmayne 
struggles to deal with. Kamau then goes to ground far too easily again and the 
Wanderers escape.

Kalisz/Getty Images  
79 min: Pressure relieving corner for Adelaide and Carrusca milks the clock to 
stem the flow. The header from the dangerous delivery flies behind. Final 10 
minutes of a gripping game.
 
77 min: 88%-12% possession in favour of Western Sydney over the last five 
minutes. It hasn’t converted to goals yet though as another chance goes 
begging. This time Neville’s pullback trickles agonisingly through the Adelaide 
box.

Andreu off for Kearyn Baccus - second Wanderers substitution. 
 
75 min: Adelaide can’t retain possession high up the field. Kamau the latest 
to be bullied off the ball. Consequently the ball keeps heading back at speed, 
carried by a man in white. Vidosic and Bridge are increasingly influential. 
Castelen is seeing plenty of the ball but he’s not been as penetrating as he 
was against Brisbane, so far...
 
73 min: Substitution for Adelaide. Elrich a more than handy replacement for 
the injured Marrone. Amor will presumably instruct the Socceroo to push his 
defence up the field. They are sliding further and further to wards Galekovic 
and inviting the Wanderers to attack them.
 
72 min: Proper cup tie stuff now. The crowd at fever pitch. Adelaide panicky 
in possession. Wanderers pressing. Glorious theatre.
 
70 min: Disallowed goal for Adelaide! Corner from the right leads to a 
scramble and the ball ricochets its way in but the linesman’s flag is up for 
offside. It looks debatable. Cirio adjudged to be offside and interfering with 
play while he was on the ground nearby Redmayne. Replays confirm a brilliant 
call from the assistant referee. It took eagle eyes and bravery to make that 
call, credit where it’s due.
 
69 min: Backs to the wall by Adelaide. One punch away from a knockout just 10 
minutes ago, now they’re fighting to remain ahead.

Chances are coming at both ends though as the game stretches. Djite almost 
scores from a deep cross from the left but his header is repelled by Redmayne 
scrambling towards his far post. This is dynamic stuff now.
 
67 min: Another Wanderers attack leads to a half chance for Castelen and his 
volleyed effort forces a corner. Jamieson again can’t beat the first defender. 
Double forfeit for him for a second offence.

The full-back has a chance to redeem himself in open play but his first-time 
cross just eludes the leaping Santalab, the return ball finds Vidosic but he 
heads tamely towards Galekovic.
 
64 min: Vidosic is stationed on the left with Bridge occupying the number 10 
role vacated by Nichols. The change has worked too with pockets of space 
opening up all over the place.

The space is also there for Adelaide too and Cirio exploits it, speeding 
towards the Wanderers’ penalty area only to be met with a sumptuous tackle from 
Alberto. think Bobby Moore versus Pele in the 1970 World Cup.
 
It’s a full house...

61 min: Suddenly everything has changed. Wanderers are breaking through 
midfield at pace. Castelen the latest to fashion a chance. The energy levels 
have upped from the visitors and they’re somehow finding space where none could 
be located in the first half.

Wallop! Out of nowhere the Wanderers have one back. A small period of pressure 
sees Castelen and Santalab link up well on the right and feed Scott Neville to 
smash home his first goal for the club, arrowing one across Galekovic into the 
top corner.

The comeback is on again!

Kalisz/Getty Images  
56 min: When Western Sydney look like mounting an attack a red shirt always 
seems to be in the right place at the right time. Both full-backs have made 
telling tackles and Isaias is shepherding everything at the base of midfield. 
It would take something special to deny the Spaniard the Joe Marston Medal 
you’d think.

Vidosic on - Nichols off. Popovic has made his first move (maybe he’s been 
reading this blog?).
 
54 min: The visitors are on the ropes. Adelaide are relentless. Attack after 
attack since half-time met with nervous clearances. Can United deliver the 
knockout blow?
 
52 min: Good example of Amor’s tactical success. Goodwin forcing Castelen to 
defend in his own corner, not once but twice, and eventually Djite spins in the 
box to fire in a shot that runs out for a corner. Not a great sign for Popovic 
if that head to head down the Western Sydney right is in such defensive 
territory.

49 min: During the interval the lights took hold at Adelaide Oval and the 
glare and shadows of the first half are no more.

All Adelaide in these opening exchanges, Redmayne forced into another save, 
this time from Cirio, after a good move down the right. Jamieson is unimpressed 
and whacks Isaias to become the third Wanderer in Gillett’s notebook.
 
47 min: No changes from either coach at the break. 

The second period begins at a much more acceptable pace than the first. United 
take advantage and Mauk shoots from distance forcing a save from Redmayne.
 
Second half underway at Adelaide Oval.

I know you’re all thinking, “what would Howcroft do at half-time?” Well, funny 
you should ask.

If I was Amor, I’d do very little. I’d probably tell Mauk to sit closer to 
Isaias and not allow Western Sydney to overrun them in midfield.

If I was Popovic I’d give this XI 10 minutes to show more composure in the 
final third before bringing Vidosic on in the playmaker role and invite him to 
prove me wrong.

Did I get enough odd first/third person mix-ups in their? Good, on with the 
show!

There’s only one stat that matters, and that’s the one on the glorious old 
scoreboard behind the goalAdelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united> found twice.

I think that shows contested possessions anyway, my eyesight’s not great.
 
A decisive first half for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. A feisty contest 
without much composure changed after 22 minutes when Kamau finished off 
Carrusca’s good work. One of the all-time grand final highlights followed 12 
minutes later with Isaias’ free kick putting daylight between the best two 
teams in the A-League.

Wanderers have looked lively, getting behind United on a number of occasions 
but their final ball has been disappointing. Plenty for Popovic to think about 
during the interval.
 
45 min: What should Popovic do? And when?

He’ll welcome half-time and a chance to tell Castelen to be more direct. Again 
the winger dithers after he’d looked like he’d beaten his man.

Two minutes of stoppage time. 
 
43 min: The ball is hot again in midfield, neither side owning it for any 
length of time. When Adelaide do string passes together they look dangerous 
though, almost getting in behind Jamieson.
 
41 min: Chances for Adelaide. Isaias is starting to run the midfield and his 
trickery feeds Djite and his power creates space in the area but his cross 
fails to hit its target, Mauk shooting over from the clearance.

Andreu the second name in the book for a bad foul on Djite.
 
39 min: Wanderers are still creating half chances but their composure is 
letting them down, Castelen this time not appraising the situation effectively.

36 min: That was a strike befitting the venue and the occasion. Nothing 
Redmayne could do about it. Can the Wanderers get out of jail again? It will be 
much harder against the league’s best defence.

Isaias steps up, wraps his right boot around the ball and sends it arcing over 
the wall, past the post, and into the side netting of Redmayne’s goal. 
Centimetre perfect from the Spaniard.
 
33 min: Kamau tripped on the edge of the D by Topor-Stanley. First yellow card 
of the game and a free-kick in a very dangerous situation.
 
31 min: Suggestions the ball’s bobbling a little on the Adelaide Oval surface. 
Not that Castelen seems to mind, dribbling with purpose past Goodwin and into 
the box. A corner results that again fails to beat the first man, Dimas the 
culprit.

An immediate corner is much better and loops to the edge of the six yard box 
in the centre of goal but Santalab can’t steer his stooping header on target. 
ONe of those chances that looks tough at full speed but wasteful in slow motion.

29 min: It’s now Western Sydney that are attacking with speed, Adelaide more 
methodical in possession, defending their lead. The visitors look like creating 
chances when they break but the final ball has so far evaded their forward 
targets. Neither side really operating as you might have imagined pregame. Both 
midfields pressuring the six role, forcing the fullbacks to play the first 
release pass.

26 min: Chance for Wanderers! Excellent breakaway down the left and the cross 
just eludes the diving Santalab at the far post. This has livened up nicely in 
recent minutes.

Amor can feel satisfied with Kamau’s goal. Had he opted to select Elrich at 
left-back, Kamau would have been the likely started shuffled out.
 
24 min: An early home goal is perfect for the spectacle. The Wanderers were 
disrupting play successfully in the early exchanges, now they’ll have to commit
