Final thoughts

Well, it's been a long night and there's not a lot that needs to be said. It 
started out tense and ended as a laugher. On a night where neither starter was 
effective, the Dodgers bats crushed the Braves bullpen and now Atlanta might 
have to turn to Freddy Garcia, on the the road, tomorrow night to keep their 
season alive just one more day. Plus, with Miguel Cabrera clearly limited by 
injuries, L.A. might have the best hitter in the playoffs with Hanley Ramirez 
and they still have the best starting pitcher in the league in their back 
pocket. So yeah, this could be a scary team this October.
That will wrap up tonight's coverage of the MLB 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> playoffs, but we'll be back tomorrow as 
the Divisonal Series continue. Thanks to everyone who followed along with us 
tonight, especially those who contributed emails and tweets (sorry I couldn't 
fit them all in). Ciao!

5.14am BST 

Dodgers take 2-1 series lead in the NLDS!

And the Braves are a game away from yet another early playoff exit.

Dodgers 13 - Braves 6, FINAL

"Paco" by Ladytron > Paco Rodriguez. Here comes Kenley Jansen to get the final 
out with runners on the corner. He gets Brian McCann to strike out and that's 
the game! Dodgers win!

5.07am BST 

Braves 6 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

Rodriguez gets Evan Gettis in a 0-2 hole but Gettis hits a sharp single and 
the Dodgers might have to... Oh here comes Mattingly. Looking like the Braves 
have forced the Dodgers to use their closer. Pyrrhic victory?

Updated at 5.08am BST

5.04am BST 

Braves 6 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

Here's Freddie Freeman, the man with the fakest sounding birth name in the 
majors. Paco strikes hime out and now the Dodgers are one out away from a 2-1 
NLDS lead.

5.03am BST 

Braves 6 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

Paco Rodriguez then walks Justin Upton and we're seeing exactly why he's the 
low-leverage guy on the roster. Closer Kenley Jansen is warming up just in 
case, although L.A. probably won't want to use him.

4.59am BST 

HOME RUN! Braves 6 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

Jason Heyward, for one, isn't giving up he hits a two-run gatbage time home 
run that is positively A-Rodian.

4.57am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

Reed Johnson comes in to game to pinch-hit in the pitcher's spot, because 
there are clearly not enough people named Johnson on the box score already. He 
gets a single that Nick Punto couldn't do anything with. Six or seven more of 
those and this game might be interesting.

4.55am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 13, top of the 9th

NICK PUNTO APPEARANCE AT SHIRT! This one is officially over. Paco Rodrgiuez is 
out to get the last three outs of the game, he gets Elliot Johnson to fly out 
for out one.

4.51am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 13, bottom of the 8th

That ended Avilan's night, so much for my "last bullpen move" prediction, as 
Gonzalez replaces him with David Hale as Dodger Stadium blasts "Hit the Road 
Jack". Hale gets Uribe to ground out to finally end this inning.

4.48am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 13, bottom of the 8th

Hanley Ramirez scores from second on a Puig single and now the Dodgers are one 
run away from a two-touchdown night.

4.45am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 12, bottom of the 8th

Luis Avilan is up to face Adrian Gonzalez. Gonzalez hits a single to score 
Mark Ellis and the Dodgers are two runs away from a two touchdown game.

Updated at 4.46am BST

4.40am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 11, bottom of the 8th

Hanley Ramirez hits a long single, scoring Carl Crawford from second. Remember 
when this was a close game? That will end Walden's night as Gonzalez goes to 
his bullpen one last, desperate time.

4.37am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 8th

That Other Ellis takes a walk, which brings up Hanley Ramirez.

4.34am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 8th

Carl Crawford, player of the night unless the Dodgers come up with an 
unspeakable Texas Rangery collapse, steps in and hits into a force that erases 
A.J. Ellis.

4.32am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 8th

Big cheer as the hurting Andre Ethier is announced as a pinch-hitter in the 
pitcher's spot, try to say that five times fast. No Kirk Gibson-y home run for 
the beat up their, he strikes out.

Walden hits A.J. Ellis on the elbow and he's going to stay in the game and 
takes his base.

4.27am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 8th

Simmons grounds out. The Braves will have three outs to get six runs if they 
want to win this one. No biggie right?
Elena V (@amariselv) 
@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> Looks like it won't be an issue,

Good question. At this point it would be less worrying about the pitcher and 
just whether he'd be the most effective option. Now if Kershaw on short rest 
was available for the Braves they'd go with him over Freddy Garcia.

4.23am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 8th

The fake chants continue. Ronald Belisario comes into the game and gets Chris 
Johnson to strike out swinging.

4.20am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 8th

Howell's back out for the start of the 8th, he gets Brian McCann to hit a fly, 
and Carl Crawford makes a running catch to make the catch, his momentum pushing 
him over the wall. A highlight reel play. That's one down and Don Mattingly 
decides to delve back into his bullpen.

The difference between doing the Braves Chop and drinking Miller Lite is that

that quality.

4.13am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 7th

Walden follows the Puig groundout by striking out Juan Uribe and getting 
Schumaker to hit one towards Simmons and that inning is already over.

4.10am BST

Jordan Walden enters the game for Atlanta and gets Puig to ground out to 
second.

Reminder that this is the only tolerable version of "God Bless America".

4.04am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 7th

Wait, wait, the Braves seriously might start Freddy Garcia next game? That 
wasn't a joke? As if this weren't enough of a must-win game for Atlanta to 
begin with. Which is not good for them, especially since Howell strikes out 
Gattis and they only have six outs left to play with.

4.00am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 7th

Justin Upton grounds out, but Howell can't retire Freeman. After getting him 
down 0-2, Freeman hits a single.

3.57am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 7th

Alert: Vin Scully is back.

Chris Capuano is not. The Dodgers go with left-handed reliever and occasional 
forced "Gilligan's Island" joke starts the seventh, and he starts his night 
with a strikeout of Heyward.

3.55am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 6th

Elliot Johnson dives for a Gonzalez line drive and throws it to Simmons at 
short for an inning-ending double play. Not entirely unimpressive.

Roger Kirkby:

Er Hunter, his era comes from Pitching, not fielding, his fielding stats are 
only accountable in metrics

Sure, but the fact that stat doesn't count any of the terrible, terrible 
pitching that he did after he failed to make the play because the inning should 
have been over is just... Very "Get Out Of Jail Free". If I were a pitcher I'd 
think about deliberately making errors to protect the crispness of my ERA.

3.50am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 6th

Luis Ayala is the new pitcher for the Braves, and he gets Mark (almost 
confident here) Ellis to strike out. Now here comes the man of the hour, Hanley 
Ramirez who works a full count. He fouls a ball of his foot, always a squirmy 
moment, and on the eleventh pitch he finagles a walk.
David Lengel (@LengelDavid)

It surprised me when I heard that this was Ramirez's first postseason 
appearance and then I remembered, you know, Marlins.

3.43am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 6th

Alex Wood is done. He allowed four runs but it doesn't affect his ERA because 
they were unearned runs because of the error HE HIMSELF COMMITTED.Baseball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball> is dumb.

3.40am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 6th

Capuano was missing with his spot, falling behind 3-0 on Elliot Johnson, but 
he managed to rally back and get Johnson to hit into a double play to clear the 
bases for B.J. Upton, truly the Eric Roberts of the baseball world, 
pinch-hitting for Alex Wood. Capuano strikes out B.J. Upton on what seems like 
two pitches, that's how bad he looked.

3.36am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 6th

Andrelton Simmons starts the 6th for the Braves by taking a four pitch walk 
issued by Capuano.

Fans at Dodger Stadium have been mocking the Tomahawk Chop, which I have two 
minds about a) The Chop is both horrifically awful and at best insensitive but 
b) I'm not sure it's that much better to do the Chop "ironically".

Updated at 3.40am BST

3.30am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 5th

Alex Wood is back for the fifth. I am starting a petition to make it illegal 
for A.J. Ellis and Mark Ellis to be on the same roster because I will always 
guess the wrong one. In any case, A.J. (or at least I'm fairly sure it's A.J.) 
flies out, Capuano grounds out because NL and Carl Crawford strikes out to end 
the inning. This game has certainly shifted gears.

3.24am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 5th

Capuano gets Gattis to strike out for the first out of the inning. Brian 
McCann grounds into a fielder's choice, a nifty play from Mark Ellis to Hanley 
Ramirez to force Freeman at second for the second out and then Chris Johnson 
grounds out to Ramirez to end an inning that lasted about as long as than Evan 
Gattis at-bat a few innings ago.

3.17am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, top of the 5th

Capuano falls behind Freddie Freeman 3-0 and, after getting two strikes, he 
issues a free pass, not the thing you want to do with a large lead.

Roger Kirkby on the lateness of the hour quotes some vintage Serling:

'"There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a 
dimension as vast as space and timeless as extra innings. It is the middle 
reliever ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and 
it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is 
the dimension of imagination. It is an area we call the Twilight Zone."

3.13am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 4th

And Schumaker grounds out to end the inning, but the Braves... well they have 
to hope for a Dodgers bullpen implosion if they want to steal this one.

HOME RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 10, bottom of the 4th

Juan Uribe hits an opposite field home run! This is going to be a long night 
folks, even those of you on the West Coast.

3.09am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 8, bottom of the 4th

It doesn't matter, Puig hits a selfish RBI to draw attention to himself and 
make a mockery of the sacred traditions of baseball.

3.08am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 7, bottom of the 4th

Wood streaks out Adrian Gonzalez so Ramirez won't be able to score from third 
on an out.

3.04am BST 

RUN SCORING TRIPLE! Braves 4 - Dodgers 7, bottom of the 4th

Holy fucking heck, Hanley Ramirez hits a triple to drive in Crawford. Still 
just one out. How f'ing awesome has he been this year?

Updated at 3.07am BST

3.03am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 6, bottom of the 4th

Carl Crawford leads off the bottom of the 4th inning against Alex Wood by 
beating out a bunt attempt thanks to Wood's miscue. Mark Ellis is up next, and 
he nearly gets hit. Wood's showing some serious control problems, but 
considering he's a young player in the postseason for the first time, it's to 
be expected. Ellis hits a harmless fly for the first out of the inning.

Updated at 3.07am BST

2.58am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 6, top of the 4th

Capuano, who as a converted starter might be in the game for a bit, gets 
Justin Heyward to pop one sky-high to Schumaker in centerfield and then strikes 
out Justin Upton to end the inning. That went a bit faster than the last one.

Elliot Johnson to second base. National League baseball everyone!

2.50am BST

Chris Capuano is in for the Dodgers to face Elliot "No You're Thinking Of

Entirely possible. It is officially a bullpen game now.

2.46am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 6, bottom of the 3rd

Ryu's night is over as well, Michael Young is "hitting" in the pitcher's spot 
in the order with Alex Wood on the mound for Atlanta. He falls into an 0-2 
count but then Wood uncorks a wild pitch in the dirt and the Dodgers runners 
move up to second and third. Of course, since Michael Young would have been out 
of baseball years ago if he hadn't hypnotized so many baseball people in 
believing he has magical clubhouse powers... he strikes out to finally end the 
third.

2.38am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 6, bottom of the 3rd

The Dodgers have decided they don't want this third inning to end so we get 
more Vin Scully. Uribe strikes out but A.J. Ellis hits a single and now it's 
runners on first and second with two outs and Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez is 
taking Teheran out of the game.

Updated at 4.44am BST

2.35am BST

At the moment he's only under contract to do AL games. He's not much of a

2.31am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 5, bottom of the 3rd

And here comes Puig, he hits what could have been a double play ball to Chris 
Johnson but Gonzalez takes out Elliot Johnson at second, so his throw to first 
is wild. Puig is safe at first and then makes it to second on the throwing 
errors.

Absolutely. You take the outs that they give you, there's some thought that 
Ryu forgot it wasn't a bases loaded situation anymore. Not been a crisp game 
for either side really.

2.27am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 5, bottom of the 3rd

Adrian Gonzalez hits a single and Ramirez zips into home plate to immediately 
break the tie.

2.26am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 4, bottom of the 3rd

Ryu is now at 68 pitches, it doesn't look like either starter will be out 
there for very long. Hanley Ramirez hits a ball exactly where the shifted 
fielders weren't for a double.

I'm usually so reserved.

2.22am BST 

Braves 4 - Dodgers 4, top of the 3rd

Simmons, mercifully for Ryu, hits into a double play to end the inning but the 
Braves have tied this one up.

2.21am BST 

RUN! Braves 4 - Dodgers 4, top of the 3rd

Chris Johnson, from my hometown of Naples it appears, is up next, hitting one 
back to Ryu who decides to throw to home plate where he has no play. Freeman 
scores and there's still only one out.

Updated at 2.21am BST

2.17am BST 

RUN! Braves 3 - Dodgers 4, top of the 3rd

Vin Scully points out that Braves catcher Brian McCann is from Athens, and now 
I want him to come to the plate to R.E.M.'s "Talk About The Passion". He works 
a full count with the bases loaded. The next pitch? McCann fouls off. He's 
gotta be thinking "not this again". McCann hit into a double play... Oh nope, 
Ryu can't make it to the first on time so the Braves only get one out, Gattis, 
and Upton scores from third. Freeman's now on third.

Updated at 2.22am BST

2.13am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 4, top of the 3rd

Evan Gattis is up next, and he fouls off like a gazillion Ryu offerings (11 
pitches, 7 foul balls to be more precise). On the 12th pitch, Gattis hits one 
in front of Schumaker that loads the bases without any outs.
Richie Owens (@richiemetsoh) 
@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> Puig just stood at 2nd and 
watched Schumaker strike out. Just stood there. As if he didn't care. McCann

This would be a bit more outrageous if there weren't a huge contingency of Red 
Sox fans who have frothing-at-the-mouth levels of anger towards J.D. Drew

at-bat.

2.07am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 4, top of the 3rd

Freddie Freeman comes up and almost immediately singles, Puig is able to get 
to the ball quickly and hit cut-off man Ramirez. What an entitled loafer, 
Mattingly should bench him for the remainder of the playoffs.

2.04am BST

That's a two-run homer from Carl Crawford and Teheran's long second inning 
gets longer. It's okay thought, because Steve Lyons tells me that pitchers 
would rather allow home runs than pitch with runners on base. Mark "No You're 
Thinking Of A.J." Ellis strikes out to end the inning but it was a huge one for 
L.A..

1.57am BST 

HOME RUN! Braves 2 - Dodgers 4, bottom of the 2nd

Vin just called Ryu "byung hyun kim" which makes me feel a little better about 
the Puig thing, even legends can make mis- OH MY GOD CRAWFORD JUST CRUSHED THAT!

1.55am BST 

RUN! Braves 2 - Dodgers 1, bottom of the 2nd

And he does! Ryu hits a long flyball that scores Puig and Uribe takes to third!

1.53am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 2nd

With one down, A.J. "No You're Thinking Of Mark" Ellis is up next and he works 
a full count off of Teheran and then takes ball four to load the bases for Ryu, 
giving tonight's starter the chance to give himself some run support.

1.48am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 2nd

Skip Schumaker, who will be playing the part of Nick Punto tonight, strikes 
out on a controversial strike call (according to the bleacher refs).

1.46am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 2nd

With Uribe at the bat, Teheran tries to pick off Puig who makes it back just 
in time. On the very next itch, Uribe hits a single to puts runners on first 
and second and no outs.
Craig Calcaterra (@craigcalcaterra) 
Puig almost, but not quite, thrown out at first. Plaschke, Miller, Morosi all 
mad that they didn't get a chance to make An Important Point.

1.43am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 2nd

Yasiel Puig, who I keep calling Yunel after covering three straight Tampa Bay 
Rays games, is up next. I don't know what's more exciting: Seeing what Puig 
will do next or seeing how hysterical scolds in the media spin it to make him 
the World's Biggest Monster.

Puig hits a solid single, probably by Playing The Game The Wrong Way.

1.38am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, top of the 2nd

Ryu strikes out his counterpart Teheran, and seriously pitcher strikeouts 
should only count as, like, half of a strikeout in the record books. Justin 
Heyward than flies out to end of the inning.

1.36am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, top of the 2nd

Elliot Johnson is up for the Braves, and he weakly grounds out to Hanley at 
short.

Email from Roger Kirkby:

So after all the teams have used their 'ace' pitchers in games one and two, we 
now enter The Twilight Zone that is postseason baseball (note the Pirates score 
earlier). ANYTHING can happen and probably will from here on out. That's why we 
all suffer this game

You could do a lot worse for number three starters than Teharan and Ryu, Ask 
the Minnesota Twins.

I completely support this idea.

1.31am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 1st

Carl Crawford, Hanley Ramirez and now Adrian Gonzalez. Once upon a time all of 
these players were supposed to be longtime Red Sox fixtures. Funny how that 
works. Adrian Gonzalez strikes out and the Dodgers don't even get Crawford to 
second. Vin disapproves.

1.29am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 1st

Here's Hanley Ramirez, the biggest reason that the Dodgers were able to turn 
their season around after an Anaheim Angels-esque start. Puig, the exciting 
rookie received the most attention but Ramirez has clearly been their best 
player since returning from injury (which happened right when the Dodgers 
started to click). If it weren't for the days on the DL, Ramirez would have a 
solid NL MVP case. All he does here is hit a lazy fly here, so Crawford is 
still on second with two outs.

1.26am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 1st

"There's Ellis in a familiar 0-2..." Ah I love Vin Scully, Mark Ellis swings 
out on three pitches to make the first out of the game.

1.25am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 1st

And two batters in, Teheran throws a wild pitch and the speedy Crawford easily 
makes it to second. So not the cleanest start for the rookies making their 
postseason debut.

1.24am BST 

Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, bottom of the 1st

The Dodgers start the bottom of the first inning with a Carl Crawford base hit 
off of Teheran.

1.22am BST 

PSA!

MLB.com, if you have a subscription, has the Vin Scully radio broadcast of the 
game available live. I strongly recommend muting the TBS chatterers and heading 
there, even if it doesn't really synch with the images.

1.21am BST 

RUN! Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

The first inning ends with Simmons popping out to second. That was a rough 
first inning for the Dodgers, Ryu didn't look too sharp. Good things most 
Dodgers fans probably haven't yet reached the stadium

1.19am BST 

RUN! Braves 2 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

Now Chris Johnson hits a solid single off of Ryu, singling in Gattis. This is 
not a good start for the Dodgers.

1.16am BST 

Braves 1 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

Brian McCann is up and he has a pretty solid at-bat that results in a walk, 
and now it's runners on first and second.

1.15am BST 

RUN! Braves 1 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

And Evan Gattis singles in Upton and Atlanta already has a run here .

Updated at 1.15am BST

1.14am BST 

Braves 0 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

Freddie Freeman, who Braves fans adorably think should be in the MVP 
conversation, hits a flyball, Upton can't advance on it and it's two down.

1.12am BST 

Braves 0 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

Justin Upton, the Michael to B.J.'s Jermaine is up next, and he hits one to 
right center that Schumaker can't get to it and Upton's on second for the first 
hit of the night.

1.10am BST 

Braves 0 - Dodgers 0, Top of the 1st

And we're off! Heyward grounds out to Ramirez on three pitches.

1.05am BST 

Injuries

One advantage that the Braves will have in this series is that they're 
relatively healthy, while the Dodgers are dealing with injuries to the 
won't-be-back Matt Kemp (who should have been the MVP in the year Ryan Braun 
won, PEDs or not), Andre Either and (the deepest cut of them all) Nick Punto.

I'm not really superstitious about very many sports things but I completely 
believe in the Atlanta pro sports curse. Braves, Hawks, Falcons... I always 
predict that they get eliminated in the first round. So, I'm going with the 
Dodgers here, both in the series and in the game. Maybe 4-3 Dodgers victory?

Pirates win!

There was just one other game in the MLB Playoffs tonight and that would be 
NLDS Game 3 between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals, which 
has just wrapped up with the Pirates beating the Cardinals 5-3. So, yeah, the 
Pirates have a 2-1 series lead in the Playoffs. No I don't understand anything 
anymore either.

Preamble

The National League Divisional Series between the Atlanta Braves and the Los 
Angeles Dodgers is basically an '80s slobs vs. snobs movie where the rich kids 
are the slobs. While the Atlanta Braves have been busy trying to enforce 
violations of unwritten rules. The Dodgers have taken on the personality of 
their two best hitters, controversial Cuban phenom Yasiel Puig and rejuvenated 
former Marlins infielder Hanley Ramirez. When the Dodgers celebrated clinching 
their playoff spotby sneaking into the Arizona Diamondbacks' pool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/dodgers-diamondbacks-pool-texas-rangers-slide>
 it was as if a season that started off like the "Bad News Bears" in a bad way, 
when the Dodgers had an atrocious beginning of the season that almost got 
manager Don Mattingly fired, entered into the zany winning montage portion of 
the movie.

Meanwhile the Atlanta Braves have been acting like their duty is is to police 
the many, many unwritten rules around baseball, possibly ones that only exist 
in their heads. The absolute nadir of this tendency happened during a few weeks 
span late last month when Braves catcher Brian McCann helped incite two 
separate fights: first after getting upset atMarlins pitcher Jose Fernandez 
after he was a bit too excited for hitting his first career home run 
<http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-jose-fernandez-hits-first-career-home-022103628--mlb.html>
, whenhe attempted to block the Milwaukee Brewers' Carlos Gomez from reaching 
home plate on a home run. 
<http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-atlanta-carlos-gomez-homers-argues-braves-235815900--mlb.html>
Some are starting to suspect that in his version of baseball, hitting home runs 
against his team is a violation of the unwritten rules of the MLB.

So these two teams are designed to be perfect contrasts to one another, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-divisional-series-previews>
 so it's no big shock that the NLDS is coming to Dodgers Stadium tied up at 1-1 
after a dramatic game two on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/05/pirates-braves-cardinals-angels-playoffs>
. Tonight it's a battle of rookie pitchers with similar regular season records 
as the Braves put 22 year old Julio Teheran (14-8, 3.20) on the mound against 
26 year old South Korean import Hyun-Jin Ryu (14-8, 3.00). Okay, it's a bit of 
a cheat to call Ryu a rookie since he's been playing professional baseball for 
a while but, hey, Ichiro Suzuki won a Rookie of the Year when he arrived in the 
MLB.

So today's the tiebreaker game, it should be good. Remember that we will be 
using your questions, comments, jokes, and predictions throughout tonight's 
liveblog. You can either email them to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com> or you can tweet @HunterFelt 
<http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt>. It's the Atlanta Braves vs. the Los 
Angeles Dodgers <http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/preview?gameId=331006119> at 
Dodgers Stadium! First pitch is 8:07pm EST/1:07am BST. We'll be back shortly 
with starting lineups, predictions and a rundown of this weekend's MLB playoff 
action.
