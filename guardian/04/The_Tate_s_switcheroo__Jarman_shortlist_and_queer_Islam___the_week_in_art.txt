 Portrait of Pope Julius II (1511) by Raphael. Photograph: National 
Gallery/Alamy Stock Photo 
This is the face that launched a thousand paintings of popes. Well, maybe not 
a thousand, but Raphael’s acute image of the aged Julius looking tired and 
melancholy – largely because the city of Bologna had just rebelled against his 
rule and melted down Michelangelo’s bronze statue of him – inspired rival 
masterpieces of papal portraiture by Titian, Velázquez and ultimately Francis 
Bacon. It is a central work in the history of portraiture.
