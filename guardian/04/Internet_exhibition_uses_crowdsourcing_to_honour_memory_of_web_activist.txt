The world wide web began to show up by snail mail at the end of May. It 
arrived on sheets of office paper, stacked in white boxes, slipped into 
bubble-wrapped manila sleeves, folded into a clean, white business envelope with
Rosa Parks <https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/25/guardianobituaries.usa>
 stamps, stuffed in neon-green packaging from Farmington Hills, Michigan. By 
the end of last month, 10 tonnes of pages from the internet had accumulated at 
a contemporary art gallery in Mexico City, sent by more than 600 people who 
bothered to print out portions of the web and postmark them.

"There's very little pornography, and I'm really surprised by that," says 
Pamela Echeverría, founder and director ofLabor <http://www.labor.org.mx/en>, 
the gallery hosting the exhibit. "I thought, 'Oh, my God, we're going to 
receive really nasty pictures.' So far, it hasn't happened."

Instead, after the 22 May announcement of its "crowdsourced project to 
literally print out the entire internet", the gallery received printouts of 
spam folders, bank statements, online diaries, news articles, 20 pages of the 
letter "A" repeated continuously, 500 pages of poetry created by erasing text 
extracted from websites, and all Mahler's scores.

The submissions are being read aloud by members of the public at a desk on a 
small platform in the gallery, where visitors are able to rifle through them 
until the show closes at the end of this month.

This prompts the cosmic question that follows all artwork in all forms from 
all eras: why?

The answer: to memorialise Aaron Swartz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/02/aaron-swartz-hacker-genius-martyr-girlfriend-interview>
.

Another cosmic question: who?

The answer: Swartz was the 26-year-old internet prodigy and free-information 
activist who committed suicide in January while facing federal charges of 
computer hacking after his alleged theft of millions of documents from the 
academic database JSTOR.

Another question: how is Swartz honoured by the recitation of lyrics to every 
song that Prince recorded under the alter ego "Camille"?

The co-ordinator of Printing Out the Internet 
<http://www.labor.org.mx/en/kenneth-goldsmith-printing-out-the-internet/> isn't 
sure if there's a direct correlation between tribute and tributee.

"My gesture is dedicated to and inspired by him," says Kenneth Goldsmith 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/kenneth-goldsmith>, the New York poet whom 
Echeverría enlisted to create a homage to Swartz. "Mine is a poetic gesture, a 
pataphysical gesture. His was a political gesture, a gesture of liberation. And 
I'm not doing this so that everybody can go and steal all the material on the 
internet. I actually want to use his gesture as a jumping-off point to begin to 
ponder much larger questions."

If such larger questions are "pataphysical" – meaning they, like their 
answers, are imaginary – are they even worth asking? More importantly, can this 
previous question about the larger questions be classified as 
"meta-pataphysical"? And if we found the answer to that question on the 
internet, how many pages would it take up when printed?

Goldsmith, the poet laureate of New York's Museum of Modern Art and founder of 
the avant-garde clearinghouseUbuWeb <http://www.ubuweb.tv/>, is the kind of 
artist who doesn't claim to be an artist, who purports to be an uncreative 
writer, who says he has a "thinkership", not a readership. He's the guy who 
wore a paisley-patterned suit to a 2011 poetry jam at the White House and read, 
in front of the president, an excerpt from his book Traffic, a transcription of 
24 hours of traffic reports from a New York radio station.

After initial discussion with Echeverría, Goldsmith wanted to exhibit a 
compendium of every online photo of actress Natalie Portman. Then he was 
smitten by an Iraqi-American artist's collection of every news article written 
about the war in Iraq; they were bound in 80 volumes comprising 2,000 pages 
each. Then, inspired by the magnitude of Swartz's download, he asked himself, 
"Why not just print the whole internet?"

"I downloaded a torrent that was supposed to be some chunk of Swartz's heist. 
It was 33 gigabytes, and it was something like 18,000 documents, and I began 
unzipping those files. And within each one of those were thousands and 
thousands of pages," Goldsmith says. "I started thinking about the large data 
sets that everyone's dealing with."

Immense WikiLeaks <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks> document 
dumps, labyrinthine Wikipedia troves, the velocity of page creation fuelled by 
social media …

"We have no idea what we're talking about, and I think the way to understand 
it is to concretise it," he says. "We're dealing with abstraction, and we have 
no idea what this is. We need new metrics for infinity."

While the web is effectively infinite, an archive of web pages is now seven 
petabytes, or 7,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.The Internet Archive 
<http://archive.org/index.php>, a non-profit attempt to build a web library, 
has about 350bn pages in its collection, according to its founder, Brewster 
Kahle.

The size of these numbers implies that the exhibit's mission is destined for 
failure, which Goldsmith recognises and dismisses as irrelevant (this is 
pataphysics, remember?). His detractors, meanwhile, have taken issue with the 
mission itself. A small Change.org petition was drafted to needle Goldsmith 
about the resources required to produce and recycle paper and ink. On the blog 
of San Francisco's City Lights Booksellers and Publishers, poet Garrett Caples 
wrote that "nothing is being made available [in the project], only taken and 
destroyed, and nothing is being risked. Swartz is simply a glib talking point, 
because there's no relationship between 'what he liberated' and the arbitrary 
accumulation of printouts Goldsmith seeks to assemble". Emails and tweets have 
excoriated him for being wasteful, for razing rain forests in the name of some 
pseudo-artistic boondoggle.

Goldsmith scoffs at this reaction and deflected the argument over waste 
towards other parts of the industry, notably the outsized, costly artwork of
Jeff Koons <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/koons>.

"Nobody hollers about insane excesses in the art world, and its elitist and 
exclusive nature," he says. "This is an inclusive project."

That much is true. Brooklyn resident Logan K Young, a fan of Goldsmith's, 
heard about the project and the backlash, printed out 32 pages of Prince lyrics 
and mailed them toMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico> City. For 
this, he will be included in the list of contributors at the exhibit.

Why Prince? Because looking up lyrics was one of Young's first online habits 
after he acquired broadband. And what value does he see in contributing?

"My life is on the internet," says Young, editor of Classicalite 
<http://www.classicalite.com/>, a music website. "I'm behind a screen more than 
12 hours a day. This gives a tactile quality to an ethereal, intangible thing."

Goldsmith and Echeverría have a similar opinion: printing out the web lends 
this whirling, fleeting ultra-network a sense (however flimsy) of stillness and 
permanence, and it allows people to begin to process its inestimable dimensions 
in a physical space.

Young, despite his enthusiasm for the exhibit, doesn't see much of a 
connection to the man who inspired it. Kahle, theInternet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet> Archive founder who knew and 
worked with Swartz, does.

The web is "such a valuable thing. So how do you protect what's valuable? 
Well, you make copies," Kahle says. "And going and printing it out is kind of 
an interesting, wacko project. It's innately crowdsourced, and 'by us, for us'. 
And that is the nature ofAaron Swartz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/aaron-swartz>."
