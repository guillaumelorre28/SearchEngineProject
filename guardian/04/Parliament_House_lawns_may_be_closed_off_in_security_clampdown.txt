Security at Parliament House is reportedly set to be tightened as authorities 
say they are concerned about the building’s vulnerability to a terrorist attack.

New reinforcements are believed to include security barriers in public areas, 
fencing and gates around the Senate and House of Representatives entries, fewer 
pedestrian entry points and extra machine gun-equipped police,Fairfax Media

Restricted access to the complex’s signature sloping lawns could stop 
Australians walking over the heads of their elected representatives – an 
opportunity the building was designed to provide.

A number of changes have reportedly received support from the major parties in 
the lower house and will be put to senators this week, with a view to beginning 
the works over the summer.

Security both inside and outside the 250,000 sq m premises has been stepped up 
significantly since 2014, when intelligence services intercepted “chatter” in 
terrorist networks about an attack on the building.

The ministerial wing was locked down

 after the review, with public access significantly restricted, and the 
Australian federal police was put back in charge of security.

The then prime minister, Tony Abbott, said parliament was never “specifically 
mentioned” in any of the intercepts

The 2014 security review was also prompted by the attack in the Canadian 
capital of Ottawa

, in which a soldier guarding the national war memorial was shot dead, and a 
gunman made it into the heart of the parliament before being killed by a 
ceremonial officer.
