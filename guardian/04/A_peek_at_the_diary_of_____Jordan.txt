The minute news of me and Pete's split broke, I hired a new agent - things are 
going to get rough, and I need a wartime consiglieri. "I'm secluding myself in 
the Maldives," I told her. "Tell the papers I'll do poolside shots for 
£100,000, but it's £150,000 if they want the kids, too, £200,000 if I get my 
tears to liquefy."

"I'm keeping a dignified silence," I tweeted this morning. "I'm still keeping 
a dignified silence," I tweeted five minutes later.

"I miss Pete desperately."

And I do. This morning I couldn't help pouring my heart out to him in a text. 
"Compared to Dwight's, yours was an acorn," I wrote. "You're a crap singer and 
a sad little loser, and I made you what you are. Without me you'd still be a 
permatanned failed singer, instead of a perma-tanned failed singer with pocket 
money."

Can't believe he didn't reply. His coldness staggers me - I mean, we're the 
ITV2 Burton and Taylor; it's as if he can't see how hurt I am. When I used to 
say things like that to him in front of the cameras, he always used to give 
this clench-toothed little smile, so I know he loved it. He was like a puppy 
who'd always come back to you no matter how many times you kicked it. What's 
happened to that puppy?

"I'm going to drown you in a sack," I texted him later, "because I can't 
afford to keep you. And then I'm going to tell the kids you went to live on a 
farm."

He'll come round eventually.
