Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> is a continent of 1.1bn 
people, over 50 countries and thousands of different languages. Comparisons 
between countries are always difficult, more so in a continent so diverse.

We have plotted seven alternative indicators for each of the countries below 
which provide some sense of life on the ground as well as a general barometer 
of each nation’s development.

For example, a high proportion of the workforce being in the service sector 
suggests that the country is largely dependent on high-skilled jobs such as 
banking, which hasgrown rapidly over the past decade

.

Each indicator has its own scale, shown in the key. As a general rule, dots 
further to the right tend to signify greater average wealth. For example, the 
countries with higher numbers of children per woman have that particular dot on 
the left hand side while those with fewer have it placed on the right.

Thanks to South Africa, the southernmost region as a whole does well across 
most of the metrics. It has particularly high mobile phone subscription rates 
and the majority of its workforce employed in the service sector.
South Africa

The west is a particularly diverse part of the continent containing both 
Niger, where there are nearly eightchildren per woman 
<http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN>, as well as Cape Verde 
where there are just two.
West Africa

Africa’s eastern region contains some of the countries with the lowest median 
ages in Africa such as Uganda, Somalia and Zambia. However, it also contains 
Mauritius, where the median age of 34.2 is the highest across the entire 
continent.

Africa is often claimed to be the “mobile continent” 
<http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_mobile_continent>. Many people, 
particularly in its central sub-Saharan region, use mobile as their primary way 
to accessthe internet, make cash payments and post to social media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/internet-use-mobile-phones-africa-predicted-increase-20-fold>
. Gabon is the country in Africa with the highest number of mobile 
subscriptions per person - there are two for every one person living there.
Central Africa

Development in northern Africa is more evenly spread than in southern Africa. 
The only country in the region with a median age lower than 24 is Sudan, where 
it is 19.
