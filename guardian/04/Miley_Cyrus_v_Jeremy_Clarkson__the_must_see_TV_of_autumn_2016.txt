The Night Of


The Night Of has already premiered in America to near-universal acclaim. A US 
remake of BBC1’s peerless Criminal Justice, it stars Riz Ahmed and John 
Turturro as a murder suspect and his lawyer battling through the legal system. 
Perfectly timed to coincide with the rise of Making a Murderer-style crime 
documentaries, The Night Of looks little short of unmissable.

 Semi-naked mining saga … Poldark. Photograph: BBC 
Former chancellor George Osborne criticised the BBC for making short-run 
dramas (War and Peace, The Night Manager), rather than US-style super-shows 
that can run for ever. Now, Osborne has more time to enjoy the sort of show he 
wanted. Season two of the Cornish semi-naked mining saga reaches 1790, with 
Aidan Turner’s Ross Poldark again fighting for his tin, his wife and his life 
against foes led by Jack Farthing’s George Warleggan. Weather reports from 
filming in Cornwall warn that Turner may have been forced to keep his shirt on 
more often.

Hey, the gang’s back! You know, the gang from that show that hasn’t been on 
air for well over a decade! People might not have been clamouring for the 
return of it, but Cold Feet’s here now and there’s nothing you can do about it. 
Helen Baxendale is still dead. Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris are still 
posh. Aside from James Nesbitt’s miraculously resurgent hair, this one is

<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/04/chris-evans-quits-bbc-top-gear-after-one-series>
 earlier this year, the road is clear for Jeremy Clarkson, James May and 
Richard Hammond to snatch back the title of Dominant Motoring Show. The Grand 
Tour won’t be identical to Top Gear – Hammond now has a genuinely horrible 
goatee, for example – but there should be enough stunts and tomfoolery to 
satiate fans.

 Distressing twists … Our Loved Boy. Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC/Minnow Films 
Biographical dramas are a regular occurence, but this one is unusual in 
omitting the moment that tragically made Damilola Taylor known: the killing of 
the 10-year-old Anglo-Nigerian schoolboy in London in 2000. Writer Levi David 
Addai (My Murder) cuts between the Taylor family’s journey from Lagos to 
London, and their pursuit of justice, with many distressing twists. Babou 
Ceesay plays Damilola’s tirelessly campaigning father, Richard.

 Topically provocative … National Treasure. Photograph: Joss Barratt 
The topically provocative plotline of this four-part Channel 4 drama – a star 
TV personality accused of historical sex crimes – would ensure hungry 
anticipation even without the A-list casting of Robbie Coltrane and Julie 
Walters as the suspect and his wife. Then there’s the writing pedigree. Jack 
Thorne (This Is England, The Last Panthers) has four Baftas and has just 
written the Harry Potter theatrical mega-hit The Cursed Child.

Paranoid

The murder of a GP in a small English town appears to be a local tragedy until 
unexpected pressure on the investigation from higher up and far beyond alerts 
viewers that we are in the satisfying territory of the conspiracy thriller. Top 
cop Indira Varma spreads the investigation to Germany. The involvement of 
Netflix as co-producer makes this an intriguing collaboration between 
traditional broadcast and pioneering streamed TV.

The second series of Transparent was a lot broader in spectrum than the first,

compelling in the first place: a group of selfish people somehow trying to be 
better. Not much is known about the new series, but unless it deviates 
massively from the last two, we’ll be in safe hands.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon>
’s new – and first – TV series was “a catastrophic mistake”. As he said: “I 
don’t know what I’m doing. I’m floundering. I expect this to be a cosmic 
embarrassment.” Still, the trailer is funny enough, in a very Woody Allen way, 
and it’ll be interesting to see how Miley Cyrus copes with the 1960s-set script.

 Oozing class … Westworld. Photograph: John P Johnson/HBO 
Michael Crichton’s 1973 sci-fi movie Westworld – about a theme park in which 
androids help humans act out fantasies – feels increasingly prescient as the 
technology of virtual reality and artificial intelligence becomes science fact. 
So it seems a smart call by HBO to court its Game of Thrones audience with this 
series. From executive producer JJ Abrams to a cast including Anthony Hopkins, 
Ed Harris and Evan Rachel Wood, the credits ooze class. Even the trailer looks 
a billion dollars.

 Hedonistic … Chewing Gum. Photograph: Mark Johnson 
When the first series made it into our 2015 previews, few knew of Michaela 
Coel, its writer-star, whom E4 had shrewdly hired to adapt her theatre 
monologue about Tracey Gordon, a young London woman caught between her 
religious upbringing and hedonistic appetites. Now Coel has a Bafta for best 
female comedy performance and season two has a must-see feel.

Crazyhead 

The world has been a much worse place since Misfits upped and left in 2013. 
But creator Howard Overman is back with Crazyhead, which sounds terrific. A 
comedy-horror about a couple of demon hunters – one of whom works in a bowling 
alley – that promises to be as gripping as it is funny.
• October, E4.

The Missing

Two years ago, the first series of this European-American co-production 
examined the parental nightmare of the abduction of a young child. In this 
deserved return, writers Harry and Jack Williams move on to the dream-nightmare 
of the apparent return of a vanished child. Only Tchéky Karyo, as detective 
Julien Baptiste, survives from the original cast, now investigating the 
discovery in Germany of a young woman with the same name as an English girl who 
vanished 11 years previously.

 Not always pious … The Young Pope. Photograph: Sky 
Jude Law is Pope Pius XIII, the first American leader of the Roman Catholic 
church, in this eight-part Vatican thriller. The trailer showed Law’s pontiff 
smoking cigarettes on the papal throne and admiring his naked body in a gilded 
mirror so this Pius may not always be pious, giving cardinals weaknesses to 
exploit as they challenge the pope’s mission to bring “revolution” to 
Catholicism.

Haters Back Off 

Colleen Ballinger’s YouTube creation, the delusional wannabe Miranda Sings, 
has more going for her than meets the eye. Sings believes she was born famous 
and Haters Back Off is likely to be an expansion of this view. You might not 
like it, but your kids are going to love it.

 Will the royals be furious? … The Crown. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Netflix 
Extreme UK media scrutiny (potentially furious) seems assured for a Netflix 
series that aims to dramatise the story of the Queen’s reign at around a decade 
a season for six years. The first tranche starts in 1947, with Claire Foy as a 
Princess Elizabeth, with no apparent chance of becoming Queen, and Matt Smith 
as her dashing Greek naval suitor, Philip. The fascination will be whether US 
producers will be less reverential towards the royals than the BBC or ITV would 
be.
