Adelaide has been chosen as one of the world's top 10 cities to visit in 2014 
by travel guide publisher Lonely Planet.

South Australia's capital is ranked ninth on the list included in Lonely 
Planet's Best in Travel 2014 guide.

"Having always lived in the shadow of its gregarious eastern-seaboard cousins, 
the City of Churches has been quietly loosening its pious shackles and 
embracing its liberal foundations," says Lonely Planet.

"The year 2014 beckons big changes for the city's heart, with the completion 
of the multimillion-dollar refurbishment of the Adelaide Oval, which will link 
central Adelaide with the oval and its beautiful surrounding parklands, and 
historic North Adelaide further on.

"Adelaide is effortlessly chic and, like a perfectly cellared red, it's ready 
to be uncorked and sampled."
