Christian Horner is confident Sebastian Vettel will remain with Red Bull, 
despite the team’s designer,Adrian Newey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/08/f1-red-bull-fight-off-ferrari-to-retain-services-of-adrian-newey>
, deciding to step back from Formula One next year.

The Red Bull team principal said: “Adrian is taking up a different role 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jun/09/adrian-newey-red-bull-move-celebrated-f1-rivals>
, he is not retiring completely from F1. He is going to be mentoring and 
advising the team, and we have a great strength in depth.

“Sebastian is never going to talk about what the state of his contracts are, 
but he has enjoyed a huge amount of success with the team. And I have got no 
doubt that he will be with the team for many years to come.”

Horner’s words will not end speculation that their most prized asset will move 
on, with Ferrari the favourites to sign him. Vettel signed a one-year extension 
to hisRed Bull <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull> contract in June 
last year which will take him up to the end of the 2015 season.

The world champion added to the speculation when, speaking after the news 
about Newey, he said: “Well, I think my contract’s still long enough … I’m 
looking short term, if you ask me about the future right now.”

Newey remains focused on F1 until the end of the year, which means his 
fingerprints will be all over Red Bull’s 2015 car. If the team continue to 
struggle next season – despiteSunday’s victory at the Canadian Grand Prix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/08/daniel-ricciardo-nico-rosberg-grand-prix-canada>
 in Montreal by Daniel Ricciardo – it will increase speculation that Vettel may 
look elsewhere.

With no vacancy at Mercedes, and with McLaren’s prospects uncertain as they 
switch from Mercedes to Honda engines, that leaves Ferrari, where Kimi 
Raikkonen has been a disappointment since rejoining the team this year.

Jenson Button is confident that he will go to the Austrian Grand Prix next 
week with a more competitive McLaren. “The important thing is the feeling of 
the car is improving. There’s progress, definitely, and we’ve got some new 
parts for the next race. Downforce is generally what we need for the high-speed 
circuits.

“We obviously lucked in [for fourth in Canada] with the [Pérez-Massa] 
incident. I’m glad they’re OK. The penultimate lap was a lot of fun. I was 
right behind Fernando Alonso and Nico Hülkenberg and I could see something was 
going to happen.

“It was a good result, a little bit lucky, but we still would’ve been sixth 
without the incident.”
