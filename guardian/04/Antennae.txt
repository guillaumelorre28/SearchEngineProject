Who they?

A TV academic with a loafer in the past and an eye on the future, Simon 
Thurley is, in his own words, "a historian with a mission". With previous 
stints on Time Team and The Buildings That Shaped Britain under his sensible 
and doubtlessly competitively priced belt, his latest venture (English 
Heritage, BBC2, Fridays) finds Thurley laying forth his hopes for the future of 
an organisation for which he is chief executive. As the government's principal 
adviser on "the historic environment in England", he aims to explain "why 
history matters".
