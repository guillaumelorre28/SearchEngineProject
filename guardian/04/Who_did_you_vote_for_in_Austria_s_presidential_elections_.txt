Austrians rejected far-right presidential candidate Norbert Hofer, instead 
electing a independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen who said he would be 
an “open-minded, liberal-minded and above all a pro-European president”.

Hofer lost by the narrowest of margins in May – just 31,000 votes – to Van der 
Bellen

 but a recount, backed by Hofer’s party, found counting irregularities and the 
vote was annulled. A further hiccup –the adhesive seals on the postal votes was 
found to be faulty

 – delayed the rerun by two months.

Van der Bellen increased his lead over the far-right Freedom party candidate, 
Norbert Hofer, by a considerable margin from the original vote in May.

While the role of president is largely ceremonial, the win is heartening for 
those worried about the rise of rightwing populist forces acrossEurope

Hofer had promised to call a referendum on EU membership if the bloc of states 
took further steps towards integration, while also stating that he believed that

Van der Bellen had run his second campaign on a decisively pro-European ticket, 
with posters proclaiming that a vote for him meant “no to Öxit”.
