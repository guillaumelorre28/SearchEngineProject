We arrived with an overnight case in the back of the car and drove home with 
barely a centimetre of room left in the boot. Bring your appetite and be 
prepared to work up a thirst; a weekend in Orange is all about good food, 
fantastic wine and leaving the supermarket and liquor barns far, far behind.

 Orange's cool climate makes for elegant wines – and stunning vistas. 
Photograph: Vicky Frost/Guardian Australia 
You can feel the difference in temperature the moment you step into Orange’s 
revitalising crisp air – that’s what being in the shadow of Mount Canobolas, 
more than 4500ft above sea level does for you – and that cooler climate has 
given rise to a wine industry that continues to grow and impress.

There are more than 30 cellar doors in the area, which makes for a promising 
afternoon spent visiting your favourites. They are, however, fairly well spread 
out, which makes a car pretty much essential, along with someone clear-headed 
enough to drive it.

So pace your tastings and choose your list with a bit of care. (That might 
keep your budget in check too – you’ll probably want to pick up a couple of 
bottles at each stop.)

I say all this because a very warm welcome at Ross Hill Wines 
<http://www.rosshillwines.com.au/> almost did for our whole trip. A 
light-filled converted apple shed with a welcome fire in colder months, 
generous tables to share and views over the vineyards and orchards is quite the 
place for a tasting, particularly when the wine and hospitality are as 
irresistible as this. We only just managed to leave sober enough to drive back 
down the lane, bottles clanking merrily in the boot.

 After a day visiting cellar doors, stop for a glass of your favourite at Union 
Bank Bar. Photograph: Vicky Frost/Guardian Australia 
Less homely but equally charming is Brangayne <http://brangayne.com/>, just 
down the road, with more of those lush, vineyard views, while the cellar doors 
at De Salis <http://www.desaliswines.com.au/De_Salis_Wines/Home.html> and 
Philip Shaw <http://www.philipshaw.com.au/> have both their own unique appeal, 
and some of the most delicious bottles in the region.

Given the amount of booze on offer, food is a very sensible plan, and the 
cellar door at De Salis, with its gobsmacking vista, is the perfect spot for a 
picnic. They suggest ordering through local companyCompletely Hampered 
<http://www.completelyhampered.com/>, although there are also plenty of 
fantastic local producers about if you fancy doing your own legwork.

At some point it’s almost inevitable that you’ll realize that all those 
brilliant chats with winemakers mean you’ve bought enough pinot noir for a 
small army. But somehow, there’s not much of it around a couple of months 
later. And if your travelling companion begins making noises about actually 
just fancying a beer, Orange also has a craft brewery: add a few of Badlands 
Brewery <http://www.badlandsbrewery.com.au/>’s ales to your haul.

 Rich pickings from the farmers' market – including cheeses from Second Mouse 
and local apples. Photograph: Vicky Frost/Guardian Australia 
Alongside the neat rows of vines, you’ll also find orchards; cherries and 
apples being the pride of, erm, Orange. You’ll be able to buy direct from some 
of these producers at farm gates as you trundle between cellar doors, or time 
your weekend right and you can cheerfully empty your pockets at the local 
farmers markets. (Orange and Bathurst on the second and fourth Saturdays of 
every month, respectively.)

We left laden with local cheese from the Second Mouse Cheese Company 
<http://secondmousecheeseco.com.au/>, more preserves than available cupboard 
space, local honey,olive oil <http://www.ploughmanshill.com.au/#!/pageHome>, and
verjus <http://www.orangemountain.com.au/om/Verjus.htm>. You’ll find buckets of 
tasty, fresh veg and a number of varieties of local apples. And if you don’t 
make the market, there’s also a deli,A Slice of Orange 
<http://www.asliceoforange.com.au/>, off the rather scruffy main drag.

I can’t consume another thing …

 Walk off some of the weekend's excesses in the botanic gardens Photograph: 
Vicky Frost/Guardian Australia 
Even the greediest weekender might find themselves faltering in the face of so 
many calories. The crisp, clean air on a trip out to Mount Canobolas, still 
verdant among the grey and mist when we visited thanks to its volcanic soil, 
hopefully offsets some of wine fumes.

There are a variety of short trails 
<http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkWalking.aspx?id=N0636> – 
if you’re after something a bit longer join a couple together – or the lazy can 
drive to the summit. Our view was pretty much of cloud only, but a clearer day 
should bring more varied panoramas.

For a flatter walk, you might try Orange’s botanic gardens. Perhaps somewhat 
grandly named – they’re effectively a posh park – but just lovely for a Sunday 
morning stroll.

 On a trip to Millthorpe with its historic buildings, visit Tonic for lunch. 
Photograph: Vicky Frost/Guardian Australia 
Orange has a couple of shops selling expensive nice things you don’t need and 
only buy on weekends away, but if you’re after a long browse of pricey 
homewares, accessories and candles, you’re better heading out to Millthorpe. 
(As a bonus, you can have Sunday lunchat Tonic 
<http://www.tonicmillthorpe.com.au/>, which is a real treat.) The village is 
sweet in a heritage kind of way, with lots of effort put into preserving its 
buildings and street views. The entire place is classified by the National 
Trust. It’s a bit like being on a film set.

Sleep

We stayed at the De Russie Suites <http://www.derussiehotels.com.au/orange.htm>
, a complex of mini-apartments which have little kitchenettes, really decent 
beds and some welcome space to relax between a hard afternoon wine tasting and 
heading out for dinner. Cozy and comfortable, and a short walk from Orange’s 
bars and restaurants: rooms from $150-$430.

The Black Sheep Inn <http://www.blacksheepinn.com.au>, 9km outside Orange, 
offers a rather different experience – a converted shearing shed it’s all tin 
roof and and exposed shell with comfortable communal areas. The bathrooms in 
particular look fantastic. Rooms from $175-$270.

 Racine – amazing food in beautiful surroundings. Photograph: Vicky 
Frost/Guardian Australia 
Book your table at Racine <http://www.racinerestaurant.com.au/> the same time 
you book your hotel – this place is fabulous. Everything here finds the right 
balance between luxury and relaxed, from the smiley service to the bright room 
with its inspiring vista.

Food doesn’t disappoint either: flavoursome, tender local venison comes with 
earthy beetroot, red cabbage and black rice; a dish of mushroom, swede, egg, 
granola proves totally delicious (I admit I needed convincing); and a pudding 
of carrot cake and flavours carries a curry kick. It’s a joy, and great value 
for this level of cooking: three courses $75, five course set menu $90. The 
wine is as good as you’d expect and they also have a bakery in the town centre.

More informal – although Racine is by no means stuffy – and closer to town, 
for ease of stumbling home, isUnion Bank Wine Store 
<http://www.unionbank.com.au/>. A good looking space is bright and buzzy, with 
a decent bar food for sharing, and a varied wine selection with knowledgeable 
staff. Great place for a light dinner and a taste of local wines.

And to get you going the following morning … Factory Espresso 
<http://www.billsbeans.com.au/espressobar.html> feels like a slice of Melbourne 
dropped into Orange. A new extension to Bills’ Beans roasters, it’s a busy, 
stylish café with great coffee – of course! – and some interesting brunch 
offerings. The pies looked to die for.

Practicalities

Getting there and around

Orange is around three hours west of Sydney by road. You can hire bikes 
locally, but you’ll probably need a car if you’re intending to visit a number 
of cellar doors – if only to carry your haul home.

When to visit

The annual food week is at the beginning of April, and wine week is at the end 
of October. Thanks to its the colder climate Orange gets dramatic autumn colour
