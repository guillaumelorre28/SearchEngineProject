Zambia beat already-qualified Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in the Africa Cup of 
Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> on Sunday to 
finish in first place in Group A and join the co-hosts in the quarter-finals.

Christopher Katongo scored the winning goal in the 67th minute at the Nuevo 
Estadio de Malabo, as Equatorial Guinea's unexpected run of two opening 
victories came to an end.

"Our strategy was to go into the second round," Katongo said. "Whoever we meet 
it's not our problem. We have to concentrate on our own tactics and what the 
coach wants us to do."

The result meant that unbeaten Zambia won the group and Equatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> finished in second 
place and are likely to face the cup favourites, Ivory Coast, in the last eight.

The scoreline also eliminated Libya, despite their surprise 2-1 win against 
Senegal. Libya needed to win their game and Equatorial Guinea to beatZambia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zambia> to have any chance of progressing.

"Maybe it's a surprise for some people but we came to finish first," the 
Zambia coach, Herv√© Renard, said. "Maybe it was a difficult target but the 
players respected everything perfectly today."

Zambia finished with seven points after two wins and a draw, a point ahead of 
Equatorial Guinea. Ivory Coast are expected to clinch first place in Group B 
when they play Angola on Monday, which would set them to meet the co-hosts in 
the last eight.

"It's only one defeat. We have to correct the mistakes for the next match and 
see the future optimistically," said the Equatorial Guinea coach, Gilson Paulo.
