Located 720km north-west of Brisbane in Queensland’s central highlands, 
Carnarvon Gorge is a spectacular formation sliced out of the semi-arid 
sandstone belt by water and time.

 Imbued with diverse flora and fauna and significant Indigenous heritage, it 
is much loved by Queenslanders – many of whom first visit on school excursions 
– but little known outside the state. The gorge forms a 16,000-hectare segment 
ofCarnarvon national park <http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/carnarvon-gorge/>.

Getting there

From Brisbane, the drive to Carnarvon Gorge via Roma takes a full day. With 
limited time it's best to fly from Brisbane to Emerald, 234km to the north. On 
my hour-long flight I could see the canyon’s white sandstone cliffs gleaming in 
the morning sun.

From Emerald, head south along Gregory Highway to Springsure, then take Dawson 
Highway to Rolleston before continuing 61km to the gorge access road. From the 
turn-off it is 45km to Carnarvon Gorge, with the last 15km on well-maintained 
dirt.

Most sights and facilities are along the access road’s final section, which 
ends at the national park visitor centre, where there is information on all 
aspects of the gorge. The surrounding visitor area has grassy lawns that draw 
grazing kangaroos and wallabies and is where gorge walking trails begin.

Main attractions

Sculpted by Carnarvon Creek, the gorge is a warren of high-sided chasms filled 
with remnant rainforest, pools, caves and ancient Indigneous art galleries. 
Most features lie beyond the park visitor area, but three – Baloon Cave, Mickey 
Creek Gorge and Rock Pool – are reached by short trails off the access road’s 
final section.

On my first afternoon I visit two of these, beginning with a rock-hop across 
Carnarvon Creek to Rock Pool, where I recover from the journey with a cooling 
dip. Then, at Mickey Creek Gorge, I scramble and hoist myself up into the midst 
of the narrowing passage, and am soon squeezing between twisting rock walls 
covered in green moss.

The main gorge walking track, leaving from the visitor centre, crisscrosses 
Carnarvon Creek for 9.7km to Big Bend, where a natural pool stands invitingly 
beneath sandstone cliffs and camping is possible.

En route, sidetracks lead to a succession of rock chambers that secrete 
everything from ferns that originate from before the dinosaurs to a huge 
amphitheatre with 60m-high walls.

Trekking in the gorge

Experienced hikers can see the main sights on a one-day, 22km trek, getting as 
far as Cathedral Cave, where Indigenous Australians have sheltered for 
thousands of years. For an even bigger challenge, there’s the six-day 87km
Carnarvon Great Walk 
<http://nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/carnarvon-great-walk/index.html>, which begins 
in and eventually returns to the gorge and involves lugging camping equipment 
and provisions.

For a shorter day’s hike, aim for the must-see Art Gallery, 5.4km from the 
visitor centre, and take in other sights along the way. Whatever hike you 
choose, start early to avoid the day’s heat.

Guided tours

With limited time at Carnarvon Gorge, I take a day tour with local operator 
Simon Ling ofAustralian Nature Guides 
<http://www.ausnatureguides.com/Pages/About_us.html>. Ling is an expert in 
ecology and biodiversity who has been guiding visitors through the gorge since 
1999. His tour reveals the gorge’s flourishing plant and animal life and 
provides invaluable background on the landscape’s geology and Indigenous 
heritage.

Early on, as the sun rises, we make slow but engrossing progress as Ling 
explains the life cycle of everything fromnative hibiscus 
<http://www.hibiscus.org/> and Australian bluebells  
<http://www.centennialparklands.com.au/about/plants_in_the_parklands/australian_bluebell>
to tree-climbing orchids and mammothcycads 
<http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/PlantNet/cycad/>. As the forest warms, the 
first tiny finches andfairy wrens 
<http://birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/superb-fairy-wren> appear and swamp 
wallabies begin stirring. Later we encounter white-faced herons at the 
creekside, mobs of king parrots with bright red torsos and green coats, and an 
echidna shuffling through the undergrowth.

 Rock art at the Art Gallery, Carnarvon Gorge. Photograph: Daniel Scott 
Reaching the Art Gallery by mid-morning, Ling helps interpret a panorama of 
2,000 paintings and handprints that date back more than 3,500 years. There are 
representations of emus and kangaroos, totem animals of the Karingbal and 
Bidjara people; intricate net stencils signifying a burial area and sexual 
imagery that indicate this was an initiation site for both men and women.

Retracing our steps, we turn off to Ward’s Canyon where we have lunch beneath 
13 endemic king ferns, five metres tall and found nowhere else in inland 
Australia. Virtually bereft of sunshine, in the early 1900s the chasm was used 
as a natural cold store by theWard brothers 
<http://www.timbowden.com.au/travel/tims-articles-for-caravanrv-magazine/gorgeous-carnarvon-gorge/>
, who hunted possums for their lucrative fur.

In the early afternoon we climb a metal staircase and enter a narrow crack in 
the rock face to the amphitheatre, a massive open bowl hollowed out of the 
surrounding plateau. We are given a memorable experience of the echo chamber 
when a visitor launches into a pitch-perfect rendition ofLeonard Cohen’s 
Hallelujah <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLk4vdY28Q&feature=kp>. 

Finally, we visit the moss garden, a riot of greenery within the confines of 
Violet Gorge, fed by permanent springs within the rock which are between five 
and 10,000 years old.

In all, Ling’s lower gorge tour covers 14km over a leisurely eight hours. The 
cost is $55 per person –more details here

A night tour, a sunset tour and a helicopter ride


I join Ling again later for a night safari tour  
<http://www.ausnatureguides.com/Pages/Carnarvon_Gorge_Nightlife_Tour.html>near 
the visitor centre. Within minutes of crossing the creek we spotlight a small, 
endearingly big-earedyellow-bellied glider 
<http://www.wildlife.org.au/wildlife/speciesprofile/mammals/gliders/yellow_bellied_glider.html>
 high up a gum tree. We then see it take off through the canopy, legs and arms 
splayed, wing-like membranes stretched between them, gliding gracefully and 
seemingly in slow motion before landing softly on a tree trunk, 30m away.

 Later we watch a bigger greater glider 
<http://www.wildlife.org.au/wildlife/speciesprofile/mammals/gliders/greater_glider.html>
 cover around 100m as it travels across the creek. We see several more gliders 
on our short, thrilling walk, including a breeding aggregation of greater 
gliders, which like koalas, are folivores, feeding exclusively on leaves. We 
also spot kangaroos and wallabies and the ripple of a platypus in the creek.

 Sunset on the Carnarvon ranges. Photograph: Daniel Scott 
On my first evening I do a new sunset tour at the nearby 17,000-hectare 
Bandana cattle station <http://bandanastation.com.au>, which costs $30 per 
person. Gathered around a campfire with drinks and canapés, we watch the sun 
illuminating the Great Dividing Range as station owner Olivia Evans, a sixth 
generation descendant of the area’s European settlers, recounts stories of 
cattle doffing (stealing) and mustering by helicopter. Leaving behind hectic 
city lives, Evans and her husband are gradually transforming Bandana into an 
organic cattle farm.

On my final morning, I get an idea of the scale of the Carnarvon ranges, 
nicknamed the “rooftop of Queensland”, on a 20-minute helicopter flight with 
local pilot Shane Swanson. Concentrating on Moolayember Gorge, adjacent to 
Carnarvon, which can only be otherwise accessed on a seven-day trek, we overfly 
rock formations like the Three Sisters, whose bluffs and spindly gullies look 
mythic in the morning sun. The flight adds a wider perspective on the explosion 
of life in the midst of the dry, rocky inland region. Seehelicentral.net.au 
<http://helicentral.net.au>; flights cost $390 for two people.

Sleeping and eating


Don’t expect luxury in this remote location. Accommodation here is all about 
being surrounded by nature. I stay in a basic safari tent with shared amenities 
atTakarakka Bush Resort <https://www.takaru.com.au/>, costing $115 for two. Set 
on a loop in Carnarvon Creek, where there are platypus, Takarakka also has 
cottages ($230 for two), ensuite cabins ($195) and camping. It’s mostly DIY 
food at Takarakka but they offer a roast dinner occasionally, have a store with 
free Wi-Fi, and friendly, knowledgeable staff.

Closer to the visitor centre and a tad more upmarket, with licensed restaurant 
and ensuite cabins, isCarnarvon Gorge Wilderness Lodge 
<http://carnarvon-gorge.com>, open from March to November.

Carnarvon National Park has camping 
<http://nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/carnarvon-gorge/camping.html> at the visitor 
area and at Big Bend, 9.7km into the gorge. Permits are required.


When to visit and what to bring

The winter season, between May and October, is best for trekking as days are 
warm and dry but not unpleasantly hot. However, it can get very cold at night 
so bring warm clothes and sleeping bags. Supplies and cooking equipment are 
necessary for camping and for stays at Takarakka. Further information is 
available atcapriconholidays.com.au <http://www.capricornholidays.com.au/> and
