Key points

In a speech in Westminster, Andrea Leadsom, the leading pro-Brexit candidate 
for leadership of the Conservative party,appeared to ditch the economic 
strategy of her former boss George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/07/tory-leadership-andrea-leadsom-promises-prosperity-not-austerity>
 and sought to reassure the financial markets that Britain could cope with 
leaving the EU.


She said the lower pound would be good for exports and claimed the stock 
market had already recovered. To cheers from supporters, Leadsom said she 
wanted to “banish the pessimists” in a speech that blended patriotism with 
aspirational values.

Together we will write another great chapter of prosperity and tolerance and 
hope.

Verdict

Buy shares in Michael Gove. On Tuesday night, after the results of the first 
round of theConservative leadership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership> election came 
out, it looked as if Leadsom was the overwhelming favourite to come second – 
meaning Gove would drop out, and Leadsom and Theresa May would be on the 
shortlist of two in the ballot of party members.

It was very hard to see where Gove would find the votes to catch her up. But 
after that speech I’m not so sure – because it was so dire it would be 
surprising if some of her supporters did not start to have second thoughts.

On Wednesday afternoon her team sent out an operational note to journalists 
saying she would be making “a major speech on the economy”. In the event, we 
got nothing of the sort. The problem was not that it was short, because it is 
not difficult to say something interesting and meaningful in a few hundred 
words. What was so awful was that it was trite – little more than a catalogue 
of slogans about optimism and Britain having a bright future. People who put 
themselves forward as a future prime minister normally have clear ideas of what 
they want to do. Leadsom had an opportunity to reveal her own ideas today, but 
the cupboard seemed empty.

It is not just me saying this. This is from ITV’s Chris Ship.

‘What do we want? Leadsom for leader!’ Supporters march on parliament

Does this mean Gove will really beat Leadsom in the ballot on Thursday? Who 
knows? We get the results shortly after 4pm. Leadsom got 66 votes on Tuesday, 
and Gove got 48. There are 34 Stephen Crabb votes up for grabs, but it is 
thought almost all of those will go to May. There are also 16 Liam Fox votes 
available, but even if all of those went to fellow hawkish leaver Gove (and 
they won’t, because Fox is voting for May), on their own they would not allow 
Gove to overtake Leadsom. Butthe doubts about Leadsom’s CV, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/06/andrea-leadsoms-cv-prompts-new-questions-about-career>
 which first emerged after Tuesday night, will have damaged her, and the latest 
speech raises serious doubts about her credibility as a future PM.


In one sense, though, she might benefit. There has been speculation about May 
supporters voting tactically for Gove, in the belief that May would find it 
easier in a membership ballot to beat Gove (assassin of the Tory grassroots 
idol Boris Johnson) than Leadsom (Thatcher-wannabe Brexiteer). However, Gove, 
for all his faults, is a proper political heavyweight. Maybe some of May’s 
supporters will look at Leadsom’s speech today and conclude that in a two-month 
leadership contest she would crumble.
