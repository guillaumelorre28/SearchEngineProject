“When I grow up, I want to be an architect” isn’t something you often hear in 
the classroom. Shrinking school budgets – combined with exam pressures and a 
over-crowded curriculum – means there just isn’t enough time for young people 
to learn about the creative fields and their related careers. When the National 
Society for Education in Art and Designsurveyed its members 
<http://www.nsead.org/downloads/survey.pdf> last year, it found that 38% of 
teachers working at key stage 2 believed their school was allocating less time 
for art and design. At secondary level, far fewer people are continuing their 
studies of creative subjects: entries to design and technology GCSE havefallen 
by almost a third <http://www.baccforthefuture.com/press-coverage--news> (27%) 
in five years.

But in today’s world of technology overload, it’s important we connect 
children with their physical environment and help them to understand how the 
things around us are made. Doing so allows children to develop creative and 
problem-solving skills.

One way to get children inspired about design is to set a creative brief. 
These help bring learning to life, and can form a good alternative to a 
traditional homework exercise. Here are some tips on getting started.

Mission possible
I like to call my design briefs missions. Most children are familiar with that 
word from books, films or video games. When you send children on a mission, 
they have an objective and can start visualising the end result. It’s the 
process between the two that’s the important bit, of course. That’s where the 
learning comes.

Start with an ideas generation exercise
Before children start making, it’s important they sketch their initial ideas. 
This is not about being artistic – it’s more about getting ideas down on a 
page. Keep things simple with a pencil and paper – no materials or computer at 
this stage or they may get carried away with the tools rather than their own 
ideas.

Go hunting for design materials 
If children want to build a physical structure, encourage them to go beyond 
the usual paper and plasticine. Suggest children try to find something 
unexpected at home – as long as they ask permission from their parents before 
using it.

Don’t be scared of the technology 
I’ve been working in 3D software for children for six years and the scene has 
changed massively. The programmes have become much more user friendly and also 
more widely available. Programmes such asAutodesk 3D Design 
<http://www.123dapp.com/design> are free, and easy to use and you can find our 
tutorial videos

 on the Serpentine Galleries website.

A little guidance goes a long way
Encourage children to think freely and independently by emphasising no idea is 
a bad idea. This is something I teach my students at university, too. At the 
beginning of a project, anything is possible. It’s only later on you start 
filtering out the elements that don’t work. If children make a mistake, 
encourage them to sketch over it. In the Serpentine Galleries’Build Your Own 
Pavilion workshops <http://buildyourownpavilion.serpentinegalleries.org/>, 
which I facilitate across the country, we don’t even give out rubbers. That 
way, children learn how to adapt their ideas, rather than just starting again.

Don’t forget to set a deadline
This is another real-world element of any design brief. It’s important for 
children to learn the notion of a deadline and that you can’t work on one thing 
forever. Set the timeframe from the start of the exercise and given them clear 
reminders throughout, while also encouraging them to stay calm.
