Mining shares are leading the market higher as the weaker dollar boosts 
commodity prices.

But easyJet has fallen 13p to £15.11 despite a 5.7% rise in passenger numbers 
in May compared to a year ago. The load factor, a measure of capacity 
utilisation, dipped marginally from 91.6% to 91.5%.

But the airline reported 173 flight cancellations during the month, hit by a 
French air traffic control strike and poor weather conditions. The month also 
saw the Egypt Air crash which affected consumer confidence.

Among the miners Anglo American has added 46.6p to 664.5p, Rio Tinto has risen 
103.5p to 1998.5p andBHP Billiton is 44.1p better at 877.7p. In all seven out 
of the top ten risers in the FTSE 100 are mining companies. Mike van Dulken, 
head of research at Accendo Markets, said: 

Mining stocks are topping the FTSE100 this morning as the commodities space 
benefits from a weaker US dollar basket, back below the key 95 level for first 
time in a fortnight. The currency’s reversal of recent strength comes in 
response to Friday’s surprisingly weak May US jobs report that must be 
considered a setback for Janet Yellen and [the Federal Reserve] in terms of 
ability to tighten US monetary policy further this summer.

Overall the FTSE 100 is up 47.03 points at 6256.66 despite a fall in sterling 
on growing Brexit fears, as new polls show the Leave campaign in the 
ascendency. Housebuilders have also been hit by concerns about the referendum 
result, withBerkeley Group down 50p at £31.89 and Barratt Developments down 7p 
at 571p.
