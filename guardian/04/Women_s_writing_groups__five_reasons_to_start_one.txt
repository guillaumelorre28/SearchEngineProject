I'm establishing a women's writing collective at the Institute of Education. 
This will be a women-only space dedicated to promoting and supporting women's 
writing. So far, the idea has generated a lot of interest, most of it positive. 
I'm pleasantly surprised – I was anticipating at least a handful of disparaging 
responses or flippant references to hippy collectives of the 1970s. Indeed, in 
a competitive academic environment, the idea of a women's writing collective is 
provocative, and intentionally so.

Such a group recognises the value of bringing like-minded women together in 
the pursuit of individual or collaborative writing endeavours. It recognises 
the existence of gender-specific barriers to writing and publishing in academia 
and presents a radical departure from the gender-neutral initiatives that 
modern universities often provide to encourage us to write (read: publish).

As a collective, the group is aimed at women who share a common interest in 
writing and is organised and driven by the research interests of all those who 
attend. And, yes, the collective is also intended to recognise the value and 
progress made by those university women's groups – writing or otherwise – that 
have preceded us.

In developing the idea of the writing group, I sought to identify other such 
networks in universities. I wanted to learn from best practice. What is the 
optimal size for a group? How often should we meet? And what format should our 
sessions take? Given the positive response to the idea in my own university, I 
was convinced that other such groups must be in operation elsewhere.

So far, my online search has been in vain. I have not been able to identify a 
single women's writing group within a UK university. Perhaps they are hidden 
from external view because they are informal, discreet affairs with lunchtime 
meetings (though if I can't find you, how do other people?). Perhaps they have 
simply gone out of fashion. Whatever the reason, I find myself spreading the 
word and seeking to inspire a network of women's writing collectives.

 If you are already running a group then please do share your experience in 
the comments below. And if you are not, here are five good reasons for setting 
one up in your university or institution:

1) Writing groups work
Evidence suggests that writing support groups have a positive impact on 
publication rates <http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07294360500453053>
 and provide members of the group with the support, encouragement and 
motivation.

2) Collectives can support individuals 
Writing and publishing research is an integral part of academia and studies 
remind us that the productivity of individual scholars affects their academic 
status and success. With evidence thatwomen don't publish as much men 
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01425692.2011.596387#.UuI_UhlFA4M>, 
any initiative that actively encourage women's writing also serves to enhance 
their career development.

3) We need a gender-specific approach 
Research suggests that there are a range of gender-specific barriers that 
inhibit women's writing potential (roles in the university that see women adopt 
greater teaching and pastoral responsibilities witha lower priority for 
research and dissemination activities 
<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2009/200934/>, for example).

4) Writing groups are an achievable goal 
While there are a wide range of structural or organisational factors that 
inhibit women's writing potential (time, energy, desire), an informal, regular 
meeting with colleagues is a pragmatic and viable measure that we can all take.

5) Let's rediscover the pleasure of writing 
In an academic culture that is driven by productivity, a women's writing 
collective can remind us that writing is also a satisfying and pleasant 
endeavour. Moreover, a women's group can provide a platform to explore and 
encourage new and innovative types of writing and dissemination of researchers' 
work.
