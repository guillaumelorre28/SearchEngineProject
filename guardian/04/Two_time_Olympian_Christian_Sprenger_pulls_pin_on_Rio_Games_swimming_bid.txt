Christian Sprenger believes he could make Australia’s swim team for this 
year’s Olympics, he just does not feel it would be the right thing to do.

The London 2012 100m breaststroke silver medallist has hung up his goggles 
rather than pursue a third Olympic appearance at Rio, citing a lack of 
motivation and underwhelming performance.

The 30-year-old is hampered by a shoulder condition and says while he still 
thinks he could qualify for the Games, he would merely be making up the numbers 
rather than chasing success.

“The realisation was I was trying to push myself to the Olympics because 
that’s what I’ve always done,” Sprenger said. “But to be performing at those 
high levels on the world stage you need to have that natural will, natural 
heart and soul.

“I have no sort of feeling towards the water right now. I look at it and I 
don’t really want to dive in at this moment. That’s a good indication that 
things are where they’re supposed to be.”

The Brisbane-based swimmer’s decision, particularly in an Olympic year, has 
many scratching their heads but the man himself says he isn’t an athlete who 
competes merely to qualify for a team.

“I probably have good enough times to get straight on the Olympic team, but a 
third Olympics you don’t just want to make the team, you want to go and 
perform,” he said.

Sprenger leaves the sport satisfied, saying his London Olympic performance and 
a world championship title the following year in Barcelona were all he could 
have ever asked for.

Sprenger will now complete a business degree he is currently undertaking and 
says he’s contemplating opportunities to work in the media.
