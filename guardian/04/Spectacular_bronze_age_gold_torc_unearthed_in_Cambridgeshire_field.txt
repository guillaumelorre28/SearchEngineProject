A gigantic gold torc, so big one expert thinks it may have been worn to 
protect a pregnant woman, has been found by a metal detectorist in a ploughed 
field in Cambridgeshire. It was made from 730 grams of almost pure gold more 
than 3,000 years ago, and is regarded as the best found in England in more than 
a century.

The workmanship closely resembles one from nearby Grunty Fen, found in 1844 by 
a man cutting peat,now in the collection of the archaeology museum of Cambridge 
University

. However, like many torcs that were apparently buried for ritual reasons, that 
one had been coiled up.

The find site is within 50 miles of Must farm, the extraordinary bronze age 
village

 in the shadow of a chip factory on the edge of Peterborough.

“There was a lot going on in bronze age East Anglia,” said Neil Wilkin, the 
curator of bronze age Europe at theBritish Museum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/british-museum>, “but it’s been a while 
since we’ve had anything as hefty as this.”

 Torcs are usually described as collars, with the longer ones thought by some 
to have been worn as belts, but Wilkin checked in shops and said this torc was 
longer than even extra-large waist measurements of men’s trousers.

Wilkin said they were never found buried with the remains of the dead, and 
were clearly associated with life – he wondered if it could have been loaned by 
the tribe to be worn as protection by a woman in late pregnancy.

Alternatively, he thought it could have been a magnificent ornament to give 
extra value to an animal about to be sacrificed, adding: “It would fit a goat 
or a sheep.”

The site and the finder have remained anonymous, but the discovery was 
reported to the local finds liaison officer through the network of 
archaeologists recording such finds – including treasure which must by law be 
reported and voluntary reporting of lower value but historically priceless 
finds. TheTreasure and Portable Antiquities schemes <https://finds.org.uk/> are 
run through the British Museum, which reported the latest haul of 1,008 
treasure objects and 82,272 archaeological finds in England and Wales.

The torc was reported to Helen Fowler at a finds meeting at Peterborough 
Museum, who said she was “gobsmacked” when it came out of the finder’s 
briefcase. The last torc she had handled was bracelet sized, but this one was 
far too big to fit on her weighing scales and she had to borrow a box from the 
museum to take it back to her office.

Wilkin said the workmanship was astonishing: the torc was shaped from a square 
section bar of gold, and then twisted and burnished. “If you take callipers, 
and measure the gaps between the twists, they are absolutely spot on accurate.”

The torc is still being valued, but it is hoped Ely Museum will acquire it, 
with the reward shared between finder and landowner. The slightly shorter and 
lighter Corrard torc, found in Northern Ireland, was valued at up to £150,000 
three years ago.

One of the oddest recent treasure finds was a criminal’s hoard of hundreds of 
what look like blackened toenail cuttings, from Gloucestershire. They proved to 
be clipped fragments of 463 silver coins, dating from the reigns of Charles I 
and II, some with the names of the monarchs still legible, snipped off neatly 
with shears when the Treasury had offered to swap the new machine-made currency 
for the old handmade coins. Clipping meant the person got a new coin and a 
little scrap of valuable silver – a capital offence. “It’s an interesting 
question why this hoard was never retrieved and melted down – maybe he was 
hanged,” said the British Museum coins expert Barrie Cook of the onetime owner.

Other finds included a unique object, though there must originally have been 
at least two more identical pieces: a looped mount for an Anglo-Saxon hanging 
bowl, beautifully inlaid with coloured enamel and glass. It was found in a 
field near Littlehampton, West Sussex, by Tyndall Jones, a retired sports 
outfitter. He felt shy about showing it to his local finds officer, because he 
feared it might be comparatively modern.

“I was quite surprised when I showed it to her and she was absolutely jumping 
up and down with excitement,” he said. It was valued at up to £1,500, and Jones 
offered to buy out the landowner’s share so he could give it to Littlehampton 
Museum, but instead they agreed a joint donation. “It’s such a pleasure finding 
a piece like this,” Jones said, “but I never felt I was the owner, only the 
caretaker. It should be seen by more people.”
