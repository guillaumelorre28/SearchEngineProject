Judy Garland’s daughter Lorna Luft is to step into her mother’s ruby slippers 
for a career-spanning new show, Judy: The Life and Music of a Hollywood Legend.

With Arlene Phillips <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arlene-phillips>
 as creative director, the show is billed as the only one authorised by the 
late star’s estate. It is set to thread together never-before-seen film clips 
and interviews with live performances of Garland songs including Over the 
Rainbow, Get Happy, and The Trolley Song.

As well as appearing in productions of classic American musicals like White 
Christmas, Follies, and Guys and Dolls, Luft has frequently performed her 
mother’s music. She joined Rufus Wainwright for a duet of After You’ve Gone 
during Wainwright’s recreation of Garland’s 1961 Carnegie Hall concert, and 
released the album Lorna Luft: Songs My Mother Taught Me, a collection of 
Garland hits produced by Barry Manilow. She even took a role in a stage 
production of The Wizard of Oz – but played the Wicked Witch of the West, 
rather than Dorothy. Luft was born in 1952 to Garland and Sid Luft, her third 
husband who helped finance A Star is Born, featuring Garland’s greatest 
late-period performance.

The show will co-star Wicked mainstay Louise Dearman and fellow musical 
theatre veteran Ben Richards. It will debut at the Edinburgh Playhouse on 8 May 
before touring across the UK.
