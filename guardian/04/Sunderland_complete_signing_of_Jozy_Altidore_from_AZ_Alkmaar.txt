Sunderland have completed the signing of the USA striker Jozy Altidore from 
the Dutch sideAZ Alkmaar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/azalkmaar> on a 
four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

The 23-year-old arrived on Wearside on Tuesday to complete a medical and he 
became the manager Paolo Di Canio's sixth signing of the summer.

Altidore began his career in Major League Soccer with the New York Red Bulls 
before joining Villarreal in 2008.

He spent time on loan at Xerez, Besiktas and Hull â€“ scoring one league goal as 
the Tigers headed for relegation from the Premier League in the 2009-10 season.

The striker agreed a permanent move to AZ in July 2011 and finished his first 
season in Holland with a haul of 22 goals in all competitions before adding 23 
for the 2012-13 Eredivisie season, helping the club to a first KNVB Cup in 31 
years.

Altidore has also scored 17 goals in 60 appearances for his country after 
making his senior debut in 2007. He ended a lengthy goal drought in an 
international friendly victory over Germany in Washington DC last month.

He joins the goalkeeper Vito Mannone, defenders Valentin Roberge and Modibo 
Diakite, midfielder Cabral and winger David Moberg Karlsson as part of Di 
Canio's new-look squad and the club confirmed he is expected to join his new 
team-mates at their training camp in Italy.
