Wigan Athletic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> have 
signed the Almería winger Albert Crusat on an initial two-year deal for an 
undisclosed fee. The 29-year-old underwent a medical on Monday and has now 
finalised his contract, which has an option for a third year if his stay is a 
success.

"Albert is someone we have been trailing for a long time and it is fantastic 
news that we have managed to get him," said the manager, Roberto Martínez.

"He will add something completely new to the squad, he has electric speed, 
really quick feet and has played over 150 games in La Liga. He is an explosive 
player, who understands how to affect games with his attributes, having earned 
his long experience in such a competitive, tactical and demanding league as La 
Liga.

"I am confident he can adapt quickly to the demands of the Premier League. I 
think our fans will take to him because he is a really exciting player who can 
bring a crowd to their feet."
