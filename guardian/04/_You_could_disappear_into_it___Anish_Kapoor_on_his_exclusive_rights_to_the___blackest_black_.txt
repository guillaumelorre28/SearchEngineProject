In Seoul for the opening of his Gathering Clouds exhibition at the Kukje 
Gallery, the British artistAnish Kapoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor> is discussing his 
controversial deal with developers of Vantablack: the “blackest black” pigment 
of paint, a colour Kapoor now owns exclusive rights to use.


After reading a newspaper story about the discovery of the pigment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2014/jul/14/vantablack-nanofabric-new-black>
 – which “we think is the blackest material in the universe, after a black 
hole”, Kapoor says – the excited artist contacted the British manufacturers, 
NanoSystem, and offered to collaborate with them.

The pigment is comprised of microscopic stems of colour that are 300 times as 
tall as they are wide, so that about 99.6% of all light “just gets trapped in 
the network of standing segments”, he explains. “It’s literally as if you could 
disappear into it.”

The pigment was being developed for scientific and military use due to its 
“masking ability” – it has the potential to hide stealth aircrafts and block 
out all light from entering “super powerful” telescopes, enabling them to see 
the faintest stars.

Kapoor, who immediately recognised its artistic potential, has been working 
with the pigment since 2014 but says it’s proving difficult to make sufficient 
quantities to apply to any artworks, because of its density.

“They were only able to make bits that are 2cm square [at a time] and what we 
are trying to do at the moment is try and make a certain bulk of it,” Kapoor 
says.

“[Vantablack] is very technical. It needs like a furnace – pressure and heat – 
before this material can do what it does, [which is] become super black,” he 
says. “It’s necessarily a collaboration between them and me. I say, ‘C’mon guys 
– we can make it bigger and we can make it applicable in others ways.’”

The artist was attracted to the pigment not only because he felt strong 
emotion when he saw it (the closest experience, he said, would be staring into 
a black hole) but because he had long been interested in working with “void 
forms”, and the pigment would be entirely non-reflective.

But when Kapoor won exclusive rights to the material in February, it came with 
backlash from the artistic community. “I’ve never heard of an artist 
monopolising a material,” the artist Christian Furr told the Daily Mail. “All 
the best artists have had a thing for pure black – Turner, Manet, Goya … This 
black is like dynamite in the art world. We should be able to use it. It isn’t 
right that it belongs to one man.”

Kapoor defended his exclusive use of the material: “Why exclusive? Because 
it’s a collaboration, because I am wanting to push them to a certain use for 
it. I’ve collaborated with people who make things out of stainless steel for 
years and that’s exclusive.”

He believes much of the debate comes down to emotion. “The problem is that 
colour is so emotive – especially black ... I don’t think the same response 
would occur if it was white.”

Kapoor, who has had two decades of psychotherapy, said it’s the “psycho side” 
of black that makes us want to possess it.

“Perhaps the darkest black is the black we carry within ourselves,” he says. 
“It’s not the night where you switch the lights off – it’s the night where you 
close your eyes. There’s a psycho side to blackness that we don’t associate 
with other colours readily. I suspect red does the same. I’ve worked with red a 
great deal, for not dissimilar reasons.”

Kapoor’s fascination for the non-reflective pigment is particularly 
interesting in light of the centrepiece of his new exhibition at Seoul’s Kukje 
Gallery. Made from reflective stainless steel, the sculptures are twisted to 90 
degrees, distorting the viewer’s reflection when they walk around the work. It 
is disorienting, almost an anti-selfie work of art, in contrast to the 
Instagram-friendly installations that seem to be taking over major spaces; it’s 
tempting to take a picture but your reflection is twisted and deformed.

“I have been trying out these forms for a number of years,” Kapoor says of his 
Non Objects series, to which these new sculptures belong. Fabricated from 
mirrored forms and concave objects, the sculptures investigate the “in-between 
state” of objects whose internal makeup is at odds with their surface.

“In a way they are technological but they are also a very, very simple idea. I 
have been deeply interested over a long period of time in geometry. I’m 
interested in taking certain forms, triangles, squares and turning them into 
something else ... It’s a stupid, simple idea but it does something – it 
becomes something else.”

Kapoor is still bemused by another controversy that recently dogged him. Last 
year in France, his Versailles Garden public art show, Dirty Corner, was dubbed 
“The Queen’s Vagina” – and landed him in court.

“That became hugely controversial, I still don’t know why,” he says. “It 
seemed to offend people for reasons I can’t understand.”

 The work was defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, which Kapoor refused to 
remove to make a statement on “humanity’s intolerance” – a decision that saw him
sued by a Versailles politician

. The sculpture (and graffiti) was later covered in gold leaf.

“It’s interesting that the work got sexualised,” Kapoor says. “Our cities are 
full of masculine objects. No one makes the slightest noise about another 
phallus on the horizon but it seems a vagina is really a problem.”

Kapoor says the response to the work says more about the people than his own 
artistic intentions.

“All I ever did in an interview was use the word ‘she’ – I didn’t use the word 
‘vagina’. I said, ‘She sits here in on the lawn’,” he says. “It’s interesting 
[that], when it got named as a feminine sexual object, all the hate came out – 
real hate. So I decided to leave it there.

“You can’t make art for other people. You can’t make art for an audience – the 
work has to live the story of itself in a way.”

<https://www.kukjegallery.com/KJ_exhibitions_view_1.php?ex_no=195&v=1/> is on 
view at Kukje Gallery, Jongno-gu, Seoul, until 30 October

• This article was amended on 26 September 2016. An earlier version 
incorrectly stated that Kapoor had used Vantablack in a public artwork. It also 
referred to Kapoor as an “architect and artist”; he has completed architectural 
projects, but is not trained as an architect.
