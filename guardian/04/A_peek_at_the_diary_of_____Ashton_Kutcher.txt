No way am I going to relax now I have a million followers on Twitter. People 
thought I would relax after Dude, Where's My Car? But instead I looked forward 
- to Seriously Dude, Where's My Car? I'm constantly evolving. Or rather, I'm 
constantly subdividing into new media iterations in which I retain precisely 
the same level of affable, unthreatening semi-idiocy.

Besides, I now control Earth's most valuable communications resource: instant 
access to one million people who want to know whatAshton Kutcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ashton-kutcher> is thinking of having as a 
mid-afternoon snack. Imagine if you could harness that power to do stuff like 
bring back cravats or ask innocuous questions such as "I heard u can get swine 
flu from bacon - tru??"

Take the other day. I took a picture of my wife Demi's ass, uploaded it, and 
within minutes the entire internet was looking at it. Think of the 
possibilities - I'm thinking "Your ad here". It's cougartising, man!

So much of what I do is about adding value for the followers. We do really 
great plotlines, where I'll tweet a movie line and Demi won't get the reference 
and will tweet back something like "uh o shd I be woried?" It's a lot of fun. 
And this way, not only do we get to perform even when we're not working - which 
is apparently every waking second - but people get to be near our special 
energy without incurring a restraining order.

So forget "Twitterati"- the neologism for me has yet to be invented. 
Twillionaire? Twit-magnate? Y not let me kno, guys?! I can't follow myself!
