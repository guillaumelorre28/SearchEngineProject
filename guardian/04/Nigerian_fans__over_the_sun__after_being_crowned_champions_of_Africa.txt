Make una no vex, I'm running on less than two hours of sleep, and for good 
reason. Scratch that, FOR GREAT REASON. Thirteen years of sorrow, hurt and pain 
were wiped out in an instant a few hours ago as I watched Joseph Yobo lift that 
golden goblet over his head to proclaimNigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigeria-football-team> the number one 
football side on the African continent. UP EAGLES!!!

Okay, let's get serious. I don't know what to write. Should this be a match 
review? Or should it be a celebration piece? It doesn't matter to me. What 
matters is that I'm over the moon. Scratch that, I'M OVER THE SUN!!!

When the teams began lining out, a bit of fear gripped me. Irrational fear. I 
had been invited for a late lunch with some rich kids, and for some reason, I 
began to think back to the 2000 final match when for the first (and only time 
in my life as it will never happen again), I took a ticket (it was given to me 
free) to sit among celebrities. That was for Nigeria's final against Cameroon 
in Lagos, a moment when I abandoned the area boys for the comforts of the big 
life, and sat beside the then Senate President, watching Cameroon's Rigobert 
Song steal the trophy from us.

As has become the habit in final matches recently, the opening few minutes 
were cagey, but Victor Moses decided to go against that script and ran at the 
Burkinabe defence. Sadly, Ike Uche, though in Joburg, had somehow not made it 
to the stadium. Earlier in the day, a friend of mine had predicted that if 
Nigeria failed to score in the opening 30 minutes,Burkina Faso 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/burkina-faso> would win. As the 30-minute 
mark slowly came upon us, that prediction began to dance around my head and I 
don't think I have been that depressed, or nervous, in a very long time. Layi, 
e no go better for you.

Then, on 40 minutes, the moment of magic. Brown Ideye won a sixes and sevens 
clash with Kalidou Koulibaly his opposite number, then the absent Ike Uche, for 
a brief moment remembering what he had come to SouthAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> to do, seized on the loose ball, 
laid it square to the brilliant Moses, who parted the Burkinabe defence like 
the Red Sea and took a shot. Blocked by the platinum blonde Djakaridja Koné. As 
providence would have it, the ball fell to the on-rushing Sunday Mba, who said 
"Mba" ("No" in Igbo), and measured the height of Mohammed Kofi with his right 
foot, dinked through Madi Panandétiguiri and Bakary Koné before the ball had 
come down and then took a brilliant shot with his left foot. Keeper Daouda 
Diakite could only watch in admiration as the ball settled in the left hand 
corner of his net. At that moment, for me, 13 years of hurt ever since that 
Rigobert Song penalty left me walking dazed on the streets of Surulere, were 
erased. It was a goal. And what a goal!

The second half began with the Super Eagles dictating play, and the Stallions 
still on the back foot, slowly, as was to be expected in a final, beginning to 
crank up the pressure. A few heart stopping moments as Moses contrived to miss 
an open goal and Vinnie Enyeama, with the second most important touch of the 
tournament, saved Fair play to the Burkinabe. They showed that they were no 
push overs, but the day belonged toNigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>. For the records, during half time, 
I left the elitist enclave of the rich kids, and drove to the more habitable 
hole of a friend so I could watch the game in as unrestrained a manner as 
possible.

Great moment of the game: when the referee ended proceedings and confirmed us 
as African champions. Goalie, Vincent Enyeama ran over and attempted to lift 
the referee sky high. Bros Vinnie, we are still waiting for you to redeem your 
promise. Prior to the tournament, Enyeama had promised that if Nigeria won it, 
he would dance naked. I want to see his ding-dong dinging on my television 
screen.

Great moment after the game. Calling up ALL of my Ghanaian friends at an 
ungodly hour to remind them who is boss. UP EAGLES!!!

Cheta Nwanze was one of the few Nigerians who believed in the Super Eagles 
ahead of the tournament. His predictions for the team proved remarkably astute: 
on Keshi, on Mikel Obi, on the quality of the locally based players, on the 
team's wealth of attacking options when others were lamenting the omission of 
Osaze Odemwingie and Obafemi Martins. Thepreview he wrote for Africa is a 
Country 
<http://africasacountry.com/2013/01/17/african-cup-of-nations-preview-nigerias-super-eagles-back-cautiously-optimistic-for-once/>
 is well worth revisiting.

Addendum: As you'd expect Twitter was on fire yesterday. Here's a bunch of our 
favourite tweets sent during the big game:

them like bread."

Last time I saw Sunday Mba's club, Warri Wolves, they were involved in the 
most outrageous fix. Great guys though.—

This is what happens when you pick a strong local coach who's willing to drop 
the big names. Top work Stephen Keshi#afcon

Yet another case made for African coaches for African teams. #Afcon2013

He is Stephen Keshi. He does what he wants, drops who he wants and wins what
