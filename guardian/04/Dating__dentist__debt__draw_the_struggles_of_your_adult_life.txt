When you’re a kid, no one tells you how tough being an adult is going to be.

There’s the endless (failed) attempts to budget, successfully organise nights 
out, wash clothes, cook, sustain/ find relationships, pay bills – and all this 
must be done while trying not to get fired.


Chaz Hutton <https://www.instagram.com/p/926FTjm9bX/?taken-by=instachaaz>, a 
London-based designer and illustrator, has captured the struggles of adulthood 
on hisInstagram feed, with hilarious results

He’s not the only person to do this. Illustrator Samantha Jayne creates witty 
words and drawings to explore the transition from youth to adulthood, focusing 
on the so-called “quarter-life crisis” and the complexities of growing up in 
modern times.
