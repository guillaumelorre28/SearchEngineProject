Here at the Guardian Small Business Network we know that some of the best 
advice, insight and inspiration for running a business can be found right in 
the heart of the SME community - from other small businesses. Until July 3 we 
are looking for small businesses to share their most useful and inspiring 
business advice with fellow SMEs for a chance to win £50,000 of advertising 
with the Guardian.
