Richard Baker has taken his first prominent City role since the private 
equity-backed takeover ofAlliance Boots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceboots> in 2007, succeeding 
Anthony Habgood as chairman of Whitbread.

Baker has been a non-executive at the Costa Coffee and Premier Inn owner since 
2009 and will take up his new role at the start of September. Habgood is 
retiring after nine years in the job.

The former Asda executive, who is also chairman of Virgin Active Group and DFS 
Furniture, is best known for his tenure at Boots the Chemist between 2003 and 
2007. On his watch it merged with Alliance UniChem in 2005 and two years later 
Baker agreed the £11bn sale to private equity firm KKR. He is expected to 
reduce his other business commitments over the next six months.

Whitbread <https://www.theguardian.com/business/whitbread>, which made 
underlying pre-tax profits of £411.8m on sales of £2.3bn last year, has 
ambitious growth plans. By 2018 its chief executive Andy Harrison plans to have 
increased the size of the Premier Inn chain by 45% to around 75,000 UK rooms 
and to have roughly doubled sales at Costa to £2bn.

Sir Ian Cheshire, Whitbread's senior independent director who oversaw the 
appointment, said it had conducted a "thorough search" with the help of 
executive search consultants. "We were lucky enough to have a very strong field 
of potential candidates but at the end it was clear to us that Richard was the 
best choice," he said. "He has a very strong record in both managing and 
chairing consumer businesses."
