I check my look in the mirror 
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I wrote some dumb stuff way back when. Sure, my jeans got a little muddy 
at Glastonberry last weekend, but why would I want to change my hair or face? I 
may be 60 this year, but there ain't a grey hair around and my face ain't so 
bad either. Patti asked why there isn't a line anywhere. I told her, girl, you 
want it, you take it, you pay the price.

The Brit bands at Glastonberry were pussies. Man, you can't have skinny car 
wrecks like Blah headlining when they can barely stand for 90 minutes. They 
need to hit the gym, know what I'm sayin'? If you ain't still rockin' after 
three hours, you're nowhere. Hell, but for that fascist curfew, we woulda 
proved it all night.

If my back wasn't giving me hell, I coulda imagined I was back in Asbury Park 
not Hyde Park. It's cool to get away from that stadium gig shit and reconnect 
with our blue-collar draft-dodger fans, drinking warm beer in the soft summer 
rain.

On the freeway out to Heathrow, I kicked back with Nils. "Y'know, we should do 
more of this free festival thing. I've kinda had it with sponsorship deals, 
corporate hospitality, weekend hippies and selling out to the Man," I say

"That's cool, Brooce," he drawls. "But didn't we sign an exclusive deal to 
sell our last album through Wal-Mart?"

"Don't mess with the Boss, Nils."

Keep the faith.
