Looking down the list of Meryl Streep’s Oscar nominated performances is to be 
awed by a career which has put the virtues of intensely observed and 
technically accomplished character acting at an absolute premium: the arc of 
her career is not a simplistic morph from sexy romantic lead to cantankerous 
old dame — although in some ways it is always a shock to revisit her 
(un-Oscared) performance inWoody Allen’s Manhattan <http://vimeo.com/29970816>, 
and be reminded of just how beautiful a young woman she was. Hardcore Streep 
fans might also fantasise about getting the Academy somehow to recognise her 
improvised mini-performance on BBC News, in the UK to promote The Iron Lady, in 
which she appeared to fall briefly but passionately in love with the arts 
correspondentWill Gompertz 
<http://www.jla.co.uk/artist/will-gompertz#.VLkH12SsXGI>.

Anyway, here is a quick rundown of the Streep Oscar list in which each 
performance is given marks out of five Meryls for sexiness, charactery-ness and 
accent.

THE DEER HUNTER <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-deer-hunter> (1978)

Fantastic. Somehow Meryl could convey ordinariness and beauty at the same 
time. Her pink bridesmaid’s gown is heartbreaking.

Great stuff, and Meryl’s first Oscar win, although I think she slightly loses 
out in the empathy-acting contest with Dustin Hoffman: the title resonates with 
the unacknowledged upstaging duel these great performers are having. She has a 
big scene on the witness stand.

THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT’S WOMAN  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview12>
(1981)
Facebook

It’s a more self-conscious performance, with that slooooower British voice 
(actually, a prototype for Maggie), the black cloak and the frizzier-than-usual 
hair. Younger people who may have seen the vulgar Scottish Widows TV ad need to 
be educated as to where all that imagery comes from. In terms of upstaging 
Meryl crushes Jeremy Irons.

SOPHIE’S CHOICE (1982) 
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRaPBzhEsCL0&picture=>

Nothing established Streep’s pure acting seriousness more than this: the 
Polish-Catholic woman sent by the Nazis to a concentration camp in the second 
world war and forced to undergo a horrific personal “choice”. A big vocal 
triumph forMeryl Streep <https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep>, and her 
second Oscar win.


SILKWOOD 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/21/mike-nichols-made-films-about-women-sadly-rarity-in-hollywood>
 (1983)
Facebook

This performance as the nuclear plant worker who stumbles on a scandal put 
Meryl right back into the strain of performance she gave in The Deer Hunter in 
which herjolie-laide quality could plausibly represent working-class 
ordinariness, as opposed to distance and refinement. Her “shower” performance 
is chilling and superb — weirdly reminiscent of Janet Leigh in Psycho.

OUT OF AFRICA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/reel-history-out-of-africa> (1985)
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFfIw9xDPYOU&picture=>

This is a massive accent role for Meryl as the Danish author Karen Blixen and 
her experiences in Kenya. All Streep fans like to do her “I hett ah faaaahhm en 
Effrica….” routine, although imitations don’t quite do justice to it. Despite 
the big voice, it’s a bit reserved for me.

IRONWEED (1987) 
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dw_0TJ6GtaLM&picture=>

In terms of big acting contests, the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Meryl as 
two alcoholics is a King Kong vs Godzilla faceoff. Meryl might have lost out 
marginally to Hoffman and bested Irons but this is sort of a draw. Meryl is 
back to having a more patrician voice here, and she has a big singing scene.

A CRY IN THE DARK

It may not be the most distinguished performance, but for sheer outrageous 
voice work and empathy, maximum Meryls have to be awarded to her performance as 
Lindy Chamberlain, the real-life Australian woman accused of killing her infant 
girl. All together now:“Thet Deengo’s got my bayyyby!”

POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE (1990)

Another alcoholic role, but played relatively easier and with fewer obvious 
pyrotechnics, largely because of the more lenient comic context: she is the 
drunk and troubled movie star forced to live with her mom, played by Shirley 
MacLaine. In terms of upstaging, this is a diplomatic neutrality situation.

THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY (1995) 
Facebook

 Not my favourite Meryl. There is something a bit supercilious in the way she 
is cast as a housewife who falls for hunky dreamboat Clint Eastwood — a 
National Geographic photographer, of all the sexy, outdoorsy things. But it’s 
Meryl who should be playing the sexy photographer!

ONE TRUE THING (1998)

Another slightly soapy role for Meryl, and a film in which fans might be 
suspected she is heading for the Meryl wilderness. She plays a mum with cancer, 
which creates a crisis for her daughter, Renee Zellweger. Decent, but without 
the Meryl fire.

MUSIC OF THE HEART (1999) 
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8pnqbx8iTTM&picture=>

Another decent, relatively subdued bluecollar role in which Meryl plays a 
woman who created an inspirational high-school music programme for deprived 
city kids in New York. Her studied voice work was admired, but the Meryl magic 
is missing.

ADAPTATION <https://www.theguardian.com/film/adaptation> (2002)

 Like The French Lieutenant’s Woman, this is a levels-of-reality story. Streep 
plays New Yorker writer Susan Orlean, whose essay-turned-book about an orchid 
poacher is adapted into a movie, by Charlie Kaufman, played by Nicolas Cage. 
The awful truth is that Streep’s story is far less interesting than Cage’s — 
and he upstages her.

Meryl is right back on top with this glorious comic performance as the haughty 
Wintour-ish magazine editor. No big voices, but Streep has entered into her 
senior years with a vengeance, and her Meryl Menace blows all other actors, 
make and female, off the screen.

My least marvellous Meryl. This is undoubtedly a huge, melodramatic, accent-y 
role for Streep as the Bronx Irish nun who embarks on an obsessive campaign to 
get a priest defrocked for abuse. She has a big speech at the end, with all the 
fireworks, but I felt this glib and preposterous movie did not support the 
performance.

A big, ripe impersonation of a TV cooking queen, hugely famous in the US but 
little known in this country. Again, it’s a big turn for Meryl, but the fact 
that it relies so much on recognition means that it isn’t a mega-Meryl.

Whoa! This is a monster Meryl. Her performance as the ageing Margaret Thatcher 
is almost eerily good, and as the real life Baroness Thatcher withdrew from 
public life in her final years, it is this film, and Meryl’s interestingly 
sympathetic performance, which for good or ill may colour how succeeding 
generations and historians see Thatcher’s winter years. The voice is stunningly 
good. A third Oscar win.

I can’t be doing with this shouty, hammy, silly, stagey film, although Meryl’s 
cantankerous matriarch is pretty good value. Although is she just going through 
the Meryl motions?

I’m not a fan of this Sondheim movie, but Streep as a witch is something that 
had to be. And there is something startling about the way she is digitally 
morphed into a younger self, which made you realise that you sort of assumed 
she could sort of be about that age anyway. Like David Bowie, Meryl doesn’t 
seem really to get any older.
