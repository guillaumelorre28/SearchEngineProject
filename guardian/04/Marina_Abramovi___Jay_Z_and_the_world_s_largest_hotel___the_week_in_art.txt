 Holbein’s A Lady With a Squirrel and a Starling (c1527), National Gallery, 
London. Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images 
Hans Holbein the Younger – Lady With a Squirrel and a Starling (1526-8)
The black eye of the squirrel is the void into which reassurance vanishes in 
this penetrating, cool, perhaps ironic study of an Englishwoman. This German 
genius looked at the Elizabethans, and their pets, with an anthropologist’s 
insight and a photographer’s accuracy.
