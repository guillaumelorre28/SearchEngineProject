The fate of the Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> house featured in the 
cult film The Castle could be decided in court in real life because its owner 
wants to demolish it and build two townhouses.

But experts say the Strathmore house should be heritage-listed because of its 
social and historical significance.

Members of the Moonee Valley city council want to stop the demolition after 
external consultants investigated the postwar weatherboard home’s significance.

“Its connections with the film The Castle are the foremost aspect of its 
significance, reflecting both social and historical value,” the report states.

Councillor Narelle Sharpe requested the report and told radio 3AW she was 
“happy to move the officer’s recommendation that heritage protection is 
afforded to the site”.

The council could vote on the report as early as Tuesday night.

 In the 1997 film Darryl Kerrigan took his fight against the home’s compulsory 
acquisition by the neighbouring airport all the way to the high court.

Now the owner, Vicky Cosentino, has told News Corp Australia she would engage 
lawyers to fight any move to heritage list her house.

Premier Daniel Andrews said the Moonee Valley council needed to make its 
decision first before it could become a matter for the state government.

“I can understand how many people would feel a great attachment to that 
particular property,” he told reporters on Tuesday.

“Let’s let the process run its course.”
