The results make grim reading for anyone hoping Roy Hodgson’s men can end 50 
years of hurt by winning England’s first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup. 
The survey also shows there is not much belief on these shores of that 
happening either, with only 34% ofEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> fans surveyed stating that their 
team can triumph in France.

The research was carried out by Forza Football, a results and opinion-based 
smartphone app, which asked more than 30,000 people whose nations are taking 
part atEuro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> a range of 
questions, including who they think will win the tournament, who will be top 
scorer, how they rate their team’s chances and how they rate England’s chances 
– 80.61% answered “No” when asked “Will this be England’s year?”

France are favourites to win, with 23.56% of those surveyed backing Didier 
Deschamps’ side 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/02/france-euro-2016-team-guide> 
to triumph on home soil. Germany are second favourites (21.37%), with Portugal 
a somewhat surprising third (13.75%). Also surprisingly, only 5.83% of those 
questioned said Spain would retain their title.
Who will win it?

In Spain itself, 43.5% of those surveyed believe Vicente del Bosque’s men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/06/spain-euro-2016-team-guide> 
will repeat thesuccess they achieved in Ukraine and Poland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/01/euro-2012-spain-italy-final> 
four years ago. In France, 60.6% back their squad to win their first major 
honour sincethe 2000 European Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jul/03/euro2000.sport4>.

The 60.6% figure puts France second in Forza Football’s “self-confidence 
list”, behind Portugal (61.5%). Theworld champions, Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/football-world-cup-2014-germany-win-final-mario-goetze>
, are third (59.9%), Spain fourth and Belgium fifth (38.6%). England’s 34% 
figure puts them 10th, behind Albania (34.8%).

Somewhat oddly, given that level of pessimism in England, 45% of the people 
surveyed in the country said yes in response to a separate question about 
whether Wayne Rooney and co will reach the final, which is to be held at Stade 
deFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> on 10 July. A case, 
then, of so very close, yet so very far.

In regards to who will finish as the top scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo is the most 
popular choice, with the Portugal forward garnering 6,159 votes. Germany’s 
Thomas Müller comes second (4,849), with the France and Atlético Madrid striker 
Antoine Griezmann third (2,687). In fourth and fifth come definite reasons for 
England fans to cheer – Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane, who pulled in 1,406 and 
1,231 votes respectively, more than Robert Lewandowski (1,148),Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zlatan-ibrahimovic> (1,011), 
Anthony Martial (208) and Gareth Bale (100).
Top scorers 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-10T09:59:49/embed.html>
Only 46 of the 30,000 people surveyed by Forza Football believe Marcus 
Rashford will finish as Euro 2016’s top scorer; 46 too many, some might say.
