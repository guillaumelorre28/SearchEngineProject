Angelina Jolie in Maleficent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156636/maleficent>
Hollywood's most formidable leading lady is back after a relatively quiet 
spell, in a role playing on her scariness and seniority. This reinvented 
fairytale is a twist on The Sleeping Beauty, and Jolie is not playing the 
insipid dormant heroine with her crybaby attitude to finger-pricking but the 
evilly magnificent Maleficent, the sorceress who casts a spell on the demure 
young Princess Aurora. How did she get that way? Everything will depend on the 
script – but Jolie is always a great turn. Peter Bradshaw 30 May.

Natalie Portman in Jane Got a Gun
Natalie Portman is a Hollywood A-lister who first came to prominence in George 
Lucas'sStar Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> prequel trilogy. 
She was compellingly vulnerable in Darren Aronofsky'sBlack Swan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/20/black-swan-review>, but is also 
no snob, cheerfully appearing in the stoner comedyYour Highness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141326/your-highness>. Now Portman has 
a cowgirl role in this western about a woman who has to ask an ex-lover's help 
in defending her husband against a gang. The title calls up memories of Doris 
Day in Calamity Jane. Sleek, sexy Portman will undoubtedly be a quite different 
proposition.PB 29 August.

Timothy Spall in Mr Turner 
"National treasure" status is perhaps bestowed indiscriminately these days; 
you can get it by making consecutive weekly appearances on8 Out of 10 Cats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/jun/24/profile-jimmy-carr>. But 
Timothy Spall earned it long ago, particularly in association with the director 
Mike Leigh. This uniquely generous British actor makes a powerful impression 
without ever showing off or stealing scenes. Audiences respond to his emotional 
warmth, and he can play comedy, tragedy and anything in between. His 
performance inLeigh's film about the artist JMW Turner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2013/nov/27/mike-leigh-inspiration-jmw-mr-turner-film-tate-video>
 looks set to be a hot ticket.PB 26 September. 

Hugh Grant in The Reluctant Professor
Grant's Hacked Off activism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/21/hugh-grant-joins-hacked-off-board>
 has almost overshadowed his movie-star profile, and his brilliant investments 
in property and contemporary art mean he doesn't exactly have to take any old 
role to pay the bills. Hugh Grant is a smart, elegant romcom lead, and he's 
back in what looks like a classic Grant role, playing a washed-up screenwriter 
who is reduced to teaching. Naturally, he falls for one of his wide-eyed pupils:
Marisa Tomei <https://www.theguardian.com/film/marisa-tomei>, who may well cure 
his cynicism and depression. A must-see for his fans, which includes me.PB

Pop

Bruce Springsteen
If new Springsteen material gets you excited then prepare to be … well, 
semi-excited. The Boss's 18th studio album,High Hopes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/bruce-springsteen-new-album-high-hope>
, is due on 14 January, though it won't include fresh songs. 
Rather, Springsteen is looking back for the first time in his career, with an 
album of cover versions, reworked classics and outtakes. Of note: Tom Morello 
performs on several songs, including a new version of The Ghost of Tom Joad, 
and the Boss delivers his take on 70s avant-electro punk with a cover of 
Suicide's Dream Baby Dream.Tim Jonze

Beyoncé
Fresh from catching the entire pop world by surprise with her self-titled 
fifth album,Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/13/beyonce-beyonce-review?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487>
's Mrs Carter tour hits UK shores in February. Fans can expect a visual 
spectacular –the album Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/13/beyonce-beyonce-review?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487>
 featured more videos (17) than tracks (14), after all – with previous tours 
having sparkling catsuits, lasers and a shower of golden fireworks.TJ

Lily Allen
Allen's return to the world of pop was certainly eventful, though perhaps not 
quite as she had intended. First she made her barnstorming entrance with, er, a
Keane cover for a John Lewis advert <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWig2WARb0>
. Then she released Hard Out Here, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/17/lily-allen-hard-out-here> an 
attack on music industry sexism that ended up – along with its video –being 
accused of racism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/17/lily-allen-hard-out-here>. With 
a Glastonbury performance and her third album – apparently featuring a track 
responding toher feud with Azealia Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/12/azealia-banks-lily-allen-rose-cooper-husband>
 – 2014 looks to be a big year for Allen. Whatever she does, she probably won't 
do it quietly.TJ

Prince
After a pretty eventful year – new songs, a mini tour, hosting a pancake party 
– Prince is rumoured to make his big return in spring. The tracks he released 
in 2013, such as Breakfast Can Wait, sound like his strongest material in 
years. Best of all, his new deal with Kobalt lets him control distribution, so 
hopefully he'll be giving it away free with, say, a box of Weetabix.TJ

TV

Tubby and Enid 
Victoria Wood, originally a writer of contemporary comedy, has recently turned 
to historical pieces: the TV drama Housewife, 49 and the stage play That Day We 
Sang. This play with songs – about the famous 1929 recording of Nymphs and 
Shepherds by the Manchester Children's Choir – becomes a 90-minute television 
film, written and directed by Wood, withImelda Staunton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/imelda-staunton> and Michael Ball as 
former members of the choir who meet again in middle age at a reunion. There is 
a sense that the 2014 Christmas schedule and the 2015 Bafta nominations may 
have already filled some of their slots.Mark Lawson BBC2.

Castles in the Sky

stories. But thisbio-drama about a discovery

Theatre

Thomas Cromwell
Hero or henchman; Tudor genius or traitor to the crown? There are so many 
sides to Hilary Mantel's Thomas Cromwell it's hard to know which to believe. 
How fitting, then, that we'll get two incarnations of him, on stage and screen: 
Mark Rylance in the BBC's six-part TV version of Wolf Hall and Bring up the 
Bodies (expected in 2015); and Ben Miles in adouble bill for the RSC

The Duchess of Malfi
Gemma Arterton <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gemma-arterton> began her 
stage career at the Globe, and she returns to star as Webster's imperious 
heroine who risks all for love and loses everything – except her dignity. It's 
also the first chance to peek inside the theatre's new candlelit indoor 
playhouse – a space that should give this macabre tragedy the intensity it 
needs.AD Shakespeare's Globe

The Testament of Mary
Fiona Shaw as the Virgin Mary? It sounds unlikely, but this collaboration with 
Deborah Warner, adapted fromColm Tóibín's 2013 Booker prize shortlisted novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/10/booker-prize-testament-of-mary-shortlist-colm-toibin>

figure, torn apart by grief.Lyn Gardner Barbican, London

King Lear
Star actor Simon Russell Beale and even starrier director Sam Mendes have 
finally found space in their respective diaries for Shakespeare's tumultuous 
study of madness and desolation. It's the role of a lifetime, but will the show 
live up to the billing – and the hype?AD National Theatre

on Ibsen's Nora, Gillian Anderson gets her teeth into another trapped heroine:

the beefiest character in the canon, the wench-and booze-guzzling Sir John

Art

From the lens of David Lynch, William Burroughs, Andy Warhol
Industrial interiors from David Lynch, snapshots by William Burroughs and 
stitched-together photographs from Andy Warhol form this intriguing group show 
across three floors of the Photographers Gallery. Lynch's factory interiors, 
which were shot across eastern Europe and the US, are the most formally unified 
photographs here, while Burroughs' scattergun approach reflects a mind in 
thrall to the chance encounter. Most intriguing are Warhol's black-and-white 
shots of his daily life – interiors, streets, signage and, inevitably, celebs 
at parties – taken over the last 10 years of his life. Each series casts new 
light on their more well-known works of fiction, film and silkscreened art.Sean

The enduring Marina Abramović
Performance artist Marina Abramović has become a global phenomenon. She has, 
for her art, walked the Great Wall of China, sung lullabies while sitting on a 
heap of rotting cow's bones, been sung at by Jay Z, and served as the subject 
and star of Robert Wilson's operaThe Life and Death of Marina Abramović 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jul/10/life-death-marina-abramovic-review>
. For three months in 2010, she sat at a table in New York's Museum of Modern 
Art, all day, every day, in silent communion with her audience. This summer at 
the Serpentine, she will present a new "endurance" performance. Expect enormous 
queues.Adrian Searle Serpentine Gallery <http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/>,

 Dazzling intellectual star … Kenneth Clark at the National Gallery. 
Photograph: William MacQuitty 
Civilisation according to Kenneth Clark 
Not only did the art historian Kenneth Clark run the National Gallery and 
write definitive books on topics like Leonardo da Vinci and The Nude, he also 
showed how beautiful and serious arts television can be with his legendary 1969 
series Civilisation. Yet Clark became a figure of fun, too; in a democratic 
age, his aristocratic persona stuck out like a sore thumb. Monty Python 
satirised him as an art critic raving about "the nude in my bed". He was a 
convenient straw man for radical art historians who attacked him as a posh 
conservative lover of beauty. Today, Clark is rightly being rediscovered and 
this exhibition is an encounter with a dazzling intellectual star who put big 
ideas in clear words and gorgeous images.Jonathan Jones Tate Britain

Classical

Richard Strauss's 150th anniversary
The big questions to ask about Strauss at 150? Did his music atrophy into 
late-romantic obsolescence after his first, aggressively modernist operas? And 
was his close relationship with the Third Reich near the end of his life about 
personal pragmatism, or something more troubling? The best way to find out is 
to get stuck in to the music. Covent Garden's new staging of his longest opera, 
Die Frau ohne Schatten, directed by Claus Guth, will be one of the grandest and 
most opulent Straussian offerings of 2014, with a great cast, a thoughtful but 
controversial director, and conductor Antonio Pappano at the helm.Tom Service 
Royal Opera House, London <http://www.roh.org.uk/> (020-7304 4000), 14 March to 
2 April.

Piotr Anderszewski 
Over the last 10 years, Piotr Anderszewski has emerged as one of the great 
pianists of our time. He first attracted attention at the 1990 Leeds Piano 
Competition, when he walked off the platform during the semi-finals because he 
felt he was not playing well enough, and since then his rise has been 
characterised by that same meticulous self-criticism, resulting in playing of 
crystalline transparency and penetrating musical insight. Anderszewski strictly 
rations his recital appearances: this short UK tour in February with a 
programme of Schumann, Bartók, Szymanowski and Schubert, is one that every 
keyboard connoisseur will want to catch.Andrew Clements Turner Sims Concert 
Hall, Southampton <http://www.turnersims.co.uk/> (023 8059 5151), 11 February, 
then touring until 19 February.

Jonas Kaufmann's Die Winterreise
Though Kaufmann performs regularly in London, there's never the risk of him 
becoming the kind of circus act that great tenors sometimes become: he brings a 
freshness to everything. This spring, there are opportunities at Covent Garden 
to hear him both in Lieder and on stage – singing Schubert's song cycle Die 
Winterreise with pianist Helmut Deutsch, and in Jonathan Kent's new production 
of Puccini's Manon Lescaut, in the role of Des Grieux.AC Die Winterreise, 6 
April and Manon Lescaut: 17 June to 7 July, both at the Royal Opera House, 
London <http://www.roh.org.uk/> (020-7304 4000).

Terry Gilliam does Berlioz
The film director and Python member made his opera debut when he staged The 
Damnation of Faust for the English National Opera in 2011. Its success brought 
another invitationto direct Berlioz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/15/terry-gilliam-direct-opera-eno-faust>
. This time, unlike Faust, it's a work the composer actually wrote as an opera. 
Even so, Benvenuto Cellini is rarely seen on stage – the last British 
production was at Covent Garden in the 1970s. Berlioz's dramatisation of the 
Florentine sculptor's memoirs has its problems, but it will provide ample 
opportunity for trademark Gilliam spectacle.AC Coliseum, London
