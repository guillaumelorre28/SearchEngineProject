Robbie Williams' comeback faltered today when he was beaten to the top of the 
singles chart by the winner of last year's X Factor competition. Bad Boys by
Alexandra Burke <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke> went 
straight to no 1, ahead of Bodies, Williams' first single for two years. While 
out of the limelight the former Take That singer cultivated an interest in 
UFOs, grew a big beard and went into rehab. Last week's no 1 single, Oopsy 
Daisy by Chipmunk, the north London rapper, slipped to no 3, the Official UK 
Charts Company said. Michael Buble had the third new entry in the top 10 with 
Haven't Met You Yet.
