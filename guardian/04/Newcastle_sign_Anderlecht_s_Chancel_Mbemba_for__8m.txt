Newcastle have signed the DR Congo defender Chancel Mbemba from Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> for around £8m, subject to 
the granting of a work permit.

The 20-year-old confirmed last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/22/chancel-mbemba-newcastle-anderlecht>
 that he was on the verge of completing his move and a statement on Newcastle’s 
website revealed the club have been giving the green light to complete the 
transfer after being granted a governing body endorsement (GBE) for the player 
at a Football Association hearing on Thursday.

Mbemba, who has signed a five-year deal, has still to be granted a work permit 
but despite his country being ranked outside the top 50 by Fifa, the FA’s 
decision means it should be a formality.

Born in Kinshasha, the versatile defender becomes Newcastle’s third signing of 
the summer, after Georginio Wijnaldum andAleksandar Mitrovic
