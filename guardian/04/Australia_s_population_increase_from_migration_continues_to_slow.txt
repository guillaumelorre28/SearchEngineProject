Australia’s population increase from migration continues to slow, the latest 
data from the Bureau of Statistics show, while people are increasingly moving to
Victoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> from other 
states and territories.

Last year, the net overseas migration figure was 184,100 people, a fall of 15% 
from the previous year.Migration <https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration> 
to Australia added 473,500 people to the population, 5.3% fewer than the 
previous year.

Victoria recorded its highest interstate migration in more than 40 years, with 
most of the new arrivals – 2,700 – coming from New South Wales. This was 
followed by 2,100 from South Australia and 1,400 from Western Australia.

In Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, more people left

 the state in 2014 than arrived, but all jurisdictions increased their overall 
population thanks to the number of births exceeding the number of deaths.

The bureau’s director of demography, Denise Carlton, said overseas migration 
had peaked in 2008, and that many “push and pull factors” influenced the rate 
of this movement.

Carolyn Whitzman, a professor of urban planning at the University of 
Melbourne, said the data highlighted the need for capital cities to develop 
better plans for growth.

Australia’s population increased by 330,200 to reach 23.6m by the end of last 
year, representing a growth rate of 1.4%.


“I don’t think population growth is the problem per se, because cities like 
Melbourne have seen growth at a higher rate over much of its history,” Whitzman 
said.

“The problem is, we aren’t planning for the future. The bottom line is, 
whether Melbourne, Sydney and Perth grow at all, there is a need for better 
kinds of housing, transport and social infrastructure, like schools and 
healthcare.”

She suspected growth in jobs in the healthcare and education sectors had 
contributed to the movement to Victoria.

But it was important that the infrastructure built to support those 
industries, such as hospitals, schools and public transport, were spread 
equitably, she said.

“Unfortunately, major cities see rapid urban sprawl, coupled with 
infrastructure not catching up,” Whitzman said.

figures. The overseas migration figure refers to the difference between the 
number of immigrants and emigrants, not the absolute number of emigrants.
