Exhibition of the week

Surrealist Encounters: Collecting the Marvellous
The surrealist movement is usually looked at from the point of view of the 
poets and artists who signed up to André Breton’s idea that dreams are 
revolutionary. But this exhibition sees it from the perspective of the 
eccentrics and enthusiasts who paid the bills for all those calls on the 
lobster telephone.

<http://https//www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/on-now-coming-soon/surreal-encounters/>

Also showing

MSL and Jaakko Pallasvuo
The young Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are beamed from the optimistic 1960s 
into our own more pessimistic age in this collaborative, multimedia art project 
which mixes performance, film, paintings, costumes and props to comment on time 
travel and the death of utopia. Wow.

 Rosalba Carriera’s Portrait of a Man, 1720s. Photograph: National Gallery 
Rosalba Carriera <http://nmwa.org/explore/artist-profiles/rosalba-carriera>
This acute, sensitive and very memorable portrait of a pale Venetian dandy is 
one of a handful of works by women on view at the National Gallery. Carriera 
was acclaimed all over Europe in her own time, and this lovely pastel drawing 
shows why she deserves to be better known in ours.
