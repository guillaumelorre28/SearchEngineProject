The fact that George Michael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/05/george-michael-interview-music-sex-drugs>
 has been ignoring me for ages leads me to make the logical deduction that he 
must be mentally unwell. "We need to handle this sensitively," I informed my 
partner,David Furnish <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8401559.stm>. 
"That means you're going on5 Live <http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/> to tell 
millions of people how pained we are. Pained for George."

"Can't you do it?" sighed David.

"This is your job!" I screamed caringly. "I have stuff to buy. Get out there 
and tell the world he's lost it."

While he was at it, I rang Bono <http:>. "George needs help," I explained. 
"Can you organise a global concert in aid of sorting his head out?"

"What about one of my cool product initiatives?" he replied. "You know, every 
time someone buys aMotorola phone <http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/GB-EN/GLP>
, a percentage of the cost goes to saving George Michael."

"Look, I've already lost interest in this conversation," I said gratefully. 
"Just sort it."

The second the help had put the phone down for me, I received a text from 
George.

"Keep your hairplugs on, Lady John," it read. "In case you didn't notice – 
though, frankly, what else do you have to do on Saturday nights bar sit on the 
sofa nursing a non-alcoholic lager? – I performed my new single on theX Factor 
finale <http://xfactor.itv.com/2009/episodes/video/item_201016.htm>, the 
highest rating show of the year. I am thin (sorry, dear), I am happy and 
at some point you are going to have to realise that not wanting to see you 
isn't a sign of mental disintegration."

Well, if that isn't a cry for help, then I don't know what is.
