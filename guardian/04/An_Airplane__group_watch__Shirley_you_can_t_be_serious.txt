This Saturday, we're giving away a free DVD of Airplane! 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A5t5_O8hdA> with the Guardian as part of our 
Film Season <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/series/film-season-2010>. And we'd 
like to do something experimental with it: a communal group watch. The plan is 
that we all synchronise watches and sit down to watch the DVD at the same time, 
liveblogging and tweeting as we go.

The big question is: what time? The big caveat is: no clashing with the X 
Factor, as we'll be liveblogging that elsewhere on the site ...

Here are some options:

1) Teatime on Saturday, pre X Factor. Kick off at 5pm.

2) After the X Factor on Saturday, kicking off at about 10pm.

3) Sometime on Sunday (the Observer is giving away a free DVD of Mulholland Dr 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/90677/mulholland.drive> but we'd like to 
save that for another weekend).

So, whip out your Rolodex and let us know when works for you.
