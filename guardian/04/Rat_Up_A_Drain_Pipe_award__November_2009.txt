Paul Lewis has won this year's Rat Up a Drain Pipe award for his series of 
stories about the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London.

The Rat Up a Drainpipe trophy is awarded in memory of Tony Bevins, the first 
political editor of The Independent, who died in 2001. Bevins was famous for 
causing mischief in both the political and journalism world, and this is where 
the award takes its name.
