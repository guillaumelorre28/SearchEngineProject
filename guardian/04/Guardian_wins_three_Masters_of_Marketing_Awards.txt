The Guardian CRM (Customer Relationship Management) team has picked up three 
awards at this year’s Masters of Marketing awards.

The Guardian’s Evolve or Die project - a consumer-facing video explaining the 
importance of customers data - helped them win in the following three 
categories: ‘CRM and Loyalty’, ‘Insight and Research’, and ‘Media and 
Entertainment’.


The Masters of Marketing Awards combines Marketing Week’s Engage Awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards> and Econsultancy’s The 
Digitals - recognising the most exciting talents in the marketing industry. 
Winners will be featured in upcoming issues of Marketing Week and Econsultancy.
