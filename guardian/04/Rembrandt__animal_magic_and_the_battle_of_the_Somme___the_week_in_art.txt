Revelation and reality are disturbingly combined in this masterpiece about the 
end of the world. Saint John, a humble peasant portrayed from life, looks up as 
he writes the Book of Revelation, the part of the Bible that predicts the last 
days. An eerie glowing vision reveals the heavenly source of his information. 
The world is so solid and ordinary in this painting – but John’s vision claims 
it will all end with the coming of Antichrist.
