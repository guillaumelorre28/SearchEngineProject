The Roma defender Ashley Cole is a surprise inclusion on the Football 
Association’s online poll 
<http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/dec/ashley-cole-player-of-the-year-contender>
 to find England’s player of 2014 despite playing just 45 minutes in a friendly 
against Denmark.

The former Chelsea left-back announced his retirement from international 
football in May after being left out of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad in favour 
of Luke Shaw. Cole won his 107th and final cap in the 1-0 win at Wembley before 
being replaced at half-time by Shaw.

However, that was still enough to earn him a place on the FA’s shortlist 
alongside a number of other players, including Everton defender John Stones and 
Arsenal’s Calum Chambers.

The captain Wayne Rooney <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney> 
and goalkeeper Joe Hart are considered as the favourites to walk away with the 
award, which was last won by Steven Gerrard in 2012.
