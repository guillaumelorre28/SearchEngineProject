The Guardian has won Campaign magazine's much-coveted Medium of the Year 
<http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1109405/medium-year-guardian/> for 
"delivering compelling journalism and technical excellence for readers and 
advertisers."

The accolade recognises the Guardian's editorial and commercial success in 
2011, with the judges noting "the way it has broken some of the most resonating 
stories of the year and how it has helped to reshape the UK media scene." They 
also commented on how the Guardian's "brave multiplatform expansion" had 
"brought in new readers and shown... that it is a force to be reckoned with."

The rest of Campaign's 2011 winners are listed in their 2011 Annual
