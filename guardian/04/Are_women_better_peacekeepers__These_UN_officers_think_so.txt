Irena Dzisiewska has plenty of experience as a peacekeeper. She’s done tours 
in the Balkans and Afghanistan, and is off to join the UN mission in Mali this 
month. Dzisiewska, a lieutenant colonel in the British army, is adamant that 
women are an essential part of all peacekeeping operations - and often bring 
more to the role than men.

“For a lot of women, or even men, who have suffered sexual violence, history 
has shown us they only want to speak to women,” she told a meeting of female UN 
officers in Pretoria,South Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica> in early September.

The importance of woman in war zones was a constant theme at the gathering. 
Captain Shaden Ata Mohammed Elmanaseer, a Jordanian medic who has served in 
Gaza, Libya and Liberia, agreed.

“When a female talks to another female, when they come to hospital, they feel 
more comfortable, especially if there is a gynaecological problem.” Elmanaseer 
became her country’s first female officer deployed to the UN when she joined 
the UN Mission in Liberia in 2010 – a trailblazing accomplishment.

The UN has a particularly poor record for the number of female officers: at 
present, there are just 69 women military expertsin its 16 missions 
<http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2015/jul15_5.pdf>.


To help fix this imbalance, the UN Women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> organisation brought more than 
40 female officers together to discuss their experiences.

Participants said that it wasn’t just in responding to sexual violence that 
women have an advantage. Major Shikha Mahrotra, an Indian officer with the UN 
Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(Monusco), said the difference between men and women in conflict lies in 
emotional intelligence and empathy – traits which she says don’t always come 
naturally to her male counterparts.

When a female talks to another female, when they come to hospital, they feel 
more comfortable
Captain Shaden Ata Mohammed Elmanaseer 
“I feel as a woman peacekeeper we can do a lot, especially if we go 
patrolling, if we are in the field. If we are involved in that it makes a lot 
of difference. Women, children, the elderly – they will talk to us. With women 
they can open up easily. And being a women you can hear what they say, but also 
understand what they arenot saying, which is sometimes more important.”

Like most armies, the Indian Armed Forces does not allow its female soldiers 
to participate in combat situations. Mahrotra is adamant that this should 
change. “It’s a psychological thing. In my country men think that women should 
be protected. But I’ve taken the same training as men, and I am just as 
prepared.”

Felicia Maganwe, a lieutenant colonel in SANDF in the South African defence 
force, has an astonishing story to tell about how she has found her gender to 
impact her place in the field.


She was the company commander with a South African contingent with Monusco, 
one of a select number of females in such a senior position. “When I arrived, 
it took me a day to adjust. The second day I started setting up my base … The 
(rebel leader) said ‘But you’re a woman!’. He was surprised.”

Later in her tour, one of her operating bases was caught in dangerous 
crossfire between two rebel groups, and was being overrun by civilians seeking 
shelter. Maganwe took action: she phoned the rebel leader and demanded that he 
move the combat elsewhere. “It was easier because I was a women,” she said. The 
rebels did not feel threatened by her, and were thus more willing to negotiate. 
The rebels complied with her demands, and for her work in the Congo, Maganwe 
received a commendation as the best company commander on her mission.

Nozipho January-Bardill, a South African special adviser to UN Women, outlined 
three areas in which women peacekeepers are more effective than men.

First, they are less aggressive. “Women prefer for people not to be killed. If 
there’s a choice, women opt for life,” she said.

Second, women tend to have a better approach to dealing with conflicting 
parties. “They seem to be more effective in communicating and persuading. This 
has been tried and tested in the field.”

Third, when it comes to violence against women, female peacekeepers are 
better-placed to deal with victims, who implicitly trust women more – because 
it is almost always men who have perpetrated the violence against them.

Which raises an obvious question: would peacekeeping missions be more 
effective if the gender imbalance was reversed, if there were more female 
peacekeepers than male?


‘It’s about getting the balance right’


January-Bardill says it could work. “I think at certain levels women would be 
more effective. But women may struggle with real combat, with pulling the 
trigger. I don’t want to generalise, or speak on behalf of women. There are 
jobs that women can do where they can be effective, but not necessarily the 
aggressive part. There are some instances where the gender difference is a real 
factor. It’s about getting the balance right.”

To say [women] act as a universal tonic by virtue of their gender is untrue
John Stupart, African Defence Review 
John Stupart, editor of the African Defence Review, isn’t convinced. “Female 
peacekeepers can and do contribute in unique ways in many conflicts worldwide, 
but to say that they act as a universal tonic by virtue of their gender is 
untrue.

“Implying that they are better in all these aspects in the DRC (Congo), Darfur 
and any other peacekeeping deployment where we may send soldiers is too large 
of a generalisation. I highly doubt that a female peacekeeper is going to be 
equally beneficial in Darfur as in the DRC, as in any other vastly different 
anthropological context.

“It’s precisely this kind of cultural chauvinism that actually needs to be 
un-taught in order to make accurate, intelligent decisions when deploying 
female peacekeeping officers on a patrol or a particular mission,” he said.
