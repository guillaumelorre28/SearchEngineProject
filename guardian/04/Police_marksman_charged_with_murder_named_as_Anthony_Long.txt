The former police marksman charged with the murder of robbery suspect Azelle 
Rodney <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/azelle-rodney> can today be named for 
the first time.

Anthony Long, a former firearms officer with the Metropolitan police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police> CO19 section, will go on 
trial on 8 June, with the case expected to last around a month.

Previously referred to as E7, he can be named after reporting restrictions 
were lifted at the Old Bailey.

Long, whose address was given as the Police Federation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/police-federation> headquarters in 
Leatherhead, Surrey, did not attend the hearing before Justice Sweeney. He is 
accused of killing Rodney, who was shot by police in Edgware, north London, in 
April 2005.

Rodney, 24, died after officers stopped the car he was travelling in with two 
other men, thinking they were armed and on their way to rob Colombian drug 
dealers.

He was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the 
head.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced it planned to charge the officer in 
July, after reviewing new evidence following the outcome of a public inquiry 
into Rodneyâ€™s death.
