Broadcaster Andrew Marr <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> said a 
new treatment he received after having a stroke has resulted in subtle changes, 
but not the “dramatic improvements” he hoped for.

The BBC presenter, who had a stroke almost four years ago and remains 
semi-paralysed on his left side,travelled to Florida to try a new 
anti-inflammatory drug called Etanercept

.

Marr, who had described the treatment - which involved having the drug 
injected into the spinal fluid while hanging upside down - as a Christmas 
present to himself, said he will now work to build on the small changes he has 
seen.

Marr said in a statement: “Although I haven’t seen the dramatic improvements 
that I hoped for, there have been subtle and useful changes which I am going to 
work on through physiotherapy and exercise over the coming months.

“It hasn’t been ‘pick up thy bed and walk’ but it hasn’t been nothing, either. 
We will tell the fuller story in a BBC documentary scheduled to be broadcast in 
January.”

Marr’s stroke in January 2013

 left him spending two months in hospital and undergoing extensive 
physiotherapy to help him walk.

In a piece for the Spectator recently, talking about the new treatment, he 
detailed some of the effects of the stroke.

He wrote: “I’m not complaining too much: I can work, drink, see friends, 
paint, listen to music and irritate my children like before. I’m a lucky fellow.

“But I can’t run or cycle or swim, and I walk very unsteadily and slowly. I 
drop things and take ages to get dressed.”
