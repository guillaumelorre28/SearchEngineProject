Guardian Media Group (GMG) has been awarded $35,000 from Knight Foundation's 
Knight News Challenge to fund its proposal for a new data journalism platform, 
called Swarmize.

Swarmize aims to enable editors to conduct research with the help of readers 
by creating a platform to improve data collection, analysis and distribution of 
crowd research. It is currently being created by a team of Guardian developers 
led by General Manager, New Digital Businesses,
GMG, Matt McAlister. Read the project proposal here
