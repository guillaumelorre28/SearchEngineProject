FULL TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Anderlecht

And that’s that! Spurs were second best for the majority of the match, if 
we’re being honest, but on the other hand there’s no arguing with that 
long-distance winner from Mousa Dembele, worthy of deciding many a rumble. 
Spurs fought hard to deny a rampant Anderlecht for long periods of the second 
half, but held firm, and their reward for doing so is a win that takes them top 
of the group! There’s more than one way to win a football match, after all. 
Neutrals will feel some sympathy forAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>, and perhaps also for Jared 
Barnes (34 mins) who had a lovely joke cued up about the visitors, with Gillet 
in their team, not being ‘armless after all. Ah well.

90 min +2: Defour, playing quarterback, hits a long pass down the middle. But 
the Hail Mary doesn’t pay off, and Spurs clear with ease. Son goes off on a 
skitter to run down more of the clock.

90 min +1: Kane holds the ball up by Anderlecht’s left-hand corner flag. And 
earns a free kick. Marvellous clock management.

90 min: There will be three added minutes. White Hart Lane has found its 
collective voice again. Spurs are heading to the top of the Group J table 
unless there’s some very late drama.

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Anderlecht (Dembele 87)

They’ve been up against it, but now look! Davies and Dembele one-two down the 
left. Davies crosses. It’s half cleared, but Son picks up possession on the 
edge of the area, and lays off to Dembele, who romping in from the left 
unleashes a pearler into the top left! That’s a rare old netburster! And it’ll 
burst Anderlecht’s hearts, because the visitors have been far the better side 
in this second half. But this, ladies and gentlemen, is association football!

86 min: But when you’ve got Harry Kane up front, anything can happen. He picks 
up possession just inside theAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> box, and despite being 
surrounded by yellow shirts, drops a shoulder, moves to the right, and gets a 
snapshot on target. Deschacht blocks for a corner, which is easily cleared.

though. The home heroes are being bossed.

80 min: Ezekiel scampers into space down the left. He should probably score as 
he enters the box ahead of Alderweireld, but he pauses and allows the defender 
to slide in and concede a corner. The set piece is a waste of everyone’s time.

78 min: Okaka very nearly tears past Davies down the right. The full back 
stays on his man’s shoulder. Okaka is close to finding Ezekiel, clear in the 
middle, but Davies bundles out for a corner, which ends in a dismal 
long-distance effort from Deschacht. Spurs are hanging on.

76 min: Anderlecht whip two fierce crosses into the Spurs box from the left. 
Both times, Alderweireld stands strong to head clear with Okaka waiting to 
batter a header into the goal from close range. Staunch defence, but Spurs are 
very much second best right now. Unless they can somehow shift the momentum, 
like they did in the first half, there’s only one winner of this.

75 min: Lamela has got space to scoot into down the left, but carelessly 
over-runs the ball. Tottenham’s play is a bit panicked right now.

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Anderlecht (Ezekiel 72)

Well, this had been coming. N’Sakala, deep on the left again, swings one into 
the Spurs box. The substitute Ezekiel steals a march on the Spurs back line, 
sticks a leg out, and guides the ball off the left-hand post and into the net.

71 min: Anderlecht are desperately searching for the leveller. N’Sakala, out 
on the left, loops a ball into the middle. Defour, to the left of the D, chests 
it down and sends a screaming volley towards the top left. Just a bit high and 
wide. But Spurs really need to watch out.

69 min: Acheampong skins Trippier on the left, and whips a low cross towards 
the near post. Alderweireld hacks out. Before the corner can be taken, Ezekiel 
comes on for Tielemans. Then the set piece, which is half cleared, only to be 
hoicked straight back down the middle and into the mixer. Mbodji sticks his leg 
out in a central position and guides the dropping ball to the right, where 
Okaka can’t find any power to his shot. So close to the equaliser.

65 min: Alli, his back to play, very nearly releases Son down the left and 
into the area with a John Barnes flick. Not quite. But very close, and very 
inventive. Then Lamela tries to curl one into the top right with the outside of 
his left boot. This is a hard-working Spurs side, but they pretty it up with 
some lovely flourishes too.

62 min: Anderlecht are not afraid to commit men forward. Deschacht, the 
defender on the left-hand edge of the Spurs area, wins a corner. Nothing comes 
of it. This is a wonderfully entertaining, open game.

61 min: Son rolls a pass into the Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> box from the left. It’s half 
cleared, but only 20 yards out on the left to Davies, who takes a touch and Le 
Tissiers a stunning dipping volley onto the crossbar. If only that had nestled 
into the top right, screeching over Proto, we’d have had a picture-book goal 
for the ages.

60 min: Son’s first touch sends Kane into space down the left. Kane finds 
Lamela, who shuttles the ball inside for Alli. The young midfielder batters a 
rising shot towards the top right. It’s deflected off Mbodji’s back for a 
corner, which is cleared with a crashing defensive header by Gillet.

55 min: Anderlecht are dominating possession. After a long period of passing 
in the middle, Defour, on the right, wallops a diagonal ball towards Acheampong 
on the left. For a second, Trippier having misjudged his high challenge, it 
looks like theAnderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> man 
will be scampering free down the wing. But the flag goes up for a marginal 
offside. Spurs want to watch themselves here.

53 min: Once again Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>
 have started the half strongly. Tielemans whips a pass wide right to Defour, 
who is in a bit of space in the Spurs area. Fortunately for the hosts, he 
decides to faff around and can’t deliver a shot or find a killer pass.

51 min: Good word by Acheampong down the left. His cross is deflected out of 
play to the right of goal, off Trippier’s head. A couple of corners come to 
nothing. But then Najar goes on a power dribble down the right. He nearly 
breaks through the Spurs back line thanks to a crisp one-two with Okaka, but 
Alderweireld steps in to put a stop to his fancy ideas.

49 min: This is enjoyable end-to-end fare. Alli skedaddles down the 
inside-left channel, but can’t find Lamela on his inside with the visitors 
stretched. Then Defour, striding down the inside right, whistles a low shot 
towards the bottom left. That’s going in, and Lloris does very well to stretch 
out an arm and parry away from danger.

Deschacht, of all people, on the right of the D. He attempts a curler into the

47 min: But Trippier’s not giving up, and makes another good run down the 
right. He finds Eriksen in the area. The Danish international wins a corner 
with a rococo dribble, but then takes it himself from the right, and it’s not 
much cop.

46 min: Alli sprays the ball wide right for the constantly rampaging Trippier. 
It’s not quite been the full-back’s day so far, though, and his needlessly 
rushed cross is blocked by Deschacht.

And we're off again!

Anderlecht get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. And before 
the action really gets going, here’s some more gilet  bodywarmer chat, courtesy 
of Tim Smith: “In my house, the item of clothing in question was referred to as 
hot water tank lagging, which pretty well sums up the garment, don’t you 
think?” Hey, form follows function. A bit like Spurs in that first half.

HALF TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Anderlecht

Alli, dribbling along the left, goes over lamely in the box, and makes a 
half-arsed claim for a penalty. Nope! Then Kane slips a ball down the left 
channel for Lamela, who can’t quite get there ahead of Proto, who rushes off 
his line. And that’s that for the opening 45.Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> were the better team until 
the goal, but Kane’s brilliant strike changed the momentum of the match as well 
as the scoreline itself. It should make for a fascinating second half. But as 
things stand, Spurs are heading to the top of Group J.

45 min: Kane sprays that ball wide right to Trippier again. This time he finds 
his man. Trippier feeds Eriksen, who drops a shoulder to cut inside N’Sakala 
and enters the area. But Deschacht forms a barrier. That was a pretty and crisp 
move.

And that’s that! Spurs were second best for the majority of the match, if 
we’re being honest, but on the other hand there’s no arguing with that 
long-distance winner from Mousa Dembele, worthy of deciding many a rumble. 
Spurs fought hard to deny a rampant Anderlecht for long periods of the second 
half, but held firm, and their reward for doing so is a win that takes them top 
of the group! There’s more than one way to win a football match, after all. 
Neutrals will feel some sympathy forAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>, and perhaps also for Jared 
Barnes (34 mins) who had a lovely joke cued up about the visitors, with Gillet 
in their team, not being ‘armless after all. Ah well.
 
90 min +2: Defour, playing quarterback, hits a long pass down the middle. But 
the Hail Mary doesn’t pay off, and Spurs clear with ease. Son goes off on a 
skitter to run down more of the clock.
 
90 min +1: Kane holds the ball up by Anderlecht’s left-hand corner flag. And 
earns a free kick. Marvellous clock management.
 
90 min: There will be three added minutes. White Hart Lane has found its 
collective voice again. Spurs are heading to the top of the Group J table 
unless there’s some very late drama.
 
89 min: Acheampong is replaced by Idrissa Sylla.

They’ve been up against it, but now look! Davies and Dembele one-two down the 
left. Davies crosses. It’s half cleared, but Son picks up possession on the 
edge of the area, and lays off to Dembele, who romping in from the left 
unleashes a pearler into the top left! That’s a rare old netburster! And it’ll 
burst Anderlecht’s hearts, because the visitors have been far the better side 
in this second half. But this, ladies and gentlemen, is association football!
 Mousa Dembele fires in the second goal. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters  
86 min: But when you’ve got Harry Kane up front, anything can happen. He picks 
up possession just inside theAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> box, and despite being 
surrounded by yellow shirts, drops a shoulder, moves to the right, and gets a 
snapshot on target. Deschacht blocks for a corner, which is easily cleared.
 
85 min: A rare Spurs attack, Onomah rolling a pass inside from the left, 
Dembele shooting weakly from 20 yards. Proto smothers the ball.
 
83 min: The corner isn’t up to much. White Hart Lane has gone very quiet, 
though. The home heroes are being bossed.
 
82 min: Ezekiel wins a monster header down the middle, and feeds Okaka, who 
returns the ball quickly. Ezekiel slides wide left for Acheampong, who wins yet 
another corner. Before it can be taken,Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> swap N’Sakala for Ibrahima 
Conte.
 
80 min: Ezekiel scampers into space down the left. He should probably score as 
he enters the box ahead of Alderweireld, but he pauses and allows the defender 
to slide in and concede a corner. The set piece is a waste of everyone’s time.
 
78 min: Okaka very nearly tears past Davies down the right. The full back 
stays on his man’s shoulder. Okaka is close to finding Ezekiel, clear in the 
middle, but Davies bundles out for a corner, which ends in a dismal 
long-distance effort from Deschacht. Spurs are hanging on.
 
77 min: The 18-year-old Joshua Onomah comes on for Alli.
 
76 min: Anderlecht whip two fierce crosses into the Spurs box from the left. 
Both times, Alderweireld stands strong to head clear with Okaka waiting to 
batter a header into the goal from close range. Staunch defence, but Spurs are 
very much second best right now. Unless they can somehow shift the momentum, 
like they did in the first half, there’s only one winner of this.
 
75 min: Lamela has got space to scoot into down the left, but carelessly 
over-runs the ball. Tottenham’s play is a bit panicked right now.
 
73 min: As a shocked but hardly surprised White Hart Lane processes that news, 
Mason is replaced by Dembele.

Well, this had been coming. N’Sakala, deep on the left again, swings one into 
the Spurs box. The substitute Ezekiel steals a march on the Spurs back line, 
sticks a leg out, and guides the ball off the left-hand post and into the net. 
No more thanAnderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> 
deserve.

Rose/Getty Images  
71 min: Anderlecht are desperately searching for the leveller. N’Sakala, out 
on the left, loops a ball into the middle. Defour, to the left of the D, chests 
it down and sends a screaming volley towards the top left. Just a bit high and 
wide. But Spurs really need to watch out.
 
69 min: Acheampong skins Trippier on the left, and whips a low cross towards 
the near post. Alderweireld hacks out. Before the corner can be taken, Ezekiel 
comes on for Tielemans. Then the set piece, which is half cleared, only to be 
hoicked straight back down the middle and into the mixer. Mbodji sticks his leg 
out in a central position and guides the dropping ball to the right, where 
Okaka can’t find any power to his shot. So close to the equaliser.

on goal. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters  
67 min: All a bit pinball at the moment. Both teams doing a lot of pressing, 
pressurising the pass, forcing errors. A gegenmess.
 
65 min: Alli, his back to play, very nearly releases Son down the left and 
into the area with a John Barnes flick. Not quite. But very close, and very 
inventive. Then Lamela tries to curl one into the top right with the outside of 
his left boot. This is a hard-working Spurs side, but they pretty it up with 
some lovely flourishes too.
 
62 min: Anderlecht are not afraid to commit men forward. Deschacht, the 
defender on the left-hand edge of the Spurs area, wins a corner. Nothing comes 
of it. This is a wonderfully entertaining, open game.
 
61 min: Son rolls a pass into the Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> box from the left. It’s half 
cleared, but only 20 yards out on the left to Davies, who takes a touch and Le 
Tissiers a stunning dipping volley onto the crossbar. If only that had nestled 
into the top right, screeching over Proto, we’d have had a picture-book goal 
for the ages.
 
60 min: Son’s first touch sends Kane into space down the left. Kane finds 
Lamela, who shuttles the ball inside for Alli. The young midfielder batters a 
rising shot towards the top right. It’s deflected off Mbodji’s back for a 
corner, which is cleared with a crashing defensive header by Gillet.
 
58 min: Nothing comes of the corner. Eriksen, who has been 
uncharacteristically quiet, is replaced by Son, who returns after six weeks off 
with an injured foot.
 
57 min: Alli slides a pass down the left for Kane, who isn’t far away from 
latching onto the ball. But Proto is out quickly to smother.Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> fizz up the other end, Defour 
whipping a gorgeous cross into the box from the right. Okaka would have had a 
clear header from six yards had Trippier not eyebrowed out for a corner in the 
nick of time.

55 min: Anderlecht are dominating possession. After a long period of passing 
in the middle, Defour, on the right, wallops a diagonal ball towards Acheampong 
on the left. For a second, Trippier having misjudged his high challenge, it 
looks like theAnderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> man 
will be scampering free down the wing. But the flag goes up for a marginal 
offside. Spurs want to watch themselves here.
 
53 min: Once again Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>
 have started the half strongly. Tielemans whips a pass wide right to Defour, 
who is in a bit of space in the Spurs area. Fortunately for the hosts, he 
decides to faff around and can’t deliver a shot or find a killer pass.
 
52 min: Kane sweeps down the left and rolls the ball inside for Lamela, who 
takes one step into the box and opts to fall over. He claims a penalty, but 
come along.
 
51 min: Good word by Acheampong down the left. His cross is deflected out of 
play to the right of goal, off Trippier’s head. A couple of corners come to 
nothing. But then Najar goes on a power dribble down the right. He nearly 
breaks through the Spurs back line thanks to a crisp one-two with Okaka, but 
Alderweireld steps in to put a stop to his fancy ideas.

49 min: This is enjoyable end-to-end fare. Alli skedaddles down the 
inside-left channel, but can’t find Lamela on his inside with the visitors 
stretched. Then Defour, striding down the inside right, whistles a low shot 
towards the bottom left. That’s going in, and Lloris does very well to stretch 
out an arm and parry away from danger.
 
48 min: Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> make 
their first attack of the half, and the ball drops to the centre back 
Deschacht, of all people, on the right of the D. He attempts a curler into the 
top left. Nope!
 
47 min: But Trippier’s not giving up, and makes another good run down the 
right. He finds Eriksen in the area. The Danish international wins a corner 
with a rococo dribble, but then takes it himself from the right, and it’s not 
much cop.
 
46 min: Alli sprays the ball wide right for the constantly rampaging Trippier. 
It’s not quite been the full-back’s day so far, though, and his needlessly 
rushed cross is blocked by Deschacht.
 
Anderlecht get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. And before 
the action really gets going, here’s some more gilet  bodywarmer chat, courtesy 
of Tim Smith: “In my house, the item of clothing in question was referred to as 
hot water tank lagging, which pretty well sums up the garment, don’t you 
think?” Hey, form follows function. A bit like Spurs in that first half.
 
Half-time advertisement:
 
Alli, dribbling along the left, goes over lamely in the box, and makes a 
half-arsed claim for a penalty. Nope! Then Kane slips a ball down the left 
channel for Lamela, who can’t quite get there ahead of Proto, who rushes off 
his line. And that’s that for the opening 45.Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> were the better team until 
the goal, but Kane’s brilliant strike changed the momentum of the match as well 
as the scoreline itself. It should make for a fascinating second half. But as 
things stand, Spurs are heading to the top of Group J.
 
45 min: Kane sprays that ball wide right to Trippier again. This time he finds 
his man. Trippier feeds Eriksen, who drops a shoulder to cut inside N’Sakala 
and enters the area. But Deschacht forms a barrier. That was a pretty and crisp 
move.
 
44 min: Neither side is putting on a passing masterclass right now.
