What's the story?


The latest game from Quantic Dream isn't a sequel to Heavy Rain but has plenty 
of stylistic similarities. Director David Cage goes for the kind of drama you 
find in blockbuster films that results in these minimally interactive 
experiences that some are reluctant to even call games.

Gameplay

Ellen Page lends her voice and motion-captured likeness to protagonist Jodie 
Holmes, who was born tied to an invisible "entity". You explore her memories 
out of chronological order, switching between Holmes and the entity – Aiden – 
who can float through walls, blast open doors, and possess other characters 
when the plot allows it.

Highs and lows

The heavily supernatural plot is more determined than that of Heavy Rain, with 
the significant choices clustered at the end. That and the use of quick-time 
events to trigger cutscenes may bother some players, especially if they don't 
feel the story makes up for it. However, those scenes are visually stunning, 
well-acted by Page, and in some cases very moving.

The verdict

A big budget has translated to incredible technical effects, some expensive 
and talented actors, and a plot that is overly focused on spectacle. It might 
not be the deep experience some hoped, but it's easy to enjoy while hoping that 
other developers will apply their own ambitions to the format and create 
something better.
