Abdel Fatah Younis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-younis> made 
his career as one of Muammar Gaddafi's closest confidants, before unexpectedly 
switching sides to join Libya's rebels in February this year.

The 67-year-old was among the military officers who joined Gaddafi in 
overthrowing Libya's king, Idris, in a coup in 1969.

He then became one of Gaddafi's closest advisers, training his special forces 
and being appointed interior minister, responsible for the Gaddafi's internal 
security.

When rebellion came to the streets of Benghazi in February, Younis, a native 
of the city, was Gaddafi's natural choice as the man to crush the uprising.

Instead, on arrival in the city he announced he was joining the rebels, and 
persuaded Benghazi's Interior Ministry brigade to switch sides with him.

By March, he was commanding the rebel army but clashed with a rival, Khalifa 
Hefter, a former Libyan army general who returned to join the uprising after 20 
years living in exile in the United States.

Hefter was given the top job in late March, only for Younis to be declared the 
chief of staff by the National Transitional Council a month later.

But many rebels were unhappy that a key member of the Gaddafi regime should 
have been appointed commander of opposition forces.
