For patrons missing their darlings, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, this final 
week of the tennis season in London has opened a window on the future and the 
view through the winter mist is somewhere between encouraging and uncertain.

The seats at the O2 Arena in Greenwich are still amply occupied but there is 
no escaping the fact the veteran Swiss and his faltering Spanish rival would 
have lent theATP World Tour Finals

In their absence, through injury and maybe a little weariness, Dominic Thiem 
has thrust himself into the conversation with mixed conviction. The 23-year-old 
Austrian with the mature gamelost to Novak Djokovic on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/13/novak-djokovic-dominic-thiem-atp-world-tour-finals>
 when nerves gripped his racket after he had taken the first set; and he 
survived a mid-match collapse on Tuesday to beat the unpredictable Gaël 
Monfils, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4.

The first set flew by in 26 minutes and for much of the time Monfils appeared 
to be caught in the same debilitating torpor that had enveloped him in his 
first match, when he went meekly into the night in two sets against Milos 
Raonic.

There were the usual flickerings of genius – a delightful drop shot here, a 
chip or a lob there, shots played with gusto from deep and with artfulness at 
the net, which he visited 10 times – but no bankable dividend in a frame in 
which he hit 11 unforced errors and two double faults.

Thiem now had one in the bank again, this time against a more fragile, 
although equally dangerous, opponent than Djokovic. He and the rest of the Tour 
witnessedthe US Open semi-final

 between the then world No1 and the Frenchman in September and were as puzzled 
as everyone present at his early passivity before marvelling at his comeback.

Little did we realise at the time Djokovic was almost as vulnerable that day 
as was Monfils and he would struggle on through the autumn before landing up 
here in search of a fifth consecutive title, but without his No1 ranking. The 
old order has not entirely collapsed.

Andy Murray beats Marin Cilic at ATP World Tour Finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/15/andy-murray-beats-marin-cilic-atp-world-tour-finals-video-highlights>
Monfils, meanwhile, is trying to become the first debutant to win the title 
since Àlex Corretja, subsequentlyAndy Murray’s coach for a while 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/29/andy-murray-tennis-coach-split>, 
in 1998.

Only four others have triumphed on their introduction to the Tour’s finale: 
Stan Smith in the first year (of course), 1970, Ilie Nastase (1971), Guillermo 
Villas (1974) and John McEnroe (1978). Exalted company indeed.

Monfils, the game’s grand enigma, did his best to confound perceptions when he 
raced to 4-0 in the second set, banging down a couple of aces, while still 
reaching for the unreachable. Thiem eked out four break points in the fifth 
game, and began his fightback with a scorching cross-court forehand from near 
the baseline.

But he blew his good work – as he did against Djokovic – with some intemperate 
racket work, and Monfils had the unexpected luxury of a five-game cushion as he 
served out to love with his fifth ace to level at a set apiece. What had 
earlier looked like an embarrassing walkover had morphed into a contest.

But could Monfils, whose form and fitness has dipped after a wonderful early 
summer, hold on against his younger but tired opponent, who was appearing in 
his 110th match of the season, 10 of those in the gentler surroundings of the 
doubles court?

Ultimately, no. Monfils dug himself out of three holes in some tight exchanges 
but, after an hour and a half, Thiem had his first match point on the Monfils 
serve and was glad to see his final shot, a go-for-it forehand into the deuce 
corner, drift long.

Earlier, Jamie Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamie-murray> and 
Bruno Soares played like champions to beat the brothers who have worn that 
mantle for so long, Mike and Bob Bryan, 6-3, 6-4 in a tick over an hour.

A lot of matches have been quickfire spectacles this week and that is usually 
the case anyway in doubles. The quartet did not disappoint, as the ball flew 
between them in some dazzling exchanges – but the Scotland/Brazil combination 
kept their discipline more convincingly and picked their moments with excellent 
judgment.

Murray said later, “We certainly played a great match, from start to finish. 
It was probably one of our best matches of the year. We served really well 
throughout, cleaned up well on our serves. We had a good game plan to play 
against them. We executed it really well. We both returned the ball smartly, 
put it in some difficult spots for them, then were really active around the 
net. We’re both super pumped about the win.”

They have an excellent chance of going all the way this week, having got on 
the board in their first match against Treat Huey (Dominic Inglot’s old 
partner) and Max Myrni.

What an achievement it would be for the Murray family if Judy’s sons could 
celebrate a twin triumph here on Sunday.
