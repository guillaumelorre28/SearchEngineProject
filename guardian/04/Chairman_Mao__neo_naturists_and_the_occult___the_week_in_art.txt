Exhibition of the week

Colour and Vision
This exploration of visual experience across the natural world has everything 
from fossils of the first creatures to develop eyes in the ancient seas to an 
installation about the Newtonian spectrum. Science and art come together in 
what should be a mind-expanding show.

London, 15 July-6 November.

Now showing

Liverpool Biennial 
Merseyside comes alive with art, from an installation about the Large Hadron 
Collider to artist’s films at the old ABC Cinema and buses decorated by local 
schoolchildren. Strawberry art dreams forever.
• Bluecoat, Liverpool <http://www.biennial.com> and other venues citywide, 9 
July-16 October.

Facing the World
This survey of self-portraiture ranges from Rembrandt to Tracey Emin, sublime 
introspection to the art of celebrity.

 An Allegory with Venus and Cupid by Agnolo Bronzino (circa 1545) Photograph: 
Alamy Stock Photo 
This is the masterpiece of this Florentine mannerist – just see how mannered 
it is! – and easily the most decadent painting in the National Gallery. It’s 
very much Take A Walk on Ye Wild Side as Venus is dextrously made love to by 
her adolescent son Cupid.
