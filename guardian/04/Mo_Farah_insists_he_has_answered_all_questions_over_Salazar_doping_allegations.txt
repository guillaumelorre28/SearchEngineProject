 in the lead-up to the London 2012 Olympics.

When asked by ITV’s Good Morning Britain if he had “put all that to one side” 
regarding the drug allegations against his coach, Farah said: “For sure, yes. 
It’s not a nice thing but at the same time, I answered everything that I can 
and it’s not in my control, it’s nothing to do [with me].

“But at the same time I’ve answered everything. At the minute I just want to 
carry on running, enjoy what I do and – do you know what drives me everyday? 
Spending time with these kids, giving something back to the community, to the 
kids and taking part in competitions.”

Farah will run the 3,000m at the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games on Friday as 
part of his preparations for the world championships in Beijing next month. 
“I’m very excited to be able to go back in that stadium and compete again, in 
front of my home crowd,” he said.
