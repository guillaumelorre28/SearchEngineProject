Taran Matharu’s first book book in the Summoner series, The Novice, was the 
best book I’ve ever read. Until I read the second one in the series, The 
Inquisition, which is, unbelievably, even better!

The story is set in in an unspecified time period/parallel universe which 
feels like it’s back in time, a little bit like a Lord of the Rings-style world 
with elves, orcs and dwarves. The basic story begins with an orphaned teenage 
boy called Fletcher. He makes friends with a soldier who gives him a book – 
inside, the book holds a summoning scroll made of skin. The second he’s done 
reading it out loud, a small salamander demon appears and becomes his best 
friend. The minds of the demon and Fletcher are bound together, a bit like the 
daemons in Philip Pullman’s The Northern Lights.

I’ve already mentioned two books the Summoner series is a bit like: Lord of 
the Rings and Northern Lights. It also reminds me a bit of Christopher Paolini 
Eragon. BUT I need to tell you that these books by Taran Matharu are not 
mash-ups. The Summoner series is by no means an imitation of any other book. 
Everything in them (and there’s a bit of Pokemon-style stuff in there too) 
moves everything on into something completely new and completely and utterly 
brilliant.

The books are so thrilling, so political, they make you think deeply about 
your own world as well as transporting you to their world and keeping you on 
the edge of your seat. They are brilliant on matters of race and class.

One of my favourite characters in the books was Othello, the dwarf. He was 
such a well-developed character, you really got to know him well – and 
understand his political situation. The dwarves were discriminated against and 
didn’t have the same rights as humans. I felt the descriptions of the weapons 
Othello used were particularly very, very well done. I loved all the 
descriptions in the series actually, especially the demons.

In my head while I was reading The Summoner series I could see every single 
scene perfectly. It was the weirdest experience – and I’ve only ever had 
something close to this feeling when I’m reading fantasy when I read the Hobbit 
(and SF Said’s Varjak Paw when I was younger). It just captivated my 
imagination, it played like a film in my mind. Weirdly I won’t say I’m someone 
who really loves reading in general, even though I love stories, so I crave 
books that make me feel I’m not reading, to forget the effort of reading. At 
many points I’d forget I was even reading these books while I was actually 
reading. It’s really hard to explain but the book was almost like a DVD when I 
would open the book and The Summoner ‘film’ would play in my mind with no 
effort at all.

I read books one and two, straight after each other, captivated and thrilled. 
I admit to crying when I finished book two and I’m now devastated that I have to
wait a whole year for book 3

. I’m not even sure if I can do it. Taran Matharu is one of the best writers 
writing today. If you love fantasy please read these books!
