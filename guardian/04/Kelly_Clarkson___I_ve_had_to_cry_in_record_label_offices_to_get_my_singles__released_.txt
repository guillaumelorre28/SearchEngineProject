Hi, Kelly! The last time I interviewed you 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jun/13/artsfeatures> was in 2003, a 
year after you won the first series of American Idol. I was expecting a 
media-trained Idolbot, but you were really opinionated. (1)

They tried to get me to do a media-training class after Idol, but I didn’t 
want to, and they looked at my manager and said: “Good luck.” I like talking so 
I’m usually fine with doing interviews, but the part of my job I abhor is photo 
shoots. You spend all day setting up and waiting to take the picture, and it’s 
so boring.

Did you think you’d still be here now, 25 million albums and three Grammys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/grammys> later?

I don’t know why I’ve lasted – you focus on the music, and sometimes the stars 
align and sometimes they don’t. I think it helped that I knew what I wanted to 
do from the start.

Which was…?

I wanted to do pop, because that means “popular”, and anything that was 
soulful. But it was hard to get that across at first. WithMiss Independent 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS1ZW0FdoIU> (2), I had to cry in my label’s 
office to get it out [as a single]. They wanted me to sing like the Aretha 
songs I’d done on the show, and I was, like: “I’m 20 years old, I can do big 
ballads, but I also love guitars.” They didn’t want to do a lot of production 
with me. It was the same thing that would happen with Adele – she does ballads 
with a piano. I said: “That’s beautiful, but can I do other stuff?”

How do you deal with the nastiness of a lot of celebrity coverage, like the 
Daily Mail’s recent story about your “bizarre” dress sense?

I have journalist friends, and it’s sad to see people who have the talent to 
do more writing those kinds of stories. But it’s supply and demand, I guess – 
those websites wouldn’t exist if people weren’t reading them. I have a very 
thick skin, and I don’t usually let things like that get to me, but I’m human, 
and if people are mean on Twitter it hurts. But if [a journalist] is sitting 
behind a computer somewhere, writing nasty things, that doesn’t bother me. 
People always get mad at the paparazzi, but you have to get mad at the people 
funding it.

You did some witty tweets on Grammy night, like “I love this @edsheeran song! 
It’s weird he wrote it about me but hey I get it. #mygravitationalpull” 
<https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/564606923488890881> So which song 
was that?

Oh. Uh … something like “Take me into your arms…”

I love this @edsheeran <https://twitter.com/edsheeran> song! It's weird he 
wrote it about me but hey I get it.#mygravitationalpull

Thinking Out Loud?

I think so. He’s amazing. So talented - and he’s young! Usually I’m there, but 
I wasn’t eligible this year, so I was watching it on TV and it was a different 
perspective. I thought it was really tasteful. When you’re at the Grammys, you 
don’t really experience it, and you definitely can’t tweet from your seat.

There was a slightly surreal story a couple of years ago about you buying Jane 
Austen’s ring at auction, then being refused permission to take it out of the 
country.

Her ring came up for sale at a Sotheby’s auction, and I thought: “I’ll 
probably spend too much money” [she paid £152,450], but my family doesn’t have 
any heirlooms to pass on, so I thought it would be lovely to have it. So I won 
it, and we got the export licence – and then [culture minister Ed Vaizey] 
suddenlyclaimed it as a national treasure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/01/kelly-clarkson-jane-austen-ring>.

You never got to wear it? 

I kept it in a safety deposit box at Christie’s and wore it while I was in 
London. It was turquoise, but it was fragile – the band on it was weakening. My 
boyfriend was trying with my lawyer in parliament to let us keep it, because he 
was going to propose to me with it.In the end, we couldn’t 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/23/kelly-clarkson-gives-up-jane-austen-ring>
, so instead, he made a replica for me at Christmas.(3)

So how did a Texas girl become such a big Austen fan? Is she taught in 
American schools?

We didn’t learn her at school, but one of my teachers was reading Jane Eyre, 
and I got interested [in British female authors of the period]. I readPersuasion
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/23/janeausten.classics> and it 
painted a very realistic picture of life – I love how she wrote her female 
characters, because they were so independent.

 Heartbeat Song from Kelly Clarkson’s new album Piece by Piece. 
What do you think of the trend for big singers collaborating with other big 
singers? John Legend is on your new album,Piece By Piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/26/kelly-clarkson-piece-by-piece-review>
, and you’ve done other collaborations.

I haven’t done that many … I did one with [US country star] Jason Aldean, but 
that was for his album, and I did a single with Vince Gill, but he’s country, 
too.(4) I hadn’t done a pop one till John Legend 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmHLN1OgtI>. I don’t want it to be forced: I 
don’t like it when they bring together a celebrity and a celebrity, regardless 
of how they sound. Just because people are lead singers doesn’t mean they can 
harmonise. Harmony is my favourite thing – I’m jealous of my backing singers, 
because they have more fun.

You’ve said it was hard to get a break when you started because your voice 
made record labels assume you were black, and they were disappointed when you 
turned out not to be.

I didn’t have money for a photo shoot, so I sent my demo out – a soulful demo 
- without a picture. And a couple of times, [label staff] said to me, “Oh, 
you’re not black” – they wanted a black-backing-singer look. I did get some 
calls returned:Gerry Goffin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/gerry-goffin-us-songwriter-lyricist-dead>
(5) was the first person to be excited by me. They invited me to his home and I 
saw his gold records and thought, “this is amazing”. So I had some interest 
from people who’d worked with major artists, but I still wasn’t really getting 
anywhere. I was living with a girl I barely knew on Croft Avenue [in Los 
Angeles], and the day we moved in we went out to dinner. We came back from 
dinner and the place was on fire.

Actually on fire?

Actually on fire. I lost everything except one box. I had to sleep in my car. 
And then I heard about a random audition for a talent show…

And here you are, 13 years later. The Sunday Mirror once interviewed you and 
claimed you said “No one on the planet should be as famous as me”, but you’ve
said that was a misquote 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/idol-worship/kelly-clarkson-accuses-paper-misquoting-394362>
.

That was a good one! They took what I said out of context – I said I don’t 
think people should be so famous that they can’t have a normal life. The girl 
asked if I thought I was too famous, so I said being famous is like a big piece 
of dynamite. And it was misquoted, and I sounded like such a tool.

“Tool” is very British. Do they say that in Texas?

Tool? Sure we do.

themselves.

multi-carat wedding and engagement rings.
