The winner
Sunny skies once again deterred audiences from congregating in darkened 
cinemas, but there was nevertheless a star performer among the new releases. 
Dear John, a romantic drama adapted from a novel by The Notebook author 
Nicholas Sparks, benefited from a clear audience to target with marketing and 
publicity. Its opening, a shade under £2m, was enough to grab the top spot, 
although it's worth remembering that £722,000 of that tally came from previews 
on Wednesday and Thursday. Without those extra takings, Dear John would have 
landed third, behind Clash of the Titans and How to Train Your Dragon.

The result enhances Channing Tatum's status as a box-office star. His 
bare-knuckle boxing drama Fighting opened with £991,000 last May, and expensive 
action blockbuster GI Joe disappointed with a £1.71m debut last August. 
Commentators were taken by surprise when Dear John opened in the US in February 
with over $30m (£19.4m), and some doubted the success would be repeated in 
international markets, where Tatum is less well known.

Dear John's success is also good news for Sparks. Despite its eventual 
ascension to the chick-flick pantheon, The Notebook was an underperformer at UK 
cinemas when released in June 2004, grossing just £1.18m over the entirety of 
its theatrical run. The film went on to succeed on DVD, thanks to strong 
word-of-mouth endorsement.

The chasing pack
Political conspiracy thriller The Ghost presented a distribution challenge to 
local distributor Optimum, since the adaptation of Robert Harris's novel 
privileges talk over action; director Roman Polanski is in the news for the 
wrong reasons; and stars Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan are no guarantors of 
box office. Given the sunny weather, Optimum will be more than happy with an 
opening of £854,000. An apt comparison might be corporate thriller Michael 
Clayton, which debuted in September 2007 with £601,000 from a similar number of 
screens. Poalnski's last film Oliver Twist began its run in October 2005 with 
£692,00.

Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's British dramedy Cemetery Junction landed 
one place behind, with £641,000. However, strip out that film's Wednesday and 
Thursday previews, and its total falls to a lacklustre £432,000 from 330 
screens. Distributor Sony could not have asked for a bigger publicity effort by 
the film-making duo, although the pair's insistence that their film is a drama 
rather than a comedy might have given audiences pause. Or maybe, after 
Gervais's wearying The Invention of Lying, fans are approaching with caution.

The misfire
With a release two and a half years after shooting began, a title change from 
the initial Repossession Mambo, and a limp US debut of just over $6m, 
commercial hopes were not high for the UK release of Repo Men. Even so, its 
opening of £183,000 is probably at the lower end of those expectations. Star 
Jude Law has box-office value when he's an additional element in an already 
attractive package, such as in The Holiday or Sherlock Holmes, but has 
struggled recently in lead roles. Sleuth, Breaking and Entering and All the 
King's Men all underperformed. Organ repossession flick Repo Men might have 
appealed to a genre audience with more relevant casting in place of Law and 
co-star Forest Whitaker: Jason Statham, say, Gerard Butler or even Clive Owen.

The alternatives
Two films continue to do strong business in limited play. Expanding from 29 to 
56 screens, British comedy The Infidel saw its box office jump by a healthy 
30%. Pushing beyond its arthouse comfort zone, Italian romantic melodrama I Am 
Love saw its screen count rise from 35 to 47 screens, while box office declined 
by 34%. Its 10-day total is a decent £404,000. The dominance of these two 
titles, and a respectable showing of £46,000 for The Girl With the Dragon 
Tattoo in its sixth week, provided a tough environment for a bafflingly long 
list of new releases in the specialist sector (see "Other Openers", below). 
Review space in national newspapers was spread very thin, and any film failing 
to attract four-star endorsements was liable to struggle.

The holdovers
For films targeting the Easter school holidays market, it's not so much about 
how the weekend held up, but how they performed over the whole period. With 
£16.27m in grosses so far, Clash of the Titans has already matched the total of 
mid-level blockbusters from last summer (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, for example) 
and has a bit more gas in the tank. How to Train Your Dragon will be encouraged 
by a slim 8% weekend-on-weekend decline, but with £13.09m so far, it still has 
a long way to go to match DreamWorks' 2009 Easter hit, Monsters Vs Aliens – 
that one maxed out around £21.1m. Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang has grossed a 
decent £14.57m, and it is well placed to match the £16.5m total of the first 
film from 2005.

The future
Despite sunny skies depressing box office, overall the market was a slim 3% 
down on the corresponding weekend from 2009, which suffered from relatively 
low-achieving new releases (I Love You Man, Crank 2). This weekend's big hitter 
is Steve Carell/Tina Fey comedy Date Night, which opened in the US with $25.2m, 
and should plug the gap here for an adult-skewing comedy. The distributor of 
It's a Wonderful Afterlife believes Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder 
Chadha's audience will prove loyal for her latest Anglo-Asian comedy. And smart 
satire The Joneses, Roman-era actioner Centurion, swords-and-sandals epic Agora 
and US indie flick Extract all open in relatively wide release. There are sure 
to be casualties.
