The growing consensus that "there must be cuts" is unfortunate, because it has 
cut off any real discussion about exactly how big, and how long-term, the 
crisis in public finances is.

Before the crisis hit, it was fairly clear that there was already a relatively 
small hole in the public finances – a "structural deficit", in the jargon – as 
the government was getting less in from taxes than it was spending. The public 
deficit was creeping up and was passing Gordon Brown's 40% of GDP ceiling.

At 40%, however, public sector debt was, historically, at fairly low levels – 
it has been much higher – and across the developed world this was at the lower 
end. Even at 60%, it would not be exceptional. It is now set to rise to 
80%-plus.

This sudden jump has been caused mainly by the collapse of tax income, not 
extra public spending. Taxes will come back, but as yet it is not clear how 
much, because of the shrinkage in the financial sector. So we don't know how 
big the ongoing structural deficit will be.

Some cuts probably are needed, as well as some tax rises, but consuming our 
public capital to get us out of a mainly short-term public finance crisis would 
be an absurd over-reaction. And ironic, given that, in the current crisis, a 
remarkable feature of some private sector reaction has been to try to preserve 
capacity, rather than the "slash and burn" practices in previous recessions.

Capitalists have learned that recessions come and go, and policies should be 
more long-term. It would be weird if just as they start to learn this, we 
started dismantling the public domain because of a short-term crisis.
