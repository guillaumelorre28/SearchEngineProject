Surrey have signed the Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-symonds> as their second overseas 
player for the 2010 Friends Provident t20. The 34-year-old, who boasts a 
Twenty20 strike rate of 156.79 and batting average of 37.43, will join the 
Lions for the entire Twenty20 campaign.

Speaking from India, where he is representing the Deccan Chargers in the 
Indian Premier League, Symonds said: "I have always enjoyed playing in England 
and I am really looking forward to playing with theSurrey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/surrey> Lions.

"I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to play this exciting form of 
tournament cricket in so many different regions and I am sure the English 
crowds will make this competition one of the best."

Surrey are delighted to have secured the services of a player whose 2004 
century for Kent off just 34 balls remains the quickest hundred ever scored in 
domestic cricket.

The professional cricket manager, Chris Adams, said: "Signing a player with 
the unique abilities of Andrew Symonds will add a huge 'X factor' to our squad 
in the Friends Provident t20.

"I have watched him take apart some of the best bowlers in the world and am 
hugely excited to see him exhibit his skills in front of packed houses around 
the country."

Surrey Cricket's managing director, Gus Mackay, added: "Securing a 
high-profile signing as our second overseas player for the Friends Provident 
t20 was a big priority for us. I hope that bringing in a big-hitting, 
headline-grabbing star such as Andrew Symonds will inject real momentum into 
our performances and see us challenging for honours in August."
