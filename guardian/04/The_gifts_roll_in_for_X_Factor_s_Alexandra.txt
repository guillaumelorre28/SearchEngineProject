It seems Gavin and Stacey star James Corden has fallen big time for The X 
Factor winnerAlexandra Burke <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke>
 after presenting her with a Â£4,000 Cartier watch. The singer's mum Melissa 
said that Corden was "absolutely besotted" with the 20-year-old, although a 
source told the Sun he shouldn't get his hopes up. "I can't see her falling for 
his charms. He's not really her type." He has one fan though in Melissa. "I 
wish he'd give me a Cartier watch too," she said.
