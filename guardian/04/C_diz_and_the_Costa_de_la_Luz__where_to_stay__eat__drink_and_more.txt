The old walled towns are densely packed with medieval churches, Arabic forts, 
watchtowers, palaces, bodegas, tobacconists, scooters, bars full of 
bullfighting paraphernalia, kids on pink bicycles, and people eating fish at 
rickety tables that block the traffic.

The spaces in between the coastal towns of Cádiz province – craggy mountains, 
pine forests, fields and endless beaches – are empty and wild. Over it are big 
skies which, given the guaranteed 300 days of sun a year, are almost always 
blue and bright, hence the name given to this stretch of the Atlantic coast, 
Costa de la Luz, or coast of light.

The province of Cádiz feels more foreign, exotic and isolated than 
neighbouring Málaga. Popular with visitors 3,000 years ago, it’s currently 
going through an “undiscovered” phase. And, in the south especially, there’s 
more evidence of centuries of Arab rule: there’s fierce heat (down to a 
pleasant 20C average in October), dust, wrenching flamencocoplas (songs) 
playing in shops, bars and taxis, and you can see Africa from the beaches. It’s 
also more laid-back, thanks in part to sherry. The coastal towns of Sanlúcar de 
Barrameda, El Puerto de Santa Maria, Cádiz and nearby Jérez, are important 
points on the official sherry triangle, and awash with it.

There’s a lovely, logical route along the coast, heading south from Sanlúcar 
de Barrameda (erstwhile home of Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan, 
and a gateway to the new world in the early 16th century) through the city of 
Cádiz, to the deservedly touristy Vejer de la Frontera, and the unspoiled 
beaches of Zahora, Zahara, Bolonia and Valdevaqueros, before ending up in 
Tarifa. Straight through, it would take less than three hours, but to do it 
justice, allow a week … or a month.

What to do

Cádiz city
The best way to appreciate Cádiz – as well as Tarifa, Sanlúcar and, to a 
lesser extent, Jérez – is by wandering aimlessly. This is for two reasons. 
First, the city’s history of being occupied by Romans and Moors, enriched by 
trade with the new world, sacked by the British, fortified, and matured in the 
damp sea air means every one of its narrow cobbled streets spans centuries of 
history and has eyefuls of sights. Second, it’s impossible not to get lost 
(although, because it’s a small city, and bordered on three sides by beautiful 
beaches, not for long). Look out for the cathedral with its golden dome; the 
18th-century watchtower, Torre Tavira; the Mercado Central; and the Freiduría 
Las Flores, the best of the city’s many fried frish joints.

If you ignore the three beach bars close by the fish salting vats, little 
appears to have changed in Baelo Claudia since its heyday during the reign of 
Claudius. The villas, forum, shops, basilica and baths aren’t what they were in 
2AD – when an earthquake accelerated the decline in its fortunes – but it’s 
easy to imagine the citizens looking out to sea while waiting for the action to 
kick off in the amphitheatre. Various feet, heads, urns and reclining gods are 
displayed in the modern museum, an architectural gem. Bolonia beach is one of 
Spain’s best – long, unspoiled and backed by pine forest. (Turn right for the 
dunes, left for the nudist cove.)

Museo de la Manzanilla and Bodegas Barbadillo, Sanlúcar
This museum would be a good way to glean information pertinent to buying 
sherries of all kinds – olorosos, manzanillas and palo finos – but for the 
tasting session at the end which will wipe your memory clear. However, the 
chance to pad through the shadowy aisles of damp barrels, and admire the 
ecclesiastical architecture shouldn’t be missed. There are nine bodegas here, 
but Barbadillo, which swallowed up convents and houses, Pacman-like, in the 
19th century, is the biggest. Invest €6 in a bottle of Solear as you exit 
through the gift shop.
• Calle Sevilla 6, barbadillo.com <http://barbadillo.com>, tours 11am 
(English), noon and 1pm (Spanish), €6pp

Windsurfing, kite surfing, and surfing, Tarifa
The heady combination of strong winds, warm winters and extensive sandy 
beaches have established Tarifa as a top destination for year-round wet fun. 
There are dozens of schools offering every possible permutation of tuition and 
course, from a three-hour try-out upwards (from beginner to winner, as they 
say), as well as shops selling and renting equipment. You’ll see signs to 
schools as you pass Punta Paloma on the N340 to Tarifa, and nothing but as you 
enter Tarifa itself.

Classic site
The golden-domed Cádiz cathedral is best seen close to sunset from the sea 
wall along Campo del Sur – followed (if you can there in time) by a sundowner 
at nearby Playa de la Caleta.

Hidden gem
For cowbells, paella pans, olive oil, boots, cockerels or just an insight into 
shopping, rural Cádiz style, visit Ignacio Castro’s farm supply shop. It’s 
below Vejer at the Medina road junction.

Don’t miss
The chance to hear flamenco in a local peña (live music venue), there are 
plenty to choose from, go where the locals head ... just don’t clap along or 
ask for a gin and tonic.

 El Jardín del Califa. 
Casa Balbino, Sanlúcar 
The heavenly combination of local seafood and local wine is ubiquitous in 
Cádiz, but nowhere is it as good as at family-run Balbino. Now 75 years old, 
the restaurant attracts celebrities, politicians and well-heeled locals, though 
it’s far from fancy. You have to squeeze in, claw your way along the seafood 
display, order by weight at the bar, balance your teetering stack, and eat 
standing up under a bull’s head and framed matador snaps. Thankfully, the staff 
are funny and fast, and the food –mojama (sundried tuna), squid, stuffed spider 
crabs, baby sole, langoustines – is delicious. Meat is available, but it’s fish 
and seafood tapas, hot and cold, that this place is famed for, andtortillitas 
de camarones (shrimp fritters) above all. So good, and so cheap. 
• Plaza de Cabildo 14, casabalbino.com

El Lola, Tarifa
You’re spoilt for choice tapas-wise in old Tarifa but for a relaxed cafe 
atmosphere matched with top-class food, family-run El Lola is hard to beat. Try 
the garlicky potatoes with fresh mackerel, and then the langoustines, avocado 
and wasabi, with thedegustación de atún rojo (red tuna tasting plate) for 
starters. There’s a flamenco theme going on here – tables have polka-dot covers 
and the bearded waiter sports a frilly apron. El Lola is the last in a lane 
that is full of bars, so you could start at the originals –Los Melli 
<http://losmellitarifa.jimdo.com/> and El Paisillo 
<https://www.facebook.com/barelpasillotarifa> – and work your way down.

El Jardín del Califa, Vejer 
Africa, just across the Strait of Gibraltar, is resolutely ignored as 
inspiration by most local chefs. But El Jardín del Califa is the exception, 
with a predominance of North African dishes, served under palm trees in a 
walled courtyard lit by flaming torches. It offers an all-encompassing dining 
experience, from the exotic setting, right through the mezes,pastelas (meat 
pastries) and tagines, to the Sultan’s cheesecake. It’s deservedly popular 
(Moorish and moreish), so book well in advance.

Restaurante Joselito Huerta, Sanlúcar 
José opened a bar here on the sandy shores of the Guadalquivir estuary 55 
years ago, serving sherry to fishermen at the end of a long morning. 
Inevitably, it wasn’t long before he hit on the bright idea of cooking their 
catch, too. The menu is basically a list of things caught in the sea, fried and 
served with a slice of lemon. The clientele is local and loyal. Weather 
permitting, tables and umbrellas are set up at the water’s edge, offering a 
view of boats, and the dunes and bird haven that is Doñana national park. 
Confused by choice? Go for the selection of fried fish, thesurtido, in small, 
medium, or large.

Where to drink
 Drink on the beach at Sajorami beach bar. 
Bar Barbiana, Sanlúcar 
It has the look of a pricey deli – backlit shelves of wine, artfully arranged 
langoustines – but the football is always on the television, the mood’s relaxed 
and the drinks are cheap. Like just about every bar in Cádiz, it does food, and 
it is excellent – try thepapas aliñas (potatoes , olive oil, sherry vinegar, 
parsley and chives). Outdoor tables provide front-row viewing for the evening
paseo in cheery Plaza del Cabildo.
• Calle Isaac Peral 1

Taberna la Manzanilla, Cádiz

At first glance it looks like a farmacia … except that all the medicine in the 
dark old cabinets is manzanilla sherry. The walls are lined with bottles of all 
sizes and ages, many of the ornate faded labels signed by matadors, flamenco 
stars and other local celebs. They are not for drinking, so don’t ask. What you 
want is in the salty, tangy manzanilla in the barrels. The regulars may fall 
silent as you enter and the system and the choice appear baffling, b ut just 
ask for a vino and slide over a couple of euros. Whatever happens next will be 
good.

Sajorami Beach, Zahora
Andalucía’s iconic beach bars, the chiringuitos, batten down the hatches 
mid-September, but this one – part of a laid-back hotel – stays open through 
October. Tables and benches are set in the sand on a bluff above either glassy 
lagoons or frothy Atlantic rollers, depending on the tide. The Battle of 
Trafalgar took place just off here in October 1805, which is something to think 
about as you snack on tuna carpaccio and sip yourtinto de verano.

 Hotel Argantonio. 
Posada de Palacio, Sanlúcar 
This hotel has a faded beauty but a prized location among the palaces and 
bodegas of thebarrio alto (upper town). Comprising three once grand houses, and 
furnished with antique mirrors, desks, cabinets, clocks, statues, lamps and 
paintings, it’s like an underfunded museum with comfortable beds. The finest 
features are the original ones – the internal courtyards, traditional floor 
tiles, huge bedroom doors and shuttered windows opening on to balconies – all 
of which retain the authentic spirit of place. The owners plan to renovate and 
knock through to a fourth house, a neglected old property around the corner 
which in 1498 allegedly belonged to Columbus.

Hotel Argantonio, Cádiz
Central Cádiz looks as if it should be expensive but it’s not. You can find a 
place to stay within easy walking distance of every monument, plaza and playa 
on the map without forking out too much. Argantonio is the hotel you hope to 
find in all cities: central, friendly and affordable, round the corner from a 
good bar. Quintessentially Andalucían, with tiled floors, fountain and 
courtyard, it has pretty, if compact, bedrooms. There is parking nearby, but 
set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide if you’re planning to drop off your 
luggage first: roads here are narrow and generally have something parked in 
them.

Hotel La Casa del Califa, Vejer 
Hope for rain and curl up in an armchair with a book, linger over lunch in the 
atmospheric restaurant, watch clouds scudding over the pile of white blocks, 
domes and church towers that make up this spectacular town. Like Vejer itself, 
the hotel has a long history (it’s made up of eight houses, dating from the 
10th to the 17th centuries, with a 1,000-year-old water cistern, stables, 
courtyards and a grain store), and is aesthetically pleasing and seductively 
relaxing. But the Califa is the ideal base from which to explore the coast: 
Sanlúcar is one hour away; Cádiz one and a half hours – both to the north, and 
Tarifa just 45 minutes away to the south. The boutiques, bars and churches of 
Vejer itself are about five paces from the door.

Wallpaper House and Boston House, La Peña, Tarifa
You’ll appreciate how wild and elemental this coast is after a week in one of 
these two super-private, prefabricated open-plan beach houses high above the 
strait of Gibraltar. Sitting in a natural amphitheatre under a rocky ridge, the 
larger, Wallpaper House, sleeps six and was designed for Wallpaper* magazine. A 
polite distance away, Boston House, sleeping four, is basic but romantic and 
engulfed in flowers. It was shipped from the US in bits, with instructions. 
This is indoor-outdoor living at its best.

Riad Lolita, Tarifa
A classy renovation of a 19th-century house, Riad Lolita is available by the 
room or in its entirety. Languorous and stylish with a touch of the film set, 
it’s all greys, whites and creams, with tiled floors, marble staircases, beams, 
shutters and billowing curtains, crisp linens and chandeliers. Rooms are 
wrapped around an inner courtyard, and shared spaces include a pleasing kitchen 
– although given its location inside the old city, surrounded by cafés, bars 
and bakeries, you probably won’t be doing much cooking. The family suite 
(double, bathroom, and triple) is a rare thing and top value.
