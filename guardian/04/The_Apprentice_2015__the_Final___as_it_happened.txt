close  
So it’s the end of another lively series of The Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>. Thanks so much for all 
your comments on the blog over the last 12 million weeks. You’ve been 110% 
committed, passionate and team players.

All hail Valentino and goodnight!
 
“I want the cars, I want the girls and most of all I want the power,” “No 
stopping, no toilet breaks.” With that wisdom, Joseph will go far.
 
At last, Charleine is a winner. Of the award for stating the bleedin’ obvious.
 
It’s Lord Sugar’s best bits. “You couldn’t sell a bone to Battersea Dogs Home” 
has to be a series highlight.
 
The previous winners are in the house tonight, including the ever modest Mark 
Wright: “You’re about to experience one of the best years you’ll ever have.”
 
“Can I throw my thought into the thought pot?” Dan should have won for that 
line alone.
 
There’s a Mergim tribute going on. “Apply again,” says Lord Sugar. “In 12 
years.”
 
Joseph’s mum and sister are in the audience. “He was very cheeky, but we 
always knew he was going to do well.”
 
“I think it was an iconic moment,” says Joseph about shaving off his ’tache. 
“I did look a little second-hand car salesman-like.” And it’s a hit with the 
audience.
 
It’s Valentino’s fashion evolution: braces, shades, that legendary moustache - 
there’s nothing he can’t wear.
 
Reading Lord Sugar’s book was Joseph’s U-bend moment. “I literally quit my 
job.”
 
Straight outta Peterborough, here comes the man of the moment: Joseph Valente. 
And is that a bit of a makeover he’s had?
 
Salad, talking about how utterly terrifying Claude is and now Ruth’s even won 
an award for fishcakes. How much more of this can they string out? Just bring 
on the main man.
 
Forget the Loser Cafe, where is Joseph?
