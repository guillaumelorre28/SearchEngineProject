Astana <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/astana> are expecting to learn 
whether they retain their World Tour licence in approximately two weeks, a 
source within the Kakazh-funded team has revealed.

The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf had earlier reported that the UCI’s Licence 
Commission was to strip Astana, the team of the Tour de France champion 
Vincenzo Nibali, of their licence following a series of positive anti-doping 
tests last season.

The UCI, however, insisted in a statement that no decision would be taken 
until its licence commision met on Thursday this week.

Astana had until Monday to submit all documents in their defence to the 
commission and are planning to send a team to be heard on Thursday in 
Switzerland, the source said. Members of the Kazakh federation, sports 
directors, riders and the head doctor will travel to the 2 April meeting.

“We’ve been told it would then take about 10 days, so after Paris-Roubaix,” 
the source said.

The UCI said in February it wanted the sport’s licencing commission to strip 
Astana of their elite status. Kazakhstan-based Astana were only granted their 
World Tour licence for 2015 “under probation”.

But the UCI released a statement on 27 February saying it wanted the licence 
withdrawn

 after finishing a review of an audit on Astana which was undertaken by the 
Institute of Sport Sciences of the University of Lausanne (ISSUL).

The World Tour licence guarantees its holder direct participation in the top 
races, including the Tour de France, the Paris-Roubaix classic and the Giro 
d’Italia.

Several Astana riders failed dope tests last season. The UCI agreed to grant 
the team a licence but only on the condition that it underwent an independent 
audit.
