The Guardian children’s books site 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site> has won an award at the 
World Young Reader prize from the World Association of Newspapers and News 
Publishers (WAN-IFRA) for its engagement with young people.

The organisation named the site the winner of the prize’s public service 
category on Monday 21 September. The jury, which includes former winners of the 
award, said Guardian children’s books was “a great idea for how a newspaper can 
engage with young people and take them, and their opinions, seriously”.

Expressing her delight at the win, acting editor Emily Drabble said the site 
“couldn’t have done it” without its “incredible” members, who write all of its 
reviews and provide feedback on what they want to see covered.

“We know books can make the world a better a place and are so proud of all the 
children and authors who contribute,” said Drabble.
