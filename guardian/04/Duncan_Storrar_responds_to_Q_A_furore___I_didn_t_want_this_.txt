Duncan Storrar has responded to the furore that resulted from his question on 
Q&A, after a week spent “hiding from the media”.

Storrar provided a statement to ABC’s Media Watch for a program exploring how 
he had been treated <http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4463430.htm> 
in the media that was broadcast on Monday night.

“I don’t know where to start this except with what are the lessons for 
Australia in this episode,” he began the written statement,published in full 
<http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1616_storrar.pdf> on the ABC’s 
website.

He wrote that his question on tax-free thresholds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/qa-recap-questions-about-trickle-down-economics-open-the-floodgates>
 had shown politicians to be “out of touch”, and that he had been “dropped, 
probed and attacked … with no thought to the mental wellbeing of my children” 
as a result.

He also said that “every discrepancy” in his life had been exposed in print, 
ruining his job prospects: “would you give me a job after a Google search comes 
up with the headlines of last week and will be used as a example to keep people 
like me quiet”.

He said there had been “serious consequences” of the media coverage and 
singled out the News Corp press treatment of his “so-called story”,which took 
in his

 criminal record, alleged drug use and absent parenting.

“I told everybody I talk to that I … have serious mental issues. Knowing this 
the rightwing press decided to write the story’s they did without a care for me 
or my (now ex partner ) mental health … I ask does News Corp have a mental 
health policy when it comes to dealing with people like me. Yes they do, they 
have thrown this out to show the world that power.”

He said News Corp knew of his mental health problems and “still [came] in 
boots and all”: “Isn’t there a duty of care instilled in the mental health act?”

Storrar thanked the “wonderful people of Australia” for supporting him, 
mentioning those who contributed toa crowdfunding page that raised $60,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/qa-star-duncan-storrar-may-need-tax-advice-after-crowdfunding-success>
.

“Thank you for making sure my girls have their school needs taken care of. The 
money will go in a trust fund for school and to charities.”

The founders of the Go Fund Me page have asked community service 
<https://www.gofundme.com/23hcwd8> organisations in Victoria for help in 
establishing a framework to manage the donations.

Storrar concluded his statement by returning to his original question to the 
Q&A panel: “My question is still valid and hasn’t been answered.”

He wrote that Q&A was “the only place where people like me can ask questions 
of our leaders and policy makers ... we don’t have any other contact with these 
people”.

As such, it was “the most important part of democracy” he had available to him.

“There are a whole class of people out there, yes we might have records, yes 
we might not be perfect but society has forgotten us the politicians and the 
media use us whenever they want to show why they need to be elected but never 
do anything to help our plight. We are breaking down here and life hasn’t been 
this hard since before Whitlam for the underclass.

“Thank you Australia for all your support. I didn’t want this.”
