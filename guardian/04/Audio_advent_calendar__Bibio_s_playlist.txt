Here's what he had to say ...

I favour vinyl over playlists when at home, and I'm constantly changing the 
record, going from one thing to another. It can be as random as following The 
Ink Spots with Black Sabbath, or maybe Johnny Walker and John Coltrane followed 
by Daft Punk – it's just all stuff I love, I don't hear it as genres, I just 
hear it as music.

I grew up on rock and metal, and Iron Maiden were the first band I felt I had 
discovered all on my own. I was about 10 when I got my first Maiden tape from 
Asda-Price (as it was then called). I started listening to Thin Lizzy recently 
and realised just how much they influenced Maiden - even the logo is similar!

More recently I discovered Turkish legend Barış Manço, and some of his 70s 
output has a similar timbre to those early rock/metal classics I love. A recent 
addition to my LP collection was a Trio Bulgarka record. I don't think music 
gets much more melancholy than these Bulgarian female choir recordings, every 
piece I hear by them is so powerful and haunting, and being a musician myself I 
find listening to them a very humbling experience.
