You report that the Universities Superannuation Scheme has investments in 
British American Tobacco and Royal Dutch Shell (Cancer scientists’ pensions

Japan Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris

• Your correspondent (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/31/cockney-cross-words-over-cryptic-scooby>
, 1 June) decries the assumption of crossword compiler Brendan that “bottle” is 
cockney rhyming slang for “courage”. The clue does not actually suggest 
anywhere that the cockneys are to blame. Whether the compiler meant that or 
not, the OED says the use of “bottle” for “courage, spirit, guts”, especially 
in the phrase “to lose one’s bottle”, has been in use since at least 1958, and
probably derives from the term “no bottle” meaning “no good” or “useless”

, which was itself in use in 1846.

• I saw an error in cryptic crossword No 26,897 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26897>, set by Rufus. The 
correct answer to 17 across, “Lock in the experts, they’re only pretending to 
work (9)” is surely “actors”. But that has only six letters.

• As someone who was called Titty for a year and a half after we read Swallows 
and Amazons at primary school, I was delighted to hear that they are changing 
the name (Letters

, 1 June). I had to move schools before I could change mine.

• One line from Butterflies has always stuck in my mind (Writer of TV hit 
Bread, Carla Lane, dies at 87 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/31/carla-lane-writer-of-butterflies-and-bread-dies-aged-87>
, 1 June). In one episode Ria makes a comment to the cleaner about death, and 
the latter responds acerbically: “Well, at least I’ll get a good lie-in.” Enjoy 
your lie-in, Carla…
