The Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s former secret police chief, already 
serving 490 years in prison for human rights violations, was handed an 
additional 15-year sentence on Wednesday.

 Manuel Contreras was the head of operations at the Dina intelligence service, 
which ran torture centres where hundreds of people were killed.

 Chile’s supreme court sentenced Contreras to another 15 years for the murder 
of a husband and wife, Alejandro de la Barra and Ana Maria Puga, on 3 December 
1974.

Another four former Dina agents were also sentenced for the couple’s murder.

 An estimated 3,000 people disappeared or kidnapped and killed during the 
17-year dictatorship; 28,000 were tortured.

 Pinochet died in 2006 at the age of 91. He never faced a full trial for the 
crimes committed under his rule.
