I’m a theatre director who works with young people a lot. I’m a horror 
fanatic. So when I got asked whether I wanted to adapt one of the bestselling 
children’s books in the world (after Harry Potter, of course), Goosebumps, and 
make it into an immersive show for children, naturally I said yes.


But then I panicked. How was I going to create a piece of theatre that was 
scary, incorporating some of the best-known horror stories for children, 
without psychologically damaging the kids?

The original series of children’s horror fiction Goosebumps was written in the 
1990s byRL Stine <https://www.theguardian.com/books/rl-stine>. It was recently 
adapted into a feature film starring Jack Black. Soon the books will be made 
into two immersive theatre experiences at The Vaults under London’s Waterloo 
station. There’ll be a version for an adult audience, which, by the looks of 
it, will be petrifying – and a version for kids, which I hope will be 
exhilarating.

I watch a lot of horror films and generally know what the differences are 
between and 18 rating and a PG. The British Board Film Classification has a
clear set 
<http://www.bbfc.co.uk/education-resources/student-guide/issues-introduction/horror>
 of criteria to rate films with horror content, especially those aimed at young 
audiences: “Decisions will take into account such factors as the frequency, 
length and detail of scary scenes as well as horror effects, including music 
and sound, and whether there is a swift and reassuring outcome.”

Here are a few things I did to ensure I made the PG version of Goosebumps 
rather than a gore-tastic, nightmarish 18 version.

Distancing

With a film, the screen is a window to the action, but it’s also a barrier; 
the monsters can’t jump out of the screen and get you, even with the best 3D 
effects.Immersive theatre <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/immersive-theatre> 
on the other hand has no screen and the monsters can absolutely grab you at any 
given moment.

You can put a book down if it’s too scary or press stop on that creepy tales 
podcast, but in theatre there’s less escape. It means the scare factor could 
have increased exponentially if I didn’t frame the stories in a right way. So 
instead
of recreating the stories from Goosebumps as if we were reliving them, I’ve 
set the show in a museum, a place where the audience can explore the history of 
the stories.

Much like going to a museum to see ancient Egyptian mummies, you may be 
anxious at the fact you’re looking at dead bodies (some connected to the 
terrifyingdemises of others 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_pharaohs>), but you feel safe that 
you’re looking at it though some glass – a screen. That’s not to say that the 
whole show is looking at exhibits; I’ve upended the trope somewhat, as they all 
come to life (think Night at the Museum).

Tell them not to be scared

This may sound counterintuitive, but I wanted to have a way of telling the 
audience they should be brave. Early on in the show a “fear meter” is 
introduced. It reads how scared people are and if it reaches 100%, everyone is 
locked in forever (cue maniacal laugh and flashes of lighting). It gives the 
audience a clear consequence for them not to be scared: they get out of this 
weird museum.

By constantly reminding the audience to be brave and then trying to scare them 
witless, it becomes a game – one they need to win to escape. I’m currently 
developing a mantra for the audience to use/say as a way of demonstrating 
they’re not scared.

Make the audience heroes rather than victims

Scary stories are a way of telling us there is always something worse in the 
world. They also give us a place to rehearse being a hero. I had to balance 
making the audience both the object of terror as well as agents for surviving 
it.

Attendants at our fictional museum guide the audience through the action. 
They can be the ones who are scared of the horror, enabling the audience to 
feel like heroes, not victims. If the museum attendants are more scared than 
the audience, then we’re winning.Children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/children> can also reassure themselves 
that it’s not happening to them; it’s happening to the character.

Laugh at it all

Humour is the one thing fear can’t stomach: laughter banishes anxiety, 
releases endorphins and can help replace fear. It has the same energy as 
screaming
(we know this from Monster, Inc) so throughout the show I’ve tried to balance 
the tense moments with ones of pure comedy. If children leave knowing that if 
they can laugh at the things there are scared of, they become less scary.

Some specifics

 * The costumes will be larger than life in order to take us away from 
reality; there’s nothing scarier than believing that this actually could happen 
in real life.

 * Like a horror film, we’re using sound and light to indicate that something 
scary is about to happen; it’s a good way of preparing the audience.

 * While I don’t want to spoil the plot, if you have read The Blob that Ate 
Everyone then you will be in for a treat.
