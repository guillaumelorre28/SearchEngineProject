Alkmaar’s general director Robert Eenhoorn, who played for the New York 
Yankees and Anaheim Angels in the 1990s, said: “AZ was already very interested 
in the Moneyball principle before I got here. I have known Billy for a while, 
because of my history in baseball. When we approached him for this role with 
AZ, he was immediately enthusiastic.

“He has been able to close the gap with the big-market teams, by being 
innovative. We are very excited and look forward to working with him. Billy 
will give his advice from the States and he will visit Alkmaar a few times a 
year.”

Beane told the club’s website: “I am truly excited for the opportunity to be 
part ofAZ Alkmaar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/azalkmaar> in an 
advisory role. Despite being a great football club with a storied history, they 
face many of the challenges we have with the Oakland A’s. My love for football 
and AZ’s vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit.”
