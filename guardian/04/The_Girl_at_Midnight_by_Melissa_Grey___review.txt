I loved The Girl at Midnight by Melissa Grey. It was very easy to get into the 
story, and even though a few of the words were a little hard to understand, it 
didn’t matter because it was so well written. I really liked that the chapters 
were written by different characters’ perspectives, because it made you 
empathise with them more.

I hope there is a sequel. It does end on a cliffhanger, so I am assuming that 
that is what will happen, because if there is not another book, I am afraid I 
will rate this book lower than what I am rating it now.

The Girl at Midnight is about the search for the ‘firebird’, a supposedly 
mythical being that is supposed to end the war between the Avicen and the 
Drakharin, two races of people living right under our feet. Echo and Caius both 
set out to look for it, forming an unlikely crew of a human thief, a deposed 
prince, an apprentice healer, an ex-royal guard, and a career scoundrel.

My one gripe with the book is the cover – I don’t think that it does justice 
to the story inside of it. However, the actual making of the book prevented me 
from cracking the spine, which I loved.

In conclusion, The Girl at Midnight is a fantastic book that made me laugh and 
actually cry. I loved it.
