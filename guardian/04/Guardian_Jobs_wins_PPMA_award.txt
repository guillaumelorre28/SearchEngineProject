Guardian Jobs has been honoured with a recruitment, reward and retention award 
at this year’s PPMA (Public Sector People Managers’ Association) Excellence in 
People Management awards.

The PPMA Excellence in People Management awards celebrate the practices of HR 
professionals working within the public sector and their partners.


Guardian Jobs was recognised for its partnership with Cafcass. This is the 
first time a joint media and client submission has been put forward - with the 
Guardian providing recruitment, creative, strategic, research and editorial 
services.


Speaking about the award win, Guardian Jobs sales director Helen Bird said: 
“We were honored to be the sole partner chosen by Cafcass to support their 
challenge of becoming ‘the voice for a profession under pressure’. We took a 
holistic approach to the challenge at hand, using all of the Guardian’s 
channels to aid direct recruitment, influence retention and amplify the 
messages of their employer brand (something which had not previously been 
attempted in its entirety by a recruitment client before). We are delighted 
that all Cafcass’ hard work has paid off and that they continue to see the 
Guardian as a trusted recruitment partner.”
