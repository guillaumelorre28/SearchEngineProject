Police say the actor Wendell Pierce has been arrested at an Atlanta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta> hotel where he was a guest.


A newly released police report says that Pierce became upset by a conversation 
about politics, then followed a group of people to their hotel room, tried to 
get inside and hit a woman in the head.

In the report on the Saturday dispute at the Loews Atlanta Hotel, Pierce told 
police he was standing outside the hotel room when the woman and two of her 
friends tried to pull him inside.

The woman and two witnesses listed in the police report did not immediately 
respond to phone messages from the Associated Press.

Jail records show Pierce was charged with simple battery and released on 
$1,000 bond.

An Atlanta police department spokesman, Donald Hannah, said in a statement 
that Pierce was arrested early on Saturday morning at the Loews Atlanta hotel.

New Orleans native Pierce is known for his television roles as Detective 
William “Bunk” Moreland onThe Wire <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wire> and 
Antoine Batiste on Treme.

Hannah’s statement said the incident was not significant and was treated as 
“any other arrest”. He said Pierce never indicated he was well-known.

Online Fulton County jail records show Pierce was arrested on a charge of 
simple battery on Saturday and released the same day on $1,000 bond.

Hannah said the police will share the incident report once it has been 
completed. No other details were available.
