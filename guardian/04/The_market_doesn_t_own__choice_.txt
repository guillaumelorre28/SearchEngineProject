Hard times like these spawn fine-sounding buzz phrases: "personalisation", 
"individual budgets", "third-sector involvement", "cross-institutional 
collaboration", empowerment, recovery-focus, innovation. But false friends are 
worse than bitter enemies: many users anticipate cuts in provision being 
implemented under their guise, which aren't about to somehow make everything 
great, and cheaper to boot. None are of themselves bad notions, but their 
proper implementation is not guaranteed in this economic climate.

Tired free-market "solutions" unasked for by users are, as ever, being touted, 
appropriating this language of change and choice for an atomised consumerism 
that undermines social inclusion and the communality that accrues from the 
shared use of services. Users know social care monies are to meet needs, not 
wants, yet market-based solutions often try to create demand, promising the 
earth.

Involving users in service design and delivery gives better, cheaper systems, 
because users know what's needed. Responsive and personalised services, yes, 
but not necessarily if the cost is the loss of much-loved day centres, drop-ins 
and small providers disproportionately disadvantaged by the crude application 
of marketisation. True diversity of providers, and hence real choice, may 
disappear, with only the big corporates or quasi-corporate "super" charities 
left. Instead, invest in users not marketisers.
