A “forgotten” early work by the Watchmen, V for Vendetta and From Hell author 
Alan Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore>, about a disfigured 
man who murders those he doesn’t like, is to be brought back on to bookshelves 
after being out of print for more than 30 years.

Comic legend Moore created the series Monster for the weekly horror anthology 
Scream! in the early 1980s. According to the comic 2000 AD, which will release 
a 190-page book collecting the story’s dozens of episodes in July, it borrows 
from the gothic horror of Frankenstein and the banned EC horror comics of the 
50s, telling of a “gentle monster on the run”, who grows up locked in an attic, 
but escapes and turns to a life of murder.

 Alan Moore’s comic Monster, on which he worked with John Wagner, the creator 
of Judge Dredd. Click to expand and read. Illustrations: 2000 AD 
Moore wrote the first episode of the series, which launched on 24 March 1984, 
before Judge Dredd creator John Wagner finished off the story. The Monster 
comics had been out of print since the 80s, said 2000 AD; Scream! was cancelled 
on 30 June 1984 after a printer’s strike and absorbed into the Eagle comic, 
with Monster and the popular The Thirteenth Floor series the only two strips to 
transfer to Eagle.

“While Alan was beginning his groundbreaking run on Swamp Thing for DC Comics 
in America in the early 80s, he was still working for the UK industry where 
he’d cut his teeth,” said 2000 AD spokesman Michael Molcher. “The late 70s and 
early 80s were a heyday for British comics, with shelves groaning under the 
weight of a myriad of titles all the way from classic war comics through to 
horror comics. [But] despite teaching a whole generations of kids how to read 
and appreciate good stories, this period of classic British comics has been 
woefully neglected and with our reprints of Monster ... we’re bringing great 
comics from some legendary names back into the light.”

Monster, added Molcher, is the only time that Moore worked on a series with 
Wagner. “Finding good quality copies of Scream! has been difficult as the 
original film of the story has long since disappeared, but we have substantial 
experience with 2000 AD collections of restoring neglected comics back to how 
they looked in the 1970s and 80s,” said Molcher.

“And while people usually focus on the big UK comics names that went across to 
the US, such as Alan, Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, John Wagner has been 
consistently one of comics’ greatest writers across four decades.”

Molcher cited Wagner’s creation of Judge Dredd, his “gritty noir crime 
thriller” Button Man, which has just beenoptioned for TV development by JJ 
Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot 
<http://www.arthurranson.com/blog/tv-button-man>, and his graphic novel A 
History of Violence, adapted forfilm in 2005 by David Cronenberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/sep/30/2>. “He’s not as lauded, but 
he should be; and it’s a joy to republish a forgotten series by this titan of 
British comics,” said Molcher.

Alan Moore’s second novel, Jerusalem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/19/alan-moore-jerusalem-spring-2016-publication>
 – a fantastical exploration of his hometown of Northampton that ran to more 
than a million words in draft form – is slated for publication in September 
2016.A blurb released  
<http://www.goshlondon.com/2016/01/jerusalem-by-alan-moore-exclusive-first-look/>
on 5 January described it as: “An opulent mythology for those without a pot to 
piss in, through the labyrinthine streets and pages of Jerusalem tread ghosts 
that sing of wealth and poverty; of Africa, and hymns, and our threadbare 
millennium. They discuss English as a visionary language from John Bunyan to 
James Joyce, hold forth on the illusion of mortality post-Einstein, and insist 
upon the meanest slum as Blake’s eternal holy city. Fierce in its imagining and 
stupefying in its scope, this is the tale of everything, told from a vanished 
gutter.”
