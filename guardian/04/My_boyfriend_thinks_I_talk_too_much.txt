From Sarah, by email
Dear Carole, Please can you help me with an embarrassing problem which I can't 
seem to control that annoys my boyfriend (and my previous one too).

I'm in love with him, and he with me; we've been together for four 
years. But I talk more than him and can't seem to stop myself, especially when 
I'm excited or happy, when he's just trying to quietly enjoy the moment.

It doesn't help that he's Hungarian. I have learned a few basics of his native 
language, but am nowhere near fluent and can't hold a conversation in Hungarian.

Do you have any advice to help me control my talking when I'm excited or happy?

Carole replies:
Evolutionary theorists have argued that the evolution of female sociability is 
linked to the development of the primate neocortex.1 
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/20> This is the part of the brain 
responsible for language, sensory perception and self-awareness, among other 
cognitive abilities. (Neocortical abnormality is associated with autism and 
impaired communication skills.) The neocortex is proportionally larger in 
primates than in other mammals, larger in the apes than in monkeys and 
significantly bigger in humans.2 
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876205/> 

In addition, information transfer points between the brain's two hemispheres 
are larger in human females, thus facilitating rapid inter-hemispheric 
processing of linguistic and empathic information.3 
<http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/books/title.asp?isbn=0141011017> 

It is thought that social evolution in primates has been female-driven and 
that females are selected for group co-operation.4 
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1809975/> The idea is that those 
of our female primate ancestors who were communicative and co-operative 
breeders left behind higher numbers of descendants than those who did not 
communicate and co-operate.5

By around six months human infants start to babble and, depending on the 
sociability of the individual, this spontaneous chattiness may continue into 
adulthood. This is more likely to happen in females than males. Innate sex 
differences in brain architecture may give females the edge in social 
communication, though the difference is unrelated to measures of general social 
intelligence.

All of this research indicates that you, Sarah, and your ancestors have 
evolved to be chatty, babbling females. When primates become excited their 
vocalisations increase and you are no different. When you are in the company of 
like-minded female friends that isn't a problem. You can talk as much as you 
want, jump backwards and forwards between themes and sub-themes, and 
concurrently narrate multiple storylines. Your friends will happily reciprocate 
and no one will lose the plot.

But your hard-wired chattiness annoys the men in your life – men not 
hard-wired for empathic chattiness. You have reached a point now where you want 
to please your partner by controlling your spontaneous vocalisations. You are 
willing and perhaps able to adapt to his requirement for silence.

But here's your dilemma.

Many female primates only commune with males during sex, the rest of the time 
being spent in the company of females and infants. Males are often found 
sitting alone. By contrast, humans have developed a monogamous culture in which 
males and females spend social time together. Frequently men wish the females 
in their lives behaved more like males and women wish the men in their lives 
could get in touch with their feminine side.

Your personality type is most probably more socially flexible than your 
partner's, so it may be easier for you to quieten down than for your partner to 
reciprocate your need for constant chatter.

But at what cost? For an evolved, advanced social animal to deny this large 
part of herrself and metaphorically gag herself could lead to depression. 
Empathic humans have an innate requirement for companionship, shared experience 
and to listen and explore all points of view.6

 It is a therapeutic necessity for babbling humans to be able to exchange 
chatter, and to analyse the crucial information held therein, rather than to 
experience emotional highs and lows in isolation.

As you are in love with your current boyfriend, however, you will not want to 
find a new, chattier male. Perhaps, instead, when you cannot be in the physical 
company of girlfriends you could simply phone or message them? That way you 
could continue to live out your excited, babbling happiness and your desire to 
share that happiness with others without irritating your partner.

You might also try purging your excited thoughts by writing them down. 

Just don't forget that you have a duty to know your evolved self and keep 
yourself happy.
