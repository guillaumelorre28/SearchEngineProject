You know that you are reading a good book when you take it on holiday and 
finish it on the second night.

I was still reading the first novel in the series, Murder Most Unladylike, 
when I received First Class Murder, and was really enjoying it. The same goes 
for the second book, Arsenic for Tea. So I was expecting First Class Murder to 
be just as good, and it lived up to my expectations.

Unlike some detective novels, where the most important clue is revealed right 
at the end, and the reader has no chance of discovering the culprit for 
themselves, First Class Murder presents all the clues in the order that Hazel 
and Daisy (the two schoolgirl detectives) find them. (Unfortunately, if you 
speak German, one of the clues does, early on in the book, rule out one of 
their prime suspects).

If you do not know what a word means (like toilette or stenographer) you can 
look it up in the back of the book. There are maps and a ‘cast list’ in the 
first few pages.

I am thoroughly enjoying this series and I cannot wait for the next one. I 
would it to recommend to anyone.
