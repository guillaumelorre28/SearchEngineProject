The caturday before Easter is very special to those of us who love birds. Why? 
BecauseEaster <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/easter> is a 
celebration of EGGS! (Mostly chicken eggs.) Which means that today is the day 
when I can share some eggcellent science tricks with you -- many of which I've 
performed in the lab or in the pub!

This video is a compilation of ten of the most fascinating, most 
egggggggcellent science-y tricks you can do with eggs -- tricks that will 
impress your children, your relatives and your drinking pals! As an added 
bonus, this video is hosted by the Crazy Russian (and no, I am not talking 
about Vladimir Putin).
