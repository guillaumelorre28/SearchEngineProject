KnowBody; A lifetime of experiences

The highlight of the Sadler’s Wells’ celebration of older dancers is this 
triple bill of works, all cast with senior performers. The legendary dance 
partnership Mats Ek and Ana Laguna perform a duet; Jonathan Burrows creates a 
new piece for nine formerly pioneering British dancers and the Wells’ own 
Company of Elders perform an extract from Hofesh Shechter’s marvellous ensemble 
piece In your rooms. Promises an evening of artistry, knowledge and great good 
humour.

Ballet Boyz The Talent

The second generation Ballet Boyz continue to expand into a strikingly new and 
ambitious repertory. For this triple bill they collaborate with their first 
female choreographer, the funny and inventive Kristen McNally. Alexander 
Whitley’s Murmuring is a new work inspired by the wheeling, flocking flight 
patterns of birds, and completing the evening is a reworking of Christopher 
Wheeldon’s intricately crafted Mesmerics, set to music by Philip Glass.

Scottish Ballet

Artistic director Christopher Hampson continues his policy of developing new 
narrative ballets for Scotland, commissioning this dance version of Arthur 
Miller’s The Crucible from American choreographer Helen Pickett and a revival 
of Christopher Bruce’s Ten Poems, a celebration of the poetry of Dylan Thomas, 
set to readings by Richard Burton. Bruce’s choreography explores the musicality 
of the poems as well as their recurrent themes of nostalgia, lost innocence and 
the darkness of death.

Northern Light season

Dance is having its own Scandi moment with the Northern Light season drawing 
together artists from Sweden, Norway, Iceland etc. One of the highlights is 
Mats Ek’s Juliet and Romeo, which, as the title suggests, focuses on the 
emotional trajectory of its heroine, and uses an arrangement of Tchaikovsky’s 
music rather than the ubiquitous Prokofiev score. Later in the season is 
Cullberg Ballet’s performance of Jefta van Dinther’s epic dance-art 
installation, Plateau Effect.Sadler’s Wells <http://www.sadlerswells.com/>,

Birmingham Royal Ballet <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ballet> Triple Bill

Stories of the first world war have dominated stage and screen, but the three 
revivals in this programme focus on other war-related imagery. David Bintley’s 
Flowers of the Forest uses music by Arnold and Britten to evoke the battles and 
the losses in Scotland’s dark history, as well as the tartan and heather 
romanticism of its public image; Kenneth MacMillan’s La Fin du Jour focuses on 
the bubble of denial occupied by Europe’s Bright Young Things in the years 
leading up to the second world war; and there’s Gillian Lynn’s recreation of 
Miracle in the Gorbals, the revolutionary vision of life and death in a Glasgow 
ghetto, choreographed by Robert Helpmann in 1944 with designs by Edward Burra.
Birmingham Hippodrome (brb.org.uk <http://brb.org.uk/>), 8-11 October, then 
touring.

Rocío Molina: Bosque Ardora

Acknowledged as one of the most formidable flamenco dancers of her generation, 
Rocío Molina is a performer of lavish technique, magnetic stage charisma and an 
exceptional command of rhythm. She’s also an expressive, inventive and 
challenging choreographer, pushing flamenco beyond its traditional limits. In 
her latest work, Bosque Ardora, she performs with two male dancers and six 
musicians, using a looping sound score and modern design to portray the feral 
embattled instincts lurking behind our sophisticated public selves.

Le Patin Libre – Vertical Influences

The experimental Canadian ice dance company make their London debut with a new 
double bill that challenges every cliche and convention of traditional 
figure-skating. The five members of Le Patin Libre (Free Skate) started out 
performing on frozen ponds and canals in their home town of Montreal. Here, in 
a show that’s part of Dance Umbrella, they have the audience actually seated on 
the ice. 
Alexandra Palace Ice Rink, London N22 (sadlerswells.com

Thomas Adès: See the Music, Hear the Dance

The second subject of the Wells’ excellent Composer Series is Thomas Adès, one 
of the great contemporary composers for dance. This mixed bill features two new 
creations: a trio by rising talent Alexander Whitley set to Adès’s Piano 
Quintet, and an epically scaled response to his Polaris by the magnificent 
Crystal Pite. Completing the programme are revivals of Wayne McGregor’s Outlier 
and Karole Armitage’s duet Life Story, performed by two dancers from her own 
company plus British soprano Claire Booth, with Adès on piano.

Akram Khan & Israel Galván: Torobaka

Khan has joined forces with some extraordinary dance artists in his career, 
from Sylvie Guillem to Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. This autumn’s project should 
deliver sparks as Khan creates and performs a duet with flamenco iconoclast 
Galván, exploring their fascination with rhythm, gesture, pattern and myth.

Royal Ballet mixed bill

Music from the war-shadowed decades of the 1930s and 40s inspires the three 
choreographers showcased in the Royal Ballet’s latest mixed programme. Kim 
Brandstrup’s Ceremony of Innocence uses Britten’s Variations on a Theme of 
Frank Bridge (1937) to create a haunting elegy for lost youth, with outstanding 
roles for its leads Edward Watson and Marcelino Sambé. A second Britten score, 
Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) leads Christopher Wheeldon into the darker terrain 
of war and sacrifice in his densely imagined ballet Aeternum (revived this 
season after its 2013 premiere). Finally, Liam Scarlett turns to Britten’s 
contemporaries WH Auden and Leonard Bernstein for the inspiration of his new 
ballet, The Age of Anxiety.
Royal Opera House <http://www.roh.org.uk/>, London EC2, 7-17 November.

Rambert autumn tour

Mark Baldwin’s choreographic imagination has embraced science in recent works, 
and The Strange Charm of Mother Nature is part of that trend. Inspired by the 
discovery of the “God Particle” and set to music by Stravinsky and Cheryl 
Frances-Hoad, it’s a work whose intricate patterning and vivid energies mimic 
the design of the known universe. Also premiering this autumn is a long overdue 
commission for Shobana Jeyasingh, a chance to see her meticulously rhythmic 
style on Rambert’s excellent dancers. Terra Incognita draws on modern urban 
legends and ancient cartography to consider the perils of journeying into the 
unknown and is set to a new score by Gabriel Prokofiev.
