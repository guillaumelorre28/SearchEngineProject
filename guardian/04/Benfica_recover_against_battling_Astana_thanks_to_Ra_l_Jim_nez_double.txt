, this was enough for the Portuguese side to qualify for the last 16 with a 
game to spare.

Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> started slowly in 
freezing conditions in Kazakhstan and went behind in the 19th minute when the 
Astana forward Patrick Twumasi, back after a four-game ban, met Junior

Twelve minutes later, Marin Anicic made it 2-0 for Astana with a glancing 
header off Foxi Kéthévoama’s free-kick.

Jiménez sparked the comeback with a powerful 40th-minute header from a cross 
by Jonás and scored his second from close range in the 72nd as the Astana 
goalkeeper, Nenad Eric, failed to react to a shot.

Benfica had good chances to score and could have won the game. Shortly before 
Jiménez’s first goal, Eric had produced a spectacular leaping save to deny a 
powerful shot from Andreas Samaris.

Astana went into their first ever Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> campaign as the 
outsiders in the group but will finish unbeaten at home, recording draws in all 
three games.

The Kazakh champions are now in last place and unable to qualify for the 
knockout stages but could still overtake Galatasaray for third and a place in 
the Europa League.
