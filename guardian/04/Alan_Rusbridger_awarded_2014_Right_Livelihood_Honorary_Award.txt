The Guardian’s editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger has been awarded 2014’s Right 
Livelihood Honorary Award, recognising his work in “building a global media 
organisation dedicated to responsible journalism in the public interest, 
undaunted by the challenges of exposing corporate and government malpractices”.
Founded in 1980, the Right Livelihood Awards are presented annually in the 
Swedish Parliament and are often referred to as ‘Alternative Nobel Prizes’. 
They were introduced with the stated aim “to honour and support those offering 
practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today”.
Rusbridger shares the award with whistleblower Edward Snowden, whose 
groundbreaking revelations about government surveillance were first published 
by the Guardian in 2013. As part of the award, the Right Livelihood Awards 
Foundation will fund legal support for Snowden.
The awards will be presented at a ceremony in the Swedish Parliament on Monday 
1 December, 2014, at 4.00pm, hosted by the Society for the Right Livelihood 
Award in the Swedish Parliament.
