The winner

January traditionally sees the beginning of the annual awards-movie binge, 
with Oscar-bait now coming thick and fast until the middle of February. First 
out of the gate wereThe Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/the-theory-of-everything-review-stephen-hawking-biopic-gravity>
 andBirdman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/birdman-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-film-review>
, both hoping to grab some vital box-office before audiences become overwhelmed 
with choice. The victor in round one is The Theory of Everything, with a 
stunning £3.75m from a broad 532 cinemas, including £803,000 in New Year’s Day 
previews.

Sections of the British media have presented this year’s best-actor race as a 
battle between Theory’sEddie Redmayne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne> and The Imitation Game’s 
Benedict Cumberbatch <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch>
. The Imitation Game kicked off in November with £2.74m, including £47,000 in 
previews. Ignoring previews, Theory is running 9% ahead of Imitation at the 
same stage of its run.

 Eddie Redmayne: ‘There’s a maths teacher out there laughing at me playing 
Stephen Hawking’ 
After a disappointing 2014 (see below), UK cinema owners will be very happy 
with the start to 2015. Exactly a year ago,American Hustle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/19/american-hustle-review> expanded 
from a tiny West End London platform to full UK release, grossing £3.47m, 
including £1.11m in previews. Excluding previews, Theory is running 25% ahead 
of Hustle’s first session of wide play.

The runner-up

Dropping 24% from the previous session, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five 
Armies falls from the top spot after three weeks at the chart summit. In fact, 
the news for backers Warners/New Line is better than that. If New Year’s Day 
previews for The Theory of Everything are left out of the picture, Five Armies 
retains pole position for a fourth week, with £3.25m weekend box-office. The 
cumulative total is now £36.75m, which is about 2% down on its predecessor,The 
Desolation of Smaug 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/hobbit-desolation-of-smaug-review>
, at the same stage of its run. Five Armies will now shed screens and showtimes 
as cinema bookers struggle to accommodate the onslaught of new films, but it 
should crack £40m. Smaug maxed out at £42.9m.

 Nicole Kidman on Paddington: ‘The idea of tolerance is a beautiful thing to 
put out’ 
All shall have prizes

The first weekend in January invariably sees riches spread widely across a mix 
of titles, as families visit the cinema one last time before the kids go back 
to school and the awards contenders start to arrive. In 2014, the first session 
of the year saw no fewer than eight films taking more than £1m; 2015 has 
repeated the feat (see top 10 films chart, below).

Alongside Theory of Everything and Five Armies, star performer is Paddington, 
up a handy 11%. To be grossing £2.8m in the sixth weekend of release is 
exceptional, as is the film’s cumulative total of £30.82m. That’s enough to 
make Paddington the fifth-biggest 2014 release, behind Five Armies (£36.75m so 
far),The Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review> (£34.34m), 
The Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/06/inbetweeners-2-review-film> 
(£33.39m) andDawn of the Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/17/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-andy-serkis>
 (£32.72m). Look for Paddington to overtake a few more of those 2014 hits in 
the coming weeks.

Another notable riser is Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb>, up 
10%. After a slow start, the film is recovering, and has reached £9.69m so far. 
Annie did even better, rising 20% from its previous session, albeit with a 
smaller total. Penguins of Madagascar, which props up the top 10, rose 23%. 
Look for all these family films to fall in the next session.

The genre hit

Providing an alternative to the upscale fare and family films on offer, The 
Woman in Black: Angel of Death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/woman-in-black-2-angel-of-death-review>
 landed with a nifty £2.43m, including £547,000 in previews. That’s down on the 
opening number for the firstWoman in Black 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/09/the-woman-in-black-film-review> 
(£3.15m), but that’s understandable in the circumstances. The original Woman in 
Black benefited from high awareness of the Susan Hill book, the long-running 
stage play and lead actor Daniel Radcliffe. Assuming a modest production budget 
and some foreign success, Angel of Death looks profitable for Hammer and 
backers eOne.

The awards-race alternative

While The Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-theory-of-everything> had the middlebrow 
audience sewn up, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman offered an alternative 
for more adventurous cinemagoers, encouraged by critical acclaim and awards 
attention. Fox released the film on a five-screen platform beginning Boxing 
Day, achieving £133,000 over even days. The film debuted with a strong £1.52m 
from 259 screens, including £369,000 in previews (earned from the platform 
release plus wider play on 1 January).

This is the first Iñárritu film ever to debut at £1m-plus. Both Babel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/19/drama.thriller> and 21 Grams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/05/3> landed around the 
£580,000-£590,000 mark, from a release about half the size of Birdman’s. 
Iñárritu’s last film, the Spanish-languageBiutiful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/27/biutiful-review>, enjoyed a more 
limited release.

The year in review

Data gatherer Rentrak has issued its official box-office report for 2014, 
showing receipts for the UK and Ireland 2.9% down on 2013. That’s the biggest 
annual dip since tracking began in 1991. Top grosser for the year is The Lego 
Movie, with £34.3m. That means that 2014 has ended with no film breaking the 
£40m barrier, for the first time since 1998, although Five Armies should reach 
that milestone before it completes its run. However, every year since 1998 has 
witnessed at least one film cracking £45m (last year’s wasDespicable Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/despicable-me-2-review>), so 2014 
will probably go down as yielding the lowest-grossing top film for 16 years: we 
will know for sure when Five Armies completes its run.

As Rentrak’s UK boss Lucy Jones comments 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11327199/UK-cinemas-suffer-biggest-drop-in-box-office-takings-since-records-began.html>
, 2014 lacked the major event movies that “motivate irregular cinema-goers to 
book that ticket”, and it’s true that the large section of the UK population 
that hardly ever goes to the cinema wasn’t very motivated to do so in 2014. 
When a film comes along that engages this audience, the rewards can be enormous 
– £103m in the case ofSkyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review>, for instance.

The future

Thanks to the wealth of riches spread across so many titles, takings were 25% 
up on the Boxing Day weekend, and 7% up on the equivalent session from 2013, 
which was considered a fantastic period for cinemagoing at the time. Overall, 
the weekend of 2-4 January ranks third for the past year, beaten only by the 
frames that saw the arrival of The Inbetweeners 2 and a previews-inflated
Transformers: Age of Extinction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay>
.

Cinema bookers are now faced with a tough challenge trying to keep all the 
films on-screen, while making room for fresh arrivalsInto the Woods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/17/into-the-woods-review-meryl-streep-rob-marshall-stephen-sondheim>

 andTaken 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/25/taken-3-liam-neeson-20-million>. 
It’s only going to get harder as January develops, yielding some tough 
negotiations in the holdover sessions every Monday morning.
