The Schweppes outdoor campaign, which breaks on Monday, also features Pete 
Doherty and Kate Moss apparently in a festive embrace while carol singing.

Jackson shot the campaign, created by Mother London, which runs with the 
strapline: "Sch ... you know who should mix this Christmas."

The campaign marks a one-off return of the Schweppes ads, also created by 
Mother and shot by Jackson, featuring celebrity lookalikes, that appeared in 
2001 and 2002.

Previous Schweppes campaigns depicted scenes such as a Cherie Blair lookalike 
apparently pinching Tony's bottom, Mrs Thatcher visiting Jeffrey Archer in 
prison, and Camilla Parker Bowles preparing for her wedding day.

Other celebrity lookalikes that have appeared in the campaign, which used the 
strapline "Sch ... you know who", included Victoria Beckham and Hugh Grant.

In August last year, Schweppes' parent company Coca-Cola ploughed its 
biggest-ever marketing investment into the brand, bringing it back to UK TV 
after a seven year break.

The campaign, which pushed Schweppes as the perfect mixer for spirits and 
cocktails,introduced the strapline
