In a statement, Bulldogs chief executive David Stevenson said they became 
aware of the alleged leak three days after the September 12 season-ending loss.

The Bulldogs called it “in appropriate transmission of game-sensitive 
information”.

“While we do not believe this matter had a material bearing on the game or the 
result, we believe it is appropriate to report these matters relating to 
integrity to the AFL for consideration,” Stevenson added.

The Crows also released a statement on Tuesday, denying they had done anything 
wrong.

“We are aware of an internal investigation undertaken by the Western Bulldogs 
regarding the transmission of some limited game-sensitive information in the 
lead-up to our recent final,” Crows chief executive Andrew Fagan said.

“Our club strongly refutes any suggestion of wrongdoing.

“At no stage did our coaches meet to discuss any information received from an 
external source, nor did it alter our team selection, strategies or game plan.”

Bulldogs captain Bob Murphy said on Tuesday night that people had to tread 
carefully regarding the matter.

“Football clubs are family ... it’s such a close knit brethren and feeling 
among people,” he said.

“I’d hate to think that was broken.”
