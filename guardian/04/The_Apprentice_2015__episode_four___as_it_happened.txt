Next week...

All authors will be delighted to hear that, next week, the candidates will be 
tasked with creating a children’s book. That’s a book, in two days. Lovely. 
Can’t see those being shite.

Join me here, clinging to a small drawing done by my child, trying to remember 
the good in the world, same time next week.

She says thank you and she should thank him because he’s saved her from being 
known forever more as the woman onThe Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> who wore those suits.

Selina is given an eleventh hour reprieve and Scott knows he was never really 
going anyway. I enjoyed how Gary switched so quickly from slagging off Selina 
to punching the air when he sees her coming through the door. Apprentice 
candidates should never wear shorts during this process. It diminishes their 
power base.

You're fired

There’s no way Scott is going. I think it’s Selina. I hope it is. I really 
want Ruth to stay.

As the plinky piano of doom builds towards the first of several false 
crescendoes, the firing finger of GO AWAY is tragically aimed and launched 
at... Ruth.

“You couldn’t sell a bone to Battersea dogs’ home,” sneers Alan as Ruth tries 
and fails to get him to listen to her. I want him to stop talking.

Scott butts in and Alan lets him talk for longer than he’s ever let a girl. I 
know but come on.

Selina’s defence of her business track record is vehement. Alan and Scott both 
shut her down with their patronising head-pats. I might chuck myself in front 
of a show-jumping rabbit in a minute to make my point.

“I find you very unconcise,” says Selina to Ruth. I’ll just let that sit there.

Scott massively dithered, Selina got slammed by Claude and Karren and Ruth is 
enthusiastic but apparently ineffective as a capitalist drone. Who will be 
shoved into the pit of fire this week? Place your bets.

I’d push Selina but I bet it’s Ruth. She’s too reasonable.

Scott, the rotten splitter, is bringing back Ruth and Selina. The girls are 
taking the blame again. I am starting to become uneasy about this because they 
are all clearly as useless as each other. Equality in all things.

All authors will be delighted to hear that, next week, the candidates will be 
tasked with creating a children’s book. That’s a book, in two days. Lovely. 
Can’t see those being shite.

Join me here, clinging to a small drawing done by my child, trying to remember 
the good in the world, same time next week.
 
She says thank you and she should thank him because he’s saved her from being 
known forever more as the woman onThe Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> who wore those suits.

Selina is given an eleventh hour reprieve and Scott knows he was never really 
going anyway. I enjoyed how Gary switched so quickly from slagging off Selina 
to punching the air when he sees her coming through the door. Apprentice 
candidates should never wear shorts during this process. It diminishes their 
power base.
 
There’s no way Scott is going. I think it’s Selina. I hope it is. I really 
want Ruth to stay.

As the plinky piano of doom builds towards the first of several false 
crescendoes, the firing finger of GO AWAY is tragically aimed and launched 
at... Ruth.
 
“You couldn’t sell a bone to Battersea dogs’ home,” sneers Alan as Ruth tries 
and fails to get him to listen to her. I want him to stop talking.

Scott butts in and Alan lets him talk for longer than he’s ever let a girl. I 
know but come on.
 
Selina’s defence of her business track record is vehement. Alan and Scott both 
shut her down with their patronising head-pats. I might chuck myself in front 
of a show-jumping rabbit in a minute to make my point.

“I find you very unconcise,” says Selina to Ruth. I’ll just let that sit there.
 
Scott massively dithered, Selina got slammed by Claude and Karren and Ruth is 
enthusiastic but apparently ineffective as a capitalist drone. Who will be 
shoved into the pit of fire this week? Place your bets.

I’d push Selina but I bet it’s Ruth. She’s too reasonable. 
 
Scott, the rotten splitter, is bringing back Ruth and Selina. The girls are 
taking the blame again. I am starting to become uneasy about this because they 
are all clearly as useless as each other. Equality in all things.
 
Elle blames their failure to secure the balloons. “They were a phenomenal 
product,” says Brett in a way that makes my heart bleed for him. His eyes dim 
as he says this. I’m sure they used to be blue.

Gary with his hair (solid mass) was a floating sales Exocet who hit a sum 
total of no targets. Ruth reacts in a very restrained way when Alan seems to 
tell her to sod off. Why is she here? She shouldn’t be here.
 
“You don’t get nine lives in this process,” smarms Alan. No one moves.

After a respectful pause, Scott starts defending and the first bluster of faux 
fury is aimed at Ruth’s jaunty lapels. He huffs and puffs about her “scenic 
route” approach to conversations. Ugh, almost like she has real human traits. 
What was she thinking?

Selina immediately jumps in when her assistance from Scott over that sale is 
called into question. Claude shuts her down as she fights for her life. Claude 
hammers in another nail, telling her she just didn’t seem that interested. 
Everyone else remains silent.
 
Back in the sad cafe (Holly Hunter hammering away at the keys just out of
