Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> has claimed 
responsibility for a suicide attack on a crowded mosque in Kabul that killed 
more than 30 people and wounded dozens in its third major attack on minority 
Shias in the Afghan capital since July.

More than 80 people were injured, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for 
Afghanistan’s ministry of public health. The number of dead, which included at 
least one child, was expected to rise.

The attack, on Monday afternoon, targeted the Baqir ul-Uloom mosque in the 
Darulaman area. It took place towards the end of a prayer ceremony marking 
Arbaeen, a religious observance on the 40th day of the martyrdom of Imam 
Hussein, perceived by Shias to be the rightful heir to the prophet Muhammad.

Jamil Yawari, 22, who was injured in the blast and woke up in hospital after 
being flung into a wall by the explosion, said the mosque was crowded at the 
time of the attack. “In my line, I sat next to three or four children,” he said.

Images circulating on social media, purportedly from the scene, showed 
numerous dusty and bloodied bodies spread across the mosque floor.


A statement in Arabic from Isis’s Amaq news agency said one of its fighters 
had targeted the mosque.

It is the third time in as many months that Kabul’s Shias have been targeted 
in a large-scale attack. In October, a gunmanattacked another Shia mosque

 in Kabul where mourners had gathered to mark Ashura, Imam Hussein’s death day.

Affiliates of Isis claimed culpability for that attack, in which at least 14 
people died, and foran attack in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/hazara-minority-targeted-by-suicide-bombs-at-kabul-protest>
, which killed at least 80 protesters who were mainly Hazaras, a Shia minority.

While Afghanistan has traditionally avoided sectarian conflict on a level that 
plagues other countries in the region, the recentemergence of fighters loyal to 
Isis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/isis-in-afghanistan-their-peak-is-over-but-they-are-not-finished>
, a Sunni group, has coincided with a recent spate of terrorist attacks against 
Shias.


The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, condemned the attack, which he called “a 
great crime and the work of the enemies of the people of Afghanistan”.

The president “considers attacks on sacred and religious sites to be clear 
enmity with Islam and the people ofAfghanistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> as well as an attempt to sow 
seeds of discord”, a statement said.
