Key points

Jeremy Corbyn questioned David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> on the looming NHS winter 
crisis, accusing him of failing to solve the problem of social care for older 
people, the lack of which is piling pressure on hospital wards. Cameron 
responded by insisting that his government has done more to fund the system 
than Labour committed to at the last election.

A comfortable win for Corbyn. It is unusual for Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> to lose on health at PMQs, but 
Corbyn was well beyond competent. His questions were sharp and relevant, he 
used humour well and he responded graciously to a jibe from Cameron about his 
supposedly not being able to wish people happy Christmas (he did). Cameron does 
have answers on the NHS, although his figures for the increasing volume of NHS 
activity are really just a recognition of growth (the volume of NHS activity is 
almost always going up). Corbyn is right about the problems with the social 
care precept, and Cameron’s repeated attempts to change the subject, on to 
unemployment, came across as symptomatic of weakness, not strength.

Best lines

Corbyn pressured Cameron on cuts to nursing training funding quoting a 
would-be trainee, Abbie, who can’t afford to take up a place without a bursary 
– but his opening comment drew the loudest reaction in the house:

May I start by wishing you, members of the house, staff and Major Tim Peake 
who is not on the planet at this time, a very happy Christmas and peaceful new 
year.

During exchanges on cuts to social care Cameron said he was glad Corbyn 
listens to the BBC’s Today programme; he might want to go on it, because a “bit 
of transparency would be good”.
