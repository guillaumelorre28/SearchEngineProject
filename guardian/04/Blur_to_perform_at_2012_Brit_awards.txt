Blur have confirmed they will perform at the 2012 Brit awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/britawards>. The group will celebrate their 
outstanding contribution to music trophy by playing their first gig since 2009, 
bassist Alex James has revealed. "We're going to play, which is brilliant," he 
said. "It's like putting the Blues Brothers back together."

It has been two weeks since plans were announced to honour Blur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/08/blur-brit-awards?INTCMP=SRCH> at 
the Brit awards in February. But the band remained evasive about whether they 
would perform; although James, Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon and Dave Rowntree 
have often met up, and evenrecorded together 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/03/damon-albarn-blur-notting-hill>, 
they haven't played live since closing 2009's T in the Park.

James has now put speculation to rest. Thanks to the Brits announcement, he 
said, "we all remembered how much we loved being a band.

"I saw the guys this week, we had a Christmas cuppa â€¦ I had always said in 
interviews I didn't miss being in a band, but that reminded me I did."

James also fanned the flames of a future Blur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur> tour. "Well, let's hope," he said. 
"Heritage year next year." Albarn has previously hinted at a possiblevisit to 
the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/03/damon-albarn-blur-notting-hill>, 
pointing out the reunited Blur never crossed the Atlantic. "Who knows what will 
happen," James said, "but there is a lot to look forward to."

Previous winners of the outstanding contribution to music prize include Paul 
McCartney, U2, Queen and the Who.
