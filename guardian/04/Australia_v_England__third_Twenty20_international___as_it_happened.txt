Right, then. The winter of discombobulation is official over. I might hug 
myself, and advise that you do the same.

Thanks all for your company and comments throughout a very trying period. May 
you all return to your families and equilibria with love and happiness, and let 
us say Amen.

Credit where it's due. After so many magnificent wallopings, the man on the 
Clapham omnibus might have assumed that England - even England - were out of 
magnificent wallopings. Not so. Never so. 84 runs, in a T20! Wow. That is a
magnificenter walloping. We are in the presence of true greatness, and for that 
we must be grateful.

Updated at 11.58am GMT

11.53am GMT 

AUSTRALIA WIN BY 84 runs, and win the series 3-0

Yes they do. And how very good they've been. 

11.53am GMT 

IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER! JOY UNBOUNDED! CELEBRATION! FELICITATION! Dernbach run 
out, obviously 1 (England all out 111)

Relief, release, recrimination. 

Updated at 12.51pm GMT

11.51am GMT 

18th over: England 110-9 (Jordan 9, Dernbach 1)

Epithets and epigrams: 


Mac Millings: "'Frightening', Stuart Broad called this line-up. He's got a 
point. As an England supporter, every time they walk out to bat, I'm terrified."

Patrick Over: "The Australian cricket board has just announced a review of 
England's tour to try and work how England beat the Chairman's XI."

11.49am GMT 

17th over: England 110-9 (Jordan 9, Dernbach 1)

Surely there must be some kind of means of exiting this circumstance? There 
exists a surfeit of disorientation, and I am unable to locate even a modicum of 
respite.

Apparently not. 

11.46am GMT 

WICKET! Broad b Muirhead 2 (England 104-9)

This is a lovely delivery, bouncing and turning back into Broad, who tries to 
hit with it, mentally hoisting one over midwicket. He misses, and is gone.

11.44am GMT 

16th over: England 99-8 (Jordan 0, Broad 2)

A quiet over from Coulter-Nile, mainly short stuff - but Jordan manages to get 
hold of one, pulling his head away in case he missed but sending a four down to 
square-leg. 92 required, off 24 deliveries.

Updated at 11.45am GMT

11.41am GMT 

15th over: England 99-8 (Jordan 0, Broad 1)

How will we replace such a reliable provider of despondency once this tour is 
over? Can our family, friends and jobs really accept such a monumental burden? 
Nowthat's pressure.

11.39am GMT 

WICKET! Bresnan st Wade b Muirhead 14 (England 98-8)

Brave bowling, this, Muirhead tossing one up and finding a little extra drift 
and turn, Bresnan missing with his blacksmith's swipe and Wade quickly whisking 
off the bails.

11.37am GMT 

15th over: England 92-7 (Bresnan 14, Jordan 0)

Muirhead's leggies are introduced to the attack, and Bresnan canes his second 
delivery over the boundary at long-off for six.

11.36am GMT 

14th over: England 92-7 (Bresnan 8, Jordan 0)

Anitdonstop.

11.35am GMT 

WICKET! Bopara b Coulter-Nile 4 (England 92-7)

Say what you like about Ravi Bopara, he's creative. So here, he takes an 
almighty swing a full one, imparts a substantial outside-edge onto his pad, and 
then waits for the ball to krich into his leg-pole, just dislodging the bail.

11.34am GMT 

14th over: England 92-6 (Bopara 4, Bresnan 8)

Just a perfect day
drink Sangria in the park
And then later
when it gets dark, we go home

Just a perfect day
feed animals in the zoo
Then later
a movie, too, and then home

Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
it's such fun

Just a perfect day
you made me forget myself
I thought I was
someone else, someone good

Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow

11.30am GMT 

13th over: England 84-6 (Bopara 2, Bresnan 0)

At this stage, Australia were 117-2. Pip Pirrip and Joe Gargery must be 
chuckling away.

11.28am GMT 

WICKET! Morgan c Starc b Cutting 34 (England 82-6)

Morgan has no option but to swing, which he does - not hard enough. And Starc, 
leaning in, pitching forward and inserting fingers neath ball for yet a yet a 
yet another great catch. Morgan isn't sure, so waits for the replay, but he's 
done. And so are England. I am the Resurrection is playing - down, down, they 
bring you down.

Updated at 11.30am GMT

11.26am GMT 

13th over: England 80-5 (Morgan 34, Bopara 2)

Oooh, who doesn't love Patient Ravi? But there's no time for this here. 

11.24am GMT 

WICKET! Buttler c Maxwell b Christian 8 (England 79-5)

Another quiet over forces a big shot - by the look of things, Buttler was 
planning to hit straight, but ended up sending one to cow corner, where Maxwell 
pouches easily.

Updated at 11.25am GMT

11.22am GMT 

12th over: England 79-4 (Morgan 33, Buttler 8)

At some point, England are going to require an over or two of enormity - 
perhaps they might target Christian. But his line is good, straight enough and 
following the batter

"You've got my mouth watering", says Mac Millings. "Try saying "Refrigerated 
Kit Kat" out loud. Poetry. Let it roll around your yap. Let it melt in your 
maw. Tastes almost as good as the real thing."


All chocolate should be cooled, but here's something special about this 
particular iteration - obviously this is pre-chunky days, too, and your 
four-fingered special.

11.19am GMT 

11th over: England 75-4 (Morgan 31, Buttler 6)

Morgan is right onto Maxwell's first ball, slammed through cover four. But 
it's followed by two dots, and then an almost caught as he tries to compensate, 
edging just in front of third man. Four runs from the final five balls is very 
good bowling indeed.

11.16am GMT 

10th over: England 67-4 (Morgan 24, Buttler 5)

Mark Taylor is telling Morgan off, for saying that he'd earned the right to 
bat as low as five, rather than as high as somewhere higher. Quite. "Selfish" 
and "rubbish", he reckons. In the meantime, England's two hitters can't do much 
hitting, just three runs from the first four balls, before a Butt-Scoop gets 
four, Buttler moving to off and just managing to catch up with the ball. He 
then tries the same again, and misses.

11.12am GMT 

WICKET! Root c Cutting b Maxwell 11 (England 60-4)

The pressure tells, again. Root flings his bat, off balance, and picks out 
Cutting on the midwicket boundary, again.

11.11am GMT 

9th over: England 60-3 (Root 11, Morgan 23)

Morgan takes four from Maxwell's opening delivery after Cutting slides past 
his cover drive on the boundary - and then a single. That's 23 off 9 for him - 
and Root tries to return him the strike, but a nurdle to leg earns two by 
mistake, and then two dots increase the peace pressure.

11.09am GMT 

8th over: England 53-3 (Root 9, Morgan 18)

Christian into the attack, and after Root finalges a single, Morgan moves to 
the offside and a snap of the wrists sends the ball hurtling over his right 
shoulder for six down at backward square-leg. But the rest of the over is 
quiet, sending the required rate above 12.

Meanwhile, Robin Hazlehursthas beef:


"It's beginning to seem that England's biggest eff-up on this tour was winning 
that ODI. Without that they could laid claim to a triple whitewash and the most 
gloriously awful tour of all time. But no, they couldn't even manage that and 
failed even to be the best at being the worst. Which therefore makes this tour 
the very worst ever. QED."


I'd agree - though they've partially redeemed themselves with the extent of 
almost every defeat.

11.05am GMT 

7th over: England 43-3 (Root 7, Morgan 10)

Root is trying, narrowly avoiding an lb after missing a reverse sweep. Two 
byes then give a hand, and then a single brings Morgan on strike for the final 
ball of the over. He opens his body, and smashes an inside-out six over cover.


Here's Gary Naylor: "I'm in my snooker club in Tooting playing against my kids 
(start 'em early on mis-spending their youth). The subdued hues in the dusky 
light; the quiet,
interrupted only by the beautiful clink of ball on ball; and the sheer relaxed 
slowness of it all is about as far away from the bright, bright Australian sun 
and its associated, manmade hostility. The lads could do a lot worse than spend 
an afternoon or two here once they've got over the jetlag."


My snooker club did fridged Kit Kats. The best thing about it was its 24-hour 
nature, such that you could always say you were there, and your parents had no 
way of knowing whether the same was so - it was in pre-mobile days. They also 
had a generally tolerant approach to life, such that often, we were - four on a 
Sunday morning was good, as you could watch the end-of-night ruckus following 
chucking out time at the adjacent club.

11.00am GMT 

6th over: England 31-3 (Root 6, Morgan 1)

Indicate the way to my habitual abode, I'm fatigued and have a desire to 
retire. I consumed an alcoholic beverage 60 minutes ago, and it's gone right to 
my cerebrum. Wherever I may perambulate, on land or sea or atmospheric vapour, 
you will always hear my chanting this melody, indicate the way to my habitual 
abode.

10.56am GMT 

5th over: England 25-3 (Root 1, Morgan 0)

Over to you, Eoin. 

Updated at 11.00am GMT

10.55am GMT 

WICKET! Stokes c Cutting b Maxwell (England 25-3)

Intense mirth. Stokes tries to drive over the top towards long on, imparts a 
leading edge instead, and then has to watch as Maxwell, chasing back at point, 
makes a hard catch look easy on the edge of the circle. This is this.

Updated at 10.57am GMT

10.54am GMT 

5th over: England 25-2 (Stokes 5, Root 1)

Stokes is off the mark, bashing Maxwell's first delivery to square-leg for 
four. Then, after a nurdled single, Root tries to do something, and eventually 
manages to edge the fith ball behind, down on his knees playing a slog-sweep.

10.51am GMT 

4th over: England 19-2 (Stokes 0, Root 0)

Four runs and a wicket from the over. Reckon Australia might shade this. 

10.50am GMT 

WICKET! Hales c Muirhead b Coulter-Nile 6 (England 19-2)

This is not so good. Hales swipes to square-leg, and the catch is trickier 
this time, Muirhead forced to take it on the move. But this is this, so he 
does. Well taken, low and with the very tips.

Updated at 10.51am GMT

10.48am GMT 

4th over: England 19-1 (Hales 6, Stokes 0)

Hales eases an ariy drive just between mid-off and cover. You can guess the 
rest. I'm not typing it.

10.47am GMT 

3rd over: England 15-1 (Hales 2, Stokes 0)

Four leg-byes give England a friendly shove. 

10.46am GMT 

WICKET! Wright c Cutting b Starc 8 (England 15-1)

Starc's opening spell has deserved this, though this isn't a great ball. It's 
short, but Wright doesn't get enough on it, pulling almost directly to 
square-leg, where Cutting takes the catch after a short knee slide.

Updated at 10.47am GMT

10.44am GMT 

3rd over: England 11-0 (Wright 8, Hales 2)

Starc's first ball is a wide, but he's back with those that follow, a touch of 
swing forcing Hales to squirt one to point for no run, then one backward of 
point that earned one. "Frightening" was how Stuart Broad described England's 
top order.

Updated at 10.45am GMT

10.41am GMT 

2nd over: England 9-0 (Wright 8, Hales 1)

It's Coulter-Nile from the other end, and he begins with three dots, Wright 
leaving the first altogether. Why wouldn't he? The fourth ball is wide, but 
Wright misses his swing, and then flicks one behind on the leg-side, Wade 
dropping one he ought really to have held. The final delivery is also on leg, 
and this time Wright turns it away hard behind square for a one-bounce four.

10.37am GMT 

1st over: England 5-0 (Wright 4, Hales 0)

Starc's extra pace immediately finds some swing, though Wright scrambles a 
single off the first delivery. Then Hales plays the third hard, to extra cover, 
but picks out the fielder, before running one down to third man.

"Just finished reading the item in the Observer (Sport - Big homecoming) about 
England turning up at Heathrow and not expecting any red carpet or plastic 
flags", writes John Starbuck. "Well, why not? If the OBO could promote it, at 
least some of the fans could turn up to meet them, even if it's only to show 
their sympathy. We have to keep going, after all."


Exactly. It's the least we deserve. 

10.33am GMT 

We're about to restart. Goodygumdrops. 

10.27am GMT 

Well, neither side would have been expected that - and isn't that the beauty 
of this tour? Each time, just when it seems that things are ok, things are not 
ok. 160 is considered a decent total here, 180 a very good one, and when 
England took that flurry of wickets, they were handily placed. Now, they are 
unhandily placed, thanks in part to George Bailey, in part to Jade Dernbach, 
and in part to management and captaincy that just won't accept what they see.

10.21am GMT 

Kick me baby one more time. 

10.16am GMT 

Oh. 

10.14am GMT 

20th over: Australia 195-6 (Bailey 49, Wade 19)

Dernbach's first delivery is slow and wide of off, Bailey somehow dragging a 
forehand to long-on for four. Next up is a slow bouncer, and this time Bailey 
waits, steps, laughs at the tennis ball effect, and pounds flat over long-on 
off the back foot. Yes, the back foot. In comes Death Dernbach again, and 
Bailey almost crouches to get underneath this one, creaming it over wide 
long-on. Then a full, wide one, then another four over cover that's not shy of 
six. Then another four, knucked past cover, before a dive to make sure of 
contact with the final ball, two down to third man secured with a dive. That's 
26 off the over - brilliant batting from Bailey, who scored 49 off 20 in all - 
and ahuge, total for the conditions. 

Updated at 10.16am GMT

10.08am GMT 

19th over: Australia 169-6 (Bailey 23, Wade 19)

Here comes Bresnan, beginning with a slower ball that Wade hits very quickly, 
flat over midwicket for a boundary-six. But the remainder of the over is 
populated by mishits, Bresnan cleverly varying line and length as the batsmen 
move around the crease. 12 from it.

10.05am GMT 

18th over: Australia 157-6 (Bailey 20, Wade 10)

Death Dernbach is back, and exerting decent control - this track is not unlike 
those he'll be wanted for in Bangladesh, it is thought. But, after three that 
cede a single each, another tremendously wide wide. Wade is then impelled for 
force the issue, and smashes one that flies over the vertical boundary for six 
- but we're not playing 3D cricket, so when it eventually comes down, there's 
Bopara, racing to take the catch. Except he's misjudges the flight, passing the 
ball and forlornly throwing back hands as he slides. The next ball goes for 
four, obviously.

10.00am GMT 

17th over: Australia 146-6 (Bailey 18, Wade 2)

Jordan is not intimating a wicket in the same way that Broad was, but this 
over will do him, five singles and a two. He's 1-23 off four, and we'll be 
seeing plenty more of him, despite that necklace.

9.57am GMT 

16th over: Australia 139-6 (Bailey 13, Wade 0)

This might just have been the crucial over of the game - Broad really found 
the right length on this track, just back of one, and clipping the bails or 
passing over the top,.

9.55am GMT 

WICKET! Christian b Broad 0 (Australia 139-6)

Length ball, hint of movement, neck-crop interface. Ah - perhaps not, there 
was a thick inside-edge.

Updated at 9.58am GMT

9.54am GMT 

WICKET! Hodge c Dernbach b Broad 7 (Australia 139-5)

After a quiet start to his innings and the over, Hodge manouvres his legs out 
of the road to swat one towards square-leg - but his head is in the way, and he 
instead pulls his pull, straight to Dernbach at long leg.

9.52am GMT 

16th over: Australia 139-4 (Bailey 13, Hodge 7)

Did you know that Brad Hodge was old? He is! Really! Stuart Broad returns, and 
starts well.

9.51am GMT 

15th over: Australia 137-4 (Bailey 13, Hodge 5)

England have righted themselves slightly, but then Hodge inside-edges a cut 
that evades stumps and keeper before racing to the fence.

"I recall watching Graham Norton who had Robbie Williams as a guest", says 
Dean Laffan. "Robbie's wife had just had a baby, and Graham asked if he was 
there "at the business end". Robbie confirmed he was. "What was that like" 
asked Graham. After a thoughtful pause Robbie answered "Like watching your 
favourite pub burn down". I had previously thought Robbie was a twit but over 
the course of this interview I came to want to have a beer with him. In his 
second favourite pub, obviously."


That's an old line, and not his. Pleased to be of service. 

9.46am GMT 

WICKET! White c Buttler b Jordan 41 (Australia 130-4)

Jordan's first ball of his spell is leg-side, low - if White misses it, it's a 
wide. But following it to send it down to fine-leg, he instead imparts the 
faintest tickle, and is caught, to his intense consternation. He is deeply 
consternated. Well appealed from Buttler and Jordan, and well spotted by the 
umpire, because everyone else appeared to miss it.

Updated at 9.48am GMT

9.45am GMT 

14th over: Australia 130-3 (White 41, Bailey 12)

Bailey plays a dot - not on purpose, coming down the track but missing - 
before smacking four to wide midwicket. There follow two more, this time to 
long-off, and then a mosey down the track to almost flick six over long-on - 
what a shot that was.

9.42am GMT 

WICKET! Cutting c and b Root 29 (Australia 118-3)

Oooh, this is a great snaffle. Cutting makes room again by stepping to leg, 
gently this time, and times a drive intended for long-on. But Root scurries 
left and extends a hand, the ball somehow sticking.

Updated at 9.42am GMT

9.41am GMT 

14th over: Australia 118-2 (White 41, Cutting 29)

And here we are, here's Joe Root. Cutting is preparing his scissors. 

9.39am GMT 

13th over: Australia 117-2 (White 40, Cutting 29)

England need to do something here; White sees Stokes coming, withdraws legs, 
and crunches six from the first ball, high over long-off. Stokes comes back 
well with three that cost just one, before Cutting makes room to muller a 
further six over wide long-off, inside-out like a Boris Becker backhand. That's 
the 50 partnership.

9.34am GMT 

12th over: Australia 104-2 (White 33, Cutting 23)

Dernbach is one step away from ripping his shirt down the middle, such that we 
might all enjoy the beauty of his chest tatt. But, a very wide wide apart - 
down the off-side - this is a decent over, until Cutting rams the fourth ball 
to long-off where Root can't prevent the boundary, though he ought to have done.

9.30am GMT 

11th over: Australia 96-2 (White 32, Cutting 18)

White must be fancying a move now, and he swings Bresnan's first ball for four 
to midwicket before flicking four more to finest leg. And then, after a single, 
Cutting steps in then out before administering an almighty frask over cow 
corner and the longest boundary in the ground. I said 160, I meant 180.

9.26am GMT 

10th over: Australia 79-2 (White 23, Cutting 9)

Heeeeerrrrrre's Jadey! And this is a decent over, nothing obviously hittable 
and two slower ones sneaked in. Australia must be looking for about 160 here.

9.24am GMT 

9th over: Australia 74-2 (White 19, Cutting 9)

In at four is Cutting, who eases one towards Lumb - on for Morgan - at the 45. 
He dives to stop, superbly, but with one stump to aim at, misses a shy that 
would have run White out. Then, from the following and final ball, Cutting 
zetzes six more to underline the pure sitcom hilarity of it all.

9.20am GMT 

WICKET! Maxwell c Hales b Broad 14 (Australia 65-2)

Broad bowls a fuller one, and Maxwell misjudges both length and bounce, 
attempting a pull with the ball almost at his chest, swiping to Hales at 
long-on.

9.19am GMT 

9th over: Australia 65-1 (White 18, Maxwell 14)

Returning is Stuart Broad, and his first ball is a touch short, allowing 
Maxwell to wait and swivel, six dispatched over square-leg.

9.17am GMT 

8th over: Australia 58-1 (White 18, Maxwell 7)

Stokes is varying his deliveries well, first a length ball then a low, 
straight full toss. But just when this looks like a decent over, he sends down 
a leg-side wide, before Maxwell steps away from the fourth ball and bangs it 
over cover for six.

9.13am GMT 

7th over: Australia 50-1 (White 17, Maxwell 1)

Maxwell has been promoted, and is immediately off the mark with a squirt. 

9.12am GMT 

WICKET! Finch c Broad b Bresnan 30 (Australia 48-1)

Finch miscues a pull, properly this time, and it struggles directly to Broad 
at midwicket.

9.11am GMT 

7th over: Australia 48-0 (White 16, Finch 30)

Finch is into this now, and waits again - for Bresnan, this time - clattering 
his second ball to long-off. Hales is there, but stretching and jumping, so 
can't get the angle to divert it back to then take the catch inside the rope, 
or just divert it back.

Updated at 9.14am GMT

9.08am GMT 

6th over: Australia 41-0 (White 15, Finch 24)

Stokes into the attack and begins well, with a length on off-stump, but then 
Finch mooches down to the second and with no apparent effort lifts six over 
deep backward square. Then, from the penultimate ball, Finch waits for it, 
still, and then spanks it over long-on.

Playground violence:

Donkey bite - snatching the skin of the inside thigh and squeezing hard.

Bicycle ride: taking the sideboard hair, pulling it hard, and twizzling it 
around.

Poll job: a birthday treat. Beatings are administered until the subject is 
horizontal, then a goalpost or similar vertical piece of metal is charged at.

Bacon slice: whipping two fingers down the bottom when confronted with speedos 
or similar. Take care when performing this act on a wrestler, and be sure to 
ensure there is no adjacent side room into which you might be taken and 
threatened.

Updated at 9.14am GMT

9.03am GMT 

5th over: Australia 27-0 (White 15, Finch 10)

Bresnan replaces Broad and his second ball is clumped hard by Finch, making 
room - to Jordan, at short midwicket. It's come off the toe of the bat, so not 
all that hard, but is dropped anyway - because why not? - bursting the hands. 
Bresnan then comes back well, a heavy one beating the bat and smacking the meat 
of the thigh like a leather donkey bite, a real sair yin. That's got to be 
better than a wicket. Good over.

9.00am GMT 

4th over: Australia 24-0 (White 14, Finch 8)

Jordan dashes in and lets a short one go, slammed off the notmiddle by Finch 
for four to square-leg - eventually. They do not appear to have fully resolved 
the long jump pit that once inhabited the outfield. The next ball is fuller, 
Finch making room to cut and missing, then fuller again, pulled for one. It's 
impossible not to admire the manner in which Jordan's jib is coutured - he sees 
Finch backing away to leg and has the nads and nous to spear one in at him. He 
looks not just a limited overs type, but a Test Bowler.

8.55am GMT 

3rd over: Australia 17-0 (White 14, Finch 2)

White has had enough, and when Broad drops a fraction short, he waits, 
extends, and eases four down the ground. Very nice. Isn't he clever. Broad then 
returns with a cross-seamer, but the bounce is tennisbally, and summarily 
dispatched over midwicket's head for four. But he remains uncowed, adjusting 
his aim to follow the man before finishing with one that lifts and nips, that 
has White shying away.

2nd over: Australia 7-0 (White 5, Finch 1)

Jordan takes the new ball from the other end, and begins with a leg-side wide. 
But he's tight enough subsequently with two dots preceding a two, turned behind 
square. Then, a short ball elicits a false pull, which drops just short of 
Dernbach. Good start from England. Don't laugh.

"Not sure it is quite the worst tour of all time, although it has certainly 
posted a competitive total in that event," reckons John Cullen. "At least we 
won a one day match this time


In 1990-91 legend had it that New Zealand had planned to be knocked out in the 
group stages of the World Series Cup and had to cancel all their holidays when 
England proved so incompetent that it ended up as a NZ vs Aus final. And then 
four years later the Australia A team reached the final ahead of England, so it 
was Aus vs Aus A in the final."


In 90-91, England didn't lose - or get obliterated in all five Tests, won two 
one-dayers, and there was no T20 in which to become annihilated. That Australia 
A side were good.

8.45am GMT 

1st over: Australia 3-0 (White 2, Finch 1)

It looks very nice in the Olympic Stadium, people enjoying themselves and 
stuff; I wonder if there are more people enjoying themselves there than in the 
whole of England. Though, on the way here, I drove past people still pretending 
to at a local night spot. Anyway, Broad starts well, with two straight dots 
before three singles abutted by a further straight dot. Well bowled - though 
Australia's serenity is unnerving.

8.41am GMT 

Stuart Broad is rehearsing - he'll open, it would seem, with White taking 
strike.

8.39am GMT 

Here come the umpires, followed by England - down red carpet - followed by 
jeers. Who decided that carpet should be walked down, and that it should be 
red? What would happen if it was green, or not there?

8.37am GMT 

Dearie me, This haitch pee advert thinks it's good ole 1995. It's just so damn 
bantorious.

8.34am GMT 

Nick Knight is putting on a stern, sage face to say that Eoin Morgan should 
captain both one-day and T20 sides. I agree - and I'm close to wondering if 
they couldn't give the Test captaincy, too. I know, I know, but they need to do 
something, and they're not exactly replete with options.

8.32am GMT 

"Hello" says Lanky. "The England team selection committee working overtime to 
bring us ...... Dernbach????? Root???????????? drop Lumb????????? No spinner 
because they'll get hit out of the ground???????????? What absolute and utter 
rubbish. Don't think they win the Ashes like this?????????????????????"

I'm surprised Dernbach's inclusion was allocated fewest question marks. I can 
see why they've left out Lumb, though - he's not batted well, and someone had 
to drop out to get Stokes in. He's batting at three, by the way.

8.27am GMT 

So England haven't picked a specialist spinner. It is thought that this is 
because the straight boundaries are short, but that really is a gamble. I 
wonder whether they'll end up forcing Root to chuck down a few.

8.19am GMT 

Your teams in full:

Australia: Finch, White, Maxwell, Bailey, Hodge, Wade, Christian, Cutting, 
Starc, Coulter-Nile, Muirhead.


England: Hales, Wright, Stokes, Root, Morgan, Buttler, Bopara, Bresnan, 
Jordan, Broad, Dernbach.


8.15am GMT 

Jade Dernbach. 

8.15am GMT 

Australia make two changes. Christian and Cutting are in, Hazlewood and Lynn - 
slightly curiously - are out. England also make two changes, and not before 
time: Stokes is in for "Lumby", and will bat three, with Wright opening, while 
Jordan replaces Tredwell.

8.12am GMT 

Stuart Broad calls tails and it's heads. George Bailey will bat, obviously. 

8.11am GMT 

Has this been the worst tour of all-time? It's certainly the worst that I can 
remember, worse than the 90s kickings. You can only admire its intensity.

8.03am GMT 

Preamble. Childbirth is a funny thing. Did I say funny? I meant appalling and 
harrowing. That's the OBO, treading on your dreams, one by one. Speaking 
plainly, there's very little to separate it from torture, apart from one thing: 
once it's over, it's over. Now, this piece of information really is a favour 
for anyone planning on taking a spectator's role, because it reassures you that 
when you're utterly consumed with devastation at the horrific, staggering, 
chilling pain being visited upon the person you love most in the world, there's 
no need to be also consumed with worry at how an earth the psychological damage 
might heal. Because, somehow, the nature that couldn't make it not hurt is able 
to make it stop as soon as it stops. Stop. Over. Smiles. Rapture. Love.


England's cricketers have been in Australia for roughly a third of a year. 
It's been funny, in an appalling and harrowing kind of way. It's been a 
sporting and psychological torture. Once it's over, it's not over; it might 
never be over. Oh.


Alternative preamble. One more day of school, one more day of sorrow, one more 
day in this old dump, and we'll be free tomorrow!
