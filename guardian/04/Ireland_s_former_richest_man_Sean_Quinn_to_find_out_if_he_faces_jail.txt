Ireland's one-time richest man Sean Quinn is in court where he will find out 
if a state-owned bank wants him jailed.

The former billionaire's son, Sean Junior, will also hear how the Irish Bank 
Resolution Corporation (IBRC) wants the courts to deal with him.

Earlier in the summer both father and son, along with Sean Quinn's nephew 
Peter Darragh Quinn, were found guilty of contempt of court for moving assets 
which the IBRC wanted to seize out of the state.

Sean Quinn Junior was jailed for three months while his cousin fled to Northern
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> where he remains and cannot 
be extradited back to Dublin.

The judge in the case back in June adjourned the punishment for Sean Quinn 
Senior. The Quinn family has admitted it put millions worth of property and 
other assets beyond the reach of the formerAnglo Irish Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-irish-bank>, which is now owned by 
the taxpayer.

The bank says it has security over the assets and that the family owes it 
€2.8bn (£2.3bn). The family is alleging the bulk of the loans are tainted with 
illegality as they are linked to a share support scheme for Anglo Irish Bank.

The case centres on hundreds of millions of euros the Quinn family borrowed 
from Anglo Irish Bank to fund a global property portfolio.
