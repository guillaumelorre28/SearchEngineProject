Barclays <https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> could axe thousands 
more jobs, mainly at its investment banking arm, under a strategic review which 
will report next month.

Chief executive Antony Jenkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/antony-jenkins> wrote to all group staff 
on Thursday morning as the bank announced that the review would be published on 
8 May, two days after its latest trading update. Jenkins has embarked on the 
third review of the investment bank in as many years in response to pressure to 
cut costs and improve returns.

Analysts predict that this may lead to a cut in the division's size of up to 
20%. This would equate to about 5,000 jobs being lost out of 26,000 and could 
strip out about £900m in annual costs.

Jenkins said the review would answer questions including how best to simplify 
the bank's operations and which of its businesses it should "focus on and 
invest in".

He warned staff that regulation and the wider economy were having a 
"significant effect on some parts of our business which we need to address 
proactively and decisively". Referring to the investment bank, he added: "The 
future for Barclays will be as a strong, focused, international bank. And the 
investment bank will continue to be part of that mix."

Earlier this week, Barclays announced a new director in charge of setting pay 
and bonuses as it moved to defuse a potential shareholder revolt at next week's 
annual general meeting. The bank, which paid out £2.38 billion in bonuses last 
year, said Crawford Gillies had been appointed to its board and will succeed 
Sir John Sunderland as chairman of its remuneration committee.
