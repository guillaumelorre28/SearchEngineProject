Train and bus passengers are used to delays, and now Arriva shareholders are 
facing one too.

The proposed timetable for the company's Â£1.6bn takeover by Deutsche Bahn has 
slipped by a week, following discussions with the European Commission. 
Notification of the deal will now be submitted on 22 June, and the scheme of 
arrangement is expected to become effective - once everything is agreed by all 
necessary parties - on 27 rather than 20 August.

And the company warns the dates could still change, although Deutsche Bahn 
said it was confident that competition conditions will be satisfied "in a 
timely manner." The combined company would be Europe's number one passenger 
transport company, with more than 3bn bus and rail journeys a year.Arriva
