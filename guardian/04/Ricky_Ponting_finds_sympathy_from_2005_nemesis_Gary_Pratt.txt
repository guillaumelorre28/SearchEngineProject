Gary Pratt, the supersub who briefly shot to fame when he ran out Ricky Ponting
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ricky-ponting> at Trent Bridge four years 
ago, today expressed sympathy for the Australia captain after his final innings 
of the 2009 series met with an eerily similar fate yesterday.

Ponting had reached 66, and Australia 217 for two, when he was run out at the 
striker's end by Andrew Flintoff's howitzer from mid-on, leaving Pratt to 
commiserate with a player who is now in danger of being remembered in this 
country for two high-profile but futile lunges for the crease.

"I did feel sorry for him actually," said Pratt, who was batting for 
Cumberland in the Minor Counties championship against Bedfordshire at Luton at 
the time of latest Ponting's dismissal. "Fred catches well but he's not the 
best fielder in the world, so you wouldn't have expected a direct hit. It's 
just a good job Ricky Ponting can't run properly because otherwise we might 
have been looking at a slightly different result."

Pratt became a symbol of Australia's irritation with England's policy in 2005 
of using substitute fielders to give their fast bowlers a breather, but he has 
admired Ponting ever since the Australian signed a photo of the two men 
following their fateful meeting in Nottingham.

"He's one of the all-time greats," said Pratt. "But he was let down by his 
team and now he's become the first Aussie [captain] to lose two series here for 
a very long time. I reckon he might come back in four years' time to have one 
last crack."

But before then, Pratt is hopeful the Barmy Army repeat their attempts in 
2006-07 to fly him out for the Ashes in Australia next year â€“ a stunt that 
failed at the last minute because of a lack of sponsorship.
