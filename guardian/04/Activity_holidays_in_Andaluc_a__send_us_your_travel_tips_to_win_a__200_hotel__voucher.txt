This week we want to hear about the best activity holidays and trips in 
Andalucía <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/andalucia>. Have you found some 
great mountain biking or walking trails, or climbing centres in the Sierra 
Nevada? Perhaps you’ve enjoyed watersports along the Mediterranean or Atlantic 
coastline – or even something more extreme?

Send us your tip – including as much detail as possible (including websites 
and prices if possible) and why the place is special – and you could win a £200 
hotel voucher. Contribute viaGuardianWitness <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/>.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromHotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>, allowing you stay in over 260,000 
places worldwide. Submit your tips by clicking on the blue button and using the 
text tab. Try to include as much detail as possible (location, any website 
addresses, prices etc) and feel free to add a photo if you own the copyright to 
it –but it’s the text we’ll be judging! 


Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
