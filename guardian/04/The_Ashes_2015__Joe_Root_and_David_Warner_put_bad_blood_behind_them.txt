Joe Root and David Warner <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-warner> 
appear finally to have put their altercation in a Birmingham bar behind them in 
the wake of England’s Ashes victory over Australia.

Warner hit the headlines in June 2013 after making an “unprovoked physical 
attack” on Root in a Walkabout bar

 followingEngland’s 48-run win over Australia in the Champions Trophy at 
Edgbaston

.

The Australia opener, who apologised for aiming a punch at Root but was 
subsequently suspended by Cricket Australia, revealed the reasons behind the 
fracas in an interview in July of this year and his commentsdrew a prompt 
response from an unimpressed Root

.

The England batsman said: “Disappointing to have my character questioned - 
those who know me realise how ridiculous Warner’s excuse for hitting me sounds 
but that’s his choice to try and justify his actions.”

However, a few hours after Australia won by an innings and 46 runs at The Kia 
Oval

 on Sunday to reduce the margin of England’s Ashes triumph to 3-2, the pair 
appeared well reconciled.
