The brutalist style that Peter and Alison Smithson pioneered was radical, 
practical and beautiful. To their enemies – among whom Prince Charles holds the 
megaphone – their uncompromising concrete boxes are the greatest sins that have 
ever been committed in a planning office.

This war broke out as soon as the Smithsons' first building was completed in 
1954. At the time, the blunt rectangularity of Hunstanton school, with all 
its glass and steel, was profoundly shocking. And worse (or better) was to 
come, in the form of the Economist building and then the Robin Hood Gardens 
housing estate, both in London.

Though the couple's idealism was obvious, they assiduously researched the 
habits of the people they designed for. Indeed, they saw their residential work 
as the compassionate reaction to Le Corbusier's huge towers. What they were 
building, as the doomed phrase had it, would be "streets in the sky".

Sadly, practice did not follow theory. Alison died in 1993, and Peter in 2003, 
but both lived long enough to see themselves ridiculed, especially for the 
failure of Robin Hood Gardens to realise their expectations. To many, their 
career now stands as a parable of the way that naive optimism can condemn the 
poor to squalor. Yet to others, including Richard Rogers, the story that Robin 
Hood Gardens tells is of a brilliant design being neglected and mismanaged. 
Tower Hamlets council plans to knock it down.
