Iran plans to buy 114 aircraft from the European company Airbus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/airbus> by March, and is looking for 
other deals, senior Iranian officials said on Sunday as their country emerges 
from sanctions and international isolation.

 The republic could need 500 new planes over the next three years, lawmaker 
Mahdi Hashemi, the chairman of the parliament’s development commission, said at 
Tehran’s first major post-sanctions gathering of global business people.

The transport minister, Abbas Akhoondi, told journalists Tehran would discuss 
details with Airbus next week and was also interested in negotiating with the 
US plane makerBoeing <https://www.theguardian.com/business/boeing> for aircraft.

 Tehran has long said it will need to revamp an ageing fleet, hit by a 
shortage of parts because of trade bans imposed by Washington and other western 
powers.

 Its fleet has suffered several fatal crashes in recent years.

Hashemi said Iran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> could place an 
order in the next two months, confirming plans announced earlier this month 
ahead of a nuclear sanctions deal.

 He also urged international investors and airlines to move quickly into Iran 
after the lifting of sanctions.

 “Come with your proposals. We would like to have new contracts and serve them 
immediately and make up for the losses that we suffered from in the past,” 
Hashemi said.

 Iran emerged from years of economic isolation when world powers last week 
lifted crippling sanctions against it in return for Tehran complying with a 
deal to curb its nuclear ambitions.

 The deal also released billions of dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets and 
opened the door for global companies that had been barred from doing business 
in Iran.
