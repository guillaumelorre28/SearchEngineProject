Alexa Chung is already Marks & Spencer’s unofficial fashion fairy godmother. 
This time last year, she wore the brand’s camel-coloured, 1970s-style suede 
skirt, anda million style blogs swooned

. Now the model and retailer are making it official.

Here’s what we know: Chung is curating a 31-piece collection of womenswear 
based on pieces from the retailer’s archive. Named Archive by Alexa, it will 
launch in April.

How will it look? We have but three photographs so far, and here is what we 
can extrapolate.

From the first – styled by Chung herself – we can report that there will be at 
least one pie-crust collar. Which feels very British and very Diana, Princess 
of Wales and also very 2016, all messy-haired, reclined haughtiness. The wooden 
walls are a nice touch, too, giving the shot an arch 1970s flavour.

The other photographs show Chung rifling through the archives. Even this looks 
stylish – beautifully captured in black and white, as though Chung is in the 
bowels of a historic Parisian atelier, rather than a storage unit in Leeds.

. And more potential good news from the final shot for fans of flat shoes: 
she’s looking at a picture of a loafer.

More when we get it. But, given Chung’s aptitude for predicting trends, it 
seems a given that this is going to be brilliant.
