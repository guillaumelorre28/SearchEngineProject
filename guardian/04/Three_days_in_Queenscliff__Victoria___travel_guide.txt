When it comes to packing for a long weekend on the Bellarine, the most 
important thing to remember might not fit easily in the back of your car. 
Forget to bring your bike and you’re missing the real joy of a break on this 
beautiful peninsula.

 Follow the rail trail alongside the vintage train track to Queenscliff.

You don’t really need to bring the car at all: hop on the train from Melbourne 
and then pick up the Bellarine Rail Trail at South Geelong for a 32km ride down 
to Queenscliff, a genteel seaside town with broad streets, weatherboard houses 
and stunning surroundings. The second half of the trail, from Drysdale onwards, 
runs alongside a vintage train track and is largely flat with just a couple of 
inclines between Geelong and Queenscliff. I set out to ride just the second 
half as a round trip and found myself wishing I’d committed to the whole thing. 
There are views across fields and water, everything is well signposted and 
there’s plenty of shade if the sun is out. Hanging over a gate and drinking in 
the surroundings, it could for a moment be 1879, the year the line opened. When 
the train comes puffing round the corner towards you, a great plume of smoke 
rising from its chimney, it's pretty special.

There’s another track that takes you from Queenscliff to Port Lonsdale 
<http://www.weekendnotes.com/queenscliff-to-point-lonsdale-walking-trail/>, a 
quintessential seaside village with its beach and lighthouse. At 5.5km, it’s a 
great length for a walk.

The rail trail is perfect for kids or riders keen to keep away from traffic – 
although there are a few junctions to cross along the way – but if you want to 
add other trips to your weekend, you’ll need toventure on to the roads 
<http://theclimbingcyclist.com/episode-1-the-great-ocean-road-ride/>. The 
coastal rides here are stunning with relatively few climbs. Takethe Great Ocean 
Road 
<http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Activities-and-attractions/Outdoor-activities/Cycling>
 past Port Lonsdale and Ocean Grove to Barwon Heads and you’ll be in good 
company: this picturesque town on the wateris home to the Tour de France winner

 The Bellarine Railway. Photograph: Vicky Frost for the Guardian 
The Bellarine Railway <http://bellarinerailway.com.au/events/timetable> is a 
vintage steam train that operates along 16km of track between Queenscliff and 
Drysdale on weekends and during holidays. A trip will cost you $20/$15 single 
and $30/$20 return, with trains running from late morning to early afternoon at 
the weekends. (It also takes bikes, if you need a lift back from the trail.)

Alternatively you can clamber aboard on a Saturday evening when it turns into 
the Blues Train <http://www.thebluestrain.com.au/>, with four carriages 
featuring four different bands. As passengers make their way up the line and 
back, they swap carriages at each station – by the time you return to 
Queenscliff, you'll have experienced four intimate gigs upon a slowly puffing 
steam train laden with booze and revellers. Some carriages have dancefloors, 
others are more sedate affairs.

 The Blues Train: four carriages of music for the evening. Photograph: Vicky 
Frost for the Guardian 
I had a couple of magical moments on board: a young performer who played his 
guitar flat, with a slide, was raw and compelling – the sun was setting out the 
window behind him as we sat on the edges of our vintage seats. But it does all 
head dangerously towards drunk wedding territory as the night progresses – and 
worse, drunk wedding with a moving dancefloor and no way of leaving. But if the 
blues is your thing, buy tickets with a group of friends and get stuck right in.

 Berry nice: fruit picking at Tuckerberry Hill. Photograph: Vicky Frost for the 
Guardian 
Cycle out to Drysdale, then head for Tuckerberry Hill 
<https://www.facebook.com/TuckerberryHill>, where armed with a bucket or two, 
you can pick your own fruit: when I was there blueberries and strawberries were 
in season, while figs and lemons were starting to ripen. The farm is open all 
year. It’s a lovely place to wander and gently gather, the fruit’s reasonably 
priced and there’s a good produce shop on site too, stuffed with delicious 
veggies for if you’re self-catering or heading back to the city. A café serves 
coffee and lunch – not all of it with a berry twist.

Barwon Heads has more than its fair share of charming home and womenswear 
boutiques, with just enough variety between them. I likeKiitos 
<http://kiitos.com.au/> which stocks Marimekko – lots of fabric, homewares and 
clothing – and Salt Water sandals. The village is a good place for an amble and 
a browse, with plenty of spots for coffee and a something and, of course, 
incredible walks close by.

Decidedly less spendy but equally enticing is Queenscliff’s fantastic 
secondhand book shop. Barwon Booksellers is housed in a heritage-listed former 
Wesleyan church and has an excellent selection of reasonably priced titles. It 
took quite a lot of willpower to walk away with just two books.

 Piknik: grab some of their highly regarded preserves while enjoying breakfast. 
Photograph: Vicky Frost for the Guardian 
On a weekend morning you’ll spot Piknik – a garage in Swan Bay 
<http://piknik.com.au/contact.html> now transformed into a friendly cafe – by 
the crowds descending for a brilliant breakfast. Scrambled eggs are creamy and 
moreish, mushrooms flavourful and the coffee first rate. The team behind the 
cafe began by selling preserves made from foraged fruit; you can find pots of 
the good stuff available to buy in the café. It’s got a charming feel to it – 
this is not a contrived pop-up venture but a really smart use of an empty local 
building by a great local business. I could have happily settled down with a 
paper post-breakfast and stayed for lunch.

Breakfast is also delicious at Athelstane House 
<http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g552246-d293094-Reviews-Athelstane_House-Queenscliff_Victoria.html>
, a charming B&B in Queenscliff with a lovely, relaxed feel. Pancakes, stacked 
with banana, bacon and maple syrup, are not the most health-giving start to the 
day ... but they are the tastiest.

The bar menu is solid at the the Vue Grand Hotel – and the posh menu

recommended by others – but the real reason for heading here for lunch can be 
found out the back of the hotel, where you’ll step into the most idyllic 
courtyard, all verdant greenery and old, elegant masonry. Take a book, order a 
glass of something delicious and settle into a shady spot for the afternoon – 
perhaps stirring yourself for a wander down to the road to the Queenscliff
