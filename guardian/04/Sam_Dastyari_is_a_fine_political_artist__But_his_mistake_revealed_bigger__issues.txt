Australia has just witnessed a compelling piece of work by the finest 
political performance artist of this generation.

The man who brought corporate tax evasion to life by getting his daughter to 
share her lollies

<http://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/news/senator-sam-dastyaris-guide-to-halal-snack-packs-20160713-gq4whn>
, took his art a step further last week by making a meal of himself.

Immersing himself in the role of the Manchurian candidate, Sam Dastyari took a 
routine personal debt and brought it to life with a cascade of interlocking 
dramas that speak to our nation’s greatest geopolitical challenge.

From the funding of the major parties, to the influence of private education 
providers, to the representation ofAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics> in the Chinese 
language press, to the inevitable yet unresolved need to confront expansion in 
the South China Sea, Dastyari wove complex themes into a simple narrative.

With an uncanny sense of timing, Dastyari launched his show as the prime 
minister travelled to the G20 summit in Hangzhou, ensuring his work would be 
appreciated on a global stage.

He then subverted the rituals of the political scandal, throwing himself at 
the mercy of a press pack with a compelling if repetitive monologue before 
tapping the mat and departing the stage.

Like Leigh Sales, the audience was simply left to ask themselves the question, 
“why”?

As with all great artists, Dastyari’s work resonates because it speaks to 
larger truths.

The first and most obvious of these is that the standing of politicians is so 
low that this bizarre plot line was seen by the audience as credible.

As we discussed in last week’s column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/turnbulls-government-is-more-unstable-than-gillards-at-least-labor-had-policy-consensus>
, political parties are the least trusted institution in a list of institutions
whose level of trust is on the wane 
<http://www.essentialvision.com.au/trust-in-institutions-8>. 

The second truth – as this week’s Essential Report shows – is that we are 
uncomfortable with the idea of donations to political parties, especially from 
foreign companies.
Should political parties be allowed to receive donations from each of the 
following?

Donations from foreign companies are seen as even less palatable than 
donations from property developers, a section of corporate Australia that has 
been the centre of its own political dramas in the past.

In fact, this list shows a deep-seated suspicion in the financial involvement 
of any organisation in the workings of political parties.

Even unions, the institutional bedrock of Dastyari’s own political party, are 
not regarded as fitting benefactors; and despite the constraints of a high 
court ruling, this act has brought their involvement back onto the political 
stage.

In Dastyari’s skilful hands these twin strands – the distrust in donations and 
the lack of trust in political parties – are woven into the one tragic tapestry.

As a Labor former state secretary, Dastyari had lived the ongoing drama of 
raising funds from corporate donors. But only he was prepared to take the story 
a step further and segue into a story of personal debt.

If this had been all Dastyari brought to the stage it would have been merely 
interesting. What allowed it to transcend cliché was the final thread – our 
vexed relationship with the rising power of China.

As the below table shows, we recognise the importance of China – it stands 
alongside the US as the country with whom Australians want to keep tight.
How important is it for Australia to have a close relationship with the 
following nations?

Dastyari jolts us because it reminds us that at some point in the future we 
may have to choose between these two global powers, the one that has been our 
long-term ally, the other positioned as our meal ticket for the 21st century.

Yes, businesses with Chinese connections poured more than $5m into the major 
political parties between 2013 and 201

5, but this has been met with silence from the beneficiaries and indifference 
from everyone else.

It takes one man’s story to bring the issue to life. Now it has, Australian 
politics is unlikely to ever be the same.

This was a bold and brave performance from Sam Dastyari. The public will wait 
with anticipation for what comes next from “the junior senator from NSW”.
