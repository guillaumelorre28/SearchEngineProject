Kevin Pietersen <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen> has 
received an unreserved apology from Specsavers after it suggested in an advert 
that he may have tampered with his bat during the row over Hot Spot during the 
Ashes series last summer.

Pietersen found himself at the centre of the controversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/07/ashes-hot-spot-silicone-tape-claims>
, which blew up during the fourth Ashes Test in Durham during August, when the 
Australian network Channel 9 used images of his dismissal in the third Test to 
illustrate a report claiming that players may be using silicone tape on their 
bats to prevent edges showing up on Hot Spot.

The England and Wales Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 
Board immediately let it be known that it would be taking legal action against 
Channel 9, and has since received an apology. But Specsavers, the high street 
optician chain, repeated the suggestion in a variation of its advertising 
campaign.

It has now issued apologies on its Twitter and Facebook accounts, with 
Pietersen retweeting the former to his 1.3m followers. "Sorry Kevin Pietersen 
for distress caused by our  <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SHGTS&src=hash>ad 
which suggested he tampered with his bat in the Ashes. We accept this isn't 
so," the apology reads.

On the Facebook site, the company has posted: "We apologise unreservedly for 
any distress and embarrassment caused by our recent advert which suggested that 
Kevin Pietersen may have tampered with his bat during the 2013 Ashes series. 
This was not our intention and we accept that this allegation is untrue. We 
have removed the advert from circulation."
