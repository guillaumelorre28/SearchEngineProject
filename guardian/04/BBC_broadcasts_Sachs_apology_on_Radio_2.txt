A second BBC Radio 2 executive has resigned in the wake of the Andrew Sachs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/andrew-sachs> affair, it emerged 
yesterday, as the corporation prepared to broadcast a strongly-worded apology 
on the station today.

The resignation of Dave Barber, head of specialist music and compliance, was 
announced in an internal email from the station's acting controller, Lewis 
Carnie.

It comes after the Radio 2 controller, Lesley Douglas, resigned last week, 
taking responsibility for the channel broadcasting Russell Brand andJonathan 
Ross <https://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross> leaving obscene 
telephone messages on the answerphone of actor Andrew Sachs.

Earlier this week the BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> director 
general, Mark Thompson, confirmed to the corporation's in-house magazine Ariel 
that Douglas had been aware of the content of the broadcast before it was aired.

News of Barber's resignation came as the BBC said it would broadcast an 
apology on Radio 2 this morning and again this evening to the former Fawlty 
Towers actor Sachs, his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, and licence fee payers 
for a "grossly offensive and unacceptable" intrusion that should "never have 
been recorded or broadcast". The apology was ordered by the BBC Trust after 
Ross and Brand made the obscene calls on Brand'sRadio 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-2> show, broadcast on October 18.

The programme, and media coverage of it, generated some 42,000 complaints. 
Brand, who had had a short relationship with Baillie, resigned from the BBC and 
Ross, the corporation's star presenter, was suspended without pay for 12 weeks.
