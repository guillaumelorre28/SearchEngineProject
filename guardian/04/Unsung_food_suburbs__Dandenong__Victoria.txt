Thirty kilometres south-east of Melbourne's city centre, Dandenong’s rough 
edges are being smoothed by a $290m urban renewal project. The suburb is a 
cultural melting pot, with two-thirds of residents born overseas (twice the 
national average) and 71% speaking a language other than English. As a 
consequence it's a treasure trove of food, with its own Little India and Afghan 
Bazaar precincts – plus cafes and restaurants offering cuisines that include 
Ethiopian, West African, Sri Lankan, Lebanese, Turkish, Polish, Balkan and 
Mauritian.

Bikaner Sweet and Curry Cafe

Located smack bang in the middle of Little India, Bikaner serves northern 
Indian food with a good selection of authentic curries and tandoori dishes. But 
what makes this place stand out from the other cafes lining Foster Street is 
its huge selection of brightly coloured Indian sweets. Made by hand by the 
owner's father, there are more than 30 varieties to choose from, including 
gulab jamun <http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/25056/gulab+jamun> and several 
kinds of Bengali cham-cham 
<http://www.khanapakana.com/recipe/91172239-9afb-4c87-b0f5-17204d341b6a/cham-cham>
, semolina-based laddoo and burfi made with condensed milk.

 Dosa from Indian vegetarian cafe Lakshmi Vilas. Photograph: Claire Davie 
Lakshmi Vilas is a vegetarian cafe, serving mainly southern Indian food 
(including dosas, iddlis 
<http://domesticdevotion108.blogspot.com.au/2009/05/iddlis.html>, sambar and 
vadas <http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/medu-vada-recipe-medu-vada/>) with a 
smattering of northern dishes, at ridiculously cheap prices. The convention 
here is to eat with your hands, with a basin conveniently located in the corner 
of the cafe for you to wash your hands before and after your meal. The dosas 
are particularly good, full of flavour without being too oily: don't leave 
without trying the masala dosa.

Afghan Pamir Restaurant <http://www.pamirrestaurant.com.au/>

Pamir Restaurant is a Dandenong institution, hidden up a nondescript staircase 
and richly furnished with marble tabletops, carved wooden chairs, hand-woven 
rugs and traditional Afghan costumes on the walls. The Uzbek and Afghan cuisine 
is a bit pricier than at some Dandenong restaurants, but the $35 a head banquet 
will more than satisfy. The chicken and lamb backstrap skewers cooked over 
charcoal are a menu highlight, and on Saturday nights there's live music and 
entertainment.

At the other end of the spectrum decor-wise from Pamir, Afghan Tasty Food is 
brightly lit, no-frills cafe that lives up to its name. The genial owner, 
Muheen Bahrami, bakes all his Afghan breads in-house and supplies them to a 
number of supermarkets. In addition to the usual kebab and rice dishes, Afghan 
Tasty also has excellentmantu dumplings

There's a pocket of Polish food in Dandenong in amongst the Indian and Afghan 
cafes. Just down the road from the more formal Polish restaurant Kluska sits 
Polish Rye Crust Bakery, run by a very friendly couple, Hanna and Andrew 
Lipiszko. As well as selling many kinds of Eastern European breads, bagels and 
pastries (including a delicious “cheesecake” made with quark in a brioche bun), 
the bakery also serves borscht, pierogi, cabbage rolls and goulash.
