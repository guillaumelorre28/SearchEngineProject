Kiersten White seemed to pour her mind into And I Darken. The words and plot 
flow as though they didn’t even need editing!

I find each new person introduced in this book extremely charismatic – whether 
they were written to be daunting and fearless or sweet and sappy. Every 
personality is unique and realistic. I wouldn’t be surprised if the characters 
were at least partly based on real people.

The thing I mainly enjoyed about this book was that the author shared her 
views on important political issues through the voices of her characters. 
Matters discussed in it include feminism and the social acceptability of 
homosexuality. What is most surprising is that it deals with modern issues, yet 
it’s set over six hundred years ago. The clever subtleness of these things hint 
at a story much larger and with many more opinions than we are being told.

In conclusion; I need a sequel! There are too many things left unexplained, 
and too many characters with a completely different view on the story. I have a 
feeling this will be hugely successful – it always will be for me.
