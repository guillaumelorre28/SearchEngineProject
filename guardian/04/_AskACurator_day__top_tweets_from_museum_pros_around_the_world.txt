The Wiener Library’s <http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/> digital curator 
revealed the best and worst aspects of the job:
The Wiener Library (@wienerlibrary) 
@Katy_Heritage <https://twitter.com/Katy_Heritage> As Digital Curator, the 
best bits: innovation, interconnectivity, inclusion. Worst bits: costs, time, 
patience.#AskACurator <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskACurator?src=hash>

experience placements:
HistoricRoyalPalaces (@HRP_palaces) 
@CarolineT1813 <https://twitter.com/CarolineT1813> Local museums can give you 
a range of experience. If your university has a museum, that's a good idea too.

theMind Museum <http://www.themindmuseum.org/>, based in the Philippines, 
revealed that visiting kids just love touching dinosaur poo (don’t we all?):

We vote the Dino Poop Fossil. Kids love touching it! @jennifuchs

visitors this tip for making the most out of the objects and artefacts you see 
on your travels:

@DavidDmshepherd <https://twitter.com/DavidDmshepherd> @britishmuseum

looking at to yourself, you'll see so much more#AskACurator

Megan Sweeney asked <https://twitter.com/msweeney74/status/644138749102657536>
: is it better to attract mass audiences through gimmicks or have fewer, more 
intellectually curious visitors?

The Dinosaur Journey Museum

@msweeney74 <https://twitter.com/msweeney74> @AskACurator 
<https://twitter.com/AskACurator> Need balance. Too high brow & risk too few 
visitors to pay bills. All flash & no substance = carnival side show.

Of course, the only real reason anyone was following the hashtag was to find 
out the answer to the following question, posed by@AbeforeE 
<https://twitter.com/AbeforeE>: who can consume the most cake – curators, 
archivists or librarians?
Erica McAlister (@flygirlNHM) 
@AbeforeE <https://twitter.com/AbeforeE> Entomology curators. piles of them 
(cakes that is) everyday. 11am and 3:30pm. Dont expect emails to be answered
