Guardian legal reporters Maya Wolfe-Robinson and Owen Bowcott have been named 
as joint winners of the Bar Council's annual Legal Reporting Award.

Their article "The global fight to end capital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/global-fight-end-capital-punishment>
" was published in G2 this May and explored the relationship between the UK's 
privy council, which remains the final court of appeal for many former British 
colonies, and the death penalty. The story was the winner in the written 
category.

The judges said: "The article's powerful message reminds readers not only of 
sentencing policies abolished in the UK which other countries still exercise, 
but also of the importance of the UK's role internationally in ensuring that 
the right to a fair trial is applied in practice, and in promoting and 
enforcing the rule of law." The award was presented by the attorney general, 
Dominic Grieve QC.

awareness of legal issues.
