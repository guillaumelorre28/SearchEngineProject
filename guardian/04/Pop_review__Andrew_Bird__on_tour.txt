A classically trained musician who makes self-consciously wordy music, Bird is 
among those American musicians who are almost like Victorian children - polite 
to the point of being seen, and very nearly, not heard. The very opposite of 
the "complaint rock" that one is supposed to have once blasted from college 
dorms, Bird's music is melodic, accomplished and - above all - cheerfully 
placid. It's telling that the signature sound of his current album Noble Beast 
is the kind of chirpy whistle chiefly found emanating from the lips of milkmen 
in television advertisements. Deathless rock'n'roll it's not, then. But as 
performed by skilled, often charming, practitioners like Bird, it's far from 
going quietly: along with fellow travellers like Sufjan Stephens and the 
Decemberists,Andrew Bird <https://www.theguardian.com/music/andrew-bird> is 
effecting a quiet revolution.
