Sir Paul McCartney, Rufus Wainwright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/rufus-wainwright> and Irma Thomas are among 
the contributors to a new Christmas album. Holidays Rule will be released on 30 
October, through Starbucks's Hear Music label.

The collection mixes a handful of very big-name acts with smaller folk and 
indie acts, all of whom have recorded new versions of Yuletide classics. While 
McCartney croons about chestnuts, the rockers from Fun have sleighbells on the 
brain. In a tribute to their album-mate, the Shins have covered Wings'Wonderful 
Christmastime <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9BZDpni56Y>, and Wainwright laid 
down the classic duetBaby, It's Cold Outside 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crFQpOCDfEc> with chanteuse Sharon Van Etten.

Other contributors include Andrew Bird 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/andrew-bird>, Calexico, Holly Golightly, the 
Punch Brothers and the Fiery Furnaces' Eleanor Friedberger. The lineup was 
selected with help from the Decemberists' Chris Funk, who said he was 
particularly pleased with a song called Señor Santa – a Christmassy version of 
Mr Sandman, recorded by Latin act Y La Bamba.

"I love holiday music," co-producer Sara Matarazzo said in a statement, "but 
every year I find myself going back to the standards. I wondered, where's the 
holiday record for this generation?" Ironically, part of that next-gen feel 
involved convincing McCartney to be involved. "As far as I'm concerned, I could 
walk on the moon and it wouldn't surpass [that]," she said.
