Ajami <http://www.kino.com/ajami/> (15) 
(Scandar Copti, Yaron Shani, 2009, Isr/Ger) Shahir Kabaha, Ibrahim Frege, Eran 
Naim. 125 mins.

If any situation justifies the multi-angled Crash/Amores Perros-style 
treatment, it's modern-day Israel. Co-written and directed by an Israeli and a 
Palestinian, mostly using non-professional actors, this is more hip, streetwise 
and even-handed than we're used to. Set in a mixed neighbourhood of Tel Aviv, 
the plot skilfully juggles intertwined stories of feuds, families, drugs and 
violence involving characters from all faiths.

Trash Humpers <http://www.trashhumpers.com/> (18) 
(Harmony Korine, 2009, US/UK) Brian Kotzue, Travis Nicholson, Rachel Korine. 
78 mins.

Korine preserves his enfant terrible reputation with a scrappy, seedy home 
video following a group of masked delinquents around. It's a vaudeville of 
depravity (they literally hump dustbins) that manages to be grimy without being 
explicit.

Wild Grass <http://uk.filmtrailer.com/cinema/3354/wild+grass+film+trailer.html>
(12A)
(Alain Resnais, 2009, Fra/Ita) André Dussolier, Sabine Azéma. 104 mins.

Veteran Resnais crafts a silky, genre-hopping middle-aged romance that's full 
of wonders and mysteries. The set-up is deceptively simple, but we're gradually 
led into a maze of fantasies.

MacGruber 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jun/12/saturday-night-live-macgruber> (15) 
(Jorma Taccone, 2010, US) Will Forte, Kristen Wiig, Val Kilmer. 90 mins.

Some hilariously obscene moments lift this 1980s action movie pastiche.

Please Give  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/jun/14/5-ways-to-spot-nicole-holofcener-movie>
(15)
(Nicole Holofcener, 2010, US) Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt, Rebecca Hall. 90 
mins.

New York values – moral, generational and real-estate – are to the fore in an 
intelligent, modern, female-led comedy.

Killers <http://killersfilm.com/> (12A) 
(Robert Luketic, 2010, US) Ashton Kutcher, Katherine Heigl, Tom Selleck. 100 
mins.

Underpowered "Mr and Mrs" action comedy that seems to have run out of ideas at 
the casting stage.

Wild Target <http://www.myspace.com/wildtargetmovie> (12A) 
(Jonathan Lynn, 2010, UK) Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt, Rupert Grint. 98 mins.

Trifling, rompy crime caper involving art-theft, hitmen and lots of running 
around.

Our Family Wedding <http://www.foxsearchlight.com/ourfamilywedding/> (12A) 
(Rick Famuyiwa, 2010, US) Forest Whitaker, America Ferrara, Carlos Mencia. 103 
mins.

The marriage of an Afro-American and a Mexican provides the excuse for broad 
ethnic laughs and goat-related slapstick.

Hierro <http://uk.filmtrailer.com/cinema/3668/hierro+film+trailer.html> (12A) 
(Gabe Ibáñez, 2009, Spa) Elena Anaya, Hugo Arbues. 94 mins.

Visually impressive missing-child thriller that disappointingly ransacks the 
cliche cupboard for jumpy scares and plot twists.

Journey To Mecca <http://www.journeytomeccagiantscreen.com/> (PG) 
(Bruce Neibaur, 2009, US/Can) Chems-Eddine Zinoune. 46 mins.

Unprecedented footage of Mecca adds interest to an otherwise patchy IMAX 
dramatisation of the pilgrimage of Moroccan legend Ibn Battuta.

Rashômon <http://www.spike.com/video/rashomon/2823870> (12A)
(Akira Kurosawa, 1950, Jap) Toshirô Mifune, Machiko Kyô.

The daddy of multi-angle narratives, weaving four clashing testimonies of a 
rape and murder.

Raavan <http://www.raavan-thefilm.com/> (12A) 
(Mani Ratnam, 2010, Ind) Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai. 136 mins.

Bollywood auteur Ratnam crafts a superior tale of a bandit and his hostage.
