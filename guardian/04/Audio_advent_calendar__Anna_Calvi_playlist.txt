We love Anna Calvi even if our New Band of the Day writer wasn't so keen

features everything from the Cocteau Twins to Ennio Morricone. Let's see what 
she has to say about her track selection ...

I want to be moved by music – I want to hear passion. I want to hear a singer 
give everything to a song, and for them to be as raw, honest and open as 
possible, like Antony Hergarty.

As an artist I try to create a world that my songs can inhabit. I want the 
music to illustrate the story as much as the lyrics do. Scott Walker does this 
so beautifully in It's Raining Today. The strings create a subtext to the story 
– you can almost "see" the rain. The strings hang on an unusual chord, creating 
texture and suspense.

Composers such as Ennio Morricone, Olivier Messiaen and Bernard Herrmann are 
masters at telling a story through music. The listener is taken on a journey. 
Cocteau Twins also manage to create an amazing atmosphere in a simple way – 
through melody. Without needing to hold on to the lyrics, and with beautiful 
simple melodies, the listener is pulled even deeper into the heart of the song."
