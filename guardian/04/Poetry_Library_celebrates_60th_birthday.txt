A library that was described by Philip Larkin as "one of the occasional pure 
flowerings of the imagination for which the English are so seldom given credit" 
is celebrating its 60th birthday with a typically low-key cake cutting and 
poetry gathering.

The Poetry Library <http://www.poetrylibrary.org.uk>, now based in London's 
Southbank Centre, has helped nurture some of the country's most memorable 
poetry since it was opened in 1953. Ted Hughes "trekked for days" through its 
volumes when he and Seamus Heaney were researching their influential 1978 
anthology The Rattle Bag, and Andrew Motion used it to research his 2001 
anthology Here to Eternity, published when he was poet laureate.

Motion has said: "The most extraordinary thing is the fact that it exists at 
all. As Larkin said, it's the kind of thing that you don't expect England to 
do. It flies in the face of the way we generally run things, ie neglect things. 
I used it a lot when I was doing the Here to Eternity anthology. The stock is 
extremely good and very catholic – and the ancillary services, such as 
quote-checking, are wonderful."

The library has been at the heart of the English poetry community since it was 
opened by TS Eliot and Herbert Read in 1953. In the 1970s, at around the time 
The Rattle Bag was created, Hughes wrote in a letter toAdrian Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/adrian-mitchell>: "This last 
week I was sitting every day in the poetry library at the Arts Council going 
through every book that showed any likelihood of producing a poem for the 
anthology … I was trekking for days through the densely packed Ys and the 
insuperably ranked Ws – going very birdlike over the tops of their heads for 
the most part … Very strange experience, squeezing every morning into modern 
poetry, and sitting there all curled up with book over mouth inhaling deeply, 
then coming out in the five or six o'clock dark onto Piccadilly again."

The library began its life moving around various London venues, supported by 
Arts Council funding, but found a permanent home on the fifth floor of the 
Royal Festival Hall (now the Southbank Centre) in 1988, at an event that was 
celebrated with a ceremonial cake-cutting by Heaney. It now holds a collection 
of 200,000 items of modern British poetry, dating from 1912, and hosts regular 
readings and events. Highlights of its 60th season include a series of shared 
readings, where the audience read poems aloud, andPoetry Library Lock-Ins 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/the-poetry-library-lock-in-78212>, in 
which users can explore the collection after hours.

Poet Ian McMillan <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ianmcmillan> is the 
host for Tuesday's cake-cutting, and Emily Berry will read from her 2013 
Forward prize for best first collection winner,Dear Boy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/01/drysalter-wins-forward-poetry-prize>
; a packed line-up also includes readings from Fleur Adcock, John Agard, Peter 
Finch, Jen Hadfield, Kei Miller, Daljit Nagra, Brenda Shaughnessy, Amjad Nasser 
and Warsan Shire.

The library has commissioned six poems from some of England's leading 
contemporary poets to mark the occasion. Chris McCabe, the Southbank Centre's 
poetry librarian, said: "ThePoetry <https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry> 
Library is such a treasured resource and loved by so many people, that we 
wanted to mark our 60th birthday in style."

John Hegley's From A Grateful Borrower begins:

I'm going down the South Bank
to the bank of books and verse 
and poetry. I'm bringing back my library books
they are late
and I celebrate
for in this fine resource
you pay no fine 
for slender spine, or any other item, overdue.

But Annie Freud struck a wistful note, mourning the loss of the Library's 
ancillary performance space, the Voice Box, when the Festival Hall was 
refurbished a few years ago. :

Once There a Was a Room
on the fifth floor
where poets used to come and speak
their poems to an audience.
It went in favour of glass lift.
But I'm sixty now and I want it back

Her wish may be granted when the library begins the next phase of its life, 
opening a similar "Voice Space" in the new Festival Wing of the centre, a glass 
building overlooking the Thames. A new children's poetry library is also 
planned as part of the development, of the whole Southbank Centre, due to start 
in 2015.
