A high court judge has declined to insist that politicians end Northern 
Ireland’s near-total ban on abortion, despite ruling it was incompatible with 
the UK’s 1998 Human Rights Act.

Mr Justice Horner’s judgment on Wednesday morning instead put the onus on the 
Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> assembly to 
take on board his decision – but there is no legal compunction on the 
politicians at the Stormont parliament to change the law.

At present, under a 19th-century law, local medical teams could be jailed for 
life for carrying out abortions even in extreme circumstances. Unlike the rest 
of the UK, theAbortion <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion> Act 1967 
has never applied to Northern Ireland and since devolution was restored to the 
Stormont assembly, has resisted any attempt to relax the ban on terminations in 
hospitals.

Horne is the same judge who at the end of last month ruled that Northern 
Ireland’s ban breaches the human rights of women and girls, including rape 
victims.

Abortions are only permitted in the region’s health service if the life of a 
mother is directly under threat or in cases in which there would be lasting 
long-term negative effects on her health by continuing with the pregnancy. Many 
women go to the UK to obtain abortions.


However, with the prospect of an appeal against Wednesday’s judgment and the 
judge’s ruling in November, Stormont is unlikely to debate the matter further 
for the forseeable future.
