Winning tip: Cycling the Sierra Nevada to the sea

If you like local hospitality, sunny, dusty trails and insane amounts of fun, 
we recommend this week of fast-flowing single track. Our physically challenging 
trip took us to the very best ofAndalucía 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/andalucia>, including through remote 
villages and epic mountain scenery. We stayed in authentic Andalucían 
accommodation, including luxury caves.

Rafting on the Genil river

If you fancy a rush, a rafting adventure awaits on the Genil. For beginners 
and families with children aged six and up, there is a quiet course close to 
Málaga at Cuevas Bajas. The stretch of white water between Benamejí and 
Palenciana is for the more experienced.From €50pp with paddleinspain.com

La Taha de Pitres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/20/top-holidays-andalucia-wildlife-spain>
 is a series of pretty villages linked by a well-marked footpath high in the 
Sierra Nevada. The area offers family activities based on hiking, fruit 
collecting and swimming in lakes. Get up to Granada then take a short bus ride 
and you’ll be breathing fresh air and (in the autumn) picking wild figs and 
almonds for dinner.

A walk on the wild side

East of Almería, Mónsul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/17/spain-andalucia-villages-beaches>
 is perhaps best-known because its beach was seen in Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade. The coastal path to Vela Blanca is closed to all but foot traffic, and 
provides astounding views as you clamber along the track with jagged rocks, 
coral reefs and abundant wildlife.

 The renovated Caminito del Rey in the province of Málaga is sometimes dubbed “
the world’s most dangerous path 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/27/caminito-del-rey-malaga-path-reopens-spain-hiking>
”. The 3km walkway clings to the Garganta del Chorro ravine, and traces the 
route of the original decayed catwalk from which several walkers fell to their 
deaths. The new metre-wide, wood-panelled walkway features several spectacular 
glass floor sections and a hanging bridge over the gorge.

 I visited Pure Mountains in Bérchules in mid-May as a solo traveller and had 
a memorable weekend riding great trails. The location is superb, we rode as a 
group from the farmhouse each day and soon got to know everyone. Jenny and Tim 
were excellent hosts and quickly gauged the group to ensure we rode within our 
limits on the most enjoyable trails.

White Villages bike tour

 From Ronda, try the Andalucían Cycling Experience tour, with farmhouse/hotel 
accommodation and a support van. It’s a fairly challenging trip of 127 miles, 
but doable by a reasonably fit retired couple. You’ll go through olive and cork 
plantations, mostly on quiet roads with stunning scenery.

We all say “nothing’s going to change just because we’re having a child” – but 
most of us know it isn’t true. The question is really how much can you do with 
a baby in tow? We – one experienced biker, one less experienced (and pregnant) 
and one 18-month-old with a bicycle trailer – had a great holiday arranged by 
Sierra Cycling, in Fuengirola. Top-quality riding for those who wanted it, 
including some dramatic river crossings, and lovely less-technical off-road 
with great views, as far as Africa on one day. I can honestly say this is the 
first holiday in 18 months I’ve really felt revitalised by.
