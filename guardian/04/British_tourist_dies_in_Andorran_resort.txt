A British man has been found dead in a ski resort after apparently getting 
lost on one of the coldest nights of the Andorran winter.

The body of Paul Rea was discovered on Thursday afternoon covered in snow near 
a river close to the resort of Pas de la Casa, in the Pyrenees.

Rea, 24, who was on holiday with friends, was last seen on Wednesday evening 
in the bar district of the resort, which lies on the French border. He is 
believed to have wandered off, become disorientated and frozen to death, police 
said.

A police spokesman told the Spanish news agency Europa Press that the body was 
found near the entrance to the Envalira tunnel, a major road artery, and showed 
"no signs of violence". Officers were alerted to the discovery by a tunnel 
worker.

"We are aware of the death of a British national in Andorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/andorra> on March 11," a Foreign Office 
spokeswoman said. "Next of kin are aware. We are providing consular assistance."

A postmortem examination was carried out on Friday and Rea's family have 
travelled to the resort.

The Diari d'Andorra newspaper said Rea went missing on one of the harshest and 
coldest nights of the winter. Last week, parts of north-eastern Spain were hit 
bythe heaviest snowstorm in decades

off many areas and blocking the border.

Rea is the second tourist fatality in Pas de la Casa in recent months. Last 
December the body of a Spanish holidaymaker, 30-year-old Igor Mate Garc√≠a, was 
found near the tunnel entrance. An investigation found that he died of 
hypothermia after drinking high amounts of alcohol.
