The investment bank once chaired by Malcolm Turnbull has backed the view that 
much of the benefit from theCoalition’s company tax cuts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/company-tax-cut-plan-will-cost-482bn-over-10-years-treasury-reveals>
 could flow to offshore investors, as the prime minister insisted his plan was 
the best way to ensure continued economic growth.

Responding to figures released on Wednesday showing a stronger-than-expected 
annual growth rate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/australias-gdp-growth-rises-by-11-in-march-quarter-taking-annual-rate-to-31>
 of 3.1%, Turnbull said the result was “so far so good” but had not “happened 
by accident” and required the incentive of his company tax cut plan to be 
maintained.

But in an economic research note, Goldman Sachs found that if companies 
distributed the value of the tax cut as profits or dividends to investors then 
60% of the benefit would flow to offshore investors, 10% to domestic investors 
and around 30% to the Australian economy.

The domestic benefits would be far bigger if companies used the tax cut to 
grow their business but Goldman Sachs said “survey evidence suggests that 
companies are less likely to voluntarily lower the dividend payment ratio”, 
meaning the real world impact was likely to be closer to the scenario where 60% 
of the benefit flowed offshore.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/malcolm-turnbull-says-grattan-institute-wrong-about-company-tax-cuts>
 that companies would pay out a large proportion of higher profits rather than 
increase their domestic investment, and the particular benefits this afforded 
foreign investors.

Late on Wednesday, the Greens released costings by the Parliamentary Budget 
Office showing the government’s plan to cut company tax would cost $51bn over 
ten years – $3bn more than Treasury has said.

Turnbull, who was chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs Australia 
between 1997 and 2001, said he had not read the Goldman report but “the 
important point is that if you deliver a better return on investment then you 
get more investment”.

“I think sometimes the Labor party imagine that Australia is in some kind of 
bubble. Sealed off from reality, sealed off from the rest of the world ... 
where you can deny companies tax cuts and investment won’t be affected.”

But the former Liberal leader John Hewson raised similar points to Goldman 
Sachs in a radio interview Wednesday, and said the Coalition needed to provide 
more evidence to prove that the tax cuts would boost investment.

“There is obviously a debate always about when you cut taxes where the 
benefits go,” Hewson said. “There is a suggestion of course that a company tax 
cut goes predominantly to multinational corporations who may not contribute 
anything more to Australia. They may not employ more Australians, they may not 
invest.

“The world hasn’t seen a significant pick-up in investment despite the fact 
that we have had near zero interest rates in most developed countries. So is it 
tax that is going to make a difference to that? I’m not sure, I think it’s a 
bigger issue.
“It does go to foreign shareholders. But the assumption is that those 
companies operating in Australia will expand their investment and they will 
employ people. That needs much more debate and evidence,” he said.

After weeks of Labor’s attacks that the tax cuts policy benefits the “big end 
of town” and “big banks”, Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, have in 
recent days emphasised that the first beneficiaries will be small “Mum and Dad 
run” businesses and that there would be several more elections before the 
biggest businesses benefitted.

“The biggest companies won’t get a tax cut for eight years. There will be 
three elections between now and then. The beneficiaries of our tax cuts in the 
near term, over the next six or seven years are all smaller companies, and 
particularly over the next three years, they are overwhelmingly 
Australian-owned family businesses,” Turnbull said on Wednesday.

But a government spokesman confirmed the government would seek to legislate 
the full 10 years of the tax cuts as soon as possible, if the coalition was 
re-elected.

And the Council of Small Business of Australia has warned only a small 
minority of family businesses would reinvest the tax cut.

Cosboa, which strongly supports the coalition’s policy, has said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/01/fraction-of-small-businesses-likely-to-use-coalition-tax-cuts-to-expand-industry-body>
 “only about 40,000 of the 870,000 small businesses getting a tax cut under are 
likely to use the bonus to expand their operations” with the rest using the 
bonus to increase profits or dividends.

Goldman Sachs said the long lead time meant the tax plan could not be the only 
answer to the need to boost growth in the non-mining economy.

“If the objective is to boost near term economic growth, then a company tax 
cut that commences in 8 years time will likely still need to be supplemented by 
further demand management policies...in the interim,” it said.

Asked about the report, Labor leader Bill Shorten said; “Mr Turnbull’s old 
bank that he worked for has come out with this report ... it says in one 
sentence that 60% of this tax giveaway of Mr Turnbull’s is going to go to 
overseas shareholders. So the choice in this election is... you can spend more 
money on a health care system, Medicare, cheaper medicine, or you can give it 
away to foreign shareholders and big banks, the choice couldn’t be clearer in 
this election.”

The Greens said PBO costings of the cost of the tax cuts showed they would be 
more expensive than the government has said.

“It’s a death blow to the argument that company tax cuts are affordable,” 
Greens Treasury spokesperson Adam Bandt MP said.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, responded to questions about the exact benefit 
of the tax cuts by saying every bit of additional economic growth was a benefit.

“In this tough economy you take every inch of growth you can get. You take 
every job you can get,” he said. “As a government, we’re not going to be 
dismissive of the ability to increase investment and the jobs and the growth 
that comes from that. I get the sense fromBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> that somehow there’s 
some growth he is not happy to have. Every inch of growth matters as small or 
as large as it can be. We will fight for every inch of growth, every job that 
can be created as a result of our tax plan and our broader national economic 
plan.”

Turnbull was chair and managing director of Goldman Sachs Australia from 1997 
to 2001 and a partner with Goldman Sachs and Co from 1998 to 2001.
