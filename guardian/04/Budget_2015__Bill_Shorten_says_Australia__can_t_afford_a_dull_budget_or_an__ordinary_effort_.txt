Fairness, honesty and suitability of policy must be at the heart of next 
week’s budget so that the document does not tank like last year’s, the 
opposition leaderBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> was set to argue in 
his major pre-budget address.

Shorten contests that the 2014 federal budget did not fail because it was “too 
exciting, too visionary or too bold”, but rather that major policy objectives 
stalled in the Senate because they were “fundamentally unfair”.

“We can’t afford a dull budget or an ordinary effort, any more than we can 
afford a rerun of last year’s disaster,” Shorten was due to tell Sydney 
University’s McKell institute on Monday.

“We can’t afford an outbreak of shallow populism any more than we can afford a 
repeat of last year’s extreme ideology.”

The opposition leader says there are three major tests for the next budget, 
due on 12 May: whether it is suitable for the future, whether it is honest and 
responsible, and whether it is fair.

“Incredibly, a week before this year’s budget, we are still talking about last 
year’s budget. Last year, the Liberals called the economy wrong and Australians 
have paid the price.”

Labor is calling on the government to take on its policy objective of 
tightening superannuation concessions

 for wealthy Australians by charging 15% tax on super earnings over $75,000. It 
says that measure will bring in $14bn over 10 years.

It is also proposing that the government can add $2bn to its coffers by 
closing loopholes on multinational tax avoidance

, such as changing guidelines on what can be classified as company assets, and 
allowing the Tax Office to have greater oversight over big international firms.

“Fairness means asking those with the broadest shoulders to do the most, not 
leaving the heavy lifting to those Australians least able to carry the load,” 
Shorten’s speech notes say.

The opposition leader planned to put pressure on the government to end the 
impasse on the renewable energy target, saying that the “transition to a low 
pollution economy [will make] our industries more competitive, harnessing our 
natural resources and protecting our national estate.”

The government is standing firm on its offer of 32,000 gigawatt hours, up from 
its original offer of 26,000. Labor has offered a compromise of 33,500 gigawatt 
hours.
