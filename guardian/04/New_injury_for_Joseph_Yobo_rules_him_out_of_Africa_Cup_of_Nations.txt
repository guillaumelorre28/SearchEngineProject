Everton's Nigeria defender Joseph Yobo has reportedly been ruled out of the 
Africa Cup of Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> 
with a hamstring problem. It is the latest recurrence of an injury that has 
plagued him this season.

The news will come as a worry to Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, whose season has been blighted 
by injuries to key players.

Yobo suffered the injury when Nigeria beat Benin in a Group C encounter at the 
weekend. He was sent to the Angolan capital, Luanda, for scans and initial 
suggestions seem to indicate that he will need at least two weeks to recover, 
meaning he will not be fit in time for the final on 31 January, ifNigeria

"Yobo has rejoined the team and the scan revealed that he will be out for two 
weeks," said Nigeria's technical committee chairman, Taiwo Ogunjobi, after the 
team booked their place in the quarter-finals of the competition yesterday with 
a 3-0 win over Mozambique.
