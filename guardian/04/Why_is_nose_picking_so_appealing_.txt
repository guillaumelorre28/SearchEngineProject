Police officers in the Philippines have been banned from picking their noses 
on duty to stop them ‘creating a negative impression’ in public. But why, 
despite disgusted reactions, is this particular bad habit so enduring?

One reason humans find nose picking so rewarding is because the parts of the 
cortex connected to the hand and the face are so close together. Buried in the 
central sulcus of the brain, a groove down the side of the middle of your head, 
is a map-like representation of the entire surface of the body, called the 
homunculus.

The body is three dimensional, but as the cortex is like a sheet of paper 
scrunched up to fit inside the skull, to fit it on to a 2D map requires certain 
cuts and juxtapositions. So, the representation of the hand ends up adjacent to 
the representation of the face. This nearness probably explains in part why 
touching the face and playing with the lips, nose and cheeks feels so 
satisfying.

It is also why, sometimes, amputees who experience ‘phantom’ itches in their 
non-existent limb, can relieve these by scratching their face. Doesn’t make 
seeing other people’s bogies any nicer, though.
