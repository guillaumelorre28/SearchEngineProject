Sister Catherine Nassiwa is in no doubt about the benefits of the scheme. As 
the District Malaria Focal Person she has trained hundreds of volunteers. At 
the traditional meeting place, beneath the boughs of the mango tree she 
explains the symptoms, talks through the medication and supervises the CMDs as 
they treat their first cases.

Their role extends further than just malaria treatment now though. "I am so 
proud that there is a link between the community and the health workers," 
Sister Catherine tells me. "Before, health workers were white elephants, not 
part of them. But now they have made a change they are linking us to the 
community."

The volunteers are providing a vital connection between the authorities and 
the people, many of whom are suspicious of government agencies.

Because the volunteers are trusted members of the village who have been 
selected by their own peers, they can gather important information that helps 
the health service. "If we want any information, and communication with the 
community about health issues, we ask them."

For Sister Catherine, the scheme is the single most important service around. 
"This is a programme for our children because our children are our future. I 
think the programme is vital. It should continue."
