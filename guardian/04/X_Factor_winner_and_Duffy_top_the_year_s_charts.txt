Alexandra Burke <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke> and Duffy 
have rounded off an eventful 12 months by being declared the top-selling 
musicians of the year, it emerged yesterday.

Burke, winner of The X Factor, whose cover of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah was 
the Christmas No 1, sold 888,000 copies through downloads and CDs - 311,000 of 
them in the last week.

According to figures from the Official Charts Company, Burke also pushed the X 
Factor Finalists' charity single, Hero, into second place with sales of 751,000.

It was also a good year for X Factor judge Simon Cowell: the top two singles 
were released through Syco Music, the company he set up, as was the year's 
fourth most popular album, Leona Lewis's Spirit.

The Welsh singer Duffy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/duffy> saw her 
single Mercy take the No 3 spot in the year's bestseller chart. It was the only 
other single to sell more than half a million copies.

Duffy's debut album, Rockferry, was the year's bestselling album, racking up 
1.685m digital and physical sales, and denying Take That the top spot.

The reformed boy band's latest album, The Circus, sold 1.446m copies in the 
last four weeks, making it the UK's second fastest million-seller. "Duffy and 
Alexandra Burke have been the biggest new arrivals on the British music scene 
over the past year, bar none," said Martin Talbot, managing director of the 
Official Charts Company, which compiles the UK's official singles, albums and 
compilations charts.

The Mamma Mia! The Movie soundtrack was the year's biggest compilation seller 
and the only various artists package to sell more than a million copies in the 
UK.

Kings of Leon claimed the third spot in the top 10 bestselling albums with 
Only By the Night. Lewis's Spirit came fourth, while Coldplay's fourth album, 
Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends, was fifth.
