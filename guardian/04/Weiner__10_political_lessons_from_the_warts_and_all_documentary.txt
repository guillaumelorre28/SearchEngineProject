There are lessons for us all in Weiner, a new documentary charting the rise 
and fall of former House representativeAnthony Weiner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anthony-weiner> and his 2013 New York 
mayoral run. If the name doesn’t ring a bell, he was the Democrat unable to 
stop himself from sabotaging his career – twice – by sending sexually explicit 
pictures to strangers on social media.

Weiner was first elected to Congress at age 34 in 1998 after six years as a 
New York City councilman, and fought spiritedly for healthcare reform and funds 
for 9/11 first responders in the House. Some of his fiery speeches becamehits 
on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-AErCKUTo>. He also voted for the 
war in Iraq and was criticised for hypocrisy over his campaign for UN diplomats 
to pay parking tickets whenhis own vehicles were found to have racked up unpaid 
fines

.

After resigning in 2011 when his first set of sexually explicit messages came 
to light, he embarked on an apology tour, backed by his wife Huma Abedin, a top 
aide to Hillary Clinton. He then returned to the fray to run for New York mayor 
in 2013 on a platform ofprotecting the middle-class

Seemingly forgiven and even embraced for his sins by voters, Weiner surged to 
the top of the polls

 before – almost unbelievably – disaster struck again when a new set of sexts 
were revealed, dating fromafter his first resignation. 

As the documentary shows, he pressed on with his campaign despite a huge and 
destabilising media furore, and eventually slumped to last place in the primary 
election, which was won by current mayor Bill de Blasio.

Here’s what I learned from the film, which goes on release in the US on Friday 
– and what you can learn too:

 * Don’t sext pictures of your penis to strangers on social media unless 
you’re 100% sure your spouse, who may be the closest aide of a potential future 
presidential hopeful, won’t mind.

 * If you must sext pictures to strangers, try to ensure you are not a US 
congressman at the time. 
 * If you do sext pictures, and you are a US congressman, try to make sure 
your name is not a humorous synonym for penis. This will avoid a situation 
where theNew York Post and New York Daily News 
<http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/Anthony-Weiner/ig/Anthony-Weiner-Pictures/> 
can run a series of punning headlines such as He’s Got Some Balls, Same Old 
Schlong and Dance, Weiner: I’ll Stick it Out, Cuomo Beats Weiner, and Obama 
Beats Weiner. 
 * But if you are tempted to solve the above problem by adopting a pseudonym, 
don’t choose “Carlos Danger”. 
 * Don’t keep on sexting people after your first resignation from Congress if 
you one day hope to run for mayor of New York.  <> Facebook

 in a restaurant it’s perhaps understandable to return to the restaurant, mouth 
full of food, in order to escalate the argument, even if it means the media get 
to feast over every second. But when MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell asks about how 
your sexting scandal has torpedoed your mayoral bid, perhaps try not to laugh, 
shout, swear, mock the host’s voice ... or all four. The middle finger Weiner 
gave the press as he drove home having won only 4.9% of the vote in the mayoral 
primary sums up this approach neatly.

 * Don’t hire a comically self-important soda-slurping aide who will say 
things such as: “We’re executing the McDonald’s plan,” “I’m budgeting 12 
seconds from car to door,” and “I’m giving you the tick-tock of my plan,” and 
will give the recipient of some of your sexts the inappropriately cutesy 
codename “Pineapple”, then sheepishly tell the documentary crew filming you: 
“Oh shit, I shouldn’t have said that on the camera ... ’cause that’s our code 
word.” 
 * Don’t make a joke that revolves around having sex with two people to your 
female press secretary on camera in the middle of the fallout from your own 
actual sex scandal.  <> Facebook

 * Don’t adopt a Caribbean accent while dancing and toasting along with 
dancehall music on a float – actually that one really seemed to work. His whole 
campaign should have been based around this approach.

 * Similarly, Weiner allowing a documentary film crew to continue filming him 
and his wife as scandal broke probably seemed like a potential mistake at the 
time – but in fact the film thatJosh Kriegman 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4361978?ref_=tt_ov_dr> and Elyse Steinberg 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825748?ref_=tt_ov_dr> have produced is much less a 
damning hit piece than something close to the first step toward his public 
rehabilitation. So the message I take away from this is: always keep a film 
crew close at hand.

Weiner is out now on general release in the US.
