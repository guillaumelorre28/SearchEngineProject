“Dear citizens! Attention please, attention please: Tehran is now free,” read 
a message widely shared on the popular messaging app, Telegram.


Jokes started circulating on social media on 27 February after it became clear 
the coalition of candidates supported by the reformists,dubbed “the list of 
hope” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/election-day-arrives-in-iran-with-reformists-well-organised-to-seek-gains>
, was likely to take all of the capital’s 30 parliamentary seats.

One popular quip shared on Telegram imagined the former parliament speaker and 
conservative hardliner Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel – who eventually lost his seat – 
resting his head on the legs of Iran’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei>, telling him: “I 
won’t go to the parliament!” with Khamenei responding: “Don’t be afraid, my 
little one. You’ll find new friends.”

With strong emphasis on privacy protection and anonymity for its users 
<https://telegram.org/privacy> the Telegram app has become a popular platform 
for pro-reform supporters to spread their message, withone in four Iranian now 
thought to be using the service 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/08/telegram-the-instant-messaging-app-freeing-up-iranians-conversations>
.

One joke shared widely on the app showed the head of the Guardian Council of 
the Constitution, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, pleading: “Don’t push me [out]!” – a 
reference to the fact that he is was languishing in 15th place on the list of 
assembly candidates from Tehran.

‘Please end vote counting’

Other social media users alluded to the house arrest of Iranian opposition 
figuresMir Hossein Musavi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/mir-hossein-mousavi-photograph-emerges>
, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and fellow reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi.

The three popular oppositionists were detained in February 2011 after 
repeatedly challenging the Iranian establishment over human rights abuses.

The joke has the trio’s supporters declaring that “if Jannati doesn’t get 
elected, we will take to the streets to protest and claim we’re his fans so 
that they puthim under house arrest.” 

One of the most widespread Telegram memes showed conservative religious leader 
Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi declaring that it was “haram” [forbidden] to continue 
counting votes.

Twitter users riffed on the same theme: @KevinMiston wrote “Iranian Supreme 
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: ‘Please end the vote counting. Please don’t 
stretch it any longer’.”

Others poked fun at Iran’s highest authority. A viral message lampooned the 
supreme leader with the text: “I told those opposing the system to vote. But 
not like this!”


It’s now thought that a combination of reformist-backed candidates, including 
some moderate conservatives and independents allied with Rouhani, will 
outnumber the conservatives in the country’s 290-seat parliament.

Khatami

Many social media users also recognised the role former president Mohammad 
Khatami played in encouraging people to vote for a list of pro-reformist and 
relatively moderate candidates.

Khatami released a video online early in the campaign period urging political 
activists to unite behind “the list of hope”. HisYouTube video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psMgpk33A60> became an instant hit and helped 
mobilise support – which Twitter users were quick to acknowledge.

Khatami’s role in mobilising voters was celebrated by those who pointed to the 
fact he has faced severe restrictions on his movement and activities in recent 
years,including a ban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/17/iranian-media-banned-from-mentioning-mohammad-khatami>
 on the Iranian media mentioning his name or publishing his photograph.

Khatami’s video also inspired a Telegram message that referenced the 
controversial frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the US presidential 
election.

In the joke, Iranian foreign minister Mohamamd Javad Zarif calls up his US 
counterpart John Kerry and says: “Hey, man, if Donald Trump is really becoming 
a problem for you guys let me know. I’ll tell our Mohammad [Khatami] to send a 
message.”
