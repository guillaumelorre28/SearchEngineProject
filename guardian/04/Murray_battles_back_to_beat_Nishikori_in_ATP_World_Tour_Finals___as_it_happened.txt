“I fought really hard,” Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> says. Yep. He’s not quite 
through yet. But the group will be his if Marin Cilic beats Stan Wawrinka 
tonight. Thanks for reading. That was the longest match in this tournament’s 
history. Bye!

A barmy match ends with Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> claiming a precious victory, 
which means he’s won his opening two matches in this tournament for the first 
time.Kei Nishikori made him work for it. The world No7 fought brilliantly and 
he had his chances. He can still go through if he beats Marin Cilic on Friday.

Andy Murray beats Kei Nishikori 6-7, 6-4, 6-4!

Murray gets a roar of encouragement as he gets up from his chair and prepares 
to serve for the match for a second time. He’s relieved to see Nishikori miss a 
backhand return off a second serve. It’s 30-0 when Nishikori goofs a forehand 
return and Murray finally, after three hours and 20 minutes, has three match 
points when Nishikori batters a backhand wide. After a short rally, Nishikori 
sends one final backhand past the baseline and it’s all over at long last!

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 5-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Murray’s 
chuntering at himself as Nishikori prepares to serve. He’s in a foul mood. He 
plonks a backhand long to make it 15-0. Nishikori skips into a 30-0 lead. He 
fancies his chances all of a sudden. A smash makes it 40-15, his feet moving 
again, and he holds to 30. Well. Well, well. Surely Murray isn’t going to chuck 
this way? He’ll serve for the match again.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 5-3 Nishikori (*denotes server): Serving for the 
match, Murray attempts to topple Nishikori at the net. Nishikori stays firm and 
volleys sharply for 0-15. Then he pings a forehand down the line to lead 0-30. 
This isn’t done yet. Murray needs some big serves. He gets a couple to force it 
back to 30-all, moving two points from victory. But Nishikori really isn’t done 
yet. A cracking backhand return earns him a break point. He can’t take it, 
though, a forehand return clipping the top of the net and looping past the 
baseline, but he grabs a second opportunity with a splendid forehand down the 
line. Murray decides now’s the time for a double fault. On we go.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 5-2 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Serving to stay 
in the match, Nishikori lashes a forehand down the line for 15-0. But Murray 
wants this done. This is already his longest ever three-set match - we’re past 
the three-hour mark – and he fights back from 30-0 down, making it 30-all with 
a backhand winner. But Nishikori won’t lie down. He holds and Murray will have

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 4-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori scoots 
into a 30-0 lead. Although he was in a similar position of dominance in his 
previous service game and look how that turned out. He keeps Murray at baying, 
though, hitting through his forehand to move to 40-15. After two missed 
Nishikori forehands, though, it’s deuce. Another one hands Murray a break 
point. At this stage, it’s effectively a match point. Nishikori, looking 
increasingly knackered, double faults and Murray breaks again.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 3-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray begins 
the game sloppily, netting a backhand, but Nishikori matches him by doing a 
horrible job with a forehand that makes it 15-all. Another limp backhand from 
Murray makes it 15-30, but he overpowers Nishikori in the next rally for 
30-all, seeing his big cross-court forehand and raising him. Murray makes it 
40-30 by denting Nishikori’s armour with a zinger of a backhand, racing forward 
to finish the point with a smash, but the game goes to deuce and Nishikori 
earns a break point with some expert volleying. Murray saves it. Nishikori 
can’t do anything with a forehand return, but he has another opportunity when 
Murray fails to catch a forehand cleanly. Again, though, it goes begging, 
Nishikori second best in a drop shot battle. He challenges unsuccessfully and 
it’s deuce. Murray’s looked shattered at times, but he won’t stop fighting. Nor 
will Nishikori, though. Murray’s yet to emerge unscathed from this marathon 
game, although he earns the advantage with an ace down the middle and holds 
when Nishikori nets a backhand.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 2-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): A thrashed 
forehand volley from Nishikori makes it 15-0. Murray’s in the next rally, but 
Nishikori wins it when the net cord favours his backhand. But Nishikori follows 
that up with consecutive double-faults to make it 30-all. Then he wafts a drop 
shot into the net to gift Murray a break point. This is hopeless from 
Nishikori, who needs to regain his focus as soon as possible. Giving Murray 
needless encouragement feels like the wrong tactic. But Nishikori hangs in 
there and he opens up the court with a vicious, angled backhand that allows to 
gambol forward and volley brilliantly for deuce. Murray’s got another chance 
when a backhand pass clips the net and fools the advancing Nishikori, though, 
and the breakthrough arrives when Nishikori’s backhand clips the top of the net 
and drops wide.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 0-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Into a deciding 
set we go, with Nishikori starting it by putting a smash away for 15-0. A 
wayward forehand makes it 15-all, but Murray responds with a couple of scratchy 
shots to make it 40-15. At 40-30, though, Nishikori yawns a drop shot into the 
net, giving Murray an early look at his serve. This has been a long match and a 
long season. I wonder if both players are feeling the strain a bit. Maybe not. 
Nishikori holds thanks to some accurate forehanding.

Andy Murray wins the second set 6-4 to level the match!

Serving for the set, Murray’s happy to see Nishikori drag a backhand wide for 
15-0. He’s not so pleased when he double faults or when he nets a backhand to 
make it 15-30. His mood improves when he bashes an ace out wide for 30-all. It 
darkens when he mishits a forehand to give up a break point. A huge serve 
almost takes Nishikori’s right arm off, though, and that’s deuce. Another one 
down the middle sets up a set point. An idiot in the crowd cries out before 
Murray’s about to serve, causing a brief delay; he misses at the first attempt. 
The second one goes in, but Nishikori pulls a drop shot out of his box of 
tricks and Murray nets. He earns a second set point when Nishikori chips a 
return long, but Murray generously nets a backhand drop shot. From deuce, 
Nishikori earns another break point, volleying with aplomb. He can’t take it, 
though, sending a backhand long, letting out a cry of anguish. Can you blame 
him? Moments later, he’s horrified to see a forehand drift long and wide to 
give Murray his third set point. Here comes another long rally. Nishikori goes 
for broke with a forehand into the right corner. It’s called out. It sure looks 
out. Nishikori isn’t so sure. Hawkeye is. Murray’s level!

Second set: Murray 6-7, 5-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Determined to regain 
the initiative, Murray charges into a 15-30 lead, planting a volley out of 
reach. Nishikori remains calm, finding a difficult spot with a backhand down 
the line that forces Murray to net a forehand for 30-all. Nishikori plays the 
next one beautifully, a canny drop shot setting him up for a delicate forehand 
lob for 40-30. That’s so good. The game goes to deuce when Nishikori nets a 
forehand, sparking a spell of outrageously good tennis from both players. 
Nishikori tries another drop shot. This time, though, Murray’s read his mind. 
He scampers forward and crashes a backhand from left to right to earn a break 
point. Nishikori nets a first serve. His second allows Murray to hit a deep 
backhand and Nishikori can’t deal with that, netting his riposte. Murray breaks 
again and will serve to force a third set.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 4-4 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori continues 
to make incursions with his forehand, battering his way into a 0-15 lead. Soon 
it’s 0-30, Murray tamely netting a backhand. A curving serve out wide makes it 
15-30, but Murray gives up two break points with an errant forehand. Nishikori 
glimpses a path back into the set. Murray tries to guide him away from it, 
volleying expertly to save the first break point. Can he send him down the path 
marked deuce? Nope. He approaches the net, but Nishikori’s backhand from left 
to right is too good! There goes the break! Nishikori is right back in this now 
and he’s two games from victory.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 2-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Looking to 
consolidate that break, Murray finds himself down 0-30 as Nishikori pummels a 
backhand return down the line. Good serving takes Murray to 30-all, though, 
before he makes it 40-30 with some solid forehand work. The game goes to deuce, 
but Murray holds with a feathery volley.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 1-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): That’s only the 
second time Nishikori has ever taken the first set off Murray and beat him on 
the previous occasion, which was here two years ago. Murray looks to be in mood 
for a repeat, though, quickly grabbing two break points with a stupendous 
forehand lob. Nishikori saves the first with a fine forehand winner. Murray 
can’t hide his disappointment. But he finally breaks when a Nishikori forehand 
clips the top of the net and deflects long. “Come on!” Murray roars.

Kei Nishikori wins the first set 7-6!

First set tie-break: Murray* 9-11 Nishikori (*denotes server): To a howl of 
astonishment from the crowd, Murray wallops a forehand wide and Nishikori 
deservedly grabs the first set! Murray’s not been terrible, but he’s not quite 
been at the races and Nishikori has played some outstanding tennis.

First set tie-break: Murray* 6-6 Nishikori (*denotes server): Oh my word! 
Murray saves it amazingly! He tried a drop shot, which was fairly risible. 
Nishikori got there and smashed a backhand from left to right. But somehow 
Murray read it and blocked a backhand down the line and back into the open 
court, Nishikori unable to hurtle back and retrieve it! What a point!

First set: Murray 6-6 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Serving to force a 
tie-break, Nishikori is happy to see Murray carelessly waft a backhand slice 
wide for 15-0. For the first time, though, Nishikori wobbles when he dumps a 
smash long for 15-all. He composes himself and spanks a forehand down the line 
for 30-15, but finds himself facing a set point after a couple of missed 
backhands. Murray’s really been biding his time. But then he reverts to bad old 
ways, passively netting a forehand for deuce, before frittering away another 
challenge when he sends a backhand well long. Nishikori double-faults and we go 
back to deuce, but he’s too alert for Murray at the net on the next point, 
judging a lob and putting away a smash. Nishikori holds. Tie-break!

First set: Murray* 6-5 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori suddenly starts 
to leave his shots short and low, a change of tack, but he can’t quite get 
enough purchase on a sliding backhand volley. The game goes to 15-all, though, 
Murray swiping a forehand into the net. Murray’s under pressure during the next 
rally, but he comes up with the goods with a lovely forehand pass from right to 
left. There haven’t been many of those. Nishikori is undeterred. A confident 
forehand, coupled with an elegant drop shot, is enough for 30-all and Murray’s 
got a lot to think about here, even more so when he bangs a backhand wide to 
give up a break point. He’s been so sloppy at times. But Nishikori can’t punish 
him, wastefully netting a backhand. From deuce, Murray holds.

First set: Murray 5-5 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Yet to face a break point, 
Nishikori is nonetheless serving to stay in the set. He doesn’t seem fussed. A 
crisp forehand winner makes it 15-0. A similarly impressive backhand makes it 
30-0. Then he pulls a forehand wide. 30-15. Murray can’t take advantage of a 
second serve, though, sending a forehand return long to make it 40-15. 
Nishikori double-faults to make it 40-30, but Murray lifts a forehand wide.

First set: Murray 4-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Murray drops a backhand 
too short, allowing Nishikori to wrongfoot him with another singing forehand. 
Murray responds with a forehand winner of his own when Nishikori loses momentum 
after his forehand clips the net, but it’s 30-15 when the world No1 slaps a 
forehand into the net. He makes up for that error with a fierce backhand return 
off a second serve, taking the game to 30-all, but he can’t earn his first 
break point, netting a forehand at the end of a lengthy rally. Nishikori holds 
thanks to a gorgeous drop shot. That was very composed.

First set: Murray* 4-3 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori makes most of 
the running in the first rally, only to irritate himself by leaving a slice too 
low. Damn that pesky net! Murray’s looking more at ease with himself in this 
game, though. An ace makes it 40-0. Nishikori pretty much throws in the towel 
with a joke of a drop shot, which earns the derision of a Japanese journalist 
sitting to my right.

First set: Murray 3-3 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Two superb forehand 
winners lift Nishikori into a 30-0 lead. He’s playing some smooth tennis. 
Murray, not so much. At 30-15, he takes control of the rally with a fierce 
forehand but dumps a simple volley into the net. Nishikori completes a 
comfortable hold to 15 with another forehand winner, Murray rooted to the spot.

First set: Murray* 3-2 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray whacks a serve out 
wide but Nishikori is on to it in a flash and is slightly fortunate to see his 
forehand down the line clip the top of the net and land on Murray’s side. 
Murray thinks about bashing his racket into the ground, but decides against it 
and gets on with winning the next three points with some forceful serving. He’s 
not looking entirely comfortable, though. At 40-30, he twice lets Nishikori off 
the hook, failing to deal with a couple of high defensive lobs, allowing the 
Japanese to make it deuce with a searing forehand winner. Nishikori has a break 
point when Murray nets a backhand. He lost his focus when he led 40-15 and now 
look. He gathers his thoughts, though, and forces deuce by hammering a forehand 
down the line. “Come on No1,” shouts a fan. It makes a change from “Come on, 
Tim!”. Given a chance to hold, though, Murray double-faults. It’s all a bit 
messy at the moment. But he finds his serve again, belatedly holds and bounces 
up and down.

First set: Murray 2-2 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori is too 
aggressive on the first point, going for too much, too soon with a forehand 
that flies long. Murray proceeds to defend superbly during the next rally, even 
retrieving one smash, but there’s nothing he can do when Nishikori plants 
another into the left corner, as much as he tries. The game goes to 30-all. 
Nishikori moves into a 40-30 lead when Murray nets a forehand. Murray barks at 
himself. Nishikori holds.

First set: Murray* 2-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Both players are making 
errors with their forehands, which is why this game is nicely poised at 15-all. 
Another one from Nishikori makes it 30-15. He finds his range with a forehand 
return off a weak second serve, though, and pulls the game to 30-all. Murray’s 
not making many first serves. But a punchy forehand deep into the left corner 
has Nishikori on the run, enabling Murray to leap into an overhead for 40-30. 
He makes life tricky for himself, though, guiding a drop shot into the net to 
make it deuce. It’s a good moment to come up with an ace out wide. Nishikori is 
attacking Murray’s second serve, though, and back we go to deuce. It’s not long 
before Nishikori has a break point, Murray wafting a backhand long. Murray 
saves it with a fine serve down the middle, Nishikori reaching and lifting his 
return long. The Scot is having to absorb a lot of pressure here, but he just 
about pulls himself to safety.

Tok! Tok! Tok! It’s time for the players to warm up. Andy Murray’s wearing a 
cap, despite the fact we’re inside. Let’s hope Tony Soprano isn’t watching.

Preamble

Hello. Any shenanigans with the sound system at the O2 Arena this afternoon 
and Andy Murray might have reason to suspect that someone has let Novak 
Djokovic loose on the controls. Foul play will definitely be afoot if a 
butterfly finds its way on court. Welcome to the strange old world ofAndy Murray
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>, world No1. Those of you who 
have been following closely will be able to recall the curious moment during 
Murray’s US Open quarter-final against Kei Nishikori when, with the Japanese 
down 30-40 at 1-1 in the fourth set, the umpire played a net because of 
electrical malfunction in the court’s sound system that set off a unscheduled, 
distracting noise. Nishikori went on to win the point and the match, with 
Murray frazzled, unsettled and very weary after his exertions at the Olympics.

Murray has, of course, recovered from that defeat. A week later, he went down 
in another five-setter, losing a Davis Cup rubber against the fearsome Juan 
Martin del Potro, but it’s fair to say he’s been in pretty decent form since 
then. He’s on a hot 20-match winning streak and he’ll be on the verge of 
qualifying for the last four of this tournament if he beats Nishikori today, 
having seen off Marin Cilic on Monday. He’ll be confident: he has a 7-2 winning 
record against the Japanese world No5. But Nishikori, who was impressive in his 
opening win over Stan Wawrinka, will know that he can give Murray a headache or 
two. He beat him here two years ago, took him to five sets in the Davis Cup in 
March and made up for his crushing defeat at the Olympics by beating the Scot 
in New York. Interestingly, this is Murray’s first match against a player 
ranked in the top five since his defeat to Djokovic in the French Open final in 
June. It could be a good one.

Play begins at: 2pm.

“I fought really hard,” Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> says. Yep. He’s not quite 
through yet. But the group will be his if Marin Cilic beats Stan Wawrinka 
tonight. Thanks for reading. That was the longest match in this tournament’s 
history. Bye!
 
A barmy match ends with Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> claiming a precious victory, 
which means he’s won his opening two matches in this tournament for the first 
time.Kei Nishikori made him work for it. The world No7 fought brilliantly and 
he had his chances. He can still go through if he beats Marin Cilic on Friday.

Murray gets a roar of encouragement as he gets up from his chair and prepares 
to serve for the match for a second time. He’s relieved to see Nishikori miss a 
backhand return off a second serve. It’s 30-0 when Nishikori goofs a forehand 
return and Murray finally, after three hours and 20 minutes, has three match 
points when Nishikori batters a backhand wide. After a short rally, Nishikori 
sends one final backhand past the baseline and it’s all over at long last!
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 5-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Murray’s 
chuntering at himself as Nishikori prepares to serve. He’s in a foul mood. He 
plonks a backhand long to make it 15-0. Nishikori skips into a 30-0 lead. He 
fancies his chances all of a sudden. A smash makes it 40-15, his feet moving 
again, and he holds to 30. Well. Well, well. Surely Murray isn’t going to chuck 
this way? He’ll serve for the match again.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 5-3 Nishikori (*denotes server): Serving for the 
match, Murray attempts to topple Nishikori at the net. Nishikori stays firm and 
volleys sharply for 0-15. Then he pings a forehand down the line to lead 0-30. 
This isn’t done yet. Murray needs some big serves. He gets a couple to force it 
back to 30-all, moving two points from victory. But Nishikori really isn’t done 
yet. A cracking backhand return earns him a break point. He can’t take it, 
though, a forehand return clipping the top of the net and looping past the 
baseline, but he grabs a second opportunity with a splendid forehand down the 
line. Murray decides now’s the time for a double fault. On we go.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 5-2 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Serving to stay 
in the match, Nishikori lashes a forehand down the line for 15-0. But Murray 
wants this done. This is already his longest ever three-set match - we’re past 
the three-hour mark – and he fights back from 30-0 down, making it 30-all with 
a backhand winner. But Nishikori won’t lie down. He holds and Murray will have 
to serve for the match.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 5-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori’s 
irritation gets the better of him after he pushes a volley wide at 30-15. He 
reacts by hitting the net with his racket. Murray holds to 15 and moves a game 
away from victory.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 4-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori scoots 
into a 30-0 lead. Although he was in a similar position of dominance in his 
previous service game and look how that turned out. He keeps Murray at baying, 
though, hitting through his forehand to move to 40-15. After two missed 
Nishikori forehands, though, it’s deuce. Another one hands Murray a break 
point. At this stage, it’s effectively a match point. Nishikori, looking 
increasingly knackered, double faults and Murray breaks again.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 3-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray begins 
the game sloppily, netting a backhand, but Nishikori matches him by doing a 
horrible job with a forehand that makes it 15-all. Another limp backhand from 
Murray makes it 15-30, but he overpowers Nishikori in the next rally for 
30-all, seeing his big cross-court forehand and raising him. Murray makes it 
40-30 by denting Nishikori’s armour with a zinger of a backhand, racing forward 
to finish the point with a smash, but the game goes to deuce and Nishikori 
earns a break point with some expert volleying. Murray saves it. Nishikori 
can’t do anything with a forehand return, but he has another opportunity when 
Murray fails to catch a forehand cleanly. Again, though, it goes begging, 
Nishikori second best in a drop shot battle. He challenges unsuccessfully and 
it’s deuce. Murray’s looked shattered at times, but he won’t stop fighting. Nor 
will Nishikori, though. Murray’s yet to emerge unscathed from this marathon 
game, although he earns the advantage with an ace down the middle and holds 
when Nishikori nets a backhand.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 2-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): A thrashed 
forehand volley from Nishikori makes it 15-0. Murray’s in the next rally, but 
Nishikori wins it when the net cord favours his backhand. But Nishikori follows 
that up with consecutive double-faults to make it 30-all. Then he wafts a drop 
shot into the net to gift Murray a break point. This is hopeless from 
Nishikori, who needs to regain his focus as soon as possible. Giving Murray 
needless encouragement feels like the wrong tactic. But Nishikori hangs in 
there and he opens up the court with a vicious, angled backhand that allows to 
gambol forward and volley brilliantly for deuce. Murray’s got another chance 
when a backhand pass clips the net and fools the advancing Nishikori, though, 
and the breakthrough arrives when Nishikori’s backhand clips the top of the net 
and drops wide.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 1-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray squeezes 
into a 30-15 lead, threatening to lose the point after an unconvincing smash, 
but taking it when Nishikori pulls a backhand wide. Another Nishikori backhand 
misses the target, Murray forcing the issue, and that’s 40-15. Murray holds to 
30.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 0-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Into a deciding 
set we go, with Nishikori starting it by putting a smash away for 15-0. A 
wayward forehand makes it 15-all, but Murray responds with a couple of scratchy 
shots to make it 40-15. At 40-30, though, Nishikori yawns a drop shot into the 
net, giving Murray an early look at his serve. This has been a long match and a 
long season. I wonder if both players are feeling the strain a bit. Maybe not. 
Nishikori holds thanks to some accurate forehanding.

Serving for the set, Murray’s happy to see Nishikori drag a backhand wide for 
15-0. He’s not so pleased when he double faults or when he nets a backhand to 
make it 15-30. His mood improves when he bashes an ace out wide for 30-all. It 
darkens when he mishits a forehand to give up a break point. A huge serve 
almost takes Nishikori’s right arm off, though, and that’s deuce. Another one 
down the middle sets up a set point. An idiot in the crowd cries out before 
Murray’s about to serve, causing a brief delay; he misses at the first attempt. 
The second one goes in, but Nishikori pulls a drop shot out of his box of 
tricks and Murray nets. He earns a second set point when Nishikori chips a 
return long, but Murray generously nets a backhand drop shot. From deuce, 
Nishikori earns another break point, volleying with aplomb. He can’t take it, 
though, sending a backhand long, letting out a cry of anguish. Can you blame 
him? Moments later, he’s horrified to see a forehand drift long and wide to 
give Murray his third set point. Here comes another long rally. Nishikori goes 
for broke with a forehand into the right corner. It’s called out. It sure looks 
out. Nishikori isn’t so sure. Hawkeye is. Murray’s level!

Second set: Murray 6-7, 5-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Determined to regain 
the initiative, Murray charges into a 15-30 lead, planting a volley out of 
reach. Nishikori remains calm, finding a difficult spot with a backhand down 
the line that forces Murray to net a forehand for 30-all. Nishikori plays the 
next one beautifully, a canny drop shot setting him up for a delicate forehand 
lob for 40-30. That’s so good. The game goes to deuce when Nishikori nets a 
forehand, sparking a spell of outrageously good tennis from both players. 
Nishikori tries another drop shot. This time, though, Murray’s read his mind. 
He scampers forward and crashes a backhand from left to right to earn a break 
point. Nishikori nets a first serve. His second allows Murray to hit a deep 
backhand and Nishikori can’t deal with that, netting his riposte. Murray breaks 
again and will serve to force a third set.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 4-4 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori continues 
to make incursions with his forehand, battering his way into a 0-15 lead. Soon 
it’s 0-30, Murray tamely netting a backhand. A curving serve out wide makes it 
15-30, but Murray gives up two break points with an errant forehand. Nishikori 
glimpses a path back into the set. Murray tries to guide him away from it, 
volleying expertly to save the first break point. Can he send him down the path 
marked deuce? Nope. He approaches the net, but Nishikori’s backhand from left 
to right is too good! There goes the break! Nishikori is right back in this now 
and he’s two games from victory.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 4-3 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori’s forehand 
has been so pure today, another elegant swipe making it 15-0. A simple smash 
takes him to 40-0 and although a stinging backhand return from Murray makes it 
40-15, Nishikori holds to 15.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 4-2 Nishikori (*denotes server): At 0-15, Murray 
plays some good stuff, serving well, clipping a rare backhand winner from left 
to right for a 30-15 lead. At 30-all, Nishikori nets a forehand return and 
Murray holds to 30 thanks to some more accurate serving.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 3-2 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Murray plays a 
string of duff shots to allow Nishikori to hold to love. The intensity has 
dipped a bit.

an ace and moves into a 30-0 lead when Nishikori nets a forehand. He holds to 
love with another ace.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 2-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori holds to 
15. He needed that after a slow start to this set.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 2-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Looking to 
consolidate that break, Murray finds himself down 0-30 as Nishikori pummels a 
backhand return down the line. Good serving takes Murray to 30-all, though, 
before he makes it 40-30 with some solid forehand work. The game goes to deuce, 
but Murray holds with a feathery volley.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 1-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): That’s only the 
second time Nishikori has ever taken the first set off Murray and beat him on 
the previous occasion, which was here two years ago. Murray looks to be in mood 
for a repeat, though, quickly grabbing two break points with a stupendous 
forehand lob. Nishikori saves the first with a fine forehand winner. Murray 
can’t hide his disappointment. But he finally breaks when a Nishikori forehand 
clips the top of the net and deflects long. “Come on!” Murray roars.
 
First set tie-break: Murray* 9-11 Nishikori (*denotes server): To a howl of 
astonishment from the crowd, Murray wallops a forehand wide and Nishikori 
deservedly grabs the first set! Murray’s not been terrible, but he’s not quite 
been at the races and Nishikori has played some outstanding tennis.

First set tie-break: Murray* 6-6 Nishikori (*denotes server): Oh my word! 
Murray saves it amazingly! He tried a drop shot, which was fairly risible. 
Nishikori got there and smashed a backhand from left to right. But somehow 
Murray read it and blocked a backhand down the line and back into the open 
court, Nishikori unable to hurtle back and retrieve it! What a point!

the point with a stunning forehand.
 
First set: Murray 6-6 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Serving to force a 
tie-break, Nishikori is happy to see Murray carelessly waft a backhand slice 
wide for 15-0. For the first time, though, Nishikori wobbles when he dumps a 
smash long for 15-all. He composes himself and spanks a forehand down the line 
for 30-15, but finds himself facing a set point after a couple of missed 
backhands. Murray’s really been biding his time. But then he reverts to bad old 
ways, passively netting a forehand for deuce, before frittering away another 
challenge when he sends a backhand well long. Nishikori double-faults and we go 
back to deuce, but he’s too alert for Murray at the net on the next point, 
judging a lob and putting away a smash. Nishikori holds. Tie-break!

First set: Murray* 6-5 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori suddenly starts 
to leave his shots short and low, a change of tack, but he can’t quite get 
enough purchase on a sliding backhand volley. The game goes to 15-all, though, 
Murray swiping a forehand into the net. Murray’s under pressure during the next 
rally, but he comes up with the goods with a lovely forehand pass from right to 
left. There haven’t been many of those. Nishikori is undeterred. A confident 
forehand, coupled with an elegant drop shot, is enough for 30-all and Murray’s 
got a lot to think about here, even more so when he bangs a backhand wide to 
give up a break point. He’s been so sloppy at times. But Nishikori can’t punish 
him, wastefully netting a backhand. From deuce, Murray holds.
 
First set: Murray 5-5 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Yet to face a break point, 
Nishikori is nonetheless serving to stay in the set. He doesn’t seem fussed. A 
crisp forehand winner makes it 15-0. A similarly impressive backhand makes it 
30-0. Then he pulls a forehand wide. 30-15. Murray can’t take advantage of a 
second serve, though, sending a forehand return long to make it 40-15. 
Nishikori double-faults to make it 40-30, but Murray lifts a forehand wide.
 
First set: Murray* 5-4 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray begins a crucial 
game by zinging an ace down the middle for 15-0. Then he attacks the net, 
challenging Nishikori to pass him. Nishikori nets his backhand. Murray holds to 
15 thanks to some granite serving.

First set: Murray 4-4 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Murray drops a backhand 
too short, allowing Nishikori to wrongfoot him with another singing forehand. 
Murray responds with a forehand winner of his own when Nishikori loses momentum 
after his forehand clips the net, but it’s 30-15 when the world No1 slaps a 
forehand into the net. He makes up for that error with a fierce backhand return 
off a second serve, taking the game to 30-all, but he can’t earn his first 
break point, netting a forehand at the end of a lengthy rally. Nishikori holds 
thanks to a gorgeous drop shot. That was very composed.
 
First set: Murray* 4-3 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori makes most of 
the running in the first rally, only to irritate himself by leaving a slice too 
low. Damn that pesky net! Murray’s looking more at ease with himself in this 
game, though. An ace makes it 40-0. Nishikori pretty much throws in the towel 
with a joke of a drop shot, which earns the derision of a Japanese journalist 
sitting to my right.
 
First set: Murray 3-3 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Two superb forehand 
winners lift Nishikori into a 30-0 lead. He’s playing some smooth tennis. 
Murray, not so much. At 30-15, he takes control of the rally with a fierce 
forehand but dumps a simple volley into the net. Nishikori completes a 
comfortable hold to 15 with another forehand winner, Murray rooted to the spot.

First set: Murray* 3-2 Nishikori (*denotes server): Murray whacks a serve out 
wide but Nishikori is on to it in a flash and is slightly fortunate to see his 
forehand down the line clip the top of the net and land on Murray’s side. 
Murray thinks about bashing his racket into the ground, but decides against it 
and gets on with winning the next three points with some forceful serving. He’s 
not looking entirely comfortable, though. At 40-30, he twice lets Nishikori off 
the hook, failing to deal with a couple of high defensive lobs, allowing the 
Japanese to make it deuce with a searing forehand winner. Nishikori has a break 
point when Murray nets a backhand. He lost his focus when he led 40-15 and now 
look. He gathers his thoughts, though, and forces deuce by hammering a forehand 
down the line. “Come on No1,” shouts a fan. It makes a change from “Come on, 
Tim!”. Given a chance to hold, though, Murray double-faults. It’s all a bit 
messy at the moment. But he finds his serve again, belatedly holds and bounces 
up and down.
 
First set: Murray 2-2 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori is too 
aggressive on the first point, going for too much, too soon with a forehand 
that flies long. Murray proceeds to defend superbly during the next rally, even 
retrieving one smash, but there’s nothing he can do when Nishikori plants 
another into the left corner, as much as he tries. The game goes to 30-all. 
Nishikori moves into a 40-30 lead when Murray nets a forehand. Murray barks at 
himself. Nishikori holds.
 
First set: Murray* 2-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Both players are making 
errors with their forehands, which is why this game is nicely poised at 15-all. 
Another one from Nishikori makes it 30-15. He finds his range with a forehand 
return off a weak second serve, though, and pulls the game to 30-all. Murray’s 
not making many first serves. But a punchy forehand deep into the left corner 
has Nishikori on the run, enabling Murray to leap into an overhead for 40-30. 
He makes life tricky for himself, though, guiding a drop shot into the net to 
make it deuce. It’s a good moment to come up with an ace out wide. Nishikori is 
attacking Murray’s second serve, though, and back we go to deuce. It’s not long 
before Nishikori has a break point, Murray wafting a backhand long. Murray 
saves it with a fine serve down the middle, Nishikori reaching and lifting his 
return long. The Scot is having to absorb a lot of pressure here, but he just 
about pulls himself to safety.
 
First set: Murray 1-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): The first two points are 
shared, both men making errors. Nishikori tries a drop shot, a tactic that 
proved effective in New York, but he can’t lift it over the net. He wins the 
next two points, though, and holds when Murray hoicks a slice long. Murray 
challenges unsuccessfully.

First set: Murray* 1-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): And we’re off! Murray 
begins the serving and a tense rally ensues, ending with Nishikori netting a 
forehand. Murray follows that up with a swinging ace down the middle for 30-0. 
Nishikori fights back to 30-all, though, drilling a backhand down the line. 
Murray creeps in front when Nishikori sends a backhand long and holds to 30.
 
Tok! Tok! Tok! It’s time for the players to warm up. Andy Murray’s wearing a 
cap, despite the fact we’re inside. Let’s hope Tony Soprano isn’t watching.

Here come the players. There’s a sizeable Japanese presence in here, so Andy 
Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> won’t the whole crowd on 
his side this afternoon.

Hello. Any shenanigans with the sound system at the O2 Arena this afternoon 
and Andy Murray might have reason to suspect that someone has let Novak 
Djokovic loose on the controls. Foul play will definitely be afoot if a 
butterfly finds its way on court. Welcome to the strange old world ofAndy Murray
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>, world No1. Those of you who 
have been following closely will be able to recall the curious moment during 
Murray’s US Open quarter-final against Kei Nishikori when, with the Japanese 
down 30-40 at 1-1 in the fourth set, the umpire played a net because of 
electrical malfunction in the court’s sound system that set off a unscheduled, 
distracting noise. Nishikori went on to win the point and the match, with 
Murray frazzled, unsettled and very weary after his exertions at the Olympics.

Murray has, of course, recovered from that defeat. A week later, he went down 
in another five-setter, losing a Davis Cup rubber against the fearsome Juan 
Martin del Potro, but it’s fair to say he’s been in pretty decent form since 
then. He’s on a hot 20-match winning streak and he’ll be on the verge of 
qualifying for the last four of this tournament if he beats Nishikori today, 
having seen off Marin Cilic on Monday. He’ll be confident: he has a 7-2 winning 
record against the Japanese world No5. But Nishikori, who was impressive in his 
opening win over Stan Wawrinka, will know that he can give Murray a headache or 
two. He beat him here two years ago, took him to five sets in the Davis Cup in 
March and made up for his crushing defeat at the Olympics by beating the Scot 
in New York. Interestingly, this is Murray’s first match against a player 
ranked in the top five since his defeat to Djokovic in the French Open final in 
June. It could be a good one.

Play begins at: 2pm.
