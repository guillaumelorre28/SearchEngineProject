Players are habitually told they should rise above the goading of rival fans 
but this proved easier said than done for Anderlecht’s Steven Defour on his 
return to a former club, Standard Liège, on Sunday.

Defour, who played for Standard for five years until 2011 and joined Anderlecht
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> from Porto last year, was 
greeted with a huge banner at Liège’s Stade Maurice Dufrasne adorned with the 
words “Red or Dead”.

During the match a riled Defour, fed up of the goading, responded by belting 
the ball deliberately into a home fans’ section of the stadium, earning a 
sending off. This in turn provoked disturbances in the Anderlecht end, with 
seats hurled on to the pitch.

To complete a miserable afternoon for Defour, Anderlecht lost 0-2.
