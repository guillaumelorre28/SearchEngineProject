They've never met before today, but Alison Steadman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alison-steadman> and Alan Carr strike up 
an instant rapport, exchanging stories about random run-ins with the public. 'A 
woman stopped me recently,' laughs Alison, 'and said, "I love that Gavin & 
Stacey, but don't you look fat in it? Those white trousers you had on last week 
made you look massive!"' 'I know,' sympathises Alan, who hosts The Friday Night 
Project, Channel 4's celebrity entertainment show. 'People say things to me 
that they wouldn't say to their own mother, like, "You've got the same teeth as 
my nan!"' Laughter peals through the studio as they snap away with Polaroid 
cameras, although the photos don't bring out the best in Alan. He mock-cringes 
as one develops, shrieking, 'I look like something from Most Haunted!'

TV hero 

Steadman: David Attenborough. I want him to be my brother, my lover, my 
father, my grandfather, my everything.

Show you wished you'd worked on 

Carr: I want to be Bree's long-lost English son in Desperate Housewives. I 
didn't want to get into it because it's a gay stereotype - and now I want to 
live on Wisteria Lane. I'm obsessed with gingers; I can't stop rubbernecking 
Jenny from The Apprentice. I want to look away but I can't. It's the chin. 
She's so humourless and uncharismatic. I see a lot of myself in her.

First TV memory 

Steadman: Watching the Coronation on TV aged seven. My dad took pictures of it 
with his Box Brownie.
