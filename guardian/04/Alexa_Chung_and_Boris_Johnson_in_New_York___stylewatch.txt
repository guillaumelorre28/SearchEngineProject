Alexa Chung and Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> 
were in New York on Tuesday night for a dinner hosted by the British Fashion 
Council – and how’s this for a tale of two power suits? Johnson looks as though 
he has just rolled off the red-eye, with signature ruffled hair, creased shirt 
and thick City boy tie knot. Chung looks rather more modern in a sleek navy 
trouser suit with – just seen – a cheerful purple and leopard-print clutch. 
When we look at this picture, let’s remember that Chung is a model whose job 
involves manipulating her facial muscles so they look perfectly relaxed in 
unnatural, sometimes precarious, situations. Here, however, she is wincing.
