Nine teenage girls are gathered in a small hut. Razia Sultana, the community's 
Adolescent Girl Group leader passes flash cards around the group. Using the 
illustrations, the girls discuss what they should and should not do during 
menstruation. Shakila,17, enthusiastically divides the cards into good and bad 
piles. It's good to talk to your mum about how you are feeling; it is not good 
to wash rags out near food, or simply discard them. "Before we were shy and 
embarrassed, but not now. With our mothers' and teachers' help, we will talk 
about it more."

Poor menstrual hygiene, most notably the use of dirty rags in place of 
sanitary towels, can cause scabies, urinal infections, abdominal pains and 
complications during pregnancy. The culture of shame creates a taboo around 
these problems in communities across the globe. Bangladesh is something of a 
trailblazer, putting safe menstrual hygiene on the sanitation agenda in slum 
communities.

Benguntila slum's toilet blocks include a larger latrine for women, with an 
area to wash and dry rags. Shakila and her friends welcome the privacy this 
gives them. "Before there was not always space outside to hang rags, but 
there's space in the latrine."

These young women are spreading the safe hygiene messages throughout the 
community. Sabina, 15, quietly observed "My mother didn't go to school; now she 
is learning through me." Shakila sums it up for the group: "We force our mother 
and father to practise hygiene issues ... we all do it now."
