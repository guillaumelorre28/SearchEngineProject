“Heatwaves are the most deadly natural phenomenon in Australia, claiming 
hundreds of lives each year,” AMA Queensland’s president, Dr Chris Zappala, 
said.

Friday is expected to be the hottest December day since 2001, when the mercury 
nudged 40C on Christmas Eve in Brisbane.

“Brisbane had a run of 40C and 39C from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day that 
year,” meteorologist Jeanine Yuasa said.

The hottest day in Brisbane since the turn of the century was 41.7C in 
February 2004.

The heatwave is likely to continue into early next week.
