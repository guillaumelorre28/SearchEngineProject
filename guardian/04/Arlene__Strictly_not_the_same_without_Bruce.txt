Former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arlene-phillips> said Saturday 
night's show just wasn't the same without presenter Bruce Forsyth, who was 
unable to take part because of the flu. "It's not until you haven't got Bruce 
there that you realise how he really is so woven into the programme," said 
Phillips in the Sun. "I think it proved he's pivotal to the series. Bizarrely, 
I thought the show missed him." Ronnie Corbett introduced the show instead. If 
he hadn't been free, presumably they would have got another of Brucie's showbiz 
pals - what's Kenny Lynch up to these days?
