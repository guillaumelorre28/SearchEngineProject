Mac the knife strikes again. John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman since 
April, has form as aslayer of chief executives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/john-mcfarlane-barclays-reputation-antony-jenkins>
. While non-executive director at Aviva in 2012, he helped oust the hapless 
Andrew Moss and filled the chief executive post himself until he found a 
successor and could revert to being chairman.

The demise of Antony Jenkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins>
 at Barclays was presented as a decision of all the non-executives, with the 
deputy chairman, Sir Michael Rake, to the fore, but the final call is always 
the chairman’s. As at Aviva, McFarlane will become stand-in chief executive, 
promising an all-action performance more to the liking of shareholders.

Naturally, investors cheered. They love a no-nonsense boss

 who promises to slash bureaucracy, improve returns, cut costs and tickle the 
dividend. “I have experienced good results in dealing with these matters 
elsewhere”, said McFarlane, less than humbly. Barclays shares rose 3%.

Kind words flowed for Jenkins but the gist of the message was clear: not 
enough energy and too many committees – 375, said McFarlane – meant better 
returns for shareholders were in danger of disappearing over the horizon. The 
new motto is “acceleration”.

Up to a point, one can understand the frustration. Jenkins’ brand of woolly 
management speak often jarred. Few of us ever understood what the ambition to 
build “the go-to bank” really meant. On this view, Jenkins, a retail banker, 
was a useful antidote to Bob Diamond and his crew of muscular investment 
bankers but lacked the dynamism to give the new-lookBarclays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> a bigger kick.

The group’s adjusted pretax profits increased 12% to £5.5bn last year, but 
statutory profits were down 20%. The investment banking division continued a 
miserable run with return on of equity of just 2.7%. “I am not a very patient 
person”, Jenkins declared in March, probably aware that the behind-the-scenes 
muttering said he was exactly that.

But before Jenkins is consigned to history as too ineffectual, consider 
whether McFarlane’s promised hard-driving approach is any clearer. The motoring 
metaphor sounds exciting, but what, for example, does it mean for the 
investment bank? Does it have a future or not?

Hard-driving, in McFarlane’s mouth, does not mean what it did in the old days 
under Diamond. McFarlane will be as aware as Jenkins that the old days brought 
scandal, monstrous fines and disgrace. So is he a sceptic of the overpaid 
investment bankers’ ability to earn their keep? Or does he want to take another 
lap of the track, just in case? Jenkins toyed with the question inconclusively. 
Thus Barclays’ statement that ditching Jenkins “does not signal any major 
change in strategy” fails to solve the great investment banking conundrum. 
Outsiders never knew what the strategy was, or how small the division was meant 
to be, in the first place.

Or is hard-driving code for another dose of old-fashioned cost cutting in the 
retail and commercial banks? There probably will be more of that, just as there 
was at Aviva. But it is not a risk-free strategy if you also want to grow 
revenues. A “leaner and more agile” bank may strike punters as one that is 
understaffed.

Put another way, all banks must serve three masters – regulators, customers 
and shareholders. There is no route around regulators these days, so the 
balance between shareholder and customer demands is critical. McFarlane wants 
happier shareholders, but the trickier task is to satisfy customers 
simultaneously. However much McFarlane plays up the parallels with Aviva, the 
Barclays bus looks harder to handle.

China stock market collapse - time to panic?

This is what you are not allowed to say in China: the stock market is an 
equity disaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/chinese-investors-despair-as-gains-wiped-out-in-tumbling-stock-market>
 and the authorities have failed to rescue the market. The phrases “equity 
disaster” and “rescue the market”, you see, have been banned from market 
reports.

For official consumption, the Chinese Communist party is merely adopting 
sensible measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/08/chinese-investors-feel-the-pinch-as-dramatic-stock-market-losses-mount>
to address a temporary outbreak of irrationality among investors; calm will 
return any day now.

Yeah, right. Big shareholders have been banned from selling for six months, 
and trading in almost half the stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock 
exchanges has been suspended, an attempt to air-brush the fact that the real 
prices would be substantially lower.

It’s hard to guess what the authorities will try next. They have cut interest 
rates, they have shovelled state pension funds into the market, they have 
encouraged investors to borrow to speculate, and they have banned flotations. 
It’s not working because even the most gullible Chinese investor can smell 
panic.


The impossible-to-answer question is why the authorities are so alarmed. It 
was always odds-on that a market that had risen 150% in a year would crack. The 
alarming assumption must be that Beijing thinks a crash would damage the real 
economy, by wiping out a chunk of wealthier citizens’ savings or by spreading 
losses through the banking system.

Whatever it is, Beijing needs the market to obey official orders soon. Share 
prices have been falling for a month and the support operation is becoming 
ridiculous. Another fortnight like the last and Beijing’s only credible policy 
will be to let the market crash and to face the demons it fears.
