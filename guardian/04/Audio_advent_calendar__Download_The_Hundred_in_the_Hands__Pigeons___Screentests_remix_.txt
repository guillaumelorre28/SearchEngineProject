Available for the first time, the next sonic treat on our audio advent 
calendar is this Hunded in the Hands remix. Here's what the band have to say ...

Pigeons has a backstory that feels cinematic but the actual lyric is fractured 
and skeletal. It's the story of a girl living in a city. She's in a rut and 
going a little too far on the weekends. Spends the afternoons with her friends 
in the city centre. Spends the night sneaking out the house and hooking up with 
a boy she has a crush on. It's like a looped narrative, every weekend, the same 
thing. In the end, up on the roof, she looks at the city and the pigeons flying 
above and wonders 'why don't they just fly away?'"
