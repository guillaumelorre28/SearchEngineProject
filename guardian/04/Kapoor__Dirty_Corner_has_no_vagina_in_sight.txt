Your columnist Michele Hanson has got completely the wrong end of the stick (A 
certain age 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/life-and-physics/2015/jun/08/artists-vaginas-anish-kapoor-dirty-corner-versailles>
, 9 June). My work at Versailles is called Dirty Corner and has nothing to do 
with Marie Antoinette or her vagina. Perhaps it would be good for Ms Hanson to 
use her eyes when looking at art, not her ears. There is no doubt that the 
feminist argument must first be put forward by women, but from where I stand 
men cannot and must not be excluded. What a shame that narrow-mindedness has 
space in your journal.
