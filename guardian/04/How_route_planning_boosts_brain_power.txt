After all the train strikes on the Southern rail network, frustrated commuters 
might take some comfort in the fact that planning alternative routes to work 
each day may well have boosted their brain power.

It is well known that taxi drivers have a bigger rear hippocampus than other 
people, especially if they have studied the Knowledge. But this isn’t just to 
do with navigating the streets of a big city. In fact, scientists have found 
that the enlarged part of their brain is most active when they plan their route 
before setting off and while on the road, like programming a human satnav.

In an experiment, Dr Hugo Spiers and his colleagues asked London taxi drivers 
to lie in a brain scanner and play a toned-down version of Grand Theft Auto 
around a simulation of the city’s streets. The biggest activations in the rear 
hippocampus - the bit of the brain responsible for spatial awareness - took 
place when the drivers were forced to plan a detour after the scientists 
blocked off some of the roads.

Perhaps all this inadvertent brain-training, on top of the delays, could push 
some commuters to break out of their routines.
