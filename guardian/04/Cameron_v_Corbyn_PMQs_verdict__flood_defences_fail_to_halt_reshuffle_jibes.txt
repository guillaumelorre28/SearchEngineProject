Key points

After a morning in which two frontbenchers resigned in protest at his shadow 
cabinet reshuffle, it was never going to be an easy PMQs for the Labour leader. 
ButJeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> stuck 
grimly to his guns, pressing the prime minister on flood defences. David 
Cameron pivoted swiftly back to the reshuffle.

Snap verdict

Not a decisive exchange, but a topical, serious one from which both Corbyn and 
Cameron emerged with some credit. Corbyn never really skewered Cameron overhis 
flood spending failures

, but his questions were solid, his tone was appropriate and he refused to be 
thrown by the jibes about the reshuffle. As usual, Cameron tried to steer it 
back to the economy and leadership, but he was also able to make some 
reasonable points about the government’s flood record.

Best lines

Cameron took advantage of the arrival of twelfth night to make a pro-forma 
Shakespearean joke about Love’s Labour’s Lost, but his barb about the length of 
the reshuffle was probably the most effective.

The idea that this individual would be faster in responding to floods when it 
takes him three days to carry out a reshuffle is laughable.

Neither Cameron nor Corbyn had vintage lines, though.
