Guardian writer Amelia Gentleman has been named overall winner at the Counsel 
and Care <http://www.counselandcare.org.uk/home> Older People in the Media 
Awards for her G2 piece, 'Dying days: A day in the life of an old people's home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/14/older-people-care-home>'. 

The awards recognise individuals and organisations that portray older people 
in a way that is sensitive, respectful, diverse and age neutral. Amelia's 
article was chosen from a shortlist which included contributions from The 
Times, Daily Mail and BBC.

The judges said, "Every so often a piece of journalism comes along and does 
more than simply tell a story...This work demonstrates the power of the pen. 
This work has the potential to change things. There could be no worthier winner 
than Amelia Gentleman for 'Dying days'."
