Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
will look into the suicide of a Queensland farmer and anti-coal seam gas 
protester, but warns the issues are almost entirely state-based.

The death of George Bender, a Chinchilla cotton farmer whose underground water 
bores had been affected by CSG activities, has fuelled calls for an inquiry 
into the human impacts of the industry.

Turnbull on Friday said he had received information about Bender’s death from 
broadcasterAlan Jones  <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-jones>and would 
be “looking into it further”.

The prime minister did not elaborate on how this would proceed or to what aim.

But the issue of minerals exploration largely rests with the states, he 
stressed.

“They are almost entirely within the jurisdiction of state governments,” he 
said in Sydney.

“Not entirely but largely, very largely [this] is within the realm of state.”

Turnbull noted the farmer’s death, like all suicides, was “a shocking tragedy”.

He noted many people in rural Australia were enduring difficulties, such as 
ongoing drought in westernQueensland
