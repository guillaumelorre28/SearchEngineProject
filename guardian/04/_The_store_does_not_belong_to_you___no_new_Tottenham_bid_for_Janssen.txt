The 22-year-old, who finished as the top scorer in the Dutch league last 
season with 27 goals in 32 appearances, was the subject of a bid worth €18m 
(£16.5m) from Spurs last month, which was rejected. That led Janssento voice 
his frustration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/30/tottenham-vincent-janssen-disappointed-az-alkmaar>
 at their stance, with AZ believed to be holding out for a fee of €20m – 
reportedly on the advice of the subject of Michael Lewis’s best-selling book 
Moneyball, Billy Beane, who was hired as an adviser in March last year.

However, the club’s sporting director Max Huiberts has denied that Tottenham 
have submitted a new offer and warned they will have to pay their asking price 
if they want to sign Janssen.

“There is a lot of speculation and I read a lot of nonsense stories,” he told 
the Dutch newspaper Noordhollands Dagblad.

“We received one bid from Tottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> that we have not 
accepted. That’s not so strange to me. It is not often that a club agrees 
immediately with a first offer. Then we heard nothing more.”

Asked whether he would be making contact with Tottenham, Huiberts added: “No, 
that’s not us. If you want to buy something, you have to go to the store. The 
store does not belong to you.”

• This article was amended on 7 July 2016. An earlier version said that Billy 
Beane was the author of Moneyball. This has been corrected to say that Beane 
was the subject of Michael Lewis’s book.
