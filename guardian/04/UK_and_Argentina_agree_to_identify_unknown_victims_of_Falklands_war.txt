Britain and Argentina appear to have made significant headway towards 
improving relations after reaching an agreement to identify the bodies of more 
than 100 unknown Argentinian soldiers buried on theFalklands Islands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/falklands> after the 1982 war. 

The two countries also agreed to increase the number of flights between 
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> and the islands, which 
they claim as the Malvinas.


The 74-day war, which began when Argentina seized the islands and Britain sent 
a taskforce to retake them, saw 649 Argentinian and 255 British soldiers, as 
well as three Falkland islanders, lose their lives.


Under the agreement announced on Tuesday, the Red Cross will assemble a team 
of forensic experts, including two Argentinians, who will retrieve DNA samples 
from 123 unidentified Argentinian combatants buried at at Darwin Cemetery on 
East Falkland. The samples will then be compared against the samples taken from 
the volunteer Argentinian families. Work on identifying the remains will begin 
early next year, according to the Argentinian foreign ministry’s statement.
The two governments also announced that talks are proceeding smoothly for the 
opening of extra flights between the South American mainland and the islands. 
FCO minister Sir Alan Duncantweeted 
<https://twitter.com/AlanDuncanMP/status/811259560270974976> that Argentina and 
Britain had “agreed a way forward on new flights from Falkland Islands to Latin 
America”.
Press reports in Argentina indicated that these could include a flight from 
São Paulo, Brazil, and Mount Pleasant airport near Port Stanley, the capital of 
the islands, stopping over at Argentina’s capital city, Buenos Aires.

The Argentinian foreign ministry said in its statement: “Both countries will 
negotiate with the air authorities in Brazil and Chile to determine what the 
stopovers will be.”

At the moment a twice-weekly flight is operated by the British ministry of 
defence from the United Kingdom to the Falklands, as well as a weekly flight 
from Punta Arenas in Chile that makes a monthly stopover at Rio Gallegos in 
Argentina.

Relations between London and Buenos Aires have improved significantly since 
Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, took office a year ago. Macri abandoned 
the confrontative attitude of former president Cristina Kirchner, who 
restricted hydrocarbon exploration in the area around the islands and at one 
point barred sea cruisers bound for the Falklands from docking at Argentinian 
ports.

The agreement was signed in London by Sir Alan Duncan, minister for Europe and 
the Americas at the Foreign Office, and Argentinian foreign deputy minister 
Pedro Villagra Delgado. The signing was attended byFalkland Islands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/falklands> officials.
