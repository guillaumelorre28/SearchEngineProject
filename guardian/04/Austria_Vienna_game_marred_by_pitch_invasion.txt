Austria Vienna's Europa League game Athletic Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> was held up for 25 
minutes after crowd disturbances at the Franz Horr Stadion. The trouble flared 
after Athletic had scored their second goal through Mikel San Jos√© on the hour

Play was initially stopped after objects were thrown on to the pitch and then 
the Athletic players raced to the changing rooms as supporters climbed over a 
fence and invaded the playing surface. Riot police formed a line just outside 
the penalty area while the Austria team spoke with the supporters to try to 
calm the situation.

The game then resumed and the Spain international Fernando Llorente completed 
the scoring with his second goal as Athletic advanced to the knockout stages 
with a 3-0 victory.
