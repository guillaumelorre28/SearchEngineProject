“We have reports of roofs removed at Gatton, swift water rescues at Salisbury 
in Brisbane,” he said. “We have another line of significant storms moving in 
from the west moving into the Brisbane.”

The first storm hit Brisbane’s CBD, Brisbane airport, Nudgee, Samford and 
Albany Creek about 5.25pm, before moving north-east to waters off Bribie 
Island. Another storm cell hit Boonah, Laidley, Gatton, Esk’s west and 
south-west, Burpengary and Brighton about 5.50pm.

Cells then hit Caboolture, Kilcoy and Kingaroy north-west of Brisbane after 
7pm, moving to Maroochydore and Caloundra on the way to Gympie.

The number of Energex customers without power exceeded than 37,000, including 
3,400 in Ipswich and 1,600 in Logan, 1,600 in Brisbane’s CBD, 1,200 in the 
Scenic Rim and more than 1,300 across the Lockyer Valley.

Parts of Queensland are expected to swelter again on Sunday, as a heatwave 
continues to hold most of central and southern Queensland in its grip. However 
south-east Queensland is again expected to be spared the full brunt of the 
system, due to sea breezes.

Birdsville topped 44C on Saturday afternoon, while Roma got above 43C and 
other parts of the state sweltered around 40C.

Weather bureau forecaster Dean Narramore said Sunday would continue the 
heatwave.

“Sea breezes will probably save us on the coast, we’ll get around 30C or 31C 
on the coast, but once we move inland, again we’re looking at those high 30s to 
low-to-mid 40s across much of the inland region.

“It’ll be same again on Monday ... they’ll probably have to wait another four 
or five days of 40-degree heat but we should see some relief across most of the 
state hopefully by the end of next week.”

Authorities were bracing for a day of high fire danger across South Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> on Sunday with 
high temperatures, rising winds and thunderstorms forecast.
