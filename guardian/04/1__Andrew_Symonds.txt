John Holder's official answers: 
1) It is not your decision. The ball belongs to the home club. Permission must 
be obtained for the ball to be given away, because it's essential that used 
balls are kept as spares to be used for other matches in the event of a ball 
becoming unusable or being lost.
2) A twelfth man cannot act as a runner. He can only field. The runner should 
be someone who has already batted. But if the openers are still together, one 
of the tailenders will act as a runner. The runner must wear the same external 
equipment as the striker he is running for, including carrying a bat.
3) Many players eat bananas or energy-giving snacks during drinks intervals, 
so there's nothing preventing someone eating a hotdog. However it's important 
to maintain the image and integrity of the game, so players should be 
discouraged from eating food during such breaks. Several years ago I umpired a 
county match with Barrie Meyer at Hove, coming to the end of the season. With 
Sussex fielding in a game meandering to a tame finish, John Barclay, the home 
captain, ordered alcoholic drinks onto the field. He and his players sat on the
