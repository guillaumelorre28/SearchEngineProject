Not a bright day for a couple of gold miners.

 whileAfrican Barrick Gold has slumped more than 20% after takeover talks fell 
apart.

In August, parent company Barrick Gold Corporation said it was in talks with 
China National Gold Group about a sale of its 73.9% stake in African Barrick. 
Now Barrick has said the discussions have ended, and price appears to be the 
issue:
 [We] will only proceed with opportunities that generate acceptable value for 
Barrick.

African Barrick said the talks had led to an extended period of uncertainty 
for the company as well as significant extra work. It maintains Barrick remains 
committed to supporting the company despite the sale talks.

In the light of these events, African Barrick's board has asked the management 
to conduct an operational review to boost value for shareholders.

It added that even though its operational and financial performance in 2012 
was lower than the previous year, it would hold the total dividend at the same 
level as 2011's $67m. African Barrick's chief executive Greg Hawkins said:
 Whilst the discussions between China National and Barrick have not lead to a 
transaction, the process has re-emphasised the fundamental long-term value of 
African Barrick's portfolio and the scarcity of large scale producing 
opportunities to enter the gold market in Africa. 
Shareholders were not so upbeat however, and the FTSE 250 company's shares 
have dropped 91p to 353p. Kate Craig at Liberum Capital said:
 A disappointing development - we had envisaged a bid at around 550p a share 
versus our net asset value of 418p a share.
