Brad Haddin <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/brad-haddin> is to return to 
Australia to see a specialist about the finger he fractured in the warm-up 
before the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston. He has not yet been ruled out of the 
upcoming one-day and Twenty20 series against England, and a decision on his 
participation will be taken once the injury has been assessed.

Haddin, Australia's wicketkeeper, was replaced after the teams for the third 
Test had been named, with England captain Andrew Strauss asked for his 
permission to allow the late change to be made. Graham Manou came into the side 
for his Test debut – though he also sustained a hand injury during the course 
of the match – but Haddin was deemed fit to retake the gloves for the fourth 
and fifth Tests.

"It has now been decided Brad will return to Australia to allow him further 
recovery time and consultation with specialists to determine the best possible 
management of the injury," said Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris in a 
statement.

"His participation in any of the one-day and Twenty20 components of 
Australia's tour of England and the ICC Champions Trophy will be decided after 
consultation with these specialists."

Although Australia did call up Tasmania wicketkeeper Tim Paine as a precaution 
ahead of The Oval Test, there will be no further additions to the squad at this 
time.
