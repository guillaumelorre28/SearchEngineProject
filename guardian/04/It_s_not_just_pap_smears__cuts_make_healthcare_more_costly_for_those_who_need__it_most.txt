Australian women were rightly outraged this week at reports that as a result 
of the government’s pre-Christmas budget cuts,they might soon be paying a lot

As bad as that sounds, it’s not even close to the worst thing about these 
cuts, which will fall hardest on those least able to pay, such as cancer 
patients, people with serious heart conditions and others with serious and 
life-threatening conditions that require regular tests and scans like MRIs, PET 
and X-rays.

The only defence so far from the government is to insist that the Medicare 
rebate paid directly to pathology patients has not been cut.

This is disingenuous in the extreme.

As the budget papers make clear in black and white, $650m has been ripped out 
of diagnostic imaging and pathology by scrapping bulk billing incentives, and 
the rebate paid for diagnostic imaging has been cut (or “realigned” in the 
Orwellian speech of the budget).

The people who will pay for these are the patients, in upfront costs of 
hundreds, even thousands of dollars, which, even after the Medicare rebate is 
paid, will still leave them hundreds of dollars worse off.

The pre-Christmas budget decision to abolish Labor’s incentives will force 
many pathology clinics and diagnostic imaging practices to abandon bulk billing 
and begin charging patients for scans and tests.

But here’s the catch. Under Medicare rules, any patient charged these fees 
must pay the entire amount up front and then claim back the rebate later.

And these costs are considerable.

According to the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association 
<http://www.adia.asn.au/public/3/files/ADIA%20Fact%20Sheet%20Dec15(3).pdf> 
(ADIA) patients would have to pay up to $93 for an X-ray, $396 for a Cat scan, 
a minimum of $85 for a mammogram and up to $186 for an ultrasound. For those 
unfortunate enough to need a PET scan, the upfront cost could hit $1,000.

But patients with serious conditions never need just one scan. Australia has 
the world’s highest diagnosed rate of melanoma and a typical patient diagnosed 
with the condition would be referred for a PET scan and an MRI scan of the 
brain.

A patient who was previously bulk billed would therefore face upfront costs of 
between $1,352 and $1,656, and be left with out-of-pocket costs of between $90 
and $393 after receiving their Medicare rebates.

And it doesn’t end there. After three months, the patient has a CT scan of the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis, then every six months for two years. Each time they 
would face an upfront cost of $532 to $626, and a gap of between $52 and $145 – 
a total of $2,660 to $3,130 upfront and gaps of $260 to $725.

And if women are outraged about the prospect of paying more for a pap smear, 
what about those who develop breast cancer?

A patient with suspected breast cancer would be referred for diagnostic 
mammography, an ultrasound of the breasts (to distinguish fluid-filled lumps in 
the breast, or cysts, from solid lumps which may be cancerous or benign), and 
based on the results of the ultrasound, may require an ultrasound-guided core 
biopsy.

A patient who was previously bulk billed faces upfront costs of between $282 
and $554 and still be left $29 to $302 out of pocket after receiving all the 
Medicare rebates.

No wonder the ADIA has declared this shock budget attack on patients to be 
worse than former prime minister Tony Abbott’s failed $7 GP co-payment.

We are talking about services that are absolutely essential to diagnosing and 
treating many conditions, and we’re making it harder for people to get. More 
people – especially those with chronic, serious conditions – will not be 
properly assessed. If Medicare exists to help people, this doesn’t make sense.

– Dr Christian Wriedt, president ADIA, 16 December

And that’s just two scenarios. For a typical patient with thyroid cancer, for 
example, a confirmed diagnosis comes after an ultrasound and thyroid function 
test, a follow up ultrasound and pathology, and finally head or body scans.

All up, that comes to around $1,000 in upfront charges. Patients will 
eventually get much of this back from Medicare, but they will still be left 
with hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses.

A person with liver cancer will have a minimum upfront payment of $706 and 
even someone with rheumatoid arthritis will pay $288.

Pap smears will cost after changes to pathology rebates, say Labor and Greens

For many of the patients who are now bulk billed, those costs will be 
unaffordable. We already know that upfront costs are a huge barrier to people 
on limited incomes.

Many patients will delay or even skip crucial scans, or, as is common in the 
US, take out a loan to pay for their treatment.

People who do skip appointments may get lucky and find their condition has not 
deteriorated. But the odds are those who do miss important scans will get 
sicker, require even more extensive treatment and end up costing the health 
system much, much more.

And the costs of such delayed diagnoses go well beyond mere financial pain. A 
recent study by Cancer Research UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/10/cancer-survival-rates-higher-early-diagnosis>
 found almost half of English cancer patients were not diagnosed before their 
disease was at an advanced stage, reducing their chances of survival.

In Britain, those findings have prompted calls for heavier investment in ways 
to improve earlier diagnosis.

Yet in Australia we have a government whose only public health policy, time 
and time again, is to introduce barriers to prevention and the early detection 
of disease.

As pathologists have pointed out, such measures are not only bad for patients, 
but are short-sighted and will cost the health system more in the longer term.

This is a very poor outcome for patients, and will cost the government more in 
the longer term as the diagnosis of disease is deferred as is the opportunity 
for prevention of disease, meaning patients will become sicker without the 
positive interventions provided by the correct pathology diagnosis.

– Liesel Wett, CEO, Pathology Australia, 15 December

While the government has changed leaders, the essential policy remains the 
same – to cut health and shift costs on to patients, only this time in a manner 
that punishes the most seriously ill, at every stage of illness and treatment.
