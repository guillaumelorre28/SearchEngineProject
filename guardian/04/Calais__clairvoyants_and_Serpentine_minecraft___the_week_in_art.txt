 Robert Sappenfield and His Parents by Nicholas Nixon Photograph: Nicholas Nixon
Photographer Nicholas Nixon shared this shot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/09/nicholas-nixon-photography-aids>
 of Harvard student Robert Sappenfield, taken in 1987 when he was dying with 
Aids. “Bob’s parents had come up from New Orleans to see him. Back then, Aids 
was like the plague – if you got it, you died,” says Nixon. “No one was writing 
about the humanity of these men, how they’d been oppressed. That seemed shabby 
to me.”
