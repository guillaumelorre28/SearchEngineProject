Standing in Oliva's neat, low-roofed hut, it is hard not to feel like I have 
entered a crucible where the fight for female education in Africa is being won. 
I have disturbed her revision for the next day's mid-term examinations. "Don't 
worry," she says. "I am already ready."

At just 17, Oliva seems ready for anything. Carved into the thin, white 
plaster above her carefully ordered desk, showing through in letters of gritty 
grey mud, she has written, "What have you come here to do? You have come here 
to study and work hard!" On another wall hangs a government poster offering six 
handy hints on how girls can avoid being raped. Above this, Oliva has carved 
another message: "From 7am until 5pm you are welcome here. Any later and you 
will not be received."

Oliva has good reason to be suspicious of the men who sometimes hang around 
outside her house. She was beaten up after rejecting an offer of school fees in 
return for sex and other men have repeatedly harassed her. She explained how 
the Tuseme Club has encouraged the girls to stick together. "If a boy calls 
from outside we say, 'No, I'm not coming out! Anything you have to say you can 
say to all of us.' Now they're too afraid to come in here. They know what will 
happen to them after Tuseme!"

Oliva is reliant on Camfed for her school fees and rent. She understands why 
they are helping her and is keen to join. "I'd like to be a Camfed 
representative. I'd really, really like that. I want to help others like I have 
been helped."
