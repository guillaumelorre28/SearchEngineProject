If England win their group, and they should, they will play a third-placed 
team in the last 16 and then, potentially, Belgium, Italy orPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> in the quarters. If they don’t 
lose on penalties in the quarters, they could meet Spain in the semis. This is 
all based on them winning their group and other results going as expected. 
Which they never do at a major tournament. So this entry is a complete waste of 
all our time. Sorry.

That’s comfortably the hardest group. It’s still not a Group of Death, mind.

“I’ve read today that Wales and the Republic of Ireland

England because it would be too much of a distraction, with all the media

Sexy football draws

Ruud Gullit, who scored in the 1988 final and coined the phrase “sexy 
football” during Euro 96, is presenting the draw. He has four Very Important 
Flunkies: Antonin Panenka, Oliver Bierhoff, David Trezeguet and Angelos 
Charisteas, all scorers of a European Championship-winning goal.

A second email “Super Victor looks like one of those terrifying giant 
marionettes in the Japanese manga animations, where innocent children morph 
into ghastly dream-like monsters,” says Charles Antaki. “Actually, that would 
liven things up rather nicely.”

Imagine it. “Today’s referee is from Twin Peaks, America, his name is Killer 
BOB.”

(Also, is it me or is Harry Styles now basing his look on BOB?)

An email “Like the 24 teams for Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>, do you do the 24-hour shift 
for the Guardian?” asks Raymond Reardon. “ You were only doing the Aus v 
Windies cricket 10 hours ago. I suppose you have to make up the 4 hours due to 
Aussies finishing it off half way through the afternoon (your morning).”

It’s not just me. They keep 12 of us chained up in the Liveblogging Dungeon, 
with only out of date foie gras, contaminated Evian and an inexplicably 
comprehensive knowledge of Norwich’s 1988-89 season to sustain us.

If you are an idiot, this guide is for you

So, this is how it works. Six groups of four, with the top two going through 
automatically. Then the four best third-placed teams also go through. It’s the 
same format that was used at the World Cup between 1986 and 1994, and means you 
can get through without winning a game – like Uruguay’s “scum of world 
football” in the Group of Death in 1986, or that Dutch rabble in 1990.

France will be team A1, but that’s all we know at this stage. In theory England
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> want to be in Group B, C or D, 
as the winner of those groups will play a third-placed team, whereas the 
winners of Groups E and F will play a second-placed team. Confused? Splendid. 
Now all I need is the long card number, the expiry date and the three-digit 
number on the back of the card.

Group of Death RIP (1980-2012)

It’s one of the best features of any international football tournament. A 
phenomenon that makes grown-ups – even supercentenarians – scrub their thighs 
with their palms in delirious excitement. The Group of Death. But one of the 
consequences of expanding the tournament to 24 teams is that now the worst you 
can really get a Group of Slightly Nagging But Essentially Manageable Anxiety.

I realise it is possible for Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>, Italy, Poland and Wales to be 
drawn together, but don’t forget that four of the six third-placed teams are 
going to qualify for the knockout stage. And even if only the top two were to 
go through, that group would not compare to some of the Groups of Death since a 
group stage was introduced in 1980. Here’s our Joy of Ten: European 
Championship Groups of Death.

Whatever happens, there will be nobody who goes home tonight thinking: ‘We’ve 
got no chance’. There will be six Groups of Life. This is not a good thing.

Euro 80 Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>, Italy, 
England, Spain (only one team qualified, Belgium).

Euro 88 Italy, West Germany, Spain, Denmark.
England, Netherlands, USSR, Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>.

Euro 92 Germany, Netherlands, CIS, Scotland.

Euro 96 Germany, Italy, Czech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Russia.

Euro 2000 Holland, France, Czech Republic, Denmark.
Portugal, Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, England, 
Germany.

Euro 2004 Czech Republic, Netherlands, Germany, Latvia.

Euro 2008 Netherlands, Italy, France

Preamble

Hello. Bonjour. Hola. Ahoj. Ciao. Dia duit. Helo. Përshëndetje. Yeah right, 
like I’m doing that in all 24 languages. It would have been possible to greet 
you in the style of all the finalists before the inaugural tournament in 1960, 
because there were only four of them. It grew to eight in 1980, to 16 in 1996 
and now to 24. For the first time there are three of the Home Nations in a 
European Championship, and theOH SCOTLAND Republic of Ireland are there too.

The draw is scheduled to begin at 5pm UK time, but you know how the Uefa clock 
works. Expect things to get properly under way at around 7pm a week tomorrow. 
I’ll do a proper guide to the draw in a moment. For now here, are the four pots 
from which the six groups will be drawn.

Pot 1


France, Spain, Germany, England, Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>, Belgium.

Pot 2 


Italy, Russia, Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, 
Austria, Croatia, Ukraine.

Pot 3


Czech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Sweden, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary.

Pot 4


Turkey, Republic of Ireland, Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>, Wales, Albania, Northern 
Ireland.

That’s it for the Euro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> 
draw. Analysis from our experts Danny Taylor and Michael Cox will be on the 
site later this evening. Thanks for your company, I’ll leave you with this 
email from Adam Hirst. Night!

“England’s group could be wers.”
 
If England win their group, and they should, they will play a third-placed 
team in the last 16 and then, potentially, Belgium, Italy orPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> in the quarters. If they don’t 
lose on penalties in the quarters, they could meet Spain in the semis. This is 
all based on them winning their group and other results going as expected. 
Which they never do at a major tournament. So this entry is a complete waste of 
all our time. Sorry.
 
Group A France, Romania, Albania, Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>.

Group B England, Russia, Wales, Slovakia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovakia>.

Group C Germany, Ukraine, Poland, Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northernireland>.

Group D Spain, Czech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Turkey, Croatia.

Group E Belgium, Italy, Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>, Sweden.

Group F Portugal, Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>, 
Austria, Hungary.
 
Group E Belgium, Italy, Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>, Sweden.

That’s comfortably the hardest group. It’s still not a Group of Death, mind.
 
Group D Spain, Turkey, Czech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Croatia.

Croatia and Spain met at Euro 2012, of course 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/14/joy-of-six-crosses-david-beckham>
.
 
Group C Germany, Ukraine, Poland, Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northernireland>.
 
Group B England, Russia, Wales, Slovakia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovakia>.

Arise Sir Royston.
 
Group A France, Romania, Albania, Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>.
 
The last six teams are in pot 2. Italy are the ones to avoid. The other teams 
are Russia, Austria, Croatia,Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> and Ukraine.
 
Group A France, Albania, Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>

Group B England, Wales, Slovakia

about that draw lol!Meanwhile Sweden are in with Belgium and the Republic of 
Ireland.
 
Poland are in with Germany and Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northernireland>. Oh dear.
 
England and Wales are joined by Slovakia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovakia>, and they will be Wales’ first 
opponents.

The opening match of the tournament will be France v Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>.
 
Group A France, Albania

Group B England, Wales


Group C Germany, Northern Ireland


Group D Spain, Turkey


Group E Belgium, Republic of Ireland


Group F Portugal, Iceland

 
The Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> are in with Belgium.

England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> will play Wales on a 
Thursday afternoon in Lens by the way, and their first game will be on a 
Saturday evening. No idea who it’ll be against, though.
 
Northern Ireland are in with Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>, and will meet them in their 
opening game!They’ve had some famous wins over them in the past, most notably 
when they beat them home and away during the Euro 84 qualifiers.
 
Wales are in with England!

Yep. That will be the second game for each team.
 
Next out will be the bottom seeds, including Wales, Northern Ireland and the 
Republic of Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>.
 
The draw so far

Group A

France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>

Group B


England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>

Group C


Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>

Group D


Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain>

Group E


Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>

Group F


Portugal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>
 
England are out of the hat first. An early statement of intent. That means 
they are in Group B, and will play in Marseille, Lens and Saint-Etienne.
 
“Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Oh Scotland indeed. I blame UEFA. If 
they’d cut the number of teams in the finals to 8, we’d probably be one of 
them. Or maybe we wouldn’t. But anyway, good luck to England, Wales, Northern 
Ireland,Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>, Glipton Giants and 
all the other qualifiers. Have a great time in France.”
 
Crikey, the draw is about to start. They’re only half an hour behind schedule!
 
Can anyone stop this man’s team from going out on penalties in the 
quarter-finals?

“Well, that’s my childhood gone,” says Damian Clarke. “Papa Smurf’s had a 
shave.”
 
“I’ve read today that Wales and the Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> both hope to avoid 
England because it would be too much of a distraction, with all the media 
attention,” says Phil Grey. “Maybe that’s been England’s problem for the last 
50 years. Whoever they get, there will be too much media attention...”
 
Ruud Gullit, who scored in the 1988 final and coined the phrase “sexy 
football” during Euro 96, is presenting the draw. He has four Very Important 
Flunkies: Antonin Panenka, Oliver Bierhoff, David Trezeguet and Angelos 
Charisteas, all scorers of a European Championship-winning goal.
 
A second email “Super Victor looks like one of those terrifying giant 
marionettes in the Japanese manga animations, where innocent children morph 
into ghastly dream-like monsters,” says Charles Antaki. “Actually, that would 
liven things up rather nicely.”

Imagine it. “Today’s referee is from Twin Peaks, America, his name is Killer 
BOB.”

(Also, is it me or is Harry Styles now basing his look on BOB?)
 
An email “Like the 24 teams for Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>, do you do the 24-hour shift 
for the Guardian?” asks Raymond Reardon. “ You were only doing the Aus v 
Windies cricket 10 hours ago. I suppose you have to make up the 4 hours due to 
Aussies finishing it off half way through the afternoon (your morning).”

It’s not just me. They keep 12 of us chained up in the Liveblogging Dungeon, 
with only out of date foie gras, contaminated Evian and an inexplicably 
comprehensive knowledge of Norwich’s 1988-89 season to sustain us.
 
The inaugural European Championship was held in France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> 55 years ago, and here’s what 
happened.
 Bob O'Hara (@BobOHara) 
.@robsmyth0 <https://twitter.com/robsmyth0> Now I think about it, are you sure 
Michel Platini isn't inside that Super Victor suit?

If you are an idiot, this guide is for you

So, this is how it works. Six groups of four, with the top two going through 
automatically. Then the four best third-placed teams also go through. It’s the 
same format that was used at the World Cup between 1986 and 1994, and means you 
can get through without winning a game – like Uruguay’s “scum of world 
football” in the Group of Death in 1986, or that Dutch rabble in 1990.

France will be team A1, but that’s all we know at this stage. In theory England
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> want to be in Group B, C or D, 
as the winner of those groups will play a third-placed team, whereas the 
winners of Groups E and F will play a second-placed team. Confused? Splendid. 
Now all I need is the long card number, the expiry date and the three-digit 
number on the back of the card.
 
The future’s yours but the past was mine

Get in the mood for Euro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> 
by taking a spin in the DeLorean. Here are some highlights of European 
Championship past:

Group of Death RIP (1980-2012)

It’s one of the best features of any international football tournament. A 
phenomenon that makes grown-ups – even supercentenarians – scrub their thighs 
with their palms in delirious excitement. The Group of Death. But one of the 
consequences of expanding the tournament to 24 teams is that now the worst you 
can really get a Group of Slightly Nagging But Essentially Manageable Anxiety.

I realise it is possible for Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>, Italy, Poland and Wales to be 
drawn together, but don’t forget that four of the six third-placed teams are 
going to qualify for the knockout stage. And even if only the top two were to 
go through, that group would not compare to some of the Groups of Death since a 
group stage was introduced in 1980. Here’s our Joy of Ten: European 
Championship Groups of Death.

Whatever happens, there will be nobody who goes home tonight thinking: ‘We’ve 
got no chance’. There will be six Groups of Life. This is not a good thing.

Euro 80 Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>, Italy, 
England, Spain (only one team qualified, Belgium).

Euro 88 Italy, West Germany, Spain, Denmark.
England, Netherlands, USSR, Republic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland>.

Euro 92 Germany, Netherlands, CIS, Scotland.

Euro 96 Germany, Italy, Czech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Russia.

Euro 2000 Holland, France, Czech Republic, Denmark.
Portugal, Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, England, 
Germany.

Euro 2004 Czech Republic, Netherlands, Germany, Latvia.

Euro 2008 Netherlands, Italy, France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, Romania.

Euro 2012 Germany, Portugal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>, 
Denmark, Netherlands.
 
Hello. Bonjour. Hola. Ahoj. Ciao. Dia duit. Helo. Përshëndetje. Yeah right, 
like I’m doing that in all 24 languages. It would have been possible to greet 
you in the style of all the finalists before the inaugural tournament in 1960, 
because there were only four of them. It grew to eight in 1980, to 16 in 1996 
and now to 24. For the first time there are three of the Home Nations in a 
European Championship, and theOH SCOTLAND Republic of Ireland are there too.

The draw is scheduled to begin at 5pm UK time, but you know how the Uefa clock 
works. Expect things to get properly under way at around 7pm a week tomorrow. 
I’ll do a proper guide to the draw in a moment. For now here, are the four pots 
from which the six groups will be drawn.

Pot 1


France, Spain, Germany, England, Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>, Belgium.

Pot 2 


Italy, Russia, Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, 
Austria, Croatia, Ukraine.

Pot 3


Czech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Sweden, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary.

Pot 4


Turkey, Republic of Ireland, Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>, Wales, Albania, Northern 
Ireland.
 
Rob will be here from around 4pm. In the meantime, why not read Owen Gibson’s
