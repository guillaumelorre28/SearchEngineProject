Sean FitzPatrick

Commonly known as Seanie Fitz, the most famous of the Anglo Irish Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-irish-bank> trio on trial, was the 
chairman of the financial institution that became the lender of choice to 
Ireland's big builders and property speculators. The silver haired, suavely 
suited Sean FitzPatrick was declared bankrupt two years after he resigned from 
his post at the very top of the bank.

Pat Whelan

Pat Whelan headed up Anglo Irish's lending division and oversaw the billions 
of loans to speculators and property investors during the boom years. Up to its 
crash in September 2008 Whelan was still being paid an annual salary of 
€650,000 (£537,000). At the end of 2009 it emerged in the bank's own annual 
report that he himself owed nearly £6m in personal loans from Anglo Irish. He 
remained working at the bank until December 2009.

William McAteer

Donegal born William McAteer earned €1.4m in the year preceding the bank's 
collapse. At the time of the emergency nationalisation of the bank McAteer was 
its chief risk officer. Just months before the crash Anglo Irish gave him a 
loan worth €8m to pay off another loan without losing his shares in the bank.
