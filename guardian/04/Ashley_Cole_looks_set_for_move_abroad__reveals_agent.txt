The former Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ashley-cole> is in talks with several 
clubs, all of which are based abroad, his agent has confirmed.

The 33-year-old left-back is a free agent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/20/ashley-cole-offers-eight-clubs-chelsea-transfer-psg-monaco>
 following his release by Chelsea this summer and has been linked with various 
sides, including other Premier League teams as well as overseas outfits.

Reports have suggested a move to the Italian club Roma could be close.

Cole’s agent, Jonathan Barnett, said on Sunday: “The situation is that we are 
talking to several clubs. At the moment it is only clubs based abroad – there 
may be other developments, but for the moment, that is all we are talking.”

Barnett would not be drawn on the potential timescale in terms of any deal 
being completed.

Cole spent eight seasons with Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, during which he won the 
Champions League, Europa League, Premier League and four FA Cups.

He has 107 England caps and announced his retirement from international 
football in May when he was left out of his country’s World Cup squad.
