You know that friend who always seems to be wearing the thing you vaguely had 
your eye on before you got round to buying it? The celebrity equivalent isAlexa 
Chung <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung>. A case in point at the 
launch of her second AG Jeans range on 14 July: this button-down skirt, styled 
with a polka-dot lady blouse. It’s a shape we have been musing on for a while. 
In catwalk terms it’s quite Saint Laurent, very Vuitton, a bit 1970s. But 
speaking practically, it’s a fairly casual way to cover your bottom, but not 
your legs, this summer, when you’re not one for midis, cut-off shorts or 
micro-minis. The problem is that now, if we buy it, it will look as if we are 
copying her. Chung wins again.
