Martha Stewart <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/martha-stewart>, 
America’s do-it-yourself darling, has set her sights on a huge new market: 
China.

Speaking at New York Social Media Week this week, Stewart said that she is 
seeking international expansion for her eponymous lifestyle media and 
merchandising business, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.

She said she plans to focus on middle-class consumers in China on the 
suggestion ofAlibaba <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba> founder 
Jack Ma, whom Stewart met last year and whom she called a “brilliant, brilliant 
person”.

He pointed to her success at tapping into the middle-class market with Kmart 
in the 1990s and 2000s, and told her: “‘Martha, what you did there’ - at Kmart 
in the early days - ‘is absolutely appropriate for what’s going on inChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> now. We have a middle class of 100 
million.’”

Among China’s population of 1.37 billion, the middle class has been booming. 
In 2000, just 4% of urban Chinese households earned between $9,000 to $34,000 a 
year,found McKinsey & Company 
<http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/consumer_and_retail/mapping_chinas_middle_class>
. By 2012, 68% were earning as much. By 2022, McKinsey predicts that number 
will grow to 75%.

“It’s growing so rapidly,” she said. “But he said within five years, there 
will be 300 to 400 million middle-class [people] coming from the country to the 
urban centers, moving into apartments from the farm houses and they need stuff. 
And they need to be able to afford this stuff.”

Stewart began her business as a small catering company back in the 1970s. In 
1987,Kmart hired her as a consultant 
<http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-martha-kmart-pix-photo.html>, and 10 years 
later, she launched the Martha Stewart Living Everyday line, which sold $1.6bn 
of products at Kmart stores 
<http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/09/16/martha-stewart-says-kmart-is-a-bad-thing/>
at its peak in 2002. In 2008, right before Stewart and Kmart failed to renew 
their two-decade-long partnership, sales from Martha Stewart Everyday products 
sold at Kmart accounted for 10% of the company’s total revenue,according to The 
New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/business/17martha.html?_r=0>.

“I was the first kind-of-upscale brand that went mass,” she said. “And we went 
mass because I really did believe that the masses – the middle class and the 
lower middle class – had every right to have well-designed, beautifully 
engineered and well-made and affordable bedding, housewares and glassware for 
your table and dishes and all of that stuff.”

But now the Martha Stewart brand has grown bigger than its business, and the 
business needs to catch up, she said.


Approximately 30% of her brand’s Facebook followers live outside the US, she 
said. Many of her 3 million Twitter followers also live overseas.

Here are five other things we learned about Stewart from her talk:

She likes drones

I love my drones. I don’t know if all my neighbors love my drones. One of my 
drones got stuck up in a neighbor’s tree and that was kind of embarrassing to 
go and retrieve it.”

Stewart has a collection of drones. She received her first one two years ago 
as a gift for her birthday, and uses her drones to photograph her 150-acre farm.

While a drone can be a “very useful tool”, she said, she mostly considers them 
toys. At the end of her talk, Stewart participated in a drone jousting 
competition, which she won.

She was an early investor in Google ... and also Home Grocer

“I was one of the first investors in Google, through Kleiner Perkins,” she 
told the audience. “That was the big success ... I invested even more money in 
Home Grocer and that was a total flop.”

She also invested in Amazon early on.

Her investments previously came under spotlight

She wants to use tech to save time, but it doesn’t always

I started dreaming a long time ago about what computers could do for us, and I 
must say I have been very disappointed in what they can do for us.”

When personal computers first hit the market, she said, “My first thing was: 
‘Oh my gosh, this is going to save me so much time, to make time to go do other 
things.’ And guess what? How many hours do each of us spend sitting in front of 
our goddamn computer every single day?”

Stewart pointed at an audience member. “Look at him looking at his handheld 
thing there. It’s just horrifying that we really are not using them to [our] 
best advantage yet. It will happen.”

That said, one of the new technologies that can save businesses time and money 
are 3D printers, Stewart said. After being charged hundreds of dollars by 
companies that printed her products’ prototypes, she decided to get her own 3D 
printer.

“We can now do it for pennies,” she said. “So it does save money. And it’s a 
good business investment to get some sort of 3D printer.”

 “My mom always told me I could do whatever I wanted to do, and I took her 
really seriously,” says Jenny Lawton, CEO of 3D printer company MakerBot. 
Last year, Stewart announced a partnership with 3D printing startup MakerBot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/feb/24/141117guardianmakebotv2fromguamrm>
, which was bought byprofessional-grade 3D printing firm Stratasys 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/makerbot-to-be-acquired-by-stratasys-2013-6> in 
2013. Sheintroduced her own line of 3D printed housewares 
<http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2014/11/17/martha-stewart-technology-palette-imagination/>
 and MakerBot filament in her favorite colors: jadeite, robin’s egg and lemon 
drop.

She spellchecks on Twitter

Asked for etiquette tips on how to stay classy online, Stewart advised the 
audience to try not to misspell on social media.

“You’ve to be really careful not to misspell, because then they think you are 
drunk,” she said. “For some reason, they always say, ‘How much wine did you 
have, Martha?’ or ‘How many martinis did you have?’”

Then the other thing about staying classy online is don’t read a lot of what’s 
being written to you, because it’s not all very nice. And never look at the 
pictures. You don’t know what I’ve gotten. Oh. ... I can just imagine what Kim 
Kardashian gets.”

‘You can do just about everything’

I get unsolicited advice every single day. But I think it was my father - he 
was a really good guy - and he said, when I was very very young: ‘If you apply 
yourself you can do just about everything.’ And he is right.”
