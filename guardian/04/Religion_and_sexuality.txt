"Every week on Wednesdays and Fridays I go into a trance and people come to me 
for advice," says Sweetie, sitting cross-legged on the carpet at a drop-in 
centre in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

Sweetie is a "Shiva Shakti", one of tens of thousands of transgender people 
and kothis who belong to a Hindu sect in Andhra Pradesh. They believe 
themselves to be the wives of Shiva, the Hindu god.

"The goddess comes into me and I go into a trance." says the 23-year-old. 
"It's not a choice to become a Shiva Shakti, we are chosen by God."

Sweetie was born a man but had a sex-change operation five years ago. She 
lives happily with her parents and is respected by the local community. She 
escapes the discrimination that afflicts other transgender people since it is 
auspicious to be a Shiva Shakti.

Every autumn, thousands of Shiva Shaktis are ritually married to Lord Shiva at 
special temples during a three-day festival. Around 50,000 other men who have 
sex with men and transgender people also come to the festival. It is an 
opportunity for them to be themselves, to wear saris and to relax, says Sweetie.

As homosexuality is expressed freely at the festival it is a good time for 
community groups and NGOs, supported by the Alliance for Aids Action, to do HIV 
prevention work there. They organise sexually transmitted infection treatment 
camps and give counselling, information and condoms.
