The alleged killers of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya> have gone on trial, but 
her children are refusing to participate.

Ilya and Vera Politkovskaya issued a statement saying: "We refuse to come to 
court, refuse to give any kind of testimony, and also refuse to acknowledge as 
legitimate any of Judge Melekhin's actions in the consideration of this 
criminal case."

They said they had waited nearly seven years for a trial that was now 
"patently illegitimate".

Having been excluded from jury selection, they called on the chosen jurors to 
recuse themselves.

Dmitry Muratov , the editor of Politkovskaya's former paper, Novaya Gazeta, 
said he supported the children's decision to boycott the trial.

"We are not doubting the jurors," he said. "We do not trust the procedure by 
which the jurors were selected so frenetically and rapidly."

Politkovskaya was shot dead in the entrance to her Moscow apartment block in 
October 2006.

All five defendants, who include four members of the same Chechen family, deny 
the charges. Three of them were acquitted of the murder four years ago, but 
that verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court.

Lom-Ali Gaitukayev is accused of organising the killing while one of his 
nephews, Rustam Makhmudov, is suspected of being the gunman.

Two other nephews, Ibragim and Dzhibrail Makhmudov, and a former policeman, 
Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, are accused of being accomplices.

Last December, a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was convicted of 
supplying the murder weapon after agreeing a plea bargain, and was sentenced to 
11 years in jail.
