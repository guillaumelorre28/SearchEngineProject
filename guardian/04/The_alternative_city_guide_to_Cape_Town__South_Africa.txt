Overview


 By Nechama Brodie <https://twitter.com/brodiegal>, author of The Cape Town 
Book 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cape-Town-Book-Companion-History/dp/1920545980/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454916260&sr=8-1&keywords=the+cape+town+book>

Cape Town is often described as being like a European city, as if this were 
something African metropolises should aspire to. In some ways it is not an 
entirely inaccurate description. The compact city centre, hemmed in by the 
harbour and the curve of Table Mountain, Lion’s Head and Signal Hill, is almost 
entirely walkable. Or, if you prefer, it’s also an easy trip on aMyCiTi 
<http://myciti.org.za/en/home/> bus or a hop-on, hop-off open-top Red Bus 
<https://www.citysightseeing.co.za/cape-town>.

The “grachts” – Buitengracht, Heerengracht, Keizersgracht – all sit above what 
were once freshwater canals, running from the mountain to the sea (gracht is 
the Dutch word for canal). The early Dutch-era street grid has been overlaid 
with later Victorian structures, and there are clusters of 20th-century brutal 
modernist buildings pointing towards the Foreshore (which is built on land 
reclaimed from the sea).

Long Street has an assortment of bars, clubs, backpackers’ lodges, shops and 
restaurants. Just two blocks up, Bree Street, particularly between Buitensingel 
and Strand, is a little less frenetic and much more stylish. And there are 
hundreds of other little spots to be discovered, not just on the trio of Long, 
Bree and Loop Streets, but in the side alleys in between.

The problem with labels like “European”, though, is that, in South Africa, 
they tend to function as a euphemism: rather than positioning Cape Town as a 
majority black, multicultural space in transition, it perpetuates the 
misconception that the settlement started in 1652 with the arrival of white 
colonisers. Organisations such asFuture Cape Town <http://futurecapetown.com/> 
and theCape Town Partnership <http://www.capetownpartnership.co.za/> offer 
exciting glimpses of an alternative, integrated Cape Town of the future.


Cape Town is trying to reconnect its myriad pasts and peoples, and it’s all 
the more wonderful (and welcoming) when seen as a whole rather than just 
picture-perfect postcards of exclusion. The independently runDistrict Six Museum
 <http://www.districtsix.co.za/> is a small but superb centre of memory, that 
looks at both loss and restitution.

East of the centre, the working-class, industrial areas of Woodstock and Salt 
River are also being transformed, but this time through parallel programmes of 
urban regeneration and the almost unavoidable knock-on of gentrification. 
Albert and Victoria Roads now have pockets of cool hipsterdom: artisan coffees, 
design houses, art galleries. As a starting point, theWoodstock Exchange 
<http://woodstockexchange.co.za/> is an enjoyable and central mixed-use spot. 
For those interested in graffiti and street art, Woodstock boasts a number of 
rather glorious murals – but those looking for something a little more 
authentic might want to try one of wheatpaste artist Grant Jurius’sstreet art 
tours <https://www.facebook.com/thestreetisthegallery/> of the Westridge 
neighbourhood, in Mitchells Plain, to the south.

There aren’t enough places to play jazz in Cape Town. Tagore’s 
<https://www.facebook.com/Tagores-196657533678635/info/> in the Observatory 
neighbourhood is a little underground kind of venue. We used to play there when 
we left university – it was the kind of bohemia we were looking for: a place to 
be frantic, crazy, experimental. We’d play four or five nights a week for 
virtually no money. If there were 20 people, the entire place was full. But it 
intrinsically had this creative nature, with a lot of free-thinkers.

Straight No Chaser <https://www.facebook.com/straightnochaserclub/> (formerly 
The Mahogany Room) on Buitenkant Street is still standing after three years. It 
was opened by some of my colleagues and friends, as a place for music, by 
musicians. There’s a certain charm if you are an artist performing there. It is 
set up for us to do our thing and experiment, without being burdened by crowd 
responses as in other more formal places. The very nature of this music we call 
jazz is in the smaller spaces. Having played around the world, in more 
so-called formal settings, these kinds of places create energy and good 
vibrations. It helps the music, and feeds us, so we can play some crazy stuff.


There’s a sort of University of Cape Town jazz students’ night at the Great 
Wizoo <https://www.facebook.com/GreatWizoo/> in Rondebosch. There’s quite a 
vibe there, with lots of students, and people who actually don’t like jazz, 
spending an evening enjoying it. It’s interesting that, when it comes to 
improvisational or jazz music, you still find a lot of young people in the 
audiences in South Africa. It kind of says: jazz in South Africa has urban 
appeal where in other parts of the world it’s regarded as a “classic” form.

The annual Cape Town International Jazz Festival 
<http://www.capetownjazzfest.com/> is one of the top three jazz festivals in 
the world, but this city has a rich jazz history beyond the harbour and the 
foreshoresuch asJazz in the Native Yards 
<https://www.facebook.com/Jazz-in-the-Native-Yards-560410047415540/>, in 
Gugulethu, andMoholo Live House <http://www.mohololivehouse.co.za/> in Langa. 
Local tour operator Coffeebeans Routes offers aJazz Safari 
<https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/56b9ebf2e4b00fd8d131a33d>, which 
actually takes you to musicians’ houses. There is so much love for jazz in 
these communities.


 To hear the sound of Cape Town, listen to Abdullah Ibrahim’s Mannenberg. I 
love that piece, as irritatingly famous as it is. I always come back to it 
after a period when I haven’t heard it for a long time. He has made subsequent 
recordings, but I’m talking about the original one, from 1977. Man, that’s got 
that thing. Whatever that thing is.

It’s best to only buy and eat legal, sustainably caught produce: check this 
out using theSouthern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative 
<http://wwfsassi.co.za/> Mobile App <http://www.sassiapp.co.za/>. I usually get 
fresh fish fromThe Little Fisherman <http://www.thelittlefisherman.co.za/> in 
Newlands and Lakeside.Ocean Jewels 
<http://woodstockexchange.co.za/index.php/ocean-jewels/> in Woodstock also has 
an amazing offering. For classic fried fish and chips, go toFish on the Rocks 
<http://www.fishontherocks.com/> at the end of the Hout Bay harbour. Just watch 
out for the seagulls: if you don’t hold on to your chips, they’ll come and 
steal them. I wouldn’t normally send visitors to the shopping mall at theV&A 
Waterfront <http://www.waterfront.co.za/>, but Den Anker 
<http://www.denanker.co.za/> restaurant is outside, right on the water’s edge 
with a magnificent view of the mountain, and makes excellent Belgian-style
moules marinières.

 Hogshouse Brewing Company. Photograph: Shaun Swingler 
 I like to drink And Union <http://www.andunion.com/en/> beers: it’s a South 
African brand, though not brewed locally. The local craft beer scene is pretty 
good andgetting better, but it lacks consistency. TheViper Lounge South 
<http://www.viperlounge.co.za/> in Glencairn is a biker bar for everyone, and a 
great place for a beer. It’s the perfect stop after a ride around the 
peninsula. TheHoghouse Brewing Company 
<https://www.facebook.com/The-Hoghouse-Brewing-Company-1521276694827185/> in 
Ndabeni makes its own beers, but I go for its Texan-style BBQ: brisket, pork 
belly, lamb, and all the sides.

 The nice thing about working where I do, on Bree Street, is that you can get 
absolutely anything – batteries, tyres, a car service, shoes, clothes, steak 
and chips …Chef’s Warehouse <http://www.chefswarehouse.co.za/> at number 92 is 
unbelievable, if you can get a table (it doesn’t accept bookings).

 When visiting a city, one of the first things I do is find an art gallery for 
the perspective it provides on that culture. In Cape Town we have some 
excellent contemporary places, such asWhatiftheworld 
<http://www.whatiftheworld.com/> and Stevenson <http://stevenson.info/>, but 
these mostly focus on single artist shows rather than a broad contextual sweep. 
I like theBoerneef Collection 
<http://www.janvanriebeeck.co.za/welgemeend/welgemeend.htm>, at Welgemeend in 
the Gardens district. It’s small and old-fashioned, and you get a spread of the 
early South African aesthetic through artists such as Irma Stern, Erik 
Laubscher and JH Pierneef.

Chandler House <https://www.facebook.com/chandlerhouse/>, is a treasure trove, 
with well-selected paintings, knicknacks and furniture alongside his own 
ceramics, his handmade Cape of Good Soap bars of soap, and greeting cards cut 
out like Cape Dutch gables. The style is very much colonial-historical but I 
love the contemporary way he is claiming it.

 The Guild Design Fair <http://www.guilddesignfair.com/> (the next one will be 
in 2017) is an impressive showcase of high design that skirts the intersection 
with fine art.Southern Guild <http://www.southernguild.co.za/>’s gallery has 
regular shows of Guild-featured designers at its Woodstock premises.

 There’s wonderful street design happening all over the place, but Capetonians 
see it so often that it’s become part of the urban familiar. However, on the 
corner of Camp and Upper Orange streets, I sometimes see a man who makes 
life-size, beautifully constructed animal trophy heads out of cane. They are 
truly spectacular, and his neighbour, who constructs tiny Land Rovers and 
motorbikes from drinks cans, is also a showstopper.

Heartworks <http://www.heartworks.co.za/> works with southern African 
craftspeople, selling a dizzying array of small decorative objects in its 
stores. Margaret Woermann, who started the shop, has a collection of her 
spectacular pressed-flower creations hanging in the tea room at theMount Nelson 
hotel <http://www.belmond.com/mount-nelson-hotel-cape-town/>. The Kraal Gallery 
<http://www.thekraalgallery.com/>, 50km out of town on the N2 past Strand, is 
also interesting for the fine woven African rugs it produces.

 I love the places in Cape Town where sheer persistence can yield hard-won 
treasures. Gilles de Moyencourt’sHaute-Antiques 
<https://www.facebook.com/HauteAntiques/> in Woodstock is crammed with 
extraordinary things, from African artefacts to Victorian parasols to 1950s 
garden furniture. The weekly car boot sale at theMilnerton Market 
<http://www.milnertonfleamarket.co.za/> is wedged between the highway, the 
railway line and the ocean, and can be full of treasures … or just loads of 
Tupperware and old pliers. But it’s also quite a nice way to see a 
cross-section of Cape Town’s residents. On a good day, you can discover 
modernist light fittings or Swedish dining chairs. And you can always be 
guaranteed to find a boerewors roll or vetkoek (fried bread).

 We’re constantly faced with aerial and spatial perspectives of Cape Town from 
one side. The viewing deck on the top of Lookout Hill in Khayelitsha township 
to the south-east gives a different angle. It puts Khayelitsha’s challenges in 
perspective and allows you to see how fragmented even this part of the city is: 
it’s not homogenous. For a look at urban use and design, visit theKhayelitsha 
Multi Purpose Centre 
<http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/South%2520Africa/Cape%2520Town/Khayelitsha%2520Multi-Purpose%2520Community%2520Center/?utm_expid=3171585-1.pFu_x39wQKuggy22EudlKA.0&utm_referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com>
 designed byMokena Makeka <http://www.makekadesigns.com/>, or the new Empower 
Shack <http://u-tt.com/project/empower-shack/> housing project by Urban 
ThinkTank.

 Also in that part of town is Philippi Village 
<http://www.philippivillage.co.za/>, in an old cement factory. The abandoned 
space has been repurposed into an entrepreneurial and recreational/retail hub. 
I would also visit the Philippi Horticultural Area, a 3,000-hectare site west 
of Jakes Gerwel Drive that produces 50% of the city’s fruit and veg, but is
under threat from development 
<http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/citys-breadbasket-threatened-1977911>.

 The farm at Erf 81 
<http://futurecapetown.com/2014/07/city-of-eden-walking-tours/#.VrQ7JPFN0_c> in 
more central Tamboerskloof, is another interesting area because it’s not 
legally “allowed” to be used the way it is used – developers want to build on 
this part of the city where land is valuable. There is a small garden there, 
and a food market.

 The Cape Town Stadium 
<http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/CapeTownStadium3/Pages/default.aspx> in Green 
Point has a bad reputation for all the wrong reasons. It’s an architectural and 
engineering marvel, and the argument has been reduced to “how do we make more 
money?” I compare the new stadium with what I experienced growing up: an old 
athletics stadium that was falling apart. I’m excited about how the new 
building, both for the structure itself and for surrounding areas, will become 
a more multi-purpose space, possibly including a museum, shops, markets, 
offices, restaurants and more.

 The Sea Point Promenade 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Pages/SeaPointpromenadegetsfacelift.aspx> is 
where people from all over the city can get some sense of common ground. It’s 
designed to handle five times as many people as it does, although this gets 
tested in the last week of the December holiday season, when people spill out 
into a space they feel they can claim. .

Green Point Park 
<https://www.facebook.com/Greenpoint-Park-and-Biodiversity-Garden-179230205451783/>
 has a small (less than a hectare) but very well put-together indigenous 
garden, with examples of local vegetation types as well as medicinal and useful 
plants.Rondebosch Common 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/parks/Pages/RondeboschCommon.aspx> is also 
worth a visit, especially in spring (between August and October, depending on 
the rain). The flowers can be quite spectacular, which is incredible given its 
past: it served as a military campand cricket fields.

 The Tygerberg Nature Reserve 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/Pages/NatureReserve-Tygerberg.aspx>
 in the northern suburbs (north-east of the city centre) is underappreciated. 
It contains one of the biggest remaining intact pieces ofSwartland shale 
renosterveld <http://bgis.sanbi.org/ecosystems/showecosystem.asp?id=46>, a 
critically endangered vegetation type, andyou will always see something if you 
keep your eyes open – again the spring bulbs are a highlight. The smell of 
imphepho (Helichrysum patulum) and wild rosemary (Eriocephalus africanus) is 
always prominent. From the top of the hill there is a panoramic view over Cape 
Town from a really unusual angle. You can see Table Mountain, Robben Island, 
planes heading for Cape Town International on the Cape Flats, and into the 
Boland.

The northern Blouberg coast also offers great views of Table Mountain and 
interesting coastal vegetation. There are a couple of nice beacheswithin the
Blaauwberg Nature Reserve 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/Pages/NatureReserve-Blaauwberg.aspx>
, north of Big Bay.


 For hiking, the Helderberg Nature Reserve 
<http://www.helderbergnaturereserve.co.za/>, 50km out of town in Somerset West, 
is very peaceful and safe. The trails are well-marked, and easy for self-guided 
walks. There are places to picnic, as it’s very family-orientated. Again 
there’s lots to see, especially if you walk up a bit – there are ponds where 
you can find wetland birds and, even further up, there is quite nicefynbos 
(indigenous shrubland).

 Bird-watchers should not miss Strandfontein 
<http://www.capebirdclub.org.za/art-Strandfontein-directions.html> sewage works 
on the Cape Flats to the north. Despite the name, the former waste treatment 
ponds are home to a rich variety of local birdlife. The coastal road (R44) from 
Somerset West is very beautiful, and leads to the fantasticKogelberg Nature 
Reserve <http://www.capenature.co.za/reserves/kogelberg-nature-reserve/>, which 
is within an hour-and-a-half of Cape Town’s city centre. The Kogelberg is 
considered the heart of thefynbos kingdom because of the sheer numbers and 
beauty of the plants and landscapes.



Readers’ tips and Instagram shots

There’s no better guide to a city than word-of-mouth recommendations: from 
people who live there and people who have visited. We asked our readers toshare 
Instagram pictures

 and their favourite experiences in Cape Town. These are just a few,with more

.

Company Gardens and Business District – a good detour
While Table Mountain and the Waterfront are must-dos in Cape Town, it’s worth 
also taking a stroll through the Company Gardens and the old part of the 
Business District, too. The reward is you get to see great architecture, as 
well as the peaceful landscaped heart of the city. There is a great little 
guesthouse nearby: theNine Flowers  <http://nineflowers.com/>has beautiful 
comfortable rooms, at a good price (doubles from £42) and a nice breakfast, 
too. Just a few doors down the road is theGusto 
<https://www.facebook.com/Gusto-Cafeteria-220325794683333/> cafe for the best 
flat white we had in the city.
