Holly Young <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/holly-young>, journalist for 
the Guardian’sGlobal Development Professional Network 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network>, has won 
AidEx’s Humanitarian Journalism & Development Award.

Young was honoured for her piece on refugees and mental health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/14/refugees-and-mental-health-pyschological-support-msf>
. The award recognises and celebrates the hard work that journalists do to 
portray the realities of the often misunderstood sector of humanitarian and 
development work.


Commenting on the piece Young said: “I sought out and wrote this piece because 
I was interested in the mental health support given to refugees entering Europe 
- it had been something that hadn’t been covered at all by the international 
media. I was interested in how far the provision for refugees extended above 
and beyond basic sustenance and shelter, and what the arguments for this looked 
like. Overall the objective was to shed light on the full complexity of the 
migration journey and experience.”
