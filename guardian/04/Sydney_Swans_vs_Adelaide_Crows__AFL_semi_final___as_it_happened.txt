Final score - Sydney 18.10 (118) defeat Adelaide 12.10 (82)

In the end, comfortable. Earlier, anything but. That was a proper final, both 
sides completely committed to the physical task. The Swans did it with 20 after 
losing McVeigh to a calf injury and Rohan a knee ailment that looked pretty 
nasty.

That opened the door to Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide>, 
who worked their way back into this contest in the third quarter, with four 
goals to two. But Sydney shut down any hope swiftly in the final term.

Adelaide will lament how long it took to get into the game, all-too-regular 
skill errors taken advantage of by the hosts in the early stages.

As the game went on, it was the big names: Kennedy (42 touches), Haneberry 
(31), Heeney (32), Franklin (four goals) - all outstanding. Then the work of 
the small forwards Papley (four goals) and McGlynn (three). All told, they 
overwhelmed the visitors.


So after threatening for so long this season, Adelaide’s campaign is over at 
least a week earlier than what they would have considered satisfactory. For the 
victors, they return to the biggest venue of them all for a Friday night 
preliminary final against Geelong.

And with that, I bid you farewell. Thanks for the company through the night. 
We’ll be back with our liveAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> blog 
coverage on Friday night. Till then.

Brilliant from the SCG/AFL. Some booing before when they said kick to kick 
wouldn’t happen. Then they reversed the decision. They do have an issue turning 
the ground around in time for the Sheffield Shield, but let’s not worry about 
that now.We’ve got tonight. Who needs tomorrow?

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 12.9 (81) Tom Mitchell the 
beneficiary of Josh Kennedy’s tough torso. He must do tons of yoga. The Crows 
just fell off him when trying to bring him down, his 41st possession of the 
night putting Mitchell into enough space to snap Sydney’s 18th goal of the 
night. Nearly there now.

Adelaide’s centre break machine working a treat now. It’s all too late, of

contest that this has been for much of the night.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Richards put into space 
after a chain of handballs on the wing, kicks penetratively inside 50 where 
Heeney is there to take a strong grab. Slots it home. Big smiles in the Harbour 
City. Friday night at the MCG they will meet Geelong.

his left boot at it, and through the middle it goes. 43 points the margin. 
After a year off, Sydney are back in the Prelim.

Sydney’s small forwards have seven between them now.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Lynch jags Adelaide’s 
first of the last quarter, and even though less than seven minutes have been 
taken from the clock it already feels a bit too late. Clever from Betts to find 
him 20m out with a left-foot pass from the pocket.

Josh Kennedy is relentless. Chasing his own kicks twice there they way you are 
taught in the under 10s. He’s had 34 of the best tonight, especially potent 
forward of centre.

Already some scrutiny over Jacobs hit on Papley. It’s a bump with the elbow 
down, but he’s a foot taller than him and collected his head. Never looks good. 
Might be in strife in the event thatAdelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> progress to next week. Unlikely as 
it feels at this very moment.

Sydney goal! 4th quarter 18:40 remaining) Sydney 13.9 (87) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.9 (57) Papley has the last two 
of the game and three for the night not making a mistake from 30m out directly 
in front. Been the most influential small forward on the ground, extending 
Sydney’s lead to an even five goals 71 seconds into the final term. Some goals 
are more important than others.

Sydney goal! 3rd quarter 2:17 remaining) Sydney 12.9 (81) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.8 (56) Maybe not! Sydney respond 
within 17 seconds. Classic centre break bombed to the hot spot, some clever 
roving from Tom Papley who snaps with the right boot and it... is... true. Back 
to 25 points.

Eddie Betts held by Nick Smith according to the official, but gee that’s stiff 
on the defender. He pays the maximum price with the free kick inside 30m. The 
margin inside 20 points. Game on?

High funny from Buddy. His old HFC teammate McGlynn takes a grab 52m out, and 
he knows full well he can’t kick over the proverbial jam tin so he tries to 
claim a little handball around the back. Blocked by a couple of Crows who know 
the score.

Adelaide goal! 3rd quarter 5:27 remaining) Sydney 11.8 (74) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 7.8 (50) Well, Adelaide strike 
right back. It’s Charlie Cameron, who has been hard at it tonight and created 
plenty after a slow start. He burns off the chasers into an open goal and gives 
it the big ones after slotting it through. Four even goals the margin. Plenty 
of time left in this quarter, as we learned – um – last night.

Missed snap! Adelaide won’t be able to say they didn’t have their chances. 
Eddie plays a role in bringing the ball to ground, Jenkins fails to convert the 
snap; shoulda done better. Fast forward 20 seconds: Buddy has a set shot from 
the most Buddy spot on the park, 50 out. Guess what? Yep. New post.

Nankervis guts. Drops back into Eddie leaping over his head. He’s been super 
impressive coming into the side tonight. Down the other end, and Kennedy has a 
set shot as a result. What will he do? Not enough. Misses to the right.

Bad miss, Jerka. Jenkins the recipient of a free kick after looking to be the 
man doing the bulk of the holding? No matter: he misses from 30. A chance blown 
to take the margin inside 20 points there.

No, Eddie. Tries to start his half with a speccy, but goes about quarter of an 
hour early to give away the free. Admire him trying to find a way to get into 
this game though. The visitors need him real bad.

Second half underway...

The Crows with plenty to do - and probably in a hurry if history is any guide 
in these semi-finals – but the Swans down to 20. Here we go.

Some unpleasant viewing for Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> fans into the commercial break, a 
shot down to the rooms with Jake Lever trying to run and looking, well, awful. 
He’s already shown tonight that he’s as hard as this masthead’s cryptic 
crossword, but guts only go so far.

All these injuries. Seems to be Gary Rohan with a knee, McVeigh with a calf 
along with Lever’s ankle issue for the Crows. If the Swans are down to 20, that 
won’t be for nothing.

Nice stat here from the Wu-Tube.

Wonder why Adelaide look so much worse than last week? North laid 43 tackles, 
Swans have 39 to half time#AFLSwansCrows

Half time - Sydney 10.5 (65) vs Adelaide 4.4 (28)

Three goals to one for the home side in the second term with the Swans stars 
really putting a stamp on this game. “Geelong are the winner out of the first 
half,” is Mark Ricciuto’s assessment. Seems about right.

Let’s take a break. Grab a Fanta and some chicken twisties. Or whatever it is 
that makes you happy. I’ll scan twitter for some ~value add~ and will be back 
in a tic.

Gary Rowan is down. Here comes to the stretcher. Hard to tell from the replay 
if it was a contact injury or something on landing? But they’re taking it 
pretty slowly. This is good news: he’s on his feet now, onto the back of the 
car. 11 seconds till the hooter for half time.

Sydney goal! 2nd quarter (1:00 remaining) Sydney 10.5 (65) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 4.4 (28) You can’t stop the 
Franklin, nobody can stop the Franklin! Contested mark to the champ, Hartigan 
nowhere near it. Buddy well inside range, pops it through. Crucial 10 minutes 
for the Swans there.

Goal umpire hits the deck for the second time tonight as another Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> set shot misses, this time Dick 
Doug the culprit. Sure enough, Sydney get their own chance as a consequence, 
but mercifully for the Crows Josh Kennedy isn’t able to finish off a running 
chance from outside 50.

Lever’s injury is an ankle, not a corky, we are told. Get the magic spray on 
the kid, he’s very much needed at the moment.

close  
In the end, comfortable. Earlier, anything but. That was a proper final, both 
sides completely committed to the physical task. The Swans did it with 20 after 
losing McVeigh to a calf injury and Rohan a knee ailment that looked pretty 
nasty.

That opened the door to Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide>, 
who worked their way back into this contest in the third quarter, with four 
goals to two. But Sydney shut down any hope swiftly in the final term.

Adelaide will lament how long it took to get into the game, all-too-regular 
skill errors taken advantage of by the hosts in the early stages.

As the game went on, it was the big names: Kennedy (42 touches), Haneberry 
(31), Heeney (32), Franklin (four goals) - all outstanding. Then the work of 
the small forwards Papley (four goals) and McGlynn (three). All told, they 
overwhelmed the visitors.


So after threatening for so long this season, Adelaide’s campaign is over at 
least a week earlier than what they would have considered satisfactory. For the 
victors, they return to the biggest venue of them all for a Friday night 
preliminary final against Geelong.

And with that, I bid you farewell. Thanks for the company through the night. 
We’ll be back with our liveAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> blog 
coverage on Friday night. Till then.
 
It’s over! Siren! Cheer, cheer the red and the white. 36 points the victory 
margin. Buddy: “I can’t wait to get down to Melbourne and play Geelong.”
 
Brilliant from the SCG/AFL. Some booing before when they said kick to kick 
wouldn’t happen. Then they reversed the decision. They do have an issue turning 
the ground around in time for the Sheffield Shield, but let’s not worry about 
that now.We’ve got tonight. Who needs tomorrow?

Sydney goal! 4th quarter 4:46 remaining) Sydney 18.10 (118) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 12.9 (81) Tom Mitchell the 
beneficiary of Josh Kennedy’s tough torso. He must do tons of yoga. The Crows 
just fell off him when trying to bring him down, his 41st possession of the 
night putting Mitchell into enough space to snap Sydney’s 18th goal of the 
night. Nearly there now.
 
Adelaide goal! 4th quarter 5:46 remaining) Sydney 17.10 (112) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 12.9 (81) Charlie Cameron snaps 
one too, so that’s three goals in five kicks. for the Crows. As you do. 
Adelaide’s centre break machine working a treat now. It’s all too late, of 
course. But the scoreboard, I reckon, closer to where it should be now for the 
contest that this has been for much of the night.
 
Adelaide goal! 4th quarter 6:06 remaining) Sydney 17.10 (112) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 11.9 (75) Two in a minute, captain 
Walker popping through a set shot from 30 after a centre break. TV commentators 
inform us that the last time Sydney played Geelong (well, South) was 1934. 
Remarkable given their frequency of September footy over the last decade 
especially.
 
Adelaide goal! 4th quarter 6:34 remaining) Sydney 17.10 (112) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 10.9 (69) Class finish from Betts 
after forcing an out on the full. Lovely shape. That’s his third tonight and 
75th for the season.
 
Graham Neal has dropped a line to say that he can outdo Nairobi for our reader 
in the most creative location. He’s in Tehran. Let’s grow the game, I say.
 
Sydney goal! 4th quarter 9:40 remaining) Sydney 17.10 (112) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Richards put into space 
after a chain of handballs on the wing, kicks penetratively inside 50 where 
Heeney is there to take a strong grab. Slots it home. Big smiles in the Harbour 
City. Friday night at the MCG they will meet Geelong.
 
Sydney goal! 4th quarter 13:17 remaining) Sydney 16.10 (106) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Party time. A series of 
handballs inside 50 lands in the mits of Hanneberry with enough space to fling 
his left boot at it, and through the middle it goes. 43 points the margin. 
After a year off, Sydney are back in the Prelim.
 
Sydney goal! 4th quarter 12:00 remaining) Sydney 15.10 (100) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Pattern of the night 
continues, Sydney hitting back within a couple of minutes. And it’s Papley for 
his fourth, crumbing a ball that evaded the big men beneath their knees. 
Sydney’s small forwards have seven between them now.
 
Adelaide goal! 4th quarter 14:47 remaining) Sydney 14.10 (94) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 9.9 (63) Lynch jags Adelaide’s 
first of the last quarter, and even though less than seven minutes have been 
taken from the clock it already feels a bit too late. Clever from Betts to find 
him 20m out with a left-foot pass from the pocket.
 
Sydney goal! 4th quarter 14:47 remaining) Sydney 14.10 (94) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.9 (57) McGlynn, who has had an 
excellent night, gets on the end of one. Steps back to 50 and slams it home. 
How far his game has come since moving up north. Nice work, Hoopy. He has 
three. Sydney are home.
 
Josh Kennedy is relentless. Chasing his own kicks twice there they way you are 
taught in the under 10s. He’s had 34 of the best tonight, especially potent 
forward of centre.
 
Already some scrutiny over Jacobs hit on Papley. It’s a bump with the elbow 
down, but he’s a foot taller than him and collected his head. Never looks good. 
Might be in strife in the event thatAdelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> progress to next week. Unlikely as 
it feels at this very moment.
 
Sydney goal! 4th quarter 18:40 remaining) Sydney 13.9 (87) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.9 (57) Papley has the last two 
of the game and three for the night not making a mistake from 30m out directly 
in front. Been the most influential small forward on the ground, extending 
Sydney’s lead to an even five goals 71 seconds into the final term. Some goals 
are more important than others.
 
The final term begins.

Siren! Four goals to two for the Crows that quarter. As the old political 
slogan goes: more to do, but heading in the right direction. Panache.
 
Sydney goal! 3rd quarter 2:17 remaining) Sydney 12.9 (81) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.8 (56) Maybe not! Sydney respond 
within 17 seconds. Classic centre break bombed to the hot spot, some clever 
roving from Tom Papley who snaps with the right boot and it... is... true. Back 
to 25 points.
 
Adelaide goal! 3rd quarter 2:17 remaining) Sydney 11.9 (75) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 8.8 (56) Oh there is a moment! 
Eddie Betts held by Nick Smith according to the official, but gee that’s stiff 
on the defender. He pays the maximum price with the free kick inside 30m. The 
margin inside 20 points. Game on?
 
High funny from Buddy. His old HFC teammate McGlynn takes a grab 52m out, and 
he knows full well he can’t kick over the proverbial jam tin so he tries to 
claim a little handball around the back. Blocked by a couple of Crows who know 
the score.
 
Adelaide goal! 3rd quarter 5:27 remaining) Sydney 11.8 (74) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 7.8 (50) Well, Adelaide strike 
right back. It’s Charlie Cameron, who has been hard at it tonight and created 
plenty after a slow start. He burns off the chasers into an open goal and gives 
it the big ones after slotting it through. Four even goals the margin. Plenty 
of time left in this quarter, as we learned – um – last night.
 
Sydney goal! 3rd quarter 6:41 remaining) Sydney 11.7 (73) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 6.8 (44) Lance doesn’t miss from 
there. Right to left like Waqar Younis. He has four, has set up a couple, and 
is the best player on the ground.
 
Missed snap! Adelaide won’t be able to say they didn’t have their chances. 
Eddie plays a role in bringing the ball to ground, Jenkins fails to convert the 
snap; shoulda done better. Fast forward 20 seconds: Buddy has a set shot from 
the most Buddy spot on the park, 50 out. Guess what? Yep. New post.
 
Nankervis guts. Drops back into Eddie leaping over his head. He’s been super 
impressive coming into the side tonight. Down the other end, and Kennedy has a 
set shot as a result. What will he do? Not enough. Misses to the right.
 
Bad miss, Jerka. Jenkins the recipient of a free kick after looking to be the 
man doing the bulk of the holding? No matter: he misses from 30. A chance blown 
to take the margin inside 20 points there.

The physical challenge continues: “It’s all or nothing here for Adelaide

playing,” says BT on the call.
 
Adelaide goal! 3rd quarter (15:15 remaining) Sydney 10.6 (65) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 6.4 (40) Two in a minute! Now the 
Camrys are getting somewhere. Lynch brings the long ball to ground at the 
kick-off line as D-Com used to say, McGovern does the rest at ground level.

Adelaide goal! 3rd quarter (15:48 remaining) Sydney 10.6 (65) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 5.4 (34) Better, Eddie. Laird 
finds the gun in the pocket. He takes the grab, plays on, snaps the goal. Okay. 
A start.
 
No, Eddie. Tries to start his half with a speccy, but goes about quarter of an 
hour early to give away the free. Admire him trying to find a way to get into 
this game though. The visitors need him real bad.
 
The Crows with plenty to do - and probably in a hurry if history is any guide 
in these semi-finals – but the Swans down to 20. Here we go.

Some unpleasant viewing for Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> fans into the commercial break, a 
shot down to the rooms with Jake Lever trying to run and looking, well, awful. 
He’s already shown tonight that he’s as hard as this masthead’s cryptic 
crossword, but guts only go so far.
 
All these injuries. Seems to be Gary Rohan with a knee, McVeigh with a calf 
along with Lever’s ankle issue for the Crows. If the Swans are down to 20, that 
won’t be for nothing.

Nice stat here from the Wu-Tube.

Three goals to one for the home side in the second term with the Swans stars 
really putting a stamp on this game. “Geelong are the winner out of the first 
half,” is Mark Ricciuto’s assessment. Seems about right.

Let’s take a break. Grab a Fanta and some chicken twisties. Or whatever it is 
that makes you happy. I’ll scan twitter for some ~value add~ and will be back 
in a tic.
 
Siren. What a rabid quarter.

Gary Rowan is down. Here comes to the stretcher. Hard to tell from the replay 
if it was a contact injury or something on landing? But they’re taking it 
pretty slowly. This is good news: he’s on his feet now, onto the back of the 
car. 11 seconds till the hooter for half time.
 
Sydney goal! 2nd quarter (1:00 remaining) Sydney 10.5 (65) vs Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> 4.4 (28) You can’t stop the 
Franklin, nobody can stop the Franklin! Contested mark to the champ, Hartigan 
nowhere near it. Buddy well inside range, pops it through. Crucial 10 minutes 
for the Swans there.
