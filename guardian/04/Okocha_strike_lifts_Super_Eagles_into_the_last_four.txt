Cameroon's hopes of a third straight Nations Cup were dashed by Nigeria, who 
played with renewed conviction and are now clear favourites to take the trophy 
they last held aloft in Tunisia 10 years ago.

Nigeria have lost in three finals to Cameroon, leading some to speak of a 
jinx, but that superstition was convincingly debunked yesterday. "Before it was 
Cameroon time," said Nigeria's coach Christian Chukwu. "All that has changed 
now and it is the time of Nigerian dominance."

In the opening half-hour the Super Eagles impressed with their passing and 
willingness to attack. But one foray left them exposed and Geremi's perfect 
ball allowed Samuel Eto'o to run through and strike home with his left foot.

It took Jay-Jay Okocha less than five minutes to equalise, the Nigeria 
captain's free-kick rising over the wall before curling and fading into the far 
corner. It lifted his team and they took control. The winner came when Nwankwo 
Kanu's disguised through-ball found John Utaka in acres of space and he scored 
with a firm shot.
