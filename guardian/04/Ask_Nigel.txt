Q When I make sweet pastry to line a tart tin it is often too rich to pick up 
and collapses into pieces. How can I get round this? I don't want to make an 
ordinary shortcrust.Robin 

A Yes, you're absolutely right, Robin - sweet pastry made with egg yolks and 
sugar can often be very tricky to roll and it's a common complaint. Rather than 
rolling your pastry into a flat sheet, I find the best solution is to shape it 
into a short fat sausage. Wrap this up and let it chill for half an hour in the 
fridge. When the pastry is quite firm, cut off thin slices - as if you were 
slicing a loaf - with a large knife, laying the slices closely together and 
slightly overlapping in the tart tin. Push the edges together with your hand, 
filling in any gaps between the slices to cover the base and sides of the tin. 
Line with greaseproof paper and baking beans and bake in the usual way.

Q Dear Nigel, I have rhubarb still growing on my allotment. Is it too late to 
eat it?Tif

A Thanks for your query, Tif. The fact is you certainly can still eat your 
rhubarb, but you may not want to. Check how tender the stalks are by snapping 
one of them in half. If they break cleanly they will be fine to bake, but if 
they are exceedingly stringy then don't bother. Put them on the compost. It is 
a good idea never to pick all your stalks. Leave some of them in to give the 
crown a chance to build up its strength over winter.
