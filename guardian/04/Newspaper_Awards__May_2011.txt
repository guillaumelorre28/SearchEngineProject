The Guardian has won two prizes at the 2011 Newspaper Awards 
<http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk>.

Guardian.co.uk was named Digital News Service of the Year and the judges 
praised the site's WikiLeaks coverage as "a jaw dropper", adding that 
"Guardian.co.uk is constantly raising the bar by which other news-oriented 
websites are judged".

The Guardian Datablog <https://www.theguardian.com/data>, which publishes raw 
data and graphic visualisations of the news, won the category for Best Use of 
New Media.

There were also commendations for The Observer in the Weekend Newspaper of the 
Year category and the Guardian iPhone app for Newspaper App of the Year.
