The Observer has won the top prize at the 2014 Newspaper Awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards>. The Fujifilm Grand Prix 
was awarded to the Observer Tech Monthly supplement, which launched in 
September last year. The supplement also won the Coldset Colour Supplement of 
the Year prize.

Observer Tech Monthly brings together news and developments from the world of 
science and technology and covers a wealth of opinions, debates, interviews and 
reviews from finance to fashion, from media to medicine.

Praising the supplement, judges said that it was "a masterclass in making a 
specialist market accessible and compelling" and also singled out its "great 
authoritative content".

GuardianWitness - the Guardian's user-generated content platform which 
launched in April 2013 in partnership with EE - picked up the Digital 
Innovation of the Year award. The judges were "uniformly impressed with the 
scope and implementation of this digital newcomer", praising its "innovative 
implementation of social news gathering which works well across numerous 
platforms."

"Clearly citizen journalism is on the march", said one judge, "and 
GuardianWitness harnesses it beautifully."

The Guardian website, theguardian.com <http://theguardian.com>, was also 
highly commended in the digital news service of the year category.

The Newspaper Awards celebrate the best in print and digital news media 
production and innovation. Further information about all the winners is online
