This book is full of humour for the whole family. It’s all about a 9-year-old 
boy called Edwin who is a king. He has regal clothes and a spangly shiny crown; 
to top it off there are mini crowns on each spike. Edwin is a kind ruler who 
gives out sweets to everyone in his kingdom, using K.E.N.N.E.T.H (King Edwin’s 
Nutritious Nibbles Ejector Thrower & Hurler), on Fridays and even on Mondays if 
they are lucky. Next door lives an evil neighbour, Evil Emperor Norbison, who 
wants to invade Edwinland and take over. Evil Emperor Nurbison sees an 
opportunity to rule Edwinland when the peasants don’t get their sweets, and he 
fools them into thinking there is a curse on their land.

This book made me (and my sister) laugh out loud a lot; the story is funny, 
the descriptions are hilarious, the extraordinary characters have fun quirky 
names and the illustrations made me giggle too. I loved the picture of the 
“good” and “bad” castles because it is full of things I would never have 
imagined. I also especially liked the Evil Emperors laugh – “Foo Hoo Hoo Hoo” – 
which he uses any time he can.

My favourite character is 7-year-old Natasha who is cleverer then everyone 
else and can see through the Emperor’s evil plan. At the end of the book there 
is the music and lyrics for “The Emperor’s Striding Theme” tube which I am 
learning to play because like the book it’s really funny and everyone deserves 
a theme tune.
I recommend this book to everyone because its fun, quirky and hilarious.
