One of American Apparel’s flagship stores, in London’s Covent Garden, could be 
closed along with four other UK shops.

The embattled US fashion retailer is thought to be considering disposing of 
its shops in Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham and the store on Neal Street 
in Covent Garden and has appointed UK retail property specialist Kitchen La

 (£).

This would leave the chain, which became known for its Made in the USA clothes,
as well as its controversial ads

, with four stores outside London – in Brighton, Birmingham, Glasgow and 
Manchester.

The Los Angeles-based retailer is expected to hold on to its other nine stores 
in London, alongside a concession in department store Selfridges.

Struggling to repair its battered reputation and finances, American Apparel 
appointed four new directors

, including its first female director, to the board in July.The board shake-up 
was one of the conditions imposed by investment firm Lion Capital

 in return for a $25m (£15m) funding boost. Last month American Apparel 
appointed turnaround specialist Scott Brubaker as interim chief executive and 
replaced its finance chief.

The company is investigating alleged misconduct by its founder Dov Charney, 
who was ousted by the board in June

Kitchen La Frenais Morgan both declined to comment.
