The Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds says he was surprised by the incident 
during the second Test at Sydney which led to athree-Test ban 
<http://sport.theguardian.com/cricket/story/0,,2236469,00.html> for racial 
abuse for the Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and has prompted the Indian 
board tosuspend their side's tour 
<http://sport.theguardian.com/cricket/story/0,,2236571,00.html> pending the 
outcome of their appeal against the verdict.

"This is what happened before our confrontation," Symonds told the Herald Sun 
in Australia. "Brett Lee had just sent down a delivery and Harbhajan took off 
down the wicket. When he was returning to his crease, he decided to hit Brett 
on the backside. I have no idea why he did it.

"I was standing nearby and when I saw what happened, I thought, 'Hold on, 
that's not on'. I'm a firm believer in sticking up for your team-mate so I 
stepped in and had a bit of a crack at Harbhajan, telling him exactly what I 
thought of his antics. He then had a shot back, which brings us to the 
situation we're facing."

Symonds added: "I must admit the incident was pretty surprising, because 
relations between the two sides so far have been very good. It's been a series 
played in really good spirit. There's been no sledging or bad blood."

The match referee Mike Procter ruled that Harbhajan had called Symonds, the 
only non-white member of the Australian side, a "monkey". In October, Symonds 
was subjected to monkey chants by a small minority of the crowd during a 
one-day international in the Indian town of Vadodara.
