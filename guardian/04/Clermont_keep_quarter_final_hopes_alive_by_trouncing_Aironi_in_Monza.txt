Clermont ran in 12 tries to thrash Italian whipping boys Aironi in their 
Heineken Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heineken-cup> Pool Four match 
at Stadio Brianteo to keep alive hopes of a place in the quarter-finals.

The French side raced ahead with some early scores and were already 47-0 in 
front at the break.

The wingers Sitiveni Sivivatu and Julien Malzieu completed their hat-tricks in 
the second half, with Brock James kicking seven conversions to add to four from 
Morgan Parra.

The full-back Lee Byrne scored twice, while Alexandre Lapandry, James and 
Elvis Vermeulen also touched down as the French side collected a bonus point 
ahead of next weekend's home clash with the pool leaders Ulster.
