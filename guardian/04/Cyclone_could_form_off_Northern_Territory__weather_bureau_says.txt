The chances of a cyclone forming in waters off the Northern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> on Tuesday or 
Wednesday have increased, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

The bureau has raised its cyclone outlook warning for the northern region from 
low to moderate. That means there is a 20% to 50% likelihood of a storm system 
forming in waters north of the NT on Tuesday or Wednesday.

A tropical low is forming in the monsoon trough in the Arafura Sea, above the 
Tiwi Islands north of Darwin. It is expected to develop further early next week 
and move south-west into the Timor Sea, the bureau says.

“The likelihood of the low developing into a tropical cyclone increases late 
on Tuesday or on Wednesday,” the bureau’s cyclone advice says. “The system is 
forecast to affect the north Kimberley coastline from mid-week as it continues 
to move away from the NT region.”
