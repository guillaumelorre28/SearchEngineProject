However a statement released by touring company Live Nation on Monday said 
Schumer’s December tour was cancelled owing to an unspecified illness.

Replacement dates have not yet been worked out because of the comedian’s busy 
schedule, although Live Nation said it was working to rebook “as soon as is 
practical”.

Full refunds will be given to those who bought the tickets by credit or debit 
card within 10 working days and customers who bought at an agency by cash or 
Eftpos will be contacted by Ticketek directly to advise how to process their 
refund.
