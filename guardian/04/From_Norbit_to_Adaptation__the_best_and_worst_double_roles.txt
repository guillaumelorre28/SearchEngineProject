By playing both Ronnie and Reggie Kray in Legend, Tom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/09/legend-review-tom-hardy-krays-reg-ron>
 has joined a select group of actors. A group of actors who thrive on high-wire 
showboating, with too much talent to contain within the confines of a single 
part. A group of actors who, at some point in their careers, wanted nothing 
more than to be their own co-star.

This is, however, rife with danger. When it works, it can be a thrilling 
demonstration of an actor’s talent. But when it doesn’t – and it quite often 
doesn’t – it’s an overcomplicated mishmash of thwarted hubris and unconvincing 
body doubles. Here are the five best, and five worst, actors who’ve taken 
multiple roles in the same film.

BEST

5. Jeremy Irons <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeremy-irons> (Dead Ringers, 
1988)

Jeremy Irons <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeremy-irons> is never better 
than when he’s playing an unapologetic shit. This means that Dead Ringers must 
be his greatest film, since he gets to play two of them at once. Best of all, 
both parts he plays are essentially the same person. Often an actor will take 
on two roles in a film in order to transparently demonstrate their range. Here, 
Irons is basically meditating on the same character. Huge expanses of the film 
pass when you aren’t even sure which character is which. It’s a masterclass in 
opacity.

 Although it’s just one scene, Eddie Murphy’s barbershop row with himself is a 
memorable one. Photograph: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock 
It’s easy to forget now, after his unfortunate phase of trying to play every 
single part in every single film he made, but Eddie Murphy used to be the king 
at this sort of thing. The barbershop scene in Coming to America, where two 
versions of Murphy argue about boxing, is still astonishing. Not only does it 
play like a long, improvised riff – despite being filmed over the course of 
several days – but it takes a couple of watches to even figure out that Murphy 
plays both characters.

brilliantly balanced performance. Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock 
Had Nicolas Cage only played Donald Kaufman in Adaptation, it’d be written off 
as just another entertaining, slightly-too-big Cage performance. But it’s 
balanced out by his turn as Donald’s nervy, internalised twin brother Charlie. 
That alone is enough to make this performance one of the greats.

 It seems as though the two versions of Moss’s character in The One I Love 
aren’t that diverse, but the actor’s subtle groundwork pays off. Photograph:

At the start of this film – where Moss and Mark Duplass discover different 
versions of themselves in a holiday cottage – it seems as though Duplass is the 
one doing all the heavy lifting. His characters are different enough to make an 
impression, where Moss’s simply have slightly different haircuts. I won’t spoil 
it, but the kick comes halfway through, when all the subtle groundwork Moss had 
been putting in pays off and the film spectacularly schisms away from itself. 
An overlooked treat.

 Alec Guinness plays a multitude of characters in Kind Hearts and Coronets. 
Photograph: REX Shutterstock 
Oh my, this film has not aged well. It contains the very worst possible 
version of Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe recited in the very worst possible accent, 
and as such probably won’t get shown on television any time soon. And that’s a 
shame; partly because it’s one of the best comedies ever made by Ealing 
Studios, but mainly because Alec Guinness plays eight roles in it. Eight 
beautiful, completely distinct roles. It’s the perfect, showy vehicle for an 
actor of his calibre, and – toe-curling language aside – it will never be 
bettered.

WORST

 Adam Sandler’s dual performances in Jack and Jill are painful and grating. 
Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock 
Just imagine the meeting. There had to be a meeting where a group of people – 
people who are paid extraordinary sums of money to be experts about this sort 
of thing – decided that the only way to improve an Adam Sandler movie was to 
put two Adam Sandlers in it. And while one Sandler is classic Sandler 
(dead-eyed, mumbling, visibly checked-out), the other just wears a frock and 
shouts. It’s a painful, grating set of performances and the film is only saved 
when Al Pacino raps about doughnuts at the end, which is the only time in 
history that sentence will ever be used.

4. Jean-Claude Van Damme (The Order, 2001)

By 2001, Jean-Claude Van Damme had played multiple roles in Double Impact, 
Timecop, Maximum Risk and Replicant, each to slightly diminishing effect. There 
wasn’t really space for him to do the same in The Order – a slightly 
Tomb-Raidery piece of Holy Land guff – but he did it anyway. In the film’s 
opening scene, which only has the merest trace of a connection to what follows, 
Van Damme plays a messiah. An actual, kind-hearted, white-bearded messiah, 
presumably because Jean-Claude Van Damme couldn’t be in a film where someone 
other than Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a Jesus figure. This film was co-written 
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Deep into the miserable guts of Presley’s movie career – after It Happened at 
the World’s Fair, and before Clambake – came this mess. Knocked off in 17 days, 
Kissin’ Cousins is miserable from start to finish. On one hand, you’ve got 
Elvis Presley playing Elvis Presley. One the other hand, you’ve got Elvis 
Presley playing Elvis Presley in a wig. That’s all there is to this film, apart 
from a clutch of women who run around in their underwear for no real reason and 
a title song that goes: “I’ve got a gal, she’s as cute as she can be/She’s a 
distant cousin but she’s not too distant with me.” Which is just the epitome of 
yick.

Oh, for the days before William Shatner gained self-awareness. Those were the 
days when, ballooning with lethal levels of post-Star Trek egotism, he 
attempted to make a western. It would be called White Comanche and he would 
play a cowboy. Oh, and also he’d play an evil Native American – upsetting 
accent and all – because he’s William Shatner and who the hell are you to tell 
him what’s a colossally misjudged and harrowingly insensitive decision and what 
isn’t?

 Norbit was a million miles away from Eddie Murphy’s previous sparky and 
thoughtful multi-character work. Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock 
Eddie Murphy was once regarded as one of the most exciting and versatile 
comedy performers the world had ever seen. That’s something you should probably 
repeat to yourself if you ever end up watching Norbit, the film thatarguably 
lost him the best supporting actor Oscar for that year’s Dreamgirls 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/06/the-oscar-curse-of-the-norbit-effect-are-julianne-moore-and-eddie-redmayne-at-risk.html>
. Where once he’d set a film alight with his sparky and surprisingly thoughtful 
multiple-character work, here he plays Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy’s obnoxious 
and obese wife, and the most uncomfortably stereotypical Asian character since 
they let Mickey Rooney appear in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. This film, and 
Murphy’s performance in it, is less “so bad it’s good” and more “so bad it just 
makes you incredibly sad”.
