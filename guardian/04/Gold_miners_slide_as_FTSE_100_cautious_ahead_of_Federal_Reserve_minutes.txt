Gold was on the slide again, pushing shares in precious metal mining companies 
sharply lower.

Amid uncertain trading on stock markets ahead of the release of the latest US 
Federal Reserve minutes - which will be scoured for signs of the central bank's 
view on future economic stimulus -Randgold Resources lost 126p to £44.95, 
making it the biggest faller in the leading index.

African Barrick Gold dropped 10.7p to 181p and Fresnillo fell 9p to 904.5p. 
Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:
 Gold has been a big slider today.... which suggests that the weak or benign 
inflation outlook is curbing demand for the precious metal. This afternoon's 
weak inflation reading from the US tends to reinforce this weak outlook. While 
inflation remains capped, the outlook for the yellow metal seems likely to 
remain weak irrespective of whether the Fed minutes are hawkish or dovish.

Ahead of the Fed minutes, St Louis Fed president James Bullard suggested the 
central bank might still look at easing back on its $85bn a month bond buying 
programme at its December meeting. He said a strong jobs figure for November 
would increase the prospect of tapering. Markets have been dominated by trying 
to work out when the Fed would turn off the money taps, but most observers 
believe it will not act until next year.

Meanwhile there were reports revisiting the idea that the European Central 
Bank might consider a negative deposit rate to boost growth, which sent the 
euro lower.

The Bank of England's latest minutes also suggested there would be no quick 
interest rate rise in the UK.

Overall, the FTSE 100 finished 16.93 points lower at 6681.08.

Vodafone - tipped this week once more as a bid target - was among the fallers, 
down 4.85p to 227.2p as its shares were ex-dividend.

Drinks group Diageo dipped 23.5p to £20.05 after an investor day on Tuesday, 
in which it moved away from its previous stance of giving forward guidance. 
Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald said:
 Our overall take was that the outlook was for less top-line sales growth 
(below the 5%-8% net sales growth range and more price than volume) and less 
margin gains versus 2012 and 2013. Diageo is facing less predictable growth 
patterns in Emerging Markets as GDP growth rates slow and, sales of their 
largest spirit brand, Smirnoff Vodka, slow too. 
Building materials group Wolseley, which has a strong presence in the US, 
slipped 21p to £32.29 after the American Institute of Architects' Architecture 
Billings Index fell to 51.6 in October after hitting a seven-month high of 54.3 
in September.

But Aberdeen Asset Management moved higher in the wake of this week's £660m 
acquisition of Scottish Widows from Lloyds Banking Group. It added 16.8p to 
492p as Barclays and Berenberg both raised their price targets.

EasyJet jumped another 32p to £13.77 after its well received results.

GlaxoSmithKline moved 3.5p higher to 1631.5p after raising £425m by selling 
part of its stake in South African drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare.

Glaxo disposed of 28.2m shares in Aspen, leaving it with 12.4% of the 
business. It will retain a seat on the board of the business and has agreed not 
to sell any further shares for at least six months.

Among the mid-caps, engineering group Kentz Corporation climbed 13p to 555p 
after it won a $190m contract from Qatar Petroleum for industrial control 
systems for around 775 wells of the Dukhan oilfield in the middle east.

On the day MPs quizzed bankers over the Royal Mail flotation price, the 
company was steady at 550p. as a stream of City research was released. Analysts 
at UBS - which was one of the banks up before the select committee - issued a 
sell note with a 450p price target. Barclays was also negative, with an equal 
weight rating and a 466p price target.

Meanwhile rival UK Mail jumped 30p to 615p after half year profits rose 63% to 
£11.9m, boosted by a strong performance from its parcels business.

Dixons Retail impressed analysts after showing off its new Currys PC World 
store in Aylesbury and its shares added 0.62p to 49.02p.

Finally Bonmarché, the value retailer, began life on Aim with a 20.5p increase 
on the 200p issue price.
