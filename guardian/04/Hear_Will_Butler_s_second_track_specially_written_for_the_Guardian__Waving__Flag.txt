I was barely alive for the Cold War. I mean, I was alive, but I don’t 
particularly remember it. I was born in 1982. But I still have a deep American 
kneejerk suspicion of Soviet communism. What can I say? Though, really, that 
suspicion is somewhat justified by the horrific history of the Soviet Union.

Anyway.


My initial reaction to reading about the repatriation of Moses Kotane’s body 
to South Africa from Russia was influenced by my distrust of communism. Was he 
really a great man? The answer: yes. And then I thought, how horrifying that my 
initial reaction to reading about a hero of the anti-apartheid movement was 
vague suspicion. For all their failings, the Communists were the only political 
entity in South Africa for years that talked about racial equality. They were 
the only integrated party for years and years. They worked for democracy and to 
help the poor. So, yes, I am an asshole.


Moses Kotane: nationalist, pro-Soviet great guy.

And then I was reading about the Ukraine separatists, our latest pro-Soviet 
nationalists, and I thought, man, what jerks. I don’t doubt that there are 
members of the separatists that genuinely feel like a beset upon minority. But 
the shape of the conflict is a historically powerful nation invading a 
historically weak one. Anyways.

This is a song about backward-looking violent nationalism contrasting with 
future-looking lift-up-the-weak nationalism. And then there’s me, a million 
miles away in America, watching from a great and blurring distance. Happy 
Tuesday!

Because of the Brits on Wednesday night, Will’s next track will appear on 
Thursday morning, followed by the fourth song on Thursday evening. His album 
Policy is released on Merge on 16 March
