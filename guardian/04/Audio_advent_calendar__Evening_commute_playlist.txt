Yesterday Domino Records brought you its playlist for a Monday morning commute.

 Now you need something to survive the rush hour, right? Well, here's ahometime 
playlist

and some words from the label:

Our second commute-themed playlist is the sound of celebration, rejoicing in 
the fact that another day of work is over, and the options of bed or a bar are 
suddenly available. Animal Collective at their most triumphant-sounding and the 
Feelies' comforting brand of "things are gonna be OK" pop figure alongside the 
propulsive racket of Caribou and the Fall. Put on your headphones and the let 
the music take you to a better place."
