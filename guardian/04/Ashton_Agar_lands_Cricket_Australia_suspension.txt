Last year's Ashes golden boy Ashton Agar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashton-agar> has been suspended from Western 
Australia's next four-day match for breaching the CA code of behaviour.

Agar was found guilty of showing dissent towards an umpire's decision during 
WA's Futures League match against Queensland earlier this week.

It was the 20-year-old's second similar offence within the past 18 months, 
meaning it was treated as a level two charge.

The sanction of two suspension points means he's out of WA's next Sheffield 
Shield match starting on 12 February against Tasmania.

Batting at No11 on his Test debut against England last July, Agar posted a 
record 98. The teenager became an instant sensation and his shock selection was 
toasted as a triumph.

However, the left-arm spinner was dropped after the next Test and hasn't been 
sighted during the Australian summer. He scored 93 against South Australia in 
November, but has otherwise struggled with bat and ball this season.

Agar admitted to the dissent charge and therefore a hearing wasn't required.
