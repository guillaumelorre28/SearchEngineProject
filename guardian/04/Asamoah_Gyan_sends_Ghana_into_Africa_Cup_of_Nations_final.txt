Asamoah Gyan scored the only goal as Ghana booked a place in the Africa Cup of 
Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> final with a 
victory over Nigeria. The Rennes striker struck in the 21st minute, with a 
powerful header from a Kwadwo Asamoah corner.

Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigeria-football-team> dominated 
the game but wasteful finishing, dogged defending and good saves from Wigan's 
Richard Kingston helped Ghana into the final for the first time since 1992. 
They will face Egypt, who beat Algeria 4-0 in the other semi-final.

Ghana's coach, Milovan Rajevac, said: "I told my players we were going to play 
to reach the final and not to produce beautiful football, only the result 
matters, it's all about the result.

"Nigeria had a few good chances. Our team is very young and we let them be 
dangerous because of this lack of experience. Defence is a very important thing 
in modern football."
