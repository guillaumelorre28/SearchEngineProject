Weedy but brainy

From Miss Wallace, no age given
Dear Carole, Here's an interesting quandary. I have an on-off boyfriend whom I 
care for deeply, but I am not sure if he is a good mate from a biological 
perspective. Physically, he is naturally very thin, prone to a limited diet, 
doesn't like to exercise, and smokes. However, mentally he is very intelligent, 
with a good memory, a constant interest in learning and teaching, and a liking 
for intellectual pursuits. From a modern human perspective, I prize his sharp 
mind, but the evolutionarily deeper rooted parts of me worry over his physical 
health and stature. Is he a fit mate? And if I started a family with him, would 
our offspring inherit his intelligence?

Carole replies:
Before humans lived in societies with written laws and law enforcers, 
naturally selected survival mechanisms such as brute strength and speed would 
have been crucial. But over countless generations as human civilisation has 
developed, traits such as a "liking for intellectual pursuits" have become 
sexually selected indicators of fitness.

Miss Wallace, your puny, nicotine-addicted boyfriend may not be able to 
intimidate reproductive rivals but he has nonetheless wooed you, on and off, 
with his excellent brain wiring.

With regard to the second part of your question, there are various forms of 
intelligence – including creative, emotional, and abstract reasoning – and 
these are all largely heritable through assortative mating. In addition, the "
Flynn effect <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect>" has been observed 
where IQ increases in the young over generations as nutrition and cognitive 
stimulation steadily improve. In other words, environment (including the foetal 
environment) may have an impact on brain development. So in addition to his 
genetic contribution, your brainy partner may help to provide an excellent 
environment for nurturing the nascent intelligence of your offspring.

Genes reproduce themselves and as 50% of your progeny's genome will be 
maternal DNA, you need also to take into account the quality of the maternal 
genes – something you fail to include in your equation. In your mind there 
seems to be a single trade-off between paternal genes for intelligence pitted 
against genes for a weedy morphology (shape). Nothing in genetics is ever that 
simple.

Incidentally, are you the naturally very thin boyfriend (posing here as your 
girlfriend)?! Either way, I suggest you take a long hard look at the person 
with whom you are considering breeding, at their parents and at yourself in the 
mirror, and then ask yourself: "Do I really want to see further versions of 
these for the rest of my life?"

I want to be alone

From an anonymous and ageless female
Dear Carole, I am a fairly sociable person who enjoys making her friends, 
colleagues and family laugh. I go out often, whether it be to the local pub 
with my friends or for a meal with my family. However, I don't like people 
coming round to my house "for a drink" or anything similar. It sounds selfish I 
know, but it's just something I've always felt. Perhaps it's because they 
overstay their welcome? I just don't know.

Carole replies:
You are happy to play the clown, but not on your territory. Many people do not 
like spontaneous callers to their home, and may be guarded and controlling 
where their possessions are concerned.

All humans are located somewhere on the autistic spectrum. The closer your 
personality is to the autistic end of the spectrum, and disorders including 
Asperger's syndrome and full-blown autism, the more inflexible you are likely 
to be about people "coming around for a drink". The closer you are to the 
empathic end of the spectrum the more likely it is that you will exhibit a 
flexible social benevolence irrespective of reciprocity.

Simon Baron-Cohen theorises that the male mind is more likely to be socially 
aloof and wired for abstract thought, whereas the female mind is more likely to 
be empathically and communicatively inclined. However, you do not need to be a 
man to have a male mind or a woman to have a female-wired mind.

Simply put, it is very likely the male-type mind evolved to focus on designing 
tools and the female-type mind evolved to "mind-read" – empathise with – her 
infant.

From your description, it seems in the past people have "overstayed their 
welcome" at your home, but since hardening your resolve against them I guess 
you are now unlikely to be exploited by freeloading slackers who want to crash 
on your sofa and raid your larder.

You may discover that your laughing friends start to find you aloof. There may 
come a time when you will want a favour or perhaps desire deeper understanding 
from a friend, but these things may not be forthcoming because you have always 
kept your distance.
