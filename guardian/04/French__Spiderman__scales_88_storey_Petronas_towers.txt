Alain Robert <https://www.theguardian.com/world/alain-robert>, 47, reached the 
top of the 452-metre (1,483ft) building at 7.30am local time and unfurled a 
Malaysian flag.

Robert, who suffers from vertigo after two severe falls in 1982, slipped past 
security to begin his climb of one of the tallest buildings in the world two 
hours earlier. He climbed bare-handed and with no ropes.

He was confronted by security guards as he descended the building and was 
detained at Dang Wangi police station in central Kuala Lumpur.

The station's chief officer told reporters that police were anxious to find 
out how Robert got into the country.The BBC reported that the climber could be 
charged with trespass after failing to obtain a permit for the stunt.

It was the Frenchman's third attempt at climbing the Petronas towers, having 
been thwarted in 1997 and 2007. He has made a career out of scaling some of the 
tallest structures in the world, including the Eiffel tower, One Canada Square 
in Canary Wharf and the Empire State building.

During the G20 summit in London this year he climbed to the ninth floor of the 
Lloyd's building in London and unfurled a 30-metre banner declaring there were 
100 months to save the planet.

In December 2004 he climbed the world's tallest building, Taipei 101, in 
Taiwan's capital.
