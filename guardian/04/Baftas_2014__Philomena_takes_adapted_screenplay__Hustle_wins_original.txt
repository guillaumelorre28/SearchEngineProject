American Hustle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-hustle> has won its 
third Bafta of the evening, for best original screenplay, written by David O 
Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Russell celebrated his actors in his acceptance 
speech, saying: "They make me write better and do everything better, because of 
their humanity."

Meanwhile, the adapted screenplay award was won by Steve Coogan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/coogan> and Jeff Pope for their work on 
Philomena, which Coogan also produced and co-starred in. Coogan thanked Martin 
Sixsmith (the journalist he portrayed in the film), Philomena Lee (whose story 
the film is based on) and he highlighted "the 60,000 other women" who are 
still, like Philomena before them, searching for children given up for adoption 
by Irish convents.

After mistaking his producer for theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh, Coogan 
heralded "his dream cast choice and someone I've fallen in love with, Dame Judi 
Dench", who played the title role.
