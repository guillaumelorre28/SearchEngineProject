A scrappy strike from the edge of the area which took a deflection off the 
Astana defender Denis Dedechko after 29 minutes will boost the confidence of
Martínez who has struggled to live up to his €35m (£24.8m) transfer fee from 
Porto

.

Saúl Ñíguez opened the scoring with a flick from the edge of the six-yard box 
after 22 minutes and Óliver Torres delicately chipped the ball over the Astana 
goalkeeper Nenad Eric after 63 minutes. A minute from time the rout was 
completed when Dedechko turned a Juanfran cross into his own net.

Diego Simeone’s side had plenty of possession but their passing lacked 
precision early on and most danger came from set pieces.

The Astana coach, Stanimir Stoilov, left eight players behind in Kazakhstan 
with the priority to keep them fresh for his side’s bid to win their domestic 
league.

Atlético’s Diego Godín went close with several headers from corners and it was 
no surprise that the breakthrough came from another corner, played short to 
Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco and his cross was clipped in at the near post by Saul.

Atlético Madrid have six points from three games in the group, the same as 
Benfica who lost 2-1 to Galatasaray

, while Kazakhstan’s Astana have one.
