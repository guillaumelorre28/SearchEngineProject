Traditionally, love poems were written in sonnet form, but they don’t have to 
be. Find the form that suits what you are going to say. It could be a haiku or 
even a limerick. Be true, be forthright, and don’t get caught up in other 
people’s ideas of what being in love is like, or some inherited ideal of a love 
poem. Concentrate on the realities of the person that you are dealing with. 
Don’t disguise them as some kind of ideal – they are going to want to feel 
that’s my poem, that’s my expression, that’s what we did together.

Here are my five rules:

1 Speak from your heart. Poets have in their toolbox every trick of rhetoric 
and linguistic structuring - from alliteration to zeugma. The toolbox is there 
to be ransacked, but the strength of your feelings might be diverted if you get 
too tied up with technical stuff.

2 Simply to say “I love you” or “you’re beautiful” is not interesting. 
Remember William Carlos Williams’ advice about writing - there is no truth but 
in things. So be particular. Things have a fascination that abstractions don’t. 
A reader will be more likely to identify with your poem if there are references 
to personal situations or particular features - be it their body, attitude or 
behaviour.

3 A sense of humour is not at odds with passionate intensity. Catching the 
ridiculousness of a situation doesn’t betray the subject or misrepresent the 
strength of your feelings. And don’t shy away from flaws. The whole business of 
being attracted to people is connected to their imperfections.

4 Pay attention to rhymes and rhythms and the sound your words make. The sound 
of the thing is as important as the dictionary definition of the words.

5 Revise, revise, revise. Our first thoughts are almost never our best.
