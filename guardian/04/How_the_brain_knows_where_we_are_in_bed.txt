Tracey Emin <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin> has recreated her 
notorious 1998 artworkMy Bed for a new exhibition at Tate Liverpool. Your bed 
might not be quite as messy as Tracey’s, but most people would admit to 
accumulating some level of clutter around their mattress.

Even in the dark, grabbing a glass of water, a pair of socks or a packet of 
condoms is surprisingly easy. How do your hands know where to reach when you 
can barely see a thing?

The answer lies in a part of the brain called the parietal cortex, which 
contains lots of different virtual maps of your current location. Each one is 
centred on different parts of the body or the space you’re in - it’s the 
brain’s way of understanding the world at your fingertips, around your head, 
and on the other side of the room.

As you toss and turn at night, the mind adapts its ‘virtual map’ of your bed 
relative to your sleeping position. It’s a little like when you tap the red 
compass on Google maps on your phone, and the map swivels around to fit your 
location. This means when you wake up you aren’t totally disorientated, and can 
easily find what you need - even if, like Emin, there’s also lots of stuff you 
want to avoid.
