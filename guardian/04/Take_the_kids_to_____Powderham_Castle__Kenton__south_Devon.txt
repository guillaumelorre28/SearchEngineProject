In a nutshell
A 600-year-old castle set in a historic deer park overlooking the river Exe in 
south Devon. There are hour-long tours of the lavish interior, highlighting 
glossy wood-pannelled rooms, secret doors and the Victorian kitchen but, for 
families, it’s all about the outdoor attractions. The walled garden has a 
wooden fort, mini zip line and petting farm with ponies, donkeys, pigs, all 
manner of fowl and tortoises plodding about. There are woodland trails and 
activity sheets for children to complete. The deer park safari is a pleasant 
trip but costs an extra £2.50.

Fun fact
A cannonball from the English civil war was found in a recently felled tree.

Best thing(s) about it
The picturesque setting, friendly staff and, in the school holidays, the 
Pocketwatch theatre group <http://www.pocketwatchtheatrecompany.com/> puts on 
great interactive performances in the grounds (included in the entry price). 
Coming up this summer are Fairytale, Wonderland and Robin Hood shows. The lack 
of crowds is another plus – I’ve been three times during half-term holidays and 
I’ve never seen a queue.

good cream teas (£4.50) and cake, and a hut sells local Salcombe ice-creams at 
£1.80 a scoop.

Exit through the gift shop?
