Cosmpolitan magazine has something of a scoop to celebrate its 40th birthday 
issue – a saucy centrefold featuring "naked" pictures of "Prince William" and 
"Prince Harry", reports theDaily Star. But, hang on a minute, it's not Harry 
and William at all! They're comedy lookalikes courtesy of snapperAlison Jackson
. Thank goodness for that. "To celebrate its birthday, Cosmopolitan, the 
magazine for smart young women, has given its readers the ultimate birthday 
present – nakedPrince William <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william> 
and Harry lookalikes," says a spokesman. Look at the size of those polo mallets.
