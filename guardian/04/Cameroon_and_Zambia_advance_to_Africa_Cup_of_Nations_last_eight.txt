Cameroon secured their place in the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> after twice coming 
from behind to earn a 2-2 draw against Tunisia in Lubango.

The Indomitable Lions, who needed at least a point to ensure qualification 
from Group D, fell behind after only 57 seconds thanks to a fine diving header 
from Amine Chermiti.

It stayed at 1-0 until a minute after half-time, when Samuel Eto'o equalised 
with a close-range effort, before an own goal from Aurélien Chedjou restored 
the advantage forTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>. But 
Landry N'Guemo responded instantly with an arrowed finish to give Paul Le 
Guen's team a place in the last eight.

In the closing stages Tunisia were reduced to 10 men when Ammar Jemal was sent 
off after receiving a second yellow card for an unnecessary push on Mohammadou 
Idrissou as the north Africans were eliminated.

Meanwhile, Zambia will join Cameroon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cameroon> in the knockout stages after 
beating Gabon, who were top of Group D before kick-off, 2-1.

Goals from Rainford Kalaba and James Chamanga earned Hervé Renard's side a 
deserved victory in Benguela despite the substitute Fabrice Do Marcolino's late 
effort.

But it came at a price, with both Kabala and the centre-half Kampamba Chintu 
collecting bookings which rule them out of the last eight clash.
