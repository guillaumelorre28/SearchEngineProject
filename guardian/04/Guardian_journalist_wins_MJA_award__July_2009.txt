Sarah Boseley has been voted health journalist of the year in the Medical 
Journalists' Association 
<http://www.mja-uk.org/userpage1.cfm?sid=161&ssid=161&e=1> (MJA) awards, 
beating off strong competition from Emily Cook of the Daily Mirror, and Kate 
Devlin and Rebecca Smith of the Daily Telegraph.

The award reflects a body of work over the past year, rather than specific 
articles, including national and international issues, from AIDS to the 
pharmaceutical industry.

Currently in Uganda reporting on the Guardian's Katine project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/katine>, Sarah was unable to receive her award in 
person.

The award is known as the "peer" prize because it is voted on by the the MJA's 
420 members who write for, edit or contribute to national, provincial and 
specialist publications, radio and television.
