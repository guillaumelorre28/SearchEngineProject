France


Jean-Noel Calon is a 55-year-old from a family of fishermen in Boulogne, 
NorthernFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>.


The mood is... Quietly optimistic. France usually do well on home soil. Michel 
Platini inspired us to a Euro 84 victory in Parc des Princes and the quality of 
Fabien Barthez, Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry won us the 1998 World Cup in 
Stade de France. We’re hoping for new heroes this summer. There’s great 
potential in midfield and up front, but the defence remains our Achilles’ heel. 
You could say that it’s EvraSagnastrophic. Our group looks relatively 
straightforward, though. The quarter-final will be the key game, no matter what 
team France face. Anything less than a semi-final place would be a 
disappointment.

Keep an eye out for... Antoine Griezmann should enjoy himself in the group 
stage. He’s had a terrific season for Atlético Madrid. The strength of Paul 
Pogba will be important in midfield and I expect Anthony Martial to turn a few 
heads. The loss of defender Raphaël Varane is a disaster. Someone else will 
need to step up at the back. At least goalkeeper Hugo Lloris looks one of the 
tournament’s strongest.

And England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>? You have produced 
the greatest underdogs of league football in the past: Nottingham Forest, 
Ipswich and now Leicester City. So let’s wait and see what happens.

Endrit Metolli is an 18-year-old student whose family are Albanians from 
Pristina, Kosovo.

The mood is... Buzzing. Albanian football fans can’t wait for the games to 
start. It’s the first time my country is taking part in a major tournament. It 
will be amazing to finally see our team playing on such a big stage. We believe 
we can progress from the group.

There’s cause for optimism because... We were strong in qualifying. We beat 
Portugal away and drew both games against Denmark. We didn’t concede a goal 
away from home, so hopefully we’ll be as tough to beat. The domestic league in
Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> isn’t very popular – 
everyone supports stronger teams from the leagues in England, Spain and Italy – 
but at the beginning of the 2015-16 season Skenderbeu, a team from the city of 
Korce, became the first Albanian team to reach the last qualifying round of the 
Champions League, and then the Europa League. This gained the support of all 
Albanians, no matter what city or team they supported. It was all new to us and 
a historic moment in our country’s footballing history.

The game I’m most looking forward to is... Our final group game against 
Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. They have a few 
players with Albanian backgrounds. Unusually, the two brothers Taulant Xhaka 
and Granit Xhaka will be facing each other. Hopefully our dream of getting 
through the group stage is still alive after the first two games. I plan to 
watch the games at the same local pub where hundreds of Albanians watched the 
qualifying matches. The atmosphere in there is just like being in a stadium. 
When Euro 2016 qualification was confirmed, we all ran out and began 
celebrating in the street with loud music and car horns.

Keep an eye out for... Our captain and defensive wall Lorik Cana. He turned 
down chances to play for other European national teams just so he could play 
for the country of his origin.He was the first Albanian to score in the Premier 
League during a short spell at Sunderland. Cana is crucial to our hopes this 
summer. He has a great influence on our younger players. Lazio goalkeeper Etrit 
Berisha also needs to have a good tournament.

Ian Browne was born in Bolton, but married a Romanian and settled in 
Bucharest. He watches Dinamo Bucharest regularly but also keeps track of 
Burnley’s results, having been a supporter since the 1970s.


Romania is... A good place to live. Not a great place, but definitely a good 
place. The people are friendly. One legacy of the communist education system is 
that everyone over 40 has read Dickens and Dostoyevsky, and can tell Beethoven 
from Brahms. People manage to be simultaneously both proud of being Romanian 
and disheartened by living inRomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>, which they see as beset by 
corrupt, self-serving and dishonest politicians.

The mood is... Pessimistic. It’s widely recognised the Romanian team is the 
weakest the country has produced in 50 years. We have as much natural ability 
as Northern Ireland, but none of their passion and self belief. The thought of 
Vlad Chiriches marking Antoine Griezmann in the opening game against France 
strikes fear into the heart of every Romanian. The overall level of football 
here is woeful. Dinamo’s centre forward Harlem Gnohere was recently signed on a 
free transfer from Mons in the Belgian Second Division. A club such as Dinamo, 
with a long tradition of European success, is reduced to picking up free 
transfers from Europe’s bargain basement.

How Romania will celebrate... Romania’s national drink is Tuica. It’s made 
from plums and is very strong. It’s like drinking petrol. Romanians are very 
proud of it. If we avoid three defeats and get a point, there will be plenty of 
it going around in the bars of Bucharest.

Keep an eye out for... Lucian Sanmartean, our 36-year-old creative talisman 
who plays for Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the best overall player in 
the squad is Mihai Pintili of Steaua Bucurest, but my favourite player is 
Gabriel Torje. He wears his heart on his sleeve. In an age when many 
footballers are accused of being mercenaries, our players at least look as 
though they regard it as an honour to be selected for the national team, rather 
than an opportunity to raise their market value. Our secret weapon, if it goes 
to penalties, is defender Cosmin Moti, whowent in goal for Ludogorets 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh8SRA0s1T8> for the last five minutes of a 
Champions League play-off game against Steaua. In the penalty shootout, he 
scored the first for Ludogorets and then saved two.

 Will Xherdan Shaqiri, the ‘Alpine Messi’, inspire Switzerland at Euro 2016? 
Photograph: Jean Paul Thomas/Icon Sport via Getty Images 
Ludovic Farine is from Fribourg in Switzerland.

The mood is... Calm. We don’t have high expectations because we don’t want to 
be too disappointed if things go wrong. If we go beyond the group stage, we 
will be very happy. A place in the quarter-finals is a strong possibility, but 
we don’t usually progress much further than that. France are the strong 
favourites in the group, and both Romania and Albania are capable of 
frustrating us defensively.

I’m most looking forward to seeing... Switzerland playing France in the final 
group game in Lille. We have a friendly rivalry with the French. Everyone likes 
beating their neighbours, don’t they? And we want our revenge after the 5-2 
defeat at the last World Cup in Brazil. We can do better than that!

Keep an eye out for... My favourite player Xherdan Shaqiri. He’s young, 
creative and scores some phenomenal goals. He’s not called the “Alpine Messi” 
for nothing.

 Eric Dier will be hoping to help England’s defence. Photograph: Matthew 
Ashton/AMA/Getty Images 
Xander Wood is a 24-year-old student from London. He is going to France for 
the group stage.

The mood is... One of excitement but with few expectations. We could be 
something of a dark horse if our defence clicks, but I’m not holding my breath. 
Our lack of solid options at centre-back is worrying. Gary Cahill is our best 
option on paper, but he’s had a terrible season at Chelsea. John Stones is 
promising, but playing for an Everton side that gave away leads for fun under 
Roberto Martínez last season can’t have been good for his confidence. Eric Dier 
has been a revelation as a defensive midfielder and he should help shield our 
back four. Against the top sides England will leak goals, and that will 
ultimately be our undoing.

The key problem is... We have a stubborn manager. After the disappointing 2014 
World Cup I don’t have much faith in Roy Hodgson picking the right team. He is 
far too loyal to players picked before. Wayne Rooney did well in qualifying 
against modest opposition, but that shouldn’t guarantee him a place in the 
starting XI and nor should his reputation. The recent friendly against Portugal 
showed that shoehorning him into the starting lineup means that our three most 
in form attacking players - Kane, Alli and Vardy have to be played out of 
position.Picking Jack Wilshere is also a huge gamble, with the Arsenal man 
having played so little football this year.

The game I’m most looking forward to is... England against Slovakia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovakia>. I’ll be in the stands at Stade 
Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne for the final game of the group stage. It 
will also be very interesting to see how we fare in the second group match 
against Wales – how will our fragile defence cope with an on-song Gareth Bale?

Keep an eye out for... Our exciting young players. Dele Alli and Harry Kane 
have been on fire this season. If Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling also hit 
form, England should at least be dangerous in the final third.

England will reach... The quarter-finals, where we’ll be beaten by the first 
quality team we play. It’s a depressing thought, given how exciting our 
attacking options are but in big tournaments it’s much more important to be 
able to defend than score, especially in the knock-out stages.

Daniela Kubikova is a 20-year-old from Zilina in north-west Slovakia.

The best thing about growing up in Slovakia was... Playing football with my 
brothers. With three of them around I was always going to fall in love with 
football. As a child I was a big fan of MSK Zilina. They still play in the the 
Fortuna Liga, the top tier in our domestic leagues. I spent many happy 
afternoons watching football with my dad and brothers growing up.

The mood is... One of pride. We have a good group of players with excellent 
team spirit. Slovakia are unbeaten in their last seven international 
friendlies. This run includes strong wins against Switzerland and a 3-1 victory 
overGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> away. We still don’t 
expect too much, but this team can exceed modest expectations if they keep 
playing for each other. As a unit Slovakia look strong.

Keep an eye out for... Marek Hamsik is probably our biggest profile, but my 
favourite players are winger Robert Mak, who plays for Greek side PAOK, and 
Miroslav Stoch who is another creative force in the side. I still rate our 
captain Martin Skrtel highly too.

Craig Hawes was born in Neath and grew up in Briton Ferry, a small village 
near Swansea.

When I’m away from Wales, I miss... The camaraderie and greenery. We’re a 
friendly bunch overall and, with a population of just over 3 million, I think 
there’s a camaraderie with the Welsh that bigger countries lack. I can see the 
Welsh and English football fans enjoying a pint together in France, when we 
play each other, whatever the result. I’m just moving back to the UK after 
several years in Dubai and I’ve missed the valleys and forests of home so much. 
And there seems to be a medieval castle in every Welsh town. You take it for 
granted when you live there, butWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> is teeming with history wherever 
you go.

The mood is... Happy to have finally reached a major tournament. We haven’t 
reached one since a solitary Pele goal knocked us out of the quarter-finals of 
the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. I’m optimistic we can get out of our group. We 
will have to beat Slovakia, and hope for a point or two against England and
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia>, but we can do it. I 
remember Ireland beating England at Euro 88 and it fills me with optimism.

We’re all praying... Gareth Bale stays fit. No one else in the team is on his 
level and he won some of our qualifiers almost single-handedly. He is without a 
doubt the best Welsh footballer since John Charles had a successful five-year 
spell with Juventus in the late 1950s and 1960s. He was once voted the club’s 
best ever foreign player, and Bale will surely hit the same heights during his 
career.

Keep an eye out for... The captain Ashley Williams. Despite recognising the 
genius of Gareth Bale, and his indispensability to the team, Ashley is 
criminally underrated. As a Swansea City fan, I’ve enjoyed seeing him develop 
at the club, where he’s only missed a handful of games in about eight years. To 
Swansea fans he’s our rock, an indestructible superhero. And he’s a Williams. 
Every Welsh sports team, whether it’s rugby, football or water polo, needs a 
couple of them on the team sheet.

quarter-final against Holland. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images 
Stepan Puzyrnikov is a 29-year-old plating engineer from Ivanovo, central 
Russia.

When growing up in Ivanovo... Our local football team was named Tekstilshchik 
Ivanovo. The name of the team is derived from the word textile, because that’s 
the industry the city is famous for. The team has never had any money and are 
currently in the Russian third division.

The mood is... Measured. We didn’t do very well four years ago, after a 
fantastic display in 2008, but we all respect and support our national team. 
The European Championship means a great deal here. Whenever they are on, people 
are out on the streets watching their team play on a huge video screens, arms 
around shoulders and cheering. Not many Russian football fans are going to make 
it to France this summer, because the travelling costs are too high. But at 
least we won’t have to go anywhere in 2018!

My favourite Euro memory is... Andrey Arshavin lighting up Euro 2008 in 
Switzerland and Austria. He was fast and scored plenty of goals. His career 
stagnated a little bit at Arsenal, but he is still very popular here. We may 
not have an attacking partnership as lethal as Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko 
in our current squad, but if the team sticks together we can definitely reach 
the knock-out stages.

The mood is... Pretty good again. Losing Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per 
Mertesacker to retirement was a hit, and there’s uncertainty surrounding the 
fitness of Bastian Schweinsteiger. The performances in the qualifiers weren’t 
always very convincing, but the 4-1 win against Italy in March gave us all a 
bit more hope. There have been some disappointing friendly defeats since then 
though. As has been the norm under Joachim Löw, we should reach the 
semi-finals. Then it’s down to luck. I’m hopeful but probably less so than two 
years ago.

Germany’s best group game will be... Against Poland and Robert Lewandowski. 
Northern Ireland and Ukraine should be relatively straightforward games, but we 
often have one weak showing in the group stages. If it’s against Poland, 
Lewandowski will punish us.

My favourite Germany player is... Thomas Müller. Maybe not as naturally gifted 
as other players in the squad, but he is capable of producing a goal when we 
really need it. Philipp Lahm is my favourite player of all time. Pep Guardiola 
said he was the smartest player he’s ever worked with and I can see that. He 
was also a considerate, well-liked captain. Lahm’s goal in the sixth minute of 
the 2006 World Cup opener against Costa Rica was the first time I had ever seen 
Germany live. Moments like that are hard to forget.

After winning the group I hope we get to play... England. I have a lot of 
respect for the way they came back to win the recent friendly in Berlin 3-2 and 
think it would be a tight game, but I expect us to be more focused and sharper 
during a tournament. I obviously hope it’ll go to penalties, because we all 
know what happens then.

My interest in football comes from... My dad. He brought me and my sister 
along to Glentoran FC and Northern Ireland games from a young age. My favourite 
player was definitely David Healy. He was at his prime scoring goals against
Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain> and England when I was just 
a kid.

My favourite thing about Northern Ireland is... The people. We’re the most 
approachable bunch in the world. Over the past years our achievements in sport 
alone have helped put us as a country on the map. When Rory McIlroy is hitting 
hole-in-ones and Carl Frampton is swinging knock-out punches, we cheer together.

The mood is... A mood I have never known before. Everyone is buzzing in 
anticipation of 12 June for our first match. This season has been the season of 
the underdogs in British football. Going intoEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> we are massive underdogs, but 
the most beautiful thing about football is that anything can happen. Given our 
two most recent friendlies against Belarus and Slovakia extended our unbeaten 
run to 12 games, I have absolute faith in the team and Michael O’Neill. The 
team has already exceeded all expectations and we couldn’t be more proud of 
them.

Our biggest challenge will be... Facing Germany. While my heart wants big Kyle 
Lafferty to put a few past Manuel Neuer, my head says facing the current world 
champions will be the sternest of tests. The key will be to get good results 
against Ukraine and Poland. A win and a draw in those two games might be enough 
to progress.

My favourite Northern Ireland player is... Jamie Ward. He played exceptionally 
throughout the qualifying campaign.

Ewhen Chymera is a third generation Ukrainian working for Leeds council. 

Growing up in the UK... I attended a Ukrainian school on Saturdays where I 
learned to read and write in Ukrainian.

My first Ukraine game was... A Euro qualifier against France in Paris in March 
1999. It was a 0-0 draw and it meant we finished second in the group, 
eventually losing a playoff against Slovenia over two legs.

The mood is... Hopeful. I’m resigned to the fact that Germany will top Group 
C, but the game against our neighbours Poland is the one I’m looking forward to 
the most. It’s a game that will likely decide who finishes as runners-up in the 
group so there’s a lot riding on it. Marseille’s Stade Velodrome is a stadium I 
can’t wait to see and experience. I think starting against Germany is 
beneficial to us, as anything we pick up against them is a bonus. But we really 
need to beat Northern Ireland.

Keep an eye out for... Our terrific duo Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen 
Konoplyanka. On their day, they are as good as any attacking player in Europe. 
They have both carried the flag for Ukrainian football since the retirement of 
Andriy Shevchenko. Yarmolenko is the player Ukraine and Dynamo Kyiv will always 
turn to for something special. His loyalty to Dynamo was also highlighted this 
year, when he signed a new contract to ensure the club where his footballing 
education took place receives a transfer fee before an inevitable move away 
this summer. Ukraine has produced three Ballon d’Or winners – Oleh Blokhin in 
1975, Igor Belanov in 1986 and Shevchenko in 2004. If we were to produce 
another, it will surely be either Yarmolenko or Konoplyanka.

Before the first game in Lille I’ll be... On my bike. I’m one of seven riders 
taking part in the Ride for Ukraine. Our aim is to raise money for those 
affected by the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. We’re riding 200 miles 
from London to Lille, in time for our first game against Germany on Sunday 12 
June.

Daniela Miernik was born in Warsaw and brought up in the Mazovian region. 

Poland is... Fast-growing, vibrant, bang in the middle of Europe, with so many 
opportunities.

The mood is... One of excitement. We have a team that can leave their mark on 
the competition. Some bookies have gone as far as saying we’re the dark horse 
of the championship. While that might be slightly optimistic, our national team 
has plenty of household names. Whatever European league you follow, I’m pretty 
certain you have heard the names Lewandowski, Arkadiusz Milik, Wojciech 
Szczęsny, Grzegorz Krychowiak and Kamil Grosicki. I’m 100% sure Poland will get 
through to the quarter-finals at least. Will the team be parading the trophy 
down the streets of Warsaw after the 10 July final? Who knows. We are a hopeful 
and ambitious nation, and always aim as high as we can.

Keep an eye out for... Sevilla midfielder Krychowiak. Having just won the 
Europa League, he should have a taste for success. He also uses hisInstagram 
account <https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.krychowiak/?hl=en> to document his 
flamboyant clothes. No one can pull off wearing a Gucci coat and loafers like 
this guy. Brave dresser, great player: win-win.

Jose Alberto Miras Franco is from Águilas, a coastal village in the Murcia 
region.

The mood is... Quietly confident. Spain is still a powerful team but it might 
not be as easy as in previous tournaments. We crashed down to earth during the 
World Cup in Brazil but we’ve had time to consolidate. Germany and England have 
squads with higher potential than they’ve had before. I’d be happy with a 
semi-final place.

Vicente del Bosque is... A brave man. Fernando Torres, Juan Mata and Diego 
Costa are high-profile players who did not make the squad. It’s a bold decision 
by the coach and I hope it proves to be the right one.

The game I’m most looking forward to is... The first group game against Czech 
Republic in Toulouse. The first game will give us a lot of answers about how 
far we can go. We need to get off to a good start. On paper we should qualify 
from Group D but football is not always about quality. Our players need to have 
the right attitude.

My favourite player is... Andrés Iniesta. He’s a synonym of respect, 
experience and quality. If Spain are to be successful again this summer, 
Iniesta will have a huge role to play.

 Matej Sinlovca. 
Matej Sinlovca is from Split, but is currently finishing a pharmacy degree at 
the University of East Anglia.

My footballing hero is... Niko Kranjcar. I was just too young to see legend 
Davor Suker, so Kranjcar was the first name I printed on to a chequered shirt. 
I was proud to wear the No19 jersey wherever I went.

The mood is...Nervous. On our day we can compete with the three other teams in 
the group. We almost shocked Spain in 2012 after all. Turkey and Czech Republic 
will both be fighting for the second spot, so there is little room for error.

The most glaring squad omission is... Dejan Lovren. The defender fell out with 
head coach Ante Cacic before the tournament. It has left a gaping hole in our 
back four.

Never mind, at least we have... Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, possibly the 
best centre-midfield pairing in the world. Coupled with other stars such as 
Mario Mandzukic up front, Real Madrid’s Mateo Kovacic, and the timeless Darijo 
Srna leading by example at the back, we have plenty of exciting players. We 
also boast a young squad bursting with potential – Ante Coric and Alen 
Halilovic will hopefully have their breakthroughs this summer.

A successful tournament would be... Pushing Germany all the way in a 
quarter-final. To give the world champions a difficult game would make it an 
excellent tournament for Croatia. It would leave us with plenty of hope for the 
next World Cup in Russia.

The mood is... Subdued. Because of political matters in Turkey, football is 
not a hot topic at the moment. I’m proud of how we bounced back from some poor 
results early on in the qualifying group to win three in a row against Holland, 
Czech Republic and Iceland. We didn’t concede one goal in those three games and 
ended up qualifying for Euro 2016 as the best third-placed team. Our recent 
games against Sweden and England have produced mixed results, but the 
performances show we can be competitive on our day.

Turkey will... Get out of the group and reach the quarter-finals. Back in 
2008, we had challenging games against both Croatia and Czech Republic, but we 
beat them both and I think we can get the better of them. Spain will win the 
group for sure.

My favourite player of all time is... Sergen Yalcin. I support Besiktas and 
the former midfielder was an important character for the club. He was extremely 
talented but, like a lot of Turkish players, his temperament wasn’t always the 
best.

 Will Petr Cech and Czech Republic have enough quality to get through the group 
stage? Photograph: David W Cerny/Reuters 
Iain Sellars swapped Manchester for Prague over 20 years ago after falling in 
love with the Czech capital while on holiday.

The team close to my heart is... Slavia Prague. Having been the team for 
“intellectuals” during the communism years, Slavia were forced to change their 
name and leave their stadium. In the 1995-96 season they won the league for the 
first time since 1947 and also reached the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup. 
Unfortunately, Bordeaux were too strong over the two legs. That team contained 
players such as Karel Poborsky, Vladimir Smicer, Radek Bejbl and Jan Suchoparek 
who shone at Euro 96, when Czech Republic reached the final.

The mood is... Cautious. We’re aware of the current squad’s limitations. Tomas 
Rosicky’s apparent return to fitness is a cause for optimism but coach Pavel 
Vrba seems to be pinning all his hopes on our fragile captain. The group looks 
tough, but an early win will increase expectancy levels to fever pitch and the 
old town squares of the country’s major cities will be awash with beer and 
sausage addled hordes watching on big screens.

I wish we still had... Pavel Nedved. The national team still lacks someone 
that can take a game by the scruff of the neck when needed.


I’m glad we’ve got rid of... Golden and silver goals. It was bad enough 
suffering a golden goal defeat at Euro 96 in the final to Germany, but the 
silver goal defeat to Greece in 2004 was even harder to stomach. That should’ve 
been Czech Republic’s year, having beaten Germany and Netherlands in the group 
stages before waltzing over Denmark in the quarter-finals. It was a cruel way 
to depart a tournament they had dominated. I’d be happy to reach any kind of 
knock-out stage this time around!

Keep an eye out for... Sparta Prague winger Borek Dockal is capable of causing 
opposition defenders problems. Ladislav Krejci is another young bright spark. 
We rely on these two to provide lone striker Tomas Necid with decent service, 
but he is struggling for from. He hasn’t scored for his Turkish club Bursaspor 
for several months. We certainly miss the the psychical presence of Jan Koller 
and the speed of Milan Baros in the final third.

 Can Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon lead Italy from the back this summer? 
Photograph: Kerstin Joensson/AP 
Federica D’Andria is an Inter Milan fan who works for an advertising agency in 
Rome.

The mood is... Negative. But this is usually the mood before every major 
tournament. We start off believing we’ll be eliminated after losing all three 
group games, before thinking we’ll win the whole thing after one impressive 
performance early on. There is no in-between.

Head coach Antonio Conte is...Not loved by everyone. Having already agreed to 
manage Chelsea, many fear his thoughts are elsewhere. Juventus fans have stayed 
loyal to their ex-manager more than supporters of other clubs – they struggle 
to get behind him. If Conte wins the tournament, all will be forgotten of 
course, just like Marcello Lippi did in the 2006 World Cup.

The Italy squad is missing... A wow factor. We don’t have enough players in 
the squad who can make a difference. We particularly look a bit short in the 
final third.

My favourite Italian player is... Gianluigi Buffon. He is a legend. Completely 
indestructible. If anyone can get this team going, it will be our leader at the 
back.

 Sweden players celebrate a goal against Wales in their recent 3-0 friendly 
win. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters 
Rickard Widegren is a Jonkopings Sodra fan living in southern Sweden.

The mood is... Sceptical. I don’t think we’ll do that well. We look quite weak 
overall. The 3-0 friendly win over Wales has lifted hopes a little, but I don’t 
think we have the quality to beat either Italy or Belgium.

We still rely too heavily on... Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He claimed to have sent 
the whole of Denmark into retirement after our playoff win which got us to 
France, but if he has an off-day in France, we have very few other stars in the 
making. Our other striker John Guidetti has Ibrahimovic’s self belief but 
remains unproven on the big stage.


We are weakest in... Midfield. We are in a transitional period and our 
midfield is particularly unproven. We are also missing our best defender in 
Oscar Wendt. The Borussia Mönchengladbach left-back fails to see eye to eye 
with coach Erik Hamren.

The best thing at Euro 2016 will be... Our fans. Watch out for that big yellow 
wall of noise.

Natalie McLaughlin grew up in the village of Malin in County Donegal.

The mood is... Through the roof! From the moment the hangovers began to 
subside on the morning of 16 November 2015 and the reality of what had just 
happened the previous night began to sink in, the excitement buzzometer has 
pretty much stayed there. What started off as a dream has suddenly developed 
into French flight times, the best landmarks to meet at and questions like: “Do 
you thinks there’s much chance of a ticket if I just land?”

With my feet still relatively close to the ground I think... We can reach the 
quarter-finals. But I consider myself to be a fairly optimistic person. If 
Sweden take the upper hand in the first game, we’re pretty much done already. 
I’m allowing myself to dream.

The match I’m looking forward to most is... Our last group game against Italy. 
Mostly for sentimental reasons. We have a long history together as fans and to 
most people over a certain age in Ireland the mere mention of Italia 90 is 
enough to crack a smile on even the most sceptical of sports fans. Their raw 
emotion coupled with our sheer willingness to celebrate almost anything is a 
recipe for a summer night to remember.

My favourite player is... Shane Long. He scores important goals in important 
games and I’m excited to see what he can produce during the tournament. My 
favourite player of all time is Paul McGrath. He was the Irish football hero of 
my generation – a great player and man.

Eden Renders is a builder from Itterbeek, a village near Brussels.

The mood is... Cautious but optimistic. We have one of the best teams in the 
world, but we’re famous for our “let’s wait and see” attitude. It’s very unlike 
our neighbours the Dutch, whose self-confidence is always a source of hilarity 
for the quiet and modest Belgian. I’ll miss them at this tournament.


We’ll progress through the group if... We keep the self-declared legend and 
genius Zlatan Ibrahimovic quiet when we play Sweden. We won’t win against 
Italy. They are too experienced and smart. The Republic of Ireland will be a 
tough game too. I look forward to that one, they have great supporters.

We can go far if... We have luck on our side. We’re missing key defenders 
Vincent Kompany and Nicolas Lombaerts, so hopefully Eden Hazard and Kevin De 
Bruyne will step up to the task. If they have good tournaments, then anything 
is possible.

session before Euro 2016. Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images 
Bruno Aguiar is from Lisbon and works in the telecom industry. 

Portuguese people are... Some of the warmest, friendliest and helpful human 
beings. Surprisingly modest too if all you know is Cristiano Ronaldo and José 
Mourinho!

The mood is... One of reserved optimism. Clearly a lot depends on Ronaldo 
being fit, but if he’s in the mood, Portugal have a great chance of building up 
momentum. The semi-finals are a realistic target. Anything less than a Group F 
win would be a huge disappointment. I have tickets for the knock-out rounds and 
it would be unbearable if Portugal were already on a plane home.

Keep an eye out for... Our promising younger players. Portugal’s coach 
Fernando Santos tends to stick with the experienced older heads but we have a 
lot of young players with great potential. If we have safely progressed to the 
knock-out stages after two games, then youth might get a chance. Only Austria 
could be a real threat in the group.

Cristiano Ronaldo can only be matched by... Luís Figo. He was my hero growing 
up. I’m too young to have experienced the genius of Eusébio.

Austria is... An amazing yet challenging place. The recent presidential 
election showed that rightwing opinions are yet again on the rise. Even though 
Vienna is a somewhat more moderate melting pot of different cultures and 
opinions, you can grasp the growing nationalism even here.

The mood is... One of excitement. The Panini stickers are everywhere and 
Vienna’s outdoor restaurants are getting ready to put up their big screens.

This summer is particularly interesting because... For the first time in ages 
Austria look like they might have a chance! I used to cry watching our 
international games because they were so bad. Usually people run around with 
shirts and flags of their favourite international teams, but this time there 
will be a lot of Austrian shirts and flags too.

The game I’m most looking forward to is... Our second group game against 
Portugal. I’m not sure we’ll be able to get the better of Ronaldo, but I hope 
the Austrian boys will shine. The most important games will be against Iceland 
and Hungary. Hopefully we’ll win them both and progress to the knock-out stages.

My favourite Austria player is... David Alaba. He’s a great player and a local 
hero. A lot of the team’s success or failure this summer will be down to him. 
No pressure!

Horvat/AP 
Eggert Stefansson is from Reykjavik.

Growing up in Iceland was... Wonderful. I grew up in the Reykjavik suburb of 
Breioholt, which was a new area that didn’t have any real infrastructure in 
place to practice sports in the 1980s. There were plenty of building sites to 
get injured on though. My brother and I started playing football in the summer 
and handball in the winter for our local team Vikingur. This is a very 
Icelandic thing to do. Sending kids outside to play football in December is 
harsh.

Iceland is... Spacious. Most of us are huddled together in the south-west 
corner of the country. This makes it possible to get a bit of an urban feel 
without losing the village vibe.

The mood is... Slightly surreal. We’re still in a state of shock that our boys 
have qualified for a major tournament for the first time. We almost made it to 
Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, but lacked the experience and composure to beat 
Croatia over two legs. Of course our women’s team qualified for the Uefa 
Women’s Euro 2009 competition, but their achievement attracted a lot less media 
attention.

Our qualifying campaign was... Incredible. Beating the Dutch home and away was 
an amazing achievement.

Prospects of getting through to the knock-out stages are... Slim. But the team 
has already exceeded everyone’s expectations. The Hungary game is probably our 
best chance of getting a result, but our head-to-head record against them is 
not great. Hopefully we’ll not resort to parking the bus and playing long balls 
just to try and progress through the group stage. Positive, attacking football 
got us this far, so I hope we keep it up. I will be ecstatic if we score a 
goal. It doesn’t have to be a good goal. I’ll even go crazy if it’s an own goal.

Keep an eye out for...T he vision and technique of Gylfi Sigurdsson, the brute 
force of Aron Gunnarsson (PLEASE don’t get sent off), the pace of Kolbeinn 
Sigthorsson, and the composure and experience of Eidur Gudjohnsen. AFRAM 
ISLAND!!!

Lenard Lajtos is a 19-year-old student from Budapest. 

The mood is... Very excited. I’m traveling to the Stade Vélodrome stadium in 
Marseille for our second group match against Iceland and am counting down the 
days. This is the strongest Hungarian team in over a decade. We have no real 
position in the starting XI that lacks the required quality. The whole country 
is behind them. I also never thought I’d see legendary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly 
showing off his grey sweatpants at a major tournament.

Our best chance of a win is against... Iceland. We are underdogs but should be 
able to get at least a point. We’ve beaten all the other Nordic countries in 
recent years, so Iceland is the last one to tick off the list.

Keep an eye out for... Nemanja Nikolic. He was the top scorer in the Polish 
Ekstraklasa with Legia Warsaw. Balazs Dzsudzsak still has an amazing left foot, 
while the experienced midfielder Zoltan Gera will hopefully inspire and guide 
the young duo Adam Nagy and Laszlo Kleinheisler.
