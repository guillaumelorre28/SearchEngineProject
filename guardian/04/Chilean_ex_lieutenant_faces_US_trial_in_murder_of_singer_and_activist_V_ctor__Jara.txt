A former lieutenant in the Chilean army under Augusto Pinochet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet> will face a civil trial in Florida 
this month for his involvement in the 1973 murder of Chilean folk singer Víctor 
Jara, according to the US human rights group bringing the suit.

 Jara, also a poet and political activist, inspired generations of artists 
from U2 to Bruce Springsteen with his lyrical odes to the working class. A 
communist, he fell afoul of the Chilean government when the leftist president 
Salvador Allende was overthrown by rightwing Pinochet in a bloody 1973 military 
coup.

During Pinochet’s rule, which lasted until 1990, an estimated 3,200 people 
were killed and 28,000 tortured by the state. According to Chilean court 
documents, Jara was shot dead by soldiers in Santiago’s EstadioChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile>, which served as a mass detention and 
torture center in the early days the military government. His death soon became 
a potent symbol of the era’s abuses.

 A high-ranking official was arrested for his involvement in the murder in 
2008, and in 2012 a Chilean judgeordered the arrest of an additional eight 
soldiers

.

But one of those soldiers, Pedro Pablo Barrientos Núñez lives in Deltona, 
Florida <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida>, rather than Chile, and 
the United States has not acted on Chile’s extradition request.

In 2013, the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), an organization 
dedicated to preventing severe human rights abuses, filed a civil suit against 
Barrientos on behalf of Jara’s widow and daughters. The trial is set to take 
place in the district court in Orlando from June 13 to 29, the group said on 
Thursday.

 According to the organization, a jury will be asked to find Barrientos 
legally responsible and will be asked to award punitive and compensatory 
damages.

 “We stand by allegations that he was the one who tortured and murdered Víctor 
Jara, or at the very least he aided and abetted in his death, and in either 
case he is liable for what happened,” the CJA’s executive director, Dixon 
Osburn, told Reuters.

 Osburn added that the CJA hoped the civil trial will push US authorities to 
act on Chile’s extradition request, and will shed light on the abuses that took 
place in the Estadio Chile in the days after the coup.

 Legal representatives for Barrientos could not be immediately reached for 
comment.
