What’s your pre-show routine?
I’m normally in the loo! I like a bit of quiet time in the dressing room. 
Quite a lot of sushi gets eaten. I can’t have anything too heavy or I fall 
asleep. You have to be careful, you see. I was in a seaside town once, it 
might’ve been Southend, and I had a lovely fish-and-chip supper and a fizzy 
drink before I went on, I was only on for 10 minutes and I felt all 
light-headed and weird. It’s not like when I was in my 20s up in Edinburgh, 
staying up all night drinking, eating hardly anything, and you’re still fine.

You’re on tour with your show Little Victories – does it feel different to 
your “comeback” standup show, Life is Pain (2012)?
It’s a better show than Life is Pain, and much more personal. That had more 
generic standup in it that you could sell on to Jason Manford or Micky 
Flanagan. You couldn’t do that with this material – it’s about my kids, my 
father, my sexual frustration. I wrote it when I was 47, so there aren’t any 
jokes about computer games, or whatever young people do these days. But my 
feeling is that as a comedian, that’s what you’re aiming for – a show that 
nobody else could do.


It changes as the tour goes on. I chop and change things to get the balance a 
bit better. I knowBrian Logan came down to see it in Croydon a while ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/alan-davies-review> and I didn’t 
quite have the balance right then. He made a few comments that were fair enough.

You talk about your relationship with your dad in the show. How would you 
describe him?
Well, he’s very elderly now, he’s 81, and he’s got Alzheimer’s. That is a 
difficult thing with the show – as you describe him like that and then you’re 
finding fault with things he did when he was younger. The audience don’t like 
it: “He’s old and sick, what are you doing slagging him off?” I’ve found a way 
through it. The majority of jokes fall on me – I’m the idiot.

His story is that my mother died of leukaemia when I was six, and he was left 
with an eight-year-old, a six-year-old and a three-year-old. He didn’t have the 
domestic skills, he didn’t have the time, he worked as an accountant in the 
city, he commuted to Liverpool Street every morning and my mum was supposed to 
be at home with the kids – that’s how things were going to be. Then suddenly he 
was on his own.

Now I’ve got two kids, and the idea of losing my wife and having to cope on my 
own is really terrifying. So I’m more sympathetic to some of the choices he 
made than I once was. But I’m still able to find fault.

What’s the most you’ve ever laughed at a comedian?
The best comedy I’ve ever seen was Dave Allen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries>
. I was in physical pain. He had so much life experience and so much opinion. I 
interviewed him twice, and he talked about the need to back off sometimes, to 
give the audience time to recover from the laughter – like it’s a superpower.


Without any hint of arrogance he said that once a guy in his audience broke a 
rib. He was so calm off-stage, he never cracked jokes, just talked rationally, 
gave a wry grin every now and then. He said, “Yeah, you have to be careful or 
you’ll hurt people.”

The other one that comes to mind is Bill Cosby at the Albert Hall in the 
1990s, getting a standing ovation. He didn’t just make you laugh, there was a 
warmth and sincerity to him, he really connected with you on an emotional 
level. He was an amazingly good comedian, the entire thing was about marriage 
and the ups and downs of family life. It’s a bit weird talking about him now…

As a big Bill Cosby fan what was your reaction to the allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/26/hannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-taboo>
 against him?
It’s alarming in the extreme. Drugging people? Raping them? Really? [Cosby has 
denied the allegations]. You start thinking, ‘Who can I trust if you can’t 
trust someone like him?’ All these people who were family entertainers or had 
kids’ shows, all it says to me is, sexual abuse is everywhere. If everyone 
wrote down the stories they’d heard or things they’d experienced themselves, 
there’d be a mountain of paper. And I’m talking about friends I know. It all 
depends on the silence of the abused, and the large majority of people are 
still silent. I suppose you have to say, ‘It’s good that it’s coming out.’
