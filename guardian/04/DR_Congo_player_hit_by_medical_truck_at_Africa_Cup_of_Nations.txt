Insult was added to injury at the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> for Gabriel Zakuani 
after he was almost run over by a medicsâ€™ buggy during the quarter-final 
between DR Congo and Congo.

The DR Congo and Peterborough United defender was being treated for an injury 
early in the second half when the small truck ran into him as he was lying on 
the ground.

The former Leyton Orient player looked far from happy with the incident, even 
if the driver of the buggy did appear to brake just before the incident could 
have become more serious.

Zakuani left the field shortly after and his DR Congo side were soon 2-0 
behind without him before a stunning recovery with four goals in the closing 25 
minutes to reach the semi-finals.

Zakuani will hope to have recovered in time to take part in that, against 
Ivory Coast on Wednesday when they look to reach the final for the first time.

In the other semi-final the hosts Equatorial Guinea will face Ghana.
