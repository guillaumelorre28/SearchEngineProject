The 29-year-old becomes the fourth player from Adelaide’s victorious A-League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> grand final side to leave the 
club during the off-season, following Stefan Mauk (NEC), Craig Goodwin (Sparta 
Rotterdam) and Bruce Kamau (Melbourne City).

Djite was in good form last season, scoring 11 goals in Adelaide’s final 14 
games, and he leaves with a total of 35 goals to his name in 133 appearances 
across two stints with the club.

His departure leaves coach Guillermo Amor with only one recognised striker on 
his books, Sergio Cirio.

Adelaide have only one remaining foreign spot and might be forced to use it on 
a replacement for Djite, with the few Australian forwards available on the open 
market unlikely to be lured to the club.

A-League rivals Western Sydney, Sydney FC and Newcastle are all looking to 
sign strikers, while Brisbane also need back-up for star man Jamie Maclaren.

Adelaide are back in official action on August 3, when they face Redlands 
United at Brisbane’s Perry Park in the FFA Cup round of 32.
