On this latest Arcade Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> tour 
I got to spend a couple of days in São Paulo. It was my first quality time 
spent in the city, and I loved it. Musician friends of friends showed us 
around. There’s a bonkers energy and, like most cities I love, a mind-bending 
blend of cultures. It was exhausting, mostly in a good way. I can’t wait to go 
back.

The first time I went to São Paulo I was jet-lagged and relatively 
inexperienced with traveling. It was on the Funeral tour. I think we spent a 
day and a half in town, most of it inside the hotel which was behind a high 
fence with razor wire and armed guards outside. It was a weird, intense scene, 
that hotel.

I bet that hotel will figure out a way to get water no matter how low the 
supply gets.
