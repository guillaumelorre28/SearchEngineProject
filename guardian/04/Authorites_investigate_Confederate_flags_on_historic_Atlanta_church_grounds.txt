Four Confederate battle flags were found on the grounds of the Ebenezer 
Baptist church near the Martin Luther King Jr Center inAtlanta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta> on Thursday, and police and 
federal authorities were investigating.

Officer Gary Wade said a maintenance worker discovered the flags at 6am 
Thursday and notified the National Park Service, which operates the King Center.

Groundskeepers were disturbed to see the flags in the morning, the Rev Shannon 
Jones of Ebenezer Baptist said.

“Our groundsmen were so upset, they took pictures and then they moved them,” 
Jones said. But Park Service police later told workers the flags should be 
treated as evidence and not handled, he said.

No one saw who placed the flags, which weren’t stuck in the ground but instead 
set neatly on top of it, Wade said. There is at least one security camera for 
the area, Wade said, and authorities were reviewing footage.

A security guard saw a suspicious vehicle across the street from the church 
Wednesday night but it wasn’t clear whether that was related, Wade said.

A conference on the role on black churches in social justice issues has been 
going on in Ebenezer’s facilities, Jones said.

King once preached at the historic Ebenezer Baptist church, which is near the 
new church where the congregation now meets and where the flags were placed.

The King Center complex is near the eastern edge of downtown Atlanta. It is 
centered on Auburn Avenue, once a bustling center of commerce for Atlanta’s 
African American businesses and residents.

The center and church are a short walk from the home of Martin Luther King 
Jr’s maternal grandparents, where the late civil rights leader lived for the 
first 12 years of his life.
