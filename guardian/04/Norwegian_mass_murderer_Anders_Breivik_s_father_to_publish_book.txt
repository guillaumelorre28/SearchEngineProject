The father of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/03/norway-massacre-witnesses-shooting-spree>
 will publish a book entitled, My Fault? A Father's Story, on his role in the 
life of the killer, his publisher has announced.

In an excerpt released on Wednesday, Jens Breivik writes: "I feel some guilt 
and I feel some responsibility. What would have happened if I had been a better 
father? Would Anders have done what he did?"

His son is serving a 21-year sentence, which can be extended, for the murders 
of 77 people in Oslo and the island of Utøya in July 2011 – most of them 
adolescents at a summer camp.

Jens Breivik – a former diplomat who moved to France when he retired – has 
often been described as an absent father. He was separated from his son's 
mother shortly after the boy turned one and lost contact with him when he was a 
teenager.

During the murder investigation and trial it emerged that Norwegian social 
services had suspected Breivik was neglected at home as a child. At the time 
his father had attempted to win custody over him but failed.

Written with the help of a ghostwriter, the book – to be released in October – 
is a form of "self-trial", according to editor Arve Juritzen, who said that 
Jens Breivik re-established contact with his son this year. "In fact, he is 
pretty hard with himself," Juritzen said.

Another book about Breivik

's late mother, Wenche Behring Breivik – which she first collaborated on but 
later rejected – portrayed Jens Breivik as a domestic tyrant.
