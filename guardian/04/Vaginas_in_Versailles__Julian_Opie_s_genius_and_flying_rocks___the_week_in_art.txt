Exhibition of the Week

Fighting History
The genre of “history painting”, telling grand stories of great events, was 
Britain’s most honoured art form in the late 18th century. What relevance does 
it have today? This exhibition aims to answer that, comparing scenes from the 
Napoleonic Wars with such contemporary histories as Jeremy Deller’s Battle of 
Orgreave.

JMW Turner – The Fighting Temeraire (1839)
A ship of the line glows eerily in the London sunset as it is towed to its 
last dock by the Thames. History blazes and memories burn. War is over but it 
still reddens the sky.
