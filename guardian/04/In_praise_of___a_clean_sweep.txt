Australia thoroughly deserved to win back cricket's Ashes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/05/england-ashes-defeat-australia-johnson-harris>
. They were superior to hapless overrated England in every aspect of every game.

Their 5-0 victory was wholly merited. Yet if words mean anything, the 
Australians are unlucky to have their achievement laudedas a whitewash

.

An act of whitewash is a shameful act not a praiseworthy one. Let's try to 
keep it that way. A whitewash is a deliberate attempt to conceal unpleasant or 
incriminating facts in order to protect the reputation of a person or an 
organisation.

Many are preparing to use whitewash in this sense if Sir John Chilcot's report 
on the Iraq war 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/6634791/Iraq-war-inquiry-will-not-be-a-whitewash-says-Sir-John-Chilcot.html>
 fails to reach the conclusions they wish for, just as they didwhen Lord Hutton 
reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/29/huttoninquiry.davidkelly2>.

The archives suggest that cricket's inappropriate use of whitewash crept in 
unchallenged in the 1980s. It is probably too well-established to stop it now. 
But the fact is that Australia ought not to be congratulated on a whitewash â€“ 
but on a clean sweep.
