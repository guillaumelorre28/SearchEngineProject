Bill Bailey <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/bill-bailey> is a comedian, 
musician and actor best known for his offbeat standup shows and TV appearances 
onNever Mind the Buzzcocks and Black Books. He was born and grew up in the West 
Country, starting out as a performer in a Welsh experimental theatre troupe and 
as the musical accompanist to a mind-reading dog. He began performing as a solo 
standup in the mid-90s, and his first show, Cosmic Jam, led to a Perrier 
nomination in 1996. Twenty years later, he continues to meld comedy and music, 
returning next month with a new nationwide tour, Limboland, a personal 
meditation on “things not quite working out the way you want them to”.

These were extraordinary, lifesize sculptures that were just remarkable and 
immediate and quite unnerving actually. There was one moment where I was 
looking down this white-walled gallery, and there were a lot of people, a lot 
of tourists, all looking at the sculptures and it became difficult to discern 
who was the tourist and who was the sculpture. They were so lifelike. I hate 
all those celebrity sculptures like Tussauds, where everyone is dressed in 
spangly suits and they are all smiling. This was the brilliant antidote to 
that. These are just ordinary people caught in a moment of reverie.

Amy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za3lZcrzzcM>


It made me feel very angry, more than anything. I came out of the cinema in a 
terrible, black mood, thinking: “How could she have been neglected so badly by 
everyone?” Such a talent was just gone. I met Amy Winehouse a few times and she 
was always funny, charming and self-deprecating – just a delight to be around. 
There’s a scene in the film where she’s singingLove Is a Losing Game 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7R4Ir1fKc> at the Mercury awards and I 
remember very clearly seeing that and it still gets the hairs on the back of 
your neck going. In its typical, perverse way, the award went to Klaxons that 
year.

 Dragon rolls at Hasu Sushi. 
3 | Restaurant
Hasu Sushi, Acton, west London <http://hasusushi.co/>


My family are all big fans of Japanese food and this is quite new and local to 
us, in an unassuming part of Acton. A lot of the time Japanese food is very 
fresh, it looks beautifully presented, but they’ve gone the extra mile here 
with things we’d not seen before: snow crab and these wonderful dragon rolls, 
which are sushi rolls with extra spice. I think the chef and his wife are from 
Burma, so it’s a different take on things. Japanese food goes very well with 
another element added to it, with a different interpretation, and this is what 
Hasu Sushi does. The food is just knockout.

 Let the Right One In, New York.

Let the Right One In 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/08/let-right-one-in-review-apollo-theatre>


This was put on by a Scottish company, but I actually saw it in New York. It’s 
the only version of it I’ve seen - not the book, not the movie - but I thought 
it was beautifully staged; you immediately get a sense of dread, of something 
lurking, some other force there, which is brilliantly done. There is a very 
physical cast: there’s moments in it where the ensemble actually melt into a 
dance routine, which sounds like it wouldn’t work but it enhances the surreal 
and quite magical feel of the whole production. Some moments were genuinely 
very funny and there’s a couple of jump-out-of-your-seat shocks. It’s a great 
tale.

H Is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel>


I loved the description of the countryside, but this book is also a personal 
account of trying to tame a goshawk, which she decides to do after the death of 
her father. There’s a beautiful section where she describes grief and 
bereavement, and having gone through that myself, when my mother died 10 years 
ago, it very much chimed with me. I’ve just walkedthe Ridgeway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/28/racing-to-the-stones-running-ridgeway>
 – Britain’s oldest road – raising money for cancer research because she died 
of cancer, so I completely understand this idea of doing something as a 
response to a loss; even though hers is very immediate and raw, and mine was 10 
years down the line and more considered.

I’d been driving up and down the A40, seeing these mounds at the side of the 
road, and I just had to know why people were going up them. So I went there 
with my son and there’s this fantastic view across London: you can see to 
Canary Wharf, right to the North Downs. It opened seven years ago for a 
relatively small amount of money – £5m won’t buy you much land in London – and 
it’s made from the rubble and detritus that was removed when Wembley stadium 
was demolished. I feel very strongly about public space and I’m so grateful to 
those who conceived this, because what a fantastic gift for people and what a 
brilliant use of Wembley.
