<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/the-mekong-river-stories-from-the-heart-of-the-climate-crisis-interactive>
 – an interactive focusing on how the 70 million people who live along 
South-East Asia’s Mekong river are struggling to deal with the impacts of 
climate change - was awarded the digital media award.

The short film award was given to El Salvador: ‘I had a miscarriage. The judge 
accused me of murder’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2015/dec/17/el-salvador-miscarriage-judge-accused-me-murder-anti-abortion-law-video>
. The film was unanimously voted the winner by the judges, who described it as 
“a confident film with a cinematic flavour, which manages to cover so much in 
such a short time. We’re drawn in by its powerful emotional stories and left 
with a growing sense of outrage”.

Sune Engel Rasmussen <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen>
, a Kabul-based contributor to the Guardian, picked up the new voice award for 
his “hardy and determined” reporting from Afghanistan.

The press award was won by world affairs editor Julian Borger for his piece 
Syria’s truth smugglers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/syria-truth-smugglers-bashar-al-assad-war-crimes>
, published in May 2015. The story highlighted the risks taken by a team of 
Syrian investigators to collect secret government documents that provide 
evidence of war crimes by Bashar al-Assad and his regime and asked whether an 
international court would ever hear their cases.
