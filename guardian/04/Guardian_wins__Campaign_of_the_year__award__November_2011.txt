Political Studies Association (PSA) for our coverage of the phone-hacking 
scandal.

The panel of judges stated: "Over the past decade the journalists and 
editorial team have displayed a dogged determination to uncover the truth about 
the phone hacking scandal. Their tireless work has begun to pay off with 
sustained public, political and police scrutiny of this issue."
