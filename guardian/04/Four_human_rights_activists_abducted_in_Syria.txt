Press freedom <https://www.theguardian.com/media/press-freedom> and human 
rights organisations have called for the immediate release of four Syrian human 
rights defenders who were abducted on Monday (9 December).

Award-winning writer and lawyer Razan Zaitouneh 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh> was taken along with her 
husband, Wa'el Hamada, and two colleagues, Nazem Hamadi and Samira Khalil, from 
an office in a Damascus suburb.

It is used by the Violations Documentation Centre (VDC) and the Local 
Development and Small Projects Support (LDSPS). The former is an independent 
non-governmental organisation responsible for documenting human rights abuses 
committed by the Syrian government. The latter provides humanitarian assistance.

Zaitouneh was a founding member of both organisations. She recently received 
the 2013 international women of courage award. She has also won theAnna 
Politkovskaya <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya> prize and, 
in 2011, the European parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought.

The office is located in an area under the control of a number of armed 
opposition groups, which is under siege from forces loyal to the president,
Bashar al-Assad <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad>.

It is known that Zaitouneh has recently received threats from at least one 
armed opposition group.

Among the 16 signatories to the appeal for the release of the four activists 
areAmnesty International 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international>, Reporters Without 
Borders, PEN International and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting.
