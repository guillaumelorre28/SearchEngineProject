Rémi Garde has admitted Aston Villa are considering the idea of bringing 
Ashley Cole toAston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa>.

Cole is currently out of favour at Roma and has not played for the Italian 
club, whom hejoined in July 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/07/roma-ashley-cole-proposed-move>
 after a glittering time at Chelsea, since last season.

The 35-year-old’s contract expires at the end of the current Serie A campaign 
and Garde is looking to exploit that by bringing him to the Premier League’s 
bottom side during the January transfer window. Villa are also in need of a 
left-back as a result of the season-ending cruciate knee ligament injury
suffered by Jordan Amavi last month

.

“Every good player is interesting for me and Ashley is a good player,” said 
Garde, the Villa manager. “He is someone who has experience but he didn’t play 
for a while now. Experience is also something we need. I will speak soon with 
the club and I’m already working on the January window. We know what we want to 
do.”

Villa host another of Cole’s former clubs, Arsenal, on Sunday.
