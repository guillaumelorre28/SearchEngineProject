No other reporter has been assigned Anna Politkovskaya’s desk in Novaya 
Gazeta’s newsroom. It remains as a memorial, alongside her photograph and those 
of other murdered journalists at the newspaper, and as a reminder of the danger 
of the work.

Ten years after Politkovskaya was shot in the lobby of her apartment block in 
Moscow, Novaya Gazeta continues to be one of the few outlets for hard-hitting 
independent journalism inRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>. Its 
reporters still work from the North Caucasus, one the most dangerous part of 
the region.

In September, Elena Kostyuchenko, a reporter with Novaya, travelled to Beslan 
in North Ossetia to cover the 12th anniversary of the siege in which 334 people 
died, including 186 children.

Politkovskaya had attempted to make the same journey back in 2004, but fainted 
on the plane on her way there. Doctors believe she was poisoned to prevent her 
from reporting.

Nevertheless, Novaya worked tirelessly to investigate what happened at Beslan, 
and published a number of reports suggesting explosives planted by Russian 
special forces to try to end the siege had been responsible for many of the 
deaths.

This September, a number of mothers of victims, who have long campaigned for 
an independent investigation into the events of the siege,planned a protest to 
mark the anniversary

and wore T-shirts bearing the words: “Putin is the butcher of Beslan”.

Kostyuchenko and a photographer who went to cover the event were followed, 
intimidated, doused in green paint and beaten up during their time in the town. 
Kostyuchenko spent a week in hospital with concussion after being hit in the 
head.

Despite being just 29, Kostyuchenko has already worked for Novaya for 11 
years. Her stories include one of the most detailed accounts of the mechanisms 
by which Russians fought in thecontested regions of east Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/east-ukraine-frontline-europe-forgotten-war>
.

She started writing for the local newspaper in her home town of Yaroslavl as a 
teenager as a way to make ends meet. “I thought what I was doing was 
journalism. Then one day when I was about 15 I bought Novaya Gazeta from a 
kiosk while I was waiting for the dentist, and started to read one of 
Politkovskaya’s stories about Chechnya. I was in shock and my world was turned 
upside down. I understood I didn’t know anything about our country. I decided 
that if I wanted to be a journalist I would have to work for Novaya Gazeta.”

In the decade since Politkovskaya’s death, the space for independent 
journalism has ​only ​narrowed further

She went to Moscow to study and applied to work at the paper; she has been 
there ever since. In her first months at the newspaper, Kostyuchenko was too 
scared to approach Politkovskaya, because she felt too young and inexperienced. 
“I was scared of looking silly. I thought that I would first become a good 
journalist, do some work I could be proud of, and then tell her how her writing 
changed my life.” She never got the chance.


In the decade since Politkovskaya’s death, the space for independent 
journalism in Russia has narrowed further.

Since 2006, the Committee to Protect Journalists has recorded 20 journalists’ 
killings <https://cpj.org/killed/2016/>, while Freedom House has counted 63 
violent attacks <https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/russia> on 
reporters. But for the most part, the threat of closure keeps publications in 
line and encourages self-censorship.

A number of news sources have been built up into formidable publications, only 
to be cut back down to size.

The editorial heads of Lenta.ru 
<https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/lentaru-editor-replaced-after-extremism-warning-32902>
 were replaced by its owner when the news website was seen as taking its 
Kremlin criticism too far; the independent television station TV Rainwas forced 
to broadcast from an apartment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/09/tv-rain-russia-only-independent-television-channel>
 after being kicked out of its studios; and most recently, there was a purge of 
thenewspaper RBC 
<https://meduza.io/en/feature/2016/07/12/this-is-what-losing-your-newsroom-looks-like-in-russia>
 after a string of reports on the wealth of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and 
an investigation into one of the president’s daughters.

Angry RBC journalists taped their conversation with the two new editors 
appointed to take over the newspaper. The new bosses compared the work of the 
paper to driving: “If you drive over the solid double line, they take away your 
licence... Unfortunately, nobody knows where the solid double line is.”

In a media landscape where most people steer clear of the solid double lines, 
another rare independent voice in the Russian media landscape is the New Times, 
a weekly political magazine with sharp design and even sharper analysis, edited 
since its founding nearly a decade ago by veteran journalist Yevgenia Albats.

Information today has become a very serious and effective weapon
Ernest Mackevi​​čius 
The magazine is permitted to survive because of its small circulation, but 
nevertheless has frequent problems. Recently, its publisher refused to release 
an issue with a cover illustration of sheep at the Kremlin’s gates. “We’d been 
using the publishers since 2008 and we didn’t owe them a cent, and then 
suddenly they just refused to publish us,” said Albats.

Many oligarchs are subscribers and the presidential administration orders 13 
to 15 copies, Albats said, yet it is almost impossible to find companies 
willing to advertise in the publication. It is kept afloat by five sponsors, 
all Russian citizens, most of whom wish to remain anonymous because of the risk 
to their reputations.

The war in Ukraine, which began in 2014, has left the media even more 
polarised. The popular state television anchor Ernest Mackevičius told hundreds 
of journalism students at a youth camp last summer that the definition of 
journalism had changed, insisting that western media lied about Russia, so 
Russia had to respond in kind. “You understand that for the past year and a 
half, we have worked as part of the government, because information today has 
become a very serious and effective weapon.”

In the decade since Politkovskaya’s death Kostyuchenko has had opportunities 
to move elsewhere, but says she values the rare journalistic freedom of Novaya 
Gazeta. In 2015 she catalogued the involvement of Russian soldiers in the war 
in east Ukraine, an involvement furiously denied by the Kremlin and a taboo 
subject for Russian journalists.

“I was offered $10,000 a month to work on television, and at Novaya Gazeta I 
earn the same as my sister earns selling jeans in Yaroslavl. But we [at the 
newspaper] have no censorship, and that’s important.”
