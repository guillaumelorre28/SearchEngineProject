Your report on the pay of Britain’s male bosses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uks-top-bosses-earned-10-pay-rise-2015-average-salary-hit-55m>
 (8 August) beggars belief. I’m pleased that the prime minister is taking 
action. Meanwhile, those named could answer criticism positively by offering 
large proportions of their wealth to hospitals, education, medical and 
scientific research, not to mention the boost they could give to projects in 
the arts. Their response will be awaited with interest.

• Our “little old ladies” art group must be old enough now to concentrate on 
our individuality (Back to school 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/08/back-to-art-school-grayson-perry-and-gillian-wearing-visit-degree-shows>
, G2, 8 August). Of course, at 75, myBauhaus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bauhaus> teaching, via Victor Pasmore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/nov/20/sculpture>, is 
terrible old hat. I agree, students aren’t taught much at art school these days 
but Grayson Perry’s doing OK – why doesn’t he set up an art academy actually 
teaching conceptual art? Otherwise all those next-generation oldies won’t know 
how to do it.

• Suzanne Moore’s piece about Leonard Cohen’s graceful letter to Marianne 
Ihlen (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/leonard-cohen-letter-to-marianne-ihlen-was-poetic-and-candid>
, 9 August) brought back memories of the time I saw him in concert in Cardiff 
in 2008. I have never seen a man reduce so many women to tears simultaneously 
as when he sang So Long, Marianne. Mr Cohen was truly born with the gift of a 
golden voice.

• Euromoney isn’t the only keeper of the Fleet Street news flame (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/fleet-street-isnt-all-in-the-mind-you-know>
, 9 August). The Law Society Gazette, with daily email and weekly print 
circulations well into six figures, operates within a stone’s throw. We do our 
best to keep the Fleet Street watering holes in business, too.

• Nice picture of “Manchester’s new tram” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/build-a-better-hs3-now-to-rebalance-economy-and-boost-north-says-ippr>
, 8 August). Manchester’s Metrolink has been up and running since 1992 but 
perhaps the news has only just penetrated the “new” M25.
