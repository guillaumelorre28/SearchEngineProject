Retired Russian police officer Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov has been charged in 
connection with the 2006 murder of the investigative reporterAnna Politkovskaya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya>.

The authorities also named a convicted criminal, Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, as an 
organiser of the killing.

The agency investigating Politkovskaya's murder said Gaitukayev's murder gang 
included his nephews - brothers Rustam, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov - along 
with Pavlyuchenkov and another former police officer, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov.

It announced that Lieutenant Colonel Pavlyuchenkov, then head of surveillance 
at Moscow's main internal affairs directorate, ordered his subordinates to 
follow the journalist to identify her schedule and commuting routes, and then 
shared the information with the other members of the gang.

The colonel later passed the murder weapon from Gaitukayev to the suspected 
gunman, Rustam Makhmudov.

Gaitukayev is currently serving a lengthy jail term on unrelated charges of 
attempted murder,according to the BBC Russian service.

 Rustam Makhmudov was arrested in May and charged in early June.

Politkovskaya, a special correspondent for the Moscow-based paper Novaya 
Gazeta, was well known for her investigative reports on human rights abuses in 
Chechnya, stories that led to multiple threats on her life.

During her career, she was threatened, jailed, forced into exile and poisoned. 
On 7 October 2006, a man in a baseball cap shot her dead in the elevator of her 
Moscow apartment block.
