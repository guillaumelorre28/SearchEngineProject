Whether it was leaked by another of my treacherous servants, I do not know. 
Heads will roll either way. But the press have reprinted the invitation to the 
social consciousness summit Sting and I are to hold in our 57-room Tuscan 
villa, where "we will rethink how change happens in our society". Bizarrely, 
they have sneered at my suggestion that flying a couple of dozen of our 
creative and humanitarian friends to Italy for a week of relaxation will effect 
worldwide social transformation.

But you know what? I ignore what small-minded people say. I have always 
refused to be around that kind of negative energy. I felt it once when Sting 
and I landed in the Ecuadorian rainforest to survey the damage done by oil 
drilling, and this old tribesman kept scowling at me. I just told Sting to 
helicopter us straight back out: if he didn't want our help, there were plenty 
of other villages that did. We returned to Quito and had unforgettable shrimp 
ceviche while they were refuelling the private jet.

And that's how I see the Tuscan summit - maybe not fuelled by shrimp ceviche, 
but by Barolo and carpaccio of this and that. As the invite says, "humanitarian 
activists will break bread with film directors".

As I typed those words I envisaged my Sting splitting truffle-oiled ciabatta 
with Guy Ritchie. I imagined the infinite possibilities of their conversation 
and became gripped by the certainty that it would lead to some kind of historic 
treaty. The Styler Accord, basically.
