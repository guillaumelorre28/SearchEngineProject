If you are among the lucky ones returning from a summer holiday this week, you 
might have brought back some souvenirs from markets where you bargained hard to 
get a good deal - or so you thought.

Even if you think you’ve got a brilliant price, the brain can easily be 
influenced to pay more – even by as little as a random number. In a study based 
on work by the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, a scientist went for a walk with a 
bottle of champagne in one hand and a bag full of ping-pong balls in the other. 
He told passers by that the balls had random numbers on, and asked them to pick 
one, which said 10 on it. When he asked the most they’d pay for the champagne, 
they said around £25. In fact, while the subjects believed the balls were 
random, they weren’t: every ball had 10 on. When the experiment was repeated 
with balls saying 65, the maximum amounts raised to around £45.

This is called anchoring, and occurs because the brain works with relative 
amounts rather than absolutes. It’s why the start of bargaining is so 
important, and why even keen bargain-hunters can be persuaded to pay above the 
odds.
