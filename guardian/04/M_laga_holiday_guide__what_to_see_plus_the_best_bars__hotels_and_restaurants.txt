For most visitors, Málaga is simply a gateway to the beach resorts of the 
Costa del Sol, with few venturing far from the airport or into the city. Well, 
they’re all missing a trick because this once-shabby port has undergone 
something of a reinvention. There’s a sparkling new waterfront and millions of 
euros have been pumped into the art scene, thanks to mayor Francisco de la 
Torre’s vision to turn his city into a cultural hub, with a branch of the 
Parisian Pompidou Centre among the latest museum openings.

The Alcazaba fortress, Málaga’s more modest answer to Granada’s Alhambra, sits 
proudly in the historic centre – a maze of gardens and fountains – and above it 
10th-centuryGibralfaro castle 
<http://www.andalucia.com/cities/malaga/gibralfaro.htm> stands guard over the 
coast. Round the corner lies the vast Renaissance cathedral, nicknamed La 
Manquita (“one-armed woman”) because its south tower was mysteriously left 
unbuilt.

While the city beaches are nothing to write home about, the food definitely 
is. The subtropical climate and maritime location mean there’s plentiful fresh 
produce, exceptional local wine, melt-in-the-mouth jamón and top seafood – the 
locals are nicknamedboquerones (anchovies) because of the quantities they eat. 
There are countless great bars and restaurants, and more opening all the time, 
but eat late if you don’t want to look like a tourist – Malagueños go out late, 
and dining after 10pm is the norm.

With dozens of low-cost flights a week, Málaga ticks all the boxes for an 
alternative city break or a stopover on the way to a beach holiday. It’s just 
surprising more people haven’t cottoned on yet.

Museums
You can’t turn a corner without finding a museum in Málaga: there are over 30 
here. The newly openedPompidou Centre is that museum’s first foray out of 
France. It’s entered via a striking, giant glass cube and houses permanent and 
temporary contemporary exhibitions (€7, under-18s free,centrepompidou-malaga.eu 
<http://centrepompidou-malaga.eu/>).

The brand new Collection of the Russian Museum in an old tobacco factory is 
also impressive – five rooms tell the tale of Russian art over five centuries, 
with works from the state museum in St Petersburg (€6, under-18s free,
coleccionmuseoruso.es <http://www.coleccionmuseoruso.es/>).

<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/26/huelva-andalucia-holiday-guide-spain-cadiz>
Next door is the Automobile Museum, which is surprisingly fascinating even for 
non-petrol-heads as, alongside the vintage and modern cars, high fashion from 
the 1920s-50s is on display (€7.50, under-threes free,museoautomovilmalaga.com 
<http://www.museoautomovilmalaga.com/?lang=en>).

Of course, the city is proud of its links with Picasso, who was born here. 
Besides his childhood home, thePicasso Museum (€7, museopicassomalaga.org 
<http://www.museopicassomalaga.org/>, under-18s free) in a restored palace is a 
must-visit with over 200 sculptures, drawings and ceramics by the artist. A 
temporary exhibition of Louise Bourgeois (noted for her giant spider 
sculptures) runs until 27 September, too. If that’s not enough, theCarmen 
Thyssen (€6, carmenthyssenmalaga.org <http://www.carmenthyssenmalaga.org/es>) 
showcases 19th-century Spanish art and, for cutting-edge curating, head to the 
brilliantContemporary Art Centre (free, cacmalaga.eu <http://cacmalaga.eu/>) in 
the Soho district – shows by Brit urban artistD*Face <http://www.dface.co.uk/> 
and Korean street artist Shepard Fairey run until 27 September.

Shopping
 Marqués de Larios street. Photograph: Alamy 
Besides the grand, marble-paved main shopping street Marqués de Larios, where 
shoppers can find high-street and designer names at bargain prices, thanks to 
the weak euro, Málaga is a treat for those who like discovering little 
independent boutiques. Calle Andrés Pérez, in what was a run-down part of town, 
is also a good place to browse. The shops and restaurants clubbed together to 
clean up the street and pay for street lights. Top finds include organic 
clothing atColorHueso (no 7), antiques at Patio Almanzora (no 5) and vintage 
goods at Quasipercaso (no 1). For beautiful handmade jewellery, try P&C in the 
old centre (Calle Santa María 13).

 D*Face exhibit. Photograph: D*Face Studio 
The newly hip Soho district is being turned into an open-air gallery by the 
Maus <http://www.mausmalaga.com/> (Málaga Arte Urbano Soho) project which has 
invited big-name international artists to create artwork on the city’s walls. 
There are giant animal murals by the Belgian Roa, pop-art style creations by 
D*Face and smaller works by local artists. More work to be added by Kenny 
Scharf, Aryz and Abraham Lacalle soon. Pick up a map and explore by yourself or 
join a guided tour by CAC (three free tours at 10, 11 and 12 on Mondays). For 
another alternative arty experience head to Plaza De Jesus de La Pasion, where 
artist Valerio “fishes for people” by dangling a rose and a note inviting 
guests to his studio to have their eye sketched for free for his “Eyecylopedia” 
or just to browse his work. Valerio is the man behind an alternative “art 
currency” circulating in the city – “the Valerio”, notes made from his printed 
etchings are being accepted by a range of “wholesome” businesses, from yoga 
studios to cafes (valeriogentile.net).

 Spain Food Sherpas tour. 
Málaga’s coming into its own as a culinary destination and a tour (group or 
bespoke) with the recently launched Spain Food Sherpas takes foodies off the 
beaten track to discover everything from traditional crisp makers to the best
churros (doughnuts) and hidden restaurants. From the buzzing Mercado Atarazanas 
<http://www.malaga.eu/> (the main food market), to the specialist ultramarinos 
(traditional, family grocery stores), visitors learn about – and try – the best 
local fare.

Ten minutes east of the city centre, the old fishing village of Pedregalejo is 
the place to eat fresh fish and seafood at one of many beachside bars. Cooked 
on embers in boats on the sand, the must-try isespeto de sardinas (just-caught 
grilled sardines on a stick, €4.50). El Cabra on the promenade is a favourite 
for families for juicy mussels, clams in garlic and mixed fried fish – and 
great for people-watching. Afterwards, take a peek at the boat building 
workshop near the entrance to the beach.

Bodega Bar El Pimpi
El Pimpi is a Málaga institution. With a big terrace right opposite the 
Alcazaba, it is a tourist hotspot, but remains authentic and popular with 
locals, too. Inside it’s all old tiles, wood beams and barrels signed by 
visitors including celebrities such as local boy Antonio Banderas and Paloma 
Picasso. The food lives up to the hype – plates of the best Iberian ham, simple 
but delicious tomato salad and marinated fish (mains €10). Finish with a glass 
of typical Málaga moscatel wine. The new section next door is all glass and 
white walls, attracting a younger crowd.
• Calle Granada 62, +34 952 22 54 03

Gorki
There are tapas bars galore but one that won’t disappoint is Gorki, which uses 
local ingredients with a twist (small tapas €3.50, larger plates are served, 
too). Seating is in stalls in the shabby-chic interior and dishes include tangy 
cheeses, smoked cod with crushed tomatoes and baked salmon with gherkins on
mollete (soft white bread). It’s all fresh and delicious, and there’s an 
extensive wine list.

Tucked away on a side street, two 18th-century mansions have been converted 
into this restaurant with tapas and wine bar, with original features such as a 
stained-glass ceiling making the setting rather special. There are over 200 
wines – a four-course tasting menu pairing each course with a different vintage 
costs €50 (€35 without wine). Head chef Christopher Gould (a UK Masterchef 
quarter-finalist) puts his own stamp on traditional Spanish fare with the likes 
of mushroom-and-truffle croquettes and suckling Málaga goat with couscous.

burger and dim sum, influenced by their travels around the world (from €5). All

 Piscina Lounge Terraza, Hotel Molina Lario. 
Roof-top terraces
Nothing beats a breezy roof terrace and a gin and tonic after a day of 
culture, and there are plenty of places to imbibe high above the heat of the 
city. Some of the best are on the top of hotels, but open to non-guests. Try 
the two-storey La Terraza at Alcazaba Premium Hostel or the poolside terrace at 
Molina Lario (see where to stay, below, for details).

El Rincón del Cervecero
The craft beer movement has found its way to Málaga, and El Rincón, which 
opened a year ago, is the place to try Spanish brews. There are 185 beers there 
and owners David and Juan Francisco even make their own ales for Semana Santa 
and the August Feria. It’s a bright, simple space with wooden tables and high 
stalls and offers tastings and beer-making workshops.

Opened last summer, this small bar (couple of tables inside, mostly standing) 
is a hit with younger locals, who spill out on to the streets until the early 
hours. Owner Sergio has 15 artisanal beers on the menu every week and serves 
very generous G&Ts and delicious Aperol Spritz.

La Esquinita del Chupa y Tira
A favourite with local bloggers Pedro and Abby (elboqueronviajero.com 
<http://elboqueronviajero.com/>), La Esquinita is a real find. Owner José 
Manuel bought the specialist grocery store he had frequented since childhood 
and turned the store room into a tiny bar. Local wine accompanies plate after 
plate of cheeses and meats brought out from the shop in the front – resulting 
in a tiny bill.

Odisea wine bar
It’s on a bit of a main road but that doesn’t put wine lovers off sitting on 
the front terrace of this long-established, family-run institution. Inside it’s 
all dark wood and barrel-lined walls (with a cute, tiny patio). There are 200 
wines from Málaga province. Don’t leave without trying the homemade vermouth, 
as the secret recipe uses 47 herbs and spices and has been passed down for six 
generations. There’s a great selection of tapas, too.

In a great spot opposite the cathedral and a few minutes’ walk from the 
waterfront, this 103-room, four-star hotel boasts a rooftop pool and two 
terraces with amazing views – perfect for a cocktail or two at any time of day. 
The decor is a bit safe but standard rooms are very comfortable, if a little 
business-like, while the deluxe rooms are in the 19th-century part of the 
hotel. There’s also a decent restaurant and cafe (the patio garden’s nice for 
breakfast).

Alcazaba Premium Hostel 
Opened in February, this is a cool, central budget option. There are 24 rooms 
ranging from dorms of 10 to doubles – all spotless and comfortable with private 
bathrooms (a superior double has three balconies). Best of all is the stylish 
restaurant Batik (open to anyone) and the buzzing roof terrace, the latest 
place to have a drink and enjoy the views over the Alcazaba and the castle.

Room Mate Larios
On main shopping street Marqués de Larios, this is a good, central option with 
art deco-inspired decor (grey palette, blonde wood furnishings and round 
mirrors). The junior suite has lovely views of Plaza de la Constitución and 
floor-to-ceiling shuttered windows. The stylish roof terrace has a cocktail bar 
and breakfast is a quality buffet, open until midday (€8.95). As well as rooms 
there are several apartments, including a two-bed duplex, and sister hotel Room 
Mate Lola has opened in Soho.

Right next to the hammam, this bijou hotel, which opened last year, has just 
eight rooms (one with two double beds), five with their own bathroom. Fresh 
cakes and muffins, delicious smoothies and other delights are sold in the 
bright cafe. It’s all as sweet as its name suggests and it doubles as a 
gallery, showing local artists’ work which changes monthly.

Patio 19 Hostel
This slightly eccentric Aladdin’s cave of a B&B in a 17th-century mansion is 
great value and near the old centre. Set around a tiled courtyard, it’s full of 
antiques, old flamenco dresses, gilded mirrors and knick-knacks, but the rooms 
(doubles and one eight-bed dorm) are spotless.
