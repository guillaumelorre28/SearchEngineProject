 (or Alesha)? Did the BBC's top dogs suddenly decide for themselves to recall

from their kitchen sinks and regional TV newsrooms – or were the hounds of 
political correctness baying too loud? At which point, cross the Atlantic and

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/sep/03/diane-sawyer-abc-news-anchor>
. Diane is 64. Her arrival has pushed up ratings by nearly 9%, so that her show 
is breathing down the neck of Brian Williams, the current network leader. She's 
just good. Indeed, after 11 years of breakfast television experience, she's 
great. And age has nothing – nothing at all – to do with it.
