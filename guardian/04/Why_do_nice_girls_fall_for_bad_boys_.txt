Irresistible rascals

From a nice girl, aged 37
Dear Carole, Why do girls – even nice girls – fall for bad boys, even when the 
girls in question are 37 and should know much better? My friends and I don't 
understand ourselves.

Carole replies:
The "dark triad" of human behaviour consists of narcissism (or 
self-obsession), psychopathy (including callous, impulsive, thrill-seeking, 
risk-taking behaviour) and Machiavellianism (exploitative, manipulative and 
deceitful behaviour). Bad boys exhibit dark triad traits and their behaviour,
according to one theory, 
<http://www.bradley.edu/academics/las/psy/facstaff/schmitt/documents/Jonason-Schmitt-2009-DarkTriad-STM.pdf>
 is genetic, meaning they are unlikely to change their ways.

These types of males tend to favour short-term relationships (including one 
night stands) over long-term relationships. They also attempt to compete with 
other males by poaching mates for brief affairs.

Research has shown that a touch of evil can bring fitness benefits: these 
males tend to have more female partners and thusmore reproductive opportunities 
<http://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/HunterRS.pdf> than other males. The 
fictional character of James Bond is frequently cited as possessing dark triad 
traits.

Although the dark triad personality type appears to be universal in human 
society, having been identified in 57 countries, it does exact real costs – 
otherwise bad boys would be more common. Those exhibiting dark triad behaviour 
need to prey on the cooperative and unsuspecting.

If bad boys stay in one place and among the same group of humans for too long 
their psychopathy will be exposed. It has been predicted that this evolutionary 
strategy can only succeed if bad boys manage to achieve anonymity or lead an 
itinerant lifestyle.

Evolutionary-anthropological research on hunter gatherers, such as the !Kung 
San of the Kalahari, has shown that successful, risk-taking hunters – who 
"bring home the bacon" for the group –get the most mating opportunities 
<http://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/HunterRS.pdf>. 

As a single trait, successful risk-taking is universally appreciated as a sign 
of good genes. The combination of brave, risk-taking behaviour is frequently 
attractive to females in the short-term. But in the long term, although females 
remain attracted to bravery and risk-taking they also look for the crucial 
additional trait of altruism.

Thus, if given a choice, a female will apparently favour a brave altruist over 
an opportunistic risk-taker

Ironically, "nice girls" may be the only females who tolerate the dark triad 
male personality, forgiving these naughty boys and inadvertently giving them 
yet another chance to misbehave.

Are you prepared to be a single mother? A bad boy son who survives all the 
risk-taking behaviour to reach reproductive age may make you a granny many 
times over, but are you really looking for quantity over quality?

You need to ask yourself this: "Do I want to be another notch on this man's 
bedpost, or would it be wiser to hold out for a brave altruist?"
