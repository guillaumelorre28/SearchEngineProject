It's official. Oliver Stone has persuaded me to sign up for Wall Street 2. 
And, frankly, who better to offer a searing critique of the financial madness 
that has characterised the past few years? I guess you could get someone who 
doesn't live in a tax haven, and who didn't sue one magazine for printing 
wedding pictures that my wife and I had sold to another magazine.

But as Oliver said to me, "You won best actor for Wall Street, and you were 
only 43. Imagine how much better at it you'll be 21 years on. Plus, it will be 
nice for Catherine to see Gordon Gekko on the big screen." I said: "What do you 
mean?" And he said, "Just that Wall Street was a 15 - I figured she maybe 
didn't get to ... was too young to ... "

I put him out of his misery. He'd had me at hello. I mean, it's great being 
asked to voice raccoons and stuff - I love to make movies that my kids can see. 
At least, that's what I tell reporters, in interview performances the critics 
would no doubt hail as my least convincing since I had to dance in that club in 
Basic Instinct.

Unfortunately, we can't include Charlie Sheen this time round. These days my 
face is tauter than his, even though my eyes don't actually shut any more and I 
just have to roll them back in my head when I sleep. We're chasing Shia LaBoeuf 
- if his Indiana Jones outing is anything to go by, he'll bring just the kind 
of whiny, franchise-wrecking charm this thing needs.
