Astana <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/astana>, the team of the 2014 Tour 
de France winner, Vincenzo Nibali, will keep their WorldTour licence for 2015 
after the UCI president, Brian Cookson, failed in his attempt to have it 
revoked following a series of doping offences.

In February the UCI asked the Independent Licence Commission to revoke the 
licence following an independent audit into the team’s procedures, which came 
after a number of anti-doping infringements by Astana and their feeder team.

But instead the Licence Commission asked the Institute of Sport Sciences at 
the University of Lausanne (ISSUL) to devise a series of measures to be placed 
on the team, under which they can retain their licence.

In a statement on Thursday night, the UCI said: “On the initiative of the 
Licence Commission, ISSUL were asked to propose special measures which the Team 
will be obliged to put in place at specific times over the rest of this season.

“The team committed to respecting all the measures recommended by ISSUL. At 
the end of the hearing, the Licence Commission announced the suspension of the 
proceedings.”

The decision leaves Astana free to compete for the rest of the season, 
although the team remains the subject of further scrutiny.

“...The registration for the 2015 season remains in force,” the statement 
added. “However, the Team’s licence is subject to strict monitoring of the 
conditions laid down.

“This monitoring will be carried out on the basis of reports transmitted by 
ISSUL to the Licence Commission.

“The Licence Commission shall be able to re-open the proceedings if Astana Pro 
Team fails to respect one or several of the conditions imposed, or if new 
elements arise.”

When Astana were awarded their 2015 licence in December, conditions were 
attached after five riders linked to the team failed doping tests in 2014, 
including brothers Maxim and Valentin Iglinskiy, trainee Ilya Davidenok and two 
members of Astana’s continental development team - Artur Fedosseyev and Victor 
Okishev.

There was no suggestion of wrong-doing on the part of Nibali.

Astana were made to submit to an audit from ISSUL as a condition of their 
licence.

At the conclusion of that audit, the UCI asked for Astana’s licence to be 
revoked, saying the reality of the team’s policies and structures differed 
markedly from what Astana told the licence commission during a review last 
December.

The Kazakh team had previously said they would appeal to the Court of 
Arbitration for Sport if the licence was revoked.

Astana issued a statement on Thursday night which read: “Astana Pro Team is 
grateful to the Licence Commission for the opportunity to present the team’s 
commitment to observing the UCI’s ethical criteria.

“Astana Pro Team is committed to respecting all measures recommended by ISSUL, 
and to collaborate in the implementation of further measures that enhance our 
procedures above and beyond the UCI’s minimum requirements.

“Our focus now returns to racing.”
