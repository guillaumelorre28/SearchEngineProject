 * Alex Neil, Scotland’s social justice secretary, has told the conference the 
Scottish government will use new powers over welfare “to the maximum” when they 
are devolved to Holyrood. As the Press Association reports, with powers over 
some benefits to be devolved as part of the Scotland bill, Neil said work on 
how these could be used is already under way. The SNP will publish a bill 
setting out its plans for social security in the new year, he said. This will 
include scrapping the “84-day rule” under which children who are in hospital 
for 84 days or more lose their disability benefits. Neil said: “Within the 
first day of the new powers we will abolish that rule.” He also vowed there 
would be a “fairer deal” for carers, stating: “The money they get is the 
equivalent to what a Tory Cabinet minister would spend on a good lunch in Soho.”

 * SNP members have narrowly rejected a bid to toughen up the party’s stance 
on fracking amid calls for an outright ban. (See 11.39am.)

Iain Black from the party’s Forth branch, one of the founding members of SMAUG 
(SNP Members Against Unconventional Gas), told delegates: 
We believe that the evidence and the science absolutely and overwhelmingly 
supports a ban. There’s science, and then there’s science that’s paid for by 
big business with research grants. The SNP is about healthy communities, you 
can’t have healthy communities if you destroy the land, if you destroy the air, 
if you destroy the water that we drink. It’s Scotland’s land, it’s Scotland’s 
air, it’s Scotland’s water.

But, in an article in the Scottish Sun, Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive of 
chemicals company Ineos, said fracking offeredScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> a “last chance” to gain economic 
independence. He said:

Shale gas is Scotland’s best and last chance to gain economic independence. We 
respect the Scottish Government is deep in thought over fracking. It’s an 
important decision for the country to take. But take too long and the 
opportunity will pass by.

England is now moving forward with shale and it would be a tragedy for 
Scotland if they end up taking the lead in this exciting industry, securing the 
jobs and investments. It could mean that the north-west of England becomes the 
next Aberdeen, rather than our central belt.

 * SNP delegates have rejected the party’s land reform bill as too timid.

 * Sturgeon has defended the SNP’s record on health and education. (See 
10.04pm.)

 * John Swinney, Scotland’s finance minister, has confirmed that councils in 
Scotland will get the power to cut business rates from the end of this month. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34546277> 
 * The SNP MP Mairi Black has accused the Conservatives of producing “some the 
most rightwing and cruellest policies imaginable”.In a speech she said: 
The parliament I sit in is a top down, out of date and out of touch one. I am 
witnessing some the most rightwing and cruellest policies imaginable being 
passed in front of my very eyes.

I often find myself looking across that chamber at the Tory MPs and I think 
‘are you so genuinely out of touch that you can’t see the damage you are 
doing’. Either way I am tired of being lectured by Tories as to why austerity 
is essential, why these welfare reforms - in fact they’re not reforms, they’re 
cuts - are essential. I’m tired of being told pensioners cost too much, I’m 
tired of our young people being told they’re not good enough, I’m tired of 
immigrants being scapegoated for the mistakes of bankers and politicians. I’m 
tired of being told that pain and misery are necessary for a stronger economy, 
for a long term economic plan.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Tenthred in the comments has an interesting theory about what inspired Alex 
Salmond’s elephant metaphor. (See3.55pm.)

Andrew ATL is right - Salmond's elephant metaphor is bizarre in the context.

I wonder if he was bouncing off one of the echoes in his copious memory, and 
connecting to Ludovic Kennedy famously describingScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> in a union with England as 'like 
being in bed with an elephant'?

Sturgeon says she hopes to lead party into 2021 election, not just next year's

If the SNP win the Scottish elections next year (that if is probably redundant 
- see 4.11pm),Nicola Sturgeon intends to go on leading the SNP into the next 
elections too, in 2021. By then she would have been in government, as either 
first minister or deputy first minister, for 14 years. She made the declaration 
in an interview with Holyrood magazine. 
<https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-facing-snp>

And what of her future? Given David Cameron has already said he will not stay 
on as leader for a third term, when does she intend to stand down?

“There’s not much David Cameron does that I wish to emulate,” she laughs. “I 
think that should be another one.

“Look, I have been first minister for less than a year, and I am about to face 
an election which for the first time I will look the Scottish people in the eye 
and say, ‘vote for me as first minister’.

“I think it would be rather strange if I was already deciding when I would 
stand down, but let’s put it this way, if I win the next election, and I take 
nothing for granted, then it will be my plan to also fight the election after 
that as leader as well, all being well and unforeseen circumstances aside.”

(Originally the Scottish parliament had four year terms, but the elections 
planned for 2015 were postponed a year so that they did not coincide with the 
Westminster elections and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means thatScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> cannot go back to four-year terms 
without another clash.

James Morris,who organised polling for Labour when Ed Miliband was leader, has

Earlier I highlighted some criticism of the SNP’s domestic record. (See 
11.09am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/16/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-swinney-on-health-and-education-snp-conference-live#block-5620c250e4b094f6bf347a35>
But it does not seem to having much impact, according toMark Diffley, director 
of Ipsos MORI Scotland. He has writtenan article looking at the SNP’s polling 
ratings 
<https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/polling-analysis-nothing-looks-halting-snp-bandwagon>
 and he says that, as well as being ahead on voting intentional overall (no 
surprise), the SNP is also ahead when asked which party has the best policies 
on issues like health and education.

Our own polling, most recently from August, highlights how SNP support has 
soared, in particular over the last 12 months. More widely, no poll conducted 
since May this year has shown the SNP constituency vote below 50 per cent. 
Moreover, the SNP leads Scottish Labour on the regional vote by at least 20 
percentage points in every poll conducted over the same period.

And if the other parties think that recent negative headlines for the 
Government over key issues such as educational standards and the performance of 
PoliceScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> might signal a change 
in public attitudes, they may be disappointed.

On almost all the key devolved issues, voters tend to think that the SNP has 
‘the best policies for Scotland’ (the only exception is the environment, where 
the Greens come out on top). In the case of health, education and crime policy, 
the party’s lead is as significant as its lead in voting intention, suggesting 
that those headlines do not, at the moment, appear to be damaging the party 
electorally.

This is particularly bleak for Scottish Labour, whose intended strategy of 
holding the SNP to account for its nine years in office looks unlikely at this 
stage to be a vote winner.

In an interview with LBC Alex Salmond produced what must be the most bizarre 
metaphor ever to explain who the SNP will know when it is right to hold a 
second referendum on independence.
Rachel Humphreys (@rachel_hump) 
Alex Salmond on #indyref <https://twitter.com/hashtag/indyref?src=hash> on @LBC
 <https://twitter.com/LBC> "It's like an elephant coming into your room..you 
don't know it's coming but you know when it's there"

<https://twitter.com/rachel_hump/status/655024157894254593> 
One obvious problem with this metaphor is that elephants don’t actually come 
into rooms. And, if they did, they would knock it down (although, if the room 
is the union, knocking it down is part of Salmond’s plan.)

As LBC’s Rachel Humphreys points out, the elephant isn’t in the room yet.

In Norman Smith’s interview with Nicola Sturgeon earlier (see 1.58pm)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/16/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-swinney-on-health-and-education-snp-conference-live#block-5620f3d9e4b094f6bf347b34>
he also put a question to her from a viewer about the European championships. 
Given that Scotland have not qualified, will she be backing England? Yes, she 
replied, “I wish England well.” But Scotland was still in the rugby world cup, 
she said.

She was also asked about her offer earlier this year to take some Syrian 
refugees into her own home. 
<http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/nicola-sturgeon-happy-to-give-refugees-a-home-1-3879126#axzz3ok6LDMmh>
“That offer stands,” she replied.

If we are in a position where individuals have been asked to open up their 
homes to refugees, then I would be very happy to play my part in doing that.

But Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has not taken any 
Syrian refugees yet, she said.

Swinney says it takes too long to travel between Aberdeen and Inverness.

This morning the Scottish government signed a contract to upgrade the rail 
line between Aberdeen and Inverness. It’s a £170m project that will benefit 
both cities, he says.

Swinney says Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has had 12 
quarters of uninterrupted growth.

But the government needs to ensure that the economy remains competitive.

And it needs to adapt to the challenges of an ageing population.

Swinney says earlier today a contract was signed to build two new ferries in 
Glasgow. That will guarantee jobs in the shipyard, he says.

Swinney says just a few miles from here there is poverty that should have no 
place in a modern country. We are a wealthy country. But we are a country 
blighted by poverty that should have no place here, he says.

Inequality weakens the fabric of society. It dilutes skills and wastes talent, 
he says.

There must be a national effort to tackle poverty, he says.

Swinney says, for all the talk of blue-collar Toryism, the cuts are hitting 
the vulnerable three times as much as they are hitting the rich.

But it has taken Labour a long time to work out what was going on.

Some Labour MPs even wanted to abstain on the fiscal charter.

But the fiscal charter was about entrenching the way on the public sector, he 
says. Labour should have opposed it from day one.

Swinney says the SNP can be proud of its record.

University tuition is free. Free bus passes for pensioners have been 
protected, and free prescription charges. The SNP has got rid of the bedroom 
tax. Household incomes have been helped by the council tax freeze. And the

Swinney says the SNP has the team and the record to win the Scottish elections 
next year. It can win a historic third term, he says.

He will be campaign director, he says.

Winning is based on hard work, he says.

Since the election he has heard stories about how bad Labour’s campaign was. 
In some constituencies they had not knocked on people’s doors for decades. They 
lost touch with the people. And they took people for granted.

The SNP must never stop listening to people, he says. It is not just good 
politics. It is who we are.

The SNP are the national party of all of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>, he says.

Scottish government will use new powers over welfare “to the maximum” when they 
are devolved to Holyrood. As the Press Association reports, with powers over 
some benefits to be devolved as part of the Scotland bill, Neil said work on 
how these could be used is already under way. The SNP will publish a bill 
setting out its plans for social security in the new year, he said. This will 
include scrapping the “84-day rule” under which children who are in hospital 
for 84 days or more lose their disability benefits. Neil said: “Within the 
first day of the new powers we will abolish that rule.” He also vowed there 
would be a “fairer deal” for carers, stating: “The money they get is the 
equivalent to what a Tory Cabinet minister would spend on a good lunch in Soho.”

Iain Black from the party’s Forth branch, one of the founding members of SMAUG 
(SNP Members Against Unconventional Gas), told delegates: 
We believe that the evidence and the science absolutely and overwhelmingly 
supports a ban. There’s science, and then there’s science that’s paid for by 
big business with research grants. The SNP is about healthy communities, you 
can’t have healthy communities if you destroy the land, if you destroy the air, 
if you destroy the water that we drink. It’s Scotland’s land, it’s Scotland’s 
air, it’s Scotland’s water.

But, in an article in the Scottish Sun, Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive of 
chemicals company Ineos, said fracking offeredScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> a “last chance” to gain economic 
independence. He said:

Shale gas is Scotland’s best and last chance to gain economic independence. We 
respect the Scottish Government is deep in thought over fracking. It’s an 
important decision for the country to take. But take too long and the 
opportunity will pass by.

England is now moving forward with shale and it would be a tragedy for 
Scotland if they end up taking the lead in this exciting industry, securing the 
jobs and investments. It could mean that the north-west of England becomes the 
next Aberdeen, rather than our central belt.

passed in front of my very eyes.

I often find myself looking across that chamber at the Tory MPs and I think 
‘are you so genuinely out of touch that you can’t see the damage you are 
doing’. Either way I am tired of being lectured by Tories as to why austerity 
is essential, why these welfare reforms - in fact they’re not reforms, they’re 
cuts - are essential. I’m tired of being told pensioners cost too much, I’m 
tired of our young people being told they’re not good enough, I’m tired of 
immigrants being scapegoated for the mistakes of bankers and politicians. I’m 
tired of being told that pain and misery are necessary for a stronger economy, 
for a long term economic plan.

Andrew ATL is right - Salmond's elephant metaphor is bizarre in the context.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/16/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-swinney-on-health-and-education-snp-conference-live#block-56210e10e4b01867c5abeaa2>

I wonder if he was bouncing off one of the echoes in his copious memory, and 
connecting to Ludovic Kennedy famously describingScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> in a union with England as 'like 
being in bed with an elephant'?
 
If the SNP win the Scottish elections next year (that if is probably redundant 
- see 4.11pm),Nicola Sturgeon intends to go on leading the SNP into the next 
elections too, in 2021. By then she would have been in government, as either 
first minister or deputy first minister, for 14 years. She made the declaration 
in an interview with Holyrood magazine. 
<https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-facing-snp>

And what of her future? Given David Cameron has already said he will not stay 
on as leader for a third term, when does she intend to stand down?

“There’s not much David Cameron does that I wish to emulate,” she laughs. “I 
think that should be another one.

“Look, I have been first minister for less than a year, and I am about to face 
an election which for the first time I will look the Scottish people in the eye 
and say, ‘vote for me as first minister’.

“I think it would be rather strange if I was already deciding when I would 
stand down, but let’s put it this way, if I win the next election, and I take 
nothing for granted, then it will be my plan to also fight the election after 
that as leader as well, all being well and unforeseen circumstances aside.”

(Originally the Scottish parliament had four year terms, but the elections 
planned for 2015 were postponed a year so that they did not coincide with the 
Westminster elections and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means thatScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> cannot go back to four-year terms 
without another clash.

James Morris,who organised polling for Labour when Ed Miliband was leader, has 
issued a smart response.
AndrewSparrow (@AndrewSparrow) 
Labour strategy of attacking SNP over record on health, education etc unlikely

Earlier I highlighted some criticism of the SNP’s domestic record. (See 
11.09am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/16/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-swinney-on-health-and-education-snp-conference-live#block-5620c250e4b094f6bf347a35>
But it does not seem to having much impact, according toMark Diffley, director 
of Ipsos MORI Scotland. He has writtenan article looking at the SNP’s polling 
ratings 
<https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/polling-analysis-nothing-looks-halting-snp-bandwagon>
 and he says that, as well as being ahead on voting intentional overall (no 
surprise), the SNP is also ahead when asked which party has the best policies 
on issues like health and education.

Our own polling, most recently from August, highlights how SNP support has 
soared, in particular over the last 12 months. More widely, no poll conducted 
since May this year has shown the SNP constituency vote below 50 per cent. 
Moreover, the SNP leads Scottish Labour on the regional vote by at least 20 
percentage points in every poll conducted over the same period.

And if the other parties think that recent negative headlines for the 
Government over key issues such as educational standards and the performance of 
PoliceScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> might signal a change 
in public attitudes, they may be disappointed.

On almost all the key devolved issues, voters tend to think that the SNP has 
‘the best policies for Scotland’ (the only exception is the environment, where 
the Greens come out on top). In the case of health, education and crime policy, 
the party’s lead is as significant as its lead in voting intention, suggesting 
that those headlines do not, at the moment, appear to be damaging the party 
electorally.

This is particularly bleak for Scottish Labour, whose intended strategy of 
holding the SNP to account for its nine years in office looks unlikely at this 
stage to be a vote winner.
 
In an interview with LBC Alex Salmond produced what must be the most bizarre 
metaphor ever to explain who the SNP will know when it is right to hold a 
second referendum on independence.
Rachel Humphreys (@rachel_hump) 
Alex Salmond on #indyref <https://twitter.com/hashtag/indyref?src=hash> on @LBC
 <https://twitter.com/LBC> "It's like an elephant coming into your room..you 
don't know it's coming but you know when it's there"
 <https://twitter.com/rachel_hump/status/655024157894254593> October 16, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/rachel_hump/status/655024157894254593> 
One obvious problem with this metaphor is that elephants don’t actually come 
into rooms. And, if they did, they would knock it down (although, if the room 
is the union, knocking it down is part of Salmond’s plan.)

In Norman Smith’s interview with Nicola Sturgeon earlier (see 1.58pm)

he also put a question to her from a viewer about the European championships. 
Given that Scotland have not qualified, will she be backing England? Yes, she 
replied, “I wish England well.” But Scotland was still in the rugby world cup, 
she said.

She was also asked about her offer earlier this year to take some Syrian 
refugees into her own home. 
<http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/nicola-sturgeon-happy-to-give-refugees-a-home-1-3879126#axzz3ok6LDMmh>
“That offer stands,” she replied.

If we are in a position where individuals have been asked to open up their 
homes to refugees, then I would be very happy to play my part in doing that.

But Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has not taken any 
Syrian refugees yet, she said.
 
Swinney says replacing stamp duty with a land and building transaction tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/09/scottish-government-mansion-tax>
 has taken 10,000 home-buyers out of tax every year.
 
Swinney says the attainment gap in schools has begun to close. Students from 
poor backgrounds have never had a better chance of going to university.
 
Swinney comes to his plan to let councils in Scotland to cut business rates 
from the end of this month. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34546277>

The SNP wants to ensure Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> 
remains the most competitive place to do business in the UK, he says.
 
Swinney says broadband is essential. Community Broadband Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has been set up to connect 
communities that BT won’t reach.
 
Swinney says it takes too long to travel between Aberdeen and Inverness.

This morning the Scottish government signed a contract to upgrade the rail 
line between Aberdeen and Inverness. It’s a £170m project that will benefit 
both cities, he says.
 
Swinney says Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has had 12 
quarters of uninterrupted growth.

But the government needs to ensure that the economy remains competitive.

And it needs to adapt to the challenges of an ageing population.

Swinney says earlier today a contract was signed to build two new ferries in 
Glasgow. That will guarantee jobs in the shipyard, he says.
 
Swinney says just a few miles from here there is poverty that should have no 
place in a modern country. We are a wealthy country. But we are a country 
blighted by poverty that should have no place here, he says.

Inequality weakens the fabric of society. It dilutes skills and wastes talent, 
he says.

There must be a national effort to tackle poverty, he says.
 
Swinney says, for all the talk of blue-collar Toryism, the cuts are hitting 
the vulnerable three times as much as they are hitting the rich.

But it has taken Labour a long time to work out what was going on.

Some Labour MPs even wanted to abstain on the fiscal charter.

But the fiscal charter was about entrenching the way on the public sector, he 
says. Labour should have opposed it from day one.
 
Swinney says the SNP can be proud of its record.

University tuition is free. Free bus passes for pensioners have been 
protected, and free prescription charges. The SNP has got rid of the bedroom 
tax. Household incomes have been helped by the council tax freeze. And the 
living wage has been introduced for firms with public sector contracts.
 
Swinney says the SNP has the team and the record to win the Scottish elections 
next year. It can win a historic third term, he says.

He will be campaign director, he says.

Winning is based on hard work, he says.

Since the election he has heard stories about how bad Labour’s campaign was. 
In some constituencies they had not knocked on people’s doors for decades. They 
lost touch with the people. And they took people for granted.

The SNP must never stop listening to people, he says. It is not just good 
politics. It is who we are.

The SNP are the national party of all of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>, he says.
