There are many powerful emotions in the world: giving birth, walking again 
after a long debilitating illness, seeing your first daughter wed even though 
all the doctors said she'd never see her first birthday. But surpassing all of 
those, as we all know, is watching a previous X Factor winner performing their 
new single.

And/or putting their nail varnish on.

Whatever, the sight of one of our national icons slapping high-gloss emulsion 
on their fingertips is enough to build anticipation for the tidal wave of pride 
that is the video release of any such monetarily-elected representative.

And the sight of her happy-muppet-impression face in a mirror brings a 
swelling of pride akin only to seeing your name spelled out in 50ft-high 
Union-flag-patterned letters on the white cliffs of Dover or hearing the Queen 
say she'd like to thank you, personally, for being such a wonderful British 
subject.

Because Alexandra Burke <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke> 
(God Save Her AND the Queen) is one of the artists that the British public has 
chosen as their representative on Earth (and on iTunes) so it is understandable 
that they should be excited to see what kind of great British Artist she has 
been made into.

And slightly deflated and confused when we find her strapping herself into the 
Playboy version of an American football uniform, in a pair of tickle-me-heels, 
giving high-fives to pneumatic-breasted blonde women that, sure as ducks are 
waterproof, aren't from Rotherham.

It is, we sigh, quite American indeed, this paying lipservice to a completely 
foreign sport, with no irony, hubris or ribaldry involved. Until we realise, of 
course, that there's another team involved, in another locker room, thinking 
(we can only assume) the exact same thing.

Oh! Perhaps Burke and her gaggle of perky and curvaceous team-mates have 
actually come to play a game of American football â€“ or more accurately, since 
the ball is most often touched by the hand and is more egg than ball-shaped, 
American handegg. And perhaps by doing this, Burke's lack of knowledge when it 
comes to off-tackle running plays will only highlight her Britishness.

Oh, I give up. Unless voguing is the Mill Hill/Malibu equivalent of the Maori 
haka. Probably not. It's most likely just a marketing-driven not-very-charming 
imitation of a scene from Glee (in an episode yet to air in the UK).

Rethinking her tactical approach to mid-Atlantic success, we keep finding our 
heroine, icon, national treasure ducking into the tunnel to check on team 
strategy.

But what IS the strategy here? Maybe they're trying to work that out in a 
huddle like this one on the field ...

 (One of at least five in the video, mainly held to discuss how little they 
know about football, it seems.) Anyway, what is it with X Factor winners? They 
disappear for a year to "improve their chances of being marketable", and come 
back pretending to be more American than any American artist would ever bother 
to be. And they're STILL embraced as the girl-next-door.

Of all the sports to pick, they had to pick this.

I mean, at least they're not pretending that Burke knows any more about it 
than anyone who voted for her does. The closest we see to them playing are the 
multitudes of brainstorming huddles ("Are your knickers up yer arse?", "Yeah", 
"Mine too", "What do we do now?", "Dunno", "Brilliant") and occasionally 
engaging in the offensive line ...

 ... by putting on lipstick, and then walking off again.

Even the other team seem confused by what's going on.

And regardless of their confusion (or perhaps in honour of it) no more handegg 
is attempted.

Celebrating everything that she has failed to achieve in the course of this 
video, our premium-rate representative X-Factorist Alexandra Burke leaves the 
field, high-fiving left and right.

And that is it. They are done. Not Alexandra: this being not her fault, she's 
welcome to have a pop career for as long as she can. But this video is done. 
And, for anyone who is interested in sport, I believe Burke's team lost.
Because frankly, that was terrible handegg. And even a football fan can spot 
that.
