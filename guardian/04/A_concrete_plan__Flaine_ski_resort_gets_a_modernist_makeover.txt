Flicking through a back issue of Elle Deco recently, I came across a profile 
of the Hungarian modernist designer Marcel Breuer, a protege of the Bauhaus 
movement’s instigator, Walter Gropius, and later a teacher at the Bauhus 
school. Breuer, it said, was most famous for his “revolutionary, rectilinear 
tubular-steel furniture” and especially for a shiny “B3” armchair he designed, 
inspired by bicycle handlebars.

Well to furniture design aficionados he may be, but to skiers he’s the creator 
of Flaine, the purpose-built French ski resort in the Alps’ Grand Massif. When 
the resort was commissioned, in the early 1960s, Breuer was an understandable 
choice for developers Eric and Sylvie Boissonnas: they were forward-thinking 
modern-art lovers who had a grand utopian plan to establish an original example 
of architecture and urban planning in France – a mountain resort with the feel 
of a city.

 The lounge/bar/lobby 
Breuer already had stellar projects including Unesco’s Paris headquarters 
under his belt (and went on to design New York’s Whitney Museum of American 
Art), but what he created was shockingly different from anything else in the 
Alps, then and perhaps since. A whole resort village in stark concrete – almost 
brutalist structures as far removed from the traditional chocolate-box chalet 
as could be, in a formerly unspoilt valley.

When Breuer first laid eyes on the location in Haute Savoie, flying above it 
by helicoptor,he remarked “What a wonderful site! How do we avoid spoiling it?” 
In the following decades many would complain that he hadn’t. Tastes turned 
against concrete blocks, and through the 1980s and 90s, Flaine was widely 
considered a carbuncle on the pristine scenery, associated more with the skiing 
mass market than art.

 The hotel’s stark concrete exterior 
But now, thanks to a revived appreciation of brutalist and modernist 
architecture, Flaine seems attractive again, and one of Breuer’s original 
hotels, the Totem, which opened in 1971, has been reborn as the super-stylish 
Hotel Terminal Neige Totem, operated by the Maisons et Hotels Sibuet group.

A real departure from the chain’s staple of Alpine luxury, it has 
stripped-down, semi-industrial interiors, neon signs and graphic murals in all 
96 rooms. The vast open-plan lobby/lounge/bar/restaurant is packed with vintage 
furniture and arcade games, chairs reupholstered in colourful kilims, Native 
American-inspired textiles and flashy lighting. Even the ski hire room is cool, 
like a skate store in an up-and-coming neighbourhood, and staff wear extrovert 
T-shirts stating “Skiers Are Better Lovers”.

 Bedroom at Hotel Terminal Neige 
The Totem is the first in the group’s new, more wallet-friendly and youthful 
Terminal Neige collection, the project of the second generation of Sibuets, the 
founders’ children, Nicolas, 32, and Marie, 28 – though their mother (and 
company co-founder) Jocelyne has overseen it. She hopes it will be the Alps’ 
answer to Mama Shelter – the hip Parisian hangout that raised the bar for the 
hostel sector.

The bones of the building are still totally Breuer. He designed everything in 
the original Flaine (it has since expanded to include other developments), from 
the fireplaces in the hotels and apartments to the font for the signs – and 
much of it is a protected “historic monument”. Visible from some of the hotel 
windows is a towering totem pole by Picasso. It’s one of several sculptures 
donated to the resort by the Boissonnas family: the base is also home to works 
by Dubuffet and Vasarely, and to Picasso’s plus-size version of his Tête de 
Femme.

 The Picasso totem pole 
When I visited during opening week in December, the operation was still 
getting up to speed. The buffet dinner concept wasn’t quite working (with hot 
dishes such as casseroles ready prepared, but vegetables cooked slowly on 
demand). The lunch menu was good and inventive though, and breakfast involved 
pastries aplenty, and excellent coffee from the bar.

I can see this becoming the young social hub its aiming to be. Flaine’s main 
draw is that you are already halfway up the mountain: the slopes are right 
outside, and the lifts connect into the wider ski area, incorporating the more 
traditional villages of Sixt and Morillon. There are family-friendly and 
intermediate slopes galore, views of Mont Blanc, and powder bowls. Even in 
snow-starved December, 90% of runs were open.

Next up for the collection are a rehaul of the old Refuge du Montenvers in 
Chamonix, at the top of the Montenvers railway on the Mer de Glace, for 2017; 
and the Terminal Neige Gare, opening in a disused cable car station in Avoriaz 
in 2018 – exciting sounding projects both. Elle Deco should take note.
