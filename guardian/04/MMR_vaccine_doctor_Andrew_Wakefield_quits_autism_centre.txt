Andrew Wakefield <https://www.theguardian.com/society/andrew-wakefield>, the 
doctor whose research triggered a health scare over the MMR vaccine in Britain, 
has resigned from the autism centre he founded in Texas.

His resignation follows disciplinary hearings at the General Medical Council 
in London last month which ruled he acted dishonestly and irresponsibly over a 
1998 paper in the Lancet medical journal which claimed to have found a link 
between theMMR <https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr> jab, bowel disease and 
autism.

The research prompted a slump in the number of children administered the jab 
for measles, mumps and rubella. At the time of his research Wakefield was 
working at the Royal Free hospital school in London.

In 2005 Wakefield, 53, established the autism centre Thoughtful House in 
­Austin, Texas, while his research came under increasing scrutiny in the UK.

Thoughtful House said Wakefield had left his post ­voluntarily to avoid the 
controversy overshadowing the centre's work. "The needs of the children we 
serve must always come first. All of us at Thoughtful House are grateful to Dr 
­Wakefield for the valuable work he has done here," the clinic said.

"We fully support his decision to leave in order to make sure the recent GMC 
­findings did not interfere with the ­important work that our team of 
clinicians and researchers is doing on behalf of ­children with autism."

Initially Thoughtful House stood behind Wakefield despite the GMC's ruling on 
28 January, saying it was disappointed by the "unfounded and unfair" charges 
made against him and two colleagues.

Wakefield has stood by his initial research. With counsel, he took part in the 
GMC fitness to practise hearing, though he did not attend the day on which the 
panel handed down its adverse finding.

Andrew Wakefield had refused to attend the GMC hearing. This has been corrected.
