Eddie Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/eddie-jones> has accused 
several leading Australian rugby pundits of disrespecting his squad and 
England’s head coach is predicting more dirty tricks in the lead-up to the 
second Test against the Wallabies, 1-0 down in the best-of-three series, in 
Melbourne on Saturday.

Jones reacted angrily to what he called a “disgusting” promotional video 
<http://www.rugbydump.com/2016/06/5123/fox-sports-australia-pull-no-punches-in-new-promo-mocking-england-ahead-of-series>
 aired by Fox Sports before the first Test in Brisbane and took exception to 
post-match questions posed by the former international Stephen Hoiles, who is 
employed on a rugby show on the same network.

Hoiles attempted to make fun of Jones’s reaction to England’s gripping 39-28 
victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/11/australia-england-first-test-match-report>
, after which the head coach celebrated the outcome with a second former 
Wallaby Glen Ella, who isworking with England as a coaching consultant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/england-glen-ella-skills-coach-australia-tour>
. Jones was not amused and believes the touring team are worthy of more 
respect. “You’ve seen the Fox promos, they are disgusting,” he said. “It is 
quite demeaning and disrespectful to the team.

“I’m not worried about myself. I can handle myself, don’t worry about that. 
All I am saying is there’s been a disrespectful way in which the team has been 
treated in the media here.”

The head coach also suspects there may be more to come. “I am sure they are 
all going to be lining up,” Jones said. “There has been a row of ex-Wallaby 
players – you’ve had Hoiles, you’ve had Simon Poidevin and you’ve had Phil 
Kearns. David Campese has got to be somewhere. He is coming for sure. I can see 
next week something is going to happen.”

Jones is no stranger to media spats in his native country but the notion of an 
Australian coaching England to a series victory over the Wallabies is clearly a 
source of potential local friction.


Hoiles’s crass line of questioning – “You’ve been in the press more than 
Donald Trump this week … you and Glen looked lubed up, how did you enjoy that 
moment up in the box?” – also seemed not to impress his compatriot Ella, who 
subsequentlytweeted <https://twitter.com/glen_ella>: “Swing Low Sweet Chariots.”

England, though, remain wary of their hosts, with Jones insisting his players 
will have to perform better than they did in Brisbane. “It is like scoring a 
Test hundred, no one ever takes that away from you. We have done that but next 
week is even more important. Australian teams prefer to be underdogs, so they 
are going to be happy. They hate losing here. We need to make sure we have good 
focus. The Australians will come at us left, right and centre.”

The Wallabies will be without their world-class back-rower David Pocock, who 
will besidelined for six weeks with a fractured eye socket

, for the rest of the series but Jones says England have no pressing selection 
issues. “We want to improve the side every week, that’s all we’re trying to do. 
I don’t see that as selection issues.”

Eddie Jones: England can still improve after victory over Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jun/12/eddie-jones-england-can-still-improve-after-victory-over-australia-video>
George Ford, an influential replacement on Saturday, will be among those 
pushing hard for a starting place. “It is a big week ahead,” the fly-half said. 
“We have all played a game and we can look at video of each other. It will be 
interesting what the teams now do next week in terms of tactics.”

England have never won a three-Test series in the southern hemisphere but have 
tasted success in Melbourne. Theybeat the Wallabies 25-14 in June 2003
