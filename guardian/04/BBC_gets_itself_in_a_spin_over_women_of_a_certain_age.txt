THE BBC employs many spin doctors and press people to steer it through 
thickets of misunderstanding and flak. Did they recommend dishing out pat 
scripts to all and sundry concerned withStrictly Come Dancing, plugging a 
strangely Soviet line on Alesha, Arlene and Co? Did they recommend that the DG 
give interviews to a WI magazine saying that "theBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> values the contribution of older women 
immensely" then think about calling the Moira/Anna generation back to the front 
line?

What did they say when the chairman of the trust started chattering to the 
Times about X-Factor scheduling clashes, competitive mistakes and the sad fact 
that once "viewers were asked to make a choice between the two programmes, that 
choice didn't favour the BBC"? Did any of them mention thatThe X Factor and 
Strictly have clashed 40 times already during their runs, with nobody raising a 
cheep of interest or difficulty?

It's been, by strict spin standards, a bit of a gabby, inflated debacle. A 
mountain of mire built on a molehill of fact. Strictly the thing that any giant 
corporation pays top professionals to help it avoid.
