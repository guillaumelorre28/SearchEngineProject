Dragons' Den rules state that I'm allowed to act like a hugely self-satisfied 
arse no matter which nervous civilian trying to make a better life for 
themselves is standing before me. Life rules are less reasonable, so this 
morning I found myself having to listen while my tailor explained his delivery 
of my special socks had been held up. I'd heard enough.

"Telecoms millionaire Peter Jones has heard enough," I shouted, wishing Evan 
Davis's unnecessarily respectful voiceover could attend me in my daily life, 
elevating all my pettish outbursts into something with the veneer of importance.

Since I got the gong, I keep asking the BBC to upgrade it to "Telecoms 
millionaire Peter Jones CBE has had enough", but they won't. I loathe lefties. 
Unlike them, I work hard and I play hard, too. You can tell by my bright ties, 
pocket handkerchiefs and co-ordinating stripy socks. They immediately alert 
people to the fact that I'm not just another south-east-born businessman who 
lives in a McMansion and bangs on about driving a Maybach. They're my "thing". 
My trademark. Ordinarily, I wouldn't let anyone talk about ownership of an idea 
unless they had a patent pending on it – but I'm not going to take out a patent 
on my innovative use of socks. Iam those socks. No one else has the necessary 
drive and contacts to bring those socks to public view, and if anyone thinks 
they do, I wish them luck because they're going to need it. And for that 
reason, I told my tailor, you're out.
