The Trainwreck star is currently filming an untitled action comedy with Goldie 
Hawn and has decided to remove a sequence involving a character shooting a gun 
at people, according toE! News 
<http://www.eonline.com/news/773424/amy-schumer-cuts-gun-scene-out-of-new-movie-following-orlando-mass-shooting>
. The film, directed by 50/50’s Jonathan Levine, centres on a mother and 
daughter who encounter trouble while on holiday in Hawaii.

Schumer has been a public advocate of gun control

, working with her cousin, senator Chuck Schumer, to call for higher 
restrictions on sales. She also introduced the hashtag #aimingforchange to 
highlight loopholes in legislation that can allow violent criminals and people 
with severe mental illness to buy guns. Last summer,two people were shot dead 
during a screening

 of her film Trainwreck.

“When I heard about this news, I was completely devastated … then I was angry,”
Schumer said last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/03/amy-schumer-to-push-for-us-gun-control-after-trainwreck-shootings>
. “My heart goes out to [the victims] Jillian and Mayci, to the survivors, to 
the families and everyone who is tied to the tragic, senseless and horrifying 
actions of this man who shouldn’t have been able to put his hands on a gun in 
the first place.”

After the mass shooting at an Orlando gay club on Sunday, Schumer tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/742043904527073280> that she found the 
news “sickening” and has since shared a number of tweets reinforcing her 
position on gun control.
