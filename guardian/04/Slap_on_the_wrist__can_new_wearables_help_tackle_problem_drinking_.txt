How many units of alcohol do you drink each week? It’s a question most people 
stumble over.

It’s not easy to monitor alcohol intake. So often a doctor asks and the 
patient tries to quickly calculate the recommended weekly units, before 
settling on a slightly lower figure. It’s an issue too for those who want to 
figure out whether they have reached drink-driving limits. But tech companies 
claim to have a solution to this problem.

The San Francisco-based BACtrack, for example, makes breathalysers for law 
enforcement agencies. But recently it won a$200,000 (£136,000) government prize 
<https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaaa-selects-winners-its-wearable-alcohol-biosensor-challenge>
 for an alcohol-monitoring device of a different kind: one that users can apply 
to their bodies.

Skyn, BACtrack’s winning entry, looks like the sort of wristband runners wear 
to measure their speed and heartbeat – but it measures the body’s alcohol 
content. Three quarters of an hour after drinking, the Skyn’s wearer can see 
their blood alcohol content (BAC) on the wristband.

The prototype device, which will be available at the end of the year and 
retail for $99 (£68), works by tracking ethanol molecules escaping through the 
skin. It’s intended for “serious use cases – people with a serious alcohol 
issue who could benefit from continuous, non-invasive monitoring,” says Keith 
Nothacker, BACtrack’s president and CEO.

“Having a low-cost, small, discreet, wearable can dramatically simplify 
treatment for millions of people ... Imagine going out for drinks and your 
smart watch displaying your estimated BAC. No pausing to take a breath test – 
the result is just there, continuously.”

The competition won by Skyn was organised by the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) in the US. That a government agency is looking to incentivise 
alcohol-measuring gadgets suggests that the US government is trying to find new 
ways of preventing alcohol-related diseases, which causeabout 88,000 deaths

 each year in the country.

It is also a nod to the fast-growing market for alcohol-measuring apps and 
gadgets. Among the many iPhone apps now available is IntelliDrink 
($2.99/£2.29). Users enter the number of drinks they are consuming and the app 
calculates their BAC based on their age, weight, height, gender, drinking 
frequency and stomach contents. It can also be set to alert a friend when the 
user has reached a certain alcohol level.

Another iPhone app, R-U-Buzzed?, measures the user’s alcohol level using 
height and weight in addition to the amount of alcohol consumed, and flashes 
“You’re buzzed” when they reach the driving under the influence (DUI) level.

In Sweden, Alcosystems, a company working in collaboration with a teaching 
hospital has developed awireless, fuel-cell powered breathalyser 
<http://www.techworld.com/news/personal-tech/swedish-firm-develops-wireless-breathalyser-for-android-ios-3495412/>
 connected to an app, which recovering alcoholics are using several times a day 
to monitor their progress. The device is available for consumers and companies 
too. However, this is a relatively expensive option – while the app is £1.49, 
the breathalyser is €229 (£175).

The apps and gadgets form a useful new resource, says professor Eileen Kaner, 
chair of public health and primary care research at Newcastle University: “Many 
people drink heavily but don’t want to talk to their doctor about it. And a lot 
of patients worry about taking up too much of their doctor’s time trying to 
figure out how much they drink. Gadgets are useful in such cases.”

Indeed, many people consciously or unconsciously under-report their drinking 
in conversations with their doctor, and often have no way of backing up their 
self-reported drinking habits. “A product like BACtrack Skyn helps people 
become more aware of their alcohol consumption habits,” says Nothacker.

While apps and gadgets are no substitute for doctors and nurses, Kaner says 
they can help people find out more about their behaviour,. “A very small part 
of the population are alcoholics, but a much larger part are heavy drinkers. 
Tech solutions can help them address potential health problems before it’s too 
late.”

Some are more sceptical. “There’s no convincing evidence that tech gadgets are 
better than older techniques in changing behaviour,” says Professor Matt Field 
of the UK Centre for Tobacco andAlcohol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/alcohol> Studies (UKCTAS) at the 
University of Liverpool. Besides, he adds, in most countries DIU levels are so 
low that it’s safer not to drink at all.
