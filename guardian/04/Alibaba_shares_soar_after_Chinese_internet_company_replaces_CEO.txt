Alibaba <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba> shares soared 7% on 
Thursday after the Chinese internet trading company announced it was replacing 
its chief executive as part of a purge of older managers.


The company, which has lost more than $20bn (£13bn) of market value since its 
$231bnflotation on the New York stock exchange

 in September, said current CEO Jonathan Lu would be replaced by chief 
operating officer Daniel Zhang on Sunday.

Investors welcomed the management shake-up, and a better-than-expected 45% 
increase in quarterly sales, sending Alibaba shares up nearly 8% to $86 by 11am.

Despite the share price surge – the biggest intraday increase since September 
– the shares are still far below the $119.15 they hit in a post flotation high 
in November.

Jack Ma, Alibaba’s billionaire founder, said: “Daniel is a proven 
international business leader and innovator with a strong track record of 
delivering results.

“He has the confidence of our entire management team, and there is no better 
person to lead Alibaba Group as we embark on the next stage of our growth on 
top of the strong foundation that Jonathan helped build.”

Zhang, who joined Alibaba in 2007, became chief operating officer in September 
2013 and was the key architect behind Singles Day – the 11 November event that 
has overtaken Black Friday in the US to become the world’s largest online 
shopping event.

Ma said the CEO change, which was part of a wider management shake-up, was 
part of a wider handover of control to a younger generation. “This marks a 
future where the post-70 generation will command the troops at Alibaba Group!,” 
he said in a letter to employees.

However, the age gap between Zhang and Lu is hardly massive. Zhang was born in 
1972, while Lu born in 1969, according to Chinese media.

The announcement came as the company reported a 45% jump in sales in the first 
three months of 2014 to 17.4bn yuan ($2.81bn) – beating analysts’ estimates of 
$2.77bn.

Zhang will be tasked with trying to extend Alibaba’s reach into new markets. 
It has started sales in Russia, Brazil and India through its AliExpress 
service, but international sales accounted for just 9% of its revenue. Ma has 
set a target of getting 50% of sales from outsideChina

Analysts fear Alibaba may also be facing e-commerce user saturation. The 
increase of active buyers, or customers who buy at least one product a year, 
was the slowest in three-and-a-half years – up just 5% from the previous 
quarter to 350m.

Mobile sales eclipsed desktop sales for the first time to account for 51% of 
total revenue, up from 42% in the previous quarter.

Ma, an English teacher-turned businessman who twice failed his university 
entrance exams, founded Alibaba in a cramped one-bedroom flat in China 15 years 
ago.

“We have a dream,” Ma said as he rang the opening bell to officially launch 
the flotation on the NYSE last year. “We hope in the next 15 years the world 
changes because of us. We hope in 15 years people say this is a company like 
Microsoft, IBM, Walmart. They changed, shaped the world … We want to be bigger 
than Walmart.”
