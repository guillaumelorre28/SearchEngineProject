Aegis <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aegis> has acquired US company 
Roundarch in a deal which could cost up to $360m (£228m) if the digital 
agency's management can hit tough targets to trigger maximum earnout payments.

The UK media buying group, which is putting to use a significant chunk of the 
£528mfrom the sale of research business Synovate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/01/aegis-outperforms-market?INTCMP=SRCH>
 last summer, has paid an initial $125m to buy Roundarch.

Aegis has agreed a five-year earnout structure through to 2016 based on 
Roundarch hitting a series of profit targets which it expects will result in 
the business costing $250m.

However, Aegis admitted that if Roundarch "significantly outperforms" 
projections it could pay more, up to a limit of $360m.

Roundarch, which has clients including Avis, HBO and the US air force, will be 
merged with Aegis's Isobar digital network in the US.

Aegis said the deal will push Aegis Media's proportion of revenue from digital 
to 40%.

Roundarch employs 250 staff and has offices in Chicago, Denver, Boston and New 
York.

Aegis made £528m from the sale of Synovate to French research giant Ipsos and 
pledged to use about £300m for acquisitions and return £200m to shareholders 
via a special dividend.

Aegis share price was up 3.2p, or 1.89%, to 172.2p at 4pm.

Last month Aegis won the $3bn-a-year General Motors ad account

, the third-largest global advertiser, in what analysts called a game changing 
win for the UK-listed company.
