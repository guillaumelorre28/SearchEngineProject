Is the aim of music education funding to enable every young person to have 
access to instrumental tuition? Or is it to enable lifelong participation in 
and enjoyment of music? Both are mentioned in the2011 National Plan for Music 
Education 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-importance-of-music-a-national-plan-for-music-education>
 but each requires a different set of activities if it is to be adequately met.

Inclusion: diversifying the offer
Musical inclusion applies to the types of learning opportunities on offer, the 
genres of music included, the diversity of the learners, the variety of 
settings and environments in which learning can take place and the extent to 
which learners are given choices regarding what they learn and how.

The concept of inclusion is contained in the National Plan for Music 
Education. However,a recent report (pdf) 
<http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/pdf/MEH_key_data_final_report_28_02_14.pdf>
 analysing data returns frommusic hubs 
<http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/apply-funding/funding-programmes/music-education-hubs/>
 in 2013 showed that just 12.8% of participants received a subsidy in tuition, 
compared with 18.3% of children being eligible for free school meals nationally.

Similarly, the age range of hub participants was heavily biased towards Key 
Stage 2 (54% of all participants were aged 7-11, compared with 25% of the youth 
population). The range of learning was also dominated by whole class and 
smaller ensemble opportunities and orchestral instruments. The authors of the 
report noted "a core repertoire of mainly classical and chamber music, tiered 
progression ensembles" and "few examples of hip-hop, digital, folk or 
ethnic/world ensembles".

If we want music education to enable people to be musical for life, we must 
diversify the offer beyond instrumental tuition, which does not necessarily 
foster life-long participation in music and can have relatively little impact. 
Despite the broad intentions of the national plan, some are judging its success 
by how many children have engaged with an instrument, for whatever duration, at 
some stage in their primary education. Now is the time to think collectively 
about the intended outcomes of hub funding over and above the numbers of 
children taking part at this level.

Lack of working in partnership 
Music education supported through exciting and committed collaborations 
between schools, music services and cultural organisations (ie the hub model) 
can offer much to children and young people, and there are some strong examples 
of this taking place around the country.

However, recent Youth Music <http://www.youthmusic.org.uk/> research shows 
that there is a persistent lack of inclusivity among those being funded to 
provide out-of-school services and lead hubs. Only 29% of our grant holders 
reported that their work was part of a local music education hub, suggesting 
that in many cases organisations working with diverse young people, using 
diverse practices and working across diverse genres of music are not considered 
hub partners.

Most, if not all, would happily welcome collaborating within their hubs. But 
in many cases the lack of discussion aboutwho and what music education is for 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jul/03/happy-child-music-education-symposium>
 is a large and persistent contributor to this issue.

Becoming more inclusive 
Youth Music's recent changes to its grants programme 
<http://network.youthmusic.org.uk/Funding>, invested as a key part of the 
national plan alongside Arts Council England (ACE) and Department for Education 
funds, are based on a vision of a musically inclusive England where all young 
people are able to access and make progress in music-making, despite any 
barriers.

These barriers can include hub lead partners focusing too narrowly on 
instrumental tuition of a limited duration, the large bias towards orchestral 
instruments and repertoire, and not being between 7 and 11-years-old. They 
might also include having a disability, not being in school, being unable to 
clearly describe your musical goals and ambitions, or those not being regarded 
as "proper" music.

At Youth Music <https://www.theguardian.com/education/music> we're aiming to 
change things by ensuring that our funding is invested proportionately to 
existing need and provision across each region. The new funding model also 
considers "youth" as being up to the age of 25, in recognition of the growing 
needs and declining provision for older young people.

Most importantly, the entire programme aims to make all opportunities more 
inclusive by building partnerships within and across hubs and celebrating the 
diversity of music education in England, the diversity of young people making 
music and the diversity of music that is being made.

The £18m additional funding to music education hubs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jul/23/good-news-music-education>
 in 2015-16 is welcome at a time when investment in arts and culture is in 
decline. However, it's essential that all of us in music education think 
clearly about the ultimate goals of hubs and out-of-school cultural education 
in general to ensure the money is invested wisely. Let's challenge ourselves to 
be more musically inclusive to bring the aspirations of the National Plan for 
Music Education fully to life.
