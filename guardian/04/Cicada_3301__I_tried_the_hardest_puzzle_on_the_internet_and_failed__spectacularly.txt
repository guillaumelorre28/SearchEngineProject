The hardest puzzle on the internet is not, perhaps, something to be attempted 
on whim during a quiet January afternoon.

But ever since I first heard about Cicada 3301, a mysterious event somewhere 
at the intersection of a game, a competition and a job interview, I'd wanted to 
test my mettle. It couldn't be that hard, right?

Wrong.

Cicada 3301 first appeared in January 2012, with a picture posted on 4Chan, 
the notorious message board which has given birth to everything from Lolcats to
Anonymous <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous>.

In white text on a black background, the posted message read: "Hello. We are 
looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a 
test.

"There is a message hidden in this image.

"Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to 
meeting the few that will make it all the way through.

"Good luck."

It was signed "3301".
 The puzzles have been going since 2011. This duck was one of the first.

That message led to a series of puzzles, each harder than the last. The first 
few were just about solvable by a canny individual working alone, requiring 
little more than mild coding ability and wordplay to get past. But as 
participants fell deeper into the rabbit hole, the references became less 
obvious – one clue involved a poem from a collection of medieval Welsh 
manuscripts, another a quote from a William Gibson book which was only released 
on 3.5 inch floppies.

Co-operating on chatrooms and message boards, a growing collection of puzzle 
solvers broke the codes, one by one. When the game moved into the real world 
– a series of GPS co-ordinates were posted, leading to QR codes attached to 
lampposts over five different nations, from Poland to Australia – it was clear 
that no single person could hope to solve everything.

But as quickly as the co-operation was encouraged, it was snuffed out. The 
final puzzle directed players to an address for a website on Tor, the anonymous 
browser now best known for its use by the Silk Road black market. But only the 
fastest movers ever got to see what was on the page: it was shortly blanked, 
and replaced with the statement "We want the best, not the followers." For 
those deemed "followers", Cicada was over.

Repetition

Then, on January 5 2013, exactly a year and a day after the first posting, a 
new image was uploaded onto 4chan's /b/ message board. "Hello again. Our search 
for intelligent individuals now continues," it began. Again, the image led to a 
series of puzzles; again, the puzzles eventually pointed to locations in the 
real world; and again, the trail was abruptly closed off to all but the best 
players.

Those who had failed two years in a row had no choice but to wait and hope the 
pattern would repeat itself.

It did.

This year's puzzle began slightly differently. Rather than an image posted on 
4chan, a Twitter feed which had been involved in 2013's hunt sprang to life 
again,sharing yet another image of white text on a black background  
<https://twitter.com/1231507051321/status/420087183957966849>– albeit one with 
more gnomic text than ever before.

"Hello. Epiphany is upon you. Your pilgrimage has begun. Enlightenment awaits."

This year, I tried to join in the hunt. So far, it hasn't gone well.

In fact, it couldn't have started any worse. There are two messages buried in 
the image file. The first is easy enough to get at: the black of the image 
isn't actually pure black. Instead, in very dark grey, is the image of a 
cicada. A couple of seconds messing with the colour levels in Photoshop, and 
I'd made it visible. Success!

Unfortunately, the actually important message was harder to get.

As with the previous two years, the image included text hidden with 
steganography, a technique which lets users bury information in seemingly 
innocuous files. To get the information out required me to use a program called 
OutGuess. To install OutGuess, I need to compile the program from source. To do 
that, I need to install Xcode, the Mac OS X developer tools, create a new 
command line project based on the source code I downloaded, reconfigure the 
program for Mac, deal with any dependency issues, build it, and then run it 
from the terminal.

What I actually do is spend the better part of an hour clicking around in 
Xcode, desperately trying to find a magic button to click which will make 
everything work without requiring me to learn how to code in an afternoon. 
There is no such button. This may be harder than I thought.

Out of desperation, I turn to the community. Apparently I'm a few days behind 
the curve; they've already extracted the text and solved the puzzle. As I look 
at the solution, my hope begins to melt. It really is mind-bogglingly obtuse.

Solution

The text which can be extracted from the image is split into three parts. The 
third is just a signature, proof that the image really does come from Cicada 
and that it hasn't been tampered with. But above it is the next step of the 
puzzle.

The first part reads like a poem: "The work of a private man/ who wished to 
transcend,/ He trusted himself, / to produce from within." That's followed by a 
series of numbers, separated by colons: "1:2:3:1/3:3:13:5/45:5:2:3," and so on, 
capped by the word ".onion". That last bit means that the solution, when found, 
will be the url to another website on Tor – following the pattern of the 
previous years.

So how is it solved? The numbers give a clue: the code probably involves a 
book. That format is a relatively well-known way of using a book as a key to a 
code. The first digit is the paragraph, the second is the sentence, the third 
is the word, and the fourth is the letter. But which book?

The answer is contained in the poem. Sort of. It's like the most frustrating 
cryptic crossword ever, with no conventions, no help as to length, and no way 
of checking whether you've got the right answer beyond seeing whether the url 
works.

The answer, apparently, is American author Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "
Self-Reliance <http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/self/self.pdf>". 
Here's the community's explanation as to why:

• Poem references transcendentalism

• Emerson is a noted transcendentalist author

• "he trusted himsef" refers to "trust thineself", which is a theme throughout 
Self-Reliance, as is producing from within

I do not think I would have got that on my own.

Community

There's only been one trustworthy piece of information as to who lies behind 
Cicada. It comes from an email, leaked by one of the 'winners' of the 2012 
challenge. It's impossible to verify fully, because the leaker was forced to 
remove the signature to keep their identity secret, but others who received the 
same email indicated that the contents were legitimate.

"You have all wondered who we are," it reads in part, "and so we shall now 
tell you. We are an international group. We have no name. We have no symbol. We 
have no membership rosters. We do not have a public website and we do not 
advertise ourselves. We are a group of individuals who have proven ourselves, 
much like you have, by completing this recruitment contest, and we are drawn 
together by common beliefs. A careful reading of the texts used in the contest 
would have revealed some of these beliefs: that tyranny and oppression of any 
kind must end, that censorship is wrong and that privacy is an inalienable 
right."

 Part of a Cicada puzzle. Photograph: /Cicada 3301 
It seems unbelievable, but the number of other possibilities is fast 
shrinking. At the end of the first Cicada, it was possible that the whole thing 
was a game, or publicity stunt. Before the launch of Halo 2, Microsoft did 
something similar, launching an "alternate reality game" called ILoveBees. But 
that game ran for just three months before it ended with an invitation to play 
the game; Cicada is now in its third year.

Similarly, the security services have been known to recruit through puzzles 
and games. But when GCHQ invited people to solve a code to get a job, they did 
so on a site plastered with their branding 
<http://grahamcluley.com/2013/09/gchq/>. And it beggars belief that they or the 
NSA would seriously start a hunt for spies on 4chan.

At the same time, Cicada must be the work of more than one person, with some 
hefty resources. So far, physical artefacts from the group have appeared in 8 
nations and 11 US states; it has bought phone numbers; paid for server up time; 
and offered something to the winners which has earned their silence.

Last chance

I decided to have one last try at solving a puzzle. To stave off the 
temptation to cheat, I would try and solve the most recent cypher, a 70 
character code reading "IDGTK UMLOO ARWOE RTHIS UTETL HUTIA TSLLO UIMNI TELNJ 
7TFYV OIUAU SNOCO 5JI4M EODZZ" which had been found by combining two previously 
discovered answers.

Eavesdropping on the chat channel, I see someone point out that the Enigma 
code was formatted in the same way. They link to an Engima simulator, and I 
give it a go. The most common version of the Enigma has a key of four letters, 
so there are a little less than half a million combinations.

After half an hour of trying ever four-letter phrase I can think of that 
Cicada may have picked, based on every previous clue, I give up and go to bed.

In the morning, when I check again, the puzzle has been solved. It involved 
putting the letters into 13 columns and shuffling the order around until a 
legible sentence appeared. The Enigma theory does not even warrant a mention.

The answer leads to another darkweb site, with another image, and more 
puzzles, which remain incomprehensible to me. When I leave the chatroom, they 
are discussing a large chunk of data found between two images on yet another 
darkweb site. I give up, and do the G2 crossword instead.
