A number of computers at a five-star Geneva hotel that has hosted sensitive 
talks, including Iranian nuclear negotiations, were found to be infected with 
malware used for espionage, Swiss prosecutors have revealed.

But the state prosecutor’s office, OAD, has had to close the case after 
failing to establish who was behind the cyber-attack, a spokesperson said.

The hotel, believed to be Hotel Président Wilson, which is famous for its 
1,680 sq metre presidential suite, was raided on 12 May last year after OAD had 
launched an investigation over suspicions of illegal intelligence services 
operating inSwitzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland>.

“Investigations revealed that a significant number of computers
[servers and clients] at a hotel in Geneva had been infected with a
form of malware,” the state prosecutor said in a statement on Thursday.

“This malware was developed for the purposes of espionage and is
basically used to gather data from the computers infected.”

André Marty, a spokesperson for the Swiss state prosecutor, told the Neue 
Zürcher Zeitung newspaper that investigations would be relaunched if new 
evidence emerged.

In Vienna, where the Iranian nuclear talks concluded in July 2015, the state 
prosecutor has launched two separate investigations into possible espionage. A 
spokesperson for the justice ministry told the Guardian that the two ongoing 
investigations were launched in June 2015 after bugging devices were discovered 
at Palais Coburg.

The long-running nuclear talks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-talks-timeline> 
were a magnet for the world’s intelligence agencies as they sought to find out 
more about the Iranian nuclear programme and the negotiating positions of the 
six nations involved.

When the talks shifted to a luxury hotel in Vienna, the microwave radiation 
from the surveillance efforts of competing intelligence agencies was so intense 
that diplomats had to walk some distance from the venue to use their mobile 
phones.

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, would take walks with his Iranian 
counterpart,Mohammad Javad Zarif 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/03/iran-nuclear-mohammad-javad-zarif>
, in what was seen as a publicity stunt, but which was also a practical means 
of dodging electronic bugs.

When diplomats attending talks in Lausanne

 wanted to call their capitals, they would stroll around the grounds of the 
venue, another five-star hotel, rather than call from their rooms.


The Israeli government, which strongly opposed the nuclear deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/netanyahu-hammond-spar-iran-nuclear-agreement>
, last year deniedaccusations of espionage 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/spy-virus-linked-to-israel-targeted-hotels-used-for-iran-nuclear-talks-1433937601>
 after a Moscow-based security firm said a computer virus believed to be used 
by Israeli spies was used to listen in on the talks.
