Adrian Newey <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adrian-newey> has mocked 
Formula One's new engine rules, with the Red Bull designer claiming they have 
produced slower cars without achieving the intended green goals. Speaking 
before Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Newey, who devised the cars that won Red 
Bull the past four drivers' championships, said the new 1.6 litre V6 
turbo-hybrid engines have increased costs and slowed down the cars for little 
benefit.

"The cost has gone up hugely to create this," Newey said. "If you put that 
cost into weight saving, you might be better off in many cases, so to 
automatically say that this is some huge benefit for mankind is taking a bit of 
a big leap.

"There is a relationship between cost, weight, aerodynamics, all sorts of 
factors, if you're going to go into road relevance. How you weigh that, how you 
proportion it, is impossible for an open-wheeled single-seater [car]. It's a 
very different beast."

The engines have been criticised for both creating a muted sound and for 
producing a processional style. "Formula One should be about excitement," Newey 
said. "It should be about man and machine performing at its maximum every 
single lap. OK, they're using 50 kilos less fuel [per race] but they're going a 
lot slower to achieve that."
