Below is this week’s playlist – the theme and tunes picked by a reader 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83825824> from the 
comments below inlast week’s callout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-with-unusual-rhymes#comments>
. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the format of the weekly Readers 
recommend series at the end of the piece.

I do enjoy a well-crafted rhyme. 

Many years ago as part of a school dissertation project I chose to wrestle 
with the confessional poetry ofRobert Lowell 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lowell>. Lines from a 1956 poem called To 
Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage have stayed with me:

Gored by the climacteric of his want,
 He stalls above me like an elephant

Powerful stuff. For more recent tales of wild animals and matters lustful 
however, observe this week’s first pick,Bill Bailey’s tribute to Billy Bragg, 
Unisex Chipshop

.

In my dreams I would see her
Running naked through the woods round Rainham
If I had some tigers I’d train ’em
To protect her

Next, someone else in a state of undress: The Naked Dutch Painter 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvLdOH1ZiRA&index=23&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 byStew. Of the recommendation Untergunther says 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83930093>: “Smart rhyming 
by this talented and witty wordsmith” and highlights the rhyming of fluorescent 
paint with a Mingus tape as a particular gem.

Oddly, nudity connects our starting trio, which culminates in Big Bang 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0p04CLd0gk&index=8&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 byBarenaked Ladies. Everyone with access to a telly will know the tune, but 
this verse might be less familiar:

Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating how we’re here, they’re catching deer (we’re catching viruses)
Religion or astronomy (Descartes or Deuteronomy)
It all started with the big bang! 

A novelty song perhaps, but one that accurately tells a particularly long 
story in a particularly short time.


MC Buggz is actually Andy Lima <http://va-mosquitoes.tripod.com/id1.html>, a 
mosquito control biologist from Virginia. He’s hit on a public information film 
with a difference. As well as “don’t get sick with Zika from the bite of a 
mosquit-a”, lyrical highlights fromZika 101 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dCI1JtqYss&index=14&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 include:

Beware of Aedes albopictus and aegypti,
these are some species you should care about most definitely


Now that’s poetry with a purpose.

Songs didn’t have to be packed with rhymes to make the list. Scythian Empire 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSBLSfhVSR0&index=37&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 byAndrew Bird earns a place on the strength of “Routed by Sarmatians, thwarted 
by the Thracians”; while the mere title ofHarry “The Hipster” Gibson’s daring 
1947 compositionWho Put the Benzedrine in Mrs Murphy’s Ovaltine 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2WJqnK3gAY&index=3&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 gets him the nod.

From the same era, the final song that Lorenz Hart wrote before his death in 
1943 wasTo Keep My Love Alive 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_H9yGF36Rc&index=22&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
.

I caught Sir James with his protectoress
The rector’s wife, I mean the rectoress
His heart stood still: angina pectoris
To keep my love alive

This version has the wonderful Elaine Stritch, who died in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/17/elaine-stritch>, giving a paean 
to pain (ouch) the performance it deserves.

Of course, unusual rhyming doesn’t always depend on intricate wordplay. 
Sometimes delivery is key. Asstevenjameshyde puts it 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83833559>, in Perfect 
Gentleman 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDwraXBUHgs&index=5&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
Wyclef Jean “has the audacity and skills to successfully rhyme elope with 
Mexico”. A great song, but be aware that some of the young ladies dancing in 
Jean’s video are almost dressed for Bailey’s Rainham Woods.

More sombre attire is appropriate if one intends to follow the advice of Tom 
Lehrer in Vatican Rag 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f72CTDe4-0&index=38&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
.

Get in line in that processional
Step into that small confessional
There the guy who’s got religion’ll
Tell you if your sin’s original

Barbryn’s nomination 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83831830> of Sapokanikan 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky9Ro9pP2gc&index=4&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 byJoanna Newsom references rhymes such as bevelled/levelled, grass her/master 
and parades/collonades – ticking all the topic boxes. It also matched 
Ozymandian with Sapokanikan and while that’s good, it perhaps doesn’t reach the 
rarefied heights ofDown Under 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s&index=35&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
 byMen at Work, who manage to rhyme “fried out Kombi” and “head full of zombie”.
Genius 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYFRzcgAM4w&index=10&list=PLW43ObHWrrOjPIrL0X4te29vaOdPgBAaT>
. Which brings us neatly to the final selection: I confess I chose this topic 
hoping that someone would nominate theWarren Zevon song of that name, and 
tincanman obliged <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83847220>
. My bias notwithstanding, it makes the cut on merit:

I’ve got a bitter pot of je ne sais quoi
Guess what, I’m stirring it with a monkey’s paw

For the avoidance of doubt, there was no behind the scenes collusion on this – 
tincanman was an unknowing accomplice. Or, as Zevon puts it, an “unindicted 
co-conspirator”. And in his hands, that rhymes with “doesn’t know for sure”…


Note: not all songs appear on this Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on 
the service.
