There are those that believe filming The Revenant was an exercise in endurance 
forLeonardo DiCaprio <https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio>, 
designed to show the Academy voters just how many gruesome things he’s prepared 
to endure to finally get his hands on that Oscar. But, if The Revenant is Oscar 
bait, it’s also baiting the Oscars. Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film is a 
pointed tribute to all of Leo’s most memorable acting work, slipped snugly into 
a single film like a man cocooned in a horse’s carcass. Look closely: you may 
begin to feel a creeping sense of déjà vu …

In The Revenant <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-revenant> we see Hugh 
Glass’s dying body on a raft that we hope will carry him to safety while he 
shivers helplessly. The one who loves him most pleads with anyone who will 
listen to keep him alive. When they are ripped apart, in a twist of fate colder 
than any winter, the poor guy ends up drifting through some beautifully framed 
shots in the icy water, alone and frozen.

Poor Glass (Leo) was unable to save his wife and children. So he takes shelter 
from the storm and decides to avenge their deaths. He commits to the cause no 
matter what the cost to his own sense of self. No amount of killing will bring 
his loved ones back.

Alone and cold, he becomes a lonely man who can take comfort only in his 
sleep. Fortunately, he can still visit his family in his haunting and vivid 
dreams, so we take comfort in the dream … or in the dream, within the dream, 
within the dream… within that other movie.

The Wolf of Wall Street 
 Leo crawls in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). 
 At risk of losing everything he has worked so hard for, all Glass has left is 
the will to survive. He’ll do whatever it takes. Which in this case is… crawl. 
Just like Jordan Belfort on Quaaludes, he must drag his resistant body once 
again towards his goal …

Glass faces isolation from his tribe after being exiled from the place and 
family he has travelled so far to find. Left for dead in the wilderness, 
fighting for survival and losing whatever is left of his mind. The paradox of 
the narrative, and possibly of winning an award too, being that once he finally 
makes his way to his people, he might come to see that it is just as lonely, if 
not more so, once you finally get on the inside...

Oscars 2016: the winners and losers on the campaign trail

The poor, marginalised guy has tried putting his faith in law enforcement 
before, but the further into it he delves the more he learns that any 
institution is always as corrupt as the people who run it. He can’t trust the 
law to keep him safe. Scorsese would be proud to see that Glass chooses to take 
matters (and a gun) into his own hands.

Exhausted from this emotional, intertextual and subliminal journey through 
Leo’s body of work, we sadly have very little room left to feel compassion for 
that poor bear who, judging by Glass’s coat and hat, may well have been on a 
revenge mission of her own.

If DiCaprio does win the Oscar, look out for the knowing look he and Iñárritu 
give each other: he didn’t win it for this one performance. He won it for all 
of the ones before it. And if they pull it off… great. They will have created a 
beautifully shot, stunningly acted inter-textual tribute. A long montage of 
DiCaprio’s greatest hits that the academy voters have gobbled up like bison 
liver.
