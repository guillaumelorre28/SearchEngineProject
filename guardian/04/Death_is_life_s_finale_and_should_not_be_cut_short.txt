My aunt Ivy’s death earlier this year at the age of 94 was timely. Although 
fit and healthy, she had become bored with life in a residential home 
surrounded by people with dementia and Alzheimers.

When Alf, her husband of 60 years, had died 14 years previously, we thought 
she would swiftly follow. But Ivy had plenty of life in her yet. Until ...

The “until” began when the charitable home where my aunt had lived 
semi-independently in a house of 12 people, had to close and she was moved to a 
commercial home.

Initially called “residential”, it soon became dual-purpose, taking in a high 
proportion of dementia patients. Visiting Ivy each month, as I had done for 
years, I was struck by the change. Although the home was clean, with a nice 
garden and a dedicated young staff, I found it dispiriting.

As did Ivy. “You’re not taking me back there,” she said one day as we returned 
from one of our day trips to the coast.

She had never said this before. She had looked forward to returning to her 
former home and telling “the others” about our day. Here, there was nobody to 
tell.

The call to say Ivy was unconscious in hospital from a brain bleed following a 
fall was a shock for her other niece, Ruth, and I. But, knowing she would not 
want to linger on as a disabled person, we were glad when, after a few days, 
the hospital said there was little hope of recovery.

There was a problem, though. A doctor wanted to insert a feeding tube to 
prolong her life. And while there was “no resuscitation” written on Ivy’s 
notes, there was nothing about treatment of this kind.

Ruth, a former nurse, told him: “She wouldn’t want that.” Luckily, our wishes 
were granted and Ivy was allowed to fade away. She died 11 days later.

Our aunt’s life and death were an education for both of us. When Ruth and I 
spoke a few weeks after her funeral, we resolved to make clear our wishes for 
our own deaths. If seriously injured or incapacitated, neither of us wanted to 
be kept alive by unnecessary treatment or to linger on.

But how to achieve this? The present law doesn’t allow assisted deaths and 
Lord Falconer’s bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/18/assisted-dying-legalisation-debate-house-lords>
 to change this, if passed, would affect only a tiny number of people: those 
with a terminal illness, of sound mind and with less than six months to live.

And how to put in writing something that would tick all the boxes or, at 
least, most of them? When talking with a friend about not wishing to be kept 
alive if I had dementia or severe brain damage, she challenged me when I said I 
needed a good quality of life – and liked being useful.

“We can’t know these things in advance,” she said. “Being useful may not 
matter to you in years to come. The way we view dying and the later years of 
life only from a practical point of view misses something important.”

She made me think again. While I don’t want to be helpless, with someone else 
dressing and feeding me, what might I want – or feel – if these things came not 
to matter?

There’s a further issue for me. I live alone, have no children and no 
relatives nearby. My close friends travel a lot and can’t be relied upon to be 
around if needed.

How do I balance and make clear my wish not to have a miserable and protracted 
death with my friend’s observation that “good deaths matter” and a time of 
dying is an essential part of being alive. It’s life’s finale and if allowed to 
be peaceful, should not be cut short.

My search for an answer came from a charity called Compassion in Dying 
<http://www.compassionindying.org.uk/>. Set up to clarify the choices in end of 
life care and to help people make their wishes clear, they sent me a form 
called an advance decision.

It contains a small card to carry in a purse or wallet. In case of an accident 
or emergency, it gives the name of the person you’ve chosen as your advocate 
and/or your GP.

The process of filling it in has been salutary, for it’s clear how much I’ve 
been influenced by stories like that ofTony Nicklinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/tony-nicklinson>, the 58-year-old father of 
two, suffering from locked-in syndrome who battled for the legal right to die – 
and was refused. In fact, he died of pneumonia in August 2012, a week after his 
case had been turned down by the high court.

I felt that the blunt instrument of the law – in this case to hold the line 
against assisted suicide – had lacked compassion.

Sticking to rules when people are vulnerable, notably at the beginning and end 
of life, doesn’t always satisfy human needs. While I’m content that an advance 
decision does the business of protecting my wishes, I shall rely on my advocate 
for anything unforeseen, someone who knows me and whom I can trust to do their 
best to protect me.

Carol Lee’s latest book, Out of Winter

time she spent with her parents in the last two years of their lives.
