Beards are optional, we are told, among the developers at Stardotstar 
<http://stardotstar.com/home> - who were pretty chuffed when their app made it 
to number 21 in the UK App Store back in February, and felt it showed they had 
come up with a pretty useful tool to help drivers find secure, cheap nearby 
parking from 14,000 UK car parks.


They were less chuffed in April when they realised that the AA's parking app 
<http://en.parkopedia.co.uk/external/http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/aa-parking/id365260102?mt=8>
 used the name of their app - Nosey Parker - in its metadata, which meant the 
AA's developers had been hoping to intercept users searching for the Nosey 
Parker app. WhenAA President <http://twitter.com/aapresident> Edmund King found 
himself on the receiving end of some very disapproving twittering, he told 
@NoseyParkerApp to "Get a life 
<http://twitter.com/AAPresident/status/11534916176>." He later apologised 
<http://twitter.com/AAPresident/status/11582222606>.

Stardotstar replied quite politely but very publicly in an open letter 
<http://stardotstar.com/blog/letter-to-edmund-king-president-of-the-aa> on 
their site: "We understand that you would like a piece of our pie, but piggy 
backing on our app's success by using our brand name is not fair game."

Three days later, the AA app was replaced by one that didn't have Nosey 
Parker's name in its keywords. Parkopedia, who developed the official AA's 
parking app,apologised too <http://twitter.com/parkopedia/status/11586770442>. 
But developers - keep an eye out for those app store search techniques... 
things are getting nasty out there.

Do say: What a great idea for an app! 

Don't say: Imitation is the greatest form of flattery
