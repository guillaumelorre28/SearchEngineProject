Manchester United’s Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> could be out of action 
for five months as he recovers from a foot injury, according to reports.

The Ecuador winger had surgery on his foot this week following an injury 
sustained in last month’sgoalless Manchester derby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/25/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report>
.

United insist “no timescale has yet been placed on his return” after the 
30-year-old tweeted pictures of his leg in bandages from hospital on Tuesday 
evening and said he “came out well from the operation”.

A report in the Sun claims he damaged the bone above his left foot and may 
have caused further damage by playing on against City and not leaving the pitch 
immediately.

Valencia has not played since and did not reveal any targets for his comeback 
when tweeting after his surgery. Valencia has been converted from a winger to a 
right back under Louis van Gaal, and his lengthy absence limits the United 
manager’s defensive options.
