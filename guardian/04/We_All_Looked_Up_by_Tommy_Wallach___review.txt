The outcast, the slacker, the overachiever and the athlete. Before the 
asteroid, they stuck to their stereotypes, their labels. Before the asteroid, 
the athlete was stuck in a meaningless relationship while the slacker had never 
been in one. The outcast had a reputation for sleeping around while the 
overachiever barely had a reputation at all.

But that was before. Before news got around there was a 66.6% chance of Ardor 
hitting Earth. A 33.3% chance of survival.

With the odds stacked against them, they decide to leave their labels behind 
and go on a journey that can only be described as once in a lifetime. With 2 
months to live and the world at their fingertips they become something more, 
something they can be proud of. Even if it is the end of life as they know it.

Amazingly written and well thought out, Tommy Wallach manages to capture the 
panic, hopes and fears that most teenagers go through and re create it in these 
4 characters lives. This standalone book will have you up all night wondering 
what it really means to be alive.
