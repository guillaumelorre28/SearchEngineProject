Astana have taken to Twitter to post a clip of Leigh Griffiths’ clash with 
Igor Shitov that earned the Celtic striker a yellow card in Wednesday’s1-1 draw 
in Kazakhstan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/27/celtic-comeback-to-draw-1-1-with-fc-astana-in-champions-league-third-qualifying-round-first-leg-tie>
.

The tweet translates as “Griffiths punches Shitov in the match” and the 
footage shows the forward appearing to push the Belarus international defender 
to the ground inside the penalty box during the first leg of their Champions 
League third qualifying round tie at the Astana Arena.

The Italian referee Paolo Mazzoleni booked Griffiths, who scored two minutes 
later to equalise after the defender Yuri Logvinenko had scored.

Griffiths said: “There was a bit of handbags and one of their men went down. 
Both of us could have been booked to be honest. The ref could have let it go 
but I was the one who got booked. But I managed to silence the crowd a few 
minutes later so it worked out fine.”

Griffiths, has no doubt that Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will progress to the play-offs in 
next week’s second leg at Parkhead. “We got that away goal and now we’ll look 
to build on that next week. We’ll come out of the traps flying, and hopefully 
we will get that early goal and try to kill their confidence.

“The big man [Junior Kabananga] was a handful up front but I have no doubts 
about our defence next week and the way we set up and I think next week we’ll 
definitely finish the job off. We knew they would have a lot of pressure. They 
scored from a set piece, which was poor from our point of view, but we kept our 
heads down, kept working hard and deserved our away goal.”
