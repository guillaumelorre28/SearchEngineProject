Britain will create an education system that “segregates children into 
successes and failures” if Theresa May’s grammar school reforms are introduced,
Andy Burnham <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham> has said as he 
launched Labour’s campaign against the policy.

The candidate to become mayor of Manchester was joined by the shadow education 
secretary, Angela Rayner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jul/05/quick-guide-shadow-education-secretary-angela-rayner-teachers>
, and about 100 people in waving banners that read “Education not segregation”. 
They urged members of public to oppose selective schools as more than 300 
events were held across the country.

Last month, the prime minister unveiled her flagship policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools>
 of ending the ban on new selective schools, saying it had gone on too long and 
had been “sacrificing children’s potential”.

The government’s proposals have been strongly condemned by the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party as a “major strategic 
error”, and it hopes to use its vast new membership as an effective campaigning 
force against May’s plan.

The campaign launch had a “fantastic response”, according to Rayner. “I have 
been struck by the number of people who remember sitting the 11-plus and the 
lasting impact it had on their lives in later years,” she said. “There is 
overwhelming public support and now our campaign must reach out to those Tory 
MPs who understand that more grammar schools will not help social mobility and 
are divisive.

“The government should be addressing the problems they’ve created in our 
schools – soaring class sizes and more unqualified teachers – instead of 
looking backwards to bring back grammar schools, despite all the evidence 
showing they failed most children.”

Burnham added: “Grammar schools segregate very young children into successes 
and failures. We must oppose the government’s plans at every turn.”

There are currently about 163 grammar schools that select pupils by 
examination in England, out of about 3,000 state secondaries. There are further 
69 in Northern Ireland.

Under May’s plans, grammar schools would be allowed to expand and all schools 
in England would be given the right to apply to select pupils by ability.

A Department for Education spokesperson said on Saturday afternoon: “Grammar 
schools provide stretching education for the most academically able, regardless 
of their background, and help to eliminate the attainment gap between 
disadvantaged pupils and their peers.

“Our new proposals are not about recreating the binary system of the past, but 
instead will make grammar schools engines of academic and social achievement 
for all pupils. We will ensure that any new selective schools prioritise the 
admission of pupils from lower income households or support other local pupils 
in non-selective schools to help raise standards.

 “This is about providing a good school place for every child, one that caters 
to their individual talents, abilities and needs. We would urge everyone to 
look at the detail in the consultation and join that debate.”
