Julie Andrews plans to channel the spirit of her original Broadway director 
when she recreatesMy Fair Lady <https://www.theguardian.com/film/my-fair-lady>, 
the show that made her a star, for the Sydney stage.


The Oscar-winning actor appeared at the Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> Opera House, where her much 
anticipated revival of the classic Lerner and Loewe musical will open at the 
Joan Sutherland theatre in August 2016, “recreating the landmark 1956 
production in its entirety”, said producers.

“My memories are huge,” said Andrews of the original production. “I eventually 
played Eliza for just about three-and-a-half years, eight performances a week – 
including two years in Broadway, 11 months in London – so I think I got to know 
it rather well.”

Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe’s musical retelling of George Bernard 
Shaw’s Pygmalion stormed New York in 1956, where a young Andrews played its 
charming cockney heroine Eliza Doolittle – a Covent Garden flower girl made 
good.

“I was very young and green and inexperienced at the time,” said Andrews of 
what was only her second Broadway role after The Boyfriend. “I knew and felt 
that I understood Eliza but I needed to be guided.”

By the time the curtain came up at the Mark Hellinger theatre on opening 
night, director Moss Hart had made her into a “prize fighter”, she said. 
Andrews hoped to do the same for her Australian cast.

This 60th anniversary production was first announced in August as part of 
Opera Australia’s programming to mark its own 60th birthday, “a fantastic 
synergy” that chief executive Lyndon Terracini said was “irresistible”. My Fair 
Lady was “the first event musical” said co-producer John Frost, adding that it 
“turned musicals upside down and inside out”.

Andrews had been auditioning local performers in Sydney for the past week and 
said the process of picking her Eliza could not be rushed.

“She is for any actress one of the most daunting roles,” said Andrews, adding 
that in voice alone, Eliza has to go from cockney screaming rage to pure 
soprano singing. “She was desperately poor but she was bright and had ambition 
and guts. She transcended herself,” she added of the character.

Celebrated for her Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated screen turns in Mary 
Poppins and The Sound of Music, Andrews was overlooked for the part of Eliza in 
the 1964 film of My Fair Ladyin favour of Audrey Hepburn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/my-fair-lady-audrey-hepburn-archive-1964>
, whose singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon for much of the film.

The stage version of the musical has been revived every decade, with Cameron 
Mackintosh’s 2001 production at the NationalTheatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> in London, directed by Trevor Nunn 
with choreography by Matthew Bourne – a particular hit.

Tony award-winning Christopher Gattelli has already been announced as 
choreographer for the Sydney production, with Guy Simpson as musical director.

But the real stars of the show are likely to be the costumes and sets, 
recreated for the Opera House stage from Cecil Beaton and Oliver Smith’s 
original designs.

“Hours were spent trawling over drawings, costumes and set designs in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum and Arts Centre Melbourne Performing Arts Collection 
to name just a few,” the producers said. The bigger challenge was tracking down 
what remained of the original creative team and cast.

“Julie Andrews is the last living strand of DNA from the original production 
of My Fair Lady,” said Terrancini. “I’m thrilled that Broadway’s original Eliza 
Doolittle will direct our new production at the Sydney Opera House 60 years 
later.”

Opera Australia’s annual musical production is increasingly important to the 
company, with Anything Goes and The King and I proving popular with audiences 
in Sydney and Melbourne. My Fair Lady was already selling as well as the 
top-ranking opera in the 2016 program, said chief executive Craig Hassall.

Andrews, who recently turned 80, lost her singing voice in 1997 when surgery 
to remove non-cancerous nodules from her vocal cords left them badly scarred.


Asked if it made her sad to hear songs she could no longer sing, she answered: 
“Strangely enough no. It’s been the most interesting experience ... giving me a 
deeper recognition, perhaps, of why I was chosen in the first place.”

“It’s not: ‘God I wish I could still do that.’ ... It’s not up to me any more.”
