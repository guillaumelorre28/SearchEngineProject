advent treats, from festive playlists to exclusive downloads. Which has to be 
better than a square of Kinnerton chocolate, right? To kick things offRobert

And dresses up as Santa. Here's what he had to say:


For me the magic of pop records arrived via jukeboxes in cafes. The music 
could fill the awkward silences among us clumsy and/or shy adolescents. I 
realised that pop records have to be short, and that anybody who thinks it must 
be easy to pack an instantly effective and memorable couple of minutes of music 
on to a record should try it themselves. I got my missus to help me out with 
two or three suggestions. Not saying which ones, though â€“ maybe you can guess? 
Or maybe not."


Robert Wyatt's collaboration with saxophonist/composer Gilad Atzmon and 
violinist/composer Ros Stephen, For the Ghosts Within, is out now.
