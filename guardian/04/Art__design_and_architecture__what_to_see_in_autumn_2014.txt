Designing the 20th Century: Life and Work of Abram Games 
<http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/abramgames>

“Maximum meaning, minimum means” was the motto of Abram Games, the Jewish 
graphic designer who produced more than 100 posters during the second world 
war. They still have the power to stir with their stark visual clarity. The 
exhibition charts his prolific output, from posters for London Transport to the 
branding for the Festival of Britain, as well as an elaborate kinetic mechanism 
for the first ever animated BBC ident. Becoming something of a garden-shed 
inventor in later life, he even turned his hand to designing a coffee maker and 
an early mechanical copying machine. Oliver Wainwright

Late Turner 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/ey-exhibition-late-turner-painting-set-free>

JMW Turner was a Romantic who lived into the Victorian age. He seemed like a 
monster, a crazed eccentric, even a reprobate to his respectable and repressed 
juniors. Old Turner’s ways – from painting poetic visions to being an unmarried 
man with a mistress – looked shocking to the staid eyes of the mid-19th 
century. Even his biggest Victorian fan, John Ruskin, would try to destroy his 
erotic art after his death. Yet modern eyes have seen a modern artist. Works 
that were dismissed as unfinished have been hailed as abstract masterpieces. 
Was Mark Rothko right to see a brother modernist in the man who painted such 
tentativemisty scenes as Norham Castle: Sunrise 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-norham-castle-sunrise-n01981>? 
Whether you see late Turner as an abstract artist or just a great painter full 
stop, this exhibition ought to be a dazzling encounter.Jonathan Jones Tate

Pierre Huyghe: In Border Deep 
<http://www.hauserwirth.com/exhibitions/2232/pierre-huyghe-br-in-br-border-br-deep/view/>

Huyghe’s art has developed in strange and beguiling ways since his Tate Modern 
retrospective in 2006. Nature and culture, society, animal and artistic 
behavior fuse in his site-specific objects, sculptures, aquariums and films. 
Huyghe’s art is a conundrum, and that is part of the pleasure of this inventive 
and thoughtful artist.Adrian Searle

Trisha Donnelly/Cerith Wyn Evans

Trisha Donnelly is an enigmatic artist. Once, she rode into a New York gallery 
on a white horse. It is unknown what she will do at the Serpentine, but her art 
is a mix of performance, video, music and sculpture. Wyn Evans occupies the 
Sackler Gallery with mechanical flutes, morse code, babbling texts and neon 
voices. Both artists bring a little magic back into the world.AS

Ming: Fifty Years that Changed China 
<http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ming.aspx>

The Ming dynasty came to power in China after an age of terror. The Mongol 
invasions had put foreign rulers on the throne and drove many intellectuals 
into seclusion and subtle dissidence. The Ming, in the period from 1400 to 1450 
that this blockbuster covers, restored Chinese culture yet also opened it to 
the outside world.This was the age when Admiral Zheng led a fleet as far as 
east Africa <http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0507/feature2/>, in 
pre-modern China’s greatest feat of exploration. The resulting cultural contact 
enriched and inspired an artistic golden age.“Ming” is still synonymous with 
superbly crafted works of staggering beauty.JJ

Constable: The Making of a Master 
<http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-constable-the-making-of-a-master/>

Whether focusing on clouds over Hampstead or the rotted stumps in a Suffolk 
river, Constable was a great observationist. As much as Turner, he could 
capture a fleeting moment, the texture and atmosphere of time and place. Hugely 
indebted to Claude, Ruisdael, Rubens and other artists whom he copied, 
Constable also went beyond them.AS

Anselm Kiefer <https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/anselm-kiefer>

German artist Anselm Kiefer’s paintings, sculptures and installations look 
like messages from the end of the world. From early, delicate watercolours to 
his cycles of despoiled paintings, this retrospective gives full measure to 
Kiefer’s preoccupations with German history, the holocaust, mythology and the 
wretchedness of our age.AS
Royal Academy <http://royalacademy.org.uk>, London W1, from 27 September.

Turner prize 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2014>

Is it still as much fun as it was when people argued about unmade beds back in 
the day? Or has it now become a boringly respectable institution? Make up your 
mind as this year’s contenders Duncan Campbell, Ciara Phillips, James Richards 
and Tris Vonna-Michell enter the arena bloodied by so many young British 
artists before them.JJ

Ai Weiwei at Blenheim Palace 
<http://www.blenheimpalace.com/whats-on/exhibitions/ai-weiwei-at-blenheim-palace.html>

Unable to leave his Beijing studio, Ai Weiwei has used laser models of John 
Vanburgh’s 1705 stately pile to help him create the largest exhibition of his 
work in the UK to date. As much a survey of his troubled and controversial 
career, this first exhibition of contemporary art at Blenheim is a startling 
collision of cultures. Who knows what the country house crowd will make of the 
invading horde of over 2,300 ceramic river crabs?AS

Gerhard Richter <http://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/gerhard-richter/>

This autumn sees a standoff between two definitive painters of our time. While 
Anselm Kiefer is at the Royal Academy, his German contemporary Richter opens 
London’s new Marian Goodman Gallery. Where Kiefer lays on thick impasto laden 
with found stuff, Richter is smooth-skinned and glassily photographic. He seeks 
to efface the histrionic, romantic figure of the artist, all feeling and ego, 
from his observations of a world flicking by in a stream of media. A cool, 
stylish and utterly honest painter of the modern world.JJ
Marian Goodman Gallery <http://mariangoodman.com>, London W1, from 14 October.

Alibis: Sigmar Polke 1963-2010 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/alibis-sigmar-polke-1963-2010>

Following two earlier major Sigmar Polke shows, at Tate Liverpool in 1996 and 
Tate Modern in 2005, this extensive retrospective aims to show the German 
painter, film-maker and sculptor in full. A founder, with Gerhard Richter, of 
capitalist realism (a rejoinder to British and American pop art) in the 1960s), 
Polke went on to make an enormous variety of hallucinatory, poisonous, gorgeous 
and unsettling works that still reverberate with a strange, dark humour. Polke 
took painting to places it had never been, both in terms of imagery (quoting 
Goya, John Tenniel’s illustrations to Lewis Carroll, medieval manuscript 
illustrations, images of concentration camp watchtowers and the patterns on a 
tea-towel) and technical innovation (he painted with poisons, soot and much 
besides). He was possessed of a demonic skepticism and playfulness. The more 
time goes on, the more his art resonates.AS

Glenn Ligon – Call and Response 
<http://www.camdenartscentre.org/whats-on/view/ligon>

Often using words as image, Ligon’s stencilled paintings, neons and films 
detail the experience of black America. Holding a mirror up to power, his work 
can be at once insistent, angry and eloquent. Richard Pryor’s scatological 
comedy, the testimonies of black youths arrested for murder in the 1964 Harlem 
race riot, the work of composer Steve Reich and the manners of high modernist 
American abstraction all are in the mix in this long-overdue survey.AS

Mirrorcity looks like being one of the Hayward’s better group shows, bringing 
together artists including Tim Etchells, Helen Marten, Laure Prouvost, Susan 
Hiller, John Stezaker and Lindsay Seers. There will be lots to argue about in 
terms of how the artists navigate the real in a digital age, and the nefarious 
ways in which one can be an artist today.AS

America is the land of big money, big cities, big people and big attitude. So 
how did it invent minimalism? And no one is more modest, evasive and gentle 
than Richard Tuttle and his lightly placed objects. It’s tempting to say he’s 
going to have a big autumn.JJ

Rembrandt: The Late Works 
<http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/rembrandt-the-late-works>

Forty paintings, 20 drawings and 30 prints by one artist doesn’t sound a lot, 
but when the person is Rembrandt and the focus is on the last two decades of 
his life, expect something magisterial. Like Titian, Rembrandt’s style towards 
the end of his life became more frank: he was unconcerned with the kind of 
painterly decorum and detail expected by his patrons. The result was churned-up 
surfaces, harsh lighting and dramatic settings. Nowhere is this clearer than in 
his drawings and etchings. And when we look at Rembrandt looking at himself, in 
his late self-portraits, we get the feeling that he doesn’t care what we think. 
Which is exactly what makes us care.AS

Egon Schiele: The Radical Nude 
<http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/exhibitions/2014/Schiele/index.shtml>

Egon Schiele was not an abstract artist, but rather an old-fashioned student 
of the human figure. He just looked and drew , but the women he looked at and 
the ways he showed them set art alight. This is some of the most incendiary art 
of the 20th century in this encounter with Schiele’s erotic portraits. “Radical 
nude” may be a bit polite, pornography taken to the heights of genius.JJ

Giovanni Battista Moroni <http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/29>

The introspective and tender portraits of this Italian Renaissance painter are 
disconcerting and beguiling. His great portrait of a tailor cutting cloth, for 
instance, is both a rare image of a 16th-century worker and a great portrait of 
male gentleness. What is the friendship between artist and model? This and 
other masterpieces by Moroni’s masterpieces destroybreak down the formality of 
art as he elicits a compassionate meeting of gazes across time. These are 
ghosts you can love.JJ

Transmitting Andy Warhol 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/transmitting-andy-warhol>

Andy Warhol haunts our age like a ghost image flickering in cyberspace. The 
prophet of 15-minute fame, selfies (he took them in a photobooth), shared 
photographs (his silkscreen process is a hymn to reproduction) and even – as 
the recent rediscovery of his Amiga computer experiments reveals – of digital 
art, wrote the programme for the 21st century. Warhol’s first solo exhibition 
in the north of England homes in on the most revolutionary aspects of his 
enterprise: how he turned art into a form of mass communication, open to media 
and marketplace. Yet, with Warhol, you look at a frozen image of Marilyn Monroe 
or a screen test of Bob Dylan, and a sudden, unexpected blast of emotion and 
truth knocks you sideways. He is a great artist and a prescient one.JJ
