will take charge of the cameras.

Fuqua confirmed the news in interviews at the Toronto film festival

1980s US TV series that inspired the modern remake.

Fuqua told Variety he was delighted to be working with Washington on a third 
project. “Denzel’s all about the work,” he said. “He’s all about the acting. 
He’s an actor. He’ll tell you himself, ‘I’m not a movie star, celebrity, 
something else, I’m an actor.’ He steps on a set that’s what he is and that’s 
what he gives you. He gives his heart.”

Cruise was previously attached to the new version of The Magnificent Seven, 
itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 Japanese taleSeven Samurai

raiding bandits.
