The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Audiard's brilliant 2005 film, was the study 
of a Parisian delinquent whose past is prised open to reveal a delicate, 
artistic sensibility at odds with his criminal lifestyle. In this, Audiard's 
2009 follow-up, Malik (the young protagonist, played by Tahar Rahim) is neither 
a hardened criminal (though he is imprisoned at the start), nor does he seem to 
harbour any secrets in his past, artistic or otherwise. When he is committed to 
brutal French prison, he is a blank slate waiting to be filled.

Malik is not without talents: in fact, he turns out to be supremely capable. 
His advantage is the fact that he is a middle-man in every respect, 
belonging neither to the gang of Corsican hoods who adopt him as a gofer, nor 
the Muslim brotherhood who, given his north-African origins, expect his 
allegiance. What ensues is both thrilling and – in its cold indictment of the 
French prison system – terrifying. The plot is intricate and tightly wound, and 
Audiard exerts formidable control over every frame so that two and a half hours 
flash by in an instant. The nightmarish assassination scene will make you wince 
every time you roll your tongue.
