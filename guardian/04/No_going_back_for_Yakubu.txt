Portsmouth striker Aiyegbeni Yakubu will not return to the African Nations Cup 
despite Nigeria's change of heart.

Yakubu was sent home from the tournament last week along with Chelsea's 
Celestine Babayaro and Victor Agali of German club Schalke for reportedly 
breaking the squad's curfew.

He appeared as a second-half substitute in the goalless draw with Wolves at 
Fratton Park and has now apparently decided to stick with his club, despite 
Nigeria's decision to invite him back.

"Yakubu feels it is a great honour to play for his country and was greatly 
excited by the prospect of playing for them in this tournament," said 
Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie.

"However the way he was sent home and the stories which were then given to the 
world media by the Nigerian FA have left him extremely sad.

"He and the other two players were doing no more than enjoying a quiet coffee 
within the confines of the club headquarters and because of the false stories 
which have come out he has been the centre of media attention for entirely 
wrong and unjustified reasons.

"The player would like the Nigerian fans to understand his position and says 
that he loves his country with all his heart but has been placed in a 
impossible situation and can't contemplate returning."
