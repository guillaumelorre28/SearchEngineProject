Northern Ireland’s first and deputy first ministers have issued a joint plea 
for a peaceful marching season in the region.

The Democratic Unionist leader, Arlene Foster, joined Sinn Féin’s Martin 
McGuinness <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness> in calling 
for peace on the streets before 12 July, the climax of Orange Order parades 
across the province.

Foster and McGuinnes were joined by the justice minister, Claire Sugden, an 
independent unionist, in urging those involved in marches and nationalists 
protesting against them to “conduct themselves in a dignified and lawful way”.

The three ministers in the power-sharing executive in Belfast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> said: “As we move into a period which 
has in the past resulted in heightened tensions, we encourage everyone to 
conduct themselves in a dignified and lawful way.

“We all have a responsibility to show leadership and to continue to seek 
resolutions to contentious issues through discussion, and ensure any 
difficulties are identified and resolved peacefully, thus showing respect for 
the views and wishes of everyone in the community.”

Although the vast majority of Orange Order parades pass off peacefully,this 
week the focus will be on a banned march close to the Ardoyne shops in North 
Belfast. Orange Order members and their supporters are banned from returning 
home via theCrumlin Road

 on 12 July from the main demonstration in Belfast.

This has led to riots and street disorder involving loyalists protesting 
against the ban, republicans gathered at Ardoyne and the police. No resolution 
has yet been reached to broker a deal between Ardoyne residents and the 
Orangemen from north Belfast.
