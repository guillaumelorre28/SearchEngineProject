Frédéric Kanouté has retired from international football following Mali's exit 
from theAfrica Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> on Monday. The Sevilla 
striker, who scored 23 international goals in 38 appearances since his debut in 
2004, confirmed his decision after Mali beat Malawi 3-1, a victory that was 
meaningless as the Eagles bowed out of the competition.

"That's life," he said. "I'm sorry I couldn't succeed in helping my team go 
further at the Nations Cup, which now marks my retirement."

The 32-year-old former West Ham and Tottenham striker scored twice in Angola – 
in the 4-4 draw against the hosts in the opening game and in the win over 
Malawi – and was already back in Spain with his club late last night.

Kanouté, who resumed training with Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> today, added: "I can't find the 
words to describe how upset I am, it really hurts me. After we were knocked out 
in 2008 we really wanted to do well here.

"For my last appearance in this competition I wanted to go as far as possible. 
We will now take stock of our team."
