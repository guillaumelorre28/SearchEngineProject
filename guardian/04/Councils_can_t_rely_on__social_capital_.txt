The word here in Suffolk is of cuts in spending of up to a third over the next 
few years. Yes, that's 33%. Very soon, we'll be looking at a very different 
local authority, delivering less – its role no longer about "doing things" but 
about making sure they are done.

But just how will this gap between budgets and aspirations be bridged? 
The buzz-phrase is "social capital" – community self-help, mutual support and 
voluntarism. This is the headline strategy, and there's even a new cabinet 
portfolio in its name.

Sounds great. Yet can we generate enough of this "social capital" in the 
digital, dissociative 2010s? Nobody truly knows, but a sensible guess is that 
it will be no magic bullet, especially in areas where people don't even look at 
each other in the street, never mind help old ladies across the road.

So, expect tried and tested stuff: a pay and recruitment freeze; a mass 
sacking of expensive council employees; and outsourcing of traditional local 
authority mainstays such as schools, care management and children's services.

Enter, the third sector. People, quite rightly, don't trust the private 
megacorps to organise education and care. Their track record is patchy. By 
contrast, charities and social businesses are trusted, have the right cost 
base, and draw in community effort. It will all be very brutal, but there might 
be something better – and more financially sustainable – at the end.
