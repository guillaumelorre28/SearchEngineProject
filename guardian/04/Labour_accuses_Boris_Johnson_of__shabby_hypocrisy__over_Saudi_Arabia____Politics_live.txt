Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: 
The transport secretary said that cost was the reason for overruling the plan 
for Transport for London to take over suburban rail services around London. We 
now know that’s not true because, in a letter to London mayorBoris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> in April 2013, he admitted he did 
not want a future Labour mayor of London to run trains into and out of the 
capital ... If he won’t do the decent thing and resign Theresa May should sack 
him.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

David Cameron has been watching basketball with George W Bush, he reveals on 
Twitter. It would be nice to think that they had a learned debate about the 
relative catastrophe rankings of Brexit versus the Iraq war, but one suspects 
that the conversation didn’t quite pan out like that ...

Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has said today’s NHS waiting 
time figures (see2.59pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3#block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3>
 are “shocking”. He said:

These shocking figures present a bleak outlook for the coming winter months. 
Delayed discharges are at their highest level since 2010 and this is having a 
severe knock on effect on overwhelmed A&E departments.

Patients are being forced to wait too long in A&E departments, and thousands 
are being left stranded on trolleys waiting for beds to become available on 
overcrowded hospital wards.

Shamefully, the Tories failed to provide any extra investment for social care 
in the autumn statement last month. Patients deserve better than this, and with 
the busy Christmas period approaching,Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is urging the government to take 
immediate action to protect our NHS.

This is what the department for transport is saying in response to the call 
from Conservative MP Bob Neill for Chris Grayling to resign. Neill is angry 
aboutGrayling’s decision to scrap plans to transfer control of London rail 
services to Transport for London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/transport-for-london-plans-ditched-chris-grayling-sadiq-khan>
 and thinks a leaked letter shows Graying may have misled MPs about the reasons 
for his decision. (See 1.55pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-584954c0e4b08659393ba2e5#block-584954c0e4b08659393ba2e5>
In response, a spokesman for the department said:

The mayor’s business plan for the South Eastern franchise did not provide more 
frequent trains, it provided no extra capacity in peak hours, and it promised 
infrastructure improvements with no funding identified. These would come at a 
cost to Londoners or mean re-prioritising other travel schemes in the capital.

MPs and councillors had raised concerns about the mayor being given control 
over services for people who could not vote for the mayor.

We can deliver services improvements through partnership, without the need for 
a massive reorganisation and splitting the franchise.

Here is Matthew Swindells, NHS England’s national director of operations and 
information, on today’s waiting figures. (See 2.49pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3#block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3>

These figures suggest A&E attendances are increasing rather faster than the 
growth in the number of major “accidents” and medical “emergencies”, putting 
great strain on A&E departments.

Going into the busy winter period, it is important people remember the first 
port of call for minor conditions or non-emergency medical care should be the 
local chemist, the 111 helpline, or their GP practice.

As well as pressures at the hospital ‘front door’, this month’s figures show a 
41% increase in delays in being able to discharge inpatients as a result of 
unavailability of social care, the highest figure ever.

Going into the holiday period, it is vital local councils, community health 
services and hospitals work closely to enable older patients to get the support 
they need after a hospital stay, back at home.

NHS England figures show delayed discharges at a record high

Today’s NHS England waiting time figures (pdf) 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/Monthly-performance-statistics-summary-2016-Oct-16-FINAL.pdf>
 show the health service continues to struggle, the Press Association reports.

Just 89% of patients were dealt with in A&E within four hours in October, 
against a target of 95%. The total number of A&E attendances was up 4% compared 
with the same period last year.

Other targets were also missed, including for patients to start treatment led 
by a consultant within 18 weeks, and cancer patients to start their first 
treatment within 62 days of urgent GP referral.

Delayed discharges are also the highest on record. This is when patients are 
medically fit to leave hospital but are unable to do so because social care 
packages or other care is not in place in the community.

The proportion of calls abandoned by people seeking help from the 111 helpline 
has also risen to 2.4% of calls in October, up from 1.5% in September.

Ambulance trusts across England also continue to miss targets for responding 
to life-threatening calls.

More tests to diagnose conditions were performed, although the proportion of 
patients waiting six weeks or more for results has risen slightly.

Michelle Thomson tells Commons of how she was raped aged 14 during debate on 
violence against women

MPs are holding a debate to mark UN international day for the elimination of 
violence against women and in her speechMichelle Thomson told of how she was 
raped at the age of 14. “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor,” she said. 

Describing what happened she said:

When I was 14 I was raped. As is common, it was by somebody who was known to 
me. He had offered to walk me home from a youth event and in those days 
everybody walked everywhere, it was quite common to do that.

It was early evening, it wasn’t dark. I was wearing - I’m imagining, I’m 
guessing - jeans and a sweatshirt.

I didn’t think anything of it [when he took her a slightly different route.] 
He told me he wanted to show me something in a wooded area and at that point, I 
must admit, I was alarmed. I did have a warning bell - but I overrode that 
warning bell because I knew him and therefore there was a level of trust in 
place.

To be honest, looking back, at that point I don’t think I knew what rape was. 
It was not something that was talked about.”

It was mercifully quick and I remember first of all feeling surprise, then 
fear, then horror as I realised I quite simply couldn’t escape - because he was 
stronger than me, and there was no sense even initially of any sexual desire 
from him, which I suppose, looking back, again I find odd.

Thomson said that she did not tell her parents and that she felt “ashamed” of 
what had happened.

I didn’t tell my mother, I didn’t tell my father, I didn’t tell my friends and 
I didn’t tell the police. I bottled it all up inside me. I hoped, briefly and 
appallingly, that I might be pregnant so that would force a situation to help 
me control it ...

I felt I was spoiled and impure and really felt revulsion towards myself. I, 
of course, then detached from the child up to then I had been. Although, in 
reality, at the age of 14 it was probably the start of my sexual awakening, at 
that time, remembering back, sex was something that men did to women and 
perhaps this incident reinforced that early belief.

She said she later told a school boyfriend who was “supportive”.

But I couldn’t make sense of my response and it is my response which gives 
weight to the event. I carried that guilt, anger, fear, sadness and bitterness 
for years.

When I got married 12 years later I felt I had a duty to tell my husband. I 
wanted him to understand why there was this swaddled kernel of extreme emotion 
at the very heart of me that I knew he could sense, but for many years I simply 
could not say the words without crying.

It was only in my mid-40s that I took some steps to go and get help with it.

Thomson said that although she had been happily married for 25 years, the rape 
had “fatally undermined” her self-esteem, confidence and sense of self-worth.

She said that she now knew rape was not about sex, but about power and 
control. And she questioned myths about rape perpetuated from a male 
perspective.

These assumptions put the woman at the heart of cause, when she should be at 
the heart of effect.

A rape happens when a man makes a decision to hurt someone he feels he can 
control. Rapes happen because of the rapist, not because of the victim.

We women and our society have to stand up for each other, we have to be 
courageous, we have to call things out and say where things are wrong. We have 
to support and nurture our sisters as we do with our sons.

She concluded:

One thing I realise now is I’m not scared and he was. I’m not scared, I’m not 
a victim, I’m a survivor.

At the end Bercow thanked her for her speech, saying it had “left an indelible 
impression on us all”.

Lunchtime summary

 * Boris Johnson was not representing the government’s views on Saudi Arabia 
when he accused the state of abusing Islam and acting as a puppeteer in proxy 
wars, Downing Street has said. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/08/boris-johnsons-remarks-about-saudi-arabia-not-the-governments-view>
 * The Commons home affairs committee of MPs has announced a new and 
far-reaching inquiry into the public’s view on immigration in the wake of 
Brexit, in which members will tour the country to seek views directly from the 
people affected. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/08/mps-launch-inquiry-seeking-public-views-on-immigration>
 * The head of the British intelligence agency MI6, Alex Younger, has said 
that cyber-attacks, propaganda and subversion from hostile states pose a 
“fundamental threat” to European democracies, including the UK. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/08/hostile-states-pose-fundamental-threat-to-europe-says-mi6-chief>
 AsEwen MacAskill reports, younger, in a rare speech by an MI6 chief while in 
office, did not specifically name Russia but left no doubt that this was the 
target of his remarks.Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> is 
being blamed for interfering in the US presidential election and there are 
concerns it could do the same in French and German elections next year.He did 
specifically name Russia in relation to Syria, portraying Russian military 
support for the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad, in the takeover of Aleppo 
and elsewhere as potentially creating a long-term problem that could increase 
radicalisation. 
 * Spencer Livermore, who was Labour’s general election campaign director in 
2015, has accused Labour figures who favour curbs on EU migration of promoting 
a “dangerous fantasy”.Livermore did not name any individuals in his article for 
Progress Online, but his article came out after Andy Burnham gave a speech in 
the Commons yesterday claiming that theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party’s failure to grasp the need 
for migration controls was putting people at risk. (See 9.13am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849196de4b06a0d55b18c72#block-5849196de4b06a0d55b18c72>
Livermore said that staying in the single market should take precedence over 
ending free movement for EU workers. He said: 
During the referendum campaign, the Labour party made it clear that 
simultaneously having cake and eating it was merely anotherBoris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> fantasy. Yet now, I regret to say, 
there are leading figures in our own party who are willing to collude in this 
fantasy. People who should – and I suspect do – know better, have become 
complicit in creating a fiction that our economy can remain within the single 
market, while at the same time cutting immigration and ending freedom of 
movement.

This is an extremely dangerous fantasy, and at some point in the next two 
years, this collective denial will collide with reality. As every European 
leader has made clear, this is not a deal that will ever be on offer. There 
will be no United Kingdom membership of the single market without freedom of 
movement. So as a nation we will have to make a stark choice: do we end freedom 
of movement or do we stay in the single market ...

Of course beating Ukip is a priority, but we need to ask whether conceding the 
argument that immigration is the underlying cause of every problem facing 
voters inLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> constituencies 
will in the end hurt or help Ukip – the party with the biggest lead on this 
issue.

It should be clear what would actually happen if we followed this path. Out of 
the single market, the British people will be poorer. But we will have left the 
EU, and freedom of movement will have been ended, so the Tory Government and a 
ferociously partisan tabloid media – desperate to avoid responsibility 
themselves – will need to find someone else to blame for the nation’s economic 
malaise.

 * An MP has moved colleagues to tears after revealing she was raped at 14, 
telling the Commons: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.”Michelle Thomson, MP 
for Edinburgh West, who sits as an independent after being suspended by the 
SNP, shared her personal story during a Commons debate focused on UN 
international day for the elimination of violence against women. I will post 
extracts from her speech on a new post shortly. 
 * Bob Neill, the Conservative MP for Bromley and Chislehurst and chair of the 
Commons justice committee, has called for Chris Grayling’s resignation as 
transport secretary.Neill is angry about Grayling’s decision to scrap plans to 
transfer control of London rail services to Transport for London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/transport-for-london-plans-ditched-chris-grayling-sadiq-khan>
 and,in an article for PoliticsHome, 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/transport/rail-transport/opinion/house-commons/81536/bob-neill-mp-chris-grayling-has-misled>
 he says that a letter revealing Grayling was opposed to giving these powers to 
a Labour mayor suggests Grayling “misled” MPs when he explained his decision to 
MPs. 
 * Labour MPs have criticised Conservative party HQ for using Twitter to 
attack specific Labour colleagues, with tweet claiming the fact that they did 
not back the government last night meant they were refusing to respect the 
referendum result. As PoliticsHome reports, 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/81551/excl-labour-mps-accuse-tories-cyber-terrorism>
 at least one of those targeted did not vote because he was abroad, and Labour 
have pointed out that Theresa May did not vote in the division either. 
 * The UK parliament can change the laws of Scotland regarding Brexit - but 
not the UK government using royal prerogative powers, Scotland’s most senior 
law officer has told the supreme court. As the Press Association reports, Lord 
Advocate James Wolffe QC argued that an act of parliament was required to 
trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty to start the two-year process of 
withdrawing from the EU. And he said the Scottish parliament was also entitled 
to a voice on the issue, which involved the serious loss of EU rights for 
Scottish people. There is more on our supreme court live blog.

Downing Street has released pictures of Theresa May’s Christmas cards. All 
three pictures have been drawn by children from her constituency.

Some people will get this one.

The Lib Dems are also accusing Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> of hypocrisy over Saudi Arabia. 
This is from Tom Brake, the party’s foreign affairs spokesman.

For once Boris Johnson is talking sense, but his comments on Saudi’s 
questionable role in Middle Eastern politics are completely at odds with 
official government policy.

This will be a huge embarrassment to May as she returns from her grubby tour 
of the Gulf, where she did her best to ignore human rights and desperately push 
trade at all costs.

The Conservative government rightly condemned Fidel Castro for his human 
rights record, but have fallen completely silent when it comes to the appalling 
record of countries they have been cosying up to in the Middle East.

The hypocrisy is astounding.

Labour accuses Boris Johnson of 'shabby hypocrisy' over Saudi Arabia

And here’s Emily Thornberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/emily-thornberry>, the shadow foreign 
secretary, commenting on Boris Johnson’s Saudi intervention. She is accusing 
him of “shabby hypocrisy”.

For months, Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has been 
arguing that what last year began as a UN-backed attempt to restore the 
government of Yemen has now descended into a brutal and indiscriminate proxy 
war, and a desperate humanitarian crisis, with the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of children at risk.

That argument has consistently been rejected by Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> in the House of Commons, but now 
these remarks in Italy have shown us what he really thinks.

If that is his genuine view, he needs to explain why he ordered his MPs to 
vote against Labour’s calls in October to suspend support for the Saudi-led 
coalition in Yemen, until a lasting ceasefire has been brokered and until 
alleged violations of international humanitarian law have been properly 
investigated.

The government cannot complain about Saudi Arabia’s military actions one 
minute, then continue selling it the arms to prosecute those actions the next. 
We need to see some consistent principle in the UK’s foreign policy, not more 
shabby hypocrisy.

No 10 slaps down Boris Johnson, saying his Saudia Arabia comments not 
government policy

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been slapped down by Downing Street over 
his claim,reported in today’s Guardian splash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/boris-johnson-accuses-saudi-arabia-of-twisting-and-abusing-islam>
, that Saudi Arabia has been “playing proxy wars” in the Middle East, the Press 
Association reports.

Theresa May’s official spokeswoman said the prime minister had “full 
confidence” in Johnson but told reporters that his comments at a conference in 
Italy were his own personal view and did not reflect government policy.

And she pointedly noted that Johnson will have the opportunity to set out 
official policy - of Britain’s desire to strengthen its ties with Saudi Arabia 
and support for its military involvement in Yemen - when he travels to the 
desert kingdom for talks on Sunday.

May spoke with King Salman during her visit to the Persian Gulf this week, 
when he was able to hear the PM assure him of “her commitment and that of her 
government to enhancing and strengthening this relationship”, said the 
spokeswoman.

Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has said today’s NHS waiting 
time figures (see2.59pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3#block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3>
 are “shocking”. He said:

These shocking figures present a bleak outlook for the coming winter months. 
Delayed discharges are at their highest level since 2010 and this is having a 
severe knock on effect on overwhelmed A&E departments.

Patients are being forced to wait too long in A&E departments, and thousands 
are being left stranded on trolleys waiting for beds to become available on 
overcrowded hospital wards.

Shamefully, the Tories failed to provide any extra investment for social care 
in the autumn statement last month. Patients deserve better than this, and with 
the busy Christmas period approaching,Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is urging the government to take 
immediate action to protect our NHS.

This is what the department for transport is saying in response to the call

aboutGrayling’s decision to scrap plans to transfer control of London rail 
services to Transport for London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/transport-for-london-plans-ditched-chris-grayling-sadiq-khan>
 and thinks a leaked letter shows Graying may have misled MPs about the reasons 
for his decision. (See 1.55pm.)

In response, a spokesman for the department said:

The mayor’s business plan for the South Eastern franchise did not provide more 
frequent trains, it provided no extra capacity in peak hours, and it promised 
infrastructure improvements with no funding identified. These would come at a 
cost to Londoners or mean re-prioritising other travel schemes in the capital.

MPs and councillors had raised concerns about the mayor being given control 
over services for people who could not vote for the mayor.

We can deliver services improvements through partnership, without the need for 
a massive reorganisation and splitting the franchise.
 
Here is Matthew Swindells, NHS England’s national director of operations and 
information, on today’s waiting figures. (See 2.49pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3#block-5849742de4b08659393ba3b3>

These figures suggest A&E attendances are increasing rather faster than the 
growth in the number of major “accidents” and medical “emergencies”, putting 
great strain on A&E departments.

Going into the busy winter period, it is important people remember the first 
port of call for minor conditions or non-emergency medical care should be the 
local chemist, the 111 helpline, or their GP practice.

As well as pressures at the hospital ‘front door’, this month’s figures show a 
41% increase in delays in being able to discharge inpatients as a result of 
unavailability of social care, the highest figure ever.

Going into the holiday period, it is vital local councils, community health 
services and hospitals work closely to enable older patients to get the support 
they need after a hospital stay, back at home.
 
Today’s NHS England waiting time figures (pdf) 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/Monthly-performance-statistics-summary-2016-Oct-16-FINAL.pdf>
 show the health service continues to struggle, the Press Association reports.

Just 89% of patients were dealt with in A&E within four hours in October, 
against a target of 95%. The total number of A&E attendances was up 4% compared 
with the same period last year.

Other targets were also missed, including for patients to start treatment led 
by a consultant within 18 weeks, and cancer patients to start their first 
treatment within 62 days of urgent GP referral.

Delayed discharges are also the highest on record. This is when patients are 
medically fit to leave hospital but are unable to do so because social care 
packages or other care is not in place in the community.

The proportion of calls abandoned by people seeking help from the 111 helpline 
has also risen to 2.4% of calls in October, up from 1.5% in September.

Ambulance trusts across England also continue to miss targets for responding 
to life-threatening calls.

More tests to diagnose conditions were performed, although the proportion of 
patients waiting six weeks or more for results has risen slightly.
 
MPs are holding a debate to mark UN international day for the elimination of 
violence against women and in her speechMichelle Thomson told of how she was 
raped at the age of 14. “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor,” she said. 

Describing what happened she said:

When I was 14 I was raped. As is common, it was by somebody who was known to 
me. He had offered to walk me home from a youth event and in those days 
everybody walked everywhere, it was quite common to do that.

It was early evening, it wasn’t dark. I was wearing - I’m imagining, I’m 
guessing - jeans and a sweatshirt.

I didn’t think anything of it [when he took her a slightly different route.] 
He told me he wanted to show me something in a wooded area and at that point, I 
must admit, I was alarmed. I did have a warning bell - but I overrode that 
warning bell because I knew him and therefore there was a level of trust in 
place.

To be honest, looking back, at that point I don’t think I knew what rape was. 
It was not something that was talked about.”

It was mercifully quick and I remember first of all feeling surprise, then 
fear, then horror as I realised I quite simply couldn’t escape - because he was 
stronger than me, and there was no sense even initially of any sexual desire 
from him, which I suppose, looking back, again I find odd.

Thomson said that she did not tell her parents and that she felt “ashamed” of 
what had happened.

I didn’t tell my mother, I didn’t tell my father, I didn’t tell my friends and 
I didn’t tell the police. I bottled it all up inside me. I hoped, briefly and 
appallingly, that I might be pregnant so that would force a situation to help 
me control it ...

I felt I was spoiled and impure and really felt revulsion towards myself. I, 
of course, then detached from the child up to then I had been. Although, in 
reality, at the age of 14 it was probably the start of my sexual awakening, at 
that time, remembering back, sex was something that men did to women and 
perhaps this incident reinforced that early belief.

She said she later told a school boyfriend who was “supportive”.

But I couldn’t make sense of my response and it is my response which gives 
weight to the event. I carried that guilt, anger, fear, sadness and bitterness 
for years.

When I got married 12 years later I felt I had a duty to tell my husband. I 
wanted him to understand why there was this swaddled kernel of extreme emotion 
at the very heart of me that I knew he could sense, but for many years I simply 
could not say the words without crying.

It was only in my mid-40s that I took some steps to go and get help with it.

Thomson said that although she had been happily married for 25 years, the rape 
had “fatally undermined” her self-esteem, confidence and sense of self-worth.

She said that she now knew rape was not about sex, but about power and 
control. And she questioned myths about rape perpetuated from a male 
perspective.

These assumptions put the woman at the heart of cause, when she should be at 
the heart of effect.

A rape happens when a man makes a decision to hurt someone he feels he can 
control. Rapes happen because of the rapist, not because of the victim.

We women and our society have to stand up for each other, we have to be 
courageous, we have to call things out and say where things are wrong. We have 
to support and nurture our sisters as we do with our sons.

She concluded:

One thing I realise now is I’m not scared and he was. I’m not scared, I’m not 
a victim, I’m a survivor.

At the end Bercow thanked her for her speech, saying it had “left an indelible 
impression on us all”.

 * Spencer Livermore, who was Labour’s general election campaign director in 
2015, has accused Labour figures who favour curbs on EU migration of promoting 
a “dangerous fantasy”.Livermore did not name any individuals in his article for 
Progress Online, but his article came out after Andy Burnham gave a speech in 
the Commons yesterday claiming that theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party’s failure to grasp the need 
for migration controls was putting people at risk. (See 9.13am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/08/labours-failure-to-grasp-need-for-migration-controls-is-putting-people-at-risk-says-burnham-politics-live?page=with:block-5849196de4b06a0d55b18c72#block-5849196de4b06a0d55b18c72>
Livermore said that staying in the single market should take precedence over 
ending free movement for EU workers. He said: 
During the referendum campaign, the Labour party made it clear that 
simultaneously having cake and eating it was merely anotherBoris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> fantasy. Yet now, I regret to say, 
there are leading figures in our own party who are willing to collude in this 
fantasy. People who should – and I suspect do – know better, have become 
complicit in creating a fiction that our economy can remain within the single 
market, while at the same time cutting immigration and ending freedom of 
movement.

This is an extremely dangerous fantasy, and at some point in the next two 
years, this collective denial will collide with reality. As every European 
leader has made clear, this is not a deal that will ever be on offer. There 
will be no United Kingdom membership of the single market without freedom of 
movement. So as a nation we will have to make a stark choice: do we end freedom 
of movement or do we stay in the single market ...

Of course beating Ukip is a priority, but we need to ask whether conceding the 
argument that immigration is the underlying cause of every problem facing 
voters inLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> constituencies 
will in the end hurt or help Ukip – the party with the biggest lead on this 
issue.

It should be clear what would actually happen if we followed this path. Out of 
the single market, the British people will be poorer. But we will have left the 
EU, and freedom of movement will have been ended, so the Tory Government and a 
ferociously partisan tabloid media – desperate to avoid responsibility 
themselves – will need to find someone else to blame for the nation’s economic 
malaise.

 * An MP has moved colleagues to tears after revealing she was raped at 14, 
telling the Commons: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.”Michelle Thomson, MP

international day for the elimination of violence against women. I will post

 * Labour MPs have criticised Conservative party HQ for using Twitter to 
attack specific Labour colleagues, with tweet claiming the fact that they did 
not back the government last night meant they were refusing to respect the

 at least one of those targeted did not vote because he was abroad, and Labour 
have pointed out that Theresa May did not vote in the division either. 
 * The UK parliament can change the laws of Scotland regarding Brexit - but 
not the UK government using royal prerogative powers, Scotland’s most senior 
law officer has told the supreme court. As the Press Association reports, Lord 
Advocate James Wolffe QC argued that an act of parliament was required to 
trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty to start the two-year process of 
withdrawing from the EU. And he said the Scottish parliament was also entitled 
to a voice on the issue, which involved the serious loss of EU rights for 
Scottish people. There is more on our supreme court live blog.

The Lib Dems are also accusing Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> of hypocrisy over Saudi Arabia. 
This is from Tom Brake, the party’s foreign affairs spokesman.

For once Boris Johnson is talking sense, but his comments on Saudi’s 
questionable role in Middle Eastern politics are completely at odds with 
official government policy.

This will be a huge embarrassment to May as she returns from her grubby tour 
of the Gulf, where she did her best to ignore human rights and desperately push 
trade at all costs.

The Conservative government rightly condemned Fidel Castro for his human 
rights record, but have fallen completely silent when it comes to the appalling 
record of countries they have been cosying up to in the Middle East.

The hypocrisy is astounding.
 
And here’s Emily Thornberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/emily-thornberry>, the shadow foreign 
secretary, commenting on Boris Johnson’s Saudi intervention. She is accusing 
him of “shabby hypocrisy”.

For months, Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has been 
arguing that what last year began as a UN-backed attempt to restore the 
government of Yemen has now descended into a brutal and indiscriminate proxy 
war, and a desperate humanitarian crisis, with the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of children at risk.

That argument has consistently been rejected by Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> in the House of Commons, but now 
these remarks in Italy have shown us what he really thinks.

If that is his genuine view, he needs to explain why he ordered his MPs to 
vote against Labour’s calls in October to suspend support for the Saudi-led 
coalition in Yemen, until a lasting ceasefire has been brokered and until 
alleged violations of international humanitarian law have been properly 
investigated.

The government cannot complain about Saudi Arabia’s military actions one 
minute, then continue selling it the arms to prosecute those actions the next. 
We need to see some consistent principle in the UK’s foreign policy, not more 
shabby hypocrisy.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/boris-johnson-accuses-saudi-arabia-of-twisting-and-abusing-islam>
, that Saudi Arabia has been “playing proxy wars” in the Middle East, the Press 
Association reports.

Theresa May’s official spokeswoman said the prime minister had “full 
confidence” in Johnson but told reporters that his comments at a conference in 
Italy were his own personal view and did not reflect government policy.

And she pointedly noted that Johnson will have the opportunity to set out 
official policy - of Britain’s desire to strengthen its ties with Saudi Arabia 
and support for its military involvement in Yemen - when he travels to the 
desert kingdom for talks on Sunday.

May spoke with King Salman during her visit to the Persian Gulf this week, 
when he was able to hear the PM assure him of “her commitment and that of her 
government to enhancing and strengthening this relationship”, said the 
spokeswoman.
