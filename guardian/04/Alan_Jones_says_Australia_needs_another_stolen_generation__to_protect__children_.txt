Alan Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-jones> says Australia needs 
another stolen generation to “protect” children in Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander families from the drug abuse problems of their parents.

The talkback radio host made the comment while complaining about players in 
the National Rugby League Indigenous all-stars game on Saturday performing a 
traditional dance and observing a minute’s silence for members of the stolen 
generations.

Saturday was the eighth anniversary of the Australian government’s apology to 
members of the stolen generations, a policy from 1910 to the mid-1970s under 
which more than 10,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were 
removed from their families and placed in homes for the express purpose of 
assimilating them into non-Indigenous society.

Jones, on his 2GB radio show on Monday, agreed with a talkback caller who 
asked “When are they going to believe that half the stolen generation were 
taken for their own protection?”

“Correct, to look after them,” Jones said.

“And we need stolen generations – there are a whole heap of kids going through 
the courts now, or their families, mums going through the courts, and dads – 
who are on top of the world with drugs, or alcohol, and suddenly they go back 
into an environment where children are brought up in those circumstances.

“Those children for their own benefit should be taken away.”

Marngrook Footy Show presenter and Yolgnu woman Leila Gurruwiwi said Jones 
should be “banned for life” from talking about Indigenous people. Arrente woman 
and national Indigenous organiser for the National Tertiary Education Union, 
Celeste Liddle, said he was a “disgrace”.

Alan Jones is a disgrace. How he still has a gig post-Cronulla is beyond me, 
particularly when he uses it for this:https://t.co/yE1M3OIZOG

Greens senator Rachel Siewert called on Jones to apologise for the comments, 
saying, “this issue is alive and burning, even if we have apologised for it in 
the past.”

“I have news for him, a huge number of children, including Aboriginal kids, 
are being taken from families around Australia as we speak,” Siewert said.

“It is grossly inappropriate for Mr Jones to capitalise on the pain and 
suffering of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander peoples past and present who 
have had [children] subject to removal decades ago and are having them removed 
now. Such removals have caused generations of hurt and damage, we can’t repeat 
it.”

According to a Productivity Commission report released last year, Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander children arenine times more likely to be placed in 
out-of-home care 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/17/indigenous-children-nine-times-more-likely-to-be-placed-in-care-report-finds>
 than non-Indigenous children.

In 2013-14, nearly 15,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were 
in out-of-home care. On Thursday, members of advocacy group Grandmothers 
Against Removal, many of whom are members of the stolen generations themselves, 
marked the anniversary of the apology by marching on Canberra with a banner 
reading “Sorry means you don’t do it again.”

Writing in Guardian Australia last week, Indigenous academic Larissa Behrendt 
said that more Indigenous kids were being removed now than during the time of 
the stolen generation, and thatthe number of kids in out-of-home care should be 
included in the Close the Gap scorecard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2016/feb/13/eight-years-after-the-apology-indigenous-kids-are-still-being-removed-from-their-families>
.

Indigenous X founder Luke Pearson agreed, saying 
<http://indigenousx.com.au/there-isnt-a-new-stolen-generations/>: “nobody is 
arguing that child welfare is not the most important issue. What is often 
missing from this discussion is a critical examination of what is actually 
happening to prevent removal, particularly around resource allocation for 
family support and early interventions.”

Wait to see how many white media peeps write anything explaining why Alan 
Jones is wrong... I'm guessing the answer will be roughly 'zero'.

Jones is not the first conservative commentator to deny the stolen 
generations. In 2008 six conservative MPs boycotted the formal apology to 
members of the stolen generations, including former MP Sophie Mirabella who 
also argued children had been removed “for their own protection”.

Rudd recently described the apology to Guardian Australia Indigenous affairs 
editor Stan Grant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/10/reflections-on-the-apology-kevin-rudd-in-conversation-with-stan-grant>
as a “hearts and minds, guts, flesh and blood understanding that we have 
wronged Aboriginal people, and that as a representative of a nation and myself 
as a white Australian I had a particular responsibility – as a white male – to 
spell it in black and white in words that I meant as to why I was sorry.”
