Ally McCoist <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ally-mccoist>, the Rangers 
manager, has been given a suspended three-match touchline ban for comments he 
made about the Scottish Football Association's judicial panel.

McCoist was found guilty of two of three charges by an SFA fast track tribunal 
but his punishment is suspended for 12 months.

The club's chief executive, Charles Green, escaped with a censure for comments 
he made in the media claiming "bigotry" was one of the reasons his newco club 
were denied entry to the SPL.

McCoist was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute and not acting in 
the best interests of football for questioning the independence of the panel 
that handedRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> a 12-month 
transfer embargo in April, before they were consigned to liquidation.

A third charge relating to his demands that the three-man panel's identities 
were made public was dismissed.

Rangers were censured for Green's comments, made before his newco club made 
their first appearance on the pitch, in a Ramsdens Cup tie at Brechin City last 
month, since being denied entry to the SPL and voted into the Third Division.
