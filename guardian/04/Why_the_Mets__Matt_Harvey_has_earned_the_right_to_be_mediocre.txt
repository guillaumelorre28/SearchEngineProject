Charles in New Jersey <http://cbsloc.al/1TZkzVG> thinks Matt Harvey drinks too 
much while on the town flaunting his shoe collection

, whileRon in Queens 
<http://www.athletepromotions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ron-Darling.jpg>
 thinks Harvey has developed a bad habit of cupping the ball during his 
delivery. From talk radio to the broadcast booth to bleachers around baseball, 
fans and media in New York and beyond are trying to solve the sudden demise of 
the Dark Knight. It’s his weight,it’s the blood clot 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/harvey-blood-clots-bladder-passed-article-1.2580871>
, it’s his attitude, it’s the lingering psychological impact of failing after 
convincing his manager to send him out for the ninth inning in Game 5 of the 
World Series, and of course, it’s his body’s blowback from a busy 2015 
post-surgery season.

Matt Harvey, a franchise cornerstone who once lit up Flushing’s darkest days, 
who was once an undisputed ace, who was just mere outs away from that Fall 
Classic performance for the ages, hasn’t hit rock bottom, even if it may have 
seemed like it on Tuesday night in Washington. The Nats discovered that his 
third time through the lineup is a charm: ex-teammate Daniel Murphy and company 
teed off the righty,just as they did during Harvey’s prior start 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=harvema01&t=p&year=2016>, 
a performance that has led to even more speculation.

Would Harvey go on the disabled list? Would he be demoted to the minors to 
work out his kinks?

As it turns out, Harvey will do neither. He will stay the course, and face the 
Chicago White Sox on Monday.

“This guy is too big a piece to write him off, to flip him in the bullpen 
where you pick and choose where you might use him,” Mets skipper Terry Collins 
said. “This is the big leagues, so we’re going to certainly go about it that 
way.”

The Mets have made more than their share of mistakes over the years, but 
sending Harvey back out to the mound is not one of them. Nor was Harvey pushing 
himself to the hilt last season, when he set a new mark for innings pitched by 
a hurler in his first year back from Tommy John surgery. You take your chances 
in the postseason: you never know if you’re going back.

And while it’s impossible to know if the hurlers issues have been caused by 
his blowing past the 180 inning stop sign put up by his agent Scott Boras and 
surgeon Dr Andrews, here’s what I do know: Harvey has earned the right to be 
mediocre in 2016.

If a franchise, its fans and the media asks a player to put the team ahead of 
a career, then then the franchise, its fans and the media lay off the player 
when he hits potholes, when his world dissolves, when things that once came 
naturally suddenly seem foreign.

Harvey has work to do in summoning the snap in his slider, to rediscover his 
command, to make the on the fly adjustments that Jacob deGrom has done when 
facing a similar loss in velocity. Harvey has to make peace with the idea that, 
at least this season, grounders are as good as strikeouts and that keeping his 
team in the game is as productive as dominating it.

Harvey deserves rope, but in exchange, he also needs to face the music and the 
press after games, and to realize, that you can’t zip in and out of the gossip 
columns when there’s no zing on your fastball: that only works when you’re 
winning.

The Mets can’t carry a pitcher with an ERA over six all season, but Harvey 
should be granted the space needed to make the best of his current hand: low 
fours and high threes will do just fine in 2016.

Down the road we’ll find out if Harvey truly is the Dark Knight: a 
larger-than-life baseball entity that can rule the tabloids front and back 
while blowing away batters, or what every athlete seeking stardom dreads: being 
average. For now at least, he has the capital find out on his own terms.

Quote of the week

“.”

That’s Matt Harvey not speaking with the media after his latest shellacking on 
Tuesday against Washington.

Who’s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs?

It’s a big week for Donald Trump, who must be glowing (more than usual) after 
picking up the support of one Woody Johnson 
<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/24/longtime-republican-backers-join-donald-trump-rnc-fundraising-effort/>
. Not only did Trump earn the endorsement of the New York Jets’ owner, but 
Johnson became the vice-chairman of a fundraising committee called Trump 
Victory. Sure, the billionaire presumptive Republican nominee also picked up 
some additional financial support from the party establishment, but surely the 
coup is having someone that familiar with green running the show. Meanwhile the 
Cubs are 4-6 in their last ten, a stretch that represents their first slump of 
the season. Even Jake Arrieta was hit on Wednesday in St Louis. Eleven days ago 
Chicago had a nine-game NL Central lead and now the surging Pittsburgh Pirates 
have trimmed it to five, which hasn’t impressed Cubbies righty John Lackey a 
single bit.

“They’re kind of irrelevant. If we play our game, we’ll be OK.”

So there.

How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week?

Josh Donaldson complaining about how Major League Baseball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball> has to do something about pitchers 
throwing at batters isnot going to get him on Goose’s Christmas card list.

On Sunday, Minnesota Twins command king Phil Hughes, whose 2014 single-season 
mark of just0.6868 walks per nine innings tied him with some guy named Cy Young 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/bases_on_balls_per_nine_season.shtml>
 for 37th all-time, came curiously close to hitting Donaldson on one pitch 
before throwing behind the Blue Jays slugger on another offering. That was no 
accident, of course; rather, it was unwritten-rule retribution for his staring 
down of a Twins bench coach after a hitting a home run earlier in the game, 
because that coach, Joe Vavra had beenbusting Donalsdon’s chops the day before 
<http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/donaldson-mlb-needs-better-policing-pitchers-throw-batters/>
. Hughes wasn’t thrown out for his sins, but Jays manager John Gibbons was, 
after coming out to protest and protect his player. Needless to say, Donaldson 
wasn’t happy.

“Major League Baseball has to do something about this,” Donaldson said. “They 
say they’re trying to protect players. They make a rule that says you can’t 
slide hard into second base. They make a rule to protect the catchers on slides 
into home. But when you throw a ball at somebody, nothing’s done about it. My 
manager comes out to ask what’s going on and he gets ejected for it. That’s 
what happens.”

Goose probably wouldn’t like Yasiel Puig not running out a long drive 
<http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2016/05/25/yasiel-puig-benched-after-he-failed-to-run-hard-out-of-the-box/>
, or Miguel Cabrera giving the thumbs up to Jeremy Hellickson after striking 
out either.

<https://twitter.com/Cut4/status/735452611545989121> 
Nine thoughts in order

1) It’s been a big week for the 85-year-old combo of Big Sexy Bartolo Colon 
and Ichiro Suzuki, both who of whom have looked ageless while entertaining. 
Miami’s 42-year-old Japanese outfielder had a pair of four-hit games while 
enjoying a stretch of 10 hits in 13 at bats versus Washington and Tampa Bay. 
Meanwhile,the loose-lipped Colon 
<http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/bartolo-colon-doesnt-swing-because-back-hurts-mets-nationals-052416>
 recovered from a pair of rough starts,celebrated his 43rd birthday 
<http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2016/05/24/179251924/celebrate-bartolo-colons-43rd-birthday>
 a day early by holding Washington to one run over seven innings in a Mets win 
on Monday.

Rather incredibly, after years of vast declines, Ichiro is posting 
.357/.416/.400 off the bench, and could reach 3,000 hits this summer barring 
injury. That will prompt a baseball celebration for the Marlins, not that their 
ownership deserve it because …

2) … after all, we’re talking about a team that sues his own fans – and loyal 
ones at that.The Miami New Times 
<http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/marlins-sue-season-ticketholders-vendors-bankrupted-by-small-crowds-8475702>
 reports that Jeffrey Loria is suing Mickey Axelband, a super-fan who had 
season tickets from the team’s founding in 1993 until recently. It’s alleged 
that Axelband backed out of a two-year ticket deal after the team reneged on 
several promises such as private parking, entrances, fully stocked buffets and 
other luxury items that people would drop some $24,000 a season for. Loria, who 
infamouslyran taxpayers ragged in building a new Miami stadium 
<http://deadspin.com/5978964/the-real-cost-to-miami-for-marlins-park-is-in-the-billions>
, has actually sued nine fans since 2013, continuing a legacy that makes George 
Steinbrenner look like a schoolboy.

3) It’s hard to watch Alex Rodriguez addressing the media at Double-A Trenton 
and not be reminded of the mayhem ofAugust of 2013 and the Biogenesis PED 
scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/08/yankees-biogenesis-braves-tigers-playoffs>
. Back then,A-Rod’s defiant minor-league roadshow 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEk1s1vrF3I> took him through New Jersey as he 
rehabbed from hip surgery before rejoining the Yankees and appealing his 
impending suspension. Years later, A-Rod is an unlikely media darling who is 
saying all the right things, even as New York stash him in the minors for a few 
more days in a bid save their new-found mojo. Joe Girardi’s Yanks are 14-7 
since A-Rod hit the disabled list, and part of the reason is that 39-year-old 
Carlos Beltran has been muchmore productive in Rodriguez’ DH role 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=beltrca01&year=2016&t=b>
. Unless A-Rod can re-capture his surprise 2015 form upon his return, the Yanks 
could opt to havea very expensive  
<http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/92877/a-roag-its-time-the-yankees-made-alex-rodriguez-a-part-time-player>
part-timer on the payroll. Would A-Rod continue to toe the line if he gets less 
playing time?

4) Baltimore are one of the select Major League Baseball teams that are 
granted “competitive balance” picks that follow the first and second rounds of 
the upcoming amateur draft. For the second straight season, the O’s have sent 
that pick to a team in exchange for a salary dump. This time Baltimore sent the 
disappointing Brian Matusz, $3m of his salary and the 76th overall pick to the 
rebuildingAtlanta Braves <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-braves> for 
a pair of pitchers. Why are early-round picks designed to help disadvantaged 
teams re-stock systems with potential prospects allowed to be used to save 
money?

Yes, the move freed up money could help Baltimore acquire a player at the 
trade deadline, and yes, the O’s got some “pitching depth,” as they described 
the two 16th round hurlers who aren’t among Atlanta’s top 30 prospects. Still, 
it would seem that one of the points of the picks are to help lower-revenue 
clubs that struggle to sign free-agents, that are currently competing for 
playoff spots, benefit from an additional selection during a time when their 
draft position is lower. I’m not sure where a salary dump fits in with that 
philosophy.

5) Great news: retired pitcher Bill “Spaceman” Lee 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylBywQtsp6E> is running for governor of 
Vermont, and on a platform that includes legalization and taxation of 
marijuana, single-payer healthcare, and most importantly, bringing the Expos 
back to Montreal. It’s not the first time Lee has tempted voters with baseball 
benefits: back in 1987 he promised to ban the DH, AstroTurf and domed stadiums 
while running for president on the Rhinoceros Party ticket.Check out this fun 
piece from WCAX

.

6) Special thanks to Alfredo Simon for keeping the famed Eephus pitch alive. 
Shawn O’Malley of the Seattle Mariner never had a shot at this 54mph gem.

Come to think of it, it’s nearly 70 years since Ted Williams took the father 
of the Eephus pitch, Rip Sewell, deep in the 1946 All-Star Game.

 Ol’ Ted found Sewell’s Eephus just splendid. 
7) The folks at MLB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> At Bat are taking 
the 75th anniversary of Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hit streak quite seriously, 
rattling the phones of baseball fans with alerts to mark the occasion of each 
hit, as it happened during the 1941 season.
Jon Roegele (@MLBPlayerAnalys) 
Can't wait for the inevitable At Bat alert telling me Joe DiMaggio is a triple 
short of the cycle this day 75 years ago...thrilling stuff!

DiMaggio are dead.

<https://twitter.com/hockeenight/status/610949698560630784> 
Look, the app is amazing: there’s a reason the NHL partners with MLB to do 
their own. I don’t mind alerts for modern-day events, but I would really 
appreciate if the Dimaggio onslaught would stop. If I had my way, the next time 
I see Joe Dimaggio’s name flashes across my screen it should be about Jackie 
Bradley Jr breaking his all-time streak. Bradley has hit in 29 consecutive 
games.

8) NBA defenders have their hands tied, NFL cornerbacks walk on eggshells 
while covering wideouts. Now MLB is the latest league looking to inject offense 
into its sport through rule changes. This week we learned that staring in 2017, 
the strike zone will shrink: rising from the hollow beneath a hitter’s kneecap 
to the top of the knee, presumably providing overmatched batters with a better 
shot at not striking out or grounding out.

It’s not the first time MLB have tinkered with the zone to alter the balance 
of power between pitchers and hitters: back in 2001, MLB beganenforcing the 
“high strike” <http://reds.enquirer.com/2001/02/25/red_high_time_for_new.html>, 
helping hurlers that had been getting crushed by over-inflated batters. Runs 
per game dropped immediately, but over time the strike zonegrew larger and lower
 <http://www.vocativ.com/321368/why-baseballs-strike-zone-is-changing/>. Run 
averages mostly dropped from 2006-2014, with some slight offensive gains this 
season and last. Based on the surges in attendance during baseball’s steroid 
era, we know thatchicks, and everybody else, dig the long ball 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLECMCargd8>, so it makes sense that MLB is 
seeking a more natural remedy to their power outage. And if it works, maybe 
fans won’t have to sit through a 13-inning game featuring some 19 strikeouts by 
the Baltimore Orioles, as they did on Tuesday night in Houston.

9) And finally, if you think Matt Harvey is losing it, check out Frisco 
RoughRiders manager, Joe Mikulik.
