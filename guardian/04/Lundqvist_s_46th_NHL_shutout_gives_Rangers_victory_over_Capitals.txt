The New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist earned his 46th NHL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl> shutout to help his team to a 2-0 win 
over theWashington Capitals on Wednesday, ending a run of three games without a 
win. Brad Richards helped set up goals by Ryan Callahan and John Moore, and 
Lundqvist made 22 saves.

The Capitals were unable to produce much of a scoring threat, even with their 
formidable power play and three-time NHL MVP Alex Ovechkin, and fell to 2-5.

In the day's other game, the Anaheim Ducks beat the Calgary Flames 3-2 to 
extend its best season start in club history. Teemu Selanne scored the first 
goal of his 22nd NHL season, while Dustin Penner and Kyle Palmieri scored 
first-period goals for the Ducks, who have won five of their first six games 
for the first time in the club's two-decade history.

Anaheim has won 26 of its past 27 home games against Calgary. Lee Stempniak 
scored a short-handed goal and Jiri Hudler got credit for a deflected goal 
early in the third period for the Flames, who lost in regulation for the first 
time this season.
