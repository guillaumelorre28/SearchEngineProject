Standing in a dark, metal box, hot sunlight streaming through the few small 
windows, dangling from a rusty cable 20 meters above the ground, I can see why 
these claustrophobic carriages were nicknamed metal coffins. I am in Chiatura, 
a manganese mining town in a Georgia, 113 milesfrom Tbilisi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/03/tbilisi-georgia-holidays-chris-morgan-jones-crime-writer-favourites>
, and built around a deep gorge. Faced with such awkward topography, the Soviet 
authorities built a series of cable cars that swept from housing projects and 
industrial facilities on the cliff tops down to the town centre in the valley 
below.

The earliest of the cable cars were built in 1954 and only a few are still in 
service. The rest hang motionless, like monuments to an optimistic vision of an 
alternative future as imagined by Soviet engineers. Indeed, not all the 
carriages are simple metal boxes: one in particular has a curved glass roof and 
looks something like a hover car from a 1960s comic book.

I ride one of the dozen or so still in service and it lifts me silently to the 
top of the cliff from where I can see wonderful views of the city and also the 
cable car’s machinery – which looks so decrepit it’s amazing it still works. 
Presumably, when it eventually fails, that will be the end of the chair lifts.

Chiatura looks and feels as you’d expect a former Soviet mining town to, with 
run-down industrial buildings and stark concrete housing projects painted in 
pastel shades. This evocative scenery is what inspiredAriel Kleiman to shoot 
his film Partisan here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/apr/19/partisan-trailer-vincent-cassel-ariel-kleiman>
, which is what drew me in the first place.

The Mghvimevi monastery was carved into the cliff a thousand years before the 
mines and the Soviets came along. And a short bus ride through beautiful 
countryside is Katskhi Pillar, a bizarre monolith of rock that ancient hermits 
somehow surmounted and left engravings which have been used to verify the age 
of the unique Georgian script. There is now a spindly ladder to the top of the 
monolith – but beware, only men are allowed to climb!

I savour some of the best food I’ve had in all of Georgia in Chiatura: hearty 
bowls of beans, cheesy breads and dumplings filled with soup. This is washed 
down with homemade white wine, which I am strongly encouraged to throw down in 
one gulp. Sometimes out of a ram’s horn.
