It was an adverse reaction to ear infection medication, OK? Man, I wish people 
would stop reading all kinds of crazy stuff into the bimonthly summoning of 
paramedics to my home by one of my daughters, after I begin rambling and 
falling over. Yes, I'm a recovering alcoholic, but my two teenage girls – the 
Hoff Drops, I call them – are naturally hypersensitive to my wellbeing. When 
your daddy's the Hoff, a cold could be entertainment-critical.

As my publicist told reporters, this time it was an "equilibirum problem" 
brought on by medication, which is as far from a relapse as you can get. I'll 
tell you something: I spent a very successful part of my career talking to a 
car. If I was relapsing into anything, it was that – an easy dialogue with a 
fine piece of hardware. With my Spanish tiled bathroom floor in place of the 
car, obviously.

Unfortunately, Hoff Drop 2 misread the situation, and because everything the 
Hoff does is front-page news from West Hollywood to the East Berlin I 
effectively liberated, we're now dealing with "back on the booze" headlines. 
Weirdly, my publicist and I are split on strategy. "When I told you to take 
your daughter out somewhere you'd be photographed," he hissed, " I didn't mean 
to a lingerie launch at a dildo-stuffed sex shop. She's 17, David!"

"Relax," I said. "These are tasteful dildos, made out of stuff like jade and 
ebony." But he'd slammed down the phone. Why am I so frequently misunderstood? 
I feel an earache coming on.
