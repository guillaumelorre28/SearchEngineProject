The Australia captain, Steve Smith, admitted the sight of Eoin Morgan, his 
opposite number, being struck in the head by a bouncer brought memories of 
Phillip Hughes’ tragic death flooding back for his players – and the fast 
bowler Mitchell Starc in particular –during their eight-wicket victory

Starc, who was playing for New South Wales last November when the South 
Australia batsman Hughes was killed

following a bouncer to the back of the head, appeared visibly shaken after his 
short-pitched delivery, in the seventh over of the series decider, forced 
Morgan to retire hurt on one, with England going on to be bowled out for 138.

Morgan was able to walk off the field – he took no further part in the match 
and was later diagnosed with concussion – but the Australia head coach, Darren 
Lehmann, was seen comforting Starc on the boundary rope after the change of 
ends. Smith, another former team-mate of Hughes, extended his best wishes to 
Morgan in his recovery.

“There were a couple of guys shaken up – Starcy in particular,” said Smith, 
after his side’s eight-wicket victory secured a 3-2 series win. “It was a tough 
summer for us back home, losing a close mate [Hughes].

“It’s always nasty when you get a glance like that, so there were a few guys 
shaken up. Whenever anyone gets hit on the helmet like that your first concern 
is for their health. Mine is that at the moment for Eoin. I hope he’s OK and he 
can recover well.”

England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, who was in charge of New South Wales 
when Hughes died, admitted there were anxious moments in the home dressing room 
also, with Morgan taking an hour to come properly round after the blow and 
sporting a bruise. “He has a lump on his head and headache but he’s OK,” said 
Bayliss. “He’s up and about and having a chat now, so he’s fine.

“When anyone gets hit it is an anxious moment. He was a bit dizzy for a while 
– it took and hour or so to come good – and I’m sure the medical staff will 
keep a close eye on him.”

While that incident brought the cricket into perspective, Bayliss spoke 
afterwards of the need for his side to reduce the number of off days they 
experience after hauling themselves back into the series from 2-0 down only to 
blow the decider with the bat after winning the toss.

With England having recovered from their disastrous one-day winter with 
victory over New Zealand earlier in the summer, before running the world 
champions close here, the Australian believes he remains on course to create a 
team to challenge for the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup, both of 
which are on home soil.

“We didn’t play well, Australia did and that’s what happens. That’s the 
challenge for this team – those days need to happen less and less. There are 
some exciting young players and it will be an exciting future.

 England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, gives an update on Eoin Morgan’s 
condition after the one-day captain was hit on the head by a Mitchell Starc 
bouncer in the defeat by Australia

“There is still work to be done. We have shown people how well we can play but 
to be the best in the world you have to play smart cricket and that comes with 
experience. Going forward, it will be a natural thing – some will make it, some 
won’t.”

Bayliss will sit down with his fellow selectors on Monday morning to discuss 
the Test squad for the series starting next month against Pakistan in the 
United Arab Emirates before flying back to Sydney to see his family.

Smith, who worked under Bayliss before his defection to England, may well be 
on the same plane, with the Australia captain anticipating 10 days of rest 
before his side embark on a two‑Test tour of Bangladesh.

“I’m a bit tired, to be perfectly honest,” said Smith, who has played more 
internationals than any other Australian cricketer this year. “I’m really 
looking forward to getting home. It’s been a long summer but it’s a great place 
to play cricket over here.”

Asked for his appraisal of England’s chances against Pakistan in the UAE, 
having been beaten by them in the Ashes series, Smith added: “It’s always a 
tough tour there. The conditions are extremely hot and the wickets are 
generally dry and spin quite a bit. For guys like England and us it’s quite 
foreign to us, those conditions.

“There’s no doubt it will be a tough series but they’ve obviously got a lot of 
confidence from what they’ve done over the summer against us, so I see no 
reason for them not doing well over there.”
