The Belgian authorities and the country’s football federation are seeking 
action against Standard Liège fans who displayed a banner showing a drawing of 
a beheadedAnderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> player 
before their weekend match.

The banner which said, Red or Dead, referred to the Standard colours and also 
showed a drawing of a masked man with a knife and the head of Anderlecht 
midfielder Steven Defour, who used to play for Standard before moving to rivals 
Anderlecht.

The display caused uproar and the interior ministry said it is considering 
sanctions that could include a five-year stadium ban and a fine of €5,000 
(£3,742) for each individual supporter involved. “We’re working together with 
police to catch as many of the authors of this banner as possible,” a 
spokeswoman for the interior ministry said.

Yves Leterme, a Standard Liège supporter and former prime minister, also 
expressed his disappointment. “Standard-Anderlecht has been ruined by a 
minority of supporters. I remain a supporter but feel ashamed by the banner,” 
he wrote on Twitter.
