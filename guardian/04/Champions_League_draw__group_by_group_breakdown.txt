cast and sub-plots

. The French champions and the 10-times winners, now led by Rafael Benítez, 
should progress but there is potential for the odd slip-up. Shakhtar Donetsk 
have coped admirably with relocating to Lviv during the Ukraine conflict but 
that was before losing Douglas Costa to Bayern and Luiz Adriano to Milan this 
summer. Malmo,as Celtic discovered to their cost 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/25/malmo-celtic-champions-league-playoff-second-leg-match-report>

Group B

PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, CSKA Moscow, Wolfsburg

It was as though Manchester United had never been away when the draw began and 
the old accusations that they never have a difficult group followed. But then 
the Bundesliga runners-up Wolfsburg emerged and changed the complexion to a far 
more balanced group. Kevin De Bruyne will be a major loss to Wolfsburgshould 
Manchester City finally buy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/27/manchester-city-kevin-de-bruyne-wolfsburg>
 the former Chelsea winger, although it is how PSV cope with the upheaval 
caused by Premier League riches that may well determine qualification. Phillip 
Cocu has lost Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum from the team that won the 
Dutch title so impressively last season.

Group C

Benfica, Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid>
, Galatasaray, Astana

A long journey into the unknown awaits those drawn alongside Astana, the first 
team from Kazakhstan to qualify for the group stage, having beaten APOEL in the 
play-offs. Astana’s rise has been considerable – they were formed seven years 
ago – and that should serve as a warning against complacency to theChampions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> regulars before 
they embark on a 10-hour flight – in Benfica’s case – to Kazakhstan. 
Galatasaray did not win a group game last season and despite Benfica’s 
turbulent summer – 12 players in, 10 out and the coach Jorge Jesus defecting 
across town to Sporting – they and Atlético should prove too strong.

“Happy with that,” tweeted Vincent Kompany, convincing absolutely no one after 
Manchester City’s residence

 in the cliched ’Group of Death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/27/manchester-city-champions-league-group-of-death>
’ continued for another year. The champions of Italy, the Europa League holders 
and the third strongest team in Germany present another significant obstacle to 
City’s ambitions on the European stage, although painful experience must pay 
dividends one day. Juventus have lost several key players since giving 
Barcelona a genuine frightin last season’s final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/06/barcelona-juventus-luis-suarez>
 but City target Paul Pogba remains, for now. Sevilla sold Carlos Bacca but 
hope Ciro Immobile and Yevhen Konoplyanka will compensate. An open group.

Group E

Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>, Roma, Bate Borisov

The reigning champions were fittingly the first club drawn and will have few 
qualms over what followed. If Luis Enrique’s team have a formidable rival in 
the way of their hopes of becoming the first club to retain the Champions 
League, it is not in this group. Barcelona beat the champions of Belarus 4-0 
and 5-0 in 2011 and Bayer Leverkusen 7-1 in 2012 when Lionel Messiscored five 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/07/barcelona-bayer-leverkusen-champions-league-mbm>

this summer and it is Roma who look best equipped to join the holders in the 
last 16.

Group F

Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos>, Dinamo Zagreb

Arsène Wenger had criticised the changes to this season’s draw, arguing the 
seeding system was rendered “useless” by the roll call of champions in pot one, 
although he could have few complaints with the outcome. Of course Arsenal could 
have landed an easier champion than Bayern Munich, theirlast-16 conquerors in 
2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/11/bayern-munich-arsenal-champions-league-match-report>
, but Olympiakos and the Croatian champions should not present a barrier to a 
top-two finish. Whether Olympiakos should even be in the draw is open to 
conjecture with a match-fixing investigation pending against the Greek club.

José Mourinho will relish a return to the club he led to a 2004 Champions 
League triumph more than the reunion with their new goalkeeper, Iker Casillas. 
The feud from their Real Madrid days lingers to this day. Portoreached the 
quarter-finals last season 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/21/bayern-munich-porto-champions-league-match-report>
 and then did what they usually do, sold key players for lucrative fees – 
Jackson Martínez and Danilo this summer – and moved on. Dynamo Kyiv’s chances 
of muscling in on the top two may rest on whether Andriy Yarmolenko stays but 
this looks the most straightforward group for a Premier League side.

Group H

Zenit St Petersburg, Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, 
Lyon, Gent

The former Manchester City striker Álvaro Negredo scored the decisive goal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/25/champions-league-round-up-negredo-valencia-monaco>
 in Valencia’s play-off win over Monaco and their reward is a place in one of 
the more competitive groups. First-time qualifiers Gent, the surprise Belgium 
champions, and an emerging Lyon team complete the threat to Zenit St 
Petersburg, who, after plenty of investment and promises, have yet to make a 
genuine impact on the Champions League. The experience and quality within André 
Villas-Boas’s side should give them the edge, however.
