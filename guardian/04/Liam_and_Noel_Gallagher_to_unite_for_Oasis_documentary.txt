Liam and Noel Gallagher <https://www.theguardian.com/music/noel-gallagher> are 
to be reunited on the big screen after agreeing to star in a film about Oasis.

The brothers, who fronted the group, have agreed to share their favourite 
memories and offer their insight in interviews for Mat Whitecross’s documentary 
movie. The band’s record label, Big Brother Recordings, will grant the 
film-makers access to archives.

The film, produced by director Asif Kapadia and James Gay-Rees who made Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy>, the film about the late singer Amy 
Winehouse, will offer “a rare and candid insight” into the group and document 
Oasis’s early beginnings when Noel first joined his brother Liam’s band in 1991.

It will chart their rise to fame when their first album, Definitely Maybe, 
became the fastest selling debut in British history when it was released in 
1994 and follow the siblings as they landed eight UK No 1 singles and eight UK 
No 1 albums until their acrimonious split in 2009.

The film, which scheduled for release in 2016, will feature Oasis’s two-night 
residency at Knebworth Park in 1996, when they played to 250,000 fans.

The Gallagher brothers have had a turbulent relationship since the split and 
have yet to resolve their differences amid constant rumours they plan to 
reunite.

In May, Noel criticised his brother for walking out on their live shows, 
saying: “I could never forgive him for that, ever.”

They have since continued making music separately, with Liam using the name 
Beady Eye until the band broke up in 2014, while Noel went on to form his solo 
project in Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds.

Whitecross’s fims include Spike Island about the Stone Roses and Sex And Drugs 
And Rock And Roll, a biopic of punk pioneer Ian Dury.

 Amy broke box office records on its release earlier this year and became the 
highest-grossing British documentary of all time, with takings of £5.4 m.
