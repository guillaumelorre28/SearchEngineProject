From an anonymous male
Dear Carole, I have in the past suffered from "retroactive jealousy": an 
irrational jealousy focused on your partner's past. I've since realised that 
this is surprisingly common, having spoken to numerous men with the same issue. 
This mostly comprises a jealous reaction to previous sexual partners (now long 
gone), and an obsessive dwelling on your partner's past behaviour.

These feelings can be destructive and difficult, although fortunately they can 
be overcome with some effort.

Do you have any insights into jealousy from a Darwinian perspective?

Carole replies:
Psychologists use several terms to describe the various forms of sexual 
jealousy, including pathological jealousy, erotic jealousy, morbid jealousy, 
conjugal paranoia, jealous monomania, and psychotic/non-psychotic and 
obsessional jealousy.

Jealousy is seen in all human societies,1 
<http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/buss-passion.html> and field studies of 
wild primates have shown that sexual jealousy is not peculiar to humans.2 
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/w6116ut1287632t3/> Sexual jealousy, 
control and coercion are especially common in primate species where males 
control harems of females, such as langurs, baboons and gorillas.

Because sexual jealousy is universal, human societies have established 
baselines of behavioural jealousy that are widely tolerated and accepted as 
"natural". (In Texas, up until 1974, if a man found his wife in bed with her 
lover it was considered "reasonable" for him to shoot them both dead.)

However, a turn of the screw beyond this socially accepted level of sexual 
jealousy we start to see behaviour that teeters on the edge of obsession. Any 
intensification from this point onwards and the jealousy can be considered 
pathological.

A further increase in intensity and the jealousy becomes delusional, where the 
jealous partner is convinced their accusations of infidelity are correct. This 
is sometimes referred to asOthello syndrome 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_jealousy>.3 
<http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1955/10000/THE_OTHELLO_SYNDROME__A_Study_in_the.8.aspx>
 This form can further intensify with aggressive, unjustified interrogations 
and excessive sexual demands. The delusional behaviour may continue for years 
and is a likely manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). No amount 
of reassurance, pleading or begging will placate the paranoid delusional spouse.

Sexual jealousy is the most common motive for a man killing his sexual 
partner. It appears to be behindthe attempted murder of Samantha Stobbart and 
the murder of her partner

the time of writing the suspected gunman and former boyfriend of Stobbart,Raoul 
Moat, is still at large

.

It has been theorised that a mate-killing module has evolved in the brain to 
control females and restore the social status of the cuckolded male.1 
<http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/buss-passion.html> In some Muslim 
societies females live in fear of an accusation of infidelity and subsequent 
"honour killing". Female langur monkeys live in fear of new males taking 
control of the troop by force and killing their babies.4 
<http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NYVRhH7VywkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Langurs+of+Abu:+Female+and+Male+Strategies+of+Reproduction&source=bl&ots=doVhmlF1id&sig=suy-MXIKybjG5uJFtOpvx7wInSk&hl=en&ei=D0kzTMGOBJay0gTStIyuAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false>
 Violent acts by controlling males have, over aeons of evolution, ensured that 
the genes of these males are passed on to the next generation.

In modern human society, however, it is clear that much of this evolved 
behaviour is counterproductive. Would a rational male deliberately physically 
and psychologically damage his spouse and the mother of his children? The 
future success of the next generation hangs in the balance when a jealous, 
patriarchal male uses aggression to control the females in his life.

Most people would find the idea of a man increasing his reproductive fitness 
at the expense of the happiness of his spouse and an infant abhorrent. A woman 
sexually coerced and harassed by a jealous partner will not make a good mother,
so a jealous male only harms himself when he harms his family 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/may/24/women-domestic-violence>.

You say that with effort you overcame your destructive, obsessive jealousy. 
May this give hope to others who struggle to rise above their ancient, 
hard-wired sexual obsession.
