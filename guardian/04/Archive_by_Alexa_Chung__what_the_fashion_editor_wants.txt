Alexa Chung’s first raid of the archives got a thumbs up for bringing some 
much-needed cool toM&S <https://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer>, but 
this second season is the one that has us reaching for our wallets. Think same 
purity of fashion content, approximately 50% more wearability.

Take the pie-crust blouse, an Alexa signature. Last season, it was a trophy 
piece, but tricky IRL, thanks to the stiff back-fastening collar and the slim 
sleeves. In this collection, which drops on 1 November, a pale-blue style 
fastens down the front and an elasticated button loops at the cuff, a practical 
detail borrowed from the M&S school-uniform department.

 Herringbone coat by Alexa Chung for M&S. 
If you haven’t bought an autumn coat yet, you might want to hold fire till 1 
November, because there are three beauties here. Drumroll please for my 
personal favourite piece, the white fake-fur Crown jacket. Starting with a 90s 
shawl collar, Alexa has added a furry hood and a ring-pull zip for a 
2016-does-90s-rave look that works perfectly with floor-grazing silky tracksuit 
bottoms.

 Pussybow blouse by Alexa Chung for M&S. Photograph: Marks & Spencer 
At the London fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/ng-interactive/2016/feb/23/london-fashion-week-behind-the-scenes-a-photo-essay>
 preview, there was a lot of fashion-editor love for an Ellery herringbone 
coat, just oversized enough to be special, but not so big that it flaps around 
everywhere, and a total bargain for £125. Most Alexa of all is the Templar 
coat, £99, remodelled from a classic M&S girl’s coat: princess cut, double rows 
of shiny buttons, overstitched velvet collar. The perfect 60s 
European-junior-royal coat, in other words.


As you would expect from a staple of best-dressed lists, the collection is on 
point for autumn trend. Two velvet dresses, for instance: a party frock in 
crushed velvet (very next-season Victoria Beckham) and an excellent pinafore 
dress in black velvet, which will work a dream over a white T-shirt. There are 
good fashion basics, too: a school-jumper V-neck sweater (tweaked with a 
slightly deeper neckline) comes in grey, navy or pale pink for £35.


In her rummages in the M&S archive, Alexa has found some great stories, as 
well as clothes. A gold silk blouse in the new collection is a remake of the 
golden Aire blouse that was specially made as a commemorative thank-you gift 
and presented to staff in the womenswear department in the 80s when sales 
reached 500,000.
