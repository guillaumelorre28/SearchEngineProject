Wayne Rooney has named Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> as the key to his 
success this season, saying the winger's quality has been vital in helping him 
reach 26 Premier League goals.

Rooney, this week voted Manchester United's player of the year, said Valencia 
was the team-mate he enjoyed playing alongside most.

"I couldn't have scored the amount of goals I have this season without him," 
Rooney told the BBC's Match of the Day magazine. "He's been great this year and 
the quality of balls he puts in the box for me has been unbelievable."

Rooney added that the goals he enjoyed scoring most this season were those 
with his head. "It's something I've been working on a lot, so I'm really happy 
about that. It just goes to show that the more you practise something, the 
better you get at it."
