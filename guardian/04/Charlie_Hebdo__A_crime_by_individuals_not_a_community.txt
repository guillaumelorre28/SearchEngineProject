The brutal slaughter at the Charlie Hebdo office was nothing but base 
criminality. But it was committed by three men NOT a community – still 
less a religion. What has happened since is that the Muslim community 
as a whole is being charged with collective guilt by association.

I do not recall white Norwegians being asked by the media to scrutinise their 
“values” and beliefs in the same way in 2011 following the murderous rampage by 
the neonazi Anders Behring Breivik, in which he murdered 77 people. Such an 
argument would have been absurd. It is equally absurd to condemn millions of 
people because they happen to be the co-religionists of three brutal murderers.
