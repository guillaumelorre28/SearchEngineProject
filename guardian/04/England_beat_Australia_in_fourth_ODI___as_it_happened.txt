Right, that's it from me

And for the first time since since Cardiff in September, I can sign off on an 
England victory. It has been a long time coming. Thanks for all your emails and 
your company. Stick around on site for the reports and reaction. I'll see you 
later for one of the numerous street parties that will presumably be popping up 
around the country. Cheerio!

Here are the post-match interviews …

George Bailey: "We were outplayed today." The stand-in skipper is smiling, 
though. Laughing. Like it doesn't matter. I'm not sure he's grasped the 
cosmic enormity of this result.

Ben Stokes: "We put a lot of pressure on with the ball … We'll enjoy it while 
we can."

Alastair Cook: "It's been a while since we've had this feeling. All in all it 
was a pretty good performance."

11.21am GMT 

England win by 57 runs

Whisper it, but that was a bit of a hammering. Yes, it's academic in the grand 
scheme of things. And yes, it was a bit of an Australian second string. But 
after this tour any crumb of comfort is to be cherished. And celebrated 
disproportionately. 

11.17am GMT 

England fans: may I suggest this …

Australia fans may also enjoy that. Seeing as it's 3-1 and all.

11.16am GMT 

WICKET!!!! ENGLAND WIN! Pattinson c Buttler b Bresnan 4 (Australia 259 all out)

England have beaten Australia! Repeat: England have beaten Australia!

11.10am GMT 

47th over: Australia 256-9 (Coulter-Nile 5, Pattinson 4) 61 required from 18 
balls

Jordan returns and wangs down a wide. Coulter-Nile steeples one into the dusk 
… Stokes sets himself … this is it … this is it … this is it … um, no it isn't. 
Stokes butterfingers the thing to the turf. And the last goes up towards fine 
leg … this is it … this is it … this is it … um, no it isn't. Ballance 
misjudges the flight. Even in the face of imminent victory England find a way 
to add a touch of comedy incompetence to proceedings. This is a new kind of 
agony.

11.03am GMT 

46th over: Australia 249-9 (Coulter-Nile 2, Pattinson 1) 68 required from 24 
balls

Stokes continues. Coulter-Nile and Pattinson swipe and slash. But the end 
doesn't come just yet.

11.00am GMT 

45th over: Australia 247-9 (Coulter-Nile 2, Pattinson 0) 70 required from 30 
balls

This is a very unfamiliar feeling. Has anyone checked the skies for other 
signs of the apocalypse?

10.59am GMT 

WICKET! Christian c Ballance b Broad 23 (Australia 247-9)

Broad once more. Coulter-Nile aims a hoik to cow corner, but can only edge to 
third man for one. The willow is flashing but Jos Buttler is the busiest 
fielder. And indeed when they do get the ball off the square, it's a miscue 
that flies into the hands of Ballance at third man.  

10.55am GMT 

44th over: Australia 242-8 (Christian 19, Coulter-Nile 2) 75 required from 36 
balls

"Re your request (over 42), I am only to happy to provide you with some 
bunting (Reed, attached

England!"

Updated at 10.58am GMT

10.53am GMT 

WICKET! Johnson b Stokes 6 (Australia 239-8)

Stumps everywhere! Stokes, the adrenaline presumably coursing through his 
veins like the Petawawa rapids, splays the sticks as Johnson heave-hos 
aimlessly.

10.49am GMT 

43rd over: Australia 237-7 (Christian 17, Johnson 6) 80 required from 42 balls

The umpires had a work with Stokes after that wicket. It did sound from the 
pitch mics that shouted something that rhymes with "Shoe Hat!" at Faulkner as 
he departed. Not all that edifying. Unless it actually was "Shoe Hat!", in 
which case it would be confusing more than anything. Anyway Johnson drills a 
Broad full toss to the boundary to keep alive Australia's flickering hopes.

10.44am GMT 

42nd over: Australia 231-7 (Christian 16, Johnson 1) 86 required from 48 balls

Stokes has had another very good day in an England shirt. Three for 32 with 
the ball following up his knock of 70.

10.42am GMT 

WICKET! Faulkner c Buttler b Stokes 2 (Australia 230-7)

Stokes (6-1-27-2) again. Singles again. And a wicket again! Faulkner has a 
swipe and feathers another catch through to Buttler. He departs and with him go 
Australia's realistic hopes. Is 10.40am too late to call a national 
holiday? Has anyone got any bunting? 

10.38am GMT 

41st over: Australia 225-6 (Christian 13, Faulkner 1) 92 required from 54 balls

After 40 overs England were 223-5. Australia are 222-6. England had a Buttler 
bludgeon to come. Can Faulkner match him? Not again surely. Surely.Surely.
 Broad rumbles in and send down a bouncer – that's six balls that Faulkner has 
faced without getting off the mark … and make it seven. From the eighth he 
gently pushes Broad to the cover boundary for one, but it's another superb over 
for England.

10.34am GMT 

40th over: Australia 222-6 (Christian 11, Faulkner 0) 95 required from 60 balls

James Faulkner stalks to the crease. He's wearing his green gear and carrying 
a bat, but it might as well be a cowl and a scythe. Stokes, though, is bowling 
beautifully. "Wicket, dot ball, dot ball, dot ball," as Bumble points out on 
Sky. Add another dot ball to that list. And another. A wicket maiden. A 
tremendous effort from Stokes.

10.30am GMT 

WICKET! Maxwell c Buttler b Stokes 26 (Australia 222-6)

Flat-batted slog. Feather. Pouch. Gone. Open top bus and knighthoods on 
standby.

10.29am GMT 

39th over: Australia 222-5 (Maxwell 26, Christian 11) 95 required from 66 balls

Maxwell top-edges an attempted hook down to third man for a single. Christian 
flicks away a leg bye. A fine stop at fine leg by Joe Root, on as a sub, 
prevents a boundary as Jordan strays too far to leg. Another swipe fails to 
pierce the inner ring. It's all a bit scratchy, there's a hint of desperation 
creeping in, they're not goin… oh, hang on. Christian has just hammered Jordan 
back over his head for a huge six! That was a jaw-droppingly clean hit.

10.22am GMT 

38th over: Australia 211-5 (Maxwell 22, Christian 5) 106 required from 72 balls

Maxwell digs out a Bresnan yorker for a single that takes Australia to the 200 
mark, but the bowler largely cramps the batsmen for space with a very straight 
line. All the deep cover is on the leg side … but Maxwell beats the men on the 
ropes with a pull just backward of square. This line is a little troublesome – 
three wides in the over tell their own story.

Updated at 10.24am GMT

10.17am GMT 

37th over: Australia 199-5 (Maxwell 16, Christian 2) 118 required from 78 balls

Maxwell thwocks Jordan off his hips for the first boundary since the second 
ball of the 32nd over. But he follows it up with a wild, one-legged swipe at 
thin air. Just six from the over.

10.13am GMT 

36th over: Australia 193-5 (Maxwell 11, Christian 1) 124 required from 84 balls

Surely …

10.10am GMT 

WICKET! Finch c Broad b Bresnan 108 (Australia 189-5)

Finch goes! That's the wicket England needed! Bresnan bowled beautifully 
earlier on to put the brakes on Australia's runaway start, but he's not done 
much to earn this breakthrough. Finch looks to chop a short ball away – I think 
he's just looking to dab down to third man rather than loft over the top – but 
the ball plops straight into the hands of Broad on the boundary. A strange way 
to end a very fine innings. 

10.07am GMT 

35th over: Australia 189-4 (Finch 108, Maxwell 8) 128 required from 90 balls

Time for the batting powerplay then. Sound the Statement Of The Bleedin' 
Obvious  klaxon: this is pivotal. Maxwell taps Jordan down to fine leg for a 
couple. There's a leg bye. Then a push into the on side for one. A mistimed 
hoik at the last brings only another single. Powders being kept dry thus far.

10.02am GMT 

34th over: Australia 185-4 (Finch 107, Maxwell 6)

So … 139 required from 102 balls. Finch is, of course, the key but Australia 
bat down to Mitchell Johnson at No9. On any other tour you'd say England were 
overwhelming favourites. Here, now, today? Not so much.  Nine off Broad's over, 
all in ones and twos.

9.56am GMT 

33rd over: Australia 178-4 (Finch 104, Maxwell 2)

Bopara bowls a belter. Four singles and two dots, the last of which is a 
yorker that isthis far away from burrowing its way past Finch's defences.

9.52am GMT 

32nd over: Australia 174-4 (Finch 102, Maxwell 0)

The required rate is 7.94. England have taken wickets at good times. They 
can't? Can they?

9.49am GMT 

WICKET! Smith c Buttler b Broad 19 (Australia 174-4)

Stuart Broad (5-0-30-0 in his opening spell) returns to the attack. Smith 
rocks back and baseball-bats him down the ground for four. But next up he's got 
him with a beauty. It was full, it moved away just a touch, it found the edge, 
and it landed safely in Buttler's hands.

9.46am GMT 

31st over: Australia 169-3 (Finch 101, Smith 15)

Bopora returns with 157 required from 120 balls. Finch dabs him into the leg 
side and sprints through for two runs that take him to his century. It's felt 
like a slightly un-Finch-like innings (not a huge amount of razzle, only a 
soupçon of dazzle, and if anything more control than is perhaps usual) but he's 
still rattled to three figures off only 97 balls. Bopara keeps things tight … 
again until the last ball, which drifts down leg side and is tucked away to 
fine leg for four by Smith.

9.42am GMT 

30th over: Australia 160-3 (Finch 97, Smith 10)

Smith, like Wade before him, can't get the ball away. He's scratching around 
like a chicken with pox (which by the way led me rather randomly tothis video 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpI7Xnln-xw>, which readers of a nervous nature 
may find pleasingly relaxing) … that is until the last ball of Stokes' over, on 
which he pivots and pulls away for six. Superb shot.

9.37am GMT 

29th over: Australia 148-3 (Finch 93, Smith 3)

Finch clips Jordan away for a couple, then drops-and-runs for a single. Cook 
positions himself at slip … and it's almost a masterstoke. Smith slashes a 
drive, edges straight to the England captain, but it drops a yard or so short. 
The Australia No5 has a big hairy, full-fat, spinning hoik at the next but can 
only thick edge the thing into himself. Three from the over. The tourniquet 
tightens …

"I might be a bit late with this, but if I may suggest simply the 'Vincibles', 
as coined by Roland Perry for the English Test side from 1948," writes Andrew 
Benzeval. "His book is a thumping read as well."  




9.32am GMT 

28th over: Australia 145-3 (Finch 90, Smith 3)

Stokes (3-0-9-1) continues. Australia could do with a few big overs, but at 
the moment they can only muster steady accumulation in the main. Five singles 
and a wide from the over.

9.27am GMT 

27th over: Australia 139-3 (Finch 87, Smith 1)

Chris Jordan, who struggled in his opening spell, returns and is back in 
familiar territory with Finch driving exquisitely for four through the covers. 
He's played exceptionally well, but he's being let down somewhat by the men at 
the other end. Smith gets off the mark with a flick to leg. The required rate, 
though, is creeping up towards eight an over.

9.24am GMT 

26th over: Australia 132-3 (Finch 81, Smith 0)

With my email inbox filling up with suggestions of a suitable moniker for this 
England team – I particularly liked Russell Cook's "thrashweary" – it's 
somewhat ironic that England seem to be on their way to what should be a first 
proper victory of the tour.

Updated at 9.24am GMT

9.22am GMT 

WICKET! Bailey c Buttler b Stokes 11 (Australia 132-3)

Yep, he's got a little tickle on it according to Hotspot. Bat then pad … and 
it just carried through to the keeper. Dharmasena raises the finger.

9.19am GMT 

REVIEW! Bailey c Buttler b Stokes 11

Stokes sends one down the leg side. It clips something and flies through to 
Buttler. Umpires says not out. Stokes is convinced. Cook reviews …

9.16am GMT 

25th over: Australia 129-2 (Finch 79, Bailey 10)

Bopara once more and Bailey makes an attempt to break the shackles, clubbing a 
straight drive down the ground for four. Eight off the over in all.

The anything-but-invincibles? "Has to be 'unvincible', surely?" reckons Neil 
Lavery. "Flawful," suggests Paul Laver, rather pleasingly.

9.13am GMT 

24th over: Australia 121-2 (Finch 77, Bailey 4)

Stokes, who batted neatly earlier on without really ever convincing that he's 
the answer as England's No3 in ODIs, continues with the ball. A wide apart, 
it's tidy enough once more.




9.08am GMT 

23rd over: Australia 118-2 (Finch 76, Bailey 3)

Bailey gets off the mark, but that wicket seems to have stymied Australia's 
attempt to go through the gears just as it began. 

"The prospect of losing every match on the tour got me to thinking - what's 
the antonym for 'invincible'?" ponders Dave Adams. "Sadly, a quick google only 
returns things like 'conquerable', 'weak', and 'vulnerable', none of which for 
me reflect the true poverty of England's performances in both forms of the game 
so far.  So suggestions please, for a word to describe a side that lose 100% of 
the time?"

9.05am GMT 

22nd over: Australia 113-2 (Finch 74, Bailey 0)

Ben Stokes into the attack for the first time and it's a tidy enough affair. 
Just three from it.

9.01am GMT 

21st over: Australia 110-2 (Finch 71, Bailey 0)

A wicket maiden from Bopara. Very well bowled.

8.59am GMT 

WICKET! c Cook b Bopara 23 (Australia 110-2)

To no one's great surprise (and to Australia's relief in all likelihood) Wade 
doesn't quite get hold of an attempt to plonk Bopara into stands and holes out 
to Cook to mid off.

8.58am GMT 

20th over: Australia 110-1 (Finch 71, Wade 23)

Finch trots down the pitch to Tredwell but can only drive forcefully to long 
on for one. Wade plays the ball to the same spot (although it's long off for 
his purposes) for another. Then we have one of those strangely graceless ODI 
ballets, with Finch disappearing to the leg side and Tredwell looking to follow 
him. No run. The next is an enormous six. Enormous. Onto the roof at cow 
corner. And he follows it up with another!

8.52am GMT 

19th over: Australia 96-1 (Finch 58, Wade 22)

Ravi Bopara comes into the attack for the first time. Wade swings wildly at 
the first and mistimes it into the turf, but the second is a miserable leg-side 
effort that gets clipped down to the finest of fine legs for four, Wade's first 
boundary. A drive for a single from Finch brings up the 50 partnership (from 72 
balls).

8.49am GMT 

18th over: Australia 90-1 (Finch 57, Wade 17)

Tredwell is bowling very neatly, and concedes only three runs , but Wade is 
killing the buzz of this run chase. For him it hasn't really been a chase at 
all. More of a run-amble. A run-wander. A run-mooch.

8.45am GMT 

17th over: Australia 87-1 (Finch 56, Wade 15)

Bresnan steams in once more. Finch dabs away to bring up his half century, 
rather a two-tone affair and you sense he'll not tolerate this understated mood 
for very long … and indeed from the last ball of the over he goes high over 
Bresnan's head for another six. In a way England shouldn't mind thattoo much – 
it's a sign that they're bowling tightly enough to make him force the issue.

8.40am GMT 

16th over: Australia 77-1 (Finch 49, Wade 12)

"Pity the names aren't Pinch and Wade," rights John Starbuck, "then they could 
be a pair of riverside bandits."The wet bandits? 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7vCYAaD3Mo> Tredwell continues and there's a 
definite sense of frustration creeping into this partnership – Wade has 12 from 
26 balls; Finch had 30 from 24, but now has 49 from 53.

8.37am GMT 

15th over: Australia 74-1 (Finch 47, Wade 11)

More quiet accumulation off Bresnan. If I'm sounding slightly distracted it's 
because Russell Jackson (he of the England innings) is currently tweeting a 
series of quite wonderful Chris Gayle pictures. Such as this:

8.33am GMT 

14th over: Australia 72-1 (Finch 46, Wade 10)

Tredwell again. Finch and Wade (a pair that could almost be some high-end 
gentleman's tailors … "Oooh, I like your tie. Is it from Finch & Wade?") dab, 
tickle and push for a series of ones and twos.

8.31am GMT 

13th over: Australia 67-1 (Finch 45, Wade 6)

With the pressure cranking up Finch, like Sylvester Stallone in a 1987 
arm-wrestling movie <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093692/>, goes over the top. 
Bresnan overpitches a touch and the opener clonks him back over his head for a 
glorious straight six. At the other end, though, Matt Wade is scratching around 
to no great effect.

8.26am GMT 

12th over: Australia 59-1 (Finch 38, Wade 5)

James Tredwell into the attack. There's no turn, but he uses his flight and 
drift cleverly enough to allow only one run from the over. The first six overs: 
46 runs. The next six overs: just 13.

8.23am GMT 

11th over: Australia 58-1 (Finch 37, Wade 5)

Bresnan digs one in short at Wade, who looks to tear the cover off the thing 
with a pull and connects only with fresh Perth air. The fielding team scream an 
appeal for a caught behind, but he was nowhere near it. Bresnan's cracking 
little spell (3-0-6-1) has put Australia under the cosh here – they're dropping 
behind the run rate.

8.19am GMT 

10th over: Australia 56-1 (Finch 36, Wade 4)

The first six overs went for 46. The last three have gone for just six. Broad, 
though, offers Finch the juiciest of short, wide half-trackers and gets thunked 
away square for four.

Updated at 8.19am GMT

8.16am GMT 

9th over: Australia 52-1 (Finch 32, Wade 4)

Finch brings up the Australia 50 with a jogged single and Wade adds a couple 
more to the tally with a little dabbed cut wide of third man. But again that's 
all they get. Bresnan's introduction has changed the tone of this innings 
pretty starkly.

8.12am GMT 

8th over: Australia 49-1 (Finch 31, Wade 2)

Broad continues at the other end. And it's another good 'un, just a couple of 
singles from it.

8.09am GMT 

7th over: Australia 47-1 (Finch 30, Wade 1)

And that's over. Just one from it.

8.08am GMT 

WICKET! Marsh c Bell b Bresnan 15 (Australia 46-1)

What a catch this is! Cook makes his first bowling of the innings, with 
Bresnan replacing the out-of-sorts Jordan. He's not had a great couple of 
months, but his radar is switched on from the off here, and for the first time 
the scorers have to scribble a series of dots in their books. And from the 
penultimate ball of the over he gets his reward. Marsh looks to dab a little 
late cut down to third man but can only edge wide of second slip, where Bell 
takes a superb airborne catch.

8.03am GMT 

6th over: Australia 46-0 (Marsh 15, Finch 30)

"Morning John." Morning Simon McMahon. "For the first time in three months I 
actually forgot about the cricket this morning. And now I've remembered I wish 
I could forget again. Wasn't there a song called something like 'I forgot to 
remember to forget'. That's what this tour has done to me. Thank you England."
Ah, a bit of Elvis <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaqjSCx_3uw>. It provides a 
rather incongruous soundtrack to Finch's latest clubbing drive to the boundary. 
It's a better over from Broad all in all, though, but the batsmen scurry a 
drop-and-run single from the last.

7.59am GMT 

5th over: Australia 40-0 (Marsh 14, Finch 25)

Marsh pulls uppishly over midwicket for a couple then drives hard straight 
to Tredwell at mid on … and through Tredwell's legs and away for four. A shard 
of leather has worked loose from the ball, which is the cue for Jordan to 
completely lose his run up. After a couple of aborted attempts, he does finally 
get to the wicket and ends up delivering from a good yard back of the 
crease. This feels ominously shambolic from an England perspective (although in 
fairness I've had that feeling during pretty much every day's cricket since 
November).
Barney Ronay (@barneyronay) 
Interesting Alastair Cook using the toss to announce he's "desperate" to stay 
as England captain. Often just heads or tails at that point

Updated at 8.01am GMT

7.52am GMT 

4th over: Australia 33-0 (Marsh 14, Finch 18)

Broad skitters backwards and roars an appeal after slapping Finch on the pad. 
It's only missing leg stump by a foot or so, so even for Broad it's an easy 
decision not to review. The next is too short, too wide and carved away square 
for four by Finch. But Broad recovers with the latter part of the over and 
keeps the batsman honest.

7.48am GMT 

3rd over: Australia 27-0 (Marsh 13, Finch 13)

Full, wide, four. Full, straight, four. For, goodness, sake. England need to 
make Australia work for these runs, get themselves ahead of the run rate (a 
required 6.3 an over), and then force the batting side to play a few shots to 
keep up. At the moment Cook's bowlers are allowing them a running start without 
having to force anything.

7.43am GMT 

2nd over: Australia 17-0 (Marsh 12, Finch 4)

Stuart Broad strays onto Shaun Marsh's pads and gets clipped away for a couple 
for his troubles. He follows it up with more full leg-side nonsense and this 
time is whelped away for four. Two balls later there's a full one outside off 
for the batsman to tuck into, though he can only carve the thing through point 
for one.  The fifth is a jaffer that beats the outside edge but the last is 
dabbed neatly down to fine third man for four. Not the start that Broad, or 
England, needed.

7.39am GMT 

1st over: Australia 5-0 (Marsh 0, Finch 4)

Chris Jordan kicks things off with the ball and the home side get off the mark 
with a leg bye. That brings the sporadic wrecking ball that is Aaron Finch on 
strike. He plants a foot down the wicket and carts his second ball at catchable 
height through a gap in the covers in trademark style. The last rips through 
the batsman and slaps him on the pad, but the height strangles the appeal in 
the fielders' throats.

7.23am GMT 

Morning/afternoon/evening all

Every day is a school day. On a personal level, today's lessons include "If 
You're Still In The Pub When Somebody Says 'Right … Bessht Five Albumsshh Of 
All-Time …' Then You've Been There Too Long" and, I'm predicting, several 
rather forceful lectures on The Importance Of Avoiding Fried Chicken Shops Of 
Exceptionally Dubious Provenance". And England seem at last to have learned a 
few things about pacing an ODI innings – the whole 50 overs, Bopara and 
Ballance's stodginess aside, rattled by at a fair pace and gave Buttler just 
enough room to exercise his biff and bash. They should –should – be able to 
defend this, particularly against this experimental Australian side

7.14am GMT 

My take on that finish

Well, Faulkner ended up with 4-67 from his 10 overs but it was a shambolic 
bowling performance by the Aussies in the last 10 overs. Bailey's decision to 
take Maxwell (1-37) off after 9 relatively frugal overs and the call to 
introduce the previously-battered Pattinson for the 49th were both 
head-scratchers. 

Pattinson was all over the shop again and continues to look short of a gallop. 
There is no mistaking the fact that Australia erred in leaving both of Doherty 
and McKay out of the line-up but the bowlers picked also failed to do their 
job. Christian (0-15 off 3) might have bowled a few more overs I 
thought. Johnson was smashed and the rest were erratic at best. 

England started and finished well, though I continue to be puzzled by Gary 
Ballance's presence at four. Surely either of Morgan and Buttler would have 
been better off keeping the momentum going today? The latter was very 
impressive with his 43-ball 71 and Ben Stokes really came out of his shell in 
his 74. 

In summary, England have something decent to bowl to now and Australia carry a 
little bit of pressure to extend this winning streak. England are 
still bricking it though, right?

7.04am GMT 

50th over: England 316-8 (Broad 4, Jordan 0)

Faulkner does indeed bowl the last over and he starts with two dots as Buttler 
elects to retain strike over taking a single. It's a wise move because he biffs 
the third ball over mid wicket for a towering six.  The wickets of Buttler and 
Bresnan follow as the result of attempts at lusty blows, before Broad thumps 
the hat-trick ball through cover for four to finish the innings . That was a 
frenetic finish but England were able to lift themselves close to that 320 mark 
spoken about earlier. 


7.01am GMT 

WICKET! Bresnan 2 c Johnson b Faulkner (England 312-8)

A a mirror-image of the Buttler dismissal, Bresnan puts Faulkner on a 
hat-trick by spraying one high down to Johnson at 3rd man. It was flatter but 
ot the same result. 

6.59am GMT 

WICKET! Buttler 71 (43) c Johnson b Faulkner (England 312-7)

Buttler smashes a six but then goes for one too many, slicing another attempt 
high to 3rd man. A brilliant late-innings cameo.

6.56am GMT 

49th over: England 306-6 (Buttler 65, Bresnan 2)

Bailey makes the slightly mad decision to reintroduce Pattinson for the 49th 
over and first up he's jamming on into Bresnan's finger. That single gets 
Buttler back on strike and unsurprisingly, he tucks into Pattinson's awful pies 
with a pair of fours. Even better is the straight six he thumps off the next 
ball. I told you this was mad...

That last one pushes the England total past 300 as every Australian cricket 
fan slaps a palm across their face. A single off the last ball helps Buttler 
retain the strike and Pattinson thankfully isn't allowed to bowl two overs on 
the trot. That would be ugly. 

Guy Hornsby either wants the 90s back, or doesn't want the 90s back: "Like 
Salt 'n' Pepa, England need to push it here. I'm hoping by the time this 
reaches you we've scalped 40 from the last three overs. The great start we had 
got bogged down again, and we really need 320 here. Buttler staying in means 
possibly, but if he's out we'll struggle. Oh, and there's Morgan. I wonder how 
England will cock this one up? We'll find a way."

close  Salt n Pepa - Push It 
6.51am GMT 

48th over: England 290-6 (Buttler 50, Bresnan 1)

James Faulkner returns to bowl the 48th over and will also possibly to deliver 
the last. Morgan lofts him for six from a top edge but then perishes, so the 
new batsman Bresnan turns a single that allows Buttler to bring up his 
half-century. 


6.48am GMT 

WICKET! Morgan 33 c Christian b Faulkner 33 (England 287-6)

Morgan perishes in pursuit of quick runs, following a six to fine leg by 
smashing one straight at Dan Christian at wide mid-on. Picked the man out 
perfectly there, but he's played his part in resurrecting this late-innings. 

6.44am GMT 

47th over: England 280-5 (Morgan 27, Buttler 47)

Morgan does the team thing and bunts a single off Johnson's first ball, 
allowing Buttler to attack. He promptly clears his leg and flicks a six high 
over square leg. Morgan tries a similar shot himself but only manages two and a 
cheeky smile towards his partner, who is really flying now. 

With that, Johnson's spell over and he's been taken for a wicketless 72 from 
his 10 overs. 

6.39am GMT 

46th over: England 270-5 (Morgan 25, Buttler 39)

Now it is Coulter-Nile copping Buttler's full service, getting hammered 
through mid-wicket for four as result of dropping short. Two balls later he 
brings up the 50-run partnership by smashing a length ball straight and long 
over the long-on boundary and onto a shade cloth protecting fans from the WACA 
heat. It's retrieved by a resourceful fan who then resumes a typical Perth 
pose, double-fisting a couple of beers.

All of a sudden 300 is looking more likely again for the tourists.

6.34am GMT 

45th over: England 258-5 (Morgan 24, Buttler 28)

Johnson's over-opener draws a lusty swing from Buttler but the batsman is 
better when he's taking the orthodox approach shown on the follow-up and 
he plays an attractive cover drive for four. Again the English pair 
identify Faulkner's lumbering at fine leg and so push for two where only one 
should have been available. 

Johnson responds to that frustration by dropping short and Buttler beautifully 
rolls his wrist over a pull shot that races away to the square leg fence. He 
really needs to take the lead for the last 5 overs because he looks more likely 
than Morgan to consistently hit boundaries. 

6.30am GMT 

44th over: England 247-5 (Morgan 24, Buttler 17)

Coulter-Nile is back now and firing one straight at Buttler's ribs. It's 
called a wide which might have been harsh given it almost clipped the batsman's 
shirt. Umpire Dharmasena might have just been irked by Wade's resultant appeal 
for caught behind, I guess.

Coulter-Nile is incensed once a subsequent bouncer is also called a wide and 
Buttler has to swivel and pull to deep mid-wicket from his next throat ball. 
Otherwise both batsman are industriously nudging singles but they're going to 
need to clear the ropes in the last five overs if this total is to creep 
towards a par score.

6.23am GMT 

43rd over: England 240-5 (Morgan 22, Buttler 14)

Johnson returns to the attack for his 8th over and is short and fast, forcing 
Buttler to swat one down to fine leg. The left-arm quick then fires one so far 
wide down the leg-side that not even Matthew Wade can justify the charade of 
going up for a tactical appeal. Buttler then slams a welcome boundary through 
cover with some exceptional placement. 

6.18am GMT 

42nd over: England 230-5 (Morgan 21, Buttler 6)

After Buttler works two off his pads, Faulkner is bowling the 8016th wide of 
this Australian innings. I jest of course, it's only the 13th. That's still 
pretty bad.

6.13am GMT 

41st over: England 226-5 (Morgan 21, Buttler 3)

Coulter-Nile is trying to tighten the screws on the new man now and it's not 
until the third delivery of the over that Buttler is able to squirrel away a 
single to fine leg. Morgan then picks up two down to a diving Faulkner at third 
man. 

Meanwhile, her is an interesting offer for John Inverarity to consider:

6.10am GMT 

40th over: England 223-5 (Morgan 19, Buttler 2)

Thankfully for England, Morgan keeps doing his thing and here he is hooking 
Faulkner through fine leg for a boundary to move to 18.  Buttler is pushing 
singles to keep things moving. Using a complex algorithm I refuse to disclose, 
I predict an English total of 304. 

6.06am GMT 

39th over: England 216-5 (Morgan 14, Buttler 0)

Morgan gets going by driving Coulter-Nile's half-volley to the cover boundary. 
The bowler threw his head back in frustration after that slip-up but Bopara's 
dismissal puts England in more trouble here. Jos Buttler is the next man in and 
will need to stick around with Morgan if England are to post an imposing total.


Updated at 6.08am GMT

6.05am GMT 

WICKET! Bopara c sub (Doherty) b Coulter-Nile 3 (England 216-5)

Gone! Bopara pulls rashly, sending his miscue high and straight to the 
dub-fielder Doherty at mid-on. A terrible stroke with 10 overs left in this 
innings. 

6.00am GMT 

38th over: England 211-4 (Morgan 9, Bopara 3)

Bopara puts pressure on the field now to force a quick singles and maybe I was 
being harsh on Heals because that commentary box appeal might have had some 
merit. There was definitely a noise. Another slower ball from Faulkner is 
played uppishly through cover by Morgan and just sort of George Bailey's 
fingers. 

5.57am GMT 

37th over: England 207-4 (Morgan 7, Bopara 1)

Coulter-Nile is tight to Bopara first up and it's not until the fifth delivery 
of the over that the new man gets off the mark with a single to mid-wicket. 
"And that's edged!" says Ian Healy of the next delivery to Morgan. It's not, 
obviously, and doesn't even warrant appeal. Australia will now look to strangle 
this partnership and try to keep this total under 300. 

5.55am GMT 

36th over: England 206-4 (Morgan 7, Bopara 0)

The Stokes dismissal brings Bopara to the crease with the other new batsman. 


5.52am GMT 

WICKET! Stokes c Wade b Faulkner 70 (England 206-4)

Oh no. Just when England were set to launch towards that aforementioned total, 
Stokes has perished to a slower ball from Faulkner, skying it high and straight 
into the gloves of Wade. An inopportune dismissal for the tourists to say the 
least. 

5.47am GMT 

35th over: England 199-3 (Stokes 69, Morgan 1)

Coulter-Nile is back on now to replace Johnson and there are some selection 
decisions that really need discussing. Surely Doherty and McKay should have 
played for Australia and surely Morgan shouldn't be batting at five behind 
Ballance. Bumble says Morgan prefers his current position but I doubt it's best 
for the team, really. 

Caroline Pearce is keeping realistic about England's projected total and says, 
"I think 1600 runs may be just enough even for England to win a game." Hang in 
there Caroline. On the other hand, Adam Wilkinson is all over my typo from a 
couple of overs back: "Just tuned in. Please, please, please let us be 1671-2."

Stokes finishes the over with a crisp drive for four. 

5.42am GMT 

34th over: England 193-3 (Stokes 64, Morgan 0)

As ever, Eoin Morgan shapes as a major obstacle for Australia. Ballance took 
30 balls to edge his way to 30 and Morgan's entry with 16 overs left might be 
just what's required to lift the total north of 320.

5.39am GMT 

WICKET! Ballance c Smith b Pattinson 18 (England 190-3)

Right as I start talking totals, Ballance goes, skying a short one from 
Pattinson high and into the waiting hands of Steve Smith at short cover. 

5.36am GMT 

33rd over: England 189-2 (Stokes 60, Ballance 18)

Just in case things weren't already dismal enough for visting English fans 
this summer, Nine now run some highlights of Paul Nixon's 06/07 tour of 
ODI duty. Bizarrely, Bailey yanks Maxwell out of the attack after 9 overs and 
replaces him with Johnson, who is duly smoked through mid-wicket and to the 
boundary rope by Stokes.

I think it might be time to start talking totals. Anything less than 320 is a 
failure from here I reckon. 350 should be the aim though. George Bailey will 
certainly have his hands full restricting it to any less with most of his 
bowlers putting in such shockers.

5.30am GMT 

32nd over: England 182-2 (Stokes 54, Ballance 17)

Shaun Marsh is in the action again now as Stokes drives a low half-volley at 
the diving fielder at mid-wicket. A couple of Aussies think it's out but 
replays show they are very much mistaken. Pattinson is back on and Ballance 
soon edges him streakily through the vacant cordon for a boundary. It's a mixed 
bag from the paceman but not his worst over of the day. These things are 
relative, you see. 

5.26am GMT 

31st over: England 177-2 (Stokes 52, Ballance 13)

Ballance looks more comfortable by the over here and moves around his crease 
to push Maxwell for a single. Stokes is then playing with an almost 
wood-chopping motion to try and belt the offie through cover but can't get it 
past Smith at extra cover. 

5.23am GMT 

30th over: England 174-2 (Stokes 52, Ballance 12)

Faulkner's over starts with a bit of kamikaze running from English pair but 
Coulter-Nile is unable to throw the stumps down from the quick single. Ballance 
had given up on that and would have been out by a safe distance. That single 
and one to Ballance himself are the only scores from Faulkner's improved over. 

5.19am GMT 

29th over: England 172-2 (Stokes 51, Ballance 11)

Maxwell continues for his eighth over and he's really raced through them so 
far. After a single to Ballance, Maxwell drifts down the leg side and not even 
a theatrically attempted stumping by Wade can avoid a wide call. That is 
nothing compared with the sight of Stokes dancing down the wicket and belting 
Maxwell over the sightscreen for six to bring up his 50. It came from 58 
deliveries and is really keeping this England total chugging along. 

Updated at 5.21am GMT

5.16am GMT 

28th over: England 163-2 (Stokes 44, Ballance 10)

Now it's the turn of James Faulkner to try and pull his bowling figures out of 
the fire. 21 cam from his opening two overs and he starts much the same, lucky 
to get away with a short, wide one and then a short, straight one. 
Stokes cross-bats both of them straight at fieldsmen. He runs a single towards 
third man off the penultimate delivery of the over and even after Ballance does 
the same, the bowler gets off lightly for an ordinary start to the spell.

I can't say I disagree with Rudi Edsall's sentiments here: "Now I'm no 
international cricket captain, but I feel Bailey have may have missed a trick 
here by sending the Poms in. Did the WACA's reputation precede itself or did it 
look like a good bowling wicket? England seem to be making some serious hay 
here."

5.13am GMT 

27th over: England 161-2 (Stokes 43, Ballance 9)

Stokes decides he is sick of paying Maxwell's spin any respect and swats a a 
lofted boundary off the opening delivery before he and Balance chip it around 
for a string of singles around the ground. 

5.11am GMT 

26th over: England 154-2 (Stokes 37, Ballance 8)

Christian continues and is immediately lofted over mid-wicket by an 
adventurous Ballance. He and Stokes then milk four singles from Christian's 
gentle mediums.

5.08am GMT 

25th over: England 148-2 (Stokes 35, Ballance 4)

Wade is calling Maxwell "Manuel" now, which is terribly distracting when 
you're half-listening to Tom Moody's commentary.

24th over: England 146-2 (Stokes 34, Ballance 3)

Christian gets in on the act and starts his second over with a wide (there was 
one in his first too - this really had been some dire bowling by Australia). 
Christian is grunting, grimacing and generally trying to impose himself on the 
England pair but bowls his third wide in the space of ten deliveries before 
drawing Ballance forward and nearly edging off the over's final ball.

Updated at 5.08am GMT

5.00am GMT 

23rd over: England 142-2 (Stokes 33, Ballance 2)

Glenn Maxwell returns to the attack now and Ballance is on the back foot and 
bunting him for a single through cover. Stokes finishes the over by 
cross-batting Maxwell to deep cover for two. 

Updated at 5.08am GMT

4.57am GMT 

22nd over: England 139-2 (Stokes 31, Ballance 1)

Dan Christian's first over is the circuit-breaker for Australia, nipping a 
50-partnership in the bud and bringing Gary Ballance to the crease with Stokes .

Updated at 4.59am GMT

4.56am GMT 

WICKET! Bell c Faulkner b Christian 55 (England 138-2)

Well Bell and Stokes were continuing the misery for the Aussies there but like 
Cook, Bell gets out completely against the flow of play by lofting his leg 
glance off the new bowler Dan Christian straight to James Faulkner on the rope 
at short fine leg.

4.51am GMT 

21st over: England 134-1 (Bell 53, Stokes 30)

Replays confirm that Bell thought he was out after skying that one out towards 
Pattinson. It was a definite misjudgment from the fieldsman. Things get worse 
for the Aussies in the new over when Marsh can't hang on to a high but very 
catchable chance off Bell. Everything seems to be going England's way today and 
the Aussies have been ordinary in the field.

Meanwhile, Stokes flicks an elegant boundary off his legs which is the scoring 
shot that seems to be playing on a loop so far today. Incredibly, Marsh drops 
another diving catch to finish the over and this time it's Stokes that gets the 
reprieve. 




4.46am GMT 

20th over: England 125-1 (Bell 52, Stokes 22)

Coulter-Nile continues and Pattinson is even managing to have a mare in the 
field, coming in too far towards Bell's lofted drive and watching it fly over 
his head and bounce once over the boundary. That brings up Bell's half-century 
in very unconventional cicrumstances. Pattinson wasn't right on the boundary to 
start with but should have swallowed that one.  

4.42am GMT 

19th over: England 120-1 (Bell 48, Stokes 21)

Mitchell Johnson returns for his second spell and all of a sudden his 0-14 
from 3 overs doesn't look so bad after all. England are still going at 6.33 an 
over, even with Maxwell tying down the other end. Johnson swings one away from 
Stokes and the Englishman can't get anywhere near it but manages to keep out a 
fuller, straighter yorker next up.

The paceman then forces a thick outside edge but it falls short of Shaun Marsh 
at first slip.  Stokes marks the reprieve with a two out to the mid-wicket 
boundary and I'm starting to think the slips cordon was far too deep there. I'd 
be a great captain with that kind of strategic insight. They are very deep 
though. Stokes finishes the over with three to the cover boundary. 

4.36am GMT 

18th over: England 115-1 (Bell 48, Stokes 16)

Coulter-Nile starts brightly after the break, jamming one up around Bell's 
arm-pit. He moves off strike by running a single down to third man and then 
Coulter-Nile shapes one away from the outside edge of Stokes. Nine say it moved 
1.6 degrees, which doesn't read as impressive as it looked. 

After a single to Stoked Bell gets forward and lifts a very effective drive 
over mid-off for a boundary to finish the over. 

4.30am GMT 

17th over: England 109-1 (Bell 43, Stokes 15)

Maxwell continues to Stokes and is varying his pace well. Stokes narrowly 
avoids chopping onto his stumps from a reverse-I-don't-know-what and singles to 
he and Bell are the only scores from another tight Maxwell over. As the teams 
take drinks, Australia would want to be coming up with something more inspiring 
than that opening 17 overs. 

Updated at 4.33am GMT

4.28am GMT 

16th over: England 107-1 (Bell 42, Stokes 14)

Pattinson's pitch map confirms what we're seeing with our own eyes and looks 
like the beginnings a particularly messy piece of conceptual art. There are 
dots on every imaginable line and length. Clint McKay sits with his feet up on 
the boundary and must wonder what he's done wrong to miss out today. He was 
Australia's one-day player of the year last year and his stats put him among 
Australia's 50 over greats. What gives? 

A leading edge from Stokes comes after four balls of consistent pressure from 
Coulter-Nile, whose over is in stark contrast to Pattinson's struggles.  The 
resultant single is the only score of an excellent over. 

4.24am GMT 

15th over: England 106-1 (Bell 42, Stokes 13)

As Maxwell continues, I'm again thinking about the merits of even picking 
Pattinson in this series. Sure he needed some kind of warm-up for the upcoming 
South African series but he's bowling like a drain. A Steve Finn-like tour 
might await him at this rate.

Maxwell bowls tidily, conceding four runs in a snappy over but Ben Stokes is 
off the mark much faster than in Sydney and pushing for runs from every ball.

4.22am GMT 

14th over: England 102-1 (Bell 41, Stokes 10)

Pattinson's tale of woe continues from the first delivery here. Bell chips it 
straight at shoulder height for another boundary, though it wasn't without its 
risks that shot. Stokes then tries to get in on the act by throwing his entire 
body at a cover drive but Pattinson swings it past his outside edge and through 
to Wade behind the stumps. 

Stokes then turns another straight one around the corner for two and finishes 
the over with a crisp straight drive for four wide of mid-on. Pattinson is 
falling apart a little bit here. It's almost painful to watch.

4.18am GMT 

13th over: England 91-1 (Bell 36, Stokes 4)

Stokes enters at three again and immediately sweeps Maxwell for four through 
square leg. Still, the part-timer has well and truly done his job in that over, 
grabbing a wicket where one seemed unlikely otherwise.  Now for some support 
from the other end...

4.16am GMT 

WICKET! Cook b Maxwell 44 (England 87-1)

Maxwell draws Cook forward with a forceful drive but all he can manage to 
do is drag it onto his stumps. That's an important wicket for the Aussies 
because the match was slipping away at a rapid rate there. 

4.13am GMT 

12th over: England 87-0 (Cook 44 Bell 36)

Pattinson returns for his second spell and immediately draws an edge from Bell 
but it flies half a metre to the right of the lone slip, Shaun Marsh. The 
bowler reverts to type (well, recent type) and sprays the second delivery down 
the leg side for another wide and the next one would have been too if Bell 
hadn't deposited it over mid-wicket for four. It's the 14th boundary of the 
innings so far.

In lieu of the absent Xavier Doherty, Bailey calls upon occasional off-spinner 
Glenn Maxwell to at least try and stop this onslaught. Bell gives his partner 
the strike with a casual single through mid-wicket but with only three runs 
from the over, Maxwell has applied some rare pressure in that over. 

4.06am GMT 

10th over: England 73-0 (Cook 42 Bell 25)

Now Cook pulls forcefully off the bowling of Coulter-Nile and Christian can 
only dive in vain at square leg as the ball races away to the boundary. A very 
un-Cook lofted drive then sails through the vacant mid-off region for four and 
the carnage continues. 

4.02am GMT 

9th over: England 65-0 (Cook 34 Bell 25)

Tom Moody is calling this a "ragged" performance from Australia and he's not 
wrong. Faulkner can only watch as Bell sends two lofted drives sailing over his 
head for boundaries and I think George Bailey might now be regretting his 
decision to have a bowl. 

3.58am GMT 

8th over: England 55-0 (Cook 33 Bell 16)

That thinking I mentioned has resulted in Pattinson being given time to cool 
off and re-calibrate, so Nathan Coulter-Nile marks out his run for the first 
time today. After conceding a single to Bell, he bowls a wide of his own with a 
trampolining bouncer that Cook was unable to lay bat on and then gets murdered 
through point by Cook's uppish cut shot. Not once, but twice. The second was 
sublime, hit lower and flatter forward of the man at point. 

Sadly for the bowler, none of Cook's shot are as sublime as the last, which he 
clatters through cover for another four. 14 came from that over and the Aussies 
are under fire here.

3.53am GMT 

7th over: England 41-0 (Cook 21 Bell 15)

Bailey wisely decides that this bowling performance needs an immediate 
shake-up so Faulkner is on to replace Johnson. The fiery all-rounder receives a 
very unlucky wide call as Cook moves across his stumps and the following two 
deliveries are pulled wide of mid-wicket for two and four, respectively. 

Cook is then walking across his stumps again and calmly lifting Faulkner over 
square leg for another four in what is turning out to be an expensive opening 
over. Bailey has some thinking to do here.

6th over: England 30-0 (Cook 11 Bell 15)

From the first ball of the over Wade is appealing in a frankly appalling 
manner to what surely even he didn't see as an edge from Ian Bell's mistimed 
drive. Replays indicate Bell was a long way from making contact with the low 
full toss and that really was a terrible appeal. It's actually been an 
unfortunate hallmark of his season in domestic cricket too. 

Pattinson gives Bell too much width with his penultimate delivery and the 
batsman slashes a square drive over point and to the boundary. He then chips 
another sand wedge over Pattinson's head for two. 

Updated at 3.59am GMT

3.45am GMT 

5th over: England 24-0 (Cook 11 Bell 9)

Bell starts with a gutsy inside-out chip over mid-off for three and then Cook 
whips a further two on the on side due to Johnson having strayed onto his pads 
again. The line of both these opening bowlers has been consistently awful so 
far, either too straight or straying down leg side to the English opening pair. 

To a short one outside off stump, Cook swishes across the line but can't make 
contact and a similar stroke from the next ball flies over gully for a streaky 
boundary. He went hard and got enough on it to be safe. Otherwise he and Bell 
have failed to cash in on a truly ropey opening spell from the Aussie bowlers. 

3.40am GMT 

4th over: England 15-0 (Cook 5 Bell 6)

After a single to Cook, Bell moves down the pitch to Pattinson and flashes 
hard at it, with the resultant edge flying wide and high of the cordon for 
four. Pattinson also takes one away from Cook, narrowly missing the outside 
edge again.

In the break between balls Nine are showing highlights of Glenn Maxwell's 
fielding and it's hard not to see parallels between his and Ricky Ponting's 
diving and throwing styles from point. Now for the batting...

3.36am GMT 

3rd over: England 9-0 (Cook 4 Bell 1)

Bell is off the mark by dropping a quick single off his pads and Cook follows 
suit by angling one down to fine leg himself. In both instances, Johnson seems 
to have caught Pattinson's yips, pitching on the wrong side to both members of 
the left-hand/right-hand combination.

Sarah Bacon likes the father-son connection in that 1987 clip: "Interesting to 
scroll through the list of players for the 1987 game and note that Chris Broad 
and Swampy Marsh both took part! "

Meanwhile, Bell thinks he has four through the covers but Steve Smith reels it 
in with a magnificent diving save. Smith really is an excellent limited overs 
player to have on the fringe of this side.

3.31am GMT 

2nd over: England 7-0 (Cook 3 Bell 0)

Somewhat surprisingly given the way he bowled in Sydney, James Pattinson is on 
to partner Johnson, so Coulter-Nile will have to cool his heels for now. He 
starts positively but it falls apart quickly. He strays down the leg side with 
his third delivery, which is a wide. He's swinging the new ball prodigiously 
but sending it all over the shop with four wides in the space of five 
deliveries. 

For now he wears a smile and even draws a false shot from Cook on his fifth 
legal delivery. The ball ballooned up and fell just short of Bailey fielding 
close in at mid-on, but otherwise it was another bad start for the paceman. 
He's showing his lack of match practice in the early stages of this comeback.

3.24am GMT 

1st over: England 3-0 (Cook 3 Bell 0)

Johnson takes the new ball for Australia from the Prindiville Stand end and 
has two slips in place to Alastair Cook . He's right on the money with his 
first ball, which is straight and forces Cook forward in defence. The crowd ooh 
and ahh as the next moves away from Cook's outside edge at serious pace before 
the skipper turns to fine leg for a single. Well, it would have been a single, 
but Coulter-Nile's thow is a direct hit and flies away for an additional two 
overthrows.

I'll also just take the opportunity to mention how rubbish England's red kit 
is. That Botham video only emphasizes the chasm in both uniform quality and 
cricketing output when you compare England in 13/14 to England in 86/87.

Johnson gets some steepling bounce over Bell and then goes close to an outside 
edge to finish the over.

3.08am GMT 

A streak of a different kind

Just in case you were wondering, England hasn’t beaten Australia in a Perth 
ODI since the‘Perth Challenge’ of New Year’s Day 1987 
<http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65909.html>, when Botham gave 
Simon Davis a whole lot of tap and Australia failed to qualify for the finals 
of a tournament created purely as a celebration of itself.

3.05am GMT 

Speaking of drought-breakers…

Andy Wilson has the latest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/nicole-bolton-australia-england-ashes>
 on the Southern Stars’ breakthrough ODI win in Melbourne. Debutant Nicole 
Bolton was the star for the Aussies, and helped delay England’s Ashes 
celebrations with 124 from 152 balls in Australia’s 266. England fell 26 runs 
short in reply.

Andy also has a tribute to England all-rounder Graham Stevenson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/yorkshire-england-graham-stevenson-dies-cricket>
, who has sadly passed away at the age of 58, plus some detail on the
deportation of three British cricket journalists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/australia-visa-regulations-british-journalists-cricket>
, whose 90-day visas are set to expire. A cursory glance at the publications 
affected can at least rule out another Courier Mail plot, I guess.

Meanwhile, Mark Taylor says that the breeze coming across the WACA should 
benefit the swing of Johnson and Faulkner from the Prindiville Stand end, so 
look out for that.

Other updates - Saker telling it like it is

The ICC imbroglio aside, it’s still been a big week for both countries. Jos 
Buttler says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/england-jos-buttler-avoid-record-losing-streak-ashes>
 that England are desperate to avoid avoid the ignominy of defeats in every 
international, saying “it’s not a tag anyone would like.”Barney Ronay has this 
missive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/david-saker-england-bowling-coach-tour-australia>
 on David Saker’s brutal honesty, “an excpetion to [the] corporate omerta” seen 
elsewhere in England’s ranks. "I feel very responsible for what has happened," 
Saker said.

"I'll be the first to say that anyone on this tour should be worried about 
their job. This has been a poor performance from everyone involved. I'm sure 
they will review everyone's position and if they see fit to change me, well 
that is their position."

The Toss and teams

Bailey wins the toss and elects to bowl. "It's a bit tacky under foot," he 
says of the pitch.

Smith, Wade, Johnson and Bailey come into the line-up.

Australia: Finch, Marsh, Wade, Bailey, Smith, Maxwell, Christian, Christian, 
Faulkner, Johnson, Coulter-Nile, Pattinson.

"We've gotta concentrate on this next 100 overs and try and put in a better 
performance, says England captain Alastair Cook. "I'm desperate to carry on," 
he says of the captaincy debate and then indicates England will enter the game 
with an unchanged line-up.

England: Cook, Bell, Stokes, Ballance, Morgan, Bopara, Buttler, Bresnan, 
Broad, Jordan, Tredwell

Afternoon all

Well, this England side is on the verge of 10 successive international defeats 
today at the WACA, not to mention the now well-established fact that they’ve 
been beaten in every international match of the Australian summer. I guess an 
optimist would say that the only way is up and a pessimistic might just let out 
a sad, broken whimper before pulling the covers back over their head and trying 
to sleep through the horror.

Australian skipper and recently-named ODI player of the year George Bailey has 
been declared fit to play, while Michael Clarke, David Warner and Brad Haddin 
sit back and have a rest. Replacing them in the squad are Steve Smith, Mitchell 
Johnson and Matthew Wade. Australia are also now officially the top-ranked ODI 
team in the world thanks to India’s loss to New Zealand on Wednesday. If they 
lose today it’s all over though – shunted back to second place within two days. 
Why didn’t they make the most of it and spend yesterday parading through Perth 
in an open-top bus?

2.46am GMT 

Russell will be here before long to see if England can find another 
imaginative way to lose, or whether the tide of the summer will improbably turn 
in the fourth ODI of the series. In the meantime, here's a brief reminder of 
how the last one went:

"A lot has happened in two weeks," Alastair Cook said after a comprehensive 
seven-wicket defeat at the SCG. "We've kept losing games of cricket and I 
haven't been able to turn it round." Cook will at least stay in place for the 
final two matches of a chastening series that has left England one match away 
from equalling their worst losing streak of 10 successive defeats, with the 
chance to set a new personal worst in Adelaide in the final match.

For now it was a case of another week, another ground, another series lost at 
the SydneyCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. England 
have already been out-batted and out-bowled by Australia on this tour. Here, by 
way of variation, they were comprehensively and aggressively out-fielded. In 
the end Australia's batsmen made laughably light work of their run chase, 
reeling in England's 243 with 10 overs to spare.

But in a way Australia's victory was most notable for their performance in the 
field, with Michael Clarke and Dan Christian taking spectacular one-handed 
catches to get rid of Ben Stokes and Eoin Morgan respectively. Perhaps the most 
telling moment came in the first over of Australia's reply. David Warner, who 
had earlier run out Ian Bell with a kind of one-stump miracle-throw from deep 
point, had given up on making his ground as Ravi Bopara prepared to hurl down 
the stumps. Bopara did not even get close. England's shoulders sagged. Warner 
went on to clout a gleefully dismissive 71.
