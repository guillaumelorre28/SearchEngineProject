Rangers' administrators will meet the manager, Ally McCoist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ally-mccoist>, and the players on 
Thursday.

They claim at this stage that there will be "no immediate cuts in the playing 
staff" but there will be a review of all staff in due course.

The financial advisory and investment banking firm Duff and Phelps took 
control of the Scottish champions on Tuesday after the club was forced into 
administration over an unpaid tax bill of £9m, accrued since Craig Whyte took 
control ofRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> in May last 
year.

A spokesman said: "Paul will be outlining the administration process. There 
will be a review of staff, including playing staff. That will take its course."

The spokesman also said players had not been asked to play without being paid.

Rangers – who were immediately docked 10 points by the Scottish Premier League 
and now sit 14 points behind the leaders Celtic – are also awaiting the verdict 
of a tax tribunal which could leave them with a bill of as much as £75m, 
according to Whyte.

On Wednesday administrators told fans they can be reassured that Rangers will 
continue as a football club.

They also said they hope to reach a stage "as soon as possible" where the club 
can emerge from administration.

The joint administrators Clark and David Whitehouse said in a statement: "We 
can report we have made very good progress within the first 24 hours of being 
appointed administrators over Rangers Football Club.

"In broad terms, supporters can be reassured that Rangers will continue as a 
football club and we hope to reach a stage as soon as possible where the club 
can emerge from administration."
