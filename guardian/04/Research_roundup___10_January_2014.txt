Scientists have revealed the colour scheme of an extinct marine animal 
<http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2014/jan/14_05.shtml> using 
fossilised skin pigment from ancient reptiles. Previously, they could only 
guess what colours huge reptiles had. Gareth Dyke, senior lecturer in 
vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Southampton, one of the 
scientists who made the discovery, says: "The most sensational aspect of the 
investigation is that it can now be established that these ancient marine 
reptiles were, at least partially, dark-coloured in life, something that 
probably contributed to more efficient thermoregulation, as well as providing 
means for camouflage and protection against harmful UV radiation." Per Uvdal, 
co-author of the study, says: "Our discovery enables us to make a journey 
through time and to revisit these ancient reptiles using their own 
biomolecules. Now, we can finally use sophisticated molecular and imaging 
techniques to learn what these animals looked like and how they lived." Ancient 
marine life such as ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs died out during the Cretaceous 
period, but leatherback turtles are still around today. Their almost entirely 
black back could be a reason for their survival, as it enables them to heat up 
faster and reach higher body temperatures than if they had been lightly 
coloured.

Scientists have discovered a new way to study the mechanisms that cause breast 
cancer cells to spread 
<http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2013/12-December/Breakthrough-scientists-discover-novel-way-to-study-the-spread-of-secondary-breast-cancer.aspx>
 to the bone. Although more women than ever before are surviving breast cancer, 
1,000 UK women are still dying from the disease each month. The majority of 
these deaths are caused by the metastatic form, also known as secondary breast 
cancer. Recent discoveries have shown that metastasis (the process of cancer 
cells leaving the breast and spreading to other parts of the body) may occur 
early during the development of the disease, with tumour cells moving around 
the body before invading tissues and remaining dormant until awakened later on. 
Andrew Tutt, unit director, says: "We have created a new experimental model 
that can be used to chart forms of tumour cell dormancy. Our model successfully 
recreates the conditions that cause metastatic breast cancer cells to reside in 
the bone and become dormant enabling us to learn more about, and ultimately 
hope to prevent, the progression of metastatic breast cancer."

Scientists say the resurrection of extinct animals 
<http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-highlight-the-resurrection-of-extinct-animals-as-both-a-strong-possibility-and-a-major>
, such as the woolly mammoth and passenger pigeon, is a strong possibility. 
William Sutherland, in the department of zoology, says: "There has been 
discussion of this idea for some time but it is now looking more practical and 
the idea is being taken seriously." There are concerns, however, that such a 
high-profile project could lead to attention and resources being diverted from 
attempts to thwart current threats to non-extinct species' survival. Sutherland 
adds: "A key issues is whether this is really a conservation priority." Though 
the last woolly mammoth died around 4000 years ago, methods such as 
back-breeding, cloning and genetic engineering may lead to their resurrection. 
Not only could these extinct animals, and others such as the thylacine and the 
passenger pigeon, be reconstructed and returned to their native environments, 
they could potentially be used to "provide tools for outreach and education".

Video gaming can distort your vision 
<http://www.ntu.ac.uk/apps/news/152028-15/Study_shows_how_video_gamers_experience_altered_visual_perceptions_after_pl.aspx>
 and perception of real life objects, research shows. In a study, gamers 
reported seeing video game menus popping up in front their eyes when they were 
in a conversation, or saw coloured images and displays when driving on the 
motorway after they had stopped playing. "Some gamers may be more susceptible 
than others to experience Game Transfer Phenomena (GTP)," says Mark Griffiths, 
director of the International Gaming Research Unit. "The effects of these 
experiences appear to be short-lived, but some gamers experience them 
recurrently. More research is needed to understand the cognitive and 
psychological implications of GTP." The findings also raise questions about the 
effects of the exposure to certain visual effects used in video games.

German speaking Jewish intellectuals, many of whom met in the coffee houses of 
Berlin, Vienna and Prague, were among thefirst to see their identity as European
 <http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=11339>, finds literary 
and film scholar Cathy Gelbin. "Rather than sidelining this important 
contribution, as has been the case in recent public discussions, perhaps the 
time has come for their role to be recognised," says Gelbin. "Even before the 
onset of Nazism, German-speaking Jews were seen as either too assimilated on 
the one hand, but too international on the other. This anti-Semitism, in all 
but name, had a profound effect on the community, rejecting the accepted 
definition of their own German and Austrian identities." She adds: "Jewish 
Zionists called for a separate homeland, whereas others insisted their identity 
was not merely Jewish or German, but one beyond ethnicity and national 
borders." The study revealed a remarkable culture of cosmopolitanism, which 
despite the onslaught of Nazism, has survived into modern times.

Local authorities say placing children in residential care far from home can 
help stop risky behaviour <http://www.ioe.ac.uk/newsEvents/94922.html>, such as 
child sexual exploitation, offending behaviour, and involvement with gangs and 
guns. Charlie Owen, from the Institute of Education, says: "A number of reports 
have expressed concern over the vulnerability of teenage girls being placed in 
children's homes a long way from their communities. We found that local 
authorities accounted for out of area placements in terms of either meeting 
specialist needs or to move children from the local area to break the cycle of 
risky behaviour. However, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of these 
children a long way from home."
