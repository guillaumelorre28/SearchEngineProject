Bonnie and Clyde <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bonnie-and-clyde> may have 
gone out in a hail of bullets and balletic violence, but its creator received a 
more sober, respectful send off as the Oscars paid tribute to director Arthur 
Penn. The American film-maker was honoured at the Academy Awards for a body of 
work that includes The Chase, Alice's Restaurant, Little Big Man, Night Moves 
and The Missouri Breaks.

Yet Penn, who died last September, aged 88, will best be remembered for Bonnie 
and Clyde, his freewheeling 1967 gangster picture that starred Faye Dunaway and 
Warren Beatty.
