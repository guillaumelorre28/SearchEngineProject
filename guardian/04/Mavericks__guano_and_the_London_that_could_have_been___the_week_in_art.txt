Michelangelo invented conceptual art; he was famous in his time for his 
“divine concepts” – the ideas behind his works, as opposed to their execution. 
This is a case in point – a full-sized design for a painting he never executed, 
but instead let his pupil Ascanio Condivi paint. It is an obscure and erudite 
work about the supposed siblings of Christ, yet Michelangelo’s marvellous 
shading makes it sublime.
