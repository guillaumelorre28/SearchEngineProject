 Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo  
<http://www.peacocktheatre.com/whats-on/les-ballets-trockadero-de-monte-carlo-the-trocks/>

The all-male Trocks remain one of the class acts of ballet, their comic 
parodies fizzing with wit, slapstick and a fanatical attention to style. Men in 
tutus and size-12 shoes evoke some of the great ballerinas from history, as 
well as dancing their princely partners. Featured in this UK tour are extracts 
from familiars like Swan Lake, less well-known works like Go for Barocco (the 
Trocks’ blissful Balanchine satire), and a Don Quixote that promises to 
brilliantly max up the swagger of Petipa’s classic.

 Hofesh Shechter: Barbarians  
<http://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2015/hofesh-shechter-company-barbarians/>

Hofesh Shechter’s new trilogy is about love – its anxieties and banalities, as 
well as its passions. Its opening section was premiered last year, and 
contrasted the rigours of classical structure with the raw physicality of its 
dancers and a recorded confession by Shechter of the traumas of his midlife 
crisis. The two concluding parts promise their own different emotional worlds, 
moving through dubstep and harsh urban moves to a duet of quirky accommodation. 
Shechter’s choreography is currently passing through a self-questioning phase; 
his dancers, though, are reliably superb.

Artistic director Christopher Hampson is notching up an interestingly varied 
repertory. In Motion of Displacement – a new, family-themed work that’s set to 
music by John Adams and Bach – he introduces the young American choreographer 
Bryan Arias to the UK. Company dancer Sophie Laplane makes her debut as 
choreographer in Maze, and there’s a revival of Javier de Frutos’s Elsa 
Canasta, a marvellously dark, funny and louche homage to the music of Cole 
Porter, as seen through the world of 1920s US socialite Elsa Maxwell.

Fifty-year-old ballerina Alessandra Ferri was the star of the Royal Ballet’s 
last season in Wayne McGregor’s Woolf Works. She’s back in Chéri, a production 
created for her by Canadian Martha Clarke. Based on Colette’s novella, Ferri 
plays Lea, the retired courtesan who falls in love with the beautiful son of 
her best friend, Madame Peloux. Herman Cornejo dances Chéri, actor Francesca 
Annis makes her debut as Peloux, and the evening’s period piano score (Debussy, 
Ravel and others) is played live by Sarah Rothenberg.

Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sidi-larbi-cherkaoui> 
is never shy of tackling major themes. Here he draws on eastern and western 
philosophies to meditate on the different ways we make our journey from life to 
death. Genesis is created with the superb Chinese dance artist Yabin Wang 
(whose dancing featured in the film House of Flying Daggers), and its 
accompanying music is drawn from Africa, India, Japan, China and eastern Europe.

 Walking Stories head for London’s parks at Dance Umbrella Photograph: PR 
Dance Umbrella  <http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk>

This year’s festival is nothing if not wide-ranging, with 10 shows that range 
across venues in 13 London boroughs. There’s a focus on outdoor venues, with 
Charlotte Spencer’s Walking Stories taking place across a series of parks, and 
Of Riders and Running Horses, an evening of freestyle urban dance staged on a 
car park roof. The rest of the programme ranges from Claire Cunningham’s superb 
meditation on exclusion and judgment, to an evening of new dance from India.

Royal Ballet triple bill <http://www.roh.org.uk/events/p2syv>

As Carlos Acosta dances his last season with the Royal, he also makes his 
choreographic mark with his latest work, a one-act version of Carmen. Set to an 
arrangement of Bizet by Martin Yates, Acosta pares his narrative down to the 
dramatic essentials of love, jealousy and revenge, framing the action with a 
minimalist design by Tim Hatley. Sharing the evening is a revival of Liam 
Scarlett’s excellent Viscera, a setting of Lowell Liebermann’s fast and 
thrilling Piano Concerto, plus the fleet, athletic classical grandeur of 
Balanchine’s Theme and Variations.

The fashion designer has already had some connection with the world of dance, 
creating costumes for the likes of Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Faun and Michael 
Clark’s current/SEE. Now he’s appearing in the new Sadler’s Wells season as 
author of his own work. While Damien Jalet is credited as the choreographer, 
Chalayan initiated the work’s concept, themes, narrative and movement style, as 
well as its visual imagery.

Rambert: Love, Art & Rock n Roll 
<http://www.rambert.org.uk/performances/current-works/>

Mark Baldwin has made it a deliberate policy to commission works from 
choreographers who are either British or have close links with the UK. 
Rambert’s latest triple bill featuresDidy Veldman’s 3 Dancers, inspired by 
Pablo Picasso’s The Three Dancers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/31/picasso-the-three-dancers-didy-veldman-rambert-dance>
, which gives choreographic form to the painting’s dynamic imagery of death and 
desire. From Kim Brandstrup comes Transfigured Night, responding to the dark 
secrets in Schoenberg’s accompanying score. Completing the evening is a revival 
of Rooster, Christopher Bruce’s populist homage to the early music of the 
Rolling Stones.
