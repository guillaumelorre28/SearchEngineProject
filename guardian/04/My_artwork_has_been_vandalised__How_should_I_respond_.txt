Works of art are sometimes a focus for the wider discomforts of society. My 
Dirty Corner at Versailles has been reviled in the press as the “Queen’s 
vagina” or the “vagina on the lawn”, and has given offence to certain people of 
the extreme political right wing inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.

The vicious voice of the few has commanded too much of the debate, and has 
resulted in an act of vandalism to the work.

I am left with the question about how I should react. Should the paint that 
has been thrown all over the sculpture be removed? Or should it remain and be 
part of the work? Does the political violence of the vandalism make Dirty 
Corner “dirtier”? Does this dirty political act reflect the dirty politics of 
exclusion, marginalisation, elitism, racism, Islamophobia?

The question I ask of myself is: can I, the artist, transform this crass act 
of political vandalism and violence into a creative act? Would this not be the 
best revenge?

In asking this question I am aware of the power of art and its ability to 
offend. Dirty Corner is in some ways an act of artistic violence. It attempts 
to disrupt the tidy surface ofLe Nôtre 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Le_N%C3%B4tre>’s Versailles. It 
engages in a disruptive conversation with the palace’s geometric rigidity. It 
looks under the carpet of Le Nôtre’s “tapis vert” and allows the uncomfortable, 
even the sexual.

Political violence, however, is not the same as artistic violence. This 
political vandalism uses an “art material” – paint – to make actual violence. 
It could have been a bomb or a hood thrown over someone’s head to kidnap them. 
Artistic violence is generative, political violence destructive. Artistic 
violence may scream at the tradition of previous generations. It may violently 
overturn what was before, but in so doing it follows a long tradition of 
regeneration. It always advances the language of art.

Political violence seeks erasure. Its aim is the removal of the offending 
idea, person, practice or thing. Simplistic political views are offended by the 
untidiness of art.Art <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> is seen as 
obscene and destroyed.
