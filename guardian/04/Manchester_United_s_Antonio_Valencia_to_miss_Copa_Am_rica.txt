Manchester United’s Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> has been ruled out of 
Ecuador’s campaign at the Copa América in Chile after ankle surgery.

Valencia, who established himself as Louis van Gaal’s first-choice right-back, 
had the operation to remove metal screws from the joint followingUnited’s 0-0 
draw at Hull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/24/hull-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report>
 on the season’s final day.

The 29-year-old, who has 75 Ecuador caps, had the screws inserted after 
suffering a fractured ankle and ligament damage in September 2010 during a
Champions League group match at Rangers

.

Gustavo Quinteros, the Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> 
coach, said: “The plates or screws were causing trouble. Therefore they decided 
on an operation. It was urgent surgery for Antonio. I want him to be 100% in 
World Cup qualifying. The surgery was not something that was planned long ago.”

The Copa América <https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> begins on 
11 June when Ecuador play Chile, the hosts, in Santiago. United’s Marcos Rojo 
and Ángel Di María are in Argentina’s squad for the tournament.

Jonny Evans is nursing a knock that limited the United defender to a 
second-half appearance inNorthern Ireland’s 1-1 draw with Qatar on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/31/qatar-northern-ireland-friendly-crewe-fifa-gresty-road>
 at the Alexandra Stadium after he had been scheduled to captain the side. 
Michael O’Neill, the manager, believes it will not prevent Evans from starting 
the Euro 2016 qualifier with Romania on 13 June.
