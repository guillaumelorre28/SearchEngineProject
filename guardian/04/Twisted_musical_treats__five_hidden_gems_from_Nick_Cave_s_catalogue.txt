Nick Cave <https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave> is no stranger to bold 
creative statements.


This week he will deliver two more gripping and impassioned works. A 3D, black 
and white film, One More Time With Feeling, out Thursday, which tracks the 
making of his new album, Skeleton Tree, out Friday. Both works will directly 
addressthe tragic loss of his son last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/10/nick-caves-son-died-from-fall-after-taking-lsd-inquest-hears>
.

 While we brace ourselves for a moving double knockout punch, here are some of 
his finest perfectly twisted musical treats from deep in the shadows of his 
back catalogue.

Nick Cave: ‘The idea of censoring things as you write, it’s something I don’t 
do’

There is a primal momentum to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ sound. The 
cinematic, creepy production of the rhythm in tunes such asRed Right Hand 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrxePKps87k> is burned into dark pulse of the 
musical underground. If it’s that kind of classic Cave footprint you crave, The 
Hammer is worth a listen.

Never one to shy away from the epic, Cave brings forth borderline absurdist 
levels of grand frontier mythology crossed with the Bible at its most 
apocalyptic.

Many miles did I roam
Through the ice and through the snow
My horse died on the seventh day

The actual hammer described in the song is the most powerful and yet quietest 
tool I have ever heard described in song.

(I’ll Love You) Till the End of the World – Until the End of the World

 Cave is a renaissance man. His ability for supreme and consistent creative 
output of all kinds is awe-inspiring. He’s a novelist, screenwriter, director, 
actor and poet, over and above his various musical identities.

In (I’ll Love You) Till the End of the World, he seems to wear all his hats at 
once. He acts out his hard-boiled, spoken narrative, cigarette in hand, before 
ushering in the reassuring lilt of the chorus.

Despite having artistic integrity in spades, Cave has never been afraid to 
work to a brief if given the right opportunity. In this song, as with so much 
of his recent soundtrack work with Warren Ellis, I can see how inspiring and 
constructive having his creativity constrained and directed can be. It leads to 
some of his most intriguing and surprising work.

Lay Me Low – Let Love In (1994)

Cave’s songs have a gift for making my jaw drop in horror and then, thanks to 
a deft lyrical twist, making me inadvertently laugh at the unlaughable. He 
makes me smirk in the face of doom in the most unexpected and beautiful way.


There is no better evidence of his wicked humour than in Lay Me Low, in which 
Cave paints a graphic and hilarious picture of the aftermath of his own death. 
From the grandiose proclamations of the size of the motorcade at his funeral to 
the intimate and surreal minutiae of his mourners trying to get in touch with 
his mother on the phone but getting stuck on the line with his brother, who 
can’t help spill the beans about a long forgotten ex-lover.

They’ll interview my teachers
Who’ll say I was one of God’s sorrier creatures

Though it’s no surprise that his teachers might have found young Nick a bit of 
a troublemaker, I have a feeling that they’d now be more than happy to brag 
that he haunted the back row of their classroom.

Relatively early in the life of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the band made an 
album consisting exclusively of covers. It was bold to make the album in the 
first place and even bolder to covera song made famous by Tom Jones 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqSdx0o8M8E>.


Jones’ tanned, well-postured and hairy-chested presence seemed diametrically 
opposed to everything Cave stood for. On the flipside, how much more twisted 
and dark can one be than screwing with Tom Jones?

Cave treads a most beautiful tightrope here, exploding the song and covering 
it in a potent grime while somehow also honouring the original.

We Call Upon the Author – Dig, Lazarus, Dig (2008)

Dig, Lazarus, Dig saw an increasingly sage-like Cave looking outwards, taking 
names and looking for answers. After the epic barrage that was Grinderman, he 
returned to some of his older seedy cronies ready to spill the beans on the 
state of the world.

In We Call Upon the Author we catch a glimpse through Cave’s reddening eyes. 
He pleads through the Bad Seeds’ rollicking and hypnotic cacophony as he asks 
who is responsible for all the damn mess? Who is the ultimate author who can 
answer for our farcical state of chaos? Is it God, politicians, the media, or 
his mate Doug rapping at the window?

Like a charming and authoritative prosecutor, he hollers, “We call upon the 
author to explain!”. He strikes a unique balance between anger and irreverence, 
between passion and satirical resignation.
