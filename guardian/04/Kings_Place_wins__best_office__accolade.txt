Kings Place has been named 'Best of the Best' at the British Council for 
Offices' annual awards ceremony.

Having won the the Best Commercial Workplace category, Kings Place was joined 
by the four other national category winners to find which was the best of the 
best.

Judges praised Kings Place for its exquisite design and clever construction. 
Awards <https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards> Chairman John 
Forrester said: "This year's Best of the Best is a project which changes the 
art of the possible. Once every decade or so a building comes along which 
alters the common understanding of what is commercially possible. Kings Place 
has not just moved the goalposts - it rewrote the book on how commercial 
property can integrate with the life of a city."
