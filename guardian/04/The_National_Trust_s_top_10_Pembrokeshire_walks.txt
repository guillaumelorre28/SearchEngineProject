The Marloes Peninsula <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/marloes-peninsula/> 
offers dramatic coastal scenery and island views. The Deer Park, at its tip, is 
separated from Midland Island andSkomer 
<http://www.welshwildlife.org/skomer-skokholm/skomer/> by the fierce currents 
of Jack Sound. The geology is spectacular, including both sandstones and 
volcanic rocks with folds, faults and jagged stacks. An Iron Age fort overlooks 
Marloes Sands, one of Pembrokeshire's finest beaches. Walks for all abilities 
start from the National Trust car parks at Marloes Sands and Martins Haven, but 
finest is the walk around the peninsula. Look out for seabirds and seals. 
Marloes Mere is a birdwatching hotspot, attracting a large number of waterfowl 
in winter.

Treginnis, on the St Davids peninsula 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-davids-peninsula/>, is the most westerly 
settlement in Wales, separated fromRamsey Island 
<http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/r/ramseyisland/> with its extinct 
volcanoes by Ramsey Sound. This walk takes you over Wales's oldest rocks – from 
the Precambrian era – which dominate the peninsula. These are volcanic in 
origin, covered in places by layers of younger, sedimentary Cambrian rock. It's 
a great walk at all times of year, whether you're looking for spring flowers, 
summer seabirds or a freshener on New Year's Day. Watch out for porpoises, and 
intrepid sea-kayakers negotiating the shallow reef known as The Bitches. 
Halfway round is the lifeboat station of St Justinian's, about to be joined by 
a more up-to-date version.

St Davids Head <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-davids-peninsula/> is 
Pembrokeshire's most spectacular headland, and a fine walk with several 
variants is possible. Climb Carn Llidi if you have the energy: the views are 
worth it. A magnificent seascape is dominated by Ramsey Island and the line of 
islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. The Head is a many-layered 
archaeological landscape, with evidence of human occupation going back to the 
Stone Age. You can see the huge slab of Carreg Coetan Arthur, a neolithic 
burial chamber, silhouetted against the sky from the car park. Heather and 
gorse give a blaze of purple and gold in late summer. Look out for choughs, 
peregrine falcons and ravens, and listen for the elusive Dartford warbler in 
the gorse.

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1356404907542/>
This walk offers a chance to enjoy some of Pembrokeshire's finest coastal 
scenery while exploring its industrial past. The tiny fishing port of Porthgain 
used to export road stone all over the UK, whileAbereiddy's 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/abereiddi-abermawr/> famous Blue Lagoon was 
once an old slate quarry. Ynys y Barri (or Barry Island) is also home to a 
fantastic array of wildlife. Begin your walk under the looming brick stone 
hoppers by the harbour and enjoy a fabulous clifftop walk above the great 
quarry. Follow the old tramway inland from Abereiddy back to Porthgain and end 
up back in the famous Sloop Inn (sloop.co.uk <http://sloop.co.uk/>).

Not an actual island (for now, at any rate), Dinas Island is a huge whaleback 
of land dominating Fishguard's harbour and commanding stupendous views across 
Cardigan Bay to Snowdonia and Llyn. The route climbs steeply, and is a test for 
the leg muscles whichever way round you do it. From the summit, look west to 
the scene of the last French invasion of Britain, in 1797 at Carreg Wastad. 
This is not a long walk but one to test your fitness, with plenty of reasons to 
stop and admire the scenery. You should see choughs, peregrine falcons and, in 
summer, seabirds nesting on Needle Rock. There is a gentle return along the 
inland valley. Finish up at theOld Sailors pub 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwllgwaelod#The_Old_Sailors> in Pwllgwaelod.

Stackpole 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item580131/275995/>
 is one of Wales's richest nature reserves, with an important designed 
landscape at its heart. This walk takes in lakes, woods, beaches, dunes and 
cliffs. The lakes were created 200 years ago as a backdrop to Stackpole Court – 
a great house demolished in 1963 – and have since become a precious wildlife 
habitat. It is an exciting walk in all seasons, with wildfowl on the lakes in 
winter and breeding seabirds on Stackpole Head in summer. Barafundle regularly 
appears in lists of the world's most beautiful beaches. Begin your walk in the 
tiny harbour of Stackpole Quay, and finish with some hearty fare back at the
Boathouse Tearoom

Upstream from the busy port of Milford Haven lies a world of drowned wooded 
valleys with a wide expanse of salt marshes and mudflats. This scenic circular 
walk takes you through the steep-sided ancient oak woodland of Lawrenny, 
overlooking the main Daugleddau river and along the tidal creeks of Garron Pill 
and the Cresswell river. This is a great walk in any season. In winter look for 
wildfowl and waders in Garron Pill, and in summer for the wild service trees 
growing under the oak canopy in Lawrenny Wood. Back at Lawrenny Quay, you have 
a choice between the Lawrenny Arms 
<http://www.lawrennyvillage.co.uk/food-accomodation/lawrenny-arms/> and (from 
Easter to autumn) the multi-award winning Quayside Lawrenny Tearoom (
quaysidelawrenny.co.uk <http://www.quaysidelawrenny.co.uk/>), with its 
legendary crab sandwiches.

Abermawr woods and beach

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1356404631212/>
This is a circular walk through bluebell woods and meadows, shingle beach and 
marsh. Abermawr offers a gentle interlude on one of the most rugged sections of 
the coastline. Brunel wanted to create a port and cable terminus here, but 
nature has long since reclaimed his work. A shingle beach protects a freshwater 
marsh, but the beach is retreating as sea levels rise and will eventually 
breach to create a new salt marsh. Parking is limited. Bluebells and birdsong 
make it a lovely walk in spring; the shady woodland offers a pleasant retreat 
from the beach in summer.

Climb this rocky volcanic outcrop on the Pencaer peninsula for magnificent 
views of the north Pembrokeshire coast. It contains one of the most spectacular 
Iron Age forts in Pembrokeshire. Three thousand years later it was a second 
world war lookout point. You are close to Strumble Head, a famous spot for 
watching sea birds in autumn. This is a remote corner of Pembrokeshire, easily 
missed, but offering some fine coastal scenery.

Solva and the Gribin

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1356404052394/>
The pretty village of Solva <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/solva-coast/> is 
at the centre of eight miles of unspoilt coastal scenery stretching from 
Newgale in the east to St Davids in the west. The Gribin is a rocky headland 
guarding the entrance to Solva Harbour, giving spectacular views along the 
coast and across St Bride's Bay. This walk is a perfect complement to time 
spent in Solva's interesting shops and galleries, and there are plenty of 
places in the village to refresh yourself afterwards. For those looking for a 
longer walk, the shuttle bus between Newgale and St Davids lets you walk the 
whole stretch in a day, or half of it in a half-day. Either way, Solva falls at 
lunchtime.
