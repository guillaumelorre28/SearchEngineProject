1 Pick a good seat on the front row (or Splash Zone) so that when our Orca Of 
Fun makes his/her big entrance, you’re guaranteed to get soaked by wave upon 
wave of brine-flavoured laughs.

2 Attract the Comedian’s attention by having bewildering hair, wearing a 
necklace of multi-coloured fairy lights and launching two flares up into the 
lighting rig. This will automatically flag you up in everyone’s mind as being 
an absolute prick.

3 Gain the Comedian’s trust by approaching with both hands open and flat so 
that he/she can sniff you, then lie on the floor offering him/her your belly to 
rub. This will create a bond, prove to the Comedian that you won’t shaft up the 
show and potentially reward you with your first laugh.

4 Do everything that is asked of you. Everything. And they will love you for 
it.

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE SAVED THE SHOW!!!

1 MAKE A NOISE I understand how hard it is to laugh out loud. When I watch the 
things I find the funniest, my head gets very still and quiet because I just 
want to smell the funniness in, and leave my brain to do a sexy catwalk up and 
down my skull with pleasure. However, after a worrying amount of performances 
to a sea of silent faces I have learned how horrific it is and how sweet those 
giggles make you feel.

2 FAKE IT It is the only time that it is cool and, in fact, better if you fake 
it. The louder you bark, the more the confidence of the jester will grow and 
the more they will show off and try to please you.

3 JUST MAKE A NOISE It doesn’t matter what it sounds like, just a loud 
(preferably happy-ish) noise is all we want. If you can’t manage that, just try 
opening your throat and letting out a loud consistent note, maybe like a middle 
C, breathe and repeat. If you want to be really kind then the true dream laugh 
is one with a rich throaty timbre that comes from inside the stomach and moves 
up and down the scale and is mixed with noises of rich discomfort and exquisite 
pain before finishing either with some kind of cough or a watery-eyed thigh 
slap.

4 BE KIND If you are really unable to laugh, then the best thing to do is to 
either smile as loud as you can or position your body in a way that looks 
pleased. It will help so much when the comedian looks at the crowd because even 
if there’s tumbleweed blowing across the crowd they’ll look happy enough to see 
it.

1 PICK YOUR SEAT The Edinburgh show is a love letter to the chair fan, with 
anything up to 50 bum-holders to choose from. The more physically intimidating 
heckler should sit at the front, lest their size go unnoticed. Those with a 
diminutive build but imposing voice should perch in the shadows. The resulting 
disembodiment of their mouth-guff will have an air of the supernatural or even 
divine.

2 BIDE YOUR TIME A mistake commonly made by inexperienced “hecklists” is to 
blow their oral load too early. A heckle is more effective after the comedian 
has worked to establish a persona, context and narrative. Now you have 
something to ruin.

3 BE HEARD This is it: your one chance, your 8 Mile. Make it count. If you 
sputter or stumble, and allow the comedian to ask, “What was that?” you’ve just 
given them an invaluable extra second to formulate your demise.

4 CLAIM TO BE HELPING Nothing infuriates comics like the suggestion that their 
act – or personal life – is in need of assistance. Furthermore, convincing your 
fellow audience members that you are honestly trying to contribute will recast 
you not as a selfish egotist but a lovable buffoon.

5 TAKE STOCK The show has ended. You heckled. As you walk home, stopping only 
to deface street art and urinate on sights of natural beauty, consider what’s 
gone wrong enough to lead you to this point. Call your mother. She misses you.
