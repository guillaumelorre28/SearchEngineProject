The Guardian has been named one of the four World’s Best-Designed™ Newspapers 
by the Society of News Design.

The winners, which also included Dagens Nyheter (Sweden), De Morgen(Belgium) 
and Politiken (Denmark), were announced at the conclusion of SND’s 37th annual 
workshop in the Newseum, Washington D.C.

Commenting on the Guardian’s inclusion in the award, judges remarked:

“We came to The Guardian with an expectation that it would deliver great 
visual journalism, but even with those expectations it amazed us with its 
energy and how many surprises it delivered throughout.

“It sets a standard for the industry in just about every discipline for a 
print publication”

The Guardian was also included in the Best-Designed™ Newspapers last year.
