1. Hamilton

At this point it’s almost embarrassing to devote any more ink or pixels to 
Lin-Manuel Miranda’s triumphant musical. A scrupulous history of America’s 
sexiest founding father, AlexanderHamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton>, Miranda’s piece makes Federalism 
scintillating, restoring the radicalism of America’s birth and radicalising 
Broadway a little, too. This is a show both theatrically exhilarating and 
politically necessary.

The script and songs recontextualise the revolutionary war as a battle fought 
by a scrappy band of immigrants, an important corrective considering so much of 
the Republican rhetoric now circulating. Miranda uses the vernacular of the 
streets and of Broadway, too, crafting a musical language of rap,R&B 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/r-and-b>, hip-hop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop>, pop, rock, the American songbook 
and show tunes. Stephen Sondheim is a fan. So is Questlove. So is everyone else.

It’s marvelous to experience a show this smart and this populist at the same 
time. Miranda is a bona fide genius (he has theMacArthur grant 
<https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/strategy/> to prove it). His lyrics 
distil a remarkable amount of American history and he isn’t afraid to go full 
wonk, particularly in the second act, with its cabinet meetings staged as rap 
battles and its attention toThe Federalist Papers 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/federalist-papers-2.html>. But the jokes, 
sick beats, and propulsive energy of the show will please even those who don’t 
know much about history and don’t care to. And good luck getting through the 
final scene without sobbing into yourPlaybill <http://www.playbill.com/>.

The wildly talented cast is of mixed ethnicity and this is sadly rare on 
Broadway, where even when diversity does arrive, it does so in limited niches – 
African Americans inThe Color Purple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/11/the-color-purple-jennifer-hudson-cynthia-erivo-musical>
, Asian Americans inAllegiance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/08/allegiance-review-broadway-unexceptional-pledge-george-takei>
, Hispanic Americans inOn Your Feet! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/05/on-your-feet-review-gloria-estefan-musical>
 Hamilton doesn’t traffic in such categories and it shows that a good story 
very well told will appeal to a wide range of ticket buyers, regardless of 
race. If there is justice on Broadway (a debatable proposition), producers will 
take note.Read the review

 ‘Claustrophobic and thrilling’ … Russell Tovey, Mark Strong and Phoebe Fox in 
A View from the Bridge. Photograph: Jan Versweyveld/AP 
Ivo van Hove exposes the tragedy and terror submerged in Arthur Miller’s play 
about a Brooklyn longshoreman consumed by an illicit love for his niece. The 
staging is claustrophobic and thrilling, with the actors confined to a small 
square and hemmed in by rows of audience members seated on stage. The cramped 
quarters only intensify the performances, particularly Mark Strong’s Eddie, an 
alpha male undone by challenges to his masculinity, internal and external.Read

 ‘Spiky and angry’ … John Cameron Mitchell in Hedwig and the Angry Inch on 
Broadway. Photograph: Joan Marcus 
The solid Broadway revival of this rousing rock musical became something much 
more when John Cameron Mitchell reprised his role as the transgender chanteuse. 
Hobbled by a knee injury, Mitchell made Hedwig’s search for love, acceptance, 
and better representation spikier and angrier, intensifying the pathos of
Stephen Trask’s already excellent songs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/21/hedwig-and-the-angry-inch-musicals-we-love>
 and deepening Hedwig’s troubled relationship with her husband Yitzhak (the 
superb Lena Hall). Though palpably in pain, he still managed high kicks in 
platform boots and a miniskirt.Read the review

 ‘Poignant and uproarious’ … Small Mouth Sounds Photograph: Ben Arons 
The dialogue of Bess Wohl’s play, which enjoyed a too-brief run at Ars Nova, 
would fit neatly on to a couple of fortune cookies. In this melancholy comedy, 
set at a week-long silent retreat, a group of spiritual seekers learn how to 
communicate when words are not available. Through hand gestures and funny faces 
and scribbled notes they somehow reveal their suffering, which Wohl allows to 
be as poignant as it is uproarious.

 ‘Electrifying’ … Empire Travel Agency. 
In this electrifying immersive theatre experience, easily the best and most 
ambitious show that theWoodshed Collective <http://www.woodshedcollective.com/> 
has yet accomplished, quartets of New Yorkers were set roaming the Financial 
District, cast as part of a Canadian cabal searching for a mysterious substance 
called Ambrose, a drug that offers its users hyped-up visions of the future. 
Surprising, innovative, and almost impossibly exciting, it was a show whose 
limited budget was no curb on its boundless imagination.

 ‘Heady’ … 10 out of 12. 
Anne Washburn’s drama, set during technical rehearsals for a new play, is a 
sad and loving elegy to the creation of live performance. An avant-garde Noises 
Off, it strands a director, actors, designers and crew amid the last-minute 
catastrophes that plague every show. The format is heady and high-minded, but 
the theme is simple – all the mess and anguish and absurdity and waste that 
goes into making any new work of art and how it is still somehow worth it.Read

 ‘Heartbreaking’ … Georgia Engel in John. 
The magical-realist gestures in Annie Baker’s latest play, set in a possibly 
haunted bed and breakfast in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, aren’t always executed 
confidently. But there’s supreme poise and conviction in Baker’s unflinching 
sympathy for her characters and her knack for dialogue and scenecraft is nearly 
unparalleled. ThisSignature Theatre <http://www.sigtheatre.org/about/> show was 
further enlivened by Sam Gold’s elegant staging, Mimi Lien’s meticulously 
detailed set, and a heartbreaking performance by Georgia Engel as the gentle 
proprietress.Read the review

 ‘Geeky yet grand’ … The Honeycomb Trilogy. 
In Mac Rogers’s sci-fi epic, earth is invaded by a race of apian aliens. A 
sister, Ronnie, and a brother, Abbie, variously defy and collaborate with the 
new insectoid overlords. Each of three parts is set in the same suburban living 
room, but Rogers’s ingenuity roams broadly, mingling genres, characters, 
attitudes, tones, and the fate of the planet, too. It’s a geeky show, no 
question, but also a grand and morally complex one.

 ‘Feeling’ … Fun Home, with Tony-nominated Sydney Lucas on right. 
A musical that lost no intimacy and gained emotive heft when it moved from the 
Public Theater to Broadway, this adaptation ofAlison Bechdel’s graphic memoir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/28/comfort-reading-alison-bechdel-fun-home>
 juxtaposed Bechdel’s embrace of her lesbianism with the experiences of her 
father, a closeted gay man whose life ended in a probable suicide. The 
highlight of Jeanine Tesori’s feeling score and Lisa Krohn’s adroit lyrics is 
undoubtedlyRing of Keys <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLman-pE0wU#t=57s>, a 
ballad of same-sex identification sung by a preternaturally poised Sydney Lucas.

A prestige production from the Royal Shakespeare Company, this theatrical 
adaptation ably condenses the first twoHilary Mantel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hilary-mantel> novels on the life of Thomas 
Cromwell, Henry VIII’s consigliere. Jeremy Herrin’s staging was simple yet 
sumptuous and the pared down script enmeshed audiences in the tangled web of 
Tudor politics. Nathaniel Parker was a fine Henry, Lydia Leonard a compellingly 
ambiguous Anne, and Ben Miles gave a captivating performance as Cromwell, at 
once urgent and opaque.Read the review
