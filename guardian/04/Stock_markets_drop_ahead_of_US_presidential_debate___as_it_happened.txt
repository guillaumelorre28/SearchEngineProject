Closing post: Wall Street closes in the red

Ding ding ding.... the closing bell on the New York stock exchange has been 
rung.

And the US stock market has lost almost 1%, as investors brace for tonight’s 
clash between the two candidates to become US president.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166 points, or 0.91%, with almost every 
component dropping. Banks were the big fallers (who caught a cold from the 
troubles at Deutsche Bank).

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped by 0.8%, following heavier losses in 
Europe with Britain suffering its worst day since late June

Donald Trump hasn’t released a massive amount of detail about his policy 
platform if he becomes president.

That’s one reason the markets are nervous about the presidential race.

But despite that, City firm Columbia Threadneedle have taken a stab at the 
potential impact of a Trump victory.
 Photograph: Columbia Threadneedle 
They reckon infrastructure providers should benefit, if Trump does launch a 
massive programme of building more roads, bridges, and the like.

But that means more borrowing, which could get expensive.

Mark Burgess of Columbia explains:

Trump has made some disconcerting comments regarding a lack of commitment to 
debt repayments.


If a substantial global event like the financial crisis were to occur again, 
this may mean domestic debt is paid while foreign debt remains outstanding. 
Could this deter investors?

This would be particularly unfortunate as Treasury issuance is likely to 
increase significantly in order to fund the various costly proposals as the US 
racks up larger deficits.

Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in 
Chicago, says US election uncertainty isn’t helping the dollar.

He told Reuters that:

 “Most market participants are waiting to see what comes out of the debate

US Treasuries (American government debt) have rallied today, on nervousness 
ahead of tonight’s debate.

This has pushed the yield (or interest rates) on 10-year Treasury bonds down 
to 1.587%, from 1.6% on Friday.

It’s another sign that investors are looking for safety tonight.

As Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San 
Francisco, put it:

“A lot of the gains in Treasuries are safe-haven trades....Stocks are also 
looking pretty weak with a lot of concerns about financials with Deutsche Bank.”

And polling expert Nate Silver believes it is too close to call:

Stocks are still down on Wall Street, with just under an hour to go until the 
closing bell.

The Dow is currently off 159 points, or 0.8%, at 18101 -- a level it’s been 
hovering around for most of the day, really. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are 
showing similar losses.

Bank shares continue to get a kicking; Goldman and JP Morgan are both down 
2.5% (due to the worries over Deutsche Bank).

Walt Disney is now among the fallers too, down 1.7%, following a report it 
might bid for Twitter.

CNN aren’t pulling their punches -- they predict that stock markets will 
probably tumble on Tuesday if Trump wins tonight’s debate.

Here’s a flavour:


Wall Street doesn’t want a President Trump (with the exception of a few hedge 
fund managers and Trump supporters, like Carl Icahn). As the old saying goes, 
the market loves good news, it can deal with bad news, but it hates 
uncertainty. And Trump is the motherlode of uncertainty.

“The typical investor just can’t contemplate the possibility of a Trump 
victory,” says Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at Decision Economics....

So the closer the race gets, the more worried investors become....

“If for some reason Trump puts on a presidential showing...and Clinton 
stumbles for whatever reason, then the market may take another reassessment,” 
says Leahey. That’s the polite way of saying, stocks are likely to fall.

Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric is a particular worry for Wall Street.

CNBC’s Elizabeth Gurdus reports that:

“I think neither candidate has super market-friendly policies,” Dean Curnutt, 
CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said on CNBC.

“Both have been reasonably anti-trade. Clinton was pulled pretty far left by 
Bernie Sanders. Trump’s policies really resemble very little of what we 
typically associate with free-market Republicanism.”

Trump’s attacks on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen add another dollop of 
instability to the pot. If he wins in November, Yellen might not bank on 
getting a second term.

The US dollar is already dropping against the yen, even before the two 
nominees take to the stage in New York.

One dollar now gets you 100.29 yen in the FX market, down 0.7% compared to 
Friday, when your greenback was worth 101.1 yen.

That won’t amuse the Tokyo government much; Japan wants to weaken its currency 
to push inflation up.

The US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico stock markets are all down today, following 
losses across Europe.

It’s more of an adjustment than a rout, though - with Wall Street losing less 
than 1% so far.

Most European market shed less than 2% (they’re all closed now)

There could be a surge of money into safe-havens if Donald Trump outperforms 
expectations on tonight’s debate, City experts say.

Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts that the Japanese Yen and US government bonds 
(Treasuries) could both benefit:

 Tonight’s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial 
markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump 
manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks.

Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients 
perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG 
binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring 
personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight’s debate could see the 
polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the 
yen and Treasuries.

Mexican Peso under fire

Some investors are looking at the Presidential Race as a serious chance to 
make money. The rest are just worried about losing what they’ve already got.

But how do you trade, say, a Donald Trump victory?

Well, Mexico’s currency has emerged as a surprise proxy for the Upset To End 
All Upsets. When Trump does well, or Hillary Clinton has a bad day, the Mexicon 
peso often takes a pasting.

This chart shows how the peso has weakened since April, from 17 to the $1 to 
almost 20/$1 today.

And the pressure is getting worse -- bets against the poor old Peso have hit a 
record high and the cost of insuring against future losses has spiked.

Trump’s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border means the country is at “the 
sharp end of ‘Trump risk’”, says Nicholas Spiro a partner at London-based 
Lauressa Advisory Ltd.

Fear Index jumps

Volatility is also rising on Wall Street today as the race to the White House 
hots up.

The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX (commonly known as the “fear gauge”) 
is up 1.9% today - the biggest rise in a fortnight.


Reuters has more details:

With just over six weeks until Election Day, some investors see a toss-up 
contest creating volatility in certain sectors, including health insurers, 
drugmakers and industrials.

“Investors are acting extremely nervous with regards to the debate ... and it 
highlights the fact that the markets are not focusing on the health of the 
economy, interest rates and geopolitical events,” said Robert Pavlik, chief 
market strategist at Boston Private Wealth.

Banks lead Wall Street lower

Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest fallers on the 
Dow Jones industrial average today.

They’re both down around 1.8%, as financial stocks suffer from worries over 
the health of Germany’s Deutsche Bank.

Consumer group Procter & Gamble and tech giant Apple are among the few risers, 
but most stocks have dropped as investors await for tonight’s debate (in just 
under 8 hours time).

Helena Smith

Over in Greece the former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has warned the 
country faces political, social and economic disintegration as financial 
indicators worsen and the government scrambles to push through long overdue 
reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens:

Venizelos, finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis, issued a 
withering assessment of the government’s performance in office.

In a speech to businessmen on the future of Greece at the Thessaloniki chamber 
of commerce and industry the politician said the country was in danger of 
“institutional, economic and social collapse” because the leftist-led coalition 
lacked a strategic plan to exit its long-running debt crisis.

Instead, he claimed, ministers were working to the slogan “we are doing well 
and will do better” and were turning a blind eye to real problems as the 
nation’s real economy plummeted. “The government is making out as if it doesn’t 
understand how critical things are. Its theory ‘we are doing well and will do 
better’ is a spring that will pop up.”

Venizelos, whose Pasok socialist party was in office with the main opposition 
conservatives until being ejected by Syriza, the radical left group led by 
prime minister Alexis Tsipras, spoke as the government prepared to push more 
creditor-mandated reforms through parliament tomorrow.

Some €2.8bn worth of aid is at stake. After a summer of little progress, the 
aim is for parliament to legislate on the 15 milestone actions by the time the 
Euro Working Group meets on Thursday. The reforms, which include appointment of 
officials to a new privatisation fund’s supervisory board, are expedient if a 
second bailout review is to begin and debt relief talks officially opened.

Earlier on Monday the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis 
said the thrice-bailed out nation had been forced to endure more punitive 
austerity than otherwise necessary because of Tsipras’ populist pledge to end 
the policies when he assumed power in January 2015.

“Populism doesn’t solve problems. Populism creates problems,” he told a 
conference in Riga. “We could see that in the … classical example of Greece. A 
new government came with a populist stance, that ‘we don’t need any austerity 
regimes, we will spend as much as we want’ … and, in fact, Greece now 
implements tougher austerity measures than it would have been necessary if 
[reforms] of the previous government were continued at the time.”

Ding ding ding.... the closing bell on the New York stock exchange has been 
rung.

And the US stock market has lost almost 1%, as investors brace for tonight’s 
clash between the two candidates to become US president.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166 points, or 0.91%, with almost every

troubles at Deutsche Bank).

Presidential debate looms as Clinton-Trump race tightens – campaign live

I’ll be back in the morning to see how the markets react. Until then, good 
nght and thanks for reading and commenting.GW
 
Donald Trump hasn’t released a massive amount of detail about his policy 
platform if he becomes president.

That’s one reason the markets are nervous about the presidential race.

But despite that, City firm Columbia Threadneedle have taken a stab at the 
potential impact of a Trump victory.

They reckon infrastructure providers should benefit, if Trump does launch a 
massive programme of building more roads, bridges, and the like.

But that means more borrowing, which could get expensive.

Mark Burgess of Columbia explains:

Trump has made some disconcerting comments regarding a lack of commitment to 
debt repayments.


If a substantial global event like the financial crisis were to occur again, 
this may mean domestic debt is paid while foreign debt remains outstanding. 
Could this deter investors?

This would be particularly unfortunate as Treasury issuance is likely to 
increase significantly in order to fund the various costly proposals as the US 
racks up larger deficits.
 
Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in 
Chicago, says US election uncertainty isn’t helping the dollar.

He told Reuters that:

 “Most market participants are waiting to see what comes out of the debate 
tonight and will take their cue from there.”
 
US Treasuries (American government debt) have rallied today, on nervousness 
ahead of tonight’s debate.

This has pushed the yield (or interest rates) on 10-year Treasury bonds down 
to 1.587%, from 1.6% on Friday.

It’s another sign that investors are looking for safety tonight.

As Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San 
Francisco, put it:

“A lot of the gains in Treasuries are safe-haven trades....Stocks are also 
looking pretty weak with a lot of concerns about financials with Deutsche Bank.”
 
Hillary Clinton has a five point lead over Donald Trump, according to the 
latest weekly tracking poll from NBC News.

 putting the two candidates level (and Trump ahead, in a four-way fight).

And polling expert Nate Silver believes it is too close to call:

Stocks are still down on Wall Street, with just under an hour to go until the 
closing bell.

The Dow is currently off 159 points, or 0.8%, at 18101 -- a level it’s been 
hovering around for most of the day, really. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are 
showing similar losses.

Bank shares continue to get a kicking; Goldman and JP Morgan are both down 
2.5% (due to the worries over Deutsche Bank).

Walt Disney is now among the fallers too, down 1.7%, following a report it 
might bid for Twitter.

CNN aren’t pulling their punches -- they predict that stock markets will 
probably tumble on Tuesday if Trump wins tonight’s debate.

Here’s a flavour:


Wall Street doesn’t want a President Trump (with the exception of a few hedge 
fund managers and Trump supporters, like Carl Icahn). As the old saying goes, 
the market loves good news, it can deal with bad news, but it hates 
uncertainty. And Trump is the motherlode of uncertainty.

“The typical investor just can’t contemplate the possibility of a Trump 
victory,” says Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at Decision Economics....

So the closer the race gets, the more worried investors become....

“If for some reason Trump puts on a presidential showing...and Clinton 
stumbles for whatever reason, then the market may take another reassessment,” 
says Leahey. That’s the polite way of saying, stocks are likely to fall.

Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric is a particular worry for Wall Street.

CNBC’s Elizabeth Gurdus reports that:

“I think neither candidate has super market-friendly policies,” Dean Curnutt, 
CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said on CNBC.

“Both have been reasonably anti-trade. Clinton was pulled pretty far left by 
Bernie Sanders. Trump’s policies really resemble very little of what we 
typically associate with free-market Republicanism.”

Trump’s attacks on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen add another dollop of 
instability to the pot. If he wins in November, Yellen might not bank on 
getting a second term.

Mexico’s manufacturers might want to raise a glass to Donald Trump; by 
weakening the peso, he’s made their exports much more competitive:

The US dollar is already dropping against the yen, even before the two 
nominees take to the stage in New York.

One dollar now gets you 100.29 yen in the FX market, down 0.7% compared to 
Friday, when your greenback was worth 101.1 yen.

That won’t amuse the Tokyo government much; Japan wants to weaken its currency 
to push inflation up.
 
The US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico stock markets are all down today, following 
losses across Europe.

It’s more of an adjustment than a rout, though - with Wall Street losing less 
than 1% so far.

There could be a surge of money into safe-havens if Donald Trump outperforms 
expectations on tonight’s debate, City experts say.

Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts that the Japanese Yen and US government bonds 
(Treasuries) could both benefit:

 Tonight’s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial 
markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump 
manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks.

Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients 
perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG 
binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring 
personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight’s debate could see the 
polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the 
yen and Treasuries.
 
Some investors are looking at the Presidential Race as a serious chance to 
make money. The rest are just worried about losing what they’ve already got.

But how do you trade, say, a Donald Trump victory?

Well, Mexico’s currency has emerged as a surprise proxy for the Upset To End 
All Upsets. When Trump does well, or Hillary Clinton has a bad day, the Mexicon 
peso often takes a pasting.

This chart shows how the peso has weakened since April, from 17 to the $1 to 
almost 20/$1 today.

And the pressure is getting worse -- bets against the poor old Peso have hit a 
record high and the cost of insuring against future losses has spiked.

Trump’s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border means the country is at “the 
sharp end of ‘Trump risk’”, says Nicholas Spiro a partner at London-based 
Lauressa Advisory Ltd.

Volatility is also rising on Wall Street today as the race to the White House 
hots up.

The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX (commonly known as the “fear gauge”) 
is up 1.9% today - the biggest rise in a fortnight.


Reuters has more details:

With just over six weeks until Election Day, some investors see a toss-up 
contest creating volatility in certain sectors, including health insurers, 
drugmakers and industrials.

“Investors are acting extremely nervous with regards to the debate ... and it 
highlights the fact that the markets are not focusing on the health of the 
economy, interest rates and geopolitical events,” said Robert Pavlik, chief 
market strategist at Boston Private Wealth.
 
Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest fallers on the 
Dow Jones industrial average today.

They’re both down around 1.8%, as financial stocks suffer from worries over 
the health of Germany’s Deutsche Bank.

Consumer group Procter & Gamble and tech giant Apple are among the few risers, 
but most stocks have dropped as investors await for tonight’s debate (in just 
under 8 hours time).

Over in Greece the former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has warned the 
country faces political, social and economic disintegration as financial 
indicators worsen and the government scrambles to push through long overdue 
reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens:

Venizelos, finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis, issued a 
withering assessment of the government’s performance in office.

In a speech to businessmen on the future of Greece at the Thessaloniki chamber 
of commerce and industry the politician said the country was in danger of 
“institutional, economic and social collapse” because the leftist-led coalition 
lacked a strategic plan to exit its long-running debt crisis.

Instead, he claimed, ministers were working to the slogan “we are doing well 
and will do better” and were turning a blind eye to real problems as the 
nation’s real economy plummeted. “The government is making out as if it doesn’t 
understand how critical things are. Its theory ‘we are doing well and will do 
better’ is a spring that will pop up.”

Venizelos, whose Pasok socialist party was in office with the main opposition 
conservatives until being ejected by Syriza, the radical left group led by 
prime minister Alexis Tsipras, spoke as the government prepared to push more 
creditor-mandated reforms through parliament tomorrow.

Some €2.8bn worth of aid is at stake. After a summer of little progress, the 
aim is for parliament to legislate on the 15 milestone actions by the time the 
Euro Working Group meets on Thursday. The reforms, which include appointment of 
officials to a new privatisation fund’s supervisory board, are expedient if a 
second bailout review is to begin and debt relief talks officially opened.

Earlier on Monday the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis 
said the thrice-bailed out nation had been forced to endure more punitive 
austerity than otherwise necessary because of Tsipras’ populist pledge to end 
the policies when he assumed power in January 2015.
 Dombrovskis Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters 
“Populism doesn’t solve problems. Populism creates problems,” he told a 
conference in Riga. “We could see that in the … classical example of Greece. A 
new government came with a populist stance, that ‘we don’t need any austerity 
regimes, we will spend as much as we want’ … and, in fact, Greece now 
implements tougher austerity measures than it would have been necessary if 
[reforms] of the previous government were continued at the time.”
