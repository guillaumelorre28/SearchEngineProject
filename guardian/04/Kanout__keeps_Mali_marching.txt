Frédéric Kanouté continued to shine as he inspired Mali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mali> into the quarter-finals. They 
followed Tunisia into the last eight with a 3-1 win in a throbbing West African 
derby with Burkina Faso, the striker providing the first goal and a beautiful 
assist for the clinching third.

The Tottenham man now has three goals after two games and the Malians have a 
new hero. "The midfield have been playing well for me and I have been able to 
score, so I am happy," Kanouté said. "But we mustn't get carried away, although 
it's true that both the defence and the attack are playing equally well.

"We play Senegal next and, although we are already through, it is a very 
important game for us because it is personal between us and Senegal."

Kanouté opened the scoring with a precise finish from a pass from Mahamadou 
Diarra after 34 minutes. And three minutes later the Lyon midfielder headed in 
Bassala Touré's corner in an unexpected period of Malian domination in what had 
been a largely even game.

Burkina Faso came back thrillingly in the second half and the substitute 
Dieudonné Minoungou tapped in to reduce the deficit, but Kanouté settled Malian 
nerves by backheeling a cute pass into the path of Soumaila Coulibaly to seal 
the victory.
