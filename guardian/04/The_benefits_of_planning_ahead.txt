The UK has voted to leave the EU – but what now? Amid confusion over what 
exactly lies in store for us, it would be nice to hear a clearer plan from the 
winning Leave campaign. In fact, perhaps Johnson, Farage and the like could 
learn something from the brain as they navigate the aftermath of this 
potentially devastating result. The part of the brain that controls movement – 
our motor control system – has an excellent grasp of the need for a contingency 
plan.

For example, if you are trying to move a very heavy wardrobe, all your 
conscious effort is going into pushing it with maximum force. But without 
letting you know, your brain is already preparing for the moment the wardrobe 
starts moving by activating the brain areas that control the opposite muscles 
from the ones you are using to push. The pull muscles aren’t tensed in this 
moment, as that would make the pushing less effective. They are simply primed 
to stop us from falling over when our efforts are successful.

So, as some parts of the brain tell us, it’s important to plan a reaction to 
the outcome of our actions. Unfortunately it seems sometimes our unconscious 
brain is cleverer than the conscious one.
