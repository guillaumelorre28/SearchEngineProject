In February 1971, Serpico (Al Pacino) is on his way to hospital after being 
hit in the face by a bullet during a drug raid in Brooklyn. “Guess who got 
shot?” asks one policeman of another: “Serpico.” “Think a cop did it?” the 
other asks. “I know six cops said they’d like to,” the first replies. In real 
life, as in the film, Serpico’s whistleblowing earned him the enmity of many 
colleagues. He was shot by the “perp” he was trying to arrest. Thereal Frank 
Serpico tells the story similarly 
<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/the-police-are-still-out-of-control-112160.html#.VZvO4RNViko>
 to the way it is told in the film, though the film-makers replaced his modest 
revolver with a more dramatic-looking 9mm automatic. Serpico alleges that his 
fellow police officers left the scene and a local man called an ambulance for 
him.

Corruption

The action flashes back to the beginning of Serpico’s career in the 1960s. He 
is a fine cop, but an outsider: he goes to Spanish literature classes and 
learns to dance ballet. His colleagues presume he is gay. When he is handed 
some cash in an envelope, he tries to report it, but is told to drop the 
subject. “Let’s face it, who can trust a cop who doesn’t take money?” asks one 
fellow cop. “I mean, you are a little weird.” He moves from precinct to 
precinct. Instead of fitting in, he finds more and more corruption.

Al Pacino’s performance as the focused, hard-edged and yet hippie-ish Serpico 
is exceptional. DirectorSidney Lumet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/10/sidney-lumet-obituary>’s 
knowledge of New York City locations was unsurpassed: the movie was filmed in 
four of the city’s five boroughs, leaving out only Staten Island. These days, 
though, the movie feels languorous and overlong – even though Waldo Salt’s 
original 240-page screenplay (one page corresponds to about a minute of screen 
time) was cut in half by co-screenwriter Norman Wexler. Furthermore, gender 
politics have moved on since 1973. The characters of Serpico’s two girlfriends 
are hopelessly underdeveloped. One is a manic pixie dream ballerina, the other 
is a whiny doormat, and both of them are inexplicably desperate for him to 
marry them and have babies – which doesn’t seem like a sensible idea. Also, the 
scene in which he buddies up to a rape suspect doesn’t exactly say “good cop” 
to a 21st-century audience, even if he is trying to get the guy to dob in his 
fellow perps.

Characters

Serpico tells friendly cop Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) about the corruption 
problems, and they try to take the story to the mayor’s office – but they’re 
snubbed again. Blair is a fictional character. He stands in for Serpico’s 
real-life friend David Durk, though he plays a smaller part in the story than 
Durk did. In 1971, after the story of NYPD corruption first broke, Sam 
Peckinpah wanted to make this movie as a two-hander, with Paul Newman as Durk 
and Robert Redford as Serpico. The version which made it to the screen followed
Peter Maas’s biography of Serpico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/aug/25/guardianobituaries.books> and 
wrote Durk out.Some of his contemporaries 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/len-levitt/david-durk-another-lost_b_2158778.html>
 saw this as a historical injustice, and it’s certainly true that Frank Serpico 
is much more widely remembered than David Durk. Still, almost all of the 
characters in the movie have been renamed and fictionalised. Historical 
film-makers sometimes have to do this for legal reasons, even if they’d rather 
tell a more accurate story.

When he finally gets an investigation launched, Serpico is cynical about it: 
“A few funky cops thrown to the wolves to protect [the fictional commissioner] 
Delaney and those guys who’ve known about this shit for years and won’t do a 
fucking thing about it. That’s why I won’t testify.” The whiny doormat 
girlfriend finally leaves him. Then comes the drug raid and the shooting. 
Anonymous cards sent to him at the hospital have “get well soon” messages 
crossed out, and instead wish him a “slow death”. This is accurate. At the end 
of the film, a title card says: “Serpico is now living somewhere in 
Switzerland.” Serpico returned to the United States in the early 1980s, and 
still occasionally surfaces – he wrote an article last year questioning police 
conduct in the shooting ofMichael Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting> in Ferguson, 
Missouri.

Verdict

Parts of it drag, and it leaves out a key character, but this is a strong 
biopic of Frank Serpico.
