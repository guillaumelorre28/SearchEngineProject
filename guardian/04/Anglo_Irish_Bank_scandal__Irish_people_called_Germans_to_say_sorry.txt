Irish people rang the German embassy in Dublin to apologise over the behaviour 
of Anglo Irish bankers who made jokes on tape about getting billions of euros 
from Berlin to rescue their debt-ridden bank.

The German ambassador to Ireland, Dr Eckhard Lübkemeier, revealed that in the 
wake of the recent Anglo Irish Bank tapes his embassy staff received calls from 
ordinary Irish citizens saying sorry over the way the bankersmocked the Germans 
and sang their national anthem

 while celebrating the bank's rescue.

Lübkemeier told RTE radio on Wednesday morning: "We got a considerable number 
of emails and calls expressing sympathy with us, withGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> and the German people.

"After these conversations were published, we were reassured … that they were 
in no way indicative of the views of the Irish people.

"It will not affect German-Irish friendship, and the bonds of affection that 
are in place between the Irish and the German people."

The contents of the "Anglo Tapes", which were obtained by the Irish 
Independent,caused outrage in Germany

 after it emerged that Anglo executives sang the German national anthem as 
deposits from the federal republic flowed into Anglo as a result of the bank 
guarantee in late 2008.

Lübkemeier said the attitudes as expressed on the tapes were "indicative of 
the attitudes of bankers in other countries".

"It shows what went wrong in the first place, the banking sector got 
'decoupled' from the real economy.

"We are now left with the legacy," he said.

"We are still trying to cope with the problems … caused by this hubris in the 
banking sector."
