Shahidur Rahman Prodhan sits at his desk in the head office of Dhaka's water 
corporation, D-WASA. "Learn to listen, listen to learn," says a sign on the 
wall behind him. Not what you may expect of a man responsible for supplying 
water and sewerage to a city where millions of people lack access to safe 
water, and less than 20% of the city is covered by a sewerage system. Yet it 
seems that D-WASA has been heeding the quotes. In April the corporation 
established a new citizens charter granting all residents of Dhaka, including 
the landless slum dwellers, the right to apply for a water connection and 
complain about faults. This is truly a landmark move. However, Prodhan concedes 
it is not purely philanthropic, "The provision of water facilitated by the aid 
agencies demonstrated that the slum dwellers were willing and able to pay for 
the service. D-WASA could earn revenue from them." Slum dwellers usually use 
illegal water connections.

D-WASA has recently received US$165.7m from the World Bank to implement Dhaka 
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which will include a pilot project 
supplying water and sanitation to Dhaka's slums. D-WASA will contract local aid 
agencies to achieve this, using its tried and tested approaches. Local agencies 
have paved the way ahead and their skills are in demand, Prodhan acknowledging, 
"We would not be able to supply water to slums without the help of NGOs."
