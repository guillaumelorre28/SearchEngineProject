In G2 Arts (13 October) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/how-we-made-bugsy-malone-jodie-foster-scott-baio-alan-parker>
, you quote Alan Parker as saying he wroteThe Evacuees 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evacuees>. Alan Parker would never claim 
such a thing, so it has to be a mistake. The Emmy-award-winning play was 
written by the late, great playwright, Jack Rosenthal, at the behest of the 
late, great head of Granada TV’s drama department,Peter Eckersley 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Eckersley_(TV_producer)>, in the days when 
ideas were suggested, assessed and commissioned. It was Alan’s first TV play as 
a director and my first TV play as an actress playing her own mother-in-law.
