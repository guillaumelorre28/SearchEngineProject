Cuts may be inevitable, says Tony Russell, a user of mental health services 
and founder of the campaigning group Breakthrough – but the danger is that they 
will be made in all the wrong places. In theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>, unfashionable services such as 
mental health will be first in the firing line, he fears. "I have no problem 
with cuts, but they should not be at the expense of vital services.

"In times of financial crisis, people get depressed, ill and stressed. Demand 
is rising, and mental health services are under pressure. If the nation isn't 
healthy, then everything else is irrelevant," Russell says.

"Make cuts, but make them in expensive IT and communications departments, and 
stop wasting money on fancy brochures promoting foundation trusts. Why do we 
pay for these massive quangos that don't do anything? Let's cut defence 
spending, and pull our troops out of Afghanistan."

Investment has to be focused on the health frontline, Russell argues. He pays 
tribute to "brilliant" clinicians and dedicated local NHS trust chief 
executives, but is sceptical about the value of the upper tiers of the NHS and 
civil service.

He says: "I sometimes think we have lions led by donkeys in the NHS – too many 
decisions made by too many people who know nothing about the reality of mental 
health."
