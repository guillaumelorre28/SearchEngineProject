A1GP <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/a1gp> could be heading to South 
America for the first time after the president of Brazil gave his support to 
the series visiting the country.

President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva met with A1 Team Brazil seat holder 
Emerson Fittipaldi and the Brazilian Minister of Sport, Orlando Silva, to 
discuss the championship and the potential for holding a race in the country.

The former double formula one world champion said: "We are working hard at A1 
Team Brazil to raise the profile and awareness of the national team. It is 
invaluable to have the support of President Lula, Orlando Silva and the 
Government, and it is a goal of ours, in the not too distant future, to have a 
race in Brazil, so we will work with them on this important project."

Fittipaldi also revealed that they had discussed A1GP's 'Think Greener Racing' 
campaign. He said that the President's idea of using Brazilian ethanol fuel in 
the series could be 'very interesting' to explore.
