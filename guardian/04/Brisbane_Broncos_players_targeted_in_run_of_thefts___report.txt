Brisbane’s NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> stars are apparently 
being targeted by thieves, who have made off with more than $150,000 worth of 
property during a series of invasions on players’ homes.

The homes of Broncos Darius Boyd, Ben Hunt, Corey Oates and Lachlan Maranta 
have been robbed over a 10-day period, according to News Corp Australia.

During one of the robberies on June 21, thieves stole a $100,000 Audi A5 from 
the home of Boyd while his pregnant wife, Kayla, slept inside.

Boyd was in Melbourne preparing for the second State of Origin match at the 
time. He said he was thankful the culprits did not harm his partner.

“It could have been worse,” Boyd told the Courier-Mail. “That’s the scariest 
thing. Kayla is pregnant and you want your partner to be safe when you are away 
travelling.”

Five days later, two cars were stolen from Hunts home while he and his partner 
slept.

“There’s nothing I can do now, but you feel violated, so I have to get better 
security,” he told the paper.
