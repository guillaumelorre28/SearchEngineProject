In Italy and Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> this weekend 
a shaken EU faces the first of a series of pivotal electoral tests that could 
profoundly change the political landscape of the bloc, and conceivably herald 
the end of the European project in its current form.

Shortly before last May’s G7 meeting in Tokyo, Martin Selmayr, the senior 
Brussels official who runs the cabinet of the European commission president, 
Jean-Claude Juncker,tweeted what he described as his populist “horror scenario” 
<https://twitter.com/MartinSelmayr/status/735716726617182210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
.

Imagine, he said, if instead of Barack Obama, François Hollande, David Cameron 
and Matteo Renzi, next year’s summit were to feature Donald Trump, Marine Le 
Pen, Boris Johnson and Beppe Grillo.

Selmayr was right about Trump, now the US president-elect. He was half-right 
about Johnson, who missed out on the job of prime minister after Cameron 
resigned following Britain’s Brexit vote, but did become foreign secretary.

If he proves right on the rest, Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will be in serious trouble.

The angry, anti-establishment, nation-first tide that voted to sweep the UK 
out of the EU and Trump into the White House – in what the billionaire property 
developer himself called a “Brexit plus, plus, plus” – is rising steadily 
across the continent.


It is still far from certain to carry all before it. But over the next 12 
months, EU member states face a dozen referendums and parliamentary and 
presidential elections, many contested by populist, Eurosceptic parties whose 
members believe that what happened in the UK and the US can now happen in 
Europe.

The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has said “Europe could die” in the 
face of “attacks from the populists”. German’s doughty finance minister, 
Wolfgang Schäuble, has warned of the scourge of “demagogic populism”, while the 
EU’s economic affairs commissioner,Pierre Moscovici, suggested 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/14/europe-on-brink-of-us-style-leap-into-unknown-top-eu-official-warns>
 Europe’s voters might be poised “to destroy it”.


The first two tests will be on Sunday. In Austria, voters elect a new 
president after theirfirst attempt was annulled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/austrian-presidential-election-result-overturned-and-must-be-held-again-hofer-van-der-bellen>
. In a race currently too close to call, Norbert Hofer, of the anti-immigration 
Freedom party, could become the first freely elected far-right head of state in 
western Europe since the second world war.

On the same day, Italians vote in a referendum on constitutional reforms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/matteo-renzi-repeats-vow-quit-italian-pm-loses-referendum>
 on which Renzi has staked his political future. Polls have suggested the prime 
minister will lose – potentially bringing Grillo’s fiercely anti-establishment 
Five Star Movement a step closer to power.

The Netherlands goes to the polls on 15 March. There, Geert Wilders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/geert-wilders-faces-possible-5000-fine-for-hate-speech>
 and his Eurosceptic, anti-Islam Freedom party is tied in the polls with the 
prime minister, Mark Rutte’s liberal VVD.

Italy’s referendum: five things you need to know 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/dec/02/italys-referendum-five-things-you-need-to-know-video-explainer>
In France, the first round of presidential elections is on 23 April. The 
leader of the far-right, anti-European Front National,Marine Le Pen, is 
expected to advance from this to the runoff stage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national>
 the following month.

Germany votes later, in federal elections that could well see the far-right 
Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) enter parliament as the third-largest party, 
on the back of strong opposition toAngela Merkel’s open-door refugee policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/angela-merkel-defends-german-immigration-policy-elections-afd>
.

And in the Czech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/world/czech-republic> 
in October, the populists of ANO 2011, the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens, are 
forecast to win in the general elections.
Why are financial markets worried about Italy's referendum? 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/explainer-interactive/embed/embed.html?id=4b57e8d2-46c8-4b02-a83c-800a6fb47e0e>
Simon Tilford, of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said the two big 
flashpoints for the union would be Italy’s constitutional referendum and 
France’s presidential election.

“In Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, if Renzi loses the 
referendum, can’t survive, and elections then return a government committed to 
a referendum on taking [the country] out of the euro … that could produce a 
real standoff,” Tilford said.

“And in France, if Le Pen should win ... We don’t know what would happen, but 
she’s talked of a referendum on the euro, and on France’s EU membership. A 
strongly Eurosceptic government inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> would mean a full-blown crisis in 
Europe.”

All this is by no means certain, of course. The populists’ confidence could be 
misplaced. All were quick to welcome the Brexit vote and Trump’s victory as 
events that, in Le Pen’s words, “made possible what was considered impossible”.

But in such uncertain times, voters could opt for continuity and stability: 
polls show support for the EU has surged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/support-for-the-eu-on-the-rise-since-brexit-vote-even-in-the-uk>
 since Britain voted to leave, and polling since the US election suggestsno 
immediate “Trump bounce” 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-22/there-is-no-visible-trump-effect-for-europe-s-populist-parties>
 for the Eurosceptics.

A victory in Austria by Hofer, the candidate from a party founded by a former 
SS officer, would be a huge symbolic blow for Europe and could presage worse in 
parliamentary elections to follow in 2018. Some, however, argue that its actual 
consequences may be limited: the presidential role is largely ceremonial.

In Italy, Renzi could cling on, or be replaced by a technocratic government 
committed to continuing steady, incremental reform. And if snap elections do 
follow, Italy’s electoral system does not necessarily make it easy for a single 
party to gain a majority in both houses of parliament.

In France, every poll so far has predicted Le Pen will lose heavily in the 
second round to a more centrist rival, who, on current form, is likely to be 
the conservative François Fillon. In theNetherlands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands>, even if his toxic party 
emerges as the largest, Wilders is unlikely to be able to form a majority.

But regardless of the electoral outcomes, Europe’s upstarts will still shape 
the debate. Analysts point to the enormous influence exercised by the former 
Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, even though he was never elected to Westminster, and 
how mainstream, centrist parties, particularly on the right, have been pulled 
inexorably to the more radical edge in the Netherlands and France.

Mainstream leaders such as Merkel or Fillon would find themselves weakened, 
heading countries arguably more deeply divided than at any time in the postwar 
era, and struggling to push through their programmes.

For the European project itself, its confidence knocked by Brexit, the 
upcoming Trump presidency, a continuing migrant crisis, the terrorism threat, 
an agonisingly slow return to strong economic growth and the gathering 
Eurosceptic backlash, the consequences could be serious.

Faced with a more pressing need than ever to “get our act together, bring back 
a sense of direction, confidence, order” – as the European council president, 
Donald Tusk, put it – the bloc may find itself less able than ever to actually 
do so.

Its instinct, certainly, will be to pull together and maintain unity at all 
costs – not, from the UK’s perspective, a good sign for productive Brexit 
negotiations – and move forward forcefully where it can.

The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the bloc’s challenge 
must be to provide “outcomes that are both more efficient, and more directly 
aimed at the people, their needs and their fears – not towards 
institution-building”.

Trump’s apparent fondness for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, along 
with his suggestion that US support for Nato – the security umbrella that for 
60 years has made European stability and prosperity possible – may not be 
unconditional, has already prompted progress in one area.

A Franco-German defence and security initiative launched in September has 
gained fresh impetus, with foreign and defence ministers agreeing concrete 
steps to bolster the bloc’s capacity to respond to conflicts and crises on its 
borders. The influential German MEP Manfred Weber said Trump “will force Europe 
to grow up”.

Beyond security, analysts say, the union’s most pressing priority must be 
economic recovery, wage growth, the return of some sense of wellbeing. “Not 
that the whole anti-European backlash is solely attributable to that,” said 
Tilford. “But the poor performance of the EU economy is a very big factor.”

In fact, said Gianni Pittella, the leader of the European parliament’s 
Socialist group, Brexit and Trump had created a “huge opportunity” for strong, 
pragmatic EU initiatives.

Will they happen? Will Europe advance, or crumble? The coming months and years 
will be critical. If anti-Europeans win national elections and the EU fails to 
rise to the nation-first challenge, it will struggle to survive in its present 
form.

Few think it will break up entirely. But its ambitions may shrink; it could 
become more of commercial association than a 60-year-old, overarching political 
project. A hard eurozone core may ultimately emerge, with satellite “associate” 
members.

Some, including in Britain, would regard that as a good thing. But according 
to Mark Leonard, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, in a less open 
world of trade barriers and anti-migrant walls, where solidarity among old 
allies must pass a cost-benefit analysis, they should be careful what they wish 
for.

Ultimately, Leonard said in an article 
<http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europe_alone_in_trumps_world7075> for 
Social Europe, “even Europe’s most Trump-like leaders will find it harder to 
defend their national interest if they try to go it alone. To survive in 
Trump’s world, they should try to make Europe great again.”
