 in the Data Visualisation and Storytelling category, for theRiot Rumours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2011/dec/07/london-riots-twitter> 
data interactive. Riot Rumours was put together with help from an
interdisciplinary team of researchers <http://www.analysingsocialmedia.org/> at 
the Universities of Manchester, St Andrews and Leicester (more information 
about the collaborationhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/twitter-riots-interactive>
).

The awards, organised by the Global Editors Network 
<http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/> and officially supported by Google, are 
the first international competition to recognise outstanding work specifically 
within the discipline of data journalism.

Peter Barron from Google, one of the judges of the awards, commended the 
Guardian's Riot Rumours and said: "this jumps out as the most original and 
compelling piece of data journalism and visualisation."

Justin Arenstein, a judge from the African News Innovation Challenge, said: 
"the visualisation helps to reveal trends and meaning that would not have been 
possible using traditional narrative techniques. The use of bubble graphics and 
organic growth also elegantly reinforce the message that rumours can mimic 
organisms."

The awards were announced on 31 May during a ceremony hosted at the News World 
Summit in Paris and were judged by a jury of ten leading data journalism 
experts.
