The future of work is the elephant in the room in the Labour leadership 
contest (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-labour-leadership-analogue-contest-in-a-digital-age>
, 25 July). The pace of change has been scary and can only continue. Zero-hours 
contracts are just the visible part of a huge shift in work practices, as the 
traditional job-for-life makes way for a casualised, freelance workforce facing 
vast international competitive pressure.

In the film and TV industry in which I work – held up as a dynamic creative 
and economic powerhouse – the growth of the freelance workforce has coincided 
with skills shortages, as well as ageism, sexism and discrimination against 
ethnic minorities, as employers view their workforce as a tap to be turned on 
or off at will.

Other industries will surely follow as the full blast of the global economy is 
unleashed on previously protected corners of the workplace.

It’s not just White Van Man who lives in daily anxiety about where his next 
paycheck is coming from, but middle-class, middle-aged executives who know 
redundancy is always around the next corner. Meanwhile, there is the unseemly 
scrabble, documented by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, for 
the very wealthiest to hold on to those increasingly scarce stable professions 
that guarantee a large income and access to social goods at the very top of 
society (theguardian.com

Against this backdrop, we need a new vision of the welfare state – one that 
can empower and enable freelance workers and cushion the inevitable peaks and 
troughs in employment – and legislation on the rights, conditions, training and 
pay of freelance workers. This is the Britain Labour’s leadership contenders 
need to address if the party is to stand any chance of winning again.

• The issue of a “glass floor” created by well-off parents to ensure their 
children succeed regardless of their ability (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/26/glass-floor-tim-nice-but-dim-state-school-children>
, 27 July), by offering better career guidance and encouraging self-confidence 
and leadership to the detriment of less-advantaged families, must be tackled in 
school.

Our schools should be inspiring all children, and the best way to develop 
confidence, self-esteem and leadership is through having adequate arts 
provision for their pupils from an early enough stage, KS1 onwards. 
Regrettably, too many head teachers give little significance to the arts, 
simply because it’s not a winner with Ofsted inspections or school league 
tables.

The author of the study, Dr Abigail McKnight 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-research-exposes-the-glass-floor-in-british-society>
, says that “schools could do much more to help children from less advantaged 
families build on high early potential” but to fulfil that potential will mean 
a change of mindset by many head teachers to embrace arts-based approaches as a 
key part of their teaching and learning plans.

It seems ludicrous that the arts (along with sport) are rolled out for school 
open days and other special occasions but locked in the art room the rest of 
the time.
