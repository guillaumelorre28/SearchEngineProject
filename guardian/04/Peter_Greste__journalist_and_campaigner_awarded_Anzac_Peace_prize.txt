I lost ours

Greste was the subject of international outcry when he was detained for 400 
days in a Cairo prison

 while covering unrest in Egypt as an Al Jazeera correspondent.

Released in February last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/05/jubilant-peter-greste-says-prison-ordeal-like-a-near-death-experience-and-rebirth>
, he has since used his profile to campaign for imprisoned journalists around 
the world.

A humbled Greste was presented with the RSL’s Anzac Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> award at Brisbane’s Anzac Square 
on Friday, where he laid a wreath and held a moment of silent contemplation.

“It feels very strange to be in this position because a lot of what’s happened 
to me is because of what I’ve come to represent more than what I’ve done,” he 
said.

“Freedom of speech, freedom of press, rule of law and standing up for your 
mates are still principles I’m very proud to represent.”

Greste spent 22 years working as a foreign correspondent, covering apartheid 
in South Africa, central African conflicts and more recently unrest in Egypt.

It allowed him to witness the vast spectrum of human experience.

“For every atrocity, for every act of brutally that you see, you see a dozen 
extraordinary human examples of courage, compassion and goodwill.”

“[They’re] pivotal parts in human history but they also represent so much of 
what make us human.”

The annual RSL award is given to those who promote the concept of 
international understanding and make a contribution to world peace.

RSL national president Ken Doolan said Greste was the perfect candidate.

“[His] selfless attitude and strong sense of social justice captures the very 
essence of the Anzac Peace prize,” he said.

Previous winners include philanthropist Frederick Hyde and the Fred Hollows 
Foundation.

An official ceremony for Greste will be held at the RSL’s AGM in June.
