Team Malaysia and Team France overcame dire weather conditions to win in the 
opening round of the 2008-09A1GP <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/a1gp> 
season at Zandvoort in the Netherlands.

Victory in the sprint race went to Team Malaysia's Fairuz Fauzy, who came from 
fourth on the grid in heavy rain to claim the team's first win in 27 races. 
Team New Zealand's Earl Bamber finished second ahead of Team France's Loic 
Duval. Local hero Jeroen Bleekemolen had started from pole position but was 
classified fourth when the race was stopped early due to two cars crashing in 
the poor conditions.

"It was very difficult on the track today and made even more challenging with 
the lack of experience we have with this new car," said Fauzy. "But we have 
worked really hard as a team and now we have a fantastic win."

Fauzy started the feature race from pole position, but lost time during his 
pit stop, with the win going to Team France's Duval who overcame more bad 
weather and safety car periods. Fauzy finished second ahead of Bamber.

"The weekend was really difficult," said Duval. "We received the car yesterday 
morning and we were in the car for the first time during qualifying. Everything 
was brand new and today it was a really, really tough race. It was hard with 
the safety car but at the end everything went well and the mechanics did a 
great job."

There was a shortened field as six teams – including the British entry – 
failed to take part due to a delay in preparing the new Ferrari-powered A1GP 
cars. There is expected to be a full grid for the second round in China next 
month.
