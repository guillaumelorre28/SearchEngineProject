What to do
 Trace and cut out the shapes, then fold in half. 
1. Using the template, trace and cut out the balloon shapes from your coloured 
paper. You will need to cut 10 to 12 identical shapes for each balloon. Fold 
each shape in half lengthways.

2. Using the templates, trace and cut out the clouds from white paper and the 
birds from blue. For these flat objects, cut two identical shapes for the front 
and back. To assemble, place some thread between two matching shapes and glue 
together.
 Join two matching shapes together by sticking the right half of one to the 
left half of another. 
3. To assemble the three-dimensional hot-air balloons: join two matching 
shapes together by sticking the right half of one to the left half of another. 
Make sure the edges are lined up. Continue to join the shapes, then – before 
fixing the final pair of shapes – insert a length of thread for hanging and 
stick to hold in place.

4. Cut a thin strip of coloured paper. Wrap and fix around the base of the 
completed balloon to help it keep its shape.

5. Glue the two- and three-dimensional objects to the lengths of thread, 
leaving 25cm of the thread clear at the end.

6. When all your objects have been stuck to your lengths of thread, tie the 
top ends around your embroidery hoop and secure with a double knot. Make sure 
that the items are evenly spaced and balanced around the hoop to ensure that it 
will hang correctly.

7. Use thread or ribbon to hang your mobile from the ceiling.
