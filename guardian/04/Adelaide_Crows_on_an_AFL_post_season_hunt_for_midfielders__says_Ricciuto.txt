Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> powerbroker Mark 
Ricciuto has signalled the club is hunting for more midfielders after being 
knocked out of the AFL finals. Ricciuto, a board member and chairman of the 
Crows’ list management committee, says Adelaide’s playing list is “pretty good” 
but needs improving.

“If they can find another mid through the draft or trade or whatever, then 
that can only be a good thing,” Ricciuto told Triple M radio on Monday. “We 
have got a pretty good list now but it needs to get better to win flags.”

With veteran midfielder Scott Thompson uncertain to be offered a contract for 
next season, Ricciuto said “other blokes need to stand up”. “Brad Crouch needs 
to have a good off-season, Matt Crouch needs to continue (developing),” he 
said. “Young Harrison Wigg is coming along quite nicely, young (Wayne) Milera 
is going to improve next year, Riley Knight will improve next year.”

Ricciuto called for a cool-headed review into Adelaide’s finals campaign after 
being eliminated by Sydney in a semi-final - the second consecutive year the 
Crows have fallen at that stage. “Emotion takes over for a couple of days,” he 
said.

“But you have just got to have a good review and work out where you need to 
improve and how you can improve and then go and do it. After you get knocked 
out, things start getting bandied around a bit more - a lot of clubs don’t talk 
about your players while you are playing out of respect, but there is always 
movement at clubs.”


“Some players will move for opportunities, some will move because you want 
them to move, and then some will just get better from getting a little bit 
older. It’s always an interesting off-season.”

Meanwhile, Sydney’s injured stars will be put through their paces on 
Wednesday, with ruckman Kurt Tippett shaping up well in his bold bid to play 
Friday night’sAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> preliminary final. 
Swans coach John Longmire and the club’s medical staff face some tough calls 
this week, with Tippett (broken jaw), Gary Rohan (bruised leg), Jarrad McVeigh 
(calf strain) and Callum Mills (hamstring strain) all in doubt for the clash 
with Geelong.

Scans have cleared both Rohan and McVeigh, who were hurt in the Swans’ 
semi-final win over Adelaide, of serious damage. There was a sense of relief at 
the SCG on Monday, especially for Rohan given the speedster was taken from the 
field on a stretcher and has endured a luckless run since breaking his leg in 
2012.

But McVeigh and Rohan still face an uphill battle as they seek to prove their 
fitness during a six-day turnaround. Tippett and Mills, who were injured in 
week one of the finals, are also in the mix for a recall but likewise have a 
lot of work to do in a short space of time.

Longmire was reluctant to comment about the quartet’s chances of tackling 
Geelong, noting the club’s training session on Wednesday would be crucial. “We 
don’t want to rule anyone in or out. We’ll give them every opportunity,” 
Longmire said on Monday. “We’ll certainly get more of an idea on Wednesday but 
we may have to wait until Thursday and see how players pull up from training.”

Mills ran laps on Monday morning but Sydney will be reluctant to roll the dice 
on him and McVeigh given the risk of recurrence with their respective setbacks. 
Tippett has trained well since his jaw was inadvertently broken by Callan Ward 
in a ruck contest and is considered the most likely of the sidelined Swans to 
be picked.

“He was able to play out the game against GWS. He was able to train really 
well here on Sunday,” Longmire said. “It’ll come down to a discussion between 
coaching staff, medical staff and Kurt on Wednesday. Then we’ll see how he 
pulls up and how he feels.”

Zak Jones, who has recovered from a nasty concussion, Harry Cunningham and 
Dean Towers are the frontrunners to be recalled should Longmire be forced to 
make some changes. Rohan was clearly distressed and in a lot of pain after 
hurting himself in a marking contest on Saturday night.

There was no shortage of speculation about the 25-year-old’s setback, with 
pundits’ diagnoses ranging from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to 
bone damage. “That’s why it’s important not to to jump to too many conclusions 
too early,” Longmire said. “It was obviously a concern for him and his family 
after being through what he’s been through a few years ago in that particular 
leg.

“You can understand his apprehension but it was great news when he got the 
results back of the scans that the bone itself was in good nick.”
