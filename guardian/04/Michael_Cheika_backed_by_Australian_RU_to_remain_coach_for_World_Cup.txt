Michael Cheika <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-cheika> has been 
backed by the Australian Rugby Union to remain as their coach until after the 
2019 World Cup at least, despite leading the team to nine defeats this year.

Cheika signed a contract extension in May only months after his side made last 
year’s World Cup final against the All Blacks.

The Wallabies have since been hammered 3-0 by a resurgent England at home, 
thrashed by the All Blacks three times and also lost to Ireland and a poor 
South Africa side.

The ARU chief, Bill Pulver, said: “Believe me, Michael Cheika is under no 
pressure. None whatsoever. He’s the coach through to 2019 and there’s no one 
better to do the job.”

With the All Blacks in transition after six stalwarts retired, Australia were 
hoping to reclaim the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 2003. However, 
demoralised by their series defeat to England, they failed to reach any great 
heights during the season, though they did perform well during patches against 
the All Blacks in October andEngland last Saturday

.

“I’m not pleased to have lost nine Test matches,” Pulver said. “And boy, let 
me tell you, Cheika isn’t either. But there are really encouraging signs in 
terms of talent coming through.

“One of Michael’s focus points is to make sure you’ve got multiple players 
competing for the one position, and that leads to better performances and 
outcomes.

“I think we’re getting there and if you look at this as a long-term game 
towards the 2019 World Cup, I think rugby fans are quietly comfortable with the 
way we’re developing players.”
