Stephen Conroy <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/stephen-conroy> has 
named factional powerbrokers Don Farrell, Richard Marles and David Feeney as 
those who “have got Bill Shorten’s back” after his resignation as the senator 
apologised for catching colleagues by surprise.

In an interview on Sky News on Tuesday Conroy defended his policy legacy in 
media reform.

Conroy resigned from the Senate on Thursday evening, tabling a speech

 explaining that he did so for family reasons. When the news broke on Friday it 
caught the acting Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, by surprise mid-press 
conference.

On Sky on Tuesday, Conroy said he had “apologised profusely” to Plibersek. “I 
have to say I am embarrassed about poor Tanya –she’s a very dear friend of mine 
and I did embarrass her,” he said.

Conroy explained that the other senior figure in the Labor left, Anthony 
Albanese <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese>, knew of 
his resignation because he had told him during a conversation about Labor’s 
national executive and the appointment of its next secretary.

He said he had informed Shorten by text message 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/17/stephen-conroy-informed-bill-shorten-about-resignation-by-text-message>
 because the Labor leader was in Canada at the time.

Conroy said he hadn’t known Plibersek was holding a press conference but 
hetook “full responsibility”.

Asked whether his resignation could weaken Shorten’s leadership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/the-conroy-conundrum-enforcers-departure-leaves-bill-shorten-exposed>
, he said: “There are a whole range of people that have got Bill Shorten’s back.

“Don Farrell is a passionate Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> supporter and has 
been for a long period of time … And Richard Marles will be working within the 
Victorian group along with David Feeney and a whole group of other people.”

Farrell is in the box seat

 to replaceConroy <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/stephen-conroy> 
as deputy Senate leader despite his history of tension with Labor’s current 
Senate leader, Penny Wong.

Reflecting on his policy legacy, Conroy conceded he had “made some mistakes 
along the way” but trusted his impact was on the whole positive.

He defended failed media law reforms, rejecting the characterisation that 
Labor had attacked free speech when itproposed the creation of public interest 
media advocate 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-19/mps-knuckle-down-for-media-law-debate/4582696>
to oversee media mergers and the Press Council.

“I still believe that Press Council is a fairly irrelevant organisation,” he 
said. “It has improved but due to the pressure that there could be some 
regulatory reform.”

Asked whether he was or had ever been a global warming sceptic, Conroy 
replied: “I’ve always said publicly that I think humans are affecting the 
temperature and there’s a big scientific debate about how much – that’s always 
been part of the debate.”

Reflecting on advice he would give a young person considering entering 
politics, he said: “I’m not sure I could put my hand on my heart and say go for 
it – because it’s a pretty tough, fierce media environment.

“That’s a little sad. Being in politics is a noble profession. You can make a 
difference – I’d like to think I made a difference.

“It is getting harder and harder, with the rise of right and leftwing 
extremists and the demands of the media cycle – even when there’s not much 
happening you’ve got to make it sound like something’s happening.”
