Tuesday, Melanie Safka

Safka's voice is often described as fragile and vulnerable, but it has a 
clear, open-throated howl of a top end that hits you in the stomach, then falls 
into a whisper in a beat. Every casual word is placed like she's in 
conversation. What strikes me about her is that her music holds me in my middle 
age as much as it ever did in my adolescence.

White Chalk, PJ Harvey

I just find PJ Harvey so mesmerising to watch because she remains 
unfathomable. She is the kind of woman who makes you rue the day you weren't 
born her. She always seems to be the cat that walks alone and you don't feel 
you are supposed to know her. Her latest album, White Chalk, made me cry. It's 
not a howling piece of work, it doesn't go for the blatant heart stabbing, but 
she paints a direct picture. Its honesty really brings tears to your eyes.

Rubberband Girl, Kate Bush


It may seem an easy choice; her eclectic, iconoclastic edge means there are 
very few people who don't like her. But I admire the way she manages to 
disassociate herself from any old commercial baggage and has found a way to 
wander without hindrance. I envy her that. She seems to understand that the 
voice is an instrument like any other; the tones she produces are not always 
designed to be comfortable, in the same way a great horn player after mastering 
his sound proceeds to deconstruct the beauty of it.

Patience of Angels, Eddi Reader


Eddi is the only female singer I claim as a friend, although our paths rarely 
cross these days. What struck me about her when we first met, and what strikes 
me still, is that singing is what she has to do. Audience or not, singing is a 
daily act for her. That which tortured me was her escape and I marvel at that 
purity. She as strange and beautiful a soul as any I remember.

Strict Machine, Goldfrapp

I have always loved a hard-faced girl. I get that Alison Goldfrapp isn't easy 
and I like her belligerence. She's deeply sexy and controlled, like a Strict 
Machine, and it seems to wind the b'jesus out of the women I know. On the 
outside, I watch and smile and will her on like a twisted silent maiden aunt in 
the dark corner.

Marry Me, St Vincent

Annie Clark aka St Vincent is a new girl on the block who I'm just getting to 
know. Marry Me is a track that creeps under your skin and leaves you feeling 
like you have known it forever. Clark is a multi-instrumentalist who has what 
she needs to be in control of her own creativity, and I like that.

Try (Just A Little Bit Harder), Janis Joplin


Janis was a favourite of mine as a youngster, although I don't look her way 
too often these days. I think this is because she was very informative to me as 
a young singer, but that was before I got the urge to resurrect her and say 
"It's only a sodding bloke... Kick him into touch." However, to a young girl 
she was a force of nature, a kindred spirit I more easily recognised myself in 
than the gentle nymphs of the time.

Midnight Train to Georgia, Gladys Knight


Of all the soul divas, Gladys Knight was the one for me. Knight's always been 
about tone and heart, none of the big showboating or extraneous doodling. She 
nailed a melody and only played a little around the edges like Ma Staple. Not 
revisited enough when soul singers are mentioned. Great voice.
