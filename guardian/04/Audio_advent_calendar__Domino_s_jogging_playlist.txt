You're not going to be thinking of jogging for a few weeks (we hope) but when 
you do want to burn off those Christmas calories, Domino have put together 
their ultimateLet's Get Physical playlist.

Here's what they had to say about it ...

Around this time of year it's common to read newspaper articles about how 
we're all in risk of eating 10,000 calories on Christmas Day and that we should 
really consider eating fruit salad instead of pudding, and replace the turkey 
with a cabbage. No offence to the people who write this kind of stuff, but it's 
not going to happen.Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> Day is the one day we can 
all eat till we feel as if we might faint, and not feel too bad about it. Well 
at least that's how feel until New Year rolls around and we automatically 
regret what we've put our bodies through. Most people's response to this is to 
go running so with that in mind, here at Domino we've compiled a playlist 
perfect for a jog around the park. Featuring the likes of Four Tet, These New 
Puritans, Yo Majesty, and remixers such as Joy Orbison, Nathan Fake, and Fake 
Blood, the playlist is a pretty intense 4x4 affair, which is guaranteed to get 
your adrenaline pumping. Happy gorging."
