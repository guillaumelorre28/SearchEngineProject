As we shuffle one day closer to Christmas, the Hundred in the Hands have 
created aSpotify playlist 
<http://open.spotify.com/user/warprecords/playlist/2wDQCBeExBM0U8t6miHeRX> to 
help banish those winter blues. Here's what they had to say ...


It can feel hard to keep up with things on the road – and we spent most of 
last year touring. The long, tedious hours are spent listening to familiar 
favourites: classic soul, mutant R&B and avant-pop classics. Even so, there's 
nothing quite like getting addicted to something new – and there have been 
massive records this year, songs that wormed their way into our thoughts to 
soundtrack the slow passing of the road ahead. These are tracks from bands we 
played shows with, friends and neighbours who kept us on our toes, artists we 
adore and are always excited to check out, and forward-thinking cuts that made 
us jealous and more than a little hot and bothered."
