Villeneuve, whose latest film Arrival is in cinemas now and who is also 
onboard for the Blade Runner sequel, Blade Runner 2049, will try to avoid 
joining the ranks of directorswho have tried and failed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/09/dune-paramount-frank-herbert> to 
follow up David Lynch’s original.


Both Taken director Pierre Morel and Friday Night Lights director Peter Berg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/05/dune-pierre-morel> were lined up 
for a reboot in 2010, but it failed to materialize, while Alejandro 
Jodorowsky’s aborted 10-hour attempt has been described as “the greatest sci-fi 
film never made

”.

Originally published in two parts in Analog magazine, the story of Paul 
Atreides’s adventures on Arrakis becamea cult favourite in sci-fi circles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/03/dune-50-years-on-science-fiction-novel-world>
 before repeating the feat when David Lynch’s so-bad-it’s-good adaptation came 
out in 1984.

Made for $40m, the film ended up losing $10m at the box office but went on to 
have a second life on home video and DVD. The original novel wenton to 
influence the likes of George RR Martin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/30/frank-herbert-dune-at-50-sci-fi-masterpiece>
, and also spawned a TV mini-series.
