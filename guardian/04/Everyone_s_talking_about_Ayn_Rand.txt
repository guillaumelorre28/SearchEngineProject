Ayn Rand's gospel of unadulterated laissez-faire capitalism seems to be 
gaining popularity among a new generation of followers.

It may not come as a surprise that the Tea Party movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tea-party-movement> in the US is using 
Rand, the Russian-American who developed a philosophical system called 
Objectivism, as a posthumous poster girl for lower taxes, with banners reading 
"I am John Galt" â€“ a reference to the idealised hero of her 1957 magnum opus 
Atlas Shrugged. Or that elaborate public talks on her radical philosophy are 
being sponsored by the economically rightwing Adam Smith Institute in London. 
But this week she also surfaced in popular culture with a starring role on BBC2 
in All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, the documentary by Adam Curtis.

In the US, though, a filmed version of Atlas Shrugged is reaching contemporary 
audiences and feeding ambition in a new generation of the fiscally conservative 
nearly 30 years after Rand's death. Reviewers have derided this first 
instalment in a planned trilogy ("rushed, amateurish and clumsy" 
<http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/movies/atlas-shrugged-part-i-ayn-rands-opus-review.html>
, said the New York Times), while the Randians love it. But above all, everyone 
is talking about it.

Sadly, the producers of the $15m, independently financed film say that they 
have no desire to distribute it beyond the US at this point. Which means those 
of us in the UK who might like to have had the opportunity to form our own 
opinions can only follow Atlas and shrug.
