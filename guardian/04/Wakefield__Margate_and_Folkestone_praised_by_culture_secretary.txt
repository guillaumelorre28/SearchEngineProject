During a speech on philanthropy and the arts this week, Jeremy Hunt singled 
out Wakefield, Margate and Folkestone: they are all towns which have been 
transformed by art, he argued, with new galleries – and in Folkestone's case,
its second triennial of contemporary art

.

The culture secretary is right, of course. The new buildings, both by architect
David Chipperfield <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-chipperfield>
, and the work within them, are all first-class – though they are mostly 
publicly funded. The triennial is a brilliant day out and a good example 
of what Hunt would like to see more of: it is 77% privately funded.

Already visitor numbers, seen by the Diary, are stunning. The new Hepworth in 
Wakefield last week welcomed its 100,000th visitor, less than five weeks after 
it opened, putting it easily on course to exceed its first-year target of 
150,000. At Turner Contemporary in Margate, they have had 144,952 visitors 
since opening 11 weeks ago, just short of the same 150,000 target. And in 
Folkestone there have been an incredible 30,000 visitors in the first 10 days – 
that compares to the 51,000 it had during the whole 2008 Triennial.
