History is against Western Sydney winning Sunday’s A-League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> grand final - but history is 
there to be broken, according to coach Tony Popovic.

Few sides have lifted the championship trophy away from home, with just one in 
the competition’s 10 years managing to clinch a decider interstate, when Sydney 
FC beat Melbourne Victory on penalties in 2010 at Etihad stadium.

The Wanderers will attempt to become the second when they play Adelaide United

Adelaide Oval.

“History is there to be broken,” Popovic said.

“And history will be broken tomorrow, because either us or Adelaide will win 
their first championship.

“So that’s not a concern for us - we control what we can control.

“We’ve had a good record away from home, we believe in our football whether 
that’s home or away and, tomorrow, we’re in Adelaide because Adelaide finished 
first.

“They’re the premiers and deserve to have the grand final at home.

“That does not mean we can’t win the final.

“We’re full of confidence - we’re used to big games and, this time, we do it 
in front of 50,000 people in Adelaide.”

The fully-fit Wanderers held their final training session on Saturday at 
Coopers Stadium, having opted against training on Friday at Adelaide Oval.

A low-scoring tactical contest is the dominant prediction but the Reds are 
narrow favourites to beat the Wanderers to a maiden title.

Not only because of the familiar venue and home crowd, but also due to the 
fact Guillermo Amor’s playing group have enjoyed an extra two days’ rest, while 
the Wanderers endured a sapping semi-final that went to extra-time.

Rival coach Amor says Sunday’s A-League grand final will be won by the side 
who can keep their collective heads under pressure.


“In these games, to be calm, a big personality and character ... in the big 
games normally, it’s important to use the head,” Amor told reporters.


Amor has vast personal playing experience in massive matches, from World Cup 
and European Championship games for Spain, to Champions League and Copa del Rey 
fixtures for Barcelona.

And Amor, remarkably in a grand final in his first season managing a senior 
team, believes there is another key ingredient for success: enjoyment.


“It’s important to play in big games, finals,” he said.


“It’s good that we are playing in Adelaide at home – this is very important 
for our people. Tomorrow is a big day in Adelaide.


“And it’s important to enjoy the final.”


Amor’s Reds enter Sunday’s decider with incredible momentum, having lost just 
one of their past 20 games – a streak that lifted them from winless and last 
after eight rounds, to capturing the Premiers Plate.


United then trounced Melbourne City 4-1 in a home semi-final, while the 
Wanderers were forced to dig deep in their extra-time 5-4 thriller against 
Brisbane.


But despite having two days’ extra rest and home ground advantage, Amor was 
wary of the Wanderers.


“Tomorrow will be a difficult game against a very good team,” Amor said.


“They play very well, they run and run and press and, with the ball, is a very 
good team ... we must do things very good to win.”
