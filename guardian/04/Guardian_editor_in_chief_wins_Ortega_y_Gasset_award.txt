Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, has received an Ortega y 
Gasset award, presented by El Pais.

The award acknowledges his work in transforming the Guardian into a global 
leader in online media, and for "his fight to defend journalism and citizens' 
right to information, as illustrated by the exclusive publication of the Edward 
Snowden leaks."

The award, which comes with a â‚¬15,000 prize and a plaque created by the Basque 
artist Eduardo Chillida, will be handed out at a ceremony in Madrid on Thursday 
22 May.
