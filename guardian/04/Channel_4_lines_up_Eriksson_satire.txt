Channel 4 is to give its own particular take on the World Cup with a satirical 
documentary about Sven-Goran Eriksson's "lives and loves" from comedy film-maker
Alison Jackson <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/alison-jackson>.

Sven - The Coach, His Cash and His Lovers will be a centrepiece of the 
broadcaster's summer schedule, which was unveiled today.

The authored film, which comes from the same team behind More4's David 
Blunkett satire A Very Social Secretary, will mix documentary interviews and 
archive footage with satirical dramatic reconstructions in whatChannel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> describes as Jackson's "unique 
voyeuristic" style.

Contributors will include Faria Alam, the Football Association secretary who 
famously had an affair with Eriksson, comedian Keith Allen and publicist Max 
Clifford.

Jackson came to prominence with her BBC2 series Doubletake, in which she 
re-created fictional scenes involving celebrities. One memorable sketch 
featured an Eriksson-alike placing his shoes outside a bedroom door before 
bedding an Ulrika Jonsson lookalike.

Other new shows include a comedy panel show, Best of the Worst, featuring 
Johnny Vaughan and David Mitchell as team captains.

Hosted by Alexander Armstrong, the series will feature rounds where the panel 
get to discuss issues such as the world's worst album covers, lookalikes or 
religious sightings.

And in a move that Channel 4 has described as "audacious", a new Friday night 
show, Whatever, will see 12 young people who have never worked in television 
production given complete creative freedom to come up with their own series.
