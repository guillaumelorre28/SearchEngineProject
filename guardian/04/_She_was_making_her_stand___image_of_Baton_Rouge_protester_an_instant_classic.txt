As tens of thousands of people protest with renewed vigor following the police 
shooting deaths ofPhilando Castile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting> and Alton 
Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alton-sterling-shooting> and 
react to thefive Dallas police officers that were killed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dallas-police-shooting> by a sniper, one 
photograph has emerged from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a symbol of the civil 
unrest that has spread across the nation.

The image, taken by Jonathan Bachman for Reuters, shows a woman, who has been 
identified as Iesha L Evans, standing in a long dress in the face of a line of
Louisiana <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana> state troopers 
dressed in riot gear outside of police headquarters. Evans looks calm and 
poised and almost seems to repel the two officers who are charging towards her.

She was reportedly one of 102 protesters arrested in Baton Rouge, along with 
the prominent activist DeRay Mckesson, who were detained on charges of 
obstructing the highway. Hundreds more werearrested across the country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/10/micah-johnson-dallas-gunman-explosives-attack>
 as protests continued in response to the police shootings in Minnesota and 
Louisiana.

Bachman, a New Orleans-based freelancer, told the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36759711> that Evans broke away from 
protesters and stood in front of the officers.

“I was on the side of the road photographing protesters arguing with police,” 
he said. “I looked over my right shoulder and saw the woman step onto the road. 
She was making her stand. She said nothing and was not moving. It was clear 
that the police were going to have to detain her.”

He said Evans was arrested shortly after. 

The picture was shared widely on social media on Sunday. A post on Facebook by 
the prominent writer Shaun King garnered more than 35,000 likes. The photograph 
drew comparisons to other historic images such as those showing the Tiananmen 
Square protests in 1989.

Evans is reportedly a nurse in New York with a five-year-old child. After the 
arrest she wrote on a Facebook page that appeared to belong to her: “This is 
the work of God. I am a vessel! Glory to the most high! I’m glad I’m alive and 
safe.”
