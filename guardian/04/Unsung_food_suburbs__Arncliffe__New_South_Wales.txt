Just off the major roadway heading south out of Sydney, the suburb of 
Arncliffe hides away a feast of Lebanese food treasures. Manoosh, the usual 
breakfast staple of flat pizza-like bread with a scattered sprinkle of za’atar 
or sweetly spiced minced meat, is found at bakeries clustered near the train 
station or along Wollongong Road. Falafel is wrapped in bread or presented with 
a plated pile of swirled hummus. Fried cauliflower or meltingly soft-baked 
eggplants make up vegetable rolls, while sweet pastries tower on 
cellophane-wrapped takeaway platters ready to finish at home.

Lebanese migrants have clustered here and brought with them village-style 
bakeries, where families supply the dough and fillings and the bakery provides 
the heat to finish. Mixed in among the mosques and churches, the older RSL is 
just holding in with a Chinese bistro and cheap beer. While Arncliffe is only a 
short stretch from the busy city and international airport, it keeps a small 
community feel through its food.

Just as you exit the train station is a family bakery that also makes pizzas 
in the traditional style and has an endless parade of baked goodies coming out 
of the ovens and destined for a family celebration. Za’ata – a mix of oregano, 
thyme, sumac and salt – is sprinkled on a lightly oiled pizza base for the most 
basic of toppings. Pair up with a cheese pizza, which mixes cheddar and 
haloumi, or a minced meat and tomato topped option, or all three. The usual 
drink to accompany is ayran, slightly salty thin yoghurt that works perfectly 
with spicy food.

 Pleased to meat you: Hourani Halal. Photograph: Alison Byrne for the Guardian 
While the usual cuts of meat are available, this halal butcher offers 
something different for your next BBQ. Try spicy sujuk sausages grilled, sliced 
or crumbled into a homemade pide, or sweeter spiced ma’anet sausages with a 
little less chilli. When available, a large piece of cured basturma, the 
Lebanese equivalent of pastrami, hangs from hook behind the counter. Buy per 
slice or pre prepared in the fridge when they have run out. A good source for 
sweetmeats and the necessary fine minced lamb and spices for homemade kibbeh 
and kafta.

Often mentioned as having the best falafel in the area, the unsung heroes here 
are the vegetable wraps filled with fried and spiced cauliflower or baked 
eggplant (or a mix of both). Breakfast with a difference means labneh,ful 
mudammas 
<http://www.dedemed.com/mediterranean/ful-mudammas-recipe-breakfast-beans> or 
foul (a bowl of slow braised fava beans with a slick of oil and lemon on top), 
a plate of hummus topped with spiced lamb or warm msabha chickpea dip. Rip up 
flat bread into small scooping pieces and dip into each in turn. Try eggs and 
spicy shish sausage and don’t forget the side plate of pickles, fresh tomato 
and cucumber.

the Guardian 
Lebanese pastry shops are an Aladdin’s cave of sweet treats. Piled high on 
platters or presented in the large flat pans they were baked in, it’s hard to 
select just a few. Said Pastry offers pistachio baklava in tubes, squares, and 
rolled nests, syrupy semolina cakes, date paste filled slices, nut crusted 
squares and small sweet treats to bite on while you sip a bitter black coffee. 
You can buy the cakes and pastries either individually or per kilo, or select 
the prepackaged platters in pretty clear cellophane wrapping.

Naji’s Charcoal Chicken and Kebabs

Opposite the train station is an option to the pizzas and bakeries. While the 
chicken, burgers and chips are the usual milk bar style, the kebabs and falafel 
rolls here make it a popular and busy spot. The sujuk roll or kafta burgers are 
something different. Afterwards, a fruity finish is worth sharing just a few 
doors up at Ranoush Juice and Cocktails. Try the Lebanese Cocktail, a tall 
glass layered with avocado and fruit juices, filled to the brim with fruit and 
topped with cream, honey and nuts.
