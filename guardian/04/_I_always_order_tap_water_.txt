What is your biggest guilty green secret? 

Flying a total of 7,500 miles (from London to Prince Edward Island in Canada 
and back) to highlight the forthcoming harp-seal hunt - but I did offset it.

What was the last nice green thing you did?

Deciding never to buy bottled water, and always ordering tap water in 
restaurants.

If you could buy any green gadget, what would it be?

A windmill and solar panels so I could be self-sufficient in energy. 

What wakes you up in a sweat in the middle of the night? 

The thought that floating in the Pacific ocean is a collection of plastic 
waste the size of Texas.

What skill do you have for a post-oil world? 

I don't have one but I am willing to learn. 

What would you save, apart from your family and friends, come the floods?

My snorkel and flippers.

for Animals, which campaigns against the international fur trade. The 
commercial seal hunt is due to begin at the end of this month. Information:
