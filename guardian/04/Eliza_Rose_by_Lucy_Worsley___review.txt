Elizabeth Camperdowne lives in Tudor England with her father and very strict 
aunt in a crumbling castle: Stonetron Castle. Destined to be married off at a 
very young age, our red-haired twelve-year-old heroine has before her a future 
of an arranged marriage to a man many years older than herself, and looking 
after her children to continue the family line.

Then her future husband turns out to be an 18-year-old drunk, who has secretly 
married a chambermaid. Elizabeth does not conform, and due to her bad 
behaviour, she is sent to Trumpton Hall, a school for rich young ladies to 
learn manners. There she meets her cousin, Katherine Howard.

Her cousin is the oldest and most beautiful of the girls and she teases Eliza 
about her red hair. Eliza has a hard time at the school; she believes she and 
the young, handsome music teacher are in love, and then discovers that he has 
been pretending while seeing Katherine.

At the age of 15 she and Katherine are sent to the court of Henry VIII. They 
are both ladies-in-waiting to the new queen, Anne of Cleeves. When she is 
rejected by the king, Katherine takes her place.

Court life is dangerous, but how dangerous will it get for Katherine?

This book is a real eye-opener on the Tudor court. It shows an entirely 
different side to what happened to Katherine Howard. The characters are very 
vividly imagined and are most entertaining.
