Roald Dahl’s tales of dastardly witches, bad parents and greedy idiots have 
thrilled children and adults for generations, from James and the Giant Peach in 
1961 through to Matilda and Esio Trot, the author’s final books before his 
death in 1990. His wicked sensibility had a way of creeping under your skin and 
leaving an impression.

Now, as Matilda the Musical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/25/matilda-review>, the West End 
and Broadway hit written by local hero Tim Minchin, opens at Sydney’s Lyric 
theatre, we ask leading Australian arts figures to name the Roald Dahl story 
that has stuck with them into adulthood. Read on, then why not share your own 
favourite Dahl in the comments below.

Roald Dahl altered my childhood – by a long shot. He was a standard part of 
the culture. The BFG was huge for me, and George’s Marvellous Medicine and 
Danny, Champion of the World. I was 13 when Matilda came out, so I wasn’t 
reading Dahl by then. But in the early 1980s I loved him. I had a penchant for 
being a bit naughty and he felt a bit naughty. I even tried to write like him 
and got into trouble for putting naughty words in my stories.

James and the Giant Peach (1961)

As a child I was entranced by the cover of my Puffin edition; a thousand 
seagulls tied to the stem of a giant golden peach with strings, carrying it 
high above the sea. I loved the idea that a cosy home might be made inside the 
seed – how wonderful it was to escape the cruelties of those nasty aunts, 
Spiker and Sponge! I remember feeling anxious as James and his band of giant 
insect friends were forced to eat the peach; I cared deeply about James and 
wanted him to find his way. Dahl’s story held all my fears, my hopes and my own 
dreams of shelter and escape.

I had all the Roald Dahl books as a kid and loved his great, revolting 
villains – the Twits, George’s grandmother, the Grand High Witch and, of 
course, The Trunchbull. But it’s a quote from James and the Giant Peach that 
has always stuck with me because of its beautiful rhythm. “Let us roll! Let us 
bowl! Let us plunge! Let’s go rolling and bowling and spinning until we’re away 
from old Spiker and Sponge!” I’m still hoping to run away on a magical fruit 
... and to play one of his villains.

The Witches (1983)


Two Englishmen – Roald Dahl and David Attenborough – were the gods of my 
childhood. I would dream of sharks and polar bears and lemurs one night, and 
then vermicious knids and women with bald heads and clawed fingers and square 
toes the next. The Witches is the best of his creations for my money. It’s a 
strange, bold, dark book that manages to be a rollicking adventure and an 
existential treatise at once.

 Angelica Huston as the Grand High Witch in The Witches film. 
My favourite Roald Dahl book is The Witches. It terrified and excited me. All 
at once a heroic adventure and a nightmare. Anjelica Huston as The Grand High 
Witch [in the film version], for me, captured everything a Dahl villain should.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964)



Dahl’s stories are part of any childhood spent with words. Because his books 
are both funny and highly enjoyable, they enable children to become readers – 
to become excited by language. Learning happens while also having a good time.

The Twits (1980)

My favourite Roald Dahl story as a child was probably The Twits, although I 
also adored The Witches, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr Fox 
and The BFG. What Roald Dahl understood, like almost no other writer, is 
children’s utter fascination with all things nasty, revolting and taboo. I 
remember how much I loved the description of the rotting bits of food caught in 
Mr Twit’s beard and the despicable things that Mr and Mrs Twit did to one 
another. Dahl offered a fun but also seriously dark counter narrative to the 
wholesomeness and light that characterises a lot of children’s literature, and 
I love him for it!

The sense of humour contained within this book redefined the world for me.

Fantastic Mr Fox (1970)

Like many children in Belgium in the 1970s, I grew up in a gentrified suburbia 
that was surrounded by nature and agriculture. Our house was a modernist 
bungalow but surrounded by fields and paddocks, all owned by Alphonse, a grumpy 
old farmer on clogs who would still work his fields with a workhorse and milk 
his cows by hand. The man would often scare us and Fantastic Mr Fox was just 
the kind of character you would love to see take on that farmer. Old Alphonse 
has long since died and, sadly, his fields have been cut up into neat housing 
plots by developers. Where would Mr Fox live now, I wonder?

The Minpins (1991)

 The Minpins was published just after his death and was his last piece of 
writing. Something seemed magical about reading a person’s final work. I loved 
it so much because the forest where the Minpins lived looked exactly like my 
own back garden. I was obsessed with the idea that nature contains little 
creatures that might one day become my friend so every time I was in the 
garden, I’d look closely at every little plant or tree or crevice, just in case 
something came out to say hello. It gave me an appreciation for the detail in 
nature I might not have had otherwise. Also, the hero Billy rides a swan. What 
child doesn’t adore the idea of that?

Over To You (1946)


My folks fed me Dahl from day one. I’d consume it, regurgitate, then wolf it 
again. I remember the pain of not being able to pick a favourite. Fantastic Mr 
Fox, The Witches … the more I re-devoured the harder it got. So I climbed the 
“adult” shelves in our family’s bookstore and boggled at what I found: Uncle 
Oswald, Henry Sugar and Kiss Kiss (I still finger the spine of my battered 
first edition when I pass it). But it was Over To You, his collection of second 
world war pilot stories – their chilling blend of truth and madness, like war 
itself – that blitzed my 11-year-old brain. I had the chance to tell him it was 
my favourite. He signed my copy, grumpy, growling: “You’re too young for that 
stuff.” For months afterwards – a lifetime for a boy – I was champion of the 
world.

The inscription says:

To Toby
love
