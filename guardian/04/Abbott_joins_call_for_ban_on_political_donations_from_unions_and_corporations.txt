Tony Abbott has joined Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and a growing 
chorus of Liberals calling for only individuals to be allowed to donate to 
political parties, in effect banning union, foreign and corporate donations.

Labor backs a ban on foreign donations but opposes a ban on union and 
corporate donations which shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has warned the 
high court has already found is unconstitutional.

The Coalition is now seeking to widen the reform conversation to include 
spending on political campaigns by third-party entities, including unions and 
GetUp.

Malcolm Turnbull says 'ideally' donations should be limited to Australian 
voters

According to a Fairfax media report, Abbott has said: “We need to look long 
and hard at restricting donations to real people on the electoral roll.”

“To that end, there should be no union donations, company donations or foreign 
donations.”

Abbott also suggested that real-time or “near-to-real-time” disclosure was the 
best way to ensure full transparency and prevent “influence buying”.

He stopped short of calling for caps on donations, saying it was “a good 
thing” for individuals to donate to their party of choice – even “substantially 
... as long as there is that transparency”.

On Thursday, Turnbull backed the same position on donations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/malcolm-turnbull-says-ideally-donations-should-be-limited-to-australian-voters>
, which is shared by a number of ministers including Christopher Pyne.

“Ideally, donations to political parties should be limited to people who are 
on the electoral roll – voters,” Turnbull said.

But he noted the reform faced “big legal issues and some constitutional 
issues”.

In 2013 the high court found that a New South Wales law limiting donations to 
individualsbreached the implied freedom of political communication 
<http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2013/hca58-2013-12-18.pdf>
.

On ABC’s 7:30 program on Thursday, Dreyfus said the high court “has said 
absolutely clearly that you can’t, within our constitution, ban corporations 
from making donations or ban unions from making donations”.

He called Turnbull “an absolute hypocrite” for opposing union and corporate 
donations, after reports he madea large personal donation to the Liberal party 
ahead of the 2016 election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/15/malcolm-turnbull-reportedly-gave-1m-to-liberal-party-for-election-ads>
, which Turnbull has never denied.

“Apparently in his ideal world, only very wealthy individuals like himself 
would be able to give $1 or 2m dollars to their own political party to buy an 
election result,” Dreyfus said.

The shadow attorney general said under current laws donations do not need to 
be disclosed for 18 months. He said Turnbull was “all talk and no action” and 
called on him to sit down with Labor so “we can get somewhere on donations 
reform”.

Dreyfus said Labor wants a ban on foreign donations, lowering the limit for 
disclosure of donations to $1,000 from $13,200 and real-time disclosure. He 
said there should be “no donation splitting”, which allows individuals to give 
donations to separate branches of the same party to avoid disclosure.

Asked whether dual citizens would be excluded by a foreign donations ban, 
Dreyfus said it was a detail that needs to be “ironed out” and they might not 
be excluded, particularly if they are Australian residents.

On Friday Pyne told Nine’s Today program he was also in favour of banning 
union and corporate donations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/sam-dastyari-resignation-coalition-open-to-labor-calls-for-donation-reform>
, so that only individuals could donate to political parties.

“You would have to do something about third party campaigning otherwise the 
unions will get their money together and use it to campaign against theLiberal 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>,” he added.

“It is not as simple as everyone thinks it is and that’s why it has to be done 
sensibly and calmly and put through a proper process.

“You can’t just ban donations from one group and then not expect there could 
be a flow-on effect elsewhere.”

Donations reform will now be considered by the joint standing committee on 
electoral matters.

There is some talk in Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> circles about a Canadian 
provision that restricts campaigns by third-party groups during election 
seasons.

Under electoral law in Canada, third-party activist groups are permitted to 
spend what they like on advertising before the start of an election campaign 
but, once the writs are issued, spending is capped, which works to limit the 
influence of these groups.


New South Wales electoral law still contains a similar provision restricting 
spending on electoral communication 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/efeada1981443/s95f.html> 
during state election campaigns to $1.05m for registered third-party campaigns. 
Parties are allowed to spend $100,000 multiplied by the number of electoral 
districts they are contesting.
