The New South Wales Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> has said that no 
decision on preferences for the upcoming federal election has been made, 
leaving open the option to preference the Greens in key Sydney marginal seats.

According to reports, Victorian Liberal party director Michael Kroger is 
considering 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/labor-liberals-greens-asylum-policy>
 a deal in which the Liberals will preference the Greens in the seats ofBatman 
<http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/batman.htm> and Wills 
<http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/wills.htm> in return for the Greens not 
preferencing the ALP in a clutch of outer-suburban marginal seats, a move that 
would give the Liberals a stronger chance of winning them.

On Wednesday, Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tanya-plibersek>, said the 
Victorian deal had spilled over into NSW and “it seems the Liberals will be 
preferencing the Greens” in Anthony Albanese’s seat of Grayndler and her seat 
of Sydney.

Asked to rule out a deal to preference the Greens in those seats, a 
spokeswoman for the NSW Liberals referred Guardian Australia to federal 
director Tony Nutt’s statement that “no decisions have been made regarding 
preferences”.

“During elections, various parties have discussions,” he said.

“This is standard process and speculation that any particular party, group or 
individual has some deal, arrangement or understanding is false.”

A decision on preferences will be made after nominations close and “obviously 
self-interested positioning by our political opponents” would not influence the 
process, Nutt said.

The Greens candidate for Grayndler, Jim Casey, told Guardian Australia: “I 
have absolutely no idea what the Liberals are going to do ... if they choose to 
preference the Greens, that’s up to them.”

“Until local [Greens] groups have met and made their decisions, I can’t know 
how their preferences will be arranged except that the Greens won’t preference 
the Liberals,” he said.

Electoral analyst and Guardian Australia election blogger, Ben Raue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-raue>, said: “Liberal preferences are 
crucial to the Greens winning in Grayndler and Sydney, but they’re not enough.

“They would also need to overtake the Liberal party, who came second in 2013, 
and would still need a swing towards them and away from Labor to win, even with 
Liberal preferences.”

Raue said: “When the Liberal party preferenced the Greens over Labor in 2010, 
the Greens received 74-81% of Liberal preferences.

“This dropped to 28-34% of Liberal preferences in 2013, when the Liberal party 
favoured Labor.”

Returning preference flows from the Liberals to the levels the Greens enjoyed 
in 2010 may be the difference between the Greens candidates ousting Labor and 
not.

Raue said, unlike Sydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> 
and Grayndler, the Greens are already ahead of the Liberal party in Batman and 
Wills.

“The margins in those seats are 10.6% and 15.2%, but if the Liberal party 
reverses its preference decision, the Labor margin in Wills would be cut to 
4.4%, and in Batman the race would start out as a tie.”

On Wednesday, the Murdoch tabloid the Daily Telegraph intervened in the 
Grayndler contest by urging its readers to “Save Our Albo”.

Casey, who is the secretary of the NSW Fire Brigade Employees’ Union, made 
light of the endorsement by posing with the newspaper:

At a campaign stop in the western Sydney marginal seat of Greenway 
<http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/greenway.htm>, Albanese talked up the risk 
of a deal which would see Liberal preferences go to the Greens.

“The Greens, at this election, are seeking to do arrangements with the 
Liberals in electorates such as mine, and in return offering to issue open 
tickets that will increase chances of Turnbull government being re-elected,” he 
said.

Albanese criticised the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, for spending the 
first day of the campaign in his seat.

“During this campaign I’ll be out trying to defeat the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, while the Greens are 
trying to defeat me,” he said.

“It is disappointing that the Greens, who say they want a progressive 
Australia, are targeting progressives not conservative in this election.”
