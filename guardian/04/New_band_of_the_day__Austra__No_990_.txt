Hometown: Toronto.

The lineup: Katie Stelmanis (vocals), Maya Postepski (drums, programming), 
Dorian Wolf (bass).

The background: Apologies for giving the game away at the start, but if you've 
been impressed of late by the goth-tinged electronica and strident vocals of 
Zola Jesus, the Knife andNiki and the Dove 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/new-band-niki-dove>, then you'll 
probably want to investigate Austra. They're a three-piece from Canada but 
mainly a vehicle for the fevered imagination of Katie Stelmanis, a classically 
trained musician with a tendency to use her mainly electronic compositions for 
neo-operatic flights of vocal fancy.

She is also, if not exactly militant, then certainly outspoken about her 
sexuality and what it means in the context of her band, at least two of whom - 
she and drummer/programmer Maya Postepski - are gay. "I am a musician first, 
and a lesbian second," she proclaims, adding, "[but] being gay is a huge part 
of who I am and definitely affects the music I make. I'd like to be recognised 
as someone who makes interesting, experimental music and also identifies as 
queer."

She cites the likes of the Gossip and the xx as examples of contemporary 
musicians who are out and proud, and "redefine what it means to be a queer 
musician, because they are completely true to themselves and their art and 
aren't afraid to be vocal about their sexuality".

"Vocal" is a relative term here: the xx were reluctant to discuss their 
private lives <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/10/the-xx-interview> 
in a Guardian interview last year, whereas Austra have a song called Young and 
Gay. Meanwhile, the video to their latest single, Beat and the Pulse, is an 
examination of female erotica; mystifyingly, given that you can seethis Tyler 
the Creator video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b98qCmhKy-c>, it was censored 
by YouTube, with only a "clean version" available to watch everywhere apart from
here <http://www.dailymotion.com/video/k7LR659o1ANG2Q1ViH8>.

It's not exactly essential to an enjoyment or even an understanding of 
Austra's music to know about Stelmanis's proclivities. Nor does her CV shed 
much light on her music, although it certainly makes for impressive reading. 
She joined the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus aged 10; she learned viola and 
piano and studied opera privately for four years before jacking it all in a 
week before starting college because she didn't want to live in Montreal. Not a 
good advert for Canada's second city.

Still, academia's loss was goth-tinged baroque synthpop's gain as Stelmanis 
sought to create music that would present her as a sort of brooding, electronic 
Polly Harvey. Austra's album, Feel It Break, mixed by Damian Taylor (Bj√∂rk, the 
Prodigy, Unkle), doesn't cover any new ground if you're familiar with the work 
of Bat for Lashes, the Knife, even Florence. Nevertheless, if you have a 
penchant for gently pummelling keyboards with some of the sleazy flavour of 
early Soft Cell, vocals that are ethereal yet powerful - if a little heavy on 
the plummy hauteur - and lyrics that allude to all manner of dark forces and 
questionable rituals, then this is your lucky ... Break.

The buzz: 
<http://www.thestarkonline.com/2011/02/new-release-austra-feel-it-break.html> 
"They channel the creepy instrumental elements of the Knife, and pair them with 
Stelmanis' distorted but classically trained and crystalline vocals."

The truth: She's Domino's great new dark temptress. Apart from Anna Calvi.

Most likely to: Indulge in some non-stop ecstatic dancing.

Least likely to: Indulge in some non-stop erotic cabaret.

What to buy: Debut album Feel It Break will be released by Domino on 16 May.

File next to: Niki and the Dove, Zola Jesus, Fever Ray, Claudia Brucken.
