That was a disappointing second half from Tottenham who could never return to 
the level they found in the opening 10 minutes. Their passing was sloppy and 
they were exposed down the flankers. Harry Kane’s introduction helped but he 
missed a very good chance at a crucial period at 1-1. Same old, same old....

Anderlecht meanwhile, will be delighted. Okaka, formerly of Fulham apparently, 
was excellent, as was Acheampong when he came off the bench to set up the 
winning goal.

Monaco’s 1-0 win over Carrier Bag means they go top with five points, Spurs 
are in second on four but so areAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> who are due at White Hart 
Lane next. Who loves Thursdays?

Cheerio and many thanks for your emails and Tweets. Stayed tuned for Jurgen 
Klopp’s first game in charge at Anfield. He’s picked Joe Allen!

Bye!

Goal! Anderlecht 2-1 Tottenham (Okaka)

74 mins: Tottenham probe again. Eriksen and Lamela both have a go but Okaka 
has won it and he’s charging though. Defour has it, back to Acheampong down the 
left who rolls it across the face of goal for Okaka to bundle in. A very 
well-worked goal.

69 mins: Spurs come again, this time through Townsend, who reaches the by line

68 mins: Vertonghen brings the ball out of defence and Davies weights a 
delightful ball through for Kane, who holds off Mbodji. Proto refuses to come

67 mins: That looked a lovely outside-of-the-foot ball over the top for Okaka 
but Spurs held their line well. Lamela did not hold the ball well however and 
Dier is forced to make an unfair challenge.

64 mins: Spurs lose it cheaply again and in the end Lloris has to come and 
punch. It’s given Spurs a chance to break through Townsend, who feeds Dembele 
and then the onrushing Eriksen but Gillet makes an excellent block. Alli on for 
Dembele.

61 mins: Yet again Tottenham cannot clear a corner and Mbodji heads goalwards. 
Not enough on it though and Lloris gathers.

from the edge of the area. It’s wide but it will concern Spurs.

That was a disappointing second half from Tottenham who could never return to 
the level they found in the opening 10 minutes. Their passing was sloppy and 
they were exposed down the flankers. Harry Kane’s introduction helped but he 
missed a very good chance at a crucial period at 1-1. Same old, same old....

Anderlecht meanwhile, will be delighted. Okaka, formerly of Fulham apparently, 
was excellent, as was Acheampong when he came off the bench to set up the 
winning goal.

Monaco’s 1-0 win over Carrier Bag means they go top with five points, Spurs 
are in second on four but so areAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> who are due at White Hart 
Lane next. Who loves Thursdays?

Cheerio and many thanks for your emails and Tweets. Stayed tuned for Jurgen 
Klopp’s first game in charge at Anfield. He’s picked Joe Allen!

Bye!

90+2 mins: Conte, with his first touch, screws wide after Acheampong AGAIN 
gets down the left and pulls back.
 
90+1 mins: Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> are 
running the clock down with another substitution but you doubt whether 
Tottenham would threaten if they didn’t.
 
90 mins: Can Tottenham capitalise on that let-off? Nope. Trippier has a go 
from range but there’s not enough swerve on it. Into injury time now.
 
89 mins: Trippier brings down the new man Sylla and Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> are in no hurry. Acheampong 
suddenly finds himself clear down the left, fires another of his low crosses in 
and Lloris makes a superb save to deny Praet.
 
88 mins: Anderlecht are sitting deep now, challenging Tottenham to break them 
down, and they just can’t. Another pass goes awry. Goal kick toAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>.
 
87 mins: Better from Tottenham has Dier finds Davies on the right but the 
Welshman can’t beat Gillet with his cross. Okaka is now going off to a standing 
ovation.
 
86 mins: Lamela just played a reverse pass to no one, Kane picked it up in the 
centre circle and Alli back-heeled to no one - Spurs have gone to pot.

85 mins: Sharp work from Alli, who thinks he has a shout for a penalty. He 
doesn’t. But Tottenham have it at the back again.
 
84 mins: That’s a horrible foul from Lamela. A bit of petulance there. Defour 
wasted the free-kick, straight into the arms of Lloris who fires the ball out 
to Kane.
 
82 mins: Praet fires over after good work from Defour. Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> scenting another goal to put 
this one to bed.
 
81 mins: Acheampong yet again gets down the left and pulls it back but Okaka 
fluffes his lines. Then, at the other end Alli slips Kane through who is 
offside and off target.
 
80 mins: Townsend hooked for 18-year-old Onomah. What a time to make a name 
for yourself?!?!?
 
79 mins: Another Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> 
corner and again Tottenham can’t clear. Dendoncker head just over - Clive would 
have scored.
 
77 mins: Acheampong has made a huge difference and gets clear down the right, 
almost picks out Defour but it’s another corner.
 
76 mins: He scored than bloomin’ goal with just one boot on would you believe. 
All Clive Allen’s fault for going on about 1-1 draws between these two.
 
74 mins: Tottenham probe again. Eriksen and Lamela both have a go but Okaka 
has won it and he’s charging though. Defour has it, back to Acheampong down the 
left who rolls it across the face of goal for Okaka to bundle in. A very 
well-worked goal.

73 mins: Alli almost picks Dendoncker’s pocket and Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> would have been in trouble 
there. As it was, Acheampong was caught offside.
 
72 mins: That’s calmly done by Alderweireld who had Okaka breathing down his 
neck as he tidied up with a cheeky step-over.
 
71 mins: Eriksen thought he was away there but a bit of hand in face action 
from Lamela on Dendoncker means it’s free-kick forAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>, which eventually ends up 
with Lloris.
 
69 mins: Spurs come again, this time through Townsend, who reaches the by line 
and stands one up to the far post for absolutely no one arriving late.
 Good chance for Harry Kane but his shot is saved by the legs of Proto Silvio.

68 mins: Vertonghen brings the ball out of defence and Davies weights a 
delightful ball through for Kane, who holds off Mbodji. Proto refuses to come 
off his line meaning Kane was in but Proto makes the save with his legs.

67 mins: That looked a lovely outside-of-the-foot ball over the top for Okaka 
but Spurs held their line well. Lamela did not hold the ball well however and 
Dier is forced to make an unfair challenge.
 
66 mins: Alderweireld clears Praet’s cross from the left as Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> replace Ezekiel with 
Acheampong.
 
64 mins: Spurs lose it cheaply again and in the end Lloris has to come and 
punch. It’s given Spurs a chance to break through Townsend, who feeds Dembele 
and then the onrushing Eriksen but Gillet makes an excellent block. Alli on for 
Dembele.

63 mins: Trippier loses it then just as quickly wins it back and it’s 
Tottenham’s turn to prod away. Kane embarks on another run, gets double teamed, 
but nothing doing says the referee.
 
62 mins: Kane wins a free-kick after a strong run, making an immediate impact, 
but Eriksen’s deliver is poor. That was a waste.
 
61 mins: Yet again Tottenham cannot clear a corner and Mbodji heads goalwards. 
Not enough on it though and Lloris gathers.
 
60 mins: Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> are the 
ones knocking it about now and Ezekiel gets free down the left, Dier follows 
him though and gets the block in. Corner.
 
59 mins: I hate to say I told you so but here comes Kane for ... Clinton. A 
shame but that last tackle settled it. Hard to judge him on that performance as 
he clearly isn’t used to playing as a centre-forward.
 
57 mins: Spurs have it but Anderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> supporters sense the momentum 
is with their side. Tielemans tries a snap shot but it drifts wide.
 
56 mins: Vertonghen stays strong there and holds off Okaka, no mean feat, but 
Spurs give it away again. Clinton commits another foul, I wouldn’t be surprised 
to see Kane in the next few minutes.
 
55 mins: Clinton picks up the first yellow of the night after failing to 
gather another sloppy pass. Neither sides have found their passing groove in 
the second half but Spurs have been worse.
 
54 mins: Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> are 
enjoying themselves down the right and this time it’s Ezekiel with the shot 
from the edge of the area. It’s wide but it will concern Spurs.
 
52 mins: Davies loses the ball but Townsend wins it back and feeds Clinton who 
cannot take it on the half-turn. Kane would have loved that kind of service.
 
51 mins: Clinton gets himself turned on the left, cuts in and hammers one, but 
it’s high and wide.Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>

50 mins: Flick on from Okaka sees the ball worked wide to Gillet who runs on
