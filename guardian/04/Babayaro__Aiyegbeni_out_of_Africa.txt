Celestine Babayaro and Yakubu Aiyegbeni have been thrown out of Nigeria's 
African Nations Cup squad for indiscipline.

The Chelsea defender and the Portsmouth striker - who has been hurriedly 
included in his club's squad for today's visit of Wolves - were supposed to be 
preparing at the Monastir base for today's match against South Africa - a 
must-win game for Nigeria after the 1-0 defeat by Morocco.

"They did not respect the rules of the camp. They were supposed to be in 
quarters with the rest of the squad," Taiwo Ogunjobi, general secretary of the 
Nigerian Football Association, said yesterday. "They only returned to the hotel 
this morning.

"We have informed the team through the captain Jay Jay Okocha and have 
received the approval of the sports minister and it was decided that discipline 
must be maintained and the players involved leave the camp immediately." 
Schalke's striker Victor Agali was also dismissed.

Two goals from Mamadou Niang helped Senegal to an impressive 3-0 win over 
Kenya. He opened the scoring from a pass by Liverpool's El Hadji Diouf, 
finishing from a tight angle. Pape Bouba Diop hit the second with a fierce shot 
after a corner and Niang made it three after a one-two with Wolves' Henri 
Camara.

Djibril Ciss√©'s appeal against a five-match international ban was rejected by 
Uefa yesterday, effectively ruling him out of France's defence of the European 
Championship. The Liverpool-bound Auxerre striker was suspended for kicking a 
Portuguese player in an Under-21 game last month. Uefa suspensions apply only 
to official matches, meaning he would be available only for the final.
