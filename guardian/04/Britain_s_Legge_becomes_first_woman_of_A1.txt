Katherine Legge became the first woman to drive an A1 grand prix car 
yesterday. In her first session for the Great Britain team she was 23rd fastest 
after six laps in Dubai as France's Nicolas Lapierre set the pace.

She improved her time in the second test session after clocking up another 11 
laps, claiming the 22nd quickest time. The British team were pleased with her 
performance and stressed lap times were low on their list of priorities.

A spokeswoman said: "Today wasn't about lap times. Katherine needed to bed in 
the brakes and also a new engine. The main thing was we have a female in an A1 
car. The team were very impressed."
