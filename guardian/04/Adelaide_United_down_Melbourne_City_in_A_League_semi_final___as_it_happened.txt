That’s all from me for tonight, thank you for your company.

Sunday’s second semi-final will be covered in a similar way, Richard Parkin 
should be on deck for that barn burner.

Then we’re onto the granny, next Sunday at 4pm AEST, live from Adelaide Oval.

Adelaide United 4-1 Melbourne City

What a night for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. They dominated from the 
off, created chances throughout and in the second half put Melbourne City to 
the sword. Eugene Galekovic has told Fox Sports his team “destroyed” their 
opponents and his bullish opinion is well founded.

City couldn’t handle Adelaide’s pressing to retain or recycle possession often 
enough. The intricacy of United’s front four was too much for the visiting 
defence, especially with the bolting Goodwin to contend with too. Fornaroli can 
rarely have had less of an impact in a match which is testament to the 
performances of McGowan and La Rocca. In every facet of the game from the 
coaching strategies down, Adelaide United proved superior.

Bruce Djite deserves the headlines for his superb opener but, as it has been 
all season for the Reds, it was a team effort that saw them through tonight. In 
this form they will be hard to back against, regardless of their opponents in 
the grand final.

Goal! Adelaide United 4-1 Melbourne City (Sanchez 90+4)

Icing on the cake. Djite turns provider this time and his looped cross from 
the left beats the City defence and Sanchez side-foots through Sorensen’s legs 
to seal a memorable night forAdelaide United

90 min: Put a fork in this, City are done. Clisby has limped off injured so 
they’re down to ten men. Adelaide are rampant and big Bruce is hunting his 
hat-trick.

Mauk, in odd coloured boots (both in their mismatched nature and their oddness 
- pink and yellow) subbed off after a mighty shift.

Goal! Adelaide United 3-1 Melbourne City (McGowan 88)

Game over! Corner from Carrusca and it somehow finds its way to the middle of 
the six yard box where McGowan is on hand to guide it with his instep beyond 
Sorensen. Good finish, poor defending.
 Do you think Dylan McGowan is happy with his goal? Photograph: Morne de

87 min: Lovely passing down Adelaide’s right inside, outside, behind the 
fullback and it takes a last ditch challenge from Clisby to deny Sanchez. 
Clisby hurt himself in that clearance. Cramp? Hammy? Either way it’s a corner 
to Adelaide and a good header from Sanchez almost loops in but Marino heads it 
clear off the line.

85 min: The lively Kamau is replaced by Pablo Sanchez. This contributes to a 
number of stoppages that have taken the sting out of the game, much to the home 
side’s benefit.

83 min: The ball keeps bouncing City’s way in Adelaide territory but they 
can’t fashion clear chances from it. Mooy’s corner finds Malik, who slips, then 
Fitzgerald tries an optimistic punt from range.

The atmosphere is less jubilant now, much more tense, but the home side are 
still in the box seat.

81 min: Both midfields have gone missing and the ball is pinging from one 
forward third to the other.

Important substitutions coming up. Elrich returning for Goodwin and Melling 
coming on for Kisnorbo. That will mean a reshuffle for City, presumably to a 
back three.

Elrich immediately into the fray with a brave far post header to deny 
Fitzgerald a chance. Mooy again instrumental in the build up.

78 min: Mooy is everywhere at the moment. His pass to Formaroli feeds the 
striker into the box but his twists and turns can’t create space. The 50:50s 
falling to City now, the second balls and mishit passes landing their way. Not 
only to cpaitalise on some rare momentum though.

76 min: Belief for City and it shows in Mooy’s gorgeous pass to Marino but the 
youngster can’t beat the first defender with his shot.

Adelaide whiplash down the other end and Goodwin hits a shot as hard as a ball 
can ever conceivably have been hit. It thunders just over the bar though and 
out for a corner.

74 min: A-Grade commentator’s curse there. City with a decent spell of 
possession down their right, the ball finds Fitzgerald with half a yard of 
space on the edge of the box and he makes no mistake. That makes the final 
15-minutes interesting.

71 min: Adelaide just stroking the ball around their manor now, showing off 
their skills. A couple of passes go astray though but City can’t capitalise. 
United’s ability to regroup quickly is a major feature of their success. Such 
energy, commitment and discipline.

70 min: It’s hard not to wonder ‘what if?’ for City. Zullo, Franjic and 
Novillo would all improve this XI. The fullbacks in particular have been weak 
spots.

Mauk the latest into the book, sixth of the match so far.

67 min: Caceres into the book for a desperate challenge on the 
counterattacking Mauk. Delovski, as expected, has had his work cut out tonight. 
He’s got the big decisions right though, no complaints over the penalty.

64 min: The home side are all over the visitors now. Isaias with a sumptuous 
lobbed pass over the advancing defensive line for Kamau but his shot is 
deflected for a corner. This could get ugly for City at a packed and delirious 
Coopers Stadium.

58 min: Clear booking for La Rocca. Classic Fornaroli, waiting for the ball to 
feet with his back to goal, rolls the defender and the shirt-grab has the Red 
seeing yellow. Nothing comes of the free-kick though.

City look a bit bereft of ideas going forward. They certainly miss Novillo’s 
power and unpredictability.

55 min: It’s worth repeating that Marc Marino is the only attacking option on 
City’s bench. Not much wriggle room for Van’t Schip.

Good deep corner from Mooy beats Galekovic but Malik can’t force it home at 
the far post. Another good corner finds Malik but he’s unprepared and the 
ball’s cleared. Can City keep up this pressure?

Fornaroli’s head but it runs behind for a goal kick.

50 min: Quality finish from the big man. Power and precision with the inside 
of his right foot. One of those using the momentum of the ball coming into him 
to aim beyond the far post and watch it drift in late.

Now, what can City muster against the stingiest defence in the league?

Almost something immediately as a teasing Mooy free-kick just evades the 
outstretched boot of Kisnorbo.

Goal! Adelaide United 1-0 Melbourne City (Djite 48)

48 min: It took just three minutes of the second half for Adelaide to score 
the goal they so richly deserved. And it’s a beauty from Bruce Djite, curling 
the ball home from the edge of the box beyond Sorensen’s dive.

Peeeeeeepppp!

Second half underway and it almost starts with an audacious goal from 
Fornaroli. Adelaide fail to deal with a long ball, Galekovic is off his line 
but the Uruguayan’s instinctive finish rebounds off a defender.

Half-time: Adelaide United 0-0 Melbourne City

That’s the first 45 minutes taken care of. Somehow Melbourne City reach the 
interval without conceding a goal.Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united> dominated the half and 
missed a string of good chances.

It’s been a terrific, frenetic game so far, what will happen in the second 
half?

45 min + 2: Poor couple of phases by Mooy. First his corner from the left 
fails to clear the first defender, then he’s caught offside as the second ball 
heads his way. Two minutes of added time at the end of the half.

45 min: Ooooh! Djite wallops a left-footer from miles out and it only just 
misses the left-hand post. Sorensen was all over it but when you see a shot fly 
so fast around knee-high it sets the heart racing.

City just running the clock down a little as half time approaches.

That’s all from me for tonight, thank you for your company.

Sunday’s second semi-final will be covered in a similar way, Richard Parkin 
should be on deck for that barn burner.

Then we’re onto the granny, next Sunday at 4pm AEST, live from Adelaide Oval. 
 
What a night for Adelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>. They dominated from the 
off, created chances throughout and in the second half put Melbourne City to 
the sword. Eugene Galekovic has told Fox Sports his team “destroyed” their 
opponents and his bullish opinion is well founded.

City couldn’t handle Adelaide’s pressing to retain or recycle possession often 
enough. The intricacy of United’s front four was too much for the visiting 
defence, especially with the bolting Goodwin to contend with too. Fornaroli can 
rarely have had less of an impact in a match which is testament to the 
performances of McGowan and La Rocca. In every facet of the game from the 
coaching strategies down, Adelaide United proved superior.

Bruce Djite deserves the headlines for his superb opener but, as it has been 
all season for the Reds, it was a team effort that saw them through tonight. In 
this form they will be hard to back against, regardless of their opponents in 
the grand final.

Icing on the cake. Djite turns provider this time and his looped cross from 
the left beats the City defence and Sanchez side-foots through Sorensen’s legs 
to seal a memorable night forAdelaide United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>.
 
90+2 min: Elsey the incoming sub, I should point out. 

So, we now know next week’s grand final will be in Adelaide, we just don’t 
know who United will be facing.
 
90 min: Put a fork in this, City are done. Clisby has limped off injured so 
they’re down to ten men. Adelaide are rampant and big Bruce is hunting his 
hat-trick.

Mauk, in odd coloured boots (both in their mismatched nature and their oddness

Game over! Corner from Carrusca and it somehow finds its way to the middle of 
the six yard box where McGowan is on hand to guide it with his instep beyond 
Sorensen. Good finish, poor defending.

Klerk/Getty Images  
87 min: Lovely passing down Adelaide’s right inside, outside, behind the 
fullback and it takes a last ditch challenge from Clisby to deny Sanchez. 
Clisby hurt himself in that clearance. Cramp? Hammy? Either way it’s a corner 
to Adelaide and a good header from Sanchez almost loops in but Marino heads it 
clear off the line.
 
85 min: The lively Kamau is replaced by Pablo Sanchez. This contributes to a 
number of stoppages that have taken the sting out of the game, much to the home 
side’s benefit.
 
83 min: The ball keeps bouncing City’s way in Adelaide territory but they 
can’t fashion clear chances from it. Mooy’s corner finds Malik, who slips, then 
Fitzgerald tries an optimistic punt from range.

The atmosphere is less jubilant now, much more tense, but the home side are 
still in the box seat.
 
81 min: Both midfields have gone missing and the ball is pinging from one 
forward third to the other.

Important substitutions coming up. Elrich returning for Goodwin and Melling 
coming on for Kisnorbo. That will mean a reshuffle for City, presumably to a 
back three.

Elrich immediately into the fray with a brave far post header to deny 
Fitzgerald a chance. Mooy again instrumental in the build up.
 
78 min: Mooy is everywhere at the moment. His pass to Formaroli feeds the 
striker into the box but his twists and turns can’t create space. The 50:50s 
falling to City now, the second balls and mishit passes landing their way. Not 
only to cpaitalise on some rare momentum though.
 
76 min: Belief for City and it shows in Mooy’s gorgeous pass to Marino but the 
youngster can’t beat the first defender with his shot.

Adelaide whiplash down the other end and Goodwin hits a shot as hard as a ball 
can ever conceivably have been hit. It thunders just over the bar though and 
out for a corner.
 
74 min: A-Grade commentator’s curse there. City with a decent spell of 
possession down their right, the ball finds Fitzgerald with half a yard of 
space on the edge of the box and he makes no mistake. That makes the final 
15-minutes interesting.

Hang on a minute! Fitzgerald grabs one back for City with a lovely stroked 
finish into the corner of Galekovic’s net.

71 min: Adelaide just stroking the ball around their manor now, showing off 
their skills. A couple of passes go astray though but City can’t capitalise. 
United’s ability to regroup quickly is a major feature of their success. Such 
energy, commitment and discipline.
 
70 min: It’s hard not to wonder ‘what if?’ for City. Zullo, Franjic and 
Novillo would all improve this XI. The fullbacks in particular have been weak 
spots.

Mauk the latest into the book, sixth of the match so far.
 
67 min: Caceres into the book for a desperate challenge on the 
counterattacking Mauk. Delovski, as expected, has had his work cut out tonight. 
He’s got the big decisions right though, no complaints over the penalty.
 
64 min: The home side are all over the visitors now. Isaias with a sumptuous 
lobbed pass over the advancing defensive line for Kamau but his shot is 
deflected for a corner. This could get ugly for City at a packed and delirious 
Coopers Stadium.
 
62 min: It would take something miraculous for City to pull this one back now. 
Van’t Schip is rolling the dice, Retre off for Connor Chapman and Garuccio 
replaced by Marino.
 
60 min: Djite sends Sorensen the wrong way from the spot and it’s clear air for
Adelaide United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/adelaide-united>.

59 min: Quick free-kick to Kamau on the right hand side of the box and he has 
his legs taken from under him by Clisby.
 
58 min: Clear booking for La Rocca. Classic Fornaroli, waiting for the ball to 
feet with his back to goal, rolls the defender and the shirt-grab has the Red 
seeing yellow. Nothing comes of the free-kick though.

City look a bit bereft of ideas going forward. They certainly miss Novillo’s 
power and unpredictability.
 
55 min: It’s worth repeating that Marc Marino is the only attacking option on 
City’s bench. Not much wriggle room for Van’t Schip.

Good deep corner from Mooy beats Galekovic but Malik can’t force it home at 
the far post. Another good corner finds Malik but he’s unprepared and the 
ball’s cleared. Can City keep up this pressure?
 
53 min: City pressing. Mooy taking the game on like Steph Curry with bodies 
bouncing off him in Adelaide’s half. Fitzgerald whips in a cross that reaches 
Fornaroli’s head but it runs behind for a goal kick.
 
50 min: Quality finish from the big man. Power and precision with the inside 
of his right foot. One of those using the momentum of the ball coming into him 
to aim beyond the far post and watch it drift in late.

Now, what can City muster against the stingiest defence in the league?

Almost something immediately as a teasing Mooy free-kick just evades the 
outstretched boot of Kisnorbo.

Second half underway and it almost starts with an audacious goal from 
Fornaroli. Adelaide fail to deal with a long ball, Galekovic is off his line 
but the Uruguayan’s instinctive finish rebounds off a defender.

45 min + 2: Poor couple of phases by Mooy. First his corner from the left 
fails to clear the first defender, then he’s caught offside as the second ball 
heads his way. Two minutes of added time at the end of the half.
 
45 min: Ooooh! Djite wallops a left-footer from miles out and it only just 
misses the left-hand post. Sorensen was all over it but when you see a shot fly 
so fast around knee-high it sets the heart racing.

City just running the clock down a little as half time approaches.
