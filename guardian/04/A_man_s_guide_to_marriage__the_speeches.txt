Ladies, gentlemen, comrades ...

Unaccustomed as I am to speaking to a room full of people who are actually 
listening to me, I'd like to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts on 
wedding speeches.

As this is a blokes' guide to weddings, I'm going to talk about the father of 
the bride, the groom and the best man. As this is a Guardian column, I fully 
expect some heckling about how it shouldn't just be men who give speeches at 
weddings. Of course brides, their mothers, chief bridesmaids and best women 
should give speeches if they want to. It is just that my advice is primarily 
aimed at blokes. Indeed, at a speechwriter's wedding I attended a couple of 
years ago, the groom admitted that he'd been upstaged by his new wife's 
brilliant speech.

My top speech tip is to remember to leave a gap between each sentence just in 
case there is laughter. It's annoying to get a laugh only for the audience to 
miss the next part of your speech.

Now I'm going to hand you over to some good advice shared on this wedding 
series <http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/series/mans-guide-to-marriage> 
over the last few weeks.

Father of the bride

Heartfelt and affectionate seem to be the winners. Potty training and 
embarrassment are (mostly) losers.

sumaire <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/sumaire/comments>: In the speech my 
dad gave at my sister's wedding, he made the customary joke about speaking for 
hours then only spoke for maybe five minutes. During that time he gave us one 
or two anecdotes about my sister growing up (no potty training or 18/30 frights 
involved) before he explained how much he loved and admired her - he said that 
she had never done anything to make him less than proud. It was wonderful to 
hear him say in front of all our family and friends.

However â€¦

minileon <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/minileon/comments>: "My dad talked 
about my conception, which was not excruciating for me, as it's a bloody funny 
story (he had the good sense to leave out detail), everyone laughed, a lot, he 
was touching, interesting, clever, funny, he had everyone singing, and he shed 
some very rare tears. He was brilliant. Because he's my dad."

Don't go on for hours: short and sweet is often best.

babytiger <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/babytiger>: "My father-in-law gave 
the first speech at our wedding. We were a bit nervous about it, as he's quite 
forthright in his views and isn't usually backward about sharing them - but he 
shamed us all with a beautiful, moving speech which knocked all the others into 
a cocked hat. It lasted about 45 seconds."

Groom

You are guaranteed a cheer for your first "My wife and I". Anything remotely 
funny will get a laugh because you are in a room full of people who love you. 
They are all there for your big day. Remember to say lots of thank yous, and 
something nice about your new life partner.

: "I did write some notes but in my own terrible handwriting, and was doing a 
joint speech with my wife who spent the whole time trying to decipher it over 
the mic. Not to be recommended."

gelert <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/gelert/comments>: "One groom whose 
wedding I attended somewhat unwisely decided to make his speech a rather 
cerebral contemplation on the nature of love and whether one could ever tell if 
one was really in love. The marriage didn't last."

paulheadon <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/paulheadon/comments>: "One of the 
points at our wedding that worked really well (at least for me and two others) 
was to do our speeches before the meal - that way the best man, bride's dad and 
groom can all enjoy the meal and have a few drinks, instead of bricking it all 
the way through and getting hissed at by their respective wives for drinking 
too much before making the speech. Get the speeches out of the way, relax and 
enjoy the rest of the night."

But the groom doesn't have to be funny because of the ...

Unfortunately, all the pressure is on you. All people will have been saying to 
you all day is, "Are you nervous?" and, "Hope it's a good speech." Nobody will 
say: "Well done for remembering the rings."

Anecdotes are good. But not ones about the stag, former girlfriends, or pretty 
much anything to do with sex.

If you can, try to learn the stories off by heart, as if you have been telling 
them all your life, so you don't constantly need to check your notes. If you've 
known the groom all your life then this should be easy. My best man had 
obviously told the story about my cricket hat many, many times. Even though It. 
Isn't. True. It got a big laugh, though.

Over the course of their engagements, I quizzed my grooms (that I hadn't known 
since childhood) about their younger years. It's amazing what you can learn on 
the QT and you get a laugh from the older rellies as well as the younger guests.

benulek <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/benulek/comments>: "If you're not 
naturally funny, no amount of trying will compensate. Whatever you do, don't 
use one of those bloody cookie-cutter speeches where you simply fill in the 
names. Belly laughs are immediate, but sincerity is what really gets 
remembered. One of the finest best man speeches I ever heard barely contained a 
laugh, but was full of genuine sentiment and emotion, and you could feel the 
tension lift in the room as everyone realised they weren't going to have to 
force a laugh at weak and badly delivered jokes. Most important of all, tell 
the groom what he means to you and what an honour it is to be chosen as his 
best man. Even if these aren't things you're accustomed to saying, it'll mean 
the world to him."

crosby99 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/crosby99>: "The best man must thank 
the appropriate people (parents, ushers, bridesmaids, etc). It leaves a bad 
taste in the mouths of the oldies if this is forgotten."

ragworm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/ragworm/comments>: "I was dreading 
the speech but, for once, I was semi-inspired. I organised a slideshow 
consisting of old photos with bits of old film footage and background music. I 
gave a brief introductory speech and did a talk over. It worked a treat, in 
fact it's an idiot-proof way of triumphing, I so recommend it.

gotet <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/gotet/comments>: Write the speech in 
rhyme/limericks. Works very well - there are even websites which will give you 
a rhyme for something. And it allows you to keep it short and simple.

gelert <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/gelert/comments>: Don't forget the 
bride. Tell the bride she looks lovely, as do the bridesmaids, [they may] have 
been forced to wear magenta - they'll thank you for it. Then with the help of 
the chief bridesmaid, you can reveal a few of her well-kept secrets. Bearing in 
mind of course that her mum and dad will be there and revelations suitable for 
a groom might not sit well with her family and friends.

intotheblue <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/intotheblue/comments>: "Do not 
say anything which can be remotely construed as 'dissing' the bride. I 
witnessed a best man's speech which contained not only a 'blonde' comment about 
the bride but an ill-advised reference to the happy couple having on one 
occasion left a used condom at the best man's house, both of which produced 
deathly 'tumbleweed moments' and ensured that the speech was completed in an 
atmosphere of unimaginable iciness. Use your common sense."

SaptarshiRay <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/saptarshiray/comments>: "I think 
it's very true what people say about best man's speeches: the good ones blend 
into one another but you remember the bad ones vividly. In my experience I've 
only seen a couple of car crashes, but it generally seems to be people who go 
either too serious or too wacky. They think of it as a lecture or performance 
rather than a speech."

bennnnnnnn <http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/bennnnnnnn/comments>: "We've been 
to plenty of weddings with more than one best man, all of which worked very 
nicely, except the one with four best men. It was interminable, as they all 
seemed to want to fulfil every duty, rather than divvying them up. The speeches 
lasted over two hours."

From speech to song

Personally, I like to use a prop or two. As all my (three) grooms had longer 
hair when they were younger, they all got to wear wigs while I did their 
speeches. And I like to finish with a song - a song that the guests can join in 
with. So the Geordie got theBlaydon Races 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaydon_Races> and the groom who emigrated to 
Australia gotWaltzing Matilda <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltzing_Matilda>.

As a return tribute, my ushers performed a song, employing Bob Dylan 
Subterranean Homesick Blues-style cards 
<http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6392396693800156397#>. At the risk of 
being self-indulgent, here is what they sang, to the tune ofThat's Entertainment

A lump of cheese and a doorstep sandwich
Painted toenails and a five quid haircut,
Big fat belly, year round suntan
Loves his Mum even more than his sofa

That's Steven Busfield

A donkey jacket and those ancient boots
An England shirt and a ripped old jumper
Yorkshire pudding and roast beef on Sundays
Listening to Robbie and supporting the Vale

That's Steven Busfield

La la la, La la la

Days in Leeds spent watching Yorkshire
Hissing down with rain at boring Headingley
Keeping score and eating melon medley
No-one there except him and his Ma

Endless emails and taramasalata
Watching the telly and wishing you were Darren Gough
