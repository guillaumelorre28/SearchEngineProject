In the end, the collective sigh of relief heaved in European capitals

 on Sunday afternoon at the far-right’s defeat in Austria barely lasted the 
evening.

Despite the joy with which the result was greeted by anti-establishment 
populists, however, it would be wrong to see Matteo Renzi’strouncing in Italy’s 
constitutional referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/matteo-renzi-due-to-formally-submit-resignation-as-italy-ponders-what-next>
 as one more Eurosceptic nail in Europe’s coffin. At least, not just yet.

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/year-of-electoral-tests-may-end-european-union-as-we-know-it>
 in France, Germany and the Netherlands, the EU watched warily this weekend as 
two potentially crunch votes for its future unfolded.

A presidential election in Austria could have resulted in the first freely 
elected,far-right head of state in western Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/far-right-party-concedes-defeat-in-austrian-presidential-election>
 since the second world war, but did not.

Contrary to most polls, Alexander Van der Bellen, the pro-European independent 
candidate backed by the Greens, comfortably saw off Norbert Hofer from the 
far-right, anti-immigration Freedom party.

François Hollande, France’s embattled president, hailed the result as “a vote 
for European unity and tolerance”. Martin Schulz, the president of the European 
parliament, said Van der Bellen’s victory was “a defeat for nationalism and 
anti-European, backward-looking populism”. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Sigmar 
Gabriel, said: “A load has been taken off the mind of allEurope

Van der Bellen: Austria vote a signal of hope

But less than eight hours later, Renzi, the Italian prime minister, had 
announced his resignation aftercrashing to a 59%-41% defeat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum>
 in an unnecessary plebiscite on which he staked his political future,heralding 
a period of uncertainty for Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/what-happens-now-after-matteo-renzis-referendum-defeat>
, its ailing banks and the eurozone.

With opposition to the referendum led by the populist

 Five Star Movement (M5S) and Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigration Northern

jump on the result as evidence that theanti-establishment tide rising across

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national>
 of the French presidential election, said Italy’s voters had disowned the EU.

“After the Greek referendum, after Brexit, this Italian no adds a new people 
to the list of those who would like to turn their backs on absurd European 
policies that are plunging the continent into poverty,” she said.

 The Ukip MEP Roger Helmer even hinted at the imminent demise of the EU:
Roger Helmer (@RogerHelmerMEP) 
Let's be clear: Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> has voted 
against the EU. Soon, there may no longer be an EU from which to Brexit.

In truth, there is little to show that the result was anti-European: this was 
not Italy’s Brexit moment. Some voters, including establishment figures such as 
the former prime ministers Mario Monti and Massimo D’Alema, objected to Renzi’s 
proposed reforms.

Others disliked the prime minister and his government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/referendum-win-may-lead-nowhere-for-five-star-and-northern-league>
. Many were registering their protest at aneconomy that has averaged one year 
of growth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/italy-referendum-q-and-a-economic-questions-answered>
 over the past five decades.

It is by no means clear that if snap elections were called, which is no 
certainty, a majority of no voters on Sunday would cast their ballot for M5S or 
the Northern League, both of which are critical of the EU and have said they 
would back a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.

Leading EU figures stressed they did not see the Italian vote as a victory for 
anti-European forces, or analogous to Brexit. Angela Merkel, the German 
chancellor, said she was sad the vote had not gone Renzi’s way, “but it is of 
course a domestic Italian decision that we must respect.”

Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, warned 
against turning the Italian result into a psychodrama, insisting it was not an 
anti-EU vote.

“The populists in Europe are always trying to run any vote into a pro-EU or 
anti-EU vote. They are wrong and they will lose,” Moscovici said, adding that 
Hofer’s defeat showed there was nothing inevitable about the rise of the far 
right in Europe.

France’s finance minister, Michel Sapin, said the referendum was “wasn’t about 
Europe”. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said the result 
changed little, even for Italy’s troubled banks. “The problems we have today 
are the problems we had yesterday and they still have to be dealt with. That 
process will continue,” he said.

Markets, similarly, reacted with relative equanimity. Traders had largely 
anticipated Renzi’s defeat and priced in the result. An initialfall in the 
value of the euro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/pound-gains-dollar-euro-fears-italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-brexit>
 on Sunday night was due mainly to surprise at the scale of the defeat, and the 
currencyquickly recovered its losses on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live>
.

Many analysts were sanguine, too, pointing out that Italy will soon welcome 
its 65th government since the second world war and a majority of Italians cast 
their votes for the status quo and against change. It was Renzi, not his 
opponents, who wanted to reform the system.

Italy’s far-right Northern League: referendum sends warning to EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/dec/05/italys-far-right-northern-league-referendum-sends-warning-to-eu-video>
Luigi Scazzieri of the Centre for European Reform predicted that Italy’s next 
government would be made up “of the same political majority currently 
supporting Renzi, with the possible addition of Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza 
Italia party”.

A takeover by M5S is “unlikely either now or in the next election”, Scazzieri 
said, not least because planned electoral reforms will produce a form of 
proportional representation that will make it extremely difficult for any 
single party to form a government. “Italy is unlikely to be the domino that 
leads to more instability in Europe,” he said.

But coming on the day that 46% of Austrian voters voted for the candidate of a 
party founded by a former SS officer, the Italian referendum result further 
destabilises the EU at the most inopportune moment and underlines the real 
threat to Europe’s mainstream leaders from the populist revolt.

Christian Lindner of Germany’s opposition pro-business Free Democrats said the 
eurozone faced “turbulence ahead” and warned the German government not to give 
in to demands for debt relief from Italy.

The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was probably being 
diplomatic when he insisted the referendum result was “not the end of the 
world” and he had “full confidence in the Italian authorities to manage this 
situation”.

He may have been rather more truthful when he added that Germany was watching 
developments in Italy “with concern” and Sunday’s events were perhaps “not a 
positive development in the case of the general crisis in Europe”.
