A Russian court has sentenced two men to life in prison for the murder of 
journalistAnna Politkovskaya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya>, and handed lengthy 
prison terms to three others involved in the killing.

Rustam Makhmudov, a Chechen convicted of firing the fatal shots, and his uncle 
Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, found guilty of organising the hit, were jailed for life at 
Moscow city court.

Makhmudov's two brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, were sentenced to 14 and 12 
years respectively in a penal colony, while former Moscow police officer Sergei 
Khadzhikurbanov was handed a 20-year term.

The shooting of Politkovskaya, a prominent reporter at liberal newspaper 
Novaya Gazeta and a fierce critic of the Kremlin's tactics in Chechnya, on 7 
October 2006, shocked the world. Eight years on, investigators have yet to 
identify the person who ordered the apparent contract killing.

Politkovskaya's family have said they were disappointed that the trial had not 
come any closer to tracking down the mastermind behind the murder.

A spokesman for Russia's investigative committee, which conducted the 
investigation, pledged that it would continue its attempts to bring those 
behind the killing to justice.

"At the current time comprehensive measures are being taken to identify the 
person who ordered the murder," spokesman Vladimir Markin told the Interfax 
news agency.

Rights activists also insisted the case was still far from closed. Lyudmila 
Alexeyeva from the Moscow Helsinki group told Interfax: "There is one 
fundamental question: who ordered it? Until that is resolved the case has to 
remain open."
