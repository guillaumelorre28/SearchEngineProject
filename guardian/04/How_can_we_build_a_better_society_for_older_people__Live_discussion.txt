Society is failing to value and harness older people’s skills, knowledge and 
experience, a Guardian survey has revealed. Some 92% of the 1,250 respondents 
to theageing population research 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/04/ageing-population-survey-old-people-burden-skills-strengths-ignored>
 believe that older adults’ contribution to society is not recognised.


One said: “On the whole the public view older people as a drain on society 
instead of an asset.” Another added: “Older people are mostly seen as a bundle 
of problems and service-needs. Their strengths, skills and knowledge are not 
harnessed or appreciated in a society infatuated by the cult of youth.”

In fact, older people in the UK contribute an estimated £61bn to the economy  
<http://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/archive/61-billion-the-economic-contribution-of-people-aged-65-plus/>
through employment, volunteering and caring. And, according to Ros Altmann, the 
UK government’s champion for older workers, being 50, 60 or 70 in the 21st 
century is no longer a predictor of physical or mental abilities. It certainly 
does not signify that someone has failing health and will soon be unfit to 
work, or no longer able to learn new skills.

Meanwhile, with numbers of people aged 75 and over expected to double by 2040 
and the proportion of older people in the UK due to rise from 23% to 28% of the 
population by 2030, it is vital to plan for the necessary services to support 
our ageing society.

How can we create a society where people aren’t so worried about getting old, 
where there’s less stereotyping of older people, more inter-generational 
contact, and more opportunities to see older people as assets? What are the 
issues around financing retirement and how do we make sure older adults are not 
excluded because they don’t have enough money?


We will be discussing these questions and more on Wednesday 25 March from noon 
till 2pm.

Older people <https://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people> have different 
expectations these days, and that will continue to change. What might have been 
good enough for previous generations will not cut it in the future, and what we 
have is not sustainable anyway. I certainly don’t want to end up in a care 
home, nor do I want to have to make the decision for my parents to go into one. 
My fiercely independent grandmother who died aged 94 lived at home until the 
last few weeks of her life when she became too unwell, she is not a rare breed, 
I’ve worked with many many older people over the years who have just wanted to 
stay in their own homes. It’s about choice, having the services in place to 
support people to make choices about how they want to live, and be supported 
when necessary in later life.

My concerns are the usual things like, health, mortality, money etc, but 
having a feeling of significance is also important.

From my experience of working with a number of older people, some of the main 
worries include stigmatisation and discrimination from the workplace. Some of 
the earlier comments I have read suggested that we need to better understand 
how we can ensure we value the skills and experience of older people in the UK 
which I absolutely agree with. Other major worries include social isolation and 
the inability to live independently within their own homes - something which we 
feel at the British Red Cross is a basic right and something we work tirelessly 
to advocate for.

They talked about the stereotypes around older people:

There are certainly stereotypes surrounding the 'baby boomers' - well off 
retirees who maybe took early retirement, own a couple of properties, takes 
frequent holidays. Whilst we have made significant strides in reducing 
pensioner poverty in the last 20 years (previously to be old meant most likely 
you would be poor), there is still a significant number of older people living 
in poverty today. And with wealth inequality comes health inequality, as the 
Marmot report of 2010 pointed out.

One of the common stereotypes of growing old is that older people don't 
contribute to society.
We need to give more recognition and pride to the contributions that older 
generations have already made and highlight the achievements that people are 
making now.

How is the environment geared towards (or against) older people taking part in 
their communities?

There are so many simple things that could be improved. For example, most 
people over 65 walk more slowly than the 1.2 metres per second that is assumed 
at pedestrian crossings. The result is older people rushing to get across a 
road as the lights turn to green and the traffic begins to move. As our society 
ages, and there are more of us over 65, it will become more and more necessary 
to fix basic problems like this.

Agree with that Simon. In Singapore the elderly have smart cards that they can 
swipe at road crossings and thus slow down the speed that traffic lights change.

A well designed outside environment can make the world of difference to 
community involvement for some older people. Small things, like well-placed 
benches for people to rest if they can't walk so well, public toilet provision 
and thoughtful use of lighting and colour to aid those with dementia can be the 
difference between being active and housebound. Such improvements can benefit 
us all ultimately. Some areas, like Manchester (who strive to be an 
age-friendly city) are doing better than others.

We shouldn't underestimate the role of understanding in the community too. The 
Dementia Friends campaign is a fantastic example of how to grow greater 
everyday awareness of a condition that affects many in our communities.

Making active transport (walking, cycling) more accessible for older people is 
important. We can learn a lot from our European neighbours here. In the UK, 
cycling remains a disproportionately young (and male) mode of transport. In the 
Netherlands and Germany, for example, it is far more common for older people to 
cycle. Improving cycle routes to make them safer is a start. In Scandinavia, 
planning laws encourage mixed-use development, making journeys from the home to 
shops and services a lot shorter, and more accessible for older people. This 
has obvious health benefits, but also can reduce isolation in our older 
population.

What employment opportunities are there for older people? How can we value 
their skills in the workplace?

I chair a local Medical Centre Patient Participation Group and we have a 
number of older members who are using their skills in the workplace. However 
working in later life needs to acknowledge our need for flexibility especially 
when our staying power might be reduced. Job sharing and part time work can be 
ideal for us.

At the British Red Cross we actively encourage older people to volunteer for 
our services. We often find that there is a lack of confidence or an assumption 
that they won't be considered due to the stigma and stereotypes and 
volunteering often helps build confidence within a modern working environment. 
There are a number of opportunities to increase work opportunities for older 
people, someone mentioned previously that the 3rd sector has notoriously low 
numbers of older people as employees despite having the most experience of 
advocating for them as a group. It's a cultural shift that's needed so that 
young people growing up are understanding the value of older people and the 
many benefits they can bring to the workplace.

The short answer Sarah is not enough! There is evidence of age discrimination 
in the workplace as the recent government report ' A New Vision for Older 
Workers: Retain, Retrain recruit' shows.
Interestingly more older people are becoming self employed.
