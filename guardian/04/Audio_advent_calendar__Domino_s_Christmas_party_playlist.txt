It's day three of our selection of festive treats from the people at Domino 
and Warp Records. And by now you're probably thinking about what to play at 
your own Christmas parties. Well have no fear, for Domino has created its own 
alternative playlist for those whose heads might explode if they hear Slade one 
more time. Here's what the peeps at the label had to say about theadominoparty 
playlist 
<http://open.spotify.com/user/dominorecords/playlist/3kgoGCA1mNOGNnHUMMjVqc>.

"Now that December has rolled around it's officially the season for people to 
pretend Christmas is all about wholesome family fun, when in reality for most 
of us it's that time of the year when we probably drink too much, dance to naff 
music we'd never usually listen to and generally make fools of ourselves in 
front of co-workers.

To usher in the festivities Domino has compiled a party playlist consisting 
entirely of tracks made by Domino artists, so if you find yourself at a house 
party and feel like you want to avoid banging out Last Christmas again and 
again, now you have the option to do so."
