Owen Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> has raised the 
possibility of a future Labour government seeking renewed British membership of 
the EU, saying the UK could rejoin the bloc if the political and economic cost 
of Brexit was seen as too high.

The Labour leadership challenger has previously promised to push for a new 
referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-to-offer-referendum-on-brexit-deal-if-elected-labour-leader>
 on the terms of any Brexit deal if he defeats Jeremy Corbyn, but on Sunday 
went further.

He said it would be “sensible and responsible” for a Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government to seek a return to 
the EU, if Theresa May led the UK out of the union before the 2020 election, 
and if the provision of public services was badly hit by the move.

Labour leadership: Jeremy Corbyn v Owen Smith on BBC Question Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/08/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-bbc-question-time-video>
Asked on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show about the possible fallout from the 
government triggeringarticle 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu>
 in time for an exit before the next general election, Smith said reapplying 
for membership again was theoretically possible.

“I think it’s very hard to answer because it’s a hypothetical question,” Smith 
said.


“At that point, if we had gone into a further recession, if we had the 
prospect of another 10 years of Tory austerity, if they were saying that the 
price for our staying out is opening up the NHS to private sector competition, 
it is worse terms and conditions – ‘more flexibility and less red tape’, as the 
Tories would no doubt dub it – then I think the sensible and responsible thing 
for a Labour government to do is to say we are better off in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.” 


Asked if this could potentially mean Britain being obliged, as a new member, 
to sign up to theSchengen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past>
 free-travel area, Smith said: “Potentially, but again we are getting into 
hypotheticals built on hypotheticals.”

Jeremy Corbyn says UK should reject key aspects of single market after Brexit

The former shadow pensions secretary argued that, rather than reach this 
point, May needed to give Britons a say on what an eventual Brexit deal would 
mean. “If she were to trigger article 50 before the British public knows what 
the real Brexit deal is, I think that would be dereliction of duty on her 
part,” Smith said.

“My point is simple: once we know what the deal is, that’s the point at which 
you have an extra democratic moment in Britain.”


This could involve another referendum, or a general election, with Labour 
arguing for remaining in the EU “because the terms of the deal are not what we 
were promised”, Smith said.

Corbyn has ruled out pushing for a second referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-second-referendum-brexit>
 on Brexit, arguing that the 23 June result must be respected.

Corbyn’s leadership team pointed out on Sunday that Tim Roache, general 
secretary of the Smith-supporting GMB union, also did not agree with Smith 
about this, telling Sky News’s Murnaghan programme “that boat has sailed”.

A spokesman for Corbyn’s leadership campaign said of Smith: “He has made a 
second referendum on the EU a core part of his campaign and today one of his 
chief backers has rejected the policy. If he can’t even unite his own 
supporters, how can he unite our party?”

Smith is seen as unlikely to defeat Corbyn in the vote of Labour members and 
registered supporters, to be announced at the start of the party’s annual 
conference on 24 September.

Smith remains publicly bullish, however. Asked by Marr how confident he was of 
success on a scale of one to 10, Smith said: “Ten, absolutely.”
