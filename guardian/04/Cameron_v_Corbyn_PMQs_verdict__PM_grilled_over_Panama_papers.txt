Key points

Corbyn used PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> to put the Panama 
papers back on the agenda, pushing Cameron on the Tory voting record in Europe 
on tax regulations and cuts to the tax-collecting agencies and accusing him of 
failing to make the crown dependencies more transparent. Cameron responded that 
a UK register would be published, insisting that that was progress.

Snap verdict

This was probably a draw, but it was a reasonably informative one which saw 
both Corbyn and Cameron make some solid points. Corbyn’s best question was his 
first one, about the voting record of Tory MEPs on multinational taxation, and 
Cameron did not even try to address it. But Cameron was more comfortable when 
Corbyn turned to HMRC funding (because he was able to quote figures about staff 
numbers going up between 2010 and 2015 – although tellingly he did not say what 
would happen by 2020) and, when Corbyn got on to tax havens and whether their 
registers of beneficial ownership would be public, we got into the familiar 
political dialogue of “We’ve done more than was done before” versus “It’s not 
as much as you’ve promised”. But it is probably the first time Cameron has been 
as explicit as this in public about admitting that his original plans to get 
the Virgin Islands etc to have public registers have been shelved.

Best lines

Cameron accused Corbyn of sloppiness in his tax returns, which he described as:

Late, chaotic, inaccurate and uncosted

But Corbyn’s come-back drew the bigger cheers: 


I paid more tax than some companies owned by people he might know quite well
