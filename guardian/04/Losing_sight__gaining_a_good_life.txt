When Bhya was 12 she suffered a trauma and lost her sight over three days, due 
to retinal detachment. Her parents took her to the hospital every day, 
returning to work to gather the money for the treatment, but they were unable 
to save her sight.

"At first I was very angry," says Bhya. "I was at an age that I couldn't 
understand the enormity of what had happened. But, after years of living in the 
dark, I have finally learned to accept that pain."

Itinerant teacher Mamesh supported Bhya through her schooling and she 
undertook a six-month course in Bangalore which has made her computer literate. 
She is now able to navigate a computer using the Jaws programme, designed for 
the blind, although she does not have a computer at home. Further training has 
enabled her to become a useful member of the household. "It was due to the 
intervention of NAB and my itinerant teacher that I have been able to pick up 
the pieces. Due to their training, I am able to help in the household. I still 
cannot cook, but I can tidy and clean."

Now she enjoys singing with her friends, doing crosswords and gossiping about 
the latest Hindi films. When she lost her sight her friends moved away, as they 
didn't know how to relate to a blind person. To them, she'd changed; she was 
not the friend they knew. But since Bhya has been integrated back into school 
and has relearned mobility and orientation, they have regained their 
friendships, recognising that she is, after all, the same girl she was before.
