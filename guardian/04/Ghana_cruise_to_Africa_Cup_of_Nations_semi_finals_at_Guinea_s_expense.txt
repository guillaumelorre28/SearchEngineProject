Christian Atsu scored two goals and Kwesi Appiah added another to help Ghana 
advance to the semi-finals of theAfrica Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> for the fifth 
successive time with a 3-0 victory over Guinea in Malabo.

Atsu, currently on loan at Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, put the Black Stars ahead in 
the fourth minute after a backheeled pass from André Ayew. Appiah, who recently 
ended a period on loan from Crystal Palace to Cambridge United, scored Ghana’s 
second a minute before the interval, controlling a horrible defensive mistake 
from Baissama Sankoh and beating the Guinea goalkeeper, Naby Yattara.

Atsu then made the result safe with his second in the 61st minute, whipping in 
a cross-shot from the right which drifted in.

To complete a miserable night for Guinea, Yattara was shown a red card in 
injury time for a foul on the former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan. The 
defender Abdoulaye Cissé played in goal for the final seconds.

Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> will face the host nation 
Equatorial Guinea in the semi-finals on Thursday in Malabo.
