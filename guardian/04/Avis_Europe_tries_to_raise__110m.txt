Car rental company Avis Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/aviseurope> is asking shareholders for 
Â£110m to fund its recovery strategy.

Its fortunes are linked to air travel and though the sector is recovering from 
the impact of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the Sars outbreak and the war in Iraq, 
growing use of online booking has put pressure on rental prices.

"We believe that successful implementation of our margin recovery strategy 
should deliver an improvement of between three and five percentage points over 
the next three to four years," said Murray Hennessy, Avis Europe's chief 
executive.

The company is offering four new shares for every seven held and the cash call 
already has the backing of its main shareholder - the Belgian D'Ieteren family.

The new shares are being offered at 35p each - a 34% discount to the 
theoretical ex-rights price of 53p. Last night Avis Europe shares closed at 63p.
