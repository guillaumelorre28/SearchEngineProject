From Alison, no age given

Dear Carole, I have been with my partner for two and a half years. I have 
never met his family as I'm 11 years older than him, but we were happy until 
three weeks ago when his mum passed away. I haven't heard from him since. I 
have texted him and phoned him but he never replies. I am told he has hit the 
drink big time and is fighting, which isn't him. He was been seen sitting on a 
bench with a couple of bottles of cider early in the morning and now it's 
breaking my heart because I can't help him. I have lost a stone in weight, I 
can't eat or sleep. Please tell me what I should do.

I'm saddened to hear your news. But it seems your problems began when you 
first met two and a half years ago, rather than three weeks ago, when his 
mother passed away. I fail to understand a rationale, which you seem to 
endorse, that results in your being forbidden from meeting his family because 
you are 11 years his senior. Does it follow, therefore, that you would never be 
good enough to meet his family? Caveats of this sort are untenable. And now, 
after caring for this man for two and a half years, he doesn't consider you 
worthy of an explanation.

There is an alternative scenario. It is possible that your age is not the 
issue, but rather he didn't want you to meet his family because he was ashamed 
of them. Or that he had a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and he 
didn't want you to become aware of this. He didn't feel able to be honest with 
you and admit any of this for fear of his status falling, so, instead, he 
focused on the age gap and made your status fall,your loss becoming his 
short-term gain (pdf)

.

Of course this is conjecture, but if this alternative is closer to the truth, 
he may now be experiencing misogynistic feelings and be dealing with mixed 
emotions of regret and anger, hence his fighting and drinking.

But whatever his motivators, the facts are: you invested years of your life 
caring for him and he abandoned you. The giving of time is the greatest of 
gifts and sharing time with him gave you happiness and meaning. It is possible 
that you mothered him and gave selflessly.But he was not similarly attached

 to you and thus not compelled to either come to you in his time of need or 
give you an explanation for his disappearance. I thinkthis man freeloaded 
<http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513807000384> on your kindness
 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18930761> and focused on your insecurities 
to mask his own vulnerabilities. He has now hit a crisis but as he doesn't feel 
any depth of commitment to you,he sees no reason to reciprocate 
<http://www.jstor.org/pss/2822435> your care and communicate with you, and this 
uncertainty has left you distraught and your health damaged.

I doubt this man can be fixed; his self-absorption will probably always push 
you away. Let him go, if you don't, you may become the person he fights with 
and one day you might find yourself, drinking cider on a bench in the early 
hours.
