Ashley Cole <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ashley-cole> is considering 
an offer from LA Galaxy, with the MLS side confident they can convince the 
former England international to cancel his contract with Roma.

The Italian side are desperate to sever their ties with the 35-year-old and end
a disastrous spell in Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/22/ashley-cole-roma> six 
months before the two-year contract was due to end.

If Cole reaches a settlement with Roma and decides to join LA Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy> he would play in his 
third league and country in his 18th season as a professional footballer.

The former England defender has not featured for Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> this season and not even been 
included in a single first-team squad after being told he could leave last 
summer. Last season, Cole played only 11 league games for theGiallorossi and 
his time in Italy is in stark contrast to what he achieved in England with 
Arsenal and Chelsea. He won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups with 
the two London teams as well as the Champions League with Chelsea.
