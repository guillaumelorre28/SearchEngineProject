The plain fact is that we are not going to get proper funding for social care 
until we see providers either exiting the market, or refusing unsustainable 
contracts (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/06/government-committed-to-highest-standards-in-social-work>
, 7 July). This must be a warning to local authorities and the government that 
once this sector starts to fail it will also bring the NHS to breaking point 
because nobody can be discharged. At which point we hope the minister of state 
might finally get it into his head that social care is an essential part of the 
system.

• So Die Welt writer Mara Delius expresses the view that Merkel, May, Sturgeon 
et al are coming along to “clean up the mess created by the men” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/sturgeon-may-leadsom-women-to-the-rescue-amid-political-turmoil>
, 6 July). Or, as the teacher Mrs Lintott put it in Alan Bennett’s The History 
Boys: “History is women following behind, with a bucket.” Precisely.

• Artificial turf (Warnings of habitat loss as homeowners opt for artificial 
turf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/04/growth-in-artificial-lawns-poses-threat-to-british-wildlife-conservationists-warn>
, 4 July)? That’s not all. What about artificial hedges, and globular pretend 
topiary atop unnecessarily tall gateposts of stone, concrete or pylon-like 
ironwork? Plastic “gardens” represent habitat loss for developing humans as 
well as for wildlife.

• Robert Philip of Edinburgh (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/05/how-london-has-a-friend-in-carole-king>
, 6 July) should raise his sights. Nowadays, only plebs resign; the elite “step 
down”.
