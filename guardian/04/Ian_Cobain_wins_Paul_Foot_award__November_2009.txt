Guardian journalist Ian Cobain has won the Paul Foot award 2009 for his 
investigation into British involvement in the torture of terror suspects 
detained overseas.

Ian was shortlisted alongside the Guardian's Paul Lewis for the coverage of 
the death of Ian Tomlinson at the G20 protests in London in April. Sunday Times 
journalists John Calvert and Claire Newman and the Daily Mail's Stephen Wright 
and Richard Pendlebury were also shortlisted.

The chairman of judges, Brian MacArthur, said Cobain had uncovered the 
existence of a "secret, government-sanctioned interrogation policy ... that led 
to suspects being tortured".

"Last March, Gordon Brown told the Commons that the interrogation policy was 
to be rewritten and that it would then be made public," MacArthur added. "In 
June 2009 he was able to disclose the fact that Tony Blair was aware of this 
policy."

The award, set up by The Guardian and Private Eye in memory of the journalist 
Paul Foot, is given for investigative or campaigning journalism.
