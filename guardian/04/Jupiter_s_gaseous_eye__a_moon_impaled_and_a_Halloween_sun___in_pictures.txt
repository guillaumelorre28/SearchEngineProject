Eye of the storm: Nasa <https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa> released 
this close-up of Jupiter and its Great Red Spot, taken by Hubble on 21 April as 
the shadow of the Jovian moon, Ganymede, swept over the 16,000-kilometre-wide 
storm.

In another trick of perspective, Saturn’s moon Tethys appears to have been 
impaled on the planet’s A and F rings in this picture taken in visible light by 
the Cassini spacecraft. Both Tethys and the particles that make up the rings 
are primarily ice. The gap in the A ring through which Tethys is visible is the 
Keeler gap, which is swept clear by the moon Daphnis (not visible here). The 
picture was taken at a distance of approximately 1.8m kilometres from Tethys.

moon’s seas are mostly liquid methane and ethane. This new view, which shows 
Titan in infrared light, was captured by Cassini’s Visible and Infrared Mapping

Astronomers used images of Saturn’s icy moon Mimas taken by Cassini to 
determine how much the moon wobbles as it orbits the planet.They concluded 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4342> that either the moon has a 
frozen core shaped like a football, or it contains an ocean of liquid water.

Saturn’s moon Hyperion, which looks a bit like a dirty ball of expanded 
polystyrene, iselectrostatically charged 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4340>. A new analysis of data 
from a Cassini flyby in 2005 found that the spacecraft was briefly bathed in a 
beam of electrons shooting from the moon’s charged surface. Our own moon is the 
only other astronomical body known to be electrostatically charged, but 
astronomers believe many objects, such as asteroids and comets, carry such a 
charge.

Bright and dark ‘slope streaks’ <http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_038044_1965> 
inside craters in the Arabia Terra region of Mars. The formation of slope 
streaks is among the few active processes know to be occurring on the red 
planet. The cause of the streaks is uncertain, with both dry and wet processes 
being proposed. The most popular theory is that the slopes form by 
gravity-driven, fluid-like movement of dry sand or fine-grained dust (analogous 
to an avalanche on Earth) exposing darker underlying material.

A photo composite of the encounter between Comet Siding Spring and Mars on 19 
October <http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/45/>. Separate 
Hubble images of Mars and the comet have been combined into a single picture. A 
single photographic exposure of the stars, the comet and Mars would be blurred 
because all the objects are moving relative to each other and Hubble can only 
track one target at a time. In addition, Mars is 10,000 times brighter than the 
comet, so its exposure here has been adjusted so that details on the red planet 
can be seen.

Hubble picked up the ghostly glow 
<http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/43/> of stars ejected 
from ancient galaxies that were gravitationally ripped apart several billion 
years ago. The mayhem happened 4bn light-years away, inside an immense 
collection of nearly 500 galaxies nicknamed Pandora’s Cluster. No longer bound 
to any one galaxy, the scattered stars now drift freely. By observing the light 
from the orphaned stars, Hubble astronomers have assembled forensic evidence 
that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to shreds inside the cluster 
over a period of six billion years.

A new image from Nasa’s Spitzer Space Telescope 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4350>, captured in infrared 
light, reveals where the star-forming action is taking place in galaxy NGC 
1291. The outer ring, coloured red, is filled with new stars that are igniting 
and heating up dust, which glows with infrared light. The stars in the central 
area (blue) produce shorter-wavelength infrared light. This is where older 
stars live, having long ago gobbled up the available gas supply, or fuel, for 
making new stars. The galaxy is about 12bn years old and is 33m light years 
away in the Eridanus constellation.

A laser beam cuts through the night sky from Unit Telescope 4 of the European 
Space Observatory’sVery Large Telescope 
<http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt.html> in Chile. The two Magellanic 
Clouds are visible to the left of the beam as faint, fuzzy patches against the 
starry background. The particularly bright star to the right of the beam is 
Canopus, the second brightest star in our night sky after Sirius.


The beam is part of the telescope’s adaptive optics system, which compensates 
for the distorting effect of water vapour, pollution and turbulence in the 
atmosphere using deformable mirrors. The laser creates an artificial star about 
90 kilometres from the ground. Astronomers can then measure how this fake star 
twinkles and correct for the distortion. At certain wavelengths, telescopes 
that use adaptive optics can produce images sharper even than those from 
space-based telescopes.

Pareidolia is the psychological phenomenon whereby people see recognisable 
patterns in clouds, rock formations,food 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/jul/21/jesus-food-sightings> – 
or space. When an image from Nasa’s Chandra X-ray Observatory of PSR B1509-58 – 
a spinning neutron star surrounded by a cloud of energetic particles – was 
released in 2009, it quickly gained attention because many saw a hand-like 
structure in the X-ray emission.

In this image of the same system, X-rays from Chandra (in gold) are seen along 
with infrared data from Nasa’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope 
(red, green and blue). Pareidolia has struck again because some report seeing 
an ethereal face in the infrared data. Spooky …

Pareidolia strikes again. On 8 October, active regions on the sun combined to 
look something like a jack-o-lantern made from a hollowed-out pumpkin. The 
active regions appear brighter because they emit more light and energy, 
reflecting the intense and complex magnetic fields hovering in the sun’s 
atmosphere or corona.
