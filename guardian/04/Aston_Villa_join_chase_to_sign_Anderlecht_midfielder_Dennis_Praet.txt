Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> have joined the 
race to sign Dennis Praet, the highly rated Belgium international who is also 
attracting interest from Southampton and Everton. Praet is set to leave 
Anderlecht this summer for a fee in the region of £10m and Villa have made an 
inquiry about the possibility of making an offer for the midfielder.

Some of the leading clubs in Europe have pursued Praet, who is now represented

remains to be seen whether Villa can be genuine contenders for the 
21-year-old’s signature.

The Midlands club are on the verge of bringing in another midfielder
