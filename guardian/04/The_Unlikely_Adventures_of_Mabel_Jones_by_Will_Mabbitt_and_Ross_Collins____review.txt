This book is action-packed, hilarious and quirky. It is about a girl called 
Mabel Jones, who after doing something a little disgusting is sucked up into a 
magical world with pirates and ends up as part of the motley crew on the ship, 
The Feroshus Maggot. In order to make it home she helps the captain get the 
missing parts of the mysterious pieces of X. On the voyage she faces lots of 
different and exciting trials such as challenging a ferocious bear to a milk 
drinking contest.

I found this book really hilarious, especially the narrator who pauses the 
story at an exciting bit to talk about pickled onions. The narrator does lots 
of funny things, such as interviewing the mysterious figure who is about to 
kidnap Mabel Jones and using odd similes such as “quiet as a peanut and sneaky 
as a woodlouse in a jar of raisins”. Even the chapter headings are really silly 
and made me laugh too.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is fun, imaginative and doesn’t mind 
a little yuckiness in stories.
