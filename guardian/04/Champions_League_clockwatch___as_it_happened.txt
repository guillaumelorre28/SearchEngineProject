Well that's about it from me. Basel's is clearly the result of the night, with 
Ajax also impressing. Celtic the major disappointment, against a Milan side in 
terrible form whom they would have had genuine hopes of beating. Here'san 
Arsenal match report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/26/arsenal-marseille-match-report-champions-league>
, by way of parting gift.

9.50pm GMT 

Jose Mourinho says: "A bad performance. A deserved defeat. But because of 
other results we qualify, and that is the only positive thing from this night. 
Now we have to get a result to be first.Everything I didn't like, from the 
first minute. The first second we made a defensive mistake. The team only had a 
bit of stability and a bit of control in the second half, but I felt the team 
was tired."

9.45pm GMT 

"The only positive thing tonight is that we qualified," says Petr Cech. "We 
didn't play well. In theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> if you give your 
opponent the feeling that they can, they can. It was not our day."

9.44pm GMT 

So a couple of Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> stats:

Shots on target Basel 10-0 Chelsea
Shots off target Basel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> 6-1 Chelsea

9.41pm GMT 

Just waiting for the full-time statistics to confirm quite how poor Chelsea 
were tonight. Still, it could be worse …

9.37pm GMT 

Final score: Celtic 0-3 Milan

Also, Porto 1-1 Austria Vienna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria-vienna>, and Ajax 2-1 Barcelona, 
bringing Barcelona's 25-match unbeaten run to an end.

9.37pm GMT 

Final score: Basel 1-0 Chelsea

Chelsea have qualified for the knock-out stages, but tonight's was as poor a 
performance as they've produced for some time.

9.35pm GMT 

Basel are on the attack again, but Serey Die blazes a volley over from 15 
yards. Steaua have drawn 0-0 withSchalke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> in the other game in Group E.

9.34pm GMT 

Final score: Arsenal 2-0 Marseille

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, meanwhile, have three 
stoppage-time minutes left to get a consolation against Milan.

9.33pm GMT 

There will be two minutes of stoppage time in Basel…

9.32pm GMT 

Another goal! Dortmund 3-1 Napoli

Aubameyang has scored. Arsenal fans everywhere look at the table and get their 
calculators out.
OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) 
3 - Borussia Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> 
have scored at least three goals in five of their last six home games in the 
Champions League. Attack.

9.30pm GMT 

GOAL! Basel 1-0 Chelsea!

With four minutes to go Basel have taken the lead! Salah breaks through on the 
inside left channel, onto a long crossfield ball from the right-back, and he 
cuts infield, races into the area and lifts the ball into the far corner!

9.26pm GMT 

Oooooh! Chelsea attack well, but a defender just beats Lampard to a loose ball 
in the penalty area, Basel run down the other end and Die's 20-yarder goes a 
foot wide.

9.24pm GMT 

Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> have another excellent 
chance, only for Robinho to be ruled only fractionally offside.

doing to him one bit. Photograph: Peter Klaunzer/EPA 
9.22pm GMT 

Chelsea have been much better in the second half than they were in the first, 
but still haven't had a shot.

9.19pm GMT 

Pepe Reina's busy putting in a man-of-the-match performance in Dortmund, 
Aubameyang the latest to be frustrated by the flying Spaniard.

9.16pm GMT 

GOAL! Dortmund 2-1 Napoli

Insigne scores for Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli>, and 
this group is very finely balanced as things stand. Meanwhile here's a picture 
of the last goal in that game, a classic of the gutted-keeper-in-the-background 
genre.

GOAL! A while ago!

Jackson Martínez equalised for Porto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/porto> against Austria Vienna three 
minutes into the second half. I don't know how that slipped under my radar*.

* I do: clearly Sky don't have anyone watching it, Twitter is busy tweeting 
about Arsenal and my PA ticker is one thing too many to be looking at.

9.10pm GMT 

"Just looked up 'foray' (8:09 - sorry, I was watching the Arsenal match), as 
you had them foraying forward and I was wondering if it's possible to foray 
backwards," writes Anne Williams. "Seems to be, provided enemy territory is 
behind you – but anyway, just to say, it comes from French into Middle English 
and is kin to 'forage'. Interesting, eh?" Fascinating, Anne. Um, thanks.

Meanwhile at Basel, Serey Die fouls Hazard, gets some studs in the shoulder as 
the Chelsea player goes down, gets booked and goes a bit mental at the referee. 
That haircut should have been a yellow card on its own, so Basel should be down 
to 10 men, really.

9.04pm GMT 

GOAL! Celtic 0-3 Milan

The ball is played over the top, and Balotelli doesn't have to touch it before 
he taps it across Fraser Forster and in from seven yards. This match is over.

9.02pm GMT 

Big news!

The floodlights have failed at Walton Casuals v Leatherhead.

8.58pm GMT 

Half-time stats from Basel showed the home side having nine shots, six on 
target, seven corners and 54% of possession. Chelsea, meanwhile, had no shots 
and one corner. When did Chelsea last have stats as bad as those?

8.56pm GMT 

Not only did Ajax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> concede a 
penalty, they also had Joel Veltman sent off, for a professional foul on Neymar.

8.55pm GMT 

Celtic have the ball in the net at last, but this time Van Dijk is offside! 
Meanwhile in Amsterdam, Xavi has reduced the arrears from the penalty spot – 
it's Ajax 2-1Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>.

8.53pm GMT 

GOAL! Celtic 0-2 Milan

… and action moves down to the other end, where Milan score from another 
right-wing corner. The ball loops beyond the far post, where Antonio Nocerino 
volleys it back across goal, and Cristián Zapata taps in from a yard out. This 
is very bad news for Celtic. Very bad indeed.

Updated at 8.53pm GMT

8.51pm GMT 

Incredible, astonishing miss!

The free-kick is blasted into the wall, and the rebound is chipped to the far 
post, where Virgil van Dijk is totally alone. He volleys the ball from six 
yards, with the goalkeeper totally stranded, and hits it straight at Abbiati! 
Anywhere else, except for not on target at all, and it was a certain goal.

8.49pm GMT 

Celtic have a tasty free-kick opportunity, won by Mikael Lustig at the end of 
a sexy dribble.

Updated at 8.52pm GMT

8.48pm GMT 

Peeeeeeep!

Various second halves are under way!

"I'm in southern Spain watching the Ajax vs Barcelona game and the 
commentators NEVER mention the goal line judges," writes Ian Markey, "…as far 
as I can tell. But then again they keep on speaking in foreign..so who knows?"

"I'm in the French Antilles," writes Dan, "and the French commentators never 
mention the goal line judges ever.Ils n'existent pas pour eux." Is not 
mentioning them at all a) better, b) just as bad, or c) worse?

8.35pm GMT 

Perhaps surprisingly, given how good they've been for so long, this is the 
19th time that Barcelona have been two or more goals behind at half-time. Their 
record in the previous 18: W0 D2 L16.

8.33pm GMT 

And that's half-time at Celtic, where Milan lead by one giftwrapped goal no 
nil. Meanwhile, here's a mini-match report from Barney Ronay at Arsenal.
Barney Ronay (@barneyronay) 
Strange game at the Emirates. Marseilles less a Champions League team more a

8.32pm GMT 

Celtic have a half-chance, but Samaras's corner-bound header is saved.

8.31pm GMT 

"For all that's good and compelling about the Champions' League, there are a 
few things that accompany it that are sadly inevitable but very tiresome," 
writes David Wall. "Aside from the pretty lame ITV coverage, with Adrian Chiles 
doing his 'I'm afraid of Roy Keane' shtick, there is always at least one 
mention of the penalty-box officials and how they don't do anything. Is that 
just an act now as everyone knows that they don't have a flag or similar to 
gesture in the way that linesmen do but rather communicate with the referee by 
earpiece radio so even if they make a decision we're not going to see them 
intervening? Is it peculiar to coverage in England or do commentators across 
Europe use the same mistaken cliche?" An interesting question there at the end 
– is anyone watching somewhere exotic able to provide an answer?

8.30pm GMT 

GOAL! Ajax 2-0 Barcelona

Fulham reject Danny Hoesen has put Ajax two up against Barcelona, tapping in 
the rebound after Fischer's shot is parried by the keeper.

8.28pm GMT 

GOAL!

Charlton have gone one up against Doncaster, Dale Stephens with it. Sure, it's 
not very Champions League, but still…

8.27pm GMT 

Currently at Basel Samuel Eto'o is lying on the pitch, flat on his back, doing 
the finger-twirling universally-recognised footballing gesture which means "get 
me off right now". It looks like his calf was stud-scraped by Serey Die. 
Fernando Torres is coming on.

8.25pm GMT 

Milan have a goal disallowed at Celtic because Balotelli is offside. A very 
marginal decision, and a lifeline for a Celtic side who have to win.

8.23pm GMT 

A missed penalty at Arsenal, where Özil's weak effort is saved. Yes, he is 
German, isn't he.

8.21pm GMT 

Azpilicueta nicks the ball off Salah's toes as the Basel forward was about to 
shoot. Well-timed challenge, that one.

8.20pm GMT 

Is it just me or are they playing with a giant football in Dortmund?

League match against Borussia Dortmund. Photograph: Ina Fassbender/Reuters 
8.18pm GMT 

Controversy at Port Vale, where Joe Garner should have been sent off for 
throwing a punch. The referee got a bit confused and sent off another Preston 
player instead, and Garner has just put Preston ahead.

8.17pm GMT 

Substitution at Celtic Park, where Joe Ledley has come on for the injured 
Kayal.

8.16pm GMT 

A fine attack by Milan ends when the ball is nudged into the path of Kaka, who 
decides not to sweep it into the bottom corner and instead attempts an 
ambitious chipped pass that dcoesn't find its target. Moments later Kaka does 
have a shot, from a good 30 yards, and this one curls viciously but not quite 
enough to nestle inside the post.

8.13pm GMT 

Here's a first post-kick-off photo of Elie Baup, which does appear to confirm 
the talk of ski instructor impersonations.

A shot at Celtic, where Commons' right-footed 25-yarder sees him fall over and 
the ball fly over.

8.10pm GMT 

And moments later Salah only just fails to get on the end of a through-ball. 
Chelsea are rocking here.

8.09pm GMT 

Great save from Petr Cech! Basel are attacking with intent and numbers against 
Chelsea, and their latest foray forward ends with Salah's shot hitting the 
ground and very nearly bouncing over Cech, who flings out a fist and pushes the 
ball wide.

8.03pm GMT 

Chelsea survive a penalty shout, after a ball kicked from a chap perhaps two 
yards away hits Lampard on the hip and bounces into his arm. The referee is 
rightly unimpressed.

8.03pm GMT 

Milan's Abate is rolling around the Celtic Park pitch like he has had a limb 
amputated without anaesthetic. He was tripped. The physio is currently 
administering magic healing spray. "Associazione Calcio Milan, Futbol Club 
Barcelona, Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax, and The Celtic Football Club? 
That's an average of 3.5 words per team name…" insists Oliver Pattenden. We 
don't count words like "the" and "football club" here.

8.01pm GMT 

And now a chance for Chelsea at the other end! Ivanovic crosses from the 
right, and Eto'o just misses with a desperate leg-swing in the middle.

8.00pm GMT 

Nearly an identical goal against Chelsea! A corner from the right wing is 
swung in by Basel, and it would have gone in had anyone got their head to it, 
and would have curled in all by itself but for Mikel on the line!

7.58pm GMT 

GOAL! Celtic 0-1 Milan!

Milan score from a corner! A lovely ball in, but Kaka shouldn't really be 
totally unmarked five yards from goal, should he? Criminal defending, that.

7.57pm GMT 

GOAL!

Reus puts Dortmund ahead against Napoli from the penalty spot.

7.56pm GMT 

Awesome Celtic miss! Kayal's low 25-yarder falls instead to, I think, Commons, 
who gets his feet in a mess, scoops his shot wide and weak and falls over.

7.53pm GMT 

A pretty even match so far at Celtic Park. The home side have the territorial 
advantage, but haven't got the ball into the Milan box so far.

7.52pm GMT 

This from the Independent's Sam Wallace. I'll be seeking urgent photographic

A shot at Celtic, and it's from Balotelli, but his 20-yard left-footer is 
dragged wide of the far post.

7.47pm GMT

Arsenal have scored! Perhaps 30 seconds on the clock, before Wiltshire runs 
down the right, cuts inside, jinks back onto his left foot and hits the ball

Across Europe, players are in tunnels and fans are in full song. Actual real 
sport is just a stroll-out, an anthem, some handshakes, a quick warm-up, a coin

7.39pm GMT 

True fact: Milan become the third team in European history to not have anyone 
wearing a shirt number between 1 and 11 in their starting XI.

7.19pm GMT 

A bit of bonus information on the British sides, courtesy of the Press 
Association. First,Celtic:

Neil Lennon made four changes to his Celtic team for their crunch Champions 
League Group H clash with AC Milan at Parkhead. The Hoops boss, who had to do 
without suspended duo Scott Brown and Nir Biton, brought in Mikael Lustig, 
Beram Kayal, James Forrest and Derk Boerrigter, who scored his first goal for 
Celtic since signing from Ajax in the summer in their 3-1 home Scottish 
Premiership win over Aberdeen on Saturday. Milan arrived without a win in their 
last seven games and with coach Massimiliano Allegri under pressure, but their 
star-studded line-up included Kaka, Mario Balotelli and captain Riccardo 
Montolivo.

Chelsea

Willian replaced Eden Hazard in the solitary change as Chelsea looked to 
confirm their place in the Champions League knockout stages at Basle. Victory 
at St Jakob-Park would secure top spot in Group E and a point would be enough 
to confirm the Blues' place in the last 16 - something which eluded the 2012 
European Cup winners last season. José Mourinho stuck with 10 of the players 
who began Saturday's 3-0 win at West Ham, with Hazard on the substitutes' bench 
alongside a fit-again Fernando Torres, as Chelsea sought a fourth successive 
win in the Champions League, following the opening home loss to Basle.

Arsenal

Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini returned from suspension for Tuesday 
night's Champions League clash against Marseille at the Emirates Stadium. 
Forward Theo Walcott, fit again from an abdominal problem, was on the bench 
along with Santi Cazorla and Mikel Arteta, as Tomas Rosicky made the starting 
XI. Spain defender Nacho Monreal came into the side with Kieran Gibbs missing 
from the squad and striker Nicklas Bendtner – cautioned by the police for 
criminal damage at his luxury apartment block - was on the bench. Marseille are 
bottom of Group F with four straight defeats. Andre-Pierre Gignac led their 
attack, with promising Florian Thauvin among the substitutes.

7.17pm GMT 

All the Champions League teams are in, though unless you've only just arrived 
here you might need to manually refresh to see them.

7.05pm GMT 

Tonight's football matches in total fulness. They are all 7.45pm, except for 
one of them:

Champions League Group E

Basel v Chelsea
Key fact: The Basel coach, Murat Yakin, played for Switzerland against England 
in a Euro 2004 group game. Frank Lampard, John Terry and Ashley Cole all played

Draxler, Obasi Ogbuke, Ayhan, Matip.
Referee: Bas Nijhuis (Holland).

Champions League Group F

Arsenal v Marseille

Wilshere, Ozil, Rosicky, Giroud.Subs: Fabianski, Vermaelen, Arteta, Walcott,

Mendy, Fanni, Valbuena.
Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Spain).

Borussia Dortmund v Napoli
Key fact: Napoli's record against German teams: P8 W1 D2 L5. This isn't very 
good, but on the plus side that one victory was against tonight's opponents, in 
September
Borussia Dortmund: Weidenfeller, Grosskreutz, Bender, Papastathopoulos, Durm, 
Sahin, Kehl, Blaszczykowski, Mkhitaryan, Reus, Lewandowski.Subs: Langerak,

Pandev, Mertens, Higuain.Subs: Rafael Cabral, Bruno Uvini, Britos, Insigne, 
Cannavaro, Inler, Zapata.
Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)

Champions League Group G

Zenit v Atlético
Key fact: This match has already finished. It finished 1-1, which means 
Austria Vienna will be absolutely, mathematically out unless they win.
Porto v Austria Vienna
Key fact: Austria's record in Portugal: P4 L4 F2 A15 GD-13. This is absolutely 
awful.
Porto: Helton, Danilo, Maicon, Mangala, Alex Sandro, Fernando, Gonzalez, 
Defour, Josue, Martinez, Lica.Subs: Fabiano, Quintero, Reyes, Herrera, Varela, 
Ricardo, Otamendi.
FK Austria Vienna: Lindner, Koch, Rogulj, Ortlechner, Suttner, Holland,

Ramsebner, Mader, Leovac.
Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania).

Champions League Group H

Ajax v Barcelona
Key fact: Although Ajax have won a creditable 40.6% of all their competitive 
matches against Spanish teams, they've lost their last nine on the spin. 
Barcelona have never, ever played a competitive match in Amsterdam before, 
oddly.
Ajax: Cillessen, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Boilesen, Klaassen, Blind, 
Serero, Schone, Hoesen, Fischer.Subs: Vermeer, Poulsen, van der Hoorn, Duarte, 
Andersen, Denswil, De Sa.
Barcelona: Pinto, Puyol, Mascherano, Pique, Montoya, Xavi, Song, Iniesta, 
Pedro, Fabregas, Neymar.Subs: Oier, Bartra, Busquets, Sergi Roberto, Gabarron, 
Traore, Dongou.
Referee: Pavel Kralovec.

Celtic v Milan
Key fact: Celtic have lost just 8.7% of their home games in the Champions 
League group stage, winning 69.6%. After scoring 21 penalties on the spin, 
Mario Balotelli has missed two of his most recent three.
Celtic: Forster, Lustig, Ambrose, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Boerrigter, Mulgrew, 
Kayal, Forrest, Commons, Samaras.Subs: Zaluska, Stokes, Ledley, Balde, Rogic, 
Pukki, Fisher.
Milan: Abbiati, Abate, Zapata, Bonera, Emanuelson, Montolivo, De Jong, Poli, 
Birsa, Kaka, Balotelli.Subs: Coppola, Robinho, Matri, Constant, Nocerino, 
Cristante, Silvestre.
Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey).

Important question: How often has a Champions League group consisted entirely 
of teams with single-word names (such as Ajax, Barcelona, Celtic and Milan)?

Familiar Cuddly Domestic Championship
Charlton v Doncaster
Key fact: Fully 45.8% of all goals conceded by Doncaster in the league this 
season have come in the last 15 minutes (plus stoppage time) of matches.

Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime, here's some news ahead of Celtic 
v Milan:

Should Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> keep their 
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> dreams 
alive with victory overMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, 
they would also plunge theRossoneri even further into crisis.

Milan had cause to be grateful for some respite when landing in Glasgow on 
Monday evening. Some 400 furious supporters prevented the team bus from 
departing San Siro after the 1-1 draw with Genoa on Saturday. It took until 
midnight and for senior players, includingKaká 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/kaka>, to address the irate crowd before 
calm was restored.

"Speaking to fans wasn't a huge burden for me," Kaká said. "It is not 
something I am used to but as one of the senior players I have to get used to 
responsibility."

The unrest is understandable. Milan sit 13th in Serie A, four points above the 
relegation zone and 20 adrift of the leaders, Juventus. Massimiliano Allegri's 
team have not won away from home all season or at all in their past seven 
matches.

"It is only normal that the fans are disappointed but they are not the only 
ones," Allegri said. "The staff and the players share that disappointment. We 
have to do better. We have three objectives: to qualify from the Champions 
League group stage, in Serie A we have to improve and we have the Coppa Italia. 
Any other problems, the players don't have to worry about. They just need to 
stay focused."

And more ahead of Basel v Chelsea:

José Mourinho <https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho> has called 
onChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> to secure their 
passage into the knockout phase of theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> with victory at Basel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> on Tuesday as his players enter a 
cluttered and pivotal period of the season where "only the brave can survive".

A victory at St Jakob-Park will claim Group E for the Europa League holders 
and allow Mourinho to rest key personnel for the final group game againstSteaua 
Bucharest <https://www.theguardian.com/football/steauabucharest>. Chelsea have 
nine fixtures in all competitions in December with Mourinho, sporting a repeat 
of his self-styled "going to war" crewcut from 2006, urging his players to 
prove their quality and stamp their authority on the campaign.

"This is a period I like, a period where the squad can play a role, not just 
the team," the manager said. "It's a period where I think only the brave can 
survive because it's so hard. We go into the Christmas period and the 
accumulation of matches is so high. We don't do it as a normal thing … we do it 
as a special group with a special mentality, enjoying the situation and 
forgetting we don't have a Christmas like the Spanish, Italian and German 
players. But we have the pleasure of playing a period that's only for the brave.

"I always enjoyed this part of the year when I was in England, and I missed it 
when I was in Spain and Italy. We need a special mentality to cope with that 
situation. Nine matches, and one of them is the match against Steaua. Finish 
the job against Basel and we would ensure that, instead of having nine 
competitive matches, we only have eight. That would be important. That's our 
motivation, to kill the situation in the group stage and give us a bit of space 
in December."
