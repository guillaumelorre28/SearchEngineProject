Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> powerbroker Mark 
Ricciuto says the Crows thought Carlton were bluffing when they refused to 
accept a trade offer for star Bryce Gibbs.

The Crows emerged as one of the biggest losers of the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> trade period after failing to strike a 
deal for Gibbs, having gone public with their desire to bring home the 
contracted midfielder.

Ricciuto, who is chairman of the Crows’ list management committee, says the 
Blues were adamant they would only trade 27-year-old Gibbs for two first-round 
draft picks.

“That would have been irresponsible,” Ricciuto told Triple M radio.

“We thought that they might have been playing the game and then come back late 
and said ‘okay, he wants to go home. He is probably not going to be in our next 
premiership side so we’ll take somewhere in between’.

“If that happened, the deal would have been done yesterday. But it didn’t 
happen. We were surprised about that, we respect that (but) we are very, very 
disappointed.”

Carlton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/carlton> has hit back in response 
to its handling of the failed trade, saying the Crows undervalued the midfield 
star.

Carlton football boss Andrew McKay said the Blues would have been willing to 
move Gibbs for the right price but weren’t satisfied with the Crows’ offer, 
which is believed to have included the No13 draft pick and a future third-round 
selection.

“We obviously value Bryce more highly than they do,” McKay told SEN radio.

“They weren’t close. We were very clear with them. It wasn’t a matter of us 
mucking them around at all.”

Gibbs had been keen to return to Adelaide so he and his partner could 
reconnect with family and receive help with their young son.

The 2006 No1 draft pick is contracted through to 2019 and the Blues are 
confident they can help him through his personal issues.

“We believe we’ll be able to get him back into the fold and not make him feel 
too awkward,” McKay said.
