Yahoo has announced the closure of its last office in China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> in a new cost-cutting move.

The closure of its research and development office in Beijing will eliminate 
200 to 300 jobs, Bloomberg reported.

Yahoo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo> said it told employees 
about the closure on Wednesday 18 March. The California-based company has cut 
staff elsewhere as it struggles to keep up with the internet market’s 
transition from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

The move follows Yahoo’s announcement in January that it will spin off its 
stake in Chinese e-commerce giantAlibaba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba>, which last year listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange in a record offer.

In 2005, Yahoo bought a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1bn (£680m) and turned over 
control of its China operations to the group. It stopped offering its services 
in China in 2013.

Yahoo’s profit for the quarter ending in December fell 52% from a year earlier 
while revenue dipped 1%.
