The Guardian has won four awards at the Editorial Intelligence 
<http://www.editorialintelligence.com/> Comment Awards 2010, more than any 
other newspaper.

Prizes went to Jeff Jarvis - best media commentator; Mark Lawson - best 
cultural columnist; Comment is Free - best blog site; and Simon Jenkins who was 
named commentariat of the year beating stiff competition from Jonathan 
Freedland, Marina Hyde and Jenni Russell in an all Guardian shortlist.
