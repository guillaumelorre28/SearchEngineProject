What makes a man a man? Does he have to be big and strong? Is that enough to 
turn you on? How about bold and brave? Humorous and humane? Moody and 
mysterious? How about pretty and boyish, or patient and perceptive? But then 
again, some of these qualities are equally attractive in a woman. So what 
defines gender? Beauty is in the eye and other senses of the beholder, and 
sometimes the beer-holder, for these definitions are constantly evolving, 
thanks to cultural shifts, fashion and hormones. And few genres address this 
perception so directly, and effectively as that of song. So where do you start?

So is it best, in evolutionary terms, to be a big hairy hunk of ape with a 
smooth, strong voice? Perhaps a Tom Jones type, a big Barry White or a 
hellraising Oliver Reed? Or, with film so much in parallel with popular music, 
how about a dashing David Niven? Or someone with fleet-footed finesse – Fred 
Astaire, or have the discreet charm of James Stewart, the bad boldness of 
Robert Mitchum, or show a quietly subtle and humorous style, like that of Alec 
Guinness? How about aping a bare-chested Vladmir Putin on a horse? Careful - he 
might be reading this. Or a very different man of the people like the Boss 
himself,Bruce Springsteen <https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen>? Or 
do girls simply prefer Justin Bieber, David Essex, or indeed George Michael? 
And then there’s the Bee Gees. Manly chest wigs and medallions, anyone? Those 
tight trousers certainly did the trick with the vocals.

And what defines a woman? The curves of Marilyn Monroe? The mystery of Greta 
Garbo? The vampish bitchiness of Joan Crawford? The petite cuteness of Kylie 
Minogue, the pushiness of Madonna or the leggy energy of Beyonce? The quirky 
handsome beauty of the charismaticKatharine Hepburn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn>, or the delicate femininity 
of Audrey Hepburn? Does science govern our perception of sex and hormone 
balance or is it as much culture, hype, and media that attracts the cameras to 
Kim Kardashian?

Should a woman be strong, like Queen Elizabeth I, and be played with the sexy 
smile ofCate Blanchett <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett>, and 
yet be distant and cold, or tough like Catherine the Great or Xena the 
big-breasted beat-everyone-up yodelling Warrior Princess? Is it better to be a 
female boxer or be a fainting damsel in distress, tottering on high heels in a 
pencil skirt? Are women pretty in pink, or better pretty as Pink, or pretty 
attractive as punk? And indeed what is it about the supermodel that some find 
attractive? Is it to be pretty vacant?

Songs that talk about being a man or a woman may be imbued with insecurity, 
because they may be trying to seduce, or hold on to an identity they cannot 
control. What is the braggadocio of “I’m a man, you’re a woman” really saying? 
Is it that it wants to remind of what we are hardwired to do to each other now? 
Or is it saying “I’m not sure what’s going on”? Or who I really am at all? 
What’s fascinating about this is the emotional depth of gender identity, and 
how it suffuses so many songs with desire of all kinds. So your suggestions may 
play with any aspect of this theme, whether in musical style, title or lyrics.

 Shamir. Definitely his own man, if you see what I mean 
Some songs mix up gender definition entirely. Who can define David Bowie? Or 
Antony Hegarty? Tom Robinson? Or the incredible squeaky-voiced new talent that 
is Shamir? Which decade is the campest, and which the straightest in terms of 
gender definition? How many male popstars dress as women, or women as men? In 
the 1996 filmTrainspotting <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmevUH0kGg>, based 
on Irvine Welsh’s novel, Renton looks around a nightclub and says: “The world 
is changing. … 1,000 years from now there will be no guys and no girls, just 
wankers. Sounds great to me.”

 Men, women? What’s the difference? The world is changing … 
One of this year’s best films Force Majeure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/12/force-majeure-film-review-ruben-ostlund-avalanche>
, addresses the role of a husband and father after an avalanche during a ski 
holiday. Let’s just say it really puts the modern male under the microscope, 
and features a phenomenally strong performance by Lisa Loven Kongsli as the 
mother. And 1996’s New Zealand film,Once Were Warriors 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NV45ZuepZo>, is a powerful portrayal of 
ultimate machismo in Maori men who lose their identity and replace proud 
traditions with simply gettingpissed up in bar brawls 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZSv4HlyfIo>. Yes that’s you Jake the Mus (but 
don’t hit me). So who really protects and fights for the children? It’s the 
mother and eldest daughter, of course. But can the real Maori reinvent 
themselves with the next generation?

So then, it’s time to get manly and/or womanly in your song choices, and to 
work out what that really means. This week we welcome another great new guru to 
the chair, the brilliantBlackCombe 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12692573>, who will no doubt 
skillfully sort out all kinds of sex and gender issues in time for publication 
of a list by next Thursday 1 October. Put your gender-defining songs in 
comments by (and optionally in Spotify below)by last orders this coming Monday 
28 September at 11pm BST.

• There’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the

“zedded”, “donds” and otherstrange words used by RR regulars 
<http://www.rrindex.com/glossary.htm>.
