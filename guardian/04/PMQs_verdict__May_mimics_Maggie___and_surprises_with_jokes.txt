Snap verdict

Theresa May continues to surprise us. We were told that she does not do jokes, 
but the highlight of her first exchange with Corbyn at PMQs was a sustained, 
comic analogy that ended with May dropping her voice and saying: “Remind him of 
anybody?” in a tone that made her sound just likeMargaret Thatcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/01/margaret-thatcher-brexit-thatcherism-leave-1980s>
. We never knew impressions were among her talents. It was a rather funny joke, 
but unsettling, and it jarred slightly because it was out of character.

If Corbyn thought that the removal of David Cameron would spare him from 
scorn, he will have been disappointed. May is not as insulting as Cameron, but 
she delivered several withering put-downs in aPMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> that will be judged a success. For 
Corbyn, this was always going to be tricky, because May has the goodwill of 
Tory MPs behind her. He was right to identify some wide gaps between the 
rhetoric in May’s “one nation” Downing Street speech last week, and the 
government’s record, but his scattergun approach meant that he never 
highlighted these effectively.

Starting with a question on Orgeave was odd, too. For the public at large, 
this is an obscure piece of history, but it is a subject that matters to Labour 
and union members, and so perhaps this illustrated how the leadership contest 
is already dominating his thinking.

Most memorable lines

May mocked Corbyn’s question on unscrupulous bosses:

A boss who doesn’t listen to his workers, a boss who asks workers to double 
their workload, a boss who exploits the rules?

Then, lowering her tone and slowing her words in an uncanny Thatcheresque 
fashion, she added:

Remind him of anybody?
