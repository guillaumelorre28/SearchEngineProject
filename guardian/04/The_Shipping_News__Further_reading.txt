If you've enjoyed The Shipping News – and its eccentricity – as much as I 
have, I imagine you'll be keen to find out more about the author. The links 
gathered below should help – and I'll be glad to hear of any other suggestions 
in the comments. A few hints of the discoveries that await: Proulx's first book 
was published when she was 56, she's famous for her refusal to suffer fools, 
she spent a long time living in the woods … Amazing woman, in other words.

If you've yet to get hold of a copy of The Shipping News, you can buy a 
discounted version in the Guardian shop 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781857022421>
. Buying The Ashley Book Of Knots, is, sadly, a bit more of a facer. Even with 
a tasty £10 discount,you're going to have to shell out £40 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571096596>
. I still covet an edition, mind you. Four thousand pictures of knots and 
accompanying descriptions of their uses: it sets the imagination racing. Proulx 
suggests the same in the acknowledgements section of The Shipping News: 
"Without the inspiration of Clifford W Ashley's wonderful 1944 work, which I 
had the good fortune to find at a yard sale for a quarter, this book would have 
remained just the thread of an idea." Sadly, getting hold of a secondhand copy 
of the book nowadays appears to cost a fortune. So if you spot one in a sale, 
snap it up. If you get two copies, send one to me too!

This touching enconium by Alan Warner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/07/annie-proulx-hero-alan-warner> 
provides an excellent brief guide to the writer.

This interview with Atlantic Online 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/factfict/eapint.htm> gives some 
fascinating details about Proulx's life before writing, as well as her life as 
a writer. Also good for this nugget: Q: "What are you working on now?" A: "A 
collection of short stories set in Wyoming." I guess that'll be Brokeback 
Mountain then …

And here's the daddy. The Paris Review Art Of Fiction interview with Proulx

. Worth it for the joke about the traffic alone … Oh and the revelation that 
she's friends withJim White <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_White_(musician)>
, the genius behind Wrong Eyed Jesus.

Finally, just because, here's Seamus Heaney's Shipping Forecast 
<http://www.photoverulam.co.uk/Guide/Poetry/heaney.htm>:

Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Irish Sea:
Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux
Conjured by that strong gale-warming voice,
Collapse into a sibilant penumbra.
Midnight and closedown …
