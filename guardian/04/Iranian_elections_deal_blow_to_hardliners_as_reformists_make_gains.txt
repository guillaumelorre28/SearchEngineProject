candidates inFriday’s hard-fought elections

 appeared on course for a sweeping victory in Tehran, with a combination of 
moderates and independents sympathetic to President Hassan Rouhani leading in 
provinces.

A coalition of candidates supported by the reformists, dubbed “the list of 
hope” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/election-day-arrives-in-iran-with-reformists-well-organised-to-seek-gains>
, is likely to take all of the capital’s 30 parliamentary seats, according to 
the latest tally released by the interior ministry, in surprising results seen 
as a strong vote of confidence in Rouhani’s moderate agenda. Mohammad Reza 
Aref, a committed reformist who has a degree from Stanford University in the 
US, is at the top of the list.

Preliminary results for the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for 
appointing the next supreme leader, showed Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, 
a key Rouhani ally, leading the race. Elections to the assembly are usually a 
lacklustre event but have attracted huge attention this time because of the age 
of the current leader, 76-year-oldAyatollah Ali Khamenei

Results may not be finalised until Tuesday but if they tally with the initial 
figures there will be a palpable change in the Iranian political landscape with 
moderates dominating the scene and hardliners being pushed back to the fringes. 
Strong gains by supporters of Rouhani could help promote greater opening to the 
west byIran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> and limit political 
advances by conservatives at home – and secure him a second term in office next 
year.

As many as 20 women are expected to win parliamentary seats, a record for 
Iran. Among them is the reformist candidate Parvaneh Salahshori, who said in a 
recent foreign media interview that women should have a choice to wear the 
hijab. The issue is a taboo subject in the Islamic Republic.

Although none of the competing factions would win a majority in the 290-seat 
majlis (parliament), a combination of reformist-backed candidates, including 
some moderate conservatives and independents allied with Rouhani, are expected 
to outnumber conservatives.

Rouhani said on Twitter that he was holding his head high, adding that the big 
turnout had created “a new atmosphere” in the country.

A Twitter account believed to be run by Rafsanjani’s office quoted him as 
saying that no one could resist the will of the people. “Those not favoured by 
the people should leave,” it said.

Rafsanjani was later quoted by the state IRNA news agency as calling for 
national unity. “The competition is over and the phase of unity and cooperation 
has arrived,” he said. “The time after elections is the time for hard work to 
build the country.”

The reformists have the upper hand not because they have more candidates 
entering the parliament – many were disqualified from running – but because of 
alliances with successful candidates from other camps.

Among those backed by reformists is Ali Motahari, who is culturally 
conservative but politically allied with moderates. He is in second place in 
Tehran for a parliamentary seat, just after Aref. Another conservative figure 
seen as sympathetic to Rouhani is Ali Larijani, the current speaker, who is on 
course to win in Qom, a city of religious shrines that has long been a 
conservative bastion.

Broader support in parliament would strengthen Rouhani’s hand, However, key 
strategic decisions, such as Iran’s involvement in the Syrian conflict, still 
rest with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the ultimate power under Iran’s 
hybrid political system.

The reformists’ victory is a credit to Mohammad Khatami, the former president 
seen as the ultimate leader of the country’s reformist movement. Khatami has 
faced huge restrictions on his movement and activities in recent years but is 
leading from behind the scenes.

The Iranian media is banned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/17/iranian-media-banned-from-mentioning-mohammad-khatami>
 from mentioning his name or publishing his photograph. Khatami released a 
video online early in the campaign period urging political activists to unite 
behind “the list of hope”.

His call for support helped create huge momentum and the main opposition 
leader, who is under house arrest, and a number of prominent political 
prisoners also sent messages asking people to vote for the list.

The candidates who appear to have lost seats in both political bodies are as 
revealing as those who are set to win. Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, a hardliner 
close to Khamenei, whose name topped the list of “principalist” candidates, is 
on course to lose his seat in the parliament. In the race for the assembly, at 
least two ultra-conservative ayatollahs, Mohammad-Taghi Mesbah Yazdi and 
Mohammad Yazdi, the current chairman, are set to lose.

The elections were the first since Iran’s landmark nuclear agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-programme-world-powers-historic-deal-lift-sanctions>
 last summer and thelifting of sanctions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal>
 in mid-January. The short and carefully controlled campaign – marked by the 
prior disqualification of hundreds of candidates – was dominated by the state 
of the economy, which has improved in recent months though few tangible gains 
have trickled down to ordinary people.

“The reformists and moderates have managed to take at least a third of the 
seats,” said Sadegh Zibakalam, professor of politics at Tehran University. 
Rafsanjani’s success in the assembly was extremely important. “We can’t say 
that the ultra-conservatives were defeated, but the conservatives can’t say 
they received a huge mandate,” he added.

The precise shape of the next parliament will take time to emerge. Because so 
many reformists and independents were disqualified, many candidates are unknown 
to the public and party lines and affiliations have become blurred, with some 
powerful conservative figures now backing Rouhani.


“Some of them are like watermelons,” said Saeed Laylaz, a reformist political 
commentator. “Until you open them up you don’t know what’s inside.”
