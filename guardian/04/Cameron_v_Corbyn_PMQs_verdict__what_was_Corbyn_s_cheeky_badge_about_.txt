Key points


Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> stuck to 
one subject this week – housing, prompted by an email from “Rosie”.


Corbyn attacked Cameron on the Tories’ record on social housing, saying that 
only one home had been built for every eight sold under his government.

He quoted the housing charity Shelter, which estimates 180,000 affordable 
homes will be lost in coming years.


Cameron said his government has built more council homes than Labour, and said 
the Conservatives would ensure two homes were built in London for every one 
sold.


The prime minister argued that a strong economy would allow more people to buy 
their own homes.

Snap verdict

The housing crisis, especially in London, probably goes quite some way to 
explaining why Jeremy Corbyn’s politics are so popular with some young people, 
but he never quite nailed it in this exchange.

His last two questions were the best, when he forcefully deployed the Shelter 
figures and allowed himself to sound passionate and angry, and at this point 
Cameron was on the defence. But, generally, Cameron made a pretty good fist of 
defending his record. Instead of constantly trying to change the subject to the 
economy, he engaged properly with Corbyn’s questions. Corbyn’s first, open 
question allowed Cameron to give a mini-broadcast on his housing policies, and 
quite cleverly he kept going back to “Rosie” to explain the impact of 
government initiatives in personalised terms.

Best lines

It was a substantive exchange on both sides, without any fireworks. 

Cameron’s best line of attack was on Labour’s record: 

In the last five years we built more council houses than they built in 30 
years. Where was he when that was going on? 13 years and an absolutely hopeless 
record on housing.

Corbyn was at his best when he was most passionate:

Shelter found that six out of 10 renters had problems such as damp, mould and 
leaking roofs. It’s simply not good enough ... When is the prime minster going 
to realise that there’s a housing crisis in Britain and his government needs to 
address it now?
