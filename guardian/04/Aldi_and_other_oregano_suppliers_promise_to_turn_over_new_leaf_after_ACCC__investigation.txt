Aldi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi> supermarkets and other 
Australian oregano suppliers misrepresented their sales of the herb and have 
committed to turning over a new leaf to Australia’s consumer watchdog.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Wednesday announced it 
had accepted 
<http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-acts-on-%E2%80%98oregano%E2%80%99-misrepresentations>
 enforceable undertakings fromAldi Foods 
<http://registers.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/1199561> and Menora 
Foods <http://registers.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/1199562> over 
their oregano supplies.

The ACCC initiated their probe after an investigation by the consumer advocacy 
group Choice 
<https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/groceries/herbs-and-spices/articles/oregano-fraud>
 found that a number of oregano products in supermarkets contained other types 
of leaves and herbs, and were not 100% oregano based. The test results 
undertaken by Choice showed that olive leaves were present in products by both 
suppliers.

The ACCC accepted undertakings from both suppliers that require them to make 
changes to how they market and determine the authenticity of oregano products.

“By labelling their products as ‘oregano’, both Aldi and Menora represented to 
consumers that their products contained only oregano,” the ACCC chairman, Rod 
Sims, said. “Test results provided to the ACCC identified the substantial 
presence of olive leaves in both Aldi and Menora’s oregano products.

“Suppliers of food products have an obligation to ensure ingredients of their 
products are accurately labelled and should be able to substantiate any 
representations made on the packaging that they approve.”

A number of other suppliers agreed to take greater steps to confirm the 
authenticity of their oregano supplies.

The ACCC’s oregano crackdown continues.
