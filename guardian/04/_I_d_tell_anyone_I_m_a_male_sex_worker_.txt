In some very poor areas of Andhra Pradesh up to half of the men who have sex 
with men are commercial sex workers. SN Babu has been empowered by his CBO in 
Madanpalle, Andhra Pradesh, to protect himself and others from HIV.

 "I can go anywhere and tell anyone I'm a kothi and a sex worker," says 40- 
year-old Babu, dressed in the CBOs blue shirt and black trousers.

"After joining this project I got confidence. I have attended conferences on a 
national level and I know how to talk to people.

"Without a condom I won't have sex. Even if my boss came for sex without a 
condom I'd say no!"

At outdoor hotspots male sex workers earn around 30 rupees [35p] for anal sex 
and 50 rupees [60p] for oral sex, but they can earn 100 rupees or more for 
unprotected anal sex.

"Once a day someone will offer me much more money to do it without a condom," 
Babu says. "But I say no and explain to them why they should use protection."

To resist the temptation to take the extra money, male sex workers need to be 
very clear about the risk of HIV, and to have the continuous support of their 
community.

As an outreach worker, Babu meets men who have sex with men at local hotspots 
daily. He talks to them about any problems they have, distributes condoms and 
lubricant, and reminds them of the risk of HIV.

His family is very proud of his work. "I have learned a lot here," he says. "I 
want to disseminate it to other people."
