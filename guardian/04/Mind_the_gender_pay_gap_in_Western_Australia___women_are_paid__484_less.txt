figures show.

There’s a $483.80 per week gap between full-time, seasonally adjusted earnings 
of men and women in resources-rich WA, where both genders earn the nation’s 
highest wages.

The next worst state for the gender pay gap is New South Wales, with a $316.60 
per week difference.

Pay is fairest in South Australia, which has a gap of only $151.20. And while 
Tasmanian women pocket the nation’s most modest weekly sum at $1,187.30, the 
gender difference is only $159.60.

Unions WA secretary Meredith Hammat said it was inequitable and wrong that WA 
women earned 25% less than men.

“When women take on caring roles, the pay gap can be entrenched for the rest 
of their lives, including into retirement through lower superannuation,” Hammat 
said.

“This means women are more likely to be financially insecure. Women are more 
likely than men to have to meet family costs of living that are already high in 
WA.”

She called on governments and employers to do more to support women in the 
workforce and assist with the costs of caring.

“Stronger measures are needed to address pregnancy discrimination in the 
workplace, whether it’s losing permanency after returning from maternity leave 
or employers refusing requests to work flexible hours.”
