Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday, former Federal Reserve 
chairman Alan Greenspan <http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100915/ts_nm/us_greenspan>
 – regarded by many, because of his policy of holding down interest rates, as 
the architect both of the long boom of the late nineties and early noughties 
and the ultimate bust of 2007 – entered the debate on the deficit, stimulus 
spending and, most arrestingly, taxes.

Against the background of a political dialogue in Washington over the end of 
the Bush era tax cuts for the wealthy and anemerging possible consensus over 
tax cuts for average earners 
<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100915/ap_on_bi_ge/us_tax_cuts>, Greenspan was 
unequivocal:

"I am in favour for the first time in my memory of raising taxes… I would love 
to see taxes go down, and I would hope that what we would do is we allow the 
tax cuts, theso-called Bush tax cuts 
<http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Bush-Tax-Cuts-Not-Important-cnbc-1152867279.html?x=0&.v=1>
, all to lapse as they will… on 31 December and then gradually bring the level 
of expenditure down."

In other words, reducing the deficit is the priority – and taxes should go up 
to achieve that. "We should not have tax cuts with borrowed money," Greenspan 
went on, warning of "very grave problems" if we do otherwise.

What do you think: is Greenspan right that the most important thing now is to 
get the $1tn deficit down? Or should the government give middle-class Americans 
a break and help the economy recover by putting some money back in their 
pockets?
