The Magners League <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnersleague> will be 
expanded to 12 teams next season to include two Italian "super sides", Celtic 
Rugby announced this afternoon. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions agreed 
unanimously that Benetton Treviso and Aironi Rugby should join the competition 
as part of a four-year agreement. The decision ends a year-long study into the 
viability of expanding the competition.

David Jordan, director of Celtic Rugby, said: "This is another massive step 
forward for the Magners League. As well as providing more fixtures for the 
teams already involved this will also bring both a major cash injection into 
the competition and greater exposure across Europe.

"Operationally it will present new challenges, as well as opportunities, but 
by introducing Italy into the Celtic fold it will also dramatically broaden the 
appeal of our product. It is anticipated that the Italian super clubs will be 
largely made up of Italian internationals of full, A and Under-20 levels, with 
a sprinkling of top-class overseas players set to provide further extra 
strength and spice to the tournament."

Aironi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/aironi> Rugby, which translates as 
Heron in English, will be comprised of players from Viadana, Rugby Parma, Gran 
Parma, Colorno, Noceto, Reggio Emilia, Modena and Mantova.

Giancarlo Dondi, president of Federazione Italiana Rugby, said: "I am very 
pleased that after months of intense negotiations an agreement that will see 
two Italian teams join the Magners League has been reached. I am sure that the 
Magners League will bring benefits to all Italian rugby and will have a 
positive impact on the competitiveness of our national team."
