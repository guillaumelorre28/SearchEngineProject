Franklin Boutique Hotel
 The Franklin Hotel, Adelaide 
Salvaged interior features? Check. Artworks from local artists? Check. Wood 
panelling and stripped-back brickwork? Check. Yes, the Franklin is the hip, new 
option in Adelaide, a much-needed meeting of demand for twee-free 
accommodation. The basic ("deluxe") rooms are small but so stylish that you 
won't mind; pay more for bigger bathrooms and more inventive lighting in the 
premium and superior rooms. Decor is also sleekly creative in the public areas, 
though having South Australia's (excellent) Coopers ale on tap isn't breaking 
any conventions in these parts. Both the city's central food market and the 
Sunday farmers' market at the Showground are a stroll away via jacaranda-lined 
streets.

Athelney Cottage B&B
 Athelney Cottage B&B, Adelaide 
There's a Mediterranean air to Adelaide, especially when the Adelaide Festival 
comes to the city's streets and parks in February and March. Rosie Begg's B&B 
continues the continental theme with its touches of French country style. Lying 
north-east of Adelaide's CBD, close to the Botanic Gardens and the National 
Wine Centre of Australia, this prettily furnished, self-contained studio has a 
fully equipped kitchen and its own private courtyard for alfresco dining.

<http://www.athelneycottage.com.au/>. Studio from A$185 (£100) a night, with 
king-size bed; sofabeds and cots also available

Glenelg Beach Hostel

Pack your bathers for a stay at this beautiful, historic backpackers in the 
southern suburb of Glenelg. It occupies a 19th-century terrace – complete with 
lattice ironwork – a couple of blocks from the beach and offers swish dorms 
(including women-only rooms), singles, doubles and family rooms. With a popular 
bar and weekend DJs, barbecues in the summer and welcoming fireplaces in the 
winter, there's a holiday buzz about the place.
• 1-7 Moseley Street, Glenelg, +61 8 8376 0007, glenelgbeachhostel.com.au 
<http://glenelgbeachhostel.com.au/>. Dorms from A$24 (£13), doubles from A$70 
(£37.50)

Princes Lodge
 Princes Lodge Motel, Adelaide 
Adelaide is bisected east to west by the river Torrens. Parkland surrounds the 
river; to the south lies the CBD; to the north is a grid of wide, leafy streets 
with solid stone houses. The friendly and characterful Princes Lodge Motel – 
from the whitewashed exterior more grand than the total on the bill might 
suggest – is an affordable option in North Adelaide, close to local shops and 
restaurants but within walking distance (downhill, one way at least) of the 
city centre's attractions. Inside, the feel is functional rather than 
fashionable, but it's clean, tidy and spacious.
• 73 LeFevre Terrace, North Adelaide, +61 8 8267 5566, princeslodge.com.au 
<http://princeslodge.com.au/>. Doubles from A$85 (£45), including buffet 
continental breakfast

O'Connell Inn

With Adelaide's dearth of desirable motels, the family-owned O'Connell Inn 
charges a fair price for its above-average units. Styling is relatively 
contemporary, the rooms are quiet and there's free Wi-Fi and parking, which 
ticks a lot of boxes for roadtrippers moving onward to the Barossa Valley and 
Flinders Range.
• 197 O'Connell Street, North Adelaide, +61 8 8239 0766, oconnellinn.com.au 
<http://oconnellinn.com.au/>. Doubles from A$150 (£80)

Largs Pier Hotel
 Largs Pier Hotel, Adelaide 
The legendary Largs Pier Hotel is something of a landmark on Largs Bay, a 
30-minute drive from the city centre. That's largely thanks to the building, a 
130-year-old confection of colonial columns and arches, but it's also because 
the hotel is the neighbourhood's social hub. In its time the bar has bounced to 
the sounds of Aussie rockers AC/DC and Cold Chisel; the present-day Sunday 
afternoon live music sessions are more laid-back. Thankfully the decor has also 
moved with the times and is tastefully subdued. When the ocean views are this 
good, who needs frills? Choose between the newer motel rooms or the traditional 
heritage hotel building, which has been impressively restored.
• 198 Esplanade, Largs Bay, +61 8 8449 5666, largspierhotel.com.au 
<http://largspierhotel.com.au/>. Queen-size double rooms in the hotel and motel 
rooms from $164 (£88); two-bedroom apartments with kitchen, lounge and bathroom 
from A$199 (£106)

Peppermint Farm Cottage
 Peppermint Farm Cottage, Adelaide 
There are four world-class wine regions around Adelaide. McLaren Vale, to the 
south, has a wide range of reds, thanks to warm days and nights cooled by a sea 
breeze. And Paul and Diane Witt's Peppermint Farm Cottage is in the heart of 
wine country –Wirra Wirra winery <http://wirrawirra.com/default.aspx> is a 
15-minute walk from the front door. Restored by owners who appreciate the 
difference between cosiness and clutter, this beautifully restored 1853 
settlers' cottage has two bedrooms, an expansive bathroom and a well-equipped 
kitchen.
• 148 Strout Road, Mclaren Vale, +61 417 816 475, pfcbandb.com.au 
<http://pfcbandb.com.au/>. From A$195 a night midweek (£105), provisions 
supplied for breakfast

Clare Valley Motel
 Clare Valley Motel, Adelaide 
If you prefer white wine (and particularly a crisp riesling), it's worth 
driving the extra 30 minutes beyond the Barossa to Clare Valley; it's higher, 
cooler and greener, with cellar doors tucked away down quiet eucalypt-lined 
roads. Clare Valley Motel is an affordable base for a weekend away among the 
vines. It has been renovated by owners Lee and Jan Stokes, but retains the 
quaint vibe of a traditional country motel.
• 74a Main North Road, Clare, +61 8 8842 2799, clarevalleymotel.com.au 
<http://www.clarevalleymotel.com.au/>. Queen-size doubles from A$115 (£62)

Amble at Hahndorf
 Amble at Hahndorf, Adelaide 
Easy-living Adelaide could never be accused of being a concrete jungle – but 
when the green streets get too much, locals and visitors head to Adelaide 
Hills, just 30 minutes south-east of the CBD. Up here, among the vines and gum 
trees, lies Australia's oldest German settlement, Hahndorf (as South 
Australians sometimes mention, the state was colonised by free settlers). The 
best options for a weekend tasting the local food and wine can be found at 
Amble's base in Hahndorf; there's the Fern studio, the Wren cottage and an 
apartment (Amble Over). In all three, the cosy, country style is perfect for 
couples. Wren features a spa bathroom and private deck; Fern a private 
courtyard with barbecue.
• 10 Hereford Avenue, Hahndorf, +61 408 105 610, amble-at-hahndorf.com.au 
<http://amble-at-hahndorf.com.au>. Double from A$130pn (£70) for a two-night 
stay, locally sourced breakfast goods are provided

Adelaide YHA 
 Adelaide YHA 
What the slightly staid YHA has in its favour are clean, spacious rooms, 
plenty of bathrooms, a large and characteristically well-organised kitchen 
(complete with lounge area overlooking Light Square) – and a convenient western 
CBD location equidistant between the peaceful waterfront walks along the river 
Torrens and the nightlife of Gouger Street. Security is typically tight and 
there's the mix of age groups that you'd expect in a YHA – party people, this 
is not the hostel you seek. Bicycles can be hired for free fromBicycles SA 
<http://www.bikesa.asn.au/>, just around the corner on Franklin Street. Parking 
is A$10 (£5).
• 135 Waymouth Street, +61 8 8414 3010, yha.com.au <http://www3.yha.com.au/>. 
From A$29 (£15) for a dorm; double room without bathroom A$79 (£42)
