For the 12th Day Of Christmas Domino Records sent to us ... a playlist to help 
us get through tomorrow's journey into work. 
<http://open.spotify.com/user/dominorecords/playlist/4boFXZQYM6JrhThHWPoARp> We 
hope it comes in useful. Here's what the label had to say ...

Commuting into work is usually about as much as fun having your teeth pulled. 
Domino wants to ease your pain so we've compiled two playlists full of songs by 
assorted Domino artists, timed to last 45 minutes each which is the average UK 
commute time (and the longest commute time mainland Europe ever experiences, 
which is bound to leave a sour taste in the mouths of us Brits).

The playlists have basically been devised in a somewhat "day and night" 
fashion. Thefirst playlist 
<http://open.spotify.com/user/dominorecords/playlist/4boFXZQYM6JrhThHWPoARp> 
functions as a soundtrack to the morning commute, when the sun feels like an 
enemy and the newspaper is full of depressing stories that seem designed to 
make you want to reach for the bottle. In a bid to put some kind of a smile on 
people's faces we've selected some of Domino's mellower, hazier, more 
optimistic songs from artists such as Magnetic Fields, Stephen Malkmus and Four 
Tet."

You can catch Domino's playlist for the journey home from work tomorrow!
