Take me there: Ramsgate, Kent

Why go?
Much has been made of Margate’s regeneration but, just a few miles along the 
coast, Ramsgate has been quietly reinventing itself, without fuss or fanfare. 
After a few years in the doldrums, the character of this port town with its 
fascinating maritime heritage and fine Regency architecture is now being shaped 
by a creative community of musicians and artists, many of whom have relocated 
from London and Brighton. The opening this month of a stylish new hotel on the 
seafront will only enhance Ramsgate’s appeal as an offbeat weekend destination.

What to do
The heart and soul of the town is the Royal harbour complete with obelisk, 
Georgian lighthouse, lifeboat station and yacht marina. Don’t miss the 
beautiful sailors’ church with its collection of model ships and port and 
starboard lights above the altar. Take a boat trip to spot seals onGoodwin Sands
 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Sands> or walk the coast path to 
Broadstairs orPegwell Bay Country Park 
<http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/parks-and-outdoor-activities/find-a-park/pegwell-bay-country-park>
.

Where to eat
The Royal Harbour Brasserie, situated at the end of the harbour wall, has 
unmatched views of the marina and a working coastguard station on its roof (
royalharbourbrasserie.co.uk <http://royalharbourbrasserie.co.uk/>). Flavours by 
Kumar (flavoursbykumar.co.uk <http://flavoursbykumar.co.uk/>), just up from the 
seafront, serves up some of the tastiest Indian food in the southeast.

Where to stay
Almost every room has a sea view at Albion House, a beautiful new boutique 
hotel which has just opened in a Georgian house on Ramsgate’s East Cliff 
(doubles from £132,albionhouseramsgate.co.uk
