 Expansive imagination … The Pajama Men. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the 
Guardian 
Their brand of two-person, multi-character, semi-improvised adventures – 
distinguished by expansive imagination and fluid performing talent – has seldom 
been attempted, far less equalled, elsewhere. In 2015, their 2 Man 3 Musketeers 
was far from their best work, but it should have sharpened up by now – and in 
any case, second-tier Pajama Men is still first-rate comedy.

The Boy with Tape on His Face

At time of writing, Kiwi street performer Sam Wills’ mime act was preparing 
for the semi-finals of America’s Got Talent. Regardless of the outcome, Wills 
is hitting the UK from September with a show featuring best-of moments from the 
oeuvre of hiswell-loved alter ego 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/26/sam-wills-boy-with-tape-comedy> 
– a wide-eyed Buster Keaton-alike with gaffer tape across his mouth, making 
very funny things happen with props, audience members and a soundtrack of 
popular songs.

Some good comics do a familiar thing well; the best do something no one else 
does. In the latter category, James Acaster now tours the latest in a 
high-quality series of shows, in which he beadily overthinks the most 
microscopically trivial of subjects. In this year’s show,Reset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/09/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-gags-pleasance-courtyard>
, he also explores the idea of starting life over, after he’s offered a place 
on a witness-protection programme having dobbed in his accomplices in a 
honey-selling scam.

Hans Teeuwen

No one who saw the demented absurdist Hans Teeuwen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/24/theatre> during his brief period 
gigging in the UK will ever forget it. Bridget Christie calls him“the gold 
standard [and] the comedian I most admire” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/11/bridget-christie-hans-teeuwen-comedy-hero>
. Now – after six years away, and an abortive relaunch as a lounge singer – the 
demonic Dutchman is back with another nugget of anything-goes, deeply 
destabilising comedy.

Sam Simmons

Popping up on panel shows, co-starring in Mark Watson’s new Radio 4 series and 
now embarking on a nationwide tour, belligerent Aussie weirdo Sam Simmons is an 
ever more prominent feature of UK comedy. Not a People Person reportedly

more confessional effort

Josie Long

For the first time since her 2014 show Cara Josephine, Josie Long launches a 
new standup set – after a preview run in Edinburgh. That last show detoured 
from the political material that made her work so compelling since the Tories 
came to power, but was every bit as funny and heartfelt. Its follow-up, 
Something Better, looks likely to combine personal and political, and addresses 
her experience, at 34, of “really feeling like an outsider for the first time”.

familiar with her joyful but highly strung comedy. Ward’s mental health 
features less prominently in this year’s show, 50% More Likely to Die, 
reportedly another expansive, gleeful hour about her family, her new life in 
the UK, and, er, performing karaoke as a chicken.
