Artful Spark <https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/artful-spark-tickets-19937529688> 
is a quarterly event series all about the gap between creative ideas and 
technical execution. In the words of its founders – Sam Howey Nunn, director of
Stellar Network <http://www.stellarnetwork.com/>, and Ben Templeton, founder of 
Thought Den <http://www.thoughtden.co.uk/> and associate creative director at 
Preloaded <http://preloaded.com/> – the project aims to support more informed, 
creative, cross-discipline conversations around the vast wealth of 
possibilities presented by emerging technology.

Here, speakers past and present share what they think will be the key trends 
in arts, culture, creativity and technology in 2016.

Going mainstream: creativity combined with tech
This year prepare to see creativity combined with tech becoming more 
mainstream. Everyone will be doing it. While 2015 has seen the celebration of 
engagement in Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) this 
year it will be all about engagement in Steam (the A is for arts).


The UK has the ultimate Steam figurehead in Ada Lovelace 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace>. She published the first complex 
computer programme for a system that didn’t even exist and predicted that 
computers would become tools of human imagination. What’s more, she did all 
this in 1843, so what better inspiration for the year ahead than this Steam 
champion?

The rise of electronic and reactive textiles
The main challenge of the near future is the industrialisation of electronic 
textiles production. In the past 10 years we have seen a lot of research from 
both engineering and design related to the integration of electronic components 
into textile structures and the development of conductive and reactive textile 
materials.

With projects such as Google’s Jacquard 
<https://www.google.com/atap/project-jacquard/>, we’ll find ourselves on a new 
stage in 2016 – the industrial production of electronic textiles. Google’s 
project is certainly not inventive, but it creates the conditions of being 
innovative. For the moment, it’s media hype, but definitely worth keeping an 
eye on.

More making
For this next year in arts and technology we will see a continued growth in 
maker culture. That will include more devices and processes that attempt to 
bring a wider range of participants into the making of art, and that enable 
artists to cross over into areas that they might not have explored before.

One of the most prominent examples of this is 3D printing. We’ll also continue 
to see the trend towards making as an ongoing, exploratory and communal 
process, having ephemeral products, rather than as the creation of fixed works 
of art as individual expressions.

Artists and storytellers turn to personal data
A big theme this year will be the use of data to provide personalised content 
experiences, going beyond recommendation systems and adapting narrative in 
response to audiences. As marketers learn to harness the power of personal data 
to encourage us to buy more stuff, artists and storytellers will develop skills 
needed to use personal data to provide more contextual and personalised 
experiences. Hopefully this will also result in greater public understanding of 
what personal data is held (or can be detected) by organisations, who owns it 
and how it is being used.

For personal data to provide more engaging experiences, art and storytelling 
themselves must become more flexible. We need to stop seeing art as sacrosanct, 
as artists and storytellers develop new tools and processes that allow the 
generation of adaptable user experiences that change in response to personal 
data.

In 2016 we will see green architecture, intelligent buildings and even smart 
cities.

DIY electronics and creative coding
For me, the most exciting trend is the continuing rise of DIY electronics and 
creative coding. On the fringes, things are as noisy and glitchy as ever, with 
hubs of experimentation such asMusic Hackspace <http://musichackspace.org/> and 
Cafe Oto <https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/> in London. In 2016 we will see more of 
the kind of work produced by artists such asEwa Justka 
<http://ewajustka.tumblr.com/>, Leafcutter John <http://leafcutterjohn.com/> and
Tasos Stamou <https://tasosstamou.wordpress.com/>, who perform with homemade 
analogue synthesisers and live circuit bending, physically modifying electronic 
device circuits to make them produce sounds beyond their designer’s intentions.

While creative coding continues to weave into more traditional a such as 
sculpture, theatre and dance, I think the novelty of interactive technology is 
starting to wear off for audiences. That’s no bad thing. As we demand more than 
gimmicks from the medium, interactive installations such as Zach Lieberman’s
Play The World <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYJn27Suwg> and Golan Levin’s 
Double-Taker <https://vimeo.com/3793505> remind us of the poetic possibilities 
of interactive digital art.

Cities take centre stage
We live in a world of megacities, where urbanisation is a fast-growing fact of 
life. In 2016 we will see trends such as urban farming, local food growing 
initiatives, green architecture, intelligent buildings and even smart cities. 
In today’s automated world, digital and playful art projects contribute to 
debates about the design and implementation of interactive, smart environments, 
including cities. What will the cities of the future look like? Will they allow 
playful interaction (quirky, imaginative behaviour and flexibility) or are we 
developing smart cities with visions of efficiency and safety above all else? 
These are the questions we’ll be answering this year.

As new technologies emerge, different ways to creatively interact and 
collaborate arise with them. In this context, play is a persuasive and powerful 
tool. The invitation to play can bridge the gap from observation to 
participating and, as such, playable spaces have the potential to provide a 
deeply social dimension. Key, however, will be how we ensure these playful 
interactions are not about our relation to technology, but about creating new 
ways of experiencing culture.
