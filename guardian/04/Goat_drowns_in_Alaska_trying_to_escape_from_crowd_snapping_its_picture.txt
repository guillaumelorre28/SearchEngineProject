A mountain goat in Alaska <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska> jumped 
into the ocean to get away from crowds snapping its picture, and the animal 
drowned when it couldn’t get back to land because of the crush of people on 
shore, troopers said.

Alaska state troopers said it was imperative to give animals adequate space. 
That didn’t happen on Saturday in downtown Seward, and troopers said in an 
online post that it “resulted in a wild animal dying for no cause”.

It comes amid a series of incidents of people getting too close to wildlife, 
including tourists in Yellowstone national park, who picked up a bison calf 
they thought was abandoned.It had to be euthanized

.

In Alaska, troopers got a call about people harassing the goat and another 
about a large group following it on to the breakwater rocks.
