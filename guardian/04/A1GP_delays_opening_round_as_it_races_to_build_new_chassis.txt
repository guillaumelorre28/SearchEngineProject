A1GP <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/a1gp> has postponed the opening round 
of its 2008/09 championship due to a delay in building its new chassis.

The series, which switches to Ferrari engines this year, was due to begin at 
the Italian Mugello circuit on 20-21 September but will now start from 
Zandvoort, in the Netherlands, on 4-5 October.

"It was always going to be an optimistic programme but we were confident we 
could achieve it," said A1GP chief executive officer, Pete da Silva. "This in 
no way reflects on the work undertaken by the technical team and our partners, 
as it was due to circumstances beyond their control. I also want to thank all 
our technical partners for their support during our intensive testing 
programme, and especially Ferrari for the supply of engines."

The car was tested at Silverstone last week, with organisers saying it was two 
seconds quicker than last year's machine.
