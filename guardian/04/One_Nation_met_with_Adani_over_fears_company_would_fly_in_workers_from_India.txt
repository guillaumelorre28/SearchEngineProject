One Nation has met twice in recent months with representatives from the Adani 
company in an effort to satisfy concerns about the management of groundwater at 
the Carmichael coalmine and to ascertain any plans the company might have to 
fly in mine workers from India.


A spokesman for the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson

, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday the company had provided credible 
assurances about water management and had signalled the project would generate 
local employment in central Queensland, not opportunities for fly-in fly-out 
foreign workers.

Asked whether One Nation was concerned about the project from a foreign 
investment standpoint, given the party’s policy platform, Hanson’s spokesman 
said the party was concerned about foreign ownership, not foreign investment.

He said projects such as the Adani development were positive because they 
would provide cheap electricity in India, which would lift people out of 
poverty.

While sending positive signals about the project, One Nation is yet to take a 
position on whether the Turnbull government shouldprovide $1bn

 in taxpayer support to Adani via the Northern Australia Infrastructure 
Facility.

Bob Katter said on Tuesday the government should not give a foreign 
corporation “control of the coalfields” through the proposed rail line.

“Whilst we remain strong supporters of Mr Adani, for both governments to give 
the control of the coalfields to one corporation through that rail line is 
beyond belief,” Katter said.

Katter suggested the line should be financed through government investment and 
open to multiple users, not financed by a loan.

The government has confirmed this week it is considering lending $1bn towards 
a 388km railway line associated with the Carmichael mine

Gautam Adani

, in Melbourne to discuss the project.

The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said on Tuesday the opposition would welcome 
job creation if the project went ahead but he signalled Labor wasn’t interested 
in providing any taxpayer subsidies.

Shorten said the project should proceed or fail on its own commercial merits.

The proposed railway line, belonging to the group’s Carmichael rail project

, would link the Galilee Basin in Queensland to a new terminal at Abbot Point, 
where thermal coal would be shipped to India.

With unemployment a huge issue in regional Queensland, and with the Coalition 
under political pressure from rivals like One Nation, the local LNP member, 
George Christensen,has backed the $1bn loan
