The Guardian Films production 'Zimbabwe - The Stolen Ballots' has been named 
best news programme in Broadcast Magazine's annual awards. The film, broadcast 
on Guardian.co.uk and Newsnight July 4, showed secretly filmed footage of vote 
rigging in the Zimbabwean elections. The judges said the film was: "Brave and 
brilliant - an example of outstanding journalism with amazing evidence." Maggie 
O'Kane, Editorial Director of Guardian Films said: "This film wouldn't have 
been possible if it wasn't for one man's absolute determination to expose 
Mugabe's vote rigging. The person who did that, Shepherd Yudan, was prepared to 
take great personal risks to do it and we are very honoured at the Guardian to 
have been able to work with such a brave man ". The BroadcastAwards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards> recognise and reward 
excellence in a wide range of programme-making.
