Observer columnist, Nick Cohen has won the commentator category for his pieces 
on “the cowardice of Nigel Farage” in the 2015 European Press Prize (EPP).

The EPP judges, chaired by Sir Harold Evans, the Reuters editor-at-large, 
praised Cohen for his “zest, rhetoric and clear determination to tackle his 
targets straight on”.

He, like the winners of the other three categories - distinguished writing, 
investigative reporting and innovation - picked up €10,000, which must be spent 
on a new journalistic project.

The awards were announced at a ceremony on 13 April. Find out more here
