STUMPS - Pakistan 55-1 (Azhar 11, Yasir 3)

Adam Collins

Of course, Australia would have wanted a couple or more in that final hour. 
But they’ll be happy with one. It leaves nine wickets to get on the final day, 
which isn’t meant to be affected by rain. Pakistan require a further 411, so 
runs not a factor either.

Lyon got the breakthrough four overs before the close, encouraging the 
incorrigible Sharjeel Khan one too many times, flicking to Warner at midwicket. 
A poor dismissal from the debutant after he made it to 40.

So on a day where a session was lost due to rain, the home side moved the game 
as quickly as they could, wrapping up the Pakistan opening innings in an hour, 
making 241 in a couple of rapid hours at the crease, and making a breakthrough. 
Job done.

For the visitors, it will defy all expectations if they can hold on here. 
Truth told, it’s been an awful tour for them. Some positive sessions, even some 
days. But on the whole they leave well thrashed. To split the difference at 
least means they leave with something. Misbah will surely reinforce that point, 
in what may very well be his final day of international cricket tomorrow.

Let’s leave it there. From the SCG, Adam Collins signing off. Thanks for your 
company on behalf of Russell Jackson, Geoff Lemon and myself. We’ll be back 
before play tomorrow for the final day of this series with Guardian Australia’s 
over-by-over coverage. Until then, here’s your match report:

16th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Azhar 11, Yasir 3). Oooh. The first Lyon ball is 
hard spun, hits the footmarks, and runs into Azhar’s inside edge. Could have 
been out any number of ways there. He’s more convincing in defence thereafter, 
consistently getting a big stride in when full, or deep in his crease when 
back. Couple balls to go. Will Lyon make him wait? He doesn’t, Azhar good 
enough to turn it into the legside for one. So Yasir has to face the last ball. 
The slow claps begin. Smith finally joins in, making a couple of changes to the 
field. Basit Ali? Can we? Please? Nathan? Garry? No, we won’t. Good batting 
from Yasir. That’s stumps.

Back with some final thoughts shortly.

15th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 3). In the best traditions of the 
nightwatchman, Yasir can’t help himself and goes after O’Keefe’s first ball. A 
shout of catch goes up, but the ball isn’t to hand; two scored to cover. He’s 
into a more sensible groove for the rest of the over, the left-arm tweaker 
again racing through his set. Could probably do with dragging it out at this 
stage of the day, could he not? Anyway, he’s already finished. Six balls left. 
Lyon to get them. Again: good captaincy.

14th over: Pakistan 52-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 1). Starc is back to take on Yasir. 
Good captaincy if he can find the stumps. They haven’t got a good record with 
nightwatchman recently, Rahat Ali out twice in the same match before stumps 
when given the gig in England last year. Bless. I miss Rahat. His first 
delivery is down leg, as is the third - badly sprayed, with Wade saving a 
certain four byes with a well-timed dive. Then on leg-stump, he gets off strike 
with a single. Not great over from the quick, the visitors inching closer to 
the close of play.

13th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 0). Yasir has popped his head out as 
nightwatchman with three overs to go, Steve O’Keefe the ball in his hand to 
replace Hazlewood. He isn’t required as Azhar gets down the track to meet the 
spin time and again. It’s one of those 60-second overs from the left-arm 
tweaker. A maiden.

With Yasir out there batting now, he’ll be hoping to redeem what happened 
earlier.

WICKET! Sharjeel c Warner b Lyon 40 (Pakistan 51-1)

Oh bloody hell. Sharjeel, after giving a bit of hope, falls with a clip to 
midwicket. It’s such a limp way to go. Who knows what is going on there with 
four overs to stumps. “He’s going to wake up with shivers in the night thinking 
of that shot,” is the view of Dirk Nannes on radio. Couldn’t have put it 
better. Just after their 50-stand too. And the last ball of Lyon’s over.

11th over: Pakistan 45-0 (Azhar 10, Sharjeel 34). Hazlewood a bit tired this 
time around, Azhar able to drive a couple of times early in the over, then take 
an inaccurate delivery through midwicket for a couple. He finishes the over 
with a hip-high full-toss, but the batsman isn’t able to capitalise. Reckon 
we’ll see a chance from the Members’ End next over. Cartwright?

10th over: Pakistan 43-0 (Azhar 8, Sharjeel 34). Lyon far more comfortable to 
Azhar at this stage, having bowled so many overs to him through this tour. They 
poke and prod at each other. Sharjeel though, when getting his chance crunches 
a cut shot from a ball that’s short but notthat short. How’s this stat... yuk.

9th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Azhar 7, Sharjeel 30). Hazlewood keeps Sharjeel 
honest, before the plucky batsman takes a couple to deep backward square when 
he drops a fraction shorter. Half an hour to go today.

8th over: Pakistan 36-0 (Azhar 7, Sharjeel 28). Sharjeel vs Lyon, that is 
where the fun is. He gets the strike after Azhar takes a single down the 
ground. First ball? Tries to smash him inside-out over cover. Doesn’t get much 
of it, but it isjust safe. Please don’t stop.

7th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 27). Con Calma the implicit message 
from Azhar to his partner, leaving and defending Hazlewood’s next over, before 
retaining the strike with a single behind square in response to a shorter 
delivery. Good batting.

6th over: Pakistan 33-0 (Azhar 5, Sharjeel 27). Scenes! Sure, they’re chasing 
a million and probably should focus on batting for over a day to save this 
fixture, but tell my boy Sharjeel that! He first smashes the new bowler Lyon 
over his head for four after getting down the track. That’s the way to do it. 
Then to finish the over: puts him over the fence and into the crowd at long-on! 
Cop that, Garry!

this side via the white-ball route, and we’ve seen with Dave Warner this week 
that this is no longer a sledge. After leaving Starc’s early offerings he cuts 
the opener hard for one boundary and slices another behind point - albeit from 
another full toss - with the last two balls of the set.

4th over: Pakistan 12-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 7). Hazlewood doing what he does 
best, landing it in a shoebox on the fourth stump. Azhar knows the drill, 
leaving with relative ease. A maiden. This will again be a good contest. About 
16 stories online about this dab thing, I notice on the tweet. I still require 
more information.

3rd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 7). I really do hope for Sharjeel 
here. Some luck, some strokes. Something to remember fondly from his trip to 
Australia. He picks up a boundary here off Starc, through the off-side when the 
Aussie opener overpitches again. But he’s bowling quick, so when he gets his 
radar right he’ll be a bother.

2nd over: Pakistan 8-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 3). An edge from Sharjeel allows 
Smith to pull out a wonderful chase/dive/flick combo back to Hanscomb. Very 
clever, skipper. He got three for it and t three for it and survived the over, 
so fair play to him. Some grim Sharjeel news on the radio, Ali Mitchell 
reporting that his pink baggy cap is only going for $9 at auction. Go on, 
someone from the OBO community needs to grab that. “Yasir’s is dropping in 
value,” adds Mitchell with a laugh. True story.

Okay, so Usman Khawaja celebrated his half-century with a ‘dab’ earlier on and 
the world wide web is exploding about it. Must say, I’m not across this. 
Someone want to have a crack explaining what the deal is for the rest of us?

1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 0). Well, Starc begins with a 
full-toss. Thankfully it’s a long way from Azhar’s body and no damage done. 
He’s attacking the stumps throughout, or at least trying to do so. When too 
full a boundary is struck behind point by the in-form opener. Good batting.

A bold call from a press box colleague between overs. But I’m probably with 
him.

Some odds and ends off the email while we wait for Mitch.

Rohan O’Farrell wants to know how far Viv would have hit the ball with Dave 
Warner’s bat. Me too.

Gavin Robertson has written back to confirm he isn’t the same bloke. And he’s 
from Scotland, so he hates me for showing that clip of Gazza being a genius in 
Euro ‘96. Onya, Gav.

Yum on the email wonders about the earlier Smith dismissal if snicko should be 
given the benefit of the doubt instead of the batsman in that situation. He 
says there’s no way you can be sure that he nicked it.

What do you think of this

DECLARATION! Australia 241-2

465 will be what Pakistan require to win. Just as drinks came out, Steve Smith 
called them in. What a punishing innings for the visitors, a fitting way to end 
their disappointing tour with the ball for the most part. What a mess.

David Warner made the second fastest half-century in the history of Test 
cricket to begin the show. As he does. He finished with 55 from 27 balls. Steve 
Smith’s 59 took just 43, positively pedestrian compared to his deputy. 
Meanwhile, Usman Khawaja batted through the innings for 79 not out.

99.75 is the career batting average Pete Handscomb now sports when walking off 
the ground, his contribution today an unbeaten 40 from 25 balls, doing largely 
as he pleased to the Pakistan spinners.

Their frontliner Yasir Shah was the best bowler in the world six months ago, 
both by reputation and ICC ranking. He was a modern-day Shane Warne at Lord’s 
when spinning Pakistan to victory there. Today he had 124 runs taken from 14 
overs. It was hard to watch.

Oh, and attack-leader Mohammad Amir picked up a side injury along the way as 
well. He’ll miss the next week or so. I’ll say it again: what a mess. They’re 
innings begins in a few minutes. Can they survive 16 overs tonight and 98 
tomorrow? Draw your own conclusions.

32nd over: Australia 241-2 (Khawaja 79, Handscomb 40). 19 overs to come today. 
Azhar has another crack in the last of those before the drinks break. It’s less 
punishing than the handful that have came before it, only singles. He even did 
Khawaja with a googly. The edge doesn’t go to hand, mind.

31st over: Australia 236-2 (Khawaja 76, Handscomb 38). Another over of 
Handscomb fun, Yasir smashed to cow corner for the umpteenth time in this spell 
early in the set, then cut with panache to finish it off. Some gloves or a 
drink are ran out between overs, reinforcing that a declaration has to be 
close. Lead is 459 and Australia have made an even 100 in the last ten overs.

30th over: Australia 224-2 (Khawaja 75, Handscomb 27). Sorry for being tardy 
with your correspondence, but this is basically a T20 effort now. The 50 stand 
is up between these two when Khawaja ends Azhar’s over by helping it around the 
corner for four. It’s no good. Earlier in the set Handscomb flogged him to the 
midwicket rope after charging, almost by default.Gold coin entry to the SCG 
tomorrow. That’s good areas from CA, the money going to the McGrath Foundation. 
Nice job. Come on, Sydney.

Meanwhile, Handscomb needs seven more runs to have a 100 average, provided he 
remains not out, Ric Finlay relays. Sure.

29th over: Australia 212-2 (Khawaja 69, Handscomb 21). The 200 up as Handscomb 
scores a boundary off Yasir. It’s an edge and pretty good bowling to deceive 
the dancing batsman, but four all the same. More convincing is Khawaja when he 
gets his chance, jumping even further down the track and launching the leggie 
into the Brewongle Stand. Handscomb continues to theme down the wicket for two 
more. Declare? Not yet. Yasir has 1-112 from 13 overs.

An email from Gavin Robertson. I sure hope it is *the* Gavin Robertson? Who 
knows. Tell me, Robbo? “I think only Freddie Flintoff can play Gazza in the 
cricketing remake of the other round ball game.”

Can he do this? Any excuse.

28th over: Australia 198-2 (Khawaja 62, Handscomb 14). “How many is enough?” 
wonders Dirk Nannes as the lead goes beyond 420. Handscomb picks up a couple, 
then a couple more, to the sweepers. Nothing to see here. Surely they’re 
bowling shortly.

27th over: Australia 191-2 (Khawaja 61, Handscomb 7). Imran completely 
misjudges Khawaja’s pull from a Yasir half-tracker. He nearly falls over the 
ball, but recovers with a one-handed reach. Points for the degree of 
difficulty. Some news: Amir won’t be available to bowl, has hurt a side muscle. 
Out for a few days but back for the first ODI next Friday is the report. Ones 
and twos for the rest of the over, some of the easiest Test runs you’ll ever 
see.

Andrew James on the email talking Renshaw. “Given the recent tragedy, as well 
as my own embarrassing experience keeping at club level when the ball missed 
the glove and clocked me at windpipe level, I’d say give the players every 
chance to take it easy. It’s a lot faster at 150km/h than you expect - just ask 
Piers Morgan.”

My take: it will be unsustainable for the ICC not to agree to the concussion 
substitutions. You need to take these decisions out of the hands of cricket 
people. That’s what happened here, to the credit of Lehmann and co. But does it 
always happen in every situation? Would it have happened if the game was in the 
balance?

26th over: Australia 185-2 (Khawaja 57, Handscomb 7). Azhar is on to replace 
Imran, a move that had to happen. Usman takes him down to fine leg for three 
when his first ball is down the legside. Handscomb goes one better, a beautiful 
clip for four through midwicket after getting to the pitch. How easy is 
cricket? On the radio Dirk Nannes compares the intensity of this session to a 
practice match, and with five sweepers patrolling the boundary rope and a 
part-timer in operation, that’s exactly what it is. A couple more to point next 
up for the young Victorian, too wide. 11 from the over.

WICKET! c Sarfraz b Yasir 59 (Australia 174-2)

Hard to overturn that with no hotspot. But there is a small spike on RTS, and 
that’s enough for Umpire Gould, who overturns the decision. It was one of those 
Smith reverse-drives more than a sweep. A very entertaining hand of 43-balls 
comes to an end with Australia’s lead 397. And that’s the end of a productive 
over for the visitors’ legbreaker.

24th over: Australia 173-1 (Khawaja 52, Smith 59). Smith’s half-century comes 
up with a single forward of square leg, just 38 balls to get there. Will he 
give himself enough time for yet another Test ton? I hope so. Plenty of time 
here. Sure enough, getting the strike back Smith pulls another boundary when 
Imran tries to go upstairs. Predictably too, it’s achieved after splitting the 
two of three legside sweepers. Imran is falling apart here, a full toss to 
Smith who simply pushes that to the cover rope, no risks here yet so many runs. 
The100 partnership is up. 90 balls for that. The second 50 in about quarter of 
an hour by my count. 53 off the last five overs, to be precise.


Daniel McDonald has written in. “If this top three were footballers,” he 
begins. I like this. I like lists. “Warner would be Cristiano Ronaldo, all 
overt power and superior skill, constantly at full throttle. Khawaja would be 
Lionel Messi, all quiet brilliance and subtle skill, constantly maneuvering the 
ball in just the right way. Smith would be Ronaldinho, all trick shots and 
unorthodox skill, constantly unpredictable yet no less effective.”

But who is Gazza?

23rd over: Australia 161-1 (Khawaja 50, Smith 49). “Some astonishing placement 
from Steve Smith,” says Osman Samiuddin on radio when Smith cuts forcefully, 
beyond the ring then the sweepers. He’s so good at that. Ric Finlay adds that 
no matter what happens from here in this innings Smith will retain his 60-plus 
going into Australia’s next series. That’s in India, beginning 23 February, in 
case you were wondering. A place they’re won once since The Beatles were still 
going around together.

Khawaja gets in on the party, using his feet to crash him over midwicket. Oh 
dear. “I’m getting the feeling this is a critical moment in the career of 
Yasir,” is Samiuddin’s take. And Khawaja does it again on the slog sweep beyond 
square leg this time!That’s his 50! 74 balls, that’s his fourth boundary. To 
end the over Khawaja opts for a reverse sweep! What a time to be alive. 
Thankfully for the leggie the set is done with. He has none-for-91 from his ten 
overs. What a mess.

22nd over: Australia 147-1 (Khawaja 42, Smith 44). Imran is on. He’ll be 
mostly just relieved it isn’t still Warner out there. I know he’s battled but I 
like this bloke. Especially when he gets around with a bit of blonde rinse 
through the hair. Then I really like him. He’s floating it down though, Smith 
taking full advantage. First, over cow. It’s not that pretty, but to the rope 
it goes, bisecting a couple of sweepers. To end the over, a powerful slap past 
point. Too short. Don’t bowl there.

Patrick O’Brien is on the ball. Thanks for dropping a line. His topic: ropey 
runs. “Imagine if they brought the boundary ropes in to just two metre from the 
pitch! Imagine every batsman scoring a million runs an over! Imagine how many 
runs that would be! Imagine how awesome cricket would be if they just did that!”


Droll, Paddy. Droll. 

Went along to a pretty interesting press conference earlier today with Dr 
Peter Bruckner about the Matt Renshaw injury. I’ll drop the audiohere 
<https://soundcloud.com/cricket-australia/dr-peter-brukner-media-conference-6-january>
. He again makes the case, persuasively, for concussion subs. What do you

21st over: Australia 136-1 (Khawaja 39, Smith 35) Singles wherever they want 
them from off Wahab, through the on-side more often than not. With a clip to 
fine leg from a fairly decent delivery highlighting that Smith can and will hit 
the ball where he wants at this stage of a Test Match.

20th over: Australia 129-1 (Khawaja 37, Smith 30) Yasir’s had a worse tour of 
Australia than Oasis when they trashed the plane. Actually, they definitely had 
a better time. None for smashed again, he continues from the posh end. Smith is 
sweeping for a couple to begin the scoring, it’s edgy but not an issue. Some 
brilliant run wins him two more out to cover, very much turning a single into a 
double. Along the way, that’s a 50 stand between these two. Khawaja profits by 
three to finish the over, paddling with like a frat boy during initiation week. 
Easy peasy.

19th over: Australia 120-1 (Khawaja 33, Smith 25) “Unexplored territory,” is 
how Osman Samiuddin on the ABC call describes draws between Pakistan and 
Australia in this country. He’s right, there hasn’t been one for quarter of a 
century. The home side are batting in a fashion that suggests that is the last 
thing from their mind, Smith trying to slog the slog the last ball of the first 
over back onto the moon. He misses. The rest of Wahab’s over yielded only one 
scoring stroke though, Khawaja pushing three to deep cover with utter ease.

Adam Collins

Had he done it. 

Had David Warner scored the fastest ton of all time. Would we even have cared 
that much? I’m not sure. It seems the natural progression that this is a record 
with plenty of fat, primed to tumble and tumble again over the next little 
while. If Chris Lynn gets a baggy green at some stage he’ll probably clock one 
in 40-something balls. Anyway, it’s over now. But wonderful while it lasted, 
lighting up that middle session here at the SCG.

For now, we have a final session scheduled to last 32 overs. At the rate 
Pakistan get through them, there’s no way we’re finishing up before 6:30pm. A 
declaration may be in the mix too if Sniffer Smith fancies a pop at them 
tonight. He’ll have plenty of runs.

It’s Adam Collins with you for all of it. I hope we can come together for a 
bit of a frolic, no matter how dreary and predictable the declaration batting 
becomes. We’ll probably see a Steve Smith forehand smash or three, so that’s 
not for nothing. Talk to me.Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> and @collinsadam 
<http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam> the conventional places for that. Probably 
less orthodox, but I’ll give you my number if you want it. Cricket now. Good 
afternoon.

Tea on day four at the SCG - Australia are bossing this game and lead by 340

18th over: Australia 117-1 ( Khawaja 30, Smith 25)

And that is that. Fittingly perhaps, Yasir is victim of another massive blow 
to end the session when Steve Smith drops to one knee and unleashes a mighty 
slog sweep. The umpires chat briefly, then decide Pakistan have suffered 
enough. That’s tea on day four and the tourists are in a spot of bother.

That is me done for the day but please give Adam Collins a warm welcome as he 
slides into the OBOing chair for the rest of the afternoon.

17th over: Australia 107-1 ( Khawaja 29, Smith 16)

Figuring it can’t get much worse, Misbah brings Azhar Ali on for a trundle 
now. Like My Morning Jacket albums and Teppanyaki restaurants, his introduction
seems like something you’ll enjoy, but then of course you don’t because it’s 
actually just a bit rubbish. Khawaja gets four, the earth continues to spin, 
and Pakistan look entirely lost with a 330-run deficit to contend with.

16th over: Australia 101-1 ( Khawaja 23, Smith 16)

Now even Smith is going to town on Yasir, dancing a quick-step to get to the 
pitch of the ball and barrelling it through mid-on with a roll of the wrists. 
It’s a like a coaching manual on whatnot to do, but for Smith it works, and 
he’s soon hoicking four more over deep mid-wicket. Australia reach three 
figures and from just seven eventful overs, Yasir Shah has conceded 58 
wicketless runs. Someone give him a hug.

15th over: Australia 89-1 ( Khawaja 23, Smith 4)

He might be running out of steam at this point but Wahab produces another tidy 
over, though not a particularly threatening one. We’ll have ten more minutes 
until tea, and Pakistan are focused solely on containment at this point.

Of course, Australia would have wanted a couple or more in that final hour. 
But they’ll be happy with one. It leaves nine wickets to get on the final day, 
which isn’t meant to be affected by rain. Pakistan require a further 411, so 
runs not a factor either.

Lyon got the breakthrough four overs before the close, encouraging the 
incorrigible Sharjeel Khan one too many times, flicking to Warner at midwicket. 
A poor dismissal from the debutant after he made it to 40.

So on a day where a session was lost due to rain, the home side moved the game 
as quickly as they could, wrapping up the Pakistan opening innings in an hour, 
making 241 in a couple of rapid hours at the crease, and making a breakthrough. 
Job done.

For the visitors, it will defy all expectations if they can hold on here. 
Truth told, it’s been an awful tour for them. Some positive sessions, even some 
days. But on the whole they leave well thrashed. To split the difference at 
least means they leave with something. Misbah will surely reinforce that point, 
in what may very well be his final day of international cricket tomorrow.

Let’s leave it there. From the SCG, Adam Collins signing off. Thanks for your 
company on behalf of Russell Jackson, Geoff Lemon and myself. We’ll be back 
before play tomorrow for the final day of this series with Guardian Australia’s 
over-by-over coverage. Until then, here’s your match report:

David Warner fireworks set Australia on path towards victory over Pakistan

16th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Azhar 11, Yasir 3). Oooh. The first Lyon ball is 
hard spun, hits the footmarks, and runs into Azhar’s inside edge. Could have 
been out any number of ways there. He’s more convincing in defence thereafter, 
consistently getting a big stride in when full, or deep in his crease when 
back. Couple balls to go. Will Lyon make him wait? He doesn’t, Azhar good 
enough to turn it into the legside for one. So Yasir has to face the last ball. 
The slow claps begin. Smith finally joins in, making a couple of changes to the 
field. Basit Ali? Can we? Please? Nathan? Garry? No, we won’t. Good batting 
from Yasir. That’s stumps.

Back with some final thoughts shortly.
 
15th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 3). In the best traditions of the 
nightwatchman, Yasir can’t help himself and goes after O’Keefe’s first ball. A 
shout of catch goes up, but the ball isn’t to hand; two scored to cover. He’s 
into a more sensible groove for the rest of the over, the left-arm tweaker 
again racing through his set. Could probably do with dragging it out at this 
stage of the day, could he not? Anyway, he’s already finished. Six balls left. 
Lyon to get them. Again: good captaincy.
 
14th over: Pakistan 52-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 1). Starc is back to take on Yasir. 
Good captaincy if he can find the stumps. They haven’t got a good record with 
nightwatchman recently, Rahat Ali out twice in the same match before stumps 
when given the gig in England last year. Bless. I miss Rahat. His first 
delivery is down leg, as is the third - badly sprayed, with Wade saving a 
certain four byes with a well-timed dive. Then on leg-stump, he gets off strike 
with a single. Not great over from the quick, the visitors inching closer to 
the close of play.
 
13th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Azhar 10, Yasir 0). Yasir has popped his head out as 
nightwatchman with three overs to go, Steve O’Keefe the ball in his hand to 
replace Hazlewood. He isn’t required as Azhar gets down the track to meet the 
spin time and again. It’s one of those 60-second overs from the left-arm 
tweaker. A maiden.

With Yasir out there batting now, he’ll be hoping to redeem what happened 
earlier.

Oh bloody hell. Sharjeel, after giving a bit of hope, falls with a clip to 
midwicket. It’s such a limp way to go. Who knows what is going on there with 
four overs to stumps. “He’s going to wake up with shivers in the night thinking 
of that shot,” is the view of Dirk Nannes on radio. Couldn’t have put it 
better. Just after their 50-stand too. And the last ball of Lyon’s over.
 
11th over: Pakistan 45-0 (Azhar 10, Sharjeel 34). Hazlewood a bit tired this 
time around, Azhar able to drive a couple of times early in the over, then take 
an inaccurate delivery through midwicket for a couple. He finishes the over 
with a hip-high full-toss, but the batsman isn’t able to capitalise. Reckon 
we’ll see a chance from the Members’ End next over. Cartwright?
 
10th over: Pakistan 43-0 (Azhar 8, Sharjeel 34). Lyon far more comfortable to 
Azhar at this stage, having bowled so many overs to him through this tour. They 
poke and prod at each other. Sharjeel though, when getting his chance crunches 
a cut shot from a ball that’s short but notthat short. How’s this stat... yuk.

9th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Azhar 7, Sharjeel 30). Hazlewood keeps Sharjeel 
honest, before the plucky batsman takes a couple to deep backward square when 
he drops a fraction shorter. Half an hour to go today.
 
8th over: Pakistan 36-0 (Azhar 7, Sharjeel 28). Sharjeel vs Lyon, that is 
where the fun is. He gets the strike after Azhar takes a single down the 
ground. First ball? Tries to smash him inside-out over cover. Doesn’t get much 
of it, but it isjust safe. Please don’t stop. 
 
7th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 27). Con Calma the implicit message 
from Azhar to his partner, leaving and defending Hazlewood’s next over, before 
retaining the strike with a single behind square in response to a shorter 
delivery. Good batting.

6th over: Pakistan 33-0 (Azhar 5, Sharjeel 27). Scenes! Sure, they’re chasing 
a million and probably should focus on batting for over a day to save this 
fixture, but tell my boy Sharjeel that! He first smashes the new bowler Lyon 
over his head for four after getting down the track. That’s the way to do it. 
Then to finish the over: puts him over the fence and into the crowd at long-on! 
Cop that, Garry!

5th over: Pakistan 20-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 15). Good stuff Sharjeel, he’s in 
this side via the white-ball route, and we’ve seen with Dave Warner this week 
that this is no longer a sledge. After leaving Starc’s early offerings he cuts 
the opener hard for one boundary and slices another behind point - albeit from 
another full toss - with the last two balls of the set.

4th over: Pakistan 12-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 7). Hazlewood doing what he does 
best, landing it in a shoebox on the fourth stump. Azhar knows the drill, 
leaving with relative ease. A maiden. This will again be a good contest. About 
16 stories online about this dab thing, I notice on the tweet. I still require 
more information.
 
3rd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 7). I really do hope for Sharjeel 
here. Some luck, some strokes. Something to remember fondly from his trip to 
Australia. He picks up a boundary here off Starc, through the off-side when the 
Aussie opener overpitches again. But he’s bowling quick, so when he gets his 
radar right he’ll be a bother.
 
2nd over: Pakistan 8-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 3). An edge from Sharjeel allows 
Smith to pull out a wonderful chase/dive/flick combo back to Hanscomb. Very 
clever, skipper. He got three for it and t three for it and survived the over, 
so fair play to him. Some grim Sharjeel news on the radio, Ali Mitchell 
reporting that his pink baggy cap is only going for $9 at auction. Go on, 
someone from the OBO community needs to grab that. “Yasir’s is dropping in 
value,” adds Mitchell with a laugh. True story.

Okay, so Usman Khawaja celebrated his half-century with a ‘dab’ earlier on and 
the world wide web is exploding about it. Must say, I’m not across this. 
Someone want to have a crack explaining what the deal is for the rest of us?

1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Azhar 4, Sharjeel 0). Well, Starc begins with a 
full-toss. Thankfully it’s a long way from Azhar’s body and no damage done. 
He’s attacking the stumps throughout, or at least trying to do so. When too 
full a boundary is struck behind point by the in-form opener. Good batting.

A bold call from a press box colleague between overs. But I’m probably with 
him.

Some odds and ends off the email while we wait for Mitch.

Rohan O’Farrell wants to know how far Viv would have hit the ball with Dave 
Warner’s bat. Me too.

Gavin Robertson has written back to confirm he isn’t the same bloke. And he’s 
from Scotland, so he hates me for showing that clip of Gazza being a genius in 
Euro ‘96. Onya, Gav.

Yum on the email wonders about the earlier Smith dismissal if snicko should be 
given the benefit of the doubt instead of the batsman in that situation. He 
says there’s no way you can be sure that he nicked it.

What do you think of this 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGBL9VhIHtU&feature=youtu.be>, he asks. I say 
it’s one for Mulder and Scully.
 Any excuse.  
465 will be what Pakistan require to win. Just as drinks came out, Steve Smith 
called them in. What a punishing innings for the visitors, a fitting way to end 
their disappointing tour with the ball for the most part. What a mess.

David Warner made the second fastest half-century in the history of Test 
cricket to begin the show. As he does. He finished with 55 from 27 balls. Steve 
Smith’s 59 took just 43, positively pedestrian compared to his deputy. 
Meanwhile, Usman Khawaja batted through the innings for 79 not out.

99.75 is the career batting average Pete Handscomb now sports when walking off 
the ground, his contribution today an unbeaten 40 from 25 balls, doing largely 
as he pleased to the Pakistan spinners.

Their frontliner Yasir Shah was the best bowler in the world six months ago, 
both by reputation and ICC ranking. He was a modern-day Shane Warne at Lord’s 
when spinning Pakistan to victory there. Today he had 124 runs taken from 14 
overs. It was hard to watch.

Oh, and attack-leader Mohammad Amir picked up a side injury along the way as 
well. He’ll miss the next week or so. I’ll say it again: what a mess. They’re 
innings begins in a few minutes. Can they survive 16 overs tonight and 98 
tomorrow? Draw your own conclusions.
 
32nd over: Australia 241-2 (Khawaja 79, Handscomb 40). 19 overs to come today. 
Azhar has another crack in the last of those before the drinks break. It’s less 
punishing than the handful that have came before it, only singles. He even did 
Khawaja with a googly. The edge doesn’t go to hand, mind.
 
31st over: Australia 236-2 (Khawaja 76, Handscomb 38). Another over of 
Handscomb fun, Yasir smashed to cow corner for the umpteenth time in this spell 
early in the set, then cut with panache to finish it off. Some gloves or a 
drink are ran out between overs, reinforcing that a declaration has to be 
close. Lead is 459 and Australia have made an even 100 in the last ten overs.
 
30th over: Australia 224-2 (Khawaja 75, Handscomb 27). Sorry for being tardy 
with your correspondence, but this is basically a T20 effort now. The 50 stand 
is up between these two when Khawaja ends Azhar’s over by helping it around the 
corner for four. It’s no good. Earlier in the set Handscomb flogged him to the 
midwicket rope after charging, almost by default.Gold coin entry to the SCG 
tomorrow. That’s good areas from CA, the money going to the McGrath Foundation. 
Nice job. Come on, Sydney.

Meanwhile, Handscomb needs seven more runs to have a 100 average, provided he 
remains not out, Ric Finlay relays. Sure.
 
29th over: Australia 212-2 (Khawaja 69, Handscomb 21). The 200 up as Handscomb 
scores a boundary off Yasir. It’s an edge and pretty good bowling to deceive 
the dancing batsman, but four all the same. More convincing is Khawaja when he 
gets his chance, jumping even further down the track and launching the leggie 
into the Brewongle Stand. Handscomb continues to theme down the wicket for two 
more. Declare? Not yet. Yasir has 1-112 from 13 overs.

An email from Gavin Robertson. I sure hope it is *the* Gavin Robertson? Who 
knows. Tell me, Robbo? “I think only Freddie Flintoff can play Gazza in the 
cricketing remake of the other round ball game.”

Can he do this? Any excuse. 
 Trip to the dentist.  
28th over: Australia 198-2 (Khawaja 62, Handscomb 14). “How many is enough?” 
wonders Dirk Nannes as the lead goes beyond 420. Handscomb picks up a couple, 
then a couple more, to the sweepers. Nothing to see here. Surely they’re 
bowling shortly.
 
27th over: Australia 191-2 (Khawaja 61, Handscomb 7). Imran completely 
misjudges Khawaja’s pull from a Yasir half-tracker. He nearly falls over the 
ball, but recovers with a one-handed reach. Points for the degree of 
difficulty. Some news: Amir won’t be available to bowl, has hurt a side muscle. 
Out for a few days but back for the first ODI next Friday is the report. Ones 
and twos for the rest of the over, some of the easiest Test runs you’ll ever 
see.

Andrew James on the email talking Renshaw. “Given the recent tragedy, as well 
as my own embarrassing experience keeping at club level when the ball missed 
the glove and clocked me at windpipe level, I’d say give the players every 
chance to take it easy. It’s a lot faster at 150km/h than you expect - just ask 
Piers Morgan.”

My take: it will be unsustainable for the ICC not to agree to the concussion 
substitutions. You need to take these decisions out of the hands of cricket 
people. That’s what happened here, to the credit of Lehmann and co. But does it 
always happen in every situation? Would it have happened if the game was in the 
balance?
 
26th over: Australia 185-2 (Khawaja 57, Handscomb 7). Azhar is on to replace 
Imran, a move that had to happen. Usman takes him down to fine leg for three 
when his first ball is down the legside. Handscomb goes one better, a beautiful 
clip for four through midwicket after getting to the pitch. How easy is 
cricket? On the radio Dirk Nannes compares the intensity of this session to a 
practice match, and with five sweepers patrolling the boundary rope and a 
part-timer in operation, that’s exactly what it is. A couple more to point next 
up for the young Victorian, too wide. 11 from the over.

Hard to overturn that with no hotspot. But there is a small spike on RTS, and 
that’s enough for Umpire Gould, who overturns the decision. It was one of those 
Smith reverse-drives more than a sweep. A very entertaining hand of 43-balls 
comes to an end with Australia’s lead 397. And that’s the end of a productive 
over for the visitors’ legbreaker.
 
Review! Did Smith edge Yasir? We’ll find out in a tic. They’ve gone upstairs. 
 
24th over: Australia 173-1 (Khawaja 52, Smith 59). Smith’s half-century comes 
up with a single forward of square leg, just 38 balls to get there. Will he 
give himself enough time for yet another Test ton? I hope so. Plenty of time 
here. Sure enough, getting the strike back Smith pulls another boundary when 
Imran tries to go upstairs. Predictably too, it’s achieved after splitting the 
two of three legside sweepers. Imran is falling apart here, a full toss to 
Smith who simply pushes that to the cover rope, no risks here yet so many runs. 
The100 partnership is up. 90 balls for that. The second 50 in about quarter of 
an hour by my count. 53 off the last five overs, to be precise.


Daniel McDonald has written in. “If this top three were footballers,” he 
begins. I like this. I like lists. “Warner would be Cristiano Ronaldo, all 
overt power and superior skill, constantly at full throttle. Khawaja would be 
Lionel Messi, all quiet brilliance and subtle skill, constantly maneuvering the 
ball in just the right way. Smith would be Ronaldinho, all trick shots and 
unorthodox skill, constantly unpredictable yet no less effective.”

But who is Gazza? 
 
23rd over: Australia 161-1 (Khawaja 50, Smith 49). “Some astonishing placement 
from Steve Smith,” says Osman Samiuddin on radio when Smith cuts forcefully, 
beyond the ring then the sweepers. He’s so good at that. Ric Finlay adds that 
no matter what happens from here in this innings Smith will retain his 60-plus 
going into Australia’s next series. That’s in India, beginning 23 February, in 
case you were wondering. A place they’re won once since The Beatles were still 
going around together.

Khawaja gets in on the party, using his feet to crash him over midwicket. Oh 
dear. “I’m getting the feeling this is a critical moment in the career of 
Yasir,” is Samiuddin’s take. And Khawaja does it again on the slog sweep beyond 
square leg this time!That’s his 50! 74 balls, that’s his fourth boundary. To 
end the over Khawaja opts for a reverse sweep! What a time to be alive. 
Thankfully for the leggie the set is done with. He has none-for-91 from his ten 
overs. What a mess.
 
22nd over: Australia 147-1 (Khawaja 42, Smith 44). Imran is on. He’ll be 
mostly just relieved it isn’t still Warner out there. I know he’s battled but I 
like this bloke. Especially when he gets around with a bit of blonde rinse 
through the hair. Then I really like him. He’s floating it down though, Smith 
taking full advantage. First, over cow. It’s not that pretty, but to the rope 
it goes, bisecting a couple of sweepers. To end the over, a powerful slap past 
point. Too short. Don’t bowl there.

Patrick O’Brien is on the ball. Thanks for dropping a line. His topic: ropey 
runs. “Imagine if they brought the boundary ropes in to just two metre from the 
pitch! Imagine every batsman scoring a million runs an over! Imagine how many 
runs that would be! Imagine how awesome cricket would be if they just did that!”


Droll, Paddy. Droll. 

Went along to a pretty interesting press conference earlier today with Dr 
Peter Bruckner about the Matt Renshaw injury. I’ll drop the audiohere 
<https://soundcloud.com/cricket-australia/dr-peter-brukner-media-conference-6-january>
. He again makes the case, persuasively, for concussion subs. What do you 
reckon?
 
21st over: Australia 136-1 (Khawaja 39, Smith 35) Singles wherever they want 
them from off Wahab, through the on-side more often than not. With a clip to 
fine leg from a fairly decent delivery highlighting that Smith can and will hit 
the ball where he wants at this stage of a Test Match.

20th over: Australia 129-1 (Khawaja 37, Smith 30) Yasir’s had a worse tour of 
Australia than Oasis when they trashed the plane. Actually, they definitely had 
a better time. None for smashed again, he continues from the posh end. Smith is 
sweeping for a couple to begin the scoring, it’s edgy but not an issue. Some 
brilliant run wins him two more out to cover, very much turning a single into a 
double. Along the way, that’s a 50 stand between these two. Khawaja profits by 
three to finish the over, paddling with like a frat boy during initiation week. 
Easy peasy.
 
19th over: Australia 120-1 (Khawaja 33, Smith 25) “Unexplored territory,” is 
how Osman Samiuddin on the ABC call describes draws between Pakistan and 
Australia in this country. He’s right, there hasn’t been one for quarter of a 
century. The home side are batting in a fashion that suggests that is the last 
thing from their mind, Smith trying to slog the slog the last ball of the first 
over back onto the moon. He misses. The rest of Wahab’s over yielded only one 
scoring stroke though, Khawaja pushing three to deep cover with utter ease.
 
Had he done it. 

Had David Warner scored the fastest ton of all time. Would we even have cared 
that much? I’m not sure. It seems the natural progression that this is a record 
with plenty of fat, primed to tumble and tumble again over the next little 
while. If Chris Lynn gets a baggy green at some stage he’ll probably clock one 
in 40-something balls. Anyway, it’s over now. But wonderful while it lasted, 
lighting up that middle session here at the SCG.

For now, we have a final session scheduled to last 32 overs. At the rate 
Pakistan get through them, there’s no way we’re finishing up before 6:30pm. A 
declaration may be in the mix too if Sniffer Smith fancies a pop at them 
tonight. He’ll have plenty of runs.

It’s Adam Collins with you for all of it. I hope we can come together for a 
bit of a frolic, no matter how dreary and predictable the declaration batting 
becomes. We’ll probably see a Steve Smith forehand smash or three, so that’s 
not for nothing. Talk to me.Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> and @collinsadam 
<http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam> the conventional places for that. Probably 
less orthodox, but I’ll give you my number if you want it. Cricket now. Good 
afternoon.
 
18th over: Australia 117-1 ( Khawaja 30, Smith 25)

And that is that. Fittingly perhaps, Yasir is victim of another massive blow 
to end the session when Steve Smith drops to one knee and unleashes a mighty 
slog sweep. The umpires chat briefly, then decide Pakistan have suffered 
enough. That’s tea on day four and the tourists are in a spot of bother.

That is me done for the day but please give Adam Collins a warm welcome as he 
slides into the OBOing chair for the rest of the afternoon.
 
17th over: Australia 107-1 ( Khawaja 29, Smith 16)

Figuring it can’t get much worse, Misbah brings Azhar Ali on for a trundle 
now. Like My Morning Jacket albums and Teppanyaki restaurants, his introduction
seems like something you’ll enjoy, but then of course you don’t because it’s 
actually just a bit rubbish. Khawaja gets four, the earth continues to spin, 
and Pakistan look entirely lost with a 330-run deficit to contend with.
 
16th over: Australia 101-1 ( Khawaja 23, Smith 16)

Now even Smith is going to town on Yasir, dancing a quick-step to get to the 
pitch of the ball and barrelling it through mid-on with a roll of the wrists. 
It’s a like a coaching manual on whatnot to do, but for Smith it works, and 
he’s soon hoicking four more over deep mid-wicket. Australia reach three 
figures and from just seven eventful overs, Yasir Shah has conceded 58 
wicketless runs. Someone give him a hug.
 
15th over: Australia 89-1 ( Khawaja 23, Smith 4)

He might be running out of steam at this point but Wahab produces another tidy 
over, though not a particularly threatening one. We’ll have ten more minutes 
until tea, and Pakistan are focused solely on containment at this point.
