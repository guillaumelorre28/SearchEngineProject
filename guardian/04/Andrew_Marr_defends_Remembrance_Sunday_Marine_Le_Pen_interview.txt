Andrew Marr has defended the decision to broadcast an interview with French 
far-right presidential candidateMarine Le Pen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen>, saying that failing to 
report on the challenge she and Donald Trump pose to western security would not 
honour those killed in the historic fight against fascism.

Introducing the interview for BBC1’s Andrew Marr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> Show, which was recorded on 
Thursday, the broadcaster said: “I know this morning some people are offended 
and upset that I have been to interview Marine Le Pen and that we are showing 
this interview on Remembrance Sunday.

“I understand that, but I would say this. Le Pen could under some 
circumstances become the next French president in the spring. This week in the 
immediate aftermath of the Trump victory, she has declared that the whole world 
has changed and that her brand of politics is on the march.


“What does that mean? In the end we are a news programme and I don’t think 
that the best way to honour the fallen is to fail to report on the next big 
challenge to western security.”

In the interview, Le Pen said Trump’s victory had boosted her own chances in 
the French election, and “made possible what had previously been presented as 
impossible”. She is expected to reach the second round of the election. The 
first round is due to be held in April.

A small protest outside BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
Broadcasting House during the programme by anti-racism group Unite Against 
Fascism was briefly addressed by Jeremy Corbyn, who was appearing on the show.

The Labour leader told Marr the protesters were angry about the language the 
Front National leader uses against minorities inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.

“She uses this populism against minorities in order to get herself elected,” 
he said. “The reality is she does not have an economic answer to the problems 
faced by the left [behind] communities in France any more than Ukip has an 
economic answer to the left behind communities in Britain.

“It’s only communities coming together with public investment that can deal 
with the fundamental economic injustices that are getting worse not better in
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.”

Asked whether Le Pen and Trump were similar, Corbyn said: “I think they 
probably are because they both attempt the same shallow populist appeal because 
once you let this nasty thing out of the box called xenophobia and intolerance 
it’s very hard to put it back.”

The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, had on Saturday criticised the 
decision to show the interview on Remembrance Sunday, tweeting:

The programme’s editor, Rob Burley, has also defended the decision to show the 
interview after complaints on Twitter. On Thursday, he said Le Pen was 
interviewed because of the size of her support in France, her prospects in the 
presidential election and the context of Trump’s victory in the US.

He added that unless a candidate was irrelevant, “it is our job to hold them 
to account and allow viewers to understand what they think. Our views about 
them are irrelevant.”

Before the broadcast, two former BBC executives also defended the interview. 
Richard Sambrook, a former director of BBC News, said interviewing Le Pen was 
“absolutely the right thing to do”.

He added: “In the context of very surprising populist electoral successes in 
the US it would be astonishing if the BBC didn’t interview her. I understand 
why people would be sensitive [but] it’s the BBC’s job is to reflect or report 
the world as it is, not report it in a way people would like it to be.”

His comments were echoed by Roger Mosey, a former head of BBC TV News, who 
said it was vital to scrutinise and challenge the views of politicians like the 
Front National leader.

 “If you don’t interview Marine Le Pen, you get very close to saying don’t 
interview Nigel Farage The key thing is to put these people on the airwaves and 
challenge then vigorously.”

In the interview, Le Pen described Trump’s election as “an additional stone in 
the building of a new world, destined to replace the old one” and praised 
Vladamir Putin’s “reasoned protectionism”.

She also dismissed allegations of racism made against the Front National and 
criticised Nato as a “tool for ensuring that countries that are part of it 
comply with the will of the United States”.
