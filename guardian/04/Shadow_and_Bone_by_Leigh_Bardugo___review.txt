The powerful nation of Ravka was torn apart by the Shadow Fold (a mass of 
impenetrable darkness riddled with monstrous beings that would infest your 
nightmares forever if you ever saw one) centuries ago. However when Alina 
Starkovv and her regiment is attacked travelling through it, many people are 
killed and others screaming, terrified of the horror occurring around them. 
Alina soon becomes terrified of the impending darkness and the regiment is 
bathed in holy light that has been dormant since her childhood. So Alina is 
taken to the royal court to be trained as a Grisha, suddenly thrown into a 
lavish world that is peculiar to her. But Alina welcomes her powers, after many 
infuriating training sessions with Baghra screaming at her.

Alina becomes a beacon of hope for the country and a weapon of the Darkling.


I enjoyed this book because the plot is clear and interesting. Not only that 
but Alina’s character development is very well thought out and not optimistic, 
like some other heroines. She develops lots of self-confidence and a sense of 
importance, which is refreshing.

At the start of the book, the Darkling appeared to be an understanding 
gentleman, despite his name; his character change – becoming jealous, selfish 
and evil – was completely expected but enjoyable none the less.

I would recommend this book to any young adult or teen reader, regardless of 
their favourite genre. The book is written in such a mesmerising way and it 
keeps you turning the page consistently!
