A full-page on Ayn Rand (Look out for number one, 10 March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/10/ayn-rand-atlas-shrugged>) but no 
mention Alan Greenspan. I quote from his 2007 book, The Age of Turbulence: "In 
the 50s and early 60s I became a regular at the weekly gatherings at her 
apartment ... I engaged in the all-night debates and wrote spirited commentary 
for her newsletter with the fervour of a young accolyte." Under Rand's 
influence, he writes, he "found the broader philosophy of unfettered market 
competition compelling, as I do to this day". I would say God help us, if it 
wasn't already too late.

Ironic that it was precisely Rand's greed is good philosophy that engineered 
the crash. In the UK we appear not to have heard of "one of the most evil 
figures of modern intellectual history", but she inspired Alan Greenspan - who 
in turn inspired Gordon Brown.
