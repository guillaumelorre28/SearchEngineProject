Why Brownlee left, and where he went,
Is a mystery even now.
For if a man should have been content
It was him; two acres of barley,
One of potatoes, four bullocks,
A milker, a slated farmhouse.
He was last seen going out to plough
On a March morning, bright and early.


By noon Brownlee was famous;
They had found all abandoned, with
The last rig unbroken, his pair of black
Horses, like man and wife,
Shifting their weight from foot to
Foot, and gazing into the future. 

Paul Muldoon’s short, beautiful poem touches on many things – a secret life, a 
hint of tragedy, but as much as anything else it captures what can be 
double-edged about farming. We don’t know what happened to Brownlee, but from 
the outside the view is that he “should have been content” with his barley, 
potatoes, bullocks, milker and farmhouse. But all was not as it seemed, and 
farming - what may seem like the bountiful joy of growing, of producing and 
living of the land and culminating in harvest, might seem idyllic in theory, 
but clearly it is often not. Farming’s hard won rewards are fragile, and in the 
sudden, cold wind of an indifferent universe, they can all suddenly be gone, 
snuffed out like a life, blown away like straw in the breeze. And perhaps only 
Brownlee’s two black horses, in that poetic image, shifting their weight from 
foot to foot, and “gazing in to the future”, really know the truth.

Farming <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming> seems to be all 
about extremes. Hard work can bring high yields, yet there are also massive 
risks, and what has inspired many a song is the hovering black cloud, or 
hurricane, or drought, that may cause everything to be lost. Most of us are 
probably descended from farmers back in time, so is it the most natural, 
fundamental and important of all jobs? It spans the furthest corners of the 
world from rice and tea in China to India to the vast wheat fields and ranches 
of the US and Canada. On a psychological level, is there great joy and 
satisfaction in sowing crops and watching them grow, or keeping animals to 
watch them multiply? Or is there something deeply unnatural about mass 
production, and the level of control and manipulation in battery farming to GM 
crops?

 Stacks of fun … a display reminding us of Ms Parton’s upbringing at Dollywood 
Country, folk and bluegrass will offer rich pickings this week. So your 
choices may range from the deep mountains ofDolly Parton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dolly-parton> to the dustbowls of Woody 
Guthrie. Many of the Delta blues musicians, such as Mississippi John Hurt 
earned a living as farm hands. There is a rich history of first-hand experience 
in music from the fields. And many songs will also be about escaping life on 
the farm, as much as living or working on it. Perhaps, as in Oklahoma!, you may 
wonder whether the farmer and the cowhand can be friends?

 An act of farming diplomacy in Oklahoma! 
Farming, perhaps with less authenticity, may even crop up in the work of those 
who turned to it after becoming famous - such asBlur’s Alex James with his love 
of cheese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/feb/16/alex-james-memoir-cheese>
, and the Who’s Roger Daltrey and his trout. My only true farming experience, 
apart from a bit of blackberry picking, involved a bit of cash-in-hand work as 
student, walking in a line through fields of wheat to pull up clusters of rogue 
crops. This ancient, if surreal pastime was made easier by passing down the 
line some specially rolled cigarettes and a chewing on a few local mushrooms 
until the wheat field began to glow and look something like this …

Back to the songs, and what kinds of feelings do they harvest? Joy? 
Insecurity? Doubt? Controversy? Certainly stories of how fate can play an 
extreme hand will almost certainly run through the roots of many songs on this 
subject. But they may also express a sense of pride, family history, struggle, 
and fortitude. They may talk, for example, about conflicts between farmer and 
land owner, or farmer and farm hands, not to mention cowboys. Or battles with 
the elements. The fate of crops - wheat, maize, corn, tobacco, tea, apples, 
potatoes or other fruit and veg. Or the state of the land, rivers and other 
forms of irrigation, the prairies, meadows and hills. Your songs my talk about 
farming equipment from ploughs to tractors and harvesters. Or farmer’s 
daughters and sons. Or they may feature all kinds of farm animals - herds of 
cows, ox, and sheep, chickens, goats, pigs, horses, llamas, or armadillos. OK, 
I’m making it up about the armadillos. But that would be fun, wouldn’t it? Mind 
you, I do like llamas …

So is farming a noble profession, or a cruel, exploitative one? Or one 
exploited by others, such as by the supermarkets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/24/booths-dairy-farmers-supermarkets-milk-price>
 and land owners? Probably all of the above. Whatever it is, there’s no denying 
how much we need it. As it says in one song, covered by artists that have 
included Pete Seeger and Ry Cooder:


The farmer lives on credit ’til the fall.
 Then they take him by the hand, and they lead him through the land,
 And the middle man’s the man who gets it all.
 The lawyer hangs around while the butcher cuts a pound,
 But the farmer is the man who feeds them all.


So then, sow the seeds of your imagination, gather in your crops of your 
musical collections, and bring in the harvest for this week’s farm-based songs. 
This week’s head herdsman and lord of the land comes from the other side of the 
world - we welcome backdeanofromoz
