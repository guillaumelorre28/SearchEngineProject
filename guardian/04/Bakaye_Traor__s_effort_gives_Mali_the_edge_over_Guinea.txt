A speculative effort from Bakaye Traoré secured a hard-fought win for Mali 
over Guinea in their openingAfrica Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> Group D match in 
Libreville on Tuesday.

The French-born midfielder struck from outside the penalty area to separate 
the west African rivals, the last of the 16 teams at this year's tournament in 
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to get their campaigns underway.

The 29th-minute goal came after a strong run from Modibo Maïga who cut the 
ball back for Traoré to blast home as Seydou Keita scampered out of the way.

On a night of plentiful chances it was the only accurate finish as both sides 
traded blows in a high-tempo game.

Guinea made the most opportunities, notably in the first 25 minutes with 
Ismaël Bangoura going close, and in a dominant second-half display as they 
attempted to get back into the game.

The coach, Michel Dussuyer, introduced three substitutes, including the 
debutant Abdoul Razzagui Camara, to increase the pace of his attack but was let 
down by poor finishing.

The substitute Ousmane Barry missed a header in front of goal provided by 
Camara's cross and the former captain Pascal Feindouno twice shot narrowly wide.
