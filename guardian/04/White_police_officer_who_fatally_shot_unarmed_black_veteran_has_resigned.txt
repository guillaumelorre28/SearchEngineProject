Police say a white Atlanta-area police officer who shot a naked, mentally ill 
black veteran who was unarmed has resigned.

 Major Stephen Fore with the DeKalb County police department says Officer 
Robert Olsen resigned from the department on Monday.

Olsen was indicted last week on charges of felony murder, aggravated assault, 
violating oath of office and making a false statement in the shooting death of 
Anthony Hill.

Olsen shot Hill on 9 March while responding to a call of a naked man behaving 
erratically outside a suburbanAtlanta

the 27-year-old Hill says he was a US air force veteran who struggled with 
mental health problems.

Olsenâ€™s attorney, Don Samuel, has said his client will be exonerated when all 
evidence is presented at trial.
