Walking around the Kokomleme market area in Accra, everyone seems to know 
Faustina Fynn Nyame. "When we first set up our headquarters in this area, we 
came to this market all the time to tell local people about the clinic and it 
is really important that we still do." Attaining buy-in from the local 
community has been vital to MSI's success in Ghana.

In the market, Faustina points out some common household implements that can 
be combined and used for abortions. Using homemade concoctions is a very 
dangerous method of inducing an abortion but is very common in Ghana. In order 
to try to tackle this problem, Faustina and her team educate the market traders 
about the dangers of these methods and they provide monetary incentives for 
them to refer women to the MSI Clinic rather than sell them these goods.

In 2006, Faustina left her role as manager of the MSI South London Clinic in 
Brixton, London, and set up the MSI Ghana country programme from scratch. 
Although Brixton might seem like a world away from this busy market in Accra, 
Faustina, from her experiences, can see one thing that women always have in 
common. "If a woman wants to have a child she will do absolutely anything in 
her power to have a child. If a woman wants to abort a child it is the same 
psychology. She will do anything. Our priority at Marie Stopes International is 
that women are able to make these choices safely; we are not here to judge."
