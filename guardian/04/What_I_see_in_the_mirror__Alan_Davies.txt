I was told when I was young that my eyes were olive-coloured. At the time I'd 
never seen an olive, let alone eaten one, but I've since eaten many and my eyes 
aren't that colour at all.

I get my curly hair from my mum, who died when I was six. Throughout the 
1970s, my brother and I had the same short back and sides as my dad. I was very 
neat until my late 20s, when a girlfriend said I should grow my hair. We turned 
out to be a disaster, but I carried on growing it.

When I was cast as Jonathan Creek <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008jg9q>, 
I expected to have to cut my hair, but they wanted me to keep it. So it became 
part of my public image because the show was on BBC1 on a Saturday night and 
had 12m viewers. Years later, in 2006, I met my wife and she liked the hair, so 
that was another reason to keep it.

I am 48, and my hair's not as shiny and lustrous as it was. One problem of 
middle age is that your hair starts to give up the ghost, even though you feel 
full of vigour. It warns younger potential mates that you've rotten old sperm 
that's no use to the species. But people are still envious; they'd rather have 
dried-out, greying, knackered hair than none at all.

I've terrible problems with my posture. I've been to Pilates to get my head to 
sit on top of my spine, but it still lolls forward – I look like I'm trying to 
hide. I walk weirdly, I'm a bit overweight and 20 years older than I want to 
be, so I can't stand the sight of myself. In fact, the only time I look in a 
mirror is to see how badly my teeth need a clean.
