Guardian journalist Martin Chulov has won the Orwell journalism prize 
<http://theorwellprize.co.uk/> for his coverage of the Middle East. 


Chulov, who has reported from the region since 2005, was recognised for his 
reporting of the crises across the Arab world and the rise of Islamic State.


Collecting the prize, Chulov said: “The shortlist does justice to the Orwell 
name and I’m tremendously honoured.”

Chulov was chosen from a shortlist including Rosie Blau (The Economist), 
Rebecca Omonira-Oyekanmi (OpenDemocracy.net, Lacuna, New Statesman), Mary 
Riddell, (The Daily Telegraph), Peter Ross (Scotland on Sunday) and Kim 
Sengupta (The Independent).
