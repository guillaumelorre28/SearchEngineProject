The other side of Hout Bay

Everyone goes to Clifton and Camps Bay – and the area is really crowded. So 
instead, go to the other side of Camps Bay. Barely anyone there! You can do the 
spectacular drive to beautifulChapman’s Peak 
<http://www.chapmanspeakdrive.co.za/the-drive.html>. Or take the train to 
Simon’s Town, a quaint old naval town with a pretty harbour and antique shops. 
It’s close to Kalk Bay and Boulders beach, where there is a colony of a couple 
of thousand penguins.

This hotel is one of the world’s finest, and is on the V&A Waterfront. Visit 
the Bascule Bar for bargain cocktails which, thanks to the favourable exchange 
rate, are only £3 or £4 (you would be paying £25 for cocktails in an equivalent 
hotel in London). Sit outside overlooking the yachts and the gorgeous view of 
Table Mountain. Waiters will bring you complimentary nibbles and, on cooler 
evenings, fleecy blankets, which of course will persuade you to indulge in 
another cocktail, and another …

I love it when I’m proved wrong. My initial impressions about Jarryds 
<http://www.jarryds.com/> were that it was a quaint yet bolshy upstart space, 
frequented by über-hipsters, serving vastly overpriced humdrum fare in a 
“trendy” space. But I was wrong. From the instant I was greeted with a genuine 
smile by owner Jarryd, I felt at home. The service was exemplary: attentive not 
OTT, succinct not fussy and clear not muddled. And the food! I had the Avo 
Smash – avo/feta/vine tomatoes/salmon/mascarpone and bacon (my addition) on 
sourdough. The freshness, the textures, the contrasts, the bacon! Oh … and the 
coffee. Delicious. I had three cups. The place was packed to the rafters, with 
normal people.

While Table Mountain and the Waterfront are must-dos in Cape Town, it’s worth 
also taking a stroll through the Company Gardens and the old part of the 
Business District, too. The reward is you get to see great architecture, as 
well as the peaceful landscaped heart of the city. There is a great little 
guesthouse nearby: theNine Flowers  <http://nineflowers.com/>has beautiful 
comfortable rooms, at a good price (doubles from £42) and a nice breakfast, 
too. Just a few doors down the road is theGusto 
<https://www.facebook.com/Gusto-Cafeteria-220325794683333/> cafe for the best 
flat white we had in the city.
