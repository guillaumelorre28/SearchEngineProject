The NHS spends at least £350m a year on management consultants – a figure that 
we suspect could be much higher. If anything pointed out the waste and 
inefficiencies that could be cut from anNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> budget, this was surely it.

Of the huge figure spent on these consultants, 78% (or £273m) was spent on 
projects that did not directly affect patient care. These include rebranding 
trusts, changing logos, or renaming organisations to make them more attractive 
to potential patients. The RCN has nothing against management consultants, but 
when one considers that the money spent on them could pay for 330 fully-staffed 
medical wards, one has to question the virtue of this expenditure.

If the NHS is to look at ways to reduce spending, then we must examine costs 
such as these. What we mustn't do is wield the axe on our frontline services 
and the areas that comfort, cure and care for patients.
