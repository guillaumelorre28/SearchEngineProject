Australia win by 220 runs

Unlike the first two Tests, this one went exactly the way that we expected 
after the first couple of days. That makes 12 Test losses on the spin in 
Australia for Pakistan, and the Pakistani stats guruMazher Arshad 
<http://twitter.com/mazherarshad> reminds us that this means four consecutive 
series whitewashes. Ouch. We’ll wait on Misbah, to see if he’ll retain the 
captaincy or hand it over to Azhar Ali and make his way into the sunset. He has 
served his country and world cricket stunningly well, in either case, and 
regardless of his dismissal today.


Let’s recap: Australia made a million runs in the first innings, thanks to 
Warner becoming the first batsman to make a hundred before lunch on day one in 
this country, and only the fifth in all of cricket. 1902, 1926, 1930 and 1974 
were the other years this has happened. Not bad.


If Warner went fast, Matt Renshaw went long. He batted the entire first day, 
then into the second morning before falling for 184. A brilliant innings to cap 
off an incredible emergence for the 20-year-old, though questions remain as to 
whether he should or will tour India. Then Peter Pantscomb Handscomb 
consolidated the advantage with his second Test ton to take the score to 538, 
and gave us some amusement when he late-cut his own stumps over to be out hit 
wicket.


Pakistan made 315 based almost entirely on Younus Khan, who made over half 
those runs himself with his magnificent 175 not out. He batted through almost 
the entire innings, given the first two wickets fell within a couple of overs 
of the start, he resisted with Azhar Ali for several hours, then he batted well 
with the tail to make sure there was no chance Australia would enforce the 
follow on.

They didn’t, but they did smash Pakistan all over the park to set a lead. 
Warner made the fastest 50 by an Australian, from 23 balls. Smith made 59 from 
43, Khawaja 79 not out, and Pantscomb 40 not out to take his career average to 
99.75. Then Pakistan was not able to resist for four sessions, losing their 
opener Sharjeel Khan on the evening of day four, then the rest by about 
tea-time on Day 5. Yasir Shah fought hard as nightwatchman, Misbhah resisted 
but then threw it away, and Sarfraz entertained when the result was all but 
foregone.

Five wickets for Lyon and O’Keefe between them in the second innings, four 
between them in the first. They did well, but Hazlewood was in another league. 
4 for 55 in the first, followed up by 3 for 29 in the second, neither spell 
going at more than 2 per over. Warner is the man of the match though, for his 
feats with the bat. Steve Smith is man of the series, and now averages over 60 
in Test cricket.


Some gold on ABC as Chris Rogers asks O’Keefe whether he’s having nightmares 
about bowling to Virat Kohli. “Nah, not at all. Some people might not know, but 
I played an Aussie A game against him a couple of years ago and knocked him 
over for about 20. So I think it’s the reverse.”


What a comeback for Australia. They were toast after Hobart, and now this far 
more cheerful band of players has won their next four Tests on the bounce. 
India is next, the massive challenge and the chance of humiliation still loom 
large, but at least spirits will be higher going into it than they were.

Misbah is speaking to ABC radio now.

“I will definitely take a little bit of time. I don’t want to announce 
anything in a hurry. We have PSL coming up in Pakistan in two months, so we 
will have time to think about things and make a decision.”

“Without taking 20 wickets in a Test match, you are nowhere. Their seamers 
bowled well on these good batting tracks. They kept the pressure up and kept 
taking wickets which we could not do.”


That’s it from us - Geoff Lemon thanking you for your company through this 
Test series on behalf of the Guardian OBO. But there’ll always be more cricket, 
so come back and join us for the next dance soon. I’ll leave you with the match 
report to complement my potted summary above. Till then.

WICKET! Imran Khan c Bird b Hazlewood 0

Colour me surprised. Imran’s batting career now reads 0*, 0, 0, 0*, 6, 0, 0, 
0. That’s probably an even higher percentage of ducks than Chris Martin. He 
lasted two balls this time -the first one he backed away and slogged and missed 
the ball by about a metre as it missed off stump, and the second one was on 
target, took the edge and flew to gully, where Jackson Bird takes his fourth 
catch for the Test match. None of which will count to his career tally, which 
stands at two catches from eight games.

80th over: Pakistan 244-9 (Sarfraz 72, Imran 0)

Have a few free hits, Sarf. Thanks chaps. He backs away and cracks Lyon via 
the cut shot through point. Four. Then on the sweep, for two, before a harder 
flatter sweep for another four. The field comes in for the fifth ball, so 
Sarfraz says thanks a lot, down the pitch and flicks over midwicket for four! 
Lovely shot. Last ball, he’s down on one knee, it’s in the slot, and the slog 
sweep carries the midwicket boundary for six!

Lovely stuff, 20 from the over. Except that a guy who cannot remotely bat one 
bit is going to have to face Josh Hazlewood with the new ball.

79th over: Pakistan 224-9 (Sarfraz 52, Imran 0)

As if to prove the point about Cartwright, Smith decides to fill in the over 
before the new ball with himself rather than his supposed seam-bowling 
all-rounder. Imran Khan didn’t look much chop with the bat in the first dig, 
and he’s not much here – an OK cut shot, then a big walloping slog that misses. 
But he’s more likely to survive against spin than pace, I fancy.

WICKET! Amir run out O'Keefe / Wade 5

Has to be a trademark run out. Steve Smith bowling his leg breaks, Amir has 
just played a lovely cover drive for four, then he drives to cover, starts for 
a run, Sarfraz sends him back, and Amir doesn’t make it. Waste of an innings.

78th over: Pakistan 219-8 (Sarfraz 51, Amir 1)


Single second ball to Sarfraz, and Amir bats out the rest of Lyon’s over. Dirk 
Nannes making the very fair point on radio that Hilton Cartwright has bowled 
four overs in the first innings, then none in the second. He’s clearly not the 
sixth-best batsman in the country, says Nannes, so why was he picked? All the 
talk was about having cover for the quicks, but it’s not like Pakistan have 
been rolled in no time at all.

Half century!

77th over: Pakistan 218-8 (Sarfraz 50, Amir 1)


Some consolation for Sarfraz – once again he’s so busy. A couple of runs on 
the sweep, then a couple through cover, then a couple banged into the ground 
and over cover. He’s buzzing all over the crease. Cuts a single from O’Keefe’s 
last ball to raise his minor milestone, which is his 11th 50 in Tests.

76th over: Pakistan 211-8 (Sarfraz 43, Amir 1)


A maiden to Lyon – sounds like a fairytale – and Amir meets each ball with 
studious defence. Two spinners working my fingers to the bone.

75th over: Pakistan 211-8 (Sarfraz 43, Amir 1)

O’Keefe swept by Sarfraz first ball, away through midwicket, and Mickey 
Edwards very nearly pulls off a brilliant save. Except that as he flicks the 
ball back it clips his chest, and his knees are already touching the boundary. 
Gets a single to the leg side, then Amir is off the mark using his 
left-hander’s angle to carve to point for a run of his own, as Virginia Woolf 
might have wanted. Loves that area.

74th over: Pakistan 205-8 (Sarfraz 38, Amir 0)

Sarfraz liking cover again, slaps a couple, then takes a single. Amir on 
stroke to Lyon just soaks up the over. He’s been very good with the bat this 
tour, Amir. he and Sarfraz did good work together up in Brisbane. This is a 
massive challenge though.

WICKET! Wahab c Wade b O'Keefe 12

73rd over: Pakistan 202-8 (Sarfraz 34)

O’Keefe likes striking from the last ball of the over. Sarfraz gets a single 
first ball, Wahab does the sensible thing and defends the next five, but the 
last of them brings him undone. Beats the edge, Wade appeals, not out but DRS 
is called on. I don’t think this is out, there’s a spike after the ball has 
passed the bat, which could equally have been equipment colliding or spikes in 
the dirt or anything else. It’s a bit like Steve Smith’s dismissal in this same 
match, though I thought that Smith’s one tied up a bit more closely with the 
sound signature and the position of the ball. Wahab’s was clearly behind the 
bat, for mine, when the spike bobbled up. But Ian Gould has gunned them both.

72nd over: Pakistan 201-7 (Sarfraz 34, Wahab 12)


Hello, boys. Happy hour has begun. Wahab Riaz comes in ahead of Mohammad Amir, 
who has a rib muscle injury, and he likes the promotion.

Four, swatted down low through mid on.

Four, swept harder and squarer, square leg this time and gone.

Four, reverse swept, best shot of the lot, and three in the row. Positioned 
himself well, and utterly creamed that through backward point. Even Lyon liked 
it.

WICKET! Misbah-ul-Haq c Lyon b O'Keefe 38

71st over: Pakistan 188-7 (Sarfraz 33)

There it is. This utterly bizarre method of approaching a defensive innings, 
this completely anti-intuitive way of trying to secure a draw, it has finally 
ended in the inevitable way. Sarfraz nearly holes out via a leading edge first 
ball, then eventually works a two and a single and give the last ball to 
Misbah. Misbah tries to find another six over long off. Why? Just why?

This may be his last match, if his own signs are anything to go by, but the 
plaudits can come later. Right now, this is lamentable cricket. It makes no 
sense. A captain, batting to save a match, after such a losing streak for 
Pakistan on Australian shores that spans decades. Runs mean nothing, except to 
affect the bowler, but if they need to be scored there are low-risk ways of 
doing so. Instead Misbah kept hitting, and if you hit for long enough you are 
going to miss. Big skew, high in the air, Lyon at mid-off holds it tumbling 
back, and for all that Misbah-ul-Haq has done for his team-mates, today he has 
let them down.

Misbah departs, for quite possibly the final time in Test cricket. #AUSvPAK

70th over: Pakistan 185-6 (Misbah 38, Sarfraz 30)

Lyon is asking some questions, with men around the bat. These batsmen manage 
to answer them for one more over. Three singles are taken, all worked away to 
the leg side.

69th over: Pakistan 182-6 (Misbah 37, Sarfraz 28)


I’m going to put my hand up: this is one of the most confusing innings of all 
time. Misbah facing Steve O’Keefe decides to defend the first three balls, all 
solid, all sensible. Then the fourth he drops to the marriage proposal position 
and dumps it over the long-on rope, where a security guard puts in a 
half-catch, half-dodge attempt that goes nowhere. Then, two more dots. What... ?

68th over: Pakistan 176-6 (Misbah 31, Sarfraz 28)


Suddenly Sarfraz is targeting the off side for Lyon. Bangs to mid off, bangs 
to point, goes back and carves a run against the spin to cover. They have two 
slips in for him, they’ll be pretty happy to have him playing like that. 
Goodness me. Misbah waits for the last ball of the over to find one that he 
lies, and goes through cover for a single with far less flash and risk.

Here’s our boy.

66th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Misbah 30, Sarfraz 27)

Dual spin with Lyon, and Mickey is back. Jubilation. Pakistan’s clean-up 
operation is in progress: sweep, sweep, sweep. First Misbah, gently for a 
single. Then Sarfraz, hard for a boundary. Then again, riskily, for a top edge 
and two runs behind square. They’ve added 39 in the last five overs.

65th over: Pakistan 167-6 (Misbah 29, Sarfraz 21)

Sarfraz. You are not responsible, but you are a charming rascal. First you 
have a big drive at O’Keefe, first ball of his spell, and edge a couple of 
runs. Then you sweep and bash it into the guy at short leg. Pantscomb is under 
the helmet there today. Then you show good judgement in bolting a single from a 
tap down the ground. Then Misbah gives you the strike back and you slam a 
boundary through point to make it 8 from the over while batting out a draw. 
Don’t ever change.

64th over: Pakistan 159-6 (Misbah 28, Sarfraz 14)

A bit more circumspect against Lyon in this over. Misbah sweeps a single first 
ball, and Sarfraz makes it all the way to the last ball before shovelling one 
in the air to leg, but it will only net him a single. Playing mind games?

63rd over: Pakistan 157-6 (Misbah 27, Sarfraz 13)

Dropped! Well, kind of. “Bird flew at gully,” said Gerard Whateley, but he was 
just describing what happened rather than angling for a pun. It’s a big edge 
from Sarfraz, driving very hard at the ball, and Bird dived well, got 
fingertips to it, but couldn’t complete the hatch. Catch.

A chance! Bird can't hold on to the tough catch at gully... #AUSvPAK

62nd over: Pakistan 152-6 (Misbah 26, Sarfraz 9)


What fresh hell is this? Nathan ‘Nathan’ Lyon comes back on for a new spell, 
and the very first ball Mibah goes for that signature slog, the bat almost 
vertical at point of contact as he comes across his pads, and it goes high out 
over square leg. So often we’ve seen those held in the deep, but there’s no one 
there this time with an attacking field. Misbah gets a run, then it’s Sarfraz’s 
turn to slog a couple over midwicket. He charges the next ball, and smashes it 
along the ground but mid-off stops the boundary. This must be a deliberate plan 
to target Lyon. Do they want to push his field back or push him out of the 
attack entirely? Strategy, strategy. Seven from the over.

61st over: Pakistan 145-6 (Misbah 21, Sarfraz 7)


What an over from Jaws Hazlenut. Bowls Sarfraz a snorter that rips past the 
outside edge, then another that leaps at the bat handle and is fended away into 
the off side to land safely by sheer fortune rather than design. Sarfraz 
defends a couple, then drives the last to the SCG’s new favourite, Mickey 
Edwards. That’s his last act as a fieldsman, as David Warner comes back on now 
to replace him, and the SCG bids a fond farewell. “He looks like an extra from 
Point Break,” marvels Simon Katich. Another maiden.

60th over: Pakistan 145-6 (Misbah 21, Sarfraz 7)


Sarfrazzamatazz only knows one way: be aggressive, be be aggressive. He stands 
up tall and punches Starc through point for four. Then tries again behind point 
but is foiled by a diving Nathan ‘Nathan’ Lyon. Cheers. Lyon throws to Maned 
Mickey Edwards. Cheers. Sarfraz goes through cover, icely deiven, comes back 
for the third. Very busy, and Misbah follows suit to close the over with two 
more runs. Nine from the over while batting for a draw, if you don’t mind. Love 
it.

59th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Misbah 19, Sarfraz 0)

Jackson Bird is getting some good gigs as the other sub fieldsman. Two catches 
in the outfield in the first innings, then he got moved into slip for the 
spinner, if you don’t mind, and snared Yasir’s edge off Steve O’Keefe. Now he’s 
in the gully for the fast bowlers, and Hazlewood has Misbah edging a ball near 
him that Bird stops on the dive. Last ball of the over is short and gloved down 
leg, but lands in front of Wade. Testing times, but Misbah has now soaked up 70 
balls in a stubborn display. Maiden, obviously, because Hazlewood.

58th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Misbah 19, Sarfraz 0)

Aside from Starc ripping through a batsman’s defence, the crowd this over are 
also enjoying the work of substitute fieldsman Mickey Edwards. He’s a young, 
rangy, fast bowler for Manly-Warringah, close to two metres tall, with a 
massive mop of bright blond curls spilling out from under his substitute’s 
baggy green cap. Huge cheers every time he fields the ball.He’s at cover, which 
is not bad for a fill-in. Sarfraz sees out the over.

WICKET! Shafiq b Starc 30

Caution wasn’t the watchword there. The ball is very full from Starc, it’s 
wide of the stumps, and Shafiq just throws the bat at it, angled blade and vey 
hard hands, seemed like a late and instinctive movement to flay. Instead he 
gets the inside edge into his stumps. Australia four away now.

56th over: Pakistan 136-5 (Misbah 19, Shafiq 30)


Misbah gets off strike first ball, a decently full one that he’s able to drive 
into the covers solidly enough and take off running. Starc is attacking an off 
stump line against Shafiq. Produces a nice delivery that Shafiq ends up playing 
inside, deliberately I fancy, but it did produce the standard vocal reaction 
from onlookers as it moved away from the edge and went past the stump. That’s 
enough warning for Asad Shafiq to just block out the rest of the over. Caution 
is the watchword.

55th over: Pakistan 135-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 30)

I fancy that Hazlewood is getting that ball to tail in as well. He’s certainly 
giving it every chance, probing on a straightish line for most of the over. 
only one ball is wider of off, and Shafiq cuts at it in an uncontrolled manner 
but misses. The last ball is too straight, and Shafiq glances it easily for 
four. Two overs gone, and Shafiq has soaked up all of the strike so far. He’s 
looking good.

54th over: Pakistan 131-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 26)

Away we go. Mitchell Starc around the wicket to the right-handers, trying to 
get that angle in, and looking for some of the reverse swing he found so 
dramatically in Melbourne. This pitch looks more conducive to providing it, 
according to an expert in the craft Dirk Nannes speaking on ABC radio. He’s had 
a few centre-wicket inspections over the course of the match and likes what he 
sees. Great to hear Jim Maxwell’s silver-trumpet tones back on the airwaves as 
well in his home town of Sydney - he’s been unable to travel for the other 
Tests after suffering a stroke a couple of months ago. But he’s in good form 
today, currently singing some Roy Orbison numbers with Cricinfo’s Pakistan 
expert Osman Samiuddin.

Asad Shafiq sees Starc out for five balls, then flicks the last for three runs.

“Geoffrey, forget sweeps and predictions. I have a request,” implores Robert 
Wilson. “Can’t they give Warner just a couple of overs? I love it when he 
bowls. Full-on Paddington hard stares and bouncers atthat pace. I swear I get 
tears in my eyes.”

Do you remember his early incarnation as a leg-spinner? He should have had a 
wicket with his first ball in Tests, up in Brisbane in 2011, but his 
half-tracker was dropped afte rbeing lofted to deep midwicket. Ah, what might 
have been.

Geoff Lemon

Yes, be gentle. I can always trust Mr Howcroft to be considerate. Geoff Lemon 
it is indeed, back with you for potentially the last session of Australia’s 
Test summer. Another wicket and it could all be over pretty quickly, Pakistan 
might be tired and ready to go home. But on the other hand, their tail-end 
batting has been unusually stubborn this series. The lower-order men produced 
astonishing resistance in Brisbane, dashing counter-attacking and then a pretty 
brave defensive effort in Melbourne, and even here Yasir Shah as nightwatchman 
batted through 93 balls, to follow on from 41 balls in his first innings. So if 
Amir and Wahab can match him, hope springs eternal.

The key man obviously is Misbah-ul-Haq, the captain who has led us to believe 
that he may be at the end of his personal road as a cricketer, even as his 
coach implores him to stay on. He’s had a miserable series as a batsman, but 
he’s been stubborn today through 57 deliveries. If he could deliver one more 
captain’s performance, breaking Pakistan’s long long losing streak in Tests in 
Australia, it would still rank as a pretty substantial achievement. The 
determined wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed is the other factor that will come into 
play, though even I the optimist will not expect anything from the true No11 
Imran Khan.

Lunch - Pakistan 128-5 chasing 465

Jonathan Howcroft

A terrific session for Australia. Four wickets, shared among three bowlers, 
and the tail of the Pakistan order is in sight.

Hazlewood bowled beautifully early on, and the two spinners maintained 
pressure throughout the morning. Smith rotated his attack smartly and 
maintained aggressive fields. Victory and a series whitewash appears a 
formality.

Pakistan again batted poorly, giving cheap wickets away unnecessarily. Younis 
Khan was the most guilty, slogging to mid-on to depart Test cricket in this 
country one final time.

Asad Shafiq looks good at the crease, but surely the last rites of this series 
are not far away. Geoff Lemon will navigate you through the next and possibly 
final session. Treat him kindly.

In the shadows of lunch O’Keefe rattles through another quicksilver over as 
fast as he can, but Misbah’s canny and does enough to slow things down and

52nd over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22)

Big shout for LBW against Misbah who bizarrely offers no shot to a delivery 
that pitches only just outside off stump, on a decent length. It was spinning 
past leg stump but that was dicey from the Pakistan captain. The rest of the 
over completes a harmless maiden.

51st over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22)

Spin at both ends now with O’Keefe giving Starc a breather. And it nearly pays 
dividends with one keeping low to Shafiq and just missing his off stump. Shafiq 
does look to go back very deep in his crease so anything that keeps low will 
cause him problems... Conversely it means he’s able to capitalise on just a 
fraction of room, as he does to the final delivery, rocking back and thumping a 
four through midwicket.

50th over: Pakistan 123-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 18)

Lyon varying his line and length, searching for the right spot to bowl to 
Shafiq who refuses to allow the bowler to settle. Well outside off there’s 
prodigious turn and bounce but fuller and straighter there’s less on offer.

49th over: Pakistan 121-5 (Misbah 17, Shafiq 17)

Shafiq’s arrival has perked the game up somewhat. He’s busy at the crease, 
finds gaps, and always looking for runs. Misbah looks more energised at the 
other end too as he claws his way into something resembling an innings. Five 
from a Starc over that didn’t look too threatening.

48th over: Pakistan 116-5 (Misbah 16, Shafiq 13)

Lyon back on with 20 minutes or so left before lunch. His first delivery is a 
loose full toss though and Misbah dispatches it through the covers.

That poor start and Shafiq’s nimble footwork make it a forgettable over for 
Lyon. It might have been worse but Handscomb wore a powerful pull shot at short 
leg to prevent another boundary.

47th over: Pakistan 111-5 (Misbah 11, Shafiq 13)

Shafiq has a life! A shorter delivery from Starc gets big on him and he’s 
cramped for room as he tries to ramp one over the cordon. He doesn’t get enough 
on it and it flies through the fingertips of a leaping Smith at second slip. A 
half-chance really as the slips have to be much closer than usual to account 
for the dying surface.

45th over: Pakistan 101-5 (Misbah 10, Shafiq 4)

Starc back into the attack to relieve Hazlewood and he finds the outside edge 
of Shafiq’s bat but it doesn’t carry to fourth slip. Decent over from Starc who 
looked in better rhythm than previous spells today.
Wonny Jalsh (@wonnyjalsh) 
@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> Your description of O'Keefe is 
spookily like how Ansari & Dawson performed for England. Both got clobbered in 
India.#AUSvPAK <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvPAK?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/wonnyjalsh/status/817536210306551808> 
Not an unreasonable comparison but I think O’Keefe has greater control than 
both those you mentioned. If Australia are looking for an economical fourth 
bowler he fits the bill in India. The problem is (as England found) taking 20 
Indian wickets on their own patch is no mean feat, especially for a team 
unlikely to have a penetrating allrounder.

WICKET! Yasir c Sub (Bird) b O'Keefe 13 (Pakistan 96-5)

Yasir’s resistance is finally broken! It was just reward for a terrific over 
from O’Keefe.

First he drew Yasir forward, beating the shoulder of the bat but just missing 
the edge. Next delivery does find willow and carries to Jackson Bird at second 
slip. It requires a TV review to confirm but no worries over that dismissal.

43rd over: Pakistan 96-4 (Yasir 13, Misbah 9)

Another tight over with little happening. Hazlewood continuing his work and 
Pakistan doing enough to keep him at bay. The last hour or so has been more 
filler than killer.

42nd over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8)

O’Keefe starting to find his length and pace now - slower and shorter. He has 
Yasir fishing outside off and then missing a sweep in a much more threatening 
over. On commentary, Warne seems unconvinced about the New South Welshman and 
immediately throws up his current pet name: Mitchell Swepson.

41st over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood rushes one through Yasir and just past the inside edge but the 
nightwatchman continues his vigil, rotating the strike soon after with a 
single. Yasir now up to 79 deliveries despite more credentialed batsmen 
capitulating around him.

Hazlewood finds some nice shape into Misbah but the Pakistan skipper digs out 
anything on his stumps and into the field on the leg side.

40th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

To those of us familiar with O’Keefe mostly at an international level, he is 
delivering exactly the kind of performance that makes us wonder if he has what 
it takes at this level.

He bowls accurately, full, and to tight lines, but rarely looks threatening. 
There’s not the flight, variation or revs to keep you on the edge of your seat, 
but he gets through his work quickly and is currently going for one rpo. Is 
that enough?

Just the one from the over to Yasir.

39th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood bowls his fourth maiden of this innings as his attempts to tease 
Misbah into an expansive drive fail. Hazlewood has 2/17 from 11 overs.

38th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

O’Keefe flies through a maiden to Yasir. His length is a bit too full at the 
moment, allowing the batsman to prop forward and nudge his way to safety.

37th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood, the star of the morning, comes back for his second spell as Steve 
Smith shuffles his pack. He’s immediately into his groove on a length on that 
immaculate fourth stump line of McGrath’s  his. 

At the crease Misbah has the air of a crash test dummy, hardly moving, wearing 
plenty of leather and looking ill at ease. After one of those deliveries that 
hit Misbah’s pads Hazlewood unfurls one of those appeals where he only deigns 
to turn and acknowledge the umpire 21-yards into his celebration. His claims 
are ignored though and Smith correctly declines to review, DRS indicating leg 
stump was not threatened on that occasion.

36th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Steve O’Keefe into the attack for the first time today, replacing Lyon, who 
bowled excellently for the opening hour and 20 minutes.

O’Keefe is bowling his left-arm orthodox from around the wicket to Yasir Shah 
who sees off Australia’s second spinner with little fuss.

35th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Yasir 8, Misbah 8)

Starc now coming around the wicket to Misbah, bringing more dismissal options 
into play in the process. Misbah offers little to the duel though and another 
maiden ensues.

Unlike the first two Tests, this one went exactly the way that we expected 
after the first couple of days. That makes 12 Test losses on the spin in 
Australia for Pakistan, and the Pakistani stats guruMazher Arshad 
<http://twitter.com/mazherarshad> reminds us that this means four consecutive 
series whitewashes. Ouch. We’ll wait on Misbah, to see if he’ll retain the 
captaincy or hand it over to Azhar Ali and make his way into the sunset. He has 
served his country and world cricket stunningly well, in either case, and 
regardless of his dismissal today.


Let’s recap: Australia made a million runs in the first innings, thanks to 
Warner becoming the first batsman to make a hundred before lunch on day one in 
this country, and only the fifth in all of cricket. 1902, 1926, 1930 and 1974 
were the other years this has happened. Not bad.


If Warner went fast, Matt Renshaw went long. He batted the entire first day, 
then into the second morning before falling for 184. A brilliant innings to cap 
off an incredible emergence for the 20-year-old, though questions remain as to 
whether he should or will tour India. Then Peter Pantscomb Handscomb 
consolidated the advantage with his second Test ton to take the score to 538, 
and gave us some amusement when he late-cut his own stumps over to be out hit 
wicket.


Pakistan made 315 based almost entirely on Younus Khan, who made over half 
those runs himself with his magnificent 175 not out. He batted through almost 
the entire innings, given the first two wickets fell within a couple of overs 
of the start, he resisted with Azhar Ali for several hours, then he batted well 
with the tail to make sure there was no chance Australia would enforce the 
follow on.

They didn’t, but they did smash Pakistan all over the park to set a lead. 
Warner made the fastest 50 by an Australian, from 23 balls. Smith made 59 from 
43, Khawaja 79 not out, and Pantscomb 40 not out to take his career average to 
99.75. Then Pakistan was not able to resist for four sessions, losing their 
opener Sharjeel Khan on the evening of day four, then the rest by about 
tea-time on Day 5. Yasir Shah fought hard as nightwatchman, Misbhah resisted 
but then threw it away, and Sarfraz entertained when the result was all but 
foregone.

Five wickets for Lyon and O’Keefe between them in the second innings, four 
between them in the first. They did well, but Hazlewood was in another league. 
4 for 55 in the first, followed up by 3 for 29 in the second, neither spell 
going at more than 2 per over. Warner is the man of the match though, for his 
feats with the bat. Steve Smith is man of the series, and now averages over 60 
in Test cricket.


Some gold on ABC as Chris Rogers asks O’Keefe whether he’s having nightmares 
about bowling to Virat Kohli. “Nah, not at all. Some people might not know, but 
I played an Aussie A game against him a couple of years ago and knocked him 
over for about 20. So I think it’s the reverse.”


What a comeback for Australia. They were toast after Hobart, and now this far 
more cheerful band of players has won their next four Tests on the bounce. 
India is next, the massive challenge and the chance of humiliation still loom 
large, but at least spirits will be higher going into it than they were.

Misbah is speaking to ABC radio now.

“I will definitely take a little bit of time. I don’t want to announce 
anything in a hurry. We have PSL coming up in Pakistan in two months, so we 
will have time to think about things and make a decision.”

“Without taking 20 wickets in a Test match, you are nowhere. Their seamers 
bowled well on these good batting tracks. They kept the pressure up and kept 
taking wickets which we could not do.”


That’s it from us - Geoff Lemon thanking you for your company through this 
Test series on behalf of the Guardian OBO. But there’ll always be more cricket, 
so come back and join us for the next dance soon. I’ll leave you with the match 
report to complement my potted summary above. Till then.


Australia ease to clean sweep as spinners turn screw on Pakistan
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/07/australia-ease-to-clean-sweep-as-spinners-turn-screw-on-pakistan> 
Colour me surprised. Imran’s batting career now reads 0*, 0, 0, 0*, 6, 0, 0, 
0. That’s probably an even higher percentage of ducks than Chris Martin. He 
lasted two balls this time -the first one he backed away and slogged and missed 
the ball by about a metre as it missed off stump, and the second one was on 
target, took the edge and flew to gully, where Jackson Bird takes his fourth 
catch for the Test match. None of which will count to his career tally, which 
stands at two catches from eight games.

 
80th over: Pakistan 244-9 (Sarfraz 72, Imran 0)

Have a few free hits, Sarf. Thanks chaps. He backs away and cracks Lyon via 
the cut shot through point. Four. Then on the sweep, for two, before a harder 
flatter sweep for another four. The field comes in for the fifth ball, so 
Sarfraz says thanks a lot, down the pitch and flicks over midwicket for four! 
Lovely shot. Last ball, he’s down on one knee, it’s in the slot, and the slog 
sweep carries the midwicket boundary for six!

Lovely stuff, 20 from the over. Except that a guy who cannot remotely bat one 
bit is going to have to face Josh Hazlewood with the new ball.

 
79th over: Pakistan 224-9 (Sarfraz 52, Imran 0)

As if to prove the point about Cartwright, Smith decides to fill in the over 
before the new ball with himself rather than his supposed seam-bowling 
all-rounder. Imran Khan didn’t look much chop with the bat in the first dig, 
and he’s not much here – an OK cut shot, then a big walloping slog that misses. 
But he’s more likely to survive against spin than pace, I fancy.

 
Has to be a trademark run out. Steve Smith bowling his leg breaks, Amir has 
just played a lovely cover drive for four, then he drives to cover, starts for 
a run, Sarfraz sends him back, and Amir doesn’t make it. Waste of an innings.

 
78th over: Pakistan 219-8 (Sarfraz 51, Amir 1)


Single second ball to Sarfraz, and Amir bats out the rest of Lyon’s over. Dirk 
Nannes making the very fair point on radio that Hilton Cartwright has bowled 
four overs in the first innings, then none in the second. He’s clearly not the 
sixth-best batsman in the country, says Nannes, so why was he picked? All the 
talk was about having cover for the quicks, but it’s not like Pakistan have 
been rolled in no time at all.

 
77th over: Pakistan 218-8 (Sarfraz 50, Amir 1)


Some consolation for Sarfraz – once again he’s so busy. A couple of runs on 
the sweep, then a couple through cover, then a couple banged into the ground 
and over cover. He’s buzzing all over the crease. Cuts a single from O’Keefe’s 
last ball to raise his minor milestone, which is his 11th 50 in Tests.

 
76th over: Pakistan 211-8 (Sarfraz 43, Amir 1)


A maiden to Lyon – sounds like a fairytale – and Amir meets each ball with 
studious defence. Two spinners working my fingers to the bone.

 
75th over: Pakistan 211-8 (Sarfraz 43, Amir 1)

O’Keefe swept by Sarfraz first ball, away through midwicket, and Mickey 
Edwards very nearly pulls off a brilliant save. Except that as he flicks the 
ball back it clips his chest, and his knees are already touching the boundary. 
Gets a single to the leg side, then Amir is off the mark using his 
left-hander’s angle to carve to point for a run of his own, as Virginia Woolf 
might have wanted. Loves that area.

 
74th over: Pakistan 205-8 (Sarfraz 38, Amir 0)

Sarfraz liking cover again, slaps a couple, then takes a single. Amir on 
stroke to Lyon just soaks up the over. He’s been very good with the bat this 
tour, Amir. he and Sarfraz did good work together up in Brisbane. This is a 
massive challenge though.

 
73rd over: Pakistan 202-8 (Sarfraz 34)

O’Keefe likes striking from the last ball of the over. Sarfraz gets a single 
first ball, Wahab does the sensible thing and defends the next five, but the 
last of them brings him undone. Beats the edge, Wade appeals, not out but DRS 
is called on. I don’t think this is out, there’s a spike after the ball has 
passed the bat, which could equally have been equipment colliding or spikes in 
the dirt or anything else. It’s a bit like Steve Smith’s dismissal in this same 
match, though I thought that Smith’s one tied up a bit more closely with the 
sound signature and the position of the ball. Wahab’s was clearly behind the 
bat, for mine, when the spike bobbled up. But Ian Gould has gunned them both.

 
72nd over: Pakistan 201-7 (Sarfraz 34, Wahab 12)


Hello, boys. Happy hour has begun. Wahab Riaz comes in ahead of Mohammad Amir, 
who has a rib muscle injury, and he likes the promotion.

Four, swatted down low through mid on.

Four, swept harder and squarer, square leg this time and gone.

Four, reverse swept, best shot of the lot, and three in the row. Positioned 
himself well, and utterly creamed that through backward point. Even Lyon liked 
it.

71st over: Pakistan 188-7 (Sarfraz 33)

There it is. This utterly bizarre method of approaching a defensive innings, 
this completely anti-intuitive way of trying to secure a draw, it has finally 
ended in the inevitable way. Sarfraz nearly holes out via a leading edge first 
ball, then eventually works a two and a single and give the last ball to 
Misbah. Misbah tries to find another six over long off. Why? Just why?

This may be his last match, if his own signs are anything to go by, but the 
plaudits can come later. Right now, this is lamentable cricket. It makes no 
sense. A captain, batting to save a match, after such a losing streak for 
Pakistan on Australian shores that spans decades. Runs mean nothing, except to 
affect the bowler, but if they need to be scored there are low-risk ways of 
doing so. Instead Misbah kept hitting, and if you hit for long enough you are 
going to miss. Big skew, high in the air, Lyon at mid-off holds it tumbling 
back, and for all that Misbah-ul-Haq has done for his team-mates, today he has 
let them down.

70th over: Pakistan 185-6 (Misbah 38, Sarfraz 30)

Lyon is asking some questions, with men around the bat. These batsmen manage 
to answer them for one more over. Three singles are taken, all worked away to 
the leg side.

 
69th over: Pakistan 182-6 (Misbah 37, Sarfraz 28)


I’m going to put my hand up: this is one of the most confusing innings of all 
time. Misbah facing Steve O’Keefe decides to defend the first three balls, all 
solid, all sensible. Then the fourth he drops to the marriage proposal position 
and dumps it over the long-on rope, where a security guard puts in a 
half-catch, half-dodge attempt that goes nowhere. Then, two more dots. What... ?

 
68th over: Pakistan 176-6 (Misbah 31, Sarfraz 28)


Suddenly Sarfraz is targeting the off side for Lyon. Bangs to mid off, bangs 
to point, goes back and carves a run against the spin to cover. They have two 
slips in for him, they’ll be pretty happy to have him playing like that. 
Goodness me. Misbah waits for the last ball of the over to find one that he 
lies, and goes through cover for a single with far less flash and risk.

Here’s our boy.

67th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Misbah 30, Sarfraz 27)

O’Keefe. Misbah. Flat bowling. Maiden. His bowling rate means I don’t have 
time to tell you more. SOK channelling the Kiwi rapper Gravy Teeth: “I’m so 
fast I catch the bus before it goes past.”

 
66th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Misbah 30, Sarfraz 27)

Dual spin with Lyon, and Mickey is back. Jubilation. Pakistan’s clean-up 
operation is in progress: sweep, sweep, sweep. First Misbah, gently for a 
single. Then Sarfraz, hard for a boundary. Then again, riskily, for a top edge 
and two runs behind square. They’ve added 39 in the last five overs.

 
65th over: Pakistan 167-6 (Misbah 29, Sarfraz 21)

Sarfraz. You are not responsible, but you are a charming rascal. First you 
have a big drive at O’Keefe, first ball of his spell, and edge a couple of 
runs. Then you sweep and bash it into the guy at short leg. Pantscomb is under 
the helmet there today. Then you show good judgement in bolting a single from a 
tap down the ground. Then Misbah gives you the strike back and you slam a 
boundary through point to make it 8 from the over while batting out a draw. 
Don’t ever change.

 
64th over: Pakistan 159-6 (Misbah 28, Sarfraz 14)

A bit more circumspect against Lyon in this over. Misbah sweeps a single first 
ball, and Sarfraz makes it all the way to the last ball before shovelling one 
in the air to leg, but it will only net him a single. Playing mind games?

 
63rd over: Pakistan 157-6 (Misbah 27, Sarfraz 13)

Dropped! Well, kind of. “Bird flew at gully,” said Gerard Whateley, but he was 
just describing what happened rather than angling for a pun. It’s a big edge 
from Sarfraz, driving very hard at the ball, and Bird dived well, got 
fingertips to it, but couldn’t complete the hatch. Catch.

62nd over: Pakistan 152-6 (Misbah 26, Sarfraz 9)


What fresh hell is this? Nathan ‘Nathan’ Lyon comes back on for a new spell, 
and the very first ball Mibah goes for that signature slog, the bat almost 
vertical at point of contact as he comes across his pads, and it goes high out 
over square leg. So often we’ve seen those held in the deep, but there’s no one 
there this time with an attacking field. Misbah gets a run, then it’s Sarfraz’s 
turn to slog a couple over midwicket. He charges the next ball, and smashes it 
along the ground but mid-off stops the boundary. This must be a deliberate plan 
to target Lyon. Do they want to push his field back or push him out of the 
attack entirely? Strategy, strategy. Seven from the over.


 
61st over: Pakistan 145-6 (Misbah 21, Sarfraz 7)


What an over from Jaws Hazlenut. Bowls Sarfraz a snorter that rips past the 
outside edge, then another that leaps at the bat handle and is fended away into 
the off side to land safely by sheer fortune rather than design. Sarfraz 
defends a couple, then drives the last to the SCG’s new favourite, Mickey 
Edwards. That’s his last act as a fieldsman, as David Warner comes back on now 
to replace him, and the SCG bids a fond farewell. “He looks like an extra from 
Point Break,” marvels Simon Katich. Another maiden.

60th over: Pakistan 145-6 (Misbah 21, Sarfraz 7)


Sarfrazzamatazz only knows one way: be aggressive, be be aggressive. He stands 
up tall and punches Starc through point for four. Then tries again behind point 
but is foiled by a diving Nathan ‘Nathan’ Lyon. Cheers. Lyon throws to Maned 
Mickey Edwards. Cheers. Sarfraz goes through cover, icely deiven, comes back 
for the third. Very busy, and Misbah follows suit to close the over with two 
more runs. Nine from the over while batting for a draw, if you don’t mind. Love 
it.





 
59th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Misbah 19, Sarfraz 0)

Jackson Bird is getting some good gigs as the other sub fieldsman. Two catches 
in the outfield in the first innings, then he got moved into slip for the 
spinner, if you don’t mind, and snared Yasir’s edge off Steve O’Keefe. Now he’s 
in the gully for the fast bowlers, and Hazlewood has Misbah edging a ball near 
him that Bird stops on the dive. Last ball of the over is short and gloved down 
leg, but lands in front of Wade. Testing times, but Misbah has now soaked up 70 
balls in a stubborn display. Maiden, obviously, because Hazlewood.

 
58th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Misbah 19, Sarfraz 0)

Aside from Starc ripping through a batsman’s defence, the crowd this over are 
also enjoying the work of substitute fieldsman Mickey Edwards. He’s a young, 
rangy, fast bowler for Manly-Warringah, close to two metres tall, with a 
massive mop of bright blond curls spilling out from under his substitute’s 
baggy green cap. Huge cheers every time he fields the ball.He’s at cover, which 
is not bad for a fill-in. Sarfraz sees out the over.

 
Caution wasn’t the watchword there. The ball is very full from Starc, it’s 
wide of the stumps, and Shafiq just throws the bat at it, angled blade and vey 
hard hands, seemed like a late and instinctive movement to flay. Instead he 
gets the inside edge into his stumps. Australia four away now.

 
57th over: Pakistan 136-5 (Misbah 19, Shafiq 30)

A maiden for Hazlewood, still attacking the stumps, Misbah equal to it this 
time around.

 
56th over: Pakistan 136-5 (Misbah 19, Shafiq 30)


Misbah gets off strike first ball, a decently full one that he’s able to drive 
into the covers solidly enough and take off running. Starc is attacking an off 
stump line against Shafiq. Produces a nice delivery that Shafiq ends up playing 
inside, deliberately I fancy, but it did produce the standard vocal reaction 
from onlookers as it moved away from the edge and went past the stump. That’s 
enough warning for Asad Shafiq to just block out the rest of the over. Caution 
is the watchword.

 
55th over: Pakistan 135-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 30)

I fancy that Hazlewood is getting that ball to tail in as well. He’s certainly 
giving it every chance, probing on a straightish line for most of the over. 
only one ball is wider of off, and Shafiq cuts at it in an uncontrolled manner 
but misses. The last ball is too straight, and Shafiq glances it easily for 
four. Two overs gone, and Shafiq has soaked up all of the strike so far. He’s 
looking good.

 
54th over: Pakistan 131-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 26)

Away we go. Mitchell Starc around the wicket to the right-handers, trying to 
get that angle in, and looking for some of the reverse swing he found so 
dramatically in Melbourne. This pitch looks more conducive to providing it, 
according to an expert in the craft Dirk Nannes speaking on ABC radio. He’s had 
a few centre-wicket inspections over the course of the match and likes what he 
sees. Great to hear Jim Maxwell’s silver-trumpet tones back on the airwaves as 
well in his home town of Sydney - he’s been unable to travel for the other 
Tests after suffering a stroke a couple of months ago. But he’s in good form 
today, currently singing some Roy Orbison numbers with Cricinfo’s Pakistan 
expert Osman Samiuddin.

Asad Shafiq sees Starc out for five balls, then flicks the last for three runs.

“Geoffrey, forget sweeps and predictions. I have a request,” implores Robert 
Wilson. “Can’t they give Warner just a couple of overs? I love it when he 
bowls. Full-on Paddington hard stares and bouncers atthat pace. I swear I get 
tears in my eyes.”

Do you remember his early incarnation as a leg-spinner? He should have had a 
wicket with his first ball in Tests, up in Brisbane in 2011, but his 
half-tracker was dropped afte rbeing lofted to deep midwicket. Ah, what might 
have been.

 
Yes, be gentle. I can always trust Mr Howcroft to be considerate. Geoff Lemon 
it is indeed, back with you for potentially the last session of Australia’s 
Test summer. Another wicket and it could all be over pretty quickly, Pakistan 
might be tired and ready to go home. But on the other hand, their tail-end 
batting has been unusually stubborn this series. The lower-order men produced 
astonishing resistance in Brisbane, dashing counter-attacking and then a pretty 
brave defensive effort in Melbourne, and even here Yasir Shah as nightwatchman 
batted through 93 balls, to follow on from 41 balls in his first innings. So if 
Amir and Wahab can match him, hope springs eternal.

The key man obviously is Misbah-ul-Haq, the captain who has led us to believe 
that he may be at the end of his personal road as a cricketer, even as his 
coach implores him to stay on. He’s had a miserable series as a batsman, but 
he’s been stubborn today through 57 deliveries. If he could deliver one more 
captain’s performance, breaking Pakistan’s long long losing streak in Tests in 
Australia, it would still rank as a pretty substantial achievement. The 
determined wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed is the other factor that will come into 
play, though even I the optimist will not expect anything from the true No11 
Imran Khan.

 
A terrific session for Australia. Four wickets, shared among three bowlers, 
and the tail of the Pakistan order is in sight.

Hazlewood bowled beautifully early on, and the two spinners maintained 
pressure throughout the morning. Smith rotated his attack smartly and 
maintained aggressive fields. Victory and a series whitewash appears a 
formality.

Pakistan again batted poorly, giving cheap wickets away unnecessarily. Younis 
Khan was the most guilty, slogging to mid-on to depart Test cricket in this 
country one final time.

Asad Shafiq looks good at the crease, but surely the last rites of this series 
are not far away. Geoff Lemon will navigate you through the next and possibly 
final session. Treat him kindly.

53rd over: Pakistan 128-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 23)

In the shadows of lunch O’Keefe rattles through another quicksilver over as 
fast as he can, but Misbah’s canny and does enough to slow things down and 
ensure lunch will be taken.
 
52nd over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22)

Big shout for LBW against Misbah who bizarrely offers no shot to a delivery 
that pitches only just outside off stump, on a decent length. It was spinning 
past leg stump but that was dicey from the Pakistan captain. The rest of the 
over completes a harmless maiden.
 
51st over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22)

Spin at both ends now with O’Keefe giving Starc a breather. And it nearly pays 
dividends with one keeping low to Shafiq and just missing his off stump. Shafiq 
does look to go back very deep in his crease so anything that keeps low will 
cause him problems... Conversely it means he’s able to capitalise on just a 
fraction of room, as he does to the final delivery, rocking back and thumping a 
four through midwicket.
 
50th over: Pakistan 123-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 18)

Lyon varying his line and length, searching for the right spot to bowl to 
Shafiq who refuses to allow the bowler to settle. Well outside off there’s 
prodigious turn and bounce but fuller and straighter there’s less on offer.

Nice Garry!
 
49th over: Pakistan 121-5 (Misbah 17, Shafiq 17)

Shafiq’s arrival has perked the game up somewhat. He’s busy at the crease, 
finds gaps, and always looking for runs. Misbah looks more energised at the 
other end too as he claws his way into something resembling an innings. Five 
from a Starc over that didn’t look too threatening.
 
48th over: Pakistan 116-5 (Misbah 16, Shafiq 13)

Lyon back on with 20 minutes or so left before lunch. His first delivery is a 
loose full toss though and Misbah dispatches it through the covers.

That poor start and Shafiq’s nimble footwork make it a forgettable over for 
Lyon. It might have been worse but Handscomb wore a powerful pull shot at short 
leg to prevent another boundary.
 
47th over: Pakistan 111-5 (Misbah 11, Shafiq 13)

Shafiq has a life! A shorter delivery from Starc gets big on him and he’s 
cramped for room as he tries to ramp one over the cordon. He doesn’t get enough 
on it and it flies through the fingertips of a leaping Smith at second slip. A 
half-chance really as the slips have to be much closer than usual to account 
for the dying surface.

46th over: Pakistan 109-5 (Misbah 11, Shafiq 11)

Shafiq already looks a class apart this morning, using his feet and the full 
depth of his crease to work runs off O’Keefe.
 
45th over: Pakistan 101-5 (Misbah 10, Shafiq 4)

Starc back into the attack to relieve Hazlewood and he finds the outside edge 
of Shafiq’s bat but it doesn’t carry to fourth slip. Decent over from Starc who 
looked in better rhythm than previous spells today.

@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> Your description of O'Keefe is 
spookily like how Ansari & Dawson performed for England. Both got clobbered in 
India.#AUSvPAK <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvPAK?src=hash>

Not an unreasonable comparison but I think O’Keefe has greater control than 
both those you mentioned. If Australia are looking for an economical fourth 
bowler he fits the bill in India. The problem is (as England found) taking 20 
Indian wickets on their own patch is no mean feat, especially for a team 
unlikely to have a penetrating allrounder.
 
44th over: Pakistan 100-5 (Misbah 9, Shafiq 4)

New batsman Asad Shafiq completes the over with a boundary, dispatching a 
loose full toss.
 
Yasir’s resistance is finally broken! It was just reward for a terrific over 
from O’Keefe.

First he drew Yasir forward, beating the shoulder of the bat but just missing 
the edge. Next delivery does find willow and carries to Jackson Bird at second 
slip. It requires a TV review to confirm but no worries over that dismissal.
 
43rd over: Pakistan 96-4 (Yasir 13, Misbah 9)

Another tight over with little happening. Hazlewood continuing his work and 
Pakistan doing enough to keep him at bay. The last hour or so has been more 
filler than killer.
 
42nd over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8)

O’Keefe starting to find his length and pace now - slower and shorter. He has 
Yasir fishing outside off and then missing a sweep in a much more threatening 
over. On commentary, Warne seems unconvinced about the New South Welshman and 
immediately throws up his current pet name: Mitchell Swepson.
 
41st over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood rushes one through Yasir and just past the inside edge but the 
nightwatchman continues his vigil, rotating the strike soon after with a 
single. Yasir now up to 79 deliveries despite more credentialed batsmen 
capitulating around him.

Hazlewood finds some nice shape into Misbah but the Pakistan skipper digs out 
anything on his stumps and into the field on the leg side.
 
40th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

To those of us familiar with O’Keefe mostly at an international level, he is 
delivering exactly the kind of performance that makes us wonder if he has what 
it takes at this level.

He bowls accurately, full, and to tight lines, but rarely looks threatening. 
There’s not the flight, variation or revs to keep you on the edge of your seat, 
but he gets through his work quickly and is currently going for one rpo. Is 
that enough?

Just the one from the over to Yasir.
 
39th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood bowls his fourth maiden of this innings as his attempts to tease 
Misbah into an expansive drive fail. Hazlewood has 2/17 from 11 overs.

38th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

O’Keefe flies through a maiden to Yasir. His length is a bit too full at the 
moment, allowing the batsman to prop forward and nudge his way to safety.
 
37th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Hazlewood, the star of the morning, comes back for his second spell as Steve 
Smith shuffles his pack. He’s immediately into his groove on a length on that 
immaculate fourth stump line of McGrath’s  his. 

At the crease Misbah has the air of a crash test dummy, hardly moving, wearing 
plenty of leather and looking ill at ease. After one of those deliveries that 
hit Misbah’s pads Hazlewood unfurls one of those appeals where he only deigns 
to turn and acknowledge the umpire 21-yards into his celebration. His claims 
are ignored though and Smith correctly declines to review, DRS indicating leg 
stump was not threatened on that occasion.
 
36th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8)

Steve O’Keefe into the attack for the first time today, replacing Lyon, who 
bowled excellently for the opening hour and 20 minutes.

O’Keefe is bowling his left-arm orthodox from around the wicket to Yasir Shah 
who sees off Australia’s second spinner with little fuss.

Australia’s morning at the SCG. Three of the nine wickets required at the 
start of play have already been taken.

35th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Yasir 8, Misbah 8)

Starc now coming around the wicket to Misbah, bringing more dismissal options 
into play in the process. Misbah offers little to the duel though and another 
maiden ensues.
 
34th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Yasir 8, Misbah 8)

Lyon rattles through a rapid maiden against Yasir. The nightwatchman now eight 
from 59 deliveries.
