Chelsea defender Ashley Cole <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ashley-cole>
 has been left out of England's World Cup squad.

Cole has 107 caps for his country but has paid the price for failing to hold 
down a regular first-team place at Stamford Bridge this year.

"I got the call from Roy and agree England team should be about the young 
players. I think it best I retire fromEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> team now," Cole tweeted on 
Sunday night.

"We have a great manager and team and I wish them only success. I will be 
supporting them like a true fan. Thanks to everyone for everything."

Cole's omission means it is highly likely that Southampton teenager Luke Shaw 
will make the trip to Brazil as back-up to first-choice left-back Leighton 
Baines.

"Baines and Shaw are great players, proved this season, and are the future of 
this country, it was a pleasure to get 107 caps," Cole tweeted.
