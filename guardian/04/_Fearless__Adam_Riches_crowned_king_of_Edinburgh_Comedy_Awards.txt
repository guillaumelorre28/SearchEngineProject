Adam Riches <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/adam-riches> was on Saturday 
crowned the 31st winner of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards after being praised by 
judges for his "trademark mix of character comedy, anarchic stagecraft and a 
fearless level of audience engagement".

The comedian, whose show invites his audience to play swingball and 
impersonate Daniel Day-Lewis, outshone joint favourite Nick Helm and four other 
nominated acts to gain the award. Previous winners include Lee Evans and Steve 
Coogan.

Receiving the prize from veteran standup Omid Djalili, Riches said: "Today I 
was just a bundle of nerves. But to get it was fantastic and overwhelming."

Best known before this year's fringe for slipping on a yoghurt and breaking 
his leg onstage during his 2008 show Alpha Males, Riches has taken five 
previous solo sets to the festival.

The Best Newcomer prize went to Humphrey Ker for his Dymock Watson: Nazi 
Smasher, and the Panel Prize was awarded to The Wrestling at Pleasance 
Courtyard.

Nica Burns, producer of the Foster's Edinburgh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edinburgh> Comedy Awards, said: 
"Congratulations to Adam Riches, who is utterly original, extremely funny and a 
huge talent. He will no doubt be seen on your television screens in the near 
future.
