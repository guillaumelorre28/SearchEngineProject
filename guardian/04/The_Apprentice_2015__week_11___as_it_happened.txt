You don’t have to wait a week for the final: it’s all going down on Sunday at 
9pm, so join us for more fist bumps, romance and plumbing. Until then, thank 
you for all the comments and don’t have nightmares. ’Night!

So, it’s Vana and Joseph who’ll be launching their businesses in Sunday’s

Joseph’s made it to the final. He’s like the Reggie N Bollie of The Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>. Oh, here goes Tricky 
Dicky again. He’s giving 100%. It used to be 110%. Is that how deflation works?

It’s time to beg in the last chance saloon. Vana: “I have a passion for this 
and I can bring this to fruition.” Joseph: “I’ve learned the core lessons and 
now it’s about moving forward.” Richard: well, he’s the Swiss Army knife of 
business.

What? That’s it? We didn’t even get to see Charleine wheel her suitcase out. 
Joseph’s non-existence ’tache has been getting more attention than her. Uh-oh, 
is he next?

You don’t have to wait a week for the final: it’s all going down on Sunday at 
9pm, so join us for more fist bumps, romance and plumbing. Until then, thank 
you for all the comments and don’t have nightmares. ’Night!
 
So, it’s Vana and Joseph who’ll be launching their businesses in Sunday’s 
final. Do you think Lord Sugar chose the right finalists? After all, he could 
have had Tricky Dicky, Corporate G or the fabulous Charleine...
 
That was emotional. Richard’s the real winner, in his eyes at least: 
“Throughout this process I’ve been the most successful candidate.”
 
And Vana’s in the final. 
 
Joseph’s made it to the final. He’s like the Reggie N Bollie of The Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>. Oh, here goes Tricky 
Dicky again. He’s giving 100%. It used to be 110%. Is that how deflation works?
 
It’s time to beg in the last chance saloon. Vana: “I have a passion for this 
and I can bring this to fruition.” Joseph: “I’ve learned the core lessons and 
now it’s about moving forward.” Richard: well, he’s the Swiss Army knife of 
business.
 
How can Vana still be in when the goddess that is Charleine has been given the 
boot?
 
They’re dropping like flies. Gary: You’re fired!
 
What? That’s it? We didn’t even get to see Charleine wheel her suitcase out. 
Joseph’s non-existence ’tache has been getting more attention than her. Uh-oh, 
is he next?
 
So Lord Sugar thinks Charleine should take hairdressing advice from Claude? 
She’s fired! No way. The woman is a sensation.
