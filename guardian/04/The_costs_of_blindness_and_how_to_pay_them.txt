Without support from itinerant teachers, Kalamma would still be unable to 
work. Identified at nine years old by a doorstep survey, her totally blind son 
Ramish has now been in school for seven years. Before that, Ramish could not go 
to the toilet alone and Kalamma had to care for him 24 hours a day. At 16, 
Ramish is now a popular member of the school with a close-knit group of 
friends. Kalamma smiles proudly as she speaks of her son's friendships: "They 
come to visit Ramish every day, and if by chance they don't come one day, he 
goes straight over to the shop to call them."

Kalamma and her husband Buranaika are coolies - casual rural labourers. They 
work where and when they can in the lush fields around their village, 
Manchannlelli, picking turmeric and tobacco and tending the wet paddy fields. 
They are paid daily and survive from one day to the next with no security of 
work. They each earn 600 rupees (around Â£7) a month.

Kalamma has never been to school and Ramish has already surpassed her 
educational achievement. Not only does this bode well for his future, but his 
attendance in school has fortified the family economy. The family have been 
able to construct a house with the money they've saved from Kalamma's income. 
Although the price of commodities is rising, threatening their livelihood, 
Ramish's entry to school has provided a previously unthinkable security for 
Kalamma and her family.
