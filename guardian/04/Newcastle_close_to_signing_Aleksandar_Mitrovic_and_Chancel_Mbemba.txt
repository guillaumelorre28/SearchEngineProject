Asked about the possibility of signing Mitrovic after the 1-0 win over 
Sacramento Republic on Sunday, McClaren said: “We are very close to something. 
There is a lot of speculation and pre-empting of decisions. But certainly from 
the feedback back home they are working very hard to bring one or two players 
in.”

Mitrovic scored 23 goals in 44 appearances for Anderlecht last season, 
including a goal against Arsenal in the 3-3 draw at the Emirates.

The Democratic Republic of Congo international Mbemba was left out of the 
Anderlecht side that beat Lazio 3-1 in a pre-season friendly on Sunday after 
Newcastle agreed to pay around £7m for the defender. The only stumbling block 
could be that DR Congo are not ranked inside the top 50 by Fifa, meaning the 
club may have to appeal for him to qualify for a work permit under new rules 
introduced by the Football Association in May.
