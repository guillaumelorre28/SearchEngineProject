Alexa Chung’s denim range for AG  
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/oct/28/ag-jeans-alexa-chungs-new-look>
launches today! It has been preceded by the usual amount of hysteria that comes 
with anything Ms Chung puts her hand to and our now familiar hankering to dress 
like her. We have studied the collection at length, cast our eye over the 
denim-clad revellers at the launch party on Thursday night, and come up with 
five rules to wearing denimà la Alexa Chung

For the launch of her jeans range, Alexa teamed her button-through frock with 
semi-opaque glitter tights, which is a bit Saint Laurent but not so much that 
it’s copycat. Rather than high platforms, as seen at Hedi Slimane’s show, she 
is wearing ankle boots. That adds an edge of tomboy toughness that makes it all 
her own. Feel free to freestyle with your own signature item or, if you’re 
short on time and inspiration, just buy some ankle boots. Particularly good for 
perching on banquettes.

Your new jean shape is a kick flare, but only in the summer

 Kick-flare jeans by Alexa Chung for AG. 
Alexa doesn’t really do socks – at least not with jeans. Last week saw her 
pair brogues with cropped trousers, and it’s January. These kick flares are a 
great new shape, but lose their Alexa power with any type of hosiery. She would 
no doubt namecheckJane Birkin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/oct/21/jane-birkin-serge-gainsbourg-stylish-couple>
 here, and wear with bare feet. Just bare ankles are fine if you have to, you 
know, go to work or something.

Red lipstick is your friend

We have looked at this picture of Alexa in a chambray frock for a while, and 
decided that it’s not the endless giraffe legs that make it look good. Or the 
glossy auburn locks. No. It’s the pop of red lipstick that, worn with blue 
denim, brings it to life. And everyone owns a red lipstick, don’t they? Adopt 
immediately. See also: blogger, Ella Catliff oflapetiteanglais.com

 Skirt by Alexa Chung for AG. 
Alexa describes her “dream denim wardrobe” as hailing from the late 1960s and 
early 70s.Jeans <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/jeans> aside, nothing says 
this like a button-through skirt or dress. These are both included in the 
collection, and Alexa models the dress – called Pixie after her BFF – in the 
campaign. Disclaimer: we actually think the skirt is more Alexa, and would 
style it with a chunky camel polo neck. Just saying.

Dress like your ‘mom’

 Sweater by Alexa Chung for AG. 
All denim aficionados have their favourite things to wear with it. To wear it 
the Alexa way, avoid anything patterned and neon. Neutrals are your friend. Try 
a grey marl or white sweatshirt, khaki T-shirt or – for that 70s mom vibe – a 
soft ribbed T-shirt-. The kind of thing you wish you could find in a vintage 
store. That’s what Alexa style is all about.

Embrace dungarees

Obviously. The queen of the dungas has, true to form, put two dungaree styles 
in her collection:a pair of full-length ones 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/product/1010468> and a sweet, short dungaree 
dress <http://www.matchesfashion.com/product/1010469>. This may be the 
trickiest way to wear denim like Alexa, but take a tip from point four. Add a 
soft ribbed T-shirt and everything will be OK.
