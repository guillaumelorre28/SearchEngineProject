Togo's goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale is awake and recovering well at the Milpark 
Hospital in Johannesburg just under two weeks after his team bus came under 
attack in Angola, a spokesman for the medical centre has confirmed.

The 25-year-old was travelling to the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> with the rest of his 
team-mates before the start of the competition when they were shot at with 
machine-guns in the Cabinda region of the country.

Three people died in the 8 January incident – the driver, an assistant coach 
and a press officer – while Obilale had to be flown to South Africa for 
emergency treatment after sustaining gunshot wounds in the lower back and 
abdomen.

"He has made extremely good progress," trauma specialist Ken Boffard told Talk 
Radio 702. "He is continuing to recover. He is awake, eating, talking and he is 
in good spirits."

The France-based goalkeeper had been in intensive care after the attack, which 
prompted his country to withdraw from the tournament.
