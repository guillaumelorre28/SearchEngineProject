Naomi Klein <https://www.theguardian.com/books/naomi-klein> delivered a 
stinging rebuke to Australia’s approach to refugees and climate change, as well 
as criticising interventions from the Institute of Public Affairs, in a fiery 
episode of ABC’s Q&A on Monday night.

The Canadian journalist, author and winner of the 2016 Sydney peace prize 
appeared on the panel alongside two panellists from the free-market thinktank 
the IPA, as well as Labor frontbencherAnthony Albanese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese> and writer Don 
Watson.

A dispute on climate change policy was provoked by a question from audience 
member Jim Stanford, an economist with the leftwing thinktank the Australia 
Institute.

When will your government accept that our energy system has to change?

Sandford asked James Paterson, a Liberal senator and former deputy executive 
director of the IPA: “When will your government accept once and for all the 
energy system has to change and start to lead that change rather than standing 
in the way of it?”


Paterson responded by saying he thought Australia should “take an agnostic 
approach to energy sources”.

Klein interrupted Paterson and asked, “Do you believe climate change is real?” 
to which Paterson said he did. Klein continued: “How can you be agnostic about 
which energy source you use if you believe in that?”

Interesting that @SenPaterson <https://twitter.com/SenPaterson> didn't try to 
paint#climate <https://twitter.com/hashtag/climate?src=hash> change as a hoax. 
IPA will retract his life membership.#qanda

She continued, laying into the IPA itself:

“I asked you if you believe in climate change and I asked you that because 
you’ve been associated with IPA. We have two people from this thinktank and 
this is the foremost organ in Australia for spreading climate change denial and 
doubt. You may personally not agree with that but the IPA publishes discredited 
climate change deniers, this year, in your facts book, and this is slowing us 
down.”

Kudos @NaomiAKlein <https://twitter.com/NaomiAKlein> for calling our TWO #IPA 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPA?src=hash> panellists out of 5 on #qanda

Georgina Downer, an adjunct fellow at the IPA, responded, saying: “The IPA is 
absolutely committed to research and discussion of the facts.” She then went on 
to question how settled the science of climate change is.

Downer said: “The IPA is, we don’t have an IPA opinion on climate change per 
se. We have a committed line of research into the facts.”

But Klein, who has written widely on the role of free-market thinktanks and 
neoliberalism in stopping the world acting on climate change said: “The reason 
that free markets thinktanks like IPA are so determined to raise questions, 
raise doubts about this issue, where there is overwhelming scientific consensus 
that climate change is real … If it is true, your whole world view collapses. 
This whole idea of pushing deregulation and privatisation and ‘government get 
out of the way’ falls apart because we need to manage this decline.”

Klein said Australia was virtually alone in its inaction on climate change. 

“Among wealthy industrialised countries, Australia now stands alone raising 
the middle finger to the world and saying that we’re not going to act and we 
will build massive new coalmines, huge natural gas pipelines in the Northern 
Territory, opening up vast fracking fields. These are carbon bombs. This is 
unburnable carbon. ”

She said the public “have to stand up to the extraordinary power of coal, oil 
and gas”.

Watson, an author and former speechwriter for prime minister Paul Keating, had 
a dry take on the same issue.

“It’s fairly simple to explain,” he said. “You do have a problem with the 
fossil fuel industry. No one wants to take them on. So you don’t. That’s it.”

Don Watson nails it on #qanda <https://twitter.com/hashtag/qanda?src=hash>:

Klein won applause for her rebuke of Australia’s policy on asylum seekers and 
refugees also.

Following a discussion of Donald Trump and his plans to build a wall on the 
border wiht Mexico, she said pointedly: “I think that Donald Trump talking 
about building the wall with Mexico is insane and racist. But I think what 
Australia is doing on Manus and Nauru is as well.”

Naomi Klein offered this answer before: the difference between offshore 
refugee camps & Trump's wall is that our atrocities are real#qanda

Klein said: “I think it’s outrageous. The New York Times called this proposal 
cruel, short-sighted and shameful. I hear this, I hear this argument that it’s 
‘We can’t send a message to the people smugglers’. What about the message 
you’re sending to refugees around the world? What message are you sending about 
Australia? And the implication that the only way people die is at sea. They die 
in war zones when they can’t flee. That’s why we welcome refugees.”
