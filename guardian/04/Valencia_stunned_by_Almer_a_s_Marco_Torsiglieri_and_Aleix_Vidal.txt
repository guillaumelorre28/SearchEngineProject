come-from-behind victory atValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>.

Without a win from their 10 league matches and coming into the game on a run 
of five successive defeats, the bottom club were priced as long as 28-1 by 
bookmakers to triumph. But, despite conceding a penalty to Jonas just after the 
half-hour, Francisco Javier Rodríguez's side produced a second-half fightback 
with goals from Marco Torsiglieri and Aleix Vidal.

The loss was Valencia's third in a row in the league and is likely to place 
their Serbian coach, Miroslav Djukic, under considerable pressure. This latest 
embarrassment comes after a 4-1 humbling at Villarreal on Sunday, a result 
Djukic claimed had led to a loss of morale among his players.

In front of their own fans at the Mestalla, Valencia struggled in the opening 
exchanges, barely creating a chance of note before the Brazilian midfielder 
Jonas scored his fifth of the season from the spot after Hernán Pellarano had 
handled in the area.

Two fine saves from Esteban Suárez either side of the interval to deny Juan 
Bernat and Javi Fuego kept Almería in the hunt until the hour mark, when they 
hauled themselves level.

On loan from Metalist Kharkiv, the Argentinian defender Torsiglieri rose to 
meet an inswinging corner from Suso to plant home a header from six yards.

Less than nine minutes later Vidal struck from 12 yards for his second goal of 
the season to put the visitors in front.

Helder Postiga then had two late chances to salvage a draw was unable to spare 
Valencia's blushes.
