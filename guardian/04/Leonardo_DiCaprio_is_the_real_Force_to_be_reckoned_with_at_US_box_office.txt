Alejandro González Iñárritu’s grim frontiersman tale scored a remarkable $38m 
in its first weekend on wide release, only just behind The Force Awakens’ 
$41.6m at No 1. The huge success story for the $135m film, whose budget 
ballooned from around $90mafter a troubled and controversial production process 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/director-defends-leonardo-dicaprios-the-revenant-as-crew-call-shoot-a-living-hell>
, came on the same weekend that DiCaprio was named best actor in a drama at the 
Golden Globes for his lead role. The Titanic star plays a 19th-century guide, 
Hugh Glass, who sets out for revenge after being left for dead following a 
brutal bear attack in the unsettled wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase.

The Hollywood Reporter said The Revenant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-revenant> had “vastly overperformed in 
its nationwide expansion thanks in no small measure to Leonardo DiCaprio’s star 
power”, while Variety described the actor as “one of the few consistent 
box-office draws in an era when star power is at its nadir”. Added Deadline: 
“Here’s what’s mindblowing: This is a gritty, bloody western that at a glance 
may look tough to sit through.”

“This was an incredibly difficult movie to sell,” studio executive Chris 
Aronson of 20th Century Fox told Variety. “[DiCaprio] has been in a lot of 
quality movies, but if you went in blindly, I don’t think you would say this is 
going to be one of the more commercial ones, but that’s where it’s going to end 
up.”

The Revenant now appears brilliantly positioned for next month’s Oscars, with 
Iñárritu also named best director (drama) at the Golden Globes.

The only other new film to make this week’s top 10 was horror The Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/08/the-forest-review-japan-aokigahara-natalie-dormer>
, starring Game of Thrones’ Natalie Dormer as a young woman who heads into a 
notorious Japanese “suicide forest” in search of her missing identical twin 
sister. Jason Zada’s film, which has been poorly reviewed, landed in fourth 
place with $13.1m on debut.
