Oakland A’s fans are entering full-on crisis mode after watching their team 
drop afifth game in six days 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2014-schedule-scores.shtml> and a 
13th loss in 19. Now the ballclub that spent 140 days in first place out in the 
American League West is battling to save what seemed like a dream season.

Right now the only thing Oakland can hang their hat on is the schedule – 
there’s still enough time to turn it around in the September stretch run, but 
the A’s confidence must be below sea level after seeing a four-game division 
lead melt into a five-game deficit to the surging Los Angeles Angels faster 
than you can sayConnie Mack. 
<http://www.trbimg.com/img-5314ee8a/turbine/hc-connie-mack-600px/960/960x461> 
Even bleaker, the A’s, who in a worst-case scenario seemed a virtual lock for a 
wild-card spot, are now facing challenges from the Detroit Tigers and the 
Seattle Mariners, who handed Oakland theirlatest frustrating defeat on 
Wednesday, 2-1. 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_09_03_seamlb_oakmlb_1&mode=wrap>

Jon Lester, who came over from Boston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/01/mlb-trade-deadline-deals-price-detroit-beane-boston>
 to be the A’s ace and stopper, did all he could to rescue his team, hurling 
eight innings and giving up just two runs. But those runs came courtesy of 
back-to-back seventh inning blasts from Kyle Seager and Corey Hart, home runs 
that helped Seattle overcome a 1-0 deficit as the M’s ace, Felix Hernandez, led 
them to the victory.

Once again it was Oakland’s offense that failed to deliver as the unit that 
bashed baseball’s pitchers for four months remained moored in minnow mode, 
averaging just 3.25 runs per game through August and September. Panic buttons 
pushed, general manager Billy Beane traded for 34-year-old free-swingingChicago 
White Sox slugger Adam Dunn 
<http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2014/8/31/6089751/adam-dunn-trade-athletics-white-sox>
 on Sunday, to try to replace what has emerged as an enormous gap in the lineup 
left by Yoenis Cespedes, who was traded away in the Lester deal done at the 
deadline. Dunn delivered on Wednesday …

… but, as its gone lately for Oakland, it wasn’t enough.


Oakland skipper Bob Melvin has been doing everything he can to try and keep 
his ballclub afloat, but even the normally cool, calm and collected BoMel 
couldn’t keep a lid on it after they weresteamrolled down in Anaheim last 
weekend. 
<http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_26444128/slumping-lose-fourth-straight-angels>
 The Halos ran rings around their rivals, sweeping a four-game series.
Your browser does not support iframes. 
What can you say? It was embarrassing. Pathetic. We don’t play like that. The 
last three games here are the worst I’ve seen this team play in … I can’t 
remember how long. I feel bad for our fans to have to watch that.

If Oakland can’t revert to their old Swingin’ A’s selves soon, their fans 
won’t have much more baseball to watch. Beane doled out top prospects in making 
“kitchen sink” trades designed to help him win that elusive World Series title, 
but if the downturn continues, he and his ballclub may never get that shot.

Meanwhile, down south …

No Garrett Richards, no problem – at least for now. The Angels lost their 
premier pitcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/22/mlb-angels-season-marred-injury-garrett-richards>
 to a knee injury in late August and have continued to roll through nearly all 
comers, winning 15 of 20 games while outscoring their opponents by more than 30 
runs. A big part of that success is the currentAL pitcher and rookie of the 
month 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140903&content_id=92937650&vkey=pr_mlb&c_id=mlb>
 Matt Shoemaker, an undrafted hurler who became the first Angels pitcher to 
throwseven or more shutout innings 
<http://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/la-sp-angels-athletics-elliott-20140901-column.html>
 in three consecutive starts since some guy named Nolan Ryan, 
<http://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/la-sp-angels-athletics-elliott-20140901-column.html>
 and that seems to make perfect sense to Halos manager Mike Scioscia:

When he’s on that mound he thinks he’s Nolan Ryan. Shoe is just getting an 
opportunity and he’s making the most of it.

No kidding. His ERA has plummeted 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shoemma01.shtml> from over four in 
early August to 3.15, making the Angels look good in their call to not bring in 
another arm to bolster the staff with Richards on the shelf. That could all 
change come October but for now the Angels are enjoying life on top of the AL 
West.

Meanwhile, the pressure of a pennant race doesn’t seem to be getting to AL MVP 
candidate Mike Trout. It was all fun and games for the Halos slugger, who took 
downHouston Astros <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/houston-astros> mascot 
“Orbit” this week.

Brew Crew off the wagon

The A’s aren’t the only club taking a massive hit – the Milwaukee Brewers have 
dropped eight straight games and fallen three games behind thoseSt Louis 
Cardinals <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/st-louis-cardinals> in the 
National League Central.

On Wednesday, Matt Garza returned from the disabled list after being sidelined 
for a month with a strained oblique muscle, only toget shelled by the lowly Cubs
 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_09_03_milmlb_chnmlb_1&mode=recap_away&c_id=mil>
 in a 6-2 loss, one which capped a series sweep for last-place Chicago at 
Wrigley Field. Now the team that spent nearly five months at the top of their 
division are just a half-game up on the miserable Atlanta Braves in the race 
for the second NL wild-card position. It doesn’t help that they’ll be without
offensive catalyst Carlos Gomez 
<http://www.si.com/mlb/2014/09/03/milwaukee-brewers-slump-carlos-gomez-injury> 
for a week or longer after the all-star center fielder injured his wrist on 
Sunday.

Catcher Jonathan Lucroy is trying to stay positive:

You’ve got to look at the bright side. We’ve been in first place all year. We 
battled it out all year. We’ve got a really, really good team here. I still 
think we’re the best team in the league … I have all the confidence in the 
world in these guys. Things are going to start going our way.

After a miserable 10-game road trip, the Brewers are back home at Miller Park 
this weekend for three games against the Cards, in their bid to get back on 
track while attempting to eat into the Redbirds’ division lead.

Patched up, ready to go

 Derek Jeter was good … very good. Baseball fans don’t need a patch to tell us 
that. Photograph: Peter Llewellyn/USA Today Sports 
On Tuesday, the Yankees announced that the team will don a Derek Jeter logo 
patch 
<http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/11455266/derek-jeter-honorary-patches-new-york-yankees-uniforms-caps>
 on their jerseys and hats starting Sunday, when the team retires his famed 
No2. The franchise also said that the players would continue to wear this patch 
until the end of the season.

In baseball, patches are almost always sewed (or heat-sealed) on to uniforms 
to commemorate recently deceased ballplayers, broadcasters and management. 
Derek Jeter is not dead. On the contrary, he is alive and well, and in fact I 
can confirm that I saw him playing baseball just this week. Rather amazingly,
despite his miserable season, 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jeterde01.shtml> he was still 
batting second in the line-up 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/joe-girardi-won-drop-slumping-yankees-captain-derek-jeter-batting-order-article-1.1925775>
, even as his Yankees tumbled towards a second consecutive playoff-less autumn.

The Derek Jeter patch will be worn by the team from Sept. 7 through the end of 
the 2014 season.#FarewellCaptain

<https://twitter.com/Yankees/status/506922298410954752> 
So why is a commemorative logo being put on to a jersey of a franchise that 
usually considers its pinstripes holy ground? I don’t even want to answer that 
question … it’s so obvious.It really shouldn’t be surprising 
<http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-jeter-and-the-yankees-one-last-homestand-could-be-the-difference-1409710258>
 that a team seeks to monetize absolutely everything it does, in an economic 
world where such moves are par for the course. However, it’s a shame that an 
all-out money grab has to be done in such an obvious and utterly lame fashion.

Bo knows unemployment

After years of losing, the Houston Astros are used to making headlines for the 
wrong reasons. This week, Bo Porter got a day off on Labor Day with many set to 
come, afterthe ‘Stros sacked their manager of less than two seasons 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/09/01/bo-porter-fired-astros-culture-jeff-luhnow/14928347/>
, in which 190 games were lost. The current general manager, Jeff Luhnow, said:

This decision was not made because of our current level of competitiveness in 
the Major Leagues. I recognize that our win-loss record is largely a product of 
an organizational strategy for which I am responsible. Rather, I made this 
decision because I believe we need a new direction in our clubhouse.

Such a move bolsters the idea that Luhnow came out on top in a battle for 
influence in the organization, and that owner Jim Crane will continue to back 
this long-term strategy of rebuilding through high draft picks. Of course, when 
undergoing a major rebuilding program it always helps if you can sign those 
picks, and so when the franchise became the first team in 31 yearsto fail to 
sign the first overall choice, which was Brady Aiken, 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/07/18/astros-no-1-pick-brady-aiken-fail-to-reach-a-deal/12857213/>
 not to mention their fifth-round pick, Jacob Nix, you had to wonder how that 
would effect Luhnow’s standing. Apparently not much. Tom Lawless, a roving 
instructor in their minor-league system, takes over for now asthe Astros flirt 
with another 100-loss season. <http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/>

A bad season for Justin Verlander got a whole lot worse this week. 
<http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/09/03/justin-verlander-heckled-nude-photos-scandal-detroit-tigers-game/>
 The one-time Tigers ace has been anything but his Cy Young/MVP self this year, 
and now Detroit’s limp towards a possible postseason spot has been complicated 
by hisleap into the gossip columns. 
<http://www.freep.com/article/20140901/SPORTS02/309010170/justin-verlander-kate-upton-photos>
 Nude pictures of the Tigers hurler and his girlfriend Kate Upton were part of 
the recent celebrity hack job that lit up the internet.

Good times.


On Tuesday, Verlander said:

I’m not going to comment on my personal life. I never have, and I never plan 
on it. I keep my personal life personal … the focus for me is on theDetroit 
Tigers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/detroit-tigers>. I don’t want to take 
any focus away from this team and what we’re trying to accomplish … we’re in 
the middle of a pennant race. We’re trying to win a pennant. And all of my 
focus currently is on doing whatever I can to help our team win our division.

Verlander was hammered in Cleveland on Wednesday, to the tune of six runs over 
6.2 innings pitched. 
<http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=340903105&teams=detroit-tigers-vs-cleveland-indians>
 Luckily for him only 11,739 fans turned up to watch his latest shelling, but 
that doesn’t mean he didn’t get a bit of stick from those in attendance. Mostly 
however, it seems to be coming from Twitter.
