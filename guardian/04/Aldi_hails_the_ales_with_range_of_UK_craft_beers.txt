Aldi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi> is to introduce 18 British 
craft beers at its stores as it capitalises on the bank holiday weekend.

Amid heightened demand for specialist beers, the discount supermarket chain 
will stock its shelves with brews such as Wet Your Whistle, White Witch and 
A-Hop-alypse Now from Sunday. It said the move would allow it to tap into a UK
craft beer

market worth £420m and predicted to reach £1bn by 2020.

The German retailer spent the past two years sourcing the beers from 15 
UK-based breweries, before selling them for £1.25 each in stores in England and 
Wales.

It added that the range was “carefully selected to celebrate provenance, 
artisan brewing and the exceptional beer produced across the UK”.

The breweries chosen include Wiltshire-based Wadworth

a fourth-generation family business that delivers ales locally in oak casks by 
shire horses.

Tony Baines, Aldi’s joint managing director of corporate buying, said the ales 
on offer were an eclectic mix and would be on sale at affordable prices.

“We’re delighted to be supporting the growth of some of the most distinguished 
regional breweries and microbreweries across the country,” he added.
