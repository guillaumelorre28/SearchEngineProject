Alcohol-related deaths in England have risen by 4% in a year and by 13% in a 
decade, according to figures published on Thursday.

Alcohol-related liver disease 
<http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)/Pages/Introduction.aspx>
 accounted for nearly two-thirds, 63%, of the 6,830 deaths in 2014, a total 
described by local councils as “shocking”.

Admissions to hospital where alcohol-linked disease or injury was the primary 
reason increased by 32%, to 333,000, between 2004-05 and 2014-15, said the
Health and Social Care Information Centre <http://www.hscic.gov.uk/home>.

Its new report, Statistics on Alcohol: England, 2016 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-alcohol-england-2016>, 
pulled together data from various sources to give a picture of the changing 
impact of alcohol consumption on health over time.

It revealed that diseases or injuries linked to drinking either as a primary 
reason or secondary diagnosis went up by 30,000, from 1.06m to 1.09m, between 
2013-14 and 2014-15, with men accounting for 65% of the total. This broad 
measure is regarded as the best indicator of the total strain alcohol places on 
national health.


Salford in Greater Manchester had the highest estimated rate of such hospital 
admissions, 3,570 per 100,000 population. Wokingham, Berkshire, had the lowest, 
1,270 per 100,000.

The report also said prescriptions for medicines to tackle alcohol dependence 
rose from 109,000 in 2005 to 196,000 in 2015.

 There was some comfort for the government, however: in a 2014 survey, 38% of 
secondary school pupils said they had tried alcohol, representing the lowest 
figure since surveys began in 1982, when it was 62%.

The report comes six months after the chief medical officer, Dame Sally 
Davies, recommendednew guidelines on alcohol consumption 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-alcohol-guidelines-show-increased-risk-of-cancer>
.

These reduced the recommended maximum weekly drinking limit for men from 21 
units to 14 units 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/mens-recommended-maximum-weekly-alcohol-units-cut-14>
, the same level as for women. They also recognised that any level of drinking 
increases health risks.

The Local Government Association said the figures were shocking. Izzi 
Seccombe, who holds its community wellbeing portfolio, said the figure of 
almost 1.1m for the broader measure covering alcohol-related admissions 
indicated a large number were from middle-aged and older age groups.

“Despite drinking comparatively little, older people consume alcohol far more 
often,” said Seccombe. “These figures warn of the dangers of regular drinking 
over a long period of time and the impact this can have on the body of an older 
person, which is less able to handle the same level of alcohol as in previous 
years.

“Many of us like to have a drink to relax and enjoy our free time, but 
councils are committed to helping people cut down how much they drink and how 
regularly, through supporting initiatives such as Dry January, to raise 
awareness and encourage small lifestyle changes, which can have a big impact on 
improving people’s health.”

Councils want more power to limit late-night bars and clubs, and have urged 
the drinks industry to produce more low-strength cider, wine, beer and spirits 
with fewer or zero units of alcohol.

The Department of Health <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> said: 
“Drinking among school-aged children is the lowest since records began – but we 
know that there is more work to be done to change behaviour across the whole 
population.


“Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol regularly carries a health risk for 
anyone, but if men and women limit their intake to no more than 14 units a week 
it reduces the risk of illnesses like cancer and liver disease.”
