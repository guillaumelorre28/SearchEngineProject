Winning tip: El Faro, Cadiz

A masterclass in traditional tapas. Fish picked off the slab is cooked as you 
wait in the cool, tiled bar (standing only). If you only eat one thing here it 
should be thetortillitas de camarones: fritters of tiny shrimps. They’ll burn 
your fingers but it’s so worth it.

Ajedrez Beach Club, Chipiona, Cadiz

A well kept secret tucked away down a dusty track, this is a superb chiringuito
, or beach bar, overlooking the spotless sandy beach of Las Tre Piedras between 
Rota and Chipiona. Chill out in an exotic atmosphere, complete with resident 
parrot Carlitos. Under the soft light from giant conch lamps, try the Asian or 
upmarket Spanish cuisine followed by one of Ibrahim’s mojitos as the sun sets. 
The only hard part is finding it, but once there you won’t want to leave.

Bienstar, Tarifa

There’s no better place to chill out than the Bienstar sunset terrace. Its 
magnificent location, overlooking crashing waves, makes the fresh lobster and 
sea bass go down a treat. On a good day, you can even see Africa.

Bolonia beach and Baelo Claudia

The stunning (and free to enter) ruins of Baelo Claudia are a great place to 
visit with the family, since they are mostly open, and children will have a 
great time playing on them. The rest of the day can be spent on the gorgeous 
white sands of the windy bay.

Bodega Tradición, Jerez

Jerez is famous for its bodegas but Bodega Tradición stands out. It has its 
own art gallery: an eclectic collection amassed by the original owner, boasting 
an El Greco, two Goyas and a Velazquez, plus other beautiful works. You get to 
savour superb wines and an art exhibition in one go.

Mountain biking, Los Alcornocales natural park, Tarifa
 Photograph: facebook.com/MtbTarifa 
There are many mountain bike trails in this, one of the largest cork forests 
in the world. Uphill efforts are rewarded with magical views of Tarifa, the 
Strait of Gibraltar and over to Morocco. Add the fragrance of pine trees and 
eucalyptus, migrating birds flying above you, and your expedition becomes 
priceless.

A beautiful small hotel in a hilltop village. The hotel tastefully draws on 
the owner’s travels in north Africa, which is a nice touch. Mint tea on one of 
the roof terraces watching the sunset was a highlight.

La Barrosa beach, Chiclana de la Frontera

Fantastic beach for all, including our young family. Parking is easy and there 
are gradual steps down to the sand where all signs of life are tucked behind 
the green dunes. A handful of small cafes are scattered along this vast stretch 
of beach.
