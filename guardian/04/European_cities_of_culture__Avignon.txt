From 1309-77, the Holy See was based here. Rival popes co-existed in Avignon 
and Rome from 1378-1417. The seven Avignon popes blew a lot of money on grand 
architectural gestures. The annual Avignon theatre festival has been held in 
the grandiose Cours d'Honneur of the Palais des Papes since 1947. The famous 
"pont", as in "sur le pont d'Avignon" was rebuilt in stone by Pope Clement VI 
who was as famous for what he ate as for what he built. At his coronation in 
1342, his party scoffed 7,428 chickens, 3,043 fowl, 1,500 capon, 1,195 geese, 
1,023 sheep, 914 kids, 180 oxen, 101 calves, 60 pigs, 10 tons of sugar, 50,000 
tarts and 95,000 loaves of bread. Not quite the miracle of the loaves and 
fishes, but this was France after all. The food's still impressive: try Le 
Grand Café behind the Palais des Papes. Cote du Rhone is the local tipple.

 Highlights: Art, photography and theatre in the Palais des Papes and l'Eglise 
des Celestines year round.

 July: Festival of Avignon.
