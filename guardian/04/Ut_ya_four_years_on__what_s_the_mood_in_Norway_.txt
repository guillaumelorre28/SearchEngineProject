For the first time since Anders Behring Breivik killed 69 people on the island 
of Utøya, youths are returning to attend its annual political summer camp.

Four years after the nightmare in July 2011, the youth organisation of the 
Norwegian Workers party (AUF) have invited people to return to Utøya. The 
summer camp was reopened in 2013 but has since taken place in different 
locations, until this year. More than 1,000 young people are expected to attend 
the camp, which runs from 7-9 August, with activities and seminars planned for 
the weekend.


We’d like to hear what the mood is like in Norway. How do you feel about the 
reopening of the summer camp at Utøya? What is the reaction like in the 
country? We’d also like to hear from those attending the camp to help us better 
understand howNorway <https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway> and Norwegians 
are affected by the event.
