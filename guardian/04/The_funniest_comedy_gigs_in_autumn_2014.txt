Cardinal Burns

Attention, fans of action-hero cabbies Hashtag and Bukkake or of Made in 
Chelsea spoof Young Dreams. The double actCardinal Burns

 make their debut UK tour this autumn, starting with a fortnight at Soho 
theatre. Before cult success with their dark, cinematic Channel 4 sketch show, 
this twosome (originally a threesome) were a popular live act on the Edinburgh 
fringe. Several of their TV alter egos were pioneered live onstage; now, the 
duo make a welcome return to their roots.

Having already played his part in the live comedy event of the year – the 
Monty Python reunion at the O2 Arena – Michael Palin embarks on his debut solo 
tour, tied in with the release of a new volume of diaries, Travelling to Work. 
The first half discusses his career in travel telly; the “slightly spontaneous, 
unstructured” second, his life in comedy.

Christie’s 2013 Edinburgh comedy award-winning feminist standup show, A Bic 
for Her, has already entered comedy legend – a bona fide phenomenon, it became 
the biggest-selling show ever at the Soho theatre. Then she made a followup 
that was, if anything, even better. Her first tour brings both shows together 
in a bumper, high-on-laughs, down-with-the-patriarchy double bill.

James Acaster

For three years running, James Acaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/31/james-acaster-edinburgh-festival-2014-comedy-normal-people-perve-solo>
 has been shortlisted for the Edinburgh comedy awards. With each passing year, 
his break into the big time looks more inevitable. Acaster’s 2014 offering, 
Recognise, is his best yet: another wonderfully written and structured hour of 
trivia-obsession, with the novelty that the Kettering native now tells us he is 
actually an undercover cop posing as a standup. That uber-gag supplies a 
mind-bendy frame for Acaster’s deliciously pernickety comedy.

Mark Watson

In his 10th year at the Edinburgh Fringe, Mark Watson’s show was one of the 
buzziest in Edinburgh, chronicling his early-mid-life breakdown. It addresses 
“self-esteem, self-worth, having children, the real world”. Weighty stuff, but 
critics hailed the show as the neurotic standup’s best in years. Now, the Mock 
the Week regular is taking it on the road.City Varieties

Simon Amstell

“I sort of feel now, being funny is my only real ambition,” Simon Amstell told 
the Guardian last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/10/simon-amstell-buzzcocks-suffering-interview-numb>
. Back then, he was trying to break America (sort of). Now, after a short 
preview run in Edinburgh, he’s off on another UK tour. To Be Free, the fourth 
show from the ex-Grandma’s House man, promises to explore “freedom, joy, love, 
death, adventure, art, peace, sex, regret, success, eating, suffering, 
dreaming, healing, forgiving and other areas”.Leicester Square Theatre, London 
WC2 (), 11 October,then touring <http://simonamstell.co.uk>.

Ahmed Ahmed

British comedy fans first encountered Egyptian-American standup Ahmed Ahmed as 
part of The Axis of Evil comedy tour in the early 2000s, for which he bagged 
the inaugural Richard Pryor award. Since then, he has directed and produced a 
documentary about touring that showed in the Middle East. But this is his first 
substantial UK run, a three-week stint in Soho showcasing Ahmed’s material on 
racism, Hollywood stereotypes and trying to date in his 40s.Soho Theatre

Few comedy acts inspire more devotion than the Mighty Boosh, so there will be 
no shortage of interest in this rare live tour from the freakier-deakier half 
of the surreal duo. Back in the day, Noel Fielding’s Eddie Izzard-meets-Syd 
Barrett solo standup bagged him an Edinburgh comedy award nomination. For his 
new tour, he’s joined by brother Mike – Naboo in the Boosh TV series – and Tom 
Meeten. As Fielding tweeted: “Come along and bring a horse who thinks he’s in 
Pussy Riot.”
