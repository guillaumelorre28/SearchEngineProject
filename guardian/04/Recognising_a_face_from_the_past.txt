The death of Muhammad Ali a week ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was another blow, in a year 
which has already seen the passing of David Bowie, Victoria Wood and Prince, 
among other beloved celebrities. A curious phenomenon that many people who have 
lost a loved one have experienced is the fleeting recognition of the deceased 
in a crowd. Facial recognition is a highly developed skill with its own 
dedicated brain area. When we look at someone, we use even the most detailed 
features in an attempt to identify them. Seeing someone you recognise – or 
think you recognise – can provoke a strong emotional response.

Because this neural machinery is so strong, once a face has been remembered, 
it’s very difficult to forget it, even if the person died many years ago. In 
fact, the emotional impact can hit even harder years later, when the erroneous 
facial recognition brings the past back with a jolt.

This is also why you can recognise people years after you met them, even if 
you cannot remember for the life of you who they are – and why we think 
strangers look like celebrities, whether they’re alive or dead.
