Alison Moyet <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alison-moyet>, who came to 
fame in the 1980s with pop act Yazoo, has proved an unexpected hit for listed 
record company Sanctuary, headed by Andy Taylor.

Moyet's new album Hometime last week clocked up sales of more than 100,000, 
turning it into a 'gold disc'.

Sanctuary's acts include Iron Maiden, Pet Shop Boys and Elaine Paige. The 
group is doing well, unlike some of its larger competitors.

EMI last year reported lower profits, missed revenue targets and complained 
about the problems of music piracy. But Sanctuary has issued a bullish trading 
statement and says that full-year profits will be at the top end of 
expectations.

Taylor denies that piracy is a serious problem and says the music majors are 
using it as an excuse to mask the fact that they have a dearth of decent 
material by artists with long-term futures. He blames the sector's dominance by 
conglomerates for squeezing much of the creative life from the business.
