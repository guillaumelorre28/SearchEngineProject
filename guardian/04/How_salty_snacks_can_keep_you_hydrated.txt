In warm weather, you may get tired of reminders to take a bottle of water with 
you on crowded trains or to stay hydrated at outdoor events. But what makes you 
thirsty and how else can you remember to keep topped up?

You might think you should avoid salty food when it’s hot. But actually, 
snacking on a few peanuts or pretzels in the sun can help to keep you hydrated.

It’s well known that the body sends a signal to the brain to drink more water 
when the balance of salt and water in your bloodstream needs diluting. This is 
measured and regulated by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. But if 
you eat peanuts, long before the salt has even reached your stomach, let alone 
your bloodstream, the brain has figured out what will happen next and generates 
a feeling of thirst.

The subliminal cues that lead to this reaction are multisensory: even looking 
at a picture of peanuts can trigger this reaction and remind you to drink water 
in hot weather. Keeping a few photos of salty snacks in your wallet along with 
a water bottle isn’t yet recommended by transport staff - but perhaps it should 
be.
