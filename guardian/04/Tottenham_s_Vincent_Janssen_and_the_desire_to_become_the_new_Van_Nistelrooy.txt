Vincent Janssen was 21 when he became the Dutch Eredivisie’s leading scorer. 
At that age his mother, Annemarie, had quit as a top swimmer. Five years 
earlier, in 1982, she had become the sport’s first Dutch world champion, in the 
200m freestyle, under her maiden name Verstappen. She was crowned sportswoman 
of the year.

In talking with Annemarie and Vincent, who on Tuesday joined Tottenham Hotspur 
from AZ

, for the Dutch paper de Volkskrant a couple of months ago, it immediately 
became clear where their mentalities overlap and differ.

In Vincent’s near-empty living room in Haarlem some of his individual trophies 
catch the eye. The striker is proud of them and motivated by them. His mother 
could scarcely be more different. “Her swimming medals are in the attic 
somewhere,” Vincent says. “Only the Jaap Eden trophy [for sportswoman of the 
year] is in the living room but she would prefer to put it behind the curtain.”

“I’m not one for the centre of the attention,” Annemarie says.

“I would have made a special altar for such a prize,” admits Vincent.

Annemarie was so fed up with her sport that for years she did not swim. “My 
youngest son, Sebastian, only found out I could swim when I was knighted some 
years ago,” she says, smiling.

She enjoys herself more in the football stadiums watching Vincent play than 
she did in the pool when all eyes were on her. “I look back on my swimming days 
in a very positive way,” she says. “But I felt too much pressure. I was so 
young, just 16, when I became world champion.”

Her performance was extra special because she swam in the era when East 
Germans reigned in the pool, although suspicions of doping surrounded them. “It 
was clear to me they were using [drugs],” she says. “In the locker room you 
heard all male voices but you knew the men put their clothes on at the other 
side of the building. Their arms and legs were hairy. That was frustrating, 
because you could not win.”

She managed to do so once, at those 1982 world championships in Ecuador. “They 
did not know me. I had a kind of suicide tactic: I made an extremely fast start 
and tried to keep it up till the end. By doing that I surprised them. But also 
myself.”

A boycott by communist countries of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles gave 
her the ideal opening but she failed to win a gold. “I was glad I made it [to 
the Olympics],” she says. “I felt the pressure constantly. My stomach was upset 
because of the tension. Everybody looked at me constantly, even when I went to 
get groceries. Sport psychologists weren’t common in those days, unfortunately.”

The swimming bug got hold of her daughters. Frederique hopes to qualify for 
the Olympics in four years. Like her mother, she specialises in short-distance 
freestyle.

Vincent spent time in the pool only on holidays and, his mother says, was 
“just fooling around”. Vincent says. “I found it really boring. I still do. 
Thirty seconds and it’s over. I try to support my sister but I can’t stand 
being in a hot swimming hall for too long.”

Annemarie reflects: “He swam like a dog – he just wanted to play football. 
When he returned from school, he had already played soccer on two fields. 
Totally hooked. His father is football-mad as well.”

The sports are not comparable. “Swimming you do individually, you make 
controlled movements, you train a lot harder and more often,” Annemarie says. 
“When Frederique comes out of the pool for the first time, Vincent is still 
lying in bed. But he is definitely not spoiled or lazy. For football training 
you’ll never have to encourage him.”

Vincent says: “I sometimes train extra till four or five o’clock at the gym if 
I feel that I have to do something extra. You have players who will only do 
what the coaches ask from them and then go home. Football has become more 
physical, which the Dutch teams noticed in recent years in Europe. You have to 
be strong if you want to have a chance against defenders of international 
clubs.”

He is benefiting from the work he has done. Last season was his first in the 
Eredivisie but he got better as it unfolded, scoring 21 of his 27 goals after 
the winter break and making his Holland debut at the end of March. He worked 
his way up to become the national coach Danny Blind’s first-choice central 
striker, scoring three times. “My body is strong,” he says. “And I have a 
strong will.”

Annemarie smiles: “Other boys in the street did not want to be in his team 
because he got very angry when he lost. If it took too long before he had the 
ball, he moved back to pick it up.”

He is a strong striker, she was a slim technician. “I will never do fun 
tricks, I just want to score that goal,” he says. “I’m always looking for it. 
More in [Luis] Suárez-style than Neymar-style, you could say.”

Annemarie says: “He knows exactly what he wants. I was different. When I was 
still in the lead at that golden world championships with 50 metres to go, I 
thought: ‘What’s this? I can become world champion? Who, me? I’d never thought 
of that. I was only 16. The road of Vincent and Frederique is more gradual, 
which is the best route, I think.”

At the age when his mother peaked, Vincent experienced a difficult phase in 
Feyenoord’s academy. “At my first clubs, TOP Oss and NEC, I was the one 
everybody looked at and talked about but at Feyenoord I was one of many good 
players. If you trained badly there, you got to hear it from everyone. I had to 
get used to that; also I picked up some injuries. In my last year at the youth 
academy everything finally went well. I scored a lot, we were champions. But I 
didn’t get a contract.”

A setback. “But I thought: ‘It’s not finished.’ I immediately thought of the 
next step.”

Annemarie says: “He was never in doubt whether he would make it or not. I can 
get quite worked up over a silly piece about him. He says: ‘Just don’t read 
it.’” Vincent adds: “When I did not score a lot at AZ in the beginning, many 
people said: ‘He can’t do it on this level.’ But I knew that, if I scored one 
goal, more would follow.”

He calls himself a self-made player. After Feyenoord he went to the 
second-tier club Almere City and not to his local club TOP Oss, because at 
Almere he could train twice a day. “That I’m so calm in front of goal is a 
matter of training. Finishing, finishing, finishing; all the time. I was always 
the last one in the dressing room after training and on my day off I asked if 
there was a goalkeeper who wanted to train with me. Sometimes other guys were 
complaining that they didn’t get a chance. I am not one for apologies. You have 
to make your own destiny.” Annemarie says: “That’s a difference with swimming. 
You cannot hide yourself – everything is clearly measurable.’

There are not many strikers in the Netherlands who play like Janssen. He is a 
one-man army, a team player and a goalscorer rolled into one. Ruud van 
Nistelrooy seems the best comparison. Vincent says with a smile: “He’s from the 
town of Oss, just like me. Well, I understand that comparison, although clearly 
I’m not at the same level as he was at his best, of course. He was also not 
supertechnical but tremendously focused and driven. I’m going to do everything 
for a career like he had. Even if I have to put my hand into fire.’

And he adds with a laugh: “Just don’t make me swim.”
