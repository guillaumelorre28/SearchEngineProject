Andy Murray beats Marin Cilic 6-3, 6-2!

Serving for the match, Murray reaches a Cilic drop volley and prods a backhand 
winner down the line for 15-0. He’s playing out of his skin now. A clever slice 
forces Cilic to scramble a volley into the net for 30-0 and Murray has three 
match points when the Croatian steers a backhand wide. Cilic nets a forehand 
and that’s that. The match belongs to Murray and I believe he’ll have the 
honour of playing Kei Nishikori on Wednesday. Thanks for reading. Good night.

Second set: Murray 6-3, 5-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Oh boy. At 15-all, 
Murray hoicks a defensive lob into the air and he’s rewarded for his 
persistence when Cilic wallops a smash wide. Soon Murray has two break points, 
Cilic netting a backhand, and he takes the first with a peach of a forehand 
winner. Murray will serve for the match.

Second set: Murray* 6-3, 4-2 Cilic (*denotes server): Just as he did in the 
first set, Cilic fancies his chances of breaking back straight away, pinging a 
backhand return past Murray for a 15-30 lead. But he’s not going to break 
playing this kind of tennis, two forehands sailing long to make it 40-30. 
Murray holds to 30.

Second set: Murray 6-3, 3-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Peeling backwards, 
Murray adjusts brilliantly and hooks a superb forehand winner down the line for 
a 0-15 lead. It’s 15-30 when Cilic nets a forehand, 15-40 when he aims wide 
with a slice down the line. Cilic saves the first with an ace. Murray takes the 
second with a forehand winner.

“One of the biggest differences in Murray this year I think has been that even 
when he appears out of sorts, he still finds a way to win,” Simon McMahon says. 
“We know he’s always been a great fighter, but where previously he would have 
let his frustration get the better of him, leading to loss of sets and even 
matches, his ability to grind out wins even when struggling shows one of the 
hallmarks of a No.1 player. As such his consistency is remarkable, even by his 
own standards. Though he wouldn’t be the same player if he stopped chuntering 
to himself and his box. Don’t ever stop that Andy.”

Second set: Murray 6-3, 1-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray enjoys a slice of 
luck on the first point, a fortunate net cord going his way and leaving Cilic 
stranded at the back of the court. 0-15. Cilic rattles through the next three 
points, though, to lead 40-15. Murray keeps him waiting, fighting back to 40-30 
when Cilic stoops and knocks a volley long, and then he makes it deuce with a 
fine backhand pass from left to right. Cilic bangs an ace down the middle and 
comes up with another snorting serve to hold.

Then, a good rally. Cilic wins it. Murray is forced to skitter and hit long. 
Soon Cilic has a break point, but Murray saves it with a swinging serve down 
the middle. In the end, Murray holds, Cilic going for too much.

forehand return wide.

Andy Murray wins the first set 6-3!

Serving for the set, Murray finds himself in a commanding 30-0 lead after 
forehand errors from Cilic. Then the Croatian nets a forehand, giving up three 
set points. Murray only needs one. Cilic misses a backhand return and the first 
set is Murray’s, although the world No1 has looked pretty nervy out there. He’s 
made 14 unforced errors. But Cilic has made 17.

First set: Murray* 5-2 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray’s making a lot of 
errors with his forehand, which helps to explain why Cilic still has hope in 
this set. He gets away with it at 15-all, Cilic barely able to believe his luck 
when what would have been a forehand winner clips the top of the net and flies 
past the baseline. Another errant forehand from Cilic takes Murray to 40-15, 
which has arguably been the story of this set, but two more errors sees the 
game go to deuce once more. Murray keeps Cilic at bay, though, and finds 
himself a game away from taking a rather drab first set.

First set: Murray* 4-1 Cilic (*denotes server): After three successive breaks, 
Murray could do with a solid service game here. He hasn’t served well so far. 
He’s not much of a rhythm when he’s had the ball in his hand and a 
double-fault, his third, makes it 15-all. Another poor forehand makes it 15-30. 
The quality is not high. Murray tells himself off, then produces a good serve 
to force Cilic to send a forehand return wide for 30-all. Murray manages to 
save another break point and the game goes to deuce, before the world No1 holds 
when Cilic lifts a slice wide.

First set: Murray 3-1 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray will be so annoyed with 
himself for letting go of that early advantage; he played some careless tennis 
in that service game. The Croatian’s level is inconsistent too. A double-fault 
makes it 15-30, a big serve makes it 30-all, a feeble forehand gives Murray a 
break point. Murray breaks again when a frustrated Cilic clips a forehand wide.

First set: Murray* 2-1 Cilic (*denotes server): Now Cilic begins to unwind 
with his forehand and Murray can’t hold back his power, huge blows earning the 
Croatian a 0-15 lead. The game goes to 30-all; Murray is already chuntering at 
the officials. Soon it’s deuce, for the second successive Murray service game, 
and he’s facing a break point when he messes up a simple forehand at the net, 
blootering it wide. Cilic has an immediate chance to break back. He couldn’t 
take break points in the opening game – but Murray gifts him this game, skewing 
a forehand wide.

First set: Murray 2-0 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray’s on the prowl at the 
start of this game, moving into a 0-15 lead when Cilic drags a backhand wide. 
Cilic wins the next point, though, before Murray uses up another challenge for 
no reason at all when the Croatian finds the line with a volley. The game goes 
to 30-all, though, and Murray earns his first break point when Cilic pings a 
backhand wide at the end of a tense 22-shot rally. It’s all he needs. Cilic 
sloppily nets a forehand and Murray breaks.

First set: Murray* 1-0 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point, 
Cilic knocking a backhand long, but the Croatian is quickly into his groove, 
settling any nerves by winning a lengthy rally with a huge swipe on the 
forehand side for 15-all. Murray follows that up with a double fault, wasting a 
challenge on the second serve, and that’s 15-30. He attacks the net on the next 
point but his chopped volley isn’t quite good enough and Cilic clumps a 
forehand past him to earn two break points. Murray saves the first, serving 
well, then Cilic squanders the send by sending a forehand long. After surviving 
that scare, Murray holds.

The warm-up is done. A brief retreat to the chair, a brief moment to sit and 
reflect and have a quick drink. Then they’ll be up and playing tennis. In fact, 
here they come. It’sAndy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>

Is it fair to say that Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> needs a big win over Novak 
Djokovic to truly cement himself as world No1? His detractors might say that’s 
the case, especially with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal out of the picture. 
What do you think?

Preamble

Number one! Number one! Number one! But for how long?

What a year it’s been for Andy Murray: Wimbledon champion again, the owner of 
two Olympic golds, a new father, the new world No1. For the first time in his 
career, Murray is looking down on the rest of his contemporaries after a 
breathless run of form that has gathered fearsome pace since the summer. It has 
been some effort from the Scot, who arrives in London looking to extend a 
19-match winning streak that has seen him recover from US Open and Davis Cup 
disappointment by picking up titles in Paris, Vienna and Shanghai, thereby 
ending Novak Djokovic’s long reign at the top of the rankings.

But Murray will know better than anyone else that a wounded Djokovic is a 
dangerous Djokovic.You get to the top of the mountain – but he can’t stop now. 
Djokovic is bound to be hot on his tail now, determined to wrestle that No1 
spot off his closest rival. If Djokovic wins every match this week, Murray will 
be back in the Silvio Dante role next Monday – so to stop that happening, the 
likelihood is he’ll have to beat the Serbian in Sunday’s final.

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, though. Murray has been placed in the 
tougher of the two groups and starts with a tricky one against Marin Cilic. He 
has generally had the Croatian’s number down the years and leads 11-3 in their 
head-to-head record, but Cilic was victorious when they met in the Cincinnati 
final in August. The world No7 and former US Open champion is not to be taken 
lightly, even though he has the Davis Cup final against Argentina to think 
about next weekend, not least because Murray has not always produced his best 
tennis at theATP World Tour Finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atp-world-tour-finals>. You suspect he’ll 
need to show why he’s the new No1 tonight.


Play begins at: 8pm GMT.

Serving for the match, Murray reaches a Cilic drop volley and prods a backhand 
winner down the line for 15-0. He’s playing out of his skin now. A clever slice 
forces Cilic to scramble a volley into the net for 30-0 and Murray has three 
match points when the Croatian steers a backhand wide. Cilic nets a forehand 
and that’s that. The match belongs to Murray and I believe he’ll have the 
honour of playing Kei Nishikori on Wednesday. Thanks for reading. Good night.

Second set: Murray 6-3, 5-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Oh boy. At 15-all, 
Murray hoicks a defensive lob into the air and he’s rewarded for his 
persistence when Cilic wallops a smash wide. Soon Murray has two break points, 
Cilic netting a backhand, and he takes the first with a peach of a forehand 
winner. Murray will serve for the match.

Second set: Murray* 6-3, 4-2 Cilic (*denotes server): Just as he did in the 
first set, Cilic fancies his chances of breaking back straight away, pinging a 
backhand return past Murray for a 15-30 lead. But he’s not going to break 
playing this kind of tennis, two forehands sailing long to make it 40-30. 
Murray holds to 30.
 
Second set: Murray 6-3, 3-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Peeling backwards, 
Murray adjusts brilliantly and hooks a superb forehand winner down the line for 
a 0-15 lead. It’s 15-30 when Cilic nets a forehand, 15-40 when he aims wide 
with a slice down the line. Cilic saves the first with an ace. Murray takes the 
second with a forehand winner.

“One of the biggest differences in Murray this year I think has been that even 
when he appears out of sorts, he still finds a way to win,” Simon McMahon says. 
“We know he’s always been a great fighter, but where previously he would have 
let his frustration get the better of him, leading to loss of sets and even 
matches, his ability to grind out wins even when struggling shows one of the 
hallmarks of a No.1 player. As such his consistency is remarkable, even by his 
own standards. Though he wouldn’t be the same player if he stopped chuntering 
to himself and his box. Don’t ever stop that Andy.”
 
Second set: Murray* 6-3, 2-2 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray holds to love. 
 
Second set: Murray 6-3, 1-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray enjoys a slice of 
luck on the first point, a fortunate net cord going his way and leaving Cilic 
stranded at the back of the court. 0-15. Cilic rattles through the next three 
points, though, to lead 40-15. Murray keeps him waiting, fighting back to 40-30 
when Cilic stoops and knocks a volley long, and then he makes it deuce with a 
fine backhand pass from left to right. Cilic bangs an ace down the middle and 
comes up with another snorting serve to hold.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-3, 1-1 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray drops the first 
point, netting a forehand, but Cilic lifts a slice wide to make it 15-all. 
Then, a good rally. Cilic wins it. Murray is forced to skitter and hit long. 
Soon Cilic has a break point, but Murray saves it with a swinging serve down 
the middle. In the end, Murray holds, Cilic going for too much.

Second set: Murray 6-3, 0-1 Cilic* (*denotes server): At 15-all, Cilic 
surprises Murray with some lovely serve-volley, dinking a forehand volley away 
to lead 30-15. A big serve makes it 40-15 and he holds when Murray pulls a 
forehand return wide.
 
Serving for the set, Murray finds himself in a commanding 30-0 lead after 
forehand errors from Cilic. Then the Croatian nets a forehand, giving up three 
set points. Murray only needs one. Cilic misses a backhand return and the first 
set is Murray’s, although the world No1 has looked pretty nervy out there. He’s 
made 14 unforced errors. But Cilic has made 17.

First set: Murray 5-3 Cilic* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, 
Cilic makes short work of it. He holds to love, crashing a forehand away, and 
piles the pressure on Murray.
 
First set: Murray* 5-2 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray’s making a lot of 
errors with his forehand, which helps to explain why Cilic still has hope in 
this set. He gets away with it at 15-all, Cilic barely able to believe his luck 
when what would have been a forehand winner clips the top of the net and flies 
past the baseline. Another errant forehand from Cilic takes Murray to 40-15, 
which has arguably been the story of this set, but two more errors sees the 
game go to deuce once more. Murray keeps Cilic at bay, though, and finds 
himself a game away from taking a rather drab first set.
 
First set: Murray 4-2 Cilic* (*denotes server): At 30-15, Murray becomes a 
little loose, trying a half-hearted drop shot that barely reaches the net. It’s 
his 10th unforced error, which is most unlike him. Cilic holds with his first 
ace.

First set: Murray* 4-1 Cilic (*denotes server): After three successive breaks, 
Murray could do with a solid service game here. He hasn’t served well so far. 
He’s not much of a rhythm when he’s had the ball in his hand and a 
double-fault, his third, makes it 15-all. Another poor forehand makes it 15-30. 
The quality is not high. Murray tells himself off, then produces a good serve 
to force Cilic to send a forehand return wide for 30-all. Murray manages to 
save another break point and the game goes to deuce, before the world No1 holds 
when Cilic lifts a slice wide.
 
First set: Murray 3-1 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray will be so annoyed with 
himself for letting go of that early advantage; he played some careless tennis 
in that service game. The Croatian’s level is inconsistent too. A double-fault 
makes it 15-30, a big serve makes it 30-all, a feeble forehand gives Murray a 
break point. Murray breaks again when a frustrated Cilic clips a forehand wide.
 
First set: Murray* 2-1 Cilic (*denotes server): Now Cilic begins to unwind 
with his forehand and Murray can’t hold back his power, huge blows earning the 
Croatian a 0-15 lead. The game goes to 30-all; Murray is already chuntering at 
the officials. Soon it’s deuce, for the second successive Murray service game, 
and he’s facing a break point when he messes up a simple forehand at the net, 
blootering it wide. Cilic has an immediate chance to break back. He couldn’t 
take break points in the opening game – but Murray gifts him this game, skewing 
a forehand wide.

First set: Murray 2-0 Cilic* (*denotes server): Murray’s on the prowl at the 
start of this game, moving into a 0-15 lead when Cilic drags a backhand wide. 
Cilic wins the next point, though, before Murray uses up another challenge for 
no reason at all when the Croatian finds the line with a volley. The game goes 
to 30-all, though, and Murray earns his first break point when Cilic pings a 
backhand wide at the end of a tense 22-shot rally. It’s all he needs. Cilic 
sloppily nets a forehand and Murray breaks.

First set: Murray* 1-0 Cilic (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point, 
Cilic knocking a backhand long, but the Croatian is quickly into his groove, 
settling any nerves by winning a lengthy rally with a huge swipe on the 
forehand side for 15-all. Murray follows that up with a double fault, wasting a 
challenge on the second serve, and that’s 15-30. He attacks the net on the next 
point but his chopped volley isn’t quite good enough and Cilic clumps a 
forehand past him to earn two break points. Murray saves the first, serving 
well, then Cilic squanders the send by sending a forehand long. After surviving 
that scare, Murray holds.
 
The warm-up is done. A brief retreat to the chair, a brief moment to sit and 
reflect and have a quick drink. Then they’ll be up and playing tennis. In fact, 
here they come. It’sAndy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> 
to serve first.
 
Murray got a standing ovation from the crowd when he emerged, even though he 
looks like he’s auditioning for a role in the army tonight.What a get up.
 
Remember, in the afternoon match, Kei Nishikori crushed Stan Wawrinka.

Is it fair to say that Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> needs a big win over Novak 
Djokovic to truly cement himself as world No1? His detractors might say that’s 
the case, especially with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal out of the picture. 
What do you think?
 
Number one! Number one! Number one! But for how long?

What a year it’s been for Andy Murray: Wimbledon champion again, the owner of 
two Olympic golds, a new father, the new world No1. For the first time in his 
career, Murray is looking down on the rest of his contemporaries after a 
breathless run of form that has gathered fearsome pace since the summer. It has 
been some effort from the Scot, who arrives in London looking to extend a 
19-match winning streak that has seen him recover from US Open and Davis Cup 
disappointment by picking up titles in Paris, Vienna and Shanghai, thereby 
ending Novak Djokovic’s long reign at the top of the rankings.

But Murray will know better than anyone else that a wounded Djokovic is a 
dangerous Djokovic.You get to the top of the mountain – but he can’t stop now. 
Djokovic is bound to be hot on his tail now, determined to wrestle that No1 
spot off his closest rival. If Djokovic wins every match this week, Murray will 
be back in the Silvio Dante role next Monday – so to stop that happening, the 
likelihood is he’ll have to beat the Serbian in Sunday’s final.

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, though. Murray has been placed in the 
tougher of the two groups and starts with a tricky one against Marin Cilic. He 
has generally had the Croatian’s number down the years and leads 11-3 in their 
head-to-head record, but Cilic was victorious when they met in the Cincinnati 
final in August. The world No7 and former US Open champion is not to be taken 
lightly, even though he has the Davis Cup final against Argentina to think 
about next weekend, not least because Murray has not always produced his best 
tennis at theATP World Tour Finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atp-world-tour-finals>. You suspect he’ll 
need to show why he’s the new No1 tonight.


Play begins at: 8pm GMT.
