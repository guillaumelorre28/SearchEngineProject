Two Indonesian pilots who appear to have been influenced by pro-Islamic State 
elements are being monitored by Australian Federal Police over concerns they 
may pose a security threat, an intelligence website says.

The alleged radicalisation of Ridwan Agustin, alias Hobi Panahan, and Tommy 
Hendratno, alias Tomi Abu Alfatih, was detailed in an 18 March operational 
intelligence report compiled by the AFP and obtained bywebsite The Intercept 
<https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/08/australia-tracking-indonesian-pilots-supporting-isis/>
.


The AFP report – marked “for official use only” – analyses Facebook posts by 
the two pilots that appear to support Isis.

The Intercept reports that Agustin formerly worked for AirAsia Indonesia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia>, while Premiair says Hendratno 
ceased working for them on 1 June.


Agustin graduated from the AirAsia academy in 2010 and flew international and 
domestic routes, the intelligence report states.


He began posting material indicating his support for Isis from September 2014 
– posts which Hendratno “liked”.


The AFP also noted that Agustin had commented on the page of Heri Kustyanto, 
who it’s believed left his Indonesian family to fight with Isis in Syria or 
Iraq.


At the time of the report, Agustin was active on Facebook as Hobi Panahan, was 
befriending radicals, and listed his current city as Raqqa, Syria.

The AFP report says Hendratno, meanwhile, lives in Bogor, near Jakarta, and 
was a pilot for the Indonesian Navy before Garuda and Premiair.


He had posted photos of trips around the world, including to Australia, but by 
December 2014 was posting pro-Islamic State material. His friends list included 
many military and commercial pilots.

The report concluded that pilots, if they become radicalised, were an obvious 
threat, “as witnessed by past global events” and noted that a recent edition of 
the al-Qaeda magazine had encouraged aviation attacks. Both men were trained 
pilots with contacts in the industry, it said.

The AFP distributed the report to partners in Turkey, Jordan, London, the US 
and Europol, The Intercept reported.


In a statement, the AFP said it did not comment on matters of intelligence.


“The AFP maintains strong relationships with its domestic and foreign law 
enforcement partners to ensure the ongoing safety of Australians both within 
Australia and abroad,” it said.


The Intercept was initially created to report on documents provided by NSA 
whistleblower Edward Snowden.
