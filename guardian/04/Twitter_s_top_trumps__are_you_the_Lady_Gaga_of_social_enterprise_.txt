Of all the pieces of advice I received at university, as I prepared to enter 
the competitive world of journalism, one rather hyperbolic statement has stayed 
with me: "If you're not onTwitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter>, you don't exist".

Two and a half years on I've sent more than 2,000 tweets and amassed the huge 
total of 390 followers in the process <https://twitter.com/joejervis89>, 
including influential social enterprise figures such asSEUK 
<http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/>'s Peter Holbrook 
<https://twitter.com/peteholbrook> and David Floyd 
<https://twitter.com/davidsocialsp> of Social Spider CIC 
<http://www.socialspider.com/>.

Yet despite my best efforts, I've failed to make a newly released list of the 
top 50 most connected tweeters in the world of social enterprise. Research 
commissioned by theGuardian Social Enterprise Network 
<http://socialenterprise.theguardian.com/> from social media consultancy 
Tweetminster <http://tweetminster.co.uk/> shows us which Twitter players packed 
the most punches during a three-month period ending earlier this year.

Tweetminster sought to identify the 1000 most active social enterprise Twitter 
accounts by searching for the tweeters who tweeted most about relevant terms 
such as #socent and social investment. These 1000 accounts were then analysed, 
with the "most connected" accounts being the ones with the most followers out 
of this group of 1000.

Using that methodology, here are the top 50 most connected organisations and 
individuals on Twitter in social enterprise – theLady Gagas 
<https://twitter.com/ladygaga> and Justin Biebers 
<https://twitter.com/justinbieber> of the socent world.
