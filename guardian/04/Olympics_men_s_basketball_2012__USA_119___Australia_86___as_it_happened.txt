Final Thoughts

As everyone expected, the USA eliminated Australia. As few people expected, 
and I include myself among them, Australia made a game of it all the way to the 
final quarter. While it never really fell in doubt, it never felt comfortable.

The keys for this game were pretty obvious:

1. LeBron James is running this team, and running this well. He did a bit of 
everything today, a lot of everything, including getting his entire team 
involved. Some triple-doubles seem more like quiet statistical oddities, it 
appears on the box score but it doesn't seem impressive live (I call these 
"Rondos"), but every bit of LeBron James's triple-double today (11 points, 11 
assists, 14 rebounds) came at a crucial time.

2. Kobe Bryant came back from the dead. Okay, that's a bit melodramatic I 
suppose, but after a poor Olympics showing and a dismal first half, Kobe just 
exploded with three-pointers like Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony before him.

So, Australia gave the USA their best, but it wasn't enough with LeBron and 
Kobe taking the game over. It happens. But we all know the true winner today:

@hunterfelt <https://twitter.com/hunterfelt> That guys prediction at the 
beginning was pretty close...he got Australia's score right.

<https://twitter.com/JThePedantic/status/233339885484900352> 
Yeah, that was pretty impressive. I'm going to ask him for lottery numbers the 
next chance I get.


Okay, that'll about wrap things up here on our end. Thanks to everybody who 
followed USA/Australia with us, and especially everybody who chimed in to 
contribute. Next up we have the semifinal game between the USA and Argentina on 
Friday at 4:00pm EST (9:00pm BST). That should be a dramatic game, and we'll be 
here covering it. Hope to see you there. Until then, ciao!

12.07am BST 

USA 119 - Australia 86, FINAL

And that will do it, the USA has eliminated Australia.


One last bit from Simon McMahon via email, with the headline "Good 
Vibrations": "A brave effort by the Australians, Hunter. But when one of your 
opponents has a Beach Boy for an uncle, you're really up against it. And 
although not strictly accurate, I will claim a moral victory for my prediction."


12.05am BST 

USA 112 - Australia 84, 1:34, 4th Quarter

Iguodala is in for the game and does what Kobe does: Hits a three. Westbrook 
goes a on a break and finds Harden for a dunk. Now it's all about the USA 
giving the crowd a show.

12.03am BST 

USA 109 - Australia 82, 2:47, 4th Quarter

Patrick Mills gets on the free throw line and makes them both, and here comes 
Anthony Davis who will be Rookie of the Year next year and is the Human Victory 
Cigar for Team USA.

12.01am BST 

USA 109 - Australia 80, 3:12, 4th Quarter

Or not. The USA takes out Bryant with his work pretty much over now. 

Love makes a layup and Harden makes a "this one is over" dunk. 

12.00am BST 

USA 102 - Australia 80, 4:30, 4th Quarter

Instead Kobe Bryant hits three straight three pointers. He now has 20 points. 
I guess Iguodala is staying on the bench.

11.59pm BST 

USA 96 - Australia 80, 5:17, 4th Quarter

NIelsen gets a bucket for Australia right out of the timeout. They're going to 
need to start going for threes soon.

11.57pm BST 

USA 96 - Australia 78, 5:52, 4th Quarter

LeBron gets the ball, runs down and passes it to Kobe Bryant for his third 
third. Australia takes a timeout. Do they have one last run?

11.56pm BST 

USA 93 - Australia 78, 6:13, 4th Quarter

I love Love. He takes one shot, swarmed by defenders. He misses it, but 
manages to get it back. He gets off another shot, which misses again, but he 
gets fouled and goes on the line. He makes one of two.

11.54pm BST 

USA 92 - Australia 78, 6:29, 4th Quarter

And as soon as I say that, Chris Paul misses a three, but Love manages to tip 
it in for two. Ingles has a steal and gets it to Mills for a three... and it's 
hit.

11.52pm BST 

USA 90 - Australia 75, 7:34, 4th Quarter

The three point shots are going in for Team USA, which is why I'm confident at 
this point that they have Australia beat. This time it's Deron Williams thanks 
to the eighth assist from LeBron James.

Mine too. Mine too.

11.50pm BST 

USA 87 - Australia 75, 8:22, 4th Quarter

David Andersen, who is pesky, gets to the rim and scores. Kevin Love can't 
finish on his end, and Barlow takes advantage by hitting a three.


11.49pm BST 

USA 87 - Australia 70, 9:01, 4th Quarter

Chris Paul hits a rainbow three to start the scoring of our final ten minutes 
here.

11.49pm BST 

USA 84 - Australia 70, 9:39, 4th Quarter

Paul Phillips emails: "Ingles may get a N.B.A gig out of this tournament !"

He very well could, he's Australia's best player right now and a big reason we 
have a relevant fourth quarter here.

11.46pm BST 

USA 84 - Australia 70, End of the 3rd Quarter

Deron Williams makes a few free throws, Ingles picks up two points via layup. 
Carmelo answers. And we're going into the third quarter with this one not 
wrapped up. Anthony Davis may have to wait on the bench for most of this one.

11.44pm BST 

USA 80 - Australia 68, 1:02, 3rd Quarter

Durant runs through Australia like he's Kitty Pryde phasing through walls in 
order to unleash a layup of his own. On the other end, Baynes answers right 
back. Wow this is a GAME, isn't it?

11.42pm BST 

USA 78 - Australia 66, 1:34, 3rd Quarter

LeBron James gets on the line, yes we're back to this business it seems.

11.40pm BST 

USA 77 - Australia 66, 2:09, 3rd Quarter

...But Carmelo Anthony hits a three.


11.39pm BST 

USA 74 - Australia 66, 2:48, 3rd Quarter

Ingles makes free throws to reduce the USA lead.
J D (@JThePedantic) 
@hunterfelt <https://twitter.com/hunterfelt> is Kobe missing or just not 
taking shots?
 <https://twitter.com/JThePedantic/status/233330094716887040> August 8, 2012 
<https://twitter.com/JThePedantic/status/233330094716887040> 
He didn't really get the ball a lot, and when he did, he turned it over. Those 
three-pointers apparently did pull him out of his funk at least temporarily.

11.38pm BST 

USA 74 - Australia 64, 2:48, 3rd Quarter

Brad Newley hits a long two that gets answered on the other end via some less 
glamorous free throws from Melo. Mills and Barlow both hit two jumpers to put 
the Australia within 10.


11.35pm BST 

USA 72 - Australia 58, 4:12, 3rd Quarter

Kobe's third three attempt doesn't go in, but LeBron gets the rebound, lays it 
up AND gets fouled for the three point play. He, however, misses the free throw.

11.34pm BST 

USA 70 - Australia 58, 4:44, 3rd Quarter

And Kobe just spoke up: He hits back-to-back threes exactly when Team USA 
needs him.

11.32pm BST 

USA 64 - Australia 58, 5:12, 3rd Quarter

David Andersen makes a layup to add to Australia's lead. LeBron James makes 
one of two on the line after getting fouled.

11.30pm BST 

USA 63 - Australia 56, 6:17, 3rd Quarter

Kobe Bryant gets to the line and hits two free throws. Speaking of Kobe:
Malaika Caldwell (@MsMalaikaEsq) 
@hunterfelt <https://twitter.com/hunterfelt> I don't think Kobe has 
disappeared he is the silent leader of the team and is doing only what he needs 
to do. Take pics!
 <https://twitter.com/MsMalaikaEsq/status/233328772445782017> August 8, 2012 
<https://twitter.com/MsMalaikaEsq/status/233328772445782017> 
Possibly, but now is the time when the USA needs him to speak up.

11.29pm BST 

USA 61 - Australia 56, 7:04, 3rd Quarter

Kobe, who has been having more difficulties this quarter, finally connects 
with Tyson Chandler. Australia's Dellavedova, however, responds with a 
three-pointer.

11.27pm BST 

USA 59 - Australia 53, 7:42, 3rd Quarter

The timeout also gives time to break down what Australia did: Mills opened the 
half with a three pointer, then made a steal on Durant for a layup. Ingles then 
made back-to-back three pointers.

11.25pm BST 

USA 59 - Australia 53, 7:42, 3rd Quarter

Durant hits a three pointer to stop the bleeding and the USA calls a timeout 
to slow things down a bit and right the ship.

11.24pm BST 

USA 56 - Australia 53, 8:07, 3rd Quarter

And it's all Australia to start of the third quarter. They go on a 11-0 
offensive run. Holy...


11.22pm BST 

Halftime

Doc Rivers complimenting LeBron James still makes this Boston Celtics fan's 
head spin. Him pointing out that Kobe Bryant has practically disappeared during 
these Olympics? That's about right.

Simon McMahon continues here: "Hello again Hunter. Been flicking through the 
basketball chapter of Goldblatt and Acton's 'How To Watch The Olympics' which, 
alongside the Guardian website, has been my constant companion over the past 10 
days. I couldn't help but notice that in the 1952 final the USA beat the Soviet 
Union 36-25 and, in the infamous match at Munich 20 years later the final score 
was only 51-50. That's roughly the half-time score here. Changed days."


1950s basketball is indeed a completely different beast than the modern game. 

11.18pm BST 

Halftime

And also from Dayjil Fincham:

"I’m stuck at work and can’t watch the game so thanks for the commentary!

As an Aussie I desperately want them to win but I think the dream team are 
just too good unfortunately L Prove me wrong Aussies!"


Glad you're enjoying it. We'll know a few minutes in whether Australia can 
stay with the US. And, hey, there is a USA/Australia match tomorrow on the 
women's side no matter what happens in this game.

Updated at 12.55am BST

11.11pm BST 

Halftime

Australia's still hanging around. But will Team USA make another one of their 
third quarter runs? They can turn close ones to blowouts in two minutes of game 
time.

We have emails:

Owen Linderholm shares some personal memories: "Used to watch Mills and 
Dellavedova down the road from where I live at St Mary's College in California 
- sort of a US college feeder program for Aussie basketball players. It's a 
good but not great college program that has been punching way above its weight 
- great place to go watch games. Astonishing to think the two of them are going 
against the US big guns."

Mills has definitely been the most impressive part of this game, although 
Ingles has shown something too.




11.07pm BST 

USA 56 - Australia 42, End of the 2nd Quarter

Mills gets a fast break going but LeBron James catches up with him on the 
other end, somehow (man can he run for a big man), and just prevents him from 
scoring. Then LeBron gets the ball to Kevin Love for a layup on the other end. 
Wow is he taking over this game.


Mills gets two more free throws on the other end for the last scoring of the 
first half.

11.04pm BST 

USA 54 - Australia 40, 56.3, 2nd Quarter

Ingles with a jumper helps add something to Australia's total. They're doing 
okay all things considered.

Deron Williams misses a three, and there's Ingles again. Chris Paul grabs a 
steal quickly on the other end... And there's a whistle on Nielsen. We're back 
at the free throw line, ladies and gentlemen.

11.02pm BST 

USA 54 - Australia 38, 2:14, 2nd Quarter

Deron Williams gets a jumper and Australia takes a time-out.

Updated at 11.02pm BST

11.01pm BST 

USA 52 - Australia 38, 2:42, 2nd Quarter

Carmelo and Deron go into three-point mode, they're definitely in "let's get 
some difference here" mode and taking advantage of the fact that Australia 
can't play the defense they want now that they're in such foul trouble.

On Australia's side, all they've been able to muster has been an Andersen 
tip-in.

Updated at 11.03pm BST

10.59pm BST 

USA 44 - Australia 36, 4:37, 2nd Quarter

Okay, now everybody's getting into a rhythm, with LeBron James who passes 
Charles Barkley for most career points in the Olympics, doing all the offensive 
work for the USA.

10.56pm BST 

USA 39 - Australia 31, 5:51, 2nd Quarter

Kevin Durant sneaks a ball from Australia with his long, long arms but Kobe 
gets for a travel. Australia can't do anything on that possession, but Matt 
Nielsen snatches the ball away from Chris Paul and makes a two-pointer. Mark 
Worthington then gets a basket after Durant misses a three. The USA are getting 
sloppy here and letting Australia back into this one.
Patrick D (@newscouch) 
@hunterfelt <https://twitter.com/hunterfelt> The hack-an-American strategy may 
not be such a bad idea given the USA's poor free throw percentage so far.

<https://twitter.com/newscouch/status/233318874299371520> 
True, but will they have any players left to finish the game? That's the 
growing danger here.

10.52pm BST 

USA 39 - Australia 27, 7:18, 2nd Quarter

David Anderson hits a jumper on his side to make up for his poor foul, and 
Kevin Love answers with a layup. Brad Newley and Deron Williams then exchange 
three pointers.

10.50pm BST 

USA 34 - Australia 22, 8:55, 2nd Quarter

Foul on Brad Newley. Referee dudes, just swallow those whistles. Let them 
play. Deron Williams tries to get a real, real long three. He misses but David 
Anderson runs into him with a really dumb foul to put Williams on the line for 
three free throws. He makes all three because of course he does.

10.48pm BST 

USA 31 - Australia 22, 9:22, 2nd Quarter

More free throws! Ingles hits one of two. Quick everyone, finish this game as 
fast as you can before EVERYBODY has fouled out.

10.47pm BST 

USA 31 - Australia 21, 9:40, 2nd Quarter

Kevin Durant starts the second quarter with... any guesses here? Yep another 
three.

Elizabeth Campbell writes:

"Thanks for the coverage. I might be a bit later to the party but what 
happened to our good player? Andrew Bogut, I believe. Do you know why he's not 
featuring tonight?"

Andrew Bogut had to pull out because of injury, which is (sadly) right in line 
with hisNBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> career so far.

10.44pm BST 

USA 28 - Australia 21, End of the 1st Quarter

Oh lord, is this really going to be one of those foul-heavy games isn't it? I 
HATE these. Mills misses his, but makes a layup on his own rebound. Maric makes 
one of two after getting fouled. Westbrook makes two of his own... And hey the 
last score of the quarter ISN'T a free throw as Patrick Mills swishes in a 
no-doubter to add two more points.

10.41pm BST 

USA 26 - Australia 16, 1:09, 1st Quarter

LeBron James is going for rebounds and assists rather than points, which is 
scary, because you know he can always score when his team needs it.

Patrick Mills fouls Deron Williams, and Australia really has to stop putting 
USA on the line here. Deron Williams makes his two free throws.

10.37pm BST 

USA 23 - Australia 16, 1:57, 1st Quarter

Kevin Love gets blocked on the floor, but still manages to maintain possession 
of the ball. He gets it to James who gets it to Westbrook. A nice nice sequence 
from the USA there. Love also makes another free throw to add to the 
non-scoreboard things he's doing here.

10.35pm BST 

USA 20 - Australia 16, 2:54, 1st Quarter

Australia takes a full timeout before Russell Westbrook gets a chance at the 
free throw line, making one of two.

10.33pm BST 

USA 19 - Australia 16, 3:09, 1st Quarter

Australia goes on a mini-run of its own to keep it close. Ingles gets fouled 
by 'Melo and makes two free throws and Aron Baynes tips one in himself.

Simon McMahon writes in: "Evening Hunter. I know very little about basketball, 
other than that the Americans are rather good at it, but here goes; USA 111 - 
86 Australia."

I could see that.

10.31pm BST 

USA 19 - Australia 12, 3:59, 1st Quarter

Durant and LeBron get in sharing mode. Durant helps Chris Paul for a layup, 
and LeBron throws a nice pass to Carmelo Anthony for a second layup. One more 
Carmelo free throw adds up to nice little USA run.
camdawggy (@camdawggy) 
@hunterfelt <https://twitter.com/hunterfelt> The number of junk punches the 
opposition throws is directly proportionate to the number of 3's Durant throws. 
Just sayin'.

<https://twitter.com/camdawggy/status/233313702479290368> 
That's a lot of punches. Ouch.


10.28pm BST 

USA 14 - Australia 12, 5:44, 1st Quarter

LeBron James gets fouled and gets both of his free throws. 

10.26pm BST 

USA 12 - Australia 12, 5:44, 1st Quarter

And another foul on Tyson Chandler, and another made free throw for Australia, 
which forces Coach K to put Carmelo Anthony in a little earlier than he wants 
to. They really don't want to lose their only true big for the game.

10.25pm BST 

USA 12 - Australia 11, 5:59 1st Quarter

Chris Paul gets a little jumper to give the USA a lead. The defense breaks 
down on the other end, however, and Ingles gets the easiest look for a bucket 
you could imagine. Tyson Chandler responds with a dunk (that's really good) and 
then a foul (not so good). Matt Nielsen makes one of his two free throws.

10.22pm BST 

USA 8 - Australia 8, 7:47, 1st Quarter

And Kevin Durant responds with, yeah, another three pointer. It's like the 
Argentina game never ended for him.

10.21pm BST 

USA 5 - Australia 8, 8:07, 1st Quarter

After a quick Australian basket, LeBron gives an assist to Tyson Chandler, but 
Pat Mills hits a three on the other end for Australia. And then another three 
and Australia gets a lead briefly.

10.19pm BST 

USA 3 - Australia 0, 9:23, 1st Quarter

Australia misses a three to start things off, and Kevin Durant hits one to 
continue things off. That's exactly what Australia doesn't want to happen.

10.19pm BST 

USA 0 - Australia 0, 10:00, 1st Quarter

Alright, hey we have the full game commentary and everything here. So far so 
good, NBA feed.

10.08pm BST 

Predictions

I see the USA winning this one fairly easily, but what do you think? Does 
Australia have a shot to pull an upset? Could they replicate what Lithuania did 
and keep it close the entire game? Will it be close in the second half like the 
USA/Argentina game? Will it be a blowout quickly?


You can email your predictions to hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com 
<mailto:mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com> or tweet them to 
@HunterFelt <http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt>and we'll use them here.

10.03pm BST 

Argentina/Brazil FINAL

Argentina has beaten Brazil 82-77, meaning that the winner of this game will 
indeed go on to face Argentina in the semifinals. If the USA do what their 
expected to do tonight, that means there's going to be a chance of a very, very 
chippy battle ahead of them. I recommend stronger cups for all players involved.

9.58pm BST 

Is there any sign of solidarity better than an entire team taking public 
transportation together?This shot  <http://instagram.com/p/OAbB8DNlUb/>of Team 
USA riding the London train system is almost perfect. It's definitely not 
something you would see these superstars do on their own in the USA.

Okay unless you count Shaq riding the MBTA in Boston dressed as a woman. No 
seriously.

9.44pm BST 

Preamble

The Olympic men's basketball preliminaries are over, and to the surprise of 
absolutely no one, the US team remains unbeaten. Today the knockout rounds 
begin, pitting USA against the Australian national team. More than most team 
sports, basketball is a postseason sport, the "win or go home" challenge forces 
all involved to take their game to a higher level. The next few rounds should 
make the previous games feel like preseason exhibition games, the stakes are 
that much higher.
Just how high are the stakes for Team USA? Well, despite the fact that they 
were undefeated in pool play, their preliminary rounds performance was still 
considered a disappointment. First, they received an unexpected challenge from 
unheralded Lithuania, who held a lead as late as the fourth quarter. Then, USA 
found themselves up only by one point against Argentina at the half before they 
were able to pull away in the third. The mere fact that not all of these games 
have been laughers has brought out the second-guessers who believe Team USA 
needs to make adjustments. Most notably,there's been some debate about whether 
or not Kobe Bryant, who has been a bit inconsistent, should be taken out of the 
starting lineup and replaced with Andre Iguodala because of his superior 
defense. 
<http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakersnow/la-sp-ln-la-london-olympics-kobe-bryant-should-keep-starting-job-20120807,0,941443.story?track=rss>
The good news for the American team is that they've also shown they can go on 
stretches of otherworldly dominance: Witness their historic blowout win against 
Nigeria or how they responded to Argentina's challenge with a second-half 
barrage of three-pointers. Ah, the three pointer. That's really the difference 
between Team USA struggling or shattering records. The trick to staying in the 
game with them is to hit the three-point shot early and often while hoping that 
they miss the three-pointers on their end. The strategy's drawback, however, is 
that if the USA starts making their threes, they are quite literally 
unbeatable. It's no coincidence that their best stretches of basketball were 
punctuated by ungodly three-point performances from Carmelo Anthony (against 
Nigeria) and Kevin Durant (against Argentina).
Australia, to put it mildly, has a lot to do if they want to pull off an upset 
of the ages. Australia does have some NBA experience, Patrick Mills currently 
plays for the San Antonio Spurs, and David Anderson has bounced around several 
NBA teams, but it's certainly a complete mismatch talent-wise. Here's how 
Yahoo! Sports' Dan Devinebreaks down Australia's chances: 
<http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/olympic-men-basketball-quarterfinal-preview-matchups-players-watch-014007467--oly.html>


Australia needs its best performance from everyone — the 39-point Patty Mills 
of the win over Great Britain, the 20-on-11-shots Joe Ingles and 
little-bit-of-everything Matthew Dellavedova of the win over Russia, the 
17-and-7 David Andersen of the win over China, etc. It needs the combo of 
rugged captain Matthew Nielsen and Gregg Popovich disciple coach Brett Brown to 
inspire the nastiest defense the Boomers can muster.

It needs bigs Aleks Maric and Aron Baynes to bang America's frontcourt early 
and often. It needs Team USA to play the brand of defense that nearly netted 
Lithuania an upset and kept Argentina close through two quarters. It needs 
multiple U.S. shooters — Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Chris 
Paul, Kevin Love, take your pick — to continue settling for 3-pointers and go 
ice-cold from long range. It needs USA coach Mike Krzyzewski to forget what the 
numbers say and refuse to go big.

If all that goes Australia's way, the Boomers should be within 15 in the 
fourth.


Ouch.

As far as the rest of the quarterfinals, earlier today Spain eliminated France 
66-59, ending Tony Parker and company's run. Before that, Russia took care of 
Lithuania 83-74. So, Spain and Russia will meet in the Semifinals, with the 
winner moving to the gold-medal game. Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina are 
facing off against each other while I'm writing this, with the winner going on 
to face the winner of this game. Me? I'm rooting for a USA-Argentina rematch 
after all the bad blood that's accumulated between these two teams.Carmelo 
Anthony's groin must be avenged! 
<http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/basketball/story/2012-08-06/team-usa-carmelo-anthony-cheap-shot-argentina/56830912/1>


Elsewhere: In the first round of the women's quarterfinals, the US women's 
team throttled Canada 91-48. If you're surprised at that score, you haven't 
been paying attention to just how good this US women's team is. The great 
Jackie MacMullen, pretty much my absolute favorite basketball writer ever, has
made a compelling case that it's the US women's team that's the true "Dream 
Team" in this Olympics 
<http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/espnw/story/_/id/8243821/2012-summer-olympics-us-women-london-real-dream-team>
. In any case, the women's team is moving onto the Semifinals tomorrow against, 
oh hey look who it is again, Australia at 12:00pm EST or 5:00pm BST.
