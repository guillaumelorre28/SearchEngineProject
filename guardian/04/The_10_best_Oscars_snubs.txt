Maugham

’sOf Human Bondage <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g-w5cuWI5o> was critically 
hailed as a landmark – yet Warner Bros studio politics (she broke contract to 
make the picture) cost her a best actress nomination. The outcry prompted a 
(since-revoked) rule change: voters could overrule the nominees by writing in 
an alternative on the ballot paper. Davis’s “write in” hype actually saw her 
enter the ceremony as the favourite, though she lost to the official nominee, 
Claudette Colbert, forIt Happened One Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/it-happened-one-night-film-review>
; later, voting tallies revealed Davis only placed third. She won the next year 
for negligible work in the hoary melodramaDangerous 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaPUjinFgek> – a transparent makeup award if 
ever there was one.

A routine entry on these lists, certainly – and one that has led to How Green 
Was My Valley <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cogJkmF7nJ8>, John Ford’s 
gentle, often lovely portrait of a Welsh mining village, being needlessly 
disparaged in “worst Oscar winners” roundups. But even at the time, its 
victories for best picture and director (Ford’s third) represented a clear vote 
against a new generation. They respected 26-year-old wunderkindOrson Welles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/orsonwelles>’s scorching media treatise 
enough to give it nine nominations, but on the night, could only muster up a 
screenplay win for Herman J Mankiewicz and Welles — a collaboration so famously 
brittle that merely rewarding Welles for it seemed something of a jab in itself.

1951

In 1951 no one had seen a screen performance quite like Brando’s in A 
Streetcar Named Desire <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqhXBSW0Zns>: as 
Stanley Kowalski, his sweat-stained sexuality and method mumbling announced a 
new generation of Hollywood leading man. The Academy was certainly impressed by 
the acting in theTennessee Williams

andKim Hunter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/13/guardianobituaries.arts> all took 
home the gold, making it the first film in Oscar history to win three acting 
awards. But what of its freshest, most forward-looking performance? There, the 
old guard won out, as Brando’s best actor campaign was stalled by a sentimental 
surge for the never-honouredHumphrey Bogart

Garland had won a miniature Oscar for her youth performance in The Wizard of Oz
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU>, but she craved the real thing – 
and when rave reviews rolled in for her gutsy tragic-musical turn in George 
Cukor’s definitive version of backstage chestnutA Star Is Born, it seemed she 
would get it. Unable to attend the ceremony, having just given birth, Garland 
was sufficiently confident of victory to have a camera crew set up in her 
hospital room for the announcement. But she reckoned without the Academy’s 
predilection for bright-eyed ingenues, asGrace Kelly

Julie Andrews’s Tony-winning stage performance as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair 
Lady made her a star, but she was deemed insufficiently famous to repeat the 
role on screen, as Jack Warner enlisted Hepburn’s gracious (albeit less 
golden-voiced) services instead. Andrews’s seemingly lesser consolation prize 
was the title role in Disney’s family filmMary Poppins 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLkp_Dx6VdI> – no match, surely, for Warner’s 
lavishly produced blockbuster. Yet whileMy Fair Lady 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbebD653agE> duly notched up eight Oscar wins, 
including best picture, Hepburn was shut out of the best actress race, 
allegedly penalised by voters for failing to do her own singing. All of which 
greased the wheels for Andrews’s victory for Poppins: among the crueller cases 
of karmic logic in Academy history.

Hashtags weren’t a thing a quarter-century ago: had they been, #OscarsSoWhite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/oscarssowhite-mocks-awards-show-inequality>
 might have been coined way back then, when the Academy took major industry and 
media heat for largely failing to acknowledgeSpike Lee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee>’s incendiary cross-section of 
racial tensions over one steaming Brooklyn afternoon. The Los Angeles Critics’ 
Association named itthe year’s best film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/28/spike-lee-to-get-honorary-oscar-25-years-after-do-the-right-thing>
, yet Oscar voters deemed only Lee’s screenplay and Danny Aiello’s supporting 
performance worthy of nominations; it lost both. Adding insult to injury, the 
year’s big winner was the whitest civil rights fable imaginable, Bruce 
Beresford’s cornballDriving Miss Daisy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ3wXC5jqKE>. At least Lee received an 
impromptu, riled-up tribute at the ceremony — from the unlikely source of 
presenter Kim Basinger.

Bacall was the unassailable best supporting actress frontrunner in 1996, or so 
everyone thought. Her performance asBarbra Streisand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbra-streisand>’s acidic mother in the 
drearyThe Mirror Has Two Faces <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixawX2G4Zc8> 
may have been diva-by-numbers stuff, but at 72, the Old Hollywood legend had 
never so much as been nominated. Who was going to deny Bacall her belated 
moment in the sun?Juliette Binoche 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/juliette-binoche-sils-marie--interview-ruthless-depardieu-wanted-to-kill-me>
, that’s who. In perhaps the biggest upset in Oscar history, the startled 
33-year-old Frenchwoman surfed a wave of acclaim – and expert Harvey Weinstein 
campaigning – forThe English Patient 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SEp2FQYS84> all the way to the podium. Had 
Bacall’s prickly industry reputation cost her? “Where are you?” Binoche called 
out from the stage after paying apologetic tribute. Bacall did not identify 
herself.

It’s a moment that will live for ever in clip reels of Oscar low points: Jack 
Nicholson’s raised eyebrows as he opened the best picture envelope and read, in 
a tone of arch incredulity, “Crash <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yAwVFaBQS4>
.” Everything was set up for Ang Lee’s aching cowboy-meets-cowboy romance to 
score an LGBT milestone by taking the top prize: mass critical acclaim and 
mainstream media coverage, more than $80m at the US box office, a near-clean 
sweep of the precursor prizes. But rumblings emerged that many of the greying 
Academy’s more conservative members were uncomfortable with the film’s gay 
content – and were proven correct when Paul Haggis’s ham-fisted, 
everyone’s-a-little-bit-racist parable emerged victorious. Losing at all was 
painful enough. Losing to one of the category’s clunkiest winners? A needless 
twist of the knife.

Superhero adventures – much less sequels to superhero adventures – have never 
really been the Academy’s cup of tea, but afterChristopher Nolan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan>’s stylish, grimmed-up 
Batman adventure became a critical and commercial phenomenon in the summer of 
2008, many pundits thought an exception was in order. Many branches of the 
Academy agreed, as the film notched up a formidable eight nominations – only to 
be squeezed out of the best picture race byStephen Daldry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-daldry>’s tepidly reviewed 
Holocaust dramaThe Reader <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3EN7vh3fH4>. 
Academy bosses heard the loud ensuing complaints about their out-of-touch 
snobbery: months later, in a blatant grab to accommodate more populist fare, it 
was announced that the top category would be expanded from five to 10 nominees.

The best director race in 2010 was an all-star gallery of revered American 
auteurs on the indie-mainstream precipice:Darren Aronofsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/darren-aronofsky> for Black Swan 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXM1mcZuibI>, the Coens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers> for True Grit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/13/true-grit-coen-brothers-review>, 
David O Russell <https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-o-russell> for The 
Fighter <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2pqELFTepw> and that year’s critical 
favourite, David Fincher forThe Social Network 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLsM1z8lX_A>. As Fincher racked up one 
precursor award after another, including the Golden and Bafta, it seemed to be 
his year – until a journeyman outlier, the British TV directorTom Hooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hooper>, scored the crucial Directors’ 
Guild prize for his workmanlike handling ofThe King’s Speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/the-kings-speech-review>. Oscar 
followed suit, and has seemed sheepish about it ever since: Hooper was 
conspicuously omitted whenLes Miserables piled on the nominations two years 
later, and never got a whiff of traction forThe Danish Girl
