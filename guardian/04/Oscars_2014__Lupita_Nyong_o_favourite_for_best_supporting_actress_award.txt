It's the hardest-fought battle at this year's Oscars: the sweetheart versus 
the unknown; the freewheeling comedy masterclass versus the heart-wrenching 
showreel.

But Lupita Nyong'o <https://www.theguardian.com/film/lupita-nyong-o>, the 
31-year-old actor who plays Patsy in Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, looks to 
have the edge over American Hustle's Jennifer Lawrence, also up for best 
supporting actress at the 86th Academy Awards.

Nyong'o began as the favourite, but as Slave's stock fell slightly in the face 
of Gravity's dominance, the Hustle actor appeared to have gained ground, 
winning the category at both the Golden Globes and the Baftas.

Two days ago, odds on Nyong'o rose to 5/6 compared to Lawrence's 5/4. 
Following her Independent Spirit Awards win on Saturday night, and the
unprecedented rescinding of the prediction by a top Oscars pundit

for a Lawrence win, Nyong'o is now at 8/13, with Lawrence at 9/5.

The Oscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> ceremony starts at 1:30am 
GMT.
