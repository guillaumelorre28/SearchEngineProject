with judges saying that it was "the first and the best" and that it "set the 
pace early on and continues to dominate the newspaper website field."

described as "journalism through the medium of Twitter at its best", and judges 
said that the iPad edition was "beautifully delivered ... iPad should be paying 
them."

news, features and sports coverage."
