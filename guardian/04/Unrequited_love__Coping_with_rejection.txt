From an anonymous, 23-year-old male
Dear Carole, There is a girl in my office who joined about eight months ago, 
we started talking to each other and used to text each other almost the whole 
night after work. We went out a couple of times and I gave her a gift on her 
birthday. Everything was going great.

Suddenly she told me one day that she was uncomfortable talking so much and 
going out as her family is very reserved and she is not that fast kinda girl. 
We stopped talking so much.

A couple of weeks ago she started talking normally again and replying to my 
text messages. One day I asked her out to dinner and she gave me the excuse 
that her team members would feel bad if she didn't go out with them. I was very 
disappointed and told her in anger that she doesn't care how I feel. I said I 
blamed her that she used to talk to me when she was newly joined and didn't 
have many friends in the office and now she doesn't care for me at all.

Since that day she hasn't even spoken to me. Please help me find out what's 
going on in her mind. We used to be so close when she used to text me every 
second minute, I don't understand her sudden change in behaviour. I really love 
her!!

Carole replies:
You need to see this from the young woman's point of view. Yes, she was 
friendly towards you, but I would predict that she was equally friendly to 
everyone else in the office, and if others had texted her she would have 
reciprocated just as she did with you. The reason she was friendly is not 
because she felt attracted to you but because she was new.

To avoid inbreeding, young adult female apes usually leave their birth group 
and join a new, unrelated group.1 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v337/n6202/abs/337070a0.html> Lone young 
females newly arrived in an established group must ingratiate themselves and 
work their way up the patriarchal hierarchy. For a human primate, this is no 
easy manoeuvre. It appears that you took advantage of this woman's social 
vulnerability at a time when she needed friends (not sexual partners).

At first she indulged your advances. You were an unknown quantity, she was not 
familiar with the office culture and she didn't want to cause offence. She 
didn't know who held influence, so she hedged her bets and played for time. 
Eight months down the line this woman now knows the score. She knows your 
opinion of her has little or no bearing on her social rank and survival 
chances, and thus she is no longer prepared to indulge your attention-seeking 
behaviour.

She tried to distance herself from you but you pursued her and kept texting. 
She spoke to you and tried to let you down gently by making lame excuses. This 
was the moment when, for both your sakes, she needed you to empathise and 
understand. But still you didn't get the hint and back off.

You escalated things and fell into a trap from which few men in Western 
society can free themselves unscathed. (Strictly patriarchal Eastern and 
African societies tend to accept this type of male behaviour.) You succumbed to 
the common male ape behaviour of coercion.2 You wanted control over her, you 
became angry and intimidated her in an attempt to force her into guilty 
submission. You have made yourself objectionable and now she is entirely 
justified in not talking to you and she probably has the support of her 
colleagues in this.

You need to improve your mating strategies. Do you really want a girlfriend 
who is only your girlfriend because she has been harassed by you? Would a 
submissive, guilty girlfriend do it for you? Your lack of self-awareness is the 
problem here. You alone are responsible for your feelings in this scenario and 
you have got to try and rise above your basic urges to save your self-respect.

There is a large body of primate research on the evolutionary origins of 
aggressive male sexual jealousy,3

 covering the strategies of rape, harassment, intimidation and monopolisation 
of time â€“ referred to as "mate guarding". Males usually behave in these 
sexually coercive ways around fertile females they want to impregnate. These 
strategies can be observed in all ape species, but less so among gorillas, who 
live in harems with a dominant silverback male. Sexually aggressive male 
behaviour has evolved as an adaptation to living in multi-male, multi-female 
societies where there is a lot of choice in mating opportunities but also a lot 
of sexual rivalry.4

These sorts of sexually aggressive male behaviours are more often exhibited by 
low-status males. High-status males who have repeatedly shown kindness, and are 
high status due to their mix of good genes for intelligence and physical 
stamina, are more likely to have females soliciting them for sex rather than 
their having to harass or rape in order to mate.

You say you love her, and a component of love is altruism, but you don't seem 
to be showing much altruism here. Yes, you gave her a birthday present, but 
with the strings of sexual coercion securely attached. It's good to give, but 
don't ever give to receive. Instead notice when your giving isn't reciprocated 
and adapt, and if necessary cut your losses.

You could apologise to her for bullying her, but that might invite accusations 
of sexual harassment. Instead, I suggest you keep a respectful distance from 
this woman. Be friendly to her but no more so than you would be towards anyone 
else in the office. Do not text her again.

You need to reinvent yourself, and as a young male of 23 years you can do 
that. Improve upon your social and intellectual skills, perhaps take up night 
classes in varied subjects. This way you will raise your social status and make 
yourself more attractive to the opposite sex. If you do so you will discover 
how much better it feels to be pursued by ardent females compared with how it 
feels to be a rejected pursuer.

Good luck.
