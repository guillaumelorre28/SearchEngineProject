Hundreds of thousands of Chileans took to the streets throughout the country 
on Sunday, seeking to increase pressure on the government to throw out Chile’s 
private pension system in favour of one that would provide better benefits.

Under the current system, which was started in the 1980s during the 
dictatorship ofAugusto Pinochet <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet>, 
six private pension funds, known as AFPs, manage $160bn (£122bn) in assets.

 Opponents of Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile>’s private 
pension system say it forces workers to give their earnings to for-profit funds 
that do not ensure a dignified old age for all Chileans.

 “We expect the president and her government to open a dialogue and listen to 
the citizens of the country, and not just the owners of the AFPs,” said Luis 
Mesina, a spokesman for a group called No More AFPs, which organised the march.

The organisers said 350,000 marchers took part in the protest in the capital, 
Santiago. Local police put the number at 80,000.

 Some marchers carried signs reading “Chileans Ripped Off”.

President Michelle Bachelet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/michelle-bachelet> has offered a plan to 
hike the pension contribution rate by five percentage points. That would cost 
about $3.8bn a year, with the state paying $1.5bn, the government said earlier 
this month.

 But the protesters said they wanted the current system dismantled. Any 
reforms must be passed by congress, where there is broad support for boosting 
pensions.
