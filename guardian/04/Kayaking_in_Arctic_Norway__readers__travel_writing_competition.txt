Curtains! It has taken me a few minutes to realise there is something 
essential missing from the cabin room. A prerequisite in the land of the 
midnight sun, one would imagine. But apparently not in Svalbard, where the 
summer sun circles above the boreal archipelago in an endless loop 24 hours a 
day.

The curious sense of unbalanced time here in the Arctic Circle has left my 
body clock out of kilter, and a niggling impression of the surreal. The view 
from the curtain-less window in the middle of the night confirms this, an alien 
vista of rock and ice that sparkles in the raw northern sun.

I am in Billefjorden, a two-hour boat ride north of the world’s most northerly 
town, Longyearbyen, lodging in a modest wooden cabin at the foot of the 
Nordenskiöld glacier. It is the setting for a week of adventure that will allow 
me to explore the remote terrain.

After a safety briefing from our Norwegian host Magnus (his rifle is a 
necessity, he explains, for the polar bears who sometimes come sniffing around 
the cabin) our group of seven – a mix of Finns, Australians, Kiwis and Brits – 
shuffles down to a small bay to don waterproofs before heading out on to the 
fjord in kayaks to get a closer look at the colossal glacier.

As I close in on the looming glacier, my kayak receives a heavy thud and 
shudders from bow to stern. I have hit an iceberg, and there are hundreds more 
scattered ahead in the cold, still sea. The stakes have been raised; navigation 
has instantly become a perilous exercise.

Yet my concentration cannot drown out the overpowering feeling of peace here 
at the top of the world. After resorting to pushing the giant misshapen ice 
cubes away with my oar, I see a clear path open up ahead, and the temporary 
respite allows me to absorb the scene.

The Arctic silence is loud, close to absolute silence, and it is an arresting 
and moving sound

The Arctic silence is loud, and I strain my ears to take it all in. It’s not 
often you hear something close to absolute silence, and it is an arresting and 
moving sound. The tall, blunt mountains that surround me have an otherworldly 
presence, and the almost complete lack of vegetation exposes intriguing 
geological contours that bring to mind a Martian coarseness.

My reverie does not last. Too soon I’m interrupted by another warning from our 
guide: “Don’t get too close to the glacier, Chris! It’s been calving a lot 
recently.”

Right on cue, the mighty river of ice lets forth a thunderous explosion. A 
huge wedge of ice bursts from the glacier’s brink and plunges into the sea, 
accompanied by a deep roar and a crash of waves that lasts for several seconds 
after the event.

Luckily, I am far enough away to avoid anything more traumatic than a 
temporarily unsteady canoe, but the experience is a revelatory one. The glacier 
is retreating, spitting itself into the sea like a cornered animal hissing at 
its aggressor. I look to the spot on the glacier’s sheer face where the calving 
has taken place and notice that the freshly exposed ice is a gorgeous neon 
blue, electric in its crispness.

Magnus explains that this distinctive hue is a result of 1,500 years of 
glacial compression, and as freshly dislodged chunks of sharp blue ice drift 
past me, I’m reminded of the fragility of this stunning environment.

The tranquillity here is a vulnerable one, its delicacy written all over the 
stark landscape. I almost feel like an intruder, walking in on Mother Nature 
with her clothes off. Should I really be here if there’s a chance an endangered 
animal will be shot if it comes to close to our party? Exactly how much of my 
carbon footprint is contributing to the dramatic crumbling of this ancient 
natural monument?

I do not get much time to contemplate these ethical minefields before we set 
off across the bay to investigate a small abandoned mining town, a relic of the 
Soviet era which was once held up by the USSR as an example of the success of 
communism.

We spend days hiking in the mountains or relaxing in the lodge, listening to 
the glacier break apart and playing with the husky dogs, Nanuk and Bellman. 
Dried expedition food, which we rehydrate with hot water, keeps us fuelled by 
day, adding to the sense of adventure and exploration, while by night Magnus 
cooks fish, pasta and rice on a small gas stove.

 Basecamp Spitsbergen 
One evening, as we glide steadily across the fjord, I remember the curtain 
dilemma awaiting me upon my return to the sparsely furnished cabin bedroom. 
This is a first-world problem indeed – and one that will most likely be 
remedied with application of the hefty Scandinavian throw I happened to notice 
lying across the foot of the bed. Yet it would seem remiss of me to conceal 
myself from the spectacle outside, of a naked Mother Nature, exquisite and 
undisguised.

What you see is what you get, and the nagging guilt I feel at being in such a 
susceptible place is drowned out by the sensation that I am somewhere raw, 
somewhere real, somewhere temporary. If I do manage to get some sleep tonight, 
I imagine my dreams will be penetrated with the brittle lure of what lies 
outside the window.

We are going climbing high up on the glacier tomorrow. And as much as I would 
relish the chance to encounter a wild polar bear, I find myself hoping that he 
will stay away.

It occurs to me that not everything needs to be witnessed first-hand in order 
to understand the nature of a place. Svalbard is one of those places.
