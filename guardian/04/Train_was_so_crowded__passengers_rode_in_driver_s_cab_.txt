A rail company is investigating claims that one of its trains was so crowded 
that passengers had to travel in the driver’s cab for part of their journey.

The incident allegedly happened on one of last Saturday’s services run by 
Arriva <https://www.theguardian.com/business/arrivabusiness> Trains Wales.

Arriva Trains Wales said on Wednesday: “We are currently investigating an 
allegation that passengers were travelling in the driver’s cab on one of our 
trains.

“Despite our services being extremely busy over the weekend, passengers would 
not be allowed to enter and travel in the driver’s cab for safety and security 
reasons. Safety remains our first priority.”

The company went on: “On the weekend following Christmas we did all we could 
to provide as much extra capacity as possible across the whole of our network 
with the trains we have available.

“Over the weekend we ran over 1,300 services across our extensive network. On 
Saturday December 27 and Sunday December 28 Virgin Trains were not running any 
train services to and from North Wales due to Network Rail’s improvement work 
between Watford and London Euston, which put extra pressure on this part of the 
network.

“Some of our services were extremely busy however trains are built to robust 
industry standards recognising that peaks will occur due to the 
unpredictability of customers’ travel patterns and there are no defined upper 
limits on the number of customers permitted to travel on board a train.

“While we did everything we could to provide extra capacity, we would like to 
apologise to customers whose travel plans were inconvenienced last weekend.”
