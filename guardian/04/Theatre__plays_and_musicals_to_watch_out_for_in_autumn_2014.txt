Romeo and Juliet <http://homemcr.org/production/romeo-and-juliet/>

When they opened in 1906, Manchester’s Victoria Baths were “the most splendid 
municipal baths in the country”. They served the people of Manchester for 87 
years before falling into disrepair. Now the empty swimming pools provide the 
setting for a promenade staging of Shakespeare’s tragic love story, retold as a 
contemporary fairytale set in eastern Europe’s criminal underworld. A Balkan 
choir and a uniquely atmospheric setting should make this a Romeo and Juliet 
less ordinary.Lyn Gardner

Hamlet <http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/event.aspx?id=839>

As powerful on stage as she is popular on TV, Maxine Peake will become one of 
the few women ever to tackle Shakespeare’s longest role. She’s reunited with 
director Sarah Frankcom, who steered her in the 2013 Manchester International 
Festival hit The Masque of Anarchy. Few female actors get the chance to play 
the role which Max Beerbohm described as “the hoop through which every eminent 
actor must, sooner or later, jump”. Peake is unlikely to disappoint.LG

The Gathering/Yr Helfa <http://nationaltheatrewales.org/gathering-yr-helfa>

Hafod Y Llan is a working hill farm in the foothills of Snowdon. For the last 
three years, director Louise Ann Wilson, Wales’ national poet Gillian Clarke 
and artists from National Theatre Wales have been observing the annual cycle of 
sheep-farming. The result is a walking performance inspired by the local 
landscape and the people and animals who live and work there. Sturdy boots, 
waterproofs and an ability to tackle challenging walking conditions are not 
normally required of theatre-goers, but are essential here.LG

Home Sweet Home <http://www.freedomstudios.co.uk/projects/home-sweet-home/>

What is it like to be in old in the UK today? Britain’s population is ageing, 
but how old is really old? 65? 75? 90? Inspired by the experiences of older 
people from Bradford, this immersive show puts eight people aged 60 to 82 on 
stage alongside a professional cast and tries to confront the fears and 
assumptions made by us and policymakers around old age. The Ukrainian Women’s 
Choir will be participating in a production that should be of interest to all.LG

Teh Internet Is Serious Business

Tim Price, who wrote the excellent The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning, 
takes on the highly topical subject of hacktivism. A 16-year-old schoolboy and 
an 18-year-old Shetlander meet on the internet, take on the FBI and threaten to 
disrupt the world order. Hamish Pirie directs a play to be accompanied by 
discussions and debates.Michael Billington

On the eve of the poll in which the people of Scotland will decide on their 
future, the National Theatre of Scotland celebrates Scotland and its 
contribution to the world through the spoken and written word. Conceived and 
directed by Graham McLaren, the show, which features live music and lasts from 
noon to midnight, brings together artists, actors, politicians, journalists and 
sportspeople to choose and read their favourite texts written by a Scot.LG

Kristin Scott Thomas <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristin-scott-thomas>
 stars as Sophocles’s murderous heroine who joins with her brother, Orestes, to 
avenge their father’s death. Given that Scott Thomas is directed by Ian 
Rickson, with whom she worked on Pinter’s Old Times, that this is a new version 
by the prolific Frank McGuinness and that Diana Quick is also in the cast, this 
promises to be a blood-tingler.MB

Love’s Labour’s Lost/Love’s Labour’s Won 
<http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/loves-labours-lost/>

If the latter sounds unfamiliar, it’s because it’s an alternative title for 
Much Ado About Nothing. But what’s intriguing is Christopher Luscombe’s desire 
to link these two Shakespeare comedies by the theme of war. The first will be 
set in the spring of 1914, the second in the autumn of 1918 as soldiers return 
from the trenches. Edward Bennett and Michelle Terry star in what looks an 
imaginative pairing.MB

Sea Breeze <https://www.liveatlica.org/whats-on/sea-breeze-2014>

What if buildings had eyes and ears and could talk? The walls of the iconic 
but decaying Winter Gardens theatre on Morecambe’s seafront come alive with a 
little help from Raisin & Willow and Lancaster’s Imitating the Dog, whose 
cunning mix of film and theatre are often more like conjuring tricks than any 
other art form. The audience is seated on the stage, and light projections, 
found film and music and storytelling are employed in an eerie poetic piece 
that includes local choirs and a new arrangement of Elgar’s The Weary Wind of 
the West, which premiered at the Morecambe Festival in 1903 when the Winter 
Gardens were in their heyday.LG Winter Gardens, Morecambe (liveatlica.org

This immersive musical has been described as “Evita on disco” and a 
“poperetta”. The disco queen at its heart is Imelda Marcos, the former first 
lady of the Philippines, whose rise and fall is charted in David Byrne and 
Fatboy Slim’s club-style theatrical experience. Put on your dancing shoes.LG

contemporary performance. Forced Entertainment collaborate with Lebanese sound

Sharrocks’ brilliant Museum of Water takes over Moseley Road Baths; and Tania

Phyllida Lloyd follows her all-female production of Julius Caesar with another 
single-sex take on a conflated version of the two parts of Shakespeare’s

The Infidel <http://stratfordeast.com/the-infidel-the-musical>

The search for great new British musicals goes on, and this comedy, based on 
David Baddiel’s movie, may fit the bill – it tells the story of a British 
Muslim man who discovers that he was adopted and that his birth parents were 
Jewish. Kerry Michael directs a show that could have the subversive appeal of 
US hit musicals such as Book of Mormon and Avenue Q but with a particularly 
British slant.LG

The Scottsboro Boys <http://scottsboromusicallondon.com>

A West End transfer for this superb Kander and Ebb musical, first seen at the 
Young Vic in 2013, about nine black teenagers wrongly convicted of rape in 
Alabama in 1931. On their eventual release, some of the boys ended up working 
in a minstrel show, and the show cleverly uses this conceit. A production by 
Susan Stroman that reminds us that musical theatre can be as abrasive and 
hard-hitting as any other theatrical form.LG

A delightful musical about a family holiday to forget, this show lifted its

Tim Firth and directed by Daniel Evans, it’s a rueful, magical look at the

For my money, Ten Billion, in which Katie Mitchell collaborated with scientist 
Stephen Emmott to explore the population explosion, was the most important 
theatrical moment in years. Now playwright Duncan Macmillan has worked with 
another top climate-change scientist, Chris Rapley, and Mitchell to create a 
work that looks at the impact of environmental catastrophe on our children and

into an epic play that will attempt to capture Boo’s documentary realism and 
compassionate humanity. Meera Syal heads a big cast and the piece will be

Pirates have never been as appealing as they are in Robert Louis Stevenson’s 
shipshape story of adventure, mutiny, black spots, cheese and treasure. Bryony
