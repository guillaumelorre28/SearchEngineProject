the Activate church, have set up apledge website <http://www.sharemytaxcut.org/>
 where donors can pledge their $6 tax cut every week to one of 10 high-profile 
charities.

“If you earn over $80,000 you just got a tax cut of $6/week,” the website 
says. “75% of Australians miss out on this, including millions of Australians 
for whom $6 can make a big difference.

“Rather than buying an extra coffee or two, many of us would prefer that our 
tax cuts helped people who could really use it.”

Khondaker said they had come up with the idea after listening to people 
suggesting the tax cuts were unfair but individually would not amount to much. 
“I wanted a platform where people could do something tangible rather than just 
talk about it,” he said.

“We know that philanthropy is no replacement for a fair tax system – and so 
want to make it possible for like-minded Australians to help make our nation 
fairer.


“If you’re a person who’ll benefit from these changes and believe that money 
would achieve more if it were spent empowering people at the other end of the 
income spectrum – helping people with disabilities find stable employment, 
providing support for vulnerable young people and serving victims of family and 
domestic violence – we’re inviting you to share your tax cut for the sake of 
Australia’s future.”

The website is simply a pledge system, which will record the pledge and then 
direct the donor to one of 10 nominated charities. Week after week, the amounts 
will be aggregated and reported.
