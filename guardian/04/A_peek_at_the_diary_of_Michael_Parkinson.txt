Spent the morning with the BT engineer, who insists there isn't a problem with 
the answerphone. "There must be," I fumed. "It's been days since the Radio 
Times last called to ask me to tip a bucketload of pique over the state of 
British telly."

"No," he said. "The only messages were that wrong number, and Tarby asking you 
to join him, Kenny Lynch and Bobby Davro in a fourball."

"Can you believe talents like that are languishing off our screens?" I sighed. 
"Yet Ant and Dec work!" He fiddled with his car keys. "Yet Ant and Dec work!" I 
repeated. "Oh, never mind. You're from that wretched generation who haven't 
been taught when to laugh at my jokes."

"Like I say, your phone's working fine," he said. "Perhaps it's just that no 
vulnerable reality star has died of cancer or been admitted into psychiatric 
care. Jade Goody and Susan Boyle were gifts to you, weren't they? What was it 
you said about Jade – 'ignorant and puerile'? And her not three days in the 
ground."

So he did know my work after all. "Cut me in half," I twinkled winningly, "and 
the words 'straight-talking Yorkshireman' run through me. Even though I live in 
a mansion in Berkshire, and recently engaged the famous pit village solicitors 
Carter-Ruck to sue my unemployed cousin for advancing a different account of my 
family than the one in my autobiography, Parky: My Autobiography."

But he was already on the way out. And blow me, if I didn't hear him mutter 
"Paging Emu" on the way.
