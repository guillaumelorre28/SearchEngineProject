A Sydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> naturopath 
charged with allegedly giving advice to a mother who almost starved her 
eight-month-old baby to death has appeared in court.

Marilyn Pauline Bodnar, 60, is charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily 
harm and aiding or abetting the boy’s mother, who cannot be named for legal 
reasons, in failing to provide for her child.

On Friday, Magistrate David Degnan rejected a bid from Bodnar’s defence to 
have witnesses including the boy’s mother and doctors cross-examined during the 
committal.

Police allege the mother sought health treatment advice from Bodnar about her 
baby’s eczema and was advised to stop all medical and dermatological treatments 
for her son.

In May last year the baby was admitted to hospital with severe malnourishment 
and developmental issues.

The Leppington naturopath has previously pleaded not guilty to the charges.

She refused to comment when reporters questioned her as she left court on 
Friday.

The mother has pleaded guilty to failing to provide for her child, but has had 
a grievous bodily harm charge dropped.

Bodnar’s bail was continued and her case was adjourned to return to 
Campbelltown local court on 6 July.
