Located in the heart of Melbourne’s western suburbs lies Sunshine, a suburb 
with a strong working class history that is in the process of shrugging off its 
reputation as one of Melbourne’s rougher neighbourhoods, through gradual 
gentrification.


At the turn of last century when the area was known as Braybrook Junction, 
industrialist Hugh Victor McKay established the Sunshine Harvester Works. He 
bought 400 acres of surrounding land, and provided key infrastructure and 
services such as electric lighting, public buildings and housing, to encourage 
workers to settle nearby. The Sunshine Harvester Works became the largest 
manufacturing plant in Australia, and in 1907 local residents successfully 
petitioned to rename the locality Sunshine, in honour of McKay’s contribution.

These days, Sunshine is a culturally diverse suburb with food to match. For 
example, if you need to stock up on Eastern European ingredients, stop by the 
delightful Roli Poli Delicatessen (1 City Place, Sunshine, 03 9311 4077).

 Banh cuon, the signature dish at Xuan Banh Cuon. Photograph: Claire Davie 
Every now and then you come across a dish that is bewitching, you'll cross 
town again and again, just to order it. For me, the banh cuon at Xuan Banh Cuon 
is such a dish: delicate rice paper crepes, steamed until translucent, then 
rolled with a filling of wood-ear mushrooms, tiny prawns and pork minced 
in-house. They're topped with crisp onions and pork floss, and served with 
sliced pork loaf, fresh greens and nuoc cham dipping sauce (there’s a 
vegetarian version too).

The short menu offered by mother and daughter team Xuan and Jen Dinh includes 
other interesting northern Vietnamese dishes, but consider yourself warned: 
once you've tried the slippery, flavour-packed delights of the banh cuon you'll 
find it difficult to choose anything else.

Pho Hien Saigon
 Sunshine's fantastic pho from Pho Hien Saigon. Photograph: Claire Davie 
If Sunshine could be said to have a signature dish, it would be pho. For the 
last couple of years the Sunshine Business Association has been hosting a 
Sunshine Pho Fever event as part of theMelbourne Food and Wine Festival 
<http://www.melbournefoodandwine.com.au/>, with several local participating 
restaurants.

Of these, the pho at Pho Hien Saigon is particularly good: the aromatic broth 
is crystal clear, the result of 12 hours of simmering. Somewhat unusually, it's 
made by simmering chicken broth and beef broth separately then blending them at 
the end. The brightly-lit restaurant recently doubled in size and pho is the 
main attraction, but if you visit on a Sunday you can also order banh xeo, an 
enormous stuffed pancake.

The Vu family behind the curiously named Queen's Rose the Sun, hails from 
northern Vietnam. Their menu includes a number of interesting dishes you don't 
often see in Melbourne's Vietnamese restaurants. Highlights include the nem 
chua ran, Hanoi-style deep fried rice paper parcels filled with pork, mushrooms 
and vermicelli, and the hu tien mi kho, a combination of egg noodles and rice 
noodles served dry with a side bowl of broth and topped with plump prawns and 
grilled pork skewers. Rest assure, they also serve a very decent pho.

There are several Gold Leaf restaurants in Melbourne, but the branch in 
Sunshine arguably does the best yum cha. The restaurant is a vast, glittering 
palace, with a cleaver-wielding chef standing behind a counter festooned with 
lacquered roasted poultry near the entrance. Order a serve of said lacquered 
poultry, and be sure to grab a serve of the steamed eel if you see it rattle 
past on a trolley.

While the yum cha offerings at Gold Leaf are varied and plentiful (and on the 
pricier side of things for Sunshine, it must be said), do try to save enough 
room for dessert: as well as silken tofu in ginger syrup and gloriously flaky 
daan taat (egg tarts), there are retro Western favourites like cubed jelly and 
mango pudding drizzled with sweetened condensed milk.

 Sandwich and mil hoja pastry at La Morenita. Photograph: Claire Davie 
Marco is Chilean, his wife Maria is Uruguayan, and together they run a gem of 
a South American bakery and cafe in Sunshine North, La Morenita. Tip: look for 
the sign that says Empanadas Las Peñas. They sell baked and fried empanadas and 
hearty Chilean sandwiches as well as grocery essentials like tamales, arepas 
and Chilean wine imported by Marco’s father. Get your sweet fix by buying one 
of the alfajores (biscuits) or mil hojas: a South American version of a 
mille-feuille, where the layers of pastry are filled with manjar (Chilean dulce 
de leche) rather than crème pâtissière.
