A new TV sitcom, Damned, started on Tuesday night on Channel 4. The series 
created by Jo Brand, whose mother was a social worker, follows the lives of a 
team of social workers as they juggle case loads and messy personal lives.
Brand‚Äôs aim was to portray social workers as real people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/23/damned-jo-brands-new-sitcom-finds-the-humour-in-social-work>
 as she believes that all too often, TV shows resort to stereotypes when 
featuring social work professionals.

The first episode, which also stars Alan Davies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-davies>, sparked a big response 
on social media, with not all believing Brand achieved her aim. Here are some 
of our favourite comments so far.

Katharine Curtis via Facebook: ‚ÄúI personally welcome and even celebrate seeing 
something so light-hearted and warm on my TV where social work is concerned. 
Sick of the panoramas and dispatches we needed this. Well done Jo Brand!‚Äù

@GdnSocialCare <https://twitter.com/GdnSocialCare> Thought ground down/burnt 
out Alan Davies, rule-bending Jo Brand, & cost-cutting mgr were fairly 
accurate. Amusing in parts.

Hmmm I don't recognise this at all. For a start I've not seen anyone do any 
work yet. My team never stop.#Disappointing

The most unrealistic part of #Damned

tea!

"I don't need a helpline. I need someone to go to Lidl." And her response is 
why social workers are so flippin great.#Damned

<https://twitter.com/Channel4> "it's not my job to care" - this will resonate 
with SWs in authorities where numbers often matter more than people

#Damned <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Damned?src=hash> - mixed reviews among 
colleagues. For those expecting hilarity, accuracy & instantly improved public 
image - an underwhelming start.
