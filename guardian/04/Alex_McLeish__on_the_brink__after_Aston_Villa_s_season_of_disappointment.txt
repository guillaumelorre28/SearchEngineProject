The Aston Villa manager Alex McLeish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/alex-mcleish> is on the brink of leaving 
Aston Villa after holding talks with the club owner, Randy Lerner, following a 
season of underachievement, according to reports.

Lerner flew in from the United States to speak with McLeish along with the 
chief executive, Paul Faulkner, in the aftermath of Sunday's 2-0 defeat at 
Norwich, which was described as "woeful" by the manager.

Sections of fans again called for the former Birmingham manager to be axed as 
Villa ended the campaign just two points clear of the bottom three.

McLeish has had to contend with slashing the wage bill, which he described as 
"astronomical", and has been deprived of several key players through injury or 
illness.

The likes of record signing Darren Bent, the defender Richard Dunne and the 
captain Stilian Petrov have been unavailable for lengthy spells and McLeish has 
had to put the accent on youth.

McLeish always stressed it would be a season of transition after replacing 
GÃ©rard Houllier last summer, but it was still a surprise that Villa only made 
sure of survival last weekend.

Their tally of 38 points in finishing 16th is actually one less than when 
McLeish was relegated with Birmingham last campaign.

Villa have also encountered the worst season in their history in terms of 
their home record in registering just four wins.

McLeish insisted after the 2-0 defeat at Carrow Road he was still the right 
man for the job and was aiming to rebuild the side.
