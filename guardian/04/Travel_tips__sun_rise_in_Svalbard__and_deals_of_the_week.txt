Take me there: Svalbard, Norway

Why go?
The end of winter is always a cause for celebration in Svalbard, and never 
more so than this year when the sun’s first reappearance above the horizon – 
after a long, dark absence of six months – will coincide with a total eclipse 
(20 March,svalbard2015.no <http://svalbard2015.no/english.html>). The 
archipelago, halfway between Norway and the North Pole, offers unspoiled Arctic 
wilderness, but doesn’t come cheap. Though airfares are lower since Norwegian 
Air started flying there (norwegian.com 
<http://www.norwegian.com/portals/norwegiancom/>) the cost of living is high. 
But for many, a trip to this glacial outpost, where polar bears outnumber 
people, is worth saving up for.

What to do
Activities are determined by the seasons: hiking, kayaking and glacier cruises 
in summer, and dogsledding and snowmobiling in winter. Extreme conditions and 
the risk of polar bear encounters make an organised trip the safest option. 
Most operators are based in Longyearbyen, a former mining settlement which is 
the inspiration for the fictional town ofFortitude, Sky Atlantic’s new crime 
blockbuster. Be sure to visit the Spitsbergen Airship Museum, which tells the 
story of polar exploration (spitsbergenairshipmuseum.com 
<http://spitsbergenairshipmuseum.com/>). Basecamp Spitsbergen offers several 
unusual excursions, including the chance to spend a night on a Dutch sailing 
vessel frozen into the fjord ice (basecampspitsbergen.com 
<http://www.basecampspitsbergen.com/>).

Where to eat
Huset is something of a local institution, offering everything from pizza to 
reindeer stew (huset.com <http://www.huset.com/>).

Where to stay
Basecamp Hotel (previously known as Trapper’s Hotel) in Longyearbyen is a cosy 
and atmospheric retreat kitted out with furs, seal skins and driftwood (from 
£90 per night,basecampspitsbergen.com <http://www.basecampspitsbergen.com/>).

Insider tip
Wilderness guide Stefano Poli (poliarctici.com <http://poliarctici.com/>) 
suggests a snowmobile safari to Storfjorden. “In winter it’s the best place to 
see polar bears. We offer overnight stays in heated tents as the best time to 
see bears is in the morning and evening.”
