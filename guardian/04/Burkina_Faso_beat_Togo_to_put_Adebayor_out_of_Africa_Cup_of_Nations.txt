Burkina Faso <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso> reached the 
semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time since 1998 when a 
header in extra time from Jonathan Pitroipa gave them a 1-0 win over fellow 
outsiders Togo on Sunday.

Pitroipa pulled away from his marker at a corner in the last seconds of the 
first period of extra time to head in off the underside of the bar and put 
Burkina Faso through to the last four where they will meet Ghana in Nelspruit 
on Wednesday.

The match, on the hard, sandy pitch at the Mbombela Stadium, seemed destined 
to go to penalties after 90 minutes of largely uninspiring football, although 
both sides did have chances to win it in the closing minutes of normal time.

Togo's talismanic captain, Emmanuel Adebayor, worked tirelessly for his side, 
who had never reached this stage before, but he was unable to find the net. One 
effort was cleared off the line and another was well saved by Daouda Diakite in 
the Burkina Faso goal.

Adebayor will now return to London to join Tottenham's battle for the top-four 
places in the Premier League. The news will come as a timely boost for the 
Spurs manager, Andr√© Villas-Boas, afterJermain Defoe was forced off with an 
injury
