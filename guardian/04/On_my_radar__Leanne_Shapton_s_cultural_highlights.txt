Something Wicked This Way Comes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/dec/14/ray-bradbury-something-wicked-this-way-comes>

I’m rereading Ray Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes. I read it as a 
teenager and I’d forgotten what a beautiful, poetic writer Bradbury was. It’s 
an amazing book — complex and terrifying. I’m thinking a lot about parenthood 
and the passage of time right now, especially the fears of a child as compared 
with the fears of a parent or adult. I’ve crossed that readership meridian, and 
instead of relating to the children, I’m relating to the weird, sad grownups. 
Reading it anew is a completely different experience.

 Breaks the ice at parties: Stan’s Donuts. 
Whenever I’m in LA I try to get a dozen doughnuts from Stan’s. As a Canadian, 
they are a part of my cultural landscape and I don’t love fancy artisanal 
versions. I like cop doughnuts. Stan’s makes the best of this variety, but with 
50s flavours like peanut butter and banana, blueberry buttermilk, and a great 
maple log. They are rich, and I often wind up eating them like a box of bonbons 
– taking a bite of one and putting it back. They’re great to bring to a party 
(instead of a bottle of regifted wine, which happens more often than I’d like 
to admit) or if I’m meeting friends at a bar.

My three-year-old is a huge Totoro fan. A friend of hers turned her on to it, 
andHayao Miyazaki <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki> films in 
general. I like that the story mixes darker and difficult reality with the 
innocence and fantasy of girlhood, and magical furry gremlins. My daughter and 
I dressed as Satsuki and Mei for Halloween. I’ve since become a bigStudio Ghibli
 <http://www.onlineghibli.com/films.php> fan myself. I love The Wind Rises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wind-rises> in particular, which I liken 
toDownton Abbey in Japan with German and Japanese aeronautical history thrown 
in.

 Ellsworth Kelly’s Green (IV.4. Green; Vert Série IV, No. 4), 1964. Photograph:

There is a lithograph Ellsworth Kelly made in 1964 called Green (IV.4. Green; 
Vert Série IV, No. 4) 
<http://www.stedelijk.nl/kunstwerk/1703-green-iv-4-green-vert-serie-iv-no-4> 
that is one of my favourite pieces of art and, consequently, one of my 
favourite shades of green. I first saw it in a Gagosian publication about the
Ferus Gallery <http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ferus-Gallery-Gagosian/dp/0847832341>, 
and am on a search to find either the gallery poster for that show, or one of 
the 75 lithographs he made, now even more rare since his passing. It is the 
definition of Kelly green. David Hockney wore a jacket in this colour too.

 ‘Subversively intimate’: A model sporting Baserange underwear. 
On a trip to Paris I came across the Danish/French brand Baserange. I’m 
constantly on the lookout for the perfect underwear and I may have finally 
found it. Though I’m also partial to US brandTen Undies 
<https://www.tenundies.com/>, I love the way Baserange shoot their underwear 
and clothes on women. Instead of the cheesy soft-porn style of most underwear 
advertising, they show pictures of models in their smalls – no airbrushing, all 
races, beautiful lumps and all – that feel subversively intimate and real.

 Superiority Burger’s meat-free wares. 
Chef Brooks Headley’s vegetarian takeout joint Superiority Burger, in New 
York’s East Village, makes this non-vegetarian confident that vegetarianism is 
the future. The menu is small and prices are low. They make a sloppy Joe they 
call a sloppy Dave, weird, delicious salads, specials that change nightly, and 
great gelato, but their burger is bananas. Not literally. I think it might have 
some risotto in it. (It’s a secret.) They also postwitty Instagram epithets 
<https://www.instagram.com/superiorityburger/> and, Brooks being a former punk 
drummer, the music while waiting in line to order is great. I try to go once a 
week.

All Canada Photos/Alamy 
I travelled to the Arctic this summer on assignment and fell in love with 
Nunavut; King William Island in particular. The island is a little larger than 
Jamaica, with a tiny population of 1,200 people, mostly living in Gjoa Haven, 
where Roald Amundsen wintered in 1904 and 1905 on his expedition to find the 
Northwest Passage. I was so far north, the aurora borealis was to the south in 
the night sky. I ate fresh Arctic char andbannock 
<http://www.canadianliving.com/food/bannock.php>, and visited ancient Tunit 
<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140828-arctic-migration-genome-genetics-dna-eskimos-inuit-dorset/>
 dwellings. Since it was the Arctic summer, the ground wasn’t covered in ice 
and I got to fill my sketchbook with watercolours of the indigenous lichen, 
which in some cases looked like William Morris wallpaper.
