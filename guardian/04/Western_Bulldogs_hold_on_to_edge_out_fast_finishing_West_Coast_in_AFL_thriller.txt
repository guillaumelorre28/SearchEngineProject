The Western Bulldogs <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/western-bulldogs> 
survived a late charge by West Coast to score a thrilling eight-point win at 
Etihad Stadium on Sunday. The Eagles kicked three unanswered goals to trail by 
just three points with five minutes to play, but the Dogs dug deep to record a 
spirited 12.11 (83) to 11.9 (75) win in front of 28,769 fans.

The much-anticipated clash between the top-four hopefuls lived up to 
expectations with the desperation shown by both sides giving the contest a 
finals-like atmosphere.

The Bulldogs lived up to their reputation as one of the best pressure teams in 
the competition, their midfielders’ hard work helping negate the influence of 
star Eagles ruckman Nic Naitanui as they went on to win the contested 
possession count 152-114.


The Eagles lost no admirers with their determined effort but ultimately fell 
to a defeat that leaves questions about their ability to win away from Subiaco 
unanswered.


Lachie Hunter, Jack Macrae and Marcus Bontempelli were important in the 
Bulldogs’ midfield, while Matthew Boyd and Matt Suckling impressed across 
half-back. Key defender Marcus Adams claimed another scalp, this time keeping 
West Coast spearhead Josh Kennedy to just one goal.

Brownlow medallist Matt Priddis was outstanding for the visitors with a 
team-high 27 touches, with Andrew Gaff and Shannon Hurn also influential.


Both sides lost key players before the game, the Dogs losing influential 
defender and stand-in skipper Easton Wood to a hamstring injury, while West 
Coast’s Jeremy McGovern withdrawn due to illness.

Earlier, Port Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/port-adelaide> ran 
rings around disjointed Collingwood to claim a 67-point victory at the MCG. 
With Travis Cloke back in the Collingwood side for the first time since being 
dropped in April, the Magpies made a bright start on a grey day in Melbourne.

Cloke set up the opening goal of the match for skipper Scott Pendlebury with a 
clever handball as the Magpies jumped to an early 14-point lead but that was to 
prove to be the high point of the afternoon for the home side.

The Power led by 11 points at the first change, increasing that margin to 25 
at half-time and 50 at three-quarter-time. The visitors did not let up in the 
final quarter either as they closed out the 19.11 (125) to 7.16 (58) win 
against the demoralised Magpies.

Cloke won back his spot in the Collingwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/collingwood> lineup after fellow forwards 
Darcy Moore and Alex Fasolo suffered serious injuries in last weekend’s loss to 
the Bulldogs. He tried hard on Sunday but looked a player still way out of 
form, taking six marks without kicking a single goal.

Jake Neade and Aaron Young kicked four goals apiece and were among a host of 
PortAdelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adelaide> players who had the 
better of their opponents.

Despite the cold and damp conditions, Collingwood would have been disappointed 
with the small crowd of 28,567.

It was a second straight MCG loss for the Magpies who slipped to a 4-7 
win-loss record ahead of the annual Queen’s Birthday clash with Melbourne. The 
Power improved to 6-5 and will now return home to take on the Western Bulldogs 
at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday in a finals-shaping encounter.

And in the late game on Sunday, Adelaide’s Josh Jenkins continued his breakout 
season with a seven-goal haul as the Crows thumped St Kilda by 88 points.St 
Kilda <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/st-kilda> young guns Paddy McCartin 
and Hugh Goddard were stretchered off Adelaide Oval as the Crows banked a 
comprehensive 19.19 (133) to 6.9 (45) victory.

Adelaide blitzed the Saints from the start, kicking six goals to one in the 
first term as midfielder Matt Crouch, a late replacement for veteran Scott 
Thompson (general soreness), dominated with 17 disposals for the quarter. 
Jenkins then went on a scoring spree, kicking four goals in the second term as 
the hosts created a 51-point halftime lead before 40,896 fans.

St Kilda’s woes were compounded when Goddard was stretchered off after 
damaging his left achilles when turning innocuously to chase Jenkins. And next 
quarter, Goddard’s team-mate McCartin was also stretchered off with a head 
injury – he clashed heads, front-on, with team-mate Jack Newnes, the impact 
forcing his head back into the face of Adelaide’s Luke Brown.

The Crows remain the highest scoring team in the competition and have now 
kicked 100 or more points in seven of 10 games – and have twice scored 97. 
Jenkins, with 34 goals for the season, feasted on frequent supply from a 
midfield led by Rory Sloane (32 disposals), Crouch, who ended with 36 touches, 
and Jarryd Lyons (28 possessions).

Their ball-winning overwhelmed the Saints who never raised a yelp – Jack 
Steven (31 disposals) and David Armitage (25 possessions) battled gamely but 
had no support.
