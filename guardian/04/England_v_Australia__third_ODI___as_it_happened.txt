England win by 93 runs

A comprehensive win for England in the end, thanks to James Taylor’s batting 
and the spin bowling of Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali.

WICKET! Wade b Finn 42 (Australia 207 all out)

Finn returns and the general thrash continues. Wade clubs him into the stands 
at cow corner to bring up the Australia 200, then carves him wide of mid-off 
for four more. But the next is full and straight. Wade misses. England win.

43rd over: Australia 193-9 (Wade 29, Pattinson 1) England have the chance to 
run either batsmen out after Pattinson is slapped on the pad, but they get 
themselves into a tangle and end up missing the stumps at the wrong end. They 
review the lbw decision but it pitched about a foot outside leg stump. Stokes 
bangs in a couple of yorkers but Pattinson digs them out well.

42nd over: Australia 190-9 (Wade 27, Pattinson 1) Plunkett comes in for his 
10th and final over. Wade swings … and misses, swings … and connects, dragging 
the ball to square leg for four. He manages to squirt the next, a full toss, 
over backward point and away for a couple more.

41st over: Australia 181-9 (Wade 19, Pattinson 0) Ben Stokes gets a bowl for 
the first time in the innings. Wade picks up a single from the fourth ball, 
leaving Pattinson with a couple to face. He does so with little fuss.

This will be England's biggest win over Aus in an ODI (by runs).

WICKET! Cummins c Roy b Plunkett 5 (Australia 172-9)

Stand-and-swing from Cummins and it’s not long before he picks out a fielder, 
Roy, as it happens, down at long on.

WICKET! Starc c Bairstow b Moeen 1 (Australia 167-8)

Smart, not to mention bold, bowling from Moeen this. He rips the ball past 
Starc, who understandably has come out swinging. And he repeats the trick with 
the next ball. The third is bravely put in the same spot, and this time he 
finds the edge. Bairstow takes a sharp catch and England have got this won.

WICKET! Agar c Roy b Plunkett 5 (Australia 165-7_

The second wonder catch of this innings. Agar scoops Plunkett high into the 
Manchester sky. Out int he deep Roy runs in but he’s taken a step too far and 
has to check and dive backwards. He can’t take the catch cleanly and the ball 
pops out of his grasp, but as he falls backwards he somehow manages to keep his 
wits about him and take the catch at the second attempt. That was extraordinary.

36th over: Australia 159-6 (Wade 7, Agar 2) “That was a giant spell from 
Rashid,” writes Robert Wilson. “Test quality bowling in an ODI. He was turning 
it a foot as his stock ball. If Warne had bowled that spell, we’d all be 
reaching (tearfully) for the tissues. And whether the rejected review ball was 
a topspinner or not, it was the straightest of disguised straight balls, the 
hardest thing for a leggie to do, it deserved a couple of wickets all on its 
own.”

Plunkett keeps the batsmen honest with some full, straight stuff. The tension 
in the over comes from the midwicket boundary where the crowd are egging on 
Alex Hales to don a walrus mask that has been chucked near to him. At the end 
of the over he does so. Good stuff.

35th over: Australia 156-6 (Wade 6, Agar 1) A quick confession – had a 
complete blank over the word ‘palindromic’ so had to Google “word that reads 
the same both ways”. Eventually. First I googled “poop bob toot” in an attempt 
to work it out for myself. Seriously. Sheesh.

Anyway Moeen continues, as well he might with two left-handers to bowl at. A 
Wade single starts the over, an Agar single finishes it.

34th over: Australia 154-6 (Wade 5, Agar 0) Liam Plunkett’s returns means 
England are on course to complete a roughly palindromic set of bowling 
partnerships – Finn/Woakes, Plunkett/Spinner, Spinner/Spinner, 
Spinner/Plunkett, Woakes/Finn. Australia need just over nine an over from here: 
147 from 96 balls.

32nd over: Australia 150-5 (Wade 3, Marsh 11) Rashid’s last over. He turns one 
past Wade’s pads and Australia pick up a couple of wides. The fifth delivery is 
a cracker that pitches on leg stump and sizzles past Marsh’s outside edge. 
Rashid ends with figures of 10-1-41-2.

31st over: Australia 143-5 (Wade 1, Marsh 9) Moeen begins with four dots at 
Wade. I make that 13 dots on the bounce (including the wicket of Bailey). Wade 
finally breaks the shackles from the fifth ball of the over, driving down the 
ground for a single. An outside edge from the last brings another.

30th over: Australia 141-5 (Wade 0, Marsh 8) Rashid, into his ninth over now, 
rips one past Marsh’s edge once more. When he lands it properly, he’s proving 
incredibly difficult to get away. Marsh can do little more than prop forward 
and block. A maiden.

WICKET! Bailey c Stokes b Moeen 25 (Australia 141-5)

England do have their fifth wicket now though. Moeen bungs down a hideous full 
toss that Bailey whacks straight down the throat of Stokes at midwicket.

28th over: Australia 137-4 (Bailey 22, Marsh 7) Rashid almost has his third 
wicket but Bailey’s hopelessly miscued drive squirts high but lands safe 
between men on the off side. The leg-spinner again drags one down and this time 
Marsh is able to extract punishment, pulling hard for four. A couple of balls 
later, though, he’s gone – caught on the back foot to what looks like a 
topspinner. Marsh reviews … and he’s struck a whisker outside the line, with 
the ball going on to miss the stumps.

WICKET! Maxwell c Bairstow b Moeen 17 (Australia 128-4)

Reverse slog-sweep from Maxwell, who has come out in full T20 mode. Four runs 
from that, and from the next, another reverse slog-sweep disappearing to the 
point boundary. But from the next he’s gone! Another reverse-sweep, this time 
far more delicate, goes horribly wrong with the ball looping up for Bairstow to 
take a simple catch.

26th over: Australia 120-3 (Bailey 20, Maxwell 9) Rashid drags down a 
half-tracker – seriously, it was like something you’d send down for fun in 
Brian Lara 96 on the Megadrive. But, like something you’d send down for fun in 
Brian Lara 96 on the Megadrive, it proved difficult to hit, with Bailey having 
to change his pre-meditated line of attack. Rashid has got a little wild here – 
a couple of balls after the long hop leg-spinner, he sends down a huge full 
toss that Maxwell spanks to the cow corner boundary.

25th over: Australia 110-3 (Bailey 19, Maxwell 0) Two dots from Moeen to 
Bailey again – that’s eight on the bounce in all – until the Australia No4 
finally gets a single and out of the firing line. It’s another brilliant over 
from Moeen, whose figures read 3-1-5-0. Australia have scored just six runs in 
the past four overs.

24th over: Australia 109-3 (Bailey 18, Maxwell 0) A leg bye from the first, 
then Rashid rips one past Bailey’s outside edge. He’s really struggling to get 
the ball away and ends up driving just out of Stokes’ reach at a catching mid 
off. Maxwell tries to plant the leggie into the stands with a slog-sweep off 
the last but connects with only fresh air. Two from the over. The required 
run-rate creeps up again.

23rd over: Australia 107-3 (Bailey 17, Maxwell 0) Three dots to start Moeen’s 
latest. Make that four, Bailey missing with an attempted reverse sweep. In 
fact, make it five. Tell you what, make it a maiden. Brilliantly bowled.

Right, that’s it from me. Be sure to stick around on site for all the reports 
and reaction. But for now, cheerio!
 
A comprehensive win for England in the end, thanks to James Taylor’s batting 
and the spin bowling of Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali.

Finn returns and the general thrash continues. Wade clubs him into the stands 
at cow corner to bring up the Australia 200, then carves him wide of mid-off 
for four more. But the next is full and straight. Wade misses. England win.

43rd over: Australia 193-9 (Wade 29, Pattinson 1) England have the chance to 
run either batsmen out after Pattinson is slapped on the pad, but they get 
themselves into a tangle and end up missing the stumps at the wrong end. They 
review the lbw decision but it pitched about a foot outside leg stump. Stokes 
bangs in a couple of yorkers but Pattinson digs them out well.
 
42nd over: Australia 190-9 (Wade 27, Pattinson 1) Plunkett comes in for his 
10th and final over. Wade swings … and misses, swings … and connects, dragging 
the ball to square leg for four. He manages to squirt the next, a full toss, 
over backward point and away for a couple more.

41st over: Australia 181-9 (Wade 19, Pattinson 0) Ben Stokes gets a bowl for 
the first time in the innings. Wade picks up a single from the fourth ball, 
leaving Pattinson with a couple to face. He does so with little fuss.

This will be England's biggest win over Aus in an ODI (by runs).

40th over: Australia 177-9 (Wade 16, Pattinson 0) Wade slaps four cross-batted 
through the covers but this is nearly over.
 
Stand-and-swing from Cummins and it’s not long before he picks out a fielder, 
Roy, as it happens, down at long on.

39th over: Australia 168-8 (Wade 11, Cummins 1) Moeen finishes with figures of 
10-1-32-3.
 
Smart, not to mention bold, bowling from Moeen this. He rips the ball past 
Starc, who understandably has come out swinging. And he repeats the trick with 
the next ball. The third is bravely put in the same spot, and this time he 
finds the edge. Bairstow takes a sharp catch and England have got this won.

38th over: Australia 165-7 (Wade 10, Starc 0) And that’s over.
 
The second wonder catch of this innings. Agar scoops Plunkett high into the 
Manchester sky. Out int he deep Roy runs in but he’s taken a step too far and 
has to check and dive backwards. He can’t take the catch cleanly and the ball 
pops out of his grasp, but as he falls backwards he somehow manages to keep his 
wits about him and take the catch at the second attempt. That was extraordinary.

37th over: Australia 163-6 (Wade 9, Agar 4) Moeen into his ninth over. Four 
singles off the over. The required rate is up above 10 now.
 
36th over: Australia 159-6 (Wade 7, Agar 2) “That was a giant spell from 
Rashid,” writes Robert Wilson. “Test quality bowling in an ODI. He was turning 
it a foot as his stock ball. If Warne had bowled that spell, we’d all be 
reaching (tearfully) for the tissues. And whether the rejected review ball was 
a topspinner or not, it was the straightest of disguised straight balls, the 
hardest thing for a leggie to do, it deserved a couple of wickets all on its 
own.”

Plunkett keeps the batsmen honest with some full, straight stuff. The tension 
in the over comes from the midwicket boundary where the crowd are egging on 
Alex Hales to don a walrus mask that has been chucked near to him. At the end 
of the over he does so. Good stuff.

35th over: Australia 156-6 (Wade 6, Agar 1) A quick confession – had a 
complete blank over the word ‘palindromic’ so had to Google “word that reads 
the same both ways”. Eventually. First I googled “poop bob toot” in an attempt 
to work it out for myself. Seriously. Sheesh.

Anyway Moeen continues, as well he might with two left-handers to bowl at. A 
Wade single starts the over, an Agar single finishes it.
 
34th over: Australia 154-6 (Wade 5, Agar 0) Liam Plunkett’s returns means 
England are on course to complete a roughly palindromic set of bowling 
partnerships – Finn/Woakes, Plunkett/Spinner, Spinner/Spinner, 
Spinner/Plunkett, Woakes/Finn. Australia need just over nine an over from here: 
147 from 96 balls.
 
Australia are subsiding fairly meekly – Marsh chips a simple catch to mid on.

33rd over: Australia 152-5 (Wade 4, Marsh 12) Another very tidy over from 
Moeen – just two singles from it.
 
32nd over: Australia 150-5 (Wade 3, Marsh 11) Rashid’s last over. He turns one 
past Wade’s pads and Australia pick up a couple of wides. The fifth delivery is 
a cracker that pitches on leg stump and sizzles past Marsh’s outside edge. 
Rashid ends with figures of 10-1-41-2.
 
31st over: Australia 143-5 (Wade 1, Marsh 9) Moeen begins with four dots at 
Wade. I make that 13 dots on the bounce (including the wicket of Bailey). Wade 
finally breaks the shackles from the fifth ball of the over, driving down the 
ground for a single. An outside edge from the last brings another.
 
30th over: Australia 141-5 (Wade 0, Marsh 8) Rashid, into his ninth over now, 
rips one past Marsh’s edge once more. When he lands it properly, he’s proving 
incredibly difficult to get away. Marsh can do little more than prop forward 
and block. A maiden.
 
29th over: Australia 141-5 (Wade 0, Marsh 8) This is far from over but 
Australia are not giving the remotest impression that they’re about to chase 
this down.
 
England do have their fifth wicket now though. Moeen bungs down a hideous full 
toss that Bailey whacks straight down the throat of Stokes at midwicket.

28th over: Australia 137-4 (Bailey 22, Marsh 7) Rashid almost has his third 
wicket but Bailey’s hopelessly miscued drive squirts high but lands safe 
between men on the off side. The leg-spinner again drags one down and this time 
Marsh is able to extract punishment, pulling hard for four. A couple of balls 
later, though, he’s gone – caught on the back foot to what looks like a 
topspinner. Marsh reviews … and he’s struck a whisker outside the line, with 
the ball going on to miss the stumps.
 
27th over: Australia 130-4 (Bailey 21, Marsh 1) Mitchell Marsh gets off the 
mark immediately with a single.
 
Reverse slog-sweep from Maxwell, who has come out in full T20 mode. Four runs 
from that, and from the next, another reverse slog-sweep disappearing to the 
point boundary. But from the next he’s gone! Another reverse-sweep, this time 
far more delicate, goes horribly wrong with the ball looping up for Bairstow to 
take a simple catch.

26th over: Australia 120-3 (Bailey 20, Maxwell 9) Rashid drags down a 
half-tracker – seriously, it was like something you’d send down for fun in 
Brian Lara 96 on the Megadrive. But, like something you’d send down for fun in 
Brian Lara 96 on the Megadrive, it proved difficult to hit, with Bailey having 
to change his pre-meditated line of attack. Rashid has got a little wild here – 
a couple of balls after the long hop leg-spinner, he sends down a huge full 
toss that Maxwell spanks to the cow corner boundary.
 
25th over: Australia 110-3 (Bailey 19, Maxwell 0) Two dots from Moeen to 
Bailey again – that’s eight on the bounce in all – until the Australia No4 
finally gets a single and out of the firing line. It’s another brilliant over 
from Moeen, whose figures read 3-1-5-0. Australia have scored just six runs in 
the past four overs.
 
24th over: Australia 109-3 (Bailey 18, Maxwell 0) A leg bye from the first, 
then Rashid rips one past Bailey’s outside edge. He’s really struggling to get 
the ball away and ends up driving just out of Stokes’ reach at a catching mid 
off. Maxwell tries to plant the leggie into the stands with a slog-sweep off 
the last but connects with only fresh air. Two from the over. The required 
run-rate creeps up again.
 
23rd over: Australia 107-3 (Bailey 17, Maxwell 0) Three dots to start Moeen’s 
latest. Make that four, Bailey missing with an attempted reverse sweep. In 
fact, make it five. Tell you what, make it a maiden. Brilliantly bowled.
 
22nd over: Australia 107-3 (Bailey 17, Maxwell 0) Bailey grabs a single off 
the last. Three from the over. Rashid has figures of 5-0-16-2.
 
And with the pressure just tweaking up a little, Finch looks to break the 
shackles and gets caught on the long on boundary.
