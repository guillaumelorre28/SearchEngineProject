The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) states that children have 
the right to protection from harm. Although the UNCRC is the most widely 
ratified human rights treaty in history, the basic rights of children 
throughout the world are still being ignored.

UNICEF estimates that 300 million children worldwide are subjected to 
violence, abuse, and exploitation on a daily basis. Millions more children 
remain at risk due to inadequate protection.

• More than 200 million children worldwide are engaged in child labour.
• An estimated 300,000 child soldiers are actively involved in armed conflicts 
throughout the world.
• Over one million children worldwide enter the sex industry each year. 

Children in the developing world are particularly vulnerable. Thousands of 
local NGOs throughout the developing world are responding to this need to 
protect the most vulnerable children from harm, helping them look forward to a 
brighter, happier future.

Case study 1

Cambodia
Sihanoukville is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Cambodia. It 
is, however, also home to a large number of street children who are extremely 
vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. As part of an exciting initiative, a 
number of former street children are now teaching other children about their 
rights and how they can best protect themselves.

Case study 2

India 
Tourism and some of the most relaxed laws in India attract thousands of 
children to Pondicherry every year, many of whom end up living on the streets. 
Through an important new project which has been established in the city, these 
children are now receiving the care and support they so badly need.Click here

Case study 3

Uganda 
The UN estimates that the Lord's Resistance Army abducted 20,000 children 
during the protracted 20 year conflict in northern Uganda. On return, many of 
these abductees are ostracised from their communities and lack adequate 
support. The promotion of awareness, cohesion and reconciliation among 
community members is a fundamental part of their reintegration and 
rehabilitation.Click here to read more.
