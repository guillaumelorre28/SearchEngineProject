From Benny Hill looking dirty-minded to Johnny Vegas looking sexy, the 
National Portrait Gallery in London <http://www.npg.org.uk/> is celebrating 
British comedy in a free display that includes several recent acquisitions.

The gallery said it had acquired a photograph originally commissioned by the 
Guardian <http://www.guardian.co.uk/flash/page/0,,1867169,00.html>, which shows 
Vegas mimicking Demi Moore's pregnant pose on the cover of Vanity Fair. The 
photograph is one of more than 20 taken byKarl J Kaul <http://karljkaul.com/>, 
including Sacha Baron Cohen as Michael Jackson and Russell Brand as Christine 
Keeler.

Other recent acquisitions include portraits of Jimmy Carr and Mitchell 
and Webb by Barry Marsden, Omid Djalili by Karen Robinson and Matt Lucas by 
Nadav Kander. The display charts 70 years of British comedy, from people such as
Kenneth Horne <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Horne> in the 1940s to the 
Catherine Tate Show. Along the way it takes in comedians and comic performers 
from the Goon Show to Les Dawson to Victoria Wood.

Clare Freestone, the gallery's associate curator of photographs, said the NPG 
aimed to promote an appreciation of people who have made and are making British 
history and culture. "Comedians do this in a unique way," she said. "They are 
very good at reflecting back at us the times in which we live and, of course, 
they make us laugh."

She said the gallery had a large number of photographs of comedians taken over 
the last century, some by celebrated photographers such asBill Brandt 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Brandt>, Lewis Morley 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Morley> and Annie Leibovitz 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/annie-leibovitz>.

"This display gave us the opportunity to highlight a group of people that have 
always been held high in public affection, with their performances often 
creating national talking points."
