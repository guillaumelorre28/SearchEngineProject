: “I hope I can bring my experience to the team and the club to stay in the 
Premier League.

“I’m looking forward to every game. The atmosphere around the league is 
fantastic and everyone across the world has seen the Premier League, so I am 
very proud to be a part of that. It is a new challenge for me, but I like that.”

Defour added: “It has been a long few weeks, but I am very happy to be here. 
When I knew thatBurnley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> was 
interested, I took some time to look into the club and I saw some interesting 
stuff.

“I also called a friend of mine who plays at Brentford and he told me Burnley 
was the best team in the Championship and that it would be a really good choice 
for me.”

Defour joins the Charlton pair Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Nick Pope and 
Liverpool’s on-loan full-back Jon Flanagan as Burnley’s only signings this 
summer.

The Burnley manager Sean Dyche added: “Steven was a target of ours and it’s 
been a hard deal to do, but we got there in the end.

“He’s a good player with a depth of experience at international level and also 
Champions League.

“Steven is new to the Premier League but has a real thirst and desire to be 
successful in this campaign.”
