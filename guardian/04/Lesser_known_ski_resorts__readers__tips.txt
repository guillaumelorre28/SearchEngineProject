Winning tip: Jahorina, Bosnia and Herzegovina


This is a fantastic little ski resort if you’re looking for somewhere a bit 
more exotic – and a heck of a lot cheaper. We stayed at the superbTermag 
<http://termaghotel.com/> hotel and lived like oligarchs do in the Alps (I 
imagine). I splashed out and had two hours’ private tuition with a former 
Olympian for £50 (try finding that in the Alps). The whole trip, including 
flights, came in at about £700 and I was fairly reckless with my budgeting. Any 
more than a week and you’ll get bored, but I can’t recommendJahorina 
<http://www.jahorina.org/en/files/jahorina.php> enough.

Stoos is a lovely, uncrowded car-free resort under the spectacular Mythens in 
central Switzerland served by a cable car and a funicular railway from the 
valleys below. Runs down to the resort are from the peaks of Fronalpstock and 
Klingenstock. From the top of Fronalpstock you can look down across lake 
Lucerne to Rütli meadow, where it is said that the Swiss Confederation was 
founded in 1291. Beyond, you can see Rigi and Pilatus and many other peaks. The 
red runs are spectacular and thread across a long and challenging toboggan run. 
Klingenstock provides a rewarding bowl comprising fiendishly steep reds, a 
clutch of black runs and acres of off-piste. For a small resort the après ski 
is not bad and there is a good range of ski-in, ski-out accommodation. From 
Zurich airport it is barely an hour to the bottom station at Schwyz by train 
and bus.

Tagines and mint tea don’t often spring to mind when people think of skiing, 
but Oukaimeden, in Morocco’s High Atlas mountains, is Africa’s highest ski 
resort. I’ve ridden on the back of a donkey, carrying my skis to a chairlift 
that will take me to 3,258 metres, but snowfall can be sporadic and was not 
forthcoming on some of my visits. I enjoy quiet slopes, bumpy runs and the 
distant call of a muezzin before returning to base and Berber hospitality.

The welcoming village of Macugnaca is set at the foot of Monte Rosa (4,634 
metres), the second tallest mountain in the Alps, offering skiing for all 
levels and budgets. It has trekking and snow walks, all well signposted, and is 
a real favourite with Italian families. The bars and cafes are plentiful, cheap 
and rarely crowded. Because it caters for day trippers from Milan and Turin, 
you can have the ski runs to yourself in the early morning if you stay 
overnight at a pensione. You’ll also have the pick of the trattorias in the 
evening.

Saint Jean d’Aulps, France

We were surprised to find this pocket of Haute Savoie deserted in February 
half-term 2012. Five minutes up the road from unspoilt Saint Jean d’Aulps is La 
Grande Terche, with 34km of runs (part of the Portes du Soleil ski area). There 
are two excellent 10km red slopes which run through forests and valleys. 
Another surprise was the lift pass, which was only €23.70 per day (with €5 off 
if you only want five hours).

Where better to work up an appetite on the slopes than Sestola in the 
Apennines south of Modena? A decent lift system links 50km of pistes on the 
flanks of Monte Cimone, with suitable runs for all abilities and plentiful 
snowmaking equipment. Note that local skiers begin to trickle off the slopes at 
noon, congregating around the mountain restaurants for lazy afternoons lunching 
on local specialities such as cured meats, chestnut-stuffed pasta, ortigelle 
withlardo and parmigiano. Finish the day with a stroll in the handsome mountain 
town of Sestola just below the pistes.
• Adult ski pass €26 Mon-Fri, €33 weekends and holidays. Rifugio del Firenze 
Ninfa has rooms from €47pppn half board including a tasting menu of 8-10 courses

Many people think of Hokkaido for skiing, but the fields nearer to Nagano 
<http://skinaganojapan.com/Home_Page.html> are open until as late as mid-April 
and easily accessed directly from Narita airport and Tokyo. You can choose from 
Hakuba or Shiga Kogen (to name a few) and can buy passes linking several slopes 
together. Best, you have anonsen town (places with hot springs) normally in 
reach as well as cosyizakayas (bars that serve food). Equipment rental is 
cheap, as are passes, by Western standards.
