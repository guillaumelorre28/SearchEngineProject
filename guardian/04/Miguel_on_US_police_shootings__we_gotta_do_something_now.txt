 has used his Wireless appearance to address the police violence currently 
plaguing the United States.

Speaking at the festival in Finsbury Park, London, the singer broke down in 
tears as he said: “We can’t let shit just blow over and not take action 
anymore. Look, our children will inherit this earth when we’re gone. What are 
we leaving for them? What are we doing for them now, not tomorrow? Now! Now! 
Now!”

After wiping tears from his eyes, he added: “I couldn’t sleep last night. And 
I will not rest. I cannot rest. We cannot rest anymore. We gotta do something. 
Gotta say something. I’m sorry if I’m preaching to you. But it’s true.”

His comments came after a week of violence in the US. On 5 and 6 July, two 
black men,Alton Sterling
