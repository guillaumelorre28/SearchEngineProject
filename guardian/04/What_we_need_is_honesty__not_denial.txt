Public spending is going to be squeezed, hard. The questions are when, where 
and how. The government has taken refuge in stealth; its planned cuts fall 
hardest on capital spending, and involve the usual salami-slicing of services 
(disguised as "efficiency"). The Tories would hide behind a new super quango 
and attack public services with relish. But honesty, rather than denial, is the 
best place to start.

There must be a better way that involves setting explicit priorities, 
decentralising decisions where possible, and ensuring democratic engagement 
(remarkably, MPs at present play no role in spending choices). Left to itself, 
the government machine will protect bureaucracy and senior management by 
sacrificing frontline services and modestly-paid staff. A cultural revolution 
is needed to reverse the top-down approach and protect public services.

Some potentially unpopular or controversial cuts are inevitable. The Liberal 
Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats> have 
identified big defence projects (including Trident), government IT and database 
contracts, the child trust fund, tax credits for high earners, and future 
public sector pension and pay arrangements for the burgeoning ranks of 
highly-paid public sector staff (including MPs). The more credible the choices, 
the more we ensure that frontline services are indeed protected, and that we 
are in a position to make future commitments to combat unemployment and invest 
in education.
