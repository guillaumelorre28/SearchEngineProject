The words to today’s song are taken from Psalm 137. It’s a song of sorrow and 
rage from the mouth of a refugee whose city has been destroyed. The sorrow 
portion of the psalm is extremely famous and often quoted – ”How can we sing 
the Lord’s song in a strange land?” The rage portion of the psalm is less often 
brought up – “O daughter of Babylon … happy shall he be, that taketh and 
dasheth they little ones against the stones.”

I can’t imagine the sorrow and rage of the people whose lands have been 
overrun by Isis, whose family and friends are murdered, whose culture is being 
destroyed.


This song is not a policy prescription. The last lines should evoke horror. 
But the emotions behind the words are ancient and real.


Mosul is a part of our heritage, part of the world’s heritage, and the loss of 
its history is heartbreaking.
