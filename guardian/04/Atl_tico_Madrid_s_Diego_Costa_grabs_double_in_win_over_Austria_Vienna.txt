, Atlético took the lead in the eighth minute when Koke sent Felipe Luís clear 
on the left and he squared for Raúl García to tap int.

Brazil-born Costa showed why the Spain coach, Vicente del Bosque, wants to 
call him up when he made it 2-0 in the 20th minute after racing from inside the 
Atlético half, dancing past the last defender and slipping the ball into the 
corner of the net.

The home side tried to force their way back into the match but Costa dashed 
any hopes of a comeback when he controlled an Emiliano Insúa centre and struck 
from close range eight minutes into the second half.

Atlético have a maximum nine points from three matches, with Russia's Zenit St 
Petersburg on four after their 1-0 win at Porto. Vienna have one point in 
fourth and last place, two behind the Portuguese side.
