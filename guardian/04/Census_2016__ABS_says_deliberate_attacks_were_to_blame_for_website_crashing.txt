The Australian Bureau of Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-bureau-of-statistics> 
has apologised after websites crashed during peak time on census night.

David Kalisch, the ABS chief statistician, told ABC news radio the site was 
subject to a sequence of denial of service attacks emanating from overseas. He 
says the ABS shut down the site to “protect the integrity of the data”, rather 
than the site crashing.

“From the scale of the attack it is clear it is malicious,” he said. “The data 
is secure and we expect to be in a situation soon to inform the public when the 
site will be ready again.

“I can certainly reassure Australians the data they provided is safe,” he said.

Kalisch said there were three attacks throughout the day on Tuesday, which 
were overcome, but the fourth one at about 7.30pm AEST caused severe problems.

The Australian Signals Directorate was now investigating, Kalisch said. He 
refused the speculate on the exact source of the attack, but in the past 
Australian government sites had been subject to attacks from Chinese hackers.

The ABS will release a statement at 9am about when Australians can expect to 
log back onto the census site.

On Tuesday evening, millions logged on to complete their online form. A few 
people reported problems early on but it largely was going ahead as planned for 
the majority

But not long after dinner time, many more millions also tried to log on – and 
then the problems started. As the servers crashed under the load, users were 
left with timeouts, grey pages or spinning beach balls of failure.


Social media was awash with screengrabs and memes using the #censusfail hashtag

The technical collapse of the system also sparked observations on the prospect 
of electronic voting.

<https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausvotes?src=hash> go with electronic voting. 
Should be a snap!

Meanwhile, the official Twitter account continued to reassure people “the 
online form and website are operating smoothly as expected”.

They eventually came around, posting a little after 8.30pm AEST that the sites 
had crashed. A spokesman confirmed the outage to Guardian Australia and said 
they were working to restore the service. At 11pm AEST, the ABS tweeted that 
the service would not be restored that night.

Census Australia (@ABSCensus) 
ABS & Census <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/census> website are 
unavailable. The service won't be restored tonight. We will update you in AM. 
We apologise for the inconvenience.

The census was already under intense scrutiny and criticism after it revealed 
it would retain names and addresses for four years – up from 18 months – and 
link datasets together. Several senators were among those who vowed they would 
not give the ABS their name, despite the threat of fines of $180 per day for 
not completing it.


The ABS has assured users they will not be fined for not completing it on 
Tuesday - they have until 23 September to complete the form, provided it is 
filled out with information accurate for census night.
