On Tuesday, Roma released a statement 
<http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/serie-a/2011-2012/as-roma-terminate-ashley-cole-s-contract_sto5067839/story.shtml>
 confirming Cole’s contract had been terminated by mutual consent.

“The 35-year-old English defender joined Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> in July 2014 following spells with 
Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Chelsea,” read the statement.

“After making his Giallorossi debut on 30 August 2014 in Roma’s 2-0 opening 
day victory over Fiorentina, Cole went on to make a total of 11 appearances in 
Serie A and a further five in the Coppa Italia and the Champions League.

“The club would like to thank Cole for his commitment during his stay in Rome 
and wish him the very best for his future career.”

Cole, who has almost 600 club appearances to his name as well as 107 England 
caps, has been linked with a move to join former England team-mate Steven 
Gerrard with the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer.
