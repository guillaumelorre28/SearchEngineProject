In a recent article in Spain’s El País newspaper, Huelva’s coastline was named 
the Secret Coast 
<http://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2013/07/11/actualidad/1373540815_753742.html>
; outside Spain it’s not just the coast but the province that’s a bit of a 
mystery. Good news for independent travellers looking for unspoilt gems, 
because this far south-western corner of Andalucía, between Cádiz and Portugal, 
has many, and not least along its 75-mile coastline, part of the Costa de la 
Luz, or the Coast of Light.

To the east, the coastal area is dominated by Doñana 
<http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm>, the largest and 
wildest of several protected marshlands, and a great long stretch of virgin 
beach backed by high dunes. And to the west, after the over-optimistic coastal 
developments of Isla Canela, there’s a string of chilled-out, small seaside 
resorts and fishing villages where life is easy, exceptional seafood is as 
cheap as chips, and people dance barefoot in beach bars on wide stretches of 
sand until the early hours.

With the coastal city of Huelva <http://www.andalucia.com/cities/huelva.htm> 
equidistant between Faro and Seville airports (one-and-a-half hours away), 
access couldn’t be easier. A fast road (E1/A49) runs parallel to the coast from 
Seville to the Portuguese border, and all the beaches are signposted off it.

 Flamingos in Doñana national park. Photograph: age fotostock/Alamy 
The 100,000 hectares of salt marshes, dunes, scrub and pine forest that make 
up this world heritage site are shared between Huelva, Cádiz and Seville, but 
most sit between the rivers Tinto and Guadalquivir in Huelva province, bordered 
by the Atlantic to the south. One of the most important and biodiverse 
protected areas in Europe, Doñana is home to the Iberian lynx (which you won’t 
see) and a favoured spot for waterfowl (which you will). The waters are packed 
with avocets, spoonbills, greylag geese, herons, flamingos, and various 
endangered ducks, although in high summer, much of the water disappears – as do 
many of the birds. Arranging a visit can be baffling. Only one company is 
authorised to drive visitors into the national park, and that’sCooperativa 
Marismas del Rocío, which offers a four-hour bus trip (+34 959 430 432, no 
website,€29.50pp). Another El Rocío-based company, Doñana a Caballo 
<http://www.donanaacaballo.com/> (+34 674 219 568, €30pp), takes riding tours 
through the park and you can hike a bit. There are three visitor centres 
signposted off the A483 from Matalascañas to El Rocío, from which to get 
information about short walking trails.El Acebuche is officially the main 
centre, but twitchers may prefer the trail fromLa Rocina which follows the 
course of a stream.

Few places are as pleasantly weird as El Rocío 
<http://www.andalucia.com/province/huelva/rocio/home.htm> in mid-afternoon – 
you’ll think you’ve stumbled across the filmset of a western. Literally a 
backwater on the edge of the Doñana marshes, its wide streets are made of 
drifting sand, low-flying flamingos cross the plazas, people get around on 
horseback, every house has a hitching post, and the few shops sell flamenco 
dresses, Catholic trinkets, or riding boots. Once a year, at Pentecost in May, 
1 million all-singing, all-dancing pilgrims converge in wagons and on horses to 
pay homage to the sparkling statue of Our Lady of El Rocío, Queen of the Marsh 
– an event that’s only for the most nocturnal and devout of partygoers.

Ruta Británica, Huelva
When an earthquake struck Lisbon in 1755, Huelva city, which sits on 
marshland, wobbled like jelly and collapsed, so there’s little evidence of its 
long history as an Atlantic trading post. But this self-guided tour celebrates 
the peculiarities of its recent past. The British came to set up the Rio Tinto 
Mining Company in 1873, took copper and left suburbia, private clubs, Victorian 
bathrooms, library books and a steam railway, as well as a local passion for 
billiards, badminton, and golf and, most importantly, the very first football 
club in Spain (unfortunately, Huelva is currently on a losing streak). The 
colony lasted 81 years, finally dispersed by Franco in 1954. Huelva Experiences 
runs a tour of the route, which includes the anachronistically suburbanBarrio 
Reina Victoria, a dock and station constructed by the Rio Tinto company, and, 
as an add-on, the tomb of William Martin AKA Glyndwr Michael, The Man Who Never 
Was, whose body – along with documents detailing fake invasions of Greece and 
Sardinia – washed ashore here during the Second World War for the attention of 
German spies as part of Operation Mincemeat.

 Replicas of ships Columbus sailed to the Americas in at in La Rábida. 
Photograph: Alamy 
If it weren’t for the good people of Huelva, Columbus may never have reached 
the new world – his boats, sailors and funding were all procured from an 8-mile 
stretch along the steamy, sleepy Rio Tinto.

The untouristy Ruta Colombina takes you to Moguer where, behind the blinding 
white walls of the medievalSanta Clara Monastery, Columbus talked the Abbess 
into persuading her nephew, King Ferdinand, to back his madcap venture. The 
tours of this well-preserved place are fascinating (especially of note are the 
translucent alabaster windows and the massive great storks’ nests on top).

In Palos de la Frontera, 15 minutes’ drive south, there’s a collection of bits 
and bobs and a short docudrama about Columbus in what remains ofthe house of 
Martín Alonso Pinzón, the influential, wealthy mariner who, with his two 
brothers, joined the explorer on that first voyage in 1492. At theIglesia de 
San Jorgeround the corner, you can stand in the very spot the royal order was 
read out to unenthusiastic villagers, explaining they were to set sail with 
this Colón (Columbus) character to “certain parts of the ocean”.The Fontanilla, 
the old fountain at which the ships’ barrels were filled, is nearby but not the 
navigable river as its course was shifted in the Lisbon earthquake. So the 
excellent replicas of the threecaravales that made the voyage – the Niña, the 
Pinta and the Santa María – sit at a purpose-built dock, a little further south 
again inLa Rábida, below the monastery that accommodated Columbus from 
1491-1492 while he waited for his funds.

Vive!, Ayamonte
Describing itself as a “thematic shop of typical products – souvenirs, smells, 
gifts, personalised embroideries, flamenco, wine, preserved fish ... and 
more!”, this is the quintessential deli-bar with tables and umbrellas out 
front, and seating at the back of the aromatic interior, plus a helpful 
assistant, Loli, to guide customers through the choices. All Huelva’s bounty is 
on display from Jabugo hams and Condado de Huelva wine, and locally caught and 
canned fish in arty tins on fruit-crate shelves. It’s a sweet spot, popular in 
the evenings. Try Melquíades Saenz orange wine from Bodegas del Diezmo Nuevo.

Boat to Portugal

Ironically, one of the best things about Ayamonte (lovely as it is) is leaving 
it. The 15-minute ferry ride across the Guadiana takes you to a different 
country and time zone, specifically, toVilareal do Santo António where you can 
eatpastéis de nata and misunderstand another language for a bit, before getting 
the ferry back. The boat’s big enough to take cars, but this international 
experience is laid-back and stress-free. Ferries leave every 30 minutes from 
July to mid-September (from 9.30am-9pm), and every hour (until 8pm) during low 
season.

 Avoiding the crowds on one of the unspoilt beaches on Isla Cristina. 
Photograph: Alamy 
Those who want a really wild beach should head to the 14 miles between Mazagón 
and Matalascañas, where there’s little but streams, pines, sea, and sand, 
wafted into massive dunes, some over 100m high. From the “car park” atCuesta 
Maneli, a wooden walkway of almost a mile leads up and over the lofty Duna del 
Asperillo, ending at the virgin beach, Playa de Castilla. Further east, towards 
Matalascañas, there’s a sign for theLaguna del Jaral trail. Here the trip to 
the beach and back is sufficiently long (3½ miles) and adventurous (some 
hauling on a rope is required to get up and down the the sandy cliff) to put 
some people off hence a higher chance of splendid isolation. A third option is 
to head east from built-up Matalascañas into the protected beaches of the 
Doñana national park.The Beach Trail runs for 20 miles, ending on the banks of 
the Guadalquivir, opposite the fish restaurants ofSanlúcar de Barrameda.

For boat trips, there are few regions where it’s easier – or cheaper – to test 
the ocean waves, and there are innumerable operators up and down the coast. 
After watching boats slipping in and out of the marina atMazagón, you’ll want 
to be on one. TheRutas en Barco Mazagón

 Duna del Asperillo. Photograph: Alamy 
If you find the prospect of stumbling across nudists alarming, remain alert at 
all times when approaching the following areas (from west to east):Playa Flecha 
de Nueva Umbría, just south of Lepe (a mile or so beyond the village of Casas 
del Terrón);Playa de la Mata Negra, just west of Punta Umbría where the Odiel 
Marshes meet the sea in a mass of pines, junipers and dunes; the 3-mile stretch 
between the Mazagón parador and the photogenic Torre del Loro; andPlaya del 
Asperilloand Playa de Castilla, both accessed from Cuesta Maneli on the road to 
Matalascañas. All have designated nudist beach areas, although “textiles” – 
clothes wearers – are welcome.

An easy and jolly choice, Isla Cristina, wedged between marsh and sea, offers 
cream sand, lifeguards, a promenade, easy parking, a frontline of palms, small 
white hotels, bars, and restaurants serving cold beer, fresh sardines andarroz 
marinero. There are a selection of playas to suit everyone, from the 
family-friendlyPlaya del Carmen to La Redondela to the east, where you can 
abandon your car beside the woodenchiringuito (small bar) and follow the 
“chameleon route” through pine groves to find your own space in the dunes.

Just west of Huelva, the river Piedras runs parallel to the coast, creating an 
8-mile sandy spit,la Flecha del Rompido, and the beaches from El Rompido to El 
Portil are tucked behind it. So, emerging through the pines at Playa Nuevo 
Portil, you find yourself on one paradisiacal beach facing another, beyond 
which is a third and the Atlantic ocean. Small boats ferry people over the calm 
turquoise channel from three points along the length of la Flecha (€3 return). 
The sandbar is a protected area and utterly devoid of infrastructure, while
Nuevo Portilbenefits from a smattering of chiringuitos, among them Roman Chavez 
Marín’s friendly and chic KM6 (open 15 June-15 September), built from a 
shipping container, pallets and fruit boxes and shaded by sails. Come here for 
fresh fish at lunchtime, and for beach parties after dark.

 Acánthum, Huelva Coast, Spain 
Visit almost any restaurant along Huelva’s Costa de la Luz and you’ll find the 
same choice, which is fine because the fried every-type-of fish, seafood 
risotto, and jamón from the sierras is universally excellent. Nevertheless, a 
new breed of young chefs in the city of Huelva have taken the level of 
sophistication, innovation, and creativity of local fare to a higher plane. 
Most notable is Xanty Elías, whose restaurant, Acánthum, was the first in the 
province to be awarded a “sol” in Spain’s prestigious Repsol Guide. Elías spent 
two years at three Michelin-starred Arzak in San Sebastián, and it shows: not 
just oysters, but oyster withchicharrones (fried pork rinds) and an apple 
infusion; not just ham, but ham hock tartar and mustard ice-cream, and so on. 
Go for haute tapas at the bar or book in advance for the tasting menu (€65).

I could imagine riding through this cavernous bodega, clopping over the 
courtyard cobbles drinking wine, while the chef cooked a leg of lamb or venison 
over an open fire. Run by the third generation of a local family, this 
atmospheric restaurant looks more like 500 years old than 60 with its thick 
white walls, barrels, dark corners and hunting trophies. It specialises in 
grilled meat – rabbit, oxtail, pork and veal – and there is fish, but asking 
for a light salad is a no-no.

Bodeguita de los Raposo, Moguer 
There’s great food and no fuss at this unassuming, super-friendly local spot. 
Most people ignore the formal restaurant and cram into the patio, which is 
neon-lit and decorated with yokes, hoes, partridge cages, and things that look 
suspiciously like snares. What with that and europop on the radio, it may seem 
an inauspicious choice in this historic town, but the translucent ham (sliced 
from a leg dangling over the bar), the tongue-tingling ewe’s cheese, the 
piping-hot fried fish and spicy, oily patatas bravas can’t be bettered. A plus 
for ditherers is the check-box menu – a list of items available in €2,€3 or €4 
portions, and set menus with wine from €11.50.

Restaurante Toruño, El Rocío
To get a handle on the strange world that is the marshy outpost of El Rocío 
and a good choice ofcocina onubense (Huelva cooking), eat here. The walls are 
lined with old photos of locals playing guitar, riding through sand and mists, 
dancing flamenco and taking the patron saint on a tour of the town. Outside, in 
the shade of a 1,000-year-old olive tree, everyone appears to be related and 
inebriated, and waiters are serving drinks to well-turned out riders on 
well-turned out horses. The food is hearty, a perfect blend of local hunting, 
shooting, farming (partridge paté, venison, duck and pork) and fishing (prawns, 
sole and “various wild fish”), the Atlantic being just down the road. 
Ornithologists in particular will appreciate the tooting and murmured 
quark-quark serenade of waterfowl sploshing through the adjacent marsh.

There are views of an ocean liner in an urban oasis of pine and flowers at 
this cool boutique hotel. From the airy, glass-walled restaurant to the 18 
well-designed, sea-view rooms (each with private terrace or balcony), white 
sofas, chandeliers, polished concrete walls and chill-out bar beyond the pool, 
this little hotel offers a level of sophistication unusual in these parts. It’s 
five minutes’ walk to the beach and owner Lola (who, with her husband, designed 
the property) is an excellent source of recommendations for destinations 
further afield.

Parador de Ayamonte 
There are views of Portugal across the Guadiana from the tidy lawns of this 
calm, modern parador. Hot, glinting cars push on across the suspension bridge 
to a packed Algarve, while guests are content in the knowledge they have the 
lesser-known beaches of Isla Canela, just to the south. Rooms and lounging 
areas are simple, white and light. Given the proximity of river, marsh and sea, 
this is a top spot for dining on Huelva’s famous white prawns, skate and squid, 
while watching the best sunsets in Spain.

Hotel Plaza Escribano, Moguer
Those who visit the former home (now museum) of Nobel Laureate poet Juan Ramón 
Jiménez in Moguer, with its luminescent central courtyard, shuttered windows, 
geometric tiles and charm, inevitably wish they could check in there. However, 
Escribano makes a friendly, good-value, if plain (bar the candy-striped lobby 
and some lurid walls) alternative, and is well-placed for meandering around 
this old town’s narrow streets and plazas.

After something quintessentially Spanish? How about a 358-room hotel with 
all-you-can-eat buffet? Well-heeled Spanish families decamp to big beachfront 
hotels and apartment blocks for the summer, and this one – vast, 
air-conditioned, with pool and boardwalk to beach loungers and a 5-mile beach– 
is a pain-free option for those with kids. There’s an evening mini-disco and 
daily kids’ club activities, plus kitesurfing nearby, and boat trips across the 
estuary to the cafes, bars and beaches of Isla Cristina. If you want to see 
what the coast looked like before development, stroll over to the surprisingly 
intact fishing village ofPunta del Moral where you’ll find good wine and very 
cheeky drunk locals. Selected by Thomson, Melia also actively attracts 
independent travellers with bargain offers.

Hotel Toruño, El Rocío 
A cheery, relaxed hotel with comfy leather sofas, books, art, help-yourself 
homemade wine in the lobby and a very good restaurant next door. The rooms are 
simple, but offer fantastic views of flamingos picking their way through the 
marshes of Doñana. (But this sight is nothing in the context of the surreal, 
western filmset vibe pervading this unique backwater.) Good value, perfect 
location, with special packages available for ornithologists and astronomers.
