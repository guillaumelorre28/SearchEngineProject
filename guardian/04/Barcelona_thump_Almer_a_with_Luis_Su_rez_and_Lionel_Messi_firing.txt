Luis Suárez struck twice to help Barcelona to a 4-0 home victory over 
strugglingAlmería that kept them four points clear of second-placed Real Madrid
, who won atRayo Vallecano later on Wednesday.

Barça seized control at the Camp Nou before Lionel Messi, who had not scored 
in three matches since his double against Eibar three weeks ago, skipped in 
from the right wing in the 33rd minute and whipped a left-foot effort inside 
the far post.

Almería, who were third bottom at kick-off, defended doggedly but conceded 
again when Suárez netted an almost identical goal 10 minutes into the second 
half.

The Barça centre-back Marc Bartra, one of several second-choice players Luis 
Enrique deployed, added a third when he nodded in a Xavi corner with 15 minutes 
left and Pedro set up Suárez to make it 4-0 in stoppage time.

Barça have 74 points with eight games left and Real are on 70, five ahead of 
third-placed Atlético Madrid; the champions won 2-0 at home to Real Sociedad on 
Tuesday.
