The Guardian's global development editorial team have won the 2012-2013 UN 
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) A.H. Boerma medal.

The prize is presented every other year to journalists from different parts of 
the world who have brought the issues of rural development and food security in 
developing countries to the attention of society.

The team were unanimously chosen as winners this year for the significant 
contribution they have made to improving worldwide understanding of development 
issues, particularly agriculture, food security and poverty.

The UN FAO praised the team for providing high quality, in-depth and 
up-to-date multimedia coverage ranging from analysis of international policy, 
to on the ground reporting, and using new media formats to creatively and 
effectively communicate these important issues.
