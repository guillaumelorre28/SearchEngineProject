A small plane hit a bald eagle before it crashed just north of Anchorage, 
Alaska <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska>, last month, killing all 
four people on board.

An investigator said it is the nationâ€™s first civilian plane crash to result 
in deaths after an impact with a bald eagle.

Shaun Williams with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said there 
have been other crashes involving eagle strikes that resulted in serious 
injuries, not deaths.

The pilot, co-pilot and two passengers died when the plane went down on 20 
April near a small airport about 20 miles north of Anchorage.

Williams says an unknown substance was later found on the aircraft. Analysis 
at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC determined some of it was 
feathers and other materials that came from an immature bald eagle.

According to the Alaska Dispatch News 
<http://www.adn.com/article/20160504/ntsb-plane-fatal-birchwood-crash-was-struck-bald-eagle>
, one of the pilots was a 64-year-old former investigator who previously worked 
for the NTSB, an independent federal agency that investigates every civil 
aviation accident.
