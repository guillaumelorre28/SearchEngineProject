Boston's Matt Fraser had a playoff debut to remember, scoring early in 
overtime to give the Bruins a 1-0 victory at Montreal on Thursday, leveling 
theirNHL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl> Eastern Conference semifinal 
series 2-2.

Across the country, Anaheim beat in-form local rival Los Angeles 3-2 to cut 
the Kings' lead in the Western Conference series to 2-1.

Boston's Fraser was making his first playoff appearance after being called up 
Wednesday from Providence of the American Hockey League. He jumped into a 
scramble in front of Canadiens goalie Carey Price and slid the puck under him 
into the net.

Fraser scored after Johnny Boychuk's shot from the point took a high hop off 
the end boards and Price and defenseman Mike Weaver had trouble controlling the 
bouncing puck.

The Bruins will have a chance to take the lead in the series when they host 
Game 5 on Saturday.

Tuukka Rask made 33 saves for Boston, and Price stopped 34 shots to keep the 
game scoreless in regulation time.

Boston's Carl Soderberg had the best chance in the final minute after Montreal 
defenseman P.K. Subban's blind back pass was intercepted, but Price partially 
blocked the shot as it went off the crossbar.

Anaheim's Teemu Selanne scored the tiebreaking power-play goal late in the 
second period and the Ducks got the win they badly needed against Los Angeles.

Corey Perry got his first goal of the series and Ben Lovejoy scored with 2:55 
left to give the Ducks victory and halt the Kings' winning streak at six.

Anaheim's Jonas Hiller made seven saves in the final 9:58 after rookie 
starting goaltender Frederik Andersen left with a leg injury.

Jeff Carter and Mike Richards scored and Jonathan Quick stopped 19 shots for 
the Kings, who had not lost since Game 3 of the first-round series against San 
Jose, which they stunningly turned around with four-straight wins to snatch a 
4-3 victory.
