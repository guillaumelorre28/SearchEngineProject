At the end of June, Nasa’s Mars Curiosity rover completed its first Martian 
year <http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-199> – 687 Earth days 
– on the red planet. It has already achieved the mission’s main goal of 
determining whether conditions on Mars were once favourable for life, having 
discovered an ancient riverbed, a lakebed containing the essential elements 
needed for life and a chemical energy source used by some microbes on Earth.

The galaxy Messier 106, like the finale of a firework display, looks likely to 
burn itself out in a blaze of glory 
<http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-216>. Energetic jets 
blasting from the galaxy’s central black hole are heating up surrounding 
material and making it glow but they also power shock waves that are driving 
gases out of the galaxy’s interior. A new study estimates the shock waves have 
already ejected two-thirds of the gas from the centre of Messier 106. The lost 
gas would have been the building material for new stars, and without it Messier 
106 is likely to turn into a barren, lenticular galaxy full of old, red stars 
and no Catherine wheel spiral arms.

This is not the work of an abstract artist but a “slope map” of part of the 
floor of a crater on the moon. Warmer colours indicate steeper slopes and 
cooler colours are shallower slopes. Data for themap of Posidonius Crater 
<http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/796> was collected by the Lunar Reconnaissance 
Orbiter Camera. The sinuous “rilles” or gullies were carved by rivers of 
turbulent lava.

This picture, taken by astronomy photographer Michael Khan, puts the moon and 
Mars in perspective. It also puts in stark perspective any attempt to put 
humans on Mars. The red planet is the speck in the top-left quarter of the 
picture. Still can’s see it? For a better view,see the original

Like the naughty girls and boys who manage to appear several times in the same 
school photo, no fewer than 68 of the galaxies around this cluster feature more 
than once in this Hubble image. The explanation, of course, isn’t youthful high 
jinks butstrong gravitational lensing 
<http://sci.esa.int/hubble/54382-new-mass-map-of-a-distant-galaxy-cluster-is-the-most-precise-yet-heic1416/>
, when very large masses bend the light from more distant objects like a lens, 
distorting and fracturing the picture. The phenomenon has allowed astronomers 
to create the most precise map of the distribution of mass in a galaxy cluster 
ever made.

An unusual spate of eruptions 
<http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/puffing-sun-gives-birth-to-reluctant-eruption/#.U_IUZPb6rRp>
 was seen on the surface of the sun, described as “a series of fast puffs” 
followed by “the slow ejection of a massive burst of solar material from the 
sun’s atmosphere”. Nathalia Alzate, a solar scientist at the University of 
Aberystwyth in Wales, presented findings on what caused the puffs at the 2014 
Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting 
 <http://www.ras.org.uk/nam2014>in Portsmouth in June.

This is Rhea, one of 62 moons orbiting Saturn. Its tiny companion in this 
image captured by the Cassini space probe is called Epimetheus. Their periodic 
alignment is known as a “transit”.

Not the evil eye but an infrared image of the dust ring around the nearby star 
HR 4796A <http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1417/> in the southern 
constellation of Centaurus. It was one of the first pictures produced by an 
instrument called Sphere installed earlier this year on the Very Large 
Telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. Sphere is an exoplanet hunter, 
and this image reveals its talent for reducing the glare from very bright 
stars, allowing anything orbiting them to be more easily spotted and studied.
