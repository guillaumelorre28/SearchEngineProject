Kosovo police said on Thursday that they prevented simultaneous attacks by the 
Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> group, including on the 
Israeli national football team that played a World Cup qualifier in 
neighbouring Albania.

A police statement said plans were in place to attack Saturday’s match in 
Albania, and at the same time attack another target in Kosovo. Nineteen people 
were detained in Kosovo on 4 November, of whom one has since been released, 
police there said.Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> and 
Macedonia announced six more people were detained.

The Kosovo police said that at the suspects’ homes and premises officers found 
explosive devices, weapons and electronic equipment, including “religious 
material and literature from well-known authors recognised for their extremist 
ideology”.

The groups in the three countries, coordinated by two Albanians who are part 
of the IS terror group in Syria, had “clear targets on who and when should be 
attacked”, police said.

The venue of the qualifier was changed for “security reasons” from the 
northern city of Shkoder, near the border with Montenegro, to Elbasan, much 
nearer to the capital Tirana.Israel

Both Kosovo and Albanian authorities claim that no more of their citizens have 
joined the rebel groups in Syria and Iraq over the past year, but scores of 
them remain active with Isis fighting groups.
