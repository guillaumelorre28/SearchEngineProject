The Australian Bureau of Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-bureau-of-statistics> 
inadvertently released contact names linked to more than 5,000 Queensland 
businesses in what was described as a “human error”.

The breach is one of 14 the ABS has reported to the Office of the Australian 
Information Commissioner since 2013,and was released to Guardian Australia 
under freedom of information laws.

The ABS has come under scrutiny over its handling of the 2016 census, 
initially for the extended retention of names and addresses for a period of 
four years. It then faced further criticism after the census website crashed,
which it attributed to a series of foreign attacks

While none of the breaches reported to the OAIC relates to the handling of any 
census data, some do highlight errors in the handling of other surveys as well 
as failures to correctly de-identify data, which is one of the criticisms 
raised by privacy advocates about the increased retention of census data.

But they also demonstrate the ABS has taken a proactive approach to reporting 
data breaches – including relatively minor incidents where the recipients of 
emails are accidentally not BCCed – which is not mandatory under existing 
privacy laws.

No details about two of the 14 data breaches have been disclosed by the ABS, 
which said that would have a “substantial adverse effect” on its operations.

A statement the ABS issued 
<http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/home/ABS+Media+Statements+-+Response+to+FOI+request+by+Paul+Farrell+(The+Guardian)>
 as it simultaneously released the documents on Friday afternoon said it 
believed that 12 of the cases “did not warrant reporting” according to the 
privacy commissioner’s own guidelines, but that it had taken a “precautionary 
or ‘pro-disclosure’ approach” to reporting potential breaches.


In one of the breaches in January 2016, contact names linked to more than 
5,000 businesses were disclosed to two officers in theQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government 
statistician’s office, in breach of privacy laws and the ABS’s own regulations.

The list was destroyed, and the staff members who compiled it were counselled. 
The individuals identified were not notified of the breach because the ABS 
considered it to be “minor”, and the matter was attributed by the ABS to human 
error.

“The team that compiled the list was provided with specifications which did 
not include personal information. Unfortunately, the list that was produced was 
not consistent with the specifications, and personal information was included.


“Normally this oversight would have been detected during the clearance 
process, however, the presentation of the list made it unclear personal 
information had been included.”

Other breaches reported by the ABS to the privacy commissioner include:

 * An interviewer who lost a folder containing summary details from a 
participant in the household income and expenditure survey in October 2015. The 
loss was described as a “one-off event that has been contained”, and the 
interviewer was counselled. 
 * Two instances in October 2015 in the engineering and construction survey 
where participants received envelopes relating to their companies’ 
participation that also contained letters to other companies. The breach was 
attributed to an “error in the machinery used to insert letters into envelopes 
in preparation for mail-out”. 
 * The sending out of 42 building activity survey forms that had been 
incorrectly pre-filled with information about other building jobs in November 
2014. The ABS said the error was caused by a “mail-merging error” that was a 
one-off issue. 
 * The inadvertent release in 2013 of the name, date of birth, country of 
birth and year of arrival in Australia of a person to an incorrect household as 
part of a household survey. It was caused by a “pre-filling” error of an ABS 
survey form. 
 * The name and addresses of previous vehicle owners were disclosed in August 
2014 to new owners in the course of a survey into motor vehicle use. The error 
was caused by a “manual error” in the entry of online forms by ABS staff. 
The ABS statement said the privacy commissioner was not making any ongoing 
inquiries in relation to the notifications.

“There have been no notifications related to the census,” it said. “The census 
processes for collection, storage and analysis are very well tested, secure, 
and operate in isolation from other ABS collections.

“The ABS is confident that all 14 notifications could have been prevented by 
improved infrastructure; removing the need for manual processing and 
intervention that is currently undertaken.”

The ABS is still gathering responses from the 2016 census, which some 
Australians have said they will boycott owing to the privacy concerns raised.
