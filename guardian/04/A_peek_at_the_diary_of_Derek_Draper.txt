I'm still buzzing after our recent World Exclusive OK! magazine cover, "GMTV's 
Kate Garraway andDerek Draper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/derek-draper> introduce you to their new 
baby Billy." The only thing that annoyed me was it didn't say "psychotherapist 
Derek Draper". Still, it is quite a long word. And I could not be prouder of 
Billy's money-spinning powers. He must be in the top tenth of a percentile for 
having parents willing to do anything for a wedge of Richard Desmond's money. 
This morning seemed a case in point when I picked him up and realised he'd yet 
again asserted his extraordinariness.

I picked up the phone to OK! "He's done a crap," I told the editor. "I realise 
it's probably not a cover story, but we were thinking it might be a 10-page 
spread inside. If it helps, we've just had one of those fake Victorian 
ball-and-claw baths put in, and some downlighters in the hall, so that might 
add home makeover value to the story." No dice.

But then I had a brainwave. "Kate, let's get him christened! After all, I'm 
now a practising Christian. And though sometimes I've forgotten to practise, 
like when I was thrilling to the idea of smearing someone as mentally ill or 
STD-ridden, I think I've been making great strides recently."

"A christening?" Kate said. "I don't understand: what's in it for us?"

"An OK! cover, of course," I shrieked. "Think about it, love. It's what the 
Katonas and Prices do. We have got to be more intelligent about the way we 
manage our celebrity."
