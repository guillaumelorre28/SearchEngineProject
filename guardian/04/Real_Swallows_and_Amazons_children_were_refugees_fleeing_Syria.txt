, G2, 26 July) makes the point that the new production of Swallows and Amazons 
harks back to a “kinder, better-dressed, and simpler” world of 1935, 
“celebrating a past that never existed”, and a “time before multicultural 
Britain”. In fact, the real life story of the Altounyan children, on whom 
Arthur Ransome based the Walker children, would have been so much more 
interesting and “true” to today’s young audiences. They were from a mixed-race 
British, Irish and Armenian background, and spent chunks of their childhood in 
the Lake District as refugees from war in Aleppo, Syria. What a truly 
fascinating, relevant, and diverse production that would have been.
