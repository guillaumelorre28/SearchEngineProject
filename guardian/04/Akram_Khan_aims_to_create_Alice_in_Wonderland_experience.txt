It is unquestionably a visual art show in a gallery with works by Anish 
Kapoor, Antony Gormley and Nadav Kander but there will also – because Akram 
Khan is in charge – be dancers hanging from the ceiling: theLowry Centre 
<http://www.thelowry.com> in Salford will on Saturday open to the public one of 
the most ambitious visual art projects it has ever staged 
<http://www.thelowry.com/event/akram-khan-one-side-to-the-other1>.

Khan, one of the UK’s most celebrated contemporary dance artists, has been 
asked to curate a show in which he chooses the art and decides how it is seen.

In practice that means an exhibition that will have sculpture, painting and 
photography for six days of the week. But on Saturday the space will become, in 
addition, a performance – with visitors led through what becomes a live 
installation with dance and music.

Khan said he hoped it would be an almost Alice in Wonderland experience for 
visitors.

“When I look at visual art I’m interested in the space around it, I want to 
live in the space that the artwork exists in,” he said.

Khan is the second artist in a series the Lowry has called Performer as 
Curator and follows theexhibition curated by musician Alison Goldfrapp a year 
ago

.

He was delighted to be asked, but he admitted: “I thought what do I know about 
curating? I thought this is suicidal for them. I was terrified by it.”

The show has works by artists he admires greatly. “I feel blessed to be born 
in a generation where I’ve come across Anish Kapoor’s and Antony Gormley’s 
work,” he said.

“Anish is the only artist apart from Rothko where he doesn’t have to talk 
about the spirituality of his work. It just is spiritual. He is one of those 
artists who will be remembered 100 years later, people will still be speaking 
his name.”

The exhibition is curated by Khan but is also about Khan, exploring themes 
that he comes back to time and again in his dance work – the extremes of 
things, whether young and old, light and dark, truth and fiction, doubt and 
certainty.

“I want to awake people’s senses. The experience is about my relationship with 
visual art, or visual things, visual objects.”

The young and old theme can be seen clearly in the decision to hang the 
excellent work of 8-year-old Thomas Newton. Like so many of his older peers it 
is ‘Untitled’ and it was chosen after the Lowry asked pupils at Ellenbrook 
primary school in Salford to submit artworks that explored nature.

Other artists in the show include Kate MccGwire, Serena Smith, Darvish Fakhr 
and if you look very closely in the last part of the exhibition, some lichen 
along the skirting board installed by Miz Nakaishi, a site-specific piece 
called Fluffs Between the Gaps of Society.

Khan said art had always been: “A great source of nourishment for my mind, my 
body and my heart.

“Its form is irrelevant, whether it be painting, dancing, singing, acting, 
because in the end all forms of ‘art’ are primarily about connecting, 
communicating, telling stories, emotionally provoking the other.”

Michael Simpson, the Lowry’s director of visual art and engagement, said the 
Performer as Curator series was “one of the most ambitious exhibition projects 
in the Lowry’s history.”

He added: “Handing over the reins of our galleries to a performer from a 
completely different art form, be they singer, dancer or actor, is incredibly 
exciting. We were delighted when Akram agreed to be part of the series and his 
exhibition will be a surprise to many.”

Khan is the curator but he stressed it is a collaborative show, with creative 
direction by Sasha Milavic-Davies.

Undoubtedly the best time to come is on a Saturday when there are guided 
performances at 10.30am, 11.30am, 12.30pm, 2.30pm and 3.30pm. They are free but 
demand is expected to be high so the Lowry is asking that places be pre-booked.

How audiences react remains to be seen. Khan fears they might emerge from it 
baffled.

For him though the whole experience had been “exhilarating to create a sort of 
surreal, Alice in Wonderland landscape of extremes and whatever may be in 
between.”
