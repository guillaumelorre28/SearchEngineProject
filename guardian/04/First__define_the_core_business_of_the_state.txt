Let's start with the obvious. It may have been a challenge to deliver 
efficiency savings in good times, but in hard times it will not be enough. 
Something more strategic is needed, defining what the core business of the 
state is and how it can best be delivered. Innovation becomes imperative, but 
it now means enlisting the creative energy of staff whose pay is frozen. Simply 
resisting cuts will not be an adequate (or effective) response. Whoever wins 
the election, managing public services in tougher times will be the name of the 
game.

Public service reform will intensify, not to improve quality but to get the 
same for less (or, more likely, less for less). Forget about the kind of choice 
that costs more, which almost all choice does. The private and third sectors 
will be looked to for savings, but these may well turn out to be illusory. At 
risk will be the more promising public service developments of recent times, 
not least the emphasis on personalisation and the attempt to assemble a set of 
service entitlements – public service guarantees – for users. This promises 
much and should not be abandoned just because some people are now more 
interested in cutting the state down to size.
