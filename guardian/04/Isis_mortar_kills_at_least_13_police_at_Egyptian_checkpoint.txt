At least 13 Egyptian policemen were killed in the Sinai peninsula when Islamic 
militants fired a mortar round at a security checkpoint in the city of Arish, 
security and medical sources said on Saturday.

Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> claimed responsibility 
on several websites for the attack and Egyptian state media later confirmed it.


Ambulances were subjected to heavy gunfire as they attempted to reach the 
wounded, sources said. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a massive explosion and 
said the city’s entrances and exits had been closed off by security forces.


Security sources said government forces later killed five of the militants who 
had carried out the attack.

Egypt is battling an insurgency that gained pace after its military overthrew 
President Mohamed Morsi

 of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest Islamist movement, in mid-2013 
following mass protests against his rule.


The insurgency, mounted by Isis’s Egyptian branch, Sinai Province

, has killed hundreds of soldiers and police and started to attack western 
targets in the country.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi

, the former military chief who led the overthrow of Morsi, describes Islamic 
militancy as an existential threat to Egypt, which is an ally of the United 
States. Isis controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and has a presence in 
Libya, which borders Egypt.
