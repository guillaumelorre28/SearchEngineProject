In November, a 10-year-journey through space – the Rosetta mission 
<http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta> – will culminate in 
landing a craft called Philae on a comet – 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) 
– to study it and also possibly unlock the secrets of the universe. Above, is a 
selfie taken from about 10 miles from the comet’s surface by the landing craft. 
It shows one of its 14-metre-long solar arrays, with the comet in the 
background. Gas and dust jets extending from the comet’s ‘neck’ region are 
clearly visible. The primary landing site, currently known as site J, can also 
be seen on the smaller lobe of the comet.

A closeup mosaic of the comet shows large boulders, several metres across, 
lying in the smooth ‘neck’ region. Boulders are also seen at the base of 
exposed cliff faces, towards the top left in this image, and on the ‘head’ of 
the comet. A crater-like depression is located on the larger lobe (or the 
‘body’), to the far-left centre of the image.Scientists have announced the

Northern lights, Aurora Borealis, as seen from the ISS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2014/sep/25/northern-lights-iss-timelapse-video>
. The northern lights are caused by collisions between fast-moving particles, 
electrons, from space and the oxygen and nitrogen gas in our atmosphere. These 
electrons originate in the magnetosphere, the region of space controlled by 
Earth’s magnetic field. As they rain into the atmosphere, the electrons impart 
energy to oxygen and nitrogen molecules, making them excited. When the 
molecules return to their normal state, they release photons, small bursts of 
energy in the form of light.

This is the second largest spiral galaxy discovered by Hubble Space Telescope, 
measuring over 500,000 light-years across from tip to tip. It’s known as NGC 
6872 and sits in the costellation of Pavo (the Peacock). Its unusual shape is 
caused by its interactions with the smaller galaxy seen above it, called IC 
4970. They both lie roughly 300 million light-years away from Earth. In size it 
is beaten only by NGC 262, a galaxy that measures a mind-boggling 1.3 million 
light-years in diameter. The Milky Way, measures between 100,000 and 120,000 
light-years across. The upper left spiral arm of NGC 6872 is distorted and 
populated by star-forming regions, appearing blue on this image. This may have 
been be caused by IC 4970 recently passing through this arm although here, 
recent means 130 million years ago!

This seemingly disco-lit rooftop keeps an eye on the Northern Celestial Pole 
from the Allgäu Public Observatory in Ottobeuren, Germany. Seen here is the 
facility’s 0.6-metre Cassegrain reflector telescope, which was installed in 
1996. The yellow laser beam, fanning out, is ESO’s Wendelstein laser guide star 
unit, used to create a bright spot in the sky as an artificial reference star, 
allowing astronomers to measure how the real stars blur or twinkle. The 
measurements are then used to correct blurring and enable sharper images to be 
taken – the process is known as adaptive optics.

An artist’s impression of supernova 1993J, which exploded in the galaxy M81. 
Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have identified the blue 
helium-burning companion star, seen at the centre of the expanding nebula of 
debris from the supernova. The discovery confirms a long-held theory that the 
supernova occurred inside what is called a binary system, where two interacting 
stars caused a cosmic explosion.

The tropics of Mars are littered with small bright ripples shaped by the wind. 
Called ‘transverse aeolian ridges’, or Tars, they are six meters tall and 
spaced a few meters apart and often found in channels and craters. Their 
internal structure remains a msytery, making it difficult to know how they were 
formed. Sarah Mattson of the University of Arizona discovered these rare banded 
Tars in Iapygia, south of Syrtis Major. They resemble Tars elsewhere onMars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/mars>, except that they show bands or 
layers on the northwest side but fewer or none on the southeast. One possible 
interpretation is that these Tars are made up of wedge-shaped layers. If 
correct, it implies that the ripples grew vertically over time, as material 
accreted at the crests of the ridges. It also suggests that the banded slopes 
faced upwind.

Nasa’s Curiosity Mars rover has collected its first sample of Mount Sharp. It 
drilled 2.6 inches deep into a basal-layer outcrop on the layered mountain and 
collected a powdered-rock sample. Data and images confirmed success of this 
operation. The powder collected by the drilling is temporarily held within the 
sample-handling mechanism on the rover’s arm. The rock is softer than any of 
the previous three targets where Curiosity has collected a drilled sample for 
analysis.

Millions of galaxies fill the patch of sky known as the Cosmos field, short 
for Cosmic Evolution Survey, a portion of which is shown here. Even the 
smallest dots in this image are galaxies, some up to 12 billion light-years 
away. The square region in the centre of bright objects is where the telescope 
was blinded by bright light. However, even these brightest objects in the field 
are more than 10,000 times fainter than what you can see with the naked eye. 
The picture was composed using a combination of infrared and visible-light data 
from Japan’s Subaru telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

Inside Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Centre’s giant clean room in Greenbelt, 
Maryland, US, optical engineer Larkin Carey from Ball Aerospace examines two 
test mirror segments recently placed on a black composite structure called the 
James Webb Space Telescope’s ‘Pathfinder’. It acts as a spine supporting the 
telescope’s primary mirror segments. The Pathfinder is a non-flight prototype. 
The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be the most 
powerful space telescope ever built. Webb is an international project led by 
Nasa with its partners, theEuropean Space Agency

This Hubble Space Telescope image shows the gargantuan galaxy M60 in the 
centre, and the ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 below it and to the right, 
and also enlarged as an inset. A new international study led by University of 
Utah astronomer Anil Seth and published in the journal Nature found that 
M60-UCD1 is the smallest known galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its 
centre, suggesting the dwarf galaxy originally was much larger but was stripped 
of its outer layers by gravity from galaxy M60 over billions of years. M60’s 
gravity is also pulling galaxy NGC4647, upper right, and the two eventually 
will collide.

Mimas, one of Saturn’s moon, appears in the lower-right corner of the image. 
It orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing spokes appear in the B ring 
(just to the right of centre). Spokes are ghostly features that stretch across 
B ring, and usually have a long, finger-like or wedge-shaped appearance. They 
form in minutes and last an hour or two before disappearing again. Scientists 
expect that spokes will soon cease to form asSaturn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/saturn> approaches northern equinox. The 
exact mechanism of spoke formation is still the subject of debate, but ring 
scientists do know that spokes no longer appear when the sun is higher in 
Saturn’s sky. It is believed that this has to do with the ability of 
micron-sized ring grains to maintain an electrical charge and levitate above 
the rings, forming spokes. Thus, these may be some of the last spokes ever seen 
by Cassini.

Saturn is mostly a gigantic ball of rotating gas. But it has one thing in 
common with Earth: weather. It’s among the most bizarre in our solar system, 
such as the swirling storm shown in this Cassini view. Known as ‘the hexagon’, 
this features an intense, six-sided jet stream at Saturn’s north pole. Spanning 
some 18,640 miles across, it hosts howling 199miles/h winds that spiral around 
a massive storm rotating anticlockwise at the heart of the region. Numerous 
small vortices rotate in the opposite direction to the central storm and are 
dragged around with the jet stream, creating a terrifically turbulent region. 
While a hurricane on Earth may last a week or more, the hexagon has been raging 
for decades, and shows no signs of letting up.

This image from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) survey at ESO’s Paranal 
Observatory in northern Chile shows the globular cluster Messier 54. This 
cluster looks very similar to many others, but it doesn t belong to the Milky 
Way, and is part of a small satellite galaxy, the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. 
This unusual parentage has allowed astronomers to use the VLT to test whether 
unexpectedly low levels of the element lithium in stars are also found in stars 
outside the Milky Way. Astronomers can calculate accurately how much lithium 
they expect to find in the early universe, and from this work out how much they 
should see in old stars. But the numbers don’t match — there is about three 
times less lithium in stars than expected. This mystery remains, despite 
several decades of work.
