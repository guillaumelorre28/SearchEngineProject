Charee Stanley, 40, filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission in Detroit last week. 

Her attorney said the Atlanta-based airline initially agreed to a religious 
accommodation, telling her another flight attendant could handle passenger 
requests for alcohol. 

However, the attorney said Stanley was put on a 12-month unpaid leave last 
month after another attendant complained. 

Lena Masri, an attorney with the Michigan chapter of the Council on 
American-Islamic Relations, said the employee’s complaint against Stanley had 
“Islamophobic” overtones, as it noted she carried a book with “foreign 
writings” and wore a head scarf. 

ExpressJet issued a statement saying the airline values diversity but could 
not comment on personnel matters.
