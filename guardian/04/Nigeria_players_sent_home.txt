Premiership pair Celestine Babayaro and Aiyegbeni Yakubu have been thrown out 
of the Nigeria's squad for indiscipline.

Chelsea defender Babayaro, Portsmouth striker Yakubu and Schalke's Victor 
Agali have all been asked to leave the team camp in Tunisia.

Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria> were preparing at their 
Monastir base for their second match of the tournament against South Africa.

"They did not respect the rules of the camp, they were supposed to be in 
quarters with the rest of the squad," Taiwo Obunjobi, general secretary of the 
Nigerian Football Association, told L'Equipe.

"They only returned to the hotel this Friday morning. 

"We have informed the team through the captain, Jay-Jay Okocha, and have 
received the approval of the sports minister and it was decided that discipline 
must be maintained and the players involved leave the camp immediately."

Nigeria lost their opening game 1-0 to Morocco on Tuesday, and now face a 
must-win encounter against Bafana Bafana if they want to progress.
