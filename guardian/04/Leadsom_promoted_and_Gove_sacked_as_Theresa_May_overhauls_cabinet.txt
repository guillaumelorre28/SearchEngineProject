Theresa May has unveiled a wholesale reconstruction of the cabinet, with 
Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan among the big names leaving the government and 
those promoted includingJustine Greening 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/justine-greening>, Liz Truss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-truss> and the prime minister’s 
one-time leadership rival Andrea Leadsom.

Almost all the cabinet jobs changed hands, but the few non-movers were the 
health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the defence secretary,Michael Fallon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michael-fallon>, and Alun Cairns at the 
Wales office. Of the 21 cabinet posts announced, seven went to women, almost 
exactly the same proportion as under David Cameron.

One of the major changes was structural, with Greg Clark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/greg-clark>, formerly the communities 
secretary, to head a newly created Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy. This swallows up what was left of the business department 
– after large sections were transferred to other ministries – along with energy 
and climate change, and brought criticism that May was not treating 
environmental concerns seriously enough.

May made her first major appointments on Wednesday evening, naming Philip 
Hammond chancellor andBoris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/boris-johnson-life-xenophobic-gaffes>
 foreign secretary. The first big move of Thursday was the departure of Gove. 
Among the other casualties wereJohn Whittingdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-whittingdale>, the culture 
secretary, and Oliver Letwin the Cabinet Office minister.


Also gone is Stephen Crabb – the work and pensions secretary and one of the 
contenders for David Cameron’s job – seemingly voluntarily. Crabb said he had 
resigned from the government “in the best interests of my family”. This 
followed a story in the Times at the weekend in which it was alleged that 
Crabb, who is married, had sent sexually explicit social media messages to a 
young woman.

There were numerous reports that Hunt was going to lose his job, but Downing 
Street said he would remain. Hunt tweeted that reports of his demise had been 
greatly exaggerated:
Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) 
'Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated...' Thrilled to be back in 
the best job in Government.

 Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, left after refusing a move. 
She said on her Facebook page: “The new prime minister was kind enough to offer 
me a role but it was not one which I felt I could take on.” Villiers did not 
say what role she turned down.

Villiers’ replacement as Northern Ireland secretary is James Brokenshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/04/future-of-eu-nationals-in-uk-not-guaranteed-says-james-brokenshire-video>
, whose elevation to the cabinet had been widely expected after five years as a 
junior minister in May’s Home Office and his early backing for her leadership 
campaign. The position could grow in importance in the coming years, asNorthern 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, which voted in favour 
of remaining in the EU, wrestles with the implications of Brexit.

One of the early appointments on Thursday was Truss, previously environment 
secretary, who emerged from No 10 to announce she had been appointed justice 
secretary and lord chancellor. She is the first woman in either role.

Greening <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/justine-greening> was promoted 
to education secretary and minister for women and equalities, moving from 
international development. She is the first education secretary to have had a 
comprehensive school education and will run a beefed-up department, taking in 
higher and further education from the Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills.

Leadsom, the final challenger to May for the leadership, who removed herself 
from the race on Monday after appearing to argue thatbeing a mother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/10/andrea-leadsom-apologises-for-motherhood-remarks>
 made her the better choice, has seemingly not suffered too much for her 
actions. She has been promoted from energy minister to a full cabinet post as 
environment secretary.

After Whittingdale’s exit, the post of culture secretary has gone to Karen 
Bradley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/14/xxxx-john-whittingdale-culture-secretary-bbc>
, formerly a junior Home Office minister.


Whittingdale, whose tenure saw a major re-examination of the BBC, announced 
his departure on Twitter:
John Whittingdale (@JWhittingdale) 
Has been a privilege to serve as Culture Secretary. I wish my successor every 
success & will continue to support creative industries
 <https://twitter.com/JWhittingdale/status/753523405022986240> July 14, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JWhittingdale/status/753523405022986240> 
Chris Grayling <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling>, who 
chaired May’s leadership campaign, was appointed transport secretary. This is 
arguably a sideways move for a minister who attracted much criticism as justice 
secretary before moving to leader of the Commons, although his new role will 
involve some potentially difficult decisions connected to airport expansion and 
the HS2 rail project.


Patrick McLoughlin, who previously held the transport role, has become 
chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Conservative party chairman. The 
former, a non-portfolio job, does not usually come with full cabinet status, 
though incumbents often attend.

Damian Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/14/senior-tory-damian-green-chris-grayling-peddling-myths-eu-referendum>
, a former immigration minister and police minister who has been out of 
government for two years, has his first cabinet post as work and pensions 
secretary, Downing Street announced. Green, 60, is a relatively experienced MP, 
having represented Ashford in Kent since 1997.

Sajid Javid, formerly the business secretary, has been moved to become the 
communities and local government secretary, according to another Downing Street 
statement. The change in role could be interpreted as a sideways move or slight 
demotion for the former banker.

Gavin Williamson, a Staffordshire MP who spent nearly three years as Cameron’s 
parliamentary private secretary, was promoted to become chief whip.

One of the final appointments was Priti Patel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/priti-patel-warns-of-eu-migration-threat-to-uk-class-sizes>
, the employment minister and a leading voice for Brexit, who was promoted to 
run international development.

Gove, who fell out badly with May over religious extremism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/theresa-may-v-michael-gove-personality-clash-with-long-history>
 when she was home secretary and he was education secretary, was dismissed on 
Thursday morning, according to sources. He had stood against May to replace 
Cameron as Conservative leader but fell in the second round of voting. Shortly 
after his departure was confirmed, he wished best of luck to the new government:
Michael Gove (@michaelgove) 
It's been an enormous privilege to serve for the last six years. Best of luck 
to the new government - MG

<https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/753529739860738049> 
Morgan, who supported Gove’s leadership bid, was dismissed as education 
secretary. She tweeted:

Letwin left the post of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and saw the role 
Cameron had just given him as head of his Brexit unit rendered defunct.

There was also a new leader of the House of Lords, Lady Evans, ennobled in 
2014 after a career in thinktanks and education policy.
May's cabinet 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/07/new-cabinet/embed/embed.html> 
News of the awarding of six cabinet posts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/philip-hammond-appointed-chancellor-as-george-osborne-exits>
 came hours after May went to Buckingham Palace to formally become prime 
minister.

As well as Hammond and Johnson, another major appointment announced on 
Wednesday wasAmber Rudd <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd> as 
home secretary. Rudd moves up from her position as energy secretary despite 
only entering parliament in 2010.

Two other jobs were given to strong Brexit supporters brought back from the 
cold. David Davis took on the new job of secretary of state for exiting theEU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, six years after he resigned as shadow 
home secretary torefight his parliamentary seat in a protest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/12/daviddavis.conservatives> 
over detention without trial for terror suspects.

Liam Fox <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox>, who quit as defence 
secretary in 2011amid revelations his close friend, the lobbyist Adam Werritty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resignation-adam-werritty>
, had travelled with him on official business, was made secretary of another 
new ministry for international trade.

The new chief secretary to the Treasury was announced as David Gauke, who 
moves up a place in the department’s pecking order, whileDavid Mundell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/13/david-mundell-scotland-secretary-hostile-tories-commands-respect>
 remains as secretary of state for Scotland, little surprise as he is the only 
Tory MP in the country.

The final appointment was David Lidington as leader of the Commons, a very 
late debut in cabinet for the former Europe minister, who has been in 
parliament since 1992.
