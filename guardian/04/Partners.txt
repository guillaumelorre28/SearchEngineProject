Find Your Feet <http://www.fyf.org.uk>
Find Your Feet is dedicated to creating lasting solutions to poverty. 
Established in 1960, we work with some of the poorest people living in rural 
India and Malawi to transform their lives and their community.
We know that there are no quick-fix solutions to poverty. Our experience has 
taught us that people in poor communities are best placed to help themselves 
overcome poverty.

We are currently providing training, resources and support to enable 36,000 
vulnerable families to improve their harvests, set up small businesses, access 
healthcare, education and clean water, and have a voice in their community.
