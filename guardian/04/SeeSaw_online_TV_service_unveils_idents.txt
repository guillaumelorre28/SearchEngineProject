The online TV service SeeSaw has unveiled its brand identity as its parent 
company,Arqiva <https://www.theguardian.com/media/arqiva>, steps up plans to 
launch in the UK in the coming months.

SeeSaw <https://www.theguardian.com/media/seesaw>, built from the assets of 
ITV, Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide's defunct Project Kangaroo video-on-demand 
venture, will be represented by a pair of "play" triangles of the type 
typically seen when using digital TV services in a variety of animated idents 
as well as in a logo.

The company said that the brief animated idents, the first of which is called 
"fish", aimed to "bring to life the concept of customers being able to play 
on-demand programming". The "fish" ident is meant to have a "playful tone of 
voice which reflects the brand's light-hearted personality".

One of the symbols faces forwards, representing the VOD TV experience of 
today, and the other backwards representing more traditional television viewing.

The animations, developed by Rudd Studio, will see the symbols used in 
different ways to supposedly "convey different moods and genres of TV".

"SeeSaw will provide viewers with a consumer-friendly, easy-to-navigate, video 
on demand service and the brand identity reflects this," said Maya Bhose, the 
head of brand marketing at SeeSaw.

SeeSaw has refused to state when it intends to launch into the UK market. 
However, the company has recently accelerated its plans,appointing the ad 
agency Fallon 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/29/arqiva-seesaw-online-tv-fallon> 
and the media agency Vizeum to prepare a £5m campaign and preparing to launch a 
beta version of the service.
