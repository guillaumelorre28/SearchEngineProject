Björk Digital


A digitally decadent celebration of Björk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork>’s 20-year career arrives in the 
capital this September. Incorporating performance, film and installations, the 
exhibition explores the extensive output created by the Icelandic artist, whose 
boundary-pushing projects are always driven by a fascination with nature, 
technology, sex and heartache. The exhibition will feature previously unseen 
work and interactive displays – including her 360-degree virtual-reality video 
for Stonemilker, in which the audience come face to face with the musician on a 
stormy-skied beach. Midway through the run come two London shows, at the Royal 
Albert Hall on 21 September and Hammersmith Apollo on 24 September.
•1 September to 23 October, Somerset House, London

Jack White: Acoustic Recordings 1998-2016

Fresh from launching a vinyl record into space 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/01/jack-white-play-first-vinyl-record-space-third-man-records>
, Jack White compiles a self-explanatory career-spanning selection that points 
up his oeuvre’s debt to traditional American music, including a previously 
unreleased White Stripes track, solo material, tracks by the Raconteurs, his 
contributions to the soundtrack of Cold Mountain and a song he wrote for a 
Coca-Cola advert. It’s available on CD and vinyl, but there should be an option 
for the committed fan, whereby a medicine show parks its wagon outside your 
house and an itinerant musician called Peg Leg Sam sings it all to you.

 Always interesting … MIA. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images 
MIA: AIM

MIA <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia>’s recorded output has been of 
variable quality in recent years, but it’s never less than interesting. Looking 
at the supporting cast she has assembled for her fifth album, there seems no 
reason to doubt AIM is going to be interesting as well: Zayn Malik of One 
Direction has been drawn into the fold, alongside Skrillex, long-term sideman 
Diplo and Kanye West collaborator Hit-Boy. But ultimately, it’s about her: as 
evidenced by the handful of tracks she’s already teased, there is still no one 
that sounds remotely like her.

Billy Joel

It’s years – decades – since Billy Joel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/billy-joel> appeared in the upper echelons 
of the charts, but he’s spent the time diligently presenting himself as the 
hardest-working arena rocker in the world. For the past three years, he has 
played once a month at the 18,000-capacity Madison Square Garden in New York. 
Now he’s proving his appeal still crosses the Atlantic, with a sellout stadium 
show at Wembley stadium.

London jazz festival

The 24th London jazz festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/london-jazz-festival> brings a ten-day 
cavalcade of jazz music’s risen and rising stars in November. Saxophone master 
Wayne Shorter, also one of jazz’s great composers, appears with his empathic 
quartet, Madeleine Peyroux pays tribute to songwriters from Sister Rosetta 
Tharpe to Tom Waits and Robert Glasper, Joshua Redman with Brad Mehldau, Tord 
Gustavsen, Andy Sheppard celebrating Gil Evans, and vocal innovator Norma 
Winstone celebrating her 75th, are just a few of the tantalising prospects on

 Bookies’ favourite … David Bowie. Photograph: web 
The Hyundai Mercury prize


In recent years, the Mercury prize shortlist has shown a weird propensity to 
make the British music scenes that it’s supposed to represent look 
substantially less vibrant than they are, which may be one of the reasons 
public interest seems to have declined. This year, the shortlist is hard to 
pick holes in: it’s musically broader and more diverse than before, the stuff 
that’s on it is of an unerringly high quality. At the time of writing, David 
Bowie’s Blackstar is bookies’ favourite, but the bookies are notoriously bad at 
picking Mercury winners: frankly, the field looks completely open.

A longstanding summer fixture in Brooklyn, “the most multicultural festival in 
the US” arrives in London for a day. The lineup at the main event in Alexandra 
Palace is impressively diverse, with Grace Jones, Laura Mvula, Lady Leshurr, 
MNEK, metal-influenced rappers HO99o9, punk trio Skinny Girl Diet, Young

Bruce Springsteen: Born to Run

The Boss has been writing his autobiography since 2009, and the hope has to be 
that rock’s great communicator will be a little less obtuse than his fellow 
greats Bob Dylan and Neil Young were in their own memoirs, just as his own 
shows tend to be rather more straightforwardly celebratory than theirs. In his 
foreword to the book, Springsteen has promised it will answer two questions 
he’s often asked: how and why he does what he does.

Bon Iver: 22, a Million

The third Bon Iver album seems a long way indeed from Justin Vernon recording 
For Emma, Forever Ago alone in a cabin in Wisconsin. It arrives wrapped in 
“symbol-rich” album artwork, bearing track titles inspired by the alternative 
alphabet, leet: best of luck shouting out for10 d E A T h b R E a s T ⚄ ⚄

Pixies: Head Carrier

The first album by Pixies since they reunited, 2014’s Indie Cindy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/17/pixies-indie-cindy-review>, met 
with a slightly underwhelming critical response. Yet it seems to have 
reinvigorated the band – now with Paz Lenchantin taking over Kim Deal’s role as 
bassist and supplier of contrasting female vocals – who are rolling out a whole 
new album rather than packaging together three EPs, as they did for Indie Cindy.

 Spectacular … Jean Michel Jarre. Photograph: Andrew Benge/Redferns 
Jean-Michel Jarre

Until this summer, the electronic pioneer hadn’t played live in the UK for 
five years: following a handful of festival appearances, he takes to the arenas 
in support of his two-volume album of collaborations, Electronica. His 
performances might be scaled down a little from the days when every live event 
he played seemed to attract record-breaking crowds, but judging by the videos 
of his appearances at Sónar and Bluedot earlier this summer, his show is still 
a pretty spectacular son-et-lumière event.

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/02/flit-martin-green-migration-journey-song-film-edinburgh-international-festival-interview>

through songs and striking animation (created by Bafta-winning duo whiterobot). 
Green’s musical collaborators include Anais Mitchell and Aidan Moffat, and his 
band is fronted by Adam Holmes and Becky Unthank. It’s part folk-opera, part 
installation, part gig and part theatre piece.

Mykki Blanco

The last time the Guardian reviewed a Mykki Blanco show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/03/mykki-blanco-hip-hop-review>, it 
was certainly an experience. Blanco wore a padded bra, fed grapes to the crowd 
and partook in some stylish vogueing. The California-born rapper is one of 
several artists who have spent the past few years challenging hip-hop norms, 
bringing queer politics and drag culture to a genre not always welcoming of the 
LGBT community, while transforming venues into sweaty, heaving masses at the 
same time. This tour coincides with the release of debut album proper, Mykki.

debut album,Foxbase Alpha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/17/saint-etienne-foxbase-alpha>, in 
full for what is, apparently, the final time. Its melange of samples, melodies,

to British pop culture.

Kate Tempest: Let Them Eat Chaos

With a novel, several plays and the odd poetry prize all fighting for page

Mercury-nominatedEverybody Down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/15/kate-tempest-everybody-down-review>

and promises more dazzling wordplay, a dash of politics and the odd 10/10 song 
title – Ketamine for Breakfast is our current favourite.

Two giants of today’s jazz – both awesome instrumentalists, and artists who

and Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes. Lovano has enthrallingly built on a jazz-sax 
legacy running from Charlie Parker to Ornette Coleman and Wayne Shorter; Valdes 
stunningly fuses jazz and classical techniques, and put the Cuban jazz scene on 
the world map in the 1970s with his groundbreaking Irakere band. The pair join

Not many rap shows double up as personal-hygiene classes, but Lady Leshurr 
likes to do things differently – her punchline-loaded freestyles covering most 
aspects of grooming etiquette, from reminders to “change your panties” to 
lessons on fighting bad breath (“I can’t believe the cheek / Some girls wake up 
and don’t even brush their teeth!”). The exciting Birmingham MC will no doubt 
bring bags of energy and charisma to these dates – along with her freshmint

Tove Lo: Lady Wood

The title does not, as the innocently minded might assume, relate to a 
female-friendly forestry club. Instead, Swedish pop star Tove Lo has written 
her second album about empowerment, bravery and, most importantly, the “female 
hard-on” – subjects elevated by booming, synthetic sounds and delivered with 
the same candid storytelling that defined her platinum-selling debut,Queen of 
the Clouds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/tove-lo-queen-of-the-clouds-review>

Pink Floyd: The Early Years

There was a time when Pink Floyd <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd> 
appeared to be displaying their traditional English reserve when it came to the 
matter of trawling the vaults for unreleased material: their peers did it, they 
did not. They’re certainlymaking up for that now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/pink-floyd-release-27-disc-set-early-years-1965-1972>
: here are 27 CDs and Blu-ray discs, containing pretty much everything a Floyd 
obsessive might want to hear or see from the years before The Dark Side of the 
Moon. Most attention is bound to be attracted by the previously unreleased 
recordings from the Syd Barrett era, but the whole thing looks like a 
fascinating treasure trove for diehard fans.

Chance the Rapper

Thus far, 2016 has proved quite a year for Chancelor Bennett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/13/chance-the-rapper-chicago-music-coloring-book-hip-hop>
. He co-wrote four tracks on Kanye West’sThe Life of Pablo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-review-you-can-see-why-his-immodesty-rubs-people-up-the-wrong-way>
 – West held him to be responsible for the delays in the album’s release – 
while his third mixtapeColoring Book 
<https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper/sets/coloring-book>, a noticeably more 
coherent record than West’s, became the first album in US history to chart on 
streams alone; furthermore, its Top 10 success forced America’s Recording 
Academy to change the rules of the Grammy awards to make streaming-only 
releases eligible for nomination. He plays three UK shows.

Laura Jane Grace: Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock’s Most Infamous Anarchist 
Sellout

A brilliant deviation from the average rockstar narrative of tour excess and 
indulgence, Against Me! founder and frontwomanLaura Jane Grace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/against-me-laura-jane-grace-north-carolina-bathroom-bill>
’s memoir tells the story of the punk artist’s musical ventures and struggles 
with identity and addiction. Written with Noisey editor Dan Ozzi, Tranny: 
Confessions of Punk Rock’s Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout draws from the pages 
of journal entries Grace has kept since her childhood, beginning with her 
upbringing in Georgia, and documenting her experience of dysphoria, coming out 
as transgender in 2012, and other seismic life events, all of which have been 
channelled through her music. •24 November, Hachette Books.
