Guardian Music has been honoured at the Association of Online Publishers (AOP) 
awards, scooping a prize for the 'best use of video.' The awards took place on 
19 July 2012.

The judges said: "producing everything from live streaming to full scale 
editorial content, this team has mastered telling stories with video native to 
digital platforms. The quality of its output would be the envy of some 
broadcasters."

Our entry covered live-streaming from Glyndebourne, the Royal Albert Hall (PJ 
Harvey), Dingle (Other Voices), and Kings Place (Mozart's Requiem). It covered 
our long-runningHow I Wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/how-i-wrote> series, with seven of 
last year's 12 Mercury Music prize nominees performing in our studios.
