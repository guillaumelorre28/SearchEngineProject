But experts said the Strathmore house should be heritage-listed because of its 
social and historical significance, claiming it’s not a house, it’s a home.

Members of the Moonee Valley city council wanted to stop the demolition after 
external consultants investigated the weatherboard home’s significance.

“Its connections with the film The Castle are the foremost aspect of its 
significance, reflecting both social and historical value,” their report stated.

Moonee Valley City councillors rejected the heritage protection bid at a 
council meeting on Tuesday night, five votes to four.

The mayor, Andrea Suraco, said the council would write to the minister to 
withdraw their bid to place a heritage overlay over the property.

“An important debate went on, but we have to remember this is a private 
person’s property,” Suraco said late on Tuesday night.
“And the significant heritage or sentimental side is from the movie – and the 
house was supposed to be in Coolaroo – no one would have known it was in 
Strathmore.”

She said the decision didn’t mean the house would be demolished, after 
community interest to move the house from the property to another area.
