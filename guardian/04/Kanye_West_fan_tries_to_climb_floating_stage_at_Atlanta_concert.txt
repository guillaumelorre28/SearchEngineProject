 at the rapper’s Monday night concert in Atlanta, hanging on for just a few 
seconds before coming back down to Earth.

Videos posted to Twitter show concertgoers at the Saint Pablo Tour raising the 
unidentified fan – clad in jeans, sneakers and a cap – high enough to reach the 
stage by holding his feet and ankles.

The fan had his arms on the stage surface as West calmly walked towards him 
and waved his hand as if to say “cut it out”. From the crowd, a muscular man is 
seen grabbing the fan’s ankle and pulling him down.

West had been performing the song Power at the time – known for its memorable 
chorus of “No one man should have all that power” – and ever the performer, 
seamlessly continued after the fan let go.

 Saint Pablo tour has used a stage which hangs from the ceiling and has the 
rapper float over fans. While this was the first time a fan has attempted to 
climb aboard, West is no stranger to stage invasions. At hisperformance last 
year in Glastonbury

, comedianLee Nelson

 ran on stage anddisrupted the rapper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/28/kanye-west-glastonbury-gig-interrupted-lee-nelson-stage-invasion>
 as a prank dedicated to Taylor Swift.

Swift was interrupted by fans during a 2014 concert in London 
<http://www.eonline.com/au/news/506667/taylor-swift-fan-rushes-the-stage-at-london-concert-watch-now>
, then againthe next year in San Diego

. After a fan clung to Adam Levine at a 2015 concert, the Maroon Five singer 
and The Voice coach said it was“super terrifying”

 because he wasn’t expecting it.Britney Spears was visibly shaken 
<http://www.mtv.com/news/1610520/britney-spears-fan-arrested-for-jumping-onstage/>
 after a fan came on stage during a performance of Womanizer in Connecticut in 
2009. It’s happened toJustin Bieber 
<http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/06/world/irpt-storify-bieber-dubai-fan/>. Lady Gaga 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc9yNA6po0M> was singing the line “I don’t 
want to be friends” from her song Bad Romance when she was bum-rushed. .

West memorably interrupted Swift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas> on 
stage at the MTV VMAs in 2009, believing Beyoncé should have won the award for 
best female video instead. “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you and Imma let 
you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time,” West said at 
the time. He similarly interrupted Beck for winning over Beyoncéat the 2015 
Grammys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/11/kanye-west-upstaging-beck-a-joke-like-grammys-themselves>
. In 2006at the MTV Europe Music Awards 
<http://www.today.com/id/15536834#.V9gnQJPyu9Y>, West went on stage after he 
didn’t win best video.

Years later, West and Swift’s encounter is still well-known, ranked by the 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/19/10-best-stage-invasions-jarvis-cocker-david-niven-rolling-stones>
 as the fourth best stage invasion of all time. It follows the musician Jarvis 
Cocker coming onstage during a Michael Jackson performance at the 1996 Brit 
awards, a streaker at the 1974 Academy Awards, and a fan who got hit by Keith 
Richards’ guitar when he came onstage at a 1981 Rolling Stones concert.

Also on Monday, protesters attempted to interrupt swimmer Ryan Lochte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/ryan-lochte-dancing-with-the-stars-interrupted-protester>
, who wascharged with filing a false robbery report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/25/ryan-lochte-charged-rio-police-false-report>
 after an incident during the 2016 Rio Olympics, after his first performance on 
the ABC TV show Dancing with the Stars.

After the Kanye West concert, a fan told NBC News 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/man-attempts-board-kanye-west-s-floating-stage-atlanta-concert-n647226>
 that the stage climber didn’t seem to be hurt after getting pulled off stage. 
“Everyone just kind of turned and looked at each other like, ‘did that really 
just happen?’” said Chase Brown, a 19-year-old attendee. “But the show 
continued and not much was said about it. The overall show was great, Kanye put 
on a great show.”
