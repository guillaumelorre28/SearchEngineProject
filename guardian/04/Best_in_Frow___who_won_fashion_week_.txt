After four weeks of shows, some feverish Instagramming and a whole lot of 
waiting around for Kanye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/mar/11/kanye-wests-celebrity-front-row-neighbours-in-pictures>
, the results are in. There have been some bona fide fashion moments (thank you 
Derek Zoolander 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/10/zoolander-returns-ben-stiller-and-luke-wilson-bring-blue-steel-to-paris-fashion-week>
) and some scorchingly brilliant looks (exit 47 at Louis Vuitton, you rule) but 
who looked best off the runway? In a season where, in PR parlance, “sitting” is 
the new “walking”, who won the shows from the Frow? Drumroll please

GOLD: Alexa Chung at JW Anderson

 Gold winner: Alexa Chung nails cord-chic at JW Anderson Photograph:

Alexa Chung <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung> at the JW 
Anderson show. Was it the Silvine exercise book blue, was it the jumbo cord, or 
the fact that she looked like an ice skater from the former eastern bloc who 
has knocked up her own costume? Who knows, but she looked utterly brilliant. 
The extreme side parting went with the skinny zip-sleeve cuffs and the funnel 
neck. A masterclass in celebrating a designer but looking like yourself. 
Footnote: blue jumbo cord is coming to Topshop this autumn.

SILVER: Veronika Heilbrunner at the Louis Vuitton show
 Silver: Veronika Heilbrunner does Vuitton at Vuitton 
Going to a Vuitton show wearing the Vuitton aesthetic is risky, unless you are 
German stylist and street-style thoroughbred Heilbrunner. The raised waistband 
jeans, thepedestrian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/mar/10/how-to-do-pedestrian-style-vanessa-seward-apc>
 socks and shoes and the plum polo-neck play off beautifully against the giant 
collar leather jacket. On anyone else it could be David Soul in Starsky and 
Hutch. But not here. The outfit sounds so simple, but try it and you will soon 
realise that only a real sartorial expert can make this look so easy.

The Man Repeller had an excellent season consolidating her earlier 
street-style work. The DNA of the Medine look – poloneck, off-key pants, 
trainers, statement weird stuff came into its own this season and the blogger 
found herself right on the hotspot of what is cool right now. Her look 
translated brilliantly in every city but the frigid New York weather meant that 
her frow game was strongest on home turf.

HIGHLY COMMENDED: Kate Moss at Burberry

 Highly commended: Kate Moss at Burberry Prorsum. Who else? Photograph: David 
M. Benett 
Let’s face it – it wasn’t the black jeans, heels and sunglasses. This look was 
all about that unrivalled Moss attitude.
