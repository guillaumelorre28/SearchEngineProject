Thanks so much for your company tonight. There have been highs, lows and… no, 
just lots more lows. Join Julia back here next week for another hour ofThe 
Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>, the programme 
where entrepreneurship meets light entertainment, LOLs and a lackadaisical 
attitude to the English language.

Next week, Richard will be doing inappropriate things with onions, and 
Charleine will be getting to grips with chia seeds. I, for one, cannot wait.

Right, who’s Joseph going to bring back? Selina’s negative aura is coming up 
yet again. Fire the negative aura and be done with it.

Scott free

Shock, horror, OMG (/I read a spoiler this morning)… Scott has left the 
building. “He’s gone”, says Karren. “He’s been floundering for weeks,” says 
Claude. Scott’s not so sure: “Lord Sugar will kick himself.”

And the winner is…

Like Selina, numbers have never been my strong suit so I won’t try and jot the 
figures down, but the winner is… Team Vana, Rich et al. This lot are off on a

“We literally have a minute left,” says a clipboard-wielding Charleine, before 
continuing to run after unsuspecting pedestrians and try to flog them a 
£350,000 flat. I would not buy a doll’s house from these people.

Thanks so much for your company tonight. There have been highs, lows and… no, 
just lots more lows. Join Julia back here next week for another hour ofThe 
Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>, the programme 
where entrepreneurship meets light entertainment, LOLs and a lackadaisical 
attitude to the English language.
 
Next week, Richard will be doing inappropriate things with onions, and 
Charleine will be getting to grips with chia seeds. I, for one, cannot wait.
 
Joseph and Gary are safe for now. Off they trot, via the inevitable awkward 
hug…
 
Will it be Selina? I hope so. It is!
 
Why shouldn’t Lord Sugar fire Selina? She’s proved she’s capable of “working 
with wealthy people”, she says. Compelling stuff.
 
Joseph, the “godfather of business”, is getting a classic Lord Sugar 
brulee-ing. Why should he stay in the process? “I’m 26 years old,” he says.
 
Selina and Gary are coming back in with Joseph. I reckon Joseph’s braces are 
going to get another grilling.
 
Right, who’s Joseph going to bring back? Selina’s negative aura is coming up 
yet again. Fire the negative aura and be done with it.
 
Shock, horror, OMG (/I read a spoiler this morning)… Scott has left the 
building. “He’s gone”, says Karren. “He’s been floundering for weeks,” says 
Claude. Scott’s not so sure: “Lord Sugar will kick himself.”
 
Like Selina, numbers have never been my strong suit so I won’t try and jot the 
figures down, but the winner is… Team Vana, Rich et al. This lot are off on a 
speed boat. Or are they? Scott seems to have something to say.
 
How does Joseph keep his moustache like that? It really is a marvel. Alan Sugar
 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/alan-sugar> says he looks like Super Mario. 
Man’s got a point.
 
Karren is giving Scott a talking to for calling the wardrobe a washing machine 
and the bidet a hot tub to potential buyers. He doesn’t know this industry, he 
says.
 
‘Ere he is. This is “serious stuff”, he says, million pound flats rather than 
the classic discount fodder. We know, Lord Sugar, and we can’t quite believe 
this lot sold energy drinks, let alone flats with rooftop gardens and “dens”. 
But sell they did!

Richard has finally got the name right and is talking about “engaging” with 
the client, a lot.
 
“We literally have a minute left,” says a clipboard-wielding Charleine, before 
continuing to run after unsuspecting pedestrians and try to flog them a 
£350,000 flat. I would not buy a doll’s house from these people.
 
Couldn’t have put it better myself, our Lord Sugar…
 
Clapham, I s’pose.
 
It’s 5.30pm, 90 minutes trading left and they’re OUT ON THE STREET and trying 
to sell flats. “My husband’s going to kill me”, says one woman buying a cheeky 
flat on a Tuesday afternoon. Where do they find these people?
