Former Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> defender 
Ron Vlaar has signed a contract running to the end of the season with his first 
club AZ Alkmaar.

The 30-year-old had been training with AZ after rejecting a new deal with 
Villa in the summer and he has now committed his immediate future to the 
Eredivisie club, subject to passing a medical.

AZ sporting director Max Huiberts told az.nl: “We are very pleased with our 
capture of Ron Vlaar.

“He gives our squad a huge boost of quality. I don’t need to explain what his 
strengths are... everybody has seen them over the last few seasons.

“Last year he was a driving force behind the success of Holland at the World 
Cup. His presence can boost both the performance of the team and the 
development of other players.”

Centre-back Vlaar joined Feyenoord from AZ in 2006 and moved on to Villa six 
years, and over 100 appearances, later.

Despite the fact he replaced Stiliyan Petrov as captain, injuries put paid to 
much of his time at Villa Park but he did manage 34 outings in all competitions 
during the 2013-14 campaign.

AZ, who are coached by John van den Brom, are currently 10th in the Eredivisie 
table.
