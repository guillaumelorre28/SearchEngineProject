<http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/awards-news/hayward-is-sports-writer-of-the-year-for-third-time/>
 as well as being highly commended in two categories by the Sports Journalists’ 
Association, the world’s largest national organisation for professional sports 
journalists.

Daniel Taylor, the Guardian and The Observer’s chief football writer, was 
named Football Journalist of the Year. One judge commented that “Taylor’s work 
is exceptional. It’s deep, it’s well informed, and it’s easy to read.”


The Guardian also took away the award for Laureus Sports Website of the year 
for the second year running.


Two Guardian journalists were also highly commended for their work - Owen 
Gibson was named in the investigative sports reporter category and rugby union 
journalist Rob Kitson was commended for his writing.
