Much like Jesus with the water and the wine, Alexa Chung 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung> wearing a beige apron with a 
navy shirt – a little bit Marni, a little bit Jil Sander – on The Great Comic 
Relief Bake Off last night sounds blah, but will no doubt see the pinny evolve 
into a festival staple this summer. So do hold your breath and work out how to 
wear yours.

Whistles has a black apron dress in store now, though its link to an actual 
apron is a little tenuous.Theory’s navy suede 
<http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/536184/Theory/lilita-backless-suede-dress> 
version is a little more on the money, what with its cross straps and pinched 
waist, although it’s a little impractical if you planned on working with flour 
while wearing it. On Fendi’s AW15 catwalk, it was less baker and more butcher 
as models paraded in leather A-line apron mini skirts with leather apron tops, 
all toy buttons and bizarre furry boots: a decidedly weightier and wipe-down 
version. Kenzo and Made in Humanity offered versions in denim, the former with 
buttons, which wouldn’t look out of place on the Alexa for AG line.

In menswear, meanwhile, Shaun Samson made no bones about his inspiration, with 
waist wraparound aprons, the sort of thing a waiter wears, along with the 
full-size version in black emblazoned in white withnon sequiturs including 
“Delusional Radical Bliss”. Which sort of sums up the whole vibe really.
