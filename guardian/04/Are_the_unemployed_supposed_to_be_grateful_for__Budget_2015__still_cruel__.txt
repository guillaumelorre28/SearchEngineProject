It’s sad to see the 2015 budget being measured against the 2014 budget instead 
of being measured by its impact on inequality and poverty.

Take, for example, the 2014 measure to force unemployed young people to 
survive on fresh air and sunshine for six months of every year. Such was the 
community outcry in the face of such viciousness that the 2015 budget has 
proposed Punishment Mark II, namelyone month without income instead of six. 

The change is a clear admission of the cruelty of this measure without 
actually abandoning it. This is like thanking someone for “only” cutting your 
fingers off after threatening to cut off your arm. And we are supposed to be 
grateful!

This year’s budget might be dull but it doesn’t dull the pain for people who 
struggle to make ends meet when a government presides over a growth in 
unemployment and inequality. It doesn’t dull the pain because it refuses to 
make the big end of town pay its share through progressive tax reform.

This budget can find the money to fund childcare and nannies for the rich but 
only at the expense of the poor. It refuses to lift the abysmally low 
unemployment benefit, resorting to income management instead of income 
adequacy. It refuses to reinstate and increase funding for social services, 
social housing, public health and public education slashed in last year’s 
budget.

If you wanted to prevent unemployment 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/unemployment?src=hash> you wouldn’t rip the guts 
out ofthe Gonski <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gonski?src=hash> education 
funding reforms or allowTafe <https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAFE?src=hash> to be 
undermined or universities deregulated.

Neither would you dismember the public sector.

Budget 2015 persists in blaming people for their own exclusion, forcing them 
to live in poverty, even though we know that you don’t build people up by 
putting them down.

The problem of unemployment <https://twitter.com/hashtag/unemployment?src=hash>
 lies not with the individual but with the labour market. Governments must do 
what markets cannot. If the government wanted to addressunemployment 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/unemployment?src=hash> it would create a jobs plan 
including economic development in areas of high unemployment. No amount of 
moralising about sole parents or young people needing to “have a go” will 
address the fact that, even on conservative estimates, there are 13 jobseekers 
for every job vacancy when you take into consideration the underemployed as 
well as the unemployed. Unemployment and underemployment are structural 
problems; not problems of individual behaviour.

What the 2015 budget <https://twitter.com/hashtag/budget2015?src=hash> should 
have been about is ensuring that no one misses out on the essentials of life: a 
place to live, a place to work (or income security), a place to learn and a 
place to heal.

Ideology dressed up as rationality doesn’t dull the pain, let alone address 
the causes of the pain for the forgotten people: the low paid, the unpaid, the 
underemployed and the unemployed.

But it does dull this nation’s vision of itself, for this budget, by ramping 
up inequality, will force people to rely on charity when all they want is a 
fair crack at happiness.
