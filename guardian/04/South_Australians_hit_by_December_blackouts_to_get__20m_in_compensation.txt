 will receive about $20m in compensation from the state’s electricity operator.

SA Power Networks says the total payments will be about three times more than 
the company has ever paid for a major storm event, after the previous high of 
$7m in February 2014.

About 155,000 customers will receive payments for the inconvenience caused by 
the extended power outages, which started when fierce weather tore down 
powerlines across SA in late December.

The payouts start at $100 for customers blacked out for more than 12 hours and 
climb to $605 for those who were without power for more than 48 hours.

A SA Power Networks spokesman, Paul Roberts, said the estimated $20m in 
guaranteed service level payments will go to about half of all customers who 
lost power.

“This clearly demonstrates the significant nature of the storm, the widespread 
damage and the number of customers affected,” he said on Wednesday. “Our 
preliminary figures also show that this single storm event is the worst we have 
had in terms of minutes of supply lost.”

The Adelaide Hills was the worst-hit area as repair crews were slowed by 
difficult terrain and access problems, while the mid-north was also badly hit.

In the storm’s initial aftermath, the premier, Jay Weatherill, said the damage 
wrought by strong winds could not have been prevented.

But the opposition leader, Steven Marshall, said it was the fourth major 
blackout in SA for the year and that the state government should have been more 
prepared.

The blackouts capped off a turbulent year for SA’s power system, with storms

 that sparked debate nationwide.
