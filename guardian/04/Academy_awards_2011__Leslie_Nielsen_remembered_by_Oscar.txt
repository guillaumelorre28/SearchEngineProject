The late Leslie Nielsen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/leslie-nielsen> was 
ushered off on a ripple of laughter at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles, as 
the event paid tribute to the famously deadpan actor.

Nielsen's career boasted some 60 screen credits, including roles in The 
Plainsman and The Poseidon Adventure, though he was most fondly remembered for 
his late-blooming comedic antics in the likes ofAirplane! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/airplane> and the Naked Gun series.

Nielsen died last November, aged 84, in a Florida hospital. As the man himself 
might have said, "it's a big building with patients. But that's not important 
right now."
