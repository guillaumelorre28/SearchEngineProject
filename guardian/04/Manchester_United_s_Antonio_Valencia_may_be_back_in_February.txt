Sir Alex Ferguson has said that Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> could be playing again 
by the end of February.

The Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
winger was carried off during United's Champions League 0-0 draw with Rangers 
on Tuesday, after suffering a horrific injury in an apparently innocuous 
incident involving the defender Kirk Broadfoot.

Ferguson had said that Valencia would miss the remainder of the season. 
However, it appears the damage is not quite as bad as the United manager feared.

"You can never be 100% accurate in these situations and it is a bad injury but 
we are looking at the end of February, which is better than we thought on 
Tuesday," the United manager said.

Valencia had an operation on Wednesday evening to put his left ankle back into 
place after it was fractured and dislocated. Ferguson said the Ecuador star had 
also suffered some ligament damage.

"The operation has been successful and the break was clean, which was the 
major concern for us at the time," he said. "He is a strong boy, who is very 
positive about it. Being positive helps you in these situations, so we are very 
hopeful we will get him back then."
