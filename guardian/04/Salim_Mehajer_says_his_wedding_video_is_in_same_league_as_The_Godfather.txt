The Auburn City Council Public Inquiry is investigating allegations some 
councillors, including Mehajer, made planning and development decisions that 
benefited themselves and family members before they were sacked in February.

Mehajer was on Friday asked about his August 2015 wedding which involved four 
helicopters anda cavalcade of sports cars

.

The inquiry heard he made an application to have part of his Lidcombe Street 
closed for the purposes of making a “feature film” after doubts arose about 
whether roads could be blocked for a wedding.

Mehajer, who is also a property developer

, maintained the re-categorisation was justified and offered to show the 
45-second trailer to the inquiry.

“A feature film is The Godfather isn’t it, Apocalypse Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/apocalypse-now>?,” counsel assisting the 
commissioner Paul Bolster said.

“I got my very own feature film, I guess,” Mehajer said with a smile.

The inquiry has previously heard former deputy general manager of the council, 
Hamish McNulty thought only one helicopter was going to be involved in the 
wedding until the night before the extravagant celebration.

But Mehajer said he always intended to have more than one and would have 
included more if logistics allowed.

“Four [helicopters] was limited to the space we had,” he said.

Mehajer, who denied knowing there had been an issue with the number of 
helicopters used in his wedding, did not answer journalists’ questions as he
left the inquiry and got into a Porsche

On the stand, he denied lobbying a councillor to change his mind about 
returning half of a $650,000 deposit his company had put on a council-owned car 
park.

He also denied a decision before he was a councillor not to extend a time 
limit he needed to secure the contract made him decide to run in the election.

Both the deposit refund and extension of time were granted while Mehajer was 
in council.

McNulty has said the council originally understood Mehajer wanted to have a 
helicopter land on a street but was given advice that would not be approved.

The inquiry is expected to continue next month.
