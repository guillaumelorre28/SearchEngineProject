 Oedipus and the Sphinx by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (about 1826) 
Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
This dreamlike picture of the tragic hero Oedipus explaining the riddle of the 
Sphinx was painted years before Freud appropriated this myth as a complex. 
“What has four feet in the morning, two feet in the afternoon and three feat in 
the evening?” asks the Sphinx. Answer it as well as Oedipus and you get a 
bottle of Cinzano Bianco.
