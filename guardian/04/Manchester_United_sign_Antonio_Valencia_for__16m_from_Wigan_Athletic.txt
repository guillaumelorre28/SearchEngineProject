Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
have made Luis Antonio Valencia their first signing of the summer, the Wigan 
Athletic player joining the Premier League champions for a fee believed to be 
£16m. The 23-year-old has agreed a four-year deal at Old Trafford.

Valencia travelled to Manchester yesterday to undergo his medical after United 
settled on a fee with Wigan and the player's arrival is the first piece of 
rebuilding at Old Trafford since the club accepted Real Madrid's £80m offer for 
Ronaldo and established that Carlos Tevez would leave when his two-year loan 
arrangement expires.

"Antonio is a player we have admired for some time now, having spent the last 
two years in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> with Wigan," Sir Alex 
Ferguson said. "I am sure his pace and ability will make a significant 
contribution to the team."

Valencia, who arrived in England on loan from Villarreal in 2006, said: 
"Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me. I have enjoyed my time 
at Wigan but I am thrilled to have the chance to challenge for the biggest 
honours in club football here. Playing in front of 76,000 fans alongside 
players like Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs will be an amazing 
experience. I can't wait to get started."
