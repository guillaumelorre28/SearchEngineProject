“It is brilliant,” wrote UnashamedPedant, “and not just on a first reading: it 
stands up to a second and third reading, and to discussion.” Good news for us.

Andrea Levy is a serious talent: her 2004 novel Small Island won the Whitbread 
Book of the Year, the Orange prize and the Commonwealth Writers’ prize. 
Published in 2010, The Long Song more than lived up to its illustrious 
predecessor. Writing in the Observer, Kate Kellaway said Levy “moved into top 
gear”, writing a “seriously revealing” novel.In the Guardian, Alex Clark said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/andrea-levy-long-song-slavery>: 
“As a story of suffering, indomitability and perseverance, [Long Song] is 
thoroughly captivating.”

The book was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize and won the Walter Scott 
prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/20/andrea-levy-wins-walter-scott-%20prize>
 for historical fiction. Walter Scott judges said it was “quite simply a 
celebration of the triumphant human spirit in times of great adversity”. It 
sounds like something we could do with right now. I’m looking forward to 
reading The Long Song, and I hope you’ll join me.
