Guardian Travel is producing a city guide to South Africa’s historic seaside 
metropolis Port Elizabeth – and we need your help to do it.

We’d like you to tell us about the best museums and galleries, bars and cafes, 
the most interesting things to do and the insider tips you’ve picked up by 
travelling or even living and working in the city. Whatever it may be, we want 
to know all the details.

You can share your tips and photographs with us using GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/56c469eae4b0fc61b98c2f3e>. We’ll 
also be looking forTwitter <http://www.twitter.com/guardiantravel> replies and 
the most interestingInstagram <https://instagram.com/guardiantravelsnaps/?hl=en>
 pictures you’ve taken or found – with the hashtag#GuardianPE.

The best will be published next week as part of a city guide.
