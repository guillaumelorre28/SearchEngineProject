Behold, a snapshop from last weekend's Harvest 
<http://alexjamespresentsharvest.com/> festival organised by Alex James.

Much as I respect the Daily Mail commenter who captioned it "the prime 
minister, and the ideal prime minister", let's just slap a more concise tag on 
it:Worstival.

Our dramatis personae are Top Gear boor Jeremy Clarkson, cheese bore Alex James
 <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alex-james>, and Baby Björn-swaddled 
British prime minister David Cameron, looking for all the world like they have 
no idea what a trio of absolute countryfolk they are.

It was James, of course, who once claimed he was thrilled to have spent more 
than a million quid on champagne in three years, on the basis that "the road of 
excess leads to the palace of wisdom". And yet, on this evidence, does it? Does 
it not actually lead somewhere very wrong indeed?

Perhaps the former Blur bassist is looking on, wondering: "What evil hath I 
wrought?" Perhaps he is thinking: "I can't wait to pogo with these two to Town 
Called Malice in the Chipping Norton Tent later." Perhaps he is thinking: "How 
can I use this to sell cheese?"

All we can say for sure is that something very fundamental about festivals was 
shattered in that Oxfordshire field last weekend, and it may prove very 
difficult ever to rebuild it.
