What can't you do on your phone yet? Remix music? 

WRONG!

Hot off the development bench this week comes Fireplayer 
<http://www.fireplayer.com/site/Index> - another app trying to offer something 
new with the music that people will actually pay for. Though this app is free, 
the idea is that beyond the two free tracks you get with the app (one of which 
isSouth Central <http://www.myspace.com/southcentralmusic>'s Demons - kudos to 
them for picking an app to launch their new single) you'll want to fork out 
£1.79 for every new song you want to fiddle with. That seems a little steep to 
me (not that £1.79 is a lot) but there's something about breaching the £1 
barrier for in-app content. Labels seem to like it; Universal and Ministry of 
Sound are already signed up.

Fireplayer was made by the people at Bounce Mobile 
<http://www.bouncemobile.net/>, who are careful to pitch this as a potential 
source of complimentary digital revenue for music labels and artists.

Once you've picked the track and remixed/fiddled with it, you can share your 
remixed tracks on Facebook, this ticking the viral box.

The first time I fired it up the screen was ominously blank for a good five 
seconds, and more when I fired up the first track. We'll put that down to 
teething. Once I reached the mixing desk things got a bit better - it's not 
their fault that I'm just not enough of a music geek to appreciate what 'chop', 
'low pass' and 'keys' do. Music fiddlers will love it.

Do say: Could you drop the vocals for the middle eight and pump up the bass?

Don't say: Do you have any Joan Baez?
