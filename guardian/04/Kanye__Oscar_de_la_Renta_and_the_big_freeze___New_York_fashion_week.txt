The launch of Kanye West’s Adidas Yeezy 750 Boost

Considering that a blurry picture of Kanye’s first Adidas designs practically 
broke the internet on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/09/kanye-wests-designs-for-adidas-revealed-rappers-trainers>
, today’s official launch is probably going to be pretty hyped. In West’s 
typically understated way, they will be unveiled with a performance by artist 
Vanessa Beecroft and streamed in 50 cinemas around the world. The shoes will be 
released this Saturday. Watch out, internet.

Peter Copping’s first Oscar de la Renta collection


De la Renta’s death in October last year was a sad day for New York fashion – 
the designer wasmuch loved for his uptown chic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/oct/21/oscar-de-la-renta-sarah-jessica-parker-amal-alamuddin-jackie-kennedy-michelle-obama-oscars>
. Peter Copping, the ex-Pucci creative director, has taken over the mantle and 
is set to debut his first collection this season. Judging by a video posted on 
Instagram,of Copping sketching a dress <http://instagram.com/p/y7kEyqDuVh>, the 
spirit of de la Renta’s signature elegance is very much alive.

The British are coming


Tuesday night saw a dinner hosted by Boris Johnson and the British Fashion 
Council 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/11/alexa-chung-boris-johnson-new-york-fashion-stylewatch>
 to celebrate the special relationship between New York and London fashion. 
This is particularly pertinent at the moment, with two of New York Fashion 
Week’s buzziest shows – Coach andMarc by Marc Jacobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/12/marc-by-marc-jacobs-new-york-fashion-week>
 – boasting British talent at the design helm. Oh, and then there’s Anna 
Wintour. The Vogue chief is arguably the UK’s most successful fashion export. 
Finally, Victoria Beckham will be showing on Sunday night, so watch out for 
some Beckham family action on the front row that day.

The weather

Brrrrrr… New York Fashion Week is often the victim of extreme weather 
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/62716-6-times-fashion-week-was-ruined-by-the-weather-because-nyc-snowstorms-can-be-real-jerks>
. It’s predicted that this weekend will bring a storm over the city, with snow 
and a fierce wind. Of course, that doesn’t stop fashion – although it may mean 
editors need to adapt their looks accordingly. We predict coats will be the big 
street style story this season, but don’t discount heels. Last February, the 
city was covered with five inches of snow, but stiletto wearers soldiered on. 
The rule to remember? What’s mad IRL is standard at fashion week.

The first model with Down’s syndrome on the catwalk

Jamie Brewer, the actor known for her part in American Horror Story, will walk 
in the Carrie Hammer show today 
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/63300-jamie-brewer-to-model-for-carrie-hammer-at-nyfw-talks-why-its-taken-so-long-for>
 as part of the designer’s #RoleModelsNotRunwayModels initiative. Brewer will 
walk alongside a cast of non-models including journalists and business leaders. 
The hardest challenge, according to Brewer? One most models will recognise – 
learning to walk in high heels.
