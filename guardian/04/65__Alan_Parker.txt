Job: founder and chairman, Brunswick Group
Age: 55
Industry: public relations
Staff: 550
Worth: £95m
2010 ranking: 66

Alan Parker <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-parker> retains his ranking 
as the don of City PR people, having successfully negotiated the change of 
government and added to the list of FTSE 100 companies his Brunswick group 
represents.

Parker has balanced his close links with Labour – Sarah Brown ran her 
charitable work from Brunswick's offices – by cultivating David Cameron. The 
prime minister attended Parker's wedding in 2007.

However, Tory sensitivities did not stop him contributing £30,000 to the Yes 
to AV voting reform campaign earlier this year, despite the fact that its chief 
spinner was longstanding rival Roland Rudd at Finsbury.

Brunswick currently looks after Rolls-Royce, Unilever, Barclays and Burberry. 
It also handles PR for BP, although the agency took a bashing as it worked to 
clean up the oil giant's image after the Gulf of Mexico spillage. Highlights of 
the past 12 months include representing Len Blavatnik during his takeover bid 
for Warner Music, and acting for Skype during its whopping $8.5bn purchase by 
Microsoft.

Parker continues to chase international expansion. Brunswick held its annual 
meeting in China this year, and now has 18 offices in 11 countries – the latest 
to open was in Dallas.
