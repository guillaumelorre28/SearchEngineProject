Valerie Linow, 73, belongs to the Bundjalung nation and was separated from her 
parents when she was two years old.

When she was nine, she was taken to south-west New South Wales, to the 
Cootamundra domestic training home for Aboriginal girls. She left six years 
later and was forced to work in the town of Wombat for a former police officer, 
who raped her when she was 15.

She ran away to Redfern and attempted suicide three years later. To this day 
she experiences flashbacks, for which she takes medication.

Servant or Slave is an emotionally charged one-hour documentary that explores 
the formative years of Linow and four other Indigenous women who share stories 
of upbringings ravaged by racism.


The title appears at the start along with two definitions of the eponymous 
words:

Servant (Noun): A person employed by another, especially to perform domestic 
duties.


Slave (Noun): A person who is forced to work for another against their will.

A national past pockmarked by slavery is something Australians generally 
associate with other countries, such as the US. And while the director, Steven 
McGregor – who wrote the excellentRedfern Now: Promise Me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/redfern-now-promise-me-review-final-unsettling-showing-from-a-superb-cast>
 – doesn’t explicitly level that accusation, it’s clear from the start what 
he’s suggesting.


“We wanted to be straight upfront and give the audience some context,” he 
tells Guardian Australia. “The film won’t be everybody’s cup of tea and there 
will probably be a few knockers. But we took those words straight out of the 
dictionary.”

Produced by No Coincidence Media for NITV and screening on Wednesday, Servant 
or Slave revolves around the testimonies of its five subjects: Rita Wright, 
Violet West and the three Wenberg sisters, Adelaide, Valerie and Rita.

Their voices come and go in the opening scene. An exquisite rendition of Down 
in the River to Pray is matched with beautiful, autumnal looking images of 
young Aboriginal women outdoors. The colour grading was inspired by the town of 
Cootamundra: the blues of its sky, the yellows of its wattle trees.

These melancholic visions are antithetical to the documentary’s message and 
the town’s ignominious place in 20th-century history. The Cootamundra home 
opened in 1911 and closed in 1968. During that time, hundreds of Indigenous 
girls were forcibly removed from their parents and placed there. They were 
raised by white people for the purpose of assimilation and trained to serve 
non-Indigenous households.

The stories told are heartbreaking, encompassing rape, domestic violence, 
abuse of various kinds and the overarching shadow of institutionalised racism. 
These activities were partly funded, McGregor believes, by wages stolen from 
people including his documentary subjects. This is the first time his subjects 
have gone on the record.


“They’d been approached on various occasions over the years but they weren’t 
quite ready,” he says. “For some reason they felt this was the time to tell 
their story.

“Some people say that was then and this is now, so get over it. But these 
things are living with these women everyday. It affects them today. It affects 
their children and it affects their grandchildren.”

McGregor set about making these women, who had no prior experience of being 
interviewed, feel comfortable. He stripped back the artificial nature of film 
set environments, making the atmosphere as private and personal as possible.

There were no papers on his knee; the director believes that referring to 
notes is a bit too businesslike. The sound recordist was located off to the 
side, unseen. The director of photography (crack shutterbug Simon Chapman, who

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/joe-cinques-consolation-review-a-cynical-exercise-but-not-without-consolations>
) was positioned behind a black screen, where he could observe a monitor but be 
out of sight.

“I set the tone and mood in the room as, simply, we’re having a yarn,” 
McGregor says. “We’re just having a talk.

“But sometimes it was hard. When Valerie talked about how she was raped, that 
was a very difficult story for her to tell. There was about four of us in the 
room at the time. Our DOP and sound person were non-Indigenous and weren’t 
aware of any of these stories. At the end of that day everyone was pretty 
shattered.”

During filming there were times, Linow says, when she “kept breaking, kept 
breaking down”. Like all the subjects, she approves of the finished film (“If 
they didn’t like it they’d let you know,” says McGregor), but Linow couldn’t 
bear to watch herself on screen: “I just looked away and started crying.”


Linow became the first member of the stolen generations to receive 
compensation for crimes committed against her while she was a ward of the 
state. She was compelled to speak, she says, because: “I want my story out. 
It’s been locked inside me so long. I want everybody to know what happened to 
the Aboriginal kids in that era, because it was a cruel era.

“As I keep saying, the stolen generation were the first street kids. They just 
pushed us out and we had nowhere to go. We were street kids.”

Many Australians have some knowledge, or assumption, of the kinds of things 
that might have transpired during these dark times. But to hear them 
articulated by the victims themselves, and illustrated by powerful albeit 
discreet re-enactments, brings the details to mind in terrible ways. As 
McGregor says: “You’d have to have a hard heart not to be affected by it.”


The film-maker was knowledgeable before he took on the directing job but there 
were things that took him by surprise.


One of them was how the women, being raised by white people, came to regard 
their own kind. They didn’t know what to make of fellowIndigenous Australians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians> when, as 
adolescents and adults, they saw them on the street for the first time.

“We were frightened,” Linow says. “We had never been taught about our people. 
When we saw an Aboriginal person, you didn’t know who they were.

“A lot of Aboriginal people in the stolen generation do think, do feel they 
are white. With me, I always say to myself, you might have tried to bring me up 
like a white woman, but you forgot one thing: the colour of my skin. And that’s 
black.”

Towards the end of the interview, Linow broaches an easier conversation – one 
that generates nothing but positive thoughts. She talks about her beloved dog, 
a kelpie-cross. She says she loves animals, prefers them to humans. And after a 
moment’s thought, adds: “It’s not a terrible world we live in. It’s a beautiful 
world. But people have the power to make it terrible.”
