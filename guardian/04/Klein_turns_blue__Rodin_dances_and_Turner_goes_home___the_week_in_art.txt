 Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando, by Edgar Degas (1879). Photograph: Alamy 
An acrobat hangs from a trapeze by her teeth in this startling image of her 
flying in open space beneath the russet-red dome of a Paris circus. Degas 
dwells on her athletic body suspended in the void, in a painting that is a 
homage to strength and beauty.
• National Gallery 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hilaire-germain-edgar-degas-miss-la-la-at-the-cirque-fernando>
, London WC2N.

 Man With Bird (2007). Photograph: Bharat Sikka 
Featured as this week’s My best shot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/13/bharat-sikka-photography>
, Bharat Sikka’s image is of a Goan villager and his pet eagle. “He seemed to 
have total control over her. After I’d taken a few pictures, he said: ‘I’ll 
make her do anything you want’... I managed to capture man and bird perfectly 
in three-quarter profile – although sometimes her beak was so close to his eye 
that, truly, I was scared.”
