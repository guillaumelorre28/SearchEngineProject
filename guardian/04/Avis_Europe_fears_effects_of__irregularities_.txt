Car rental group Avis Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aviseurope> 
has suspended a number of senior managers at its Portugal division after 
uncovering evidence of possible "malpractice".

 The company warned investors this morning that this year's profits would be 
€3m (£2.03m) lower than previously forecast if the potential irregularities are 
confirmed.

 It also cautioned that it may have overstated its net assets at the end of 
2006 by €3m.

 Avis said the managers have been suspended "as a protective measure", but 
declined to name them or say how many there were. KPMG has been called in to 
conduct an internal inquiry, but it is understood that the police are not 
currently involved.

 On a more positive note, Avis predicted that "the results for the operation 
in Portugal in future periods will be substantially improved" if the 
investigation proves that malpractice has occurred.

 The Portuguese subsidiary had revenues of €42m last year.
