Team GB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-gb> laid down a marker ahead 
of Saturday's men's four final with an impressive victory over arch gold medal 
rivals Australia in Thursday's semi-final.

Andrew Triggs Hodge, Pete Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory hit back from a 
length down to row through the Australians with a massive push in the last 500 
metres and complete a confidence-boosting victory.

Britain are looking to extend their golden dynasty in the men's four to 16 
years following Olympic triumphs in Sydney, Athens and Beijing.

Australia claimed after winning the Munich World Cup regatta in June that 
their tactic of leading from the front had "scared the hell" out of Britain but 
Thursday's performance from the British crew will have gone a long way to 
debunk that claim and it has set up another sensational showdown for gold on 
Saturday.

Meanwhile, the reigning men's lightweight double sculls champions, Mark Hunter 
and Zac Purchase, won their semi-final, beating their rivals France by half a 
length.
