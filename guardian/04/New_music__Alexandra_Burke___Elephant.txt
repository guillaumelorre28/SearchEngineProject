Just before Christmas, X Factor 2008 winner Alexandra Burke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alexandra-burke> co-hosted a show on Argos 
TV in which she attempted to sell her own range of watches. This followed her 
borderline disastrous appearance as a guest judge on The X Factor, during which 
she tried to make "OK.com" a "thing". All this occurred at the start of a 
second album campaign that has already been mired by false starts (this single 
was meant to be out in September), label woes (she left Syco and is now signed 
to RCA) and a general feeling that someone who's had three No 1 singles and a 
No 1 album probably doesn't need to be hawking her wares on Argos TV. Still, 
all this would be irrelevant if her new single was a Bad Boys-style banger. 
Instead Burke has teamed up with veteran DJ and producer Erick Morillo, and 
discovered Auto-Tune. Frankly, it's a bit of a mess. While the verses rattle 
along over stop-start synths, the heavily distorted pre-chorus crashes like an 
anvil, not only breaking up momentum but also bringing to mind a group of 
"revellers" stopping to burst into laughter. Did she learn nothing from Leona's 
foray into dance music?

â€¢ Elephant is due on 11 March via RCA.
