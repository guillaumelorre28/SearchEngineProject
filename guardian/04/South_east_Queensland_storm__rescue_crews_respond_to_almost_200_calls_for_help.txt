reported damage in several suburbs. A further 41 jobs were logged inBrisbane

region.

The weather bureau says 55mm of rain fell in Ipswich within half an hour.

A supermarket in Bellowrie was closed due to a partially collapsed roof while 
Wynnum Esplanade was also shut after a damaged shop front fell on to an 
unoccupied car.

Fallen trees have also been reported on many roads, including Gympie Road at 
Chermside, while powerlines were also down in Bardon.

The SES assistant commissioner Peter Jeffrey said Ipswich was worst affected 
by the storm with “near cyclonic winds peeling back roofs like can openers”. 
“It’s been a significant storm that left a large amount of damage in its wake 
but it was not above our capacity to respond,” he said.
