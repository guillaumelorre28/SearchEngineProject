Watching the campaign of the Brexiteers descend into racist rants, and seeing 
how this intimidates the fearful and prejudiced into supporting them, only 
confirms what I (and a lot of others) sensed from the first: that those who 
want to leave Europe are motivated most powerfully by the basest motives. 
Imperfect as it may be, the EU is an extraordinarily noble idea, which has 
brought vastly improved chances of health, justice, enlightenment, 
environmental protection, cultural richness (yes, and material wealth) in 
countless ways to countless people across the UK. Spurning these things, and 
embracing instead dozens of different kinds of insularity, would be an equally 
extraordinary act of self-damage and self-restriction.
