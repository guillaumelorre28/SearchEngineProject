What can you tell us about Burning Man?

Burning Man is an eight-day annual gathering of 75,000 people in the Black 
Rock desert in Nevada. What’s really unique about it is that it’s not like any 
other festival. We don’t sell anything other than coffee or ice, so you bring 
everything you need. We also have no trash cans, so while you think it would be 
messier, we have taught everyone to take away what they bring with them. We 
call that radical self-reliance, which is key to Burning Man.

We also have a key principle of communal effort, so we’re asking everyone to 
look out for each other. Part of that would be picking up your own mess, but if 
you don’t, it’s not uncommon to see someone leaning over to pick up a cigarette 
butt that someone else dropped. Everyone is dedicated to the “Leave No Trace 
<http://burningman.org/event/preparation/leaving-no-trace/>” principle.

That’s one of the things people say they take home with them from Burning Man 
– it changes the way you look at litter, yourself and what you’re bringing into 
the world.

Burning Man is also radically creative. It doesn’t have any stages. It’s an 
experiment in temporary community. We’re asking the participants to bring 
themselves to it.

How do you balance giving responsibility to participants and being responsible 
stewards?

That’s part of the conversation we have about civic participation – that we’re 
setting up the infrastructure for a city. But when people ask me: well how are 
you [the organisation] going to make sure newbies take on the Burning Man ethos,
I say: we’re going to put the tools out there, but if you’re a camper, you’re 
responsible for helping to acculturate the others become citizens. We all 
become citizens together. So it is a balance.

It’s sort of ironic in a day and age when people are touchy about too much 
government, because often participants will say: well, the organisation should 
do this or that.

We say: we’re setting up values, principles, intentions and guidelines. We’d 
rather not behave like a government. We would rather be involved in helping 
frame things, so people can adopt what they see as useful tools to move along 
in life.

Burning Man helps people connect with each other more authentically.

What can you tell us about extending and facilitating the Burning Man ethos 
globally?

In 1997, when we were first in debt (and the internet was coming to life) we 
found people wanting to help us. Up until that point, the event never had 
people in other cities or communities reaching out to us to create the Burning 
Man culture or affiliate with it.

Since 2004, there’s been an up-swelling of people wanting to do events and 
meet other Burners. So we formalised a process for that.

Through the work of local groups and leadership, we support a 10,000 person 
annual event in South Africa and a 7,800-person event in Israel. It’s also 
happening in South Korea and Japan. In Europe, there’s a number of events that 
range in size from about 250 to 1,500 – and there’s a group in the Netherlands 
that in July will have the first official Burning Man event using the name.

There’s a responsibility of festival producers to bring people together to 
live side-by-side and treat each other well

All of this isn’t franchised, like McDonald’s; it has to happen locally and 
come from the people there. We also don’t give them any money – we just give 
them the tools. Many of them know more about small event production that we do, 
so we’re learning from each other. And other staff members travel to all these 
different groups and share our lessons about leadership and managing
volunteers, among many other things.

We’re nurturing the interest and giving people the tools to produce the 
culture – not just at events, but in their wider communities.

There’s different work being done all over the world in these Burning Man 
communities – and they’re actually doing real community work: working in soup 
kitchens; craft; disaster relief. They do it around the Burning Man concept, 
because they know there’s wider trust in our structural and organic approach.

If you’ve been to Burning Man, you’re nice to your neighbour. It’s about 
taking it into communities and helping other people.

It comes back to the idea that people take the spirit of the event home – back 
into their communities. Is that the way festival culture should be heading?

I’ve been to the bigger ones – Glastonbury 
<http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/>, Bonnaroo <http://www.bonnaroo.com/> 
andFusion <http://www.fusion-festival.de/>, but also the smaller ones. I go to 
every festival I’m invited to.

Festival producers – not all of them, because some are just music and 
drinking, which don’t play the same way – have real social values. There’s a 
responsibility of festival leaders and producers to bring people together to 
live in close proximity, side-by-side and treat each other well.

If things went sideways on the planet – if no one trusted authority and 
religion wasn’t the place for people – I have a real belief that some of the 
festival community would look to each other to solve things, through the rules 
that we’ve learned by living together at events such as Burning Man and 
Glastonbury.

I really believe in the culture of bringing people together in these mass 
gatherings.

What can you tell us about Burning Man’s nonprofit status?

We didn’t build Burning Man as a nonprofit. We built it as a for-profit, then 
decided to turn it into a nonprofit. It was the right thing to do, because it 
has the right framework for the future. We didn’t want ownership originally, 
but we chose that route because it was nimble and quick. We had to work hard 
internally to understand – the whole staff – what it means to be a nonprofit.

It doesn’t mean that we’re poor or that we want low salaries for our staff. 
We’ve worked hard to be as ambitious as we were before and to learn more about 
what it means to engage in fundraising. We’re still learning.

We don’t want Burning Man to get bought out by those who make large, 
charitable donations. We don’t want favouritism. We’ve had to learn: how do we 
keep the culture and get the right kind of support as well?

What are the challenges facing Burning Man?

The [9% state] entertainment tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/09/burning-man-festival-ticket-prices-state-tax-black-rock-desert>
 passed last summer is horrible. It was implemented in October 2015. It’s very 
unfortunate. We only started selling tickets in January. We did send an appeal, 
which we got back in February. It said that we still qualified as a form of 
entertainment. It’s nearly 10% per ticket per person, so it’s just a horrible 
tax. We will be fighting that.

There’s also the federal government. It’s a constant battle with them over the 
amount of money they spend to help manage Burning Man. They keep wanting to 
take more control, but it’s ours to run. It’s a battle between the federal law 
enforcement, the administrators and our people to be self-governing.

It’s our event, so we’re constantly having to push back, to manage our own 
rules. We’re good at that. When we create a rule or we make a commitment to our 
operation, we follow through. But we constantly have to explain who we are and 
why we have a right to survive.

How much has the Burning Man community changed over the years?

Someone asked me recently how I felt about all the techies that are coming to 
Burning Man. It’s funny, because Wired magazine in 1996 – 20 years ago – opened 
the door to the tech community. This didn’t just happen yesterday.

There is definitely a wealthier element coming to Burning Man, but if you look 
at the event as a possible cultural force of change in the world, then you want 
to have everyone from all walks of life.

I don’t have any problem with the diversity of the demographic.

Remember, we work really hard to help other communities make Burning Man 
happen out in the world, in 45 different countries. We’re engaging with every 
colour, race and background. It’s getting richer and broader over time, not 
whiter.
