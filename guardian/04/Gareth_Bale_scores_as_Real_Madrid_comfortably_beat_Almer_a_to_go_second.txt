Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> once again did 
not miss the injured Cristiano Ronaldo as they bounced back from a poor 
performance in the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund with a 
dominant win against Almería.

Ángel di María, Gareth Bale, Isco and Álvaro Morata scored at the Bernabéu to 
move Real back up to second, and keep Almería in the relegation zone.

Di María hit the crossbar to set the tone early and followed up in the 28th 
minute by curling in the opener. Madrid toyed with Almería until Bale scored 
his 14th league goal of the season from Karim Benzema's pass in the 53rd 
minute, with Isco scoring three minutes later. Morata scored five minutes from 
time.

"We knew that the league would have more twists," Di María said. "We were 
behind [Barcelona] and then we were ahead, we fell behind again and now we are 
back in front. We know that we have to treat each remaining game as if it were 
the last."
