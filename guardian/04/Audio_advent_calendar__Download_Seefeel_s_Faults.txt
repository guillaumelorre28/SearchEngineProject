We're losing track of the treats on offer with our Audio Advent calendar. But 
it seems we're already onto Day 11 (doesn't time fly?) and so here's a free 
download from the influential Warp act. And here's what Mark Clifford had to 
say about it ...

Faults began with more dense and solid guitars but when Sarah added the vocal 
everything felt a little sugary. So guitars were stripped down and replaced 
with more abstract sounds to give the vocal the space it deserves. It was one 
of the last tracks we recorded in the sessions for the album."
