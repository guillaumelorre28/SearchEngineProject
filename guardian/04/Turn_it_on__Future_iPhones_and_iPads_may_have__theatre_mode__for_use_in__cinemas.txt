Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> analysts AppleInsider are 
more sceptical, but suggest the update will be “iPad-centric” and might 
“disable system sounds and haptic feedback, block incoming calls and messages 
and reduce initial screen brightness during a movie”. AppleInsider also 
suggests it could draw on a series of Apple-patented technologies going back to 
2012 that allow for the triggering of “customised phone settings automatically 
based on a phone’s GPS position”.

However, AppleInsider backs up Dickson’s claim of a 10 January start-date, 
saying its own site-tracker has shown a recent spike of visits from devices 
apparently running iOS 10.3.

Mobile phone use inside cinemas has been a bone of contention for years, with 
theAMC chain suggesting it could allow “texting-friendly” screenings

, and a series of cinema-rage incidents such as the widely reportedkilling of 
an audience member in Miami during a screening of Lone Survivor

 in 2014, and afilmgoer being Maced in Los Angeles at a showing of Mr Turner
