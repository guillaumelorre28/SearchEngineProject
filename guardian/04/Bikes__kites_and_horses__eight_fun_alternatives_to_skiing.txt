Ski joering 


Where to do it: Les Arcs, France
If you like the thought of getting on skis but baulk at the amount of effort 
required, ski joering is for you. Originating in Scandinavia as a means of 
getting around, you are harnessed behind a horse or dog and pulled along, 
controlling them with your voice and a rig with reins. It’s a good one for 
getting away from crowded pistes and there’s something quite soulful about 
enjoying the winter environment in the company of animals. Beginners can enjoy 
a gentle hack while the more experienced can go on a big gallop through powder.

• €50 for each outing including all equipment – and horse!

The airboard is essentially an inflatable sledge with small handles on either 
side that, presumably, you grip on to with dear life as you hurtle down the 
piste on your stomach. People have been clocked at 100km/h – and a face full of 
snow pretty much comes as standard, seeing as you’re about five inches above 
the ground. Grooves in the base allow for quick turns and braking using your 
body weight and feet. You may feel like a cannonball out of control but the 
good news is, you’ve always got a soft(ish) cushion to land on if anything goes 
wrong.
• Two-hour initiation and ride evening, including mountain aperitif, €30,

Yooner


Where to do it: Avoriaz, France

Who said you had get down the piste with technique and style? Not the makers 
of the yooner, that’s for sure. A seat mounted on a small ski, it’s a cross 
between skiing and tobogganing, which – if you can be bothered – you use to 
carve your way from top to bottom using the handle to brake and the inbuilt 
shock absorbers to protect your spine. Alternatively you can laugh hysterically 
while pretending you’re not actually doing this because, let’s face it, it’s 
not cool.
• Every Thursday from 5.30pm, it’s a 30-minute descent with a guide and costs

Being on a toboggan connected to 15 other people on toboggans did not sound 
like fun (who thinks these things up?). You weave your way down the mountain 
like some giant snowy human serpent, negotiating corners, bumps and obstacles 
with way far less grace than the real thing. But actually, if you get up a bit 
of speed, it is (cough) entertaining, and the perfect après pastime for 
corporate groups and families working together as one rosy-cheeked team. 
Ridiculously hilarious or hilariously ridiculous? You decide.

In the early days of mountain biking it was deemed a good idea to race on snow 
for winter-season giggles. Then some genius replaced the wheels with short skis 
and – voila! – the snowbike was born. There are different variations: some have 
pedals to rest your feet on, while others have you wearing short skis, but none 
come with brakes – other than your feet. For hooning it around the mountain, 
getting powder in your face and replicating the sensation of freeride mountain 
biking, snowbikes are brilliant and probably the only activity in this list 
with any real dignity.
• One-hour lesson, plus an extra two hours of snowbike rental, from €85, or 
rent a bike for the day from €33,skischule-neukirchen.at

Not exactly a practical – or safe – way of getting down a piste, as you’d get 
into all manner of mischief negotiating cable cars wires, snowkiting is for 
wide, open spaces or the backcountry – once you’ve got the skills. It involves 
harnessing the wind via a kite while still on your skis or snowboard and using 
the extra power to travel faster, further or up into the air. Haugostol is a 
snowkiting hotspot (coolspot!) with the Hardangavidda mountain plateau offering 
a huge area and stable wind conditions.
• EKVIP runs a two-day course  <http://kitekurs.no/shop/>from 2,399 Norwegian

A bit like a ski bike but with both your feet on individual short skis – one 
of them under the handle bars at the front so you can really get your carve on. 
In that respect it’s a closer feeling to skiing or snowboarding than the snow 
bike, yooner or – god forbid – the airboard. And it’s quite stable and pretty 
simple to learn so great for kids and people who aren’t feeling very brave.
• In La Plagne, you can try it out free every Wednesday afternoon from 5pm to 
7pm

My gut is screaming no! no! no! but in the interests of impartial journalism I 
give you the snowscoot. It’s a scooter on snow (read: mono board with handles – 
and that’s being kind) and that’s all there is to say. If you’re an adult that 
commutes on a scooter you’ll love it. Every single kid that terrorises 
non-scootering commuters as they bomb to school on them will love it, too. 
Everyone else will scratch their heads and wonder why the hell you aren’t at 
least on a skki trikke.
