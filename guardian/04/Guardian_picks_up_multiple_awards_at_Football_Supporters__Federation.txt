The Guardian has been named Newspaper of the Year at the Football Supporters’ 
Federation awards.

Commenting on the decision, the judges said:

“With a real ear for fan issues, it’s no surprise to see the Guardian 
shortlisted. Let’s not forget its commitment to top-class coverage of European 
football either, with great copy from the likes of Raphael Honigstein and Sid 
Lowe.”

Amy Lawrence, who writes for both the Guardian and the Observer, won the 
Writer of the Year award, and Guardian’s Football Weekly won Podcast/Radio of 
the Year.
