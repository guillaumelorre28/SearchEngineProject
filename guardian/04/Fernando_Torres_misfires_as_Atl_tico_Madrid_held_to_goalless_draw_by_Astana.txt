Atlético Madrid were held to a goalless draw at Astana in the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>, denting the Spaniards’ 
hopes of finishing top of Group C.

Atlético remain top of their group with seven points from four games, a point 
clear of Benfica who host Galatasaray later on Tuesday.

Atlético started well in the Kazakh capital and were lively in the early 
stages, creating some decent chances.

The Astana defender Evgeni Postnikov produced an excellent block in the 11th 
minute to keep out Tiago’s goalbound effort.

Fernando Torres <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fernando-torres>, who 
was looking for his 100th goal for Atlético, almost reached the landmark in the 
first half, but poked his shot wide after capitalising on a defensive mistake.

Roared on by a passionate capacity crowd, Astana improved as the first half 
wore on and finished the stronger of the two teams, yet they were unable to 
seriously test Jan Oblak.

The second half got off to a slow start, as Astana proved to be much tougher 
opponents than they were two weeks ago when they lost 4-0 in Madrid.

Dmitri Shomko had a good chance to break the deadlock for them, but his effort 
was saved by Oblak.

Diego Godín and Jackson Martínez, who replaced the out-of-sorts Torres just 
after 60 minutes, had chances for the Spanish club, while Yannick Carrasco hit 
the crossbar. Astana held on for a deserved point, but remain bottom of the 
group with two points.
