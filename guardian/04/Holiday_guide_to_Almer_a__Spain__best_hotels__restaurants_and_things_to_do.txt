If you want to scramble down to a cove and jump into crystal clear water the 
colour of sapphires, spend a night drinking mojitos in the desert, lounge on 
the vine-covered terrace of acortijo, eat fish you’ve never heard of and 
explore the wild west, then hire a vehicle and travel 30 minutes out of the 
city of Almería, inAndalucía <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/andalucia>.

Head west and you’ll end up hitting a vast expanse of polytunnels, but to the 
north there’s the 100 square miles of the Tabernas desert, the backdrop to 
Spaghetti Westerns, where Sergio Leone’s sets still stand. And south-east, 
there’s the volcanic cliffs, white cube pueblos, and coves of Cabo de Gata 
natural park. Although a much-loved tourist destination, the park’s towns – San 
José, Las Negras, Agua Amarga and Níjar – are very small, and there’s nothing 
much but cactus and beach in between them. All these attractions can be 
accessed from the ever-lively Almería city. Just remember, some of the coastal 
bars, restaurants and hotels close at the end of September.

The easy option is to choose a town or village with a beach and enjoy the 
benefits of bars, restaurants, kayaks and easy parking. The more challenging 
and rewarding option is to hike over headlands, or down tracks signposted from 
the coastal roads, to the dozens of hidden coves orcalas accessible only by 
foot or boat. For the energetic, there’s the 11km hike from Las Negras 
north-east to Agua Amarga, passing half a dozen gems includingCala San Pedro 
(with castle, and low-key community of euro-hippies) 40 minutes from the start, 
and the dreamyCala de Enmedio, near the end. For the less ambitious, there is 
the spectacular playaLos Muertos, well worth the pleasant 1km amble down a 
track off the Agua Amarga-Carboneras road. It’s also worth noting that if 
Cabo’s most famous beaches –Genoveses (a location used in Lawrence of Arabia) 
andMónsul (Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade) – are packed, a short hike from 
either will lead you to lonelier coves. (The 5km road from San José to 
Genoveses and Mónsul is closed to cars from 10am in summer, and an hourly 
shuttle bus service provided instead.)

This is the best preserved of three film sets built when the Tabernas desert 
was the epicentre of the Spaghetti Western boom. Created for Sergio Leone’s The 
Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966), it’s been the backdrop for hundreds of 
productions since, including a 2003Manchester United versus Real Madrid Pepsi 
advert <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdOcoqdW-hE> featuring David Beckham 
and Roberto Carlos, and the 2012 Dr Who episode A Town Called Mercy. It makes 
for a great, if surreal day out, what with tourists texting in the saloon and 
the music of Ennio Morricone drifting over the car park. Twice-daily wild west 
shoot-out shows are full of kid-friendly buffoonery, and a pool, restaurant and 
accommodation have been added with families in mind. Despite all this, there’s 
still something poignant about this strangely beautiful place and its macho 
history. Film buffs can head on toLos Albaricoques, on the other side of Nijar 
from Fort Bravo, a real village used as a location in many Spaghetti Westerns.

 Rodalquilar natural park. Photograph: Alamy 
This semi-ghost town is dominated by a gold mine, closed since the 1960s 
(tours available). You can also visit a nine-hectare botanical garden dedicated 
to all things deserty, hike through the surrounding valley, swim at the 
family-friendly El Playazo beach, and then hike or drive the five miles north 
along a bad track to the most famous of Cabo’s many abandoned places, Cortijo 
del Fraile, scene of the murder that inspired Lorca’s Blood Wedding and a key 
location in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It’s pretty dilapidated, even for a 
ruin, and fenced off, but an atmospheric spot.

City of Almería: highs and lows


The 10th-century Alcazaba is one of the most impressive citadels of the 
medieval Islamic al-Andalus territory and is second in size only to Granada’s 
Alhambra. It’s quite a hoof getting to the top of it, let alone fully exploring 
its many towers, rooms, squares and courtyards (this of course was the 
architect’s plan), but can be visited in the cool of the evening – there are 
guided tours at 8.30pm. Beneath the city are 4½km of tunnels, theRefugios de la 
Guerra Civil, which were constructed by volunteers with picks and shovels to 
shelter the population from bombing raids during the Spanish civil war. Guided 
tours only; book in advance.

The rocky coastline is as spectacular under the clear water as over it. There 
are 40 designated dive sites around the Cabo de Gata Unesco marine reserve, 
many involving caves and tunnels, shoals of mullet and amberjack. The 50-metre
Tunel Naranja <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmlXlThWcnU>, Cueva del Frío, 
and the underwater chamber at Cerro Negro are highly recommended. Local dive 
companies also offer boat trips, kayak rental, and guided kayak tours into 
navigable caves and between the pinnacles atArrecife de las Sirenas. Widely 
advertised and widely available (until the end of September), as are kayaks and 
pedalos for rent by the hour on the beach at seaside towns.

The oldest bar in town (1906) is still the standout choice in this dense patch 
of bars and cafes close to the cathedral. It’s authentically decorated (tiled 
walls, hams, religious artwork, framed cartoons and photos of deceased 
clientele), popular with locals, and the menu hasn’t changed in 30 years 
according to Adolfo, one of the five fast, wise-cracking bartenders. Enjoy 
tapas – grilled artichoke, skewers of chicken, grilled prawns, cheese or salty 
hot pork on warm bread – while standing at the marble bar, orraciones at a 
table round the back.

Restaurante Isleta del Moro


A family-run institution on the water’s edge in an isolated bay on Isleta del 
Moro, this started as a bar in 1969 when only four families lived in the 
village. It’s now packed at weekends – but retains its quirky, homely feel – 
with people converging from far and wide for pre-ordered paella, and the 
heartily recommended house speciality,cuajadera, a saffron-rich seafood stew 
(intriguingly, erroneously translated as “junket of sandpiper” on the menu). 
Duck through a tiny door onto the table-wide balcony for the best seats in the 
house. If the names on the infinite list of available fish are baffling –mero, 
lecha, breca, zama – refer to illustrations at the back of the menu or opt for 
thesurtido, the mix. It’s all good.

Before reaching the Arab fortress, the Alcazabar, you pass the Almedina 
barrio, a tumble of narrow streets and cheerfully coloured houses, where a 
neighbourhood association is at work conserving Almería’s Muslim heritage, the 
spirit of al-Andalus. This tiny restaurant with courtyard is part of that 
initiative, and well worth visiting en route to the fort for its legendarylimón 
a la hierbabuena (mint and lemon cordial) alone … although while there you 
could also go for a tagine and a few pastries stuffed with dates, chocolate, 
honey and nuts.

Asador la Chumbera, Agua Amarga 


It is possible to tire of fried fish at the beach. Luckily, this quietly 
elegant Cabo favourite, a short drive uphill, offers sophistication and 
variety, and you still get sea views from the outdoor tables. Everything here 
is rendered super-tempting with purées, caviar, truffle oils and whatnot, but 
for a hot day, try the red tuna sashimi with wakame followed by mandarin sorbet 
with vodka. With mains averaging €15 this isn’t a budget option, but a 
lunchtime or starry night treat. Book ahead.

El Jardin, San José


This busy little seaside town is comprised predominantly of fish restaurants 
and flip-flop shops. Several of the former are outstanding (try 4 Nudos), but 
El Jardin is a gem, particularly if you happen to be a vegetarian, lactose or 
gluten intolerant or partial to healthy, imaginative food. Here, finally, are 
salads with more than three ingredients, plus savoury crêpes, pizzas, 
imaginative stuff like carpaccio of squash, an apple ravioli, and dishes using 
truffles or ginger and almonds. The setting, a tiny terrace at the port end of 
the beach has no sea view (unless you stand) but the focus is the food. Top 
value with a menu of the day at €9, and a fair selection of non-vegetarian 
dishes for carnivores.

WHERE TO DRINK

Capitán de las Sardinas, Las Negras

 Capitán de las Sardinas 
A drink at the minuscule La Bodeguiya on the stony beach is obligatory at this 
lively cove, but don’t miss out on visiting this retro mariner-themed bar with 
en suite surf shop on a strip of bars near the roundabout. With good music, icy 
cocktails, and a cheery, fine-looking clientele, Capitán de las Sardinas is the 
creation of the charismatic Carlos who went bust in the crisis, languished as a 
barista in London, and has returned to try again. He’s pretty much a poster boy 
for surfing, for the powers of positive thinking and the rise of a generation 
of people in Spain who’ve had a tough time but are now the stronger for it.

El Vino en un Barco, Almería 


A cool spot in Almería’s historic heart renowned for ingenious cocktails (try 
mescal sour, or the house special, kraken sour concocted from spiced rum, 
lemon, ginger beer), and tapas. The black pudding and appleempanadas are good 
but the crisp, sugaryInés Rosales tortas de aceite, topped with tomato, goat’s 
cheese and salty anchovies, then grilled, are fabulous. Everything here is 
exquisitely designed, from lighting, to arty menus, and the ladies’ toilets.

spectacular views is open from 1pm for lunch, dinner and cocktails, and the 
late-night DJ action follows until dawn. Should you decide to take a break from 
the raggatek and dubwize, or whatever, take a look at the building next door – 
a vast 18th-century fort, Castillo San Felipe, built to keep the barbary 
pirates out.

Jo Bar aka Jolie Rouge, Escullos


If Apocalypse Now were a feel-good movie, Kurtz would be hanging out at Jo 
Bar. More a desert encampment, an assembly of mismatched seating, pallet 
decking, curios (skulls, art, a mannequin dressed as a pirate), it sits among 
shrubbery off a sandy track – coloured lights, the sounds of motorbikes and the 
music of the 1970s are the only clues to its existence. The open-air hangout, 
founded in 1993 by Frenchman Jo Belle, is legendary in a clandestine way, 
attracting bikers, rockers, and celebrities – Damien Hirst, Rob Spragg, and the 
late Joe Strummer among them. Jo is an artist, and his metal sculptures stand 
proud under the desert skies. But this bar is itself a crazily magnificent 
piece of work.

 La Almendra y El Gitano 
A heavenly place, with pergolas (shaded, plant-covered walkways) and creamy 
polished floors, tasteful Moroccan-style rooms (four doubles, four suites) set 
in an oasis of palms and succulents, it looks like a hotel, feels like the 
holiday home of a wealthy, tasteful friend, and is actually a casa rural, hence 
shared kitchen, no restaurant. Eat at nearby La Villa, Asador La Chumbera, or 
the many beach bars down the hill in Agua Amarga, the prettiest of Cabo’s 
seaside villages.

Hotel MC San José


A chic and stylish boutique hotel in a seaside town, with a proper seaside 
holiday feel courtesy of the boat in the lobby and liberal use of driftwood and 
pebbles. Copious basking space includes a central pool and flower-filled 
chill-out terrace, well-equipped games room, glass-walled dining room, 
subterranean lounge with soft white leather sofas, and bodega stocked with 
local wines. Standard rooms are great value, superior rooms have spiral 
staircases to sun roofs, and the small but sophisticated family suite with 
direct access to the pool is superb. Cool and sweet, with friendly and 
informative staff, and ideally located for quick access to the beaches of 
Genoveses and Mónsul.

 Restaurant area at Complejo Turístico y Camping Los Escullos, San Jose 
You don’t commune with nature here, but you do get free zumba, karaoke, 
mini-disco, water polo, aerobics, and drinking games along with access to the 
pool, snack bar, pizzeria, shop and toilet block. One of four official 
campsites in Cabo de Gato, its dense concentration of bungalows, safari tents, 
and pitches for camper van and tents, and the exuberance of Spanish campers, 
can be overwhelming, but kids will love it. There’s a good beach a short walk 
down a sandy track, and some of the natural park’s very best are a few minutes’ 
drive away.

Cortijo La Alberca, Nijar


Spanish country life is at its most idyllic at this 250-year-old farmhouse set 
amid grape vines, lemons, figs, and bougainvillea in the Ribera de Huebro 
valley, ideal hiking country in cooler months. The rooms, some converted 
outbuildings, are authentically restored with their original hefty doors and 
beams and shuttered windows; the pool, an ancient water deposit, has the look 
of an Arab bath. Whether it’s for the hospitality offered by Celeste, who runs 
thiscasa rural with her parents, her mother’s home-cooked dinners of rabbit and 
paella served on the terrace, or the quiet loveliness of the location, few 
places earn such euphoric reviews. “A lot of guests cry when they leave,” says 
Celeste, baffled but flattered.

Nuevo Torreluz, Almería


Spotless, sleek and comfortable, this is a good-value, modern option in the 
historic centre of the small city, close to the Alcazabar, cathedral and myriad 
bars and restaurants squeezed into narrow streets. The hotel’s Taberna bar is a 
popular post-work meeting spot, both for the quality of its tapas and the 
refreshing misty spray puffed over the outdoor seating area in summer.

Cala Chica, Las Negras


Everything in this cool and classy haven, from breakfasts and bathrooms to the 
front door, is so much more stylish than you’d expect for the price. The 
picture window in the upper floor lobby frames a view of enticing blue sea. The 
lower level rooms each have shady balconies and white-cushioned loungers on 
which to doze before a dip in the attractive pool. It’s a two-minute stroll 
back to the beach to book a boat ride, eat fish, dance and buy hippy trinkets.
