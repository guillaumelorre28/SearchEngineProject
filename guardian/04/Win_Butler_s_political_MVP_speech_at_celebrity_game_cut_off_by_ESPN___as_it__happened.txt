Win Butler gets political in MVP acceptance speech

Here’s the full text of Win Butler’s MVP acceptance speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/12/arcade-fire-win-butler-political-mvp-speech-all-star-celebrity-game-cut-off-by-espn>
.ESPN abruptly pulled the plug. Was a Bernie Sanders endorsement coming?

Win Butler: I’ve lived in the great city of Montreal for 15 years. I’ve 
represented Montreal. If you guys want to fast-track my Canadian citizenship, 
hopefully this will help make me a permanent resident. I just want to say that 
I’m retiring as a celebrity right now, so I will not be eligible for the 
celebrity game next year. I’m retiring as a celebrity. We brought this home for 
Canada. Respect to Drake. Respect to Team Canada.

Sage Steele: You know Kevin Hart has said he’s retired for 10 years and he 
keeps coming back so I feel like they’d welcome you back. Congratulations.

Win Butler: Thank you, I just want to say that it’s an election year in the US 
– [cue ESPN bumper music] – the US has a lot they can learn from Canada: 
healthcare, taking care of people, and I think ...

Sage Steele: So we’re talking about celebrities and not politics. 
Congratulations on your MVP!
 Win Butler gets political.

Win Butler named MVP of NBA All-Star celebrity game

Win Butler has been named MVP of the All-Star celebrity game after scoring 15 
points (on 6-for-17 shooting) and 14 rebounds in a winning effort. TheArcade 
Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> frontman, who was robbed of 
MVP honors last year, then announces his retirement from the celebrity game. 
Even more interestingly, he’s abruptly cut off by ESPN’s Sage Steele 
mid-sentence when he began to speak about American politics. A fantastically 
unstrung ending to a strange night.

Final: USA 64-74 Canada

That’s a wrap. All that’s left is to see who is named Most Valuable Player. 
Kevin Hart’s five points surely aren’t enough to warrant the honor. Surely not.

USA 61-70 Canada 1.33, 4th quarter

In the WWE-style storyline of tonight’s game, the United States is supposed to 
come back and at least make this a contest. But none of their players can make 
shots. With the USA trailing 67-56, Anthony Anderson literally comes off the 
bench during play to score a breakaway lay-up, a 6 v 5 score the referees don’t 
seem particularly interested in stopping play for because they have dinner 
reservations maybe?
 Anthony Anderson comes off the bench, quite literally, for a lay-up in 
transition. 
As Team USA’s chances at victory slide out of reach, acting head coach Andre 
Drummond is whistled up for a technical foul for arguing with the refs.
 Drummond gets dialed up for a T.

Another basket for Sudeikis, who’s been dormant for a bit, and USA has closed 
it to 53-49.Since that blistering first-half start he’s done very little, 
though his fundamentals, like this box-out of Genie Bouchard, warrant praise.

USA 46-53 Canada, end of 3rd quarter

Despite putting a trio of backcourt players on the floor – Kevin Hart, Nick 
Cannon and Muggsy Bogues – whose combined height doesn’t add up to Win Butler, 
Team USA has managed to cut into Canada’s lead and pull within striking 
distance entering the final stanza.

Also, the hell is Draymond Green wearing?
 Presented without comment: Draymond Green.

USA 33-39 Canada 4.50, 3rd quarter

Shockingly, Kevin Hart has not left the building as initially suggested. He’s 
just emerged from the Team USA locker room wearing the No1 shirt as the Rocky 
theme plays over the arena sound system.

wearing the same uniform number as Billups.

USA 28-37 Canada 7.04, 3rd quarter

We’re underway in the third quarter. Jason Sudeikis and Tracy McGrady both 
attempted five 3-pointers in that first half; Sudeikis made four, McGrady made 
zero. So that’s where we are in life right about now.

And ... what’s this? It appears Kevin Hart has left Team USA’s sideline in 
frustration. There’s no chance at all he’s gone to the locker room to change 
into playing clothes in order to take the court and play hero ball, right? No 
chance at all.

Half-time: USA 28-37 Canada

Team USA’s short rotation is clearly catching up with them. Since Aubrey’s 
second wave of players keyed that 8-0 run during the first quarter it’s been 
all Canada. The sort of the half, though, is clearly Raonic’s explosive dunk in 
the dying seconds of the second quarter.
 Milos just keeps winning.

breakaway, the Canadian tennis star climbs the ladder for the flush on the last 
scoring play of the first half.

Why Team USA coach Kevin Hart has stopped dialing up Jason Sudeikis is 
anyone’s guess.The second-guessers are coming out in full force on Twitter.
Lang Whitaker (@langwhitaker) 
Jason Sudeikis has been hot thus far -- 3 threes in the first half. Team USA 
stopped going to him though. That's on Coach Kevin Hart.

USA 24-29 Canada 4.07, 2nd quarter

At what point should we put out a missing-persons report on Genie Bouchard? 
Former Indiana Fever starTammy Sutton-Brown cans a long two 
<https://twitter.com/WNBA/status/698308265973669888> to extend Canada’s lead to 
seven, but O’Shea Jackson Jr (a/k/a Ice Cube’s progeny) responds with a 
3-pointer from the elbow. It was a good day. Sudeikis with back-to-back 
3-pointers, the latter from the corner on a Chauncey Billups assist, and 
Canada’s lead has been sliced to 25-24. The Saturday Night Live alum has a 
game-high 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting with three 3-pointers. Miami Heat guard 
Josh Richardson has taken notice.

USA 15-20 Canada, end of 1st quarter

Terrence J can’t make free throws. Guy Fieri is here. Surprised he’d let the 
cameras shoot him at courtside, he’s usually so publicity-shy. ESPN commentator 
Barry follows up his previous cringeworthy remark about Olivia Wilde by 1) 
saying he’s afraid that he’ll refer to Team USA’s Elena Delle Donne, the 
reigningWNBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wnba> MVP, as ‘Dellavedova’ and 
2) using “on fleek” in a sentence. Win Butler for two. Excellent work by 
Canada’s second unit to close the first half strong. They’re up five.

his long-running gig alongside Roxsi on BET’s 106 & Park and who now is 
apparently going by Terrence Jenkins, with a quick steal on the next possession 
but Team USA can’t convert. Shocker. Then very quickly Canada rattles off eight 
unanswered points, capped by a drive and dish from Scrubs star Tom Cavanagh to
Arcade Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> frontman Win Butler, 
who deposits the lay-up from safely within his shooting range, to give Canada a 
16-14. A furious Kevin Hart calls timeout and rips into his side.

USA 12-8 Canada 4.40, 1st quarter

Sudeikis has gone from 0 to 💯 real quick. Straight Outta Compton star O’Shea 
Jackson Sr is lockdown defense on Milos Raonic, but the ATP world No11 is 
getting buckets early. Tracy McGrady, beloved north of the border, throws it 
off the backboard but finishes with a lay-up. If only he had a DeLorean.

his charges during the first TV timeout.

Tip-off

And we’re off! And Jason Sudeikis opens the score by banking in a 3-pointer. 
If you got him on those +220 odds, you’re golden. And then he deposits a 
driving lay-up on the next trip down the court and people seem surprised.

Kevin Hart, a four-time MVP of the celebrity game who in years past has 
hijacked the game for his own comedic platform, has moved to the bench as Team 
USA’s coach. “Today I’m here to crush Canada and I apologize in advance,” the

They’re announcing the starting lineups here at the Ricoh Coliseum. First for 
Team USA: Anthony Anderson, Jason Sudeikis, Stephan James, Joel David Moore and 
HGTV’s Property Brothers stars Jonathan and Drew Scott, and ... wait ... these 
aren’t only the starters. Seems like they’re naming the entire rosters.

Good evening and welcome to tonight’s NBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> All-Star celebrity game at the Ricoh 
Coliseum in Toronto. A fascinating match is afoot between notables from the 
United States and Canada. Tip-off is just over 10 minutes from now.

While no reputable oddsmaker is taking action on tonight’s exhibition, Bovada 
has offered up a wager on which player will score first. Nick Cannon is the 
favorite at +170. If you’re looking for better value, why not have a punt on 
Milos Raonic, last seenpushing Andy Murray to five sets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/29/andy-murray-beats-milos-raonic-australian-open-semi-final>
 in the Australian Open semi-finals, who is +400.

Here’s the full text of Win Butler’s MVP acceptance speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/12/arcade-fire-win-butler-political-mvp-speech-all-star-celebrity-game-cut-off-by-espn>
.ESPN abruptly pulled the plug. Was a Bernie Sanders endorsement coming?

Win Butler: I’ve lived in the great city of Montreal for 15 years. I’ve 
represented Montreal. If you guys want to fast-track my Canadian citizenship, 
hopefully this will help make me a permanent resident. I just want to say that 
I’m retiring as a celebrity right now, so I will not be eligible for the 
celebrity game next year. I’m retiring as a celebrity. We brought this home for 
Canada. Respect to Drake. Respect to Team Canada.

Sage Steele: You know Kevin Hart has said he’s retired for 10 years and he 
keeps coming back so I feel like they’d welcome you back. Congratulations.

Win Butler: Thank you, I just want to say that it’s an election year in the US 
– [cue ESPN bumper music] – the US has a lot they can learn from Canada: 
healthcare, taking care of people, and I think ...

Sage Steele: So we’re talking about celebrities and not politics. 
Congratulations on your MVP!
 Win Butler gets political.  
Win Butler has been named MVP of the All-Star celebrity game after scoring 15 
points (on 6-for-17 shooting) and 14 rebounds in a winning effort. TheArcade 
Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> frontman, who was robbed of 
MVP honors last year, then announces his retirement from the celebrity game. 
Even more interestingly, he’s abruptly cut off by ESPN’s Sage Steele 
mid-sentence when he began to speak about American politics. A fantastically 
unstrung ending to a strange night.
 
That’s a wrap. All that’s left is to see who is named Most Valuable Player. 
Kevin Hart’s five points surely aren’t enough to warrant the honor. Surely not.

USA 61-70 Canada 1.33, 4th quarter

In the WWE-style storyline of tonight’s game, the United States is supposed to 
come back and at least make this a contest. But none of their players can make 
shots. With the USA trailing 67-56, Anthony Anderson literally comes off the 
bench during play to score a breakaway lay-up, a 6 v 5 score the referees don’t 
seem particularly interested in stopping play for because they have dinner 
reservations maybe?
 Anthony Anderson comes off the bench, quite literally, for a lay-up in 
transition. 
As Team USA’s chances at victory slide out of reach, acting head coach Andre 
Drummond is whistled up for a technical foul for arguing with the refs.

USA 54-63 Canada 5.05, 4th quarter

We’re clattering down the home stretch here in Toronto with the United States 
trailing by nine. Three-timeNBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> 
champion Rick Fox, whom many of you will be surprised to learn is Canadian, is 
moving shall we say gingerly.
 
Another basket for Sudeikis, who’s been dormant for a bit, and USA has closed 
it to 53-49.Since that blistering first-half start he’s done very little, 
though his fundamentals, like this box-out of Genie Bouchard, warrant praise.

ESPN’s cameras go to Team Canada coach Drake for a quick interview between 
quarters.“I don’t even know if [Hart] is on the active roster,” says Drake, 
keeping kayfabe. “But it’s all a family affair so we’ll let it slide.”
 
USA 46-53 Canada, end of 3rd quarter

Despite putting a trio of backcourt players on the floor – Kevin Hart, Nick 
Cannon and Muggsy Bogues – whose combined height doesn’t add up to Win Butler, 
Team USA has managed to cut into Canada’s lead and pull within striking 
distance entering the final stanza.

Also, the hell is Draymond Green wearing?

USA 33-39 Canada 4.50, 3rd quarter

Shockingly, Kevin Hart has not left the building as initially suggested. He’s 
just emerged from the Team USA locker room wearing the No1 shirt as the Rocky 
theme plays over the arena sound system.

How he’s going through an exaggerated stretching routine on the court to 
guffaws from the crowd as Chauncey Billups shoots free throws. A card on the 
ESPN broadcast indicates that Hart’s careerNBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> All-Star celebrity game averages 
through four games are 8.7 points, 3.0 assists and 35% shooting from the floor.

Team Canada coach Drake questions whether it’s legal since Hart was not listed 
on the active roster. From where I sit it’s a bigger problem that Hart is 
wearing the same uniform number as Billups.

USA 28-37 Canada 7.04, 3rd quarter

We’re underway in the third quarter. Jason Sudeikis and Tracy McGrady both 
attempted five 3-pointers in that first half; Sudeikis made four, McGrady made 
zero. So that’s where we are in life right about now.

And ... what’s this? It appears Kevin Hart has left Team USA’s sideline in 
frustration. There’s no chance at all he’s gone to the locker room to change 
into playing clothes in order to take the court and play hero ball, right? No 
chance at all.

Also at courtside: Vin Diesel. He’s making an ‘X’ sign with his fingers. Could 
a third xXx film be in the works after 2002’s xXx and 2005’s xXx: State of the 
Union? We can only hope.

Meanwhile, DeMar DeRozan’s clumsy description of his jeans during a half-time 
powwow with ESPN’s Sage Steele more or less mirrors the caliber of play on 
display right about now.
 This is where we’re at right about now.  
Team USA’s short rotation is clearly catching up with them. Since Aubrey’s 
second wave of players keyed that 8-0 run during the first quarter it’s been 
all Canada. The sort of the half, though, is clearly Raonic’s explosive dunk in 
the dying seconds of the second quarter.
 Milos just keeps winning.  
And Raonic closes the first half with a two-handed dunk! All alone on a 
breakaway, the Canadian tennis star climbs the ladder for the flush on the last 
scoring play of the first half.

Why Team USA coach Kevin Hart has stopped dialing up Jason Sudeikis is 
anyone’s guess.The second-guessers are coming out in full force on Twitter.

Jason Sudeikis has been hot thus far -- 3 threes in the first half. Team USA 
stopped going to him though. That's on Coach Kevin Hart.

seven, but O’Shea Jackson Jr (a/k/a Ice Cube’s progeny) responds with a 
3-pointer from the elbow. It was a good day. Sudeikis with back-to-back 
3-pointers, the latter from the corner on a Chauncey Billups assist, and 
Canada’s lead has been sliced to 25-24. The Saturday Night Live alum has a 
game-high 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting with three 3-pointers. Miami Heat guard 
Josh Richardson has taken notice.

USA 15-20 Canada, end of 1st quarter

Terrence J can’t make free throws. Guy Fieri is here. Surprised he’d let the 
cameras shoot him at courtside, he’s usually so publicity-shy. ESPN commentator 
Barry follows up his previous cringeworthy remark about Olivia Wilde by 1) 
saying he’s afraid that he’ll refer to Team USA’s Elena Delle Donne, the 
reigningWNBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wnba> MVP, as ‘Dellavedova’ and 
2) using “on fleek” in a sentence. Win Butler for two. Excellent work by 
Canada’s second unit to close the first half strong. They’re up five.

Nick Cannon with a left-handed lay-up. Terrence J, whom I’ve not seen since 
his long-running gig alongside Roxsi on BET’s 106 & Park and who now is 
apparently going by Terrence Jenkins, with a quick steal on the next possession 
but Team USA can’t convert. Shocker. Then very quickly Canada rattles off eight 
unanswered points, capped by a drive and dish from Scrubs star Tom Cavanagh to
Arcade Fire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire> frontman Win Butler, 
who deposits the lay-up from safely within his shooting range, to give Canada a 
16-14. A furious Kevin Hart calls timeout and rips into his side.
 
USA 12-8 Canada 4.40, 1st quarter

Sudeikis has gone from 0 to 💯 real quick. Straight Outta Compton star O’Shea 
Jackson Sr is lockdown defense on Milos Raonic, but the ATP world No11 is 
getting buckets early. Tracy McGrady, beloved north of the border, throws it 
off the backboard but finishes with a lay-up. If only he had a DeLorean.

“We’re having fun out here, but we’re not here to lose,” barks Kevin Hart to 
his charges during the first TV timeout.
 
And we’re off! And Jason Sudeikis opens the score by banking in a 3-pointer. 
If you got him on those +220 odds, you’re golden. And then he deposits a 
driving lay-up on the next trip down the court and people seem surprised.
