A Hong Kong-based transport operator has won the contract to run services on 
the Â£14.5bn Crossrail train route, beating British rivals Go-Ahead,National 
Express <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationalexpressgroup> and Arriva 
to the high-profile franchise.

MTR will operate services across the full route from 2019, with trains 
crossing from Reading through tunnels under centralLondon

London's mayor, Boris Johnson, said: "As hardworking engineers beaver away 
underneath our feet on the construction of Crossrail's tunnels, we are putting 
the final pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together above ground. I am delighted 
that we can announce the operator of this landmark railway, bringing it one 
step closer to welcoming passengers aboard."

MTR also operates the London Overground concession with Arriva 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/arrivabusiness> UK Trains as well as 
running the metro system in Hong Kong. Jay Walder, its chief executive, 
described Crossrail as "a 21st-century railway for a 21st-century London".

He added: "Crossrail's success will be finally realised through pioneering and 
sustaining a culture to deliver world-class performance. We will work 
passionately with TfL to achieve this."

Crossrail will see the transformation of a number of overcrowded central 
London Tube stations and drastically improve cross-London journey times. 
However, the amount of government money spent on the project has led to 
accusations from politicians and campaigners outside London that the south-east 
of the UK is receiving a disproportionate share of infrastructure investment in 
the UK.
