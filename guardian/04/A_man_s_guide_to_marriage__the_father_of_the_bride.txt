Call me a sappy old romantic if you will, but I love the movie Father of the 
Bride (both theSteve Martin remake <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101862/> and 
the Oscar-nominatedSpencer Tracy original 
<http://www.whosdatedwho.com/topic/6292/father-of-the-bride-2.htm>). It 
encapsulates the bittersweet journey of a parent: watching your daughter grow 
up; doubting that any boy can be good enough for her; footing the bill for a 
social event that takes over your family's life; and the big day at the end of 
it.

Last summer Philip Robinson told his version of this journey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/04/father-of-the-bride> in a 
wedding diary. Sample entries: "22 May: My wife thinks 52mins 11secs is too 
long for a FOTB speech" and: "2 August, wedding day: In the wedding car I 
needed to say memorable, poignant words. But in Peter Kay style I asked the 
taxi driver what time she finished. As we arrived I hurriedly gave Anna a pearl 
of wisdom: 'Never go to bed on an argument: stay up and fight.'"

This is perhaps only bettered by Jim Royle's advice to his son-in-law-to-be on 
Denise's wedding day:

Jim: ... So if you're going for a night out and you think you'll be back at 
11:30, tell her you won't be back 'til 12! Then she'll think you've come home 
early to see her.
Dave: Oh, that's pretty good, that, Jim, ta.
Jim: Yeah, me dad taught me that, just a little trick, to keep them sweet.
Dave: Cheers. I'll defo use that.
Jim: Well, y'know, it's up there for thinking, down there for dancing, innit 
... (Pause) You will look after her, won't ya?
Dave: ... Yeah, Jim. Course I will.

The father of the bride ploughs a strange furrow, being mostly involved in the 
female side of the wedding. Philip's diary certainly bears this out - although, 
somewhat controversially, he also went on the stag weekend.

On a related note, I think that how to address your wife's father is always 
one of the trickiest questions for a son-in-law. Never quite happy with calling 
my father-in-law by his first name, I was saved once we had children and I 
could call him Grandad.

Back to the big day. The speech is, of course, the most public part of the 
FOTB's role, withDangerdoormouse making this point 
<https://www.theguardian.com/users/dangerdoormouse/comments> a couple of weeks 
ago:

"I don't know why this has happened but Father-of-the-brides have decided they 
need to be funny. This rarely seems to work. It can be funny hearing a good 
best man tell amusing anecdotes about his mate, it doesn't work with a Dad. He 
doesn't know the really amusing stories about his daughter, and if he does say 
too much the bride gets very embarrassed. I heard one Dad talking about his 
daughter's potty training. Not good."

I've heard one of those speeches too; the bride was clearly mortified. 
However, I don't think it's true that the FOTB doesn't know funny tales about 
his daughter; it is just that they are, probably, mostly from her younger 
years. The FOTB's speech should be warm, affectionate and sprinkled with 
anecdotes.

There are still many questions that I'd like your help answering. Should the 
FOTB pay for the wedding? If so, how much say should he have in the 
arrangements? If there is no FOTB, who should fill those shoes? Indeed, some 
may ask why it should be the bride's father "giving her away" in the first 
place. What advice should the FOTB offer the bride, if any?

As always, your thoughts, suggestions and anecdotes would be most welcome.
