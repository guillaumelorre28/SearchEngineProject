Phillip Inman reaches a wrong-headed conclusion (Avarice: true villain behind 
global slump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/12/pension-funds-global-recession>
, 12 April). In highlighting the discredited and almost criminal policy laxness 
in the Alan Greenspan "self-correcting" notion of capitalism, Inman correctly 
identifies the root cause of the financial disaster. He then moves from this 
position to point the finger at ordinary people across the globe instead. He 
calls them investors, but those of us, particularly in the public sector, with 
pensions are not investors in any meaningful sense.

To suggest that by virtue of being a member of my local authority pension 
scheme I was somehow part of a greedy conspiracy which ended up with the toxic 
financial derivatives is plainly ludicrous. His suggestion that individual and 
unsophisticated investors "demanded" risk-free returns of 10% is equally 
nonsensical. Most individual investors and pension-scheme members invest at one 
remove from the market, delegating decision-making to experts in a complicated 
environment. They properly assume that their fund managers will be investing at 
the best mix of return and risk, operating in a highly regulated market, where 
the financial authorities ensure probity.

If national financial authorities failed to identify the huge growth of toxic 
financial products, why on earth is Inman holding individual investors to 
higher standards? Given that the individual workers Inman used as examples – 
teachers and car workers – will be the ones who are most cruelly hit while the 
bankers, fund-managers and the financial regulators escape unscathed, protected 
and fabulously wealthy, Inman's article is offensive.
