Key points

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> used five 
of his six questions to press the prime minister on the government’s housing 
record and the last on the closure of women’s refuges. Corbyn accused Theresa 
May of failing to properly regulate unscrupulous private landlords. May 
responded by accusing Corbyn of being against the private rental market on 
principle. On Twitter there was speculation that May had employed a new joke 
writer with two memorable lines from the PM.

Snap verdict

An unedifying draw. May sounded confident, but her pre-scripted anti-Corbyn 
jibes (in response to questions two and three) came over as unprovoked, 
gratuitous and consequently rather cheap. It was reminiscent of David Cameron’s 
Bullingdon aggro, but Cameron found a way of at least making his attacks sound 
relevant. Corbyn ignored the obvious topics (grammar schools or Brexit) and he 
asked solid, serious questions about one of the most pressing social questions 
of our time. But, as ever, he did not really use follow-up questions to drive 
home his points and so he did not succeed in causing her discomfort. May was 
relatively weak on detail, but she did try to turn the argument into a wide one 
about values, and about home ownership, and on these points Corbyn’s responses 
were thin.

Most memorable lines


May to Corbyn: 


The train’s left the station, the seats are all empty, the leader’s on the 
floor, even on rolling stock they are a laughing stock.

After Corbyn used his familiar tactic of quoting a voter’s question – this 
time from Jenny on housing – May had another joke in her back pocket. After 
Corbyn appealed on Twitter for contributing questions, May quoted one response 
he received suggesting a question for her:

Does she know that in a recent poll on who would make the better prime 
minister ‘don’t know’ scored higher than Jeremy Corbyn?
