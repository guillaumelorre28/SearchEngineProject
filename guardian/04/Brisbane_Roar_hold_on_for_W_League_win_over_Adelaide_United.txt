Allira Toby came after the break and scored just minutes into the second half 
as the Roar looked set to run away with the contest.


Adelaide, despite missing several key personnel including Brazilian import 
Mônica, came back strongly creating numerous scoring opportunities as the match 
became stretched.

Adriana Jones pulled a goal back on the hour mark, while Sofia Huerta scored 
from the penalty spot to set up a grandstand finish.


The Roar went into the match with just seven points from five outings, but the 
win kept the two-time champions in touch with the competition’s frontrunners.


Brisbane tackle Canberra United next weekend after the capital’s team claimed 
a stunning 2-1 win over the previously undefeated Melbourne City on Saturday.


“We knew we had to watch Adelaide on the counter-attack, but unfortunately we 
let them come up with two goals that way,” Roar midfielder Gorry said. “We are 
definitely going out to beat Canberra next weekend, but it will be a tough 
match so we will have to prepare.”

Meanwhile, Western Sydney Wanderers avoided dropping to last as American 
forward Katie Stengel scored a last-minute equaliser for a 2-2 draw against 
struggling Melbourne Victory.


A late goal from rookie winger Kariah White had seemed set to secure all three 
points for the Victory, who were indebted to new goalkeeper Bethany Mason-Jones 
for a first-half penalty save.
