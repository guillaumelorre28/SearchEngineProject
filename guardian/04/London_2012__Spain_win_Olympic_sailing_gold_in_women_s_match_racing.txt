Spain's sailors won the Olympic gold medal in women's match racing on Saturday 
thanks in part to a boat-handling error by Australia that swept their skipper 
into the water.

With the best-of-five match tied at 1-1, the boats were sailing nearly 
side-by-side downwind in big waves on Weymouth Bay when the Australian crew 
lost control and their boat rolled on its side. The skipper, Olivia Price, was 
swept out of the back of the boat and her crew had to pick her up before 
continuing.

Spain won that race by 1min 1sec but the 20-year-old Price and her crew won 
the fourth race to force a deciding match.

In another mistake, Price was penalised in race five for a right-of-way 
violation and Spain sailed ahead to win the gold.
