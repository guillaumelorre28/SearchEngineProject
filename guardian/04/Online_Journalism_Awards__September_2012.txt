The Guardian has won a prestigious prize at the 2012 Online Journalism Awards 
(ONA) for its US interactive featureGay rights in the US, state by state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states>
 onguardiannews.com <http://www.guardiannews.com/>. 

The interactive, which was up against finalists NPR.org, NYTimes.com and The 
Toronto Star, scooped first place in the "explanatory reporting" category.

Launched on the eve of President Obama announcing his support of same-sex 
marriage, the feature employs colour wheels to demonstrate how the rights of 
gay, lesbian and transgender individuals vary across regions of the US on 
marriage equality, adoption, anti-discrimination and employment.

The award comes just one year after the Guardian opened the digital newsroom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/guardian-unveils-us-url> in the 
US.
