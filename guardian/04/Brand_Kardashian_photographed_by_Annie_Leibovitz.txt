Here's a little vignette of the modern world for you: Annie Leibovitz, creator 
of some of the most memorable images of American popular culture in the late 
20th century – Bruce Springsteen on the cover ofBorn in the USA 
<http://www.brucespringsteen.net/albums/bornintheusa.html>; Demi Moore naked 
and pregnant on the cover of Vanity Fair;Whoopie Goldberg in a bath of milk

 havingnarrowly avoided bankruptcy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/09/annie-leibovitz-debt-deal> 
last year – is now shooting pictures for Kim Kardashian (see here for pictures) 
<http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/annie_leibovitz_shoots_the_kardashi.php>, a 
reality TV star who built household-name fame and a $35m fortune on a career 
that began with a sex tape.

The Kardashian sisters – Kim, Khloé and Kourtney – have followed their 
bestselling autobiography,Kardashian Konfidential 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780312628079>
, with a fashion and lingerie collection for US department store Sears called 
the Kardashian Kollection. No, my keyboard is fine, thanks, they just really 
like the letter K. So much so that they refer to themselves as theKardashian 
Klan <http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/annie_leibovitz_shoots_the_kardashi.php>, 
when many less committed (kommitted?) fans of that particular consonant might 
think spelling clan with a K was a leetle bit too KKK for comfort.

Anyways. If you've been looking for a leopardprint jumpsuit or a pink lace 
basque

, look no further. If not, look away now.
