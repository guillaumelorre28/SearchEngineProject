Winning tip: Dar Poeta, Trastevere, Rome

The best pizza restaurant in Rome. It looks nothing from the outside, but you 
get a real taste for Italian food at its finest. It's totally Italian, no 
English on the menu. See what others are ordering, then point and say you'd 
like the same - the staff are friendly so don't feel embarrassed. It's tiny, 
full of character and, if you're lucky, a cello player will sing and play to 
you. One of the best moments in Rome I have ever had.

Amalfi coast

Scenic bus tour

Forget expensive coach or taxi tours along the Amalfi coast - take the public 
bus from Sorrento bus station and head towards Positano. For a few euros it's a 
scenic trip of a lifetime - try to sit on the entry step looking out. They even 
run on time. Magic.

La Casa nei Pini organic B&B, Viareggio

An affordable alternative to an agriturismo, this B&B is a rural retreat and 
hippie haven. Everything here is organic, from the homemade, home-grown 
breakfast to the natural paint on the walls. Ten minutes on foot to the sea and 
with the pine forests of San Rossore national park all around, the house is 
surrounded by natural beauty. It's the homely touches that make this B&B stand 
out, from the bikes for guests to breakfast in the garden. If you are visiting 
at carnival time the owner will drive you into town for the festivities, and 
the medieval city Lucca, artists' haven Pietrasanta and Puccini's house at 
Torre del Lago are a short train ride away.

Venice 

Apartment near San Marco

My partner and I stayed at Piccola Perla, a charming one-bedroom apartment in 
St Antonin, midway between St Mark's Square and Arsenale. It was quiet and 
tastefully decorated, and it was great to come back to after a long day's 
sightseeing, put our feet up in the little courtyard and have a glass of 
prosecco. Being on a budget, some evenings we cooked our own meals, so it was 
good to be only a couple of bridges away from one of only two supermarkets I 
saw in Venice. Recommended as a romantic getaway or an inexpensive spot for a 
small family (there was a sofa bed in the living room).

A Venice Fish hostel

It's not easy to find budget accommodation in Venice and, if you do, there's 
usually a lock-out or curfew, so we were happy to find Venice Fish by the 
canal. This beautiful 16th-century palace is on one of the main streets but 
inside the hostel is fun, modern and laid-back with big and homely rooms. 
Breakfast and dinner are included and the staff will take you out to the local 
nightlife. You're only a few minutes from the Casino, Rialto bridge and the 
train station.
