A Herald Sun report claiming Cardinal George Pell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-pell> is being investigated 
by police over child abuse allegations has sparked angry words between the 
paper’s top columnist Andrew Bolt and the reporter behind the exclusive story.

Bolt, who calls himself a friend of the Vatican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican> official, labelled Lucie 
Morris-Marr’s report that police were investigating allegations of sexual abuse 
by Pell a week before he was due to appear before the royal commission a 
vicious and shameful smear which was part of a “sinister” campaign to destroy 
the cardinal.

But Morris-Marr, a senior writer on the Herald Sun, defended her story, saying 
it was not the result of leaks or a smear campaign but grew out of an 
old-fashioned investigation.

Pell has strongly denied allegations of involvement in child sexual abuse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/cardinal-george-pell-hits-back-at-claims-he-is-under-investigation-over-child-abuse-allegations>
, saying they are without foundation and utterly false.

In his column in Monday’s paper Bolt said the Pell report published in the 
Herald Sun on Saturday was worse than “vicious and shameful” and the leak to 
the paper “stinks”.

“It smells like an attempt to destroy a man without giving him a chance to 
defend himself,”Bolt said

.

“Now the campaign to destroy Pell has become sinister as well, after it was 
joined by – in my view – elements ofVictoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> Police.”

Morris-Marr responded to Bolt on Twitter, saying he was wrong to call it a 
leak from police and it was “utter rubbish” to say her report was a part of a 
witch hunt. Bolt was a “friend” of Pell, she pointed out.

The Herald Sun, published by News Corp Australia, published a front-page 
report on Saturday claiming Victoria police detectives from taskforce Sano had 
compiled a dossier containing allegations that Pell committed “multiple 
offences” over four decades.

The story had to be published online on Friday evening after Pell issued a 
statement to all media in response to questions from the Herald Sun.

Morris-Marr’s report detailed the allegations against the 74-year-old, who is 
now in charge of finances at the Vatican in Rome, and the story was widely 
reported in other outlets.

“Legal sources have told the Herald Sun that more than a dozen detectives from 
Sano taskforce – set up to probe allegations arising from the child abuse royal 
commission – have worked for the past year on the investigation, interviewing 
‘numerous’ alleged victims,” the paper reported.

A spokesman from the Vatican in Rome told Guardian Australia on Friday night 
the allegations were clearly designed to do maximum damage to the cardinal and 
the Catholic church and undermine the work of the royal commission.

On Saturday the Melbourne archbishop, Denis Hart, who succeeded Pell in the 
role in 2001, said the allegations “do not reflect the man I have known for 
more than 50 years”.

“It is very disturbing and concerning to read reports based on leaks to the 
media that Victoria police has been investigating allegations of abuse against 
Cardinal George Pell for the past year and that his first knowledge of these 
allegations has come from those media reports,”Hart said

Bolt was not alone in supporting Pell. The Australian also defended the 
cardinal and called the allegations against him published in its sister paper 
“curious”.

“It remains to be seen what, if anything, emerges from a reported Victoria 
police investigation into allegations against the cardinal himself,” the 
Australian’s editorial said on Monday.

“It is curious, to say the least, that after his many decades in the public 
eye, such claims against the cardinal have only emerged now.”

In a column published in the Australian before the recent allegations were 
reported, conservative columnist Gerard Henderson said Pell was being subjected 
to a lynch-mob that had not been seen in Australia for a century.

“It’s about a century since Australia experienced a lynch-mob mentality of the 
kind that has pervaded the debate over Cardinal George Pell’s forthcoming 
appearance at the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual 
abuse,”Henderson said
