By the time Robina Nambiru brought her nine-month-old son to Kiboga district 
hospital he had developed severe malaria.

Baby Passe's condition was caused by "eating dirty things", Robina told me, 
another example of the numerous myths that still persist about malaria. Many 
people still believe it is caught from eating mangoes, as the number of cases 
peaks when the fruit is in season.

Robina's partner left her with three children so she lives with her parents 
who are looking after the others while she is at the hospital. She will sleep 
on the floor beside her child's cot and must provide her own bedding and food 
for both of them. She was able to afford a taxi to take her the 6km to the 
hospital but many families cannot.

Every minute she spends at the hospital, though, is a minute not spent farming 
in the fields, where her family grows beans.Malaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/malaria> is a costly illness.
