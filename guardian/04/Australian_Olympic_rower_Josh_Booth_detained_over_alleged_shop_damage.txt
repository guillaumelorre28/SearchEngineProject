The Australian rower Josh Booth was detained by police for allegedly causing 
damage to a shop front in an alcohol-related incident hours after he competed 
in the men's eight at the Olympic regatta at Eton Dorney.

The Australian team chef de mission, Nick Green, said on Thursday that Booth 
fainted while at the police station and was taken to hospital. He was released 
a short time later and was not charged by police.

Green, who said he received a call from police at 3am on Thursday morning 
about the incident, said he will make a decision on potential disciplinary 
action after he receives more information from the police and Booth.

The Australian rowers are staying near to the venue in a former vicarage owned 
by Eton college, rather than at the Olympic Village. The eight had finished 
sixth in Wednesday's final.
