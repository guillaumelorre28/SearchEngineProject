The One World Media awards recognise excellence in media coverage of the 
developing world.

The Press Journalist of the Year award went to Adrian Levy and Cathy 
Scott-Clark for their work in Guardian Weekend with a focus on Burma, Cambodia 
and China. The judges praised their writing which "depicts a developing world 
that is uniquely relevant and exciting".

In the environment category, Jonathan Watts' report on the 2008 global food 
crisis from the Phillipines received the award, along with Dan Chung who 
contributed video and images. The judges said this was "reporting at its very 
best".

Alex Renton won the popular feature award for his Observer Food Monthly piece 
about Cambodia which the judges said "combined historical context, current 
economic and political issues, the daily lives of compelling characters and a 
clear outline for future solutions; a rare feat for any journalist".

No other newspapers were among the winners.
