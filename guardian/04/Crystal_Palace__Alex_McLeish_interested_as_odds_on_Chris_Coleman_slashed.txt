Alex McLeish <https://www.theguardian.com/football/alex-mcleish> has indicated 
a desire to become Crystal Palace's new manager, saying that he would not be 
fazed by the challenge of keeping the struggling club in the Premier League.

Palace, who are bottom of the table with three points from their first nine 
matches, have been without a manager sinceIan Holloway left by mutual consent 
last week

, although the odds on Chris Coleman taking the job have shortened dramatically 
in the past 24 hours after a flurry of bets.

Holloway guided Palace through the Championship play-offs last season but 
after signing 16 players in the summer, a terrible start took its toll. McLeish 
has experience of the Premier League, with Birmingham City and Aston Villa, 
although he was relegated twice with the former andsacked by the latter

. The 54-year-old has been out of a job sinceleaving Nottingham Forest in 
February

.

"There hasn't been any contact yet but I am a free agent," McLeish said. 
"Crystal Palace are in a position that's precarious for them but there's still 
a lot of points to play for. I've had those kind of challenges before and I've 
had some success and some failures but if you've got a fighting spirit and good 
players playing to their strengths, then why can't Palace stay up?"

Coleman is a popular figure at Selhurst Park after a successful four-year 
spell as a player there and the 43-year-old is yet to commit his future with 
Wales to beyond November, when his contract runs out, even though he has been 
offered a new deal.

Palace are also reported to have held talks with Martin O'Neill and Tony 
Pulis, while also retaining an interest in their former manager, Neil Warnock, 
but the club have confirmed that Keith Millen, who took charge of the2-0 defeat 
by Arsenal

 last weekend, will continue in his caretaker role for Saturday's trip to West 
Bromwich Albion.
