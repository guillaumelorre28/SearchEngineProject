The Australian Sports Commission may guarantee only 60 per cent of funding to 
Athletics <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics> Australia until the 
sport shows its house is in order.

The much-anticipated review of athletics has called for sweeping reforms, 
including a unification under one structure.

Former Australia cricket coach John Buchanan chaired the One Sport review, 
which was commissioned following Athletics Australia’s trouble-plagued Glasgow 
Commonwealth Games campaign.

Coach Eric Hollingsworth was sent home after he publicly criticised star 
hurdler Sally Pearson.

“The situation that the sport of athletics finds itself in is not new. It has 
been a fragmented sport historically,” Buchanan said.

“Poor governance procedures are central to this lack of an integrated and 
coordinated delivery of the sport.”

“The opportunities for the sport of athletics are enormous if it can get its 
act together.

“That is, one sport, junior and senior, to provide the range of fundamental 
physical skills that benefit all people across most sports and activities, 
whether they are recreational athletes or have a desire to pursue a high 
performance pathway.”

The review has made 16 recommendations, mostly covering governance and high 
performance.

It has called for an oversight committee, made up of representatives from the 
sports commission, the Australian Institute of Sport and Athletics Australia.

The committee would meet monthly and monitor reform in Athletics Australia 
until it is satisfied for 18 months.

The review said the sports commission should only guarantee 60 per cent of 
funding for 2015-16.

AA would receive the balance of the crucial money when the oversight committee 
is satisfied with the reform progress.
