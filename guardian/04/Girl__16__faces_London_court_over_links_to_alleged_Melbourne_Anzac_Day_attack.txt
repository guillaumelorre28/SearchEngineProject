booth.


The girl wore a long, coloured headscarf and sat quietly. She was charged by 
counter-terrorism police after a warrant was executed at a house in Manchester 
on 3 April.

The two charges are that she possessed a document containing information of a 
kind likely to be of use to a person preparing or committing an act of 
terrorism, namely a recipe for explosives and the “anarchy cookbook”.
