The Primera Division title race took another twist on Saturday as Atlético 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> suffered a shock 
defeat away to struggling Almería – which cost them top spot after rivals Real 
Madrid put four past Villarreal to go top on goal difference.

José Antonio Verza curled in a stunning goal – surely meant as a cross – 10 
minutes from time after Almería's stubborn defensive display had driven 
Atlético to distraction on a night of pure frustration. Atlético managed just 
one shot on target during the whole 95 minutes, from a free-kick which was 
easily saved by Andrés Suárez.

Things got worse five minutes later for Atlético when goalkeeper Daniel 
Aranzubia – perhaps at fault for the opener – blundered in a big way, fluffing 
a back-pass and then fouling Jonathan Zongo to concede a penalty, and seeing 
red. The penalty was gleefully converted by Verza who fired into the top-hand 
corner of the net.

Atlético ended the night in second place in the overall standings – if only on 
goal difference following a big win for Real Madrid – but victory for Barcelona 
at Sevilla on Sunday would send Gerardo Martino's men back to the top of the 
league.

Under that scenario, all three title challengers would be on 57 points after 
Real dispatched Villarreal 4-2.
