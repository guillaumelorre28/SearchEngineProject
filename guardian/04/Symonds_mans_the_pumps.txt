West Indies require 241 more runs today to win the first Test against Australia
 with nine wickets in hand. The hosts moved on to 46 for one in their second 
innings, chasing a target of 287, before taking the light early in the evening 
session of the fourth day at Sabina Park.

Brenton Parchment (15) was the only West Indian to fall, drawing his bat away 
too late from a Stuart Clark delivery, with Brad Haddin making no mistake 
behind the stumps. Australia were restricted to 167 all out in their second 
innings, with Dwayne Bravo claiming four for 47, including the wicket ofAndrew 
Symonds <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-symonds>.

The 32-year-old was the only player to offer any resistance but his dismissal 
for 79 signalled the beginning of the end for the tourists. Brad Hodge (27) and 
Haddin (23) were the only other Australians to reach double figures. Symonds 
came to the crease at 18 for five and looked in determined mood following his 
70 not out in the first innings but after he was held by Darren Sammy at mid-on 
the Australian innings petered out.

The holders Durham dodged the Sunday rain to beat Scotland by 38 runs in a 
vital Friends Provident Trophy match. Victory maintained Durham's slim chance 
of reaching the quarter-finals.

Surrey kept open a path to the last eight, beating Essex by eight wickets at 
Chelmsford. Essex remain in a strong position to qualify. In the south/west 
groupWorcestershire beat Glamorgan by seven wickets. And Gloucestershire are 
almost guaranteed to make the knockout stage after beatingHampshire with two 
balls to spare in a 20-over slog.

The former England seamer Darren Gough, 37, is to retire at the end of the 
season. "I think it's time now," said the Yorkshire captain. "I think I've had 
a good innings and it's time to call it a day."
