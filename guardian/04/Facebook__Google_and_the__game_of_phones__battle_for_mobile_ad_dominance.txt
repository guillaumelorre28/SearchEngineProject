With more than 4.8 billion mobile devices 
<http://tech.co/performance-brand-advertising-2014-04> now in use around the 
globe, the rapid growth of mobile advertising in the past 12 months is no myth 
to any of us, but its influence on the digital landscape as a whole is, perhaps 
surprisingly to some, still relatively small, being responsible for just $18bn 
of digital's $119.8bn overall global spend in 2013.

However, mobile's current minority stake in digital doesn't seem to perturb 
the 400+ mobile ad networks around the world, all of whom are vying for a share 
of what they believe to be an increasingly lucrative prize.

It certainly appears to be a prize worth fighting for as the global mobile ad 
market is forecast to grow (this year alone) by 75.1% to $31.45bn. But it won't 
be an easy ride.

Traditional banner advertising, the staple weapon of so much commercial 
success in digital in the past decade is proving to be much less effective in 
the mobile theatre of war.

Yet the behemothic kingdoms of Facebook and Google, responsible for almost 
two-thirds of this still fast-emerging sector are firmly entrenched in a battle 
that neither can afford to lose.

Combined, the two companies claimed 75.2% of the additional $9.2bn that went 
towards mobile in 2013.

"We're focused on building a stable mobile platform," said CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
recently at the F8 Developer Conference, confirming that mobile app install ads 
have resulted in 350m total app installs since the feature's launch in June 
2012.

Zuckerberg believes that a "cross platform" platform where Apple, Google, 
Microsoft and other competing verticals should be unified for the mobile user.

The recent re-introduction of mobile ad network FAN (Facebook Audience 
Network) also indicates that Facebook want to cover all their bases when it 
comes to mobile ad formats.

FAN allows advertisers to use banner ads as well as custom ads to match the 
specific app.

Facebook's battle tactics certainly appear to be working as 59% of their Q1 
2014 $2.77bn ad revenue came from mobile.

As for the next 12-24 months, Facebook have plenty of mobile firepower as 
investments in WhatsApp and Instagram will start to bear fruit, as well as the 
Facebook Messenger service and their news app, Paper.

Google's 2009 acquisition of AdMob proved to be a shrewd investment as they 
still currently dominate the mobile ads market, yet they faced a slide of two 
percentage points to 47% in 2013.(Facebook took 18% of the market in the same 
period).

The potential jewel in Google's "mobile crown" is, I believe, YouTube, which 
last year contributed $2bn, 5.6% of Google's overall net ad revenue.

However, as search becomes less relevant, Google are having to take a more 
innovative approach to mobile optimization to regain their market share.

At a recent conference 
<http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/15/heres-how-google-can-boost-the-mobile-ad-market/>
 in Sausalito, Brendon Kraham, director of emerging ad sales and product 
strategy at Google focussed on the potential that Google sees in monitoring 
both untracked mobile routes to purchase and the under-utilised relationship 
between a mobile user's purchase within a "physical store".

They also favour expanding click (or "tap")-to-call features within mobile 
ads, especially where a call centre is a more favourable route to closing the 
sale than form filling on a smartphone.

The mobile ad market still clearly has much to learn from experimentation.

With so many additional (as yet untracked) influences to consider such as the 
small but growing influence

 of tablets on the sector, it is far too early to say who will ultimately 
succeed.

The only certain losers in this battle will be those brands and businesses 
that don't prioritise mobile as their primary communications channel over the 
next 12-18 months.
