Discount supermarket Aldi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi> has 
recalled some branded biscuits and snacks due to possible “pest contamination”.

The products, made by Baketime, have been withdrawn from sale “on a 
precautionary basis” because of “potential unhygienic manufacturing 
conditions”, the recall notice says, adding: “These products are sold by Aldi, 
Asvina, Booker and LBV.”

Customers have been warned not to eat the products and advised to return them 
to their nearest store.

All batches of the products had been recalled “as they may have been subject 
to pest contamination”. Affected products include Aldi Cheese Thins, Aldi 
Cheese Bakes, Aldi Oddbites and Aldi Ginger Nuts.

A spokeswoman for Aldi said: “We have recalled a number of Aldi-branded 
products that have been manufactured by Baketime and have immediately suspended 
all orders with this supplier while we investigate this matter.

“Customers that have purchased the products listed in our public recall 
notices should return them to their nearest store where they will be offered a 
full refund.”
