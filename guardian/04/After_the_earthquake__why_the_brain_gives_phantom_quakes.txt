Earthquakes <https://www.theguardian.com/world/earthquakes> in Italy have 
devastated ancient towns and left thousands in temporary accommodation. Luckily 
no deaths were reported after the country’s strongest quake in decades struck 
last Sunday, but the psychological effects for those who were there could 
continue for some time.

Aside from aftershocks, anyone caught up in the disaster may also experience 
the uncanny sensation of ‘phantom quakes’, where it feels as if the earth is 
shaking when in fact it is perfectly still. This happens for the same reason as 
‘sea legs’ - the swaying feeling you sometimes get when you walk on dry land 
after time on a boat.

The brain’s balance system keeps us upright by analysing signals sent by the 
ears, eyes, legs and feet and uses this data to predict which way is up. 
Normally, if you make an unpredictable movement, like stepping on something 
that’s lower than you think, your motor cortex quickly adapts as it knows what 
the real world is like. But experiencing an earthquake temporarily shakes these 
assumptions, so a misstep can possibly trigger a mini ‘earthquake’ that is all 
in your mind.
