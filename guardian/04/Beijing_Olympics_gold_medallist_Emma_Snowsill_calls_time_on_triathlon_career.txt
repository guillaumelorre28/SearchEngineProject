Australia's sole Olympic triathlon champion Emma Snowsill has officially 
called time on her storied career.
Snowsill, who won gold at the 2008 Beijing Games, said the decision to retire 
wasn't easy but believed now was the right time to bow out.
"Truthfully, my health has really struggled over the last four years," the 
33-year-old wrote in a post on her website.
"Ultimately my body helped make the decision for me - that it didn't have what 
it needed to compete at the highest level on the world stage anymore.
"I have been a competitor all my life and have loved nothing more than the 
pressure of a big race and representing my country.
"Triathlon has been a huge part of my life and I will in some way always be 
connected to it, however now it feels right to explore life outside of only 
competing."
Snowsill is also a three-time world champion and won Commonwealth Games gold 
in Melbourne in 2006.
She is currently completing an online course in nutrition and will join 
Network Ten as an expert commentator for triathlon at the Glasgow Commonwealth 
Games.
