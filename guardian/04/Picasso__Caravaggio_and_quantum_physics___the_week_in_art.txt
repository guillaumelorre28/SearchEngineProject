Exhibition of the Week

Beyond Caravaggio 
One of those artists who blast his rivals off the walls, Michelangelo Merisi 
da Caravaggio nevertheless inspired a legion of followers in early 17th-century 
Europe. How do their works compare with his?
• National Gallery 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/beyond-caravaggio>, 
London, 12 October-15 January

Also showing

Picasso Portraits
There is a lot to love in this examination of Picasso as a portraitist but it 
is too small to do justice to his epic creativity and too staid to reveal the 
way he revolutionised the human image. Still, it does have his 1910 portrait of 
Kahnweiler, his 1906 Self-Portrait, and some hilarious, bawdy caricatures.
• National Portrait Gallery

 Benvenuto Cellini, The Head of Medusa (about 1545-50) Photograph: V&A 

Half a century before Caravaggio painted the snake-haired monster Medusa’s 
head on a shield, Benvenuto Cellini cast this horrific thing in bronze. This is 
a small trial version that Cellini made as he worked on his most ambitious 
masterpiece, a full-sized statue of Perseus holding Medusa’s head. It is a tiny 
but wondrous object of dread.

filling the space with sounds and furies, grand and small events, stillness and 
movement, noises and light and silence.’
