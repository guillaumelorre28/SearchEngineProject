While my son Ben and I were compiling our 2014 anthology, Poems That Make 
Grown Men Cry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/poetry-book-men-choose-favourite-tear-jerkers>
, we already knew we wanted to follow it up with a sister volume for women. But 
how would the male book fare? Would any publisher be interested in a sequel? 
When it received the warmest of welcomes, even basking awhile in the bestseller 
lists, we knew we had liftoff.

It even seemed logical that, yes, a father-and-son team could co-edit a book 
by women about women for… no, not just women, but anyone to read. Anyone, that 
is, who is interested in the human condition as uniquely observed and distilled 
by poetry.

The male title had been deliberately provocative, if leavened (or so we liked 
to think) by a hint of self-satire. Clearly, it challenged the hoary stereotype 
that grown men don’t cry – or aren’t supposed to – whether in private or in 
public. Its built-in argument was that men should these days be much more open 
about their emotions than in the bygone, stiff-upper-lip days of empire. So we 
were delighted when this proved the main topic of discussion in numerous media 
and festival interviews, apparently finding approving echoes around the nation.

For all my alternative suggestions, Ben insisted that the female title had to 
repeat the same formula. I was more concerned about the currency of the phrase 
“grown women” than the dim, uncomprehending charges of sexism that had in some 
quarters greeted the first book – reeking, to me, of an all too familiar 
sense-of-humour failure.

Somali poet Warsan Shire’s Home strikes a poignant note during Europe’s long, 
agonising refugee crisis

“Good, it’s working!” thought Ben when some female commentators found the 2014 
title at best gimmicky, at worst sexist. When one of our contributors,John Carey
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/30/unexpected-professor-john-carey-enjoyable-ramble-review>
, mentioned our (then forthcoming) book while plugging his own on Radio 4’s
Midweek, the presenter Libby Purves said she would “hurl a book with a title 
like that across the room”.

Reviewing the anthology in the Telegraph, the poet Wendy Cope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/wendy-cope> was also annoyed by its title, 
which “seems to imply that it takes a really special poem to make a man weep, 
whereas women will shed tears over any old rubbish”. My assertion in theObserver
 that we were planning a female version looked, she said, like “a defensive 
move”. If we were really planning such a book, she wrote, she hoped we would 
ask her to be in it. Which, of course, we have; she has chosenTennyson

While I was making approaches for contributions, however, the old stereotypes 
were again turned upside down. Many more women than men told me they didn’t 
weep at anything; I received more polite refusals from eminent women than from 
their male counterparts. The vast majority who did respond, however, have made 
a wonderful variety of choices – far indeed from “any old rubbish” – striking 
notes sometimes interestingly similar to the men’s, sometimes intriguingly 
different. Collectively, they again meet my definition of the aspiration of 
both anthologies: to introduce new readers to the wonders of poetry while 
surprising the cognoscenti with less familiar marvels.

Or, as Ben puts it: “Crying and poetry are, in their different ways, 
articulations of the inexpressible. They are, with music, and ironically in the 
case of poetry, the means by which we humans can explain what we are feeling 
when words fail us. They cut to the quick of our basic condition.

“This project would not only allow us to explore this symmetry but also – we 
hoped – prompt people to read poetry. We wanted to provoke, with the help of 
inspirational contributors, some complex conversations: about freedom of 
expression, literacy, emotion and – of course – gender identity.”

The fundamental truth, of course, is that men and women respond to poetry in 
exactly the same way – as complex human beings. AsSebastian Faulks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/sebastianfaulks> explains in his afterword (
Nadine Gordimer <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/14/nadine-gordimer>
, since you ask, had the last word in the male book): “Poetry speaks to a 
vestigial part of the mind that was more active at the time Homo sapiens was 
becoming what she/he is… When we respond to poetry we engage a part of our 
being that is more primitive and in some way purer than the consciousness 
available minute-by-minute to our busy left-side brain.”

While noting a lack of sentimentality, Faulks finds the range of poems chosen 
“so wide that it’s hard to see patterns or common themes”. That said, he admits 
to crying so much while reading them that “my family thought I was concealing 
some terrible news”.

chose his poems. Photograph: George C Beresford/Getty Images 
It is no surprise that whereas the 100 men chose only 12 poems by female 
poets, the 100 women have picked twice as many by men. Top of the lachrymose 
charts this time around comesEmily Dickinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon>, 
closely followed byElizabeth Bishop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/11/poets-thom-gunn-elizabeth-bishop-colm-toibin>
.Philip Larkin <https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin> led the male 
choices, with five; in the female volume, he merits only one poem (fromMaggie 
Gee <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maggie-gee>). The other two masculine 
favourites,Thomas Hardy <https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomashardy> and AE 
Housman, are conspicuous by their absence.

WB Yeats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/08/wb-yeats-the-art-teacher-and-a-night-at-the-sexologist>
, astonishingly absent from the male volume, is chosen by three women; Tennyson 
andTS Eliot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/10/from-tom-to-ts-eliot-world-poet>
, also missing from the male book, are each selected by two women.Ted Hughes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/tedhughes> and Sylvia Plath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath>, neither of whom moved the men, 
are chosen bySam Taylor-Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-taylor-johnson> and Edna O’Brien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/edna-o-brien> respectively.

Meanwhile, there are some interesting overlaps between the two collections. 
Two playwrights,Tena Stivicic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/07/3-winters-review-croatia-national-theatre-tena-stivicic>
 andDavid Edgar <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidedgar>, both choose

rousing epicThe Masque of Anarchy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jul/08/anarchy-in-peterloo-shelleys-poem-unmasked>

that ofKate Atkinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/04/kate-atkinson-wins-costa-novel-prize-for-a-god-in-ruins>
 and Lynn Barber as well as Simon Winchester. Coleridge’sFrost at Midnight

The Olympic athlete Emma Pooley <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/emmapooley> 
has opted for the same Wilfred Owen poem,Anthem for Doomed Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2008/nov/10/poetry-first-world-war>, 
which moved John Humphrys to tears when we discussed the first book on Radio 4’s

This book also features the same pleasing circularity as its predecessor, with 
a poem by one of our contributors, the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, being the 
choice ofImtiaz Dharker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/17/imtiaz-dharker-queens-gold-medal-poetry>
, whose own poem has been singled out by Meera Syal.

The poets of the first world war again feature prominently, with Wilfred Owen 
chosen by Vanessa Redgrave as he was by Christopher Hitchens,Siegfried Sassoon 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/siegfried-sassoon> by Annie Lennox as by 
Barry Humphries. A little-known first world war poem byAlice Corbin Henderson 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/alice-corbin-henderson> is offered a wider 
audience by Maxine Peake.

Are the women’s choices more political? Suffice it to say, thanks to our 
partnership with Amnesty, we have many contributors with harrowing tales to 
tell, who have since turned their suffering to advantage by campaigning for 
human rights.

This female collection brims with empathy – for human beings, but also for 
animals, birds, even oysters. There are touching examinations of parent-child 
relationships, haunting explorations of depression, mental illness, Aids, 
adoption, miscarriage. Amid nostalgia for a better past, and protest at the 
brutish present – we are still living in a world, as Amnesty’s Nicky Parker 
points out, where women can be put to death for writing poems – there are 
searing accounts of prejudice and persecution alongside passionate pleas for 
freedom. The Somali poetWarsan Shire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/17/warsan-shire-young-poet-laureate-michael-gove>
’sHome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/16/poets-speak-out-for-refugees-> 
strikes an especially poignant note during Europe’s long, agonising refugee 
crisis.

As in the male book, other themes range from intimations of mortality via 
pity, pain and loss to the beauty and variety of nature, as well as love in all 
its many guises – collectively, for me, adding up to a quintessentially poetic 
sense of yearning, often for missed opportunities.

Some choices are almost unbearably intimate: Antonia Fraser and Yoko Ono have 
both chosen the last poem their eminent husbands wrote for them before their 
deaths.Claire Tomalin <https://www.theguardian.com/books/claire-tomalin> has 
proudly made public a heart-rending poem by her 22-year-old daughter 
prefiguring her own death months later.

Just as the book was going to press, we received a handwritten letter from 
Chelsea (born Bradley) Manning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning>, prisoner No 89289 in the 
US disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, apologising for her 
failure to deliver an entry in time.

 Chelsea Manning: unable to deliver her entry due to her prison rights being 
cut. Photograph: AP 
In August 2015, two years into her 35-year jail sentence for whistle-blowing 
on military abuses, Manning’s prison rights were abruptly curtailed for the 
possession in her cell of “prohibited property” such as the autobiography of
Malala Yousafzai <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai> and the 
issue ofVanity Fair featuring a cover story on her fellow transgender woman 
Caitlyn Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-jenner-vanity-fair>
, not to mention a tube of expired toothpaste. She had also wanted to grow out 
her hair.

Instead, she was placed on numerous restrictions, including denial of access 
to the prison library, where she had planned to research her defence against 
these charges as well as her entry for this book. “I really appreciated the 
offer,” she wrote, “and very much wanted to make a contribution. I am very, 
very sorry.”

Manning’s plight is symbolic of so many contributors to both books, as indeed 
of many of the poets represented. Amnesty has underscored this by printing 
bookmarks reading: “Poems That Make Grown Women Cry is emblematic not just of 
the human struggle to make a difference, but of ongoing efforts for gender 
equality. It is a celebration of poetry’s age-old power to kindle aspirations 
to truth, justice and freedom. We want Chelsea to walk free.”

Extract: Home by Warsan Shire – chosen by Sunny Jacobs

you have to understand,
that no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land
no one burns their palms
under trains
beneath carriages
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled
means something more than journey.
no one crawls under fences
no one wants to be beaten
pitied

no one chooses refugee camps
or strip searches where your
body is left aching
or prison,
because prison is safer
than a city of fire
and one prison guard
in the night
is better than a truckload
of men who look like your father
no one could take it
no one could stomach it
no one skin would be tough enough

Warsan Shire is a Somali–British writer and poet. Sunny Jacobs is a campaigner 
who spent 17 years on death row in the US before being exonerated when her 
conviction for murder was overturned
