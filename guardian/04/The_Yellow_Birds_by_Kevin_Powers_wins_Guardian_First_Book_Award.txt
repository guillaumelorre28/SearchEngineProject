Kevin Powers was tonight named the winner of the 2012 Guardian First Book Award
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardianfirstbookaward> at a ceremony in 
London.

His book, The Yellow Birds 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781444756128>
 - published by Sceptre - is a fictional depiction of the psychological impact 
of serving in the Iraq war informed by Powers own experiences of the conflict. 
It captures the desperation and brutality of war, and its after-effects. But it 
is also a story of love, of great courage, and of extraordinary human survival.

The annual award - established in 1999 and now in its 14th year - is open to 
all first-time authors writing in English, or translated into English, across 
all genres, and aims to recognise and reward the finest new writing talent. The 
winner receives a Â£10,000 prize plus an advertising package in the Guardian and 
the Observer.

Kevin Powers, said: "I'm honored that the Guardian has chosen to recognize The 
Yellow Birds with this year's First Book Award. Thank you for considering it 
and for including it with such an extraordinary and diverse group of finalists."

Lisa Allardice, editor of the Guardian Review and chair of judges, said: 
"Drawing on Kevin Powers' experience serving as a soldier in Iraq, The Yellow 
Birds is a powerful meditation on war and mortality. Its subject matter is ugly 
and harrowing, but its expression is beautiful and poetic. It is a triumphant, 
unforgettable first novel."

Lisa Allardice featured on a judging panel that also included: William 
Dalrymple, author; Ahdaf Soueif, author; Kate Summerscale, author; Katharine 
Viner, deputy editor, the Guardian; Jeanette Winterson, author and Stuart 
Broom, events co-ordinator, Waterstones.

Previous winners of the Guardian First Book Award include Zadie Smith, 
Jonathan Safran Foer and Alex Ross. Last year's winner was Siddhartha Mukherjee 
for his book The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer.
