Insurance firm Amlin <https://www.theguardian.com/business/amlin> has returned 
profit after suffering crushing losses last year, sending shares up nearly 5%.

The company saw pretax profits soar to £184.5m in the six months to June 30 
thanks to far fewer natural disasters compared with a year ago.

In 2011 the Japanese tsunami, New Zealand earthquake and flooding in Thailand 
left the Lloyds of London insurer with a pretax loss of £194m.

The company which specialises in commercial insurance and reinsurance saw 
renewal rates increase due to the high number of disasters last year, up 9.6% 
in the US and 16.2% in the rest of the world.

The interim dividend has also risen 4.2% to 7.5p a share.

Chief executive Charles Philipps said:
 This is a welcome return to profit and the strength of our underwriting 
result underlines the quality and diversity of our business. The improving 
trading environment is creating many opportunities for profitable growth, for 
which we have both the capital and the underwriting capability to take 
advantage. 
Global insurers suffered losses of $116 billion in 2011 after a slew of 
natural disasters leading to a surge in claims.

Shares are up 18.5p, 4.9%, at 399.6p as the results beat analysts' 
expectations.
