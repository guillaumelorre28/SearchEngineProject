 Hernan Ramirez Rurange, 76, was sentenced along with 13 other ex-army 
officers on Tuesday for planning the murder of Eugenio Berrios, whose body was 
found on a Uruguayan beach in 1995.

 Berrios’ death was part of a scheme by Pinochet operatives to obstruct human 
rights investigations into the dictator’s 1973-1990 regime, according to the 
court.

The Chilean government said on Thursday that Ramirez Rurange died of a gunshot 
wound to the head at his home in an upscale Santiago neighborhood, but did not 
provide further details.

 Local media reported that the former general killed himself. He was set to 
begin his sentence within days.

 Berrios oversaw the production of sarin gas and other chemicals for 
Pinochet’s government, and long faced allegations that he helped poison a 
popular Chilean politician in 1982.

 Some 25 years since Pinochet left power, human rights abuse cases dating from 
the dictatorship era are still moving through the Chilean courts or coming to 
light for the first time.

 Ramirez Rurange’s death comes just days after Manuel Contreras, the head of 
Pinochet’s feared secret police,died of natural causes
