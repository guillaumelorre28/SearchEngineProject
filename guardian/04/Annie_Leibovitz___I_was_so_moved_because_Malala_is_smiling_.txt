Arguably America’s foremost portrait photographer, Annie Leibovitz’s new 
exhibition, Women: New Portraits, which opened in San Francisco on Tuesday, is 
dedicated to pictures of women who are currently in the news – and the 
photographer’s mind. It includes images of Amy Schumer and her sister Kim 
Caramele, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook executive and author of Lean In, and a 
previously unpublished image of Caitlyn Jenner from the shoot Leibowitz did for 
Vanity Fair,which caused a sensation last year

. Leibovitz said: “I feel unbelievably blessed that I have had the opportunity 
to photograph Malala in her classroom in Birmingham. She was shot by the 
Taliban, and almost didn’t survive. She was taken to Birmingham, where they 
saved her life, and she ended up going to school there. She was a very 
important person for me to add to the show. I was so moved because Malala is 
smiling.”

 * Women: New Portraits is at The Presidio’s Crissy Field, San Francisco.
