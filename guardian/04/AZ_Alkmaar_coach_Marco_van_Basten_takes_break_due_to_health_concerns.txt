Marco van Basten is to take a break from coaching AZ Alkmaar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/azalkmaar> due to health concerns, the 
Eredivisie club has announced.

Van Basten, 49, missed his team’s 3-1 win at Dordecht on Saturday, and the 
club have now said he will remain absent until 14 September.

“Health comes first and as a club we take our responsibility seriously,” said 
the club’s director of football, Earnest Stewart. “On the advice of our club 
doctor and in consultation with Marco we have decided rest would aid his 
recovery. Football is very important but good health is more important than 
that.”

No details have been released regarding the condition of the former Holland 
international, but Dutch media reported that he has suffered from 
stress-related heart palpitations.

Alex Pastoor and Dennis Haar will take charge of the side for a friendly match 
against the Belgian side Mechelen and a league match against Heerenveen after 
the international break.
