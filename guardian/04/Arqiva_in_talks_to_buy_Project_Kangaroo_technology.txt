Arqiva, the broadcast transmission company, is in advanced discussions to buy 
the technology behindProject Kangaroo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/kangaroo>, the defunct broadband TV joint 
venture between the ITV, Channel 4 and the BBC.

The company was named as a contender by the website C21 in May after 
MediaGuardian.co.uk first revealed in April that the only serious suitors to 
buy the remnants of Kangaroo were Orange and an unnamed technology company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/06/orange-project-kangaroo>.

Discussions with Arqiva are understood to have progressed to an advanced 
stage, although a final deal is yet to be signed.Orange pulled out of the 
process in May.

Project Kangaroo has cost its partners in excess of £30m and the remaining 
assets are now likely to be snapped up for just a few million pounds.

The joint venture partners have been looking to sell the assets of Project 
Kangaroo, primarily the technology behind its video-on-demand service, 
following a decision by the Competition Commission in February toblock the 
venture because of concerns it would dominate the nascent UK broadband TV market

.

Last week BBC Worldwide revealed in its annual report that Kangaroo had cost 
it £9.1m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/14/bbc-worldwide-profits-slump>. In 
March, ITV estimated that its costs relating to Kangaroo would ultimately be 
£12m.

ITV is in the process of selling Friends Reunited and Freeview multiplex 
business SDN; analysts have valued the social networking website atbetween £20m 
and £50m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/16/friends-reunited-worth-20m> and 
SDN atbetween £150m and £200m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/23/itv-freeview-digital-television-sdn>
.

The joint venture partners refused to comment on the status of the sale of 
Kangaroo's assets.

Last month the Office of Fair Trading accepted the undertakings from 
Kangaroo's partners relating to what venture may, or may not, be permissible 
between them over the next five years

.

The broadcasters agreed that they will not acquire control of any others' 
video-on-demand activities. Directors or managers will also be prohibited from 
taking any directorship or managerial position that would give them control of 
their former partners' video-on-demand services.
