Sudan reached the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> for the first time in 
42 years with a 2-1 defeat of Burkina Faso, that edged them above Angola in the 
Group B table on goal difference.

Mudather Eltaib scored both Sudan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sudan> 
goals to deliver the nation's biggest sporting moment since it won the cup on 
home soil in 1970. It was also Sudan's first win at the tournament since that 
triumph.

Eltaib broke clear to beat the Burkina Faso 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso> goalkeeper, Daouda Diakité, 
in the 33rd minute and then punished a mistake by the keeper in the second half 
to carry Sudan through, despite a 97th-minute goal from the Burkinabés.

Sudan will play Zambia in the last eight; Ivory Coast meet the co-hosts, 
Equatorial Guinea.
