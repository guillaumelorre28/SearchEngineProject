Thank you for following our live coverage of Anzac day 2016. To recap:

 * Tens of thousands of people have woken up early to attend dawn services in 
Australia, New Zealand and Turkey. 
 * Crowds in most major cities were reportedly lower than usual, particularly 
in Europe amid terrorism fears and heightened security. 
 *  A 16-year-old Sydney boy arrested on terrorism-related charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/25/sydney-boy-16-charged-with-terrorism-offences-linked-to-anzac-day>
 has faced court today. NSW Joint Counter Terrorism officers raided the boy’s 
home in Auburn on Sunday afternoon and have charged him with one offence 
relating to an alleged terrorist plot linked toAnzac Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day>. 

 * About 500 people have gathered at The Block in Redfern, Sydney, for the 
10th Coloured DiggerAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> 
march. 
 * Former SBS journalist Scott McIntyre has been tweeting 
<https://twitter.com/mcintinhos?lang=en> about alleged Anzac crimes including 
murder and gang rape by Australian troops, after losing his job for similar 
tweets posted on Anzac Day last year.

Tenth year of the Coloured Digger march

Elle Hunt

It’s the 10th year of the Coloured Digger march, the hundreds
gathered in Redfern Park are told by Babana Aboriginal Men’s Group chairman 
Mark Spinks before the wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph. 

A welcome to country acknowledges that we’re gathered on Gadigal land
and then it’s on with the service, with wreaths laid by MPs Tanya Plibersek, 
Daryl Maguire, Linda Burney, Jenny Leong of the NSW Greens and Sydney mayor 
Clover Moore, as well as representatives from the Turkish embassy, New Zealand, 
the army, Indigenous youth, the air force and the Social Justice Commission, 
among others.

Pastor Ray Minniecon leads the Prayer of Remembrance for “those who gave their 
lives and are lost from us, whose brave spirit lies in foreign soils”.

The service is to commemorate those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people who have served in the Australian military.

It is “very difficult” to give an accurate account of how many served in the 
first world war, saysMajor Joe West from the stage, but it’s thought to be 
between 500 and 600.

“Why did they join?” asks the program handed out to those taking part in the 
march. “At the time of WW1, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were not 
officially classed as citizens of Australia.

“Under the Protectors’ Act, they could not enter a public bar, vote, marry 
non-Aboriginal partners or buy property. They would have been like every other 
adventurous young Australian male, wanting to go out and see the world, get 
paid really good money, see some action and ‘be home before Christmas’.”

But when they eventually returned to Australia, they were
“second-class citizens”, says  West, their contribution and
service reduced to footnotes in war histories. This injustice went on to fuel 
the Aboriginal rights movement of the 1930s.

Former SBS sports reporter Scott McIntyre, who was sacked by the broadcaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/26/sbs-sports-reporter-scott-mcintyre-sacked-over-direspectful-anzac-tweets>
 last year after he questioned the Anzac legend and the jingoism associated 
with Anzac celebrations, has tweeted today about alleged Anzac crimes.

McIntyre sued SBS for wrongful dismissal and refused to apologise and delete 
the 2015 tweets, which included references to “widespread rape and theft 
committed by these ‘brave’ Anzacs”.

SBS and McIntyre were set to head to the federal court earlier this month 
after McIntyre sued for wrongful dismissal, but the parties ultimatelyreached a 
settlement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/11/sbs-reporter-scott-mcintyre-resolves-dispute-over-anzac-day-tweets>
.

On Monday, McIntyre continued from where he left off last year, accusing Anzac 
soldiers of rape, murder and abuse.

 that internationally persecuted Muslims have attended dawn services to honour 
the Anzac diggers who secured Australia’s freedom. He writes:

 Members of a Muslim movement persecuted abroad say they’re thankful to Anzac 
diggers for helping create an Australia that honours and upholds the freedom 
and rights of its people.


Dozens of members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community turned out at Anzac Day 
dawn services in Sydney to honour soldiers killed in world war pme in defence 
of Australia.

Sydney coordinator Tariq Ahmad said the Ahmadis, who face discrimination and 
systematic persecution by other Muslims worldwide, wanted to show their 
gratitude for the freedom Australia has afforded them.

The publisher and editor of New Matilda, Chris Graham, has written a very 
different take onAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> in his 
piece titled: “Anzac Day: We’ve Already Said Thanks, It’s Time To Move On”.

Aboriginal people got one national apology, he writes, while Anzacs have had 
more than one hundred thank yous. He continues:

 At the outset, I should say that my Grandfather fought in the Second World 
War. He did so to protect the liberties and freedoms that I enjoy today. I’m 
grateful for that.


But I think the sense of gratefulness which motivated the establishment of 
Anzac Day all those years back ought not to be as intense today, and that’s why 
I think it’s time to move on.

The Great War was 100 years ago. How many times do we have to say thank you?

I can understand why Anzac Day was established. But I think a lot has changed 
for the better since then.

We’ve had the 100-year commemorations of the landing at Gallipoli. We’ve had 
the historic apology to Vietnam Veterans who were treated so appallingly on 
their return,one of the genuine achievements 
<http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1717660.htm> of John Howard as Prime 
Minister.

I think our returned servicemen and women can be very proud of the respect in 
which they are held by every Australian, and so I think it probably is time to 
move on.

Leaving a trail of eucalyptus smoke behind it from The Block, the Coloured 
Digger march has arrived at Redfern Park. The contingent of ex-servicemen 
decked out in medals were met with applause from pedestrians and street-side 
cafe diners as they crossed the square.

There’s a stage set up by the war memorial with the seats closest to it 
reserved for elders and those in uniform, as families – plenty with young 
children – find a spot nearby on the grass. It’s a beautiful sunny afternoon, 
and no one seems to be in any rush to get the formal proceedings underway.

About 500 people have gathered at the Block in Redfern, Sydney, for the 
Coloured DiggerAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> march 
this afternoon.

The procession to Redfern Park, led by two mounted police and a group of 
aboriginal Australians burning eucalyptus, playing didgeridoo, and displaying 
both flags, is in recognition of the role played by Indigenous men and 
servicewomen in the war.

Elders, groups holding placards “Honouring our unknown warrior” and “Honour * 
Recognition * Respect”, and men and
women in uniform hold prominent places in the march down Redfern St. 

A ceremony will be held in Redfern Park, culminating with a wreath laying.

Business Insider has provided a handy guide 
<http://www.businessinsider.com.au/mathematics-of-two-up-2016-4> to the 
mathematics of two-up, not that it will help increase your odds of a win.

The Australian-invented gambling game is illegal, except for on Anzac Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> in New South Wales and Victoria.

Insider reports:

There’s no way to “win” at two-up but there is one approach to ensure you don’t
lose your money. You need to be prepared to keep doubling down on your bets, 
however, and that could clean you out if you’ve got a limit.

If you lose $5 in the first round, double your bet in the next round to $10. 
If you lose that, double your bet again to $20, and so on, until you win back 
everything (risky, of course, when you need to pair up with someone who also 
wants to meet your bet of $80 or more.) But when you are square, return again 
to your $5 bet and if you win, only bet $5 again.

The mathematics can get more complicated when you factor in “odds” 
<http://wizardofodds.com/games/two-up/> – a toss of one head and one tail five 
times in a row. But if you’re just enjoying the game, remember the odds are one 
in two on every throw.

Come in spinner. Enjoy the day.

Fairfax reporter Lloyd Jones reports that 
<http://www.smh.com.au/world/anzac-day-gallipoli-crowds-endure-fierce-storm-ahead-of-dawn-service-20160425-goe66f.html>
 hundreds of Australians and New Zealanders slept out at the tightly-secured 
Anzac commemorative site at Gallipoli to await the dawn service, which is 
currently underway.

Jones writes:

Tucked into sleeping bags in front of the main stage at North Beach, they have 
been serenaded by a military band in between documentaries about the Gallipoli 
campaign shown on big screens.

At one point on Sunday evening many scrambled for cover as a fierce storm 
swept through, delivering rain, thunder and lightning.


Most people sheltered in the large security tent until the storm passed.


This year security has been stepped up with airport-style screening process in 
that tent, while armed Turkish police and soldiers stand guard at checkpoints 
into the Gallipoli sites.


The boosted security follows recent terror attacks in Turkey, at least two 
targeting tourists in Istanbul.

After a large attendance at last year’s centenary service, numbers are down 
this year, in part also because of heightened travel warnings for Turkey from 
the Australian and New Zealand governments.

Thank you for following our live coverage of Anzac day 2016. To recap:

 * Tens of thousands of people have woken up early to attend dawn services in 
Australia, New Zealand and Turkey. 
 * Crowds in most major cities were reportedly lower than usual, particularly 
in Europe amid terrorism fears and heightened security. 
 *  A 16-year-old Sydney boy arrested on terrorism-related charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/25/sydney-boy-16-charged-with-terrorism-offences-linked-to-anzac-day>
 has faced court today. NSW Joint Counter Terrorism officers raided the boy’s 
home in Auburn on Sunday afternoon and have charged him with one offence 
relating to an alleged terrorist plot linked toAnzac Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day>. 

 * About 500 people have gathered at The Block in Redfern, Sydney, for the 
10th Coloured DiggerAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> 
march. 
 * Former SBS journalist Scott McIntyre has been tweeting 
<https://twitter.com/mcintinhos?lang=en> about alleged Anzac crimes including 
murder and gang rape by Australian troops, after losing his job for similar 
tweets posted on Anzac Day last year.  
It’s the 10th year of the Coloured Digger march, the hundreds
gathered in Redfern Park are told by Babana Aboriginal Men’s Group chairman 
Mark Spinks before the wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph. 

A welcome to country acknowledges that we’re gathered on Gadigal land
and then it’s on with the service, with wreaths laid by MPs Tanya Plibersek, 
Daryl Maguire, Linda Burney, Jenny Leong of the NSW Greens and Sydney mayor 
Clover Moore, as well as representatives from the Turkish embassy, New Zealand, 
the army, Indigenous youth, the air force and the Social Justice Commission, 
among others.

Pastor Ray Minniecon leads the Prayer of Remembrance for “those who gave their 
lives and are lost from us, whose brave spirit lies in foreign soils”.

The service is to commemorate those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people who have served in the Australian military.

It is “very difficult” to give an accurate account of how many served in the 
first world war, saysMajor Joe West from the stage, but it’s thought to be 
between 500 and 600.

“Why did they join?” asks the program handed out to those taking part in the 
march. “At the time of WW1, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were not 
officially classed as citizens of Australia.

“Under the Protectors’ Act, they could not enter a public bar, vote, marry 
non-Aboriginal partners or buy property. They would have been like every other 
adventurous young Australian male, wanting to go out and see the world, get 
paid really good money, see some action and ‘be home before Christmas’.”

But when they eventually returned to Australia, they were
“second-class citizens”, says  West, their contribution and
service reduced to footnotes in war histories. This injustice went on to fuel 
the Aboriginal rights movement of the 1930s.
 
Former SBS sports reporter Scott McIntyre, who was sacked by the broadcaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/26/sbs-sports-reporter-scott-mcintyre-sacked-over-direspectful-anzac-tweets>
 last year after he questioned the Anzac legend and the jingoism associated 
with Anzac celebrations, has tweeted today about alleged Anzac crimes.

McIntyre sued SBS for wrongful dismissal and refused to apologise and delete 
the 2015 tweets, which included references to “widespread rape and theft 
committed by these ‘brave’ Anzacs”.

SBS and McIntyre were set to head to the federal court earlier this month 
after McIntyre sued for wrongful dismissal, but the parties ultimatelyreached a 
settlement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/11/sbs-reporter-scott-mcintyre-resolves-dispute-over-anzac-day-tweets>
.

On Monday, McIntyre continued from where he left off last year, accusing Anzac 
soldiers of rape, murder and abuse.

 that internationally persecuted Muslims have attended dawn services to honour 
the Anzac diggers who secured Australia’s freedom. He writes:

 Members of a Muslim movement persecuted abroad say they’re thankful to Anzac 
diggers for helping create an Australia that honours and upholds the freedom 
and rights of its people.


Dozens of members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community turned out at Anzac Day 
dawn services in Sydney to honour soldiers killed in world war pme in defence 
of Australia.

Sydney coordinator Tariq Ahmad said the Ahmadis, who face discrimination and 
systematic persecution by other Muslims worldwide, wanted to show their 
gratitude for the freedom Australia has afforded them.

The publisher and editor of New Matilda, Chris Graham, has written a very 
different take onAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> in his 
piece titled: “Anzac Day: We’ve Already Said Thanks, It’s Time To Move On”.

Aboriginal people got one national apology, he writes, while Anzacs have had 
more than one hundred thank yous. He continues:

 At the outset, I should say that my Grandfather fought in the Second World 
War. He did so to protect the liberties and freedoms that I enjoy today. I’m 
grateful for that.


But I think the sense of gratefulness which motivated the establishment of 
Anzac Day all those years back ought not to be as intense today, and that’s why 
I think it’s time to move on.

The Great War was 100 years ago. How many times do we have to say thank you?

I can understand why Anzac Day was established. But I think a lot has changed 
for the better since then.

We’ve had the 100-year commemorations of the landing at Gallipoli. We’ve had 
the historic apology to Vietnam Veterans who were treated so appallingly on 
their return,one of the genuine achievements 
<http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1717660.htm> of John Howard as Prime 
Minister.

I think our returned servicemen and women can be very proud of the respect in 
which they are held by every Australian, and so I think it probably is time to 
move on.

Leaving a trail of eucalyptus smoke behind it from The Block, the Coloured 
Digger march has arrived at Redfern Park. The contingent of ex-servicemen 
decked out in medals were met with applause from pedestrians and street-side 
cafe diners as they crossed the square.

There’s a stage set up by the war memorial with the seats closest to it 
reserved for elders and those in uniform, as families – plenty with young 
children – find a spot nearby on the grass. It’s a beautiful sunny afternoon, 
and no one seems to be in any rush to get the formal proceedings underway.

About 500 people have gathered at the Block in Redfern, Sydney, for the 
Coloured DiggerAnzac Day <https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> march 
this afternoon.

The procession to Redfern Park, led by two mounted police and a group of 
aboriginal Australians burning eucalyptus, playing didgeridoo, and displaying 
both flags, is in recognition of the role played by Indigenous men and 
servicewomen in the war.

Elders, groups holding placards “Honouring our unknown warrior” and “Honour * 
Recognition * Respect”, and men and
women in uniform hold prominent places in the march down Redfern St. 

A ceremony will be held in Redfern Park, culminating with a wreath laying.

Business Insider has provided a handy guide 
<http://www.businessinsider.com.au/mathematics-of-two-up-2016-4> to the 
mathematics of two-up, not that it will help increase your odds of a win.

The Australian-invented gambling game is illegal, except for on Anzac Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/anzac-day> in New South Wales and Victoria.

Insider reports:

There’s no way to “win” at two-up but there is one approach to ensure you don’t
lose your money. You need to be prepared to keep doubling down on your bets, 
however, and that could clean you out if you’ve got a limit.

If you lose $5 in the first round, double your bet in the next round to $10. 
If you lose that, double your bet again to $20, and so on, until you win back 
everything (risky, of course, when you need to pair up with someone who also 
wants to meet your bet of $80 or more.) But when you are square, return again 
to your $5 bet and if you win, only bet $5 again.

The mathematics can get more complicated when you factor in “odds” 
<http://wizardofodds.com/games/two-up/> – a toss of one head and one tail five 
times in a row. But if you’re just enjoying the game, remember the odds are one 
in two on every throw.

Come in spinner. Enjoy the day.

Fairfax reporter Lloyd Jones reports that 
<http://www.smh.com.au/world/anzac-day-gallipoli-crowds-endure-fierce-storm-ahead-of-dawn-service-20160425-goe66f.html>
 hundreds of Australians and New Zealanders slept out at the tightly-secured 
Anzac commemorative site at Gallipoli to await the dawn service, which is 
currently underway.

Jones writes:

Tucked into sleeping bags in front of the main stage at North Beach, they have 
been serenaded by a military band in between documentaries about the Gallipoli 
campaign shown on big screens.

At one point on Sunday evening many scrambled for cover as a fierce storm 
swept through, delivering rain, thunder and lightning.


Most people sheltered in the large security tent until the storm passed.


This year security has been stepped up with airport-style screening process in 
that tent, while armed Turkish police and soldiers stand guard at checkpoints 
into the Gallipoli sites.


The boosted security follows recent terror attacks in Turkey, at least two 
targeting tourists in Istanbul.

After a large attendance at last year’s centenary service, numbers are down 
this year, in part also because of heightened travel warnings for Turkey from 
the Australian and New Zealand governments.
