Exhibition of the week

Fergal Stapleton
In Sheridan Le Fanu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/28/google-doodle-gothic-horror-irish-author-sheridan-le-fanu>
’s ghost story Schalcken the Painter, a 17th-century Dutch artist meets an 
undead corpse; the chiaroscuro, bloody tints, eerie phantoms and spectral 
lights in Stapleton’s new paintings mix old master echoes with a slice of 
gothic horror as if they were painted by Schalcken himself. Quotations from 
Rembrandt are seen through a glass, very darkly. It may have opened a bit late 
for Halloween, but this will spook up your winter nicely.

 Impasse, by Susan Burnstine 
A ghostly figure is seen advancing – or departing – in Susan Burnstine’s 
photograph, taken on her uniquely customised camera. She suffers from night 
terrors, and uses her photography to tackle them. “My mother, who was a 
musician and artist, suggested I draw, paint or sculpt my dreams to understand 
them,”she told Edward Siddons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/03/susan-burnstine-best-photograph-black-and-white>
. “She taught me to articulate them in a positive light and, in the process, 
free myself from their power. And that’s why I shoot: to create beauty out of 
trauma.”
