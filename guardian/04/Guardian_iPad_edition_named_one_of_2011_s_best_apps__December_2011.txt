The Guardian iPad edition has been named as one of Apple's best apps of 2011. 

In their annual 'App Rewind' list - which showcases the best and most popular 
apps from the last 12 months - the Guardian's iPad edition was highlighted as 
one of the top 5 Newsstand apps.

The Guardian iPad edition and Apple's new iOS 5 Newsstand feature launched at 
the same time in October this year. Newsstand allows consumers to find digital 
newspaper and magazine products in one dedicated place on the App Store, and 
organise them in one easy-to-organise bookshelf.
