Adam Carroll dominated from pole position in the A1GP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/a1gp> feature race in Malaysia to put Team 
Ireland into a clear championship lead.

In the third round of the season, Carroll mastered the Sepang circuit to win 
by a significant 16-second margin over Portugal's Filipe Albuquerque, setting 
the race's fastest lap on the way. The only team to score more than one victory 
in the season to date, Team Ireland now hold an eight-point championship lead 
over Team Portugal as the series breaks for Christmas.

"We were starting from pole position and I just concentrated on getting a good 
start, which allowed me to control the race from there," said Carroll. "It's 
all team work though, it doesn't just come down to one person as everybody 
works extremely hard. It's been hard for the guys to be out here since Tuesday 
at the circuit in this heat and humidity, but they practiced pit stops every 
night to make sure they did a good job.

"We planned to come here and try and come away leading the championship and we 
have. Winning the race is just a good bonus and I'm going to fight hard to keep 
it."

Marco Andretti claimed the final podium position for Team USA, as local hero 
Fairuz Fauzy, who was set for third place, came in too early for his pit stop 
and dropped down the order.

Team GB's Danny Watts started from the front row of the grid but was 
classified last of the runners after losing his nose in an accident and being 
forced to take a long stop for repairs.

Victory in the sprint race went to Team Switzerland's Neel Jani, ahead of Team 
France's Loic Duval and Team New Zealand's Earl Bamber.
