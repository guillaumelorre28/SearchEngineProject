Serves two
Beat five eggs with a splash of milk or cream and a little salt and pepper. 
Mash a ripe avocado, season and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Throw in a 
handful of crumbled tangy cheese such as goat’s or feta; stir once. Toast and 
butter four slices of good-quality bread, and keep warm. Melt a knob of butter 
in a pan, add the eggs and cook, stirring, over medium-high heat so they 
scramble fairly fast. (This keeps them fluffy; for a creamier texture, go lower 
and slower.) Take off heat just before the eggs are done to your liking – 
they’ll carry on cooking in the residual heat. Divide the avocado and cheese 
mix between the toast and top with the egg, a pinch of chilli flakes and more 
black pepper.
