Cameroon reached the African Nations Cup final for the first time in 18 years 
by scoring three second-half goals last night.

They made the breakthrough three minutes after the interval when a long throw 
from the right created panic in the Tunisian penalty area, allowing Mboma to 
blast the ball in from close range.

As Tunisian efforts to equalise became more desperate, Real Madrid teenager 
Samuel Oto'o doubled the Indomitable Lions' lead in the 83rd minute. Mboma, 
leading a counterattack, threaded a pass through to Oto'o, who expertly lifted 
the ball over Chokri El Ouaer.

Mboma finished off the job two minutes from time, when he broke away down the 
right and shot from a tight angle.

Mboma missed his best chance of the match. Just before half-time, after El 
Ouaer blocked an Oto'o shot, the big striker blasted the ball wide of an 
unguarded net.

Tunisia's best chance came midway through the first half, when Meher Kanzari's 
shot from the edge of the area was well saved by Boukar Alioum.
