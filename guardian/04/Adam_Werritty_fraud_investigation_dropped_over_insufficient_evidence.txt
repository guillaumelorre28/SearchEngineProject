The City of London police have dropped their year-long investigation into 
whetherAdam Werritty <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/adam-werritty> committed 
fraud by posing as Liam Fox's official adviser.

Fox resigned as defence secretary last year following revelations surrounding 
his close working relationship with Werritty, who was not an official adviser, 
did not have security clearance and allegedly accepted donations as part of his 
role. The police said the case against Werritty had been dropped after the 
Crown Prosecution Service advised that there was insufficient evidence to 
justify criminal charges.

A spokesman for the CPS said there was not enough evidence to prove that 
Werritty had acted fraudulently by handing out business cards that falsely 
described him as "adviser to the Rt Hon DrLiam Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox> MP".

The CPS added that there was also insufficient evidence that Werritty had 
"fraudulently used donations to his company because he had used those funds 
within the parameters he had explained to the donors".

Fox quit the cabinet last October after he was found to have breached the 
ministerial code, following revelations that Werritty had visited Fox at the 
Ministry of Defence 22 times in 18 months and used his quasi-official role to 
meet a string of world leaders.

In his resignation speech, Fox admitted he had allowed his parliamentary 
duties and private relationship to become "blurred" over his links to Werritty, 
his close friend of 14 years.

The police launched the investigation last year following a complaint by 
Labour MP John Mann.
