Argentina says it has agreed with Britain to discuss exhuming and identifying 
Argentinians who were buried in theFalklands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/falklands> after being killed in the 1982 war 
over the islands.

Argentina’s foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, said on Tuesday that the two 
governments planned to meet in mid-December in Geneva along with 
representatives of the Red Cross.

“The meeting will define a protocol for the exhumations” of 123 Argentinian 
soldiers buried in a cemetery on East Falkland Island, known in Spanish as Isla 
Soledad, she said.

Red Cross personnel have visited the site in the South Atlantic and carried 
out a preliminary evaluation, she said.

Malcorra said her country has asked that an Argentinian forensic science 
expert be allowed to join in the Red Cross’s preliminary investigations.

Families of Argentinian troops killed in the conflict have long demanded that 
their loved ones be identified.

Britain and Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> fought a 
brief war over the islands, known as Las Malvinas in Spanish, in 1982 after 
Argentinian forces occupied them.

The conflict killed 649 Argentinian soldiers, 255 British soldiers and three 
islanders.

Argentina argues it inherited the windswept islands from Spain when it gained 
independence in the 19th century.

But Britain says it has historically ruled them and that the 3,000 islanders 
have the right to self-determination.

In a 2013 referendum, residents voted overwhelmingly to remain part of Britain.

After years of testy relations under former leftist governments, Argentina has 
pursued acautious rapprochement with Britain under the current president, 
Mauricio Macri

.

The countries agreed a series of deals in September covering oil, fishing, 
navigation and trade in and around the islands.
