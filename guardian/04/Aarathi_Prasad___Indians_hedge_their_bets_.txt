diverse treatments on offer in the country’s cities and rural communities, and 
the future of Indian healthcare.

In India there are two broad approaches to medicine: conventional “western” 
medicine and traditional practices, which go under the banner of Ayush. What 
are these practices?
There are several systems of medicine that the state sanctions for use. One of 
them isayurveda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/22/healthandwellbeing.health2>
, which is a very old system [with medicines often based on herbs, minerals and 
metals] indigenous to India, and then there is also yoga. Siddha is similar to 
ayurveda but the texts are different and come from a different part of India. 
There is unani, which is originally from the Greek hippocratic system of 
medicine that came to India with Arab scholars. Then there are naturopathy and 
homeopathy, which are European in origin. Any of these things, you can go to a 
government-funded facility to use.

Because India is so pluralistic, most people are willing to accept more than 
one thing on an equal footing
Aarathi Prasad 
Your grandfather practised ayurveda, and was involved in pushing for 
integration with western medicine after independence. Was that the motivation 
for your book?
My mother would tell me about him and his work, and at home if I cut my finger 
we’d go to the kitchen and put turmeric on it. So culturally it was very strong 
in my upbringing. But I didn’t know that he had pushed for integrated medicine. 
That was all new to me. WhenIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> was 
a British colony, the study of traditional forms of medicine as medicine was 
banned. So what do you do when the colonists leave? Do you choose to use the 
medicine that the colonisers brought or do you go back to what was considered 
medicine before?

There’s an argument that if a herbal remedy, such as those of ayurveda, has an 
effect on the body, the chemicals responsible should be identified and 
extracted so it can be regulated and dosed correctly. How does that fit with 
the views you encountered?
That’s exactly what many of the people I talked to, and the government, are 
trying to do – that is, use the best of both. There is the example of a South 
American plant: tribal people say “the fruit is very nutritious but we also use 
it for infertility.” And so the ayurvedic gatherers take it back to the lab and 
look for active ingredients in it. It’s very much like the drug discovery 
process, but a little less random because scientists are trying to understand 
the cultural context in which people are already using the plant, and whether 
they feel it is working. It is anecdote, but anecdote is a form of evidence.

Is there any resistance? 
Yes. A lot of westen doctors say, “Keep your knowledge”, while some ayurvedic 
doctors say, “You are not doing ayurveda properly”. Ayurveda has become like 
any other medical system where you go to university for a few years, you study 
a range of subjects, a lot of them western medical subjects. There is friction 
but I think the future is using the best of both worlds.

In this push for integration is there not a danger of fuelling 
pseudo-scientific research? One idea is to use modern genetic techniques to 
investigate “imbalances” in the body’s “humours”, for example…
Ayurvedic research institutes even have a word for it: ayurgenomics 
<https://www.igib.res.in/?q=ayurgenomics>. It’s similar to the hippocratic idea 
of the four humours. In ayurveda there are three, but the idea is the same, 
that disease comes from imbalance. People have a predominance of one type of 
“humour” over another and they are looking at whether those categorisations can 
be linked to what your genetic sequences look like.

You are a geneticist – is this a runner?
No, absolutely not. Chemical analysis is interesting and so is drug 
development but the genomics thing is bizarre.

Would you visit an ayurvedic practitioner?
Personally I wouldn’t, but I would do yoga. I think there is a lot on the 
system of nutrition that makes a lot of sense. People go to alternatives when 
modern medicine doesn’t have an answer – they see a lot of parents of autistic 
kids coming in.

You describe an encounter with someone who said they had prayed to a goddess 
and their wife was cured of TB. How do you respond to statements like that?
They don’t have any other explanation. It’s something really interesting about 
India. Because it is so pluralistic on so many levels, most people are willing 
to accept more than one thing on an equal footing. So [they’d say]: “Maybe it 
was the goddess, maybe it was the medicines, we are not sure – but does it even 
matter because she is better now?”

Many of the initiatives to provide access to good healthcare seem to come from 
determined individuals and philanthropic organisations rather than the 
government. Does that frustrate you?
Yes, it is predominantly people’s own [efforts] – they have spotted a problem 
and made sacrifices or used their own money or got family money or started an 
initiative themselves. The government seems to be working for the public 
through supporting private hospitals but the money never filters back into the 
public system and so the government hospitals are dire and oversubscribed. The 
percentage of GDP going into healthcare is appallingly low, and while I was 
writing the book it dropped further.

One of the more dramatic folk remedies in the book involves swallowing live 
fish – tell me about that.
It is a cure for asthma – obviously! When I first looked at [the 
practitioners’] website, I couldn’t believe it – it was almost state-sponsored 
and sounded completely bonkers. They make a secret herbal formulation, they get 
live fish about the length of your finger and they stuff the herbs into its 
mouth and put the fish down your throat. The other bizarre thing is that it has 
be on a particular day every year at a certain time. I thought, these people 
are charlatans – this is ridiculous.

Homeopathy won’t cure you – unless you have a little faith

Did meeting them change your view?
I was surprised actually because they’re a really nice family and they’re 
doing this charitably. Something like 70-80,000 people come. The state actually 
gives a stadium over to this and the ministry of fisheries keep aside the fish 
for them. They are not trained as ayurvedic doctors. The point is, for a lot of 
people who are poor, if they see that a doctor will do something for free, they 
turn up. There’s a lot of opposition – people say this needs to be tested and 
question the government supporting it. It is the same for homeopathy: the 
government supports homeopathy and there is no evidence for that either. People 
will come to swallow fish for asthma with their inhaler in their pocket. 
Indians hedge their bets.

Does the inclusion of homeopathy and naturopathy in Ayush have a detrimental 
effect on the image of traditional Indian medicines?
I think so. There’s this idea that they are natural and they can’t cause any 
harm. Of course that’s not true: herbal remedies will have effects because 
there’s something in them. Homeopathy won’t – because there’s nothing in it, 
though it might prevent you being diagnosed with whatever it is that is really 
affecting you. I would drop those two, and look to things that have a 
professionalised system and some evidence and logic behind them.

What’s the biggest challenge for healthcare in India?
Funding is one major thing the government could do immediately. And you need 
to take into account cultural context: when you have tribal people who wrap 
their dead in white clothes then they’re not likely to feel comfortable with 
doctors and nurses wearing white clothes . A lot of doctors I spoke to said we 
need more textbooks that are written here for the Indian cultural context. And 
we need more doctors.
