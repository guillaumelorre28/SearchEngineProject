Maya Angelou was an indomitable spirit of great generosity, kindness, and 
love. Her work, both written and spoken, has inspired, and actually helped, the 
lives of millions. When I think of tribute, I envision Maya as a kind of 
General of Compassion, offering an army of words of encouragement.She was 
special, she was rare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/28/maya-angelou>, she was more 
beautiful than perhaps even she realised, because she was, among other things, 
such an artist, that she could not only create worlds on paper, or in a 
listener's imagination, but she also managed, over and over again in her long 
life, to create and recreate herself.
