Lord Sugar has been paid £20,000 by the Daily Mail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> after it called him a “spiv”.


The face of BBC1’s The Apprentice, Sugar said he would donate the money to 
Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity in London.

Sugar was photographed on Twitter holding a giant cheque “signed” by the 
Mail’s editor,Paul Dacre <https://www.theguardian.com/media/pauldacre>, after 
the article was corrected by the paper on Monday.

It is unlikely to be the real cheque, however, as it was apparently paid out 
on behalf of the Mail by the “Bank of Deceit PLC, Vindictive House, Scum Lane, 
London W8.”

It also described the Mail as a “liar” and a “rag”.

The Mail published a correction about the piece in its “corrections and 
clarifications” column on Monday. It said the word “spiv … may be understood to 
describe a person who is dishonest in his business dealings”.

“We are happy to confirm that this was not the intended meaning, as indeed the 
article stated he is honest and hard working,” it added.

The description appeared in the headline of an article written by Stephen 
Glover, and published on 26 May. Itappears since to have been amended online

The Daily Mail declined to comment.
