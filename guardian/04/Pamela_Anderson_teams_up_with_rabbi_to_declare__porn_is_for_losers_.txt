Former Baywatch star and Playboy model Pamela Anderson has teamed with a rabbi 
to speak out against pornography.


 An opinion piece by Anderson and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach published by the Wall 
Street Journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/take-the-pledge-no-more-indulging-porn-1472684658> 
cites the latest sexting scandal involving former Democratic congressman 
Anthony Weiner in calling for “an honest dialogue” about the dangers of 
pornography and “an honor code to tamp it down”.

The essay calls pornography “a public hazard of unprecedented seriousness”. It 
closes by saying “porn is for losers” and calls it “a boring wasteful and 
dead-end outlet for people too lazy to reap the ample rewards of healthy 
sexuality”.

Anderson has appeared on the cover of Playboy 14 times, most recently in 
December for the magazine’s final nude issue.
