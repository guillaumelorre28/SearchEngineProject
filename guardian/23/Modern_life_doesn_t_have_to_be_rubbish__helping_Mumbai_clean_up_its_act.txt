A plastic bag peeked out from under the mud. Neerav Ghosh put on his synthetic 
gloves and got to work with his daughter, yanking it out along with the other 
detritus embedded in the beach.


It was 1.30pm on a Sunday, and as the rains lashed Versova beach in an 
upmarket suburb ofMumbai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/30/story-cities-11-reclamation-mumbai-bombay-megacity-population-density-flood-risk>
, they went about pulling, plucking and clearing rubbish. Standing on the edge 
of the water, Ghosh, 43, points to a spot 20 metres away from the shoreline and 
says: “For the first two weeks that we cleaned, we couldn’t even see the sand 
till there. The first time that we saw the first grain of sand was just 
overwhelming.”

Ghosh, a film-maker, and his daughter are among the foot soldiers of the 
Versova Resident Volunteers, an informal citizen group that has accumulated 
more than 200 members since it began. Their task: cleaning up a notoriously 
dirty beach.

Since the group started in October 2015, they have cleared up 1,740 tonnes of 
waste –mostly plastic

 – that gets washed up by the sea. “Every week has been impactful,” says Ghosh. 
“It’s quite something that a few people can make a big difference.”

More plastic than fish in the sea by 2050, says Ellen MacArthur

Through the driving rain 
<http://scroll.in/article/812890/after-gurugram-and-bengaluru-incessant-rain-throws-life-out-of-gear-in-mumbai>
, volunteers start to trickle in from 10am, putting on gloves and raincoats and 
collecting and piling rubbish. A few refuse trucks and diggers hum around, 
gathering mounds of waste.

“We have given up our sleep and our free time because nothing is more 
important than protecting our oceans and holding them in trust for future 
generations,” says Afroz Shah, a 33-year-old lawyer who kickstarted the 
campaign. “If we don’t do it now, it will never get done.”

The residents have been working on a 1.5-mile stretch of beach in a western 
suburb close to film studios and homes of some of the biggestBollywood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/07/bollywood-box-office-takings-down-2015-india>
 stars.

One man is tugging hard at a black school bag buried in the mud. “I have lived 
by the sea for 28 years but have never interacted with it as much as I have in 
the past 10 months,” says Naresh Suri, 66. “Earlier, I admit I didn’t bother 
about [the environment]. But now I am totally transformed.”

A fishing community abuts the beach, and its members often join the ranks of 
students, homemakers, film crews and those who live nearby. “It gets cleaned 
up, but see how the garbage keeps returning,” says Virendra Hegde, 42, a 
fisherman, as he points to a dark grey channel of water that joins the ocean.

But the group has made significant progress since 1 June, when they arrived at 
this patch of beach to be confronted by what seemed like towering rubbish all 
around. “That day my heart sank,” says Mona Keshwani, 46. “‘How can we do 
this?’ I thought.”

Since then mountains – of rubbish – have quite literally moved. The beach 
cleanup has drawn the attention of Lewis Pugh, the UN environment programme’s 
patron of the oceans. Thepioneering long-distance swimmer

 will joined the refuse collection efforts when he visited Mumbai last weekend.

The city has several beaches in varying states of cleanliness and has often 
been accused of civic apathy. In 2014 Mumbai ranked 147th in a nationwide 
cleanlinesssurvey

. In October that year the prime minister,Narendra Modi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/india-paris-climate-deal-barack-obama-narendra-modi>
, launched “swachh Bharat abhiyan” (Clean India Mission), a national drive to 
clean up the country. Mumbai is now ranked 10th, according to the latest survey.

Since February, the municipal authorities have been assisting the beach 
cleanup on weekends, and from June began sending machines. “It is a continuous 
process,” says PR Masurkar, assistant municipal commissioner.

Though city officials are consistently pilloried 
<http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/bmc-fails-to-keep-six-out-of-every-seven-budget-promises/>
 for Mumbai’s pothole-studded roads, poor rain preparedness and a mismanaged 
city, residents have sought to move beyond that blame game. “You can’t keep 
blaming the authorities,” says Keshwani. “If someone doesn’t clean up, will you 
simply leave it? It is every citizen’s duty.”
