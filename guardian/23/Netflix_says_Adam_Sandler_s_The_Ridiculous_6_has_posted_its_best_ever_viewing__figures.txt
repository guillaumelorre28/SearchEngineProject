“The Ridiculous 6, by way of example, in the first 30 days on Netflix it’s 
been the most-watched movie in the history of Netflix,”he told reporters 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/06/netflix-ridiculous-6>. “It’s also enjoyed 
a spot at No 1 in every territory we operate in, and in many of them it’s still 
No 1.”

Success for The Ridiculous 6 comes despite the film being panned by critics – 
as Sandler’s movies routinely are, as well as Netflix users.Last month it was 
reported that the comedy had been removed from Netflix UK’s main carousel

 in favour of the equally poorly received Cameron Crowe comedy Aloha after just 
three days of availability, amid suggestions the site was trying to bury the 
$60m film. But Sarandos’s comments suggest The Ridiculous 6 has in fact been an 
unqualified success.


The western came under fire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/04/adam-sandler-the-ridiculous-six-darkening-makeup-actors-netflix>
 in May for alleged racist treatment of Native American actors. Sandlerhas 
called the furore

 a “misunderstanding”.

Netflix expanded to 130 new countries 
<https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-is-now-available-around-the-world>
, including Russia, India, Nigeria, South Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore, Turkey and Indonesia, this week in what the country has described as 
a “global” launch. Most of the new territories will receive programming in 
English, though the firm has also added film and television content in Arabic, 
Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese to the 17 languages it already 
offers.
