I planted ‘Therador’ 
<http://www.tamarorganics.co.uk/pages/catalogue.php?status=2&cat=3&typename=GARLIC&prod=563>
 garlic last December. I’ve taken one up and found it hasn’t separated into 
cloves. I’m worried they’ll all be like that and won’t store. Is this likely 
and what’s the cause?

Wait a bit longer. What you’ve pulled up sounds like some very healthy green 
or “wet” garlic, when the whole bulb is like an onion. I bet clove initiation 
has happened, but the papery skin between each one hasn’t hardened yet; this 
happens in the last few weeks of ripening.

You planted the garlic a little late. Garlic planting season is the end of 
October into November and again in January/February, depending on the variety. 
This doesn’t matter; it just means your garlic will be ready more likely 
towards mid August than now.

Garlic needs 30 nights at less than 10C over the winter for the cloves to 
develop properly. If this doesn’t happen, then you do just get one fat 
onion-like bulb. You can plant specifically for this in March so that you can 
harvest wet garlic, which is mild and tastes absolutely delicious, particularly 
if grilled. You can still store wet garlic well into around early December, as 
long as they hang somewhere cool, dry and frost-free.
