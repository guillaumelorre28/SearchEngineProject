The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) has recruited a panel to 
advise on its work and wider industry issues 
<https://www.ipso.co.uk/news-press-releases/press-releases/ipso-launches-readers-advisory-panel/>
 from the perspective of readers.

 The six-strong readers’ advisory panel will provide Ipso with an external 
view on a range of topics, such as the editors’ code of practice and the 
regulator’s audit.

It will also act as a focal point for the public, or representative groups, to 
feed back their experiences ofIpso <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ipso>.

One name among the panellists, Tom Rowland, may well raise eyebrows at the 
press victims’ body, Hacked Off. He was regarded as one of its former activists 
and was a core participant at theLeveson inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry>.

Rowland, who spent 10 years as a journalist with the Daily Telegraph and later 
moved into TV production,gave evidence to the inquiry because his phone was 
hacked by a News of the World reporter

.

In his measured statement to the inquiry, he said the former regulator, the 
Press Complaints Commission <https://www.theguardian.com/media/pcc>, had 
offered “reasonable protection to journalists writing legitimate stories who 
are frequently forced to fight misconceived complaints.”

Joining Rowland on the panel are Connie Henry, a former senior private sector 
manager; academic Dr Kate Sang; Michael Curran, who works in PR; solictor 
Nabila Zulfiqar who has experience of regulation and governance; and Samantha 
McFarlane, a marketing agency owner and charity trustee.

None of the panellists are employed by a publisher that is, or even could be, 
regulated by Ipso.


Charlotte Urwin, Ipso’s head of standards, said: “I am delighted to welcome 
our panellists. Their input as readers will help inform Ipso’s important work 
around press standards and they will provide us with invaluable advice and 
expertise.”

In addition, Ipso has set up a journalists’ advisory panel to offer advice 
from the perspective of journalists. It is due to meet for the first time early 
in the new year. Its membership will be announced in January.
