Who would have picked that the furore over superannuation would make it to the 
tail-end of week four – let alone spill over onto the backbench?

But like an old-style mafia war <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-sIQpQ2drY>, 
everyone is laying down the mattresses in preparation for a marathon fight.

On Tuesday, you’ll remember, Julie Bishop was caught out over changes to the 
“transition to retirement” scheme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/01/superannuation-transition-to-retirement-julie-bishop-gotcha-moment>
. From 1 July next year, people aged 56 to 65 will pay a 15% concessional tax 
rate on earnings from assets.

The prime minister and the treasurer say the Coalition’s plan will affect only 
the top 4% of income earners but concerns that this isn’t strictly the case 
have caused rumblings within the party room.

Then Arthur Sinodinos said on Sky on Wednesday that the budget package might 
be adjusted if the government was re-elected – and then, in the same interview, 
that it wouldn’t.

Scott Morrison, the treasurer, said later that Sinodinos was referring to the 
implementation of the legislation – not the policy itself.


And speaking of mattresses, Malcolm Turnbull visited a mattress factory in 
Sydney (“Australian artisans, Australian technology”), and told reporters the 
“policy, the substance ... the economic substance” of the policy was settled as 
it was laid out in the budget.

<https://twitter.com/stephendziedzic/status/738196196557127681> 
But Bill Shorten was critical of the Coalition’s internal friction: “People 
don’t want surprises in superannuation.”

He also raised a practical concern: the tax office requires people to keep 
receipts for five years and the Coalition’s super changes require people to 
revisit contributions going back nine years.

On any fair assessment, current superannuation laws need reining in, and both 
Labor and theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
have vowed to do so – they’re just split over how.

“Let’s get real about this,” said Turnbull. “Nobody likes paying more tax. 
Super has been an extremely generous system. It remains a very generous tax 
advantage system. That hasn’t changed.”

Morrison – never one to shy away from metaphor – this morning accused Labor of 
using taxes as bullets in Bill Shorten’s “war on business”: “Going forward he 
will continue to seek to attack growth with these toxic taxes that will be a 
toxin for our growth going forward.”
Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) 
Labor already have a plan for $100 billion of higher taxes on the Aus economy.

Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy described it as a “pantomime-like beat 
down ... an agenda-setting effort so patently ludicrous it induced giggles”.

Setting aside all hyperbole, different models of growth underpin the choice 
voters are presented with at this election. You wouldn’t necessarily know that 
to hear the Coalition talk about it.

Asked whether language like “bullets” was appropriate political discourse, 
Turnbull agreed that Shorten had declared war on business – specifically, 
“family businesses of Australia”.

But he didn’t overextend the metaphor quite as spectacularly as his treasurer, 
asLenore Taylor wrote in her column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/election-2016-scott-morrison-strains-credibility-with-claims-of-a-labor-war-on-everything>
.

One assumes on breaks from the war on business, Labor promised to enter into 
power purchase agreements (PPA) equal to bringing commonwealth energy use up to 
50% renewable energy by 2030. The contracts would be entered into for 10 to 15 
years.

Shorten was reluctant to be drawn on how much the policy would cost.

they last dropped a record it’s fair to say a few things have changed.

One Twitter user described the new track, Frankie Sinatra – which premiered on

“How old is your rat?” – as Turnbull ventured of a mall-going 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-catchup>
 rodent named Splinter on Monday – will surely go down as a catchphrase of this 
campaign. (Two-and-a-half was the answer, in case you forgot. Come now, it’s 
only Thursday.)

The team at The Chaser gave a rodent to Tanya Plibersek, Labor’s deputy 
leader, at the Sydney Fish Market this morning.
