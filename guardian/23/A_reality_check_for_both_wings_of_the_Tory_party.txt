As the chancellor sat down, commentators and politicians began to muse whether 
they had just witnessed a true heir to Tory predecessor George Osborne, or a 
man intent in following in the footsteps of Labour’s Ed Balls.

Philip Hammond was clearly not mimicking the dancing style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/19/bouncing-balls-former-labour-mp-defies-odds-with-strictly-success>
 of the former Labour MP. However, he did seem comfortable announcing almost 
Keynesianlarge-scale investment projects 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/nov/23/dont-mistake-autumn-statement-for-infrastructure-splurge>
 and high levels of borrowing to invest, in a statement that, unquestionably, 
had an interventionist touch.

That alongside, at best, moderate action for just managing families and stark 
forecasts in the face of Brexit uncertainty left Hammond facing possible angst 
from both sides of his party.

One Conservative MP, making his way from the House of Commons’ chamber to an 
office in Portcullis House, parliament’s glass-roofed annexe, admitted that he 
was a little concerned. “There is some worry about them shifting to a more 
interventionist position, especially among those of us who are more free 
marketeers,” said the politician. “I can see why they want to do it. It is 
seductive to step in if an industry is in trouble. But they have to be careful 
not to go too far.”

Nearby, a Tory on the left wing of the party was critical for a different 
reason. “What was there forjust managing families 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/move-over-jams-next-year-this-time-the-focus-may-be-on-pgps>
?” they asked, shrugging their shoulders and rolling their eyes. “The sandwich 
didn’t have much jam!”

And yet, while there was the odd grumble, the backbench concern did appear to 
be largely muted. Most Tory MPs wandering around the Commons seemed relatively 
pleased with what they had heard.

Heidi Allen, a key figure who has been pushing hard for the government to 
offer relief to universal credit recipients who are facing massive cuts, seemed 
satisfied with what she had heard.

Although Labour said a change in the benefit’s taper rate fell well short of 
undoing the damage caused by the original decision, Allen insisted that it was 
a start. “You are always a little bit disappointed because you dream of utopia 
and I hoped we might have more,” she told the Guardian’s Politics Weekly 
podcast.

But alongside continued increases to the personal allowance and a rise in the 
minimum wage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/23/how-will-autumn-statement-affect-you>
, she argued that “a billion pounds into universal credit plus” was pretty good.

Others simply felt that the chancellor had done what he had to. “Philip 
Hammond delivered the autumn statement you’d expect him to,” said backbencher 
James Cleverly, a Tory MP who backed Brexit. “It was not flamboyant, there were 
no bells and whistles. There was some difficult economic news, but still with 
spending on areas thatConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> care about – transport, 
broadband, fuel duty.”

Nicky Morgan, who supported remain and has been an increasingly vocal member 
of the backbench awkward squad, also described it as “steady as he goes”.

 Backbenchers also pointed to Hammond’s expectation management, through which 
he made sure the media, but also Conservatives, weren’t clamouring for much. It 
was noted that Hammond had addressed a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee 
where he stressed to colleagues that showmanship (think rabbits, sweets, 
gimmicks) wasn’t his style.

And so gone were the four to five pages that Osborne would have dedicated in 
the “green book” to regional giveaways (through which the A14 appeared to have 
been resurfaced several times). Hammond’s approach was to focus on investment 
in specific industrial areas, not parts of the country.

And then there was Brexit. Even those who campaigned for the UK to leave the 
EU admitted the economic news was tough. But the argument was that Hammond 
provided the Conservatives with a “bullet-proof” messenger given that he had 
campaigned to remain.

 Brexit-supporting MPs also argued that the borrowing figures were over a long 
period, and pointed out that Hammond would have pleased leavers by starting his 
speech with a booming introduction about the robust health of the British 
economy.

 On this thinking, Hammond’s cautious approach to the question of Brexit so 
far (critics have accused the chancellor of being a doom-monger) also gives him 
the advanage that people take him even more seriously when he sounds upbeat.

But perhaps MPs are hearing what they most want to. While Brexiters have 
seized on Hammond’s positive start, remainers were instead taken by a more 
worrying end. As one MP fighting for a soft Brexit put it: “This was the first 
reality check about justhow difficult this is going to be for the British 
economy

.”
