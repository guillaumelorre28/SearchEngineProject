A real-life version of The Wrong Trousers immortalised by Wallace and Gromit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wallace-and-gromit> is being 
developed by a British team of robotic experts.

The close-fitting “smart trousers” will employ artificial muscles to assist 
the mobility of frail elderly and disabled individuals.

Ultimately they could even replace stairlifts and wheelchairs, according to 
the University of Bristol team.

Dr Jonathan Rossiter, from the university’s department of engineering 
mathematics, who is leading the £2m project, said: “This is the first time soft 
robotics technologies have been used to address the many rehabilitation and 
healthcare needs in one single type of wearable device.

“Many existing devices used by people with mobility problems can cause or 
aggravate conditions such as poor circulation, skin pressure damage or 
susceptibility to falls, each of which is a drain on health resources.

“Wearable soft robotics has the potential to improve many of these problems 
and reduce healthcare costs at the same time too.”

The “intelligent clothing” will use artificial muscles made from smart 
materials and reactive plastic-like molecules capable of exerting great forces.

Control systems will be incorporated that monitor the wearer and work with the 
body’s own muscles to provide assistance when needed.

The system could help vulnerable people avoid falls, provide the added 
strength needed to move between sitting and standing, and make it easier to 
climb stairs.

The three-year project, due to start in July, is part of a £5.3m funding 
programme from theEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 
<http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/> (EPSRC) to support the development of assistive and 
rehabilitative devices.

In the 1993 Aardman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> animation The 
Wrong Trousers, Wallace becomes trapped in a pair of ex-Nasa robotic “Techno 
Trousers” that carry him off to steal a valuable diamond.
