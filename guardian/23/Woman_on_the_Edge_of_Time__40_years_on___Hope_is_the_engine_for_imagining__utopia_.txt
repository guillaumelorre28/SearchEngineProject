The point of a novel about the future is not to predict it; I‚Äôm not pretending 
to be Nostradamus. The point of such writing is to influence the present by 
extrapolating current trends for advancement or detriment. Nobody is good at 
prediction. If we were better at guessing events in a year or even a few months 
or weeks, our divorce rate would be zero, we would not get into stupid 
relationships, and nobody would lose money in the stock market or to the 
racetrack. The point of creating futures is to get people to imagine what they 
want and don‚Äôt want to happen down the road ‚Äì and maybe do something about it.

Woman on the Edge of Time was first published 40 years ago and begun 
three-and-a-half years before that. The early 1970s were a time of great 
political ferment and optimism among those of us who longed for change, for a 
more just and egalitarian society with more opportunities for all the people, 
not just some of them. Since then, inequality has greatly increased.

As I write, more people are poor, more people are working two or three jobs 
just to get by, more people have seen their savings and their future wiped out 
by bad health or lost jobs. The homeless are everywhere, not just the single 
man or woman down on their luck or the shuffling bag lady but whole families 
with their children. There are fewer chances for the children of ordinary 
people to go to an ordinary college; if they can go, they will then have to 
drag huge debt through much of their adult lives. Many working-class jobs that 
paid people enough to buy and pay for a house and to hope for an even better 
life for their children have been shipped overseas. There, people even poorer 
will do the work for pennies. Unions that protected workers have lost much of 
their clout and represent fewer workers each year.

At the time I wrote this novel, women were making huge gains in control of 
their bodies and their lives. Not only has that momentum been lost, but many of 
the rights we worked so hard to secure are being taken from us by Congress and 
state legislatures every year.

But we must also understand that the attempt to take away a woman‚Äôs control 
over her body is part of a larger attempt to take away any real control from 
most of the population. Now, corporations and the very wealthy 1% control 
elections. Now, the media are propaganda machines and the only investigative 
reporting is on Comedy Central, HBO, or the web. 

The powers that be have allowed for certain social rather than economic gains. 
We‚Äôll soon finally have legalised marijuana and gay marriage in every state ‚Äì 
but unions are being crushed and the safety net of the New Deal and the Johnson 
era is being abolished one law at a time, while women are forced into the 
back-alley abortions that once killed so many. We have made some social gains 
and many economic losses. The real earning power of working people diminishes 
every year.


Instead of slut-shaming, I projected a society in which sex was available, 
accepted, and non-hierarchical

During the heyday of the second wave of the women‚Äôs movement, a number of 
utopias were created (Joanna Russ‚Äôs The Female Man

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Mann_Borgese> from  The Ascent of 
Woman, andSally Miller Gearhart‚Äôs  The Wanderground 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wanderground> among them) and now they 
aren‚Äôt. Why? Feminist utopias were created out of a hunger for what we didn‚Äôt 
have, at a time when change felt not only possible but probable. Utopias came 
from the desire to imagine a better society when we dared to do so. When our 
political energy goes into defending rights, and projects we won and created 
are now under attack, there is far less energy for imagining fully drawn future 
societies we might wish to live in.

Writing about a strong community that socialises children and integrates old 
people is a response to women living in a society where a mother is often alone 
with her children and old women are treated just a step better than the excess 
pets executed daily in pounds and shelters.

We are ever more isolated from truly intimate contact with one another. Many 
men prefer pornography to actual sex, where they have to please a woman or must 
at least pretend to try. I have read my poetry to audiences where the students 
were all texting instead of listening or responding. I have sat at restaurant 
tables across from ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who were playing with their phones or tablets. How 
many people do you see on the street walking blindly while talking on their 
smartphones? According to a recent poll, many people now report that their most 
intimate friends are their pets, or personalities on TV.

I also wanted Woman on the Edge of Time to show an ecologically sound society. 
The lives and institutions and rituals of Mattapoisett all stress being a part 
of nature and responsible for the natural world. In imagining the good society, 
I borrowed from all the progressive movements of that time. Like most women‚Äôs 
utopias, the novel is profoundly anarchist and aimed at integrating people back 
into the natural world and eliminating power relationships.  The nuclear 
family is rare in feminist utopias and banished from this novel.

Probably the most controversial part of Mattapoisett is the brooder 
(technology that allows babies to be born without pregnancy) as many women felt 
they would be unwilling to give up birthing. If I had the book to write over 
again, I would include a group that chose to give birth live. In my original 
notes, I intended to, but during the long and complicated writing of the book, 
I never did put it in.

Instead of slut-shaming, I projected a society in which sex was available, 
accepted and non-hierarchical ‚Äì and totally divorced from income, social 
status, power. No trophy wives, no closeting, no punishment or ostracism for 
preferring one kind of lover to another. No need to sell sex or buy it. No 
being stuck like my own mother in a loveless marriage to support yourself. In 
the dystopia in Woman on the Edge of Time, women are commodified, genetically 
modifed and powerless.

Who decides cars are all-important and our cities must be built around them as 
if they were the primary inhabitants?

Before beginning the novel, I read all the utopian fiction I could lay my 
hands on, partly to study the narrative strategies that had worked and those 
that were too static to compel a contemporary reader. I also read at least as 
many dystopian novels ‚Äì perhaps more. Science fiction in the 1950s was 
flooded with miserable post-nuclear-holocaust worlds, and I spent my 
adolescence reading a fair amount of those. 

The other genre I was working in was time travel. I was weary of affluent 
white males hogging the genre, and I did not feel that they were the sort of 
visitors I would prefer if I were a future good society. When I was a child, I 
first noticed that neither history as I was taught it, nor the stories I was 
told, seemed to lead to me. I began to fix them. I have been at it ever since. 
We need a past that leads to us. Similarly, what we imagine we are working 
toward does a lot to define what we will consider doable action aimed at 
producing the future we want and preventing the future we fear.



 I am always interested in who controls technology in any given society at a 
particular time. Who decides that trolleys and passenger trains are obsolete 
but that cars are all-important and our cities must be built around them as if 
they were the primary inhabitants? Who chooses which technology is explored? 
Who sets the rules for what is dangerous and what is acceptable risk? That 
it‚Äôs important for taxpayers to subsidise nuclear power plants when there is no 
possible escape for people living near them when the inevitable accident 
occurs? For whose benefit are options explored? Who decides what is done and to 
whom it is done? How decisions are made in a fair and egalitarian way was one 
of the themes of the novel.

 I am also very interested in the socialising and interpersonal mechanisms of 
a society. How is conflict dealt with? Again, who gets to decide, and upon 
whose head and back are those decisions visited? How does that society deal 
with loneliness and alienation? How does it deal with getting born, growing up 
and learning, having sex, making babies, becoming sick and healing, dying and 
being disposed of? How do we deal with collective memories ‚Äì our history ‚Äì that 
we are constantly reshaping?

 Utopia is born of the hunger for something better, but it relies on hope as 
the engine for imagining such a future. I wanted to take what I considered the 
most fruitful ideas of the various movements for social change and make them 
vivid and concrete ‚Äì that was the real genesis of Woman on the Edge of Time.
