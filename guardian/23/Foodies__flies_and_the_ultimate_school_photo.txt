Tony Naylor assures us (Fish fingers taste test 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/16/fish-fingers-taste-test-which-get-the-thumbs-up>
, 17 November) that no one was a foodie in 1986. However, Google confirms my 
memory that the word appeared in print at least as early as 1980, and was in 
common enough use by 1984 for Ann Barr and Paul Levy to publish The Official 
Foodie Handbook. Many “recent” ideas go back a lot further than we commonly 
suppose.

• So an attractive school photograph is possible (School portrait wins award

, 16 November). At my school (nearly 50 years ago) we dreaded the results. My 
friend Graham came out a colour that Donald Trump would take decades to achieve.

• Maybe the only hope for a Democratic female president (‘She didn’t fail us, 
we failed her’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/12/hillary-clinton-we-failed-her-sarah-churchwell>
, 12 November) is to identify a girl at birth, like a Dalai Lama, and bring her 
up in such rarified surroundings that she cannot be accused of any wrongdoing 
while at the same time teaching her everything she needs to know to be 
president.

• I am the same age as Alan Payling but my calculations of the ratio of LP to 
wages (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/in-1966-an-lp-cost-almost-a-quarter-of-a-teenage-pop-pickers-pay>
, 17 November) is nearer 10% than 25%.
12s 6d = 62.5p, £6 10s 6d = £6.52. 
Ah, the benefits of decimalisation!

• Robert Vaughn’s flycatching in The Magnificent Seven (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/a-tip-for-trump-and-a-search-for-tropes>
, 17 November) wasn’t such a supreme moment: there were several flies and as he 
gazed at his sole captive he drawled: “There was a time when I’d’a caught all 
three.”
