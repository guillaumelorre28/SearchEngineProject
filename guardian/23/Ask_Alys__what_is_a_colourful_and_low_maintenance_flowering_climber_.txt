Which flowering climbers that won’t need pruning can I plant in our wild hedge 
to provide colour and fragrance? Perhaps a rambling rose and a honeysuckle or 
two?
As it’s a native hedge, I suggest dog roses (Rosa canina), wild clematis (
Clematis vitalba <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clematis_vitalba>), native 
honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonicera_periclymenum>) and hops (Humulus lupulus
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humulus_lupulus>).

If you want froth, remember that rambling roses tend to flower once, while 
climbers repeat-flower. Ramblers such as creamy white‘Wedding Day’
