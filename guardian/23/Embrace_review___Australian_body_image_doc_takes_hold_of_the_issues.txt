Cannily scheduled for release at the time of year when gym applications and 
feelings of self-disgust reach their peak, this Australian documentary examines 
body-image issues, especially among women, and our inability to embrace 
ourselves as we are.

The film is both a critique and a product of the social media era, given that 
director-presenterTaryn Brumfitt

 first found fame when a pair of pictures – one showing her in body-builder 
condition, and in the other, naked and softened by child-bearing and 
contentment – went viral, earning both praise and trollish opprobrium.

Brumfitt sets out on a round-the-world expedition to understand the issues 
better, meeting assorted experts and opinionated celebrities such as Amanda de 
Cadenet and Ricki Lake, as well as a woman with a terrible eating disorder, a 
severe burns survivor and a delightful young lady whose hormone imbalance gives 
her a beard. It has an indisputably worthy message, and should be essential 
viewing for young people. Older, more jaded viewers may feel like we’ve been 
over this ground many times before – except, in the old days, we were a 
lotangrier about it all, and unafraid to use words such as “feminism”.
