Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
are two similar dilemmas – what are your thoughts?

As something of an agony uncle, I am seeking your advice on how to become an 
agony aunt.

All my life I have helped others with their problems and tried hard to find 
out how I can do this publicly. I have started my own Facebook and Twitter 
page, but have been unsuccessful so far.

Any tips or advice you could offer me would be gratefully received.

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a 
brief email todear.jeremy@theguardian.com <mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com>. 
Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply 
personally.
