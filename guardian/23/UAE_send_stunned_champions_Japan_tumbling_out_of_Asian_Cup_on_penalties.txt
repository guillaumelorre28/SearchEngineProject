United Arab Emirates <https://www.theguardian.com/football/unitedarabemirates> 
produced one of the greatest Asian Cup upsets to send champions Japan tumbling 
out of the tournament 5-4 on penalties after their quarter-final in Sydney 
finished 1-1 after extra-time on Friday.

Japan’s Shinji Kagawa missed the first sudden-death spot-kick to hand the 
initiative to UAE, whose defender Ismail Ahmed nervelessly converted the 
decisive penalty to send his team into a last-four meeting with the hosts 
Australia on Tuesday.

The winner of that semi-final in Newcastle will meet Iraq or South Korea in 
the final at Stadium Australia on 31 January.

The substitute Gaku Shibasaki had earlier saved the blushes of the Samurai 
Blue by equalising nine minutes from the end of normal time after Ali Ahmed 
Mabkhout had given the Gulf nation an early lead with his fourth goal of the 
tournament.

Mabkhout’s powerful shot into the corner of the net after seven minutes was 
the first goalJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> had conceded 
in Australia, stunning the blue-shirted, drum-thumping band of their supporters 
behind the goal into rare silence.

Japan have not won the Asian Cup four times in the last six tournaments by 
panicking, though, and they continued to press forward after the goal with the 
neat inter-passing game that won them three from three in the group stage.

They failed to convert possession into clear-cut chances, however, with 
Takashi Inui wasting the best of them in the first half by directing his 
far-post header straight at the goalkeeper Majed Naser.

Japan had kept the UAE’s chief creator, Omar Abdulrahman, quiet before 
half-time but the languid midfielder nearly helped his side double the lead 
four minutes after the break with a delightful flick into the box that Mabkhout 
just failed to control.

Inui had been replaced by Yoshinori Muto at half-time and the substitute had 
two chances to make a quick impression but flashed a shot wide before also 
failing to hit the target with a free header. That set the template for the 
next half an hour of the match.

The UAE goal was under almost permanent siege but a combination of stout 
defending and misfiring Japan forwards kept the underdogs ahead until Shibasaki 
lashed the ball into the net from the edge of the area after a one-two with 
Keisuke Honda.

Having been handed a lifeline, Japan looked determined to finish the tie in 
normal time but continued to waste a string of chances and the profligacy 
continued into a strangely passionless extra half an hour.

Honda sent the opening spot-kick high over the bar but Khamis Esmaeel did the 
same with the UAE’s third penalty and the shootout went to sudden death.
