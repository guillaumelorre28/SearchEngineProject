The AV referendum result has demonstrated the actual existence of the formerly 
rumoured metropolitan liberal elite (AV referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/av-over-yes-campaign-routed?INTCMP=SRCH>
, 7 May). What a parade of liberal snobs and toffs – Oxford and Cambridge, 
Camden and Islington, orchestrated by the good old Guardian; you couldn't make 
it up. Is Michael White being satirical when he describes this collection of 
out-of-touch villagers asprogressives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/may/06/michael-white-sketch-av-referendum-count>
? I hope so, following the Guardian's call to vote Lib Dem a year ago. Leader 
Miliband should note that Doncaster – a town in northern England he is kind 
enough to represent – recorded one of the firmest rebuttals of this piece of 
time-wasting nonsense.

• I now have a better understanding of the term chattering class. "We voted 
Yes to AV – in Islington."

• Both Oxford and Cambridge voted Yes to AV. Are those populations peculiarly 
ill-informed or just rather dim-witted?

Stephen Tomkins

Cambridge

• If 10 of 440 voting areas voted in favour of AV, those areas should use it 
in all forthcoming general elections. MPs do not all have to be elected in the 
same way – various countries use different ways to elect MEPs. TheConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> have made localism one of 
their central themes – what could be more localist than allowing communities to 
decide how they choose their elected representatives?
