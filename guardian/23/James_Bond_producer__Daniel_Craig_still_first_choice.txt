The team behind the James Bond films want actor Daniel Craig to return to the 
role, one of the producers had told the BBC. Speaking onRadio 4’s Today 
programme <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgn7c>, executive producer Callum 
McDougall said Craig was “absolutely the first choice” of series producers 
Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson.

“I know they’re hoping for him to come back,” said McDougall, who has worked 
on nine Bonds, including all of those on which Craig has worn the tuxedo: 
Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/daniel-craig-offered-150m-two-more-bonds>
 that the producers had offered Craig $150m for two further movies; this figure 
was subsequentlydebunked

Jamie Bell and Tom Hughes.
