YouTube is launching its YouTube 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube> Kids app in the UK and 
Ireland, nine months after its child-friendly service went live in the US.

More than 10 million American parents have downloaded the app, which serves up 
a filtered selection of videos and channels that are appropriate for children.

The app also removes social features like comments and the ability to upload 
videos; has a built-in timer to limit how long children can use it; and blocks 
inappropriate search terms including “sex”.

The UK and Irish version of YouTube Kids emphasises local channels, including 
famous children’s brands like Morph, Teletubbies, Wallace & Gromit and The 
Magic Roundabout.

However, they sit alongside digital brands like nursery-rhymes channel Little 
Baby Bum

,Minecraft gamer Stampy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/31/minecraft-books-stampy-youtube-stardom-joseph-garrett>
 and app-inspired cartoon seriesTalking Tom and Friends 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/14/apps-smartphones>.

As in the US, the app is a free download for Android and iOS devices, but will 
make its money from advertisements running in between the videos.

That has been controversial in the US, with several consumer-rights 
organisationscalling for regulator the Federal Trade Commission to investigate 
YouTube Kids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/07/google-youtube-kids-app-complaint-fcc>
 over its use of ads.

“We only show ads that are approved as family-friendly - for example, we don’t 
show any food and beverage ads - and all ads undergo a rigorous review process 
for compliance with our policies,” a YouTube spokesperson told the Guardian.

“All ads are clearly labeled and include ad intros. Ads don’t include any 
click-throughs to websites or product purchase flows.”

Some US complaints have focused on a different issue: the question of whether 
some popular channels – particularly those that focus on unboxing toys – blur 
the lines between entertainment and advertising too much, even if suggestions 
that some of these channels are being paid by toy companies to feature their 
products have yet to be proven.

 British channel Little Baby Bum recently overtook One Direction. 
YouTube Kids has also faced questions about whether it is tracking the viewing 
habits of its young users. YouTube describes it as a “signed-out experience” 
because the app does not require a parent or child to sign in to their existing
Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> or YouTube account.

However, YouTube Kids does collect data on the videos watched by individual 
children, for a recommendations feature that suggests videos they might like 
based on their habits.

The app also has a feature enabling parents to “flag” videos that they think 
are inappropriate for children, but have avoided YouTube Kids’ filtering 
algorithms.

“We always try to make the videos available in the app family-friendly, but no 
system is perfect. So if you ever find a video you’re concerned about, please 
flag it,” wrote YouTube’s head of kids and learning partnerships Greg Dray in a 
blog post.

YouTube already has a huge audience of children watching videos on its 
service. In October,20 of the 50 most popular YouTube channels were aimed at 
children 
<http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/11/13/top-100-most-viewed-youtube-channels-worldwide-october-2015/>
, and those 20 channels generated more than 5.2bn video views that month alone.

British channel Little Baby Bum was top of the children’s pile – and the third 
biggest channel on YouTube overall – with 428.5m video views in October.

It has just overtaken One Direction as the most-watched British channel of all 
time, while its Wheels on the Bus compilation recently dethroned Psy’s Gangnam 
Style as the biggest YouTube video by watch-time (if not views).

“If you think about any child that’s aged 13 or under nowadays, more and more 
you’ll see they don’t watch TV,” said Little Baby Bum’s co-founder Derek 
Holder, who launched the channel with his wife in 2011.

“In any kind of media industry – radio, TV or movies – there’s a filter of the 
big companies who decide ultimately what you will hear or see. YouTube removes 
those filters to an extent and makes it a level playing field.”

 Morph’s new adventures are part of YouTube Kids. 
Aardman is an example of a company from the traditional children’s TV world 
using YouTube to reach its audience in new ways, includingthe return of classic 
claymation character Morph <https://www.youtube.com/user/MorphOfficial/videos> 
in 2014, funded by aKickstarter crowdfunding campaign 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1961548517/all-new-adventures-of-morph-from-aardman-animation>
.

Morph will be among the featured channels for YouTube Kids in the UK and 
Ireland. “It’s a whole new space in which we can reach new fans,” said Alix 
Wiseman, Aardman’s head of sales and acquisitions.

“We’re reaching new audiences through a new platform and a new channel, with 
new content that we’ve been able to make, but based on anAardman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> brand that was built 40 years ago. 
It’s brilliant that YouTube have seen this opportunity.”

YouTube Kids has also launched today in Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
