The winners: mature titles

It’s no change at the top of the UK box office as Suicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
,Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
,Jason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp>
 andThe BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-steven-spieberg-roald-dahl>
 all retain their lock on the top four places. Suicide Squad suffered by far 
the biggest decline, down 62%, but was nevertheless the clear winner, with 
weekend takings of £4.24m. After 10 days, the Warner/DC release has grossed an 
impressive £22.2m here. That compares with £25.9m forDeadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
 after two weekends of play – but that was a 12-day figure for Deadpool, thanks 
to its previews strategy. Another apt comparison might be Disney/Marvel’s
Guardians of the Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes>
, which stood at £13.8m after two weekends.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/28/suicide-squad-trailer-dcs-superhero-ensemble-comedy-starring-will-smith-video>
Finding Dory added another £7m, bringing its 17-day total to a robust £27.3m. 
Last summer’s big Pixar movieInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar>
 had reached £22.9m by the same stage of its run, and it ended up with an 
impressive £39.1m.


Jason Bourne and The BFG both added about £3.3m. With £23.5m, The BFG is now 
the eighth highest-grossing release of 2016, behindThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review>, Deadpool,
Captain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>

, Finding Dory andZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
. The latter is on £23.9m, so The BFG will soon overtake it. Rounding out the 
Top 10 for the year so far areThe Revenant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling>
 and Suicide Squad.

Battle of the new releases

Raunchy comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/05/mike-and-dave-need-wedding-dates-review-aubrey-plaza>
 is the top new release, landing in fifth place with £1.07m, including previews 
of £370,000. That’s a fair bit down onDirty Grandpa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/dirty-grandpa-review-robert-de-niro-plumbs-the-comedy-depths>
, in which Zac Efron teamed up with Robert De Niro, and which began in January 
with £2.05m, including £605,000 in previews. This time, Efron’s co-stars are 
Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza.

The real winner: Pete’s Dragon

With an opening gross of £844,000, Disney’s Pete’s Dragon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak>
 was the box-office winner among the new releases, if previews are left out of 
the Mike and Dave number. With family films enjoying consistent returns every 
day, Disney can be confident of a sustained run for the well-reviewed Pete’s 
Dragon until the end of the school holidays.

Battle of the genre pictures: Nerve v The Shallows

Just behind Pete’s Dragon are two high-concept thrillers – Nerve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/nerve-review-teen-thriller-perils-online-celebrity>
 andThe Shallows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/the-shallows-review-blake-lively-shark-thriller-jaume-collet-serra>
 –neck and neck with £803,000 and £801,000 respectively. Again, preview numbers 
are skewing the true picture. Strip them out, and The Shallows wins 
convincingly with £710,000 against £608,000 for Nerve. The Shallows offers the 
simple proposition of bleeding, bikini-clad surfer Blake Lively and a circling 
shark. Nerve delivers a teenage Emma Roberts sucked into a game of escalating 
dares decided by a mobile phone app.

The indie hit: Wiener-Dog

There hasn’t been much in the box-office charts for the past month to 
challenge mainstream Hollywood. Indie cinemas have been crying out for fresh 
titles, with many of them turning to the blockbusters that are occupying 
multiplexes. So the release ofWiener-Dog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/wiener-dog-review-todd-solondz-sundance-greta-gerwig>
 was certainly timely – the Todd Solondz comedy opened in 38 cinemas, a decent 
number for the director. Debut box office of £86,000 resulted, including £2,000 
in previews. That’s the biggest opening for a US indie sinceThe Neon Demon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/the-neon-demon-review-nicolas-winding-refn-makes-zoolander-3-but-erotic-and-evil>
 andMaggie’s Plan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/maggies-plan-film-review-metropolitan-comedy-greta-gerwig-julianne-moore-ethan-hawke-rebecca-miller>
 over a month ago. Solondz’s biggest UK hit remains Happiness (1999) with 
£648,000, which Weiner-Dog has little chance of matching.

The future

The lack of a big blockbuster release at the weekend meant that takings are 
34% down on the previous session. But it’s not all bad news: box office is 15% 
up on the equivalent weekend in 2015, whenPixels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/pixels-review-adam-sandler-comedy>
 debuted at the top spot. The coming session sees the release of Ricky Gervais’
David Brent: Life on the Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/10/david-brent-life-on-the-road-review-ricky-gervais-office-pop-band>
, belatedly continuing the adventures of The Office’s man-child narcissist, and
Swallows and Amazons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/swallows-and-amazons-review-kelly-macdonald-rafe-spall-arthur-ransome>
, adapted from the Arthur Ransome children’s classic with an adult cast led by 
Kelly MacDonald, Rafe Spall and Andrew Scott. Hollywood alternatives include 
horrorLights Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/lights-out-review-david-sandberg-horror-film>
, already a $61m hit in the US, and the poorly reviewedNine Lives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/05/nine-lives-review-kevin-spacey-christopher-walken>
, in which businessman Kevin Spacey finds himself trapped inside the body of 
his family’s cat. Also due: much-buzzed documentaryTickled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/08/tickled-documentary-review-david-farrier-cyberbullying>

dramaBlack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/11/from-molenbeek-to-hollywood-why-belgian-thriller-black-is-the-new-la-haine>
