There are a variety of reasons you might find yourself at the cinema come 26 
December: to escape the summer heat, to flee the Boxing Day sales or to find an 
oasis away from the ruckus of a house filled with over-stuffed family.

There are already a bunch of big movies out now in Australia – Rogue One for 
the Star Wars fans, Trolls for the kids, Fantastic Beasts foreverybody

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/11/office-christmas-party-review-not-great-night-out-jennifer-aniston-jason-bateman>
 – but the official release dates are held for some films to make the most of 
the festive rush. Here are our picks of that bunch.

Moana, directed by Ron Clements and Don Hall

Starring: Auli’i Cravalho, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Jemaine Clement

Moana review – sail of the century from Disney
 Read more  <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/moana-review-disney> 
What it is: Disney’s latest animated musical dips its toes into Polynesian 
culture to tell the story of a teenage girl’s quest to sail across the ocean 
and save her homeland from ecological disaster.Moana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/moana> (voiced by newcomer Cravalho) is the 
daring, strong and smart young woman at the centre of the tale; next in line to 
be her island’s chief, she’s notable for being a Disney “princess” with no love 
interest and – gasp! – a normal-shaped body.

Moana breaks her father’s rules to venture past the reef to restore the Heart 
of Te Fiti: a magical stone stolen years ago by trickster demigod Maui (a real 
figure in Polynesian mythology, played with no shortage of fun by The Rock).

It’s hazardous terrain for the studio: despite its good intentions, the film 
has still come under fire forreinforcing stereotypes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/disney-depiction-of-obese-polynesian-god-in-film-moana-sparks-anger>
 and amerchandising mishap 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/disney-pulls-maui-childrens-costume-amid-claims-it-is-offensive>
. Still, it’s undeniable fun with a progressive message, a strong heroine, 
exceptional animation (see it in 3D!), songs by Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda, 
and one of the greatest crab cameos you’ll ever be treated to.

What the critics are saying: Writing for the Observer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/moana-review-disney>, Mark 
Kermode praises the film’s “eye-watering visuals, earworm songs and 
heart-swelling messages about respect for the past and hopes for the future”.

Who it’s for: Kids who are looking for a different type of princess; adults 
who cry all the way through kids’ films; fans of eye-watering visuals; fans of 
crabs.

Red Dog: True Blue, directed by Kriv Stenders

Starring: Levi Miller, Bryan Brown, Phoenix the dog

What it is: The original Red Dog film was a surprise hit in 2011, following 
the story of a beloved kelpie who brought together the tiny, diverse mining 
town of Dampier in Western Australia.Red Dog: True Blue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/red-dog-true-blue> is a prequel, telling the 
story of Red Dog before he was Red Dog – when he was, in fact, Blue.

After the sudden death of his father, 11-year-old Mick (Miller) expects little 
more than tedium and dirt (and crocodiles) when his grieving mother sends him 
off to live with his brusque and standoffish grandfather (Brown) on a cattle 
station in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Instead, he finds a new 
best friend in a red kelpie puppy covered in blue paint, and all the adventure, 
excitement, joy and heartbreak that comes with life in the outback.

What the critics are saying: Guardian Australia’s film critic, Luke 
Buckmaster, writes: “This very thoughtful, very entertaining origins story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/20/the-10-best-australian-films-of-2015>
 is underscored with a sense of Australiana that feels, well, true blue – 
without trading in hackneyed or cringe-inducing stereotypes.”


Who it’s for: Dog lovers; families; adults who cry all the way through kids’ 
films; anyone with nostalgia for the Australian outback.


Allied, directed by Robert Zemeckis 

Starring: Brad Pitt, Marion Cotillard

Allied review – Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard fail to find Blitz spirit
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/21/allied-review-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-fail-to-find-blitz-spirit>
What it is: It’s 1942. Max (Pitt) is a Canadian airman, parachuted in to north 
Africa and making his way to Casablanca to execute a German ambassador. The 
mission involves him posing as the husband of Marianne (Cotillard), a spy for 
the French Resistance.

During the mission, the pair fall in love for real, and once it is over they 
pack up and head off to London where they get married and live in post-blitz 
bliss for a while, and Marianne gives birth to a daughter. Then one day Max is 
brought in for a meeting with his superiors where they inform him that they 
suspect Marianne of being a deep-cover Nazi spy.

With an aesthetic sensibility harking back to the days when war movies were 
shot for glamour rather than gore, Allied is the romantic thriller that was
purported to have broken up the real-life relationship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/07/allied-eclipsed-by-gossip-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-hollywood>
 of Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard as second world war spies in trailer for Allied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/05/brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-trailer-allied-video>
What the critics are saying: Xan Brooks for the Observer calls it “an 
exhausted dirigible struggling to stay airborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/27/allied-review-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard>
”. The Guardian’s critic, Peter Bradshaw, describes it as “plonkingly slow and 
clonkingly laborious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/21/allied-review-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-fail-to-find-blitz-spirit>
”, and of Pitt and Cotillard: “Their screen passion bursts forth like a cold 
wet teabag falling out of a mug that you have upended over the kitchen sink and 
don’t much feel like washing up. Their rapport fizzes like a quarter-inch of 
bin juice left after you have taken the rubbish out.” Righto, then.

Who it’s for: Fans of Brad Pitt; fans of Marion Cotillard; less-discriminating 
fans of Casablanca; fans of cold wet teabags and bin juice.

La La Land, directed by Damien Chazelle

Starring: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone

La La Land review: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone shine in a sun-drenched musical 
masterpiece
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone>
What it is: An unflinchingly nostalgic naval-gazer, La La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> hurls big screen favourites Stone 
and Gosling back together in an attempt to relive the golden age of the 
Hollywood musical. Whether it succeeds will depend on how much you love the 
genre itself – and how willing you are to let it get away with excess.

Stone plays Mia, an aspiring actor who works in the cafe of a major studio lot 
in Hollywood and pines for her own one-woman show. Gosling plays Sebastian, a 
jazz musician purist who wants to open his own club, and – like the film itself 
– to bring back the lost genre.

Of course the pair despise each other at first, before discovering how well 
they dance and banter together. They may not have the chemistry of Bogie and 
Bacall – and their singing ability won’t blow you away – but then that’s all 
part of the charm.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/01/la-la-land-trailer-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-star-musical-movie-video>
What the critics are saying: Our UK colleague Peter Bradshaw has hailed La La 
Landwith a five-star review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone>
, and Guardian US made the musical its No 2 film of the year, writing: “The 
hold that La La Land is currently exerting over audiences is at least partly to 
do with its function as a comfort blanket of yearning romanticism, 
inward-looking nostalgia and mournful retreat from the present.”


Who’s it for: Lovers of musicals; lovers of Stone and Gosling; lovers of 
Hollywood; lovers of cheese.

Doctor Who: The Return of Doctor Mysterio, directed by Ed Bazalgette


Starring: Peter Capaldi, Matt Lucas, Charity Wakefield

What it is: Doctor Who Christmas specials are a staple of the festive season. 
There have been 11 of them so far, featuring all sorts of gimmicks from an 
homage to Narnia to animated snowmen.

This year’s instalment is a tribute to the world of comic-book superheroes. 
New York is under threat from a horde of brain-swapping aliens. To help save 
the city, the Doctor (Capaldi) and his temporary sidekick Nardole (Lucas) team 
up with whip-smart journalist Lucy (Wakefield) and a masked superhero known as 
the Ghost. It’s like a Superman and Doctor Who mash-up, and it’s being 
broadcast on both the ABC andin selected cinemas

<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/dec/09/doctor-who-christmas-special-2016-trailer-video>
What the critics are saying: The Guardian has not previewed this one. 
According toCatherine Gee for the UK’s Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/doctor-2016-christmas-special-return-doctor-mysterio-first-look/>
, it is “packed with enough witty one-liners and slightly bumbling action 
sequences to keep non-fans happy”.

Who’s it for: Doctor Who fans; comic-book fans who don’t take themselves too 
seriously; anyone looking for post-Christmas dinner viewing that doesn’t 
require leaving the couch.

Gimme Danger, directed by Jim Jarmusch

Starring: Iggy Pop, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, Mike Watt, Danny Fields, James 
Williamson, Steve Mackay, Kathy Asheton

Gimme Danger review – Jim Jarmusch plugs into Iggy Pop's raw power
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/17/gimme-danger-review-jim-jarmusch-iggy-pop-documentary>
What it is: Gimme Danger is Jarmusch’s tribute to Iggy and the Stooges: the 
kind of documentary that can only be made by a fan, following the rise and fall 
and rise again of one of the world’s most influential and infamous punk bands.

It charts the Stooges’ trajectory with archival photographs, footage and some 
new-media magic, from their origins in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the late 1960s 
to their worldwide success in a time of social, political, cultural and musical 
upheaval. When the band split up in 1974, most people thought they were gone 
for good. When they reformed in 2003, they were more popular than they had ever 
been.

it “an act of fanboy – or rather fanman – love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/17/gimme-danger-review-jim-jarmusch-iggy-pop-documentary>

Sing, directed by Garth Jennings

Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett 
Johansson, John C Reilly, Tori Kelly

Sing review – pitch-perfect porcupines have the X factor in jukebox musical
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sing-review-scarlett-johansson-toronto-film-festival-matthew-mcconaughey>
What it is: An animated romp about anthropomorphic animals who love a good 
tune. Buster the koala’s (voiced by McConaughey) theatre is in trouble. It’s 
his pride and joy and he doesn’t want to see it go under, so he decides that 
the only way he can save it is to host the greatest singing competition the 
world has ever seen.

Cue a line-up of contestants, including a sly mouse (McFarlane), a tired 
mother pig (Witherspoon), a shy elephant (Kelly), a porcupine punk (Johansson) 
and more. It’s jam-packed with familiar tunes – indeed, this jukebox musical 
boasts a full 85 songs in the soundtrack. Will Buster make it through the 
ensuing mishaps and mayhem and manage to save his theatre?

What the critics are saying: Jordan Hoffman writes for the Guardian: “The 
songs, like everything else in this streamlined affair, are chosen meticulously 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sing-review-scarlett-johansson-toronto-film-festival-matthew-mcconaughey>
, from right now or the 1980s. In other words, half for the nine-year-olds, 
half for their parents. So there’s a cute gorilla singing Elton John, a 
porcupine singing Carly Rae Jepsen, a happy pig dancing to Taylor Swift and an 
elephant grooving to Stevie Wonder. God, it’s so obnoxious. And the worst thing 
is that it works. I was smiling and applauding at the end, then I had to take a 
long walk alone to wonder what was wrong with me.”

Who’s it for: Children; adults who like anthropomorphic animals; anyone who 
loves a good sing-along.

Why Him? directed by John Hamburg

Starring: James Franco, Bryan Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan Mullally

What it is: Overprotective father (Cranston, more Malcolm in the Middle’s Hal 
than Walter White) meets and is underwhelmed by his daughter’s well-meaning but 
awkward new partner (Franco). The fiance-v-father dynamic, to which the title 
refers, is an established trope and this interpretation is happy not to push 
its boundaries.

The strength of the film lies not in the measuring contest of the two leads 
but in the supporting performances from Mullally (assuming her Parks and 
Recreation character, Tammy II, with the edges somewhat smoothed off) and 
Deutch.

What the critics are saying: The Guardian has not yet reviewed Why Him? but 
it’s had a poor rap from other reviewers, with an average rating of 4.5/10 from 
critics on Rotten Tomatoes. The AV Club damned it with faint praise, calling it 
“sporadically funny”; Vulture went for “disgusting and worse, unfunny”. Make of 
that what you will.

Who’s it for: Those with managed expectations. Give it a miss if you’re with 
your child’s new partner.

Rosalie Blum, directed by Julien Rappeneau

Starring: Noémie Lvovsky, Kyan Khojandi, Alice Isaaz, Anémone, Philippe Rebbot

What it is: A wistful lonely-hearts story, in French, from the debut 
writer-director Rappeneau, based on the graphic novel by the French artist 
Camille Jourdy.

Hairdresser Vincent Machot (Khojandi) lives a somewhat repetitive life, 
working in the business he inherited from his father, looking after his 
overbearing mother in the upstairs apartment and mooning over a girlfriend he 
never sees. Then he claps eyes on Rosalie Blum (Lvovsky).

Vincent can’t stop thinking about Rosalie and begins to follow her around 
town. So Rosalie in turn asks her niece, Alice, to follow Vincent. What emerges 
from these farcical circumstances is an uplifting, life-affirming story about 
loneliness, emotional connection and, ultimately, redemption.

 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/a-united-kingdom-review-rosamund-pike-david-oyelowo-toronto>
What it is: Pike and Oyelowo play Ruth Williams and Seretse Khama, a white 
woman and an African law student who fall in love in London in 1947. The film 
tracks their courtship and return to Khama’s homeland of Bechuanaland (now 
Botswana), where – surprise! – Khama is a prince.

The third feature of Asante, a female British film-maker of Ghanaian heritage, 
A United Kingdom <https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-united-kingdom> is a 
romantic true story from a forgotten chapter of Britain’s postwar past. It 
opened the London film festival in October.

A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video>
What the critics are saying: The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw praised the film’s “
terrific warmth and idealism, and irresistible storytelling relish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/a-united-kingdom-review-rosamund-pike-david-oyelowo-toronto>
”.

“It’s a tale of star-crossed lovers with the bigoted British government 
playing a particularly shabby and nasty House of Capulet: a story of 
imperialism, bully-ism, and Westminster functionaries passing off their taboo 
horror of interracial marrying as a matter of realism and political expediency.”

Who’s it for: A grown-up, grand romance for fans of period drama – perhaps 
those who enjoyed John Crowley’s Brooklyn around the same time last year.
