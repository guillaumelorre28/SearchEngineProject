I have just found out that my partner of 13 years has been having an affair. 
We have children aged three and five. I am devastated. He has moved out at my 
request and we have had counselling. He says he has been deeply unhappy for two 
years, that I made him feel undervalued and put down. I know he has been 
unhappy, but when I asked, he always said he was fine. I am prepared to change 
to try to build a new relationship, for the kids as much as for me, but he just 
goes on about how unhappy he was and what an awful person I am. I think there 
are other issues, as his dad left for someone else when he was 16 – which makes 
it more unbelievable he would do this to his kids. I can’t see a way forward 
unless he accepts responsibility. Or should I cut my losses and make the 
separation permanent?
