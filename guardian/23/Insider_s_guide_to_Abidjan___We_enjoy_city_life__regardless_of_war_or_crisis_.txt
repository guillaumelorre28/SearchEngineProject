In five words

Constant construction, melting pot, Coupé-décalé


Sound of the city

In Abidjan, time is money. Drivers who wait outside our stations want to fill 
their cars with passengers, and the young men nicknamed “Gnamgbro” are tasked 
with finding them. They sit with their heads out the windows, shouting the 
names of destinations to passers-by. In the recording, you can hear one of them 
shouting “Adjamé renault, Adjamé liberté 200” (the destination and the price).

St Paul’s Cathedral is a symbolic place in Abidjan, not just for religious 
reasons, but because of its design. It was built in 1985, 25 years after 
independence from France, and designed by Italian architect Aldo Spirito. Many 
artistic representations of our city use the cathedral.

How green is your city?

Since 2014, our legislation has forbidden the use of plastic bags and smoking 
in public places. But we have a big problem with how to manage the garbage in 
the city, and our lagoon is really polluted. The government are working on it, 
but we do not yet have a monthly clean-up day. Many people also cycle in 
Abidjan, but it is not to reduce carbon emissions – it’s just a practical way 
to get around.

Biggest controversy

Since 2010, the post-electoral crisis has given birth to a debate between two 
conflicting groups: supporters ofLaurent Gbagbo 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/03/who-is-laurent-gbagbo-and-why-is-he-on-trial-at-the-icc/>
 – our country’s former president, who wasarrested in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/laurent-gbagbo-detained-ivory-coast>
 for war crimes – and supporters of Alassane Ouattara, our current president. 
Gbagbo’s trial at the International Criminal Court commenced earlier this year; 
it is known as a “trial of shame” by one group, and “trial of justice” by the 
other.

 ‘Afro chic’ street style. Photograph: Abidjanbystyle.com 
Abidjan’s look is urban, relaxed and more recently, “Afro chic”. Regardless of 
standard of living, people in the city are inspired by French and American 
trends, but now this wave has returned to the source and people like to infuse 
their style with African fabrics, jewels and pearls.

Most under-rated location

Our natural parks deserve some recognition. At the centre of town, the forest 
of Banco is the lungs of Abidjan, and a nice place to soak up nature. However, 
it doesn’t interest people, and the city’s residents rarely visit. It could be 
something to do with the fact that the place is considered the dangerous 
headquarters of criminals …

Best cultural Instagram

Abidjan Places is one of my favourite Instagram accounts. It shares images 
from the city’s inhabitants, and paints a colourful picture of city life.

Moment in history


When we qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 2006. The country 
needed this qualification; it united Ivorians under difficult circumstances 
after the war in 2002.

 The Pyramid building in the heart of the city has fallen into disrepair. 
Photograph: Jean Yves Kacou 
Sadly, this would have to be La Pyramide. In spite of its interesting design – 
it was constructed to bring the feel of an African market into an urban setting 
– the building is old and dirty. Today it has deteriorated, and is inhabited by 
illegal tenants, many of whom are homeless.

What your city does better than anywhere else

We like to enjoy life in Abidjan, regardless of the situation in our city and 
country – be it war or political crisis

Our food always satisfies foreigners, and it’s diverse like our ethnic tribes 
– sweet, a little spiced and colourful.

In Abidjan, the best places to buy food are the street stalls, where it’s 
inexpensive, and there is always a spot nearby to buy a refreshing drink. At 
the end of the day, people like to get together to chat and eat while listening 
to music in the streets. We like to enjoy life in Abidjan, regardless of the 
situation in our city and country – be it war or political crisis.

Zouglou Makers are a group of men who play a style of music known as Zouglou, 
which is typical to Abidjan. You can catch them live in many spots around town, 
mainly in the suburb of Yopougon.

Top insider’s tip

It’s obligatory to try our aforementioned street food if you’re in the city. 
Garba is a personal favourite. The dish is semolina made of manioc (a tuberous 
tree root) with fried tuna – simple and delicious.
