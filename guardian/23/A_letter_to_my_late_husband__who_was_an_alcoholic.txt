The day you died, I thought, will someone now tell me what the hell has been 
going on? It was like a film with a complicated plot, then at the end they tell 
you what was really happening. Except that no one did.

What on earth were the last 12 years about? No explanations for the chaos that 
had defined our lives together. The times you went walkabout and I called the 
police, what did you do when you said you were going to anAA meeting

 and didn’t, what were you up to the day I was at work and you were “working 
from home”.

For a man who told the whole world, whether they wanted to hear or not, how 
much you loved me, what an amazing woman I was, youalways chose the bottle over 
me.

You were a bright, intelligent man who had everything and more. You told me 
you were going to be a millionaire. We were both from Scottish working-class 
families so statements like that were bold. I think I laughed. But you weren’t 
just clever, you were a genius – and the no-common-sense variety of clever. 
Anything earthly was of no interest – organising a mortgage, clothes, planning 
our future – but give you a tome on gravity and your nose would be stuck in it 
until you’d finished. I’ll never forget when you shouted – right through to the 
living room – to tell me that there was a mistake in one of the equations, 
which was pages long. Really, I said, she who had failed first-year university 
maths.

I still go to Al-Anon <http://www.al-anonuk.org.uk/> meetings and its nearly 
17 years since you died. The story is the same – lives destroyed though booze. 
It’s no different if it’s in an upper-class borough in London where I used to 
live or in a working-class suburb of Glasgow.

I only told a few members of our family and friends about what was going on. I 
was constantly lying for you. Even on the day of the funeral, I was talking to 
your colleagues about your“depression”

Other people were alcoholics. I just liked a drink – or so I thought | Lucy

There was little laughter in all of this, but we used to have an adorable 
Polish cleaner who told me that, after you died, she couldn’t figure out why 
there were bottles of vodka in your shoes under the chest of drawers.

But the day that will remain in my mind for ever wasn’t long before your 
death. You were starting to go yellow as yourliver began to fail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2016/jan/25/cirrhosis-how-dangerous-is-drinking>
. We’d not long had the conversation that went along the lines of, “Look, 
there’s a bottle of vodka” (in the cupboard where the tea and coffee were) and 
you replied: “Well, I didn’t put it there.”

It was too exhausting to argue by then and solved nothing. So I remarked on 
the change in your colour and tried to persuade you to go to the doctor. You 
said, “I’ve got an appointment next week, I’ll see about it then.”

That was a lie.

You said, “I’ll take some milk thistle, that’ll help.”

Too late for that, I thought.

You said, “I know what it is – I’ve been drinking too much Fanta.”

To laugh, or to cry …

It doesn’t matter if I believe alcoholism is a disease or not. That day, 
I realised how gripped you were by it and how much control it had over you. For 
this bright, intelligent man to stand there, say that and expect me to believe 
it. To be so deluded, words fail me. You died a few days later. Was it grief or 
relief that I felt?
