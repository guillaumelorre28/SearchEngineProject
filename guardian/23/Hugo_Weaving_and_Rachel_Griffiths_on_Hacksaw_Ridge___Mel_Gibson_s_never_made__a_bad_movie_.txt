Mel Gibson isn’t the sort of film-maker who uses spoonfuls of sugar to help 
the medicine go down. The director of grisly meditations Braveheart, The 
Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto and nowHacksaw Ridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hacksaw-ridge> is more the kind to pour a 
bottle of spirits into an open wound, then throw a match on it.


Gibson is terrific at painting blood-stained moving pictures of humans caught 
in primitive horrors that trigger profound repercussions – from the end of the 
Mayan civilisation, to Jesus hanging from a cross. He also exhibits great skill 
geographically orienting audiences, finding visual clarity in chaos.

That’s a talent Gibson picked up as an actor from his first feature film 
director, George Miller. The Mad Max creator has a remarkably linear approach 
to configuring spatial arrangements: audiences understand at all times where 
they are in the relation to people and objects on screen, no matter what bedlam 
the characters are in the thick of.

It rubbed off on Miller’s actor-cum-director-in-his-own-right apprentice. As 
Hugo Weaving <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hugo-weaving>, on the press 
circuit for Gibson’s hardboiled second world war action-drama Hacksaw Ridge, 
put it: “He’s describing an infinitely chaotic world. And yet the storytelling 
capabilities of Mel are so extraordinary that he can, bullet to bullet, let you 
know as a viewer where you are in this film now, even on the battlefield.”

 ‘The storytelling capabilities of Mel are so extraordinary’: Hugo Weaving on 
Mel Gibson. Photograph: Mark Rogers 
The fog, smoke and stink of war put Gibson’s behind-the-camera skills through 
the wringer. The director comes out firing. Every film, as they say, is a tough 
fight to make. But occasionally you feel pain practically weeping from the 
screen. You can in Hacksaw Ridge, as you could in The Passion of the Christ. 
These are in-your-face movies.

But Rachel Griffiths, paired with Weaving for the interview (despite making 
the film in Australia, Gibson granted no interviews to local media), doesn’t 
find Gibson’s films confrontational per se.

“I think they’re incredibly kinesthetic,” she says. “Maybe some people find 
that confrontational. I don’t find them politically confrontational. In their 
proposition – in their moral proposition – they’re not confrontational. I just 
think they’re extraordinarily physical and visceral, and I think they’re kind 
of like going on a ride.

“When you’re getting on a Mel Gibson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/melgibson> ride it is a rollercoaster. You 
will physically and emotionally go somewhere. It won’t be like,” (Griffiths 
puts on a pompous-sounding voice): “ ‘This is a fascinating film, I love its 
proposition about the moral quandaries of war.’ You’re like, grabbed by the 
neck. But I think confrontation is the wrong word.”

The two great Australian actors play Tom and Bertha Doss, parents of real-life 
war hero Desmond T Doss (Andrew Garfield). The film follows the journey of 
Desmond, who is determined to serve as a medic – and determined to not, under 
any circumstances, carry a gun. He is staunchly against them.

A label like “extraordinary true story” is catnip for marketing departments. 
For this one, the description resonates. Desmond simply will not touch a 
weapon. He faces ridicule, and much worse, from fellow soldiers while training 
at home, and has to fight tooth-and-nail to go to war unarmed.

Hacksaw Ridge is a repudiation of the argument that ends justify means. The 
protagonist, like Gibson, is also religious: a devout Seventh Day Adventist.

“There are religious images within it,” Weaving says, “but to me it’s more 
interesting to see this film as about a man who has very strong faith and a 
very strong ideal. Very strong sense of what he will and won’t do. And how 
holding on to that belief – whatever that belief is – is the thing that propels 
the movie ... In this circumstance, in war, killing is – come on man, that’s 
what everybody does! But I believe killing is wrong in any circumstance, says 
our hero. And that’s what makes the film interesting.”

Griffiths compares Hacksaw Ridge’s messages to the “for the greater 
good”-style arguments that tend to be made about contentious issues.

“We all know torture’s wrong. We’ve just had that conversation for 10 years 
but no, in special circumstances, this is different. Or NSA spying. There’s a 
whole bunch of our contemporary moral dilemmas where people are trying to 
convince us that because of what’s happening we need to move these goalposts.”

One assumes Hacksaw Ridge is a personally significant film for its beleaguered 
actor-director, who hasn’t ventured behind the camera for a decade. Like any 
big budget production that rolls into town, honing the skills of local cast and 
crew, it is also significant for theAustralian film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> industry.

“It was great that Mel was coming back here. He went to the same drama school 
I went to, has the same agents we do and he’s got a lot of experience,” says 
Weaving.

Adds Griffiths: “I’m excited for the Australian crews. Mel’s never made a bad 
movie. They’re all impossibly ambitious: technically, emotionally. They’ve 
always got a kind of heroic architecture. They reach, I think, for really big 
things. When somebody comes in with a big story and a big budget, from a crew 
perspective it raises everybody’s game.”


A little over a year ago, in September 2015, George Brandis lost his job as 
Australian arts minister in Malcolm Turnbull’s first cabinet as prime minister. 
The ideologically driven Brandis – now battlinga different kind of controversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/george-brandis-says-he-didnt-know-of-2014-advice-against-bob-day-office-move>
 – had made headlines for all the wrong reasons, ripping $104m from arts 
funding body the Australia Council.

Weaving sums up how the arts community felt when Brandis was moved on in a 
single word: “Yay!”
