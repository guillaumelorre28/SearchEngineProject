Closing summary: That's all for another year

The City of London has officially shut down for another year.

Traders are heading to their favourite pubs and wine bars to mark the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100’s record high, and to ponder 
what perils and delights 2017 bring.

It’s likely to be another white-knuckle ride, with Trump in the White House, 
Marine Le Pen trying to become French president, China battlign to avoid a hard 
landing, and Britain facing the sticky problem of negotiating an exit from the 
EU.

That will probably add up to more market volatility -- this week’s gentle 
trading will soon be just a memory.

Until then, here’s a summary of today’s events, by my colleague Nick Fletcher:

The FTSE 100 has ended a tumultuous year at an all-time high, boosted by a 
surge in mining companies and dollar earners and hopes ofa spending spree by US 
president-elect Donald Trump. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/10/donald-trump-1-trillion-infrastructure-pledge-american-investors>

Britain’s blue chip index closed a shortened trading day at 7,142.83, up 22.57 
points, beating the previous peak of 7,129.82 set in October. The record came 
as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row.

The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding £232bn to the value 
of Britain’s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013.

It came despite the shocks of the Brexit referendum vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic>
 and Trump’s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a 
slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China.

The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate 
the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with 
Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the 
prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration 
sparked the revival, whilethe 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in 
June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears>
 has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, 
sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 
2008.

But in dollar terms the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, owing to 
the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance ofFTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 companies with more than 70% of 
their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year. But those with 70% of 
their business in the UK were down 6%.

KPMG’s Yael Selfin said:

“Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a £226bn rise in the value of the 
KPMG Non-UK50 and a £24bn loss for their domestic equivalent.”

Despite Brexit, the FTSE 100 was the best-performing European market, as 
continuing worries about the eurozone,the banking problems in Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/monte-dei-paschi-shortfall-8bn-ecb-says>
 and the prospect of elections in Germany and France next year limited gains.

Greece faces more angst in 2017

Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, 2016 is closing 
with the standoff between Athens and its creditors seemingly put to rest...but 
with no certainty that 2017 will finally resolve the country’s great economic 
crisis.

 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports

It’s been a busy time for the Greek finance minister. Over the course of the 
past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of 
diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece’s good intent, but 
persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is 
far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat.

This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought 
to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a 
one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on 
the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This 
letter appeased Greece’s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short 
term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece’s debt burden by around 20 
percentage points.

But this week Tskalatos’ mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals 
that Athens’ leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash 
government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being 
included in the ECB’s quantitative easing program, in early 2017.

On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis 
Tsipras’ mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government 
wouldn’t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a 
budget surplus next year. The alternate defence minister soon followed saying 
Athens would extend the special VAT exemption into 2018 “if the refugee crisis 
continues, and in my opinion it unfortunately will.”

Adding to the confusion, the government then announced that far from ruling 
out similar solidarity measures, Tskalalotos’ letter “opens the ways for 
similar ones in the future.”

The doublespeak has enhanced speculation that Greece could be heading for 
elections if Athens’ financial resuscitation plans don’t come to pass. This 
week an MRB poll showed that 63 percent of Greeks believed snap polls were 
likely in 2017 mostly because of growing differences between Tsipras’ 
administration and creditors.

Prognostications are a mugs game. But of one thing we can be sure: the Greek 
crisis will continue – and we will be here to report it!

European stock markets are ending 2016 with something of a whimper.

The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 biggest listed companies in Europe, 
has lost around 1% this year.

This chart, from Bloomberg 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/european-stocks-are-little-changed-on-final-trading-day-of-2016?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social>
, shows how European shares slid sharply in January and February (when worries 
over China rocked market), and then had a nasty dose of Brexit-itis in the 
summer.

UK share prices have also benefitted from the largely robust economic data 
since the Brexit vote on June 23rd.

Britain’s economy grew by 0.6% in July-September, matching the growth rate in 
the three month’s before the referendum. This refusal to buckle under the 
uncertainty created by Brexit has encouraged the City to pile into shares.

Yael Selfin, head of macroeconomics at KPMG UK, explains (via Reuters)

“The latest GDP figures point to a strong UK economy which has probably 
accounted for some of the pick-up in equity prices overall since the 
referendum.”

FTSE record high: What the experts say

I don’t want to sound alarmist, but the last time the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 hit a record high on the last 
day of the year was 1999.

That was swiftly followed by the dot-com crash, and a major slump in shares - 
with the FTSE 100 not recovering its losses until 2015.

Tony Cross, communications director for the Social Stock Exchange (SSX) 
<http://socialstockexchange.com/>, remembers it:

Tony Cross (@SSXideas) 
@KatieAllenGdn <https://twitter.com/KatieAllenGdn> @graemewearden 
<https://twitter.com/graemewearden> @guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> 
anyone else remember last time ftse100 hit all time highs on last day of 
year??? Wasn't a pretty Q1

On the upside, this rally is good for pension pots:
Joe B (@Joe_Trading) 
The FTSE 100 closing the year at all-time high.. at the least pension funds 
will recoup some returns. What does 2017 have for us?

 Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, predicts that markets will be lively 
next year - especially as the US has just expelled a bunch of Russian diplomats:

With Obama’s foot already out the door, it is clear that he is happy to speak 
out against the likes of Israel and Russia without fear of dealing with the 
repercussions. What is not clear is how things will pan out once the 
pro-Russian Trump comes into power. Should Trump immediately reverse this 
week’s measures, it would not only say that he places little confidence in his 
own security services, but also shows that Russia can essentially do what they 
want without the chance of being reprimanded.

US futures have edged off overnight highs..... It looks like a quiet end to a 
very busy year, but 2017 certainly promises to be just as eventful.

The Press Association also point out that the slump in sterling since the 
Brexit vote has driven shares up:

The pound’s fall, triggered by Britain’s decision to quit the EU, has proved 
beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index as many tend to 
benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are 
stronger than sterling.

On Friday, sterling slumped further against the euro, falling 0.1% to 1.16 
euro. The pound was up 0.5% against the dollar at 1.23.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> remains 18% down 
against the greenback and 11% lower versus the euro since the Brexit vote in 
June.

Or in other words....

The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 250, which includes 
smaller UK-focused companies, ended 2016 up 3.7% for the year.

The FTSE 250 is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy than the 
international giants that make up the FTSE 100.

But it is also flattered by the pound’s tumble against other currencies since 
June’s referendum.

FTSE 100 posts hattrick of record highs

NEWSFLASH: The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 has closed 
for 2016 at a new record high, after sudden last-minute rally.
Press Association (@PA) 
#Breaking <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Breaking?src=hash> The FTSE 100 Index 
has closed at a new all-time high of 7,142.83pic.twitter.com/BBdnIeYX9k 
<https://t.co/BBdnIeYX9k>
 <https://twitter.com/PA/status/814814344181665792> December 30, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/PA/status/814814344181665792> 
The blue-chip index gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7142 points. 
That’s a new intraday high, and its third closing high in as many days.

This means the FTSE has rallied by 14.4% this year, in spite of the political 
turbulence at home and abroad.

FTSE 100 hits new alltime intraday high

BOOM! The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 just hit a new 
all-time high.

It touched 7132 points, as City traders make one final push before the close 
of trading.

That’s just above the previous intraday high of 7129, and means the index has 
risen around 14% this year.

The Bond Vigilante team at M&G reckon 2017 will be a testing time for Europe, 
as public anger about austerity bubbles away.

They write 
<https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/panoramic-outlook/2017-a-whole-new-ball-game/>
:

Nowhere have the subjects of fiscal austerity and rising inequality been as 
relevant as in Europe today. Stubbornly high unemployment rates combined with 
declining living standards have contributed to rising levels of civil and 
political instability over the past year. Populist and nationalist parties have 
been able to capitalise on this phenomenon and raise massive amounts of support 
from exasperated European citizens.

In Spain, for example, a caretaker government had to be put in place after two 
consecutive presidential elections failed to designate a clear winner. France 
will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential 
election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to 
take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to 
its first victory. While this would require a vast – and unlikely – swing from 
voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties 
globally is not one to be underestimated. Equally, traditional polling methods 
seem to struggle to capture the swing to the hard right that is underway.

These mounting pressures could not come at a worse time for Europe, whose 2017 
political schedule looks particularly packed...
 Photograph: M&G 
The extra difficulty for Europe is that its capacity to boost growth and 
employment via increased public and infrastructure spending and tax cuts is 
more limited than other economies, for two main reasons. First of all, high 
levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% 
target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to 
rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to 
print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires 
each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain 
viable.

For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes 
from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to 
improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while 
preserving the EU’s balance sheet. This can only be achieved by implementing 
the right mix of pro-growth structural reforms, but some tough times could 
still lie ahead.

That’s a small part of their predictions for 2017, which they say will be “a 
whole new ball game”.Worth a read

Investors will be toasting their successes this weekend, or grumbling bitterly 
abouthaving backed the wrong horses.

London’s stock market wasn’t the best place to put your money this year, 
despite theFTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100’s 13% leap.

Brazil’s stock market outperformed all rivals this year, according to 
Bloomberg data. That’s quite staggering, giventhe country has suffered a 
historically bad recession, rising unemployment 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/04/news/economy/brazil-economy-jobs-crisis/>, 
plus political turmoil and the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff.

Investors are betting that Brazil can claw its way back to growth, and that 
Rousseff’s successor, Michel Temer, will push through structural reforms.

Richard Stone, chief executive of stockbroking firm The Share Centre 
<https://www.share.com/?gclid=CNOXiqXjm9ECFW4A0wodHbkHpg>, has stuck his neck 
out with three predictions for 2017.

He reckons that the UK economy will outperform expectations, leading to the 
first interest rate rise since the financial crisis.

Stone says:


Unemployment remains low and employment is at near record levels. The boost 
from Sterling’s devaluation will continue to feed through – particularly for 
exporters to the EU who still have unfettered access to the single market but 
with substantially lower pricing in Euro terms. Inflation will rise, in part as 
a function of the impact of weakerSterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling>, but also as a result of the 
relatively tight labour market. Without substantial changes in productivity 
this will likely start to feed through into higher wages.

In Europe, he expects populist parties to increase their support - but not win 
power in Germany, France or the Netherlands.

“The level of disaffection in Europe is just as strong as it is elsewhere in 
the world, but the political and voting systems are very different. This means 
that those expressions of discontent are less likely to have the same success 
as they did in the binary choices that were presented by the Brexit and US 
Presidential Election votes.

In particular the coalition nature of politics in the Netherlands and Germany, 
along with the run-off process for the French Presidential election, mean that 
although extremist politicians may make advances their ability to gain power is 
limited – so I would not expect any great surprises.


And he fears that US relations with China will deteriorate under president 
Trump:

“January will see the inauguration of President Donald Trump and we will then 
start to see how his policy pronouncements play out. In the US the power of the 
President is constrained by the checks and balances inherent in the system, 
particularly in Congress. However, the President still has significant sway on 
foreign policy and trade.

“Relations with China – if the current mood music is to be believed – may 
become more difficult. This in turn could impact trade. Conversely relations 
with Russia may soften which might alleviate some of the political tensions 
currently on the global stage.

Stone also suspects Beijing may have to devalue the renminbi next year in an 
attempt to stimulate growth, which might cause market volatility (as it did in 
August 2015).

The City of London has officially shut down for another year.

Traders are heading to their favourite pubs and wine bars to mark the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100’s record high, and to ponder 
what perils and delights 2017 bring.

It’s likely to be another white-knuckle ride, with Trump in the White House, 
Marine Le Pen trying to become French president, China battlign to avoid a hard 
landing, and Britain facing the sticky problem of negotiating an exit from the 
EU.

That will probably add up to more market volatility -- this week’s gentle 
trading will soon be just a memory.

Until then, here’s a summary of today’s events, by my colleague Nick Fletcher:

The FTSE 100 has ended a tumultuous year at an all-time high, boosted by a 
surge in mining companies and dollar earners and hopes ofa spending spree by US 
president-elect Donald Trump. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/10/donald-trump-1-trillion-infrastructure-pledge-american-investors>

Britain’s blue chip index closed a shortened trading day at 7,142.83, up 22.57 
points, beating the previous peak of 7,129.82 set in October. The record came 
as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row.

The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding £232bn to the value 
of Britain’s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013.

It came despite the shocks of the Brexit referendum vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic>
 and Trump’s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a 
slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China.

The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate 
the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with 
Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the 
prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration 
sparked the revival, whilethe 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in 
June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears>
 has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, 
sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 
2008.

But in dollar terms the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, owing to 
the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance ofFTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 companies with more than 70% of 
their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year. But those with 70% of 
their business in the UK were down 6%.

KPMG’s Yael Selfin said:

“Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a £226bn rise in the value of the 
KPMG Non-UK50 and a £24bn loss for their domestic equivalent.”

Despite Brexit, the FTSE 100 was the best-performing European market, as 
continuing worries about the eurozone,the banking problems in Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/monte-dei-paschi-shortfall-8bn-ecb-says>
 and the prospect of elections in Germany and France next year limited gains.

Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, 2016 is closing 
with the standoff between Athens and its creditors seemingly put to rest...but 
with no certainty that 2017 will finally resolve the country’s great economic 
crisis.

 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports

It’s been a busy time for the Greek finance minister. Over the course of the 
past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of 
diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece’s good intent, but 
persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is 
far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat.

This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought 
to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a 
one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on 
the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This 
letter appeased Greece’s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short 
term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece’s debt burden by around 20 
percentage points.

But this week Tskalatos’ mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals 
that Athens’ leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash 
government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being 
included in the ECB’s quantitative easing program, in early 2017.

On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis 
Tsipras’ mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government 
wouldn’t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a 
budget surplus next year. The alternate defence minister soon followed saying 
Athens would extend the special VAT exemption into 2018 “if the refugee crisis 
continues, and in my opinion it unfortunately will.”

Adding to the confusion, the government then announced that far from ruling 
out similar solidarity measures, Tskalalotos’ letter “opens the ways for 
similar ones in the future.”

The doublespeak has enhanced speculation that Greece could be heading for 
elections if Athens’ financial resuscitation plans don’t come to pass. This 
week an MRB poll showed that 63 percent of Greeks believed snap polls were 
likely in 2017 mostly because of growing differences between Tsipras’ 
administration and creditors.

Prognostications are a mugs game. But of one thing we can be sure: the Greek 
crisis will continue – and we will be here to report it!
 
European stock markets are ending 2016 with something of a whimper.

The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 biggest listed companies in Europe, 
has lost around 1% this year.

This chart, from Bloomberg 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/european-stocks-are-little-changed-on-final-trading-day-of-2016?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social>
, shows how European shares slid sharply in January and February (when worries 
over China rocked market), and then had a nasty dose of Brexit-itis in the 
summer.

Another way of looking at things....
Peter Spence (@Pete_Spence) 
The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> is up for 2016, but not 
as much as the pound is down. The FTSE's expected profits are worth less as a 
claim on global resources.

UK share prices have also benefitted from the largely robust economic data 
since the Brexit vote on June 23rd.

Britain’s economy grew by 0.6% in July-September, matching the growth rate in 
the three month’s before the referendum. This refusal to buckle under the 
uncertainty created by Brexit has encouraged the City to pile into shares.

Yael Selfin, head of macroeconomics at KPMG UK, explains (via Reuters)

“The latest GDP figures point to a strong UK economy which has probably 
accounted for some of the pick-up in equity prices overall since the 
referendum.”
 
I don’t want to sound alarmist, but the last time the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 hit a record high on the last 
day of the year was 1999.

That was swiftly followed by the dot-com crash, and a major slump in shares - 
with the FTSE 100 not recovering its losses until 2015.

On the upside, this rally is good for pension pots:

 Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, predicts that markets will be lively 
next year - especially as the US has just expelled a bunch of Russian diplomats:

With Obama’s foot already out the door, it is clear that he is happy to speak 
out against the likes of Israel and Russia without fear of dealing with the 
repercussions. What is not clear is how things will pan out once the 
pro-Russian Trump comes into power. Should Trump immediately reverse this 
week’s measures, it would not only say that he places little confidence in his 
own security services, but also shows that Russia can essentially do what they 
want without the chance of being reprimanded.

US futures have edged off overnight highs..... It looks like a quiet end to a 
very busy year, but 2017 certainly promises to be just as eventful.
 
The pound and the FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 have 
largely moved in opposite directions since Britain voted to leave the EU:

(thanks to PA’s Ian Jones)
 
The Press Association also point out that the slump in sterling since the 
Brexit vote has driven shares up:

The pound’s fall, triggered by Britain’s decision to quit the EU, has proved 
beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index as many tend to 
benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are 
stronger than sterling.

On Friday, sterling slumped further against the euro, falling 0.1% to 1.16 
euro. The pound was up 0.5% against the dollar at 1.23.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> remains 18% down 
against the greenback and 11% lower versus the euro since the Brexit vote in 
June.

Or in other words....

Mining companies had a great year.

Share prices across the sector doubled in 2016, as the prices of commodities 
such as iron ore, copper and nickel rallied.
Joe Lynam BBC Biz (@BBC_Joe_Lynam) 
One of the major reasons for the surging FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> has been mining firms: Anglo 
American up 286% this year, BHP up 71%, Rio Tinto 59%

The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 250, which includes 
smaller UK-focused companies, ended 2016 up 3.7% for the year.

The FTSE 250 is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy than the 
international giants that make up the FTSE 100.

But it is also flattered by the pound’s tumble against other currencies since 
June’s referendum.
 
NEWSFLASH: The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 has closed

The blue-chip index gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7142 points. 
That’s a new intraday high, and its third closing high in as many days.

This means the FTSE has rallied by 14.4% this year, in spite of the political 
turbulence at home and abroad.

Details and reaction to follow....
 
BOOM! The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 just hit a new 
all-time high.

It touched 7132 points, as City traders make one final push before the close 
of trading.

That’s just above the previous intraday high of 7129, and means the index has 
risen around 14% this year.
 
With 10 minutes to go until the closing bell, the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 is recovering its early losses!

The blue-chip index is now UP 2 points on the day, at 7122. If it ends over 
7121, it will be a new closing high - the third in as many days...
 
The Bond Vigilante team at M&G reckon 2017 will be a testing time for Europe, 
as public anger about austerity bubbles away.

They write 
<https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/panoramic-outlook/2017-a-whole-new-ball-game/>
:

Nowhere have the subjects of fiscal austerity and rising inequality been as 
relevant as in Europe today. Stubbornly high unemployment rates combined with 
declining living standards have contributed to rising levels of civil and 
political instability over the past year. Populist and nationalist parties have 
been able to capitalise on this phenomenon and raise massive amounts of support 
from exasperated European citizens.

In Spain, for example, a caretaker government had to be put in place after two 
consecutive presidential elections failed to designate a clear winner. France 
will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential 
election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to 
take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to 
its first victory. While this would require a vast – and unlikely – swing from 
voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties 
globally is not one to be underestimated. Equally, traditional polling methods 
seem to struggle to capture the swing to the hard right that is underway.

These mounting pressures could not come at a worse time for Europe, whose 2017 
political schedule looks particularly packed...
 Photograph: M&G 
The extra difficulty for Europe is that its capacity to boost growth and 
employment via increased public and infrastructure spending and tax cuts is 
more limited than other economies, for two main reasons. First of all, high 
levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% 
target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to 
rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to 
print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires 
each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain 
viable.

For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes 
from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to 
improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while 
preserving the EU’s balance sheet. This can only be achieved by implementing 
the right mix of pro-growth structural reforms, but some tough times could 
still lie ahead.

That’s a small part of their predictions for 2017, which they say will be “a 
whole new ball game”.Worth a read

Investors will be toasting their successes this weekend, or grumbling bitterly 
abouthaving backed the wrong horses.

London’s stock market wasn’t the best place to put your money this year, 
despite theFTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100’s 13% leap.

Brazil’s stock market outperformed all rivals this year, according to 
Bloomberg data. That’s quite staggering, giventhe country has suffered a 
historically bad recession, rising unemployment 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/04/news/economy/brazil-economy-jobs-crisis/>, 
plus political turmoil and the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff.

Investors are betting that Brazil can claw its way back to growth, and that 
Rousseff’s successor, Michel Temer, will push through structural reforms.

Richard Stone, chief executive of stockbroking firm The Share Centre 
<https://www.share.com/?gclid=CNOXiqXjm9ECFW4A0wodHbkHpg>, has stuck his neck 
out with three predictions for 2017.

He reckons that the UK economy will outperform expectations, leading to the 
first interest rate rise since the financial crisis.

Stone says:


Unemployment remains low and employment is at near record levels. The boost 
from Sterling’s devaluation will continue to feed through – particularly for 
exporters to the EU who still have unfettered access to the single market but 
with substantially lower pricing in Euro terms. Inflation will rise, in part as 
a function of the impact of weakerSterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling>, but also as a result of the 
relatively tight labour market. Without substantial changes in productivity 
this will likely start to feed through into higher wages.

In Europe, he expects populist parties to increase their support - but not win 
power in Germany, France or the Netherlands.

“The level of disaffection in Europe is just as strong as it is elsewhere in 
the world, but the political and voting systems are very different. This means 
that those expressions of discontent are less likely to have the same success 
as they did in the binary choices that were presented by the Brexit and US 
Presidential Election votes.

In particular the coalition nature of politics in the Netherlands and Germany, 
along with the run-off process for the French Presidential election, mean that 
although extremist politicians may make advances their ability to gain power is 
limited – so I would not expect any great surprises.


And he fears that US relations with China will deteriorate under president 
Trump:

“January will see the inauguration of President Donald Trump and we will then 
start to see how his policy pronouncements play out. In the US the power of the 
President is constrained by the checks and balances inherent in the system, 
particularly in Congress. However, the President still has significant sway on 
foreign policy and trade.

“Relations with China – if the current mood music is to be believed – may 
become more difficult. This in turn could impact trade. Conversely relations 
with Russia may soften which might alleviate some of the political tensions 
currently on the global stage.

Stone also suspects Beijing may have to devalue the renminbi next year in an 
attempt to stimulate growth, which might cause market volatility (as it did in 
August 2015).
