Australians’ diets are worse than first thought, scoring only 59 out of 100 in 
the largest ever survey of its kind.

The 2016 CSIRO Healthy Diet Score 
<http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Health/CSIRO-diets/CSIRO-Healthy-Diet-Score> 
canvassed the dietary habits of more than 86,500 adults across the country over 
a 12-month period, surveying more than double the amount of people as last 
year, when the nation scored 61 points.

“We have an image of being fit and healthy, but with a collective diet score 
of 59 out of 100, that image could be very different unless we act now,”CSIRO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/csiro> research director Manny 
Noakes said.

On the range of measures surveyed, Australians scored best on fruit 
consumption, with 49% meeting the recommended intake.

Of greatest concern was consumption of junk foods.

Just 1% of respondents ate none, while more than one in three reported eating 
more than the recommended maximum allowance.

“We find that there is often a tendency to underreport on certain types of 
food, so in all likelihood that figure is even higher,” Noakes said.

Women had better nutritional levels than men, scoring 60 out of 100 versus 56, 
and one in three adults actively avoid at least one of gluten, dairy or meat.

Construction workers are among those with the poorest diets, while public 
servants, real estate agents and health industry workers reported some of the 
healthiest eating patterns.

Noakes urged Australians to “halve the bad and double the good”.

“In other words, halve the amount of discretionary food you eat and double 
your vegetable intake,” she said.

“If we can raise our collective score by just over 10 points, we help 
Australia mitigate against the growing rates of obesity and lifestyle diseases 
such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and a third of all cancers.”
