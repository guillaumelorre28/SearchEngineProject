Last week, Ben Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/benaffleck> posted a 
video of the suited-and-booted character who is to be his main antagonist in 
the new standalone Batman movie. Deathstroke is an assassin and mercenary who 
first appeared in the comics in 1980 and first battled Batman in 1991 
(Deathstroke won).
