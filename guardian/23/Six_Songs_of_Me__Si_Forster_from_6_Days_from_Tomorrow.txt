What was the first song you ever bought?

Adam and the Ants 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/75d4f194-969c-4538-b789-742f3eb3d02c> – 
Stand and Deliver
I bought this from Boots in Stockport, at a time when it seemed like 
everywhere sold records. I still have it, too. I was a bit too young for punk 
and what followed (I would have been 10 at this point), but this sort of 
poptastic version of it appealed to me greatly, and I spent many days with a 
white painted stripe across my nose, much to the disappointment of my dad.

What song always gets you dancing?

New Order <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/neworder> – Blue Monday
A slight lie as I have neither the ability nor the inclination to dance (when 
I try, extra knees seem to appear unbidden). I do remember having a drunken 
lurch to this in a club in Tokyo at something o'clock in the morning of my 30th 
birthday back whenever that was, so it qualifies by default.

What song takes you back to your childhood?

Hot Butter 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/f7ea1e79-21bf-4dc9-a427-d2c43f5aadd0> – 
Popcorn
This is my earliest memory, going back to when I was a toddler. This song had 
the magical effect of transforming me from a screaming, miniature tyrant into a 
grinning, dancing idiot. It still makes me grin now, and it remains a calming 
influence to my occasional tyrannical hissy fits. Doesn't make me dance any 
more (see above), and "idiot" is standard issue with me now anyway, possibly 
due to overexposure to this.

What is your perfect love song?

Dragonflies 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/4fe63408-4340-4418-8f1f-e0ac1a5611fa> – 
Red House Painters
Yeah, a bit miserable. But it's achingly beautiful with it, and nobody said 
that the perfect love song had to have a happy ending. I could have picked 
anything off Red House Painters' Rollercoaster album for reasons too personal 
to divulge, but I plumped for this one as it applies to the memories of not 
one, but several "where are they now?" reminiscences.

What song would you want at your funeral?

Boards of Canada <http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/sep/18/shopping3>
 –Dayvan Cowboy
I've absolutely no religious leanings and am not expecting to be swept off 
into any sort of afterlife, but on the off–chance that I do get carted off to 
some sort of suburban Valhalla, this is the perfect way to go. It's chilled, it 
wordlessly suggests a journey, and it'd probably raise fewer eyebrows among the 
sparse congregation (and later awkward reunions, should certain theories about 
death be proved correct after all) than Hüsker Dü's Never Talking to You Again, 
which was my original choice.

Time for the encore. One last song that makes you, you

Borracho 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/d4874652-d712-4f6b-90dd-5971d5295554> – 
Mark Lanegan
I cheated. I asked my friends. I was suggested this as being "me". One of my 
favourite songs from my favourite album by my favourite artist, it's a song 
that bounces between calm and rage, redemption and rejection, dark and light. I 
suppose this mean that my friends think I'm a bit ambivalent. Or maybe just a 
bit of a lush. Either way, it's a song from a time when music was absolutely 
everything to me, when seemingly every new thing was absolutely brilliant and I 
couldn't be happier with this choice.
