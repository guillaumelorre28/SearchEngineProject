Aga Foodservices, maker of the Aga Rayburn cooking ranges, posted a pre-tax 
profit of £33.5m yesterday and told shareholders to expect a 20% rise in 
dividends.

The chief executive, William McGrath, said the preliminary results had been 
achieved on the back of a series of acquisitions in Europe and North America.

"The key objective in 2002 was to create a framework for international growth, 
which has been achieved by creating a visible presence in the US and Europe, as 
well as strengthening our position in the UK," he said.

Pre-tax profits were up 16% to December 2002, from £29m in 2001, delivering a 
dividend up by 1p to 6p. Turnover rose to £323.3m from £209.8m and the group 
ended the year with a cash position of over £55m, despite its acquisitions.

Mr McGrath ruled out any shareholder windfall. 

In the course of last year Aga acquired Domain, a US east coast furniture 
retailer, and in France it increased its interest in Grange, a Lyon-based 
furniture distributor and manufacturer, from 27% to 40%. The group also 
reported a major success in its "Project 10,000" scheme, designed to take sales 
of Aga-branded cookers to over 10,000 a year by 2003. Last year sales broke 
through the 9,000 point.

In the food services market, Aga acquired Belshaw, the Seattle-based doughnut 
equipment manufacturer, for $24m(£15.3m) securing its position in North America.

In continental Europe, Aga acquired Bongard, paying 55m euros (£37m). The 
bakery equipment manufacturer is market leader in France and the Benelux 
countries and has strong positions in Italy and Spain.

Aga shares closed down 2.5p at 189p.
