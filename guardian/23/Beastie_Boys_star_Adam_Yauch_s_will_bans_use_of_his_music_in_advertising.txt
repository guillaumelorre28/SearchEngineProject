Adam Yauch <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-yauch>'s image will never 
be used to sell you anything. According to his will, filed in court this week, 
the lateBeastie Boy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beastie-boys>'s image, 
music and art are never to be licensed for advertising.

Details of Yauch's will emerged on Tuesday, when his estate filed documents in 
Manhattan surrogate court. The rapper and film-maker, who died in May,
reportedly instructed his estate 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19206509> to keep his work – and 
even his face – out of any future advertisements.

Yauch's will also states that his fortune, listed at $6.4m (£4.1m), be placed 
in trust for his wife and

daughter. Yauch's wife, the Tibetan rights activist Dechen Yauch, will manage 
his artistic property (and has a right to sell it).

While Yauch's instructions are clear with regard to his own image and music, 
it's not clear how these wishes affect the Beastie Boys' legal right to license 
the group's songs for advertisements. Earlier this week, the band's surviving 
membersopened a lawsuit against Monster energy drink

, accusing them their music without permission.

Yauch, often referred to as MCA, died from cancer. He was 47.
