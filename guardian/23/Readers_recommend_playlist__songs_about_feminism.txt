. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the weekly format of the Readers 
recommend series at the end of the piece.


Of all the suggestions for this topic, the fictional Ophelia, a victim of what 
would later be called “chauvinism”, stretches farthest back in time. She and 
Hamlet were advised against marriage by family and court, despite their mutual 
passion. Did Hamlet rape her? Was she pregnant when she fell into the stream 
and drowned? Something drove her mad. When handing out flowers she saved rue 
for herself. Rue for regret; rue with powerful abortive properties. She was 
driven to her death by those twin bastards custom and culture.Natalie Merchant 
brilliantly captures the character’s mindset in herOphelia

Women’s suffrage played a crucial role in the development of 20th-century 
Britain. Where would we be without women in government, commerce and the arts?
Dame Ethel Smyth, with her comfortable life as a respected and successful 
composer, placed herself at the sharp end of the movement and was jailed for 
her beliefs. Women marched and sang outside Holloway prison, as the redoubtable 
dame, through her window, conducted them with a toothbrush. Ms Smyth’sThe March 
of the Women <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCtGkCg7trY> (to words by Cicely 
Hamilton) became the rousing anthem of Women’s suffrage.

A rather mournful song which seems to extol feminist values but ends with a 
suggestion that this course could lead to madness.Ophelia 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GryxQEhYRr4> by Natalie Merchant The lyrics 
include the following:
Ophelia was a rebel girl
A blue stocking suffragette
Who remedied society
Between her cigarettes 

and similar lines but ends with the ominous 

Ophelia's mind went wandering
You'd wonder where she'd gone
Through secret doors
Down corridors
She'd wander them alone
All alone...

“Now this is a song to celebrate the conscious liberation of the female 
state,” declares a righteous Annie Lennox. The band couldn’t get Tina Turner 
for theSisters Are Doin’ It for Themselves 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtUWs6muGzg> duet, so they had to settle for 
Aretha instead! A trio of Heartbreakers made up the numbers andEurythmics and 
Aretha Franklin steamrollered into the charts.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, not an obvious feminist, wrote in Emile (1762), “In the 
union of the sexes, each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the 
same way.” The Au Pairs in their driving post-punk masterpiece, It’s Obvious 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjbBr1_rSD8>, distilled this thought into the 
truism, “You’re equal, but different, it’s obvious.”

Some people can get confused about love, even women. But when it’s a man 
attempting to construct a possessive relationship, a woman could find herself 
suffering. InCertainly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_V_aJJcyD4>, Erykah 
Badu gazes steadfastly into the face of male power and refuses to submit. The 
relationship she didn’t ask for has to be conducted on her own terms. “You know 
that the world is mine. When I wake up I don’t need nobody telling me the time. 
The world is mine, mine, mine. I don’t need no little rollin’ over looking 
after me!”

Sister Carol is a sister who did it for herself with what severin described as 
“rastafeminism” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-feminism#comment-72373349>
. InCall Mi Sister Carol <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kogjfgphlUk> she 
asserts herself alongside Jamaica’s rude boy culture, demanding recognition for 
her own contribution to society, as a mother, musician and educator.

The Slits’ Typical Girls <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyXGblps64M> hurls 
cliches and stereotypes away from the stage as if discarding detritus. There is 
a bad smell in the air, and it’s not them. It’s the commercialisation of 
femininity, and the marketing ploys designed to hook vulnerable minds into the 
belief that only a typical girl will wind up with a typical boy. Not only are 
The Slits not having any of it, they are mocking the very idea.

It’s hard to imagine Julian Cope firing a Tommy gun into the massed lines of 
the establishment in the cause of a feminist revolution. But it’s not that his 
heart isn’t in the right place – as hisMilitant Feminist Dream 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4vUjSIsks4> amply demonstrates. He sees a 
gender war in front of him, and as he believes we’re only here once and had 
better get it right, he tools up. Right on, Jools.

Been a Son <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD7qOakvqp8> has Nirvana 
apparently channelling the Byrds. But this isn’t a song that Roger McGuinn and 
co could ever have written. Kurt Cobain enters character and holds up for our 
appraisal the sick mind of a misogynous father who actively wishes his baby 
daughter hadn’t been born.Shoulda been a son ...


Alice Cooper addresses the issue of violence toward women with some effect in 
his powerful and much admiredOnly Women Bleed 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yALNSd0iME>. His penchant for theatrics seeps 
into the lyrics to lend even greater depth to this rock masterpiece.

Here’s irony: Fela Kuti, the late arch-patriarch proud to be described as 
sexist <http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140818-fela-kuti-africas-bob-marley>
, inadvertently wrote a feminist anthem for African women,Lady 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSVhz1laO5w>. Even Angelique Kidjo is involved 
in a new version. Whilst setting out his ground rules for the servility of 
Nigerian women, he ended up celebrating the fact that those very women 
traditionally stand up for their rights and won’t be pushed around by their 
men. He winds up looking askance at the situation with a sense of grudging 
admiration.

"Glass City" by War On Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> 
concerns unequal pay.

Is the wage gap
Not big enough
To get your ego through

http://youtu.be/yDOSzbQ1IzQ <http://youtu.be/yDOSzbQ1IzQ>

Even when women manage to break through the glass ceiling there’s still the 
prospect of dealing with antiquated attitudes in the workplace. There are still 
men around who don’t believe that a woman should receive equal pay for the same 
job.War On Women direct their well-aimed rant, Glass City 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDOSzbQ1IzQ>, at those who bandy about 
fact-free anecdotes about women making more money than they do.
