Beckham, who ran afoul of the NFL’s non-conforming uniform policy even though 
he wore them only during warm-ups and not Sunday’s 17-6 win over the Detroit 
Lions, went on to accuse the NFL of a double standard when Dallas Cowboys 
running back Ezekiel Elliott was spared a fine afterjumping into an oversize

“I got fined 18k for Craig Sager cleats that were auction off the cleats to 
the highest bidder and donating the proceeds to his cancer research,” Beckham 
wrote on Wednesday in an Instagram post. “18k like it’s nothing to them, no 
warning to take them off or anything noTHING!”

The remarks were in response to a post by Washington wide receiver DeSean 
Jackson, who was apparently also fined by the league for cleats that failed to 
conform to the league’s tightly enforced standards.

Beckham, who is in the third year of a four-year, $10.4m contract and will 
earn a base salary of $1.36m this season, was selected to his third Pro Bowl 
this week after overcoming aslow start to the 2016 campaign
