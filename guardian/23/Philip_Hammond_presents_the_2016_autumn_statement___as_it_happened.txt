Politics summary: long-term economic plan, RIP

Andrew Sparrow

For six years George Osborne, as chancellor, David Cameron and all their 
ministerial colleagues were able to bulldoze through opposition to their 
policies by asserting that they had a “long-term economic plan”. It passed the 
test of all good soundbites by becoming so familiar as to be groan-inducing. In 
some respects the term was misleading, because Osborne missed his targets and 
had to rejig his plans, but the claim that the Conservatives were on a path 
towards eliminating the deficit seemed to impress the public and this strategy 
helped Osborne and Cameron to win the 2015 general election.

Today Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> 
consigned the LTEP to the dustbin. In truth, it collapsed the day the UK voted 
for Brexit but Hammond had to tell MPs that the EU referendum result has 
blasted a huge hole in the national finances and he has all but abandoned any 
hope of getting the budget into surplus on his watch. Osborne’s targets have 
been abandoned, the government plans to carry on borrowing and spending (the 
autumn statement envisages a fiscal loosening of almost £9bn by 2021-22) and, 
although the Treasury hopes to balance the budget in the 2020s, it won’t say 
when this might happen. All of this is quite sensible, but it is not the 
economic prudence that won the Tories the 2015 election.

In the past governing parties have been consigned to opposition for a decade 
or more for economic mismanagement on this scale. But there is no sign of this 
happening to the Conservatives. Cameron did not ask the country to vote for 
Brexit, and nor did Hammond, or Theresa May. Hammond’s political authority 
remains intact.

Yet the autumn statement will have disappointed those who expected May’s 
“Jam”-focused government to be quite different from Cameron’s. When she became 
prime minister in July May said she would focus her attention on those just 
about managing (the Jams). Today was her first big chance to strike out in a 
new direction but, although the statement contained some progressive measures 
(eg universal credit and letting agents’ fees), what was striking was the 
continuity with Osborne, not the contrast. How much difference has she made? 
Just 7%, according to a Resolution Foundation analysis. (See5.33pm.)

That’s all from us for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Economics summary: Markets take higher borrowing in their stride

Graeme Wearden

Philip Hammond buried the government’s goal of balancing the nation’s budget 
in this parliament today -- and the financial markets didn’t bat an eyelid.

The pound has jumped by one percent against the euro today, to €1.18 -- a 
ten-week high. It’s also higher against the dollar tonight too, up half a cent 
at $1.245.

That’s might surprise you -- surely the news that Britain needs to borrow an 
extra £122bn to rise out the Brexit storm should spark a sterling crisis?

But no. The City is welcoming Hammond’s new spending plans. OK, today’s 
figures are small potatoes compared to Donald Trump’s $1trn infrastructure plan 
-- but they should mean growth isn’t as weak over the next few years as feared.

Hammond took some pleasure in pointing out that Britain is still expected to 
grow as fast as its eurozone rivals next year, even after today’s downgrade to 
1.4%.
Rupert Seggins (@Rupert_Seggins) 
The better OBR forecast - fan chart says an 80% chance that GDP growth is 
between -0.2% and +2.9% in 2017. 20% chance between 1.1% & 1.7%.

The £122bn of extra borrowing announced today may take some swallowing, though.
UK borrowing costs have risen today, as traders anticipate more UK gilts 
hitting the market (bond yields rise when prices fall).

We’ve also seen that almost half that fiscal black hole is directly due to 
Brexit, with the OBR saying leaving the EU will cost £58.7bn over the next five 
years. That includes a £16bn hit from lower migration (see earlier chart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-2016-philip-hammond-brexit-growth-deficit-housing-jams-universal-credit-minimum-wage-live?page=with:block-5835aa54e4b0cc60d3476321#block-5835aa54e4b0cc60d3476321>
). Something to consider when policymakers weigh up the cost of a hard Brexit, 
vs one that gives better access to the single market.
Torsten Bell (@TorstenBell) 
OBR says that half of the extra £122bn borrowing comes from Brexit (£59bn). Of 
rest £26bn is other forecast changes & £15bn capital spending

The public face an earnings squeeze over the next two years, when inflation is 
likely to rise nearly as fast as earnings.

But the FT’s Sarah O’Connor points out that we might avoid falling real wages, 
if the OBR isn’t too optimistic...
Sarah O'Connor (@sarahoconnor_)

And the big picture hasn’t really changed; Britain’s economy is still 
suffering from low productivity and a debt hangover from the 2008 crisis, with 
Brexit casting another shadow.


Richard Buxton, head of UK Equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, warns that 
we should remain cautious:


In my view, substantial risks to the UK’s economy remain, bringing into 
question an implicit suggestion that animal spirits will suddenly rise in the 
years ahead.

As it stands, the country continues to face the same uncertainties that 
triggered such a sharp decline in the value of sterling in the aftermath of the 
EU referendum vote.

During Referendum George Osborne warned that leaving EU = 500,000 job losses. 
Today's OBR says employment will rise by 500,000 by 2021.

Leave Means Leave has, curiously, chosen not to challenge the OBR analysis of 
the impact of Brexit in its autumn statement reaction (see5.44pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-2016-philip-hammond-brexit-growth-deficit-housing-jams-universal-credit-minimum-wage-live?page=with:block-5835d4fde4b0cc60d3476445#block-5835d4fde4b0cc60d3476445>
, but Patrick Minford, co-chair ofEconomists for Brexit, has taken it on. He 
has put out this statement.

The OBR’s report issued today contains a number of assumptions around the 
impact of Brexit which simply follows the path of countless other establishment 
bodies, which have assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the 
EU, based on bad economic policy-making . Whilst it acknowledges the fact that 
the decision of the government’s chosen path is uncertain, it then applies what 
amounts to an arbitrary Brexit penalty on the UK economy without any proper 
justification. Why does it assume lower productivity, a spending slowdown due 
to uncertainty and lower immigration?

The work of Economists for Brexit has shown in each of these cases the reverse 
to be true. Our forecasts show that there is a positive impact of being outside 
of the single market and embracing free trade under WTO rules, creating an 
additional 4% GDP over the long term; recent outturns for the second and third 
quarters have shown clearly that there is no uncertainty effect; and on 
immigration our estimates are that unskilled migrants cost a total of £6.6 
billion a year. Clearly, better control of unskilled workers, whilst continuing 
to encourage skilled migration can only have a positive economic impact. .

These bodies tried to forecast economic disaster based on uncertainty before, 
in the months leading up to and just after the referendum, when uncertainty was 
at its highest. Yet there is no sign that there was any economic effect. So it 
is illogical in the extreme to forecast further disaster owing to uncertainty, 
just as the picture is becoming clearer. Of course it is true that if bodies 
like the OBR push out continual gloomy statements, if Downing Street gives no 
direction and if, when it does take a lead, takes Britain down the worst 
possible economic path then all this could come true. But, just as they did in 
the spring and the summer, they are mistaking the very worst outcome for a 
sensible forecast.

Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says poor 
households faces a tough 2017, with inflation likely to devour wage rises.

Previously announced benefit cuts will wipe out the benefits announced today, 
Kumar explains:

“Many families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the 
reduction in the Universal Credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax 
personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to 
work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year.

A couple with two children each earning £25,000 a year will see a benefit of 
£588 a year from the income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will 
lose £1,308 from the benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work 
allowances.

John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation 
<https://www.cafonline.org/>, fears that charities will face an increased 
burden as economic growth slows....

“We know that during uncertain times charities are increasingly relied upon to 
support those in most need. In recent years charities have experienced rising 
demand for their services while resources have been increasingly stretched.

A round-up of thinktank reaction

Here is some reaction to the autumn statement from thinktanks.

From Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation


The big picture today is the new chancellor accepting a major increase in 
borrowing, partly off the back of the Brexit vote, and choosing to increase it 
further with an expensive but welcome increase in capital spending. The result 
is £122bn additional borrowing, with national debt reaching 90 per cent of GDP 
next year.

The outlook for family finances that lies behind the big growth and borrowing 
figures is also bleak, with average earnings set to be £830 lower by the end of 
the parliament than previously forecast.

Despite increasing borrowing elsewhere, the chancellor has left the big 
welfare cuts intact and chosen not to provide significant support for the just 
managing families that Theresa May has rightly said she is focused on.

The double whammy of lower earnings and benefit cuts mean that the poorest 
third of households are now set to face a parliament of falling living 
standards. In the months and years ahead the key task facing the government is 
to turn that situation around.

From Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation

2017 is going to be a tough year as wages will barely grow faster than prices. 
Whilst there will be modest gains for some people from today’s Autumn 
Statement, for most people on below-average incomes, these will be dwarfed by 
previously announced cuts to benefits.

With average wage growth predicted to be 2.4% and prices forecast to go up by 
2.3%, most families will not feel much better off. The increase in the minimum 
wage will bring some relief to those on the lowest earnings, although even this 
is lower than predicted last March.

Many families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the 
reduction in the universal credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax 
personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to 
work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year. A couple with two 
children each earning £25,000 a year will see a benefit of £588 a year from the 
income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will lose £1,308 from the 
benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work allowances.

The majority of the benefit from the income tax changes will go to better-off 
families, and the Treasury’s own documents say that it will cost £2bn in 
2017/18. Spent otherwise, these funds could have made a significant difference 
to families who are just about managing.

From the Institute of Economic Affairs

This was a thin and fiddly statement, so it’s a relief that the chancellor has 
found one area of government activity to cut in abolishing the autumn 
statement. Sadly though, he has abandoned any attempt to balance the books. 
Over the next five years the government will be adding over £233bn to the 
national debt, as much as the entire annual welfare bill. Fiscal rules to this 
government sadly seem to be no more than vague aspirations which are abandoned 
with impunity.

On the upside, the chancellor does seem to realise, however, that there’s no 
need to implement policy for the sake of it. A boring budget statement is 
better than a gimmicky one.

From Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation 

This was a continuity autumn statement - deficit reduction while delivering 
the manifesto and a productivity plan.

It’s essentially Osbornomics plus £100n of extra borrowing.

We must wait for the major policy changes - for instance, the new industrial 
strategy - as well as the government’s plans for Brexit.

There is a risk that driving immigration down to ‘tens of thousands’ could 
cause the public finances to deteriorate even further than the OBR’s new 
forecasts predict.

From Catherine Colebrook, chief economist at the IPPR


At the beginning of his speech the chancellor made the now familiar claim that 
the British economy is in a strong condition. But the rest of his speech gave 
the lie to this.

As he then admitted, UK investment and productivity are far below our major 
competitors, we have a record trade deficit, an unsustainable fiscal gap 
between projected tax receipts and public expenditure, and a regionally deeply 
unbalanced economy between London and the Southeast and the rest of the country.


What he did not say, but was made clear during the EU referendum campaign, is 
how unequal the distribution of income and wealth has become. It is time that 
the national debate about the economy reflected these fundamental weaknesses. 
Tackling them will require a far more profound change to policy than the 
measures the Chancellor announced today.


From Claudia Wood, chief executive at Demos

No one is in any doubt that the government has a sizeable challenge trying to 
boost economic growth against a backdrop of ongoing instability caused by 
Brexit. At the same time, the government’s commitment to the JAMs - perhaps in 
part recognising many voted to leave the EU as an expression of their 
frustration with the statue quo - necessitates spending in areas that matter 
most to them.

This seems to be the approach Hammond is taking - popular giveaways such as 
the fuel duty freeze mixed with investment for growth. It seems incongruous, 
however, that we should be raising 40% tax bracket at all, helping as it does 
those at the upper end of the income scale while reducing the government’s tax 
take.

Here is the comment on the autumn statement sent out by Leave Means Leave, the 
successor to Leave.EU. It is from John Longworth, Leave Means Leave’s co-chair. 
We’re quoting it in full. It does not mention the OBR analysis of the impact of 
Brexit at all.

The chancellor has made a good start on the road to making the British economy 
the best in the world.

Investing in infrastructure and research and development, improving access to 
finance – particularly for tech companies which ensures they do not have to 
sell out to foreign competitors, and funding for the Oxford – Cambridge 
expressway are all very positive announcements.

This is a solid base on which to build and crystalise the huge benefits Brexit 
brings to our country.

Through signature ready trade deals, tariff reduction and removal, 
deregulation that will feel like a tax cut for UK businesses and real tax cuts 
- Brexit will enable the UK economy to thrive.

The fringe benefit of Brexit is that the chancellor will have to make the UK 
the best country in the world to do business.

His task now is to build confidence in the UK economy. He has a golden 
opportunity to improve further the strong economic forecasts and make Britain 
thrive, thanks to Brexit.

Further OBR detail shows that the 80,000 a year reduction in net migration 
expected to follow the Brexit vote will cost Britain £16bn over the next five 
years.

The OBR tables show that the reduction in net migration will come as a result 
of a tighter net migration policy and the UK becoming a less attractive place 
for migrants will cost the UK economy. It estimates that cut in migration will 
cost the UK economy £0.8bn in 2016/17 rising to £5.9bn a year by 2020/21. This 
is a total of £16bn over the next five years.

Small print alert: Britain's EU contributions are going up!

Buried on page 160 of its report 
<http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/Nov2016EFO.pdf>, the OBR makes the 
surprising prediction that Britain will be payingmore to the EU in 2018-19 and 
beyond, despite Brexit.

The watchdog has calculated that the fall in the pound will push up the UK’s 
contributions to the EU budget (which are paid in euros), by £800m in 2018-19 
and 2019-20, and £900m in 2020-21.
 Photograph: OBR 
But shouldn’t Britain have stopped paying into the EU from March 2019? Not 
according to the OBR; it believes payments will continue, if Britain wants to 
keep access to, say, the single market.

The Government has said it wishes to negotiate a bespoke arrangement with the 
EU. That may or may not include agreeing to contribute to the EU budget to 
retain some of the benefits that it has enjoyed from membership.

Britain could also have to contribute to Brussels’ pension pot, and the 
European Investment Bank. And if British universities lose EU grants, the 
government may have to step in instead, the OBR adds.

Gosh - didn't pick this up. A round £1bn pa of EU transfers only due to the £ 
slump induced by Brexiteers who objected to EU transfers. Ok..

Small print alert: 'Welfare cap' being relaxed as OBR says it will be missed 
by 7%

As Sky’s Faisal Islam points out, the autumn statement document shows that the 
government’s “welfare cap” (a spending limit for certain welfare payments) is 
being relaxed.
Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) 
The Welfare Cap has been "reformed" it is now "medium term", it has been 
raised higher (cap, eh?) ...will only be assessed by OBR in 4 years

<https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/801442933769699328> 
Why? Because, as the OBR report says, the government is on course to miss the 
current limit by 7% by the end of this parliament.

And the ‘welfare cap’ requires a subset of welfare spending to be held below a 
cash limit set in July 2015, but we now expect this to overshoot by more than 7 
per cent by 2020-21.

Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s co-leader, criticised Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> for not mentioning 
climate change in the autumn statement. She said:

With Trump’s election this could have been a moment for Britain to become a 
world-leader in the fight against catastrophic climate change but, instead, we 
see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of 
our times. Indeed, it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention 
climate change in his speech. By caving into the motor lobby and freezing fuel 
duty again for the seventh year in a row the government has made a mockery of 
the fact that it is the hottest year on record and condemned us to more carbon 
emissions and deadly pollution.

And here is Mark Reckless, a member of the Welsh assembly, responding to the 
autumn statement on behalf of Ukip.

Despite the fearsome predictions of remain supporters, the overall prognosis 
for the economy is good, as we knew it would be. The official forecast is that 
unemployment in 2020 after we have left the EU will be just 860,000. This 
administers the last rites to the infamous claim that 3m jobs would be lost if 
we left the EU.

We are borrowing too much, £68bn this year, £59bn next, and £122bn more than 
planned across the forecast period. The government has talked tough on 
austerity but failed to match its words with deeds.

Every month the government delays Brexit costs the exchequer over a billion 
pounds. UKIP says just get on with it.

For six years George Osborne, as chancellor, David Cameron and all their 
ministerial colleagues were able to bulldoze through opposition to their 
policies by asserting that they had a “long-term economic plan”. It passed the 
test of all good soundbites by becoming so familiar as to be groan-inducing. In 
some respects the term was misleading, because Osborne missed his targets and 
had to rejig his plans, but the claim that the Conservatives were on a path 
towards eliminating the deficit seemed to impress the public and this strategy 
helped Osborne and Cameron to win the 2015 general election.

Today Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> 
consigned the LTEP to the dustbin. In truth, it collapsed the day the UK voted 
for Brexit but Hammond had to tell MPs that the EU referendum result has 
blasted a huge hole in the national finances and he has all but abandoned any 
hope of getting the budget into surplus on his watch. Osborne’s targets have 
been abandoned, the government plans to carry on borrowing and spending (the 
autumn statement envisages a fiscal loosening of almost £9bn by 2021-22) and, 
although the Treasury hopes to balance the budget in the 2020s, it won’t say 
when this might happen. All of this is quite sensible, but it is not the 
economic prudence that won the Tories the 2015 election.

In the past governing parties have been consigned to opposition for a decade 
or more for economic mismanagement on this scale. But there is no sign of this 
happening to the Conservatives. Cameron did not ask the country to vote for 
Brexit, and nor did Hammond, or Theresa May. Hammond’s political authority 
remains intact.

Yet the autumn statement will have disappointed those who expected May’s 
“Jam”-focused government to be quite different from Cameron’s. When she became 
prime minister in July May said she would focus her attention on those just 
about managing (the Jams). Today was her first big chance to strike out in a 
new direction but, although the statement contained some progressive measures 
(eg universal credit and letting agents’ fees), what was striking was the 
continuity with Osborne, not the contrast. How much difference has she made? 
Just 7%, according to a Resolution Foundation analysis. (See5.33pm.)

That’s all from us for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Philip Hammond buried the government’s goal of balancing the nation’s budget 
in this parliament today -- and the financial markets didn’t bat an eyelid.

The pound has jumped by one percent against the euro today, to €1.18 -- a 
ten-week high. It’s also higher against the dollar tonight too, up half a cent 
at $1.245.

That’s might surprise you -- surely the news that Britain needs to borrow an 
extra £122bn to rise out the Brexit storm should spark a sterling crisis?

But no. The City is welcoming Hammond’s new spending plans. OK, today’s 
figures are small potatoes compared to Donald Trump’s $1trn infrastructure plan 
-- but they should mean growth isn’t as weak over the next few years as feared.

Hammond took some pleasure in pointing out that Britain is still expected to 
grow as fast as its eurozone rivals next year, even after today’s downgrade to 
1.4%.

The £122bn of extra borrowing announced today may take some swallowing, though.
UK borrowing costs have risen today, as traders anticipate more UK gilts 
hitting the market (bond yields rise when prices fall).

We’ve also seen that almost half that fiscal black hole is directly due to 
Brexit, with the OBR saying leaving the EU will cost £58.7bn over the next five 
years. That includes a £16bn hit from lower migration (see earlier chart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-2016-philip-hammond-brexit-growth-deficit-housing-jams-universal-credit-minimum-wage-live?page=with:block-5835aa54e4b0cc60d3476321#block-5835aa54e4b0cc60d3476321>
). Something to consider when policymakers weigh up the cost of a hard Brexit, 
vs one that gives better access to the single market.

The public face an earnings squeeze over the next two years, when inflation is

But the FT’s Sarah O’Connor points out that we might avoid falling real wages,

And the big picture hasn’t really changed; Britain’s economy is still 
suffering from low productivity and a debt hangover from the 2008 crisis, with 
Brexit casting another shadow.


Richard Buxton, head of UK Equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, warns that 
we should remain cautious:


In my view, substantial risks to the UK’s economy remain, bringing into 
question an implicit suggestion that animal spirits will suddenly rise in the 
years ahead.

As it stands, the country continues to face the same uncertainties that 
triggered such a sharp decline in the value of sterling in the aftermath of the 
EU referendum vote.

During Referendum George Osborne warned that leaving EU = 500,000 job losses. 
Today's OBR says employment will rise by 500,000 by 2021.

Leave Means Leave has, curiously, chosen not to challenge the OBR analysis of 
the impact of Brexit in its autumn statement reaction (see5.44pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-2016-philip-hammond-brexit-growth-deficit-housing-jams-universal-credit-minimum-wage-live?page=with:block-5835d4fde4b0cc60d3476445#block-5835d4fde4b0cc60d3476445>
, but Patrick Minford, co-chair ofEconomists for Brexit, has taken it on. He 
has put out this statement.

The OBR’s report issued today contains a number of assumptions around the 
impact of Brexit which simply follows the path of countless other establishment 
bodies, which have assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the 
EU, based on bad economic policy-making . Whilst it acknowledges the fact that 
the decision of the government’s chosen path is uncertain, it then applies what 
amounts to an arbitrary Brexit penalty on the UK economy without any proper 
justification. Why does it assume lower productivity, a spending slowdown due 
to uncertainty and lower immigration?

The work of Economists for Brexit has shown in each of these cases the reverse 
to be true. Our forecasts show that there is a positive impact of being outside 
of the single market and embracing free trade under WTO rules, creating an 
additional 4% GDP over the long term; recent outturns for the second and third 
quarters have shown clearly that there is no uncertainty effect; and on 
immigration our estimates are that unskilled migrants cost a total of £6.6 
billion a year. Clearly, better control of unskilled workers, whilst continuing 
to encourage skilled migration can only have a positive economic impact. .

These bodies tried to forecast economic disaster based on uncertainty before, 
in the months leading up to and just after the referendum, when uncertainty was 
at its highest. Yet there is no sign that there was any economic effect. So it 
is illogical in the extreme to forecast further disaster owing to uncertainty, 
just as the picture is becoming clearer. Of course it is true that if bodies 
like the OBR push out continual gloomy statements, if Downing Street gives no 
direction and if, when it does take a lead, takes Britain down the worst 
possible economic path then all this could come true. But, just as they did in 
the spring and the summer, they are mistaking the very worst outcome for a 
sensible forecast.
 
Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says poor 
households faces a tough 2017, with inflation likely to devour wage rises.

Previously announced benefit cuts will wipe out the benefits announced today, 
Kumar explains:

“Many families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the 
reduction in the Universal Credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax 
personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to 
work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year.

A couple with two children each earning £25,000 a year will see a benefit of 
£588 a year from the income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will 
lose £1,308 from the benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work 
allowances.

John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation 
<https://www.cafonline.org/>, fears that charities will face an increased 
burden as economic growth slows....

“We know that during uncertain times charities are increasingly relied upon to 
support those in most need. In recent years charities have experienced rising 
demand for their services while resources have been increasingly stretched.

Here is some reaction to the autumn statement from thinktanks.

From Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation


The big picture today is the new chancellor accepting a major increase in 
borrowing, partly off the back of the Brexit vote, and choosing to increase it 
further with an expensive but welcome increase in capital spending. The result 
is £122bn additional borrowing, with national debt reaching 90 per cent of GDP 
next year.

The outlook for family finances that lies behind the big growth and borrowing 
figures is also bleak, with average earnings set to be £830 lower by the end of 
the parliament than previously forecast.

Despite increasing borrowing elsewhere, the chancellor has left the big 
welfare cuts intact and chosen not to provide significant support for the just 
managing families that Theresa May has rightly said she is focused on.

The double whammy of lower earnings and benefit cuts mean that the poorest 
third of households are now set to face a parliament of falling living 
standards. In the months and years ahead the key task facing the government is 
to turn that situation around.

From Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation

2017 is going to be a tough year as wages will barely grow faster than prices. 
Whilst there will be modest gains for some people from today’s Autumn 
Statement, for most people on below-average incomes, these will be dwarfed by 
previously announced cuts to benefits.

With average wage growth predicted to be 2.4% and prices forecast to go up by 
2.3%, most families will not feel much better off. The increase in the minimum 
wage will bring some relief to those on the lowest earnings, although even this 
is lower than predicted last March.

Many families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the 
reduction in the universal credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax 
personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to 
work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year. A couple with two 
children each earning £25,000 a year will see a benefit of £588 a year from the 
income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will lose £1,308 from the 
benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work allowances.

The majority of the benefit from the income tax changes will go to better-off 
families, and the Treasury’s own documents say that it will cost £2bn in 
2017/18. Spent otherwise, these funds could have made a significant difference 
to families who are just about managing.

From the Institute of Economic Affairs

This was a thin and fiddly statement, so it’s a relief that the chancellor has 
found one area of government activity to cut in abolishing the autumn 
statement. Sadly though, he has abandoned any attempt to balance the books. 
Over the next five years the government will be adding over £233bn to the 
national debt, as much as the entire annual welfare bill. Fiscal rules to this 
government sadly seem to be no more than vague aspirations which are abandoned 
with impunity.

On the upside, the chancellor does seem to realise, however, that there’s no 
need to implement policy for the sake of it. A boring budget statement is 
better than a gimmicky one.

From Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation 

This was a continuity autumn statement - deficit reduction while delivering 
the manifesto and a productivity plan.

It’s essentially Osbornomics plus £100n of extra borrowing.

We must wait for the major policy changes - for instance, the new industrial 
strategy - as well as the government’s plans for Brexit.

There is a risk that driving immigration down to ‘tens of thousands’ could 
cause the public finances to deteriorate even further than the OBR’s new 
forecasts predict.

From Catherine Colebrook, chief economist at the IPPR


At the beginning of his speech the chancellor made the now familiar claim that 
the British economy is in a strong condition. But the rest of his speech gave 
the lie to this.

As he then admitted, UK investment and productivity are far below our major 
competitors, we have a record trade deficit, an unsustainable fiscal gap 
between projected tax receipts and public expenditure, and a regionally deeply 
unbalanced economy between London and the Southeast and the rest of the country.


What he did not say, but was made clear during the EU referendum campaign, is 
how unequal the distribution of income and wealth has become. It is time that 
the national debate about the economy reflected these fundamental weaknesses. 
Tackling them will require a far more profound change to policy than the 
measures the Chancellor announced today.


From Claudia Wood, chief executive at Demos

No one is in any doubt that the government has a sizeable challenge trying to 
boost economic growth against a backdrop of ongoing instability caused by 
Brexit. At the same time, the government’s commitment to the JAMs - perhaps in 
part recognising many voted to leave the EU as an expression of their 
frustration with the statue quo - necessitates spending in areas that matter 
most to them.

This seems to be the approach Hammond is taking - popular giveaways such as 
the fuel duty freeze mixed with investment for growth. It seems incongruous, 
however, that we should be raising 40% tax bracket at all, helping as it does 
those at the upper end of the income scale while reducing the government’s tax 
take.
 
Here is the comment on the autumn statement sent out by Leave Means Leave, the 
successor to Leave.EU. It is from John Longworth, Leave Means Leave’s co-chair. 
We’re quoting it in full. It does not mention the OBR analysis of the impact of 
Brexit at all.

The chancellor has made a good start on the road to making the British economy 
the best in the world.

Investing in infrastructure and research and development, improving access to 
finance – particularly for tech companies which ensures they do not have to 
sell out to foreign competitors, and funding for the Oxford – Cambridge 
expressway are all very positive announcements.

This is a solid base on which to build and crystalise the huge benefits Brexit 
brings to our country.

Through signature ready trade deals, tariff reduction and removal, 
deregulation that will feel like a tax cut for UK businesses and real tax cuts 
- Brexit will enable the UK economy to thrive.

The fringe benefit of Brexit is that the chancellor will have to make the UK 
the best country in the world to do business.

His task now is to build confidence in the UK economy. He has a golden 
opportunity to improve further the strong economic forecasts and make Britain 
thrive, thanks to Brexit.
 
Further OBR detail shows that the 80,000 a year reduction in net migration 
expected to follow the Brexit vote will cost Britain £16bn over the next five 
years.

The OBR tables show that the reduction in net migration will come as a result 
of a tighter net migration policy and the UK becoming a less attractive place 
for migrants will cost the UK economy. It estimates that cut in migration will 
cost the UK economy £0.8bn in 2016/17 rising to £5.9bn a year by 2020/21. This 
is a total of £16bn over the next five years.
 
Buried on page 160 of its report 
<http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/Nov2016EFO.pdf>, the OBR makes the 
surprising prediction that Britain will be payingmore to the EU in 2018-19 and 
beyond, despite Brexit.

The watchdog has calculated that the fall in the pound will push up the UK’s 
contributions to the EU budget (which are paid in euros), by £800m in 2018-19 
and 2019-20, and £900m in 2020-21.
 Photograph: OBR 
But shouldn’t Britain have stopped paying into the EU from March 2019? Not 
according to the OBR; it believes payments will continue, if Britain wants to 
keep access to, say, the single market.

The Government has said it wishes to negotiate a bespoke arrangement with the 
EU. That may or may not include agreeing to contribute to the EU budget to 
retain some of the benefits that it has enjoyed from membership.

Britain could also have to contribute to Brussels’ pension pot, and the 
European Investment Bank. And if British universities lose EU grants, the 
government may have to step in instead, the OBR adds.

David Finch from the Resolution Foundation says the autumn statement reverses 
only 7% of the losses affecting the poorest half of households during this 
parliament.

As Sky’s Faisal Islam points out, the autumn statement document shows that the 
government’s “welfare cap” (a spending limit for certain welfare payments) is 
being relaxed.
Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) 
The Welfare Cap has been "reformed" it is now "medium term", it has been 
raised higher (cap, eh?) ...will only be assessed by OBR in 4 years

<https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/801442933769699328> 
Why? Because, as the OBR report says, the government is on course to miss the 
current limit by 7% by the end of this parliament.

And the ‘welfare cap’ requires a subset of welfare spending to be held below a 
cash limit set in July 2015, but we now expect this to overshoot by more than 7 
per cent by 2020-21.
 
Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s co-leader, criticised Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> for not mentioning 
climate change in the autumn statement. She said:

With Trump’s election this could have been a moment for Britain to become a 
world-leader in the fight against catastrophic climate change but, instead, we 
see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of 
our times. Indeed, it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention 
climate change in his speech. By caving into the motor lobby and freezing fuel 
duty again for the seventh year in a row the government has made a mockery of 
the fact that it is the hottest year on record and condemned us to more carbon 
emissions and deadly pollution.
 
And here is Mark Reckless, a member of the Welsh assembly, responding to the 
autumn statement on behalf of Ukip.

Despite the fearsome predictions of remain supporters, the overall prognosis 
for the economy is good, as we knew it would be. The official forecast is that 
unemployment in 2020 after we have left the EU will be just 860,000. This 
administers the last rites to the infamous claim that 3m jobs would be lost if 
we left the EU.

We are borrowing too much, £68bn this year, £59bn next, and £122bn more than 
planned across the forecast period. The government has talked tough on 
austerity but failed to match its words with deeds.

Every month the government delays Brexit costs the exchequer over a billion 
pounds. UKIP says just get on with it.
