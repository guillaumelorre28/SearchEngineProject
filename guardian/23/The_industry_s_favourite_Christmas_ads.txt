It’s that time of year again when retailers unleash their (often 
multimillion-pound)Christmas ads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/christmas-ads> as they hope to grab a good 
share of consumers’ spend over the festive season. With John Lewis and Marks & 
Spencer among those winning over the British public, we asked five advertising 
heavyweights to share their favourite ad:

Rory Sutherland, vice chairman of Ogilvy & Mather Group: Coming home for 
Christmas, Heathrow Airport

I like the Heathrow Christmas ad immensely – not least because they thought of 
doing it at all. For a retailer, there are obvious economic reasons to 
advertise at Christmas; not so for an airport. This is a charming animated 
expression of a very simple insight – that for all our grumbling from January 
to November, the arrivals hall atChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> is a magical place.

The music is perfect, the animation is charming and there are enough little 
problems shown on the bears’ journey through customs and baggage reclaim to 
prevent it seeming unrealistically perfect. At the end, the ad even breaks one 
of the sacred rules of Christmas advertising by showing the bears 
transmogrified into a real-life pair of human grandparents.

 Heathrow’s ad features two teddy bears making their way through an airport. 
Nick Farnhill, co-founder of Poke: The Snowman and the Snowdog, Barbour

Creatively, a bespoke remake of The Snowman and the Snowdog, feels completely 
right. Loaded with nostalgia and a timeless image of Christmas, it’s easy to 
make the brand connection. Barbour has actually been here before and used The 
Snowman in their 2010 Christmas print campaign, so the highly crafted animation 
has a natural relationship. Created in-house and in partnership with Penguin 
Books, the film will appeal to the outdoorsy or at least the pseudo-outdoorsy 
type. Heritage is central to the idea. But does it work?

It has definitely taken the brand’s fans down a memory (country) lane. Nearly 
a million Facebook views and sharing of Christmas-related observations 
demonstrates that it has hit the spot for many devotees. It’s also a nice 
set-up for the Barbour dog range with the launch of a new Instagram feed that I 
hope isn’t just for Christmas. A little more amplification and targeting of the 
film could be made across YouTube and in search, but the idea carries well 
through to Barbour.com and a whole bunch of gift ideas. Overall I’d say a 
perfect brand match executed with love.

 Barbour has remade The Snowman and the Snowdog in its festive ad. 
Micky Tudor, joint executive creative director of CHI & Partners: The Tale of 
Thomas Burberry, Burberry

Only Argos, John Lewis and Burberry have really nailed it in my opinion. What 
makes Burberry stand out is that they didn’t even use an ad agency. Ninety-nine 
times out of a hundred, this would be a terrible idea – but Burberry aren’t 
just pretty faces.

This three-minute spectacular has the class of a feature film, without 
appearing like a parody. It has proper scale, shows off the clothing 
effortlessly and educates about the brand heritage entertainingly. Before you 
know it, you have been swept off your office chair and into a romantic bygone 
era. It’s rich with Christmassy sentimentality, without needing the Christmassy 
bits.

I know it won’t be to everyone’s taste (it suffers its own bout of 
self-indulgence with such a big budget) – but how many ads can boast a cast 
like Domhnall Gleeson, Sienna Miller and Dominic West, as well as Academy 
Award-winning director Asif Kapadia?

 Gleeson stars as founder Thomas Burberry (see? I even said “stars”, it feels 
so filmic …), Miller as his fictional first love and West as Ernest Shackleton. 
Shackleton? What has he got to do with it? Well, I’m glad you asked, because 
having watched the ad I now know that Burberry supplied Shackleton clothing on 
his various expeditions. Who needs Wikipedia?

So convincing is this ad, there’s have already been calls online for The Tale 
of Thomas Burberry to be made into a full-length feature.

And even if the whole two-and-a-half-hour spectacular was written by an 
unlikely in-house team, I for one would probably pay to see it.

 Burberry’s ad is in the style of a feature film and stars Sienna Miller and 
Dominic West. 
Russell Ramsey, executive creative director at J. Walter Thompson London: 
Magic is real, Not on the High Street

The stand out ad for me is Not on the High St. It’s a film that gives me a 
real sense of what the company is about and the suppliers behind it. This ad 
has a lot of work to do to explain to the viewer what they offer since they may 
not be very familiar with the brand. The script does this in a skilful and 
elegant way.

We see various likeable craftsmen and craftswomen making things in their own 
special way. We see someone putting a name on a necklace, toys undergoing 
cuddle tests and even a unique constellation being framed. The personal, quirky 
nature of the gifts really comes through. The music is warm and Christmassy 
without being cliche.

The idea that the suppliers are Santa’s little helpers is done with subtlety 
and charm. It’s only halfway through that we start to notice that these 
otherwise normal people have elf ears. The viewer is allowed to observe the 
little jokes, like how can an elf be 6ft 7in tall? The reindeer in the back 
garden and the 5LEIGH number plate on the delivery van. The whole thing is 
entertaining and charming.

The Not on the High Street ad isn’t as big and flashy as some of the other 
Christmas retail ads but it’s a great reflection of the brand personality and 
service, and it intrigues the viewer into finding more unusual gifts online.

 Not on the High Street focuses on its suppliers in this year’s ad. 
Laura Jordan-Bambach, creative partner at Mr. President: The Sing-Song, TK Maxx

One of the fascinations I have with Christmas advertising is how they marry 
the touchy-feely brand idea with clearly selling products. John Lewis goes one 
way (and it works) and Argos the other (which also works a treat). But it’s 
interesting to think about how TK Maxx, a high street retailer with no specific 
products, approaches Christmas.

As a Santa’s grotto of the weird and wonderful, they need to stand clearly for 
one thing: the uniqueness and unpredictability of their stock. To awaken the 
curiosity of shoppers to take a peek because you never know what you’ll find.

That’s why for me, their Christmas ad stands out. Sure it’s peculiar, even 
slightly disturbing; but it’s full of joy. And the family are cast with such 
infectious playfulness that there’s a real humanity there behind the gargling 
granny – you can’t help being on their side. It’s something that you can sing 
along to without feeling self conscious, and something that reminds you of the 
spirit of Christmas togetherness without being soppy in the slightest. Most of 
all, it stops you in your tracks – I defy anyone not to notice this surreal 
explosion in an ad break. You almost need to rewind and watch again just to 
take it all in. And you sure as hell remember it.
