Margaret Thatcher <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher> has 
topped a Women’s Hour list of the most influential women of the past 70 years, 
a choice that even the judges admit was the source of “enormous contention”.

One panel member, Ayesha Hazarika, a former adviser to the Labour MP Harriet 
Harman, said she felt “uncomfortable” with the choice of Thatcher, but said the 
list was about celebrating impact “both positive and negative”.

For the past two years, Women’s Hour has compiled a list celebrating the 
global impact of women on other women. But this year, to mark the BBCRadio 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4> programme’s 70th anniversary, the 
remit of the list was expanded to cover female achievement over the past seven 
decades.

The panel was made up of seven women, including businesswoman Karren Brady, 
screenwriter Abi Morgan, former Women’s Hour editor Jill Burridge, and Julia 
Hobsbawm, the founder of Editorial Intelligence. It was chaired by the 
journalist Emma Barnett.

Speaking about the decision to put Thatcher, the UK prime minister from 1979 
to 1990, in the top spot, Barnett said that, no matter what your view of her 
politics, “she redefined power”. “Thatcher was one of the most iconic leaders 
of the 20th century, regardless of gender,” she said. “These are all things you 
can’t deny. She shaped how women viewed what it was to be a woman in power, 
from the way people articulated themselves to the way people dressed.

“She shattered the glass ceiling into tiny splinters and just by having a 
woman in power, little girls knew they could do it – even if it’s not the power 
you would have wanted.”

Barnett stressed that impact did not always have a positive meaning and 
pointed out that even for those who viscerally dislike the late Conservative 
politician, she politically galvanised a new generation of women in opposition 
to her.

“It would be easy to put seven really worthy women who make you feel warm and 
gooey inside on this list, but that isn’t what impact means,” said Barnett. 
“Thatcher spawned a whole other generation of feminists in complete opposition 
to her and so in some ways her impact was to provoke huge change from the left 
and beyond.”

Hazarika said that she had “lost the argument about Thatcher” but conceded: 
“Whether you loved her or loathed her, hers was a very significant achievement. 
Thatcher shaped a generation and shaped a period in British history.

“I think she had a massively negative impact on society and on women but she 
was important because she showed that just because you [have] a woman in 
Downing Street does not mean you have a feminist prime minister or a feminist 
government.”

The list of seven spans a broad spectrum of women, dead and alive. And not all 
are household names. Second on the list is Helen Brooks, who set up 
contraceptive services for women in the UK and – in the words of Barnett – 
“gave women the key to controlling their own bodies”.

“She changed the lives of unmarried single women. When I went to get the pill 
for the first time, I didn’t know Helen Brooks’ name and I feel like I should 
have,” added Barnett.

Also included is the former Labour MP Barbara Castle, who brought in the Equal 
Pay Act, polarising feminist Germaine Greer, and the performer Beyoncé. Perhaps 
the most unexpected name on the list is Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding’s hapless 
fictional character, who burst on to the scene in 1996. The decision to feature 
Jones caused such disagreement among the panel that Hazarika joked that they 
almost called the supreme court to arbitrate.

Barnett said that even though Bridget Jones was fictional, she had had an 
undeniable and valuable impact on the way women were perceived, and could 
publicly express themselves, over the past two decades.

“Bridget is Marmite on this list, and believe me, it was not an easy 
discussion – the judges were completely split,” said Barnett. “It’s very easy 
to pack a list like this with people you should, and people you ought, to have 
there, but I think we forget that Bridget Jones is our Sex and the City. She’s 
our flawed heroine, that character which enabled women who didn’t have 
children, didn’t have the perfect life, to laugh at themselves and feel 
unashamed of who they are.”

Hazarika was also among those who had voted in favour of the character. “We 
wanted the good, the worthy, the brave, the liberating, the fierce – but we 
also wanted a bit of the fun on our list,” she said.

Hazarika said the blow of Thatcher topping the list had been softened by the 
inclusion of her wildcard suggestion, Jayaben Desai, the prominent 1976 
Grunwick strike leader who campaigned against low pay and poor conditions.

“Jayaben was this tiny 4ft 8in woman in a sari who had dockers and postal 
workers from across the land coming to support her on the picket line,” said 
Hazarika. “She made trade unions realise solidarity was not just for white 
working-class men, but spanned right across immigrants and women as well. So it 
was great to be able to shine a bit of light on her and her story.”
