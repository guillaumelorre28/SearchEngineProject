President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
sounded off on his $25m payout to students who accused him of fraud on 
Saturday, as he prepared for a meeting with former foe Mitt Romney, tipped as a 
possible nominee for secretary of state.


On Friday the US president-elect settled class-action fraud lawsuits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/donald-trump-university-settles-president-lawsuit-25-million>
 relating to his Trump University for $25m, avoiding the public embarrassment 
of having to testify in court, despite having previously vowed to fight the 
cases to the end.

On Saturday he sought to explain in a tweet 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/799969130237542400>: “I settled the 
Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as 
President I have to focus on our country.”

He added: 
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the 
time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!

The suits claimed that Trump university misled students and failed to deliver 
on its promises

in programmes that cost up to $35,000. Trump had denied the allegations and 
insisted he would contest them in court. In February, hemaintained

: “Trump University has a 98% approval rating. I could have settled but won’t 
out of principle!”

New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who announced the settlement, 
called it “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 
6,000 victims of his fraudulent university”.

The now defunct organization was one of many subjects of criticism highlighted 
by Romney during the Republican primary campaign. In a speech in March, the 
former governor of Massachusetts declared: “Here’s what I know. Donald Trump is 
a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump 
University.”

Romney also accused Trump of legitimising feelings of racism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/mitt-romney-donald-trump-trickle-down-racism>
, misogyny and xenophobia, and the men stand starkly opposed over Russia. In 
2012 Romney called Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin the “No 1 geopolitical foe” of the 
United States; Trump has praised Putin, and said he wants to restore relations 
with the Kremlin.

On Saturday, however, Romney left the meeting at Trump’s golf club in 
Bedminster, New Jersey, in a cordial mood. “We had a far reaching conversation 
with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of 
the United States of real significance,” he told reporters.

“We discussed those areas, and exchanged our views on those topics – a very 
thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had. And I appreciate the 
chance to speak with the president-elect and I look forward to the coming 
administration and the things that it’s going to be doing.”

Trump said the meeting “went great”. Neither took questions.

Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as 
worthless as a degree from Trump University. (1/2)

Before the meeting, Trump had repeatedly mocked Romney, especially on account 
of his loss to Barack Obama in 2012, as the last Republican nominee. “Mitt 
Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog,” 
Trump tweeted in June.

Jason Miller, communications director of Trump’s transition team, said that 
the president-elect’s Saturday meetings included Michelle Rhee, a former 
chancellor of Washington DC schools; businesswoman Betsy DeVos; Chicago Cubs 
co-owner Todd Ricketts; philanthropist Bob Woodson; financier Lew Eisenberg; 
and Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire surgeon.

On Sunday Trump will hold talks with conservative writer John Gray; Kansas 
secretary of state Kris Kobach; investor Wilbur Ross; New Jersey governor Chris 
Christie; former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani; and businessmen Robert Johnson; 
and David McCormick.

On a conference call, Miller said the meetings are not all for possible 
appointments. “Some folks that are coming in are obviously potential 
administration hires. Some are coming purely to offer their advice.

Miller also said the meetings were a sign that the president-elect is trying 
to bridge political divides. “I think this also shows that the president-elect 
is even bringing folks together who may have been on the opposite side from him 
politically. But if we’re working to bring the country together and move 
forward, this shows really where his intent is as the next leader of our 
country.”

Media reports, citing anonymous sources in the party and transition team, 
suggested thatRomney is a possible contender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/donald-trump-cabinet-nominations-what-we-know-so-far>
 for secretary of state along with the former New York City mayor Rudy 
Giuliani, former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton, Tennessee senator Bob 
Corker and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who met Trump this week.

Sean Spicer, another spokesperson, said Trump has now spoken with “over 37 
foreign leaders who’ve offered their congratulations on winning this historical 
presidential election”.

Trump has further meetings on Saturday with retired US marine corps general 
James Mattis and education activists Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos.

Trump also used Twitter on Saturday to demand an apology from the cast of 
Broadway musical Hamilton after actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron 
Burr, the third US vice-president, delivered a direct message from the stage to 
vice-president-elect Mike Pence, who was in the audience and drew both cheers 
and boos.

“We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new 
administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or 
defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” Dixon said. “We truly hope this 
show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of all 
of us.”

Trump characterized that plea as “very rude”, and said that Pence had been 
“harassed”. He tweeted:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was 
very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!

Trump’s transition team announced on Saturday that he had spoken with Iraqi 
prime minister Haidar al-Abadi, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg and 
European council president Donald Tusk.

On Friday, Trump picked Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and 
Kansas Representative Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signalling a rightward lurch 
in US national security policy. He also named retired lieutenant-general 
Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.
