Cash-strapped Cuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> has offered to pay 
its old debt to the Czech Republic with goods it can spare, including its 
coveted rum, according to the Czech finance ministry.

“The Cuban party as a possible solution presented a list of commodities … 
[including] several brands of rum,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

Czech media put the Cuban debt at about 7bn koruna ($270m), but the ministry 
said it had yet to tally the total sum as talks on the repayment had only 
started late last year.

The debt is largely the legacy of business ties between Cuba and 
Czechoslovakia, which split into theCzech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/czech-republic> and Slovakia in 1993, four 
years after shedding four decades of communist rule.

The largest Czech broadsheet daily Dnes quoted the deputy finance minister, 
Lenka Dupakova, as saying debt repayment in Cuban rum was “an interesting 
option”.

“These are relatively unknown brands which might be good, but we would have to 
advertise them and generally launch them into the market,” she added.

The daily said the Czech Republic – a country with the highest per capita beer 
consumption in the world – had imported 892 tonnes of Cuban rum worth 53m 
koruna ($2m) in 2015.

If the entire debt were repaid in rum, the Czechs would have enough rum for 
130 years at this pace.

But the ministry is against such a solution. “The Czech side believes that at 
least part of the debt should be dealt in cash,” it said.
