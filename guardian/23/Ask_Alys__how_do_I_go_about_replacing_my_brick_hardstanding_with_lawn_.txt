I’d like to replace my brick hardstanding with lawn. How difficult would this 
be to do myself, or should I get a professional to do it? Are the bricks 
sellable?

You may find a buyer for the bricks on eBay or Gumtree. It could be more 
hassle than it’s worth, though: do a brick search and see what price people get 
for them. If not, I’d put them on Freecycle or Freegle: community gardens and 
projects are often looking for materials. Actually I’m looking for some free 
bricks for my allotment right now.

As for replacing the bricks with lawn, it will be physical work. Take up the 
bricks and any footing that went down with them. No one will want the old 
footing, so you may need to take it to your local tip or hire a skip, depending 
on the quantity. Dig over the soil, because it will have been compacted, and 
add a layer of compost or topsoil because sitting under bricks means that it 
may be lacking in life and nutrients. Once you’ve levelled it and gently firmed 
it back down again, lay the turf on top and keep it watered till you see it 
start growing again. I’d say it would take you a weekend to do; less if you 
have help.
