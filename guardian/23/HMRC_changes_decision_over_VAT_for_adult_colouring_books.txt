HMRC <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/hmrc> has announced that it will 
not impose VAT on most colouring and dot-to-dot books for adults – reversing 
its plans from earlier this year which were greeted with dismay by fans and 
publishers alike.

Colouring books aimed at adults have been a publishing hit in the last three 
years, with titles such as Johanna Basford’s Secret Gardentopping the Amazon 
bestseller lists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/05/colouring-books-for-adults-top-amazon-bestseller-list#comment-49982203>
. The intricate patterns and designs featured in many of the titles are 
credited with soothing anxiety in people who are stressed.


In 2015, at the peak of the trend, almost 4m colouring books were sold, 
generating sales of over £24m. Publishers seized on the popularity, releasing 
more than a thousand titles, according to market research company Nielsen.


But the success of the genre attracted the attention of the tax authorities. 
Earlier this year, the Bookseller reported that several publishers received 
letters from HMRC saying they owed VAT of 20% on adult colouring and dot-to-dot 
books.

Books are usually exempt from VAT, but this rule only extends to books that 
are designed to be “read or looked at” – so this excludes books such as diaries 
and notebooks, for example.

“While the adult colouring and dot-to-dot books satisfy most of the 
conditions, they are not designed to be read or looked at. In fact, they are 
designed to be completed,” HMRC argued in apolicy note clarifying its stance

 on colouring books this week.

But the government has backed down on its plans to charge VAT on most of the 
books, deciding they can be classed as children’s colouring or painting books – 
as long as they are not marketed specifically towards adults.

“After discussions with publishing representatives we have agreed that 
colouring books that are not marketed towards or contain material for adults 
will, like children’s colouring books, be free of VAT,” an HMRC spokesman told 
the Guardian. The decision takes effect from April 2017, although HMRC has said 
it won’t pursue VAT claims for books sold before then.


HMRC could not provide an estimate for how much income the tax department 
would miss out on because of the decision.

However, titles marketed to adults will now face VAT. One such example, Shit 
Happens! Swear Words and Mantras to Colour Your Stress Away, by James Alexander 
<https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1113263/shit-happens/>, is currently the 
bestselling colouring book on Amazon.

The Publishers Association chief executive, Stephen Lotinga, said the decision 
was a “very positive outcome” for publishers and would mean most colouring 
books remained VAT-free: “We have been discussing the issue of VAT on colouring 
books with HMRC for some time and welcome the constructive manner in which that 
consultation was undertaken, which led to the guidance published today.”

Laurence King, managing director of Laurence King Publishing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing>, which publishes illustration 
books including Secret Garden, said: “We are delighted that HMRC has provided 
clarity on the VAT status of colouring and activity books and welcome the 
positive solution that HMRC have put forward. We are very grateful to the PA 
for their role in bringing this result about.”

However, the craze for colouring books appears to be cooling: in 2016 up to 
November, sales fell to just under 2m copies, generating £11m, Nielsen data 
shows.

Frances Luery, a publishing industry analyst at IBISWorld, said HMRC’s 
decision could be the “beginning of the end” for the sector.


“I think the effects of this decision on the colouring book industry could be 
interesting,” Luery wrote in an email to the Guardian. “The surge in colouring 
and dot-to-dot book sales in the last few years has been built on the concept 
of colouring as a form of alternative therapy for adults rather than fun for 
children.”

Luery added: “If publishers can no longer refer to colouring books as ‘adult’ 
they will need to completely rethink their marketing strategy for the genre.

“While no doubt publishers will be relieved that they don’t have to repay £4m 
in unpaid tax, this might still be the beginning of the end of the adult 
colouring book craze.”
