An unrepentant Stephen Dank has foreshadowed further legal action after the 
AFL anti-doping tribunal

 found 34 past and present Essendon players not guilty of doping violations.

Dank, the sports scientist at the heart of the club’s controversial 
supplements program, fingeredAsada <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada> 
for blundering its investigation and the AFL for “stage managing” the process 
since first announced in February 2013.

But while the players were cleared and coach James Hird says he feels 
vindicated, the tribunal is still deliberating on multiple charges against 
Dank, who faces a life ban from the sport if found guilty.

“I’ve understood from the very early days how this thing was stage-managed,” 
he told the Nine Network.

“I think we know the script was written from day one ... by the Australian 
Football League. There are still things that I need to do going forward that I 
will do and my legal team will do.”

But Dank’s sharpest barb was saved for Asada.

“They’ve been very, very poor in their conduct, execution and understanding of 
this whole investigation,” he said.

“The players never took anything that was illegal or anything that was against 
the WADA-prohibited list. The players were not guilty of anything. I’m very 
happy for the players.”

Dank also revealed a depth of support for Hird, who he said was fully behind 
the supplements program.

“He showed a lot of faith in the program in 2012, he showed a lot of support, 
he believed in the program,” he said. “We had a very, very good relationship, 
never one cross word.

“He showed enormous courage in the back end, particularly in relation to the 
federal court matter

. It was a shame he never continued through to the high court.

“I have no doubt that he got an unbelievable amount of pressure put on him by 
the club in relation to those appeals.”
