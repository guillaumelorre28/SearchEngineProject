The national civil police commissioner, Howard, Cotto said on Thursday that no 
murders were reported the previous day in the gang-plagued little Central 
American country.

The last time the country went a full day without any killings was 22 January 
2015, according to records kept by the Associated Press. It also happened once 
in 2013 and on two days the year before that.

Killings peaked at 104 per 100,000 residents in 2015, the highest rate for any 
country not in open war that year.

Homicides fell by about 20% last year, but it was still one of the most 
violent countries with 81.2 murders per 100,000 residents.
