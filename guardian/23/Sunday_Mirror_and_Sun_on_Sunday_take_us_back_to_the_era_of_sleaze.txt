It was quite like old times on the newsstands yesterday. Two Sunday red-tops 
took us back to the era of sleaze that bedevilled John Major's administration.

In other words, it was way before the nation, and the press, had heard of Lord 
Justice Leveson <https://www.theguardian.com/law/lord-justice-leveson>.

There was the News of the World - sorry, Sun on Sunday - with a splash 
headlined"Top Tory quits in rent boy scandal" 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5539598/tory-mp-mark-menzies-quits-over-gay-sex-rent-boy-allegations.html>
 plus, incidentally, an inside spread on "a blonde beauty" who"enjoyed internet 
sex chats with four Manchester United stars" 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5539729/Four-Premiership-stars-in-seedy-sex-chat.html>
.

And there was the Sunday Mirror splashing on the same tale, "Tory MP quits in 
drugs & rent boy scandal" 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tory-mp-mark-menzies-resigns-3300512>. 
And this on the day when same-sex marriage laws came into force, duly 
celebrated on the paper's page 23.

The story concerned the resignation of Conservative MP Mark Menzies, 
parliamentary private secretary to the international development minister, Alan 
Duncan, afterallegations made by a Brazilian male escort 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/30/mark-menzies-brazilian-escort-claims>
.

Both papers lay claim to exclusivity, but that little local dispute between 
the titles is far less interesting than the editorial agenda that convinced 
each of them of the story's importance.

You might have thought it inappropriate nowadays to expose people for their 
(alleged) gay relationships. You might have also thought it inappropriate to 
accept the word of someone who has sought payment for that (alleged) 
relationship. Doesn't the term "rent boy" seem oddly archaic in 2014?

You would probably concede that the (alleged) involvement of drugs just about 
gave it a public interest justification. But only just, given that the level of 
proof appears less than convincing.

I sincerely hope that this isn't the beginning of a trend.
