It can be unsettling to be painted. The last person who tried to paint me was 
my daughter. She missed out my mouth. Now Andrea Tyrimos is having a go. I’m 
optimistic that she will do a better job as a)she is a proper artist 
<http://www.andreatyrimos.com/index.php>, and b) she is planning to exhibit the 
piece in a gallery later this week, alongside nine other portraits of people 
who,like me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/depression-mental-health-breakdown>
, suffer from mental illnesses.

All of which sounds a bit glum, until I turn up one afternoon at her north 
London studio to inspect progress. There I am, on a canvas 4ft by 4ft, leering 
down at myself as if to say: ‘What do you think you’re doing here?’ I’m 
slightly startled by how good a likeness it is. My nose is askew and my chin is 
formidable. It’s me, all right.

 Actor Gail Porter painted by Andrea Tyrimos 
On the floor and other walls are my fellow subjects, all rendered in the same 
washed-out oil colours, minimalist detail to hair and clothing bringing out 
their vulnerability through their eyes. I’ve always felt that mental illness is 
something you wear on your face. Tyrimos has captured that.

“Some people close to me suffered with mental health issues and find it hard 
to be open about it,” Tyrimos says. “That was the initial inspiration. I wanted 
to do something to get people talking about it.”

The artist, exhausted and exhilarated by four months of living inside other 
people’s heads, calls her project Bipolar Picasso. The portraits are 
accompanied by audio clips in which the subjects speak about their affliction, 
how they cope, and how they don’t.

 Bill Oddie by Tyrimos 
“The media only cover mental illness when it concerns a celebrity, as 
entertainment,” she says. “I want to use a celebrity-obsessed society to get 
people to learn about the illnesses, and to see ordinary members of the public 
in the same light.” And so, among famous faces such as Bill Oddie, Kerry Katona 
and Alastair Campbell, she has included people who are not well known. After 
all, when mental illness strikes, it doesn’t matter how famous you are. 
Celebrity won’t help.

The overlap between art and mental illness is, of course, very broad. I’m not 
an art historian, but you don’t need to be to know that Caravaggio and Van Gogh 
were not well. AThomas Mann protagonist 
<http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82660.Tonio_Kr_ger> once asserted that 
“healthy people do not write, act or compose”, and that was in 1903. If 
anything, that rule has only become more firmly entrenched. It gets harder and 
harder to find the actor, artist, musician or writer who has not had a brush 
with the black dog.

Sports stars are just the latest category of artists whose psychological 
inflexibility seems to drive them first to success and secondly to 
disintegration. “When you’re winning, everything seems to go along perfectly,” 
former boxer Ricky Hatton says during his particularly revealing audio clip. 
“When I started to lose fights, I found I wasn’t strong enough to deal with it 
mentally. It was when I had too much time to ponder all the things that had 
gone wrong for me – that would set me off.”

But mental illness, and depression in particular, is not picky. It really 
doesn’t care if you are rich, poor, black, white, privileged or deprived, 
famous or obscure. It’s particularly happy to feed on introspection and 
self-evaluation, in people who reflect a little too much about themselves, how 
they compare. Over-thinkers.

Tori Allen-Martin blames her agonies on the way she looks, though her portrait 
is stunning. In her recording, she refers to her “body issues” and laments how 
social media makes this so much harder. “Of course I’m going to look shit in 
the mirror when I compare myself to selfies,” she says.

 Singer Tori Allen-Martin 
Tyrimos herself doesn’t seem particularly tortured. I venture that, in an 
unusual reversal of roles, she is probably more balanced than her subjects.

“Art is therapy, escapism,” she says. “It’s very important to have a creative 
outlet. A lot of people with mental vulnerabilities are the most amazing 
people. We should treasure them.”
