Peering inside the brain of one of the oldest fossilised birds - the 
147m-year-old Archaeopteryx - suggests that it could fly. Until now this 
reptile-like bird had been at the centre of heated debates concerning the 
evolution of flight, but findings published in today's Nature add weight to the 
idea thatArchaeopteryx <https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeopteryx> 
could fly.

Timothy Rowe, of the University of Texas at Austin, and Angela Milner, of the 
British Museum of Natural History in London, reconstructed the shape of the 
Archaeopteryx brain using computer imaging. By scanning the bones surrounding 
its brain (using computerised scanning tomography) and then applying 3D 
modelling, they showed that Archaeopteryx's brain resembles that of modern 
birds, with all the features associated with flight.

"The brain sits tightly in the bones so areas like the brain lobes leave an 
imprint on the bones," says Milner. Regions of the brain associated with good 
vision, balance and hearing, seen as vital to modern birds, were discovered in 
the reconstructed Archaeopteryx brain.
