So that's that, then ...

Having spent a few days terrified that he might have chosen to ride the wrong 
horse in the Gold Cup, Bryan Cooper was a mightily relieved man as he won the 
Gold Cup on Don Cossack, for Irish trainer Gordon Elliott. The feature race of 
the day was in danger of being overshadowed by its amateur couterpart, the 
Foxhunter Chase, where Olympic cyclist and novice jockey Victoria Pendleton 
finished a highly creditable fifth in a race won in fine style by the real 
queen ofCheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenham>, Nina 
Carberry, on board the Enda Bolger-trained On The Fringe.

Earlier in the afternoon, Ivanovitch Gorbatov got Barry Geraghty off the mark 
in the Triumph Hurdle, running under the name of trainer Aidan O’Brien, but 
prepared for the race by his young son Joseph, who enjoyed a hugely successful 
career as a jockey on the Flat. We’ll be hearing plenty more about him in years 
to come.

There was another happy family affair in the County Hurdle, when Superb Story 
provided a happy ending for jockey Harry Skelton, who was riding for his 
trainer brother Dan. In the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, 
Uknowwhatimeanharry took the spoils At the close of a week which bookmakers 
described as the worst, from their point of view at least, in living memory, 
Jack Sherwood won the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys’ Handicap Hurdle on Ibis 
Du Rheu, trained by Paul Nicholls, while Solar Impulse made it a double for the 
champion trainer in the Grand Annual Chase, with Sam Twiston-Davies booting the 
final winner of the week home.


So, that’s that, then. After 28 races, the final score in the Betbright Cup 
pitting Irish trainers against their English counterparts stands all square at 
14-14. That’s all from us for this Festival. We hope you enjoyed our coverage 
and were among the many, many people who relieved weeping bookmakers of their 
money over the past four days. Thanks for your time and tune in again during 
Royal Ascot, when I will be once again shackled to the Guardian racing desk 
with only a bowl of water and a straw mattress for company.

Preview: Grand Annual Handicap Chase (5.30)

Chris Cook

The Getting-Out Stakes is a final tricky handicap, run at great speed, which 
often throws up a big-priced winner. Next Sensation is just 1lb higher than 
when winning it last year and it would be no great surprise to see him bounce 
back to form. Eastlake, last year’s second, is 2lb lower and may be given less 
to do this time, having finished strongly 12 months ago. His owner, JP McManus, 
also has The Saint James, who looks well treated if he can put a good round of 
jumping together. Raven’s Tower has been kept aside for this since scoring in 
November, though he has yet to prove his aptitude forCheltenham

More on Pendleton ...

Pacha Du Polder’s owners expect to enter the horse in the equivalent race for 
amateurs at Aintree and say they hope Victoria Pendleton rides him there as 
well. It will, indeed, be interesting to see if she continues in the 
horse-racing business without the financial backing of Betfair. She certainly 
appears to have been bitten by the bug and looks like she could become a very 
accomplished rider if she keeps up the hard work.

Preview: Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle (4.50)

Chris Cook

Squouateur represents the sharp, sharp team of Gordon Elliott and JP McManus 
and will be partnered by the teenage star Jack Kennedy. Despite a 13lb hike for 
his last win, the horse is surely still up to winning off this mark. Qualando 
won last year’s Fred Winter and is still fairly weighted on 8lb higher. Flying 
Angel has a 5lb penalty for Saturday’s Imperial Cup and should be involved if 
able to take another run quite so quickly. Lizzie Kelly has been given a ride 
on the Mullins-trained Buiseness Sivola, which is interesting, considering this 
talented rider struggles to get employment from most British trainers. 
Buiseness Sivola couldn’t get involved in the Fred Winter last year but may be 
better suited by the extra distance here.

Victoria Pendleton speaks ...

“I think it’s probably one of the greatest achievements of my life and I hope 
it’s not the last,” says Victoria Pendleton, as one nearby wag in Guardian 
Towers says she should done by the stewards under the non-triers rule for not 
giving her horse the best possible chance of winning. In otherwoman jockey 
news, Nina Carberry has landed another big gamble for punters on an Enda 
Bolger-trained horse in the colours of JP McManus. What a truly terrific rider 
she is - a professional in all but name, who’s more capable than many of her 
male counterparts.

Foxhunter Chase (4.10) 3m 2f

might have won with a better-timed run?

Foxhunter Chase (4.10) 3m 2f

The runners and riders make their way down the all weather chute and out on to 
the course, with Ms VL Pendleton looking very relaxed as she makes her way out 
on to the course and gives Pacha Du Polder a look over the practice fence. On 
Channel 4, AP McCoy reveals that he’s told her to keep an eye out for top 
amateurs Jamie Codd on board on Aupcharlie and just follow him.

Foxhunter Chase (4.10) 3m 2f

The bookies are already reporting this to be their worst Cheltenham in living 
memory and it’ll get a whole lot worse if a certain woman wins this race. Nina 
Carberry - for it is she - is the undisputed queen ofCheltenham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenham> and rides the favourite, On The 
Fringe here. Should she win, it’ll be catastrophic for the oddsmakers.

The jockeys have been summoned ...

The 24 amateur riders - yes, there are 23 others although you could be 
forgiven for thinking otherwise from reading this blog - in the Foxhunter Chase 
are summoned to the parade ring, to get their final instructions and the leg-up 
on to their mounts.

Over to you now, Victoria ...

Footage from the weigh room show that Victoria Pendleton is suited, booted and 
ready to go in the Foxhunter Chase. She’s had a preliminary hop on the scales 
just to make sure that everything is as it should be and looks very calm and 
relaxed ahead of her biggest challenge since her time in the velodrome at 
London 2012. Good luck to her and all the other runners and riders in the 
Foxhunter Chase.

Preview: Foxhunter Chase (4.10)

Chris Cook

Thrills and spills are odds-on in this contest, which will attract rather more 
attention this year than heretofore. Good luck to Victoria Pendleton but, even 
if nothing goes wrong for her, Pacha Du Polder does not look the strongest 
stayer in this field. On The Fringe is the right favourite after landing this 
last year before following up at Aintree and Punchestown and his warm-up race 
last time was fine. Paint The Clouds, third last year, should go well again. 
Mendip Express looks vulnerable to jumping errors. Dark Lover appears to have 
unexplored potential, if one can say that of an 11-year-old. He’s a big price, 
anyway.

Having spent a few days terrified that he might have chosen to ride the wrong 
horse in the Gold Cup, Bryan Cooper was a mightily relieved man as he won the 
Gold Cup on Don Cossack, for Irish trainer Gordon Elliott. The feature race of 
the day was in danger of being overshadowed by its amateur couterpart, the 
Foxhunter Chase, where Olympic cyclist and novice jockey Victoria Pendleton 
finished a highly creditable fifth in a race won in fine style by the real 
queen ofCheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenham>, Nina 
Carberry, on board the Enda Bolger-trained On The Fringe.

Earlier in the afternoon, Ivanovitch Gorbatov got Barry Geraghty off the mark 
in the Triumph Hurdle, running under the name of trainer Aidan O’Brien, but 
prepared for the race by his young son Joseph, who enjoyed a hugely successful 
career as a jockey on the Flat. We’ll be hearing plenty more about him in years 
to come.

There was another happy family affair in the County Hurdle, when Superb Story 
provided a happy ending for jockey Harry Skelton, who was riding for his 
trainer brother Dan. In the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, 
Uknowwhatimeanharry took the spoils At the close of a week which bookmakers 
described as the worst, from their point of view at least, in living memory, 
Jack Sherwood won the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys’ Handicap Hurdle on Ibis 
Du Rheu, trained by Paul Nicholls, while Solar Impulse made it a double for the 
champion trainer in the Grand Annual Chase, with Sam Twiston-Davies booting the 
final winner of the week home.


So, that’s that, then. After 28 races, the final score in the Betbright Cup 
pitting Irish trainers against their English counterparts stands all square at 
14-14. That’s all from us for this Festival. We hope you enjoyed our coverage 
and were among the many, many people who relieved weeping bookmakers of their 
money over the past four days. Thanks for your time and tune in again during 
Royal Ascot, when I will be once again shackled to the Guardian racing desk 
with only a bowl of water and a straw mattress for company.

The Getting-Out Stakes is a final tricky handicap, run at great speed, which 
often throws up a big-priced winner. Next Sensation is just 1lb higher than 
when winning it last year and it would be no great surprise to see him bounce 
back to form. Eastlake, last year’s second, is 2lb lower and may be given less 
to do this time, having finished strongly 12 months ago. His owner, JP McManus, 
also has The Saint James, who looks well treated if he can put a good round of 
jumping together. Raven’s Tower has been kept aside for this since scoring in 
November, though he has yet to prove his aptitude forCheltenham

Pacha Du Polder’s owners expect to enter the horse in the equivalent race for 
amateurs at Aintree and say they hope Victoria Pendleton rides him there as 
well. It will, indeed, be interesting to see if she continues in the 
horse-racing business without the financial backing of Betfair. She certainly 
appears to have been bitten by the bug and looks like she could become a very 
accomplished rider if she keeps up the hard work.

Squouateur represents the sharp, sharp team of Gordon Elliott and JP McManus 
and will be partnered by the teenage star Jack Kennedy. Despite a 13lb hike for 
his last win, the horse is surely still up to winning off this mark. Qualando 
won last year’s Fred Winter and is still fairly weighted on 8lb higher. Flying 
Angel has a 5lb penalty for Saturday’s Imperial Cup and should be involved if 
able to take another run quite so quickly. Lizzie Kelly has been given a ride 
on the Mullins-trained Buiseness Sivola, which is interesting, considering this 
talented rider struggles to get employment from most British trainers. 
Buiseness Sivola couldn’t get involved in the Fred Winter last year but may be 
better suited by the extra distance here.

“I think it’s probably one of the greatest achievements of my life and I hope 
it’s not the last,” says Victoria Pendleton, as one nearby wag in Guardian 
Towers says she should done by the stewards under the non-triers rule for not 
giving her horse the best possible chance of winning. In otherwoman jockey 
news, Nina Carberry has landed another big gamble for punters on an Enda 
Bolger-trained horse in the colours of JP McManus. What a truly terrific rider 
she is - a professional in all but name, who’s more capable than many of her 
male counterparts.

amateurs Jamie Codd on board on Aupcharlie and just follow him.
 
The bookies are already reporting this to be their worst Cheltenham in living 
memory and it’ll get a whole lot worse if a certain woman wins this race. Nina 
Carberry - for it is she - is the undisputed queen ofCheltenham

forgiven for thinking otherwise from reading this blog - in the Foxhunter Chase

Footage from the weigh room show that Victoria Pendleton is suited, booted and 
ready to go in the Foxhunter Chase. She’s had a preliminary hop on the scales 
just to make sure that everything is as it should be and looks very calm and 
relaxed ahead of her biggest challenge since her time in the velodrome at 
London 2012. Good luck to her and all the other runners and riders in the 
Foxhunter Chase.
 
Thrills and spills are odds-on in this contest, which will attract rather more
