Top new entry: Moana

With three weeks to go, Disney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company> released its big family 
film for Christmas: Polynesia-set animation Moana. The seafaring adventure 
failed to dislodgeFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
, now in its third week. An opening gross of £2.21m (including previews of 
£33,000) seems rather modest for a Disney animation –Zootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
 kicked off in March with £5.31m, including £1.73m in previews.

In fairness, family films released in the run-up to Christmas tend to start 
rather gently, picking up steam when schools break up. That said, Disney/Pixar’s
The Good Dinosaur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/the-good-dinosaur-review-desperately-disappointing-and-twee>
 began with £2.93m in the last weekend of November 2015 – 33% ahead of the 
Moana opening. The Good Dinosaur ended up with a lifetime tally of £15.15m, 
making it the lowest-grossing Pixar movie to date. Disney must be disappointed 
to have opened Moana even lower.

A factor here is likely to be the continuing strong performance of Fantastic 
Beasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
, which added £4.49m in its third weekend, taking the 17-day tally to £37.9m. 
The JK Rowling-scripted blockbuster has overtaken the lifetime totals ofBatman 
v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill>
 (£36.6m) andCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 (£36.9m), thus becoming the fifth biggest hit of 2016 so far, behindBridget 
Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 (£47.8m),The Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review> (£46.2m), 
Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
 (£42.8m) andDeadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
 (£38.1m).

The runner-up: Sully

Warners UK executives may have wondered whether the story of US Airways pilot 
Chesley Sullenberger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/27/chesley-sullenberger-sully-film-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-miracle-hudson-river>
 – who landed a plane on the Hudson River in 2009 after both his engines were 
disabled by a flock of geese – would resonate with UK cinemagoers. But selling 
points included directorClint Eastwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/clinteastwood> and star Tom Hanks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks>, and Sully has opened solidly with 
£1.79m including £18,000 previews.

Clint Eastwood’s Sully: Miracle on the Hudson – trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/30/clint-eastwoods-sully-miracle-on-the-hudson-exclusive-trailer>
In the US, the film began in September with $35m, on its way to a total of 
$125m. An equivalent opening in the UK would be £3.5m, soSully 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sully> is not yet matching its US success.

The Polish surprise: Pitbull: Tough Women

Most UK cinemagoers will never have heard of Polish action film Pitbull: Tough 
Women, which has crashed into the UK chart in fifth place. Targeted at the UK’s 
sizeable Polish population, the film played in 104 Odeon cinemas, grossing a 
stunning £456,000.

Distributor Phoenix opened franchise predecessor Pitbull: Public Order in 
April, debuting with £146,000, on its way to a final £544,000. If Tough Women 
follows a similar trajectory, it would end up with £1.7m, making it the year’s 
biggest foreign language European film, ahead of Pedro Almodóvar’sJulieta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/julieta-review-pedro-almodovar-ties-himself-down-with-fractured-melodrama>
 (£1.33m).

The year’s biggest Hindi-language hits are Ae Dil Hai Mushkil 
<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/Ae-Dil-Hai-Mushkil/movie-review/55112044.cms>
 (£1.47m) andSultan 
<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/Sultan/movie-review/53065893.cms>
 (£1.79m), so Tough Women also has a chance of overtaking those, thus becoming 
the biggest foreign language film of 2016 at UK and Ireland cinemas.

Both these Pitbull films are rated 18, Public Order for “strong violence, sex 
and sexual violence”, and Tough Women for “very strong language, strong bloody 
violence and injury detail”. Both are directed by Patryk Vega, as was the 2005 
original Pitbull movie (never released in UK cinemas) and the spinoff TV series 
of the same name.

The also-rans: The Edge of Seventeen and Bleed for This

Two wide releases – teen comedy The Edge of Seventeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/29/the-edge-of-seventeen-review-hailee-steinfeld-coming-out-ball>
 and boxing dramaBleed for This 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/bleed-for-this-review-miles-teller-aaron-eckhart>
 – made little impact at the box office, landing in ninth and 10th place. In 
fact, it was only thanks to £60,000 in previews that Edge of Seventeen 
(£273,000) made the Top 10 at all.

Bleed for This stars Miles Teller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/miles-teller> (Whiplash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review>) as Italian 
American boxer Vinny Pazienza, who made what is regarded as one of the greatest 
comebacks in sports history when he re-entered the ring 13 months after 
breaking his neck in a car crash. Reviews were modestly encouraging, but, 
following on fromCreed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/creed-review-rocky-sequel-boxing-sylvester-stallone>
 earlier this year andSouthpaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/southpaw-review-gym-bunny-gyllenhaal-cant-save-this-heartless-boxing-film>
 in 2015, audiences might not have been ready for another boxing picture.

As for The Edge of Seventeen, reviews were strong, but a 15 certificate meant 
it had to play to older teenagers and adults, pushing it closer to edgy fare 
such asThe Diary of a Teenage Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-review-coming-of-age-comedy>
 than, say,Mean Girls <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/18/3> (£5.5m). 

The future

Thanks in part to that rather soft start for Moana, the market overall is 21% 
down on the previous session. However, it’s also 20% up on the equivalent 
weekend from 2015, when box office underperformersChristmas with the Coopers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/christmas-with-the-coopers-review-film-diane-keaton-john-goodman>
 andVictor Frankenstein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/victor-frankenstein-review-film-james-mcavoy-daniel-radcliffe>
 were the top new releases. Cinemas must now get through one more weekend 
before the arrival ofStar Wars: Rogue One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story> on 15 December. 
Wednesday welcomes festive comedyOffice Christmas Party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/office-christmas-party-proves-hollywood-is-mild-at-heart>
, starring Jason Bateman, TJ Miller and Jennifer Aniston. It’s followed on 
Friday by Oliver Stone’sSnowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/10/snowden-review-oliver-stone-turns-true-thrills-into-dated-hollywood-fodder>
