Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-yauch> is 
"rapidly recovering" from cancer surgery, assuring fans that "things are moving 
along".

The rapper, dubbed MCA, has updated fans on his treatment and thanked them for 
their support.

Last month, Yauch revealed that he had a cancerous tumour

gland and a lymph node in the same area, forcing the Beastie Boys to cancel all 
planned shows and postpone the release of album Hot Sauce Committee Part 1.

Yauch has returned home "to relax, have home-cooked food and hang out with the 
family", while avoiding taking painkillers that would apparently slow his 
recovery.

The next phase of Yauch's treatment will be radiation therapy. "No sooner am I 
on the mend from this first torture than they are lining up the next one. The 
next treatment will be radiation. That involves blasting you with some kind of 
beam for a few minutes a day, five days a week, for about seven weeks."

Finally, Yauch acknowledged the star tributes

 at last weekend's All Points West festival in New Jersey from Coldplay, Jay-Z, 
Karen O and Q-Tip. "Just wanted to thank them and everyone else who sent 
positive thoughts my way. I do think that all of the well wishes have 
contributed to the fact that my treatment and recovery are going well."
