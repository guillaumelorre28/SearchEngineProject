Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I am very blessed in that I have landed my dream job. After costly and 
exhausting retraining, hundreds of hours of voluntary work, dozens of 
application forms and interviews and a lot of determination and sacrifice, I 
finally have a satisfying and challenging job in the charity sector that pays 
well and I feel valued.

The problem is the commute. On good days, it is 1 hour 20 minutes each way, on 
bad days more than two hours, and it is becoming exhausting: I drive, as public 
transport isn’t really an option due to remote locations. I am finding that my 
evenings are lost in a haze of tiredness, and I fear (know) that I am becoming 
unpleasant to be around. I used to have hobbies (cooking, socialising, creative 
clubs etc) but these are no longer viable. Weekends are invaluable. I am tired 
a lot of the time.

Is there anything I can do to alleviate this, or do I suck it up and count my 
blessings? I don’t want to appear ungrateful. Working from home isn’t really an 
option as I manage volunteers and need to have an office presence. I have 
considered staying in an Airbnb during the week but I would be sad not to see 
my family every evening.
