While admiring Victoria Pendleton’s heavily publicised ride at Cheltenham (
Pendleton hailed by Festival crowd after Foxhunter fifth

, Sport, 19 March; ‘It was a dream – audacious, ridiculous. I feel awesome’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/victoria-pendleton-cheltenham-festival-foxhunter-chase-dream-audacious-ridiculous>
, 19 March) it is regrettable that the remarkable achievements of the actual 
race winner were barely mentioned. Nina Carberry was not only winning the 
Foxhunter Chase for the second year running, she has won five times at 
Cheltenham over the years, in addition to many other successes, and taken part 
in five Grand Nationals. She is one of the most remarkable horsewomen of her 
generation and is also blessed with a charming and attractive personality. I 
was sorry to see that all this took second place to celebrity in the Guardian, 
as in other media.
