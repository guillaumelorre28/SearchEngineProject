Wada reportedly wants its appeal against the AFL anti-doping tribunal’s 
Essendon verdict heard in Switzerland.According to The Age 
<http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/wada-wants-essendon-case-heard-in-switzerland-20150519-gh5ath.html>
, the world anti-doping authority is set to make the request partly because 
some members of the panel hearing the appeal will be from outside Australia.

The move would further infuriate Essendon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> and the AFL, who had hoped Wada 
would not go ahead with the challenge. Once the Court of Arbitration for Sport 
panel is appointed, all interested parties can make submissions on where the 
appeal is heard. CAS has an Oceania office in Sydney.

Lawyers for the 34 current and past Essendon players involved in the appeal 
are certain to argue strongly that the hearing should take place in Australia.

Wada <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wada> announced on 12 May that it 
would appeal against the AFL anti-doping tribunal’s verdicts, handed down on 31 
March. The tribunal found in favour of the players, who were charged with 
taking the banned substance Thymosin Beta-4.

The charges stemmed from a joint AFL-Asada investigation into Essendon’s 
controversial 2011-12 supplements regime.Asada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada> decided against an appeal, but Wada 
decided to go ahead with the CAS action.

Essendon coach James Hird said the tribunal decision was comprehensive and the 
Bombers were shocked by WADA’s appeal. It will be several months before the CAS 
hearing goes ahead.

The players, WADA and CAS each nominate a person to sit on the appeal panel.
