Staffan and I had got some funny looks as we bounded out of the Icehotel. 
Everyone else was swaddled in boots and snowsuits, boarding snowmobiles or 
harnessing huskies; we were in tights, heading out for a run.

The Icehotel, the famous snow-sculpted retreat made afresh every year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2014/dec/15/ice-hotel-opens-in-swedish-lapland>
 in Jukkasjärvi, 20 minutes from Kiruna, 200km north of the Arctic Circle, is 
25 years old this winter. It’s always introducing new activities, and new for 
2015 is a network of marked running trails. I had joined a trial “wellness 
winter weekend” that combines ice jogging and cross-country skiing with a trip 
to the newAurora Spa at Camp Ripan <http://ripan.se/en/aurora-spa/> on the 
outskirts of Kiruna (pine sauna, birch scrub, outdoor hot tub). Staffan, my 
guide, plotted the trails: 2½km, 5km and 10km routes. Feeling gung-ho, I’d 
suggested we hit the 10k.

After a few metres, I was cursing myself. Snow is a harsh mistress. It was 
like running on cold sand, every footfall a step in the dark, no knowing how 
your foot might slip or twist, how deep you might sink. The snow varied, from 
firm-yet-slippery tracks left by snowmobiles to knee-deep powder on untrodden 
hillsides.

“High knees, small steps!” Staffan advised. He was gallivanting like a 
caribou; I was more Arctic elephant. Studded grippers over my trainers gave 
some extra purchase but couldn’t combat the energy-sapping effect of the snow. 
And breathing the icy air was like sucking slush through a straw. My 
Darth-Vader wheeze broke the silence.

 Sarah Baxter ‘warms up’ at the Icehotel 
What to wear had been a worry, as I’d tried to imagine the sweatiness of 
running in the freezing cold of Lapland. It was -14C, so I’d need to wrap up – 
but wear too much and you sweat, and body heat is lost up to five times faster 
in wet clothes. I’d opted for socks (two pairs), thermals under running tights, 
a technical T-shirt, long-sleeved top, light jacket, hat and gloves. After five 
minutes I removed the gloves and jacket, and was tempted to take off more. The 
only time I felt a chill was when Staffan shook a snow-heavy branch to give me 
a “traditional spruce shower”.

It was hard work – but what a place to run. We passed cheery wooden houses in 
Jukkasjärvi village, and delved into Puimonen forest on a mixture of snowmobile 
trails and deep-snow off-road. There are coloured markers to show the way; 
without them, you’d be quickly confused.

“We have trolls here,” Staffan told me. “Illustrator John Bauer visited in the 
19th century, and based his drawings of trolls on these woods.”

We started running uphill, for views over the village and Torne river, and I 
realised I loved this route – especially the downhill bits, when I felt the gay 
abandon of a child, running for running’s sake, sink-sliding into soft powder. 
Isn’t falling over a risk? “Yes,” Staffan confessed, “I fall sometimes.” But he 
said you usually just flop painlessly on to the wintery duvet.

By the end of the slowest, chilliest, sparkliest 10k I’ve ever completed, I 
felt I’d more-than-run, engaging rarely called-on muscles. Perhaps that’s why
Toughest Ice <http://www.toughest.se/en/toughest-ice/ice-hotel/>, a Swedish 
obstacle-race organiser, has launched an Icehotel event. On 11 April, after the 
hotel has closed, it will host an 8k race over ice obstacles (entry £95).

Next day, after hitting the 5k trail alone, I decided those crazies could keep 
their race; I was off to the other extreme. At the Aurora Spa, I ran the 
gauntlet of scented saunas, birch and coffee scrubs, a breath-stealing 
ice-bucket challenge and an outdoor hot tub. My kind of obstacles.

• The trip was provided by Discover The World (01737 214 291,
