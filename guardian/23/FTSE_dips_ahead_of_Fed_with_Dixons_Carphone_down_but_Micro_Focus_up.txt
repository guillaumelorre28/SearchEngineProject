Leading shares have slipped back after mixed UK unemployment figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-rate-pay-growth-jobless-ons>
 and ahead of the expected US interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve later 
on Wednesday.

A couple of trading updates have had the opposite effect on the share prices 
of the companies involved.Micro Focus, the IT firm paying $8.8bn for Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise’s software business, has jumped 4% to £22.16 following a 
22.4% rise in half year underlying earnings. It said the deal was due to be 
completed in third quarter.

Numis, which is advising on the HPE transaction, said:

Micro Focus has outperformed on nearly all levels in the first half, giving a 
net 9% EPS beat and 3% full year upgrade. 1.0% underlying revenue growth is 
well ahead of our -2% forecast, although management reiterate full year 
guidance of -2% to 0%, and we note that timing of deal closures can impact 
individual periods, thus 1% growth should not be automatically extrapolated 
into the second half. However, it clearly provides strong support for the 
achievability of management’s “modest growth” goal.

In a hold note, Julian Yates at Investec said:

Full-year guidance was not raised, implying a softer second half, but we feel 
this is partly due to conservatism and also to reduce the reliance on [Linux 
specialist] SUSE having to sustain this growth level. We expect the stock to 
move up today, but continue to struggle to justify prices above 2400p given the 
extent of the HPE task and time horizon to deliver required synergies.

But Dixons Carphone is down more than 5% at 346.6p as the electrical 
specialist reported a 19% rise in first half profits but warned of more 
uncertain times ahead.

Among the other fallers, Antofagasta has fallen 19.5p to 719p as JP Morgan cut 
its recommendation from neutral to underweight, while housebuilders were also 
under pressure, withPersimmon down 28p at £16.71.

Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 11.02 points lower at 6957.55 as investors 
await the Fed’s decision. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver said:

The Fed is expected to announce a second rate hike this evening (19:00GMT), 
one year after raising rates for the first time since 2006. The expected 
increase is by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.50% to 0.75%.

While the decision has been almost completely priced in by markets, there 
could still be some additional dollar gains, depending on the tone of any 
forward guidance given. A relatively hawkish outlook on rate hikes next year 
would strengthen the dollar, while a more cautious tone than expected could 
weigh on the dollar.

Lower down the market payments specialist Paysafe has recovered some ground 
after Tuesday’s slump, up 10p at 315.7p. The company was hit by a negative 
report from a short seller,

 but maintained the comments were either inaccurate or old.

Ladbrokes Coral has climbed 2.8p to 118.8p after a bid battle for an 
Australian lottery operator, with a consortium including Macquarie and KKR 
breaking into a proposed merger with Tabcorp Holdings.

But NMC Health has fallen 65p to £13.83 as the United Arab Emirates group 
agreed to buy a hospital in Sharjah for $560m and unvield a placing of around 
9.9% of the business.

IQE has jumped 7% to 37.5p after the semiconductor materials maker forecast 
full year revenues ahead of previous expectations, partly due to the fall in 
the pound since the Brexit vote.
