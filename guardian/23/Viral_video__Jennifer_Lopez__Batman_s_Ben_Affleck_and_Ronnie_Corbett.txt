American Idol judge Jennifer Lopez pays the price of joining James Corden for 
Carpool Karaoke whenhe snatches her phone 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQIsdod0LWo> and uses it to text The Revenant 
star Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair - J-Lo and J-Co - carpool to CBS, singing some 
of her hits. Less happy is Ben Affleck, whose face appears sadder and sadder
when he listens to the critics’ take 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwXfv25xJUw> on Batman v Superman: Dawn of 
Justice. While co-star Henry Cavill jumps to defend the superhero movie, Batman 
co-star Affleck’s face falls …

Meanwhile Australian actor Hugh Jackman had to call upon his superhero powers 
whenhe helped swimmers out of the water 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rcTFnqPb8A> at Sydney’s Bondi Beach when they 
got caught in a rip. Nine News TV captured footage of Jackman, in a black rash 
vest, helping to pull a man to safety before gesturing for other swimmers to 
move clear of the dangerous currents. Meanwhile Nine News reporter Brittney 
Kleyn had a shock whena bird landed on her

link.

This week we pay tribute to comedian Ronnie Corbett with the Four Candles 
sketch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaGpaj2nHIo>from The Two Ronnies. The 
comic, who also played the lead in the sitcom Sorry!, would have enjoyed our 
funny final clip -man stuck in compost bin.
