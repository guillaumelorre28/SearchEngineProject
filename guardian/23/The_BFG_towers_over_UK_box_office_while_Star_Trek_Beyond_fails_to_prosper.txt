The winner: The BFG

After The BFG opened in the US with a disappointing $18.8m (£14.3m), there was 
no shortage of media opinion along the lines of Variety’s “The BFG flops: has 
Steven Spielberg lost his blockbuster touch? 
<http://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/steven-spielberg-bfg-box-office-flop-1201808161/>
” (In that particular article, Brent Lang deemed the director a failure and 
said he was “no longer attuned to the zeitgeist”.) In the UK, local distributor 
eOne – which had made what must have been a costly acquisition – would have 
been forgiven for any concern. On the other hand, Roald Dahl is especially 
beloved in the UK, and The BFG features British characters in a British setting 
– a fact that the film has honoured with a British cast led byMark Rylance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jul/18/roald-dahl-steven-spielberg-mark-rylance-the-bfg>
. The UK box office has consistently punched above its weight with family films 
adapted from British-authored material, fromCharlie and the Chocolate Factory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jul/29/2> (£37.8m) and Alice in 
Wonderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review> 
(£42.5m) toThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/dec/02/thechroniclesofnarniafilms.cslewis>
 (£44.4m) and, of course,Paddington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/paddington-review-michael-bond-film-adaptation>
 (£38m).

The BFG trailer: Steven Spielberg directs Roald Dahl’s fantasy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/18/the-bfg-trailer-steven-spielberg-directs-roald-dahls-fantasy-video>
The outcome? The BFG opened in the UK with a sturdy £5.29m, nabbing the top 
spot ahead of fellow new releaseStar Trek Beyond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-trek-beyond>. That’s slightly ahead of 
the debut figure for Paddington (£5.13m) in November 2014. Weekend weather was 
warm and mostly sunny, especially on Saturday – not helpful to the cinema 
industry; the more cloudy Sunday was the film’s strongest day of the weekend. 
The BFG went out into 680 cinemas, compared with 535 for Star Trek Beyond; 
Spielberg’s fantasy clearly fit in well at independent venues and multiplexes. 
Industry rule of thumb dictates that a UK equivalent of the US opening would be 
around £1.9m (10% of the US box office, with the dollar symbol changed to the 
pound symbol), whereas the The BFG came in way ahead of that number. This 
general rule, of course, is not as applicable to films with strong British 
elements.

The runner-up: Star Trek Beyond

Paramount and JJ Abrams rebooted the Star Trek brand in 2009, delivering a 
film that opened in the UK with £5.95m (including £872,000 in previews), on its 
way to a £21.4m total. Four years later,Star Trek Into Darkness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/star-trek-into-darkness-review> 
kicked off with an impressive £8.43m (including £1.57m previews), finally 
arriving at £25.8m. Now comes Star Trek Beyond, which has begun with £4.74m – a 
31% drop on the Into Darkness debut number, if previews are discounted. Star 
Trek Beyond may have suffered from director JJ Abrams’ exit into rival 
franchise Star Wars (he remains as producer). Or fans might have been more 
excited by Benedict Cumberbatch as the main villain last time around, with 
Beyond baddie Idris Elba less proven at the box office. And Paramount may have 
struggled to persuade broader audiences to see a third Star Trek film. A final 
gross below £20m looks likely.

The one-off concert

Year after year, Dutch violinist and conductor André Rieu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/20/andre-rieu-violin-superstar-king-of-waltz-interview>
 breaks cinema box-office records with his annual summer concert, filmed in his 
hometown of Maastricht. Takings are up again this year, boosted by strong 
encore screenings on Sunday afternoon. This cinema audience has a strong skew 
to the over-75 demographic, making the 7pm transmission on Saturday evening a 
challenge for some audience members. Box office was a mighty £1.41m, up from 
£1.11m in 2015 and £831,000 in 2014. The broadcast penetrated even more cinemas 
this year, with 534 carrying the concert in the UK and Ireland, up from 460 
last year and 395 in 2014. Also flying the flag for event cinema was Secret 
Cinema’s presentation of Dirty Dancing. Takings of £954,000 were slightly up on 
the previous weekend. The run of just six dates delivered a final box office of 
£1.90m. That’s more than the combined runs of the original 1987 release 
(£1.62m) and the 20th-anniversary rerelease in 2007 (£224,000).

The flop: Ice Age

Plummeting from second to eighth place in the official comScore chart, Ice 
Age: Collision Course was one of the big losers from the arrival ofThe BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-bfg>. Gross after 14 days nationwide (and 
longer in Scotland and Ireland) is £5.03m, which compares with £17.7m for Ice 
Age: Continental Drift at the same stage. This means that Collision Course is 
running at just 28% of the pace of its predecessor. Schools have now broken up 
for the summer holiday, so families may eventually get round to seeing 
Collision Course, even if it’s not their first choice. Finding Dory arrives on 
Friday, however, and that will be priority for the vast majority.

Admissions update

Admissions figures are in for June, and they reveal a 19% fall on the June 
2015. This is perhaps to be expected in a month that featured theEuropean 
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/european-championship>, and 
admissions are almost level with June 2014, which of course featured theWorld 
Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football>. Major releases 
in June were The Secret Life of Pets,Independence Day: Resurgence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/26/independence-day-resurgence-review>
,The Conjuring 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/19/the-conjuring-enfield-case-review-james-wan>

 andMe Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock>
. These compare with Jurassic World, Minions and Spy in 2015. After six months, 
admissions overall this year are 5% down on 2015, but are 5% up on the first 
half of 2014. Cinemagoing was historically low in 2014 (it was the worst year 
for admissions since 2000), bouncing back impressively in 2015 (pretty much 
level with the best years we have witnessed in the last four decades). Cinema 
owners are taking comfort from the fact that summer this year appears to be 
back-loaded, withFinding Dory

,Jason Bourne

Matt Damon returns in new trailer for Jason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/21/matt-damon-returns-in-new-trailer-for-jason-bourne-video>
Overall, takings are 7% up on the previous frame and are dead level with the 
equivalent weekend from 2015, when Inside Out debuted at the top spot. The 
industry is now anticipating the coming session with justified optimism, since 
Jason Bourne, in cinemas on Wednesday, is followed on Friday by Pixar’s Finding 
Dory. With Matt Damon returning as Bourne, reteaming with director Paul 
Greengrass, anticipation for the film is huge. Finding Dory, meanwhile, has 
grossed $460m in US cinemas so far. Alternatives this weekend includeThomas
