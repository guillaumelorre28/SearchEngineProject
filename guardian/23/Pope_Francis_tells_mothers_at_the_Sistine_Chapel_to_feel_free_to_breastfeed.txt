Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> baptised 33 
infants in the Sistine Chapel on Sunday and told the mothers to feel free to 
breastfeed them if they cried or were hungry.

“You mothers give your children milk and even now, if they cry because they 
are hungry, breastfeed them, don’t worry,” he said, departing from his prepared 
text.

The written text of his homily had the phrase “give them milk”, but he changed 
it to use the Italian termallattateli, which means “breastfeed them”, and he 
added that the mothers should not hesitate.

As the 20 girls and 13 boys in the room cried, Francis asked his listeners to 
remember poor mothers around the world, “too many, unfortunately, who can’t 
give food to their children”.

Even before he read the homily, at least one mother was seen breastfeeding, 
perhaps recalling that the pope had used similar words before to make mothers 
feel at ease.
