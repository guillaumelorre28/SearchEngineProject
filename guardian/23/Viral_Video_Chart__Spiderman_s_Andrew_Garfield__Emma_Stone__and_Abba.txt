As Marc Webb's spring blockbuster The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hits the big 
screen, we've got a treat for Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield fans – a dance-off 
to Bamboleo. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf3ab8XcA8o>The pair shook their 
stuff on the dance floor when they visited the Scott Mills show at BBC Radio 1.

And while you are in the mood for dancing, we celebrate the 40th anniversary 
of Abba's Eurovision Song Contest victory in Brighton 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsVeMz1F5c>with Waterloo. This week's 
celebrations of their victory – they scored nul points from the UK – included a 
party at the Swedish embassy in London and a celebration at Tate Modern, which 
featured the mesmeric magic skills on Charlie Caper

Spring is a popular season for weddings and we've got a couple of clips on 
that theme.Bambo and Janice  <http://vimeo.com/82483731>want their family and 
friends to save the date so they filmed a Great Gatsby-style reminder featuring 
the music of Kanye West. Meanwhile, newlyweds Chris and Leah O'Kane were 
surprised whentheir priest serenaded them with a rendition of Hallelujah.
