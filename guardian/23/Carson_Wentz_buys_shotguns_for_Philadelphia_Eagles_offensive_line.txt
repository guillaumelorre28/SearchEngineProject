strong would need much protection butPhiladelphia Eagles

Wentz decided his offensive line do with a little extra help anyway, buying 
them each a customized shotgun for Christmas.

Wentz is a keen outdoorsman, and recently went hunting with the baseball star 
Mike Trout

 in New Jersey. It’s a passion Wentz shares with Eagles guard Allen Barbre, who 
was delighted with his gift, which bears his jersey number and name. “This is 
an awesome gun. I’m excited about it,” Barbre told ESPN. “I don’t know if I’ll 
shoot it though, it’s pretty nice.”

Barbre said he believes the shotgun is a Beretta Silver Pigeon 
<http://www.beretta.com/en-us/686-silver-pigeon-i/>, which retails at around 
$2,000. That shouldn’t be too much of a stretch for Wentz, whose rookie 
contract with the Eagles included a $17m signing bonus.

Fellow rookie Isaac Seumalo 
<http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978247/isaac-seumalo> was a bit more 
bemused by his gift. “I haven’t really held a gun or anything before,” said the 
guard. “But I’m more than thankful for it. It looks sweet. Carson said he’d 
teach me how to use it and all that good stuff.”

Wentz has had a promising, if mixed start, to his Eagles career. After 
throwing five touchdowns and no interceptions in his first three games, he goes 
into the final weekend of the regular seasonwith as many picks as touchdown 
passes – 14 <http://www.nfl.com/player/carsonwentz/2555259/profile>.
