Egypt confirmed on Sunday that it had arrested an Al-Jazeera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/al-jazeera> news producer, accusing him of 
“provoking sedition” on behalf of the Qatar-based broadcaster that it considers 
a mouthpiece of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.


 Judicial sources said Mahmoud Hussein, who was detained on Friday, was being 
held on charges of disturbing public security and spreading false news.

 The Interior Ministry said in a statement that Al-Jazeera officials “had 
ordered some individuals collaborating with the channel inside the country to 
continue implementing its media plan of provoking sedition, incitement against 
the state, and spreading chaos through broadcasting false news”.

It identified Hussein as a person implementing that plan for the channel,

 Al-Jazeera issued a statement later on Sunday denying the “fabricated 
charges” brought against Hussein and demanding his immediate release, adding 
that he was in Egypt on vacation and not for work.

 “(Hussein) is a news producer in the Al-Jazeera Arabic newsroom and not a 
correspondent supervisor as alleged by the statement ... (he) would not have 
travelled through the airport at Egypt if he was undertaking any illegal 
activities as alleged by the MOI statement,” the statement said.

 The broadcaster expressed concerns over Hussein’s safety.

 “Al-Jazeera holds the Egyptian authorities against subjecting Mahmoud to 
torture or extracting any information from him by force,” it said.

 Egypt has arrested several Al-Jazeera reporters over the past two years, 
raising concerns over the freedom of journalists working in the country.

 In May, a Cairo court recommended the death penalty

 against two of them, charged in absentia with endangering national security by 
leaking state secrets to Qatar.

 The Brotherhood is a Qatar-backed movement that President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi 
has cracked down on since an army takeover in 2013 stripped former president 
Mohamed Morsi – a prominent member of the group – of power following mass 
protests against his rule.

 Thousands of Brotherhood supporters including Morsi are in jail, and Egypt 
has designated the group, which says it is nonviolent, a terrorist organisation.
