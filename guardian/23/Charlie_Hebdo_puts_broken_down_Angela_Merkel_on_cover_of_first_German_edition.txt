French magazine Charlie Hebdo <https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo>
 placed German chancellor Angela Merkel variously on a toilet seat and a car 
mechanic’s hydraulic lift as it released its first German edition on Thursday.

The cover asserts that Volkswagen, the carmaker hit by an emissions cheating 
scandal, “stands behind Merkel”, and shows the chancellor lying atop a platform 
with a mechanic commenting that “with a new exhaust, she’ll be good to go 
another four years”.

The launch publicity featured a poster showing Merkel sitting on a toilet and 
reading the weekly, with the slogan: “Charlie Hebdo – it’s liberating.”

The magzine’s first foreign-language edition is an innovation undertaken 
nearly two years after its staff were almost wiped out in a jihadist attack in 
Paris.


The initial 16-page edition – with a print run of 200,000 – features a sober 
four-page graphic travel reportage by cartoonist and publisher Laurent 
Sourisseau, better known by his artist’s name Riss, which portrays people he 
met and their reflections on their national identity, Germany’s refugee influx 
and other social issues.

German media mainly warmly greeted the launch of Charlie Hebdo, which will 
compete with homegrown monthlies Titanic and Eulenspiegel, the local 
counterparts to Britain’s Private Eye and US site The Onion.

The Frankfurter Rundschau daily judged that, although the proudly tactless 
Charlie Hebdo regularly takes a running leap across the boundaries of good 
taste, its appearance on the German media scene was to be welcomed.

It contains humour “as subtle as a steamroller” and its “impudence, especially 
when dealing with the religions, is legendary”, the newspaper said. “The 
magazine is pure impertinence. From December 1, German readers will be 
subjected to it. What can we say? Quite simply: Welcome, Charlie Hebdo.”

Riss, who was badly wounded in the January 2015 attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/satirical-french-magazine-charlie-hebdo-attacked-by-gunmen>
, believes there is a market. “Humour is everywhere, even in Germany,” he told 
public broadcaster ARD. “It’s an experiment for us to publish Charlie Hebdo in 
another language and try to find new fans for the magazine who can help defend 
it.”

Charlie Hebdo is now produced in a secret location, a legacy of the massacre 
at its former offices that claimed 12 lives, including some of France’s 
best-known cartoonists.

The German version will be edited from France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> by a 33-year-old from Berlin who on 
the advice of her colleagues uses a pseudonym, Minka Schneider.

Schneider told Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily that the “Je suis Charlie” 
solidarity movement was especially strong inGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, where the magazine sold 70,000 
copies of its “survivors’ edition” one week after the shootings.

Despite its many loyal fans and supporters in France, Charlie Hebdo has never 
had a shortage of enemies.


It became a target of Islamist extremists after publishing cartoons of the 
prophet Muhammad but has also delighted in outraging the Vatican and the French 
political establishment.

It angered many with a cartoon of Syrian refugee boy Aylan Kurdi, whose body 
was photographed on a Turkish beach in 2015, by imagining he would have grown 
up to join the “arse-gropers” who committed mass sexual assaults in Cologne, 
Germany, on New Year’s Eve last year.
