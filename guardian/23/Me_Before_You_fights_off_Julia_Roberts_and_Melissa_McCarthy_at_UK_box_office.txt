The winner: Me Before You

It may have only landed in third place in the official comScore chart on its 
opening weekend, but teary chick-lit adaptationMe Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock>
 is sitting pretty at the summit for its second session, as rivals including
Warcraft: The Beginning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh>
 andTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows-review-tmnt>
 fall away. Me Before You, based on the 2012 Jojo Moyes novel, fell a slender 
17% in its second frame, for a 10-day total of £4.48m.

The result is certainly good news for the film’s star, Sam Claflin, whose 
claim to be a bankable leading man had looked pretty tenuous. Previously, he’s 
had supporting roles in hit movies, including theHunger Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/22/the-hunger-games-review> and 
Huntsman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/04/the-huntsman-winters-war-review-dud-followup-to-a-film-no-one-liked>
 franchises, but films where he featured in the lead role have been 
commercially modest at best. Hammer’sThe Quiet Ones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/15/the-quiet-ones-review-hammer-horror-olivia-cooke>
 managed £1.6m lifetime in April 2014.Love, Rosie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/love-rosie-review-lily-collins-claflin-romcom>
, despite being based on a bestseller by PS I Love You author Cecelia Ahern, 
delivered a poor £1.2m. While the success of Me Before You is no guarantee of 
future box office for Claflin, it’s always handy to have a bona fide hit under 
your belt. Ditto for co-starEmilia Clarke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/27/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-interview>
, still best known for TV’s Game of Thrones, whose previous film credits 
include Terminator: Genisys and Dom Hemingway.

The challengers: The Boss and Mother’s Day

With Euro 2016 kicking off on Friday, film distributors zeroed in on the date 
as an opportunity to release female-skewing titles. Universal offered the 
latest Melissa McCarthy comedyThe Boss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/the-boss-review-mccarthy-ho-hum-comedy>
, while Lionsgate had multi-strand ensemble comedyMother’s Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/mothers-day-review-julia-roberts-jennifer-aniston-jack-whitehall>
. Neither posed much of a challenge to Me Before You, which outgrossed the pair 
of them put together.

The Boss review – McCarthy is business as usual in ho-hum comedy
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/the-boss-review-mccarthy-ho-hum-comedy>
The Boss, like predecessor Tammy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/02/tammy-review-melissa-mccarthy-susan-sarandon>
, features both McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone in its writing credits, and is 
directed by Falcone. Tammy opened with £471,000 from 338 cinemas n July 2014. 
The Boss offers a modest improvement on that number, with a debut of £595,000 
from 439 venues. But both figures are a far cry from the openings for McCarthy 
comedies directed by Paul Feig, such as last summer’sSpy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine>
 (£2.56m including previews of £198,000).

As for Mother’s Day, Lionsgate faced the challenge that the holiday the film 
ties into occurred here in March. In the US, Mother’s Day fell on 8 May, and 
the movie opened the previous weekend, grossing $8.4m (£5.9m) in its first 
frame and $11.1m in its second. Lionsgate UK did not have the option of 
releasing the film in time for our Mothering Sunday on 6 March. Even if it had 
been ready, a US distributor would never allow a foreign partner to jump the 
gun by two months and risk the domestic market being penetrated by pirate sites.

Mother’s Day suffered a very poor 18/100 score at MetaCritic, and so was 
relying on the cachet of its premise, star cast (including Jennifer Aniston and 
Julia Roberts) and brand value ofthe “Day” franchise from director Garry 
Marshall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/garry-marshall-happy-days-fonz-jump-shark>
. Regarding the latter, any affection for 2010’s moderately amiableValentine’s 
Day <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/valentines-day-film-review> 
may have been rather dissipated by 2011’s less than fully achievedNew Year’s Eve
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/08/new-years-eve-film-review>.

Mother’s Day opened with £420,000 including previews of £25,000. That compares 
with a debut of £1.29m (including previews of £175,000) for New Year’s Eve and 
a stonking £3.73m for Valentine’s Day. Strip out the previews, and Mother’s Day 
opened at just 11% of the Valentine’s Day debut number.

Distributors for these films didn’t even have the alibi of being hit by sunny 
skies, since the weekend weather was pretty poor across the UK, which may have 
been a factor in relatively modest declines for many titles.

StudioCanal has been re-releasing vintage Studio Ghibli titles on a weekly 
basis since April 29, and will continue to do so until the end of July. But 
that policy went on hold at the weekend as the distributor instead offered the 
new release, When Marnie Was There, directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi. As usual, 
the film was presented to audiences in both dubbed and subtitled versions. 
Opening gross was a healthy £99,000 from 53 venues including £9,600 in 
previews. That compares with a debut of £69,000 from 44 cinemas last year for 
StudioCanal’s previous Ghibli release,The Tale of Princess Kaguya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/the-tale-of-the-princess-kaguya-review-lush-imagery>
. The year before,The Wind Rises  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/21/wind-rises-hayao-miyazaki-animated-film-review>
began with a more impressive £200,000 from 59 sites, including previews of 
£11,000.

StudioCanal returns to its weekly Ghibli rereleases this Friday with Princess 
Mononoke, followed by Spirited Away, then Howl’s Moving Castle.

The documentary battle: Michael Moore v Fire at Sea

At first glance, the opening numbers for new Michael Moore film Where to 
Invade Next 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/11/where-to-invade-next-film-review-michael-moore-happy-toronto-tiff>
 – £86,000 from 127 cinemas – look underwhelming. But that’s because a large 
chunk of those venues played it only once, on Friday evening, with a live Q&A 
from the film-maker coming from its UK premiere at Sheffield Doc/Fest. Only 43 
cinemas had the film for general release.

Moore’s last feature film was Capitalism: A Love Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/06/capitalism-love-story-review>. 
Released in the UK in February 2010, it began with £29,600 from 15 venues, on 
its way to a lifetime total of £137,000. Moore’s best result remainsFahrenheit 
9/11 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/18/alqaida.filmnews>, with a 
UK total of £6.55m.

Although Where to Invade Next was generally well reviewed, it was eclipsed by 
the notices for Gianfranco Rossi’sFire at Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis>
, winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival earlier this year. 
Capturing life on the Italian island of Lampedusa, the first port of call in 
Europe for many immigrants from northern Africa, the documentary began here 
with £13,000 from 15 sites.

Also slipped out at the weekend, and bidding for audiences not otherwise 
distracted by Euro 2016, wasMiracles from Heaven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/18/miracles-from-heaven-review-jennifer-garner>
, starring Jennifer Garner and Martin Henderson. Based on the memoir by Christy 
Beam, the film tells the story of a family whose daughter suffers from a rare 
digestive disorder and is seemingly miraculously cured following an accident. 
Miracles from Heaven was a notable hit in the US where it was able to access 
the large faith-based market, grossing $61m this spring. There, the debut was 
$14.8m. A UK equivalent result would be around £1.5m, going by industry rule of 
thumb, but that was never on the cards, given the more secular society here and 
much less awareness of Beam’s book.

In fact, Miracles from Heaven debuted here with just £20,400 from 110 cinemas. 
It’s fair to say that distributor didn’t bet the farm on marketing, and no one 
will be very surprised by the outcome.

The future

Thanks to a paucity of strongly commercial new releases, overall takings are 
49% down on the previous frame and a dismal 68% down on the equivalent weekend 
from 2015, when Jurassic World stomped its way to the top of the box office. 
Total grosses represent the fourth worst weekend from the past 52, and the 
worst since the weekend before the arrival of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 
mid-December, when almost nothing of any consequence opened.

For most cinemas, the big event this coming session is animation The Secret 
Life of Pets from Illumination Entertainment, who made Despicable Me. The film 
begins previews this Saturday. Also likely to command large audiences isThe 
Conjuring 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/10/the-conjuring-2-review-james-wan-patrick-wilson-vera-farmiga>
, which this time investigates the “Enfield haunting” that occurred in north 
London in the 1970s. Alternatives include fantasy actioner Gods of Egypt, 
comedy sequel Barbershop 3: A Fresh Cut, Matteo Garrone’s fairytale compilation 
Tale of Tales, American civil war drama The Keeping Room, 18-rated French teen 
flick Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story) and UK indie The Violators.
