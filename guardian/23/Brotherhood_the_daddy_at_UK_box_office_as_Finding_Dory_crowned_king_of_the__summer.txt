The brand resurrection: Brotherhood

Eight years ago, Noel Clarke’s Adulthood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/22/film.drama> stunned the UK 
film industry when it debuted in the UK with £1.20m from 157 cinemas, on its 
way to a total of £3.35m. This represented a big jump up from the success of
Kidulthood <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/03/4> from 2006, and 
set a high commercial bar for the British urban drama.

Actor, writer, director and producer Clarke went on to pursue other film 
genres with decidedly mixed commercial success, leaving the British urban genre 
for other film-makers. And with the 2013 collapse of Revolver Entertainment – 
the company that distributed the likes ofSket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/27/sket-film-review>, Shank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/25/shank-film-review> and Offender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/offender-review> as well as Ben 
Drew’s debutIll Manors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/07/ill-manors-review> and Adam 
Deacon’s spoof comedyAnuvahood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/17/anuvahood-film-review> – the 
genre was widely considered to have been exploited to death.

Why Noel Clarke's 'hood' trilogy remains a vital snapshot of Britain

So despite the return of Clarke to the genre, with his new film Brotherhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/28/brotherhood-review-noel-clarke-kidulthood-trilogy>
 – the final part, he says, of his “hood” trilogy – this latest instalment 
hardly represented a commercial slam-dunk. Distributors were hardly running at 
Clarke waving chequebooks, and the film-maker received only a couple of viable 
bids for financing, eventually choosing Lionsgate.

Brotherhood <https://www.theguardian.com/film/brotherhood> began its preview 
run in the UK on bank holiday Monday last week, grossing £971,000 in its first 
four days. It then took a further £1.01m over the official weekend period, for 
a seven-day opening tally of £1.98m. Given a release in just 220 cinemas – less 
than half of the number for all its close competitors – that translates into a 
very robust site average, even if the film’s preview takings are excluded from 
the calculation. In fact, Brotherhood’s weekend site average of £4,581 is the 
highest of any film on release.

Nitpickers may point to the fact that Brotherhood’s three-day number is below 
Adulthood’s £1.20m debut, and of course ticket price inflation favours the new 
film. But it’s fair to say that few in the UK film industry thought Brotherhood 
would come close to the Adulthood result, and Lionsgate – and Clarke – will be 
amply delighted with this outcome.

The winner: Sausage Party

Released at the weekend into a wide 525 cinemas, animated comedy Sausage Party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/10/sausage-party-review-seth-rogen> 
cruised to an easy victory, nabbing the top spot with a tasty £2.69m, including 
previews of £369,000. Rated 15 for “very strong language, strong sex 
references”, Sausage Party is definitely targeting an adult audience, and it’s 
hard to make relevant commercial comparisons with recent animated films.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/the-hotdog-delusion-sausage-party-and-the-rise-of-atheism-in-hollywood>
Screenplay credits include Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, whose Pineapple 
Express <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/12/comedy1> debuted in the 
UK in 2008 with £1.37m including £132,000 in previews, and whoseThis Is the End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/this-is-the-end-review> began in 
2013 with 1.39m. More recently,The Night Before 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/17/the-night-before-review-seth-rogen-christmas-comedy>
, which Goldberg co-wrote with fellow Sausage Party scribes Kyle Hunter and 
Ariel Shaffir (and one other writer), opened with a disappointing £273,000 from 
279 cinemas. Conclusion: while audiences may have rather tired of watching 
Rogen and pals behaving like idiots, an R-rated orgy involving foodstuffs is 
definitely novel.

The real runner-up: Finding Dory

While Brotherhood’s previews boosted the film into second place, that position 
rightfully belongs toFinding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/finding-dory-review-nemo-sequel-disability-ellen-de-generes>
, with weekend takings of £1.50m. The Pixar sequel now stands at £38.87m, 
overtaking fellow Disney releaseCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 to become the biggest hit of the summer blockbuster season. Last summer’s 
Pixar hit,Inside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar>
, reached £39.2m, which Finding Dory will overtake imminently. Of the Pixar 
canon, Finding Dory is outgrossed only byToy Story 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/04/6> and Toy Story 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/15/toy-story-3-review>, unless the 
3D rerelease ofMonsters, Inc <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/08/1> 
(£2.45m) is added to the film’s original tally (£37.91m). Finding Dory is now 
ahead ofFinding Nemo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1054234,00.html>
 (£37.46m), even if the 3D rerelease (£1.23m) is added in.

The 2-4 September period was the last weekend of the summer holidays before 
most kids returned to school, with families taking their best chance to catch 
up on movies. Finding Dory saw box office drop by just 1% from the previous 
session,The BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/the-bfg-observer-review-mark-rylance-steven-spielberg-roald-dahl>
 went up 6% andSwallows and Amazons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/swallows-and-amazons-review-kelly-macdonald-rafe-spall-arthur-ransome>
 went up 4%.The Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
 impressively rose 27%, in its eleventh week of release, andPete’s Dragon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak>
 rose 16%. Expect all these titles to drop now the school holiday is over.

80-year-old director, with a UK debut of £494,000 from 186 cinemas. A year ago, 
hisIrrational Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/irrational-man-review-woody-allen-joaquin-phoenix]>

Summer overview

Sausage Party pushes Finding Dory off top of UK box office
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/sausage-party-finding-dory-uk-box-office-seth-rogen>
While summer of 2016 has lacked the giant big hitters of a year ago, and 
European football championships put a kink in the release schedule in June, the 
UK’s distributors and exhibitors have reason for satisfaction. Yes, the 
season’s biggest hit, Finding Dory (£38.9m) is far behind not just summer 
2015’s top title (Jurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>
, £64.5m), but also runner-ups Avengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating>
 (£48.3m) andMinions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/minions-observer-review> (£47.8m).

But this time there’s been a much broader spread of wealth. Summer 2015 ended 
with only two films in the £20-40m range (Inside Out andMission: Impossible – 
Rogue Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/02/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review-tom-cruise-rebecca-ferguson>
), whereas this time there are six: Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, 
The Secret Life of Pets,Suicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
, The BFG andJason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp>
.

While box office for June was down on June 2015, in July and August it’s been 
robustly up, with Suicide Squad,Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-dory> and Jason Bourne all especially 
contributing to the late-summer surge. Total UK box-office for the 18-week 
period beginning with the arrival of Captain America: Civil War at the end of 
April is £456.0m, which compares with £436.0m for the same period in 2015, a 
rise of 4.6%. Given the general mood of despondency over this summer’s crop of 
blockbusters, that’s a surprising number.

While the top four titles – Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The 
Secret Life of Pets and Suicide Squad – are exactly in line with their 
positions in the US summer 2016 line-up, fifth-placed The BFG is a notable 
local success. The UK gross of £28.7m marks it as a sizeable hit here, whereas 
the US gross of $55m has tarnished the film there as a costly flop.

The future

As the wheels fall off Ben-Hur, where next for the Hollywood blockbuster?

Better-than-expected returns for Sausage Party and Brotherhood, as well as 
some very variable weather across the UK, helped the market overall to box 
office 18% up on the previous weekend, as well as a very healthy 92% up on the 
equivalent frame from 2015, whenStraight Outta Compton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/31/straight-outta-compton-review-an-energetic-a-side-let-down-by-a-bloated-b-side>
 topped the charts in its second week of play, andNo Escape 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/28/no-escape-review-owen-wilson-and-lake-bell-suffer-boggle-eyed-panic-attack>
 was the top new release. Cinema bookers are now hoping for the best with 
Wednesday’s release ofBen-Hur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/ben-hur-review-rowdy-revamp> 
(alreadya significant box office disappointment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/27/wheels-fall-off-ben-hur-where-next-for-hollywood-blockbuster>
 in the US), and looking for some nice crossover success with the very 
well-reviewed Hell or High Water, starring Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff 
Bridges. Sony thrillerDon’t Breathe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/dont-breathe-review-horror-fede-alvarez-house-robbery>
 is now emerging as the real commercial threat, following sensational business 
in the US ($55m after 10 days). Alternatives include the latest Laika animation
Kubo and the Two Strings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/12/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review-charlize-theron-laika-animation>
, Viggo Mortensen and George Mackay in US indieCaptain Fantastic

, Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan in World War II thrillerAnthropoid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/10/anthropoid-review-humdrum-account-extraordinary-plot-heydrich>
, and raunchy French gay drama Theo and Hugo.
