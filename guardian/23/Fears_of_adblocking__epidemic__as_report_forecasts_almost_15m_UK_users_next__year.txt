Almost 30% of British web users will use adblocking software by the end of 
next year, according to a report that warns of a potential “epidemic”.


It predicts that the end of next year, 14.7 million Britons will use software 
to strip advertising from web pages. The report, by eMarketer, plots the rapid 
growth of internet users installing adblocking software in recent years.

In 2014, just 9.5% of UK internet users – at that time about 5 million – had 
installed adblocking software. That will have doubled to 18.5% – about 11 
million – by the end of this year. By the end of 2017, almost 15 million 
internet users, 27% of an estimated 54.4 million UK web users, will use an 
adblocker.

“Once seen as the preserve of the tech-savvy, early adopters and gamers, 
adblocking has now moved into the mainstream,” said Bill Fisher, senior analyst 
at eMarketer. “There is no doubting that adblocking is now a very real issue 
for advertisers.”

The report suggests that adblocking will continue, for now at least, largely 
contained to desktop computers. A breakdown shows that by the end of next year, 
24% of those who use a desktop computer or laptop will have installed 
adblocking software, while 8.8% of smartphone users will have done so.

Among those who use adblocking software, about 90% do so on desktops and 
laptops. About 28% block ads on smartphones. The total is more than 100% 
because some users block ads on multiple devices.

“The good news is that numbers like this have forced those within the industry 
to think long and hard about what it is that they need to do better in order 
that this practice doesn’t become an epidemic,” Fisher said.

In March, a report by the Internet Advertising Bureau estimated UK adblocking 
wasalready at 22% among over-18s

, a higher rate than eMarketer’s.
