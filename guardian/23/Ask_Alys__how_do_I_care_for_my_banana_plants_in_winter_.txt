In the spring I bought two small banana plants. They have grown well on my 
south-west-facing patio, but I’m not sure how to care for them now winter is 
approaching. Should I bring them inside, fleece them or maybe even cut foliage 
off?

You need to keep the worst of the winter rain off; this is the main enemy, 
rotting the crown of the plant. The foliage will blacken after the first hard 
frost and start to rot, so you will need to remove this. You can, if you like, 
cut the banana back before it is frosted: leave a stump a foot or so high. 
Mulch around the base of the plant with very well-rotted garden compost or bark 
mulch, wrap the crown up with fleece, then cover it with something to keep the 
rain off. Some people use upturned dustbins (depending on the size of the 
plant); perhaps you could use a cloche, which would look more attractive.

The alternative is to bring it into the lee of the house or a cold 
porch/garage/shed where you can keep the rain off. Bear in mind, small bananas 
will not survive hard frosts. There are several species –Musa basjoo 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=311> and M. sikkimensis are hardier 
than most. I have seen versions grown in the ground survive with no winter 
protection at all, though these tend to be in very favourable, sheltered spots.
