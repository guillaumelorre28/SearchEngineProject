The owner of the Guardian and the Observer has formally started the search for 
a new chair.


The Scott Trust has advertised for a replacement for Liz Forgan, who will 
stand down at the end of the year.

The trust is responsible for safeguarding the financial and editorial 
independence of the Guardian in perpetuity. It appoints the editor-in-chief of 
the Guardian and the non-executive chair and chief executive ofGuardian Media 
Group <https://www.theguardian.com/media/guardianmediagroup>, the publisher’s 
parent.

However, it does not seek involvement in day-to-day operational matters, 
instead monitoring and holding management to account for the overall strategy 
and financial management of Guardian Media Group.

“We wish to appoint an individual who embodies the values of the Guardian, the 
Observer and the Scott Trust and has a strong commitment to independent, open 
journalism,” the ad says.

“S/he will have exceptional leadership skills and significant experience at 
board level within a major public or commercial organisation. An understanding 
of the global media industry and digital landscape is essential, as is senior 
journalistic experience.”

The chair will be appointed for an initial period of five years, with the 
potential for a further term of five years.

The Scott Trust has advertised the role following the decision of Alan 
Rusbridger,the former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, not to take over from 
Forgan.
