When David Bennett, a passionate music fan, moved to London at the age of 25, 
he was desperate for any kind of break in the entertainment industry. So when a 
job came up with a secondary ticketing website – an online marketplace that 
matches fans selling gig tickets with buyers – he took it.

A few years later he had quit, disillusioned and appalled by an enterprise 
that lined the pockets of touts at the expense of fans. “It was my job to look 
after the power sellers [industry term for ticket touts] and help them get the 
tickets they wanted,” said Bennett, who asked for his name to be changed for 
fear of reprisals. “Some of these guys set up companies with eight or 10 
employees using multiple credit cards to buy tickets.”

He continued: “I once went to meet a guy in a hotel who took out a stack of 
credit cards, there must have been 20 or 30 of them, to show how serious he was 
about getting tickets. I thought that was shady and wasn’t really comfortable 
dealing with people like that.” The last straw was when one primary ticket 
website wised up to the actions of one of Bennett’s clients and blocked his 
credit card.

The tout’s response was to use his daughter’s card instead. “That changed my 
mind about everything,” said Bennett. He handed in his notice shortly 
afterwards.

Welcome to the world of ticket touting in the UK. For as long as there have 
been ticketed events, there have been people trading on the fact that demand 
for live sports or music events outstrips supply. But the advent of the 
internet put rocket boosters under the trade. You can still find the 
old-fashioned touts outside venues, repeating their time-honoured mantra, 
“Tickets for the gig, buy or sell”, but these days the real money is made 
online by armchair touts who target the most popular events.

The armchair army will now be gearing up for the annual bonanza that is the 
British summer. Packed with sporting and musical events such as Wimbledon,
Radiohead at the Roundhouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/radiohead-tickets-roundhouse-london>
, the England v Sri Lanka Test series, the AC/DC tour – not to mention dozens 
of hugely popular festivals and outdoor gigs – the next few months will do 
wonders for the touts’ bank balances.

These individuals can hoover up hundreds of tickets at a time and sell them on 
at a huge mark-up via resale, or “secondary ticketing”, websites such as Get Me 
In, StubHub, Viagogo and Seatwave.

The mark-ups can be eye-watering. An extreme example was when a ticket for 
Adele at the O2 Arena in London in March waslisted on Get Me In for £24,840 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/27/adele-ticket-resale-prices>, 
some 290 times face value. WhenElton John tickets went on sale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/ticket-resale-sites-new-scrutiny-touting-seatwave-viagogo>
 at the end of last year with a top price of £90, minutes later the same 
tickets appeared on secondary ticket websites priced at £500.

So why is it that touts are able to sell gig tickets at such exorbitant prices?

Most ordinary fans simply don’t stand a chance. Within seconds of an event 
going on sale, the tickets are harvested in their thousands by a small but 
ruthlessly efficient army of touts, many using multiple credit cards to bypass 
the limit on the number of tickets that one person can purchase. They make 
their profit by flipping the tickets they secure on to the secondary ticketing 
sites.

Although secondary tickets are often advertised at a huge mark-up, there are 
usually enough devoted fans willing to pay what it takes to be there.

The tout makes a quick and easy profit, while the resale website takes a 
commission of anything up to 25%, or sometimes more.

Even more egregiously, secondary sites Get Me In and Seatwave are both owned 
by Ticketmaster, which ends up getting paid twice over. Everybody wins, except 
for the fans.

The Observer spoke to one seasoned tout, who has built a business worth 
hundreds of thousands of pounds, thanks to the secondary ticketing world. 
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that the use of multiple identities 
and credit cards – to circumvent limits on the number of tickets one person can 
buy – is commonplace.

“Yeah, that’s standard,” he said. “You can use multiple credit cards, multiple 
identities … it bypasses the ticket limits.”

Savvy touts, he said, will pay to join fan clubs in the knowledge that bands 
sometimes release tickets early to their most devoted followers. Even if they 
have to pay a subscription fee, the profit margin on the ticket easily covers 
the cost.

“You can make a lot of money,” he said. “If somebody buys £50,000 of tickets, 
they should be able to make £12,500 out of that.”

A few key players appear to play a pivotal role in the secondary ticketing 
game. Andrew Newman, for example, is just 25 years old but has built a 
business, Newman Corporation, worth £1.6m from his home just outside Glasgow.

He declined to comment on how the company operates or the methods he uses to 
get tickets.

One rung below Newman is Peter Hunter, who runs and part-owns TicketWiz, one 
of the UK’s most successful secondary ticketing businesses. The company has not 
published accounts since 2014, but these show a business whose assets increased 
in value from £157,000 to £270,000 in a year.

Another big player is Norfolk-based Maria Chenery-Woods, owner of Ticket 
Queen. Companies House filings show that the business had assets totalling 
£543,000 as of March 2014, up from £395,000 a year before.

Raymond Sullivan owns Double 8 Tickets, a firm with assets of more than 
£405,000 as of November 2014.

Asked how they got their tickets, one such individual simply said: “Front 
door, back door, side door.” An investigation by theObserver revealed at least 
10 businesses of similar scale, although the likelihood is that there are 
dozens, if not hundreds, more.

Whatever one makes of the morality of the ticketing money-go-round, some 
experts believe that the rules and regulations governing the system are 
routinely flouted. “There is no lawful way to harvest tickets in bulk,” argues 
Reg Walker, Britain’s leading ticket fraud expert and a director of ticket 
security firm the Iridium Consultancy.

He points to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading regulations 2008, 
which prohibit “falsely representing oneself as a consumer”. Anyone 
masquerading as different people to get hold of multiple tickets for the 
purposes of a sale risks breaching these regulations, he says. As for selling 
the tickets on, the Consumer Contracts regulations 2013 say that any trader 
using online secondary ticketing platforms should provide their identity and 
their address or contact details.

But punters will struggle to find an event on one of the secondary ticketing 
websites with information about who the seller is.

Last year measures were included in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 that require 
anyone who resells an event ticket via a secondary market website to provide 
details of the seat row and number, as well as the face value. Critics say that 
the secondary sites are routinely ignoring this requirement, too.

In November consumer group Which? said it had spent eight weeks investigating 
and had found that the rules were “being repeatedly flouted on all the major 
secondary ticketing sites”.

Often there is very little information provided about where someone who buys a 
ticket will end up sitting. Campaigners say such information would make it 
easier to cross-check whether tickets were being sold by genuine fans or touts 
in it for the money.

“It does appear that some secondary ticketing companies are breaking the law 
in the course of their business,” said Nitin Khandia, director at BTMK 
Solicitors, a legal adviser on consumer-related problems. These regulations are 
supposed to be enforced by local authorities, but with central government cuts 
biting they lack the resources to police the existing law.

It is not in the interests of resale websites, which make commission on every 
ticket sold, to crack down on touts who flout the law. And the touts themselves 
certainly have no interest in derailing the gravy train.

Another tout, who declined to give his name, said: “The whole system works to 
the detriment of the consumer. But what does taking the moral high ground mean 
for touts? It means bankruptcy.”

One measure of the power that touts wield is the extent to which they are not 
just tolerated by secondary websites but courted by them.

According to industry sources, back in 2011, before launching in the UK, 
StubHub threw a lavish party for some of the UK’s biggest touts at the Radisson 
Blu hotel in London’s Fitzrovia. Unlike Ticketmaster, which can boost secondary 
sales on Get Me In and Seatwave by redirecting fans to those sites, StubHub 
needed the touts on board – after all, they had the tickets.

“These sites are protecting the identity of the touts, and they’re doing it 
because they need them,” said Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is co-chair of the
all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jan/29/stamp-out-ticket-touts>. 
“Nobody’s policing this. I would say that the secondary market, and especially 
touting, is a parasitical business. They’re making money off the backs of other 
people’s hard work.”

The ticket sites have developed sophisticated lobbying efforts to support 
their opposition to any measures that might curb touting. Fan Freedom UK is a 
website that casts itself as a grassroots organisation for fans, battling 
against plans that might prevent ordinary people from selling on their tickets.

Only a prolonged look through its US parent website reveals the truth of who 
is behind it: “Initial funding for Fan Freedom and Fan Freedom UK was provided 
by StubHub, an eBay company.”

So why, with all this apparent evidence of dubious practices, is the 
government not doing more to crack down on ticket touting via resale sites? One 
of the reasons is that not all MPs are as anti-secondary ticketing as Hodgson. 
In a debate on secondary ticketing, Conservative MP Philip Davies branded 
fellow MPs trying to curb touting in the secondary market as “socialists”.

One of the arguments deployed by Davies is that curbing ticket resales would 
disadvantage the ordinary fan who simply wants to recoup money for a ticket he 
or she can no longer use.

But according to Reg Walker, legitimate resellers are very much in the 
minority on the major websites. “There was a WWE [wrestling] event in September 
where there were only 14,000 tickets released and 1,346 advertised on Get Me In 
the next day, so 10% of tickets have appeared immediately on the secondary 
sales.

“Are those people who had bought tickets and immediately decided they couldn’t 
go? Of course not. The overwhelming majority of tickets on resale platforms are 
being sold by traders.”

Now, however, the government has a new opportunity to tighten the law on 
secondary ticket sales.

Last October the government launched a long-awaited review of how the 
secondary ticket market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/21/prince-ticket-resale-websites-government-review-secondary-ticketing-market>
 was working, and whether consumers were sufficiently protected by the new 
rules. The review panel, chaired by Professor Michael Waterson, is due to 
release its findings in the next 10 days.

A number of politicians and music industry representatives are calling on the 
government to enforce the provision already made in the Consumer Rights Act 
and, ideally, go further by requiring ticket resellers to reveal their 
identities. “I’d like to see some form of enforcement,” said Hodgson. “The 
regulation and the laws that we have should be upheld.”

But those who will perhaps have more clout are the growing number of artists, 
including Elton John, Adele, Mumford & Sons, Little Mix, Royal Blood and 
Coldplay, who have become increasingly vocal in the past few years in their 
opposition to the way touts are allowed to use secondary sites. At the end of 
last year, Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay,co-signed a letter to the 
government 
<http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/stop-ticket-resale-sites-ripping-off-fans-coldplay-tell-uk-government/>
 with a number of other high-profile musicians calling for changes to the law 
to prevent ticketing resale sites from “ripping off fans”.

There are also now alternatives emerging to the secondary sites such as mobile 
ticket exchange app Twickets, which allows fans to offer tickets at face value 
or below for events they can no longer attend. Its founder, Richard Davies, is 
fed up with the greed of touts impinging on the rights of music and sports 
fans, and rejects the notion that touting is simply the free market in action.

“The argument that a crackdown on secondary sales is dangerous because it 
infringes people’s rights and could drive touting underground is nonsense, 
because we are already witnessing illicit behaviour,” he said. “Profiteering 
and deception are rife on the secondary platforms. Those selling through these 
channels are regularly breaking the law and the platforms themselves do very 
little about it.”

Ticketmaster failed to answer when asked to respond to this article, and 
StubHub declined to comment.
