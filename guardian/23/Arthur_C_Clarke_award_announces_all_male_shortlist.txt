Reinforcing science fiction's image as a boys club the UK's most prestigious 
prize for the genre, theArthur C Clarke award 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurcclarkeaward>, has announced an 
all-male shortlist – for only the second time in its history.

The six books in the running for the Arthur C Clarke – a mix of titles by 
major SF writers Kim Stanley Robinson and Ken MacLeod with lesser known debuts 
– follow an all-male shortlist for the reader-decided British Science Fiction 
Association prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/british-science-fiction-awards-finalists-shortlists>
, which was won earlier this week by Adam Roberts for Jack Glass.

Roberts failed to make the cut for the Clarke award, however, pushed out by 
Robinson's story of an inhabited solar system 300 years in the future, 2312, 
Scottish award-winner MacLeod's dystopian vision of a London where genetic 
defects can be wiped from unborn children, Intrusion, and Nick Harkaway's 
acclaimed Angelmaker, a whirlwind race to save the world from a 1950s doomsday 
machine. Canadian author Adrian Barnes, published by tiny press Bluemoose, is 
in the running for Nod, in which humanity's sudden inability to sleep has 
devastating consequences, Chris Beckett for Dark Eden, where the incestuous 
descendants of two stranded astronauts try to make a life for themselves on a 
far flung planet, and Peter Heller for the post-apocalyptic The Dog Stars, set 
in a world destroyed by the flu pandemic.

"This is a fascinating and complex shortlist that demands repeated attention 
and thoughtful interpretation. Shortlisting six books from a potential list of 
82 eligible submissions is no easy task by any critical standard," said the 
prize's director Tom Hunter.

Hunter said he was "very conscious" of the prize's male line-up, and pointed 
to the fact that four of the award's five judges were female – Juliet E 
McKenna, Ruth O'Reilly, Nickianne Moody and Liz Williams. He also highlighted 
that both 2012 and 2011's Clarke awards were won by female authors – Lauren 
Beukes for Zoo City, and Jane Rogers for The Testament of Jessie Lamb – and 
that of the 82 books submitted for the award, just 16 were written by women, 
and one by a woman and man team.

"We are all aware of the issues and broader conversations in the industry 
about gender parity, but when you look at the books coming in and the strength 
of the authors, all the judges were operating from the point of picking the 
best books," said Hunter. "That has to be made their priority, rather than 
selecting on gender."

The Clarke award was established in 1987 following a grant from Clarke 
himself, and the only other time it has had anall-male shortlist was in 1988

<http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/03/05/arthur-c-clarke-award-submissions-revealed/> 
include Mira Grant – who, under her two writing names, wasnominated for five 
Hugos at the weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/31/seanan-mcguire-hugo-awards-shortlist?INTCMP=SRCH>
 – Sarah Pinborough, Cherie Priest and G Willow Wilson. But major male names 
also failed to make the running: former winner China Miéville, Alastair 
Reynolds, M John Harrison, John Scalzi and Iain M Banks.

"It's a great shortlist," said Hunter of the books selected. "I think it's 
really strong, interesting and challenging. I really like it."

But Niall Harrison, editor-in-chief of speculative fiction magazine Strange 
Horizons <http://www.strangehorizons.com/>, said the all-male line-up was 
"frustrating", adding that "you couldn't ask for a much clearer illustration of 
the strengths and weaknesses of SF publishing in the UK," where science fiction 
by women has mostly been found in young adult and mainstream imprints, rather 
than adult genre publishers. "The shortlist includes stylistically and 
conceptually ambitious science fiction well worth reading; but it's frustrating 
that the judges had to make their selections from such a homogeneous pool of 
authors," said Harrison.

But Harrison felt that things were "looking up in 2013, thanks to newer 
imprints like Del Rey UK and Jo Fletcher Books, bringing in writers like Karen 
Lord, Stephanie Saulter, Kameron Hurley and EJ Swift".

The winner of this year's Clarke award will be announced on 1 May, when he 
will take home a cheque for £2,013.
