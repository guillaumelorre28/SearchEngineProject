Comments

In view of the debacle that beset solvers north of Manchester, of which others 
may still be blissfully unaware, it is amazing that there were as many entries 
as there were: 179, with no mistakes (except one TONKA BEAN). As far as can be 
ascertained post eventum, it appears that at the last minute those responsible 
for putting the paper to bed in various northern locations suddenly took fright 
at the blank grid for Carte Blanche, assumed it was a mistake, and decided to 
print the following week's puzzle in its place, but without changing the 
puzzle's header (and, of course, without consulting the setter). It didn't 
help, either, that the online puzzle did not appear on the Guardian Limited 
website on time, for apparently similar reasons, i.e. the supposed inability of 
their software to cope with a blank grid. I did everything I could to retrieve 
the situation, including an extended deadline, so I sincerely hope that 
everyone wanting to compete was able to do so, and I apologize once again, on 
the Observer's behalf, for the whole sorry saga.

Your favourite clue, of 18 mentioned, was 'Striving exists in what represents 
Japan?' for NISUS, two votes ahead of 'Endless hell? Girl coming round to give 
young parents a break' (BABY-SIT). One unfavourite vote was cast for my NARDOO 
clue because of its inclusion of the word 'Abos', which I regret. No one would 
have objected to 'Aboriginals', I guess. I probably chose the shorter form to 
fit the clue into one line, but it's a poor excuse.

'Carte Blanche' continues to be a popular 'special'; although it involves no 
extra effort from me, the extra challenge for solvers clearly produces an added 
sense of satisfaction on completion. MELODRAMATIC was a friendly word to clue, 
with many anagram and composite anagram possibilities. If I'd been competing 
myself I'm sure I'd have seized upon the 'actor + dilemma' combination (as many 
did) and tried to bring 'doctor' in, with oblique reference to Shaw's play. 
When an anagram like this is likely to be popular, it's important to combine it 
with some additional bit of wit and subtlety, as I never tire of advising you.

I was sad to hear of the recent death at 93 of Alfreda Blanchard, to whom 
Brian Head pays tribute in the latest issue of Crossword. Until failing health 
took its toll, Alfreda was a regular and enthusiastic Azed competitor, with a 
good number of HCs and VHCs to her name and a meticulous approach to cluing. 
For many years she helped Brian by checking and correcting each issue of his 
splendid publication. In his own words, 'It is highly likely that without 
Alfreda's help, support and encouragement the Crossword Club would not have 
survived for so long.'
