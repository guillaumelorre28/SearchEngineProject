<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/20/trinidadian-poet-vahni-capildeo-wins-2016-forward-prize-poetry>
, the Trinidadian poet Vahni Capildeo is in the running for the UK’s most 
lucrative award for poetry, the £20,000 TS Eliot award.

Measures of Expatriation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/measures-of-repatriation-vahni-capildeo-review-poetry-collection>
, which explores identity and the alienation of the expatriate, is one of 10 
collections in the running for the prize. It is up against collections from 
Alice Oswald, Ian Duhig and Denise Riley, all of which also appeared on the 
Forward shortlist. Oswald’sFalling Awake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/19/falling-awake-by-alice-oswald-review>
 examines mutability; Duhig’sThe Blind Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/06/the-blind-road-maker-ian-duhig-review-poetry-collection>
 draws from both Sterne’s Tristram Shandy and the life of the 18th-century 
polymath Blind Jack Metcalf; and Riley’sSay Something Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/say-something-back-denise-riley-review-poetry-son-jacob-a-part-song-maybe-not-under-answering-sky>
 revolves around her late son and includes her long poem about grieving and 
loss, A Part Song.

Publishers submitted 138 books for the prize. Judges and poets Ruth Padel, 
Julia Copus and Alan Gillis narrowed them down to a final 10, which also 
includes Scottish poet JO Morgan, chosen for Interference Pattern, a collection
described as a “bracing, original, disruptive book” in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/jo-morgan-interference-pattern-review>
. Rachael Boast makes the TS Eliot shortlist for Void Studies, the realisation 
of a project proposed by Rimbaud; Bernard O’Donoghue for The Seasons of Cullen 
Church, about his childhood in Co Cork; and Katharine Towers for her second 
collection, The Remedies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/15/the-remedies-katharine-towers-review-fanciful-talking-cure>
.

The shortlist is completed by Jacob Polley’s Jackself, a fictionalised 
autobiography told through the many “Jacks” of legend and folktale, and Ruby 
Robinson’s debut Every Little Sound.

Padel, who chaired the judging panel, said the judges had been “blown away by 
the brilliance and freshness of the entries … We were looking for musicality, 
originality, energy and craft, and we believe the shortlist reflects this in a 
wonderful range of important and lasting voices.”

Although the shortlist features only two contributions from small presses – 
Capildeo’s collection, published by Carcanet, and Robinson’s, published by 
Liverpool University Press – Padel said the judges “applaud the contribution of 
new and independent poetry publishers”.

“There were,” she said, “many more outstanding books from small presses than 
we were able to accommodate in our final shortlist: it is clear that such 
publishers are radically altering the landscape of contemporary poetry.”

The winner will be announced on 16 January. The TS Eliot prize has been 
running since 1993, and has been won in the past by Oswald, Derek Walcott, 
Seamus Heaney and Carol Ann Duffy.
