The founder of AO World <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ao-world> has 
defended the online appliance retailer's flotation as the shares languished 
below their offer price.

Reporting his first set of results since February's initial public offering 
(IPO) John Roberts said institutional shareholders, including Aviva and hedge 
fund manager Crispin Odey, were happy with their investments.

"They are not trying to make a flip with us in eight weeks. These are high 
quality investors. These are not thick people," he said. "People who speculate 
in short-term returns on a pop at our IPO I can't get too concerned about. They 
don't give a shit about me so I don't give a shit about them."

Annual operating profit before the £15.4m cost of the IPO fell 2.4% to £8.2m 
on revenue up 40% to £385m. Including IPO costs AO made a £7.2m loss.

AO, which sells kitchen appliances and televisions online from its warehouse 
in Crewe, floated at 285p a share. The price soared on the day of the IPO,
valuing AO at almost £1.6bn

, but the shares have traded below the offer price since 10 April. They fell a 
further 5% on Thursday to 248p, valuing AO at £1.04bn.

AO was the first retail IPO of a year in which a series of retailers have 
listed on the stock market. But investor appetite has cooled after various 
newly listed shares dropped below their IPO prices. Roberts, who founded the 
business in 2000 for a bet, made £86m by selling some of his shares before the 
flotation.

Setting out plans to open in Germany, Roberts said Europe was ripe for his 
combination of low prices, reliable delivery and good customer service.

"I think the German consumer is just as logical as UK consumers. People ask 
how can a business be valued at that when you make 11m quid. But if you believe 
in that [growth in Europe], wow it's cheap."

AO's earnings before interest, tax and other costs were £11.2m.
