Alice Cooper has revealed details of a forthcoming tribute album to his 
notorious social circle in the 70s. According to a recent interview with
Billboard 
<https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6538622/alice-cooper-new-album-paul-mccartney-dave-grohl-collaborations>
, the metal star’s record features the likes of Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl and 
Johnny Depp – and it’s almost complete.

Entitled Hollywood Vampires, the covers album is dedicated to “all the friends 
we’ve lost to drugs and alcohol over the years”, including Jimi Hendrix, Keith 
Moon and Harry Nilsson.

Cooper said: “The album’s done. It’s mixed, ready to go and I’m very, very 
happy with it. I’m really happy with all the stuff on it. [Paul] McCartney’s on 
it. [Ringo Starr’s drummer son] Zak’s on it. Dave Grohl is on it, [AC/DC’s] 
Brian Johnson – and in places where you wouldn’t expect them to be, that’s the 
cool thing.”


“I can’t really say [which covers will be on the album] right now, but if you 
think of it, who were the Hollywood Vampires? John Lennon was there. Jim 
Morrison was an early Vampire. We had Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon of course, Harry 
Nilsson, Marc Bolan. Those guys were all Vampires.”

He added: “The performers have to be dead. Or mentally dead. Or should be 
dead.”

 Named after the famous drinking gang that Cooper formed with Lennon, Nilsson, 
Moon and Starr at Los Angeles’ Rainbow Bar and Grill in the 70s, some of the 
members of themusical supergroup are scheduled to perform
