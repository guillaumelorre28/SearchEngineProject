The Labour MP Jo Cox has died after being shot and stabbed multiple times 
following a constituency meeting. Armed officers responded to the attack near a

was arrested in the area, police confirmed. The suspect was named locally as 
Tommy Mair.


Police added that Cox, 41, the MP for Batley and Spen, had suffered serious 
injuries and was pronounced dead at 1.48pm on Thursday by a doctor with 
paramedics at the scene.

Police confirmed that a man in his late 40s to early 50s nearby suffered 
slight injuries in the incident. They are also investigating reports that the 
suspect shouted “Britain first”, a possible reference to thefar-right political 
party of that name 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/25/truth-britain-first-facebook-far-right-bnp>
, as he launched the attack. Police are understood to be talking to at least 
one witness who claimed to have heard the attacker shout the words, and the 
motivation for the incident will form part of their inquiry.

Cox’s husband, Brendan, said after her death was announced: “Today is the 
beginning of a new chapter in our lives. More difficult, more painful, less 
joyful, less full of love. I and Jo’s friends and family are going to work 
every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the 
hate that killed Jo.

“Jo believed in a better world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-global-aid-worker-to-labour-adviser>
 and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy and a zest for life 
that would exhaust most people. She would have wanted two things above all else 
to happen now – one, that our precious children are bathed in love and two, 
that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn’t 
have a creed, race or religion, it is poisonous.

“Jo would have no regrets about her life, she lived every day of it to the 
full.”

The temporary chief constable of West Yorkshire police, Dee Collins, said 
there was a large, ongoing investigation, with heightened visibility patrols in 
the area. She added that weapons had been retrieved from the scene, including a 
firearm.

At the press conference announcing Cox’s death, Collins said: “Jo was attacked 
by a man who inflicted serious and sadly, ultimately fatal injuries. 
Subsequently there was a further attack on a 77-year-old man nearby who has 
sustained injuries that are non-life threatening.

 “Shortly afterwards, a man was arrested nearby by uniform police officers. 
Weapons including a firearm have also been recovered.

 “At 1.48pm, Jo Cox was pronounced deceased by a doctor working with a 
paramedic crew that was attending to her serious injuries.

 “This is a very significant investigation with a large number of witnesses 
that are being spoken to by the police at this time. There is a large and 
significant crime scene and there is a large police presence in the area. A 
full investigation is under way to establish the motive for this murder.”

There was police activity following the attack at a semi-detached house on the 
Fieldhead estate in Birstall. Thomas Mair, 52, is the registered occupier of 
the address, according to the electoral roll. Police have not officially 
confirmed the suspect’s identity.

A cordon surrounded the house as a helicopter circled overheard and forensic 
officers in boiler suits appeared to be searching the neat front garden, as 
well as around garages at the back of the property.

‘Britain first’

Graeme Howard, 38, who lives in nearby Bond Street, told the Guardian he heard 
the man shout “Britain first” before the shooting and during the arrest.

“I heard the shot and I ran outside and saw some ladies from the cafe running 
out with towels,” he said. “There was loads of screaming and shouting and the 
police officers showed up.

“He was shouting ‘Britain first’ when he was doing it and being arrested. He 
was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance.”

Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First, said the party was “looking 
into the reports right now”. “We were extremely shocked to see these reports 
and we are keen to confirm them, because of course at the moment it is 
hearsay,” she said. “This has just been brought to our attention. This is 
absolutely not the kind of behaviour we would condone.”

Other witnesses said the attack was launched after the MP became involved in 
an altercation involving two men near where she held her weekly surgery. A 
Labour source confirmed Cox was shot and stabbed after she had concluded the 
drop-in session for constituents at about 1pm.

The shopkeeper in a greengrocer opposite Birstall library, Golden D’Licious, 
told the Guardian that he believed the attacker had been waiting for the MP 
outside the library.


“I was inside the shop and all I heard was a scream and then the gunshot,” he 
said, without giving his name. “I went out and everyone was dispersing. I 
couldn’t see because it happened behind a car.”

Terry Flynn-Edwards, who runs the Divine hair studio opposite the scene of the 
attack, said a man from the dry cleaners had tried to stop the assault. She 
said: “She walked out of the library with her PA and he was waiting for her. He 
stabbed her first and this guy tried to stop him and then he shot her.”

But one witness, Hithem Ben Abdallah, 56, who was in the cafe next door to the 
library shortly after 1pm, said the MP was involved in an altercation between 
two arguing men.

He told the Press Association a man in a baseball cap “suddenly pulled a gun 
from his bag” and after a brief scuffle with another man the MP became involved.

He added: “He was fighting with her and wrestling with her and then the gun 
went off twice and then she fell between two cars and I came and saw her 
bleeding on the floor.”

Clarke Rothwell, another witness, told BBC News there was a direct altercation 
between Cox and a man carrying a gun, who “purposefully” targeted her.

“He shot this lady and then shot her again,” he said. “He leant down. Someone 
was wrestling with him and he was wielding a knife and lunging at her. Three 
times she was shot. People were trying to help her.

“Then he ran off down a one-way street. Me and my mate drove round to try and 
find him.”

A West Yorkshire police spokesman said: “At 12.53 today, police were called to 
a report of an incident on Market Street, Birstall, where a woman in her 40s 
had suffered serious injuries.”

The Priestley residential care home next door to the library on Market Street 
was thought to be in lockdown. The firm’s head office said all the residents 
were safe and accounted for following the shooting.

Neighbours on the Fieldhead council estate said the suspect had lived here 40 
years with a female relative, who died a number of years ago, leaving him alone.

Kathleen Cooke, 62, said she and her daughter, Emma John, 30, had seen Mair 
half an hour before the attack.

“I looked out of the window at about 12.30pm and he walked past carrying his 
bag, wearing a cap. He looked perfectly calm and normal,” said John. “He was a 
quiet person, kept himself to himself. We knew him around here from when he 
used to do our gardens,” said Cooke.

One woman, who gave her name just as Karen, said Mair had tended her mother’s 
garden regularly until a few years ago. He did not seem to have a job, she said.

Local teenagers said he was a quiet man unless they congregated on the wall 
behind his house, which he did not like. “He’d shout at us,” said a 
17-year-old. “All this we are hearing now is totally at odds with the man we 
thought we knew,” said one neighbour. “We knew him as someone who helped out, 
who did volunteering.”

Senior politicians expressed their shock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-attack-politicians-support-and-shock>
 at the killing and sent their condolences.

David Cameron said: “The death of Jo Cox is a tragedy. She was a committed and 
caring MP. My thoughts are with her husband Brendan and her two young children.”

Bernard Jenkin: we are all thinking about Jo Cox – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/16/bernard-jenkin-we-are-all-thinking-about-jo-cox-video>
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the country would be “in shock at the 
horrific murder” of the MP, who was a “much-loved colleague”.

Cox was elected to parliament in 2015, having previously worked 
internationally as a head of policy and humanitarian campaigning for Oxfam.

She chaired the all-party parliamentary group for Friends of Syria, and was 
vocal in making the case for military action in the country last autumn, on 
humanitarian grounds. Her husband is a former Labour adviser who stepped down 
as a senior executive of the charity Save the Children last year.

Cox’s fellow Labour MP John Mann described her as “one of the real stars of 
the new intake”, and said her colleagues were “absolutely stunned” by the 
attack.
