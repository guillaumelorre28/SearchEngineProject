AO World’s share price has been battered since it entered the stock market in 
February 2014, valued at £1.2bn, despite profits of less than £8m – a gap that 
raised eyebrows in the City. The company was forced to issue aprofits warning

 in February, when it admitted it may have been a victim of flotation hype.

Since then the sell-off has continued, led by chairman Richard Rose, who 
offloaded 5.58m shares

 in March. He sold the shares for 180p, a hefty discount to AO’s float price of 
285p when it joined the stock market last year.

AO World reported revenues of £477m for the year ending 31 March, up 24% on 
last year. Website sales for the UK rose 33% to £382m. But the firm was dragged 
into loss-making territory as it spent money on building a web presence in 
Germany.

John Roberts, AO World’s chief executive, said he was pleased with the firm’s 
progress in Germany.

“Our long-term plan is on track and, despite missing our financial 
expectations for the year, we have continued to take market share in the UK MDA 
[major domestic appliances] market.”
