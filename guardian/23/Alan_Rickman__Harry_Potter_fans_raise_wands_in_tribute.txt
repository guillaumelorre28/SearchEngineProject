Harry Potter <https://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter> fans around the 
world have been paying tribute to the actor Alan Rickman, who died on Thursday 
aged 69.

Rickman won fans across the generations for his roles in films such as Sense 
and Sensibility, Die Hard and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. But it was his 
part as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films which has dominated in the 
tributes offered on social media.

Many have used Twitter to pay homage to Rickman by “raising their wands” in 
reference to a scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Hogwarts 
students point their wands to the sky to honour the recently-deceased 
Dumbledore.

Meanwhile in Florida, a Universal Studios Orlando employee has placed a lily 
in front of the resort’s Potions Classroom.

Rickman’s farewell letter to the franchise has also been widely shared. 

And many fans have created artwork using the line of dialogue most frequently 
associated with the character.

The cast and crew of Harry Potter yesterday shared their sadness at the death 
of Rickman from cancer.

Daniel Radcliffe wrote <https://plus.google.com/+DanielRadcliffe/posts> that 
Rickman was “one of the greatest actors I will ever work with” as well as “one 
of the loyalest and most supportive people I’ve ever met in the film industry”.

The younger actor recalled how Rickman came to see every play he was in, and 
how all Rickman’s acquaintances enjoyed his attentive friendship: “If you call 
Alan, it doesn’t matter where in the world he is or how busy he is with what 
he’s doing, he’ll get back to you within a day.”

Said co-star Emma Watson: “I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with 
such a special man and actor. I’ll really miss our conversations. RIP Alan. We 
love you.” Rupert Grint said he was “devastated” and that “[e]ven though he has 
gone I will always hear his voice”.

Rickman’s illness had not been publicly known and the seeming suddenness of 
his death was reflected in many of the tributes. Jason Isaacs said he was 
“[s]idestepped by the awful news”. “The polar opposite of the icy, manipulating 
characters he became best known for, Alan was hilarious, warm-hearted and 
fabulous company.”

JK Rowling, who wrote the Harry Potter books, said: “There are no words to 
express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman’s death. He was 
a magnificent actor & a wonderful man.”
J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) 
My thoughts are with Rima and the rest of Alan's family. We have all lost a 
great talent. They have lost part of their hearts.

Michael Gambon – Dumbledore in the latter films – said: “Everybody loved Alan. 
He was always happy and fun and creative and very, very funny.”


Ralph Fiennes, who played Voldemort, described Rickman as “a dear friend”. “I 
cannot believe he is gone and we are the poorer for it,” he said. “But his 
spirit and great generosity live on the hearts of everyone who knew him. Funny, 
acutely perceptive, extraordinarily loyal and giving - Alan cared.”
