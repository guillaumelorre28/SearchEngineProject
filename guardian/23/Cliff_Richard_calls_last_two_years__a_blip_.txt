Sir Cliff Richard <https://www.theguardian.com/music/cliff-richard> has 
described the last two years of his life as a “blip” during his first major TV 
appearance since an investigation into child sex allegations was dropped.

The singer joined figures including Prof Stephen Hawking and actor David 
Hasselhoff at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards on Monday.


Richard walked the red carpet before the ceremony at the Grosvenor hotel in 
London. The awards honour the UK’s unsung heroes who have displayed courage, 
selflessness and achievement against the odds.

Richard said he was “bounding with energy” as he made his first major TV 
appearance since an investigation into child sex allegations was dropped. The 
singer retreated from public life during the inquiry.

“When you go through something like the last two years in my life, you realise 
how lucky you are really,” he said. “That’s just a blip in my life, really.”

He also told Sky News: “I’ve leaned on my faith for two years and I would not 
have it any other way. My faith stayed strong and now it’s stronger. I do 
believe God has a part to play in the fact that I’m still here and people still 
like me – it’s a miracle to me after all these years.”

Richard maintained his innocence throughout the 22-month police investigation, 
and was never arrested or charged. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the 
case in June due to insufficient evidence.

Richard also revealed he had plans to tour in mid-2017 and had learned how 
“reliant” he was on others during the past two years. “Of course, I knew I had 
good friends. I didn’t realise how good they were. When something like this 
happens, you’re suddenly surrounded by a force of energy and love.”
