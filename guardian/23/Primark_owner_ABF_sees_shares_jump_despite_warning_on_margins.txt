Primark and sugar group Associated British Foods is among the day’s biggest 
risers after a positive update, despite warning on margins at its discount 
retailer.

At its annual meeting the company said it expected progress in earnings and 
operating profit this year. It said the good underlying trading from last year 
had continued.

At its sugar business, it expected to benefit from price increases and from 
cost cutting. Its grocery operations were also forecast to continue growing, 
and it was continuing its expansion of Primark in its major markets.

The slump in the pound since the Brexit vote would boost the translation of 
its overseas earnings, but with Primark buying much of its merchandise in 
dollars and having half its sales in the UK in sterling, its UK margins would 
be hit this year.

Even so, the company’s shares have jumped 2% to £27.17.
