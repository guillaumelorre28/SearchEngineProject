April Fools’ Day may have been two weeks ago, but there’s no need to dip into 
the realms of fantasy tomfoolery to find Hollywood mashup movie ideas just as 
preposterous asBatman v Bananaman 
<http://www.wow247.co.uk/2016/04/01/batman-v-bananaman-movie-in-the-works/>. On 
Wednesday at CinemaCon in Las Vegas,Sony confirmed plans for a Men in Black/21 
Jump Street crossover film 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/13/trainspotting-2-elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-jump-street-men-black?>
, leading us to wonder what other famous franchises might prosper from being 
clumsily fudged together in the name of box office greenbacks.

Finally we know why JJ Abrams refused to sign for a follow-up to The Force 
Awakens. He’s been waiting for the chance to pitch Spock against Kylo Ren in a 
true clash of the pompous space opera titans. Just imagine it: the dark side of 
the Force v red matter, setting phasers to stun Yoda’s Force ghost, and perhaps 
a right royal smackdown between battling armies of ewoks andtribbles 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6LC-olw9Q>. Now who wouldn’t pay to see 
that? And at least Jar Jar Binks would finally have a rival for Hollywood 
history’s most pointless and irritating space creature in the shape of Simon 
Pegg’stesticle-faced sidekick <http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Keenser> from 
the Abrams reboot movies.

Her Majesty’s No 1 super-spy is sent to help out Ethan Hunt’s Impossible 
Missions Force (IMF) after Ernst Stavro Blofeld escapes from prison in London 
and resurfaces in New York. Bond is horrified at the greater technology and 
resources available to his American counterpart, while Hunt swiftly becomes 
pretty unimpressed with 007’s determination to sleep with every female member 
of his carefully recruited IMF team within minutes of meeting them, not to 
mention the manner in which at least a third of these passing paramours 
subsequently wind up dead. Set against the backdrop of a swanky New York opera 
house, Bond and Hunt turn on each other and engage in amask-ripping 
<http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Every-Great-Mission-Impossible-Mask-Rip-From-MI-I-IV-One-Video-74727.html>
 battle of such rabid intensity that both of them eventually suffers extreme 
identity amnesia. The evil Blofeld contentedly scoops up both brain dead, 
drooling spies in his supercool bad guy helicopter anddrops them down the 
nearest industrial chimney <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U00tRdMKTqI>.

Foul-mouthed misogynist, transphobic, magically alive teddy bear Ted 
<https://bitchmedia.org/post/even-a-stuffed-bear-gets-more-respect-than-trans-people>
 turns out to be pretty much immortal, and is therefore still alive in the 22nd 
century. Bereft of finances after long-term buddy Mark Wahlberg failed to wake 
up from a cannabis coma some time in the year 2059, he is a blue-collar worker 
on board the space freighter Nostromo when the ship’s captain decides to 
investigate a distress signal from a distant colony which has quite obviously 
been overrun by acid-blooded extra-terrestrial monstrosities from the seventh 
layer of Hades. Poor Ted is ripped into tiny teddy bear pieces as Wahlberg 
finally comes to on Earth and beginsnumbly reciting the words to the Thunder 
Buddies song <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PnNW56bp0>.

 Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop 2: now imagine a shark in that water … 
Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex 
Street-smart Detroit detective Axel Foley is seconded to a picturesque seaside 
resort in Martha’s Vineyard where it quickly becomes clear he is not the only 
fish out of water. When the town’s summer season is threatened by reports of a 
huge great white in the area, Foley teams up with hoary old shark hunter Quint 
and everyman local police chief Martin Brody in a daring attempt to catch the 
monstrous killer. In a thrilling final scene, he uses his potty-mouthed schtick 
to trick the giant fish into chomping down on a partially submerged electricity 
cable, then reveals to his amazed companions that the shark was deliberately 
imported by evil Mayor Vaughn in order to provide the perfect smokescreen for a 
coastal drug smuggling operation. As the enormous fish sinks beneath the waves, 
bags of cocaine begin to float the surface and the distinct chords of an 
ingenious shanty song a cappella version of Harold Faltermeyer’s Axel F can be 
heard ushering in the final credits.
