Icy weather in Canada <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/canada> has caused 
chaos on the roads and prompted people to abandon driving their cars and lace 
on their skates instead.

A storm that hit Ontario left roads coated in up to 15mm of ice, leading to 
car crashes.

Locals reported “freezing rain” falling from the sky and said it was 
impossible to walk outside without slipping over. The weather bureau warned of 
dangerous and icy conditions on the roads.

But some intrepid residents were determined to make the best of it. They took 
to iced-over roads in their skates and posted their uplifting antics on social 
media.

The road might not be the most ideal place to figure skate, but I'll take it
