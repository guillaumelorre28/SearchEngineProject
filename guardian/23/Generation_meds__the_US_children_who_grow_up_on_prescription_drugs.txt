In America, medication is becoming almost as much a staple of childhood as 
Disney and McDonald’s. Kids pack their pills for school or college along with 
their lunch money. Some are taking drugs for depression and anxiety, others for 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The right drugs at the right 
time can save young people from profound distress and enable them to 
concentrate in class. But some adolescents, critics say, are given medication 
to mask the ordinary emotional turmoil of growing up; there is a risk that they 
will never learn to live without it.

According to America’s Centers for Disease Control, 11% of four- to 
17-year-olds in the US have been diagnosed with ADHD, a label for those who are 
disruptive in class and unable to concentrate; just over 6% are taking 
medication. But the official figure hides huge variation across regions and 
class. Numbers are very high in the white, middle-class east coast population, 
says Ilina Singh, professor of neuroscience and society at Oxford University, 
while there is under-diagnosis in poor white populations and among ethnic 
minorities.

“In the middle-class, educated group in New York, you probably are seeing kids 
who are just under more academic pressure,” she says. “Parents will begin to 
look at psychiatric diagnosis and treatment with drugs as one option for making 
children perform better. You have parents saying, ‘My child must be on Ritalin 
because all the other children in the class are.’”

In the UK, meanwhile, about 3% of children are diagnosed with ADHD; just 1% 
are on medication. American children can go through six or seven different 
drugs quite early in their lives; in the UK, children are usually sent for 
cognitive behaviour therapy first, in line with guidance from the National 
Institute forHealth <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> and Care 
Excellence.

Medication for ADHD has long provoked controversy. But in recent years, the 
big upturn in the US has been in prescribing for depression and anxiety. It is 
now generally accepted, says David Healy, professor of psychiatry at Bangor 
University, that 20%-25% of students at most universities in the US are on 
medication, often on multiple prescriptions. There, he says, taking your meds 
is often seen as proof that a young person is dealing with their problems. “But 
you are not going to learn coping skills if you are taking pills,” he adds.

He believes the UK may follow where the US leads. Once, it was unusual for 
British children to be put on medication; mental health teams would expect to 
work with a family over issues such as divorce. But increasingly, Healy says, 
young people turning 18, who transition into the adult mental health services 
where he works, arrive with a diagnosis of ADHD, autistic spectrum disorder or 
even bipolar – and will argue that they should carry on taking the pills they 
have been given by the children’s services. “We used to have a world in which 
it was accepted that kids in their teens were confused,” he says. “It’s an 
extraordinary change compared with even five years ago. This is the new norm.”

I’ve always seen a psychotherapist. Then, a couple of years ago, when I was in 
drama class, I started twitching on stage. I tried acupuncture and hypnosis, 
but that was very high-maintenance. Medication wasn’t an option until the 
disorder became physically painful and socially crippling. I was constantly 
checking that I hadn’t lost something, turning my head around. Then my body 
needed to feel the muscle tension of looking backwards in order to feel at ease.

I started on a low dosage, and I initiated the whole thing. School was not 
involved, my parents were not involved. I’ve always been a perfectionist, 
focused on very little things, but the medicine helps relax those compulsions. 
I’m really thankful for it.

I’m taking pills for anxiety and repetitive behaviours. I realised I didn’t 
know much about the medication, so I read up; one is apparently prescribed for 
Tourette’s, but also ADHD and anxiety – it’s sort of a one-size-fits-all.

I’m studying in England now, so my doctor prescribed a dose that was higher 
than I actually take. I just brought a bunch with me, and had my mother send 
more. Here, medication seems less common, but it might simply be less 
discussed. People in the UK like downers, such as ketamine, so I guess Adderall 
is not their drug of choice.

I’m sure the medicine does terrible things to my liver, but the benefits 
outweigh the negatives. I’m probably a product of my generation, but I like 
quick fixes.

I did really badly in some tests. I got angry and gave random answers, and 
didn’t finish. So I got tested, which took four days and led to a 300-page 
report. That got me time and a half for tests, the same as five or six other 
people in my class of 30.

My usual dosage is 15mg, and at exam time I might take 35mg. But I don’t like 
the side-effects: depression, and a kind of OCD, sometimes headaches, or 
nausea. In the summer, I like to stop, so I don’t have the side-effects and I 
don’t have to take antidepressants.

My mum takes it, too, because she helps my father with his business. My father 
is a workaholic; he should really be on medication, too.

Since I started at art school, my workload has been consistently high – I 
might have five hours of homework a night – so my dosage has gone up.

When I don’t take them now, it’s OK – I’m not a zombie and can interact, but I 
am almostmore hyper. I am learning to sit down and concentrate when it comes to 
things I love or get excited about, but it doesn’t last as long as a natural 
attention span should.

I am continuing to be responsible. I make sure I eat before I take it, so I 
don’t get headaches. In college, many people see it as a smart pill and use it 
to get work done. They don’t understand the harm it does to your brain and 
heart. I feel it limits my creativity, though I have learned to think 
efficiently on it, even when it comes to my art.

I’m really OCD when it comes to my work: either something has to be made well 
or it has to be finished, and that’s a hard decision for me.

A lot of my friends who were on medication have stopped, to see if they are 
dependent on it, but some people abuse it to be productive. When they come to 
me around finals time, I’m like, “I’m sorry, there is no generic version of my 
pill, they are $90 a month, so, no, I’m not giving them to you!” And I’m not 
going to support that.

I can take my pill and not feel blocked any more. I have a huge problem with 
younger kids taking it, because a) it could be a phase, or b) they are not the 
ones who are able to control it – their parents make them take it. It works for 
me, because I’m educated about it. Obviously, I don’t want to be 30 and taking 
it. But as long as I’m in school and have these deadlines and pressure, for 
sure.

I started taking medicine when I was 14. I had been going to therapy for a few 
years, and it wasn’t enough. My father is a doctor, so he was very concerned 
about excesses in behavioural medication, but after three years of therapy, I 
had to take the meds. And I’m thankful – I’m significantly better. At first, I 
tried Cytomel combined with Zoloft, but I had terrible side-effects: they gave 
me cold sweats and I couldn’t sleep. BuSpar and Zoloft are working fine.

My condition has become more complex, but at the same time more manageable. I 
have major depression with symptoms of psychosis; I have episodes where I’m 
hallucinating, stuff like that. As you get older, all the hormonal pieces of 
the equation go away and it becomes more about the actual medical problem. I’m 
much more committed to my recovery. I’m taking my medicine; I have two 
therapists.

In college, people are open about their problems. Some try to utilise it for 
their work: “I’m disturbed and I make art!” I have to deal with people judging 
my work and not spiral into a depressive episode because someone doesn’t like 
my pictures. But I’m getting more confident, and starting to get some work.

I’m taking three medications, but pretty much the lowest recommended dose of 
each; I think I’ve worked out the emotional adjustment part, and now it’s just 
the chemical part.

I have more control over my schedule now I’m not in college. Also, in the 
professional world, I think people have fewer qualms when it comes to speaking 
about their issues. You have your hyperactivity issues, you have your 
depression issues, you have your anxiety problems – we all have issues, and 
that helps us stigmatise it less.

Most of my pills sell for about $100, and my insurance covers maybe half of 
it, so I have to pay $40 per bottle per month. My doctor doesn’t accept my 
insurance, so I have to pay him and my therapist. That gives me more incentive 
not to get too comfortable in my dosage. If I can be on a small dosage, or none 
at all, that would be great. All the signs are pointing to a functional, 
peaceful life.

When I was a kid, I would be a complete disruption, not letting anybody around 
me do their homework. I was the class clown. When I was 12, I was “diagnosed” 
by another parent. We went to the doctor, who had me tested; I’ve been on 
medication since then. There weren’t many kids who were taking it then; now, a 
good third of the school are.

I feel the medication constrains my creativity, so I don’t use it for music, 
but for school it really helps. My group of friends are more into a rock band 
lifestyle and don’t take so much medication. I think it is more common for 
people doing classical music, who need to practise a lot.

I was in therapy until about a year and a half ago. Now, if there is a special 
problem, my mother will make me go, to balance things out.

I went from a 250-student high school to a 4,000-student college, which was a 
shock. And in college, everyone is doing some kind of drug. Less than 10% of it 
is prescribed medication, but 50-60% of kids take drugs. I’d say that for every 
sale of pills, there are two sales of marijuana. I never heard of people 
getting in trouble for selling or buying the meds, but they do for marijuana or 
drinking.

Blue pills [Adderall] will sell for $2-$3 a pill, and orange pills [Adderall 
XR] for $10-$12, because they are slower release. Marijuana helps me work on my 
music; meds just make me feel like cleaning everything up. I even clean my 
mother’s room. When I have to do just one thing, I’ll take the blue pill rather 
than the orange pill.

I’ve been taking Adderall on and off for nine years. I’ve kind of turned to 
coffee now, and that’s been working out really well – I’ve been getting just as 
much done. My doctor thinks it’s great. The priority of all doctors, really, 
should be to move their patients off medication.

I’m studying psychology, and I want to go into clinical psychiatry so I can 
help people in the same position I was in. I want to be able to help people 
like my mother, people who have a psychosis. After so many years of talking to 
people who are prescribed the wrong medicine, I feel like I’m able to judge 
that very well. There is a paradox to it: I believe that medication is 
absolutely necessary, but necessary to start you on a journey towards ridding 
yourself of medication.

I don’t see myself taking medicine in five years’ time. More coffee, less 
Adderall.

I’m not sure I like my medication. I see a little change, but not as much as I 
think I should. It makes me lose my appetite, and then I’m kind of spacey, 
because I didn’t eat. Some girls use it to lose weight, and some people snort 
it to get high. I try taking it every day but sometimes I’ll forget or I just 
don’t want to. Last summer, I didn’t take any.

Adderall definitely helps with homework. I’m supposed to take it every day, 
but I take it only when I need to. I also take an instant-release pill around 
1pm, before school lets out; otherwise, I couldn’t do my homework, because the 
effects of Adderall wear off in the afternoon. Sometimes I’ll take it to do 
homework, and end up just calling somebody and having a long conversation, or 
cleaning my room. I’ll get sidetracked and procrastinate, but I’m really 
focused on what I’m procrastinating about.

I started getting a lot of bad panic attacks, mostly school-related, so they 
put me on Zoloft. They gave me Lorazepam for when I have a bad one; it’s a 
benzo[diazepine], so it turns off some of your brain receptors. I’m also 
interested in cannabis as a medicine, especially CBD [cannabidiol] oil, which 
is not psychoactive. It doesn’t have all the side-effects, the jaw chattering, 
jitteriness and weird gagging that Zoloft gave me.

For a while, I was trying to start a learning disability club at school, but I 
couldn’t get the numbers. I feel that people don’t want to own up to it. But 
it’s a double standard, because at exam time, everybody is trying to find 
Adderall. And they’ll go to the kids who they know have learning disabilities –
nowyou’re my friend.

In terms of college, I’m trying to go to a school with not too much academic 
pressure, because that’s what gives me panic attacks. I don’t want to be put on 
antidepressants. As for the ADHD, I haven’t found another option.

Sixth grade was just a disaster. It was fast-paced, with reading and tests, 
simply too much. So my mother switched me to the Montessori school, where all 
the kids had their own gifts and disorders, so I fitted in perfectly. I’m sure 
a lot of people there were taking some kind of medication. My mother thought it 
might be helpful, so we tried Albuterol and Adderall. Then we got to Ritalin.

It helps if I take it and then do something physical for 20 minutes, to get 
the blood circulating, so that when it kicks in I can hit the ground running. 
Doing parkour and just going through the woods is a great way to clear my head. 
I think it’s a good exercise just to learn how to focus, to be more in control.

I still take medication, but less frequently than when I was in school. Now 
I’m on a better schedule and more organised. If I don’t get enough sleep and 
have to be at work at 8am (I’m a personal trainer), I’ll use Focalin to keep me 
up and keep me alert.

Another bonus of stimulants is that they curb my hunger, so if I don’t bring 
lunch with me, I can take a pill, skip a meal and it doesn’t kill me. 
Yesterday, I ate an apple before I worked out, because I know it’ll give me 
enough energy and carbs for what I need to do. If I take a Focalin an hour 
before that, my workout is perfect.
