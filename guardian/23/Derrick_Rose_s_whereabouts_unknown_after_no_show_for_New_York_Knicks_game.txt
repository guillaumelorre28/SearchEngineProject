York Knicks <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-knicks> point guard was 
mysteriously absent for the evening’s game with the New Orleans Pelicans at 
Madison Square Garden.

ESPN reported at least one team official who attempted to contact Rose before 
the game was unable to reach the former NBA MVP, while Adrian Wojnarowski of 
The Verticalreported

Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, who had made no mention of Rose’s absence when he 
spoke with the media during his pre-game availability, repeatedly deflected 
questions regarding his star guard after the game.

“Everything will become clear later on,” Hornacek said. “We want to respect 
whatever he’s going through and we’re just not going to comment about it.”

New York center Joakim Noah said after the game that he had spoken to Rose and 
his longtime teammate with the Chicago Bulls was OK.

“Obviously, Derrick’s one of our better players and when he’s not here it’s 
tough, but just happy that everything is OK with him,” Noah said.

Noah didn’t provide any details of their conversation.

Frank Isola of the New York Daily News, citing a source close to the player, 
reported that Rose attended the Knicks’ morning shoot-around at their 
Westchester practice facility, but that by Monday night there were “strong 
indications that [he] returned to his hometown of Chicago”.

The 28 year-old has averaged 17.3 points, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds in 33 
games in his first season with the Knicks after joining New York in a June 
trade from Chicago, who made him the No1 pick in the 2008NBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> draft.
