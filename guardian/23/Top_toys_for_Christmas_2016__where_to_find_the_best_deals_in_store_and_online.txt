If you’re planning to purchase one of the top 12 toys for Christmas this year, 
you’d better get a move on. Toy retailers and supermarkets are competing to 
lure in the first wave of Christmas shoppers to their stores and, toy experts 
say, will price this year’s must-have toys most keenly over the next fortnight. 
However, in some cases, stock is already running low.


According to the Toy Retailers’ Association, the top sellers this year  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/uk-toy-sales-christmas-presents-children>
will include an interactive bird that hatches itself from an egg, a selfie 
stick attached to a microphone and a wacky “mouthpiece challenge game” where 
players must try to say silly phrases wearing a mouthpiece that prevents them 
from closing their mouth.

The toys are not cheap: they are priced at £53.74 each on average, with four 
being sold for £90 or more. To help you find the best possible deal, we 
compared the lowest prices in-store and online (including delivery) of the 12 
toys.


Hatchimals


RRP £59.99 (ages five and up)

An interactive bird that pecks its own way out of the egg it arrives in, as 
long as you cuddle and stroke the egg for about 20 minutes. Once it is hatched, 
if you continue to provide it with loving attention, it changes its behaviour 
from a baby to a toddler to a fully-grown Hatchimal that can walk, talk and 
play games.

Cheapest in-store price: £59.99, but it is sold out at all the major retailers 
in the UK, apart from a few branches of Argos – checkStockinformer.co.uk 
<http://www.stockinformer.co.uk/argos-reserve-hatchimals> for up-to-date 
information. Limited stock is expected by late November.

Cheapest online price: £105, eBay; £118, Amazon

Speak Out


RRP £19.99 (ages 16+)

This game forces players to try to say phrases such as “He’s my stealthy pet 
ferret named Garrett” while wearing a transparent mouthpiece that makes it 
impossible to close your mouth. It’s perfect for drunken dinner parties, 
apparently.

Entertainer, Tesco, John Lewis and Asda. Tesco has stock of a similar game

With parking spaces for 36 cars, this is the biggest Hot Wheels garage you can 
buy (until they bring out an even bigger one). It features a light-up fire 
engine bell, a helicopter pad, two elevators and two ramps – but watch out for 
the chomping shark lurking at the bottom. Five vehicles and a helicopter are 
included.
