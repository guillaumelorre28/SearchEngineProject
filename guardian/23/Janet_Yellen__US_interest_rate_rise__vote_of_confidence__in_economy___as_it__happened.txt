Closing summary: Trump casts a cloud over the Fed's big day

conference. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP 
We’ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> to raise interest rates. 
And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month’s US presidential 
election rather overshadowed it.

So what did we learn?

1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as 
America’s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since 
December 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a0fae4b04a37cde478e0#block-5851a0fae4b04a37cde478e0>
.

She said:

 “Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection 
of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment 
that that progress will continue.

It is a vote of confidence in the economy.”

But this sunny view didn’t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press 
conference that the Fed was operating under a ‘cloud of uncertainty’, until it 
knows more about what Donald Trump will do.

Understatement of the year. Janet Yellen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/janet-yellen> says at her press 
conference: "We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment."

2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was 
doing fine, thanks, without Trump’s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a23de4b09c6e19813803#block-5851a23de4b09c6e19813803>
.

She said:

There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that 
the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal 
policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full 
employment.

But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to 
the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for 
policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of 
and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.”

3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen’s most stirring 
moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a432e4b03593d414efcd#block-5851a432e4b03593d414efcd>
.

Asked about Trump’s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that 
Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another “devastating financial crisis”

“I would say it’s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes 
that could be made and we’ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of 
compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for 
smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to 
enhanced credential supervision.

But I would urge that it’s important to keep this in place.”

4) Yellen found herself in Trump’s crosshairs several times during the 
election campaign, but she’s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a5ece4b09c6e19813816#block-5851a5ece4b09c6e19813816>

Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere 
until her first term expires in 2008:

“I do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven’t made any decision about 
the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It’s a decision I 
don’t have to make and don’t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I 
recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that’s a decision for 
another day.”

5) Markets react, despite Yellen’s calming words. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851b32be4b03593d414f031#block-5851b32be4b03593d414f031>

Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn’t radically changed 
its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, 
not two).

This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and 
involves changes by only some of the participants.

But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded 
that Trump’s election win changes the monetary policy landscape.

Here’s a little more reaction:

You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. 

The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 
0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points.

The wider S&P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%.

That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted.

Here’s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today’s developments:

The US Federal Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> 
on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the 
second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted 
three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate 
hikes.

Janet Yellen, the Fed <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> 
chairwoman, said “growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower” as 
she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%.

It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the 
benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis.

“My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has 
made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,” 
Yellen said.

“We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market 
strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of 
years.”

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> are even 
more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year.

That’s partly due to Donald Trump’s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even 
though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn’t need the extra help).

Capital Economics analysts say:

As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second 
time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first 
increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began.

With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of 
a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace 
of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year 
followed by three in the second half.

Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn’t 
underestimate the importance of today’s rate hike: 

“While this was universally expected, we shouldn’t forget that this is still a 
big milestone.

It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The 
Fed’s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two 
previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that

Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more 
hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate 
rises next year, up from 2 in September)

Markets in the red after Yellen speaks

I”ll post a snap summary of Yellen’s press conference next.

In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as 
investors digest the Fed’s rate hike and guidance for 2017.

All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow 
Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed.

The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed’s forecast 
for three rate hikes in 2017.

It’s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052.

Yellen: We can't solve economic inequality

And finally, we get another question about the US election...

Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate 
performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the 
economy?

Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth 
inequality, and the fact that many families haven’t seen real wage gains.

These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the 
recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them.

And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can’t solve these problems -- 
this is one for politicians.

Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation 
rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds.

Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African 
American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference 
and heading to the door.

Yellen: I want to serve my full term

Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still 
planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term?

Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she 
would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018).

She’s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still 
serve on the Fed board otherwise.


I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds.

Yellen: We're operating under a cloud of uncertainty

Q: Did you discuss Donald Trump’s economic plans at this week’s meeting, and 
the effect that his victory has had on the financial markets?

Yellen reveals that the FOMC did indeed talk about this.

All the participants agreed there was considerable uncertainty about how 
economic policies will change, she says, adding:

We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.”

Yellen defends financial regulations

The next question is also about Donald Trump, and his pledge to scrap some 
financial regulation, such as the Volcker Rule (which stops banks making 
riskier bets with their own money).

Yellen launches a strong defence of the measures taken in recent years, saying:

We lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge impact on our 
economy.

Most policymakers came away from that crisis thinking we must take steps to 
avoid a repeat, and “I feel we have done that”, she adds.

close   Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen speaks during today’s news 
conference. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP 
We’ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> to raise interest rates. 
And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month’s US presidential 
election rather overshadowed it.

So what did we learn?

1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as 
America’s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since 
December 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a0fae4b04a37cde478e0#block-5851a0fae4b04a37cde478e0>
.

She said:

 “Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection 
of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment 
that that progress will continue.

It is a vote of confidence in the economy.”

But this sunny view didn’t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press 
conference that the Fed was operating under a ‘cloud of uncertainty’, until it 
knows more about what Donald Trump will do.

Understatement of the year. Janet Yellen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/janet-yellen> says at her press 
conference: "We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment."

<https://twitter.com/pgogoi/status/809126314775080960> 
2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was 
doing fine, thanks, without Trump’s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a23de4b09c6e19813803#block-5851a23de4b09c6e19813803>
.

She said:

There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that 
the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal 
policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full 
employment.

But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to 
the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for 
policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of 
and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.”

3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen’s most stirring 
moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a432e4b03593d414efcd#block-5851a432e4b03593d414efcd>
.

Asked about Trump’s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that 
Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another “devastating financial crisis”

“I would say it’s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes 
that could be made and we’ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of 
compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for 
smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to 
enhanced credential supervision.

But I would urge that it’s important to keep this in place.”

4) Yellen found herself in Trump’s crosshairs several times during the 
election campaign, but she’s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851a5ece4b09c6e19813816#block-5851a5ece4b09c6e19813816>

Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere 
until her first term expires in 2008:

“I do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven’t made any decision about 
the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It’s a decision I 
don’t have to make and don’t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I 
recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that’s a decision for 
another day.”

5) Markets react, despite Yellen’s calming words. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-wages-pound-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live?page=with:block-5851b32be4b03593d414f031#block-5851b32be4b03593d414f031>

Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn’t radically changed 
its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, 
not two).

This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and 
involves changes by only some of the participants.

But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded 
that Trump’s election win changes the monetary policy landscape.

Here’s a little more reaction:

You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. 

The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 
0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points.

The wider S&P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%.

That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted.

Here’s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today’s developments:

The US Federal Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> 
on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the 
second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted 
three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate 
hikes.

Janet Yellen, the Fed <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> 
chairwoman, said “growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower” as 
she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%.

It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the 
benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis.

“My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has 
made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,” 
Yellen said.

“We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market 
strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of 
years.”

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> are even 
more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year.

That’s partly due to Donald Trump’s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even 
though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn’t need the extra help).

Capital Economics analysts say:

As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second 
time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first 
increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began.

With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of 
a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace 
of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year 
followed by three in the second half.
 
Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn’t 
underestimate the importance of today’s rate hike: 

“While this was universally expected, we shouldn’t forget that this is still a 
big milestone.

It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The 
Fed’s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two 
previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that 
confidence in the growth outlook is increasing”
 
Investors are also dumping US government debt, sending the interest rate (or 
yield) on Treasury bills higher.

Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more 
hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate 
rises next year, up from 2 in September)
 
I”ll post a snap summary of Yellen’s press conference next.

In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as 
investors digest the Fed’s rate hike and guidance for 2017.

All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow 
Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed.

The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed’s forecast 
for three rate hikes in 2017.

It’s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052.
 
And finally, we get another question about the US election...

Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate 
performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the 
economy?

Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth 
inequality, and the fact that many families haven’t seen real wage gains.

These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the 
recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them.

And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can’t solve these problems -- 
this is one for politicians.

Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation 
rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds.

Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African 
American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference 
and heading to the door.

Q: virtually every economist expected a rate rise today - does the Fed need

Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still 
planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term?

Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she 
would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018).

She’s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still 
serve on the Fed board otherwise.


I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds.
