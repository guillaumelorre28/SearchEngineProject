Afternoon summary

 * Theresa May has sought to fend off a parliamentary revolt over Brexit by 
promising to publish a negotiating plan, but says she will challenge MPs to 
vote in favour of triggering article 50 by the end of March. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/may-says-she-will-reveal-brexit-plan-before-triggering-article-50>
 * Unite leader Len McCluskey is to seek re-election for a further term of 
office from next April. Balloting will start in March and end on April 28, with 
assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail taking over as acting leader for the 
election period. Andhis supporters of McCluskey are planning to run a slate of 
candidates for positions in Britain’s biggest union as their general secretary 
prepares to stand down. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/len-mccluskey-unite-alliance-supporters-executive-council>
 * The contributory welfare system is a “sham” and should be replaced by a 
private insurance scheme, a thinktank headed by the Conservative former work 
and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has recommended. As the Press 
Association reports, middle class claimants are being failed because the system 
does not reward those who have paid the most in, according to the Centre for 
Social Justice (CSJ). Welfare reforms mean a claimant who has paid national 
insurance for 25 years could receive less than a 25-year-old who has worked 
sporadically, it found. Cutting ties with the European Union will free the 
government from Brussels’ rules that have stopped it axing the contributory 
system, the CSJ claimed. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Labour welcomes 'hugely significant climbdown' from government over Brexit

The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party has put out a 
press notice describing the government amendment as a “significant concession”. 
It implies that the party will accept the government amendment, but does not 
say so explicitly.

The press notice says:

The government has accepted a Labour motion that calls for the government to 
publish a plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked.

Facing a likely rebellion on their own backbenches, the government has made a 
significant 11th hour concession. The motion will be debated tomorrow in the 
House of Commons.

Labour have consistently emphasised they will not delay or frustrate the 
process of triggering article 50, but that the government need to publish a 
plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked.

And it includes this quote from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. 


This is a welcome and hugely significant climbdown from the government.

For the last two months Labour have been pushing the government to put their 
plan for Brexit before parliament and the public. Without that plan, we have 
had unnecessary uncertainty, speculation and a running commentary on the 
government’s likely approach.

The government have now agreed to publish that plan, and to do so before 
article 50 is invoked.

Labour will hold the government to account on this. We will also push for a 
plan to be published no later than January 2017 so that the House of Commons, 
the devolved administrations, the Brexit Select Committee and the British 
people have a chance to scrutinise it.

(I disagree. As far as I can see, accepting the government amendment does not 
amount to giving Theresa May a blank cheque, because there is nothing in it 
that would stop the opposition amending the article 50 legislation due to be 
passed if the government loses in the supreme court. Those MPs who are opposed 
to the government triggering article 50 could not accept the amendment. But Sir 
Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and his colleagues have repeatedly 
said that blocking article 50 is not the opposition’s policy; it wants to 
qualify the legislation, but not to obstruct it.)

Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU and its main financial backer, says he 
thinks the government’s handling of this shows how its approach to Brexit has 
been a “shambles”.
Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) 
This government hasn't got a clue how to leave and do a deal with the EU. 
better to bring in top flight businessmen, shambles to date

Tom Brake, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, claims that government has 
now finally admitted the need for a Brexit plan. Commenting on the government’s 
amendment he said:

Five months on, finally this Conservative Brexit government is admitting that 
triggering article 50 without a plan would be like jumping out of a plane 
without a parachute.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> must now drop 
the platitudes and come up with clear answers on the big questions facing the 
country, including membership of the single market.

Anything less risks plunging our economy into years of damaging uncertainty 
while the government desperately tries to stitch up a deal behind closed doors.

Ultimately, the British people must also be given a say on the final deal 
negotiated so that they can decide whether it’s right for them.

Sir Gerald Howarth, the Conservative MP who was a strong leave supporter, has 
told Sky News that he supports the government amendment and that it shoots 
Labour’s fox. Asked if this was a climbdown byTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, he said:

The Labour fox has been shot. It’s a great opportunity now for the House to 
come together and do what I think the vast majority of people in the country 
want, particularly industry and commerce; they want us to get on with the 
process of renegotiating our position, negotiating our exit from theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, and this motion states that we 
will do that. We will serve notice on the EU by 31 March 2017 as the prime 
minister indicated was her intention. If the whole House can come behind that, 
I think that’s a great move.

No 10 source says government amendment will force Labour and Lib Dem MPs to 
confirm they back Brexit

Number 10 take the view that accepting the Labour motion, with the government 
amendment, doesn’t amount to much. “It doesn’t change our approach to the 
government’s plan,” a source said. “But what it does do is forceLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and Lib Dem MPs who say they 
support the referendum result to actually do it.”

May backs down over Brexit plan - Summary and analysis

Here is a summary of what is happening.

 * Theresa May has accepted a Labour call for the government to publish a plan 
for Brexit before triggering article 50 (which means before the end of March).
Tomorrow MPs will debate a motion chosen by Labour and Labour has tabled this 
motion. Luke Jones (@Lukejones03) 
Labour motion for Weds calling for more info from gov on #brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash>. Former Tory minister tells #wato 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/wato?src=hash> 'up to 40' Tory MPs could vote for 
it'pic.twitter.com/2P3XyQ7Mka <https://t.co/2P3XyQ7Mka>
 <https://twitter.com/Lukejones03/status/805759726990532608> December 5, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Lukejones03/status/805759726990532608> 
Yesterday the government would not say whether it would support this motion. 
But some Tory MPs indicated that they would vote for it, meaning the government 
was facing the real prospect of defeat. This afternoon it has announced it will 
not ask Conservative MPs to oppose the motion. Instead, it will ask them to 
back a government amendment, accepting everythingLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> says - ie, accepting the call for 
a “plan” to be published - but adding some new conditions.

 * May is challenging Labour and other opposition MPs to accept three 
conditions; that article 50 should be invoked by the end of March; that the 
result of the referendum should be accepted; and that the publication of the 
plan should not undermine the government’s stance in the Brexit negotiations.
Labour is likely to accept all three conditions. Indeed, the final one is very 
similar to one contained in Labour’s own motion. 
 * It is likely that the Labour motion, as amended by the government, will be 
passed by MPs tomorrow without opposition. A similar thing happened in October, 
when Labour tabled a motion saying there should be a debate on Brexit before 
the triggering of article 50 and the government accepted it rather than risk 
defeat. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe3a43e4b03b22b4fb2964#block-57fe3a43e4b03b22b4fb2964>
Analysis: With Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> 
as shadow Brexit secretary, Labour is adopting a cautious and incremental 
approach to shifting government policy on Brexit. Twice now Labour has made 
modest demands in the Commons - a vote on Brexit, the publication of a plan - 
and twice now the government has to concede its demands, against Theresa May’s 
initial wishes. Starmer seems to be a pragmatist who would rather chalk up a 
minor victory than a glorious defeat, and he has shifted the government.

But the government is not committing itself, in the wording of the motion and 
the amendment, to publishing a proper 100-page white paper or whatever. The 
Labour motion just talks about the government having to publish a “plan”. 
Conceivably this could amount to a handful of tweets; more realistically, if 
the government refuses to publish a white paper, it could just release a 
written ministerial statement with a 300-word summary of what the government 
hopes to achieve. This would be in keeping with the letter of what it is 
agreeing too, if not the spirit.

That seems to be what the government is briefing.
Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) 
No 10 says amendment is NOT commitment to publish anything specific OR to have 
a vote in parliament before article 50 button is pushed...
 <https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/806172419794866176> December 6, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/806172419794866176> 
But Labour can take some consolation from the fact that, now the government 
has shifted ground twice, it is not inconceivable that it will be forced to 
make further parliamentary concessions on Brexit in the future.

May accepts Labour's call to publish Brexit plan before triggering article 50

The government has tabled an amendment to the Labour motion being debated 
tomorrow. It accepts what theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> motion says about the need for 
the government to publish a plan for leaving the EU before triggering article 
50. But it also says the Commons should accept the outcome of the referendum, 
and it says the government should trigger article 50 by the end of March.

Gerard Batten, Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, has welcomed the fact that Michel 
Barnier confirmed that Britain would not be able to control EU immigration if 
it remained in the single market. Batten said:

We in Ukip had made it plain during the referendum that to control our borders 
and immigration we would have to leave the single market. But in doing so, like 
every other non-EU country in the world, we would retain access to the single 
market under WTO rules.

What part of ‘leave the single market’ don’t the remainers understand? It is 
always good to be able to agree with one’s political opponents, and Monsieur 
Barnier has made it plain that there is no point in long protracted 
negotiations with the EU that will achieve nothing. We have to leave as quickly 
as possible!

 * The contributory welfare system is a “sham” and should be replaced by a 
private insurance scheme, a thinktank headed by the Conservative former work 
and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has recommended. As the Press 
Association reports, middle class claimants are being failed because the system 
does not reward those who have paid the most in, according to the Centre for 
Social Justice (CSJ). Welfare reforms mean a claimant who has paid national 
insurance for 25 years could receive less than a 25-year-old who has worked 
sporadically, it found. Cutting ties with the European Union will free the 
government from Brussels’ rules that have stopped it axing the contributory 
system, the CSJ claimed. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party has put out a 
press notice describing the government amendment as a “significant concession”. 
It implies that the party will accept the government amendment, but does not 
say so explicitly.

The press notice says:

The government has accepted a Labour motion that calls for the government to 
publish a plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked.

Facing a likely rebellion on their own backbenches, the government has made a 
significant 11th hour concession. The motion will be debated tomorrow in the 
House of Commons.

Labour have consistently emphasised they will not delay or frustrate the 
process of triggering article 50, but that the government need to publish a 
plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked.

And it includes this quote from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. 


This is a welcome and hugely significant climbdown from the government.

For the last two months Labour have been pushing the government to put their 
plan for Brexit before parliament and the public. Without that plan, we have 
had unnecessary uncertainty, speculation and a running commentary on the 
government’s likely approach.

The government have now agreed to publish that plan, and to do so before 
article 50 is invoked.

Labour will hold the government to account on this. We will also push for a 
plan to be published no later than January 2017 so that the House of Commons, 
the devolved administrations, the Brexit Select Committee and the British 
people have a chance to scrutinise it.

(I disagree. As far as I can see, accepting the government amendment does not 
amount to giving Theresa May a blank cheque, because there is nothing in it 
that would stop the opposition amending the article 50 legislation due to be 
passed if the government loses in the supreme court. Those MPs who are opposed 
to the government triggering article 50 could not accept the amendment. But Sir 
Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and his colleagues have repeatedly 
said that blocking article 50 is not the opposition’s policy; it wants to 
qualify the legislation, but not to obstruct it.)

Tom Brake, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, claims that government has 
now finally admitted the need for a Brexit plan. Commenting on the government’s 
amendment he said:

Five months on, finally this Conservative Brexit government is admitting that 
triggering article 50 without a plan would be like jumping out of a plane 
without a parachute.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> must now drop 
the platitudes and come up with clear answers on the big questions facing the 
country, including membership of the single market.

Anything less risks plunging our economy into years of damaging uncertainty 
while the government desperately tries to stitch up a deal behind closed doors.

Ultimately, the British people must also be given a say on the final deal 
negotiated so that they can decide whether it’s right for them.

Sir Gerald Howarth, the Conservative MP who was a strong leave supporter, has 
told Sky News that he supports the government amendment and that it shoots 
Labour’s fox. Asked if this was a climbdown byTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, he said:

The Labour fox has been shot. It’s a great opportunity now for the House to 
come together and do what I think the vast majority of people in the country 
want, particularly industry and commerce; they want us to get on with the 
process of renegotiating our position, negotiating our exit from theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, and this motion states that we 
will do that. We will serve notice on the EU by 31 March 2017 as the prime 
minister indicated was her intention. If the whole House can come behind that, 
I think that’s a great move.
 
Neil Carmichael, a pro-remain Conservative MP who had been considering backing 
theLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> motion, is now backing

Number 10 take the view that accepting the Labour motion, with the government 
amendment, doesn’t amount to much. “It doesn’t change our approach to the 
government’s plan,” a source said. “But what it does do is forceLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and Lib Dem MPs who say they 
support the referendum result to actually do it.”
 
Here is a summary of what is happening.

 * Theresa May has accepted a Labour call for the government to publish a plan 
for Brexit before triggering article 50 (which means before the end of March).
Tomorrow MPs will debate a motion chosen by Labour and Labour has tabled this 
motion. Luke Jones (@Lukejones03)

Yesterday the government would not say whether it would support this motion. 
But some Tory MPs indicated that they would vote for it, meaning the government 
was facing the real prospect of defeat. This afternoon it has announced it will 
not ask Conservative MPs to oppose the motion. Instead, it will ask them to 
back a government amendment, accepting everythingLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> says - ie, accepting the call for 
a “plan” to be published - but adding some new conditions.

 * May is challenging Labour and other opposition MPs to accept three 
conditions; that article 50 should be invoked by the end of March; that the 
result of the referendum should be accepted; and that the publication of the 
plan should not undermine the government’s stance in the Brexit negotiations.
Labour is likely to accept all three conditions. Indeed, the final one is very 
similar to one contained in Labour’s own motion. 
 * It is likely that the Labour motion, as amended by the government, will be 
passed by MPs tomorrow without opposition. A similar thing happened in October, 
when Labour tabled a motion saying there should be a debate on Brexit before 
the triggering of article 50 and the government accepted it rather than risk

Analysis: With Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> 
as shadow Brexit secretary, Labour is adopting a cautious and incremental 
approach to shifting government policy on Brexit. Twice now Labour has made 
modest demands in the Commons - a vote on Brexit, the publication of a plan - 
and twice now the government has to concede its demands, against Theresa May’s 
initial wishes. Starmer seems to be a pragmatist who would rather chalk up a 
minor victory than a glorious defeat, and he has shifted the government.

But the government is not committing itself, in the wording of the motion and 
the amendment, to publishing a proper 100-page white paper or whatever. The 
Labour motion just talks about the government having to publish a “plan”. 
Conceivably this could amount to a handful of tweets; more realistically, if 
the government refuses to publish a white paper, it could just release a 
written ministerial statement with a 300-word summary of what the government 
hopes to achieve. This would be in keeping with the letter of what it is 
agreeing too, if not the spirit.

That seems to be what the government is briefing.

No 10 says amendment is NOT commitment to publish anything specific OR to have 
a vote in parliament before article 50 button is pushed...

But Labour can take some consolation from the fact that, now the government 
has shifted ground twice, it is not inconceivable that it will be forced to 
make further parliamentary concessions on Brexit in the future.
 
Here is the text of the amendment.

The government has tabled an amendment to the Labour motion being debated 
tomorrow. It accepts what theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> motion says about the need for 
the government to publish a plan for leaving the EU before triggering article 
50. But it also says the Commons should accept the outcome of the referendum, 
and it says the government should trigger article 50 by the end of March.
 
The Conservative MP Steve Baker says he has seen the government amendment for 
tomorrow, and approves. Baker was a leading leave campaigner.

I have now seen the Government's amendment for tomorrow and I have seen that 
it is good. I already feel pro-EU forces deflating

Gerard Batten, Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, has welcomed the fact that Michel 
Barnier confirmed that Britain would not be able to control EU immigration if 
it remained in the single market. Batten said:

We in Ukip had made it plain during the referendum that to control our borders 
and immigration we would have to leave the single market. But in doing so, like 
every other non-EU country in the world, we would retain access to the single 
market under WTO rules.

What part of ‘leave the single market’ don’t the remainers understand? It is 
always good to be able to agree with one’s political opponents, and Monsieur 
Barnier has made it plain that there is no point in long protracted 
negotiations with the EU that will achieve nothing. We have to leave as quickly 
as possible!
