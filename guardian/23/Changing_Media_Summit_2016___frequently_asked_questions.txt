At the Changing Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/changing-media-summit> 2016 you will 
hear how brands can balance creativity and technology to forge meaningful 
relationships and reaffirm their purpose in a rapidly evolving world.

Who is the summit for?

The Changing Media Summit is for everyone working in the media sector. 
Attended by a senior, creative audience who are interested in gaining the very 
best insights and strategies, the event attracts those working in publishing, 
advertising, marketing, television, music, film and games.

What will I learn at the changing media summit 2016?

In a post-digital, mobile-centric world, we ask if the consumer has been left 
behind. Join 400 C-level executives from across the media spectrum to hear how 
brands can balance creativity and technology to create meaningful relationships 
and establish their purpose in a rapidly changing world.

Key themes to be addressed at next year’s event:

 * What does a sustainable, modern media company look like?

 * Will the rise of ad blocking lead to the reinvention of advertising?

 * How are news organisations experimenting with social media platforms?

 * What does great creativity in the digital age look like?

 * How can brands marry purpose with profit?

 * How do you build a valuable media agency?

 * And much more...
