After the undemocratic removal of Dilma Rousseff as president of Brazil (Report
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/24/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-president>
, 24 December) via an illegitimate process that saw 62 senators overturn the 
votes of 54 million, there has been an unprecedented defamation campaign 
against former president Lula. This “trial by media” is an attempt to keep Lula 
from participating in the political process. As a highly popular figure as a 
result of reforms that lifted millions from poverty, Lula is considered a 
possible candidate in the 2018 elections. Investigating Lula, prosecutors have 
been unable to find any illegal activity committed. Despite this, they have 
submitted him to a number of arbitrary constraints and detainments, leading to 
a UN investigation taking place due to concern that his rights have been 
infringed. We, the undersigned, oppose this concerted campaign against Lula and 
stand in solidarity with those struggling for democracy and social progress in 
Brazil.
