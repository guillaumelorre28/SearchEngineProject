John Hurt is the favourite to star as randy, vicious, self-styled Nazi Alan 
Clark <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alan-clark>. But who should be in 
the supporting cast?

Send us your suggestions for the leading players. Dame Judi Dench, Faith Brown 
or maybe even Lily Savage to play Maggie Thatcher (remember Alan Clark found 
her "dainty" ankles and wrists a turn on).

What about his put-upon wife Jane - she of the upstairs brigade? 

Or the celebrated "coven" - his code word for the South African judge's wife 
and her two daughters, all of whom Clark seduced.

And speaking of the "coven", who could the BBC possibly get to play Max 
Clifford, who flew over to London to tell the story to who else but the News of 
the World.

Clark, you will remember, came out fighting and said he had been "traduced" by 
the three lovelies he used to trust.

Then there's the South African judge himself, who said Clark deserved to be 
horse-whipped. (Oh happy days, thought Clark, before slipping into an erotic 
dream.)

Other potential players in the BBC's version of Clark's diaries are Michael 
Heseltine, Cecil Parkinson, John Major, Douglas Hurd, Geoffrey Howe, Tom King 
and Willie Whitelaw.
