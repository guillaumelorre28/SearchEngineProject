As NYC FC broke the news on their website – and Lampard posted a message on 
his Instagram account 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BMyxW24AuXp/?taken-by=franklampard> thanking the 
fans – the hashtag #ThankYouFrank was launched throughout the club’s social 
media pages as they paid tribute to his short albeit memorable time with the 
MLS franchise. Head coach Patrick Vieira, sporting director Claudio Reyna and 
members of the squad weighed in on the value of his legacy and what he meant to 
club while the Third Rail, the club’s supporter’s group, also showed their 
appreciation for his services on Twitter.

“Everybody talks about Frank’s goal-scoring record from midfield but I can 
tell you after a year of working with him, he brings so much more to a team 
than just goals,” Vieira told the club’s website. “What Frank has brought to 
the locker room is something just as – his experience, his elite mentality and 
his mentorship for the younger members of our squad have helped us greatly this 
year.”

Today, we say goodbye to a legend. Best of luck on your next chapter, Frank.

In all honesty, Lampard’s departure leaves us perplexed because it’s hard what 
to make of his legacy with the club. Despite his reputable name and the 
incredible resume he brought with him, does Lampard’s “career” with New York 
leave a trail of injuries underthe fifth most expensive contract in the league 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-mls-salaries-idUSKCN0YB02L> or are we 
saying goodbye to an NYC FC legend who helped the club drastically improve in 
its second ever season?

As a founding member and season ticket holder who lives 20 minutes from Yankee 
Stadium, I have witnessed his performances in every home match he has been a 
part of. I was in the stadium in May during the7-0 destruction by the New York 
Red Bulls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/new-york-city-fc-red-bulls-mls-hudson-river-derby>
 where fans cursed and yelled at him as he came on the 75th minute to replace 
Andrea Pirlo. And I was also present when he scored his first career MLS hat 
trick against Colorado also making it the first in NYC FC’s history, an 
achievement not even David Villa has matched.

His total numbers were relatively impressive: Lampard netted 15 goals (12 of 
them scored this season) and three assists in 31 matches. During training, not 
many players worked harder than him and it’s fair to even say that Jack 
Harrison’s emergence this season is partly thanks to his guidance and 
mentorship.An August article by Jack Williams for Guardian US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/jack-harrison-interview-new-york-city-fc-mls>
 recalls how Lampard spent time with the young attacking midfielder away from 
the training ground when he was rehabilitating from a pelvic injury during 
preseason.

Judging by the conversation on social media, most fans are undoubtedly 
thankful for his services and feel lucky to have seen him play for the club. 
But perhaps Lampard’s journey with NYC FC begas a bigger question: Are aging 
designated players with high salaries worth the investment or would the money 
be better invested in cultivating young, home-grown talent?

Financially speaking, Manchester City-owned NYC FC don’t need to worry about 
over-indulging, but when you have have a club that fundamentally bases itself 
on Vieira’s philosophy of quick-possession, high-press soccer, should the 
strategy gear towards attaining younger players who can stay healthy? Bruce 
Arena is indeed asking himself this question as Los Angeles Galaxy prepare for 
life without Steven Gerrard.

The issue with Lampard’s complicated career with NYC FC, however, is that we 
don’t know what’s more important: his productivity or his physical limitations? 
No one doubts his obvious contributions when he is playing, but does it really 
make a difference if he’s there only half the time?

Frank Lampard <https://www.theguardian.com/football/frank-lampard> is a player 
who will retire with an impressive reputation and he will go down in history as 
one of the greatest players of his generation, but as NYC FC look to the 
future, it’s in their best interest to rethink their strategy by building a 
squad who succeeds not just through reputable talent but with youthful 
determination that can fight through an MLS season.

As Woody Allen once said, 80% of success is showing up.
