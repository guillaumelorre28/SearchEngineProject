Constance and Daphne are running a marathon, which we take as being a race of 
exactly 26.2 miles. Constance runs the entire marathon at a constant speed of 8 
minutes a mile. Daphne runs at different speeds, with fast spurts and slower 
sections, such that she covers every mile in 8 min 1 sec. In other words, 
whichever mile you take – the first mile of the course, the last mile or, say, 
the interval between 13.6 miles and 14.6 miles – Constance will run it in 8 
minutes and Daphne will be a second slower.

Is it possible that Daphne will win the race?
