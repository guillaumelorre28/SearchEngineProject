I met my new partner last year and moved in with him about six weeks ago. I 
love and admire him deeply. He is dominant by nature, which at the beginning I 
liked very much, at least sexually. However, since moving in, his controlling 
ways have extended to forbidding me to wear certain clothes if they are too 
short or revealing, insisting I wear tights with dresses and so on. This makes 
me feel uneasy. I don’t want to be made into a dowdy, mousy partner who 
eventually gets replaced with someone more exciting. I have a tendency to 
become very insecure in relationships, and this is not the first time I have 
been dominated in this way. Is the relationship fundamentally flawed or is this 
something we can work on?
