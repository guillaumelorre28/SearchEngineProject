Fox News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news> reached a financial 
settlement several months ago with former host Juliet Huddy, who claimed she 
was sexually harassed by two top figures at the cable news network, the Wall 
Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

 In a letter from her attorney to Fox News, Huddy claimed she had been 
harassed by the O’Reilly Factor host Bill O’Reilly and Fox News co-president 
Jack Abernethy, the Journalreported <http://on.wsj.com/2jcICXx>.

Fox News, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox> Inc, paid a six-figure settlement to 
Huddy, but believes the claims are false, the Journal reported.

 The settlement came when Fox News was dealing with sexual harassment claims 
against former network chiefRoger Ailes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/roger-ailes>, the Journal said.

 Huddy’s attorney, Douglas Wigdor, and Fox News did not immediately respond to 
requests for comment.
