My partner and I have been together for nearly three years. Since being 
together, we have both come off social-networking sites, we live together and 
we happily talk about our future. However, when he goes out with friends, I 
always find myself texting him asking where he is and when he will be home. He 
feels the same when I go out with my friends. Is this normal? Are we too 
controlling of each other? We are in such a good relationship; I just get so 
anxious when he goes out. How can I solve this? I trust him and he trusts me.
