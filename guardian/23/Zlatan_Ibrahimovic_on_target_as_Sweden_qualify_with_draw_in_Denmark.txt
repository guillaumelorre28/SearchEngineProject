Sweden’s captain silenced the home fans in the 19th minute when, from Kim 
Kallstrom’s corner, he twisted athletically to sweep the ball past the 
flat-footed Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.

Then, after Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> had pressed 
strongly without creating many chances, he curled home a free-kick in the 76th 
minute before late goals by Yussuf Poulsen and Jannik Vestergaard provided some 
comfort for the home fans.

Ibrahimovic said afterwards: “We were the best in the playoffs. This is just 
fabulous.”

Denmark’s coach, Morten Olsen, made four changes from the team that started 
Saturday’s 2-1 defeat in Stockholm

. His team looked much more muscular in midfield, but their final ball was 
often poor.

Nicklas Bendtner, the former Arsenal striker, had a disappointing game and was 
widely booed when he was replaced by Morten Rasmussen on the hour.

Denmark had overrun the Swedes in the opening exchanges and should have scored 
in the eighth minute but Poulsen, Daniel Agger and Thomas Delaney all failed to 
find the net in quick succession.

Sweden’s coach, Erik Hamren, said: “I am very thrilled and very happy. The 
boys were fantastic.” The man who was criticised after Sweden’s failure to 
qualify at the group stage added with a smile: “This means I will be coaching 
for another day.”

Olsen, who was in charge of Denmark for the last time, said: “In recent months 
we have been too unstable in our performances and have created too few chances.”
