I met Alan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-obituary> in 1967 
when I was a journalist, setting up an “alternative” local paper in Notting 
Hill, west London. Alan was training to be a graphic artist and came on board 
as the paper’s designer. We shared the same politics and became good friends. I 
admired him for his beliefs and activism, and not just his acting.

The debut issue of the paper attracted some attention, and Alan’s first 
appearance on screen was therefore in a television news item, in which he was 
shown sitting on the floor of my flat gluing together a layout of the paper. 
The glue slurped onto the carpet and stubbornly stayed there for many years 
afterwards. But it at least gave my wife and me something to show guests over 
the next few decades as we pointed out our enduring connection with the great 
actor.

As Alan began to pursue his stage and film career, we drifted apart – and we 
met only a couple of times before 1992, when I took a group of students to see 
his Hamlet at the Riverside Studios in London. Afterwards he behaved as if we 
had never lost contact, and chatted at length to the students, despite there 
being a queue of agents outside the dressing room door with scripts for him to 
read. He was a lovely man: an admirable actor but also a genuine, generous 
person.
