A sharp jump in calls about online sexual abuse to a helpline has sparked an 
appeal for parents to discuss internet safety with children receiving 
smartphones, games consoles and tablet computers this Christmas.

The NSPCC said there were 3,716 Childline counselling sessions about the issue 
in 2015-16 – a 24% increase on the previous year’s 2,994.

Over the past three years, the number of contacts to Childline about online 
sexual abuse has surged by 250%.

The category can include grooming, child sexual exploitation, sexting, being 
made to perform sex acts on webcam, meeting in person and viewing distressing 
sexually explicit content.

Some children contacted Childline because they felt trapped by their 
situation, because they felt guilty and ashamed, were being blackmailed or were 
considering a meeting in person.

The NSPCC said it was vital that parents spoke to their children about being 
safe online. Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the children’s charity, 
said: “In the last year we’ve seen a staggering rise in online sexual abuse, 
with many children turning to Childline when the situation has escalated.”

Advice for parents includes exploring sites and apps alongside their children, 
asking about things children might see that make them feel uncomfortable, and 
promising not to overreact.
