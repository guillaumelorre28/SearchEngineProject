Betfair, the leading betting exchange, has made a voluntary contribution to 
the Levy Board of ¤1,422,112 (£1.25m) in recognition of profits made from 
taking bets on British racing from overseas clients. The sum represents 10% of 
gross profit on such markets.

"We have sent a cheque," said Betfair's spokesman, Mark Davies, "as there is 
no statutory mechanism by which we can pay the levy in respect of our 
international business. We are doing this because we support British racing."

Gerry Sutcliffe, the sports minister, recently put pressure on overseas 
operators to contribute to the levy, but Betfair believe they could not be 
required to make this payment, as their overseas business is based in Malta.
