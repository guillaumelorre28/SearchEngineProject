Barclays <https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> has handed its chief 
executive, Jes Staley, £1.8m in shares just weeks after his announcement that 
the dividend to shareholders is to be cut by more than half.

The payout to the American, who took the helm in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive>
, was disclosed in a stock exchange filing  
<http://www.investegate.co.uk/barclays-plc--barc-/rns/director-pdmr-shareholding/201603151330021629S/>
that showed he and his management team have been handed almost £9m in share 
bonuses.

Stanley’s £1.8m payout includes shares promised to buy him out of bonus 
schemes from a previous employer, the US bank JP Morgan, which he left in 2013 
when he joined a hedge fund.

This month, he attacked the bonus culture in banking. “It is fair to question 
whether bankers lost their moral compass during the 90s and first decade of 
this century, because of the single-minded pursuit of personal wealth,” he 
said, as he announced he was more than halving the dividend in 2016 and 2017.

Barclays’ new deputy chairman, Sir Gerry Grimstone, said last week that 
bonuses should be withheld for a decade

.

The bank has already published its annual report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/barclays-cuts-dividend-as-profits-fall-8-percent>
, which showed it cut its bonus pool by 10% to £1.6bn and paid 323 staff more 
than £1m. The highest paid director, whose identity is not revealed, received 
£9.5m.


The latest information shows that Ashok Vaswani, head of the retail bank, was 
handed shares worth £1.7m, Tushar Morzaria, finance director, shares worth 
£1.1m and Robert le Blanc, head of risk, shares worth £1.3m.

All the nine executives at the top of the bank sold enough shares to cover 
their tax payments but did not sell off any more than required to meet their 
obligations.

Three years ago, Barclays faced fierce criticism when the bonus awards 
coincided with budget day and it gave£17.6m worth of shares to Rich Ricci, then 
head of its investment banking division

His retirementwas announced a month later

Ricci was at Cheltenham festival watching his horses when Tuesday’s disclosure 
was made.

Last week, bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland handed £17.4m in shares to its 
top management team

 – led by CEO Ross McEwan – while Lloyds Banking Group issued £20m in shares to 
its senior executives.

The Barclays disclosure covers not just share awards for future bonuses 
through long-term incentive plans. It also includes details on other payments 
in shares, including annual bonuses for 2015 and role-based pay awards, which 
are handed out to stop their pay from falling as a result of the EU’s cap on 
bonuses.

The bank’s payments are down on previous years although comparisons are 
difficult, as the share price has fallen and some of the higher paid investment 
bankers are no longer part of the management team. A year ago, when the bank 
was run by Antony Jenkins, the share handout for the11-strong executive team 
was valued at more than £16m
