I am a 40-year-old man who has always suffered with incredible shyness and 
insecurity around women. My shyness is better now; I can talk to women, and 
have female friends, but I have never really had a proper relationship. The few 
times I have had sex with women have mainly been (normally drunken) one-night 
stands, which haven’t been a great success as I have got very tense and been 
unable to perform. My loneliness and fear of intimacy is compounded by the 
feeling that women are going to expect me to be a lot more experienced sexually 
and in terms of relationships than I am. I feel embarrassed to admit my 
situation. I have tried online and speed dating and nothing has got beyond the 
first date.
