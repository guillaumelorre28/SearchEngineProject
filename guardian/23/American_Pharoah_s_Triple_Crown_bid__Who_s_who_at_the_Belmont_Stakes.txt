As American Pharoah <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/american-pharoah> has 
made his way to one of horse racing’s biggest stages – Belmont Park with a 
Triple Crown on the line – the human stars of his show have been his owner, 
trainer, and jockey.

And while they have rightly commanded the media spotlight, the three-year-old 
colt also has a supporting cast, along with antagonists who hope to spoil his 
chance at racing superstardom on Saturday.

Should American Pharoah become the 12th winner of the Triple Crown, a lot of 
people will deserve the credit, including some whose names don’t make the 
headlines.

The founder of Zayat Stables, he hails from Egypt, where he built a beer 
empire that made his fortune when he sold it to Heineken in 2002. He began 
racing horses in this country in 2008 and since 2010 has spent nearly $11m on 
thoroughbreds. American Pharoah (the misspelling is a result of a contest to 
name the horse) is his first American classic winner, though he had three 
runner-up finishes prior to this year: twice in the Kentucky Derby, with 
Pioneerof The Nile in 2009 and Nehro in 2011, and once in the Belmont Stakes, 
with Paynter in 2012. A lightning rod for controversy during this Triple Crown 
season because of bankruptcy and alleged gambling debts, his presence on social 
media has won over legions of racing fans and amassedmore than 11,000 Twitter 
followers <https://twitter.com/jazz3162>.

in two episodes of CNBC’s Secret Lives of the Super Rich, one before last 
year’s Breeders’ Cup and one this week. The racing manager for his family’s

Triple Crown races and recently graduated with a degree in economics from New

facing the cameras together in their innumerable interviews and photo ops.

American Pharoah’s California-based trainer. No stranger to the Triple Crown 
stage, he’s been here three times before: with Silver Charm in 1997, with Real 
Quiet in 1998, and with War Emblem in 2002. Silver Charm and Real Quiet 
finished second, with Victory Gallop denying him the 1998 Triple Crown by an 
agonizing nose. Easy to spot with his omnipresent sunglasses and helmet of pure 
white hair, Baffert suffered a heart attack in Dubai in 2012, there to run Game 
On Dude in the $10m Dubai World Cup. He’s won the Kentucky Derby four times and 
the Preakness six times, but he’s never hoisted theBelmont Stakes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/belmont-stakes> trophy. A Hall of Famer 
who’s earned three Eclipse Awards for Outstanding Trainer, he can attract as 
much controversy as his owner, with whom he’s had an on-again, off-again 
relationship. His son Bode is named after skier Bode Miller, a family friend.

Baffert’s assistant in name only, he’s been largely responsible for the daily 
care of American Pharoah this year, travelling with the horse while Baffert 
stays at his Southern California base. “I can’t remember the last day I was 
away from him,” said Barnes of the horse, standing Friday outside the Belmont 
barn in which American Pharoah has been stabled this week. A native of Santa 
Rosa, California, Barnes, who began working at the track in the late 60s, has 
been with Baffert since 1999.

Another of American Pharoah’s travelling team, Alvarez has been on the horse’s 
back more than anyone else has. American Pharoah’s regular exercise rider, 
Alvarez works the horse out most mornings, from light jogging to stronger 
gallops. A member of the Baffert barn for seven years, Alvarez has galloped 
plenty of Baffert stable stars, including American Pharoah’s sire, Pioneerof 
The Nile. “He’s kind of like his daddy,” Alvarez said this week. “A little 
stronger. When he was younger, he used to always try to go too fast in the 
morning, so I tried to make sure to slow him down. He’s always covered a lot of 
ground and he got my attention right away.” Originally from Tijuana, Mexico, 
Alvarez grew up riding horses, and before working for Baffert, he worked for 
Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel, who passed away in 2009.

As American Pharoah’s groom, he perhaps knows American Pharoah better than 
anybody. Assigned to the horse nearly a year ago, he’s travelled to Arkansas, 
Kentucky, Maryland, and New York with him. Another long-time Baffert employee, 
Luna has worked in the barn for eight years. “And two months!” he added with a 
laugh. Responsible for feeding and bathing the horse, Luna is also the one who 
tends to his daily maintenance ministrations, such as putting protective 
bandages on his legs and keeping his stall clean. As close to American Pharoah 
as anyone, Luna will be among the most exultant if the horse wins the Triple 
Crown, without the camera time that the higher-profile team members will get.

Like Bob Baffert, Victor Espinoza has been in this position before … once with 
Baffert. He’s been American Pharoah’s jockey for six of the colt’s seven races 
– six straight wins, dating back to last September. Last year, Espinoza came to 
Belmont to try to win the Triple Crown with California Chrome; he did the same 
in 2002 with Baffert’s War Emblem. A native of Mexico City, where he at one 
point drove a bus, he began riding in the United States since 1993 and, like 
Baffert and Zayat, has finished second in the Belmont Stakes (A P Valentine, 
2001) but never won the race.

Pioneerof The Nile

The sire of American Pharoah, he won five races from 10 starts, including the 
Grade 1 CashCall Futurity and Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby. Like his son, he was 
owned by Zayat Stables and trained by Bob Baffert; unlike his son, he finished 
second in the Kentucky Derby, and following an 11th-place finish in the 2009 
Preakness, he was retired. He stands at stud at WinStar Farm in Versailles, 
Kentucky for $60,000 per mating, a figure likely to go higher next year, given 
American Pharoah’s accomplishments.

The spoiler? He’s the trainer of longshot Frammento, a horse not thought to 
have a serious shot of winning the Belmont. But that’s what was thought in 2008 
about Da’ Tara and in 2004 about Birdstone, and both times those Zito horses 
stopped short the Triple Crown dreams of Big Brown and Smarty Jones, 
respectively. A lifelong New Yorker who grew up in Brooklyn, Zito embraces both 
racing history and underdog status, and he’s won all three legs of the Triple 
Crown … but never with the same horse.
