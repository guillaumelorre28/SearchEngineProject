Hammond's evidence to the Commons Treasury committee - Summary

 * Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has told MPs that it will be necessary to 
have a post-Brexit “transitional deal” because it will not be possible to 
complete divorce negotiations within the timetable set out by article 50.

 * Hammond has said that two sorts of transitional deal could be possible. One 
would cover the period between Brexit and a “clear and firm end state”, setting 
out the period of adjustment to reach that goal. And another could be put in 
place if the UK and the EU got to the end of the two-year article 50 withdrawal 
process without agreeing on a final “end state”, to allow time for further 
negotiations. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has signalled that he might 
approve the first kind of transitional deal, but not the second.

Michel Barnier, the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, has also indicated 
that he would be more in favour of a transitional deal if it was a bridge to a 
destination already agreed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/06/uk-wants-as-much-flexibility-as-possible-in-brexit-negotiating-position-says-hammond-politics-live?page=with:block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739#block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739>
But Hammond hinted that he might favour a transitional deal even if it were 
just a means of delaying to Brexit talks. He said: 
In principle certainty is always preferable to uncertainty. But if it’s a 
certainty of something very unfavourable then that’s not quite so good.

 * Hammond has said that “thoughtful politicians” agree with him about the 
need for a transition period.Some have interpreted this as a jibe against his 
Brexiteer colleagues like Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, or David 
Davis, but it is more likely that he was having a dig at hardline pro-Brexit 
Tory backbenchers and figures like Ukip’s Nigel Farage. (See7.17pm.)

 * Hammond has said that leaving the EU could require the UK to spend hundreds 
of millions of pounds erecting and operating new border controls. And there 
could be a five-fold increase in the paperwork required at the border, he said. 
There could be quite significant physical infrastructure changes that need to 
be made at ports of entry and exit not only in the UK, but in continental 
Europe as well. There might be a need to train large numbers of people in 
anticipation of more intensive procedures at borders ...

It is true that in certain conceivable outcomes there would be a very 
substantial increase in the numbers of customs submissions and customs 
inspections. We are talking about - in EU trade - perhaps five times as many 
submissions and inspections being required. It could certainly add hundreds of 
millions of pounds to the cost of operating the customs services.

 * He said he would like the UK to continue to participate in a number of 
cross-European programmes following Brexit. 
Programmes like science, technology, research and development, academic 
exchange programmes are hugely beneficial to this country and countries across 
Europe. We would very much hope we will be able to agree a format which allows 
us to continue to participate in those programmes.

 * He said the government had not yet decided whether to “aspire to remain in 
some form of customs union arrangement” after Brexit 
 * He said the government did not want to cut off the supply of high-skilled 
foreign workers after Brexit. 
Just because you have a system of controlling immigration does not mean you 
have to use it to slam all doors shut. I can’t conceive of any circumstance in 
which we would want to impede or prevent the flow of highly-skilled, 
highly-paid people ... I don’t think it is highly-paid, highly-skilled people 
that cause concern among our own population about migration numbers.

 * He said Brexit could encourage farmers to introduce more automation. He 
said that in the horticultural and agricultural sectors there were “steps of 
automation that can be taken” by investment in machines “that are not taken 
when access to low-cost labour is available”. 
 * He accepted that the most of the extra money going to councils for social 
care will be be available until nearer 2020, but he suggested they should use 
their reserves to fund care in the meantime. He also said money was not the 
only issue, echoing the line used by Number 10 earlier. (See12.56pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85#block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85>
We recognise that the substantial increase in funding that social care will 
receive over this parliament is back-end loaded and we recognised that local 
authorities are challenged to deal with that pattern, that profile.

It is the case that local authorities in aggregate have been adding 
significantly to reserves. I think £9bn since the beginning of the last 
parliament. And local authorities will have to look at how they manage the 
situation to get from here to the very substantial increase in funding that 
will be available to them later in the parliament.

But it’s also clear, and it’s clear from looking at the UK at areas where 
social care is working well and areas where it is facing much bigger 
challenges, that money alone is not the issue. It is about effective 
cooperation and collaboration between the NHS and social services. And the key 
to this is getting the very best practice that we have seen in some areas 
rolled out much more widely across England to deliver the high-quality social 
services we want to see.

Absolutely, we think that coordination between the NHS and local authority 
social services is absolutely crucial and we think that in areas of the country 
where best practice is in evidence it is having a real and visible impact.

 * He rejected a newspaper claim that Theresa May stopped him announcing more 
money for social care in the autumn statement.(See 9.08am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584e619fe4b06a0d55b1a129#block-584e619fe4b06a0d55b1a129>
 That was “not true”, he said. 
 * He said he wanted to allow departments to manage their own problems, and 
not to always insist on the Treasury taking charge. 
 * He defended distributional impact assessments published by the Treasury at 
the time of the autumn statement showing that the poorest 30% are losing more 
from government tax and benefit changes than others apart from the richest 10%. 
He said that was a direct consequence of the government implementing the 
manifesto commitment it made to cut welfare spending. (In other words, it was 
almost as if he were blaming the voters.)  Distributional impact chart.

Correction: Earlier I said that Philip Hammond said a transitional deal might 
last longer than two years. (See 4.34pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba#block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba>
 Andrew Tyrie put it to him that two years was unlikely to be sufficient. I 
interpreted that as Tyrie meaning that a two-year transitional period would be 
insufficient, but, listening again to the exchange, it is clear that Tyrie was 
talking about the two-year article 50 period being insufficient.

Hammond said that “a longer period” would be necessary. But he was talking 
about a longer period than the article 50 two years, not a longer period than 
two years on top of that.

Tyrie did ask how long a transitional period might last. But Hammond did not 
answer. He said there would have to be compromises between “the political will 
to get things done and to move on and the bureaucratic and/or business desire 
to have the longest period possible to make any change”.

Hammond says it is beyond doubt that some local authorities are facing 
challenges dealing with social care.

But he does not expect the Treasury to take charge of this, or issues like 
this. It will be for the relevant departments to take charge.

 * Hammond says Treasury will let departments manage their own problems, and 
not always take charge itself. Facebook

Hammond says 'money alone' not the solution to the social care crisis

Back in the committee Streeting asks why Hammond did not mention health and 
social care in the autumn statement.

Hammond says the government has agreed to give the NHS the money it needs for 
its five-year plan.

He says we will have to get used to a world where chancellors do not do 
everything. The health secretary and the communities secretary are responsible 
for social care, he says.

He says the extra money going to social care is “back-end loaded” (ie, they 
don’t most of it until near the end of the parliament).

But it is also clear that “money alone is not the issue”, he says. It is about 
“effective cooperation and collaboration between the NHS and social services”.

It is important to get best practice rolled out, he says.

 * Hammond says most of extra money for social care not being released until 
nearer the end of the parliament. 
 * He says “money alone” is not the solution to the social care crisis. Better 
cooperation is required too, he says. Facebook

Open Britain, which is campaigning for the UK to stay in the single market, 
has welcomed Philip Hammond’s comments about a transitional deal. It has 
released this statement from theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Stephen Kinnock.

It’s encouraging to see that Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> understands the need for 
a transitional deal to stop Britain falling into a hard, destructive Brexit 
that would take our economy over a cliff edge.

There is a growing consensus that agreeing a new trading relationship between 
Britain and Europe may take much longer than the two years specified by Article 
50. Not signing a transitional arrangement would mean punishing tariffs which 
would hit British businesses and raise prices in the shops.

, thanks Philip Hammond for publishing the distributional impact information 
that George Osborne refused to release.

Hammond says he has been able to publish this information by decile because 
new information is now available that was not available earlier to Osborne.

Q: Michel Barnier and his European commission colleagues seem to be more 
interested in defending the integrity of the EU, whereas EU governments seem 
more interested in jobs. Do you agree?

Hammond says the commission is in charge of the negotiation. But member states 
will expect to have considerable influence over it, and the European parliament 
too. He says he expects all parts of the EU structure to have a role.

Q: What might a transitional deal look like?

Hammond says during the two-year talks a clear end agreement could be agreed. 
But it could be decided to get there in stages.

Or it could be the case that after two years no agreement on a final end state 
has been reached. In that case a transitional deal could be put in place to 
allow both sides more time to get a final deal.

Chris Philp, a Conservative, is asking the questions now.

Q: The EU on average only spends 0.45% of GDP on international aid. France and 
Germany only spend 0.3%. The US only spends 0.2%. The OECD average is 0.28%. 
Could the government cut its aid spending.

Hammond says the 0.7% aid target is set out in statute. The government was 
elected on a mandate to keep that, and intends to do so, he says.

Hammond says the decision to say the budget will be balanced, but in the next 
parliament, is a compromise. But it is the right one, he says.

Q: You want to get net debt below 90% of GDP by 2020-21.

Hammond says the rule is to get it falling by the end of the parliament. It is 
due to peak at just over 90%.

He says the UK is exposed with debt as a percentage of GDP as high as it is.

 * Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has told MPs that it will be necessary to 
have a post-Brexit “transitional deal” because it will not be possible to 
complete divorce negotiations within the timetable set out by article 50. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-calls-for-post-brexit-transitional-deal>
(See 5.07pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ed73ee4b077e9848502e2#block-584ed73ee4b077e9848502e2>
 * Hammond has said that two sorts of transitional deal could be possible. One 
would cover the period between Brexit and a “clear and firm end state”, setting 
out the period of adjustment to reach that goal. And another could be put in 
place if the UK and the EU got to the end of the two-year article 50 withdrawal 
process without agreeing on a final “end state”, to allow time for further 
negotiations. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has signalled that he might 
approve the first kind of transitional deal, but not the second.

Michel Barnier, the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, has also indicated 
that he would be more in favour of a transitional deal if it was a bridge to a 
destination already agreed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/06/uk-wants-as-much-flexibility-as-possible-in-brexit-negotiating-position-says-hammond-politics-live?page=with:block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739#block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739>
But Hammond hinted that he might favour a transitional deal even if it were 
just a means of delaying to Brexit talks. He said: 
In principle certainty is always preferable to uncertainty. But if it’s a 
certainty of something very unfavourable then that’s not quite so good.

 * Hammond has said that “thoughtful politicians” agree with him about the 
need for a transition period.Some have interpreted this as a jibe against his 
Brexiteer colleagues like Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, or David 
Davis, but it is more likely that he was having a dig at hardline pro-Brexit 
Tory backbenchers and figures like Ukip’s Nigel Farage. (See7.17pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ef73ae4b0e02f2b16b6fb#block-584ef73ae4b0e02f2b16b6fb>
 * Hammond has said that leaving the EU could require the UK to spend hundreds 
of millions of pounds erecting and operating new border controls. And there 
could be a five-fold increase in the paperwork required at the border, he said. 
There could be quite significant physical infrastructure changes that need to 
be made at ports of entry and exit not only in the UK, but in continental 
Europe as well. There might be a need to train large numbers of people in 
anticipation of more intensive procedures at borders ...

It is true that in certain conceivable outcomes there would be a very 
substantial increase in the numbers of customs submissions and customs 
inspections. We are talking about - in EU trade - perhaps five times as many 
submissions and inspections being required. It could certainly add hundreds of 
millions of pounds to the cost of operating the customs services.

 * He said he would like the UK to continue to participate in a number of 
cross-European programmes following Brexit. 
Programmes like science, technology, research and development, academic 
exchange programmes are hugely beneficial to this country and countries across 
Europe. We would very much hope we will be able to agree a format which allows 
us to continue to participate in those programmes.

 * He said the government had not yet decided whether to “aspire to remain in 
some form of customs union arrangement” after Brexit 
 * He said the government did not want to cut off the supply of high-skilled 
foreign workers after Brexit. 
Just because you have a system of controlling immigration does not mean you 
have to use it to slam all doors shut. I can’t conceive of any circumstance in 
which we would want to impede or prevent the flow of highly-skilled, 
highly-paid people ... I don’t think it is highly-paid, highly-skilled people 
that cause concern among our own population about migration numbers.

 * He said Brexit could encourage farmers to introduce more automation. He 
said that in the horticultural and agricultural sectors there were “steps of 
automation that can be taken” by investment in machines “that are not taken 
when access to low-cost labour is available”. 
 * He accepted that the most of the extra money going to councils for social 
care will be be available until nearer 2020, but he suggested they should use 
their reserves to fund care in the meantime. He also said money was not the 
only issue, echoing the line used by Number 10 earlier. (See12.56pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85#block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85>
We recognise that the substantial increase in funding that social care will 
receive over this parliament is back-end loaded and we recognised that local 
authorities are challenged to deal with that pattern, that profile.

It is the case that local authorities in aggregate have been adding 
significantly to reserves. I think £9bn since the beginning of the last 
parliament. And local authorities will have to look at how they manage the 
situation to get from here to the very substantial increase in funding that 
will be available to them later in the parliament.

But it’s also clear, and it’s clear from looking at the UK at areas where 
social care is working well and areas where it is facing much bigger 
challenges, that money alone is not the issue. It is about effective 
cooperation and collaboration between the NHS and social services. And the key 
to this is getting the very best practice that we have seen in some areas 
rolled out much more widely across England to deliver the high-quality social 
services we want to see.

Absolutely, we think that coordination between the NHS and local authority 
social services is absolutely crucial and we think that in areas of the country 
where best practice is in evidence it is having a real and visible impact.

 * He rejected a newspaper claim that Theresa May stopped him announcing more 
money for social care in the autumn statement.(See 9.08am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584e619fe4b06a0d55b1a129#block-584e619fe4b06a0d55b1a129>
 That was “not true”, he said. 
 * He said he wanted to allow departments to manage their own problems, and 
not to always insist on the Treasury taking charge. 
 * He defended distributional impact assessments published by the Treasury at 
the time of the autumn statement showing that the poorest 30% are losing more 
from government tax and benefit changes than others apart from the richest 10%. 
He said that was a direct consequence of the government implementing the 
manifesto commitment it made to cut welfare spending. (In other words, it was 
almost as if he were blaming the voters.)  Distributional impact chart.

Correction: Earlier I said that Philip Hammond said a transitional deal might 
last longer than two years. (See 4.34pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba#block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba>
 Andrew Tyrie put it to him that two years was unlikely to be sufficient. I 
interpreted that as Tyrie meaning that a two-year transitional period would be 
insufficient, but, listening again to the exchange, it is clear that Tyrie was 
talking about the two-year article 50 period being insufficient.

Hammond said that “a longer period” would be necessary. But he was talking 
about a longer period than the article 50 two years, not a longer period than 
two years on top of that.

Tyrie did ask how long a transitional period might last. But Hammond did not 
answer. He said there would have to be compromises between “the political will 
to get things done and to move on and the bureaucratic and/or business desire 
to have the longest period possible to make any change”.
 
Andrew Tyrie wraps up the session. He says it has been an interesting one.

I will post a summary shortly.
 
Hammond says it is beyond doubt that some local authorities are facing 
challenges dealing with social care.

But he does not expect the Treasury to take charge of this, or issues like 
this. It will be for the relevant departments to take charge.

 * Hammond says Treasury will let departments manage their own problems, and 
not always take charge itself.  
Back in the committee Streeting asks why Hammond did not mention health and 
social care in the autumn statement.

Hammond says the government has agreed to give the NHS the money it needs for 
its five-year plan.

He says we will have to get used to a world where chancellors do not do 
everything. The health secretary and the communities secretary are responsible 
for social care, he says.

He says the extra money going to social care is “back-end loaded” (ie, they 
don’t most of it until near the end of the parliament).

But it is also clear that “money alone is not the issue”, he says. It is about 
“effective cooperation and collaboration between the NHS and social services”.

It is important to get best practice rolled out, he says.

 * Hammond says most of extra money for social care not being released until 
nearer the end of the parliament. 
 * He says “money alone” is not the solution to the social care crisis. Better 
cooperation is required too, he says.  
Open Britain, which is campaigning for the UK to stay in the single market, 
has welcomed Philip Hammond’s comments about a transitional deal. It has 
released this statement from theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Stephen Kinnock.

It’s encouraging to see that Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> understands the need for 
a transitional deal to stop Britain falling into a hard, destructive Brexit 
that would take our economy over a cliff edge.

There is a growing consensus that agreeing a new trading relationship between 
Britain and Europe may take much longer than the two years specified by Article 
50. Not signing a transitional arrangement would mean punishing tariffs which 
would hit British businesses and raise prices in the shops.
 
Labour’s Wes Streeting, echoing the point made by Andrew Tyrie earlier (see

, thanks Philip Hammond for publishing the distributional impact information 
that George Osborne refused to release.

Hammond says he has been able to publish this information by decile because 
new information is now available that was not available earlier to Osborne.

Q: Michel Barnier and his European commission colleagues seem to be more 
interested in defending the integrity of the EU, whereas EU governments seem 
more interested in jobs. Do you agree?

Hammond says the commission is in charge of the negotiation. But member states 
will expect to have considerable influence over it, and the European parliament 
too. He says he expects all parts of the EU structure to have a role.
 
Q: What might a transitional deal look like?

Hammond says during the two-year talks a clear end agreement could be agreed. 
But it could be decided to get there in stages.

Or it could be the case that after two years no agreement on a final end state 
has been reached. In that case a transitional deal could be put in place to 
allow both sides more time to get a final deal.
 
Chris Philp, a Conservative, is asking the questions now.

Q: The EU on average only spends 0.45% of GDP on international aid. France and 
Germany only spend 0.3%. The US only spends 0.2%. The OECD average is 0.28%. 
Could the government cut its aid spending.

Hammond says the 0.7% aid target is set out in statute. The government was 
elected on a mandate to keep that, and intends to do so, he says.

Hammond says the decision to say the budget will be balanced, but in the next 
parliament, is a compromise. But it is the right one, he says.
 
Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Philip Hammond’s transitional deal 
comments. (See 5.07pm.)

Q: You want to get net debt below 90% of GDP by 2020-21.

Hammond says the rule is to get it falling by the end of the parliament. It is 
due to peak at just over 90%.

He says the UK is exposed with debt as a percentage of GDP as high as it is.
 
The SNP’s George Kerevan is asking questions now. He is asking about the 
decision to increase the insurance premium tax. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-insurance-premium-tax-increased-again>

Q: The OBR said there was a danger of this leading to people trying to avoid 
it through tax planning.

Hammond says he cannot comment on how they might do this.
