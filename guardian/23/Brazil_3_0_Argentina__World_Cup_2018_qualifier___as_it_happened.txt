Brazil 3-0 Argentina

Well, that’s it. Coach Tite and Brazil make it five straight wins and Argentina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> continue dwelling in their 
own downfall. There was nothing about this match that should suggest they can 
do anything against Colombia next week, even if they are at home.

The entire Brazilian squad - energized and inspired by Carlos Alberto as he 
looked down from heaven - delivered a performance that would make the legends 
of the 70’s extremely proud.

Before this match, the last time Brazil played in Belo Horizonte, Germany had 
embarrassed them 7-1 at theWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> in 2014. Now, they 
have a new memory.

Edgardo Bauza, meanwhile, has a lot to think about. Was Higuaín really the 
best choice to start? Where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire 
we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch Albiceleste?

Answers better come fast because a hungry Colombia is coming to town. 

Thanks for tuning in and I’ll see you next time.

89 min: A great ball wide to Neymar, who finds Costa, but Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> just about clear it from the 
box. Messi, who hasn’t touched the ball in a while, can only admire at his 
Barca teammate and the way he leads the Selecao. Neymar really is a sight to 
behold when he leads his nation. Messi finally gets the ball and dribbles 
towards the box but deflects wide.

84 min: Firmino hits the post after a great cross....Coutinho comes out for 
Douglas Costa - a great performance from the Liverpool man. Firmino again 
enters the box but Otamendi just about clears it. This is truly shambolic by
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and ironically 
enough, they could really benefit from another Argentinian manager who instills 
a lot of grit and energy...Ricardo Gareca. But he’s busy managing Peru.

79 min: Wow, Neymar close to making 4-0 as he breaks through the center and 
into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out.Brazil

75 min: There are shades of the old Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> here, with lovely one-touch 
football. I actually can’t remember the last time Messi touched the ball or 
even made a significant contribution. Albiceleste look to penetrate Brazil’s 
box but a stout defense takes it right back.

69 min: Aguero gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes. 
There are 20 minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> will get a goal, let 
alone come back. Brazil look composed and really loving their football. Di 
Maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed.

In other news, Peru is currently beating Paraguay 4-1 in Asunción. First away

53 min: Neymar fouls Funes Mori and once again, Tite has to warn his players 
to calm down. Brazil have taken on the high-press approach, knowing that
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> is rattled. Messi 
finds Aguero but it’s offside. This is Bauza’s biggest issue...not being able 
to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box.

49 min: Brazil start the second the same way they ended the first, with 
relentless counterattacking. Aguero, who replaced Perez, draws a yellow card as 
Marcelo can’t stop him on the right hand side. Another Messi-taken free-kick, 
this time a good ball in, but can’t be met by anyone.

Half-time

Well, it’s clearly cruise control for Brazil right now as Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are getting rocked by the 
counter. It’s all going badly for Bauza’s team. I’m sure Aguero will come in 
the second half straight away.

Thanks, John. Ha ha! You know what? At times you would think that is the case 
but it’s due to the fact that Alves and Marcelo push so high up when in 
possession.

I agree with you - a special goal.

Question.

Is my TV playing tricks on me or are Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> playing a 2-4-1-3?

37 min: Another free-kick for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> as Messi gets fouled outside 
the box. This is an almost perfect angle for la Pulga but he drives it against 
the wall. If it carries on like this, it won’t be long until we see Aguero. On 
the counter, Neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side, 
but instead of delivering a low cross, he shoots it himself and hits the post.

33 min: As Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> decide 
to press, Brazil stick to the same plan by sitting until opposition enter their 
half. Perez drives towards the box and shoots from just outside but it goes 
wide. Higuaín struggling to stay onside - a problem when you play lone striker.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>, who up to that point, were 
clearly the better team in terms of possession. Bauza has now instructed his 
team to press higher up the field as plan A has disintegrated.

Goal! Brazil 1-0 Argentina (Coutinho 25)

25 min: What a goal by Coutinho! The Liverpool man cuts in from the left hand 
side and drives towards the box and curls it past the keeper. This boy is on

24 min: The first real chance by Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> falls to Biglia with a great 
shot from outside of the box and it took a great save from Alisson to stop it! 
Messi worked so well on the right hand side to find the Lazio man and he took a 
powerful shot that was well met by the keeper. The best chance of the match.

20 min: The crowd chant every time Neymar touches the ball but aside from that 
nothing much in terms of real chances. An extremely nervy first 20 minutes from 
both sides.

Thank you for the email, Julian. Of course, no problem.

Hey... I live in a country (China) where Twitter is banned. Any chance line 
ups can be written instead of linked to? Many thanks, Julian

16 min: Coutinho is playing extremely wide right now, with Gabriel Jesus 
playing as the lone striker. This is where the Liverpool man can usually show 
signs of fading forBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> as he 
is best suited to play directly behind the striker in an almost-free role. 
Still nothing in terms of a real chance.

12 min: Neymar beginning to show some trickery but can’t pass Mascherano who 
basically falls to the ground to try and stop the Brazilian’s dribbling. 
Albiceleste dominating in possession now, looking to stay in the final third 
and actually looking to press slightly higher, hoping to pushBrazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> back to their own box. Di Maria 
hasn’t even touched the ball, until now...all the action has been on the right 
hand side.

8 min: Tite has instructed his team to not press until the opposition enter 
their half, then counter. Fernandinho gets a yellow as he elbows Messi, who had 
embarrassed him with a nice ball above his head. Things calm down after that and
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> push more - better 
from Bauza’s men. Brazil need to be careful with being over physical.

4 min: Brazil begin the first few minutes with quick possession and Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> hold, taking on their 
defensive shape, waiting to counter. It’s clear Higuaín will spearhead the 
frontline with Messi playing right behind him, free to move from left to right. 
Messi gets fouled about 35 yards outside of the box and takes a free-kick which 
goes nowhere.

The squads walk out to the stadium and the atmosphere is electric as the FIFA 
anthem plays in the background. Dani Alves, by the way, wearing the No 4 shirt, 
in honor of the legendary Carlos Alberto, who passed away last month.

Now the anthems are playing and first it’s Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> followed by Brazil, which is 
obviously met with thunderous chants.

I don’t think I have ever seen Neymar or Messi so focused. 

There’s a moment of silence for Carlos Alberto. 

Next time you hear from me will be kick-off.

The stage is set and players are inside the tunnel ready to come out. It’s a 
beautiful albeit humid night in Belo Horizonte. Don’t forget you can email me 
or send me a tweet @lmechegaray.

Preamble

Hello everyone and welcome to the Superclásico of South America as Brazil host 
Argentina in a crucialWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifier. For theses 
Conmebol nations, the road to Russia 2018 has been nothing short of thrilling 
as only six points separate the top seven teams in the table.

Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil>, thanks to Tite, are 
loving life right now as the 55-year-old manager has introduced a calmer, 
happier Selecao, free to express individual talent as well as cohesive 
teamwork. The result? Four consecutive victories and top of the table.

Argentina on the other hand are heading in the wrong direction and things need 
to change quickly. Edgardo Bauza has not started well and things went from bad 
to worse when Conmebol allotted three points to Chile and Peru as a result of 
Bolivia’s use of an ineligible player when they played against them. 
Consequently, Chile leap-froggedArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and currently hold the final 
qualifying spot.

The pressure is on Argentina to get something out of this match as they really 
can’t afford to drop any more points. Brazil, meanwhile, hope this ride keeps 
on going.

Here is Argentina’s line-up:

Well, that’s it. Coach Tite and Brazil make it five straight wins and Argentina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> continue dwelling in their 
own downfall. There was nothing about this match that should suggest they can 
do anything against Colombia next week, even if they are at home.

The entire Brazilian squad - energized and inspired by Carlos Alberto as he 
looked down from heaven - delivered a performance that would make the legends 
of the 70’s extremely proud.

Before this match, the last time Brazil played in Belo Horizonte, Germany had 
embarrassed them 7-1 at theWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> in 2014. Now, they 
have a new memory.

Edgardo Bauza, meanwhile, has a lot to think about. Was Higuaín really the 
best choice to start? Where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire 
we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch Albiceleste?

Answers better come fast because a hungry Colombia is coming to town. 

Thanks for tuning in and I’ll see you next time. 

 
90 min+2: That’s it. Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> win 
convincingly. A masterful victory.
 
89 min: A great ball wide to Neymar, who finds Costa, but Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> just about clear it from the 
box. Messi, who hasn’t touched the ball in a while, can only admire at his 
Barca teammate and the way he leads the Selecao. Neymar really is a sight to 
behold when he leads his nation. Messi finally gets the ball and dribbles 
towards the box but deflects wide.
 
84 min: Firmino hits the post after a great cross....Coutinho comes out for 
Douglas Costa - a great performance from the Liverpool man. Firmino again 
enters the box but Otamendi just about clears it. This is truly shambolic by
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and ironically 
enough, they could really benefit from another Argentinian manager who instills 
a lot of grit and energy...Ricardo Gareca. But he’s busy managing Peru.
 
81 min: Firmino replaces Gabriel Jesus. Manchester City fans are going to be 
spoiled with the things he does, a great No 9....and he’s only 19.
 
79 min: Wow, Neymar close to making 4-0 as he breaks through the center and 
into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out.Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> chanting Ole now, and it’s going 
to be a long flight back to Buenos Aires.
 
75 min: There are shades of the old Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> here, with lovely one-touch 
football. I actually can’t remember the last time Messi touched the ball or 
even made a significant contribution. Albiceleste look to penetrate Brazil’s 
box but a stout defense takes it right back.
 
69 min: Aguero gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes. 
There are 20 minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> will get a goal, let 
alone come back. Brazil look composed and really loving their football. Di 
Maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed.
 
65 min: Neymar and Brazil are just having too much fun right now and Higuaín 
doesn’t like it as he fouls the Barca man.Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are losing the match and their 
heads on the process. Brazil in complete domination.

In other news, Peru is currently beating Paraguay 4-1 in Asunción. First away 
win since 2004. I might explode after I’m done here....just warning you.
 
59 min: Well, this time around, Paulinho doesn’t miss and makes it game over 
as he capitalizes on a cross from the right hand side. This is huge.Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are losing 3-0, currently out 
of the top 5...next match is gigantic.
 
57 min: Wow, this game should be over. Gabriel Jesus once again finds Paulinho 
who rounds the keeper...all he needs to do is score and its over but Zabaleta 
saves it on the line! Neymar gets fouled by Funes Mori. Freekick toBrazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil>, a great attempt by Dani Alves 
but its saved by Romero.
 
53 min: Neymar fouls Funes Mori and once again, Tite has to warn his players 
to calm down. Brazil have taken on the high-press approach, knowing that
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> is rattled. Messi 
finds Aguero but it’s offside. This is Bauza’s biggest issue...not being able 
to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box.
 
49 min: Brazil start the second the same way they ended the first, with 
relentless counterattacking. Aguero, who replaced Perez, draws a yellow card as 
Marcelo can’t stop him on the right hand side. Another Messi-taken free-kick, 
this time a good ball in, but can’t be met by anyone.
 
45 min: Peep! And we’re back! 
 
Well, it’s clearly cruise control for Brazil right now as Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are getting rocked by the 
counter. It’s all going badly for Bauza’s team. I’m sure Aguero will come in 
the second half straight away.
 
45 min: What a great pass by Gabriel Jesus, who cuts through the Argentinian 
defense and feeds Neymar who calmly puts it in corner. Wow.
 
42 min: What a great cross by Más from the left hand side, and it just can’t 
be met by Higuaín who was too slow to react.Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are finishing this half 
strongly with all the action in Brazil’s half...they just can’t find the back 
of the net.
 
Thanks, John. Ha ha! You know what? At times you would think that is the case 
but it’s due to the fact that Alves and Marcelo push so high up when in 
possession.

I agree with you - a special goal.

Question.

Is my TV playing tricks on me or are Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> playing a 2-4-1-3?

37 min: Another free-kick for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> as Messi gets fouled outside 
the box. This is an almost perfect angle for la Pulga but he drives it against 
the wall. If it carries on like this, it won’t be long until we see Aguero. On 
the counter, Neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side, 
but instead of delivering a low cross, he shoots it himself and hits the post. 
 
33 min: As Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> decide 
to press, Brazil stick to the same plan by sitting until opposition enter their 
half. Perez drives towards the box and shoots from just outside but it goes 
wide. Higuaín struggling to stay onside - a problem when you play lone striker.
 
29 min: That goal certainly shook Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>, who up to that point, were 
clearly the better team in terms of possession. Bauza has now instructed his 
team to press higher up the field as plan A has disintegrated.
 
25 min: What a goal by Coutinho! The Liverpool man cuts in from the left hand 
side and drives towards the box and curls it past the keeper. This boy is on 
fire!
 
24 min: The first real chance by Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> falls to Biglia with a great 
shot from outside of the box and it took a great save from Alisson to stop it! 
Messi worked so well on the right hand side to find the Lazio man and he took a 
powerful shot that was well met by the keeper. The best chance of the match.
 
20 min: The crowd chant every time Neymar touches the ball but aside from that 
nothing much in terms of real chances. An extremely nervy first 20 minutes from 
both sides.
 
Thank you for the email, Julian. Of course, no problem.

Hey... I live in a country (China) where Twitter is banned. Any chance line 
ups can be written instead of linked to? Many thanks, Julian

Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> - Alisson, Alves, 
Miranda, Marqui, Marcelo, Paulinho, Fernandinho, Renato; Coutinho, Jesus, 
Neymar.

Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> - Romero; Zabaleta, 
Otamendi, Mori, Más, Pérez, Biglia, Mascherano, Di María; Messi, Higuaín.
 
16 min: Coutinho is playing extremely wide right now, with Gabriel Jesus 
playing as the lone striker. This is where the Liverpool man can usually show 
signs of fading forBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> as he 
is best suited to play directly behind the striker in an almost-free role. 
Still nothing in terms of a real chance.
 
12 min: Neymar beginning to show some trickery but can’t pass Mascherano who 
basically falls to the ground to try and stop the Brazilian’s dribbling. 
Albiceleste dominating in possession now, looking to stay in the final third 
and actually looking to press slightly higher, hoping to pushBrazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> back to their own box. Di Maria 
hasn’t even touched the ball, until now...all the action has been on the right 
hand side.
 
8 min: Tite has instructed his team to not press until the opposition enter 
their half, then counter. Fernandinho gets a yellow as he elbows Messi, who had 
embarrassed him with a nice ball above his head. Things calm down after that and
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> push more - better 
from Bauza’s men. Brazil need to be careful with being over physical.
 
4 min: Brazil begin the first few minutes with quick possession and Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> hold, taking on their 
defensive shape, waiting to counter. It’s clear Higuaín will spearhead the 
frontline with Messi playing right behind him, free to move from left to right. 
Messi gets fouled about 35 yards outside of the box and takes a free-kick which 
goes nowhere.
 
1 min: Peep! And we’re off! Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> kick-off.
 
The squads walk out to the stadium and the atmosphere is electric as the FIFA 
anthem plays in the background. Dani Alves, by the way, wearing the No 4 shirt, 
in honor of the legendary Carlos Alberto, who passed away last month.

Now the anthems are playing and first it’s Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> followed by Brazil, which is 
obviously met with thunderous chants.

I don’t think I have ever seen Neymar or Messi so focused. 

There’s a moment of silence for Carlos Alberto. 

Next time you hear from me will be kick-off.
 
The stage is set and players are inside the tunnel ready to come out. It’s a 
beautiful albeit humid night in Belo Horizonte. Don’t forget you can email me 
or send me a tweet @lmechegaray.
 
One match, too many legends.

Uruguay is currently leading against Ecuador 1-0 and Paraguay and Peru have 
just started. Bolivia faces Venezuela at 7pm ET.

 
Preamble

Hello everyone and welcome to the Superclásico of South America as Brazil host 
Argentina in a crucialWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifier. For theses 
Conmebol nations, the road to Russia 2018 has been nothing short of thrilling 
as only six points separate the top seven teams in the table.

Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil>, thanks to Tite, are 
loving life right now as the 55-year-old manager has introduced a calmer, 
happier Selecao, free to express individual talent as well as cohesive 
teamwork. The result? Four consecutive victories and top of the table.

Argentina on the other hand are heading in the wrong direction and things need 
to change quickly. Edgardo Bauza has not started well and things went from bad 
to worse when Conmebol allotted three points to Chile and Peru as a result of 
Bolivia’s use of an ineligible player when they played against them. 
Consequently, Chile leap-froggedArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and currently hold the final 
qualifying spot.

The pressure is on Argentina to get something out of this match as they really 
can’t afford to drop any more points. Brazil, meanwhile, hope this ride keeps 
on going.

Here is Argentina’s line-up:
