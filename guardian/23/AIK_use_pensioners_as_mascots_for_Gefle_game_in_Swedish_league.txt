The Swedish club AIK tried a new initiative at the weekend, when the oldest 
living members of the club entered the pitch as mascots for their league match 
against Gefle IF.

The senior citizens replaced the regular mascots with the former Uefa 
president and honorary club president, Lennart Johansson, leading the way. The 
idea was part of a campaign to promote ticket discounts and free shuttle buses 
to and from retirement homes.

Johansson, who came on to the field to a rapturous reception with his fellow 
mascots, said: “There are a lot of us who have lived with AIK all of our lives 
but who can’t, for various reasons, get to the stadium these days. That doesn’t 
mean that we care less about the club. Maybe just that we have a little bit 
more difficulty travelling and moving around.”

The AIK chairman, Mikael Ahlerup, commented: “Our family section has for a 
long time been the biggest in Sweden and it is very important for us to get 
children and teenagers to the club but we can never forget about the generation 
that made this club to what it is. That’s why this initiative felt like an 
obvious thing to do.

“A family should consist of both young and old and today we completed our 
family by inviting and celebrating the elders. I’m proud to be a part of such 
an inclusive club,” he added.

AIK came out on top in the match, their 1-0 win taking them to third place in 
the table.
