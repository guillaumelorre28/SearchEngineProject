Jacob Zuma <https://www.theguardian.com/world/zuma>, South Africa’s 
beleaguered president, appeared to have won a fierce battle to remain in office 
as the ruling African National Congress concluded an intense and acrimonious 
three-day debate on whether he should stand down from the office he has held 
for seven years.

Ministers and MPs who sit on the ANC’s national executive committee passed the 
day closeted in a hotel south of Pretoria, the administrative capital ofSouth 
Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica>, arguing over Zuma’s 
fate.

Though there was no clear decision by Monday night, aides said Zuma would be 
leaving for Cuba as scheduled to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro, suggesting 
the 74-year-old veteran politician has seen off the immediate challenge for now.

Senior officials remained tight-lipped however, leaving open the possibility 
of a major upset which could trigger a long period of further political 
instability.

Zuma has faced mounting criticism of his leadership and came under further 
pressure this month when a corruption probe unearthed fresh allegations of 
misconduct.

The report by the country’s public protector, an independent state office 
charged with uncovering maladministration, focuses on Zuma’s close relationship 
with billionaire brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, who run a business 
empire ranging from media to mining. Zuma has denied giving the brothers any 
undue influence and they have denied seeking it.

The ANC led the struggle against the racist and repressive apartheid regime 
and then took power in 1994 in South Africa’s first free elections.

Though the party is still has substantial popular support, the unprecedented 
loss of major municipalities to a coalition of opposition parties after 
elections in August has also worried many among the ANC’s “reformist” faction.

Zuma, a former ANC security chief, retains strong loyalty among many party 
members and its lawmakers, and easily survived a vote of no confidence in 
parliament on 10 November, which was called by opposition politicians from the 
Democratic Alliance party.

Mmusi Maimane, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said on Monday the people of 
SouthAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> had learned not to trust 
Zuma’s “populism”.

“The ANC has lost support, but how much is because of Zuma, how much because 
of the economy, how much just due to sheer corruption? The current battle is 
not about the fitness of the president but about the soul of the ANC”, Maimane 
told the Guardian.

Commentators say though a significant number of ANC officials wanted the 
president to resign, no one wanted the party to be pushed into a decision by 
outside actors.

The local News24 news agency, 
<http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/exclusive-3-ministers-ask-zuma-to-step-down-20161128>
 citing sources within the ANC, reported three ministers had called for Zuma to 
resign during debates over the weekend.

The rebellion is the most serious challenge of the president’s seven years in 
power.

“There is no doubt that Zuma is fighting for his political life,” Ranjeni 
Munusamy, an analyst and commentator, wrote on the Daily Maverick.

“He is hanging on while it is clear that large sections of the ANC and 
alliance no longer want him as president ... The countdown for Zuma’s exit has 
begun.”

Zuma’s enemies within the ANC are backed by increasing numbers of 
anti-apartheid veterans, trade unions, civil groups and business leaders.

Zuma is president of the ANC – as well as of South Africa – and the party’s 
national executive committee is the only body within its structure that can 
remove the leader of the party, besides its five-yearly congress.

Zuma himself is one of the committee’s 104 members, most of which were elected 
in 2012 and include many loyal to him.

The president has made few concessions to his detractors, though he apologised 
earlier this year

 7.8m rand (£474,268), an amount determined by the national treasury.

The next national elections are due in 2019. Party strategists have been 
warned by outside experts that the ANC’s popularity is eroding fast.

But internal polls revealed that dissatisfaction with Zuma was only a minor 
factor for voters, with the ANC’s failure to deliver high-quality services such 
as water, schools, power and housing playing a greater role.
