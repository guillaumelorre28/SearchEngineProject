Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I have recently been promoted to team leader in my workplace. It is the second 
rung of the in-house managerial ladder. I have been working towards this for a 
year and finally got the opportunity to get the job. It’s on secondment for two 
months and will get made permanent at the end if it goes well.

I explained in my interview that although I have a basic knowledge of the 
in-house computer systems, I don’t have the knowledge that the other team 
leader or the manager has. Since I have been promoted I have had to text or 
ring one of them each shift in order to help with issues. I explained that I 
wanted training and needed it to be able to do my job properly, but I have been 
told that it’s going to be difficult to find the time. Things are going wrong 
and I am unable to fix them without knowing what to do. There have been 
occasions where they haven’t answered the phone and I have been completely 
stuck, made a call and been reprimanded for it the next shift.

If this continues I can’t see the secondment being made permanent, which would 
be from both sides, as I don’t want to take the job permanently if this is what 
is to come.
