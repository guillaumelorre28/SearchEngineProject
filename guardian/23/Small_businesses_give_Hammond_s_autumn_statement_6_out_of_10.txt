Investment in broadband, infrastructure and exporting, including a £23bn 
national productivity investment fund, were among the chancellor’sannouncements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/key-points-autumn-statement-at-a-glance>
 to boost business.

Delivering his autumn statement Philip Hammond said: “My priority as 
chancellor is to ensure that Britain remains the number one destination for 
business – creating the investment, the jobs and the prosperity to protect our 
long-term future.”

However, some small business groups said they had hoped for bolder 
initiatives. The Forum of Private Business gave the autumn statement six out of 
10 and were disappointed that the chancellor had not gone further to support 
small businesses in the post-Brexit era. Ian Cass, chief executive of the 
Forum, said: “It is really disappointing that he has opted for caution over 
stimulus.”

Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “We 
would have liked to see more action on the high up-front taxes and costs of 
doing business in the UK, particularly business rates.”

Hammond announced that the government will encourage exporters, doubling the 
UK export financial capacity. There will also be £400m for the British Business 
Bank to invest in fintech firms.

The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the news that rural rate relief is 
to be increased to 100%:

However, Ross Murray, president of the CLA <https://www.cla.org.uk/>, which 
represents landowners, farmers and rural businesses across England and Wales, 
said it was hard to see from this autumn statement how rural business fit in to 
the chancellor’s vision for Britain’s economic future. “The investments 
announced today are overwhelmingly targeted at improving facilities within, and 
connections between, our cities. We understand why this is important but it 
must not be done at the expense of opportunities to support the rural economy 
and build the homes we need to sustain our rural communities.”

On digital connectivity Murray said: “There is little comfort in this for 
rural people still struggling to get minimum connection speeds.”

Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, welcomed the 
chancellor’s attempts to invest in broadband, and infrastructure, but added:


“We are surprised that amidst all of the political and economic uncertainty 
there weren’t many measures to help ‘just managing’ businesses now. The 
government will be borrowing heavily over the next few years, so it’s a shame 
that they couldn’t use more of the fiscal headroom to encourage investment 
through measures such as raising the annual investment allowance, which could 
deliver productivity increases sooner.”

, said:“I can see how a reduction in corporation tax makes the UK an attractive 
place for inward investment. However, if we want to boost productivity through 
technological innovation, why cut tax as far as 17%? Strategically it makes 
more sense to target incentives to firms investing in technology through 
increases in R&D tax credits and capital allowances. Great tech startups can 
attract capital anyway, so I struggle to see how government funding will stop 
early exits by our best businesses. What we really need is more talent not 
finance.”

He added he was disappointed he saw nothing to tackle business rates – “an 
issue that’s a constant problem for SMEs”.

Self-employed

IPSE, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed, said 
it was seriously concerned at the chancellor’s announcement of a consultation 
on how to increase the amount of tax the self-employed pay. Andy Chamberlain, 
deputy director of policy at IPSE, said:

“We’re very disappointed that the chancellor mentioned the self-employed in 
the same breath as tax avoidance. He didn’t acknowledge that the rise in 
self-employment has led to a reduction in unemployment. He talked about the 
self-employed in the terms of tax yield and tax awareness – the self-employed 
are not self-employed in order to avoid tax. We are concerned by Mr Hammond’s 
rhetoric on the issue.”

Emma Jones, founder of small business support group, Enterprise Nation agreed: 
“It’s absolutely the government’s responsibility to invest in the 
infrastructure and technology we need to boost our economy, we all benefit from 
that. But for the only reference to hard-working small businesses and the 
self-employed to be in connection with tax avoidance is worrying. Is this a 
dawning of a dangerous new era for entrepreneurs in post-Brexit Britain?”

Tackling skills shortages

Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, the professional body for HR 
and people development, said it welcomed the decision to invest £13m in the Sir 
Charlie Mayfield led initiative, that aims to improve management skills across 
businesses, but said without changes to skills policy, in relation to 
apprenticeships, lifelong learning and adult skills provision, productivity 
would be undermined. But it welcomed the decision to invest £1.8bn in local 
enterprise partnerships.

Bill Esterson, shadow minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, 
said: “This country should be a high-skill, high-wage economy and the 
government needs to invest in infrastructure and in skills. It is time for the 
chancellor to be a partner to business and for working people.”
