Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
are two similar dilemmas – what are your thoughts?

I’m in my 40s and have worked in several sectors. I’ve now come to a 
standstill in my career, where I’m working for the NHS as a doctor’s 
receptionist. “Dragons, wannabe doctors” as everyone calls us ... This, of 
course, is not true, but why bother to explain, it will make no difference.

I want a change, but feel like I’m an old person in a new, just-out-of-school, 
willing-to-learn/make-a-difference world. How do I prove that I can be the 
right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens?

From: an intelligent, know-practically-everything mother of two.
