Starring the British actor Felicity Jones, as the fugitive rebel Jyn Erso, the 
film was described as “muscular and adroit … another really entertaining 
fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack” by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawin 
his four-star review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards>
.

The film features an appearance by Peter Cushing as the villainous Imperial 
leader Grand Moff Tarkin. Cushing, who appeared in the original 1977 Star Wars 
film, died in 1994 but is represented using digital technology, which Bradshaw 
described as: “Almost creepily exact, so that watching feels at various stages 
like going into a time machine, back to the 80s and 70s.”

Rogue One will have to make more than £47.9m to be the biggest film of the 
year in the UK. The record is held by Bridget Jones’s Baby, which was released 
in September.

Disney’s reboot of The Jungle Book, which combined a live-action Mowgli with 
computer-generated cast of animals, pulled in £46.2m and Finding Dory, the 
sequel to Finding Nemo, reaped £42.8m.
