I thought she gave it a peach of a ride. Victoria did the right thing: she 
took her time, went down the inside and gave the horse every chance. It seemed 
to be galloping within itself the whole way, which is the key to riding at 
Cheltenham.

It would have been very easy for her to panic early on when she was at the 
back of the field, try to pass horses too soon and end up not finishing the 
race.It’s an incredible feat and she gave her holy all

.

As far as her style is concerned it looks as if she moves her head over fences 
rather than her body. Her body position seems to be fine but she just drops her 
head a little bit – but it’s nothing that would worry me. She doesn’t have to 
change a whole lot, as long as she keeps enjoying it. She needs work on 
strengthening her legs and continue to develop her racing brain. That’s the 
most important thing.

Anyone who put money on her to win the race would have done so knowing she’s a 
very inexperienced rider. If they are irate about losing money on it, it’s 
their own fault. It certainly isn’t Pendleton’s: she went out there and gave 
her very best. I personally would be delighted with the way she rode that horse.

She came back into the parade ring with a smile on her face and, as far as I’m 
concerned, that’s a winner. She put all the queries to bed, she didn’t get in 
anybody’s way and her performance made it a better race.
