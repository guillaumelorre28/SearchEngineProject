Millions of workers will get better value for money when fees for managing 
their pension pots are capped at 0.75% from April 2015,the City regulator has 
said

. But the government is still under pressure from some quarters to cut the 
maximum fee to 0.5%.


The new “charge cap” applies to employees being put into a workplace pension 
under the auto-enrolment regime introduced in October 2012.

This requires all employers to automatically enrol eligible workers into a 
pension scheme into which both the employee and the company make payments. Many 
of these employees will not actively choose a fund in which to invest their 
money, and will be put into the scheme’s “default” fund.


The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has now confirmed its final rules 
requiring charges on auto-enrolment default funds to be capped at 0.75% a year 
of funds under management from 6 April 2015.


Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s director of strategy and competition, said: “It 
is important that those saving into workplace pension schemes get value for 
money, and this is especially true for those not playing an active role in 
deciding where their money is invested.

“Schemes need to work effectively for members, and the charge cap, alongside 
other new measures … will help to ensure this going forward.”


 The Department for Work and Pensions has said small differences in charges 
can have a major impact on a pension pot

 by the time a person retires. An average earner who builds up a pension pot of 
£30,000 could benefit to the tune of £1,600 by saving in a scheme charging 
0.75% compared to one that charges 1.5%, the DWP said last autumn, adding that 
for many people the boost could run into “tens of thousands of pounds”.


But the National Association of Pension Funds has described the cap as a 
“blunt tool”, at a time when competition is already driving charges down below 
the 0.75% level.


A report by the Office of Fair Trading 
<http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131101164215/http:/www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1505>
 published in 2013 showed that the average charge on new pension schemes set up 
in 2012 was 0.51%.


Legal & General said it was the first insurer to cap charges at 0.5% on 
default auto-enrolment schemes, and added: “A more realistic cap should be 0.5% 
for new schemes.”


Meanwhile, the government has set up a scheme for employers to join called 
Nest (National Employment Savings Trust), whichimposes an annual management 
charge of 0.3%

 on the total value of a member’s fund each year. However, there is also a 
contribution charge of 1.8% on each new payment into a member’s retirement pot.


The FCA rules also mean that the firms running the pension schemes will be 
prevented from paying or receiving consultancy charges, and from charging 
active and “deferred” members of schemes differently based on whether they are 
paying in or not.
