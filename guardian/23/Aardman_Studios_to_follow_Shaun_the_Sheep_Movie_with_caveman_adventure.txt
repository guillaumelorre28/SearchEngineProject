StudioCanal is hoping to emulate the success of the Shaun the Sheep Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/shaun-the-sheep-movie> by teaming up with 
Aardman Animations on another project.

The film, called Early Man, will be another stop-frame animation, and will 
tell the story of a caveman who unites his tribe to combat a mutual enemy while 
simultaneously trying to fend off dinosaurs. Nick Park will take on directing 
duties, helming his first movie since the short film Wallace & Gromit: A Matter 
of Loaf and Death in 2008.

The script will be written by Mark Burton and John O’Farrell. Burton worked 
withAardman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> on The Curse of the 
Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run (alongside O’Farrell), as well as on other kids 
movies, including Gnomeo & Juliet.

“I’m very excited to be making this film with such great partners – 
StudioCanal and BFI,” said Park, in a statement. “And with the support of the 
incredible team at Aardman, bringing this inept bunch of cavemen to life is 
going to be a hilarious adventure.”
