I am 26 and I came out as gay at the end of last year. I am from a religious 
background and I feel stuck between two realms and I can’t find the appropriate 
balance. Seeking a lasting loving relationship for a 26-year-old virgin is not 
as easy as I thought. With so much preference for everyone to be physical in 
gay culture, I feel disappointed and even more alone in a foreign country. 
Dating websites only add to my sorrow and despair. From the religion side, it 
seems everyone hates me for who I love. I feel I can’t even go back nor move 
forward, since it seems I am not worth loving, even though I am a talented, 
loving, caring individual. If someone could see beyond the appearance, they 
would be see my inner beauty, but no one bothers.
