Donald Trump’s election effectively puts an end to the gun control legislation 
proposed by Democrats. Under Barack Obama, gun companies have enjoyed record 
breaking sales and share price growth driven by fears that he would tighten 
rules on sales following a series of mass shootings.

Smith & Wesson’s shares were down 10.21% and shares of Sturm Ruger were down 
12.29% in early morning trading.

Gun sales have reliably spiked in the US after every mass shooting. Last 
year’s post-Thanksgiving Black Friday sales saw gun sales spike so sharply that 
the FBI clocked computerized background checks necessary for gun purchases atan 
average of two per second

.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> had

seven wounded.

Larry Keane, the senior vice-president for government and public affairs at 
the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a gun manufacturers’ lobby 
group, denied that there might be market challenges for gun companies under 
Trump.

“We look forward to working with the Trump administration and the next 
Congress to protect, strengthen and expand the ability of law-abiding Americans 
to exercise their rights to keep and bear arms as protected by the second 
amendment and to improve and enhance the ability of our industry members to 
grow their businesses and create more good-paying American jobs,” he said.

, outperforming much of the stock market. Last year Brian Ruttenbur, a firearms 
sector analyst with BB&T, said gun companies had much to be grateful for during 
the Obama administration. “If I was a gun manufacturer I would just say: ‘Thank 
you, President Obama,’” he said.
