Alice Cooper <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alicecooper> is branching out 
from shock rock to family entertainment, launching an attraction at Hollywood's 
Universal Studios theme park. Welcome to My Nightmare is a spooky new maze, 
inspired by Cooper's forthcoming album.

Cooper has helped design an attraction that takes guests past electric chairs, 
guillotines, giant spiders and at least one "predatory snake". The installation 
is part of Universal Studios' Halloween programming, running from 23 September 
to 31 October. "As a life-long Alice Cooper fan who's been motivated and 
inspired by his craft, I am absolutely thrilled by this incredible 
opportunity," creative director John Murdy told theHollywood Reporter 
<http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/branding/alice-cooper-teams-up-with-universal-studios-1005301222.story>
. "It's a nightmare come true."

For Cooper, the maze seems less about life-long passions and more about 
promoting his 26th studio album. The Welcome to My Nightmare maze will 
incorporate songs from Cooper's Welcome 2 My Nightmare album, due 13 September. 
The new LP is a sequel to his 1975 album, produced once again by Bob Ezrin and 
featuring several members of Cooper's original band. Unlike the original 
Welcome to My Nightmare, the 2011 album includes a duet with, er, Ke$ha.

The maze "is a nightmare that will haunt visitors' dreams for a long time to 
come", Cooper said. It's a "living horror movie", he said, "so there's no place 
more appropriate to offer a preview of the new [record]."
