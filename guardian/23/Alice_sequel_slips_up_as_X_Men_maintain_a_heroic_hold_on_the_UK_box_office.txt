The big battle: X-Men v Alice

Having debuted with £5.31m plus £2.05m in previews, X-Men: Apocalypse looked 
on course for a solid second weekend, perhaps declining at a similar rate (53%) 
to the second frame of previous X-Men title Days of Future Past. The challenger:
Alice Through the Looking Glass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alice-through-the-looking-glass>. Predecessor 
Alice in Wonderland began in March 2010 with £10.56m, on its way to a lifetime 
total of £42.5m. Not many expected this sequel, which was not directed by Tim 
Burton, to perform at that level – but residual affection for the franchise 
should remain?

‘It’s nice for the ego’: Oscar Isaac on X-Men: Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/18/x-men-apocalypse-oscar-isaac-marvel>
The result: X-Men: Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men-apocalypse> fell a par-for-the-course 
52%, with second-weekend takings of £2.54m. After 12 days, the film has grossed 
£12.13m, which rises to just under £13m including bank holiday Monday. That was 
enough to resist the challenge of Disney’s Alice Through the Looking Glass, 
which begins with a disappointing £2.23m, a mere 21% of Alice in Wonderland’s 
opening weekend gross. Including the bank holiday (when Alice beat X-Men), that 
number rises to a healthier £3.12m. This result will be a rather nasty jolt for 
Disney, after a glorious run, in which all of its divisions – including Pixar 
(Inside Out), Lucasfilm (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), Marvel (Captain 
America: Civil War), Walt Disney Animation (Zootropolis) and Walt Disney 
Pictures (The Jungle Book) – delivered a series of hits that has made the 
studio the envy of Hollywood.

Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass – video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview>
Of course, there is no such thing as a Midas touch, and a flop was going to 
show up sooner or later. The poor result for Alice Through the Looking Glass is 
a salutary lesson that just because audiences embraced one film doesn’t 
necessarily mean they desire to see another featuring the same characters. That 
can often be the case with comedies – Ted 2 fell well below Ted – and examples 
from other genres include Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, where sequel Cradle of Life 
(£5.30m) fell far short of the original (£12.82m). An even more potent example 
is The Chronicles of Narnia, which saw second episode Prince Caspian (£11.79m) 
struggle to make much more than a quarter of the box office of The Lion, The 
Witch and the Wardrobe (£44.40m) here in the UK. Whether Johnny Depp’s current 
personal travails played into this result is anyone’s guess. More likely, 
Through the Looking Glass is a less-loved and less-read book, and therefore 
didn’t deliver equivalent brand value. Or perhaps the Mad Hatter is simply one 
of Depp’s more distinctive characters where a little goes a very long way, and 
once was enough for most audiences. With kids now at home for the half-term 
holiday, Alice should play reasonably strongly all week – and, indeed, Disney 
reports that the film topped the box office on Tuesday by a significant margin, 
enough to move it past X-Men: Apocalypse for the week so far.

The star vehicle: Money Monster

With £821,000 from 414 cinemas, Money Monster has landed in that middle ground 
between a bona fide hit and a costly flop. Bank holiday Monday pushes the tally 
to an OK £1.10m. Money Monster benefited from two A-list stars in the shape of 
George Clooney and Julia Roberts, but the financial TV show setting might be 
considered less than broadly mainstream. Roberts is coming off flop remake 
Secret in Their Eyes, and Clooney off the Coens’ amiable Hollywood satireHail, 
Caesar!

. Before that he was in The Monuments Men and Tomorrowland: A World Beyond – 
two films that didn’t quite live up to their creative potential, and which 
achieved UK openings respectively of £1.48m and £1.62m.

The indie hit: Love & Friendship

Buoyed by wildly positive reviews including five-star raves in the Guardian, 
Times and Telegraph, Love & Friendship delivered by far the biggest opening of 
US indie director Whit Stillman’s career. Released in 80 cinemas, the Jane 
Austen adaptation grossed £246,000 plus £17,000 in previews, with a strong bank 
holiday Monday lifting the total to £382,000. Takings on the Monday holiday not 
only crushed Friday, as you’d expect, but also beat Saturday and Sunday. 
Stillman’s last movie Damsels in Distress began its run with £45,000 from 19 
cinemas, on its way to a lifetime total of £118,000. The director’s biggest hit 
remains The Last Days of Disco, which reached £619,000 in 1998. Love & 
Friendship is an adaptation of early Jane Austen epistolary novel Lady Susan. 
Period literary adaptations typically perform well midweek (to an older 
audience), and usually see a strong sustain in weeks two, three and sometimes 
beyond. All the planets look aligned for Stillman to achieve his first £1m UK 
hit.

The screen shedders

Several films saw their site averages hold up strongly, despite their box 
office dipping by significant amounts from the previous frame. The reason is 
that they all shed a huge chunk of their underperforming venues. Case in point 
is Florence Foster Jenkins, which contracted at the weekend from 434 to 145 
cinemas. Box office fell 70%, but site average held up, with just a 9% drop. 
Our Kind of Traitor pulled in its footprint from 256 to 138 cinemas; Eye in the 
Sky from 185 to 89; and Everybody Wants Some!! from 121 to 44. All these films 
saw box office fall by at least 60%, but site averages remained firm.

Secret Cinema: postmortem

Secret Cinema Presents 28 Days Later ended its run on Sunday, after a 
seven-week occupancy. Total box office was £1.33m, an average of £190,000 per 
week. The film grossed £6.30m during its original run in 2002, so the Secret 
Cinema presentation has boosted the total by 21%. How much of the £1.33m flows 
back to distributor Fox and rights holders is hard to say. Secret Cinema incurs 
significant costs to deliver the interactive experience, and revenue splits for 
the premium ticket price almost certainly do not follow traditional film 
industry models. Secret Cinema’s Tell No One presentation of Dr Strangelove 
ended in March with £1.25m from weeks of play.

Largely thanks to the disappointing performance of Alice Through the Looking 
Glass, box office overall is down 36% on the previous frame and also down 29% 
on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Dwayne Johnson actioner San Andreas 
opened at the top with £4.63m including previews. Cinema bookers now have their 
hopes pinned on a couple of titles that benefited from bank holiday Monday 
previews –Warcraft: The Beginning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh>
