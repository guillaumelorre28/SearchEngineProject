The Asian Cup featured stars both on and off the field, with passionate, loud, 
musical, and most importantly, smiling crowds.

Here are 12 of the best fan moments that made the event magical:

1. The dancing Kuwaitis

 Hope is in the air. The first game of the tournament is a sellout between 
Australia and Kuwait at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. Outside the stadium, 
the precinct is flooded with yellow.

No exotic entertainment, no sign yet of Asia.


Then up step four Kuwaitis with a mini stereo, dressed in boots, scarves and 
roomy traditional clothing.


No permits, no questions and hopefully no forgiveness required. The music went 
on, the lads danced in jumping, circular, joyous fashion to a cheering crowd.


After two songs, they grabbed their stereo and blended back into the sea of 
yellow. With the unofficial community opening ceremony complete, Asia had 
officially landed.

2. The power and the passion of Team Melli fans

Pre-tournament, many critics said nobody would turn up for the Asian Cup Games 
in which the Socceroos weren’t playing. How wrong they were.

For every event that aspires to be great, the tone of excellence is set early 
and the momentum built upon.

 For the AFC Asian Cup it was the Iranians who set the early pace and due to 
visa restrictions they had no inbound tourist fans to supplement local fans.

 In Melbourne 17,000 screaming fans turned out against Bahrain. Disciplined 
and loud, with great song variety, they were marshalled by chant-leading 
‘capos’ in fluoro orange.

Some said the Iranian 17,000 were louder than the Melbourne A-League derby 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL6ANYg3isM>.

 The real story was the passion of the hordes of vivacious Iranian female fans 
who came out in full bloom, thumbing their nose at the Tehran regime who 
enforce a ban on women attending football in Iran.

After the Melbourne game the Iranian community danced outside the stadium 
until 1.30am <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCWMcKhAf_Y&t=3m3s>.

 After friendly taunts on Facebook the next Iranian game in Sydney had a crowd 
of almost 23,000 chanting fans. Coach Carlos Queiroz called Stadium Australia 
“Little Azadi” referring to the 120,000 Azadi stadium in Tehran.

Iran also won the best fan banner of the tournament 
<https://twitter.com/Patrick_Skene/status/560670073904705536/photo/1>.

In the quarter final in Canberra, the locals had never heard a roar like it 
when Reza Goochannejhad scored the equaliser 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9QpyXx9znY&t=3m29s> to go 3-3 against Iraq.

Two wonderful Iranian fan stories were published by Joe Gorman in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/23/asian-cup-iran-fans-protest>
 and Dom Bossi in theSydney Morning Herald 
<http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/afc-asian-cup/team-melli-uniting-divided-iran-at-asian-cup-20150114-12nu6t.html?rand=1421230950508>
 that captured the mood beautifully.

They sang, they danced, they laughed and they cried 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-oJsUtOXM>.

 Salut the joyous fans of Team Melli.

3. Dai the diplomat

The Samurai Blue fans were left disappointed with their early exit but they 
turned out in big numbers for a 25,000 sellout in Melbourne, 17,000 in 
Newcastle and almost 23,000 in Brisbane.

 Their fans were loud and their chanting relentless.

 Japanese Asian Cup Community Ambassador Dai “Sorry” Maeyama was responsible 
for some of the great fan moments of the Cup.

 Dai became a cult hero among the community ambassadors and became legendary 
for his knowledge and enthusiasm.

First in Cessnock he interviewed FoxSports commentator Adam Peacock 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTAHZkuqxWg>.

A few days later, before the Japan v Palestine game, he was at Fort Scratchley 
in Newcastle fora goodwill ceremony to remember Japanese submarines shelling 
Newcastle in World War Two 
<http://www.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2015/01/11/japanese-tourists-fire-fort-scratchleys-guns-in-goodwill-gesture/>
.

 Dai Maeyama fired the cannon and engaged with the Diggers in a truly 
wonderful moment.

His interview with Tara Rushton 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAef-YMi6aA&t=6m35s> was also Asian-Australian 
cross cultural gold.

4. The gallant Uzbek 300

Uzbekistan’s Australian community is small in numbers but big in heart and its 
rhythmic drumming and funky headwear brought the Silk Road to our stadiums.

 Their food and hospitality was wonderful, Uzbek smiles lit up the stadiums 
and their multicultural team of Russians and Uzbeks played entertaining 
football.

The White Wolves were shrouded in mystery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/13/asian-cup-uzbekistan-preview>
 early in the tournament, holding secret training sessions and keeping to 
themselves.

Martin Flanagan wrote a wonderful piece 
<http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/forwards-uzbekistan-local-fans-hope-for-a-repeat-of-past-glories-20150116-12r1c2.html>
 on visiting Shahin and Alisher, two of the Uzbekistan Asian Cup Community 
Ambassadors at their Dandenong restaurant.

His follow up piece on the gallant Uzbek 300 
<http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/drums-sound-defeat-for-uzbekistan-20150123-12wki2.html>
 also captured the full flavor of the Uzbek fan passion.

5. Dual identity fans

 With 47% of Australians having one or more parent born overseas, many new 
migrants wrestle with the issue of dual identity.

 In the Asian Cup, many fans showed they were proud of their dual identity, 
screaming both for the Socceroos and their ancestral country with equal fervour.

 It was a high water mark for multiculturalism and many said they’d never felt 
more Australian. Nation building at its finest.

6. Iraqi fans – the 12th man

The Iraqi fans brought a new layer of passion to the Asian Cup. They sang 
outside the team hotel, they danced on the streets andoutside 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4rhN87W2rU> and inside stadiums. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14MI-ghfll4>

There is a lot at stake when Iraq plays and for the many tribes of Iraq 
supporting Iraqi football is a life and death roller coaster. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/31/yalla-yalla-the-joy-and-pain-of-supporting-iraqi-football>

The Lions of Mesopotamia received tremendous love from their Australian 
communities including abeautiful fan day in Brisbane 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECdCvGgr5t0>.

Whenever the Iraq team and their fans came together special moments occurred, 
both off andon the field

Fox Sports’ story on the Iraq fans 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89YnU3IuwAc> who travelled to Brisbane showed 
men who oozed excitement for Iraq and were proudly Australian.


 In the stadium in Canberra they sang louder and louder with each goal. “Hassa 
Yejee Al Awel – now the first goal will come.” “Hassa Yejee Thanee – now the 
second goal will come.”

After the win against Iran in Canberra they danced in the stadium 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJwwkKY3e5w>.

 After dancing in Canberra and fuelled on coffee, they drove three hours back 
to Fairfield and danced until 5am.

In Iraq the fans celebrated as if they had won the Asian Cup 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBBdVrjQmY>.

 Iraqi football fans, thank you for sharing another wild ride.

7. North Korean fans – generals, hipsters and cheapskates

With only 39 North Korean residents officially in Australia, supporters for 
the team would have to come from other areas.

Joe Gorman’s brilliant story on the North Korean fans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/15/north-korea-asian-cup-blog>
 summarised them perfectly:

 “To fill the void, the North Koreans are being supported at the Asian Cup by 
a motley crew of inner-city hipsters looking for an appropriately ironic team 
to follow, whack-job communists still raging against the dying light of 
Marxism-Leninism, cheapskates taking advantage of the cut-price tickets (and I 
mean cut-price – you can get into North Korean group matches for a tenner), 
and, most curiously of all, the South Koreanreunificationists 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-09/sydney-koreans-unite-to-support-the-north-in-the-asian-cup/6008708>
.”

 In Canberra after China had beaten North Korea 2-1, I arrived at the bar to 
find Kim Jong-un’s three generals in full kit celebrating and shouting “We won 
25-0, front page Pyongyang Daily.”

8. The Red Army rises again

China went from regional easy beats to well-oiled machine, winning all three 
group games and going down gallantly to the Socceroos. Their fans responded 
with big crowds including a sellout in Canberra.

The sleeping dragon had awoken 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/22/asian-cup-quarter-final-china-focus>
.

At every China game there was love in the air with mass fan drum chants, one 
marriage proposal in the stadium 
<https://twitter.com/afcasiancup/status/555317498355007488/photo/1> (spoiler – 
she said yes!) and everyone danced from grandmas to small babies.

In every stadium when the Chinese had their backs to the wall the crowd would 
sing a Chinese kindergarten song “Ge Song Zung Go” or “I am proud for the 
Communist motherland”.


In Canberra, emboldened by their undefeated run, the crowd chanted an NRL 
style “Bullshit, bullshit” at one dubious refereeing decision.


Before the Brisbane quarter final between Australia and China I asked 
community ambassador Michael Ma <http://

 who he was going for.


He smiled and said: “That’s easy – both! Double happiness for me.”

9. Red Devils and drummers

The South Korean fans came out in numbers for every game and were rallied 
outside and inside stadiums by the magnificent Korean drumming women.


They kept a steady beat, leading the crowd chants and having a swell time.

 After games the Korean fans cleaned the grandstands completely and left.

If Stadium Australia had a roof it would have popped for South Korea’s first 
goal against Iraq <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3miPpgUnbQ&t=0m40s> in the 
semi final.

Before the final, if there were any nerves in the Korean community it didn’t 
show.

 Cool, calm and collected their fans showed great honour in defeat.

10. The musicians

All manner of approved and unapproved instruments came into stadiums as fans 
celebrated their culture. From the rhythmic central Asian drum beats of the 
Uzbek fans to the middle eastern hand drums of the Iraqi fans; from the South 
Korean spoon master and drumming women, to the Palestinian fiddler, or the 
pounding Japanese Taiko drums, it was a veritable feast of Asian music.

 A bow to all of the musicians who made the Asian Cup a rich reminder of the 
wonderful diversity of our region.

11. The 90-minute Dabke

For the entire duration of every game Palestine played, their fans did the 
Dabke dance from start to finish – a celebration that, while in the eyes of the 
international community they may not formally be a nation, within football 
tournaments for an hour and a half, they are.

Every second mattered and for a small community they had a big turnout of fans 
whohad waited 87 years for this moment 
<http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/palestines-87-year-journey-to-the-asian-cup-is-the-most-uplifting-story-youll-read-all-week/8309?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=onsite_share>
.

They won hearts in Newcastle and their experience was captured beautifully by 
Tim Connell in astory in the Newcastle Herald 
<http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2806784/asian-cup-palestines-journey-of-a-lifetime/>
 and another by Niko Leka on the Palestinian journey and concept of “sammoud” 
<http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2805188/opinion-winners-before-first-whistle/>
.

 By the time the Palestine team reached Melbourne their fans were fever pitch.

The Palestinian fan experience in Melbourne was captured by Joe Gorman’s 
excellent Guardian story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/12/asian-cup-palestine-fans-preview>
 in which Mohammad, a fan was quoted as saying: “Support is awareness. If I was 
a player who came here from a war zone and saw the thousands of people who will 
be dressed in Palestinian colours, that’s more of a victory than actually 
winning a game.”

12. UAE crying fan

If there was one moment that encapsulated the passion of the Asian Cup it was 
theUAE fan that broke down <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1LHWWIiEeA&t=4m32s> 
during penalties against Japan.

 The pressure had broken him and with teary eyes he prayed for his team. When 
Khamis “the Rock” Esmail missed the penalty he fell over distraught and had to 
be helped up.

He had composed himself <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1LHWWIiEeA&t=9m20s> 
before the final penalty by big man Ismail Ahmed and went on to celebrate a 
great victory.

 Beamed to millions across Asia he showed what the Asian Cup means.

 For many, the very face of the passion and fanaticism that gives fans their 
name; a sole UAE fan watches his side during a nerve-wrecking penalty shootout.

Special mention:  The Aussie fans who went beyond Socceroos games and adopted 
a team. I hope you were rewarded for your efforts.

But for the final word on Asian Cup legacy we return to cult hero community 
ambassador Dai Maeyama: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAef-YMi6aA&t=4m22s> 

“Australia is a good country now, after Asian Cup it will be a more fantastic 
country.”
