Every new year brings with it the promise of astonishing video games, but what 
does 2017 have in store? Will this be a vintage year?

From returning legends to innovative new projects, there’s an impressive 
amount of fascinating stuff on the way – and we’ve tried to cram in everything, 
including big budget sequels, unexpected offshoots and tiny independent 
projects.

If we’ve somehow overlooked your highlight of the coming year, let us know in 
the comments section!

 Magical realist adventure … 29 by Humble Grove. Photograph: Humble Grove 
Described as a magical realist adventure, 29 is set within a single flat 
(actually owned by the game’s development team), and follows the lives of its 
inhabitants as they prepare to move out and move on with their lives. Beautiful 
visuals and atmosphere.

 Haunting … Below. Photograph: Capybara Games 
The latest project from Toronto-based studio Capybara Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> (Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery 
EP, Super Time Force), is an overhead-view adventure game, where players 
explore a mysterious island riddled with caves. The roguelike structure and 
sharp, minimalist visuals promise a haunting – and demanding – experience.

 Cultish … The Church in the Darkness. Photograph: Paranoid Productions 
A really fascinating stealth/infiltration game where the player has to sneak 
into a remote town occupied by a religious cult in an attempt to rescue a 
relative. The environment is procedurally generated so the challenge is 
different each time you play.

Crackdown 3 <http://www.crackdown.com/> (Reagent; Xbox One/PC)
 Appetite for destruction … Crackdown 3. Photograph: Microsoft 
Developed by Reagent Games, the new studio from Dave Jones (Lemmings, Grand 
Theft Auto), this open-world city-based action romp is set to feature the most 
authentically destructible environments ever seen in a game, thanks to a 
cutting edge cloud-based physics engine. Should be a blast.
Release date: TBC

Cuphead <http://cupheadgame.com/> (Studio MHDR; PC/Xbox One)


It feels like we’ve been waiting years for this beautiful side-scrolling 
shooter that takes its visual cues from 1930s American animation. Using 
hand-drawn characters, painted backgrounds and a vintage jazz soundtrack, it’s 
a remarkably faithful tribute to the era.
Release date: Mid-2017

Days Gone <https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/days-gone-ps4/> (Bend 
Studio; PS4)
 A zombie game, but not as we know it … Days Gone. Photograph: Sony 
Yes, it’s another apocalyptic zombie game, but this time, rather than a 
straightforward narrative adventure, players get a vast open world to explore 
and survive in, crafting tools and developing strategies to deal with vast 
swarms of intelligent monsters. It looks astonishing too.
Release date: TBC

Destiny 2 (Bungie; PS4/Xbox One/PC)
 We know Destiny 2 will be released this year. But that’s about it. 
Photograph: Michael Nelson/EPA 
Everyone knows Bungie is working on a full sequel to its 2014 online shooter 
after a series of major expansion packs – but that’s essentially all we know. 
After the studio advertised a number of narrative designer roles last year, the 
expectation is for a major story overhaul, with regular plot updates added 
through the year. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, the lead designers onThe 
Taken King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/22/destiny-taken-king-review-finally-good-game>
, are believed to be in charge.According to Eurogamer 
<http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-09-28-destiny-2-will-launch-for-pc-characters-may-be-left-behind-reports>
, social areas will now include an element of gunplay, breaking down the 
barriers between different facets of the game.

Detroit: Become Human <http://www.quanticdream.com/en/> (Quantic Dream; PS4)

French studio Quantic Dream (Heavy Rain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/feb/18/heavy-rain-ps3-game-review>
,Beyond Two Souls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/10/beyond-two-souls-review>) 
often draws criticism for its grandiloquent, highly intellectualised approach 
to game design, but its projects are always interesting and gorgeous to look 
at. This neo-noir tale of sentient androids on the loose in a near-future 
America is no exception.
Release: likely late 2017

For Honor <http://forhonor.ubisoft.com/game/en-gb/home/> (Ubisoft; PC/PS4/Xbox 
One)
 For Honor Photograph: Ubisoft 
Promising a new, much more tactical take on the hack-’n-slash genre, For Honor 
lets players select from a range of warrior archetypes including Knight, Viking 
and Samurai before taking part in multiplayer brawls. The clever anlogue 
controls give you precise control over your weapon and shield, allowing for a 
uniquely tactile combat experience.
Release: 14 February

Guardians of the Galaxy (Telltale PC/PS4/Xbox One/mobile devices)

Revealed as Telltale’s next episodic adventure in December, it’s not yet clear 
whether the game will follow the comic book or movie narratives. Due later this 
year however, it will segue nicely with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. Players 
will switch between different members of the eccentric cast, flying through 
space and getting into trouble.
Release: TBC 

GNOG <https://www.gnoggame.com/> (Ko-Op Mode/Double Fine; PS4)
 GNOG Photograph: Ko-Op Studios 
Originally conceived as a 2D puzzler, GNOG has since transformed into a 
delightfully surreal 3D puzzle adventure set within the heads of vast robotic 
monsters. Each cranium has its own rules, mechanics and visual style, and the 
whole thing is weirdly beautiful.
Release date: TBC

God of War <http://godofwar.playstation.com/> (Sony Santa Monica; PS4)
 Deity-crushing action … God of War. Photograph: Sony 
Everyone’s favourite deity-crushing warrior Kratos is back in this “soft 
reboot” of the famed hack-’em-up series. This time he’s taking on the pantheon 
of Norse gods, accompanied by his son, who he must teach to hunt and fight. The
footage shown at E3 last year <https://youtu.be/CJ_GCPaKywg> has piqued the 
interest of newcomers in addition to confirmed god-battering mega fans.

Gravity Rush 2 <https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gravity-rush-2-ps4/> 
(SIE Japan Studio/Project Siren; PS4)
 Gravity Rush 2 Photograph: Sony 
The futuristic gravity-manipulating adventure is returning with a more 
detailed and interactive city and two new types of gravity power. Lead 
character Kat can now also tag-team with her ally Raven as they investigate the 
weird gravitational waves messing up Hekseville. The original was a trippy and 
visually arresting treat – let’s hope that’s not turned on its head with the 
sequel.

Hidden Folks <http://hiddenfolks.com/> (Adriaan de Jongh/Sylvain Tegroeg; 
PC/smartphone)
 Where’s Wally reimagined … Hidden Folks. Photograph: Adriaan de Jongh/Sylvain 
Tegroeg 
Imagine Where’s Wally set in a hand-drawn monochromatic and highly animated 
world filled with life and detail – that’s Hidden Folks. Each of the areas has 
a number of people and items to find, and players often have to open doors, or 
move objects to locate them, making this a beautifully tactile experience.
Release: TBC

Home Free (Kevin Cancienne; PC/PS4)

 Home Free Photograph: Kevin Cancienne 
Successfully Kickstarted in 2015, Home Free is effectively an open-world 
canine survival sim, in which you play as a stray dog lost in a big city. You 
can beg for food, socialise with other dogs and explore the procedurally 
generated environment that’s different every time you play. Dog lovers will 
doubtlesssit and stay in front of this for hours.

Easily one of the most anticipated mainstream console titles of the year,

extras of PS4 Pro, this could be a landmark visual experience as well as a 
compelling combat adventure.

The game that will see out the Wii U and welcome in the Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> Switch is an epic rethinking 
of the Zelda recipe with an open world, a full physics engine and an intriguing 
survival element. Link will have to find food, items and weapons to progress 
through Hyrule and defeat the latest incarnation of series antagonist Ganon. 
Zelda arguably ruled last year’s E3 and it could be the critical hit of 2017.

from Tarsier Studios, a Swedish developer better known for working with Media 
Molecule on the LittleBigPlanet games and Tearaway Unfolded. Little Nightmares 
is a puzzle platformer set in a horrible world, asking players to guide Six 
through an oversized underwater lair called The Maw. People are saying “Tim 
Burton-esque” but don’t let that put you off.

 Fighting monsters on a distant planet … Loot Rascals. Photograph: Hollow Ponds
A clever combination of roguelike and collectible card game, Loot Rascals has 
you fighting monsters on a distant planet, earning loot cards from defeated 
foes. The twist is, losing fights will see one of your cards being stolen and 
warped into another player’s game – if they choose to keep it, a hologram

There’s no guarantee this luscious side-scrolling adventure game, created by a 
collective of developers and artists, will be out this year, but we’re hopeful.

first they must spend their days searching the forest for valuable items to

Nidhogg 2 <http://nidhogggame.com/> (Messhof Games; PC/PS4)
 Frenzied fun … Nidhogg 2. Photograph: Messhof Games 
The original two-player sword-fighting game was a minimalist masterpiece, its 
sparse pixelated backdrops and pure fencing action providing a tense and 
exciting competition. The sequel amps up the graphical fidelity and combat 
options considerably, giving a new, almost cartoonish look. It’s been a 
controversial move, butthe trailer <https://youtu.be/dtbyuqgdCtQ> promises a 
whole heap off frenzied fun.
Release: TBC

Night in the Woods <http://www.nightinthewoods.com/> (Finji; PC/Mac/PS4)

 Smart and funny … Night in the Woods. Photograph: Finji 
College dropout Mae Borowski returns to the sleepy town she grew up in and 
finds a familiar collection of misfits, weirdos and old routines – but there is 
also something new hiding out there in the woods. This side-scrolling adventure 
is populated entirely by anthropomorphised animals, and the smart, funny 
dialogue makes it feel like Twin Peaks, Gilmore Girls and a really smart Pixar 
animation rolled into one interactive independent movie.
Release: February

Overland <http://overland-game.com/> (Finji; PC/Mac)


Another post-apocalyptic survival game, this time a turn-based strategy set in 
the aftermath of an alien invasion. Players must manage small groups of 
survivors as they travel across the country, looting burned out cars, fighting 
monsters and just keeping each other alive. The simple mechanics hide a 
tactically complex challenge filled with difficult decisions and horrible 
sacrifices. Incredibly engrossing.
