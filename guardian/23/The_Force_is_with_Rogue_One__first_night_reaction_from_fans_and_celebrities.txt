Actor Rainn Wilson described it as “AMAZING!!! Super fun & exciting”, while 
fellow actor Wil Wheaton wrote 
<https://twitter.com/wilw/status/807827014887452676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: “The 
last time I loved a Star Wars movie as much as I loved #RogueOne, it was 1977.” 
Film-maker Kevin Smith, a long-time Star Wars obsessive, was equally positive, 
tweeting that Rogue One “is unbelievably wonderful! ... An excellent chapter in 
the@starwars <https://twitter.com/starwars> Universe!”

Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Felicity Jones and Mads 
Mikkelsen, was conceived as the first in a string of “standalone” films, 
connected to but outside the main narrative of “Episode” films. (Star Wars 
Episode VIII, directed by Rian Johnson, is due for release in December 2017.) 
The next standalone, or “anthology” film is an as-yet untitled story about a 
young Han Solo, pencilled in for 2018.
