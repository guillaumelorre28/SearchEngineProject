Fans have long noted that Batman v Superman appeared to adopt the events of 
the controversial graphic novel A Death in the Family, in which the second 
Robin (Jason Todd) was killed off following a readers’ poll. It seems likely 
Todd’s death, or its aftermath, was featured in Zack Snyder’s film to help 
explain why the new Batman has – in the words of Jeremy Irons’ Alfred 
Pennyworth – “turned cruel”.

The Todd revelation also feeds into rumours about the storyline for Affleck’s 
forthcoming solo Batman movie, which the actor and film-maker is reported to be 
directing himself. Affleck is said to be using a story arc from Under the Hood 
in which Todd returns from the dead after being resurrected in one of Batman 
villain Ra’s al Ghul’s Lazarus Pits. He heads back to Gotham as a vigilante 
known as the Red Hood, whose violent methods bring him into contact with the 
dark knight.

There is also a part to play for the Joker in Under the Hood. JoBlo
