Capita shares continue to slide as analysts cut their recommendations following
the outsourcing group’s results last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/feb/25/ftse-jumps-nearly-2-after-wall-street-rally-but-capita-slides>
 and news that its chairman was stepping down.

It is down nearly 3% at £10.01, with Berenberg reducing its target price from 
£11.60 to £10.90 with a hold rating and Panmure Gordon repeating its sell 
advice.

Panmure analyst Michael Donnelly said:

The heavy fall in the share price post Capita’s prelims and the exit of its 
chairman [Martin Bolland], plus yet another change to segmental P&L and higher 
debt levels from public bond issues does not yet reflect the potentially 
significant new levels of risk in the business. Free cash flow growth at around 
4% compound annual growth rate is not enough for us. Keep selling. We cut our 
target price to 900p (12.2 times PE) from 1000p on higher net debt and lower 
free cash flow.

[We have] concerns on goodwill, growth, cash and quality of earnings.

Donnelly said he also expected more impairment charges after Capita 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/capitagroup> announced £105m from two 
divisions. Meanwhile Berenberg said:

Capita’s 2015 results were largely in line with expectations, driven by 4% 
organic growth and a 20 basis point underlying margin expansion (up 40 basis 
points including disposals). While management guides for “at least” the same 
level of organic expansion in 2016, the company has its work cut out, 
considering it currently has visibility on only one quarter of that growth. 
With returns and free cash flow generation likely to decline further in 2016 
following the contraction in 2015, we maintain our hold recommendation.
