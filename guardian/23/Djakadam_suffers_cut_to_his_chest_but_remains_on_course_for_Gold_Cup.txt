it’s a flesh wound and he’ll be fine. That’s the best news of the day.” 
Djakadam drifted slightly in the ante-post market after his fall, as his 
stablemate Vautour, also owned by Ricci, moved to the top of the betting at 
9-2. Djakadam is now a 6-1 chance, while Gordon Elliott’s Don Cossack splits 
the two Willie Mullins-trained runners at 5-1.
