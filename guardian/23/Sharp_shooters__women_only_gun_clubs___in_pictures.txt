The most famous sharpshooter in American history happens to be a woman. Born 
in 1860, Annie Oakley, the headline star of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show, 
became a legend in her own lifetime, and an even bigger one after it. She could 
handle any pistol or two-barrelled rifle “better than any man”, and the public 
warmed to the plucky spirit of Little Miss Sure Shot.

Carrin from Austin: ‘Shooting is a question of adrenaline’. 
Oakley’s appeal endures to this day, yet, next to abortion rights, there is no 
more polarising issue facing the US than its gun laws. Despite the country’s 
nearly 12,000 gun homicides a year and the alarming increase in mass shootings 
in the past eight years, the second amendment remains close to many Americans’ 
hearts.

Monday is ladies’ day. 
Last year a New York Times/CBS poll found that the number of Americans 
supporting a ban is 19 points lower today than it was after the shooting of 
congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011. Alongside that alarming statistic, 
the NRA claims that 23% of American women – the gun lobby’s new targets – are 
now armed.

 A weekly women-only shooting session in Austin, Texas. 
Manufacturers are adapting to this by selling their weapons as if they were 
designer phone cases or fashionable handbags; there may be a gender rebalance 
in ownership, but that doesn’t mean that traditional notions of femininity are 
being compromised. Just as Oakley traded on her femininity, wearing her hair 
long beneath a 10-gallon hat, so women today in the southern belt seem to be 
enjoying the spectacle of being seen as both feminine and an expert shooter. 
Customised rifles in lavender or frosted pink, and prettily decorated holsters, 
are a common sight.

 Gun club members own several automatic pistols and assault rifles. 
In Moland Fengkov’s photographs from Texan gun clubs, women are pictured 
posing with their AKs like trophy hunters of old. One woman stares defiantly 
out at the viewer, looking as if she might belong to a group of survivalists. 
Wearing short pants, she’s kneeling, one cowboy boot planted firmly on the soft 
carpet. She looks tough, ready to make America great again, yet the 
artificiality of the moment can’t be avoided – this is hardly a scene of armed 
combat.

Kaitlyn, 25, from Austin, owns 18 guns. 
Contrast it with the image of the woman whose auburn hair is blowing across 
her face. Holding her pink pistol rather daintily in her fingers, she looks as 
if she might be posing on the QVC channel. Despite the Live Love Shoot motto on 
her T-shirt, the pistol looks little more than an accessory.

It’s not just an increase in the number of young women that are training at 
shooting ranges – children are coming, encouraged by their parents. To make the 
experience more “child-friendly” (children as young as four are welcome at some 
ranges), you’ll find cute gun holders and belts – naturally, it’s pink for 
girls.

A child shoots a pink automatic rifle at the Best of the West range, Austin, 
Texas. 
One child, of about 10, looks like she might be posing for her communion 
photo, except that she’s proudly holding a pink rifle and wearing pink ear 
protectors and dark goggles. One finger, frosted-blue nail varnish visible, 
points toward the trigger, yet nothing about this picture feels quite real. The 
weapon is made to look as unthreatening as possible. The girl looks as if she’s 
posing for a formal rite-of-passage: she’s smiling but not quite relaxed, proud 
but clearly self-conscious. That smile could be glued on. Some things change, 
and some things just never do.
