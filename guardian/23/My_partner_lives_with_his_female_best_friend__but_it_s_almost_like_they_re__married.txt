We have been going out for six months, we live in different places and see 
each other every few weeks. He lives with his female best friend and doesn’t 
seem to have many others. She is a recovering alcoholic, and he has been 
through AA and is now teetotal. Their lives are so entangled it’s like they are 
married: they share a computer, home and vehicle; she is estranged from her 
family and has been “adopted” by his; she chooses his clothes etc. He assures 
me they are just friends, but she blatantly attempts clumsy sexual manipulation 
by walking around naked.

She is massively territorial, and I have only stayed in his house once when 
she was there. The atmosphere was horrendous and I left. I believe they are 
hugely codependent (as do family and the few friends he has left), but he can’t 
see it and is very defensive of her. I really like him and thought we had 
something, but it seems he’ll never be free from her. It may sound as if we are 
teenagers, but we are in our mid-40s.
