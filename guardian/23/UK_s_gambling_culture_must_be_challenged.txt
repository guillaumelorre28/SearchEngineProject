Hugh Muir (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/15/brightest-lights-bookies-community-trouble-problem-gambling>
, 16 December) provides comprehensive evidence of how gambling can have a 
devastating impact on individuals, their families and communities. All too 
often, the poor and disadvantaged fall victim to addiction, with easy-to-use 
fixed odds terminals and internet sites compounding an age-old problem. Given 
the perils of gambling addiction, it is inexcusable that government allows the 
cheeky cockney/bit of a laugh advertising that surrounds sports events and 
sports stars and is distanced from the grim reality. Banning sports advertising 
would be a start.

Cultural acceptance should be challenged. The National Lottery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lottery> is a scandal. While many of its causes 
are noble, its methods are not. Scratch cards, tacky TV and sensational 
jackpots are as bad as fixed-odds terminals. The most money is contributed by 
those least able to afford it. It is, in effect, a regressive tax which funds 
causes across sport and the arts and provides an introduction to gambling for 
thousands. Scrapping the lottery and funding indispensable projects through 
general taxation would be advisable.
