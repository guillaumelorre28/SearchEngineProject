destination career? Can people from any background flourish in the media 
sector? What needs to be done to improve diversity and ensure the future of the 
industry?

can combat it.

12.05 - 12.30 10 media trends for 2017 and beyond

We talk a lot about change in advertising, but maybe we’ve seen nothing yet.

We talk about the digital world as if it’s new, but it’s been 10 years since 
the iPhone and we’re still yet to get to grips with what’s really possible.

From banner ads to pre-rolls, eCommerce sites to social, we’re recycling the 
units of the past and we can do better if we think ambitiously, creatively and 
boldly.

In order to do this, Tom will take us on a 25 min provocation he’s delivered 
around the world, to explore some of the themes, changes, challenges and 
opportunities that we’re in the middle of. Tom will explore 10 themes that 
capture the spirit of the modern world, the threats and the opportunities.
