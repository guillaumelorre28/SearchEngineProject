Bored, the Baron mooched in his Manor 
on the brink of belligerence. Life lacked glamour 
and Christmas was coming. The Baroness, 
past her best, oozed ennui, stitched away 
at a tapestry. The old Retainer polished brass. 
The Baron felt like kicking his arse.

Outside the leaded window – snow, 
snow on snow; the ground an inkless folio. 
What to do to enliven life? To put some fizz 
on the viz of the wife? Even the hounds, 
in a stupor, snored. The son and heir, 
party-pooper, piously prone in prayer, as per.

What would the King do? London’s Mayor?
Gentry, clergy, artisans, serfs, would soon pitch up
on the Baron’s turf; but a gloomy grey, smokey, snide,
drifted, semi-paralysed. The Baron cursed.
Then the Baroness looked up from her crewel,
murmured, “Appoint a Lord of Misrule”.

Apprentices were poked from straw, lined up,
scratching, in the Hall; alongside yeomen,
glovers, weavers, smiths, brewers, cordwainers ...

A cake with a buried bean was baked
and he who bit on the bean was booked
as King of Christmas, whose writ ran good.

 ‘Willie Spear, anarchic fellow, in pantaloons
of violent yellow’… Photograph: Picador 
Now Willie Spear, anarchic fellow, in pantaloons
of violent yellow, had done his share of poaching,
wenching, any villainy you care to mention ...
and he stuck his tongue – bean-gleam, drool – 
in the Baron’s face. “All bow! All kneel! My Lord’s a fool!
Twelve days and nights I am Lord of Misrule!”

On the first day of Christmas, William decreed
all labouring men were to lie abed. Wives instead
must enter taverns, mimic slatterns, carouse,
booze, shriek, stagger home, skirts in pleats.
This also applied to the Baroness, who spent
six sick sessions in the same silk dress.

No school for the young. No traitors hung. 
No work to be done. No churchbells rung. 
Priests were attired in petticoats, pretty ribbons 
at their throats. A monkey, dressed in a silver suit, 
was served at table in the Baron’s seat. Servants walked 
upon their hands. And all night long, the pissed Band.

Then William sent out far and wide
to scour the snowy countryside for poets, astrologers,
fools, magicians; gave them all Official Positions,
gorgeous robes, coin-plump purses; commissioned
rude and filthy verses; made No-marks famous; 
had the Baron’s horoscope cast beneath Uranus.

The Baronial pile was a transformed place. Crazy 
candlelight on painted face. The son and heir, 
finger-stocked to purge prayer, was squeezed, snogged, 
by each lass there. The Baroness, who’d taken to mead, 
was ordered to wait on her own maid – quid pro quo. 
Outside, twelve glovers made a moon of snow.

 ‘A monkey, dressed in a silver suit, was served at table in the Baron’s seat’ 
… Photograph: Picador 
Regaled by this frenzied Bacchanalia, oxter-deep
in a barrel of ale, the Baron mused.
Up on the flagpole, Will Spear’s leggings
kicked at Heaven. On the frozen moat
children skated. In his very own chair, a mangy monkey
masticated. The odds were even, evens odd. Dear God ...

The Bishop’s bottom was being used for Bullseye.
All was mockery, sorcery, debauchery,
anarchy, larceny ... and yet, the party
had a Yuletide sparkle: every fruit, wrapped 
in tinsel; plump geese roasting; marzipan mangers;
everywhere, angels, baubles, candles.

Will Spear, too, surveyed the scene, serene
in the pose of a natural leader, enthroned
on the back of a docile donkey, who chomped hay
from the palm of the monkey. Twelfth Night drew near.
Will ordered everyone there to bed; to return by morn
with a sober head. “Prepare for the final feast,” he said.

Silence fell. Subtle snow. In the arms of a girl, freed
from his stocks, the son and heir smiled in his sleep.
Baron and Baroness, ditto, blotto; a jumbly, fumbly,
marital heap. Masters and servants topped-and-tailed.

 ‘The moon shone down on it’s own cold twin’ … Photograph: Picador 
Then the snow ceased and the Moon shone down
on its own cold twin, alone on the lawn.

There never was such a spread as Spear supplied,
so legend has it. All day he had them baking,
basting, battering, blanching, boiling, broiling,
carmelizing, chopping, creaming, dicing,
drizzling, filleting, glazing, grating,
grilling, grinding, kneading, mincing, mixing,

peeling, pickling, poaching, rendering, roasting,
scalding, searing, simmering, tossing, trussing,
whipping, till the ancient table groaned and creaked
like the fallen oak of its sylvan past. Then a blast
from a trumpet, each glass filled; the banquet started
at a prompt from the Lord of Misrule. He farted.

And the Baron would remember his laughing wife; 
the son and heir marry the love of his life – Amen – 
the priest lead everyone across the fields, 
when the feast was finished, to church, to kneel, 
give thanks, while a boy and a monkey swang 
from the bell. And so passed Willie Spear’s Noël.
