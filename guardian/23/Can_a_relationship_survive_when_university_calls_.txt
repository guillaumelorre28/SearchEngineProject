Life’s big decisions don’t always come easy. And matters of the heart can play 
heavy when it comes to choosing a university. Having struck up a relationship 
in the sixth form, it’s not surprising some students are hesitant to break ties 
and head in different directions.

For parents, there’s also a fine line between head and heart. Jan Waller, from 
Birmingham, wanted her son to be happy, but thought his travelling home every 
weekend would impede his studies. “Jim was having doubts about his 
relationship,” she says, “but it was important he made up his own mind, so 
although I stayed supportive and talked the situation through with him, I tried 
hard not to tell him what to do. In the end they agreed to part and see how it 
goes. That seemed to satisfy them both. They can always get back together if 
things are meant to be.”

Although many relationships have foundered due to the distance and lack of 
contact, others have stood the test of time. Claire Bentley, from Watford, got 
together with her boyfriend two months before she went to the University of 
Winchester: “He was going to Sheffield, so we thought maybe it was best to take 
a break. But we carried on talking, and a few weeks after freshers’ week we 
decided we could make it work, even though there’s a four and a half hour train 
journey between us.

later we decided we could make it work

“We see each other every four to five weeks and it can be quite expensive. 
Getting the balance right between seeing each other and lecture time, courses 
and assignments is tricky. We both decided to put our work first and take our 
laptops so we can work when we see each other.

“Most of my friends have broken up and wonder how we do it. And although it 
has been hard, the time goes quickly. My parents thought as long as I was 
happy, they were fine, so they never interfered.”

There’s no right or wrong answer, but the general advice is, if you start to 
feel the strain, make sure you talk to someone and don’t wait until the 
situation gets out of hand. If you’re missing someone, feeling homesick, 
anxious, or have work concerns, there are people on campus who can help.

Like many universities, Nottingham provides a specialist and confidential 
counselling service, accessible by anyone registered there. This can be in the 
form of workshops, group sessions, or individual counselling for personal and 
psychological problems.

Concerned parents can phone for general advice, although counsellors are 
unable to divulge any information about individual students. Friends are also 
encouraged to speak up. The University of Nottingham said: “If you are worried 
about a friend, one of the counsellors can talk to you about the situation and 
perhaps suggest where your friend may best obtain help.”

A simple online form can be filled out to make an appointment. Counselling 
does not affect your academic record, so don’t suffer in silence.

Lucy Bennett, 19, from Rotherham, split up with her boyfriend before going to 
university to study pharmacy. “I knew it would be an issue, as it’s a four-hour 
journey between us by train. I’m quite independent and it was something I 
needed to do.

“I am glad I don’t have the pressure of going home every weekend, and I’ve 
been able to use that time to make new friends and meet new people.

“It was daunting, as I didn’t know what was going to happen, but it’s nice to 
be my own person while I’m at uni, and do what I like for a while.

“We’re still friends and on speaking terms and it’s completely fine. My mum 
and dad were really good about it. They said: ‘You’ve had good times together 
and you’ll both be OK.’”

“Coming back to university after Christmas was difficult because I got used to 
home comforts, so now I text message my parents most days and Facetime once or 
twice a week. And occasionally they come to see me and make a weekend of it.

“They have always said go after what you want, meet new people and try new 
things, and during exams, Dad said: ‘Just try your best; that’s all you can 
do.’ If there are any problems, he said he’d come straight down.”
