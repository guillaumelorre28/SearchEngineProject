A Tory MP has resigned as a ministerial aide following allegations reportedly 
made by a Brazilian male escort.

Mark Menzies quit as a parliamentary private secretary to international 
development minister Alan Duncan following aSunday Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sundaymirror> investigation into his 
personal life.

In a statement the Fylde MP said: "I have decided to resign as a PPS after a 
series of allegations were made against me in a Sunday newspaper.

"A number of these allegations are not true and I look forward to setting the 
record straight in due course."

Fylde Conservative association chairman councillor Brenda Ackers said: "Mark 
has the full support of his constituency party."

Menzies was elected in 2010 and was swiftly promoted to be a ministerial aide, 
serving former energy minister Charles Hendry and former housing minister Mark 
Prisk before his role with Duncan.

He grew up in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, and was raised by his mother after his 
father died a month before he was born.

Menzies, 42, studied economics and social history at Glasgow University before 
embarking on a career in retail, starting out at Marks & Spencer as a graduate 
trainee.
