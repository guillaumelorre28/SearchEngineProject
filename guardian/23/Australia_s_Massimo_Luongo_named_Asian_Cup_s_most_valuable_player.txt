Massimo Luongo was named the most valuable player at the 2015 Asian Cup after 
scoring the opening goal forAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> in Saturday’s final against 
South Korea at Sydney’s Olympic Stadium.

 The 22-year-old midfielder capped a brilliant performance throughout the 
tournament when he scored in the 45th minute, blasting the ball home from 25 
yards out.

 Australia went on to win the match 2-1 after extra-time after Son Heung-min 
equalised for South Korea in stoppage time then James Troisi put the host 
nation back in front during extra-time.

 Luongo, who plays for Swindon Town, made his international debut last year 
and was picked in the Australian squad for the World Cup but didn’t play a 
match.

 But Luongo has since established himself as one of Australia’s most promising 
young players and forced his way into the starting line-up.

 He scored a goal and was named man of the match in Australia’s opening game 
at the Asian Cup against Kuwait and picked up the same award in the semi-final 
win over United Arab Emirates.

Mat Ryan was the goalkeeper of tournament with United Arab Emirates’ striker 
Ali Mabkhout taking the golden boot award for the cup’s leading scorer, with a 
total of five goals.


 Defender Trent Sainsbury picked up the man-of-the-match award in the final 
but one blot on the Socceroos’ copybook was the loss of luckless Robbie Kruse 
to injury.

 Kruse, after missing last year’s World Cup because of a knee reconstruction, 
crumpled without contact in the 66th minute with what appeared a serious left 
Achilles injury. He was stretchered off, in tears.
