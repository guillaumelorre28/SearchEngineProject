Exhibition of the Week

Turner prize
Is the prize that once had the nation arguing about winners like Rachel 
Whiteread andDamien Hirst <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/damienhirst>
 still an important event? Last year was bad enough to revive arguments from 
some that it has had its day. Yet often when the Turner is in trouble, it 
suddenly produces a vintage year. This year’s shortlisted artists are Assemble, 
Bonnie Camplin, Janice Kerbel and Nicole Wermers – and it’s in Glasgow, home to 
so much of Britain’s best contemporary art.

 * At Tramway <http://www.tramway.org/Pages/home.aspx>, Glasgow, from 1 
October until 17 January.

 Throne of Weapons … the real-life Iron Throne. Photograph: British Museum 
This eerie chair made from AK47 rifles and other scary weapons of modern war 
has become one of the British Museum’s most famous treasures. It also appears 
to be the inspiration for the Iron Throne in HBO drama Game of Thrones, which 
is made from melted swords. Kester used guns decommissioned after the end of 
Mozambique’s civil war in 1992. It is a seat of hope as well as an enthroned 
memory of war.


 * At the British Museum
