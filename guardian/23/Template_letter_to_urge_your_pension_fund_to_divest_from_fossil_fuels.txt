Dear

I am concerned about the real threat posed by climate change, and believe it 
is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to 
finding and burning more oil, gas and coal.
As the trustee/investment manager of my pension fund, I would appreciate it if 
you could provide some answers and guidance on this issue.

• How much of the pension fund is invested in companies involved in the 
extraction of fossil fuels?

• What options, if any, do I have to ensure my pension fund money is not 
invested in fossil fuel companies?


• If there are no current fossil fuel-free options, will you seek to offer 
members an option in future? I note that several organisations, such as FTSE 
and MSCI, already offer indices which exclude fossil fuels.

• Will the pension scheme commit to moving our investments out of fossil 
fuels? I would like the fund to commit to divesting from the top 200 fossil 
fuel companies within five years and to immediately stop any new investments in 
those companies. I am concerned about the financial risks of investing in 
fossil fuel companies which are likely to be forced to leave their existing 
reserves in the ground. Indeed, I see that in recent years pension funds that 
have divested from fossil fuels have financially outperformed those that remain 
invested in fossil fuels.


• If the pension fund will not commit to divestment, will it consider reducing 
the carbon exposure of the fund?


• Are there any plans to increase investment by the pension fund to help 
facilitate a low carbon economy?


I look forward to hearing from you.
