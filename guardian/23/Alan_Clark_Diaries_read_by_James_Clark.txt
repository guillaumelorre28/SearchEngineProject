Ion Trewin, the editor of these diaries from 1972-82, has selected only 20 per 
cent of Alan Clark's words, and the audio version contains even fewer. 
Inevitably we wonder what was in the remaining 80 per cent - even more 
narcissistic self-indulgence in the deepening lines in his face, his bad back 
or his losing copious amounts of money through addiction to backgammon? Or did 
Trewin think it wise to suppress much of Clark's most distasteful aspect - his 
sympathy for the Nazis and the National Front?

Whatever was cut, there's still plenty to illustrate Clark's overweening 
vanity, his self-obsession - and his deeply uncharitable opinions of colleagues 
and, more disturbingly, of ordinary people: Norman Fowler always looked 'so 
common'; the people in Blackpool are 'vulgar, common primitives'. However, a 
diarist doesn't have to be charming or likable to be interesting.

In these early diaries, Clark is on the periphery of politics, and there are 
fewer of the political insights which made the first volume so rewarding, but 
hearing his elder son read them gives the whole a human dimension.
