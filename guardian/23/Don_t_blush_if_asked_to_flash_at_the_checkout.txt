It is to be hoped that Mark Koziol (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/12/new-boots-boss-offers-chance-to-change>
, 13 June) is right in his assessment that management changes at Boots may 
herald a change in business culture. But there are serious concerns about the 
future of pharmacies in the light of government plans to radically change the 
service and substantially reduce their number. Boots is not the only large 
company operating in this field, and the government should ensure that 
customers have a choice of provider wherever possible and that independent 
pharmacies continue to play a significant role in this key personal service.

• The money that Tom Mahoney and his employer contributed towards his firm’s 
pension (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/07/right-up-your-drang-jitty-or-vennel>
, 8 June) is ringfenced, but on its own this was never going to produce more 
than a quarter of his pension. The remaining three-quarters was expected to 
come from investment earnings on the accumulated fund. In the aftermath of the 
financial crisis, investment returns have failed to match expectations and it 
is this, plus pensioners living longer, that has led to the holes in pension 
funds.

• Rather than being converted to the side of the angels (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-business-ethics-decency-needed>
, 13 June), is it not more likely that your reported ever-increasing number of 
Conservatives calling for Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood are 
doing so because it was bestowed by Tony Blair?

• A verb to mean to “use a contactless card” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2016/jun/12/jigger-rabbits-and-other-alley-cats>
, 13 June)? How about “to flash”? The reaction of the customer when asked at 
the checkout if he or she wants to flash, however, might be a cause for concern.
