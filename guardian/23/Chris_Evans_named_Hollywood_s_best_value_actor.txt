non-animated films before June 2016 and working out which paycheck resulted in 
the most profitability when compared to box office.


In second place is Chris Pratt, still deemed good value after relatively 
low-paid roles in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. His next film, 
the $120m sci-fi drama Passengers, sees him star alongsideJennifer Lawrence

test of his box office appeal.

a strong female showing with four women. The highest placed isScarlett Johansson

Aniston and Jennifer Lawrence are all also included.
