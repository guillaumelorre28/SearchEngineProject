Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/oscar-pistorius> has been transferred to a 
jail adapted for disabled prisoners to serve the rest of his sentence for 
murdering his girlfriend, a South African official has said.

The Department of Correctional Services said the double amputee was moved from 
Kgosi Mampuru II prison in the capital Pretoria to Attridgeville correctional 
centre, just outside the city.

“The transfer was in line with his special needs,” department spokesman 
Singabakho Nxumalo told Agence France-Presse. “The new prison caters for people 
with special needs: it has been revamped to include facilities like bath tubs.”

The smaller facility holds convicts serving sentences of up to six years.

In July, Pistorius, 29, was given a six-year jail term

 after an appeals court upgraded his manslaughter conviction to murder.

He had earlier been given a five-year jail term and released on bail

 after one year.

Prosecutors are still trying to lengthen his sentence, which they have 
described as 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/south-african-prosecutors-attempt-to-appeal-oscar-pistorius-sentence-rejected>
 “shockingly lenient and disturbingly inappropriate”.

The Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp, a model and law graduate, in the early 
hours of Valentine’s Day 2013. He has always maintained that he mistook her for 
an intruder.

He fired four high-calibre bullets through a locked toilet cubicle inside his 
upmarket home in Pretoria, killing Steenkamp.
