Avram Grant says the Iranian side Sepahan Isfahan have pulled out of a 
friendly with hisPartizan Belgrade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/partizanbelgrade> side because he is 
Israeli.

Partizan had been due to play the Iranians this Friday in Antalya, but have 
been informed their opponents will not take part any more.

In an explanation posted on Partizan's official website, the former Chelsea, 
Portsmouth and West Ham United manager said he had been told "unofficially" 
that the match had been cancelled because he was Israeli, and called the 
decision "shameful".

"I never mixed politics with sports," he said. "I had worked with many 
[Muslims] while I was in England, and I made friends with many of them."

Partizan say they had to switch their usual winter preparations from Dubai to 
Antalya because of Grant's Israeli citizenship.
