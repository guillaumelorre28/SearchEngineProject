Closing summary: Draghi, Opec and OECD dominate the day

Time for a recap.

1) ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged the UK government to provide clarity on 
its plans to exit the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd#block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd>
. Draghi believes it’s currently impossible to say what impact Brexit will have 
on the City, or the rest of Europe, due to the lack of information from London.

He told the European Parliament that:

We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share 
its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, 
before we can actually express our views on this.

2) Draghi also warned that Britain would suffer most from a hard break from 
the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c5483e4b0da4920d6d341#block-583c5483e4b0da4920d6d341>
:

If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, 
migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a 
negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and 
potential output

“Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.”

3) The oil price has jumped, on hopes that Opec will hammer out the details of 
a plan to cut output at their meeting in Vienna this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c26fbe4b0da4920d6d28f#block-583c26fbe4b0da4920d6d28f>
.

Iraq’s oil minister, Jabar Ali al-Luaibi, dodged a broken vase to tell eager 
reporters that:

“We are optimistic. We hope we (will) have agreement. We will cooperate with 
OPEC members to reach agreement acceptable to all.”

But some experts aren’t convinced that the cartel can put its recent tensions 
behind;will Iraq and Iran really commit to production curbs, or just ‘freeze’ 
their current levels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c1675e4b0da4920d6d239#block-583c1675e4b0da4920d6d239>
?

Saudi Arabia has taken a tough line this week, cancelling a meeting with 
Russia and suggesting that output curbs aren’t essential. Analysts believe it’s 
all part of a negotiating strategy to get Iran and Iraq, among others, onside.

Brent crude is now up 2.6% at $48.49, ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting. But 
more volatility is expected, as ministers and reporters congregate in a chilly 
Vienna.

4) The OECD has predicted that the global economy could benefit from Donald 
Trump. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c03bde4b0e0ad2d75df7f#block-583c03bde4b0e0ad2d75df7f>

The Paris-based thinktank raised its growth forecasts, and suggested that 
Trump’s plans for higher government spending and a huge infrastructure project 
could help world growth.

But it also warned that protectionism could hold back world trade.

5) European stock markets have closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 dropping 
by 40 points or 0.6%.

Retail stocks were among the fallers, with Next losing 2.6% and Burberry down 
1.9%.

Chris Beauchamp of IG says:

 Retailers seem to have a bad case of the ‘Cyber Monday blues’, following from 
a Black Friday that didn’t even try to live up to the hype. Could it be that, 
having shopped for Britain in the wake of Brexit, UK consumers are now reining 
in their spending?

The French and German markets both shed around 1%, while Italy lost 1.8% as 
fears grow over Sunday’s constitutional referendum.

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW

Paresh Davdra, CEO of City firm RationalFX, says Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> may be losing patience with 
politicians....after years of propping up economic growth:

He writes:

“ECB President Draghi’s speech this afternoon before MEPs saw him stress the 
importance of reform in the governance of the Eurozone. Whilst maintaining that 
ECB stimulus has helped recovery in the Eurozone, his call for greater input 
from policymakers to help growth will likely reignite the debate over the role 
of central banks in both the EU and the UK. With a decision on further QE on 
the agenda for early next week, there is a good chance his warning is in 
reference to the uncertainty that the Italian Referendum and the French and 
German elections will bring in the new year.

Draghi’s comments likely reflect a frustration that BoE governor Mark Carney 
will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfill certain roles 
that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable. 
Draghi‘s comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, inhis call for Prime 
Minister Theresa May to share more about the Brexit strategy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd#block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd>
 days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the 
case of ‘hard Brexit’. Whilst it is likely that further uncertainty awaits the 
Eurozone’s economy before the end of the year, markets will be watching to see 
if Draghi’s wish for more than just stimulus measures to help boost the 
Eurozone will be answered.”

Bank of England: Umbrellas don't cause rain, we don't cause disinflation
 Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP/Getty Images 
Newsflash: One of the Bank of England’s policymakers is defending the central 
bank against criticism of its loose monetary policy.

Gertjan Vlieghe is telling an audience in Sheffield University that UK 
interest rates are at record lows because the global economy is facing 
disinflationary forces. Not the other way round.

Vlieghe takes a weather analogy:

“It has been raining, so we have all opened our umbrellas”.

He’s not convinced by critics who argue that low rates are causing economic 
woes...

“Umbrellas together with rainfall are observed in many countries. Nobody 
actually believes that umbrellas cause rainfall”.

And he also points out that central banks which raised interest rates since 
the financial crisis ended up having to cut them again (such as the European 
Central Bank).

 “We have had several low interest rate, low inflation countries that have 
raised interest rates over the past decade. This was not followed by an escape 
from the alleged confidence trap”.

“Higher interest rates, far from boosting demand and inflation, have caused 
growth to slow and inflation to fall”.

“Some of these countries now have even lower short term and long term interest 
rates than the UK, as inflation expectations have drifted lower”.

Vlieghe also takes a pop at those who say savers are suffering from low 
interest rates - pointing out that savers often own the kind of assets whose 
value has been pushed by by loose monetary policy.

not be asked to try." not that it's hurting pensioners anyway

Bloomberg have a good take on Mario Draghi’s comments about Brexit. Here’s a 
flavour:

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> warned that Britain’s 
economy would be the first to suffer if its decision to leave the European 
Union leads to protectionist measures.

“If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, 
migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a 
negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and 
potential output,” Draghi said in testimony to European Parliament lawmakers in 
Brussels on Monday. “Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the 
U.K. economy.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May says that by March she’ll formally announce 
Britain’s intention to leave the EU, triggering at least two years of 
potentially contentious talks between Brussels and London. Her government could 
be forced to choose between remaining in the EU single market and regaining 
control over immigration.

Now a question for Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> about this Sunday’s 
constitutional referendum in Italy.

Q: Could a country leave the euro against its own wishes, as a result of a 
referendum? And are eight Italian banks at risk, as reported in the UK and 
Italy, if the No campaign wins?

Draghi declines to answer, and won’t speculate about either question.

Q: But we have a business newspaper (the Financial Times) saying Italy could 
leave the euro following this referendum. Surely you have a view?

I’m not going to comment on other people’s comments, on other people’s 
articles, Draghi insists.

[I think they’re talking about Wolfgang Münchau’s column, last Monday. It 
argued that investors might lose faith in Italy if prime minister Matteo Renzi 
loses his bid to reform the Italian senate, and resigns

Another question about Donald Trump, this time about his infrastructure 
spending plan....

Q: If the German government came up with a similar infrastructure plan in 
2017, after the next federal elections, would it get the ringing endorsement of 
the ECB?

Draghi says that public investment has fallen in the last 15 years. Increasing 
public investment has benefits, and can create higher potential outlook if it 
is well-targeted.

In the past, some public investment was simply wasted, Draghi adds -- so any 
infrastructure spending plan has to be well-designed to boost growth.

Draghi: Trump shouldn't undermine the Fed

Q: Are you worried that Donald Trump might replace Janet Yellen as head of the 
US Federal Reserve?

Draghi says he’s not privy to Trump’s thinking with respect to the Fed. But he 
suggests the president-elect should tread carefully:

Undermining independence of central banks is not in anyone’s interests, 
especially those in the jurisdiction of the central bank.

During the election campaign, Trump criticised the Fed for keeping interest 
rates too low, and suggested he’d replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018.

Another MEP asks Draghi for his views on the fiscal plans announced by 
chancellor Philip Hammond last week (which included £122bn of fresh borrowing, 
and new spending on infrastructure).

Draghi says he doesn’t have enough knowledge to assess the impact of Hammond’s 
plan on the eurozone.

But any impact will inevitably be contained within the UK, given the 
difference in size between Britain and the eurozone.

Draghi: Britain must share Brexit plan with its own citizens

Mario Draghi has urged Theresa May to give British citizens more information 
about her plans for Britain’s exit from the EU.


The European Central Bank president told MEPs in Brussels that he’s still in 
the dark about Britain’s strategy.

Asked if Britain will lose its ‘passporting rights’ in the EU, or if jobs will 
be shed in the City, Draghi says the lack of clarity means he simply doesn’t 
know.

He tells the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee (livefeed 
<http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/ebs/live.cfm?page=1&lang=en>) that:

We don’t know.

And the reason we don’t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of 
the negotiations will be, and how long they will last.

It’s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty.

Draghi also tells MEPs that over recent years, the City of London has achieved 
“the highest economies of scale” for any financial services industry apart from 
New York.

Brexit puts all this up in the air, Draghi says:

Now, how will this change, We don’t know.

Will this be recreated somewhere else? We don’t know.

Would the considerable benefit that these economies of scale have created to 
the European Union, to the United Kingdom, be recreated elsewhere?

Or will there be a migration to the United States? We don’t know.

And the ECB chief concludes his answer by putting the ball firmly in the 
British government’s court:

We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share 
its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, 
before we can actually express our views on this.

Draghi’s comments come a day after it emerged that Bank of England governor 
Mark Carney is pushing for “transitional arrangements” to protect the City from 
a hard Brexit.

whether Britain should seek to retain membership of the single market during 
the Brexit process.

Draghi: Brexit mustn't damage the Single Market
 Photograph: EBS 
On Brexit, Draghi says that the eurozone has weathered the fallout from the UK 
referendum outcome with “encouraging resilience”.

But he cautions that the UK economy is expected to slow, as firms cut 
investment.

Draghi also refuses to allow Brexit to undermine the European single market, 

While the UK referendum did create uncertainty as far as the country’s 
participation in the Single Market is concerned, the Single Market cannot go 
backwards.

It is imperative that its integrity and the homogeneity of rules and their 
enforcement will be preserved. This also means we cannot take backward steps 
concerning the regulatory,supervisory and oversight framework for banks and 
financial market infrastructures, which has been enhanced considerably since 
2008.

Draghi: A half-built eurozone is fragile

Mario Draghi has urged European leaders not to abandon economic and monetary 
union as they wrestle with Europe’s new security challenges.

The head of the European Central Bank began his session in Brussels by telling 
MPs that the euro area economy is growing at “a moderate but steady pace” 
despite economic and political uncertainties.


And he warns that policymakers need to shore up the eurozone’s creaking 
foundations.

I am aware that the attention of our policymakers has shifted. In the direct 
aftermath of the financial crisis the need to complete Economic and Monetary 
Union came to the forefront of the European debate. Since then circumstances 
have changed. Today Europe’s focus is more on security.

Both projects require Europe to be united – to act together. However, let us 
not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong 
and resilient economy. And for that purpose, Economic and Monetary Union must 
overcome the vulnerabilities stemming from its incompleteness.

One important lesson from the crisis is that a half-built house is not stable, 
it is fragile.

Draghi also cites the recent Five Presidents’ report - which recommended 
closer fiscal union (tighter control of member states’ budgets by Brussels), 
and a Europe-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme

Time for a recap.

1) ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged the UK government to provide clarity on 
its plans to exit the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd#block-583c445be4b0da4920d6d2fd>
. Draghi believes it’s currently impossible to say what impact Brexit will have 
on the City, or the rest of Europe, due to the lack of information from London.

He told the European Parliament that:

We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share 
its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, 
before we can actually express our views on this.

2) Draghi also warned that Britain would suffer most from a hard break from 
the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c5483e4b0da4920d6d341#block-583c5483e4b0da4920d6d341>
:

If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, 
migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a 
negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and 
potential output

“Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.”

3) The oil price has jumped, on hopes that Opec will hammer out the details of 
a plan to cut output at their meeting in Vienna this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c26fbe4b0da4920d6d28f#block-583c26fbe4b0da4920d6d28f>
.

Iraq’s oil minister, Jabar Ali al-Luaibi, dodged a broken vase to tell eager 
reporters that:

“We are optimistic. We hope we (will) have agreement. We will cooperate with 
OPEC members to reach agreement acceptable to all.”

But some experts aren’t convinced that the cartel can put its recent tensions 
behind;will Iraq and Iran really commit to production curbs, or just ‘freeze’ 
their current levels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/28/oil-price-opec-saudi-arabia-oecd-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-583c1675e4b0da4920d6d239#block-583c1675e4b0da4920d6d239>
?

Saudi Arabia has taken a tough line this week, cancelling a meeting with 
Russia and suggesting that output curbs aren’t essential. Analysts believe it’s 
all part of a negotiating strategy to get Iran and Iraq, among others, onside.

Brent crude is now up 2.6% at $48.49, ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting. But 
more volatility is expected, as ministers and reporters congregate in a chilly 
Vienna.

4) The OECD has predicted that the global economy could benefit from Donald 
Trump.

The Paris-based thinktank raised its growth forecasts, and suggested that 
Trump’s plans for higher government spending and a huge infrastructure project 
could help world growth.

But it also warned that protectionism could hold back world trade.

5) European stock markets have closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 dropping 
by 40 points or 0.6%.

Retail stocks were among the fallers, with Next losing 2.6% and Burberry down 
1.9%.

Chris Beauchamp of IG says:

 Retailers seem to have a bad case of the ‘Cyber Monday blues’, following from 
a Black Friday that didn’t even try to live up to the hype. Could it be that, 
having shopped for Britain in the wake of Brexit, UK consumers are now reining 
in their spending?

The French and German markets both shed around 1%, while Italy lost 1.8% as 
fears grow over Sunday’s constitutional referendum.

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
Paresh Davdra, CEO of City firm RationalFX, says Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> may be losing patience with 
politicians....after years of propping up economic growth:

He writes:

“ECB President Draghi’s speech this afternoon before MEPs saw him stress the 
importance of reform in the governance of the Eurozone. Whilst maintaining that 
ECB stimulus has helped recovery in the Eurozone, his call for greater input 
from policymakers to help growth will likely reignite the debate over the role 
of central banks in both the EU and the UK. With a decision on further QE on 
the agenda for early next week, there is a good chance his warning is in 
reference to the uncertainty that the Italian Referendum and the French and 
German elections will bring in the new year.

Draghi’s comments likely reflect a frustration that BoE governor Mark Carney 
will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfill certain roles 
that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable.

Eurozone will be answered.”

Newsflash: One of the Bank of England’s policymakers is defending the central 
bank against criticism of its loose monetary policy.

Gertjan Vlieghe is telling an audience in Sheffield University that UK 
interest rates are at record lows because the global economy is facing 
disinflationary forces. Not the other way round.

Vlieghe takes a weather analogy:

“It has been raining, so we have all opened our umbrellas”.

He’s not convinced by critics who argue that low rates are causing economic 
woes...

“Umbrellas together with rainfall are observed in many countries. Nobody 
actually believes that umbrellas cause rainfall”.

And he also points out that central banks which raised interest rates since 
the financial crisis ended up having to cut them again (such as the European 
Central Bank).

 “We have had several low interest rate, low inflation countries that have 
raised interest rates over the past decade. This was not followed by an escape 
from the alleged confidence trap”.

“Higher interest rates, far from boosting demand and inflation, have caused 
growth to slow and inflation to fall”.

“Some of these countries now have even lower short term and long term interest 
rates than the UK, as inflation expectations have drifted lower”.

Vlieghe also takes a pop at those who say savers are suffering from low 
interest rates - pointing out that savers often own the kind of assets whose 
value has been pushed by by loose monetary policy.

Bloomberg have a good take on Mario Draghi’s comments about Brexit. Here’s a 
flavour:

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> warned that Britain’s 
economy would be the first to suffer if its decision to leave the European 
Union leads to protectionist measures.

“If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, 
migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a 
negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and 
potential output,” Draghi said in testimony to European Parliament lawmakers in 
Brussels on Monday. “Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the 
U.K. economy.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May says that by March she’ll formally announce 
Britain’s intention to leave the EU, triggering at least two years of 
potentially contentious talks between Brussels and London. Her government could 
be forced to choose between remaining in the EU single market and regaining 
control over immigration.

Now a question for Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> about this Sunday’s 
constitutional referendum in Italy.

Q: Could a country leave the euro against its own wishes, as a result of a 
referendum? And are eight Italian banks at risk, as reported in the UK and 
Italy, if the No campaign wins?

Draghi declines to answer, and won’t speculate about either question.

Q: But we have a business newspaper (the Financial Times) saying Italy could 
leave the euro following this referendum. Surely you have a view?

I’m not going to comment on other people’s comments, on other people’s 
articles, Draghi insists.

[I think they’re talking about Wolfgang Münchau’s column, last Monday. It 
argued that investors might lose faith in Italy if prime minister Matteo Renzi 
loses his bid to reform the Italian senate, and resigns 
<https://www.ft.com/content/7ea6837a-ad83-11e6-ba7d-76378e4fef24>.]
 
Another question about Donald Trump, this time about his infrastructure 
spending plan....

Q: If the German government came up with a similar infrastructure plan in 
2017, after the next federal elections, would it get the ringing endorsement of 
the ECB?

Draghi says that public investment has fallen in the last 15 years. Increasing 
public investment has benefits, and can create higher potential outlook if it 
is well-targeted.

In the past, some public investment was simply wasted, Draghi adds -- so any 
infrastructure spending plan has to be well-designed to boost growth.
 
Q: Are you worried that Donald Trump might replace Janet Yellen as head of the 
US Federal Reserve?

Draghi says he’s not privy to Trump’s thinking with respect to the Fed. But he 
suggests the president-elect should tread carefully:

Undermining independence of central banks is not in anyone’s interests, 
especially those in the jurisdiction of the central bank.

During the election campaign, Trump criticised the Fed for keeping interest 
rates too low, and suggested he’d replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018.
 
Another MEP asks Draghi for his views on the fiscal plans announced by 
chancellor Philip Hammond last week (which included £122bn of fresh borrowing, 
and new spending on infrastructure).

Draghi says he doesn’t have enough knowledge to assess the impact of Hammond’s 
plan on the eurozone.

But any impact will inevitably be contained within the UK, given the 
difference in size between Britain and the eurozone.

Mario Draghi has urged Theresa May to give British citizens more information 
about her plans for Britain’s exit from the EU.


The European Central Bank president told MEPs in Brussels that he’s still in 
the dark about Britain’s strategy.

Asked if Britain will lose its ‘passporting rights’ in the EU, or if jobs will 
be shed in the City, Draghi says the lack of clarity means he simply doesn’t 
know.

He tells the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee (livefeed 
<http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/ebs/live.cfm?page=1&lang=en>) that:

We don’t know.

And the reason we don’t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of 
the negotiations will be, and how long they will last.

It’s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty.

Draghi also tells MEPs that over recent years, the City of London has achieved 
“the highest economies of scale” for any financial services industry apart from 
New York.

Brexit puts all this up in the air, Draghi says:

Now, how will this change, We don’t know.

Will this be recreated somewhere else? We don’t know.

Would the considerable benefit that these economies of scale have created to 
the European Union, to the United Kingdom, be recreated elsewhere?

Or will there be a migration to the United States? We don’t know.

And the ECB chief concludes his answer by putting the ball firmly in the 
British government’s court:

We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share 
its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, 
before we can actually express our views on this.

Draghi’s comments come a day after it emerged that Bank of England governor 
Mark Carney is pushing for “transitional arrangements” to protect the City from 
a hard Brexit.

On Brexit, Draghi says that the eurozone has weathered the fallout from the UK 
referendum outcome with “encouraging resilience”.

But he cautions that the UK economy is expected to slow, as firms cut 
investment.

Draghi also refuses to allow Brexit to undermine the European single market, 

While the UK referendum did create uncertainty as far as the country’s 
participation in the Single Market is concerned, the Single Market cannot go 
backwards.

It is imperative that its integrity and the homogeneity of rules and their 
enforcement will be preserved. This also means we cannot take backward steps 
concerning the regulatory,supervisory and oversight framework for banks and 
financial market infrastructures, which has been enhanced considerably since 
2008.
 
Mario Draghi has urged European leaders not to abandon economic and monetary 
union as they wrestle with Europe’s new security challenges.

The head of the European Central Bank began his session in Brussels by telling 
MPs that the euro area economy is growing at “a moderate but steady pace” 
despite economic and political uncertainties.


And he warns that policymakers need to shore up the eurozone’s creaking 
foundations.

I am aware that the attention of our policymakers has shifted. In the direct 
aftermath of the financial crisis the need to complete Economic and Monetary 
Union came to the forefront of the European debate. Since then circumstances 
have changed. Today Europe’s focus is more on security.

Both projects require Europe to be united – to act together. However, let us 
not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong 
and resilient economy. And for that purpose, Economic and Monetary Union must 
overcome the vulnerabilities stemming from its incompleteness.

One important lesson from the crisis is that a half-built house is not stable, 
it is fragile.

Draghi also cites the recent Five Presidents’ report - which recommended 
closer fiscal union (tighter control of member states’ budgets by Brussels), 
and a Europe-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme
