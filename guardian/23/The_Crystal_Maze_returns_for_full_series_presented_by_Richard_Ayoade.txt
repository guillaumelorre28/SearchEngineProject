The Crystal Maze is to return to television for a full series with comedian 
and writerRichard Ayoade <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/richard-ayoade> 
taking on the maze master role made famous by Richard O’Brien.

Channel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> said it had 
commissioned 20 hour-long episodes to air later this year after the success of 
last year’s one-off celebrity special, adding that it was looking for members 
of the public to apply to compete in five-person teams. Filming will begin 
within the next few months, with broadcast likely to be towards the later part 
of the year.

The revived programme will follow the same format as the original, with 
contestants testing themselves against a range of mental and physical 
challenges in pursuit of the crystals that will buy them time in the crystal 
dome.

Channel 4’s head of live and events, Tom Beck, who commissioned the new series 
with the head of entertainment, Ed Havard, said the success of the celebrity 
special made the decision to order a full series “almost a no-brainer”.

He said: “I couldn’t be more pleased and excited that Richard has agreed to 
become the new Maze Master – he’s an inspired choice.”

“The great thing about the original was it felt like a world you were buying 
into. I think you need someone who feels like they could own, inhabit and 
create it and believe it. You don’t get that when you use a traditional 
presenter. Richard [O’Brien] and Stephen were both writers and actors and 
performers rather than presenters, as is Richard [Ayoade].”

James Dillon, the designer of the original show, is creating a 30,000 sq ft 
maze in Bristol featuring new versions of the show’s Aztec, industrial, future 
and medieval zones.

The Crystal Maze aired between 1990 and 1995, with O’Brien presenting the 
first four series before handing over to Edward Tudor-Pole for the final two. 
At one point, it was the most watched show on Channel 4, pulling in up to six 
million viewers.

Beck said the series had to keep the spirit of the original while also 
bringing in new elements to keep it fresh and avoid simply mining the past. 
“You have to think incredibly carefully before you bring these shows back. It’s 
important when you do these shows they need to be present tense. It will feel 
fresh.”

Last October’s one-off special was presented by Stephen Merchant, with Maureen 
Lipman as Mumsie. Former footballer Rio Ferdinand, radio presenter Sara Cox and 
comedian Josh Widdicombe were among the celebrities who took part.

The show raised money for Stand Up For Cancer and was watched by 4.3 million 
viewers, many of them in younger age brackets, which Beck said had helped 
encourage Channel 4 to go for a full series.

Last year, the Crystal Maze format was turned into a “live immersive 
experience” in London, which was used to film the charity special, and Beck 
said that the show would be looking for the kind of people who had “embraced 
that idea of going into another world for a few hours”.

He said: “The contestants are such an important part of the story they have to 
be people who you enjoy watching because they become characters in a way they 
don’t on other shows.”

The new series is being made by Fizz, the production company behind the ITV 
gameshow Tipping Point.

Neale Simpson, Fizz’s creative director, said: “We’re thrilled at the prospect 
of building a maze to the scale and cinematic spectacle of the original and our 
hope is to bring a new vision to the legendary time travelling adventure that 
will excite the next generation of viewers.”
