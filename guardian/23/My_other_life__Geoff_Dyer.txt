A couple of years ago, in India, I found myself staying in the same hotel as 
some of the tennis players who were competing in the Chennai Open. Nadal was 
there, apparently, but I didn't see him. In fact, I didn't see any players I 
recognised, but it was impossible not to envy the fit, tracksuit-clad, 
flipflop-wearing athletes crowded round the egg station every morning. How I 
longed to be one of them, to be ranked in, say, the top 250, just high enough 
to eke out a decent living, to stay in swanky hotels (bliss!) and get free 
rackets and balls, without the superhuman dedication required to be in the top 
20 - that must be the perfect life. (Ideally, I'd have been so far down the 
rankings as to be able to go on occasional alcoholic benders without radically 
compromising my pro lifestyle.)

There was an easy, herd-like camaraderie about the players. They had so much 
in common - tennis, suntans, obsessive hydration, massive carb intake. And it 
was hard to resist the suspicion that, in their (generally large) shoes, one 
would have to be suffering a variety of injuries not to take advantage of the 
numerous sexual opportunities that presumably come one's way on the tour.
