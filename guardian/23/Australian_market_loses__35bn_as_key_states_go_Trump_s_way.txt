Stunned investors sold down Australian stocks on Wednesday during a 
rollercoaster day during which market fortunes rose with early hopes of a win

morning trade.

Futures trading showed US markets are also poised to open lower, with the Dow 
Jones futures index 3.7% lower.

At the close of trade in Australia, Trump had secured 244 of the 270 electoral 
college votes needed to secure the presidency, well ahead of Clinton’s 215.

Bell Direct equities analyst Julia Lee said markets didn’t like uncertainty 
and Trump was seen as an unknown quantity.

“Hillary Clinton is seen as a known candidate, the markets are familiar with 
her while with Donald Trump, there’s a perception he makes policies on the go,” 
Lee said.

All sectors on the ASX closed deep in the red, with the banks, health and 
energy sectors suffering the biggest declines.
