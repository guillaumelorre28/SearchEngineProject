Digital intermediaries such as Google and Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> are not only amassing 
eye-watering profits and paying minimal tax in the UK, they are also bleeding 
the newspaper industry dry by sucking up advertising revenue. As national and 
local newspapers try to cut their way out of trouble by slashing editorial 
budgets and shedding staff, journalistic quality is becoming a casualty. Public 
interest journalism in particular has been hit the hardest as newspapers are 
lured into a clickbait culture which favours the sensational and the trivial. 
In the light of this, we propose a 1% levy on the operations of the largest 
digital intermediaries with the resulting funds redistributed to non-profit 
ventures with a mandate to produce original local or investigative news 
reporting.

This kind of cross-subsidy is what sustained Channel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> in its formative years. We believe 
that it is now time for policymakers to address the emergent gaps in the supply 
of diverse media and to secure the trusted and independent news system that our 
democracy so desperately needs. We are backing an amendment to the digital 
economy bill currently going through parliament and will continue to press for 
a news media that places the public interest above those of shareholder and 
vested interests.
