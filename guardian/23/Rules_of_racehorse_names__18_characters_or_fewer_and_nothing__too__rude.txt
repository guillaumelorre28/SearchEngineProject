The only absolute rule when it comes to naming British racehorses is one that 
Twitter users would readily appreciate: the character limit. No name can have 
more than 18 characters, which is why Shutthefrontdoor, among others, must make 
do without spaces. He does, at least, get all of the necessary letters, a 
courtesy denied to Youlneverwalkalone, a runner in theGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> in 2004.

All names must be submitted to the British Horseracing Authority for approval, 
to ensure that there is no other horse in training with the same name. The 
names of the sport’s greatest performers – Red Rum, for example – are also 
off-limits, to preserve their legendary status.

Many owners like to name their horses with a reference to their father (sire) 
and mother (dam). A final task for administrators is to ensure names are not 
lewd, crude or offensive.

Sometimes, a name slips through the net, Hoof Hearted and Wear The Fox Hat 
being two examples, but a clever twist can sometimes win approval. The BHA once 
sent out a press release to announce the naming of a horse called Geespot: her 
sire was Pursuit Of Love, and her dam was called My Discovery.
