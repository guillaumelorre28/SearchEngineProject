Harvard athletic director Robert Scalise sent an email to team members on 
Friday night. He said no problems were found with the current team and they had 
been truthful and forthright about shortcomings in the team’s culture.

Probation means the runners’ behavior will be monitored.

Scalise had asked for an investigation after the Harvard Crimson student

women’s team, sometimes rating appearances and making lewd comments.
