, Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig are to reunite on another takedown of the tacky 
side of American culture: this time taking aim at “industrial musicals”, the 
corporate-funded shows designed to boost sales or motivate workforces that were 
popular from the 1950s to the 1980s.

, Ferrell and Wiig are attached to star in an original musical inspired by 
Steve Young’s book Everything Is Coming Up Profits: The Golden Age of 
Industrial Musicals. The score will be written by Marc Shaiman and Scott 
Wittman, best known for the stage adaptation of John Waters’s Hairspray and the 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory musical.

Young’s book details how major American corporations, including Exxon, 
Coca-Cola and Ford, would routinely put together lavish entertainments, often 
hiring well-known writers and performers, as presentations for staff and 
customers. No director has yet been named, but La La Land producer Marc Platt 
is behind the project, with playwright Steven Levenson writing the script.
