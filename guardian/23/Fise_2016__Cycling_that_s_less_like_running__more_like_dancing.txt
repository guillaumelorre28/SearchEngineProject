For the many of us who ride and talk about bikes, it’s almost always about 
getting from A to B, and often as fast and as efficiently possible. But can 
there be another way? Touring the world, a group of some of the world’s most 
skilled and physically strong riders dedicate their lives to doing exactly the 
opposite.

Their aim is to go nowhere on a bike but round in inventive, breathtaking 
circles. And they do so with such flair, entertainment and extreme daring, 
that, as a road cyclist never interested when young in smaller bikes or 
skateboards, their performance has managed to re-orientate how I think about 
riding a bike. Commuting, touring, riding a sportive or occasional race, I’ve 
always thought about riding two wheels as akin to running. But this is like 
dancing.

The World Series of Fise 2016 (Festival International des Sports Extrêmes) 
began in May this year in Montpellier, before going Croatia, the US, then 
Canada this weekend, before concluding in China in October. Now in its 20th 
year, Fise has become immensely popular, watched by crowds as big and animated 
as any grand road tour. The Montpellier leg alone attracted half a million 
spectators.

Alongside other extreme events on skateboards and rollerblades, BMX and 
mountain bike riders perform on a variety of courses, slopes and surfaces made 
of wood, earth and metal. En route, instead of battling the clock, they compete 
against each other like spinning-top gladiators, twisting, and somersaulting 
with death-defying manoeuvres. They are gymnasts whose bodies merge with their 
bikes, like a new iteration of characters fromFlann O’Brien’s The Third 
Policeman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Policeman>.

 Highlights of the MTB competition at the Fise 2016 World Series in Montpelier, 
France. 
Each performance is a competition for prize money, not to mention a chance to 
show off, but as much as that they also seems to express sheer, undiluted joy 
on a bike. When the BMX flat stage final had to be cancelled in Montpellier due 
to unexpected rain, several competitors decided to stick around until the 
showers stopped and just entertain the crowd with their skills.

Current overall leader of this discipline, France’s Matthias Dandois, is a 
household name in his own country, and regularly appears on primetime TV, but 
how many people in Britain have heard of the equally skilledLee Musselwhite 
<http://www.leemusselwhitebmx.com/> from Torquay? Or BMX spine event superstar 
Mark Webb from Portsmouth, far better known abroad? Or indeed thatthree out of 
the current top 10 BMX riders <http://www.fise.fr/en/fise-world-series-2016> in 
the World Series are British?

Culturally of course this is a very different scene to the serious, though no 
less friendly culture of road cycling, where conversations are often about 
Strava, group riding and cassette size, rather than trick manoeuvres by dudes 
with baseball caps and knee-pads inside black jeans listening to hip hop.

Even though top Fise professionals continue well into their 30s, the two 
worlds generally don’t meet, but the closest thing to this seen in road cycling 
is the charismatic Slovakian sprinter Peter Sagan, who began his early career 
riding mountain bikes, and is still frequently seen doing a wheelie in the 
middle or at the end of a road race, and displays what Fise riders are all 
about – panache.

So why are bike gymnastic events less of a big deal in the UK? Is it because 
we don’t have the weather for it? Are they seen as more of a teenage fringe 
event that’s more about skateboard fashion than serious sport? The UK has a
reasonably large number <http://www.extremesportsmap.com/uk/index.php> of urban 
skateboard parks and mountain bike courses, halfpipes and exhibition events, 
and this is certainly a sport that comes up from the streets, but even as the 
UK continues to blossom into a golden age of cycling, Team GB scooping Olympic 
and Paralympic medals, with British riders regularly dominating the Tour De 
France, other biking events get little coverage.

Even as a race event, mountain biking is largely ignored in the media, despite 
British success. Rachel Atherton and Danny Hart were recently crowned downhill 
world champions at the UCI Downhill Mountain Bike World Championships in Val di 
Sole, with Atherton gaining four gold medals this year.


What is it like to compete in such events? “It’s very tough,” says 
Musselwhite, who tells me over dinner how thousands of hours of practice can do 
terrible things to your joints. I saw Webb reveal how his knee joints move in 
an unnaturally loose way from multiple crashes in the BMX park, where broken 
bones are a common occurrence.

Competing for prizes can also be unpredictable, just as much as performing in 
any talent competition. Are the judges’ decisions ever controversial? “All the 
time,” he nods. And weather can also be a huge unknown. In the BMX flat event, 
Musselwhite was keeping back his best moves for the final, that was cancelled 
due to rain, so his interim standing of fourth had to count at the end.

The MTB slopestyle is a jaw-dropping event where mountain bikers set off down 
an extreme drop to loop, pose and shape over man-made hills. One slight moment 
of mistiming and painful accidents are inevitable. Watching a tryout event for 
amateurs (these are plentiful at Fise) you could see how difficult this really 
is. Sudden gusts of wind, including Montpellier also became a hazard, leading 
to multiple crashes. Are all the moves planned or are they ever improvised? 
British riderDaryl Brown 
<http://extremesportscompany.com/blog/daryl-brown-teaches-roadie-how-to-ride-a-real-bike/>
 told me, “Yes you plan it all in advance, but if you suddenly find your 
landing is not right, you just have to think fast and keep going.”

Watching it is one thing, and doing it another, but I get back on my bike on 
the road, I’m left with the feeling that with all its excitement, 
unpredictability, bravery and skill, dancing on a bike is certainly going 
places.
