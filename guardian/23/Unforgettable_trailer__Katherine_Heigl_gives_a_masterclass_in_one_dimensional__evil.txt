Over the years, I’ve managed to compile a list of warning signs; a series of 
questions that alert me to bad films. Questions like: “Does this film have a 
vague one-word title that bears no relation to the plot and could conceivably 
be used in any genre whatsoever?” and “Is this film about a woman who becomes 
pathologically violent over the love of a man?” and “Does this film star 
Katherine Heigl?”

Reader, I just watched the trailer to a new film called Unforgettable. The 
answer to all three questions is yes. Strap yourself in.

Let’s begin with the three-second pre-roll, the “Don’t Skip This” highlights 
package designed specifically for YouTube adverts. Here’s everything contained 
within the first three seconds of the Unforgettable trailer:

* A closeup of Katherine Heigl looking sinister!

* A closeup of Rosario Dawson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/rosario-dawson>
 looking sinister!

* A sex scene!

* The implication that Katherine Heigl is somehow watching the sex scene, and 
it’s making her sad!

* Katherine Heigl slashing at Rosario Dawson with a kitchen knife, then 
throwing her against a wall while making a high-pitched Howard Dean “YAR” noise!

* The slogan “WHEN LOVE ENDS, MADNESS BEGINS”!

* A huge Inception parp noise and seven apocalyptic drumbeats!

OK, now the actual story. Katherine Heigl’s husband has left her, and moved on 
to Rosario Dawson. But it’s OK, because Heigl and Dawson are both still 
friends, as evidenced by this scene where they sit in a weirdly echoey cocktail 
bar and repeat snippets of ham-fistedly edited dialogue back and forwards with 
each other.

Rosario Dawson: a character study

You can see why Heigl’s husband fell for Rosario Dawson. As the trailer 
proves, she’s beautiful, easy to lift and able to wave at children in a deeply 
unconventional way, which is obviously something that all kids think is ace. 
Additionally, her favourite hobby is looking at crockery, which makes her 
relatable. Truly she is every man’s dream.

Katherine Heigl: a character study

Not like that bitch Katherine Heigl. Look at her. She’s the sort of idiot who 
puts makeup on really slowly and masturbates at things. If that wasn’t bad 
enough, she drinks wine and vapes. But worst of all, her favourite hobby is 
looking at cutlery, which is a crap hobby that only dangerous weirdos and bad 
idiots like. Ugh. I hate her.

That guy they’re fighting over: a character study

OK, this is trickier. He doesn’t really wear nice clothes, and his haircut 
isn’t very good, and he’s only slightly taller than a child, and for the entire 
duration of the trailer he doesn’t say or do a single interesting thing, and he 
may as well be carved out of butter for all the purpose he actually serves. 
Still, women like that sort of thing, right?

Back to the plot. Katherine Heigl is sad that Rosario Dawson has taken her 
place. But fortunately for her, Rosario Dawson was once violently attacked in 
the past. This means that Heigl can create a fake Rosario Dawson Facebook 
account, use it to contact her attacker, tell him Rosario Dawson’s address, 
then sit back to vape and masturbate to her heart’s desire, content in the 
knowledge that she put in a good day of being one-dimensionally evil. NOTE: I 
had to watch the trailer six times to figure this out.

Then everything goes blurry. I’m adding this screenshot just to prove that 
this was deliberate on the part of the film-makers, just in case you think that 
watching this unforgivably shoddy trailer has caused your retinas to detach or 
anything.

Finally, Rosario Dawson smashes Katherine Heigl’s face into a wall. If that’s 
what it takes for me to forget that I ever wasted an hour of my life watching 
and writing about this absurd mess of a trailer, please can I be next in line?
