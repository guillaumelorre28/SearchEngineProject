Carney has now finished so here are some of the key points.

In the wake of criticisms from various politicians, he said investors would 
want a “risk premium” to buy UK assets if the Bank’s independence was questioned

. But markets should not expect this to happen. It was up to the government to 
set a target for price stability which the Bank would then decide how to reach.

On his own future, he said it would be a personal decision as to when he would 
step down from the Bank

and not related to politics.

Sterling’s recent slump had less to do with monetary policy, he said, and more 
to do with the announcement of the timetable for Article 50 andthe market’s 
perception of how discussions on Brexit would unfold.

He said there were various contingency plans in place for banks to leave 
London if they saw fit.

On QE he expressed sympathy for savers who have been hit by the programme, but 
saidthe Bank was not slavishly relying on QE.

He defended the Bank’s purchase of corporate bonds, including McDonald’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-japanese-stock-market-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-580f7bbbe4b01c528432c76c#block-580f7bbbe4b01c528432c76c>
.

On negative rates, he said there was something unnatural and a confidence 
effect.

Meanwhile the pound has recovered some ground after its earlier sudden slump, 
which was blamed variously on the strong dollar, comments from chancellor 
Philip Hammond suggesting more QE and nervousness ahead of Carney’s appearance 
at the House of Lords.

It is now down 0.3% at $1.2195 after falling as low as $1.2084 - its worst 
level since the flash crash earlier this month. Its recovery is partly due to 
Carney’s measured performance and his attempts to reassure on QE, his own 
future, and worries over the Bank’s independence.

With the slight recovery in the pound, the FTSE 100 has lost much of its 
earlier gains but still ended up 0.45% at 7017.64.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Helena Smith

Over to Greece, and the White House has confirmed that president Barack Obama 
will be visiting the country in November in what officials hope will be the 
biggest push yet to secure debt relief for the country. Our correspondent 
Helena Smith reports.


Barely days after the race for the White House, the outgoing president will 
visit Athens on November 15 in what was described as a tour aimed at 
reaffirming support “for economic reforms that reduce inequality.”

The US president has voiced barely disguised frustration with austerity 
policies he has blamed for economic stagnation and slow growth in Europe. Greek 
officials in the leftist-led government are hoping Obama will push for debt 
forgiveness when he goes on to hold talks with the German chancellor Angela 
Merkel in Berlin so that the Greek economy, currently locked in its worst slump 
in modern times, can be put on the path to recovery.

The IMF, like Washington, both believe that with a debt load in excess of 
€300bn the Greek economy is unsustainable. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has 
recently racheted up the rhetoric, saying a debt deal should be wrapped up by 
December when Athens completes a second review of the economy with 
international inspectors representing its bailout creditors at the EU and IMF. 
His appeals were rebuffed by both Merkel and her French counterpart when he met 
them on the sidelines of last week’s EU summit in Brussels. Berlin, the main 
provider of bailout funds to date, has argued that Greece’s problen is not one 
of debt but competitiveness.

Still with Brexit, and Ireland is making a pitch to provide a home for a key 
regultor. Jill Treanor writes:

It is not so long ago that European Banking Authority moved to new offices in 
London’s Canary Wharf. But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which 
oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new 
home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known 
for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance 
said: “While the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the 
negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for 
eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the 
European Banking Authority. Ireland has a significant financial services 
sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity 
to absorb the European Banking Authority’s re-location to Ireland. Our interest 
in hosting the EBA demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well 
regulated financial services. As a country with experience in providing links 
to banks and companies in the UK market, Ireland provides an ideal new home for 
the staff of the EBA.”

Ireland has made no secret of its ambitions to take any exiles from London’s 
financial services sector.

Lord Hollick ends by saying a question has been sent in during the proceedings 
by a pensioner who wants to know what he should invest his savings in.

Carney replies that when he can have the answer sent in, he will give a reply.

And with that, it’s over.

Question: Why are you opposed to negative interest rates? Do you feel 
comfortable with size of derivatives on bank bal sheets

Carney says on negative rates, uncomfortable with effect on bank balance 
sheets and lending possibly being tempered or reversed. In UK the building 
societies are an important part of system and they don’t have alternative 
supply of finance.

On top of that, there is something unnatural to negative rates to some people 
and there is a confidence effect.

In terms of derivatives, reforms put in place have substantially reduced risks.

Question: If the MPC had known about fall in sterling in August would they 
have done same stimulus measures ? When does depreciation start becoming 
serious?

Carney says committee always takes into account exchange rate movements and 
the reasons, and its effect on inflation.

Prior to referendum, the way we talked remained most appropriate - we have to 
balance supply, demand and exchange rate.

Since timing of Article 50 became clear, sterling has been influence by market 
perceptions of [future with EU].

If exchange rate has depreciated and UK supply capacity is weakened by Brexit, 
it will push up inflation.

Question: What is concerning central bankers at the moment other than Brexit?

Carney says the balance of monetary, fiscal and structural policy, and that 
monetary policy has been overburdened. Fair bit of time needs to be spent on 
that.

In terms of biggest risk, China. It is going through a series of transitions, 
manufacturing to services, from bank based lending to market based finance, 
flexibility of exchange rate. They are all happening simultaneously. Chinese 
authorities have done an exemplary job in managing this, but there are 
challenges.

In recent years the pace of growth has been faster than the speed limit, 
effectively a product of debt through shadow banking sector. Challenge is to 
sustainably and safely decelerate the rate of growth.

Question: when will the recent fall in sterling affect inflation?

Carney says the recent uptick in inflation is the product of a few factors but 
not, net, sterling. Mainly energy prices and clothing prices.

Relatively quickly we will see the effects of the sterling depreciation. By 
the spring [inflation will be] 1.5% to 1.8% annualised with an important 
contribution [from currency].

We do not have a target for the exchange rate. But it is a factor which 
influences the stance of monetary policy, and will take into account over next 
week as we make our policy decision.

Question: Given government can borrow at low rates and investing, shouldn’t 
they take advantage of that?

Carney says have to be careful in fiscal policy about what is temporary and 
what is baked in system. I agree, given interest rate, relative return on a 
project doesn’t have to be that high when there is tax revenues and an asset 
alongside it. But those decisions are decisions of the government.

Question: Is monetary policy now too loose and fiscal policy too tight?

Carney says adjusting fiscal policy is much slower than adjusting monetary 
policy, it needs budget, legislation.

So there is a need to understand the fiscal policy of the government and take 
it into account. Appropriate for chancellor and governor to discuss how the 
economy is and what should be done.

these days it’s hard to find buyers at any natural or obvious levels...It just 
goes to show how bearish the sentiment is around the pound at the moment. It 
doesn’t take a lot to send sterling south at the moment.

Of course it’s good news for all those dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which 
rallied strongly on the pound’s fall before a big bought of profit taking 
around 15:20-30 pared the day’s gains.

Carney has now finished so here are some of the key points.

In the wake of criticisms from various politicians, he said investors would 
want a “risk premium” to buy UK assets if the Bank’s independence was questioned
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-japanese-stock-market-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-580f6ea4e4b08d944ba4a6b1#block-580f6ea4e4b08d944ba4a6b1>
. But markets should not expect this to happen. It was up to the government to 
set a target for price stability which the Bank would then decide how to reach.

On his own future, he said it would be a personal decision as to when he would 
step down from the Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-japanese-stock-market-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-580f7237e4b01c528432c711#block-580f7237e4b01c528432c711>
and not related to politics.

Sterling’s recent slump had less to do with monetary policy, he said, and more 
to do with the announcement of the timetable for Article 50 andthe market’s 
perception of how discussions on Brexit would unfold.

He said there were various contingency plans in place for banks to leave 
London if they saw fit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-japanese-stock-market-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-580f7544e4b08d944ba4a6eb#block-580f7544e4b08d944ba4a6eb>

On QE he expressed sympathy for savers who have been hit by the programme, but 
saidthe Bank was not slavishly relying on QE.

.

On negative rates, he said there was something unnatural and a confidence 
effect. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-japanese-stock-market-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-580f8876e4b0219a00d387b3#block-580f8876e4b0219a00d387b3>

Meanwhile the pound has recovered some ground after its earlier sudden slump, 
which was blamed variously on the strong dollar, comments from chancellor 
Philip Hammond suggesting more QE and nervousness ahead of Carney’s appearance 
at the House of Lords.

It is now down 0.3% at $1.2195 after falling as low as $1.2084 - its worst 
level since the flash crash earlier this month. Its recovery is partly due to 
Carney’s measured performance and his attempts to reassure on QE, his own 
future, and worries over the Bank’s independence.

With the slight recovery in the pound, the FTSE 100 has lost much of its 
earlier gains but still ended up 0.45% at 7017.64.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Over to Greece, and the White House has confirmed that president Barack Obama 
will be visiting the country in November in what officials hope will be the 
biggest push yet to secure debt relief for the country. Our correspondent 
Helena Smith reports.


Barely days after the race for the White House, the outgoing president will 
visit Athens on November 15 in what was described as a tour aimed at 
reaffirming support “for economic reforms that reduce inequality.”

The US president has voiced barely disguised frustration with austerity 
policies he has blamed for economic stagnation and slow growth in Europe. Greek 
officials in the leftist-led government are hoping Obama will push for debt 
forgiveness when he goes on to hold talks with the German chancellor Angela 
Merkel in Berlin so that the Greek economy, currently locked in its worst slump 
in modern times, can be put on the path to recovery.

The IMF, like Washington, both believe that with a debt load in excess of 
€300bn the Greek economy is unsustainable. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has 
recently racheted up the rhetoric, saying a debt deal should be wrapped up by 
December when Athens completes a second review of the economy with 
international inspectors representing its bailout creditors at the EU and IMF. 
His appeals were rebuffed by both Merkel and her French counterpart when he met 
them on the sidelines of last week’s EU summit in Brussels. Berlin, the main 
provider of bailout funds to date, has argued that Greece’s problen is not one 
of debt but competitiveness.
 
Still with Brexit, and Ireland is making a pitch to provide a home for a key 
regultor. Jill Treanor writes:

It is not so long ago that European Banking Authority moved to new offices in 
London’s Canary Wharf. But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which 
oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new 
home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known 
for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance 
said: “While the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the 
negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for 
eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the 
European Banking Authority. Ireland has a significant financial services 
sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity 
to absorb the European Banking Authority’s re-location to Ireland. Our interest 
in hosting the EBA demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well 
regulated financial services. As a country with experience in providing links 
to banks and companies in the UK market, Ireland provides an ideal new home for 
the staff of the EBA.”

Ireland has made no secret of its ambitions to take any exiles from London’s 
financial services sector.

Lord Hollick ends by saying a question has been sent in during the proceedings 
by a pensioner who wants to know what he should invest his savings in.

Carney replies that when he can have the answer sent in, he will give a reply.

And with that, it’s over.
  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gives evidence to the Economic Affairs 
Committee at the House of Lords. Photograph: PA  
Question: Why are you opposed to negative interest rates? Do you feel 
comfortable with size of derivatives on bank bal sheets

Carney says on negative rates, uncomfortable with effect on bank balance 
sheets and lending possibly being tempered or reversed. In UK the building 
societies are an important part of system and they don’t have alternative 
supply of finance.

On top of that, there is something unnatural to negative rates to some people 
and there is a confidence effect.

In terms of derivatives, reforms put in place have substantially reduced risks.
 
Question: If the MPC had known about fall in sterling in August would they 
have done same stimulus measures ? When does depreciation start becoming 
serious?

Carney says committee always takes into account exchange rate movements and 
the reasons, and its effect on inflation.

Prior to referendum, the way we talked remained most appropriate - we have to 
balance supply, demand and exchange rate.

Since timing of Article 50 became clear, sterling has been influence by market 
perceptions of [future with EU].

If exchange rate has depreciated and UK supply capacity is weakened by Brexit, 
it will push up inflation.
 
Question: What is concerning central bankers at the moment other than Brexit?

Carney says the balance of monetary, fiscal and structural policy, and that 
monetary policy has been overburdened. Fair bit of time needs to be spent on 
that.

In terms of biggest risk, China. It is going through a series of transitions, 
manufacturing to services, from bank based lending to market based finance, 
flexibility of exchange rate. They are all happening simultaneously. Chinese 
authorities have done an exemplary job in managing this, but there are 
challenges.

In recent years the pace of growth has been faster than the speed limit, 
effectively a product of debt through shadow banking sector. Challenge is to 
sustainably and safely decelerate the rate of growth.
 
Question: when will the recent fall in sterling affect inflation?

Carney says the recent uptick in inflation is the product of a few factors but 
not, net, sterling. Mainly energy prices and clothing prices.

Relatively quickly we will see the effects of the sterling depreciation. By 
the spring [inflation will be] 1.5% to 1.8% annualised with an important 
contribution [from currency].

We do not have a target for the exchange rate. But it is a factor which 
influences the stance of monetary policy, and will take into account over next 
week as we make our policy decision.
 
Question: Given government can borrow at low rates and investing, shouldn’t 
they take advantage of that?

Carney says have to be careful in fiscal policy about what is temporary and 
what is baked in system. I agree, given interest rate, relative return on a 
project doesn’t have to be that high when there is tax revenues and an asset 
alongside it. But those decisions are decisions of the government.
 
Question: Is monetary policy now too loose and fiscal policy too tight?

Carney says adjusting fiscal policy is much slower than adjusting monetary 
policy, it needs budget, legislation.

So there is a need to understand the fiscal policy of the government and take 
it into account. Appropriate for chancellor and governor to discuss how the 
economy is and what should be done.
 
Away from Carney and back to the pound’s slide. Neil Wilson, markets analyst 
at ETX Capital said:

 There is no clear reason for the dip but once the run on the pound starts 
these days it’s hard to find buyers at any natural or obvious levels...It just 
goes to show how bearish the sentiment is around the pound at the moment. It 
doesn’t take a lot to send sterling south at the moment.

Of course it’s good news for all those dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which 
rallied strongly on the pound’s fall before a big bought of profit taking 
around 15:20-30 pared the day’s gains.
 
Question: Is there too much uncertainty now for forward guidance to be useful?

Carney says it is useful in certain circumstances, in the exit from 
unconventional policy.
 
Lamont: Why are you now buying corporate bonds?

Carney says this provides a different channel of stimulus. It is more powerful 
pound for pound than QE. We are buying neutrally, companies important to UK 
economy.

[Lamot: McDonald’s?] Yes, it is part of the UK economy, providing jobs.

It encourages issuance in that market, also frees up bank balance sheets to 
lend to smaller businesses and households.
