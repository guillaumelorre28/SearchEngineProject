My favourite novel was Imbolo Mbue’s bittersweet yet buoyant Behold the 
Dreamers <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/behold-the-dreamers.html> (Random 
House), told through the eyes of a Cameroonian couple newly arrived in New 
York, as their fates tangle with those of their white Upper East Side 
employers. My best nonfiction read wasThe Good Immigrant 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-immigrant.html> (Unbound), a superlative 
set of essays by black, Asian and ethnic minority writers. I’d love to read 
Siri Hustvedt’s new collection,A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/woman-looking-at-men-looking-at-women.html> 
(Sceptre). Art, sex and neuroscience: sounds fab.

Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/nothing-is-true-and-everything-is-possible.html>
 by Peter Pomerantsev (Faber) is an eye-popping accumulation of true stories of 
bribery and extortion from Putin’s Russia, a must read in today’s barbaric 
world. Anthony Doerr’s novelAll the Light We Cannot See 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/all-the-light-we-cannot-see.html> (4th 
Estate) outran all else as my novel of the year. Set in France and Germany 
during the second world war, this is an epic work about bravery and the power 
of attachment. I want Doerr’s other books for Christmas please.

Two touching novellas about teenage friendship, Fred Uhlman’s reissued Reunion 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/reunion-4.html> (Vintage) and Eric Beck 
Rubin’s first novel,School of Velocity 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=school+of+velocity&order=relevance&dir=desc>
(Pushkin Press), both made an impression, as did David Szalay’s brilliant 
stories inAll That Man Is 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/all-that-man-is.html> (Vintage). Elizabeth 
Strout’sMy Name Is Lucy Barton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/02/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout>
 (Viking) was a worthy follow-up to Olive Kitteridge and I also loved Olivia 
Laing’s mix of memoir and criticism,The Lonely City 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-lonely-city.html> (Canongate). As to the 
Christmas list, it was going to include Zadie Smith’sSwing Time 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/swing-time-445378.html> (Hamish Hamilton), 
but too late – I’m already some way through.

Frantumaglia <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/frantumaglia.html> (Europa 
Editions) is an absorbing, tantalising journey into the private world ofElena 
Ferrante 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/elena-ferrante-frantumaglia-extract-books-no-need-authors>
. I was halfway through it when the unconscionable, unforgivable exposure of 
her identity occurred (and may that man, Claudio Gatti, never know peace 
again). Helen Stevenson’s frank and movingLove Like Salt 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/love-like-salt.html> (Virago) explores the 
vulnerabilities and strengths that have arisen from parenting a child with 
cystic fibrosis. I also loved Elizabeth Strout’sMy Name Is Lucy Barton  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-name-is-lucy-barton.html>(Viking): she 
gets better with each book. I am hoping that someone will give me an advance 
copy of Karl Geary’s debut novel,Montpelier Parade 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/montpelier-parade.html> (Harvill Secker), out 
in January, as I’ve heard it’s lyrical, brave and inventive – everything I look 
for in a novel.

All We Shall Know; Lying in Wait

Donal Ryan, the king of the new wave of Irish writers, turned in a democratic 
work of genius this year,All We Shall Know 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/all-we-shall-know.html> (Doubleday). I was 
entranced by it. Buckled by it. Ditto the new queen of Irish crime, Liz Nugent, 
who terrified me with her immaculate thumbscrew of a novel,Lying in Wait 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lying-in-wait.html> (Penguin). Santa, please 
bring me Ali Smith’s perennially seasonalAutumn 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autumn-436665.html> (Hamish Hamilton). She 
is, of course, Scotland’s Nobel laureate-in-waiting – and I can’t wait for her 
new book.

Who do we turn to to tell the story of our time? Ali Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/16/ali-smith-autumn-interview-how-can-we-live-ina-world-and-not-put-a-hand-across-a-divide-brexit-profu>
’sAutumn (Hamish Hamilton) is bold and brilliant, dealing with the body blow of 
Brexit to offer us something rare: hope. Gary Younge’sAnother Day in the Death 
of America 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review>
 (Guardian Faber) is a heartbreaking, shattering and searing indictment of the 
effects of the lack of gun control on the lives of 10 young people in a single 
day. Denise Riley’sSay Something Back 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/say-something-back.html> (Picador) shows how 
grief keeps a different clock and is a churning yet exhilarating (because the 
poems are so good) exploration of loss. Her poetry gets to the heart. Madeleine 
Bunting, inLove of Country 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/love-of-country.html> (Granta), explores the 
choppy history of the Hebrides and makes you feel you are there even if you 
have just left. I’d love a copy of Paul Beatty’sThe Sellout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/04/the-sellout-by-paul-beatty-review-galvanizing-satire-post-racial-america>
 (Oneworld).

I absolutely adored Zadie Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/zadie-smith-london-state-of-mind-swing-time-nw-bbc>
’sSwing Time (Hamish Hamilton). Fairly perfect as far as literary novels go. 
Alejandro Zambra’sMultiple Choice 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/multiple-choice.html> (Granta) is, to my 
mind, the best of what experimental fiction can be. And Sarah Ladipo Manyika’s
Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/like-a-mule-bringing-ice-cream-to-the-sun.html>
 (Cassava Republic Press) introduced me to one of my favourite literary 
characters ever. Dr Morayo Da Silva is a new best friend.

This year, I rediscovered poetry. Yes, I know. It all went wrong with the 
first newPenguin Modern Poets: If I’m Scared We Can’t Win 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/penguin-modern-poets.html> (Penguin); soon, 
it was Emily Berry for breakfast and Anne Carson on the bus. Then came Sharon 
Olds’sOdes <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/odes-429381.html> (Vintage), whose 
paeans to testicles, pudenda and merkins are interspersed with acts of 
breathtaking linguistic daring. Buy one for Granny; that will pep up Christmas 
morning. I would passionately like to receive a book token: hours of 
rumination; perfect happiness. Failing that, a supermarket sweep with a real 
trolley. Or Pushkin Press’s new translation of Gaito Gazdanov’sThe Flight 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/flight-476132.html>: his writing has been 
described as “if Nabokov wrote thrillers”. I’m hooked.

In bewildering times, reading is solace. You Will Not Have My Hate 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/you-will-not-have-my-hate.html> (Harvill 
Secker) is a blazingly beautiful memoir written by French journalist Antoine 
Leiris after his wife was killed in the Bataclan terrorist attack. A glimmer of 
hope in the dark. Having heard Laura Bates speak this year, I have boughtGirl Up
 <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-up.html> (Simon & Schuster) for every 
teenage girl (and boy) I know; savvy, no-nonsense practical feminism. I loved 
the spare beauty of Graham Swift’sMothering Sunday 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mothering-sunday.html> (Scribner), along with 
the dazzlingThis Must Be the Place 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/this-must-be-the-place.html> (Headline) by 
Maggie O’Farrell. And for Christmas? I am hoping forEcholand

In The Book of Memory 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-book-of-memory-406124.html> (Faber), the 
sole woman on death row in a Zimbabwean prison reflects on family, guilt and 
redemption. Petina Gappah’s first novel is a witty and tender account of a life 
in a country undergoing momentous change.The Natural Way of Things 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-natural-way-of-things.html> (Atlantic), 
Charlotte Wood’s shocking feminist dystopia, sees 10 women, all of whom have 
been involved in sex scandals with powerful men, held in a remote prison in 
Australia. Beautiful and savage – think Atwood in the outback. The book I’d 
like to receive for Christmas: Ali Smith’sAutumn 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autumn-436665.html> (Hamish Hamilton). I’d 
like to read it while the tumultuous events of this summer are still fresh in 
the mind.

For Christmas brain food I recommend two brilliant explorations of animal 
minds, Frans de Waal’sAre We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/are-we-smart-enough-to-know-how-smart-animals-are.html>
 (Granta) and Emma Geen’s dizzyingly original debut novel,The Many Selves of 
Katherine North  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/many-selves-of-katherine-north.html>
(Bloomsbury). Reading JM Coetzee can be grim but is never pointless.The 
Schooldays of Jesus <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/schooldays-of-jesus.html> 
(Harvill) turns around one of those rare, gifted children who even their 
parents cannot understand. There’s a horrible shock in the middle, but it will 
keep you philosophically and morally on the edge of your seat throughout. 
Please give me thePrivate Eye Annual 2016 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/private-eye-annual-430975.html> to cheer me 
up.

His Bloody Project <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/his-bloody-project.html> 
(Contraband) by Graeme Macrae Burnet, which was shortlisted for the Booker, 
grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let you go. This multilayered novel about a 
19th-century murder near Applecross is as heartbreaking as it is desperate and 
it tickles me that people all over the world will now have a lexicon of old 
Scots words to spice up their vocabulary. If His Bloody Project is dark, then 
Victoria Hislop’sCartes Postales From Greece 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/cartes-postales-from-greece-428731.html> 
(Headline) is right up there with it, despite its sunny title. This is a 
treasure trove of wonderful fictional stories that took me deep into the 
country. For Christmas, I will give my daughter Alexandra Shulman’sInside 
Vogue: A Diary of My 100th Year 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/inside-vogue.html> (Fig Tree) on the strict 
understanding that I get a copy of my own right back. That’s Boxing Day sorted 
out.

My novel of the year is unquestionably Edna O’Brien’s brilliantly acute The 
Little Red Chairs <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-red-chairs.html> 
(Faber), inexplicably absent from the Man Booker list. Also,Madonna in a Fur 
Coat <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/madonna-in-a-fur-coat.html> (Penguin) by 
Sabahattin Ali, a seemingly slight love story, written in the 1940s but only 
translated from the original Turkish into English this year. It’s short but has 
the kind of indefinably powerful impact of The Great Gatsby; and Kit de Waal’s 
searing debut about an estranged nine-year-old boy,My Name Is Leon 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-name-is-leon.html> (Viking). Two 
heart-breakers. In nonfiction, the erudite and extraordinary Roger Scruton has 
written a terrific book on Wagner, The Ring of Truth 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ring-of-truth.html> (Allen Lane) and Meetings 
With Remarkable Manuscripts 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ring-of-truth.html> (Allen Lane) by 
Christopher de Hamel must be the most exquisitely produced book of the year. 
Scrupulously scholarly yet utterly absorbing, as well as beguilingly lovely to 
behold. I am hoping some kind person will give meBeethoven for a Later Age 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beethoven-for-a-later-age.html> (Faber) by 
Edward Dusinberre, the first violinist of the brilliant Takács Quartet, who 
promises to take me through Beethoven’s 16 string quartets, in the hope that it 
will help me to finally choose which I shall have at my funeral.

I was enthralled by Helen Dunmore’s Exposure 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/exposure-463995.html> (Windmill) – such a 
skilful recreation of a time and a climate of mind and a real page-turner. 
Francis Spufford’sGolden Hill 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/golden-hill-461107.html> (Faber) is nothing 
short of a masterpiece; 18th-century New York came alive for me and I say this 
as someone who doesn’t usually care for historical novels. The book I would 
most like to be given at the moment is Gillian Beer’s forthcomingAlice in Space 
(University of Chicago Press).

Sarah Bakewell’s At the Existentialist Café 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/at-the-existentialist-cafe.html> (Vintage) 
places 20th-century European philosophy in the context of the lives of its 
protagonists and Bakewell herself, making both the content and the relevance of 
its often difficult ideas remarkably clear. Anthony Gottlieb’s lucidThe Dream 
of Enlightenment <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dream-of-enlightenment.html> 
(Allen Lane) also locates the thinkers in their time, which enables us to see 
their importance for us now more clearly. Paul Kalanithi’sWhen Breath Becomes 
Air <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/when-breath-becomes-air.html> (Vintage) 
tops my longlist of books I’d like for Christmas.

In these Trumpian times, two powerful and depressing books that have haunted 
me this year are Alexander Maksik’sShelter in Place 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shelter-in-place.html> (Europa Editions), a 
strange, dark and beautiful novel about violence, mental illness and love, and 
Colson Whitehead’s fantastic novel about slavery,The Underground Railroad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead-revie-luminous-furious-wildly-inventive>
(Fleet). The book I am most hoping to get for the holidays and read under palm 
trees is Rachel Cusk’s new novel,Transit 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/transit-429251.html> (Vintage), since I loved 
Outline and have been waiting for it for ever.

Siddhartha Mukherjee’sThe Gene <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-gene.html> 
(Vintage) so I’ll recommendPaul Beatty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/my-writing-day-booker-winner-paul-beatty>
’s Booker-winningThe Sellout (Oneworld), a hilarious, anger-fuelled cadenza 
that feels as if it were written in one manic burst. If you’re pressed for 
time, I suggest Riad Sattouf’s two-volume graphic novelThe Arab of the Future 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/arab-of-the-future.html> (runner-up: The One 
Hundred Nights of Hero 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/one-hundred-nights-of-hero.html> by Isabel

Away from my weekly book diet for Open Book, I’ve been looking beyond our 
borders and found myself deeply engrossed by André Naffs-Sahely’s translation 
of Alessandro Spina’s thinly disguised memoirThe Confines of the Shadow 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confines-of-the-shadow.html> (Darf), charting 
the transformation of Benghazi from sleepy Libyan backwater to the major 
metropolis in an oil-rich kingdom that it became by the 1960s. Ayelet 
Gundar-Goshen’sWaking Lions <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/waking-lions.html>
 (Pushkin Press) was another window to a secret world, set among the North 
African migrant population in contemporary Israel and beautifully translated 
from Hebrew by Sondra Silverston.Reputations by the renowned Colombian author 
Juan Gabriel Vásquez was another gripping morality tale that was much bigger in 
scope than its slim volume might suggest. I’m currently summoning the courage 
to read a much-praised memoir of loss, Shannon Leone Fowler’sTravelling With 
Ghosts 
<http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Traveling-with-Ghosts/Shannon-Leone-Fowler/9781501107795>
 (Simon & Schuster), which is published in February 2017 and looks set to 
provide refuge from family mayhem during the Christmas holidays.

The two books I most enjoyed were Sarah Perry’s eerie historical thriller, The 
Essex Serpent <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-essex-serpent.html> 
(Profile), and Emma John’s funny and touching memoir of supporting the England 
cricket team in the 90s,Following On 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/25/following-on-memoir-teenage-obsession-terrible-cricket-emma-john-review>
 (Wisden). The book I most admired was Nicholas Crane’sThe Making of the 
British Landscape 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/making-of-the-british-landscape-435501.html> 
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson): as panoramic as it is revelatory, it does what it says 
on the tin. As for the book I’d like for Christmas: an advance copy of Andrea 
Carandini’s comprehensive two-volume survey,The Atlas of Ancient Rome 
(Princeton University Press), would be good.

In The Return <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-return.html> (Viking), 
Hisham Matar undertakes a quest for his father, imprisoned by Gaddafi. The 
intelligence and grace of Matar’s writing is fuelled by a fierce and valid rage.
What Belongs to You <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/what-belongs-to-you.html> 
(Picador) charts the relationship between a young English teacher and a 
Bulgarian hustler. It’s the specificity of Garth Greenwell’s observations that 
give this debut novel its emotional power. Joy Williams is a stone-cold 100% 
American original andThe Visiting Privilege 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/30/the-visiting-privilege-joy-williams-review>
 (Profile), her collected short stories, is a treasure trove of high-octane 
prose and surreal wit. For Christmas? Marina Abramović’sWalk Through Walls 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/walk-through-walls.html> (Penguin).

The book I loved this year was The Essex Serpent  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/19/the-essex-serpent-review-victorian-gothic-compelling>
(Profile) by Sarah Perry – a stunning historical novel. As far as nonfiction 
goes, it’s Peggy Orenstein’sGirls & Sex 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/girls-sex-navigating-the-compliated-new-landscape.html>
 (Oneworld). It’s a vital work for parents and teachers of teenagers, outlining 
how little girls know about their own pleasure centres and how they seem to 
believe they’re only there to please the boys and not themselves. On my want 
list is Stef Penney’sUnder a Pole Star 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/under-a-pole-star.html> (Quercus). She’s a 
wonderful storyteller.

I met Beryl Bainbridge a few times and her biography, Love By All Sorts of 
Means 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/beryl-bainbridge-love-by-all-sorts-of-means-brendan-king-review-natural-born-fibber>
 (Bloomsbury), by Brendan King completely gripped me. It made me intensely 
nostalgic for a time when literary life consisted mainly of drinking and 
fucking.Elizabeth Strout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/elizabeth-strout-i-dont-want-to-write-melodrama-interview>
’sMy Name Is Lucy Barton (Viking) was the standout novel of the year – a 
visceral account of the relations between mother and daughter and the 
unreliability of memory. I would like to be given Booker prize-winner Paul 
Beatty’sThe Sellout (Oneworld).

Brad Watson’s Miss Jane <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/miss-jane.html> 
(Picador); a bittersweet southern pastoral, the story of a forgotten woman 
written with unearthly beauty. If Raymond Carver and Flannery O’Connor had a 
child, it would be Brad Watson. Margaret Atwood’sHag-Seed 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hag-seed.html> (Hogarth) pays homage to the 
Bard’s Tempest while delivering a passionately original, heady, often musical 
modern remix. Ottessa Moshfegh’s thrillingly playfulEileen 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/eileen.html> (Vintage) is scary, smart, 
uncomfortable. Her story collection,Homesick for Another World 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/homesick-for-another-world.html> (Jonathan 
Cape), comes out in January. And what do I want for Christmas?Do Not Say We

No new book spoke more to me than The Econocracy 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/econocracy.html> (Manchester University 
Press) by Joe Earle, Cahal Moran and Zach Ward-Perkins. A plea for the 
economics profession to abandon sterile, model-driven neoclassical dogma and 
return to the old verities (Hayek as much as Keynes) of pluralism and human 
agency, it is a remarkable, perhaps game-changing contribution by three young 
Manchester graduates.Diary of a Wartime Affair 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/diary-of-a-wartime-affair.html> (Viking) by 
Doreen Bates does what it says, essentially a tale of the Blitz and fucking 
(her 1940s word, not mine), in a startlingly frank and readable way. For 
Christmas, please, Margaret Drabble’s new novel,The Dark Flood Rises 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dark-flood-rises.html> (Canongate): the 
urgently needed voice of the tough-minded liberal.

Emma Cline’s subtle reimagining of the Manson cult, The Girls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-girls-emma-cline-review> 
(Chatto & Windus), was the most hyped debut novel of the year – and it fully 
lived up to its promise. The story is told by an ordinary middle-aged woman who 
looks back on her life as a moderately unhappy teenage girl in California. 
Paddling in the shallows of 60s freak-outery, she finds herself pulled into a 
crazed and welcoming riptide. This happens with such subtlety – verbal 
psychological, historical – that the safety of the shore remains simultaneously 
in view and hopelessly out of reach. For Christmas, surely one of my so-called 
friends will have the common decency to give me a signed copy of Bruce 
Springsteen’sBorn to Run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/born-to-run-memoir-bruce-springsteen-review>
 (Simon & Schuster).

Measures of Expatriation 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/measures-of-expatriation.html> by the 
Trinidadian-British poet Vahni Capildeo (Carcanet) gives a long, searching look 
at dislocation and plurality and polyvocality and diasporas: it’s a very 
singular and powerful collection. Joanna Walsh is marvellously mischievous in
Grow a Pair: 9½ Fairytales About Sex <http://www.readux.net/books/grow-a-pair> 
(Readux Books). AndThe Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ultimate-ambition-in-the-arts-of-erudition.html>
 by the medieval Egyptian Shihab al-Din al-Nuwayri (Penguin) spills over with 
insatiable curiosity at its most irrepressible: an elixir for dark days.

It’s been a vintage year for political memoirs, but the most memorable book I 
have read this year isRedeemable 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/redeemable.html> (Bloomsbury) by Erwin James, 
who served 20 years for his part in two murders and who clawed his way back 
from a very low place to lead a useful and productive life. I also enjoyedThe 
History Thieves <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/history-thieves.html> 
(Granta) by Ian Cobain, an account of Britain’s obsession with official 
secrecy. For Christmas, I would like John le Carré’s memoir,The Pigeon Tunnel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/the-pigeon-tunnel-john-le-carre-review>
.

I was deeply affected by The Good Immigrant 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-immigrant.html> (Unbound), a vital and 
often bitingly funny series of personal essays. My favourite is Vinay Patel’s 
boyhood struggle to embrace any faith and cure his fear of death, something 
that kept me awake as an angsty kid too. Also, MIT professor Sherry Turkle’s
Reclaiming Conversation 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/reclaiming-conversation-437310.html> 
(Turnaround), on how communication technology is, ironically, harming our 
ability to meaningfully connect. At Christmas I’d like to readAt the

The Knives; Conclave

My two favourite books of 2016 were both thrillers. The Knives 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/knives-435368.html> (Faber) by Richard T 
Kelly has a home secretary as the central character. Very few people will be 
able to testify to its authenticity. I can and I do. A cracking read. Robert 
Harris is incapable of writing a substandard novel. In the first 100 pages of
Conclave <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conclave.html> (Cornerstone) nothing 
much happens. Then the pope dies and Harris demonstrates the depth of his 
research. What follows is all the more gripping for the trouble the author has 
taken to set the scene. Would someone please buy meCommonwealth

Alex Webb’s shadow-dazed photographs are unmistakable. La Calle 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/alex-webb-la-calle-photographs-of-mexico.html>
 (Thames & Hudson) is his love song to the streets of Mexico. Anne Carson’s 
newest book of poems,Float <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/float-434736.html> 
(Jonathan Cape), is not exactly new, not a single book, mostly not poems. In 23 
slender chapbooks, she pinpoints the collision of oracle and anachronism. 
Ishion Hutchinson’sHouse of Lords and Commons 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/house-of-lords-and-commons.html> (Macmillan) 
was the best new collection of poems I read this year. His imagistic fluency 
equals his moral imagination. For Christmas, I would like Jameel Jaffer’sThe 
Drone Memos <http://thenewpress.com/books/drone-memos> (The New Press), a nice 
counterweight to the hosannas ushering Obama from office.

chilling, brilliantly clever page-turnerLying in Wait

Progress; Utopia for Realists
 Photograph: PR Company Handout 
In a year in which the left and right advocate destructive and chaotic 
policies because they think the world is collapsing, Johan Norberg’sProgress 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/progress.html> (Oneworld) reminds us that 
headlines are misleading and that history and data show that life has been 
getting radically better in every way. InUtopia for Realists 
<https://thecorrespondent.com/utopia-for-realists/>, Rutger Bregman says let’s 
think outside the cube and consider how best to take advantage of the changes 
that economics and technology are bringing. Not everyone will agree with all 
four prescriptions, but Bregman gets us thinking in new ways. For Christmas, I

<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/today-will-be-different.html>(Weidenfeld &

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/maria-semple-today-will-be-different-interview>
, a novel about an intelligent, disagreeable Seattle mother, and I’m finding it 
hilarious. I also loved both the humour and poignancy in Jennifer Weiner’s 
essay collectionHungry Heart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/hungry-heart-jennifer-weiner-review>
 (Simon & Schuster). I’d be delighted to receive the literary murder mysteryYou 
Will Know Me <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/you-will-know-me.html> (Picador) 
by Megan Abbott as a Christmas gift. It’s set in the world of competitive 
gymnastics and has received rave reviews. I heard Abbott speak recently and she 
was terrifically smart and entertaining.

I got a big kick out of Nathan Hill’s impressive first novel, The Nix 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/nix.html> (Picador), out in the UK next year. 
Hill’s zeitgeisty portrayals of video game addiction and customer-oriented 
university education are brilliant. I also loved the haunting 2016 
International Man Booker prizewinner, Han Kang’sThe Vegetarian 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-vegetarian.html> (Granta). Meantime, I’d 
like Santa to mend a gaping hole in my education and stuff Philip Roth’sThe

my stocking (thanks for the tip, SC).

I usually spend my time reading novels, but this year I was lucky to be a 
judge of the Baillie Gifford prize, so my reading was dominated by nonfiction. 
From that pile, I’d heartily recommend Rowan Moore’s brilliantSlow Burn City 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/slow-burn-city.html> (Picador), as well as 
Simon Ings’sStalin and the Scientists 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/stalin-and-the-scientists.html> (Faber). That 
said, I’m excited about getting back to fiction in 2017 and I’d love to wake up 
on Christmas morning with Margaret Atwood’sHag-Seed

With political turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic focusing on race and 
migrancy, two books published this year could not be more timely: the essay 
collectionThe Good Immigrant 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-immigrant.html> (Unbound), edited by 
Nikesh Shukla, andAnother Day in the Death of America 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/another-day-in-the-death-of-america.html> 
(Guardian Faber) by Gary Younge. After that you might need some light relief, 
amply found in Maria Semple’sToday Will Be Different 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/today-will-be-different.html> (Weidenfeld & 
Nicolson). For Christmas, I would like two things: Elena Ferrante’s
Frantumaglia: A Writer’s Journey 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/frantumaglia.html> (Europa Editions) and for 
the worm who publicised her real identity in newspapers around the world to 
find his turkey as dry, flavourless and pointless as his “exposé”.

Garth Greenwell’s What Belongs to You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/10/what-belongs-to-you-garth-greenwell-review>
 (Picador) manages to condense the physical and metaphysical nature of longing 
and desire into prose that turned me on and broke my heart. A classic. Yaa 
Gyasi’sHomegoing <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/homegoing.html> (Viking), 
published in teh UK next January, follows the descendants of slaves and slavers 
from 17th-century Ghana to the US of Black Lives Matter. Encompassing events 
major and minor, but skilfully skipping the civil war, it humanises big issues 
by giving us unforgettable characters. It could not be more relevant or needed.

Teffi’s Memories: From Moscow to the Black Sea (Pushkin Press, translated by 
Robert and Elizabeth Chandler) recounts the flight of the author as she fled 
the Bolshevik revolution in a single pair of silver shoes. Light, witty and 
elegiac all at once – I found it captivating. Llewelyn Powys’sRecalled to Life: 
A Consumptive’s Diary, 1911 
<http://www.powys-society.org/The%20Powys%20Society%20Publishing%20News.html>, 
(the Powys Society, edited by Peter J Foss) records Powys’s return from a Swiss 
sanatorium to his home in Somerset. Expressing the emerging philosophy of 
someone who spent his adult life never far from death, it also presents a vivid 
picture of pre-1914 rural England. Georges Simenon’sThe Hand 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hand-434378.html> (Penguin, translated by 
Linda Coverdale) is another of Simenon’s newly translatedromans durs, which I’d 
love to be given for Christmas.

It has been the year of the Backlisted Podcast 
<https://soundcloud.com/backlistedpod> for me, in which Andy Miller and John 
Mitchinson invite guests to revive forgotten literary classics. I’ve adored 
discovering the work of Barbara Comyns, Jill Tweedie, Denton Welch and Nella 
Larsen, with Miller and Mitchinson the perfect genial, bookish hosts. As far as 
new novels go, Colson Whitehead’sThe Underground Railroad 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/underground-railroad-460736.html> (Fleet) and 
Francis Spufford’sGolden Hill 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/golden-hill-461107.html> (Faber) were my 
picks of the year and I was glad to see Richard Mason’s exquisite and gripping
Who Killed Piet Barol? 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/who-killed-piet-barol.html> (Orion) getting 
such excellent reviews. For Christmas, will someone buy me everything Kathleen 
Jamie has ever written? I’ve just finishedSightlines

love with her…

nuanced restraint of Elizabeth Strout’sMy Name Is Lucy Barton

 (Viking.) For a frivolous Christmas read, I’d choose Sali Hughes’s Pretty

This has been a particularly enjoyable year for reading, reminding us that 
brilliance and pleasure can coincide. I loved Eimear McBride’s energetic, 
sensuousThe Lesser Bohemians 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lesser-bohemians.html> (Faber), which has 
opened up new possibilities for writing about sex. I was also dazzled by Rachel 
Cusk’sTransit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/28/transit-by-rachel-cusk-review-complex-brilliant-prose>
 (Jonathan Cape), which I found a more generously life-filled novel than its 
predecessor, Outline. Cusk has perfected the brilliant, dark humour possible 
with a narrator apparently oblivious to the comedy of the scenes she’s 
describing. We’re now in the season of long-awaited biographies. I would 
enthusiastically recommend Edmund Gordon’s subtle, empathetic account of Angela 
Carter,The Invention of Angela Carter 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invention-of-angela-carter.html> (Chatto & 
Windus), and am hoping that Christmas will bring a copy of Artemis Cooper’s
Elizabeth Jane Howard 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/elizabeth-jane-howard.html> (John Murray).

This year, I’ve loved Garth Greenwell’s What Belongs to You  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/what-belongs-to-you.html>(Picador), a novel 
that finds the poetry and beauty in cruising lavatories for sex. Jessie Burton’s
The Muse <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-muse.html> (Picador) is both 
elegant and as gripping as a thriller, even better than her first. And Lauren 
Elkin’sFlâneuse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/flaneuse-women-walk-city-paris-new-york-tokyo-venice-london-review-lauren-elkin>
(Chatto & Windus) reminded me of the importance of occasionally wandering the 
city alone and without purpose. I’m always ridiculously happy to find books 
under the tree and this year I’m hoping for Olivia Laing’sThe Lonely City 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-lonely-city.html> (Canongate).

I loved Rose Tremain’s The Gustav Sonata 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-gustav-sonata.html> (Vintage), about a 
lifelong friendship between two boys who first meet in kindergarten in postwar 
Switzerland. The layers of story are engrossing and beautifully put together. A 
novel to savour and reread. Rachel Cusk’s latest novel,Transit 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/transit-429251.html> (Jonathan Cape), is one 
of her best. Her emotional penetration and gift for black comedy are combined 
into a moving exploration of lives lived in solitude, struggling to connect. 
The book I’d love for Christmas is Nicholas Crane’sThe Making of the British 
Landscape 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/making-of-the-british-landscape-435501.html> 
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson).

This year, I was very happy to discover Alejandro Zambra. His new book, 
Multiple Choice <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/multiple-choice.html> 
(Granta), brilliantly translated from the Spanish by Megan McDowell, manages to 
blend Oulipian poetry, funny-sad short stories and choose-your-own-adventure, 
thus combining pretty much all my interests in one book. From there, I found 
his tiny and heartbreaking novella, Bonsai, which is the best thing I’ve read 
in ages. For Christmas, I’m hoping someone will give me the new Colson 
Whitehead novel,The Underground Railroad 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/underground-railroad-460736.html> (Fleet). 
He’s a writer I love who is always changing, always taking risks.

In 1989, Hisham Matar’s father, an anti-Gaddafi dissident, disappeared into a 
Libyan dungeon. What makesThe Return 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/03/hisham-matar-the-return-review> 
(Viking) outstanding, though, is not its highly charged subject matter but its 
subtle and ingenious structure, and the patient attentiveness with which Matar 
observes and listens. A humane and haunting book. Francis Spufford is a writer 
of brilliantly unconventional nonfiction.Golden Hill 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/golden-hill-461107.html> (Faber), his first 
novel, set in 18th-century New York and crowded with malcontents and misfits, 
is a treat.

I’ve been reading a great deal of Jackie Kay’s work recently. Trumpet 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/trumpet-370485.html> (Macmillan), a novel 
about a jazz man who is actually a woman, was reissued this year: a rich, taut 
and compelling novel by a fine writer. A Picador classic. I’d also recommendThe 
Epic of Gilgamesh <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/epic-of-gilgamesh-3.html> 
(Penguin), translated by Andrew George. In this verse translation, what 
scholars claim as the first great work in world literature arrived vividly in 
our century. It is a miracle of reclamation from scattered cuneiform tablets 
and sends out ripples to the Old Testament, Homer and Beowulf. For Christmas, I 
would like David Hockney’sA Bigger Book 
<https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/art/all/02641/facts.david_hockney_a_bigger_book.htm>
, just £1,750 from Taschen.

In Climbing Days <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/climbing-days.html> 
(Faber), Dan Richards brings a Jerome K Jerome-like levity to the task of 
recreating the climbs of his mountaineer great aunt. Rory Stewart’sThe Marches 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/marches.html> (Jonathan Cape) is an excellent 
meditation on the borderlands between England and Scotland, while at the bottom 
of the world Jean McNeil completes her trio of books on the polar regions with 
the powerfully atmosphericIce Diaries <http://ecwpress.com/products/ice-diaries>
 (ECW Press). Top of my Christmas list is Karen Lloyd’s much-lauded exploration 
of Morecambe Bay:The Gathering Tide 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-gathering-tide-a-journey-around-the-edgelands-of-morecambe-bay.html>
 (Saraband).
