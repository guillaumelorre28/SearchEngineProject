David Cameron hosts the UK Anti-Corruption Summit on Thursday, which will be 
attended, in his words, by some of the world’s most “fantastically corrupt 
countries” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/10/david-cameron-afghanistan-nigeria-possibly-most-corrupt-countries>
, 11 May). The prime minister might consider adding Britain to his list. The UK 
heads the world’s biggest financial secrecy network. It has sovereignty in over 
a third of all tax havens worldwide and over half of the companies named in the
Panama Papers <https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers> scandal 
used a single UK tax haven, the British Virgin Islands. A World Bank analysis 
of corruption cases worldwide found that British havens dominate.

His attempt to persuade the overseas territories and crown dependencies to 
open up their registries to the overstretched HMRC and UK law enforcement is 
neither transparent nor a sufficient deterrent. The aid given to bolster 
developing nations’ tax takes is nothing when compared with the untaxed 
corporate profits that haemorrhage out of poor countries’ economies offshore 
into UK jurisdictions. More than 300 economists have written to Cameron arguing 
that tax havens have no economic benefit and that Britain’s “deliberate choice” 
to operate them “fuels corruption”. By refusing to implement the deterrent of 
making registers of beneficial ownership of UK tax havens public, Mr Cameron 
ensures that Britain continues to facilitate international tax avoidance, 
corruption and crime.

The biggest irony of the refusal by Britain and other nations to open up their 
havens is that doing so would bring in billions onshore, a boon for global 
public finances. It appears we are stuck: many of the rich and powerful who 
could open up the havens are busy making personal use of the financial secrecy 
they have on offer. The Tory government hosting an anti-corruption summit is 
like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop.

• Aditya Chakrabortty is right on the money (Corruption can no longer be 
written off as a developing world problem, Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/corruption-developing-world-problem-london-summit-panama-papers>
, 10 May). It is all too convenient to think that corruption is something that 
happens in relatively poor countries and not in Britain. Indeed, the Centre for 
Crime and Justice Studies has just published a report,Redefining corruption: 
Public attitudes to the relationship between government and business 
<http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/publications/redefining-corruption>, based 
on a YouGov survey, which shows that parliament is out of touch with how the 
public feels about corruption in British politics and business.

Almost two-thirds of those surveyed think that governments should not be 
permitted to invite private companies to shape regulatory policy; more than 
two-thirds want the private finance initiative banned; and three-quarters think 
that ministers and senior civil servants should be prohibited from taking up 
positions in private business. The survey indicates that the public regard such 
arrangements as at best collusive and at worst corrupt. Unfortunately, this is 
not the type of corruption we are likely to hear about from the prime minister 
at Thursday’s summit.

• At the 2013 G8 summit, David Cameron pledged to tackle the secrecy in the 
tax system that enables corruption. ThePanama Papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers> confirmed, though, that 
the UK sits at the heart of an international network of tax havens, which 
allows elites and big businesses to dodge tax here and in some of the world’s 
poorest countries. It is people living in developing countries who lose most 
when public services are starved of funding. For example, an international oil 
company worked aggressively to circumvent a new tax in Uganda by moving its 
official address to Mauritius, the African tax haven of choice.

Cameron boasts of his commitment to development. Taking tough action on tax 
havens and financial secrecy will be a test of that commitment (UK Overseas 
territories resist PM’s call to end tax secrecy, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/overseas-territories-resist-calls-for-concessions-to-end-tax-secrecy>
10 May). It would have a lasting impact on the poorest countries’ ability to 
collect a fair amount of tax to fund the essential public services that help 
lift people out of poverty.

• We also need to consider the impact of the tax evasion revealed in the 
Panama Papers on the global economy.Economist Gabriel Zucman 
<http://gabriel-zucman.eu> believes up to 8% of the world’s wealth is tied up 
in shell companies, with Africa leading the way at 30%. The lost tax revenue on 
that wealth is crippling for underdeveloped countries as they try to develop 
infrastructure and boost lagging GDP. As the Panama Papers database goes 
online, the time is ripe for citizens to pressure their government to take 
action to recover the losses to their nations.

• Can you give us the full rundown on the Tory-party donating construction 
firms found guilty of blacklisting hundreds of workers, thereby depriving them 
and their families of their livelihoods (Report, 9 May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/blacklisted-workers-win-10m-payout-from-construction-firms>
)? The high-level corruption you highlight is disgraceful enough. But it’s the 
low-level, everyday corruption that is gnawing away at society.

• David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> ignores 
the corruption in his own party, while criticising other countries to the 
Queen. A number of his MPs and/or their close family members have been named as 
having vested interests in private healthcare companies to which private 
contracts for NHS services are being awarded. Is this not a form of corruption?

• You might also have pointed out that when government ministers have finished 
flogging the people’s assets cheaply to private companies, they are legally 
allowed to accept lucrative directorships from those same companies. If that 
isn’t corruption in plain sight I don’t know what is.
