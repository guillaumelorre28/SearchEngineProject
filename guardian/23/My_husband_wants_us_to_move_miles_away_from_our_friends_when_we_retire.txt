After many years of wonderful holidays in Devon, my husband wants us to move 
there next year when we both retire (we currently live in Yorkshire). I know 
that he’s right – we are in a rut and need a change – but I’m worried about 
moving so far away from the close friends we’ve had for 30-plus years. My 
husband is a real joiner and has no doubts that he would cope, but I am shy and 
more introverted. Our only son is now settled in Australia and neither of us 
has brothers or sisters still living, so our friends are our only source of 
support (if we need it). Is it really possible (or even wise?) to start again 
in a different place after retirement? How easy is it in your 60s to make 
friends? Are we mad to make such a huge change at this stage in life?
