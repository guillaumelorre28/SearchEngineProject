 Aga Foodservice Group, the upmarket kitchen appliance maker, yesterday 
reported increased revenue and profit spurred by strong cooker sales.
Pre-tax profit rose 5% to £22m on revenues 8% higher at £273.9m. The company 
said the popularity of its Rangemaster product was a strong contributing 
factor, and its Stanley and Rayburn models boosted sales with their 
carbon-neutral wood-burning credentials. Despite the French distaste for 
English cooking, they are not averse to English stoves, as evidenced by sales 
under the Falcon brand in France.

William McGrath, chief executive, said Aga's food service operations, which 
contribute 40% to group turnover, had attracted interest from private equity 
buyers.
