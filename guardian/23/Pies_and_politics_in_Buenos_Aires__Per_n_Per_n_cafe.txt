Perón Perón Resto Bar  <https://www.facebook.com/ElPeronPeron>in Buenos Aires’ 
Palermo Hollywood district is fascinating food-wise and for its reflections of 
political history.

The Argentinian capital is home to five restaurants devoted to former 
president General Juan Domingo Perón and his wife, Eva. But meaningful 
memorabilia and indulgent comfort food make Perón Perón the preferred haunt for 
activists and foodies.

A space for peronista youths to discuss politics over the pastel de papas 
(shepherd’s pie, the general’s favourite dish),locro bean stew and malbec 
served in penguin jugs, this casual establishment is equally popular with
kirchneristas, adherents of the strand of Peronism created by the late Néstor 
Kirchner and his wife, outgoing president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

Amid supportive graffiti on the military green walls, the restaurant’s 
memorabilia includes a kitsch candlelit shrine to Evita, labourers’ attire and 
a sewing machine-turned beer dispenser – representing Evita’s social campaign 
to help mothers clothe their families.

When the regimental march blares mid-meal, you’ve got two options: keep 
eating, or join in, singing and table-slapping along with the packed house. Yet 
the singing might not be so loud if opposition candidate Mauricio Macri, 
current leader of the Buenos Aires city government, wins Argentina’s run-off 
election on 22 November. Macri made a considerable – and surprising – dent in 
the popularity of Fernández de Kirchner’s anointed incumbent, Daniel Scioli. 
Peronists might soon be eating on the defensive.
