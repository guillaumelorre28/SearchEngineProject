The director Kevin Smith has paid tribute to the actor Alan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-rickman>, who Smith called “one of my 
favourite people who ever lived”.

Smith directed Rickman as the voice of God in his 1999 film, Dogma, and in a 
Facebook post recounted how Rickman was “the first non-friend who signed up to 
the flick, but he became a great friend in record time”.

Smith also shared a photo of the actor behind the scenes, explaining: “In this 
pic, he holds the Ken doll his Dogma character’s lack of genitalia was modelled 
after.”

He continued: “I’ll never forget his incredible dulcet tones guffawing at the 
rubber crotch makeup he was wearing: one of the greatest actors who ever lived, 
tickled by a cinematic lack of a dick.”

Smith echoed the impression of many who worked with Rickman in highlighting 
the disparity between his dastardly roles and the actor’s own personality.

“I loved Hans Gruber the minute I saw #DieHard 
<https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/diehard> but I fell in love with the 
soft-spoken gentle soul who brought Gruber to life.”

Smith continued: “Thank you for lending a hack like me your artistry and your 
credibility, Alan. You were never Snape to me as much as you were the adult 
Harry Potter himself: a bonafide wizard who could conjure absolute magic using 
merely words.

“He was a HUGE cauldron of win, this man. I’ll miss him forever. Rest in 
Peace, Voice of God. Back to Heaven, where you came from …”

On Thursday, Smith shared another behind-the-scenes photo on Twitter to mark 
the actor’s passing.
