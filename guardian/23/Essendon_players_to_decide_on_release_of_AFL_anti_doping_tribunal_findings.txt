The AFL Players Association has warned it will take time for a decision on 
whether the AFL anti-doping tribunal findings are made public. Each of the 34 
acquittedEssendon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> players must 
separately decide whether he wants the lengthy document released.

Excerpts from the 130-plus page verdict have already found their way to the 
media. It was revealed late on Tuesday that the tribunal jury found Essendon’s 
record keeping of the 2012 supplements program at the club was deplorable.

But under anti-doping rules, when a player is found not guilty it is up to him 
whether the full finding is made public.

The tribunal handed down the verdicts on 34 current and past Essendon players 
in a closed hearing.AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> chief executive 
Gillon McLachlan hopes the findings will be made public.

“While the players’ legal team will certainly discuss with players the public 
release of the decision, we will need some time to have these discussions,” the 
players association said in a statement.

“These players, who have endured over two years of uncertainty, have only just 
received the decision. Many of them are preparing for their season opener in 
just three days’ time, whether in the AFL or in other leagues.

“Our immediate focus is on giving them the time and space to do so. Once the 
players have made their decision, the AFL will be advised.”
