8.22pm BST 

Well, that is it from my then for tonight. United drew their penultimate 
pre-season friendly 1-1 in a match that produced more questions than it 
answered. Nani and Jonny Evans were injured. Robin van Persie missed a host of 
chances on his 30th birthday. The good news? Nemanja Vidic came through 
unscathed. Five days until the Community Shield against Wigan and Moyes has 
plenty to ponder.

8.20pm BST 

Final score: AIK 1-1 Manchester United

The referee blows for full time.

8.19pm BST 

91 mins: Well, it is a friendly after all. We have, not one, but two men of 
the match: Mutumba (well-deserved) and Vidic (OK, then).

8.18pm BST 

90 mins: A United corner comes to nothing and it must be said that Van 
Persie's profligacy is a little bit of a worry. With Rooney - potentially - on 
his way out, Moyes will need RvP to score regularly.

8.17pm BST 

89 mins: Bébé is on fire! No, not literally. That would be some story. But his 
touch looks great and his crossing has been far better than that of Nani. This 
- inch-perfect I must say - reaches Van Persie but the striker misses his free 
header.

8.14pm BST 

86 mins: Carrick finds Welbeck with a glorious pass that flummoxed the whole 
AIK defence but the forward's first touch is poor and the goalkeeper Carlgren 
beats him to the ball.

8.12pm BST 

Henric Tiselius points out that half the AIK team are now youth team players. 
Maybe that is why Bébé is looking so good. But that is probably harsh on Bébe, 
because he has been better than some of the other United players since coming 
on.

8.10pm BST 

82 mins: Well, that was a glorious ball in from Bébé. Everyone thought the 
referee would blow for offside but he did not and Welbeck should have done 
better than the airshot he just produced there.

8.09pm BST 

I am not going to write off United and Moyes - that has proved foolish, very 
foolish in the past - but Bernard Denner writes: "Moyes is out of his depth, he 
could not pull his socks up nevermind pull in top players...man utd mid table. 
Champions yes, but the whole prem was poor last year."

Hmmm, maybe a tad early to say that...

8.06pm BST 

78 mins: A double substitution by United. Moyes sends on Danny Welbeck and 
Bébé for Wilfried Zaha and Ryan Giggs. Now that is some attack. Who needs Wayne 
Rooney, eh?

8.05pm BST 

77 mins: Giggs sends in a sumptuous corner but Van Persie - unmarked - misses 
with his header. He should have scored really.

8.03pm BST 

76 mins: Space is opening up all over the pitch and Sam Lundholm almost 
stumbles past the whole United defence but they can clear in the end. Then 
United win a corner.

8.01pm BST 

Emil Broberg has correctly emailed and said that Alhassan Kamara set up AIK's 
goal. I thank him for that.

8.00pm BST 

71 mins: The attendance is 30,012 (sounds a bit like an Arsenal bid for Luis 
Suárez). That leaves almost 20,000 unsold tickets. Not sure United will go back 
to those tight Scandinavians... Who doesn't want to pay 50 quid for a 
pre-season friendly, eh?

7.58pm BST 

71 mins: AIK are struggling suddenly. Look tired. Aren't they the ones who are 
supposed to be in the middle of their season. They look knackered.

7.57pm BST 

68 mins: United equalise and it is a good goal as well. Van Persie slams the 
free-kick into the wall but a United player (I thought it was Van Persie, Rio 
says it was Carrick, I'd trust Rio on this one...) finds Zaha on the right. The 
United No29 fires the ball across the area where Henríquez prods home.

7.55pm BST 

Goal! AIK 1-1 United (Henriquez, 68)

United are level.

7.55pm BST 

67 mins: Free-kick in a good position for United. Van Persie looks keen. 
Crowd's whistling.

7.54pm BST 

65 mins: As I write that United lack ideas, Van Persie finds Zaha with a 
beautiful little back-heel but the United newcomer is brought down in the area 
(well, that is my opinion at least). No penalty given. And then the AIK 
substitute goalkeeper Patrik Carlgren takes out Henríquez but gets something on 
the ball as well so the referee waves play on.

7.51pm BST 

63 mins: Half an hour to go and there's a lull. This is a little bit worrying 
for United actually. You can't judge a team by a pre-season friendly but they 
are certainly lacking ideas at this moment.

7.49pm BST 

62 mins: Finally something noteworthy by United. Rafael finds Zaha on the 
right and the youngster produces a wonderful cross, hit first time, with his 
right foot, but it just evades Van Persie.

7.48pm BST 

58 mins: Zaha produces a long line of stepovers, much like Denilson did in his 
day <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOkbxEVXrg>, but it comes to nothing. 
Giggs then crosses but Henríquez arrives too late.

7.45pm BST 

Filip Törnqvist emails with a good anecdote: "The award for the bravest/ most 
foolhardy player on the pitch must go to Martin Mutumba. When AIK won the 
league in 2009 he tattooed "A.I.K GULD 2LAX9" (AIK Gold 2009) on his chest... 
days before the deciding final game against rivals IFK Göteborg!

7.44pm BST 

56 mins: Ohhhhh. That was close. With a Gareth Bale/Cristiano Ronaldo-esque 
run-up, Bahoui hits the ball with the outside of his foot. It just misses the 
post with Amos well beaten.

7.42pm BST 

55 mins: AIK free-kick in decent position and Moyes does not look happy.

7.41pm BST 

54 mins: Vidic hits the bar with a header. He did everything right from 
Giggs's corner - apart from the fact that it was a few centimetres high.

7.41pm BST 

53 mins: Chris Smalling comes on for Jonny Evans. Evans limping quite heavily.

7.39pm BST 

52 mins: A goal down and now Jonny Evans is struggling with an injury. Looks 
like he is pointing to his ankle. Not a good few minutes for United. And Moyes 
will be worried about how easily his defence was opened up there. Ouch.

7.38pm BST 

50 mins: What a stunning goal by Robin Quaison. He combined quickly with 
Igboananike and suddenly had lots of space, evading Vidic cleverly and then 
unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner.

7.37pm BST 

Goal! AIK 1-0 Man Utd (Quaison, 49)

United are a goal down. 

Updated at 7.40pm BST

7.36pm BST 

48 mins: AIK have made three changes - well, they are in mid-season after all 
- with Per Karlsson, Robert Åhman Persson and Martin Lorentzson coming on.

7.34pm BST 

47 mins: United have made just one change at half-time (good news for me) as 
Ben Amos replaces Lindegaard in goal.

7.33pm BST 

Second half kicks off

The final 45 minutes are underway at the Friends Arena. Evra starts with a 
crunching tackle on an AIK player - I can't see who it is, the guy is in a heap 
- and it is a free-kick to the home side.

7.29pm BST 

It would be impossible to write about an AIK match this season without 
mentioning the terrible tragedy earlier this year when their goalkeeper Ivan 
Turina died. He was loved by everyone. Several moving tributes to the Croat has 
been written in Swedish. In English,this is well worth watching and reading 
<http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/aik-pay-emotional-tribute-keeper-ivan-turina-tragic-110858229.html>
.

7.23pm BST 

Half-time: Ah, Jesper Blomqvist is on MUTV, talking about the game. He looks 
the same as he did 10 years ago! What's the secret Jesper??? I used to love 
Blomqvist. Let's have a look at what he could do, shall we?

7.17pm BST 

Half-time

It's been a very entertaining half but it is still scoreless at half-time. 
Jonny Evans seems to be giving Rafael a tactical lesson as they walk off. It's 
not been a great half for the Brazilian.

7.15pm BST 

43 mins: Giggs takes the corner but it is too high. United then build from the 
back with a classy Carrick pass but Zaha's cross is again disappointing.

7.13pm BST 

42 mins: United win a corner as AIK's Alexander Milosevic is down with an 
injury.

7.11pm BST 

39 mins: Well, that was a lovely ball from Carrick to Henríquez, who responds 
with equally brilliant technique to bring the ball down but he is then - 
wrongly - adjudged to have been in an offside position.

7.09pm BST 

38 mins: That was poor again from Zaha. He had all the time in the world near 
the corner flag, looked up and hit the first possible AIK player with his 
cross. Still, United have a corner. Vidic is up.

7.08pm BST 

35 mins: Lindegaard has to be alert again. Robin Quaison plays in Igboananike, 
past Michael Carrick's (yes, he is playing) outstretched leg but the angle was 
tight and Lindegaard saved fairly easily. The corner comes to nothing.

7.04pm BST 

33 min: The tempo has gone down somewhat and it is not a great atmosphere here 
as the stadium is nowhere near full. Van Persie, suddenly out on the right, 
floats a cross in but it fails to find Zaha, suddenly on the left.

7.02pm BST 

31 mins: Angelo Henriquez is on as Nani's replacement. It is not clear what is 
wrong with the Portuguese winger but he will be disappointed because he had 
been United's best player so far.

7.00pm BST 

29 mins: Oh dear. Nani has just come off. Must be an injury.

6.58pm BST 

28 mins: Another Van Persie miss! And he should have scored from this one. 
Three yards out, he hits Stamatopoulos with his effort after being set up by 
Evra.

6.57pm BST 

26 mins: That's a superb save from Lindegaard. Rafael - again - is at fault as 
Mutumba finds Igboananike but the Danish goalkeeper made himself big and saved 
the one-on-one chance.

6.56pm BST 

23 min: A quarter of the match gone. Vidic just produces a towering header 
from the back. Boom! Another United move then breaks down. Giggs tries to find 
Van Persie, who had set out on an adventurous diagonal run, but fails to do so. 
Disappointing.

6.54pm BST 

Let's hope Simon McMahon doesn't work in a gift shop... He writes: "Good 
evening Marcus. What do you reckon Van Persie got for his birthday then? I 
mean, what do you get the man who's got everything. Well, if you're me, you get 
a mug that says 'I've got everything' on it, but I'm guessing RVP didn't get 
one of those ..."

6.52pm BST 

20 min: Two great United chances in the space of a minute. First Anderson sets 
up Van Persie with a clever flick but the AIK defender Niklas Backman's 
last-ditch tackle halts the Dutchman. Then Stamatopoulos produces a superb 
one-handed save to deny Van Persie.

6.50pm BST 

Tom Bradstreet has some advice for United: "Was at the Friends Arena on 
Saturday to see AIK play Celtic's CL qualifying opponents Elfsborg. AIK won 
2-1, but seemed to leave masses of space on the wings; Zaha could have some 
serious fun tonight if they don't fix that sharpish.
If that doesn't work, then United could do worse than whispering the name of 
Daniel Tjernstrom, the legendary AIK midfielder who played his last ever match 
on Saturday, into their opponents' ears in the hope of reducing them to a 
blubbering mass of tears. I'd recommend trying to get down the wings first, 
though. Emotional blackmail later."

6.49pm BST 

17 min: Zaha shows brilliant awareness to find Rafael on the right. The 
right-back storms down to the byline like an old-fashioned winger and sets up 
RvP. The Dutchman takes a step inside and unleashes a left-footed shot which … 
goes wide.

6.47pm BST 

15 min: First shot on target and it comes from the hosts. Mutumba dances past 
Rafael as if he wasn't there and then tests Lindegaard with a decent but 
ultimately unsuccessful shot. The Dane gathers easily.

6.45pm BST 

Is Rio not watching?

6.44pm BST 

12 min: United on the attack but AIK manage to scramble the ball away. Nani 
has started very brightly I must say. I really like him as a player, but there 
is always a feeling he could do more. As there, when he twice skins the 
right-back before finding AIK players with both his crosses.

6.42pm BST 

9 min: Zaha produces some fancy tricks in his own half. Is almost dispossessed 
by Martin Mutumba before Nils-Eric Johansson (formerly of Blackburn Rovers and 
Leicester City, as you may or may not remember) simply pushes him over with a 
face that says: "That's not how we play football in Sweden."

6.39pm BST 

7 min: Good chance for AIK. Patrice Evra gets drawn inside and Nabil Bahoui 
has time to aim but sends his shot just wide of Anders Lindegaard's right-hand 
post.

6.36pm BST 

5 min: A woeful miss by Zaha. Anderson and Nani exchanged passes down the 
right before the latter set up Zaha in the area but the former Palace player 
stumbled and shot wide and high with his left foot.

6.35pm BST 

4 min: Two United attacks in the past two minutes. First Evra down the left, 
but his low cross evaded everyone. Then Zaha and Giggs combined on the right 
but that too came to nothing. Giggs had acres of space in the AIK area there.

6.33pm BST 

2 min: Wilfried Zaha displays some of his tricks early doors but the AIK 
players seem unimpressed and take the ball off him. Rafael then launches a long 
ball forwards, which the birthday boy chases but the AIK goalkeeper Kyriakos 
Stamatopoulos collects.

6.32pm BST 

1 min: The match has begun and United comfortably play the ball around in 
their own half to start off with.

6.30pm BST 

The teams are out on the pitch and we are ready to kick-off.

6.27pm BST 

It looks like a 4-3-3 for United tonight and it will be interesting to see how 
the midfield three do. United will also be delighted to have Nemanja Vidic back 
at the heart of the defence. Oh, and it is Van Persie's birthday today.

6.24pm BST 

6.19pm BST 

Gary Naylor emails: "I see that AIK have a Borges in the midfield. Football 
needs more postmodernist writers turning out in pre-season friendlies don't you 
think? Mind you, the Rooney story is harder to follow than one of the 
Argentine's."

6.18pm BST 

AIK starting line-up: Stamatopoulos; Ofori, Milosevic, Backman, Johansson; 
Bahoui, Borges, Moro, Mutumba; Quaison, Igboananike.

6.14pm BST 

United substitutes: Amos, Smalling, Jones, Bébé, Henriquez, Welbeck.

6.12pm BST 

So the United team is in. And it is a strong one: Lindegaard; Rafael, Evans, 
Vidic, Evra; Anderson, Carrick, Giggs; Zaha, Van Persie, Nani.

6.07pm BST 

AIK are currently unbeaten in 10 competitive games, having won eight and drawn 
two with a pretty respectable goal difference of 20-8. And they have the 
wonderfully named Ebenezer Ofori probably making his debut for the club. United 
have been warned...

5.59pm BST 

So what are United up against then? First of all, let's just make it clear 
that the team they are facing are called AIK. That's it. Three, capped up 
letters. They are not AIK Stockholm and they are notAIK Solna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aiksolna>. Calling them that would be 
like calling Arsenal "Arsenal London", which they do in Germany. By the way, in 
Italy Bayern Munich are Bayern Monaco, which is just utterly confusing.

5.55pm BST 

In the meantime, you can have a look at this YouTube clip of Manchester 
United's last competitive game in Sweden - if I am correct - against IFK 
Gothenburg during the 1994-95 season. There's nothing from the actual game, 
which United lost 3-1, but it is worth watching for a few things, such as 
Reebok affording to sponsor Champions League coverage, and Terry Venables first 
answer to a question which isn't really a question.

5.44pm BST 

And the big ones just keep coming … Tonight it is Wayne Rooney-less Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> against Swedish 
side AIK in a pre-season friendly in Stockholm.

United are only two warm-up games away from the season starting (they face 
Sevilla at Old Trafford on Friday) with the Community Shield against Wigan on 
Sunday. So maybe, just maybe, we will see a little bit more of what will be 
David Moyes's starting line-up when the league campaign starts. But with Bébé 
in the squad who knows?

5.21pm BST 

Marcus will be here from 6pm. In the meantime, if you can be bothered, read 
the latest on the Wayne Rooney transfer saga.

Rooney prepared to submit transfer request at United

Wayne Rooney <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney> is prepared 
to take onManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> and issue a formal 
transfer request to try to force the club to change their mind and allow him 
the move he wants toChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>.

Rooney is increasingly thinking he will have to take the initiative after 
United revealed they had turned down a second bid from Stamford Bridge – an 
initial £25m with another £5m in potential add-ons – and categorically stated 
that the striker would not get his wish. "He is not for sale," a club spokesman 
said.

The Premier League champions insist their stance will not change, that this is 
not merely a bargaining technique and that Rooney needs to buckle down and 
start preparing for a World Cup season.

That was followed by Rooney pulling out of the pre-season fixture against AIK 
in Stockholm on Tuesday, the official explanation being that he has a shoulder 
injury. Rooney, who had returned early from the club's summer tour after citing 
a hamstring strain, has not played since the end of last season and is a major 
doubt for England's game against Scotland at Wembley on Wednesday week.
