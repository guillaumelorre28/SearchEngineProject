I am in the backseat of a pickup truck that is driving down the Atlantic coast 
of Patagonia. The dry, grassy terrain of Argentina’s Chubut province doesn’t 
seem to change, except for the occasional herds of sheep and roaming gangs of 
wild horses, guanacos and pumas.

“See the valley we are approaching,” says my friend Martin. He has taken the 
same 150km route from the city of Trelew to Cabo Raso more than 100 times. 
“Once we reach it, we will lose mobile phone signal for the next few days.”

As we veer off the smooth motorway on to the gravel Route 1, I scramble to set 
up an out-of-office message via my phone: “Hola! I’m lost somewhere in 
Patagonia, away from civilisation, stuffing my face with meat and without 
access to internet. I’ll be back to the real world on Thursday.”

 Buses on the lawn at Cabo Raso 
Cabo Raso is a coastal village that has become a refuge for fisherman, algae 
collectors, drifters, and travellers looking to escape the city and connect 
with nature. The water, renowned for its purity, is the source of a quality sea 
salt, Sal de Aquí, and the strong waves attract surfers from around the world.

Abandoned for many years, Cabo Raso was rebuilt in 2007 by Eduardo González, 
who is known as El Gitano (the Gypsy), and his partner Eliane Fernández. I 
heard about this mysterious ghost town from locals during Morfilandia, a food 
festival in the nearby town of Rawson – and a few hours later, they convinced 
me to take the detour to go and see it.

“This is where we come to relax,” Martin says as we approach El Cabo, a 
structure decorated with a hand-painted map of the coastline made of adobe, 
stones, and metal scraps. It is the only inhabited town within 100km; I see 
blue sky and a lot of desolate, empty space. This is the retreat I need, to 
completely disconnect, escape the stress of chaotic Buenos Aires and experience 
tranquillity. On a lawn lie two rusting decades-old buses, two smaller stone 
houses, and one swing, all less than 20 metres from the shore. We are greeted 
by barking dogs, a briny ocean breeze, and Eliane and El Gitano in the main 
house’s kitchen with yerba mate tea and a homemade fruit crumble fresh from the 
stove.

 A kitchen in one of Cabo Raso’s private houses. 
In the mid-20th century, Cabo Raso was home to more than 300 people – families 
of fishermen, farmers and wool traders. It had a boarding school, a post 
office, a convenience store, a cemetery, and a hotel – and was a summer holiday 
destination. But Argentina modernised and the town declined: residents moved 
away, and buildings began to crumble.

In 1987, Mercedes Finat, the last resident, died and the village lay deserted 
until Eliane and El Gitano arrived 20 years later. The pair revived the natural 
wonderland – and brought the population up to two. They had decided to swap 
city life for the countryside, and came across the vacant 120-hectare oceanside 
village. Over the next year, they cleared rubbish, planted trees, pruned the 
farmland, and reconstructed the ruins into eco-friendly lodgings.

Before I can even unload my bags from the truck, Eliane gives me a tour of the 
town. “A lot of the houses were ruined, without a roof, just disintegrating,” 
she says. “We honour the town. We don’t build anything new; we only refurbish 
what is already here.”

They use water from a well, and generate power from the sun and wind. “We live 
simply and sustainably.” She takes me into a common area with two long tables 
and a deep brick fireplace, “This is where we eat our meals together and 
barbecue all the meat.”

 A seal by the shore 
The grounds are dotted with lodging options: inside the main house are several 
dormitories (private and shared) with a communal bathroom, while outside are 
two more dorms – inside those weathered buses. The private houses have one 
double and four single beds, a kitchen, bathroom with hot water, a wood-burner, 
and electricity. Most of the surfers and fisherman bring sleeping bags for a 
more rustic (and affordable) stay inside the ranch. The camping site, about a 
kilometre away, uses an ex-military bunker as its base camp.

I see blue sky and a lot of desolate, empty space. This is the retreat I need, 
to completely disconnect

“There is always something to do,” El Gitano says as he takes us on a tour of 
the land. He brings us to a bay with dozens of elephant seals and sea wolves 
basking in the sun on top of hot stones. This is a prime spot for surfing, but 
today the waves are tame. While there are numerous activities at El Cabo, such 
as kayaking, fishing, biking and trekking, I decide to explore the town, which 
takes about 45 minutes on foot. A non-functional lighthouse, shipwrecked 
fishing boat, and the bunker (a site built to test-launch missiles during the 
Cold War’sOperation Condor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor>), 
are the main landmark attractions.

I return just before dark. About 20 people – Eliane and El Gitano’s children, 
friends, guests and workers – gather around the wooden table in the living 
room. We are strangers, yet there is a strong sense of community. Wine is 
plentiful and I am mesmerised by the massive pork leg roasting in the 
fireplace. An intense game oftruco (cards) is taking place, and in the next 
room there is a spiritedmetegol (table football) tournament. Then there is 
calm; I can just hear the wind, the waves, and a lot of laughter. The only 
light outside comes from the moon and stars.

“We have a peaceful home: the ocean, delicious food, and nothing else,” Eliane 
says with a smile. “A burning fire and good company – that’s all we need now.”

El Cabo is on Route 1 (at KM294 in Chubut). It is only accessible by car. 
Transportation can be arranged with El Cabo, fromPuerto Madryn, for about £172 
return. Accommodation costs from £7 a night for basic lodgings and £96 a night 
for private houses, +54 280 15 4 70 9080,caboraso.com.ar

 View of Iya Valley in autumn. Photograph: Alamy 
In contrast to the towering, illuminated skyscrapers and hi-tech 
infrastructure of Japan’s major cities, the Iya Valley is perhaps one of the 
most isolated regions of the country. On the southern island of Shikoku (the 
smallest and least-visited of the main four), the valley is laced with vine 
bridges and dotted with small villages and hot springs. It’s so remote that it 
has a history as a hideout for defeated warriors during the 12th century. A 
range of budget accommodation and campsites around the valley, such as the 
basic, vegetarian eco-guesthouse Ku Nel Asob or Iyakei Camp Village, make a 
good base to explore the mountain trails.

hamlet of Supai has a population of just 208. You understand quite how detached

delivered by mule train. And mule makes up one of the three ways you can reach 
it: the other two being via an eight-mile hike from the nearest road, or by 
helicopter. From here you can explore the stunning wild west geographical 
features of Havasu Creek, which is dotted with dramatic waterfalls. Tourism 
provides an important means of income for the Havasupai tribe, which owns and 
manages the 24-room Havasupai Lodge - the only lodging for 75 miles – and 
provides guides and mule packing services.
