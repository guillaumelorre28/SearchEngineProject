Baywatch 

Dwayne Johnson’s pecs lead the way in a funned-up reboot of the 
jiggling-swimsuit TV series, all about those hardworking LA lifeguards.

Beatriz at Dinner 

Mike White and Miguel Arteta have serious pedigree (Chuck & Buck/Good Girl) 
and this is their new collaboration: health workerSalma Hayek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/salma-hayek> meets smarmy high-net-worther 
John Lithgow in a life-changing encounter.

The Discovery 

This sounds unclassifiably mad: set in a world where the afterlife has been 
verified, Jason Segel falls in love withRooney Mara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara> while millions of people kill 
themselves. Funny weird, we’re guessing.

The House 

A married couple lose their kid’s college fund, so naturally set up a casino 
in their basement.Will Ferrell <https://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell> 
and Amy Poehler star, need we say more?

Lost in London 

Woody Harrelson’s directorial debut, inspired by his real-life night in the 
cells in 2002. To add to the excitement: he’ll screen the whole thing live, as 
it’s being shot.

Rock That Body 

This looks like it could be a female version of Very Bad Things: a 
bachelorette party goes very wrong when the male stripper turns up dead.
Scarlett Johansson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson> leads 
the line; Ghostbusters’ Kate McKinnon and Fantastic Beasts’ Zoe Kravitz are 
among the buddies.

Tully 

Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/diablo-cody> have reunited with their Young 
Adult star Charlize Theron; she plays a mother who bonds with a night nanny 
called Tully. May not sound immediately riveting, but these are classy 
film-makers, so should be good.

Wilson 

Daniel “Ghost World” Clowes’ graphic novel about a blunt-speaking misanthrope 
gets the film treatment, withWoody Harrelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/woody-harrelson> in the title role, and Laura 
Dern as his estranged wife. Expect Clowes’ trademark bittersweet wit.

Yeh Din Ka Kissa 

Despite its Hindi title (translating as The Story of the Day) this is a very 
New Yorky yarn from Noah Baumbach, with a very Baumbach cast:Dustin Hoffman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman>, Ben Stiller, Emma Thompson 
and Adam Sandler. Looks great.
