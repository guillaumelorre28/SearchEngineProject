For independent film director and horror music savant John Carpenter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-carpenter>, the impetus for his first 
proper studio album, Lost Themes, began when the director was eight years old. 
In Bowling Green, Kentucky, he queued up at the local cinema with a cereal box 
ticket for Fred M Wilcox’s much-anticipated MGM space odyssey Forbidden Planet, 
unaware of the impact the film would have on his life.

 “It was an epic, Cinemascope space adventure,” Carpenter explains by phone 
from Los Angeles. “And the score was completely electronic.”

“The way the sounds and images were married together. I cannot tell you how 
profound that was. I had just never heard anything like that. I saw it and I 
said, ‘I want to do that for a living.’”


 His father was a music professor and listened to classical music, and 
Carpenter says classical was the soundtrack to his early life. But it was the 
distinctive scores of Louis and Bebe Barron, Dmitri Tiomkin and Bernard 
Herrmann that turned his attention from Bach and Mozart to the modern music of 
the cinema. “Film music is really different than other forms of music because 
it’s coupled with an image, which is what gives it its power. Even after all 
these years, I can still pick out a Tiomkin score.”

 A violin and piano dilettante who once performed in a local garage band 
called Kaleidoscope, Carpenter’s true aptitude for music began to flourish when 
scoring his late 70s and early 80s films, Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween and 
Escape from New York. Like the disturbing images they accompanied, Carpenter’s 
electronic soundtracks were distinguished by their evocations of dread and 
dystopia, often with the employment of a snaking, keyboard riff and a pulsating 
synth bass.

 “Composing came out of necessity, because I had to,” Carpenter says of his 
now classic scores. “If you made a low-budget film or a student film in the old 
days, you didn’t have money. We couldn’t hire an orchestra or a studio to 
record an orchestra. But I knew I could sound sort of big with a synthesizer. 
With enough tracks, you could actually sound like something.”

 As an album of scores inspired by ‘imaginary’ films, Lost Themes does not 
stray far from the template Carpenter created all those years ago, but it is, 
nonetheless, an affecting sampler of miniature symphonies. Using updated 
keyboards, digital plug-ins and Pro Logic software, the proudly old-fangled 
musician still managed to capture the rounded, analog tones of his original 
scores. Opener Vortex re-imagines the sci-fi death-disco of Escape from New 
York with such enthusiasm that it’s tempting to picture Snake Plissken’s 
gnarled visage hovering over a burning, post-apocalyptic wasteland. Tracks like 
the appropriately titled Mystery and Wraith mine the slasher territory of Dario 
Argento’s Suspiria (which was scored by Italian prog rockers Goblin) and 
Carpenter’s own Halloween anthem with chilling results. The lilting Night 
closes the album in a somber fusion of bass and icy atmospherics reminiscent of 
The Thing.

 Though devoted fans of the director will no doubt take pleasure in matching 
up vintage Carpenter scenes with the new musical offerings, Carpenter himself 
is adamant that the songs were beholden to nothing but his own active 
imagination.

 “The whole making of Lost Themes was just joyous,” he says. “I did not have 
to be a slave to the image. It was only the music.”

Part of the pleasure of the process was the addition of Carpenter’s musician 
son, Cody, and godson, Daniel Davies, to the album’s personnel. The two-year 
recording session originated in marathon bouts of Borderlands and Assassin’s 
Creed video games played between father and son.

 “The improvisations started with rock ‘n roll and blues,” he continues. 
“After we did that a while, we suddenly started scoring. We’d play video games, 
then go downstairs and play music. Then go back to the video games, and then 
play music. And suddenly we had 60 minutes of music done.”

 Waxing humorously about his own stature within a musical genre he helped to 
create and popularise, Carpenter admits that he knows little of the legions of 
contemporary electronic musicians he has inspired such as Autechre, Oneohtrix 
Point Never and Cliff Martinez.

“I have no idea who you are talking about,” he laughs. “The only tribute I 
ever got was in some low rent wrestling circuit. There was this Samoan Swat 
team that came out, and they played the Halloween theme on a cheap boom box.”

 When asked his opinion of electronic music’s millennial trends toward 
miniaturization and microbeats, Carpenter says: “It all sounds thin to me. I’m 
thinking, don’t they have the same plug-ins that I do? Dude, you can play 
orchestras now, are you kidding me?”

“I’m just this old-school person who took a crappy synthesizer and made a 
score for a movie. But other people don’t approach it like I do. I’m making 
orchestral music with electronic sounds. They are making electronic music with 
electronic sounds. There’s a difference. The only inspiration I provide to 
these other composers is when they listen to my stuff, they say, ‘My God, if 
that guy can score a movie, I can be Stravinsky!’”

 Regardless of Carpenter’s self-deprecation, Lost Themes demonstrates why the 
master of horror continues his reign as one of the masters of the electronic 
genre as well.

Master of Fear season is on at Brooklyn Academy of Music from 5 to 22 February
