Closing summary: Carney surprises everyone

It’s been a long old day, and quite a dramatic one as Mark Carney’s future 
came to a head faster than most experts expected.

No-one really predicted that the BoE governor would split the difference 
between his fans, and his critics, andplump to do an extra 12 months duty at 
Threadneedle Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5817816de4b0219a00d3ab06#block-5817816de4b0219a00d3ab06>
.

That’s why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly, with the government 
insisting it’s good news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58179678e4b01c528432eb63#block-58179678e4b01c528432eb63>
, but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in 2019.

Sir Martin Sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it 
was ‘a pity’ that Carney wouldn’t be at the helm until 2021 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-581791a2e4b0219a00d3ab51#block-581791a2e4b0219a00d3ab51>
.

Whatever you think about the European Union, there’s an argument that it’s 
better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the Brexit 
negotiations. Now, the Treasury has almost three years to find the perfect 
candidate to replace Carney on 1 July 2019 and help steer Britain into its 
post-EU future.

The immediate reaction from the City is still quite positive, with the pound 
up 0.6 of a cent at $1.2245.

We’ll may find out one day how hard Theresa May fought to keep Carney, or 
whether this compromise really suits all parties.

We may also find out whether the governor still has serious political 
ambitions back in Canada. Several commentators, including Bloomberg’s Jill 
Ward, have suggested he has an eye on the next federal elections, which are due 
in late 2019....

With that, I’m wrapping up for the night. Larry Elliott’s full story on 
Carney’s decision is now live. Here’s a flavour:

Mark Carney to serve extra year as Bank of England governor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor>

Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has ended weeks 
of speculation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/mark-carney-may-announce-decision-to-quit-thursday-bank-of-england>
 about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England 
untilBrexit  <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>negotiations 
with the EU have ended in 2019.

Despite being urged by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the chancellor, 
Philip Hammond, to serve a full eight-year term at Threadneedle Street, until 
2021, Carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year. He
started in the job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/01/mark-carney-tube-bank-england-governor>
 in July 2013.

The governor said in a letter to Hammond that he had intended to leave the 
Bank for personal reasons after five years, but the altered landscape for the 
UK following the vote in June to leave the EU had caused him to change his 
mind.....

Economists give a cautious welcome

Elizabeth Martins, an economist with HSBC, has dubbed Carney’s decision a 
halfway house (which is a relief, as I plumped for that term earlier :)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58178a9be4b08d944ba4cb53#block-58178a9be4b08d944ba4cb53>
).

She says:

“I guess that markets would have liked to see a 2021 extension, and expected 
it given indications in the media. But this will go down better than an earlier 
departure.”

(that’s via Reuters)

And Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has given the news “two cheers out of 
three”, and suggests Carney’s detractors should rein themselves in:

Now that Mr. Carney has made his intentions clear, it is to be hoped that 
everyone gives the Governor maximum support, including his critics.

The UK faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all 
policymakers. Matters will not be helped by sniping at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> Governor or making 
statements that seemingly question at the Bank of England’s independence

He told Reuters that:

Some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs aren’t best pleased that Mark Carney will 
remain at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> until 2019, says 
the City AM newspaper.

One leading Tory brexiteer told them that:


My sense is that if [Carney] is going to stay to 2019 he needs to find a way 
to row in behind the Prime Minister and start to find a way to be a bit more 
positive.

I would like him to stay and do a good job, and demonstrate some enthusiasm 
for leaving the EU, seeing as we are going to.

Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, suggests Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has played the game rather 
well....
Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) 
A cynic might suggest Carney has just extended his effective term and made 
himself immune to political criticism.

Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is 
pleased thatMark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has 
decided his future.

But he’s also concerned that his replacement (whoever she or he is) will take 
over at a critical time:

”Businesses want stability at a time of economic change, particularly at key 
institutions like theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor>.

Firms will be reassured that the recent speculation over the timing and nature 
of Mark Carney’s departure has been put to rest. However, the Governor will 
still be leaving at a sensitive time for the economy - so businesses will want 
to see a clear and ordered transition plan.”

May: Carney's decision is good news for UK

British prime minister Theresa May has welcomes Mark Carney’s decision to 
extend his term at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> by one year.

May’s spokeswoman says (via Reuters).

 “The prime minister welcomes the governor’s decision to stay on beyond his 
initial five-year term.

This is good news for the UK. It will provide continuity and stability at the 
Bank of England as we negotiate our exit from the European Union and look to 
take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit will present.”

However, there’s no word on whether May would rather Carney had stayed until 
2021.

Tyrie: Carney has a lot of explaining to do....

Andrew Tyrie, the influential chair of parliament’s Treasury Committee, is 
determined to find out whyMark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> is only going to serve a six 
year term.

And he’s promising to ask the governor a lot of searching questions when they 
next face each other....

The much needed clarification is welcome. The less uncertainty the better. 
Still, the Treasury Committee concluded in November 2011 that a non-renewable 
term of 8 years for the post of Governor was appropriate. The Government 
agreed, and changed the law in the Financial Services Act 2012, in line with 
the recommendation.

 In making this announcement, the Government and the Governor are sticking 
neither to the timetable set out in the exchange of letters, nor returning to 
the statute. More uncertainty needs to be avoided. So the decision requires a 
good deal of examination and explanation, which the Committee will seek when it 
next sees the Governor in a fortnight.

Sorrell: Carney may be hurt by unjustified criticism
 Photograph: Sky News 
Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, is disappointed that Carney 
won’t stay on until 2021.

Sorrell told Sky News that “one year is better than nothing... but it’s 
disappointing that he won’t serve his full term.”

“Maybe he was a little bit bruised by the criticism, I think unjustified 
criticism, that he’s been subjected to,” Sorrell said.

Sorrell also warned that it will be “touch and go” as to whether the UK has 
finished the Brexit negotiations by June 2019.

Chris Chapman, a London-based trader at Manulife Asset Management, has told 
Bloomberg that the City ought to welcome Carney’s decision:


“Carney is a respected central banker and overall I’d say that him staying 
with the BOE until 2019 would be seen as a positive for the country, but again, 
near term there are so many other factors weighing on the pound.

Carney smart. He's leaving in 2019, before Brexit actually takes effect. He's

It’s been a long old day, and quite a dramatic one as Mark Carney’s future 
came to a head faster than most experts expected.

No-one really predicted that the BoE governor would split the difference 
between his fans, and his critics, andplump to do an extra 12 months duty at 
Threadneedle Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5817816de4b0219a00d3ab06#block-5817816de4b0219a00d3ab06>
.

That’s why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly, with the government 
insisting it’s good news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58179678e4b01c528432eb63#block-58179678e4b01c528432eb63>
, but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in 2019.

Sir Martin Sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it 
was ‘a pity’ that Carney wouldn’t be at the helm until 2021 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-581791a2e4b0219a00d3ab51#block-581791a2e4b0219a00d3ab51>
.

Whatever you think about the European Union, there’s an argument that it’s 
better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the Brexit 
negotiations. Now, the Treasury has almost three years to find the perfect 
candidate to replace Carney on 1 July 2019 and help steer Britain into its 
post-EU future.

The immediate reaction from the City is still quite positive, with the pound 
up 0.6 of a cent at $1.2245.

We’ll may find out one day how hard Theresa May fought to keep Carney, or 
whether this compromise really suits all parties.

We may also find out whether the governor still has serious political 
ambitions back in Canada. Several commentators, including Bloomberg’s Jill 
Ward, have suggested he has an eye on the next federal elections, which are due 
in late 2019....

With that, I’m wrapping up for the night. Larry Elliott’s full story on 
Carney’s decision is now live. Here’s a flavour:

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor>

Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has ended weeks 
of speculation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/mark-carney-may-announce-decision-to-quit-thursday-bank-of-england>
 about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England 
untilBrexit  <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>negotiations 
with the EU have ended in 2019.

Despite being urged by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the chancellor, 
Philip Hammond, to serve a full eight-year term at Threadneedle Street, until 
2021, Carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year. He
started in the job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/01/mark-carney-tube-bank-england-governor>
 in July 2013.

The governor said in a letter to Hammond that he had intended to leave the 
Bank for personal reasons after five years, but the altered landscape for the 
UK following the vote in June to leave the EU had caused him to change his 
mind.....

Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
Elizabeth Martins, an economist with HSBC, has dubbed Carney’s decision a 
halfway house (which is a relief, as I plumped for that term earlier :)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58178a9be4b08d944ba4cb53#block-58178a9be4b08d944ba4cb53>
).

She says:

“I guess that markets would have liked to see a 2021 extension, and expected 
it given indications in the media. But this will go down better than an earlier 
departure.”

(that’s via Reuters)

And Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has given the news “two cheers out of 
three”, and suggests Carney’s detractors should rein themselves in:

Now that Mr. Carney has made his intentions clear, it is to be hoped that 
everyone gives the Governor maximum support, including his critics.

The UK faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all 
policymakers. Matters will not be helped by sniping at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> Governor or making 
statements that seemingly question at the Bank of England’s independence
 
Some Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> trivia, from 
Newnight’s Lewis Goodall:
Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) 
If you were wondering this makes Carney the shortest-serving Governor of the 
Bank of England since Leslie O'Brien in the 60s. You weren't?Oh

Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who clashed with Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> at several parliamentary 
hearings, doesn’t appear very happy with tonight’s news.


He told Reuters that:

“I think the uncertainty was bad, but I still think he ought to have gone 
because of his bias over Brexit.”
 
Some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs aren’t best pleased that Mark Carney will 
remain at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> until 2019, says 
the City AM newspaper.

One leading Tory brexiteer told them that:


My sense is that if [Carney] is going to stay to 2019 he needs to find a way 
to row in behind the Prime Minister and start to find a way to be a bit more 
positive.

I would like him to stay and do a good job, and demonstrate some enthusiasm 
for leaving the EU, seeing as we are going to.

Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, suggests Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has played the game rather 
well....
Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) 
A cynic might suggest Carney has just extended his effective term and made 
himself immune to political criticism.

Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is 
pleased thatMark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> has 
decided his future.

But he’s also concerned that his replacement (whoever she or he is) will take 
over at a critical time:

”Businesses want stability at a time of economic change, particularly at key 
institutions like theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor>.

Firms will be reassured that the recent speculation over the timing and nature 
of Mark Carney’s departure has been put to rest. However, the Governor will 
still be leaving at a sensitive time for the economy - so businesses will want 
to see a clear and ordered transition plan.”
 
An interesting reaction from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock, the asset manager.
Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) 
In classic Carney style, by choosing 6 years he has managed to ensure that he 
was right and everyone else was wrong

<https://twitter.com/rbrharrison/status/793165270596681728> 
Harrison is a former advisor to George Osborne, who appointed Carney in the 
first place.
 
British prime minister Theresa May has welcomes Mark Carney’s decision to 
extend his term at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> by one year.

May’s spokeswoman says (via Reuters).

 “The prime minister welcomes the governor’s decision to stay on beyond his 
initial five-year term.

This is good news for the UK. It will provide continuity and stability at the 
Bank of England as we negotiate our exit from the European Union and look to 
take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit will present.”

However, there’s no word on whether May would rather Carney had stayed until 
2021.
 
Zing!

Congratulations to Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> for finally delivering a 
piece of forward guidance that the markets can understand.

Andrew Tyrie, the influential chair of parliament’s Treasury Committee, is 
determined to find out whyMark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> is only going to serve a six 
year term.

And he’s promising to ask the governor a lot of searching questions when they 
next face each other....

The much needed clarification is welcome. The less uncertainty the better. 
Still, the Treasury Committee concluded in November 2011 that a non-renewable 
term of 8 years for the post of Governor was appropriate. The Government 
agreed, and changed the law in the Financial Services Act 2012, in line with 
the recommendation.

 In making this announcement, the Government and the Governor are sticking 
neither to the timetable set out in the exchange of letters, nor returning to 
the statute. More uncertainty needs to be avoided. So the decision requires a 
good deal of examination and explanation, which the Committee will seek when it 
next sees the Governor in a fortnight.
 
The CBI’s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, says Carney has given us a 
Halloween treat:
Alpesh Paleja (@AlpeshPaleja) 
Trick or treat? Mark #Carney <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Carney?src=hash> to 
stay on until June 2019 (it's a treat, in case you're wondering).

Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, is disappointed that Carney 
won’t stay on until 2021.

Sorrell told Sky News that “one year is better than nothing... but it’s 
disappointing that he won’t serve his full term.”

“Maybe he was a little bit bruised by the criticism, I think unjustified 
criticism, that he’s been subjected to,” Sorrell said.

Sorrell also warned that it will be “touch and go” as to whether the UK has 
finished the Brexit negotiations by June 2019.
 
Chris Chapman, a London-based trader at Manulife Asset Management, has told 
Bloomberg that the City ought to welcome Carney’s decision:


“Carney is a respected central banker and overall I’d say that him staying 
with the BOE until 2019 would be seen as a positive for the country, but again, 
near term there are so many other factors weighing on the pound.

well-timed.
James Mackintosh (@jmackin2) 
Carney smart. He's leaving in 2019, before Brexit actually takes effect. He's 
cleaned up one too many crises already.
