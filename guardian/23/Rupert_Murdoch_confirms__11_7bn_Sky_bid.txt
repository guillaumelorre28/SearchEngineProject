Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its £11.7bn bid to take 
full control of Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/14/formal-bid-for-sky-by-murdochs-21st-century-fox-thought-imminent>
, as minority shareholders call for transparency on how the pay-TV company’s 
independent directors came to accept the offer.

Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values 
Sky at more than £18bn and which would give him control of pay-TV operations in 
the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to ownership of the Times, Sunday Times 
and Sun, and the radio group TalkSport.


Fox has not raised the initial £10.75 per share offer it tabled on Friday. A 
number of shareholders and City analysts have accused Sky of selling on the 
cheap, pointing out that the company’s shares were at the offer level as 
recently as February.

A committee of Sky’s independent directors, led by Martin Gilbert – the 
broadcaster’s deputy chairman and the chief executive of Sky shareholder 
Aberdeen Asset Management – scrutinised the deal on behalf of non-Murdoch 
investors.

The committee, which unanimously accepted the deal, included the Sky chief 
executive, Jeremy Darroch, and the finance chief, Andrew Griffith, who arein 
line for a £40m payday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/sky-executives-share-bonanza-rupert-murdoch-21st-century-fox-buyout>
 if the deal goes through.

“We would urge the independent committee of Sky directors, who recommended 
that shareholders accept the offer, to share more information on the 
independent financial advice that they based their agreement on,” said Richard 
Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which controls 
£62m of Sky shares. “Such disclosure would help shareholders assess the 
fairness of the offer and give greater confidence in the independence of the 
committee in the bid process.”

Other shareholders to have expressed concern over the terms of the deal 
include Standard Life, Jupiter Asset Management and the Local Authority Pension 
Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, which 
has called for“robust” safeguards to protect Sky’s “future probity” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/murdoch-deal-sky-shareholders--ofcom-fox>
 under full ownership by Murdoch.

Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide 
whether the deal raises public interest concerns, specifically relating to 
media plurality.


Bradley is likely to ask regulator Ofcom to launch an investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/pressure-grows-to-refer-rupert-murdochs-sky-bid-to-ofcom>
 to determine whether Murdoch will have too much control over news media in the 
UK.

Ofcom will have up to 40 working days to file its public interest report on 
the deal, assuming Bradley asks the media regulator to investigate.


Lachlan Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, said: “We are 
excited to bring Sky fully into21st Century Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/21st-century-fox>. Partial ownership of Sky 
was not natural end state for us. Fully combining the businesses is a clear 
logical next step of portfolio evolution.

“It adds the strength of the Sky brand to our portfolio including Fox, 
National Geographic and Star brands. Considering the complete set of options in 
respect of capital allocation, this transaction provides the most attractive 
returns of for 21st Century Fox shareholders.”

Fox has said that if the deal is not done by the end of next year it will pay 
shareholders a sweetener of a 10p special dividend, which will equate to about 
£172m. However, Fox has said shareholders will not receive any dividend 
payments next year.


Previously, Sky’s 10.75p per share offer was due to be reduced by taking off 
shareholder dividend payments next year.


Fox has said that if the deal falls through it will pay a £200m break fee. In 
2011, News Corporationpaid a break fee of about £38.5m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/13/news-corp-pulls-out-of-bskyb-bid>
 after pulling out of its bid as the phone-hacking scandal engulfed Murdoch’s 
UK newspapers.

Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said the government should refer the 
deal to regulators. “This bid was abandoned in the wake of the phone-hacking 
scandal, and now it’s back,” he said. “The secretary of state must refer the 
bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it would result in too much media power being 
concentrated in too few hands, and whether Rupert and James Murdoch are fit and 
proper persons to run a broadcaster.

“The government cannot be allowed to ditch the vital second part of the 
Leveson inquiry, which would look at questions around unlawful or improper 
conduct within the Murdoch empire, at exactly the moment whenRupert Murdoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> is attempting once again to 
strengthen his hold over the UK media.”

The campaign group Hacked Off has launched a petition 
<http://hackinginquiry.takeaction.org.uk/petition/murdochbids4sky> to lobby 
Bradley to refer the deal to regulators. The petition cites issues including the
scathing findings of Ofcom’s investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-fit-and-proper-ofcom-james-murdoch>
 into James Murdoch’s conduct as chief executive of the publisher of the now 
defunct News of the World at the time of the phone-hacking scandal.

James Murdoch, now chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky, 
said he believed the deal “passes regulatory muster” in both Europe and the UK.

“There are various bits and pieces to the European [regulatory] timeline and 
if necessary the UK timeline with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
and Ofcom having to make a number of decisions in the next little while,” he 
said.


In 2011, Rupert Murdoch was forced to agree to spin off Sky News 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/03/jeremy-hunt-news-corp-sky-news> 
into a separate company in order to quell media plurality issues because of his 
ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers.


“We will be engaging with the relevant authorities right away,” James Murdoch 
said. “We do think that this passes regulatory muster, and we think as the 
relevant authorities look at the facts set around both the competition and 
potential UK intervention issues, that no meaningful concessions will need to 
be made.”

The company moved to try to allay fears that Sky News might be “Foxified” into 
a version of the rightwing Fox News.

“21st Century Fox will continue to broadcast news under the Sky brand, 
maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting 
code,” the company said.

Fox and Sky are aiming to push through a form of takeover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-schedule-of-agreement-shareholders>
 that will make it easier to squeeze out shareholders opposed to the deal.

The so-called “scheme of arrangement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-schedule-of-agreement-shareholders>
”, a court-backed process, requires approval from 75% of non-Fox shareholders. 
If this level is reached then all investors are forced to sell their stakes.

It is understood that a significant number of shareholders will reject the 
implementation of the scheme when Sky holds a vote at a yet-to-be-scheduled 
extraordinary general meeting.

Fox, which controls 37.19% of voteable shares, is not allowed to vote. This 
means that independent investors accounting for almost 16% of total Sky shares 
will need to vote against the scheme to block it being implemented.
