There have been five US multinationals caught up in “sweetheart tax deal” 
inquiries launched by competition officials in Brussels over the last two and a 
half years: Apple, Amazon, Starbucks,Fiat Chrysler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat-chrysler> and McDonald’s.

All angrily denied receiving any special treatment. They have all done 
something else too: they have strengthened operations in the UK.

Starbucks has switched head office activities from the Netherlands

 and Fiat Chrysler, created by a merger in 2014, has madeLondon its headquarters

 andApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/apple-moves-british-hq-into-battersea-power-station-boiler-room>
 have unveiled plans for gleaming new offices in the UK capital.

On Thursday, McDonald’s joined in. It is unwinding a controversial $1bn 
(£800m) royalties-earning business in Luxembourg, replacing it with a new 
European holding company run out of the UK.

The message is clear. If you’re a multinational feeling the heat from tax 
officials in mainland Europe, Britain can offer a port in the storm.


Google, the bete noir of many European tax justice campaigners, has felt the 
allure too. After apleasing resolution of a longstanding dispute over its UK 
taxes

 in January, the online search group recently resurrectedplans for vast new 
offices in London

.


While tax inspectors in Italy, France, Spain and Germany launch raids on the 
offices of many of the world’s largest multinationals, in Britain there is no 
such unpleasantness. Big businesses appreciate being greeted instead by someone 
from HMRC called a “customer relationship manager”.

Like a consummate hotelier, Britain calculates that by showing just a little 
more hospitality than its European neighbours, all the guests will want to stay 
here instead.


This is not to say experts are wrong when they predict many multinationals 
will freeze UK investment, or pull out altogether, as the country prepares to 
exit theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. 


That may be true for many businesses in industries heavily dependent on 
pan-European regulation. But for others, an independent Britain is an appealing 
prospect.

Ultimately, all major international investment decisions boil down to a simple 
bargain. What can a host country do for a multinational, and what must the 
multinational offer in return?


As it slides towards Brexit, Britain is less equipped than ever to impose 
tough terms on the world’s largest corporations. It may be attracting some 
big-name investors, but at what cost to the British taxpayer?
