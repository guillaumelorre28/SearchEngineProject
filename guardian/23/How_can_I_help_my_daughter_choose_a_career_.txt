Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
are two similar dilemmas – what are your thoughts?

My daughter is a bright young lady but doesn’t know what degree to take as she 
has no clear career plan. We have discussed this time and again, but she still 
can’t decide.

She is studying A-levels in biology, history and psychology and also completed 
AS-levels in English and law.

She enjoys writing and has thought about journalism. But she is particularly 
interested in endangered species and the activities of Greenpeace.


Any ideas on how, as her mum, I can gently (and diplomatically!) try and set 
her on an interesting path?
