Hello Alice. How are you?
I am doing great. We’re in Jacksonville, Florida tonight, Miami tomorrow. It’s 
a never-ending tour!

You’ll be in Swindon around Halloween. What are you hoping for from the people 
of Swindon?
Well the coincidental thing about Swindon is that my wife’s maiden name is 
Goddard, andthe Goddards are the major family of Swindon 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_family> (1). I said to her: “You must 
own something here.” No. Nothing. It means nothing. As for Halloween, as far as 
I can see the only place that really goes for it in England is Camden.

Every day is Halloween in Camden. 
Well yeah. Other places in England kind of like it but they’re not into it. It 
doesn’t matter — we’ll take Halloween with us.

Vis-a-vis costumes, there’s an officially licensed Alice Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alicecooper> latex mask on eBay for £39. Is 
that a reasonable price?
Yeah! That’s not bad. The main costume this year is going to be Donald Trump.

Two Shredded Wheat, whack them on your head: job done.
Absolutely. You’ve just gotta walk round shouting “BLAHBLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!” 
[Pause] “BLAHBLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!”

Your new Hollywood Vampires <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BgStW37oUc> 
album (2) is not exactly short on guitarists.
Well, I’ve always liked to have two or three gunslingers.

It doesn’t seem very efficient. Isn’t the music business supposed to be 
streamlining?
Not in this band! It’s just like, let’s get ALL the guitar players! Let’s get 
Slash AND Joe Perry on this! We’ve got the drummers, too: Zak Starkey, Abe from 
McCartney’s band, Dave Grohl …

Rumour has it that Dave Grohl’s actually quite a nice guy …
He really is. When I first saw Nirvana, the first thing that drew my attention 
was the drummer. He played like a 70s drummer. That attracted me immediately.

What did Salvador Dalí smell like (3)?
Well he’s the strangest thing. I’m pretty sure there are aliens that walk 
among us. And it’s always the guys who are in first place. The guy in first 
place is way, way ahead of the guy in second place. The Beatles, for instance – 
the next band down was way, way down. And that’s Salvador Dalí.

The Beatles were aliens?
Take Fred Astaire. Nobody danced like Fred Astaire, because he was from 
another planet. When Tiger Woods was in his prime I thought he was going to 
say: “This is what we really look like on other planets.” So there are certain 
people I’m pretty sure aren’t of this planet, and Dalí was one of them. They 
say never meet your idols; I’d studied him, but you assume that when you meet 
him it will all be an act. But he was so bizarre that it was beyond belief. 
First of all nine nymphs walk in. Then Gala(4) walks in — she’s in a full 
tuxedo and spats, white gloves, the whole lot. Then in comes “the Dalí”. “The 
Dalí is here.” He’s got a giraffe-skin coat on, blue velvet pants and a pair of 
Aladdin shoes. He sits down and orders everyone a Scorpion, which is a shell 
full of every alcohol you can think of, with an orchid floating in it.

What was he like to work with?
 He’d say one word in Portuguese, one word in French, then one word in 
Italian, as well as some weird surrealistic language. We worked with him for 
three days then afterwards, at a press conference, a journalist asked me the 
same thing. I told them: “It was great, but I didn’t understand a word he 
said!” Then Dalí goes: “Perfect! Confusion is the greatest form of 
communication!” And I look at him and I go: “You speak ENGLISH? After three 
days of BABBLING?”

Kanye’s planning to run for President 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/why-kanye-west-would-be-the-best-president-in-us-history-seriously>
. Do you have any thoughts based on your plan to run for Governor of Arizona in 
the 80s?
Well they wanted me to. I told them I didn’t have enough indictments. I wasn’t 
crooked enough to be a politician. I told them: “I can’t take the pay cut!” 
Also, it would have killed my golf game.

What’s the best sort of hat to wear when golfing?
I like the visor. I’m the visor guy. It just looks cool. Hats are important. 
(5) The whole look is important. 

If Gordon Ramsay came into Alice Cooper’s town (6) to see what was going on, 
how would it pan out?
Well first of all we wouldn’t care because we couldn’t care less about Gordon 
Ramsay. In America, everyone just goes, “Yeah? So?” This is American comfort 
food! This is tuna noodle casserole(7), stuff you’d get in a pub!

The proceeds of your Hollywood Vampires album go to charity. Are you a worthy 
person?
Yeah! MusiCares is about getting music for kids – there’s no music in school 
any more! I have another charity in Phoenix called Solid Rock Foundation, where 
I take any teenage kid who wants to come in and learn any instrument, and we’ll 
do it for free. And there’s theStarkey Hearing Foundation 
<https://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/>, where this guy goes round to 
places where people have never even seen a hearing aid, and he gives kids 
hearing aids. And they can hear for the first time! In Rio Je Janeiro they’re 
going to have like 30 kids who’ve never heard before, and the first thing 
they’ll hear is the Hollywood Vampires!

I don’t know if that’s a good thing to be honest.
Yeah, I don’t know if they wanna hear manic depression. I think the first 
thing you’d want to hear is probably a kitten.

Anyway, you may be worthy but I have not been. Goodbye!
Hey – if you can make it, come to a show! We’ll be at Wembley with Mötley Crüe!

baluster parapet, but was demolished in the 1950s.

(2) Hollywood Vampires are a supergroup paying homage to the legendary LA 
a-list booze club from the 70s. The album’s lineup includes Joe Perry on 
guitar, Johnny Depp on guitar, Slash on guitar, Robby Krieger on guitar, and 
Paul McCartney on bass.

(3) In 1973 Dalí captured Alice as a rotating hologram 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVhi7gi7_OA>. Alice’s brain, positioned behind 
his head, was stuffed with a chocolate eclair and ants. You can see it at the 
Dalí Museum in Florida.

Golf visor.

(6) Alice’s Phoenix-based restaurant and live music venue: “WHERE JOCKS AND 
ROCK MEET!” Since its appearance on the TV show Man vs Food, it now offers a 
hot dog called the Man vs Food Bases Loaded Full Unit. This consists of a 1lb, 
22in hot dog in a baguette, topped with “Nightmare Chili”, bacon, shredded 
cheese, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeños, chopped onions, diced tomatoes and 
finished with sweet relish. Served with fries.
