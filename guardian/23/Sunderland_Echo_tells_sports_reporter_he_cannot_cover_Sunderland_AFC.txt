A regional newspaper editor has decided that one of her sports reporters 
should not cover Premier League football teamSunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> because he once made 
derogatory references to it on Facebook.

Joy Yates told readers of the Sunderland Echo that Liam Kennedy will no longer 
write in the paper about the local club following“a large number of complaints” 
<http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/football/sunderland-afc/a-sunderland-echo-statement-on-liam-kennedy-1-8134017>
 about comments he made about the team before he joined the Echo staff.

According to a HoldTheFrontpage article 
<http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2016/news/new-football-writer-says-sorry-after-fans-out-him-as-rival-clubs-supporter/>
, Kennedy made the comments six years ago. They resurfaced on Facebook and were 
quickly reposted.

They were laden with expletives, were highly critical of Sunderland and 
revealed him to be a supporter of the club’s great rivals, Newcastle United.

Kennedy tried to make amends with “a whole-hearted apology” 
<http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/football/sunderland-afc/liam-kennedy-an-apology-to-readers-1-8130860>
, in which he admitted to being ashamed at his “pathetic, infantile posts” that 
were made before he became a journalist.

“I am a different person now,” he wrote. “I was young, daft and trying to be 
clever.” Being a Newcastle United fan “does not mean I cannot cover Sunderland 
AFC with … commitment and passion … It will all be done without bias.”

But the apology did not assuage the fans’ anger and Yates felt it necessary to 
stand him down. Kennedy only recently joined the Echo from the Dundee Evening 
Telegraph.

Yates explained that she had to take the concerns of her readers “very 
seriously.” So “for a number of reasons, the decision has now been made that 
Liam will no longer be covering SAFC.”

Sunderland have had a poor start to the season under their new manager, David 
Moyes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-moyes>. The team is one place 
off the bottom of the Premier League.
