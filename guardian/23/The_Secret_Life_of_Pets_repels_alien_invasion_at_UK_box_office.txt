The winner: The Secret Life of Pets

Illumination Entertainment, maker of Despicable Me and Minions, has scored 
another big hit with its latest animated feature,The Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
. The opening weekend gross of £9.58m includes £3.63m from previews the 
previous Saturday and Sunday. Although the film was accompanied by a Minions 
short, the Universal-owned animation house will be pleased that these numbers 
have been achieved by a new property that isn’t a Despicable Me sequel or 
spinoff.

With or without previews, Pets has delivered the biggest animated opening of 
the year. Disney’sZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/zootopia-zootropolis> began with £5.31m 
including £1.73m in previews.Kung Fu Panda 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/kung-fu-panda-3-review> kicked 
off with £4.77m including £1.59m in previews.Angry Birds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/the-angry-birds-movie-review-game-spin-off-that-doesnt-quite-reach-lego-movie-levels>
 started with £2.14m.

As for former Illumination hits, Despicable Me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/despicable-me> began its run in October 2010 
with £3.66m including previews of £205,000.Despicable Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/despicable-me-2> followed three years later 
with a stunning debut of £14.82m including £4.87m in previews. A year ago,
Minions <https://www.theguardian.com/film/minions> launched with £11.56m.

Warm word of mouth has propelled Zootropolis to £23.65m. Given the stronger 
start, Universal will surely be hoping to push Pets beyond that tally. No 
direct competition arrives until Ice Age: Collision Course and Finding Dory in 
July.

The runner-up: Independence Day: Resurgence

When Independence Day arrived in US cinemas in July 1996, it set the template 
for the summer action blockbuster, concentrating Hollywood studio minds on high 
concepts and spectacle rather than A-list star packages. The following month, 
it reached UK cinemas, taking an explosive £7.01m, on its way to a final tally 
of £37.1m.

Belated sequel Independence Day: Resurgence arrives in a different landscape 
in which there has been no shortage of action blockbusters propelled by high 
concepts and spectacular visual effects. Its UK opening of £5.07m included 
previews of £944,000. If previews are included, that’s the ninth biggest debut 
of the year so far, behindBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling>
 (£5.24m).

Indie movies stumble

Several new releases offered alternatives to the big two blockbusters, and all 
under performed to varying degrees.Elvis & Nixon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/elvis-nixon-review-kevin-spacey-michael-shannon>
 starring Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey recounts an intriguing celebrity 
meeting, but it was always hard to imagine audiences flocking, especially 
outside the US. It begins with £57,000 from 107 cinemas, yielding a weak £531 
average. But that result is positively joyful when compared withThe Meddler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/15/the-meddler-susan-sarandon-rose-byrne-review>
, starring Susan Sarandon and Rose Byrne. This film needed to be in indie 
cinemas to connect with its likeliest audience, but those venues had other 
choices, and Sony instead released it overwhelmingly in multiplexes, grossing 
£19,300 from 103 venues.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/when-marnie-was-there-review-studio-ghibli>
 all falling by more than 50%.

The gravity defier: Me Before You

While most films suffered big falls, Me Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock>
 once again enjoyed the smallest drop of any title in the Top 10, down 32%. 
Gross after 24 days is a healthy £8.02m. The depressed state of the market 
beyond the top few titles is underlined by the fact thatThe Nice Guys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/the-nice-guys-review-russell-crowe-and-ryan-gosling-cannes>
 saw box office fall by 52%, it yet rose from sixth to fifth place. Weekend 
takings of £203,000 represent the lowest for any film in the UK Top 5 since May 
2013.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/16/gods-of-egypt-review-film-alex-proyas-bizarre-fantasy>
, plummeting from third to 11th place, with an 80% drop in box office.

The future

 Thanks to the arrival of The Secret Life of Pets and Independence Day: 
Resurgence, takings are up a welcome 96% on the previous frame. However, 
they’re down 10% on the equivalent session a year ago, when Minions knocked
Jurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/27/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-edina-and-patsy-in-big-screen-debut-video>
Bookers are hoping that Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/absolutely-fabulous--the-movie> will deliver 
a boost. Female friendship groups are the primary audience, but the early exit 
of England from Euro 2016 may embolden distributor Fox to position more 
aggressively for couples. Also in the mix: Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in
Central Intelligence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/16/central-intelligence-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart>
, and Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl in The Colony.Now You See Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/now-you-see-me-2-review-sequel-magic>
