A former employee of a payment-processing company and a former chief editor of 
a gossip magazine were convicted on Thursday of illegally accessing credit card 
transactions and using them to track celebrities and members of the Danish 
royal family for four years.

Bo Henriksen, who obtained information through his previous job with the Nets 
company, was jailed for 18 months, while Henrik Qvortrup, formerly the chief 
editor of Se og Hør magazine, was given 18 months. In addition, another chief 
editor and two reporters were given sentences ranging from four to 12 months. 
All had denied the charges and Henriksen has lodged an appeal.


One of the reporters, Ken B Rasmussen, wrote in a 2014 book that reporters 
used information from a secret source with access to a card-payment company’s 
computers.

Qvortrup made a deal with Henriksen, who was paid 10,000 kroner (£1,140) a 
month. Between 2008 and 2012, Henriksen provided the magazine with details 
about the credit card use of 135 Danish royals and celebrities.
