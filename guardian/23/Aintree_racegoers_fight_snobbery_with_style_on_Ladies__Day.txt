It is one of those days on the racing calendar that is associated as much with 
ostentatious outfits and popping champagne corks as equine sporting prowess.


Yet despite the best efforts of the Aintree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/aintree> racing festival to clamp down on 
some of the negative media coverage that has prevailed on Ladies’ Day over the 
last decade, this year saw reports focus once again on the revealing outfits of 
the attendees.

The coverage attracted the anger of Coleen Rooney, wife of the footballer 
Wayne Rooney, who was among those in the crowd at theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool> racecourse. Windy weather plagued 
the event and many photographs published featured women caught with their 
skirts blown up around their waists.

 “I am in the public eye so expect criticism,” Rooney said. “It’s the innocent 
people that turn up for a great day and get slated.” She added that “lots of 
people made a massive effort and looked beautiful”.

In the buildup to the event, John Baker, the north-west regional director of 
the Jockey Club, which owns Aintree, had threatened to “kick off site” any 
photographer who was clearly documenting an unflattering image of the female 
racegoers.

This year was the second in a row in which organisers of the event encouraged 
the tens of thousands who attended to adopt an “aspirational” style code based 
on the Coco Chanel slogan: “Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress 
impeccably and they remember the woman.”

On Friday afternoon Aintree bosses declared that this year was the “most 
stylish Ladies’ Day inGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> history”.


The meeting, which has a television audience of more than 600 million 
globally, is attended mainly by people from the local Liverpool area. The 
emphasis on photos of women falling over, often in revealing outfits, has been 
criticised for perpetuating negative stereotypes of the city’s women.

Beth Hinton-Lever, 22, who is from Liverpool, said Aintree Ladies’ Day was 
still simply an annual “shaming” of her home city.

“You don’t get this at other sport or horse racing events, it’s just Ladies’ 
Day,” she said. “Because of this coverage, when people think of Liverpool or 
when they think of Aintree, they’ll think of people getting drunk, falling 
over, being upskirted, whereas actually it’s a really glamorous day, everyone 
looks gorgeous and is having a great time.”


Baker insisted that the style code was about embracing the fashion on show at 
Ladies’ Day, rather than restricting it.

“The great thing about it, the ­ladies of Liverpool come out and ­express 
themselves. They have their own personalities, which is great,” Baker told the 
Times. “We definitely do not want to lose that. We are just trying to encourage 
people to say, ‘Yes, this is my style, this is what I am doing.’”

This year revellers at the races were also given an incentive to follow the 
suave style code in the form of a £35,000 Range Rover and £8,000 in cash, which 
was awarded to the most smartly dressed guest, male or female.

Many social media users criticised the continued “snobbery” that undermined 
coverage of the day. Siobhan Osborne wrote: “Any excuse to criticise and 
attempt to humiliate women.”
