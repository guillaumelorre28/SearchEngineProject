Sopranos – College

“College” isn’t just one of The Sopranos’ finest episodes: it may also be the 
vital pivot in the flowering of modern American TV. In the episode, early in 
the Sopranos’ first season, Tony takes his daughter Meadow on a tour of New 
England colleges. While he’s there, he spots a mob rat. He drops Meadow off, 
finds the rat, and murders him. Then he goes back to his daughter. He’s not a 
redeemable rogue any more, but a certifiable monster. We love him anyway.

Happy Valley’s brilliance is so uniform that it’s hard to pick a best episode. 
Let’s go with the one where Sergeant Catherine Cawood finds the kidnapped Ann 
in the clutches of the despicable Tommy Lee Royce. You’re off your sofa with 
relief as Ann is freed – but as ever withHappy Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley>, it’s a qualified sort 
of catharsis, as Catherine is beaten to a pulp in the process. Her bloodied 
face as she passes out in the street with Ann safe is an unforgettable image of 
her heroism.

The more of Aaron Sorkin’s work you have seen, the more you notice the taste 
of his saccharine nostalgia in even the best of it. But watch the West Wing 
again and Two Cathedrals endures. As everyone remembers, President Bartlet 
shouts at God, in Latin, in his grief over the death of his beloved secretary 
Mrs Landingham; but it’s the cuts to Bartlet’s adolescence, and his first 
meetings with Mrs Landingham, that give the episode its moral and emotional 
weight.

You could pick any one of a dozen episodes – but the end of Stringer Bell’s 
tragic arc has the ambition and subtlety to represent them all. The whole of 
the third season has been about bringing Stringer to this point. Betrayed by 
his closest friend, he faces his death standing in the condominium complex that 
he thought could bring him the legitimacy he craved. “Get on with it, motherf-” 
he tells Omar and Brother Mouzone, as they aim at him – and even if George 
Pelecanos’ script doesn’t let him finish, the grandeur of his plight is 
unmistakable.

No prime-ministerial-pig-bothering in this episode of Charlie Brooker’s 
dystopian set of one-off dramas, but it’s a far more powerful hour of 
television. The talent shows targeted here, in an alternate universe whose 
heroes cycle grimly away on exercise bikes in the hopes of accumulating enough 
credits to appear on TV, are commonplace enough targets, but when the world in 
which they feature is so thoroughly imagined and the doomed romance at the 
heart of it so deftly drawn, the barbs become almost secondary. Jessica 
Brown-Findlay’s rendition of Anyone Who Knows What Love Is will stay with you.

 Breaking Bad: Fly. Photograph: Ursula Coyote/AMC 
There’s a certain kind of self-contained, unconventional episode that seems 
written with lists like this in mind. Fly merits its inclusion nonetheless. 
Walter White becomes infuriated at a fly that he fears will pollute his meth 
production process, and enlists his colleague Jesse in an attempt to catch it. 
Nothing else happens. But in its unhinged camerawork, its relentless focus, and 
its fearless, nihilistic attention to the question that is at the heart of our 
interest in Walt –how did you get here? – it is unforgettable. “There must 
exist certain words in a certain specific order that would explain all this”, 
Walt says. What if there aren’t?
