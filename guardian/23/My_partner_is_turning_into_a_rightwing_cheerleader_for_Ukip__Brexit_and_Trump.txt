My partner, with whom I have a three-year-old child, is becoming increasingly 
rightwing. He was not like this when we met. He voted to leave the EU, voted 
for Ukip and is a fan of Donald Trump. He consumes news addictively, including 
rightwing websites, and is passionate about political affairs. I don’t want my 
daughter to grow up in a house where we argue about politics all the time, but 
we both feel so strongly. He is increasingly pleased about the changing state 
of world politics and it is really upsetting me. Does anyone have any advice on 
how to manage this domestic political battle?
