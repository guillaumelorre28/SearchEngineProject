Discussions continue over the prospect of strike action hitting racing in the 
days ahead, as trainers and owners plot a way of proving that bookmakers cannot 
do without the sport and should pay more for it, but definite plans appeared 
thin on the ground last night.

Monday 1 November has been circled in the calendar for some time as a possible 
date for action, although exactly what form that might take remains unclear. In 
the past trainers have been encouraged to withdraw horses at the final 
declaration stage or even later, but the latest attempted strike over prize 
money cuts at Yarmouth two years ago produced only limited results, when some 
yards refused to participate.

"Everyone is talking about it but I think we'll have to wait and see what 
happens," said Mark Tompkins, the chairman of the Newmarket Trainers 
Federation. "Something has got to give because unless we get the situation 
sorted out you will have trainers going out of business and hundreds of 
redundancies, which would be a disaster for a town like Newmarket."

Rupert Arnold, the head of the National Trainers Federation, added: 
"Discussions are taking place between the members of the Horsemen's Group as to 
how best to go about doing things, but this is a critical time for the industry 
and it's vital that, if any action takes place, it is carried out in the most 
effective manner. Our members are fully supportive of what we are doing."

Tony McCoy, the perennial champion jumps jockey, was the latest to add his 
voice to the issue, describing prize money as "very disappointing".

He added: "At Fontwell we have some races that are worth less than Â£1,000. 
That shouldn't be allowed. It's bad for everything to do with racing and sends 
out negative thoughts on the way racing is going."
