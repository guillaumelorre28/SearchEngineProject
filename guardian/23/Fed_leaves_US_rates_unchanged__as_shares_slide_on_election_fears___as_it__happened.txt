But it is not a given that the Fed will hike in December, says economist James 
Knightley at ING Bank:

There is little in the statement to suggest that a December hike is definitely 
going to happen (markets currently pricing in a 67% chance of a move). The 
statement comments that ”the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has 
continued to strengthen” while adding the word “some” to the line that it wants 
to “wait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its 
objectives”. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, 
but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.

Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given 
expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm 
growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce 
market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is 
likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually 
do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We 
also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, 
including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.

The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US 
markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. 
The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Although there was no rate change today, it looks increasingly likely there 
will be one in December. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

With just days to go before election fever sweeps America, Janet Yellen’s 
Federal Interest Rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same.

However, it’s becoming ever more likely that Yellen will implement a raise 
early next month following signs that the American economy is gradually picking 
up steam.

She made clear in September that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than 
likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central 
bank may get its wish.

The Fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term.

In September it said:

Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of 
earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.

This now reads:

Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the 
transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and 
the labor market strengthens further.

The Fed said in its statement 
<http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20161102a.htm>:

The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 
percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in 
energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. 
Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee 
continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and 
financial developments.

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the 
case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but 
decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued 
progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market 
conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

This time there were only two Fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not 
three, Esther George and Loretta Mester.

Eric Rosengren, who voted for a rise last time, has now sided with the 
majority.

Federal Reserve leaves US rates unchanged

BREAKING NEWS

To no one’s great surprise, the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> has opted to leave US 
interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election.

It said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives 
before hiking.

The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision will be released in less than 
an hour.

While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the 
presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to 
be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data.

There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed 
statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments. At that 
meeting seven of the Fed members voted for no change, with three, Esther 
George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren, backing an increase. Any variance 
here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in December.

European markets hit by US election fears

Investors have been unnerved by suggestions that Donald Trump is gaining 
ground in the US presidential race, with one poll this week even showing him in 
the lead over Hillary Clinton. Combined with a slump in oil prices following a 
record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe 
sharply lower.

But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or 
so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 
20 points ahead of the latest USFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate decision.


Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is 
up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering 
around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it 
reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC 
Markets, said:

Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both 
complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index 
shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with 
safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity 
benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning 
stocks.

The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in 
which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in 
the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 are down 2-3%.

There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White 
House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they 
are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 
27 September 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93 
 * France’s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56. Facebook

Ahead of the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate decision 
in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar 
continues to weaken against the pound.

Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent 
the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at 
$1.2313, a three week high.

The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, 
being pretty much unchanged at €1.1078.

Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, 
according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.

The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in 
October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014. Markit said 
the surveys hinted at “ a welcome resurgence of life in the world’s factories 
at the start of the fourth quarter. Inflationary pressures also picked up to 
the highest for nearly three years.”

It said the data were roughly consistent with global manufacturing output 
rising at a reasonable 4% annual pace.

With investors spooked by the prospect of Donald Trump possibly winning the US 
election, not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in US 
crude stocks, markets remain under pressure.

The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9%, Germany’s Dax has dropped 1.2% and 
France’s Cac has lost 1.1%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been so badly hit and 
is currently 0.2% lower.

That could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing 
Trump in the lead. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:

The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they 
still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix 
volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though 
it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, 
after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.

Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have 
outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US 
election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead 
indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is 
considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has 
not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, 
suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility 
spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.

But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate 
announcement later. Brooks said:

The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, 
that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off 
in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.

However, in our view the bigger risk from today’s meeting could be a dovish 
slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until 
the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be 
politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump 
next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. 
Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly 
dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could 
be in advance of a dovish “shock” from the Fed later on today.

Crude slumps as US oil stocks surge

Oil prices are under pressure again after a much bigger than expected rise in 
US crude stocks.

Last week, crude stocks rose 14.42m barrels to 482.58m compared to 
expectations of an increase of just 1m barrels, according to the Energy 
Information Administration. This is the highest weekly build on record. Last 
week there was a 0.55m fall in oil stocks.

Gasoline stocks fell by 2.21m barrels, higher than the 1.9m drop expected.

A rise in stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday had 
already signalled a jump in the EIA figures was possible:
Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) 
API +9M last night meant a big EIA build was possible. They don't exactly 
mirror, but direction + magnitude has proved quite reliable lately

<https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/793823384287272960> 
With the build in stocks signalling oversupply and falling demand, Brent crude 
is on the slide, down 2.89% to $46.75 a barrel.

West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3.2% to $45.15.

But it is not a given that the Fed will hike in December, says economist James 
Knightley at ING Bank:

There is little in the statement to suggest that a December hike is definitely 
going to happen (markets currently pricing in a 67% chance of a move). The 
statement comments that ”the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has 
continued to strengthen” while adding the word “some” to the line that it wants 
to “wait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its 
objectives”. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, 
but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.

Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given 
expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm 
growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce 
market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is 
likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually 
do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We 
also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, 
including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.

The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US 
markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. 
The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Although there was no rate change today, it looks increasingly likely there 
will be one in December. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

With just days to go before election fever sweeps America, Janet Yellen’s 
Federal Interest Rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same.

However, it’s becoming ever more likely that Yellen will implement a raise 
early next month following signs that the American economy is gradually picking 
up steam.

She made clear in September that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than 
likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central 
bank may get its wish.
 
The Fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term.

In September it said:

Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of 
earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.

This now reads:

Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the 
transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and 
the labor market strengthens further.
 
The Fed said in its statement 
<http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20161102a.htm>:

The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 
percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in 
energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. 
Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee 
continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and 
financial developments.

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the 
case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but 
decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued 
progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market 
conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
 
This time there were only two Fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not 
three, Esther George and Loretta Mester.

Eric Rosengren, who voted for a rise last time, has now sided with the 
majority.
 
BREAKING NEWS

To no one’s great surprise, the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> has opted to leave US 
interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election.

It said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives 
before hiking.

The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision will be released in less than 
an hour.

While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the 
presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to 
be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data.

There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed 
statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments. At that 
meeting seven of the Fed members voted for no change, with three, Esther 
George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren, backing an increase. Any variance 
here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in December.
 
Investors have been unnerved by suggestions that Donald Trump is gaining 
ground in the US presidential race, with one poll this week even showing him in 
the lead over Hillary Clinton. Combined with a slump in oil prices following a 
record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe 
sharply lower.

But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or 
so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 
20 points ahead of the latest USFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate decision.


Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is 
up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering 
around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it 
reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC 
Markets, said:

Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both 
complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index 
shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with 
safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity 
benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning 
stocks.

The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in 
which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in 
the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 are down 2-3%.

There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White 
House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they 
are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 
27 September 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93 
 * France’s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.  
Ahead of the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate decision 
in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar 
continues to weaken against the pound.

Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent 
the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at 
$1.2313, a three week high.

The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, 
being pretty much unchanged at €1.1078.

Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, 
according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.

The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in 
October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014. Markit said 
the surveys hinted at “ a welcome resurgence of life in the world’s factories 
at the start of the fourth quarter. Inflationary pressures also picked up to 
the highest for nearly three years.”

It said the data were roughly consistent with global manufacturing output 
rising at a reasonable 4% annual pace.

With investors spooked by the prospect of Donald Trump possibly winning the US 
election, not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in US 
crude stocks, markets remain under pressure.

The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9%, Germany’s Dax has dropped 1.2% and 
France’s Cac has lost 1.1%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been so badly hit and 
is currently 0.2% lower.

That could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing 
Trump in the lead. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:

The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they 
still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix 
volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though 
it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, 
after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.

Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have 
outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US 
election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead 
indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is 
considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has 
not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, 
suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility 
spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.

But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> interest rate 
announcement later. Brooks said:

The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, 
that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off 
in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.

However, in our view the bigger risk from today’s meeting could be a dovish 
slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until 
the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be 
politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump 
next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. 
Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly 
dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could 
be in advance of a dovish “shock” from the Fed later on today.

Oil prices are under pressure again after a much bigger than expected rise in 
US crude stocks.

Last week, crude stocks rose 14.42m barrels to 482.58m compared to 
expectations of an increase of just 1m barrels, according to the Energy 
Information Administration. This is the highest weekly build on record. Last 
week there was a 0.55m fall in oil stocks.

Gasoline stocks fell by 2.21m barrels, higher than the 1.9m drop expected.

A rise in stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday had 
already signalled a jump in the EIA figures was possible:
Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) 
API +9M last night meant a big EIA build was possible. They don't exactly 
mirror, but direction + magnitude has proved quite reliable lately

<https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/793823384287272960> 
With the build in stocks signalling oversupply and falling demand, Brent crude 
is on the slide, down 2.89% to $46.75 a barrel.

West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3.2% to $45.15.
