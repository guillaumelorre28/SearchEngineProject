Adam Ant is readying his first album in 15 years, and plans to include a song 
in tribute to the lateMalcolm McLaren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/malcolm-mclaren>.

The new wave icon is back with a record titled as flamboyantly as any of his 
old outfits –Adam Ant <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-ant> Is the 
Blueblack Hussar In Marrying The Gunner's Daughter.

He told NME.com <http://www.nme.com/home> that the album is a "live record 
that lends itself well to performance" and while featuring "a kind of concept" 
is also "a very old-fashioned, old-school step-by step album".

Ant – born Stuart Leslie Goddard – has been working with Morrissey acolyte Boz 
Boorer, 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, and on one track, an 
as-yet-unnamed member of Oasis.

Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar In Marrying The Gunner's Daughter (we cannot 
repeat that title enough) will also feature a song written in tribute to the 
lateMalcolm McLaren <https://www.theguardian.com/music/malcolm-mclaren>. 
Entitled Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? On account of the Sex Pistol's manager's 
"quite prominent teeth", the song was written by Ant as a demo in the early 80s 
and has been revisited following McLaren's death.

Paying tribute, Ant said "Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life – as close 
as you can get to a surrogate father."

Indeed, the new project may lead the singer to revisit more old material: 
"There are literally about 100 songs done on a four-track and I use them 
wherever I can. There was a whole album before (1979's)Dirk Wears White Sox 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Wears_White_Sox> that never really came out, 
but I've still got the masters. It's a labour of love, this catalogue."

He added with a flourish: "To get rid of it would be like giving away 
something John Lennon and Paul McCartney banged out in a night in a pub in 
Liverpool. I think it's your duty to catalogue your work."
