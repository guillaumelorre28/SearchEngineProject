The prospect of increased US spending and rising interest rates has pushed the 
dollar index above 100 for the first time since December. Fawad Razaqzada, 
market analyst at Forex.com, said:

The dollar index does appear to be a little bit overbought around these 
levels, though technically the trend looks strong as it resides inside a 
bullish channel and above the main moving averages. So, a short-term pullback 
would not come as a surprise to me, before we potentially see higher levels. 
That being said, the 100 level has now been tested several times since March 
2015. The more a level is tested, the more likely it will break in the 
direction of the test...It should be noted that if the dollar were to rise 
further then this will be bad news for US stock. Up until now, they have been 
rising and falling in unison. This relationship cannot continue indefinitely as 
the appreciating dollar is supposed to weigh on company earnings.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European bond yields are unlikely to rise as fast as those in the US following 
Donald Trump’s shock presidential election victory, says Capital Economics 
Simon MacAdam:

In the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, we are 
nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe. But we still 
don’t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.

Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th 
November. This reflects investors’ expectations of a major fiscal stimulus 
under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly 
boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets 
Update, “New – even more bearish – forecasts for Treasuries”, published on 
Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the 
increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European 
government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead.

For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in 
Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace 
of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this 
month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And 
there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone.

Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary 
pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater 
degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the 
euro-zone.

Third, following the UK’s Brexit vote, Trump’s victory has stoked fears of 
more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in 
France, in spring’s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already 
benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived 
political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to 
contain yields there.

European markets edge higher

Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new 
peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With 
bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump’s presidency could 
see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial 
beneficiary.

In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to 
their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest 
for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However 
bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their 
highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably 
buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this 
has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries.

In equities, the final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2 
 * But Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the 
country’s forthcoming referendum 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points 
at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934.

US technology stocks are missing out on the market’s current rally, on fears 
that some of Donald Trump’s policies will prove unfavourable.

Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of 
retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple’s expansion plans. Even the 
prospect of tax breaks allowing such companies to repatriate some of their cash 
piles has not proved to be much support for the shares.

Nor are the major tech companies likely to benefit from Trump’s proposed 
programme of infrastructure spending, said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC 
Markets:

Tech stocks like Facebook and Netflix won’t get any government contracts in a 
rise in infrastructure spending but Chinese expansion plans are at risk by 
possible trade tariffs.

So Apple is currently down 3.2% while Facebook has fallen 3.7%.

More fallout from the strong dollar: oil prices are heading lower again.

It is not just the dollar hitting crude, however. Investors had been hoping 
that a key Opec meeting at the end of this month would agree measures to curb 
output and thus support prices. But the closer the meeting gets, the more the 
doubts grow and put pressure on the crude price.

So Brent is currently down 1.59% at $44.04 a barrel while West Texax 
Intermediate has slipped 1.68% to £42.68.

Helena Smith

Over in Greece, government officials are preparing for a new round of talks 
with inspectors representing the country’s foreign lenders followingBarack 
Obama’s extraordinary call for Athens to be granted “meaningful debt relief.” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/13/barack-obama-calls-for-meaningful-debt-relief-for-greece>
 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports:

Rarely has there been such desire from a sitting government in Athens to 
conclude a review with auditors representing the bodies that have thrice bailed 
out Greece since 2010. Highlighting that sentiment, the new government 
spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters earlier that differences 
between the two are “very small.”

The talks, which begin in earnest tomorrow, will focus on an overhaul of 
labour laws including annulment of collective work agreements and mass firings 
(a red line many in the ruling left wing Syriza party), privatisations and 
primary surplus targets for 2019. Next year’s budget will also be discussed. 
The goal – one dismissed as untenable by most – is for the inspection tour to 
be wrapped up in a matter of days in the hope that debt relief talks can begin 
when euro zone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on 
December 5.

If debt-serving costs are brought down, it will reduce the need for the 
country to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018 – a target set by lenders but 
almost unequivocally derided as impossible to meet.

Ahead of president Barack Obama’s arrival in the Greek capital on Tuesday the 
government has gone out of its way to play up the two-day visit with 
Tzanakopoulos saying today that it had not only been heartened by his 
intervention on the matter of Greek debt but calling the tour one of great 
significance. The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to 
Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama’s last state 
visit abroad.

To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long 
called “unmanageable.” Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring 
pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in 
talks between the two on Wednesday.

The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits 
from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US 
election result.

Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450. But against 
the euro, the pound is holding steady, up 0.09% at €1.1622.

Wall Street hits new peak

US markets are on the rise at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
reaching a new record high - just two trading days after the previous peak.

The Dow is currently up around 45 points or o.24% at 18893, having reached 
18,918, ahead of the previous record of 18,873 hit last Thursday, as equities 
continued to welcome Donald Trump’s election victory, even if bond markets do 
not.

The S&P 500 opened up 0.21% while the Nasdaq composite added 0.15% initially.

Summary: Bond yields jump as market rout intensifies

Time for a quick catch up.

The bond market has suffered fresh losses today as investors rapidly adjust to 
the prospect of Donald Trump taking control of the world’s largest economy.

Debt prices have fallen sharply again, adding to last week’s $1trn bloodbath, 
on the prospect that we’re entering a world of higher inflation, interest rate 
hikes, political uncertainty and possibly trade disputes too.

The selloff has hit US bond prices. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/14/uk-borrowing-costs-may-high-bonds-trump-business-live?page=with:block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99#block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99>
 The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, 
rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week.

Shorter-dated two-year debt, and long-dated 30-year bonds, also hit their 
weakest points since the start of the year.

Investors are betting that Trump’s infrastructure programme, and his plan to 
cut taxes, will reflate the US economy.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, believes the bond market selloff 
could intensify:

“The sentiment surrounding a rate hike has been flip-flopping and that only 
makes bond buying, especially at around the 1% mark for two-year bills, a more 
appealing proposition.

“President Trump’s pledge to pile resources into infrastructure to ‘Make 
America Great Again’ has arguably upped the risk of investing in Treasury 
yields. The 11-month high of 1% might not be the high water mark for 2016 as 
Trump’s economic policy is put into action.”

[remember: bond yield rise when price fall]

UK borrowing costs are also being driven up.

 The 10-year gilt yield has hit its highest level since May, at 1.45%.

The dollar is strengthening, hitting an 11-month high against the euro, and 
against a broad basket of currencies. It’s also gained one cent against the UK 
pound, at around $1.25.

And the markets reckon that the Federal Reserve is nailed on to raise US 
interest rates in December:

But....a string of experts are voicing concern about Trumponomics:

 * JP Morgan’s David Kelly thinks slashing taxes and driving up borrowing 
risks pushing the US deficit into dangerous heights

, and simply isn’t necessary right now.

 * Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers thinks the infrastructure plan 
appears to be badly designed

 * And George Magnus, UBS’s well-respected former chief economist, fears that 
Trump could trigger pain through the global economy if he takes a protectionist 
approach

Over the weekend, Trump started to step back from some of his more extreme 
positions.

That wall between America and Mexico might be downgraded to a mere fence, in 
places, for example.

And investors find that sort of u-turn encouraging, says Naeem Aslam of Think 
Markets:

Markets are showing that investors continue to believe the fiscal policy plans 
by Mr Trump and they want to pile their bets in equities. A risk on trade has 
become the famous trade amid traders and hence for the past week, since Trump’s 
victory, we are seeing the precious metal along with other safe haven like the 
Japanese yen selling off sharply.

Mr Trump has delivered many watered down versions of his controversial views 
over the weekend. This has restored further confidence that the person in 
charge of the biggest economy of the world, has started to think more logically.

It is this certainty which investors are applauding.

However... appointing the head of far-right website Breitbart as “chief 
strategist and senior counselor” doesn’t suggest Trump is backing away from the 
view that appalled liberal critics.

Donald Trump’s shock win is an alarm call to moderate politicians to improve 
workers’ conditions, argues the head of the International Labour Organisation.

Guy Ryder believes that the US election result, and the Brexit vote, show that 
many workers feel sidelined and ‘dispossessed’ in today’s economy:

He tells us:

“The societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation 
and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are 
getting a raw deal.

“It is the people who feel they haven’t benefited from globalisation and from 
the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the 
dispossessed in that regard.”

We now have a hat-trick of warnings about Donald Trump’s economic plans.

George Magnus, the former chief economist of UBS, is very concerned that the 
next president could kick off a trade war that harms America’s economy, and the 
rest of the world too.

In a new blogpost, Magnus writes 
<http://www.georgemagnus.com/trumps-economics-are-a-hybrid-of-possibly-good-and-seriously-awful/>
:

Trump’s vehemently anti-free trade rhetoric has included the threat to rip up 
or change NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Association agreement, including 
the possibility of levying tariffs on Mexico, and this, on top of erecting the 
wall, or otherwise restricting immigration. He has threatened China with heavy 
tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its 
currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that 
was central to President Obama’s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying 
to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership, its own version of America’s TPP.

If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading 
agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would 
protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just 
tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do 
have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global 
trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread 
through the global economy.

Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure 
spending plan, but he’s less impressed by Trump’s tax cuts, as they’ll mainly 
benefit the better off.
Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner) 
The irony of Trump's populism: 51% of his tax cuts go to the top 1%; only 0.8% 
to bottom 20%. My@Morning_Joe <https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe> chart

 <https://twitter.com/SteveRattner/status/798158448072527873> 
And the other BIG worry is that Trump could drives up the US national debt to 
alarming levels.

Magnus says:

The other major concern about Trumponomics is about a mishandled fiscal 
expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal 
deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt. The bipartisan and independent 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we 
know of Trump’s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 
trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 
trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. 
increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 
per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth 
becomes seriously impaired.

The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes 
mired again in rising public deficits – remember debt will be rising anyway in 
the 2020’s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external 
deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic 
instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then 
an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for 
de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be 
accentuated.

My take on Trump's economics. Possibly good in parts, seriously awful otherwise

Each column shows how an asset class has performed. So from left to right, you 
can see that

 * Most emerging economy’s equity markets have fallen today as investors dump 
shares.

 * Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar today, including the yen, 
euro and Turkish lira

 * There have been heavy losses across the government bond markets today, both 
in developed and emerging economies

 * The cost of insuring those bonds against default, using a credit default 
swap, has risen (showing that investors see government debt as riskier)

 * But the prices of iron ore, zinc and lead have risen

Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers shares JP Morgan’s concerns about 
Trump’s infrastructure investment plan.

Writing in the Financial Times, Summers argues that the scheme won’t address 
the parts of America that most need improving, won’t get key private sector 
investors involved, and risks pushing borrowing to dangerous levels:

Summers argues:

Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur 
Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total 
private sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, 
not reach many of the most important investors, and involve substantial 
mis-targeting of public resources.

Many of the highest return infrastructure investments — such as improving 
roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or 
modernising the air traffic control system — do not generate a commercial 
return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension 
funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising 
sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program.

I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any 
responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some 
combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis.

Here’s the full piece:

A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class 
<https://www.ft.com/content/2673c232-a9b2-11e6-a0bb-97f42551dbf4>

Summers, of course, has been urging Western politicians to spend more on 
infrastructure projects foryears, so his opposition is a slight surprise....

JP Morgan: Trump's stimulus plan would be dangerous

Donald Trump’s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation’s 
infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan’s chief global 
strategist, David Kelly.


In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not 
under-performing at present, and wouldn’t be helped by a large debt-fuelled 
stimulus.

Kelly is also concerned that Trump’s proposed tax cut plans would send the 
national debt clock up to 100% of national output.

First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the 
economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more 
likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP 
growth.

The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 
to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, 
under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 
to 86% in fiscal 2026.

However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump’s fiscal plans, the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the 
debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these 
plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, 
although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact.

Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows 
that the plan would be pricy:

It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury 
rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much 
greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the 
financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but 
the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a 
debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous.

The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless.

And if that wasn’t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn’t 
need a stimulus boost right now:

The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The 
overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over 
the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has 
been 98% of the time over the past 50 years.

Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially 
in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged 
down.

But... if Kelly’s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate 
America’s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not 
sparking a manufacturing revival).

He concludes:

In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would 
likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the 
U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits 
should lead to higher interest rates – particularly if the Federal Reserve 
perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest 
rates.

The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. 
Immigration reform designed toincrease skilled immigrants or policies that 
boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. 
However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate 
demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating.
 Hare-raising fiscal outlook means Trump should perhaps resist shelling out on 
new highways. Photograph: Gk Hart/vikki Hart/Getty Images

Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their

Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime 
minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month.

Renzi hinted this morning that he might quit if the public reject the proposal 
to reform the Senate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/could-italys-renzi-be-next-victim-of-an-unwanted-referendum>
.

Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared:

If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before 
me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.”

Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close.

The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and 
the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of 
inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of 
stagnation and political quicksand).

The prospect of increased US spending and rising interest rates has pushed the 
dollar index above 100 for the first time since December. Fawad Razaqzada, 
market analyst at Forex.com, said:

The dollar index does appear to be a little bit overbought around these 
levels, though technically the trend looks strong as it resides inside a 
bullish channel and above the main moving averages. So, a short-term pullback 
would not come as a surprise to me, before we potentially see higher levels. 
That being said, the 100 level has now been tested several times since March 
2015. The more a level is tested, the more likely it will break in the 
direction of the test...It should be noted that if the dollar were to rise 
further then this will be bad news for US stock. Up until now, they have been 
rising and falling in unison. This relationship cannot continue indefinitely as 
the appreciating dollar is supposed to weigh on company earnings.

European bond yields are unlikely to rise as fast as those in the US following 
Donald Trump’s shock presidential election victory, says Capital Economics 
Simon MacAdam:

In the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, we are 
nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe. But we still 
don’t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.

Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th 
November. This reflects investors’ expectations of a major fiscal stimulus 
under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly 
boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets 
Update, “New – even more bearish – forecasts for Treasuries”, published on 
Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the 
increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European 
government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead.

For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in 
Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace 
of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this 
month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And 
there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone.

Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary 
pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater 
degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the 
euro-zone.

Third, following the UK’s Brexit vote, Trump’s victory has stoked fears of 
more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in 
France, in spring’s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already 
benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived 
political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to 
contain yields there.
 
Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new 
peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With 
bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump’s presidency could 
see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial 
beneficiary.

In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to 
their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest 
for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However 
bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their 
highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably 
buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this 
has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries.

In equities, the final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2 
 * But Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the 
country’s forthcoming referendum 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points 
at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934.
 
US technology stocks are missing out on the market’s current rally, on fears 
that some of Donald Trump’s policies will prove unfavourable.

Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of 
retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple’s expansion plans. Even the 
prospect of tax breaks allowing such companies to repatriate some of their cash 
piles has not proved to be much support for the shares.

Nor are the major tech companies likely to benefit from Trump’s proposed 
programme of infrastructure spending, said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC 
Markets:

Tech stocks like Facebook and Netflix won’t get any government contracts in a 
rise in infrastructure spending but Chinese expansion plans are at risk by 
possible trade tariffs.

So Apple is currently down 3.2% while Facebook has fallen 3.7%.
 
More fallout from the strong dollar: oil prices are heading lower again.

It is not just the dollar hitting crude, however. Investors had been hoping 
that a key Opec meeting at the end of this month would agree measures to curb 
output and thus support prices. But the closer the meeting gets, the more the 
doubts grow and put pressure on the crude price.

So Brent is currently down 1.59% at $44.04 a barrel while West Texax 
Intermediate has slipped 1.68% to £42.68.
 
Over in Greece, government officials are preparing for a new round of talks 
with inspectors representing the country’s foreign lenders followingBarack 
Obama’s extraordinary call for Athens to be granted “meaningful debt relief.” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/13/barack-obama-calls-for-meaningful-debt-relief-for-greece>
 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports:

Rarely has there been such desire from a sitting government in Athens to 
conclude a review with auditors representing the bodies that have thrice bailed 
out Greece since 2010. Highlighting that sentiment, the new government 
spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters earlier that differences 
between the two are “very small.”

The talks, which begin in earnest tomorrow, will focus on an overhaul of 
labour laws including annulment of collective work agreements and mass firings 
(a red line many in the ruling left wing Syriza party), privatisations and 
primary surplus targets for 2019. Next year’s budget will also be discussed. 
The goal – one dismissed as untenable by most – is for the inspection tour to 
be wrapped up in a matter of days in the hope that debt relief talks can begin 
when euro zone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on 
December 5.

If debt-serving costs are brought down, it will reduce the need for the 
country to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018 – a target set by lenders but 
almost unequivocally derided as impossible to meet.

Ahead of president Barack Obama’s arrival in the Greek capital on Tuesday the 
government has gone out of its way to play up the two-day visit with 
Tzanakopoulos saying today that it had not only been heartened by his 
intervention on the matter of Greek debt but calling the tour one of great 
significance. The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to 
Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama’s last state 
visit abroad.

To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long 
called “unmanageable.” Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring 
pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in 
talks between the two on Wednesday.
 
The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits 
from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US 
election result.

Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450. But against 
the euro, the pound is holding steady, up 0.09% at €1.1622.
 
US markets are on the rise at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
reaching a new record high - just two trading days after the previous peak.

The Dow is currently up around 45 points or o.24% at 18893, having reached 
18,918, ahead of the previous record of 18,873 hit last Thursday, as equities 
continued to welcome Donald Trump’s election victory, even if bond markets do 
not.

The S&P 500 opened up 0.21% while the Nasdaq composite added 0.15% initially.
 
Time for a quick catch up.

The bond market has suffered fresh losses today as investors rapidly adjust to 
the prospect of Donald Trump taking control of the world’s largest economy.

Debt prices have fallen sharply again, adding to last week’s $1trn bloodbath, 
on the prospect that we’re entering a world of higher inflation, interest rate 
hikes, political uncertainty and possibly trade disputes too.

The selloff has hit US bond prices. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/14/uk-borrowing-costs-may-high-bonds-trump-business-live?page=with:block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99#block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99>
 The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, 
rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week.

Shorter-dated two-year debt, and long-dated 30-year bonds, also hit their 
weakest points since the start of the year.

Investors are betting that Trump’s infrastructure programme, and his plan to 
cut taxes, will reflate the US economy.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, believes the bond market selloff 
could intensify:

“The sentiment surrounding a rate hike has been flip-flopping and that only 
makes bond buying, especially at around the 1% mark for two-year bills, a more 
appealing proposition.

“President Trump’s pledge to pile resources into infrastructure to ‘Make 
America Great Again’ has arguably upped the risk of investing in Treasury 
yields. The 11-month high of 1% might not be the high water mark for 2016 as 
Trump’s economic policy is put into action.”

against a broad basket of currencies. It’s also gained one cent against the UK 
pound, at around $1.25.

And the markets reckon that the Federal Reserve is nailed on to raise US 
interest rates in December:

, and simply isn’t necessary right now.

 * Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers thinks the infrastructure plan 
appears to be badly designed

 * And George Magnus, UBS’s well-respected former chief economist, fears that 
Trump could trigger pain through the global economy if he takes a protectionist 
approach

.
 
Over the weekend, Trump started to step back from some of his more extreme 
positions.

That wall between America and Mexico might be downgraded to a mere fence, in 
places, for example.

And investors find that sort of u-turn encouraging, says Naeem Aslam of Think 
Markets:

Markets are showing that investors continue to believe the fiscal policy plans 
by Mr Trump and they want to pile their bets in equities. A risk on trade has 
become the famous trade amid traders and hence for the past week, since Trump’s 
victory, we are seeing the precious metal along with other safe haven like the 
Japanese yen selling off sharply.

Mr Trump has delivered many watered down versions of his controversial views 
over the weekend. This has restored further confidence that the person in 
charge of the biggest economy of the world, has started to think more logically.

It is this certainty which investors are applauding.

However... appointing the head of far-right website Breitbart as “chief 
strategist and senior counselor” doesn’t suggest Trump is backing away from the 
view that appalled liberal critics.

Donald Trump’s shock win is an alarm call to moderate politicians to improve 
workers’ conditions, argues the head of the International Labour Organisation.

Guy Ryder believes that the US election result, and the Brexit vote, show that 
many workers feel sidelined and ‘dispossessed’ in today’s economy:

He tells us:

“The societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation 
and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are 
getting a raw deal.

“It is the people who feel they haven’t benefited from globalisation and from 
the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the 
dispossessed in that regard.”

We now have a hat-trick of warnings about Donald Trump’s economic plans.

George Magnus, the former chief economist of UBS, is very concerned that the 
next president could kick off a trade war that harms America’s economy, and the 
rest of the world too.

In a new blogpost, Magnus writes 
<http://www.georgemagnus.com/trumps-economics-are-a-hybrid-of-possibly-good-and-seriously-awful/>
:

Trump’s vehemently anti-free trade rhetoric has included the threat to rip up 
or change NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Association agreement, including 
the possibility of levying tariffs on Mexico, and this, on top of erecting the 
wall, or otherwise restricting immigration. He has threatened China with heavy 
tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its 
currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that 
was central to President Obama’s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying 
to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership, its own version of America’s TPP.

If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading 
agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would 
protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just 
tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do 
have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global 
trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread 
through the global economy.

Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure 
spending plan, but he’s less impressed by Trump’s tax cuts, as they’ll mainly 
benefit the better off.
Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner)

 <https://twitter.com/SteveRattner/status/798158448072527873> 
And the other BIG worry is that Trump could drives up the US national debt to 
alarming levels.

Magnus says:

The other major concern about Trumponomics is about a mishandled fiscal 
expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal 
deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt. The bipartisan and independent 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we 
know of Trump’s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 
trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 
trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. 
increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 
per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth 
becomes seriously impaired.

The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes 
mired again in rising public deficits – remember debt will be rising anyway in 
the 2020’s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external 
deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic 
instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then 
an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for 
de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be 
accentuated.

 * There have been heavy losses across the government bond markets today, both

 * The cost of insuring those bonds against default, using a credit default 
swap, has risen (showing that investors see government debt as riskier)

Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers shares JP Morgan’s concerns about 
Trump’s infrastructure investment plan.

Writing in the Financial Times, Summers argues that the scheme won’t address 
the parts of America that most need improving, won’t get key private sector 
investors involved, and risks pushing borrowing to dangerous levels:

Summers argues:

Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur 
Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total 
private sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, 
not reach many of the most important investors, and involve substantial 
mis-targeting of public resources.

Many of the highest return infrastructure investments — such as improving 
roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or 
modernising the air traffic control system — do not generate a commercial 
return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension 
funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising 
sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program.

I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any 
responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some 
combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis.

Here’s the full piece:

A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class 
<https://www.ft.com/content/2673c232-a9b2-11e6-a0bb-97f42551dbf4>

Donald Trump’s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation’s 
infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan’s chief global 
strategist, David Kelly.


In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not 
under-performing at present, and wouldn’t be helped by a large debt-fuelled 
stimulus.

Kelly is also concerned that Trump’s proposed tax cut plans would send the 
national debt clock up to 100% of national output.

First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the 
economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more 
likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP 
growth.

The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 
to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, 
under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 
to 86% in fiscal 2026.

However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump’s fiscal plans, the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the 
debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these 
plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, 
although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact.

Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows 
that the plan would be pricy:

It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury 
rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much 
greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the 
financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but 
the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a 
debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous.

The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless.

And if that wasn’t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn’t 
need a stimulus boost right now:

The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The 
overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over 
the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has 
been 98% of the time over the past 50 years.

Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially 
in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged 
down.

But... if Kelly’s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate 
America’s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not 
sparking a manufacturing revival).

He concludes:

In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would 
likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the 
U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits 
should lead to higher interest rates – particularly if the Federal Reserve 
perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest 
rates.

The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. 
Immigration reform designed toincrease skilled immigrants or policies that 
boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. 
However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate 
demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating.

Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime 
minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month.

Renzi hinted this morning that he might quit if the public reject the proposal 
to reform the Senate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/could-italys-renzi-be-next-victim-of-an-unwanted-referendum>
.

Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared:

If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before 
me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.”

Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close.

The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and 
the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of 
inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of 
stagnation and political quicksand).
