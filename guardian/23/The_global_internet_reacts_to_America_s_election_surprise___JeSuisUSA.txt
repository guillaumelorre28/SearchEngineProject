Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. A man who has been 
criticised for misogyny, whipping up xenophobic hysteria about migrants living 
in the US, andrejecting climate science

, and who told Japan and South Korea to “enjoy themselves” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-north-korea-war-nuclear-weapons>
 if they were to wage nuclear war on North Korea, is set to take power in one 
of the most powerful countries in the world.

By 1pm GMT on Wednesday the word Trump had been tweeted tens of millions of 
times, and internet users around the world have reacted to the news with a mix 
of dark humour, fear, and hope for what might be next.

#JeSuisUSA

After the offices of Charlie Hebdo were attacked by extremists in Paris last 
Januarymillions got <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-35108339> behind 
the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie in solidarity against the violence. The “Je Suis” (I 
am) sentiment has since been used in many sad circumstances, from mourning the 
victims of Boko Haram in northern Nigeria to bombings in Beirut.

Today this has been adapted yet again as people mourn the election result 
using #JeSuisUSA. Many adapted the image of the Statue of Liberty, a proud 
symbol of America’s history of welcoming immigrants, to one of despair.

In Turkey Trump = Erdoğan

In Turkey a photo with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan added to the ballot paper went 
viral, said the CNN correspondent Will Ripley, who is in the country. “Many 
here compare US president-elect Trump to their own president,” he explained – a 
president who has ruled with an increasingly iron fist,locking up opposition 
politicians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/turkish-opposition-condemns-arrest-of-kurdish-officials>
 and journalists who dare to criticise him.

#Michellefor2020 

Support started growing for Michelle Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama> to run for president next

could she help make things more secure?

Africans on the world #NowThatTrumpIsPresident 


As the news broke, many Africans got behind the #NowThatTrumpIsPresident 
hashtag on Twitter, pondering what would happen to their relatives living in 
the US. Would there be a mass exodus?

And finally … the view from North Korea

While North Koreans are not given a platform to express their own views, the 
government’s official news site KCNA put out two familiar statements online 
criticising Obama, but neglecting to mention the election result. The first 
criticised “wretched” society, with a “lingering structure of racial 
discrimination”, a record they say leaves the US with “no qualifications to be 
a ‘human rights judge’”.The second 
<https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1478685774-408117525/kcna-commentary-on-u-s-failed-policy-towards-dprk/>
 said that the sitting president’s sanctions against the DPRK were unworkable 
and had failed in preventing the expansion of the nuclear weapons programme.
State media previously said 
<https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1478685774-408117525/kcna-commentary-on-u-s-failed-policy-towards-dprk/>
 that they hoped that Trump, a “wise politician” and “prescient presidential 
candidate”, would be victorious.
