Final thoughts

It looks like Richard Jefferson got away with tripping Kevin Durant on that 
last possession, expect that to be a topic of discussion for a spell. In any 
case, it shouldn’t take too much away from what was about as big of a regular 
season win that a team could possibly have.

There’s plenty more basketball going on today, but this will be the end of our 
Christmas Day liveblogging. Thanks to everyone who decided to spend a small 
portion of today with us here at the Guardian. Ciao!

Cavaliers win!

Warriors 108-109 Cavaliers, FINAL

The Cavaliers take a 20 second timeout. Out of the timeout, Jefferson attempts 
the game-tying three. It’s not a wise idea.

But Iguodala turns it over on the other end, Irving makes the steal and makes 
a layup It’s a one point game and the Warriors get called for a shot clock 
violation! The Cavaliers have the ball. Irving hits a basket and the Cavaliers 
have the lead!

The Warriors take a timeout with three seconds left on the clock. Durant 
misses a three pointer out of the timeout and the Cavaliers hold on for a HUGE 
WIN.

Warriors 108-105 Cavaliers, 1:14, 4th quarter

Draymond Green with the dunk! The Warriors have tied it.

And Klay Thompson blocks Irving on the other end! Durant gets the rebound and 
he gets it to Steph Curry, who has been off for the first 46 minutes of the 
game, hits a three-pointer right when his team needed it most!

Warriors 103-105 Cavaliers, 1:43, 4th quarter

Durant misses a jumper, Shumpert gets the biggest rebound in the game. James 
gets the ball back, takes it to the basket for a layup AND he draws a foul on 
Green!

But he misses the free throw.

Warriors 103-99 Cavaliers, 3:46, 4th quarter

Durant attempts to settle things down by getting to the line and making his 
free throws but the game refuses to settle. Iman Shumpert hits one from 
downtown and it’s just a two point game.

Curry, who has not had a great game by his own standards, gets a layup but 
suddenly the Warriors can’t get any stops. Richard Jefferson drives to the 
basket like a player half his age and throws down a dunk.

Green hits a basket and the Cavaliers immediately call a timeout.

Warriors 97-94 Cavaliers, 5:20, 4th quarter

Green picks up his fourth foul, the Warriors really really really don’t need 
that right now. Green’s visibly not happy to the point where the crowd wants a 
technical, which would mean an automatic ejection, but that’s not happening.

Warriors 97-94 Cavaliers, 6:11, 4th quarter

Green quiets things down with a dunk, but only briefly as Irving immediately 
hits a three-pointer and it’s a one possession game.

Warriors 95-91 Cavaliers, 6:31, 4th quarter

LeBron picks off Draymond. Curry fouls Jefferson to put him on the line. 
Jefferson makes both free throws and just like that it’s a four point game. 
This is officially a game once more.

LeBron James is back in the game, maybe a little earlier than Lue would have 
liked but, well, this might be the game right here.

Klay Thompson missses a three-pointer, Love gets the rebound… Love makes a 
layup!

Warriors 95-87 Cavaliers, 7:33, 4th quarter

Finally something good for Cleveland. Shumpert to Love for a dunk to sporadic 
cheers. The crowd is starting to become aware of the deficit and the rapidly 
decreasing clock.

They perk up on the next sequence. Durant misses a jumper, the Cavaliers 
regain possession. DeAndre Liggins, whose knees are apparently okay, gets the 
ball to Irving who hits a huge three-pointer that gives Cleveland new life.

The Warriors take a time out.

Warriors 95-82 Cavaliers, 9:19, 4th quarter

Out of the timeout, Jefferson drives to the basket for a dunk BUT he then 
picks up a technical. There’s a roughly 0% chance that Durant will miss the 
technical free throw.

And yep, he drills it. One step forward, one step back for Cleveland.

Warriors 94-80 Cavaliers, 9:34, 4th quarter

Kevin Durant with the layup AND the foul. He makes the “and one” and then, 
after Love misses a three pointer, he snags the rebound and makes his second 
straight basket.

It’s a 14 point Warriors lead and the Cavaliers have to take a timeout just to 
figure out exactly what just happened.

Warriors 87-80 Cavaliers, end of the 3rd quarter

Just when it looks like the Warriors can end this quarter on an exclamation 
point, Durant gets called for a foul on LeBron with a second left on the clock. 
Luckily for Golden State, LeBron only makes one of two free throws.

Warriors 87-79 Cavaliers, :28, 3rd quarter

And here come the Warriors.

Durant hits a two-pointer. Green gets on the right side of a foul call for 
once and goes to the line, making one of two free throws.

Iman Shumpert gets to the line for Cleveland but he misses his two attempts. 
On the other end, Ian Clark hits a jumper. Durant drives to the basket for a 
dunk to cap off the Golden State run.

Warriors 79-77 Cavaliers, 1:42, 3rd quarter

Draymond Green quiets the crowd down a bit with a dunk. It’s never fun when 
the other team’s heel is the one to damper momentum.

There’s no way to damper LeBron, though. He makes a layup and then tries for 
another three-pointer…

And this time it’s a miss.

Warriors 77-75 Cavaliers, 2:31, 3rd quarter

Curry has been fairly cold on the court, but he’s still getting to free throw 
line. After getting fouled by Frye, he knocks down both of the free throws.

And another three-pointer from LeBron! He’s been more like Steph Curry than 
Steph Curry this quarter.

Warriors 75-72 Cavaliers, 4:03, 3rd quarter

And out of the timeout, Klay Thompson takes an Iguodala pass and immediately 
fires off a three-pointer that’s right on the money. Curry steals a Frye pass, 
but Irving steals it right back and drives to the basket for a layup.

JaVale McGee pulls a JaVale McGee by missing a dunk, to the delight of the 
Quicken Loans crowd. Klay Thompson hits a three but the Other Thompson makes a

a timeout.

Warriors 69-67 Cavaliers, 5:56, 3rd quarter

Durant misses a three. Tristan Thompson grabs the rebound and draws yet 
another JaVale McGee foul. Thompson makes one of two free throws. It feels like 
the Cavaliers are going 1-or-2 a lot in this game, something which could hurt 
them considering this may end up being a one possession game at the end.

Klay Thompson answers with a three pointer and LeBron answers Thompson’s 
answer with his third straight three. The crowd is as loud as it has been all 
game long now.

Although they quiet down a bit when Green converts a defensive rebound into a 
layup to increase the Golden State lead back to 3. Cleveland takes a timeout.

Warriors 64-63 Cavaliers, 8:10, 3rd quarter

Tristan Thompson gets to the line, makes one.of two. 

And then a big swing for Cleveland. Kevin Love gets called fora foul that puts 
McGee to the line. JaVale misses both shots, but that’s four fouls on Love now. 
The Cavaliers pull him and bring Frye into the game.

But LeBron James nails a three pointer. The crowd jolts up a bit.

Warriors 64-59 Cavaliers, 8:55, 3rd quarter

Curry corrals a bad pass from LeBron and just barely makes the first field 
goal in nearly two minutes. LeBron responds by hitting a three, but Durant 
immediately responds with a short-ish jumper.

This game feels like it could end up being a Durant/James battle. I would be 
okay with this.

Warriors 60-56 Cavaliers, 10:10, 3rd quarter

And after that dramatic opening, nobody on either team manages to make a field 
goal. Durant does get to the line and makes two free throws to increase the 
Warriors lead.

Warriors 58-56 Cavaliers, 11:00, 3rd quarter

Pachulia gets fouled and, after a relatively brief review (as far as reviews 
go), Love goes to the line where he hits one of two free throws.

2nd half begins!

Warriors 58-55 Cavaliers, 11:33, 3rd quarter.

Well that’s one way to start a second half. Kevin Love immediately hits a 
three to tie the game and Kevin Durant responds with a three that swiftly 
unties it.

Since this is technically Christmas I suppose I should provide some holiday 
themed content here during the break in action. So here it goes: The true 
meaning of Christmas is learning that Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take 
It” is actually a rewrite of “Come All Ye Faithful.”


Not basketball related, no, but This. Is. Everything.

I’m not saying it’s better than “The Block” from back in the Finals, but man 
it’s certainly not less impressive.

Halftime

Well that’s certainly one way to end a half. The Warriors have a three point 
lead but you have to think the Cavaliers have reasons to feel good heading back 
to the locker room, which you couldn’t have said even a minute of game time 
earlier.

End of the first half

Warriors 55-52 Cavaliers, end of the first half

Durant hits a three-pointer but James answers with a layup and then, on the 
other end of the floor, makes a TREMENDOUS block on a Pachulia layup. HOLY HECK.

Aaaand LeBron ties the game with a layup! What did I say about this game 
starting ugly but finishing strong.

Warriors 50-48 Cavaliers, 1:42, 2nd quarter

And here’s how a lead starts to crumble: the Warriors keep sending the 
Cavaliers to the line and they stop missing. Love and Tristan Thompson go 
4-for-4 on the line. It’s a two point game.

Warriors 50-44 Cavaliers, 2:55, 2nd quarter

If you allow the Cavaliers to keep getting rebounds, they will eventually burn 
you. It takes four of them, one defensive and then three straight offensive 
ones, before Livingston finally fouls LeBron.

It could go worse for the Warriors, James only hits one of two.

Warriors 50-43 Cavaliers, 3:29, 2nd quarter

Love is back in the game for Liggins. Curry hits a three-pointer, his first 
made field goal of the game. Love’s return plays instant dividends for 
Cleveland as he draws a foul and hits two free throws.

And then Jefferson gets called for a foul that sends Curry to the line. Curry 
actually misses one of the free throws, something which my brain doesn’t ever 
quite process.

Warriors 46-38 Cavaliers, 4:37, 2nd quarter

Out of the timeout, Jefferson misses a jumper. They do however get a bit of a 
break as Green picks up his third personal foul already.

Bad news for the Cavaliers, Liggins hurts his knee on the floor. The 
Cavaliers’ bench is already fairly thin, so this could hurt them. They take a 
full timeout.

Thompson steals a Jefferson pass and gets it to Livingston, whom Jefferson 
fouls on the way to the basket. He makes both free throws. Jefferson’s day 
doesn’t get much better from there, as his jumper gets blocked by Durant. On 
the other end, Green makes a layup and this is starting to get away for 
Cleveland.

Warriors 40-32 Cavaliers, 8:03, 2nd quarter

Draymond Green, who seems to have calmed down after a first quarter that saw 
him holdback by half the Warriors’ lineup, gets a layup right under the basket. 
After Klay Thompson makes another three, Cleveland calls a timeout to try to 
regroup. It feels like Cleveland has been playing better, but you look at the 
standings and Golden State has their largest lead yet.

David West with the basket AND the foul. He makes his free throw and then, 
holy heck, it’s Channing Frye once again with the dunk!

Warriors 32-30 Cavaliers, 9:48, 2nd quarter

A wonky sequence here for the Cavs. Shump misses a three pointer, but LeBron 
gets the rebound. Jefferson attempts a three, and his try also misses the mark. 
Shumpert gets the rebound and gets it to Frye who jolts the crowd awake with a 
dunk.

On the other end, Klay Thompson hits a jumper. 

And, hey, Channing Frye just hit a three-pointer? Is this going to be The 
Channing Frye Game? The Warriors call a timeout to figure out exactly how this 
is happening.

James attempts to start the second quarter with a three pointer but he misses, 
Shaun Livingston gets the defensive rebound and gets the ball to Thompson who

It looks like Richard Jefferson got away with tripping Kevin Durant on that 
last possession, expect that to be a topic of discussion for a spell. In any 
case, it shouldn’t take too much away from what was about as big of a regular 
season win that a team could possibly have.

There’s plenty more basketball going on today, but this will be the end of our 
Christmas Day liveblogging. Thanks to everyone who decided to spend a small 
portion of today with us here at the Guardian. Ciao!

 
Warriors 108-109 Cavaliers, FINAL

The Cavaliers take a 20 second timeout. Out of the timeout, Jefferson attempts 
the game-tying three. It’s not a wise idea.

But Iguodala turns it over on the other end, Irving makes the steal and makes 
a layup It’s a one point game and the Warriors get called for a shot clock 
violation! The Cavaliers have the ball. Irving hits a basket and the Cavaliers 
have the lead!

The Warriors take a timeout with three seconds left on the clock. Durant 
misses a three pointer out of the timeout and the Cavaliers hold on for a HUGE 
WIN.
 
Warriors 108-105 Cavaliers, 1:14, 4th quarter

Draymond Green with the dunk! The Warriors have tied it.

And Klay Thompson blocks Irving on the other end! Durant gets the rebound and 
he gets it to Steph Curry, who has been off for the first 46 minutes of the 
game, hits a three-pointer right when his team needed it most!
 
Warriors 103-105 Cavaliers, 1:43, 4th quarter

Durant misses a jumper, Shumpert gets the biggest rebound in the game. James 
gets the ball back, takes it to the basket for a layup AND he draws a foul on 
Green!

But he misses the free throw.
 
Warriors 103-103 Cavaliers, 2:17, 4th quarter

LeBron cuts the Warriors lead back down to two with a dunk and the Warriors 
have now gone cold. Irving picks off a Green pas and makes a layup AND WE ARE 
TIED!
 
Warriors 103-99 Cavaliers, 3:46, 4th quarter

Durant attempts to settle things down by getting to the line and making his 
free throws but the game refuses to settle. Iman Shumpert hits one from 
downtown and it’s just a two point game.

Curry, who has not had a great game by his own standards, gets a layup but 
suddenly the Warriors can’t get any stops. Richard Jefferson drives to the 
basket like a player half his age and throws down a dunk.

Green hits a basket and the Cavaliers immediately call a timeout.
 
Warriors 97-94 Cavaliers, 5:20, 4th quarter

Green picks up his fourth foul, the Warriors really really really don’t need 
that right now. Green’s visibly not happy to the point where the crowd wants a 
technical, which would mean an automatic ejection, but that’s not happening.
 
Warriors 97-94 Cavaliers, 6:11, 4th quarter

Green quiets things down with a dunk, but only briefly as Irving immediately 
hits a three-pointer and it’s a one possession game.
 
Warriors 95-91 Cavaliers, 6:31, 4th quarter

LeBron picks off Draymond. Curry fouls Jefferson to put him on the line. 
Jefferson makes both free throws and just like that it’s a four point game. 
This is officially a game once more.
 
Warriors 95-89 Cavaliers, 7:13, 4th quarter

LeBron James is back in the game, maybe a little earlier than Lue would have 
liked but, well, this might be the game right here.

Klay Thompson missses a three-pointer, Love gets the rebound… Love makes a 
layup!
 
Warriors 95-87 Cavaliers, 7:33, 4th quarter

Finally something good for Cleveland. Shumpert to Love for a dunk to sporadic 
cheers. The crowd is starting to become aware of the deficit and the rapidly 
decreasing clock.

They perk up on the next sequence. Durant misses a jumper, the Cavaliers 
regain possession. DeAndre Liggins, whose knees are apparently okay, gets the 
ball to Irving who hits a huge three-pointer that gives Cleveland new life.

The Warriors take a time out.
 
Warriors 95-82 Cavaliers, 9:19, 4th quarter

Out of the timeout, Jefferson drives to the basket for a dunk BUT he then 
picks up a technical. There’s a roughly 0% chance that Durant will miss the 
technical free throw.

And yep, he drills it. One step forward, one step back for Cleveland.
 
Basketball is all in the eyes of the beholder.

Warriors 94-80 Cavaliers, 9:34, 4th quarter

Kevin Durant with the layup AND the foul. He makes the “and one” and then, 
after Love misses a three pointer, he snags the rebound and makes his second 
straight basket.

It’s a 14 point Warriors lead and the Cavaliers have to take a timeout just to 
figure out exactly what just happened.
 
Warriors 89-80 Cavaliers, 10:33, 4th quarter

Another great block in this game as Shumpert rejects Iguodala at the rim.
 
Warriors 89-80 Cavaliers, 11:22, 4th quarter

Durant starts off the fourth quarter by missing a mid-range jumper. Love 
collects the rebound, but Irving loses it out-of-bounds. A foul on Jefferson 
gets the ball back to the Warriors. Thompson drives to the basket for a layup 
to increase the Warriors lead to 9 points.
 
Warriors 87-80 Cavaliers, end of the 3rd quarter

Just when it looks like the Warriors can end this quarter on an exclamation 
point, Durant gets called for a foul on LeBron with a second left on the clock. 
Luckily for Golden State, LeBron only makes one of two free throws.
 
Warriors 87-79 Cavaliers, :28, 3rd quarter

And here come the Warriors.

Durant hits a two-pointer. Green gets on the right side of a foul call for 
once and goes to the line, making one of two free throws.

Iman Shumpert gets to the line for Cleveland but he misses his two attempts. 
On the other end, Ian Clark hits a jumper. Durant drives to the basket for a 
dunk to cap off the Golden State run.
 
Warriors 79-77 Cavaliers, 1:42, 3rd quarter

Draymond Green quiets the crowd down a bit with a dunk. It’s never fun when 
the other team’s heel is the one to damper momentum.

There’s no way to damper LeBron, though. He makes a layup and then tries for 
another three-pointer…

And this time it’s a miss.
 
Warriors 77-75 Cavaliers, 2:31, 3rd quarter

Curry has been fairly cold on the court, but he’s still getting to free throw 
line. After getting fouled by Frye, he knocks down both of the free throws.

And another three-pointer from LeBron! He’s been more like Steph Curry than 
Steph Curry this quarter.
 
Warriors 75-72 Cavaliers, 4:03, 3rd quarter

And out of the timeout, Klay Thompson takes an Iguodala pass and immediately 
fires off a three-pointer that’s right on the money. Curry steals a Frye pass, 
but Irving steals it right back and drives to the basket for a layup.
 
Warriors 72-70 Cavaliers, 4:58, 3rd quarter

JaVale McGee pulls a JaVale McGee by missing a dunk, to the delight of the 
Quicken Loans crowd. Klay Thompson hits a three but the Other Thompson makes a 
dunk on the other end and that convinces Warriors head coach Steve Kerr to call 
a timeout.
 
Warriors 69-67 Cavaliers, 5:56, 3rd quarter

Durant misses a three. Tristan Thompson grabs the rebound and draws yet 
another JaVale McGee foul. Thompson makes one of two free throws. It feels like 
the Cavaliers are going 1-or-2 a lot in this game, something which could hurt 
them considering this may end up being a one possession game at the end.
 
Warriors 69-67 Cavaliers, 6:18, 3rd quarter

Out of the timeout, James gets to the line after a whistle goes against McGee. 
James makes one of two.
 
Warriors 69-66 Cavaliers, 6:28, 3rd quarter

Klay Thompson answers with a three pointer and LeBron answers Thompson’s 
answer with his third straight three. The crowd is as loud as it has been all 
game long now.

Although they quiet down a bit when Green converts a defensive rebound into a 
layup to increase the Golden State lead back to 3. Cleveland takes a timeout.
 
Warriors 64-63 Cavaliers, 8:10, 3rd quarter

Tristan Thompson gets to the line, makes one.of two. 

And then a big swing for Cleveland. Kevin Love gets called fora foul that puts 
McGee to the line. JaVale misses both shots, but that’s four fouls on Love now. 
The Cavaliers pull him and bring Frye into the game.

But LeBron James nails a three pointer. The crowd jolts up a bit.
 
Warriors 64-59 Cavaliers, 8:55, 3rd quarter

Curry corrals a bad pass from LeBron and just barely makes the first field 
goal in nearly two minutes. LeBron responds by hitting a three, but Durant 
immediately responds with a short-ish jumper.

This game feels like it could end up being a Durant/James battle. I would be 
okay with this.
 
Warriors 60-56 Cavaliers, 10:10, 3rd quarter

And after that dramatic opening, nobody on either team manages to make a field 
goal. Durant does get to the line and makes two free throws to increase the 
Warriors lead.
 
Warriors 58-56 Cavaliers, 11:00, 3rd quarter

Pachulia gets fouled and, after a relatively brief review (as far as reviews 
go), Love goes to the line where he hits one of two free throws.
 
Warriors 58-55 Cavaliers, 11:33, 3rd quarter.

Well that’s one way to start a second half. Kevin Love immediately hits a 
three to tie the game and Kevin Durant responds with a three that swiftly 
unties it.

I resemble that remark.

 
Since this is technically Christmas I suppose I should provide some holiday 
themed content here during the break in action. So here it goes: The true 
meaning of Christmas is learning that Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take 
It” is actually a rewrite of “Come All Ye Faithful.”


Not basketball related, no, but This. Is. Everything.

 
HOW THE HECK DID HE GET BACK THERE

I’m not saying it’s better than “The Block” from back in the Finals, but man 
it’s certainly not less impressive.

 
Well that’s certainly one way to end a half. The Warriors have a three point 
lead but you have to think the Cavaliers have reasons to feel good heading back 
to the locker room, which you couldn’t have said even a minute of game time 
earlier.

 
Warriors 55-52 Cavaliers, end of the first half

Durant hits a three-pointer but James answers with a layup and then, on the 
other end of the floor, makes a TREMENDOUS block on a Pachulia layup. HOLY HECK.
 
Warriors 52-50 Cavaliers, :44, 2nd quarter

Aaaand LeBron ties the game with a layup! What did I say about this game 
starting ugly but finishing strong.

Zaza Paculia tips in Andre Iguodala’s jumper to give the Warriors the lead 
back.

 
Warriors 50-48 Cavaliers, 1:42, 2nd quarter

And here’s how a lead starts to crumble: the Warriors keep sending the 
Cavaliers to the line and they stop missing. Love and Tristan Thompson go 
4-for-4 on the line. It’s a two point game.

 
Warriors 50-44 Cavaliers, 2:55, 2nd quarter

If you allow the Cavaliers to keep getting rebounds, they will eventually burn 
you. It takes four of them, one defensive and then three straight offensive 
ones, before Livingston finally fouls LeBron.

It could go worse for the Warriors, James only hits one of two.
 
Warriors 50-43 Cavaliers, 3:29, 2nd quarter

Love is back in the game for Liggins. Curry hits a three-pointer, his first 
made field goal of the game. Love’s return plays instant dividends for 
Cleveland as he draws a foul and hits two free throws.

And then Jefferson gets called for a foul that sends Curry to the line. Curry 
actually misses one of the free throws, something which my brain doesn’t ever 
quite process.
 
Warriors 46-38 Cavaliers, 4:37, 2nd quarter

Out of the timeout, Jefferson misses a jumper. They do however get a bit of a 
break as Green picks up his third personal foul already.

Bad news for the Cavaliers, Liggins hurts his knee on the floor. The 
Cavaliers’ bench is already fairly thin, so this could hurt them. They take a 
full timeout.

 
Warriors 46-38 Cavaliers, 5:05, 2nd quarter

Thompson rebounds a missed Irving jumper and scores. The two teams trade 
turnovers for a few possessions before Durant makes a dunk that forces Tyronn 
Lue to take a timeout.

 
Warriors 44-38 Cavaliers, 5:54, 2nd quarter

Thompson steals a Jefferson pass and gets it to Livingston, whom Jefferson 
fouls on the way to the basket. He makes both free throws. Jefferson’s day 
doesn’t get much better from there, as his jumper gets blocked by Durant. On 
the other end, Green makes a layup and this is starting to get away for 
Cleveland.

 
Warriors 40-36 Cavaliers, 7:11, 2nd quarter

Out of the timeout, Irving gets a relatively easy basket. West misses a layup, 
giving the ball back to Cleveland. Irving also misses a layup, but he’s able to 
tip it back in.

 
Warriors 40-32 Cavaliers, 8:03, 2nd quarter

Draymond Green, who seems to have calmed down after a first quarter that saw 
him holdback by half the Warriors’ lineup, gets a layup right under the basket. 
After Klay Thompson makes another three, Cleveland calls a timeout to try to 
regroup. It feels like Cleveland has been playing better, but you look at the 
standings and Golden State has their largest lead yet.

 
Warriors 35-32 Cavaliers, 9:17, 2nd quarter

David West with the basket AND the foul. He makes his free throw and then, 
holy heck, it’s Channing Frye once again with the dunk!
 
Warriors 32-30 Cavaliers, 9:48, 2nd quarter

A wonky sequence here for the Cavs. Shump misses a three pointer, but LeBron 
gets the rebound. Jefferson attempts a three, and his try also misses the mark. 
Shumpert gets the rebound and gets it to Frye who jolts the crowd awake with a 
dunk.

On the other end, Klay Thompson hits a jumper. 

And, hey, Channing Frye just hit a three-pointer? Is this going to be The 
Channing Frye Game? The Warriors call a timeout to figure out exactly how this 
is happening.

 
Warriors 30-25 Cavaliers, 11:21, 2nd quarter

It’s Kevin Durant’s game so far. He’s got 12 points in 12 minutes along with 4 
rebounds.

James attempts to start the second quarter with a three pointer but he misses, 
Shaun Livingston gets the defensive rebound and gets the ball to Thompson who 
drills his three-pointer.
 
Warriors 27-25 Cavaliers, end of the 1st quarter

Klay Thompson gets to the line, that’s a foul on Shump, and hits one of two 
free throws. On the other end, Shump draws a foul, that’s on West, and he makes 
both.to tie the game.

But only briefly, West assists Thompson with a layup to put a bow on he first 
quarter.
