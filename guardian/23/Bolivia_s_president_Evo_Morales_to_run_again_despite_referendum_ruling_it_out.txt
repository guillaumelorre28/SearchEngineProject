Bolivia’s first indigenous president was first elected in 2005, and then 
re-elected in 2009 and 2014. But he narrowly lost a referendum earlier this 
year on whether the constitution should be revised to allow him to run again in 
2019. His current term expires on 22 January, 2020.

Bolivia’s constitution only allows two consecutive terms in office. He had 
sought to raise it to three straight terms. While this next election would be 
for his fourth, the constitutional tribunal has ruled his first term in office 
does not count since Morales did not complete the full five-year term. This is 
because in 2009 the government changed the constitution to make Bolivia a
plurinational state <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurinationalism> instead of 
a republic.

The ruling party said it was considering four ways to allow Morales to run 
again, including the possibilities of changing the constitution through the 
legislative assembly or a signature-collection drive. Other possibilities 
include having Morales step down six months early or asking the constitutional 
tribunal for another interpretation.

But the opposition said any Morales re-election bid would be unconstitutional 
because of the referendum. “No means no,” said opposition leader Jorge Quiroga.
