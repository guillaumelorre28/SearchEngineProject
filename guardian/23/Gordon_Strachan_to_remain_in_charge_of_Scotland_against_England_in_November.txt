Strachan’s future had been in doubt after a 3-0 defeat in Slovakia

 on Tuesday followed a 1-1 drawat home against Lithuania

 in Group F. However, the discussions established that there was no appetite on 
either side to end the former Celtic manager’s tenure at this stage.

If Scotland are beaten by England on 11 November it is likely that Strachan 
will leave his post, almost certainly by mutual consent. The team would be six 
points behind the group leaders in that case with only one victory,against Malta

, from four qualifiers.

Strachan was always due to hold talks with the SFA on Thursday for a 
post-match debrief and the conversations followed a scheduled board meeting at 
which his position was discussed.

The governing body’s directors want to give him the opportunity to turn around 
the team’s fortunes at Wembley. They are also aware that it will be much easier 
to find a suitable replacement in the four and half months between theEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> game and the next competitive 
match, at home to Slovenia on 26 March, than it would be before the match in 
London.

Strachan, who signed a two-year contract extension last summer, tried to 
accentuate the positives after the defeat in Slovakia. “We are one point off a 
play-off place,” he said. “It is a crazy group.”
