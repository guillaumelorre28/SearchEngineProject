If they’re mistaken, and the polls are wrong, there’s going to be an almighty 
panic when everyone returns to their desks.

Oxford Economics say we can expect “moderate gains” if Clinton wins, and a 
“significant selloff” if she doesn’t.

In short, markets have already spoken. Equities will be the asset class that 
will gain the most in case of a Clinton win and equally lose the most if Donald 
Trump moves into the White House. Bond markets will likely rally a bit if Trump 
wins.

Certain emerging market asset classes would also move sharply. The Mexican 
peso would depreciate by between 10 and 22% in case of a Trump win and its 
sovereign spreads rise by between 80 and 120bps.

Asian traders will be in the firing line first - their markets will open as 
the early results come in. So we’ll launch a new liveblog tracking the markets 
in a few hours.

I’m off to  nervously watch the results  have a nap, and will be back early 
tomorrow. In the meantime, stay tuned to our main US elections liveblog. 
Goodnight!GW

Wall Street closes higher as election results loom

DING DING! The closing bell of Wall Street has been rung, as traders pushed 
shares higher for the second day running.

In a “risk-on mood”, the Dow Jones industrial average has ended the day 72 
points higher at 18,331, up 0.4%.

The S&P 500 shows similar gains, as traders continue to bet on a Clinton 
victory tonight.

And the Mexican peso is still trading at a two-month high, in a clear sign 
that traders expect Donald Trump to fail in his bid to reach the Oval Office.

With fifteen minutes until trading ends in New York, the Dow is holding onto 
its gains.

It’s currently up 104 points, or 0.5%, as investors continue to anticipate a 
Clinton victory. Could they be too complacent?
Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) 
I'm pretty surprised at the lack of Trump concern in the market right now. 
Doesn't look like there's any last minute second thought/hedging.

This has not been the most dramatic day in the stock markets, in truth. But 
it’s all going to change in a few hours, once the results come in.

Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co, says traders 
should buckle up.


He told Bloomberg that:

“Put your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride...

As the polls close later today, investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion 
to get ahead of the information flow.”

Over in Asia and Australia, traders are heading to their desks to watch the US 
election results unfold.

IG’s Chris Weston says the market still feel that Hillary Clinton has the 
edge. But memories of the Brexit referendum this summer haven’t faded.

He reminds us how events unfolded in June:

As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought ‘this wasn’t 
supposed to happen’, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in.

This election isn’t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way 
financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if 
Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada 
and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market 
could be wild.

Of course, we mustn’t forget that there is a real battle for the Senate too 
and its 50/50 that the Republicans can hold onto the Upper Chamber.

Less than one hour to go until trading closes on Wall Street, folks!

And the New York stock market is still on track to finish higher tonight, as 
investors continue to predict a victory for Hillary Clinton.

The rally has weakened a little, though, as investors show some caution about 
the election:
 Photograph: Bloomberg TV 
Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in 
Los Angeles, told Reuters that:

“We were dramatically oversold. People were nervous Trump would win. 

“There’s likely to be additional volatility in both directions between now and 
the end of the day.”

Standard Life: What the election will mean for the Fed

Dominic Rushe

Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments, has just 
published a note about the implications of a Trump or Clinton victory.

If Hillary takes the White House the Lawson says the status quo will be 
maintained. There’ll be gridlock in Washington but the economy will maintain 
its slow but steady recovery, and the Federal Reserve could hike borrowing 
costs next month.

He writes:

“ In this ‘status quo’ outcome the combination of a healthier economy and 
reduced policy uncertainty should allow the Fed to recommence normalising 
interest rates at its December meeting, though the pace of rate increases will 
remain gradual.”

But if Trump wins...


“Donald Trump’s election would introduce more uncertainty to the outlook for 
government policy, economic activity and the Fed, though those risks are not 
all to the downside. Initially, considerable market volatility is possible but 
it is actual policy decisions that will dictate the trajectory for the economy.”

Lawson is betting Trump’s tough trade talk is largely hot air and if he cuts 
regulation on the finance, energy, telecoms and healthcare sectors, that could 
boost earnings.

“If, on the other hand, a President Trump turns out to be serious about 
pursuing a much more protectionist policy agenda, the negative consequences for 
economic activity and corporate margins could easily offset the benefits of 
fiscal easing, preventing the Fed from tightening policy for some time.”

The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that the live voting data produced 
by VoteCastr is affecting stock prices.

The WSJ’s Paul Vigna explains <https://t.co/VlsSTFBhsh>:

Wall Street traders are moving markets Tuesday based on a small group of 
websites that purport to offer real-time estimates of the election results.

It’s a first for traders, and for the news media. It has been a longstanding 
policy for mainstream media to not report on exit-polling data while polls are 
still open on Election Day, so as to avoid discouraging voters in western 
states from voting.

Today, though, websites Vice and Slate plan on providing what they are 
characterizing as “live” voting projections throughout the day.

To be sure, this is an experiment, and a controversial one. Regardless, the 
numbers are being put out there, and the market is noticing. With the Slate 
data showing Hillary Clinton leading in several key swing states, stocks have 
shot higher and bonds have fallen.

Right now, VoteCastr are giving Clinton a four point lead in the crucial state 
of Florida, with 48% of support vs Trump’s 44% 
<http://www.slate.com/votecastr_election_day_turnout_tracker.html?live=true>. 
If the Democrats do claim Florida, it’s hard to see a Republican victory.

BUT (and it’s a big one), realtime polling forecasts are still somewhat 
experimental. If early voters aren’t representative of the electorate, then 
their projections could be skewed, for example.

Mexican peso hits two-month high

The Mexican peso has hit a two-month high today, which also suggests investors 
are predicting defeat for Donald Trump.


The peso has rallied to 18.4195 against the US dollar, from 18.58/$1 last 
night, a gain of 1% or so.

The peso has been very sensitive to Trump’s electoral prospects, given his 
attacks on Mexicans and opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Oxford Economics say we can expect “moderate gains” if Clinton wins, and a 
“significant selloff” if she doesn’t.

In short, markets have already spoken. Equities will be the asset class that 
will gain the most in case of a Clinton win and equally lose the most if Donald 
Trump moves into the White House. Bond markets will likely rally a bit if Trump 
wins.

Certain emerging market asset classes would also move sharply. The Mexican 
peso would depreciate by between 10 and 22% in case of a Trump win and its 
sovereign spreads rise by between 80 and 120bps.

Asian traders will be in the firing line first - their markets will open as 
the early results come in. So we’ll launch a new liveblog tracking the markets 
in a few hours.

I’m off to  nervously watch the results  have a nap, and will be back early 
tomorrow. In the meantime, stay tuned to our main US elections liveblog.

This has not been the most dramatic day in the stock markets, in truth. But 
it’s all going to change in a few hours, once the results come in.

Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co, says traders 
should buckle up.


He told Bloomberg that:

“Put your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride...

As the polls close later today, investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion 
to get ahead of the information flow.”

Over in Asia and Australia, traders are heading to their desks to watch the US 
election results unfold.

IG’s Chris Weston says the market still feel that Hillary Clinton has the 
edge. But memories of the Brexit referendum this summer haven’t faded.

He reminds us how events unfolded in June:

As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought ‘this wasn’t 
supposed to happen’, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in.

This election isn’t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way 
financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if 
Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada 
and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market 
could be wild.

Of course, we mustn’t forget that there is a real battle for the Senate too 
and its 50/50 that the Republicans can hold onto the Upper Chamber.
 
The Mexican peso is continuing to rally, and just hit a new two-month high:

Almost all of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are up 
today, but the gains are fairly muted.

Consumer good group Procter and Gamble, fast food chain McDonald’s and drinks 
group Coca-Cola are among the top risers:

Less than one hour to go until trading closes on Wall Street, folks!

And the New York stock market is still on track to finish higher tonight, as 
investors continue to predict a victory for Hillary Clinton.

The rally has weakened a little, though, as investors show some caution about 
the election:

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in 
Los Angeles, told Reuters that:

“We were dramatically oversold. People were nervous Trump would win. 

“There’s likely to be additional volatility in both directions between now and 
the end of the day.”
 
There were lots of nervous faces on Wall Street today, as traders kept one eye 
on the markets and the other one on the unfolding election.

Here are some new pictures from the NYSE trading floor:

While I was asleep it looks like MXN has got all excited. This continuous exit 
poll as the vote is ongoing troubles me...

VoteCastr said Hillary Clinton was leading in key states like Florida (even

Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments, has just 
published a note about the implications of a Trump or Clinton victory.

If Hillary takes the White House the Lawson says the status quo will be 
maintained. There’ll be gridlock in Washington but the economy will maintain 
its slow but steady recovery, and the Federal Reserve could hike borrowing 
costs next month.

He writes:

“ In this ‘status quo’ outcome the combination of a healthier economy and 
reduced policy uncertainty should allow the Fed to recommence normalising 
interest rates at its December meeting, though the pace of rate increases will 
remain gradual.”

But if Trump wins...


“Donald Trump’s election would introduce more uncertainty to the outlook for 
government policy, economic activity and the Fed, though those risks are not 
all to the downside. Initially, considerable market volatility is possible but 
it is actual policy decisions that will dictate the trajectory for the economy.”

Lawson is betting Trump’s tough trade talk is largely hot air and if he cuts 
regulation on the finance, energy, telecoms and healthcare sectors, that could 
boost earnings.

“If, on the other hand, a President Trump turns out to be serious about 
pursuing a much more protectionist policy agenda, the negative consequences for 
economic activity and corporate margins could easily offset the benefits of 
fiscal easing, preventing the Fed from tightening policy for some time.”
 
The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that the live voting data produced 
by VoteCastr is affecting stock prices.

The WSJ’s Paul Vigna explains <https://t.co/VlsSTFBhsh>:

Wall Street traders are moving markets Tuesday based on a small group of 
websites that purport to offer real-time estimates of the election results.

It’s a first for traders, and for the news media. It has been a longstanding 
policy for mainstream media to not report on exit-polling data while polls are 
still open on Election Day, so as to avoid discouraging voters in western 
states from voting.

Today, though, websites Vice and Slate plan on providing what they are 
characterizing as “live” voting projections throughout the day.

To be sure, this is an experiment, and a controversial one. Regardless, the 
numbers are being put out there, and the market is noticing. With the Slate 
data showing Hillary Clinton leading in several key swing states, stocks have 
shot higher and bonds have fallen.

Right now, VoteCastr are giving Clinton a four point lead in the crucial state 
of Florida, with 48% of support vs Trump’s 44% 
<http://www.slate.com/votecastr_election_day_turnout_tracker.html?live=true>. 
If the Democrats do claim Florida, it’s hard to see a Republican victory.

BUT (and it’s a big one), realtime polling forecasts are still somewhat 
experimental. If early voters aren’t representative of the electorate, then 
their projections could be skewed, for example.

The Mexican peso has hit a two-month high today, which also suggests investors 
are predicting defeat for Donald Trump.


The peso has rallied to 18.4195 against the US dollar, from 18.58/$1 last 
night, a gain of 1% or so.

The peso has been very sensitive to Trump’s electoral prospects, given his 
attacks on Mexicans and opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
