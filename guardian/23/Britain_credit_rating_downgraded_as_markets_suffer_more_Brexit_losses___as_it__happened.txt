Closing mini-summary

OK, time to wrap up for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points.

Britain has lost its final gold-plated AAA rating, following Standard & Poor’s 
decision to downgrade the country by two notches, to AA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-577166cde4b0f4303810a2da#block-577166cde4b0f4303810a2da>
.

S&P warned that the Brexit vote will lead to “less predictable, stable, and 
effective policy framework in the UK” and hurt growth.

Fitch, another major credit rating, has also downgraded Britain to AA tonight, 
from AA+ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-57718913e4b030d83eb4accc#block-57718913e4b030d83eb4accc>
.

The moves came after another day of losses on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 
index lost another 156 points 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-57715653e4b030d83eb4ab90#block-57715653e4b030d83eb4ab90>
, while medium-sized companies on the FTSE 250 fell by 6%.

Banking shares suffered most, amid fears of a UK recession, with Royal Bank of 
Scotland plunging by 25% at one point.

The pound hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, despite chancellor 
George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> trying to 
calm the market panic over the EU referendum vote.

We’ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage of the market reaction to the 
ongoing Brexit crisis. Goodnight!

Surely we’ve suffered enough...
Crispian Balmer (@crispiandjb) 
England has lost a prime minister, soccer manager, shadow cabinet and AAA 
rating in just 4 days. Surely something of a record.

Street:

US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK’s 
referendum decision to quit theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered 
their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday’s dips came as the pound 
collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UKlost its triple-A credit 
rating

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, 
the S&P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% 
down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to 
reverberate through the American market....

Why Fitch downgraded the UK

Fitch says it has downgraded Britain’s credit rating from AA+ to AA because 
the decision to leave the EU will have “a negative impact on the UK economy, 
public finances and political continuity.”

The rating agency warns that Britain faces an “abrupt slowdown in short-term 
GDP growth”, as businesses defer investment while tehy wonder how the Brexit 
vote will affect them.

The agency says:

Fitch has revised down its forecast for real GDP growth to 1.6% in 2016 (from 
1.9%), 0.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018 (both from 2.0% respectively), leaving the 
level of real GDP a cumulative 2.3% lower in 2018 than in its prior ‘Remain’ 
base case.

Fitch also fears that medium-term growth will also likely be weaker, as 
Britain will find it harder to export to the EU. Lower immigration, and a fall 
in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker 
pound.

Fitch adds that Britain’s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial:

Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK 
government’s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the 
timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated 
that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the 
final position may well not be known for several years.

And Fitch also fears that Britain’s budget deficit will be higher than 
previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues.

This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over 
the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio 
stabilising previously.

And then there’s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this 
is also bad for Britain’s credit worthiness:

The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including 
the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened 
uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy 
implementation at the current conjuncture.

And there’s more.....

Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for ‘Remain’ 
makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short 
to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that 
a second referendum on Scottish independence is “highly likely”. A vote for 
independence would be negative for the UK’s rating, as it would lead to a rise 
in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK’s external 
balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for 
example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland’s currency arrangement.

There’s more here (if you can face it):

Wall Street suffers biggest two-day fall in 10 months

Take a deep breath, folks. Another day of market turmoil is over.

Wall Street has closed, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 260 
points, or 1.5%.

Credit card firm American Express was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 
around 3.9%.


Reuters reports that Wall Street has suffered its biggest two-day fall in 10 
months, since the worries about China’s slowing economy.

The FT’s economics editor, Chris Giles, says S&P’s downgrade is a cause for 
serious concern:
Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) 
S&P no longer see UK institutions as a strength. Cuts credit rating TWO 
notches. Worse than financial crisis

The scale of S&P’s downgrade tonight is unprecedented, says Reuters’ Jamie 
McGeever, showing the full impact of Brexit.
Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) 
Britain's downgrade by S&P today was historic - the first time the ratings 
agency has ever cut a AAA sovereign rating by two notches.

Back in 2012, the LabourList website gathered together George Osborne’s 
various warnings about the need to keep the AAA rating.

For example, in 2009, he declared:

 “I have argued it with my opponents in difficult economic times, when I 
warned them last autumn that the cupboard was bare and the discretionary 
borrowing had to stop – and now Britain faces the humiliating possibility of 
losing its international credit rating.

Here’s the full list: Some things George Osborne has said about the AAA credit 
rating 
<http://labourlist.org/2012/12/some-things-george-osborne-has-said-about-the-aaa-credit-rating/>

All good clean fun. But in the chancellor’s defense, he did warn the public 
not to vote for Brexit....
Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) 
This must be about the first time in history a finance minister might actually 
think himself vindicated by a credit rating downgrade

S&P held back the downgrade until the London stock market had closed, so the 
City hasn’t had chance to react yet.

But over in New York, shares are falling deeper into the red on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 306 points, a fall of 1.75% 
today, on top of the 611 points shed during Friday’s tumble.

close  
OK, time to wrap up for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points.

Britain has lost its final gold-plated AAA rating, following Standard & Poor’s 
decision to downgrade the country by two notches, to AA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-577166cde4b0f4303810a2da#block-577166cde4b0f4303810a2da>
.

S&P warned that the Brexit vote will lead to “less predictable, stable, and 
effective policy framework in the UK” and hurt growth.

Fitch, another major credit rating, has also downgraded Britain to AA tonight, 
from AA+ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-57718913e4b030d83eb4accc#block-57718913e4b030d83eb4accc>
.

The moves came after another day of losses on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 
index lost another 156 points 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/27/pound-shares-markets-brexit-crisis-osborne-lew-business-live?page=with:block-57715653e4b030d83eb4ab90#block-57715653e4b030d83eb4ab90>
, while medium-sized companies on the FTSE 250 fell by 6%.

Banking shares suffered most, amid fears of a UK recession, with Royal Bank of 
Scotland plunging by 25% at one point. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/rbs-slumps-quarter-brexit-uk-bank-shares-severe-strain>

The pound hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, despite chancellor 
George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> trying to 
calm the market panic over the EU referendum vote.

From New York, my colleague Sam Thielman reports on another bad day on Wall 
Street:

US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK’s 
referendum decision to quit theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered 
their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday’s dips came as the pound 
collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UKlost its triple-A credit 
rating 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/property-and-financial-shares-slide-as-referendum-fallout-hits-stock-markets>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, 
the S&P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% 
down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to 
reverberate through the American market....

Fitch downgrades the UK. I note they list "lower immigration" as a reason to 
expect weaker economic growth#Brexit

Fitch says it has downgraded Britain’s credit rating from AA+ to AA because 
the decision to leave the EU will have “a negative impact on the UK economy, 
public finances and political continuity.”

The rating agency warns that Britain faces an “abrupt slowdown in short-term 
GDP growth”, as businesses defer investment while tehy wonder how the Brexit 
vote will affect them.

The agency says:

Fitch has revised down its forecast for real GDP growth to 1.6% in 2016 (from 
1.9%), 0.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018 (both from 2.0% respectively), leaving the 
level of real GDP a cumulative 2.3% lower in 2018 than in its prior ‘Remain’ 
base case.

Fitch also fears that medium-term growth will also likely be weaker, as 
Britain will find it harder to export to the EU. Lower immigration, and a fall 
in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker 
pound.

Fitch adds that Britain’s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial:

Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK 
government’s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the 
timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated 
that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the 
final position may well not be known for several years.

And Fitch also fears that Britain’s budget deficit will be higher than 
previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues.

This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over 
the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio 
stabilising previously.

And then there’s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this 
is also bad for Britain’s credit worthiness:

The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including 
the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened 
uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy 
implementation at the current conjuncture.

And there’s more.....

Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for ‘Remain’ 
makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short 
to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that 
a second referendum on Scottish independence is “highly likely”. A vote for 
independence would be negative for the UK’s rating, as it would lead to a rise 
in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK’s external 
balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for 
example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland’s currency arrangement.

Take a deep breath, folks. Another day of market turmoil is over.

Wall Street has closed, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 260 
points, or 1.5%.

Credit card firm American Express was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 
around 3.9%.


Reuters reports that Wall Street has suffered its biggest two-day fall in 10 
months, since the worries about China’s slowing economy.
 
Britain’s Brexit crisis is going to dominate tomorrow’s papers.

The Financial Times’ front page has just landed, focusing on the heavy losses 
on the stock markets and the pound’s drop to a 31-year low.

UK loses triple-A credit rating after Brexit vote

The scale of S&P’s downgrade tonight is unprecedented, says Reuters’ Jamie 
McGeever, showing the full impact of Brexit.
Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) 
Britain's downgrade by S&P today was historic - the first time the ratings 
agency has ever cut a AAA sovereign rating by two notches.
 <https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/747507295332990977> June 27, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/747507295332990977>  
Back in 2012, the LabourList website gathered together George Osborne’s 
various warnings about the need to keep the AAA rating.

For example, in 2009, he declared:

 “I have argued it with my opponents in difficult economic times, when I 
warned them last autumn that the cupboard was bare and the discretionary 
borrowing had to stop – and now Britain faces the humiliating possibility of 
losing its international credit rating.

Here’s the full list: Some things George Osborne has said about the AAA credit 
rating 
<http://labourlist.org/2012/12/some-things-george-osborne-has-said-about-the-aaa-credit-rating/>

All good clean fun. But in the chancellor’s defense, he did warn the public 
not to vote for Brexit....
Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) 
This must be about the first time in history a finance minister might actually 
think himself vindicated by a credit rating downgrade

<https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/747504480879521792>  
S&P held back the downgrade until the London stock market had closed, so the 
City hasn’t had chance to react yet.

But over in New York, shares are falling deeper into the red on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 306 points, a fall of 1.75% 
today, on top of the 611 points shed during Friday’s tumble.
