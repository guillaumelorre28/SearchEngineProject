Do you think there is any significant value in modern readers assessing a work 
likeJane Eyre by contemporary values? eg: today’s reader assessing Jane Eyre’s 
feminist values by today’s values?

Good question. Always a problem, I think, and not least in JE the regrettable 
'Mad woman in the attic' episode which does cast a few problems with Ed and 
Jane's romance, especially as Jane seems to forgive him this one small 
indiscretion once Bertha is well, burnt. It doesn't read too well right now, 
really, but as a narrative twist of ages past, I guess it must have been a 
zinger.

By rights, we should be shouting: WATCH OUT JANE!

I think the best thing to do is to read, consider, build, think and then do 
the best one can for oneself and one's immediate sphere. Feminism and Jane 
Eyre. I'm sure much has been written about this, and by better writers than I.

'Thursday is based on pioneering women aviators.'

ID1821678 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3782698> asks:

Thursday Next is a wonderful heroine. Is there any one or number of women that 
inspired you when writing her? And if so, who?

This was a hard one, as much of writing is intuitive and it may take years to 
figure out why you did some thing. I think Thursday is based on pioneering 
women aviators of the golden years of aviation - people like Bessie Colman, 
Beryl Markham, Amy Johnson. Women who didn't think for one moment that this was 
unusual or difficult - just went and did it because they had a burning desire 
to do so. Amy Johnson flew to Australia alone, in the twenties, with about 
ninety hours of flying experience in a 2nd hand aircraft and guided by what was 
essentially a school atlas. When she crash landed in India she repaired the 
aircraft with men's shirts sewn together and got a painter to make her some 
cellulose dope by smelling the wing and mixing up something similar.

 The equivalent today would be a young lady passing her driving test on the 
friday, buying a Nissan Micra on Saturday and announcing she was going to Pluto 
on the Monday.

Extraordinary women.

My question regarding The Eyre Affair is: why 1985?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16179578> Guardian contributor 
ffordejasper  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16179578> 03 May 2016

1985 was ten years before the year I first started writing it: 1995. The 
reason I did that was there was more of a 'now it can be told' aspect to The 
Eyre Affair, sort of like Thursday relating her story as a very old woman:

 'I remember a time before the cheese wars, when the Gravitube was still 
running, and whenJane Eyre had a different ending..' 

I think I'd just seen The Name of the Rose and liked the way it started. As it 
turned out that aspect has gone, but a sense of this happened a few years back 
still hung on. That's why. It also meant, fortuitously, that I could plausibly 
include President for life George Formby.

And when I use the word 'plausibly' I am talking in relative terms, naturally.

Wine and Dine with Brie and Born Free?

I never buy cheese from the Stiltonistas. Do that and you are giving money to 
very bad people indeed. Teenagers: Take it from someone who hit the cheese big 
time when I was in my early twenties: Friends don't let friends eat Limburger.

Eat cheese sensibly

Bad joke: The lambs near us refuse to gambol sensibly. It'll lead to a 
downward spiral that ends in mint sauce, I'll be bound.

'Perseverance pays off, but only if you have a certain degree of 
pigheadedness, too.'

hemingway62 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15528628> asks about the 
rejections Jasper received for his first book, The Eyre Affair:

How did you survive getting 70 rejection slips? Is it just a case of having a 
thick skin or did you learn to adapt to rejection? If so, how?

They were rejection slips, but not really rejection, and that's how to view 
them. I was very conscious that I was learning my craft and these were notes 
telling me that my books were not (yet) of merchantable quality. Perseverance 
pays off, but only if you have a certain degree of pigheadedness, too. I always 
had a suspicion that The Three Bears were a suitable topic for a police 
procedural, and I built on that. It just took a while.

What made you make the protagonist of the Thursday Next books a woman? I’m 
happy about it, but curious.

Thursday was a woman quite simply because I'd written two books with a male 
protagonist (The two Nursery Crime books, which although published last, were 
written first) and I thought, I like Jack Spratt but his female co-stars were 
much more interesting to write. She was third person for a while, but then I 
though I wasn't getting inside her head enough, so switched the book to first 
person.

I've written Thursdayish characters ever since, even if they aren't truly the 
protagonist.

'Dark Reading Matter will be the next Thursday Next adventure.'

wants to know:

When will the next Thursday Next adventure come out?

'Dark Reading Matter' will be the next, and we're building up to it. I love 
the idea of dark reading matter. That the 'observable bookworld' is calculated 
to consist of only 10% of all the stories there have ever been. This illusive 
and undetectable range of stories, the 'Dark Reading Matter' is made up of 
plots that writers had in their heads when they died, deleted manuscripts and 
people's memories. Quite simply: 'All those moments .. lost, like tears in the 
rain.'

And Thursday has to get in there - or Goliath will. 

ooooh, I want to write it now.

Jericho999 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2378861> has a question 
about mapping plots:

When I read The Eyre Affair I really enjoyed all the twists and turns - but 
the idea of having to plan it all seemed overwhelming. Do you use any kinds of 
visual aids/plans? or just have it all in your head?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16179578> Guardian contributor

1:40pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/73500808> 
All in my head. (See thread above somewhere) I once did a plan and spent two 
weeks doing it, then started writing - within a week I had gone off on a 
tangent. The trouble is that there are these things called 'better ideas' and 
they lurk at the door, taunting me until I tell them to come in and use them. 
And those better ideas only chance along when I am writing. The worst and best 
thing that can happen for me is a better idea at the 11th hour. Bad because I 
have to rework everything, and best because they are, well, better ideas. The 
'changing the ending of Jane Eyre' idea is a case in point - arrived when the 
book was finished. Had to go in. Pulled the book apart and then plastered over 
the cracks. The book is better for it.

I've no idea why it didn't sell - it's my favourite, too - along with Fourth 
Bear. What's not to love about talking bears and the 'Right to arm bears' 
controversy. Perhaps it's becasue as odd as my books were up until that point, 
SofG was an oddstep too far. Absurd heavy, rather than absurd light. It's an 
odd mix, too - whereas the Thursday Next series was 'high lit V low comedy' 
then SofG was 'slapstick V social issues' and that's a tricky one to do and 
read. Perhaps it's time is not yet here. 'Perhaps," as my editor says, 'we need 
to do the next in the series.'

I think so too, although given the absurdity of the series, Eddie Russet may

'Plotting, hah! I make it up as I go along.'

My question is a mundane grey one, possibly one that authors dread and 
probably already has been asked by someone else but can you tell us how on 
earth you plot your books and keep your bearings/marbles?! I am also a fan of 
toast. Many thanks for hours of happy reading.

Plotting, hah! 

I make it up as I go along. If you're reading my books and have no idea of 
where it might end up, then you're in good company - neither do I.

I tend to just start with one or two 'narrative dares' (Jane Eyre is kidnapped 
from Jane Eyre/Humpty Dumpty is murdered/why was the porridge at different 
temperatures when poured at the same time/invent a social order run entirely on 
visual colour) and then just riffing over what comes into my head. While writing
The Eyre Affair I was reading a book on the Charge of the Light Brigade. 
'Egad,' me thinks, 'I've got to get myself some ofthat!' But then I think: 'How 
is that possible? My book is set in 1985!' Then I think: 'Wait a moment, I'm 
the author - I can do what I want. What if the 1854 Crimean war is still on?' 
There is sometimes a little bit of narrative contortions, but that's 
essentially how I write.

'Even readers who don't know Swindon understand what Swindon is all about.'

Edgeley <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1316074> asks:

What would you do to the real Swindon to make it less Swindonish?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16179578> Guardian contributor 
ffordejasper  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16179578> 03 May 2016

Ah, Swindon. Even readers who don't know Swindon understand what Swindon is 
all about, and when you ask an overseas reader to name their own country's 
Swindon, they instantly know somewhere. What's unfair is that Swindon is 
actually a very decent place. I lived near there for almost ten years and both 
my sons were born there.

The choice to use Swindon was an obvious one. When writing I use 'Choose the 
less well trodden path' as a central tenent.

Where do I set a book? 
Well trodden path: London, Edinburgh, Bristol. 
Less well trodden path: Swindon, Reading, Hereford.

How do I treat that location:
Well trodden path: As a cheap shot for a joke. 
Less well trodden path: A place that is a vibrant, exciting, and there's 
little that can't happen. Glassy towers, 50,000 seat croquet stadium, Travelhub 
- 'The Jewel on the M4'

The less well trodden path works with characters, too - the obvious thing to 
do with Thursday's romantic life is to have a procession of unsuitable 
boyfriends move through her life. The less well trodden path is for her to be a 
one-guy-gal, and her husband a one-girl-guy. There's plenty of drama to be 
found when one wears my patented Absurd-O-Vision glasses..

Is there any chance that The Last Great Tortoise Race may eventually be

Yes indeed. See elsewhere in the threads. I went off the boil as a lot of 
movies came out which retold nursery rhymes in amusing ways, but then I 
thought: 'Well heck, I did write this in 1992, so if not perhaps the first, one 
of them.' So I will. The Easter Bunny was introduced in The Fourth Bear and it 
seems like she and Jack have some history together that goes back a few years. 
She's a femme fatale gang boss who cleverly disguises her intentions by being 
very very cute on one day of the year. She's modelled on Jessica Rabbit and 
that rabbit with the west country accent who used to advertise Cadbury's 
Caramel bars. It'll be fun.

That's me, I'm out of here - many thanks for the questions. My next book is 
Early Riserand will be out in 2017. The narrative dare of this is: Write a 
thriller in a world in which humans have always hibernated.' Discuss.

Until then, why not follow me on Instagram or Twitter?

Good question. Always a problem, I think, and not least in JE the regrettable 
'Mad woman in the attic' episode which does cast a few problems with Ed and 
Jane's romance, especially as Jane seems to forgive him this one small 
indiscretion once Bertha is well, burnt. It doesn't read too well right now, 
really, but as a narrative twist of ages past, I guess it must have been a 
zinger.

By rights, we should be shouting: WATCH OUT JANE!

I think the best thing to do is to read, consider, build, think and then do 
the best one can for oneself and one's immediate sphere. Feminism and Jane 
Eyre. I'm sure much has been written about this, and by better writers than I.

This was a hard one, as much of writing is intuitive and it may take years to 
figure out why you did some thing. I think Thursday is based on pioneering 
women aviators of the golden years of aviation - people like Bessie Colman, 
Beryl Markham, Amy Johnson. Women who didn't think for one moment that this was 
unusual or difficult - just went and did it because they had a burning desire 
to do so. Amy Johnson flew to Australia alone, in the twenties, with about 
ninety hours of flying experience in a 2nd hand aircraft and guided by what was 
essentially a school atlas. When she crash landed in India she repaired the 
aircraft with men's shirts sewn together and got a painter to make her some 
cellulose dope by smelling the wing and mixing up something similar.

 The equivalent today would be a young lady passing her driving test on the 
friday, buying a Nissan Micra on Saturday and announcing she was going to Pluto 
on the Monday.

Extraordinary women.

My question regarding The Eyre Affair is: why 1985?

1985 was ten years before the year I first started writing it: 1995. The 
reason I did that was there was more of a 'now it can be told' aspect to The 
Eyre Affair, sort of like Thursday relating her story as a very old woman:

 'I remember a time before the cheese wars, when the Gravitube was still 
running, and whenJane Eyre had a different ending..' 

I think I'd just seen The Name of the Rose and liked the way it started. As it 
turned out that aspect has gone, but a sense of this happened a few years back 
still hung on. That's why. It also meant, fortuitously, that I could plausibly 
include President for life George Formby.

And when I use the word 'plausibly' I am talking in relative terms, naturally.

Wine and Dine with Brie and Born Free?

I never buy cheese from the Stiltonistas. Do that and you are giving money to 
very bad people indeed. Teenagers: Take it from someone who hit the cheese big 
time when I was in my early twenties: Friends don't let friends eat Limburger.

Eat cheese sensibly

Bad joke: The lambs near us refuse to gambol sensibly. It'll lead to a 
downward spiral that ends in mint sauce, I'll be bound.

They were rejection slips, but not really rejection, and that's how to view 
them. I was very conscious that I was learning my craft and these were notes 
telling me that my books were not (yet) of merchantable quality. Perseverance 
pays off, but only if you have a certain degree of pigheadedness, too. I always 
had a suspicion that The Three Bears were a suitable topic for a police 
procedural, and I built on that. It just took a while.

Thursday was a woman quite simply because I'd written two books with a male 
protagonist (The two Nursery Crime books, which although published last, were 
written first) and I thought, I like Jack Spratt but his female co-stars were 
much more interesting to write. She was third person for a while, but then I 
though I wasn't getting inside her head enough, so switched the book to first 
person.

I've written Thursdayish characters ever since, even if they aren't truly the 
protagonist.

'Dark Reading Matter' will be the next, and we're building up to it. I love 
the idea of dark reading matter. That the 'observable bookworld' is calculated 
to consist of only 10% of all the stories there have ever been. This illusive 
and undetectable range of stories, the 'Dark Reading Matter' is made up of 
plots that writers had in their heads when they died, deleted manuscripts and 
people's memories. Quite simply: 'All those moments .. lost, like tears in the 
rain.'

And Thursday has to get in there - or Goliath will. 

ooooh, I want to write it now.
 
Jericho999 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2378861> has a question 
about mapping plots:

When I read The Eyre Affair I really enjoyed all the twists and turns - but 
the idea of having to plan it all seemed overwhelming. Do you use any kinds of 
visual aids/plans? or just have it all in your head?

All in my head. (See thread above somewhere) I once did a plan and spent two 
weeks doing it, then started writing - within a week I had gone off on a 
tangent. The trouble is that there are these things called 'better ideas' and 
they lurk at the door, taunting me until I tell them to come in and use them. 
And those better ideas only chance along when I am writing. The worst and best 
thing that can happen for me is a better idea at the 11th hour. Bad because I 
have to rework everything, and best because they are, well, better ideas. The 
'changing the ending of Jane Eyre' idea is a case in point - arrived when the 
book was finished. Had to go in. Pulled the book apart and then plastered over 
the cracks. The book is better for it.

I've no idea why it didn't sell - it's my favourite, too - along with Fourth 
Bear. What's not to love about talking bears and the 'Right to arm bears' 
controversy. Perhaps it's becasue as odd as my books were up until that point, 
SofG was an oddstep too far. Absurd heavy, rather than absurd light. It's an 
odd mix, too - whereas the Thursday Next series was 'high lit V low comedy' 
then SofG was 'slapstick V social issues' and that's a tricky one to do and 
read. Perhaps it's time is not yet here. 'Perhaps," as my editor says, 'we need 
to do the next in the series.'

I think so too, although given the absurdity of the series, Eddie Russet may 
find himself bogged down in the rhododendron issue.

Plotting, hah! 

I make it up as I go along. If you're reading my books and have no idea of 
where it might end up, then you're in good company - neither do I.

I tend to just start with one or two 'narrative dares' (Jane Eyre is kidnapped 
from Jane Eyre/Humpty Dumpty is murdered/why was the porridge at different 
temperatures when poured at the same time/invent a social order run entirely on 
visual colour) and then just riffing over what comes into my head. While writing
The Eyre Affair I was reading a book on the Charge of the Light Brigade. 
'Egad,' me thinks, 'I've got to get myself some ofthat!' But then I think: 'How 
is that possible? My book is set in 1985!' Then I think: 'Wait a moment, I'm 
the author - I can do what I want. What if the 1854 Crimean war is still on?' 
There is sometimes a little bit of narrative contortions, but that's 
essentially how I write.
 
Edgeley <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1316074> asks:

Ah, Swindon. Even readers who don't know Swindon understand what Swindon is 
all about, and when you ask an overseas reader to name their own country's 
Swindon, they instantly know somewhere. What's unfair is that Swindon is 
actually a very decent place. I lived near there for almost ten years and both 
my sons were born there.

The choice to use Swindon was an obvious one. When writing I use 'Choose the 
less well trodden path' as a central tenent.

Where do I set a book? 
Well trodden path: London, Edinburgh, Bristol. 
Less well trodden path: Swindon, Reading, Hereford.

How do I treat that location:
Well trodden path: As a cheap shot for a joke. 
Less well trodden path: A place that is a vibrant, exciting, and there's 
little that can't happen. Glassy towers, 50,000 seat croquet stadium, Travelhub 
- 'The Jewel on the M4'

The less well trodden path works with characters, too - the obvious thing to 
do with Thursday's romantic life is to have a procession of unsuitable 
boyfriends move through her life. The less well trodden path is for her to be a 
one-guy-gal, and her husband a one-girl-guy. There's plenty of drama to be 
found when one wears my patented Absurd-O-Vision glasses..

Yes indeed. See elsewhere in the threads. I went off the boil as a lot of 
movies came out which retold nursery rhymes in amusing ways, but then I 
thought: 'Well heck, I did write this in 1992, so if not perhaps the first, one 
of them.' So I will. The Easter Bunny was introduced in The Fourth Bear and it 
seems like she and Jack have some history together that goes back a few years. 
She's a femme fatale gang boss who cleverly disguises her intentions by being 
very very cute on one day of the year. She's modelled on Jessica Rabbit and 
that rabbit with the west country accent who used to advertise Cadbury's 
Caramel bars. It'll be fun.
