Lead thieves, time and too much wuthering have been unkind to the parish 
church of St Michael and All Angels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/dec/31/bronte-landscape-housing-tourist-trade>
 in Haworth. Water is coming through the roof, Victorian wall paintings have 
been damaged and there is damp in the side chapel dedicated to the three Brontë 
sisters in the church where their father was parson. The raw Pennine air that 
scarred and shaped, and – like the stunted firs at Top Withens – probably 
shortened the lives of Charlotte, Emily and Anne, is now threatening the church 
itself. Saving churches – in particular 19th century rebuilds – is a 
contentious business. But withouttheir father's work at Haworth 
<http://www.haworth-village.org.uk/>, it would not have been the village and 
the moors above that enclosed their short lives and provided the passionate 
setting for their writing. The Brontës' world was always heavy with decay.
Haworth church <http://www.haworthchurch.co.uk/> needs to raise £30,000 more by 
Friday. All of us would be the poorer if this unique building was allowed to 
collapse.
