Night time political summary

That’s Monday, done and dusted.

What did we learn? 

 * That the health minister Sussan Ley would like to lift the Medicare rebate 
freeze but Mathias Cormann and Scott Morrison do not agree. Malcolm Turnbull 
thinks it will lift at some point. Just not sure when. Messy.

 * Labor promised to nick $1bn from Perth’s Freightlink project - “a white 
elephant” - and give it to Perth’s Metronet public transport project. Malcolm 
Turnbull gave money for Eden’s port expansion and Merimbula’s airport. Hello 
Eden Monaro.

 * Labor promised to look at the tax ruling that allows politicians to claim a 
tax break on a Canberra residence above the $273 a night travel allowance. 
Malcolm Turnbull said it is a job for the independent umpire. Scott Morrison 
said he would look at Labor’s proposal. We don’t think he was the independent 
umpire the PM was referring to.

 * Ray Hadley said the Coalition’s superannuation changes which seek to cap 
tax free contributions could bring the government undone. That is, the rocks on 
which the Coalition would perish. He shook his metaphorical fist. Morrison 
remained unmoved.

 * Liberal fundraising whiz Michael “Yabbers” Yabsley said he knew “in some 
cases” that property developers banned from donating a state level were 
directed to federal fundraising efforts. His comments will be expanded in full 
technicolor during Four Corners tonight on the ABC at 8.30pm.

Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens. 
Mike Bowers, wherever you are, wonderful pictures.

Thanks for staying with us dear readers. See you on the morrow.

Paul Karp

Australian Medical Association president, Brian Owler, has responded to Sussan 
Ley’s suggestion that “I want that freeze lifted as soon as possible but I 
appreciate Finance and Treasury aren’t allowing me to do it just yet.”

Owler told Guardian Australia: 

The government hasn’t left the door open on reversing the Medicare indexation 
freeze and Ley’s statement shows it’s not health policy that’s running the 
decisions it’s finance and treasury. It’s the dollars deciding health policy, 
that’s been the way the whole way along. It’s clear they have no intention of 
lifting the freeze, you don’t extend it for two years in the budget if you’re 
working to lift it.

This is the tax ruling paragraph on the politicians entitlements and what 
members can claim, after taking into account their travel allowance.

328. A Member may choose to rent or buy a property rather than stay in a hotel 
or other commercial establishment when travelling. A deduction is allowable for 
expenses, that are not of a capital, private or domestic nature, in respect of 
such a property where:

(i) it is used by a Member for accommodation when he or she is undertaking 
work-related travel involving an overnight stay away from home; and

(ii) the property is not regarded as a second residence.

Such expenses include: lease payments; rent; interest on borrowings used for 
the acquisition of the property; rates; taxes; insurance; general maintenance 
of the building, plant and grounds. A deduction is also allowable for 
depreciation of plant used in connection with such a property.

Also worth noting, the sale of the property is - in most cases - capital gains 
tax free.

The Nats have the wombat trail, which follows the leader Barnaby Joyce. The 
Greens have the bandicoot trail. I confess I did not know this was a thing.

Greens leader Senator Richard Di Natale will visit Tamworth on Tuesday with 
the party’s (state) mining spokesman,Jeremy Buckingham. Naturally they are off 
to Breeza, site of the controversial Shenhua Watermark mine.

Then Di Natale will join Joyce and Labor’s rural affairs spokesman Joel 
Fitzgibbon in a debate at Goulburn High School at 7.30pm on Wednesday.

Bill Shorten is up now, announcing $1bn towards the building of Perth 
Metronet, funded by cuts to federal commitments toPerth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news> Freightlink.

Shorten is with Mark McGowan, WA Labor opposition leader.

This commitment of $1bn is far better spent on Metronet than the Perth 
FreightLink which is a waste of money and won’t solve the freight issues 
confronting our city. Infrastructure Australia found a couple of years ago by 
2030, seven of the ten most congested roads inAustralia will be Perth. That is 
why we need to give people the opportunity to get out of their cars and use 
public transport.

That’s Monday, done and dusted.

What did we learn? 

 * That the health minister Sussan Ley would like to lift the Medicare rebate 
freeze but Mathias Cormann and Scott Morrison do not agree. Malcolm Turnbull 
thinks it will lift at some point. Just not sure when. Messy.

 * Labor promised to nick $1bn from Perth’s Freightlink project - “a white 
elephant” - and give it to Perth’s Metronet public transport project. Malcolm 
Turnbull gave money for Eden’s port expansion and Merimbula’s airport. Hello 
Eden Monaro.

 * Labor promised to look at the tax ruling that allows politicians to claim a 
tax break on a Canberra residence above the $273 a night travel allowance. 
Malcolm Turnbull said it is a job for the independent umpire. Scott Morrison 
said he would look at Labor’s proposal. We don’t think he was the independent 
umpire the PM was referring to.

 * Ray Hadley said the Coalition’s superannuation changes which seek to cap 
tax free contributions could bring the government undone. That is, the rocks on 
which the Coalition would perish. He shook his metaphorical fist. Morrison 
remained unmoved.

 * Liberal fundraising whiz Michael “Yabbers” Yabsley said he knew “in some 
cases” that property developers banned from donating a state level were 
directed to federal fundraising efforts. His comments will be expanded in full 
technicolor during Four Corners tonight on the ABC at 8.30pm.

Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens. 
Mike Bowers, wherever you are, wonderful pictures.

Thanks for staying with us dear readers. See you on the morrow. 
 
Australian Medical Association president, Brian Owler, has responded to Sussan 
Ley’s suggestion that “I want that freeze lifted as soon as possible but I 
appreciate Finance and Treasury aren’t allowing me to do it just yet.”

Owler told Guardian Australia: 

The government hasn’t left the door open on reversing the Medicare indexation 
freeze and Ley’s statement shows it’s not health policy that’s running the 
decisions it’s finance and treasury. It’s the dollars deciding health policy, 
that’s been the way the whole way along. It’s clear they have no intention of 
lifting the freeze, you don’t extend it for two years in the budget if you’re 
working to lift it.
 
This is the tax ruling paragraph on the politicians entitlements and what 
members can claim, after taking into account their travel allowance.

328. A Member may choose to rent or buy a property rather than stay in a hotel 
or other commercial establishment when travelling. A deduction is allowable for 
expenses, that are not of a capital, private or domestic nature, in respect of 
such a property where:

(i) it is used by a Member for accommodation when he or she is undertaking 
work-related travel involving an overnight stay away from home; and

(ii) the property is not regarded as a second residence.

Such expenses include: lease payments; rent; interest on borrowings used for 
the acquisition of the property; rates; taxes; insurance; general maintenance 
of the building, plant and grounds. A deduction is also allowable for 
depreciation of plant used in connection with such a property.

Also worth noting, the sale of the property is - in most cases - capital gains 
tax free.
 
I wanna be your dog.

Lagotto Brando has to be the best name ever for a dog.
 
The Nats have the wombat trail, which follows the leader Barnaby Joyce. The 
Greens have the bandicoot trail. I confess I did not know this was a thing.

Greens leader Senator Richard Di Natale will visit Tamworth on Tuesday with 
the party’s (state) mining spokesman,Jeremy Buckingham. Naturally they are off 
to Breeza, site of the controversial Shenhua Watermark mine.

Then Di Natale will join Joyce and Labor’s rural affairs spokesman Joel 
Fitzgibbon in a debate at Goulburn High School at 7.30pm on Wednesday.

 
Journalist Derryn Hinch and his Justice party are running for the Senate in 
Victoria. Surely his prospects are not this gloomy.

This was the issue that Clive Palmer campaigned on so effectively at the last

much traction.

Shorten deadbats the question, talking about every other revenue measure 
rather than the GST proportion.

But McGowan has a go.

Currently we get 31 cents in the dollar, that’s not good enough. The only 
leader currently at Coag who was there when the original deal was signed is 
Colin Barnett. So we will continue to argue for a floor under which no state’s 
share can go and I think a consistent position from WA would be one refreshing, 
but secondly, a great change on the existing arrangement that Mr Barnett has

Metronet, funded by cuts to federal commitments toPerth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news> Freightlink.

Shorten is with Mark McGowan, WA Labor opposition leader.

This commitment of $1bn is far better spent on Metronet than the Perth 
FreightLink which is a waste of money and won’t solve the freight issues 
confronting our city. Infrastructure Australia found a couple of years ago by 
2030, seven of the ten most congested roads inAustralia will be Perth. That is 
why we need to give people the opportunity to get out of their cars and use 
public transport.
