Argentinians are now into wine more than ever before, thanks to new 
top-quality vintages that go beyond the purple, juicy malbec. Good spots to 
sample wines in Buenos Aires used to be relatively few, but that is now 
changing. Throw into the mix the fact that the government recently named 
fermented grape juice as Argentina’s national drink and you have the perfect 
sampling storm.

Here are 10 of the best new wine bars and tasting rooms around the capital, 
showcasing the wares of Argentina’s 884 bodegas.

Santiago Lambardi and sommelier Sebastián Maggi, the team behind this popular 
spot, which opened in 2014 in the downtown Retiro barrio, sought inspiration 
from London and New York’s finest merchants and bars. They also imported 
Newine, Buenos Aires’ first wine-by-the-glass dispenser. This card-operated 
system, installed this month, keeps wine fresh with a tiny shot of nitrogen, 
Shout can serve 35 wines from Argentina’s diverse grape-producing areas at 
various sample sizes. Punters top up their card for 100 pesos (£5.22), and a 
simple push of a button releases sample sizes of drinks such as torrontés from 
the north-western Calchaquíes Valley or malbec from Río Negro province in 
northern Patagonia. The building is a 1920s warren of a mansion that previously 
housed an art gallery and nightclub. For a wide-ranging experience, order a 
“flight” of four wines (Malbec Power, say, or Nosotros Pinoteamos) in sample 
sizes guided by one of Shout’s team.

You choose the cheese or charcuterie; Bar du Marché picks three wines. And it 
makes for a dream teaming at this petite French-style bistro that could have 
been airlifted in from Paris’s 11th arrondissement. The 100-strong wine list 
focuses on New World offerings plus a smattering of burgundies and chiantis; 
half of those are available to try by the glass. Those with an amplified thirst 
should opt for larger vessels such as small- or medium-size decanters – 
respectively a glass and a half and a half-bottle – or indeed the full 750ml. 
If you can handle Buenos Aires’ humid summer, drink outside at a marble-topped 
table on the pavement and watch the world saunter past. The first floor of this 
cute bistro, which opened in late 2012, is also home to Omakase, a chicpuerta 
cerrada (closed-door) private sushi restaurant – that is reservation-only.
• By the glass from £1.60, platter of three wines and three cheeses £9.50.

Although this wine bar and sourdough bakery opened only two years ago, it has 
become an integral part of the local wine scene. It’s led by energetic 
husband-and-wife team Ohad and Eleonora – he kneads thepain while she opens the 
vin. Pain et Vin regularly hosts tastings by top oenologists; Zorzal Wines’ 
Juan Pablo Michelini recently launched his latest line at the communal table. 
Focusing on boutique wineries with limited production, this is a great spot for 
purchasing a revelatory bottle, although the moreish sourdough sandwiches 
should be devoured on the spot.

“We’re a bit tired of traditional tastings so we like to mix things up,” says 
Victoria Beleniski, sommelier and co-owner of Almacén Otamendi. And true to her 
word, she does. She and husband Gustavo Berman, a craft brewer, converted a 
butcher’s shop into avinoteca eight months ago in Caballito, a sprawling 
neighbourhood west of Palermo. Stocking 300 labels from boutique wineries, the 
couple turn their cellar over to wine and beer tastings every Thursday, teaming
degustaciónes with exhibitions by local artists or even low-key tango shows. 
Also a member of distributor Fulanos Wines’ team, Victoria knows her stuff, 
always keeping a bottle or two open for customers to sample. There are tastings 
and introductory courses, and keep an eye out for weekly deals, such as two 
cabernet sauvignons from Cafayate’s Domingo Molina anda free torrontésfor an 
extremely economical £8.50.
• Wine tasting £8, open-tap beer tasting (drink as much as you want) £10.50.

From its opening in 1998 until 2005, Gran Bar Danzón was the only 
establishment catering to oenophiles in Buenos Aires. A true heavyweight on the
porteño drinking scene for the past 18 years – not only for its 300-strong wine 
list but also innovative cocktail creations – Danzón offers sultry ambience and 
romantic lighting. Pick a spot at the 18-metre bar then tuck into the daily, 
deluxe happy hour (7pm-9pm, from 8pm Sat and Sun) whose premium vintages rotate 
fortnightly; three flights are also available. One wine-sampling journey 
focuses on Uco Valley’s discerning wine-producing district, Gualtallary, while 
the South to North tasting tour takes in the Alto, Uco and Calchaquíes Valleys 
in Río Negro, Mendoza and Salta respectively. Introductions in the menu 
praising star grapes torrontés and malbec are penned by renowned winemakers 
Alejandro Sejanovich from Manos Negras and Marcelo Pelleriti from Monteviejo, 
both wineries located in Uco Valley, Mendoza, which enhance Danzón’s stellar 
reputation.

from Familia Zuccardi, one of Mendoza’s largest family-run bodegas, whose vast

sophisticated offering with a well-priced restaurant specialising in classy

“Joaquín Alberdi’s Place” is one of Buenos Aires’ most cherished tasting rooms 
and wine stores, not least because of Joaquín’s jolly attitude and wealth of 
knowledge. An early-20th century mansion with stained glass front door and 
colourful tile floor is the setting for Lo de JA! – as it’s known – which 
stocks around 500 labels. Pull up a stool at the U-shaped bar and let the owner 
himself – who also does fantasticasados (barbecues) upstairs – pour the wares. 
With a decade in the wine-selling business and a previous life as a chef, 
Joaquín’ brings each bottle to life. Drop by for a quick taste of whatever’s 
open or book a more official tasting that focuses on a particular varietal, 
region or winery.

La Cava Jufré, Villa Crespo

Browsing the wine bottle tree at La Cava Jufré, Villa Crespo’s original wine 
bar, always yields a few surprises: its branches, or rather wine bottles, 
change frequently according to owner Lito Galeano’s whims. But if indecision is 
calling the shots, put your evening in Lito’s hands and he’ll happily choose 
drinks from the cellar. A rustic corner mansion with exposed brickwork and 
19th-century ceramic floor tiles, the relaxed, candle-lit bar is conducive to 
wine banter; suddenly it’s the early hours and you’ve polished off several 
Durigutti 2012 Bonardas with the neighbours. With a main salon, a cosy 
mezzanine and street corner tables for sipping, it attracts an array of wine 
fans, from on-trend sommeliers to pensioners with malbec coursing through their 
veins. Lito also hosts tastings and mini wine fairs featuring a dozen bodegas. 
The inspired lamb empanadas are some of the best in town.

one of 12 three-glass flights with back stories such as “Discovering Bubbles” 
and “A New Gem – Cabernet Franc”, or bookingfor Tuesday’s sommelier-led group 
tasting. The glass-fronted cellar that is also used as a private dining room is 
open until 1am for last-minute purchases at takeaway prices.
