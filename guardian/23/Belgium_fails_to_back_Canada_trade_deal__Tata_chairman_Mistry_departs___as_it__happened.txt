Oil prices slide

Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt 
from any agreement by Opec to cut production.

Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an 
output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month 
to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much 
individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in 
November.

But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to 
whether any agreement could be reached after all.

Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West 
Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. 
Jennifer Rankin writes:

The European Union’s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this 
week appear to have gone up in smoke, afterBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belgium> announced it could not sign the 
treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments.

The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British 
government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit.

The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium 
was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks 
between the country’s federal and regional leaders.

The Belgian stalemate means Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is 
expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign 
the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next 
steps remained unclear.

Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau 
later on Monday.

Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, 
but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained 
stuck.

Paul Magnette, Wallonia’s minister-president, who has led opposition to the 
deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis 
talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel.

The full report is here:

Markets rise in Europe and US, but FTSE falters

A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&T’s £70bn offer for Time Warner, and 
better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most 
markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory 
orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 
7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The FTSE’s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the 
red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their 
gains, but the fall for London’s chief index is the standout feature of the 
day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps 
the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has 
shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit 
uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that 
appears, on the basis of today’s PMI numbers, to be looking much more 
attractive.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 
0.42%.

Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against 
the euro at €1.1206.

UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments 
in the EU-Canada trade deal.

Speaking in parliament she said: “I share everyone’s disappointment in the 
stalled talks between the EU and Canada.”

But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK’s own 
negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to 
replicate an existing model but build its own.

US and European markets climb but FTSE fades

Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable 
exception.

Helped by M&A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany’s 
Dax is 0.8% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 0.65%.

But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back 
below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, 
financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day’s better than expected 
PMI readings.

The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this 
Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 
forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the 
former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after 
the bell to approach 18250.

Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the 
German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, 
meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors 
continued to react to this morning’s troublesome CBI industrial order 
expectations slide.

More from Reuters on Belgium’s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal:

“We cannot give a yes,” Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, 
told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with 
Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU 
authorities.

Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged 
behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel’s liberal-led 
federal coalition:

“We have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and 
it’s a No from the others,” said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the 
meeting at Michel’s residence lasting less than an hour.

“It’s a real shame,” the center-right leader said. “We’re the laughing stock 
of the whole world. It’s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for 
Europe, for the whole world.”

Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he 
were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not 
in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are 
ready to support...

Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent 
and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada’s 
by C$12 billion (US $9 billion).

Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from 
Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and 
foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public 
policy.

Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved 
powers to play domestic politics.

Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette’s 
stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his 
reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium.

2.55pm BST 14:55  <> 

Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US 
PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. 
He said:

Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier 
in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and 
new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly 
widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential 
election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued 
spending and investment in recent months.

There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate 
inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore 
provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter.

Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring 
remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on 
domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain 
economic and political outlook.

US manufacturing better than expected

More signs of strength in the US economy.

The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 
51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. 
This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015.

The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and 
US Treasury bond prices lower.

Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt 
from any agreement by Opec to cut production.

Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an 
output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month 
to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much 
individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in 
November.

But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to 
whether any agreement could be reached after all.

Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West 
Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, does not seem to have given up 
yet on an EU-Canada trade deal:

Here’s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. 
Jennifer Rankin writes:

The European Union’s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this 
week appear to have gone up in smoke, afterBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belgium> announced it could not sign the 
treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments.

The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British 
government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit.

The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium 
was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks 
between the country’s federal and regional leaders.

The Belgian stalemate means Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is 
expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign 
the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next 
steps remained unclear.

Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau 
later on Monday.

Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, 
but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained 
stuck.

Paul Magnette, Wallonia’s minister-president, who has led opposition to the 
deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis 
talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel.

A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&T’s £70bn offer for Time Warner, and 
better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most 
markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory 
orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 
7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The FTSE’s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the 
red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their 
gains, but the fall for London’s chief index is the standout feature of the 
day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps 
the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has 
shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit 
uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that 
appears, on the basis of today’s PMI numbers, to be looking much more 
attractive.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58

UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments 
in the EU-Canada trade deal.

Speaking in parliament she said: “I share everyone’s disappointment in the 
stalled talks between the EU and Canada.”

But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK’s own 
negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to 
replicate an existing model but build its own.

Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable 
exception.

Helped by M&A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany’s 
Dax is 0.8% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 0.65%.

But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back 
below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, 
financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day’s better than expected 
PMI readings.

The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this 
Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 
forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the 
former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after 
the bell to approach 18250.

Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the 
German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, 
meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors 
continued to react to this morning’s troublesome CBI industrial order 
expectations slide.
 
More from Reuters on Belgium’s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal:

“We cannot give a yes,” Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, 
told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with 
Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU 
authorities.

Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged 
behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel’s liberal-led 
federal coalition:

“We have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and 
it’s a No from the others,” said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the 
meeting at Michel’s residence lasting less than an hour.

“It’s a real shame,” the center-right leader said. “We’re the laughing stock 
of the whole world. It’s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for 
Europe, for the whole world.”

Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he 
were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not 
in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are 
ready to support...

Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent 
and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada’s 
by C$12 billion (US $9 billion).

Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from 
Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and 
foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public 
policy.

Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved 
powers to play domestic politics.

Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette’s 
stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his 
reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium.
 
Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US 
PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. 
He said:

Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier 
in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and 
new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly 
widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential 
election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued 
spending and investment in recent months.

There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate 
inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore 
provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter.

Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring 
remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on 
domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain 
economic and political outlook.

More signs of strength in the US economy.

The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 
51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. 
This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015.

The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and 
US Treasury bond prices lower.
