As much as $12bn in digital advertising revenue in the US could be lost if web 
users continue taking up adblocking at the current rate.

A forecast by analytics firm Optimal says more than 43 million people in the 
US will use an ad blocker this year, taking more than $3.8bn (£2.63m) out of 
the digital ad industry. At the current rate of growth, that figure will more 
than triple to over $12bn by 2020 when more than 100 million US web users will 
be blocking ads.

Optimal said its forecast suggested adblocking would reduce US digital ad 
revenue from a predicted $50bn in 2020 to $38bn. The prediction will add to 
worries among publishers already feeling the squeeze from downward pressure on 
the rates they can charge for ads.

Optimal said that it has found almost half of those it surveyed were now aware 
that blocking ads was possible, meaning there was still significant room for 
more people to begin doing so.

It added: “Given that adblockers are often distributed to users without 
charge, the increase in awareness of adblocking will be a major adoption 
driver, and it is possible that publisher action to curtail content to 
adblocking users might actually further increase consumer awareness of 
online/mobile adblocking.”

The forecast also highlights Facebook’s comparative immunity to the problem, 
predicting just 3.2% of the company’s mobile ad revenue will be lost in 2020, 
equivalent to $335m.

In contrast, other publishers will see around a third of their potential ad 
revenue eaten by adblockers by 2020, though that will be partially offset by 
rises in the amount companies are prepared to pay per person with a smaller 
audience accepting ads.
