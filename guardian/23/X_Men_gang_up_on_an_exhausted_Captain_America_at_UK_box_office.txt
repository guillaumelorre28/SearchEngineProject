With £5.31m plus £2.05m in previews, X-Men: Apocalypse easily elbowed aside a 
flagging Captain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 to win the UK weekend box office. But how does that £7.35m opening compare to 
previous entries in the X-Men franchise?

The bad news for Fox and Marvel is that the number is down on the debut of 
previous instalment, Days of Future Past, which kicked off two years ago with 
£9.14m, including previews of £1.59m. However, that film had the benefit of 
combining both X-Men casts, a time-travel conceit that cannot easily be 
repeated. Predecessor First Class, which introduced younger cast members James 
McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and co, began with £5.44m, 
including previews of £2.01m. In other words, Apocalypse has delivered the 
biggest opening for an X-Men film that doesn’t feature Patrick Stewart and Ian 
McKellen.

X-Men: Apocalypse: the trailer for the new Marvel prequel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/10/x-men-apocalypse-the-trailer-for-the-new-marvel-prequel-video>
Only two X-Men/Wolverine movies have cracked £20m at the UK box office. X-Men 
2 was first to do so in 2003, with £20.7m. X-Men: Days of Future Past overshot 
the target in 2014, with £27.1m. Helpfully, this time around Apocalypse does 
not face much direct competition in the coming weeks, unless you count 
videogame spinoff Warcraft: the Beginning, arriving on 3 June. Less helpfully, 
reviews have been soft, with a51/100 score at Metacritic 
<http://www.metacritic.com/movie/x-men-apocalypse>, which suggests the film may 
struggle to engage broader audiences once the hardcore X-Men fanbase has been 
burned through.

Apocalypse’s £7.35m opening compares with a giant £13.73m (including previews 
of £3.76m) for X-Men spin-off Deadpool, in February. The disparity between 
those two debut numbers is one that few would have predicted at the start of 
the year.

After a relatively disappointing debut of £2.12m, Sony Animation’s The Angry 
Birds Movie makes up lost ground with a sensational hold, down just 6%, with 
second-frame takings of £2.01m. After 10 days, the spinoff of the Rovio game 
app has reached a reasonably healthy £4.55m.

The Angry Birds Movie review – game spin-off that doesn't quite reach Lego

One challenge for Angry Birds in the UK has been the sustained performance of 
Disney’s The Jungle Book, a film that has been particularly huge with families 
despite an all-audience positioning. The Jungle Book added another £1.45m at 
the weekend (its sixth), down just 11% from the previous frame, and now stands 
at £41.3m.The Jungle Book <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-jungle-book> is 
the only 2016 release so far to crack £40m at the UK box office.

The Irish hit: Sing Street

Sing Street review – pitch perfect Commitments-style school of rock
 Read more  <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/sing-street-review> 
With the Dublin-set Sing Street, from Once director John Carney, Lionsgate 
took the decision to release in Ireland and Northern Ireland first, 
establishing it as a hit there, before expanding to mainland UK. The first part 
of the strategy certainly worked, achieving a tidy £860,000 over nine weeks. 
And Lionsgate has declared itself satisfied with the UK expansion: £126,000 
from 85 cinemas, yielding a site average of £1,486. Considering a scant supply 
of familiar cast names – lead actors Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Lucy Boynton are 
newcomers, with Jack Reynor and Aidan Gillen in supporting roles – that result 
does indeed look pretty decent.

Sing Street has an IMDb user rating of 8.3/10 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3544112/reference> and a Metacritic score of 79/100
 <http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing-street>, so Lionsgate has reason to be 
hopeful that word-of-mouth on the song-peppered, 1985-set teen romance will be 
strong. Total so far is £986,000. Once grossed £681,000 in the UK and Ireland 
over the course of its lifetime.

The Polish hit: Planet Single

For the second time in five weeks, UK cinemas have delivered a significant 
Polish-language hit. The latest is romantic comedy Planeta Singli, AKA Planet 
Single, which debuted at the weekend with £95,000 from 57 venues. The film is 
playing exclusively in Odeons, although specialist distributor Phoenix says it 
will expand to other venues once it has ended its Odeon run. Top-performing 
site was Odeon Uxbridge, a nine-screen plex you don’t often see among a film’s 
biggest-grossing venues, and presumably reflecting a large local Polish 
population.

Planet Single comes from director Mitja Okorn, who previously scored a big hit 
in Poland with multi-strand festive comedy Letters to Santa. Planet Single 
topped the Polish box office in mid-February, and Poland was the only one out 
of 61 major markets where Deadpool was not the No 1 title that weekend. The 
film also performed very strongly in Okorn’s country of birth, Slovenia.

In the UK, the success for Planet Single follows Pitbull: Nowe Porzadki, which 
debuted with an even better £146,000 and has reached £475,000 so far. Prior to 
the arrival of Phoenix with these two films, the UK has been quiet lately for 
films targeting the sizeable Polish population, following a trickle of hits in 
2012 including Polish Roulette (£240,000) and You Are God (£278,000). In 2014, 
foreign language Oscar-winner Ida was positioned for traditional arthouse 
audiences by indie specialist Curzon Artificial Eye, earning £518,000.

Admissions update

Admissions numbers are in for April – number of tickets sold – and they are 
down on 2015, which benefited from big hits including Fast & Furious 7 and 
Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Cinema Advertising Association is reporting 
admissions last month of 13.13m, down 13% on April 2015. For the first four 
months of the year, admissions are 2% down on the same period a year ago. May 
2015 was not a particularly strong month for cinemagoing, so cinemas will 
almost certainly catch up this month. The real challenge for 2016 is that the 
release calendar in Q3 and Q4 seems to lack equivalent hits to 2015 monster 
titles such as Jurassic World, Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
