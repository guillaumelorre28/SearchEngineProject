The winner: Bridget Jones’s Baby

The residual affection for endearingly self-sabotaging singleton Bridget Jones 
meant it was always likely that a large audience would show up on opening 
weekend, which it did, resulting in an impressive UK debut of £8.11m. What 
happened next was always going to be harder to call – word-of-mouth would play 
a big factor inBridget Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
’s continued fortunes.

On the evidence so far, that audience word is very warm. First, the film held 
up well in midweek, grossing a nifty £6.65m over the Monday-to-Thursday period, 
for a seven-day total of £14.77m. Next, Baby declined just 20% on its second 
weekend, earning another £6.45m for a 10-day tally of £21.22m.

Bridget Jones’s Baby: watch Renée Zellweger return in new trailer – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video>
While a few films so far this year in the UK have earned money quicker – 
notablyBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill>
 andCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 – cracking £20m in 10 days is phenomenal for a film that does not have the 
benefit of a top-tier superhero. And Baby is already ahead of the total gross 
of summer blockbusters such asX-Men: Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/x-men-apocalypse-review-marvel-jennifer-lawrence-oscar-isaac>
 (£18.35m),Star Trek Beyond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/15/star-trek-beyond-review-zachary-quinto-spock-anton-yelchin>
 (£15.95m) andIndependence Day: Resurgence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/independence-day-2-resurgence-review-sequel-jeff-goldblum-charlotte-gainsbourg>
 (£12.10m). It will soon overtakeJason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp>
, which has reached £23.03m. Universal reports that Baby is already the highest 
grossing film ever released in September in the UK. Top September titles from 
recent years includeLegend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/legend-review-tom-hardy-on-double-duty-in-cartoonish-krays-biopic>
 (£18.3m),Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/15/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-film-review>
 (£14.2m) andLooper <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/looper-review>
 (£10.2m).

In the US, takings for Bridget Jones’s Baby are a disappointing $16.6m, but 
foreign takings are surging ahead with $67.4m so far, boosted by big numbers in 
the UK and Australia.Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1348598,00.html>
 grossed $40m in the US and $222m in foreign.Bridget Jones’s Diary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/13/helenfielding> saw less of a 
disparity, although foreign ($210m) far exceeded the US total ($72m).

The runner-up: The Magnificent Seven

Bridget Jones’s Baby in its second weekend grossed more than three times its 
nearest competitor,The Magnificent Seven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington>
, which debuted with a decent £2.13m. The western remake likewise opened in the 
US at the weekend, grossing $34.7m. By rule of thumb, based on the US result, 
you might expect a UK debut of about £3.5m. However, that yardstick was never 
likely to apply in the case of The Magnificent Seven. First, westerns are 
rarely as popular in the UK. And second, lead actorDenzel Washington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/denzelwashington> has consistently proved a 
bigger star in the US.

In terms of recent comparisons, The Hateful Eight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/07/the-hateful-eight-review-tarantino-triumphs-with-a-western-of-wonder>
 kicked off earlier this year with a more muscular £2.78m, whileDjango Unchained
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review> began 
with an almost identical £2.80m.

The family surge

While adult-skewing films typically decay each week at a rate of about 40-45%, 
that is not the case for virtually all the family titles in the marketplace.
Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
’s gentle dip of just 5% sees it back in the Top 5 in its ninth week of 
release. After an uncertain start,Kubo and the Two Strings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review-animation>
 is also holding well, with declines of 29% and 16%. It’s in third place, just 
above Finding Dory.The BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-steven-spieberg-roald-dahl>
, down just 3% from the previous weekend, is back in the Top 10, and with 
£29.8m so far looks certain to crack £30m. Lower down the chart,Pete’s Dragon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak>
,Ice Age: Collision Course

andThe Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
 all posted very strong holds.

The soft debut: The Girl With All the Gifts

For a modestly budgeted, smart British indie genre film such as The Girl with 
All the Gifts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/the-girl-with-all-the-gifts-review-gemma-arterton-glenn-close>
, a UK debut of £433,000 (including £20,000 previews) sounds not so shabby. But 
a soft site average of only £1,175 tells a different story, and that’s because 
UK distributor Warners rolled the film out into a broad 368 cinemas.
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHjGkB_oWTe0&picture=>

It’s easy to criticise the strategy as likely to dilute the film’s target 
audience, and a focus on indie cinemas would have given the sector more 
ownership of the film, and thus boosted the average. But younger genre fans are 
more likely to be found in multiplex venues, and Warners had every reason to go 
after that audience.

Also in indieland, Taika Waititi’s comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-sam-neill-misfit-kid-kiwi-hit>
 posted an encouraging hold, down just 19% at the box office, albeit helped by 
a modest expansion from 63 to 76 cinemas. The film is performing particularly 
well in indie venues, and gross so far is £391,000.

Brotherhood sets franchise record

Noel Clarke’s Brotherhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/brotherhood-review-silly-gangster-porn-version-of-kids-tv>
 fell another 50% at the weekend, is now down at number 18. But it’s the 
cumulative total that deserves attention: £3.53m, after less than four weeks’ 
play. In 2008, Adulthood stunned industry commentators when it grossed £3.35m 
in the UK, up from £454,000 for 2006’s Kidulthood. Few thought the audience 
would return in such strong numbers for a sequel arriving so long after the 
earlier hits.

The Irish hit: The Young Offenders

Irish distributor Wildcard had a hit on its hands when local comedy The Young 
Offenders <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4714568/> began life with £118,000 from 
65 cinemas, plus previews of £54,000. But the story is now even better, with 
second-weekend takings of £143,000 (up 20%), for a total so far of £415,000. 
The film stars newcomers Alex Murphy and Chris Walley as two teenage boys who 
cycle 100 miles on stolen bikes in search of a missing bale of cocaine worth 
€7m. A UK release is under discussion.

The future

The lack of major releases meant UK grosses overall were 13% down on the 
previous session. However, due to the continued powerful performance of Bridget 
Jones’s Baby, takings were 61% up on the late-September frame from 2015, when
Everest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/everest-review-jake-gyllenhaal>, 
Legend andThe Maze Runner: Scorch Trials 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/maze-runner-the-scorch-trials-review-a-ya-franchise-runs-out-of-steam>
 held on to the chart’s top places. Overall, admissions for September look 
certain to post a rise on the same month last year.
