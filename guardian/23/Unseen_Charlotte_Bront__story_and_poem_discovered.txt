An unpublished short story by Charlotte Brontë 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlottebronte> featuring flogging and 
embezzling, as well as a poem stuffed with thees and thous, have been 
discovered inside a book owned by the novelist’s mother.

Maria Brontë died when her six children – the authors Emily, Charlotte and 
Anne among them – were very young. Among the few possessions she left behind 
was a copy of Robert Southey’s The Remains of Henry Kirke White, which was 
“much-treasured” by the family, according to theBrontë Society 
<https://www.bronte.org.uk/bronte-society>. Stuffed with annotations, sketches, 
and markings by various members of the household, the volume just acquired by 
the society also contains unpublished manuscripts by the teenage Charlotte, 
stuck in among the pages.

“We knew the book existed but we didn’t know it had these papers in it,” said 
spokesperson Rebecca Yorke. “They’ve never been published or come to light 
before.”

The family sold the book after the death of Charlotte’s father Patrick in 
1861. It travelled from the family home in Haworth to the US, where it 
eventually ended up in the hands of an American book collector. The circle will 
be completed in the new year, with the volume due to go on display at theBrontë 
Parsonage Museum in Haworth <https://www.bronte.org.uk/>. The society received 
£170,000 for the purchase from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, in addition 
to contributions from the V&A Purchase Grant Fund and the Friends of the 
National Libraries.

Collections manager at the museum Ann Dinsdale called the book “one of the 
most significant Brontë items to come to light in many years”.

She described the finds as “hugely important”. The book “was clearly well-used 
and of great sentimental value to the Brontë children, who lost their mother 
while they were very young. In addition, the unpublished writings by Charlotte 
offer new opportunities for research, which is really exciting.”

Both pieces of work relate to the fantasy world of Angria imagined by 
Charlotte and her brother Branwell in a series of tiny books. “It played a huge 
part in their lives,” said Dinsdale. “Everything they read and everyone they 
met in Haworth fed into their imaginary world.”

The short story features a public flogging, embezzling from the Wesleyan 
chapel, and a “vicious” caricature of the Reverend John Winterbottom – a 
religious opponent of the children’s father. Winterbottom is “in the middle of 
the night dragged from his bed” and then “by the heels from one end of the 
village to the other”, writes Charlotte in the story.

The poem features Mary Percy, the lovesick wife of the king of Angria Zamorna, 
and “one of the leading Angria characters”, said Dinsdale. “It’s quite an 
ambitious poem for a young girl, full of thees and thous,” she added.

“Mary thou dids’t not know that I was nigh / Thou dids’t not know my gaze was 
fixed on thee,” the poem opens. “I stood apart and watched thee passing by / In 
all thy calm unconscious majesty.”

The pieces have been dated to 1833, when Charlotte would have been around 17. 
The story runs to 74 lines, and the poem is 77 lines. Dinsdale predicted that 
it would be of interest to general readers as well as scholars. “It’s of 
interest to anyone interested in Charlotte’s life, and because of the tragic 
story of the Brontës, their lives are particularly appealing to a wide range of 
people,” she said.

Historian Juliet Barker, author of the biography The Brontës, said that “the 
book alone is a valuable acquisition because of its rare associations with Mrs 
Brontë before her marriage to Patrick, but its importance is immeasurably 
increased by the unpublished manuscripts tipped into it”.

According to the Brontë Society, the Southey title is one of Maria’s “rare 
surviving possessions”, after a box containing all her property was shipwrecked 
off the Devon coast shortly before she married Patrick Brontë in 1812. It also 
features Patrick’s Latin inscription, reading that it was “the book of my 
dearest wife and it was saved from the waves. So then it will always be 
preserved.”
