Final thoughts

Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> are in the final 
and that’s the important thing. They’ll get a chance to win, on home soil, 
their first Asian Cup but to do so they will have to find a way through South 
Korea’s staunch defence.

I think it’s fair to say they’ll need to lift from tonight’s performance. 
Australia started well and were full of running as expected. But it was almost 
as if the two early goals took away their edge, their Eye of the Tiger if you 
will. The UAE weren’t crash hot themselves and though Khalil, particularly, and 
Omar schemed, they never looked like overhauling Australia’s early lead. But 
they should be pleased with their showing at the tournament. I’m sure they 
exceeded all their expectations.

Australia can now focus on the final. 

A few quick words from goalscorer Jason Davidson before I go: “Since I left 
home at 14 it was always my dream to play for the green and gold. And to score 
a goal for the team and help them get to the Asian Cup final is a dream come 
true.”

Join us on Saturday night for what we hope will be an historic night for 
Australian football. Thanks for your emails and eyes. Cheerio!

80 min: Apparently Postecoglou is twitching on the sidelines like a man with a

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> are also lacking intensity,

78 min: Kruse goes down like the proverbial sack... He was caught late by a 
lazy boot, but he’s fine. Just chagrined.

The crowd? 21,079. Could have been at least three times that at Stadium 
Straya. Ah well.

77 min: A Luongo corner after some good work from Kruse... It finds Jedinak at 
the back of the area but his header troubles no-one, least of all Naser.

74 min: Naser definitely touched that one! Leckie, from the edge of the box, 
hits a too weak right foot shot across goal. Naser dives to his right and very 
obviously gets a glove to it before it goes over the byline. Again no corner is 
given. Leckie makes a polite enquiry with an angry face.

72 min: Luongo comes very close! Leckie turns himself into space, slides a 
ball to Luongo on the right and the Swindon Town man has time to measure a left 
foot curler that may have snuck inside the far post were it not for Naser’s 
fingertips. But no corner is given. Perhaps Naser didn’t touch it after all. Or 
the ref got it wrong. It happens.

68 min: Penalty UAE? Nah. Davidson slides in to rob Sanqour in the box, and 
Sanqour falls over Davidson’s leg which clearly made contact with the ball. 
Omar’s corner is dreadful.

67 min: Sub Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Sir 
Tim gets an early rest. Juric gets some decent time to get a telling goal.

66 min: Sub UAE: Khalil off, strangely. Al Kathiri on.

Moments later the UAE appeal for a penalty after Omar threads a nice ball into 
the box that Abbas chases. Franjic was close but Abbas went down without being 
touched from what I could see. He should have been carded for that.

64 min: Luongo tries to find Kruse in behind the defence with a clever reverse 
pass but it’s intercepted. Not clever enough, I guess.

As the rain falls heavily Jedinak stands on the heel of our man Omar and he 
earns himself a yellow. Previous yellows were expunged prior to the semis so 
Jedinak will still play in the final. IfAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> make it, that is.

62 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> corner. 
Cahill rises like the morning sun and is about to get his forehead to it with 
the goal open but a well-placed Naser fist punches it away with no time to 
spare. Cahill is called for a foul but I couldn’t spot one.

it sails way too far, as if Newcastle is at altitude. The Socceroos have been 
somewhat sloppy this half.

57 min: A poor touch from Kruse following a ball from the Socceroos’ defence 
catches his marker by surprise and the ball races into the UAE half. Kruse 
pursues it, catches up, and dribbles into a dangerous area. When he finally 
gets a shot away he scuffs it. Should have done better.

53 min: A good period for the UAE here. On the right, Mabkhout beats Davidson 
with pace and slides a dangerous cross along the six-yard box. Khalil was the 
target but he couldn’t get there.

51 min: Another Omar cameo, a reverse pass to Sanqour, I think, but it’s 
over-hit and goes over the byline.

Moments later, Khalil turns on a pass 30 yards out and he thumps it goalward. 
Ryan dives to his left but the ball just curls past the left post. That was hit 
with real venom. He’s threatened tonight, Khalil.

47 min: No rhythm to speak off just yet this half ... a bit of too and fro. 

And speaking of ’fros Omar digs a lovely lofted ball to the feet of Mabkhout 
at the top of the area but as he takes a soft touch and shapes for a shot the 
flag goes up. If he was off-side it was line-ball. A tough decision for the 
UAE. That could well have been a goal.

Peeeeeep!

The UAE start us off but Cahill pilfers the ball and finds Kruse but his 
through ball to Luongo is over hit.

And they’re back on the pitch. The Socceroos can’t afford to think this game

Some emails before I get a quick cuppa:

Wes Court writes in from Abu Dhabi: “Watching the match at an Abu Dhabi 
university cafeteria surrounded by uproarious students. It’s very inspiring, 
yet I can’t help but think UAE just aren’t good enough for a comeback. But if 
Bradford City can score four uninterrupted goals against Chelsea, then 
anything’s possible. At least the fish sticks are good.”

That’s what Jose Mourinho said when he went to the Stamford Bridge cafeteria 
after that loss to Bradford.

Nick Mangafas is also abroad. Not, to be clear, a broad: “Good morning from 
Perchtoldsdorf, Lower Austria.I’m lovin’ it. Come on Australia!”

I had to look up Perchtoldsdorf, Nick, just in case it was German for ‘Get a 
Rat Up Ya’. Not that I doubt you, just being safe.

Todd Baker reckons the atmosphere is lacking: “Poor stadium for a semifinal. 
No atmosphere.”

Half-time

Peeep! And it’s time for snakes and gummy bears! Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> will be delighted with their 
two goal lead though Ange will get up them, to speak in layman’s terms, for 
some of their loose passing. The UAE had threatened, mostly through Khalil, and 
Omar, but they’ve only created on clear chance.

45 + 1 min: A long ball from Omar falls just outside the area but Ryan comes

34 min: There are acres of space on the UAE right side. Davidson could set a 
tent up without being troubled.

But here’s Khalil romping down the right flank. Is he the UAE’s Didier Drogba? 
But his attempt at a square ball is poor and Ryan picks up the crumbs.

33 min: The game has hit a bit of a lull, oddly. And as I write that Simon 
Hill says Ange Postecoglou looks peeved and wants the Socceroos to step it up.

Endeavouring to do so Luongo runs the ball over the byline. Ah well. He tried.

30 min: Khalil turns Spiranovic inside out and left foots towards Omar near 
the spot. Taking no chances Davidson kicks it out for a corner.

Khalil gets to the cross despite three yellow shirts around him but he can 
only head over.

28 min: Peter Oh spotted the Gravity reference and adds to it. “It looks like 
the UAE have already done a George Clooney in this one, doesn’t it?”

Phil Withall writes in to advise caution. “Are we supposed to think the cup is 
in the bag now or take a more measured approach? Social media currently 
suggests the former but I’d rather take my views from an MBM any day.”

You are a wise man, Phil. This MBM’er has a reputation for not getting carried 
away. About anything. I only put exclamation marks in my copy because I feel 
it’s expected of me.

to Milligan, then Luongo, on the right. Luongo mishits his cross and it worries 
keeper Naser for a moment before he realises it’s too high.

24 min: UAE coach Ali Mahdi has his red cap on in case you were wondering.

Leckie, meanwhile, works in well with Davidson on the left but his attempt at 
a cross is intercepted. Be great to see Leckie get a goal. He needs one like 
Hamlet needed a root. I get the feeling if he scores once he’ll find it to his 
liking.

close  
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> are in the final 
and that’s the important thing. They’ll get a chance to win, on home soil, 
their first Asian Cup but to do so they will have to find a way through South 
Korea’s staunch defence.

I think it’s fair to say they’ll need to lift from tonight’s performance. 
Australia started well and were full of running as expected. But it was almost 
as if the two early goals took away their edge, their Eye of the Tiger if you 
will. The UAE weren’t crash hot themselves and though Khalil, particularly, and 
Omar schemed, they never looked like overhauling Australia’s early lead. But 
they should be pleased with their showing at the tournament. I’m sure they 
exceeded all their expectations.

Australia can now focus on the final. 

A few quick words from goalscorer Jason Davidson before I go: “Since I left 
home at 14 it was always my dream to play for the green and gold. And to score 
a goal for the team and help them get to the Asian Cup final is a dream come 
true.”

Join us on Saturday night for what we hope will be an historic night for 
Australian football. Thanks for your emails and eyes. Cheerio!

 
Peeeep! Peeeeeeeeeeeep!

And that’s that. Australia will face South Korea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea> in the final on Saturday 
night.
 
90 + 3 min: And just before the whistle James Troisi weaves through the 
penalty area to the byline but his square ball doesn’t find its mark.
 
90 + 3 min: Eliot Owen helps out Tom Georgeson: “It’s on Eurosport 2.”

Quick, Tom, there are seconds left!
 
90 + 2 min: The crowd comes to life as the end approaches. You can take that 
two ways. You decide.
 
90 min: Sainsbury slides in brilliantly to dispossess Mabkhout just as the 
danger man steadied for a shot from inside the area.

Leckie is the target of a breakaway but his shot is smothered. 
 
89 min: Leckie, on the ball, wins a freekick after he gets a huge shoulder in 
the back. Whose huge shoulder? I missed it dangnabbit.
 
88 min: The UAE look too tired now to fashion a miracle ending. They are 
hardly damning the torpedos.
 
86 min: Tom Georgeson joins us late to ask a question that seems to have an 
obvious answer: “Why can’t I find this game on English TV? Am I being dumb???”
 
85 min: Juric does well to make space for himself with a zig-zagging dribble. 
He manages a left-foot shot but he drags it wide.
 
84 min: The UAE have indeed done better in this second half without creating 
much it has to be said.
AFC Asian Cup (@afcasiancup) 
75' UAE have come back into this match in the 2nd half. Will they be rewarded?

<https://twitter.com/afcasiancup/status/560023121181175808>  
82 min: Sub Australia: Kruse off, Troisi on.
 
81 min: Kruse is put into space by a nice Leckie through ball but twice he is 
foiled by some good defence as UAE clear.
 
80 min: Apparently Postecoglou is twitching on the sidelines like a man with a 
meerkat in his trousers. He’s not happy at all with Australia’s poor passing 
and poor decision making.Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> are also lacking intensity, 
but I won’t tell Ange. He is bothered enough already.
 
78 min: Kruse goes down like the proverbial sack... He was caught late by a 
lazy boot, but he’s fine. Just chagrined.

The crowd? 21,079. Could have been at least three times that at Stadium 
Straya. Ah well.
 
77 min: A Luongo corner after some good work from Kruse... It finds Jedinak at 
the back of the area but his header troubles no-one, least of all Naser.
 
74 min: Naser definitely touched that one! Leckie, from the edge of the box, 
hits a too weak right foot shot across goal. Naser dives to his right and very 
obviously gets a glove to it before it goes over the byline. Again no corner is 
given. Leckie makes a polite enquiry with an angry face.
 
72 min: Luongo comes very close! Leckie turns himself into space, slides a 
ball to Luongo on the right and the Swindon Town man has time to measure a left 
foot curler that may have snuck inside the far post were it not for Naser’s 
fingertips. But no corner is given. Perhaps Naser didn’t touch it after all. Or 
the ref got it wrong. It happens.
 
70 min: Gareth Williams is enjoying the MBM and he’s watching from Gaborone 
Botswana. “Loving it ... loving the score even more!!!”
 
68 min: Penalty UAE? Nah. Davidson slides in to rob Sanqour in the box, and 
Sanqour falls over Davidson’s leg which clearly made contact with the ball. 
Omar’s corner is dreadful.
 
67 min: Sub Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Sir 
Tim gets an early rest. Juric gets some decent time to get a telling goal.
 
66 min: Sub UAE: Khalil off, strangely. Al Kathiri on.

Moments later the UAE appeal for a penalty after Omar threads a nice ball into 
the box that Abbas chases. Franjic was close but Abbas went down without being 
touched from what I could see. He should have been carded for that.
 
64 min: Luongo tries to find Kruse in behind the defence with a clever reverse 
pass but it’s intercepted. Not clever enough, I guess.

As the rain falls heavily Jedinak stands on the heel of our man Omar and he 
earns himself a yellow. Previous yellows were expunged prior to the semis so 
Jedinak will still play in the final. IfAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> make it, that is.
 
62 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> corner. 
Cahill rises like the morning sun and is about to get his forehead to it with 
the goal open but a well-placed Naser fist punches it away with no time to 
spare. Cahill is called for a foul but I couldn’t spot one.
 
61 min: Don’t think Milligan was too happy about being subbed. That’s how I 
look when I hear I have another kids birthday party to attend.

58' SUB for @Socceroos <https://twitter.com/Socceroos>: Mark Milligan OFF,

<https://twitter.com/afcasiancup/status/560018632508321792>  
60 min: Oh dear. Luongo attempts a left foot lofted pass ahead of Leckie but 
it sails way too far, as if Newcastle is at altitude. The Socceroos have been 
somewhat sloppy this half.
 
58 min: Sub Australia: Milligan off. Matt KcKay on. Yes, his shirt is tucked 
in. Impecable grooming, Matt.
 
57 min: A poor touch from Kruse following a ball from the Socceroos’ defence 
catches his marker by surprise and the ball races into the UAE half. Kruse 
pursues it, catches up, and dribbles into a dangerous area. When he finally 
gets a shot away he scuffs it. Should have done better.
 
55 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> counter 
through Davison and Kruse on the left but it comes to nowt.
 
53 min: A good period for the UAE here. On the right, Mabkhout beats Davidson 
with pace and slides a dangerous cross along the six-yard box. Khalil was the 
target but he couldn’t get there.
 
51 min: Another Omar cameo, a reverse pass to Sanqour, I think, but it’s 
over-hit and goes over the byline.

Moments later, Khalil turns on a pass 30 yards out and he thumps it goalward. 
Ryan dives to his left but the ball just curls past the left post. That was hit 
with real venom. He’s threatened tonight, Khalil.
 
50 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> win 
successive corners, the second of which causes Naser more trouble. He comes off 
his line to punch but almost cracks Sainsbury in the back of the head.
 
47 min: No rhythm to speak off just yet this half ... a bit of too and fro. 

And speaking of ’fros Omar digs a lovely lofted ball to the feet of Mabkhout 
at the top of the area but as he takes a soft touch and shapes for a shot the 
flag goes up. If he was off-side it was line-ball. A tough decision for the 
UAE. That could well have been a goal.
 
The UAE start us off but Cahill pilfers the ball and finds Kruse but his 
through ball to Luongo is over hit.
 
And they’re back on the pitch. The Socceroos can’t afford to think this game 
is won.

Sub UAE: Mohamed Abdulrahman is subbed for Ismail Al Hammadi

Some emails before I get a quick cuppa:

Wes Court writes in from Abu Dhabi: “Watching the match at an Abu Dhabi 
university cafeteria surrounded by uproarious students. It’s very inspiring, 
yet I can’t help but think UAE just aren’t good enough for a comeback. But if 
Bradford City can score four uninterrupted goals against Chelsea, then 
anything’s possible. At least the fish sticks are good.”

That’s what Jose Mourinho said when he went to the Stamford Bridge cafeteria 
after that loss to Bradford.

Nick Mangafas is also abroad. Not, to be clear, a broad: “Good morning from 
Perchtoldsdorf, Lower Austria.I’m lovin’ it. Come on Australia!”

I had to look up Perchtoldsdorf, Nick, just in case it was German for ‘Get a 
Rat Up Ya’. Not that I doubt you, just being safe.

Todd Baker reckons the atmosphere is lacking: “Poor stadium for a semifinal. 
No atmosphere.”
 
Peeep! And it’s time for snakes and gummy bears! Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> will be delighted with their 
two goal lead though Ange will get up them, to speak in layman’s terms, for 
some of their loose passing. The UAE had threatened, mostly through Khalil, and 
Omar, but they’ve only created on clear chance.
 
45 + 1 min: A long ball from Omar falls just outside the area but Ryan comes 
for it anyway and, winning it, heads clear. Got to love that.
 
45 min: Cahill called offside again and again Ange looks annoyed. But the 
Socceroos regain control again and Kruse and Davidson exchange passes trying to 
fashion an opening. ButAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> turn it over. Not for the 
first time.
 
44 min: Franjic clears an Omar cross and finds Leckie is plenty of space on 
the right. He finds Luongo but he turns it over cheaply. It’s the first time 
this tournament he’s looked out of sorts. No Mas? Give him time.
 
42 min: Leckie gets a yellow for coming in late to a tackle. At the same time 
Matt Leonard asks: “It’s nearly time to play my second favourite Tim Cahill 
football drinking game: ‘Pick the minute he gets his yellow card’.”
 
40 min: Omar dribbles like a beautiful baby through the Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> area but he’s doggedly 
followed and he can’t quite get a shot off. But the UAE win a corner. Nothing 
comes of it.
 
39 min: Or was that quote from Commando? Anyway, Matt Ryan lofts a cracking 
kick 50m over the head to Cahill but the No.4 is called offside. Cahill was on 
his own side of halfway when the ball was kicked. Ange wasn’t happy.
 
36 min: The AFC stats boffins confirm Khalil’s right side romping. Or is that 
a still from Predator? Get to da chopper!

<https://twitter.com/afcasiancup/status/560008348339159041>  
34 min: There are acres of space on the UAE right side. Davidson could set a 
tent up without being troubled.

But here’s Khalil romping down the right flank. Is he the UAE’s Didier Drogba? 
But his attempt at a square ball is poor and Ryan picks up the crumbs.
 
33 min: The game has hit a bit of a lull, oddly. And as I write that Simon 
Hill says Ange Postecoglou looks peeved and wants the Socceroos to step it up.

Endeavouring to do so Luongo runs the ball over the byline. Ah well. He tried.
 
30 min: Khalil turns Spiranovic inside out and left foots towards Omar near 
the spot. Taking no chances Davidson kicks it out for a corner.

Khalil gets to the cross despite three yellow shirts around him but he can 
only head over.
 
28 min: Peter Oh spotted the Gravity reference and adds to it. “It looks like 
the UAE have already done a George Clooney in this one, doesn’t it?”

Phil Withall writes in to advise caution. “Are we supposed to think the cup is 
in the bag now or take a more measured approach? Social media currently 
suggests the former but I’d rather take my views from an MBM any day.”

You are a wise man, Phil. This MBM’er has a reputation for not getting carried 
away. About anything. I only put exclamation marks in my copy because I feel 
it’s expected of me.
 
26 min: Davidson chases down a Kruse one-two and it eventually finds it’s way 
to Milligan, then Luongo, on the right. Luongo mishits his cross and it worries 
keeper Naser for a moment before he realises it’s too high.

fight for the ball. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images  
24 min: UAE coach Ali Mahdi has his red cap on in case you were wondering.

Leckie, meanwhile, works in well with Davidson on the left but his attempt at 
a cross is intercepted. Be great to see Leckie get a goal. He needs one like 
Hamlet needed a root. I get the feeling if he scores once he’ll find it to his 
liking.
