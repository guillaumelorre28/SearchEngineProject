I am 27 and have been in a relationship with an extremely handsome, 
affectionate and loyal man for 18 months. Despite being in my late 20s, this is 
my first serious relationship. It is also the first time I have introduced 
anyone to my family, and they love him. We have talked about children and 
marriage but, although I love him, I’m not sure I want all that with him. I am 
scared that I am settling for him because he is the first man I have been 
serious with. I don’t want to end things and regret it a year or so down the 
line, but if it is not going to work in the long run, wouldn’t it be easier on 
both of us to end it now?
