Take me there: Nefta, Tunisia

This year is the 35th anniversary of the first Star Wars film, and where 
better to celebrate it than in the otherworldly desertscape of southwest 
Tunisia, where much of the movie was shot? The Dar HI hotel, with its startling 
architecture, makes a suitably futuristic base for both sci-fans and those in 
search of some designer sunshine. Nearby attractions include the oasis town of 
Tozeur and the salt lake of Chott el-Jerid (better known to movie buffs as 
Tatooine). A seven-night stay costs from £840pp on an all-inclusive basis (
dar-hi.net/en <http://www.dar-hi.net/en>). Flights with Tunisair from £180 
return (tunisair.com <http://www.tunisair.com/>).

Travel clinic: Family cycling holidays


The dilemma We're feeling brave enough to tackle our first family 
cycling holiday with our sons, aged eight and 10. Can you recommend a suitable 
base for a few days of gentle and independent exploration on two wheels? 
Richard, by email

Joanne replies Combining cosy bunkhouse accommodation with a great little café 
on Devon's Tarka Trail – a gentle and traffic-free cycle route which follows 
disused railway lines through unspoilt countryside – Yarde Orchard (
yarde-orchard.co.uk <http://yarde-orchard.co.uk/>) could be the answer to your 
prayers. Book into the en-suite family room (£50 for the first night, £40 for 
subsequent nights) and you'll have access to a kitchen and lounge with 
wood-burning range for self-catering, or tuck into a hearty cyclist's 
breakfast, pizzas, homemade pies and cakes at the adjacent café.

A similar set-up, albeit in more rugged and challenging terrain, is offered by 
the excellent Dales Bike Centre in Richmond, Yorkshire (dalesbikecentre.co.uk 
<http://dalesbikecentre.co.uk/>) – a hostel, bike shop and café rolled into one 
right on the Yorkshire Dales Cycleway. A four-bed family room normally costs 
£28pp per night but they currently have a half-price deal on accommodation in 
February.
