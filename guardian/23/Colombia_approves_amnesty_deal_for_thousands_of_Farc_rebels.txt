Colombia’s Congress has approved an amnesty law to protect thousands of 
demobilisingFarc <https://www.theguardian.com/world/farc> guerrilla fighters 
from prosecution for minor crimes committed during the country’s 52-year war.


 The law, a key part of a peace deal signed last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/24/colombia-signs-historic-peace-deal-with-farc-rebels>
 between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebels, 
will not include those who have committed war crimes or human rights violations.

 The amnesty also applies to members of the country’s military. It is the 
first in a series of laws tied to the deal that will be pushed through Congress 
in the hope of reassuring rebels who are beginning to move to special 
demobilisation zones.

 The bill passed in the Senate and the lower house, despite vociferous 
opposition from the right-wing Democratic Center party, whose members abstained 
from voting. The coalition of President Juan Manuel Santos, who was awarded the 
Nobel peace prize this month, has a majority in Congress.

About 7,000 Farc fighters are expected to lay down their arms over the next 
six months.

 Rebels found guilty of serious crimes such as massacres, sexual violence or 
kidnapping will not fall under the amnesty and will instead serve alternative 
sentences such as land mine removal, to be determined by a special court.

 In a joint statement on Wednesday, the Farc and the government said they 
would establish how many rebels were not eligible for the amnesty by 30 January 
at the latest.

 Other laws tied to the peace deal include rural reform, compensation to 
victims, removal of land mines and a United Nations-monitored ceasefire. The 
Farc will convert into a political party under the accord.
