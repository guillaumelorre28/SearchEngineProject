The status quo, where male experience dominates British theatre, will continue 
as long as the unelected quango, the Arts Council, refuses to challenge this 
sexual apartheid. For decades the Arts Council has dumped gender equality into 
a category called “diversity”. Its publications on equality perpetuate the 
trope that women are “other”, suggesting that the majority is a minority. As a 
result, the female narrative on the English stage is judged as less 
representative of the human experience. Equal representation of women in all 
levels of theatre, and all subsidised art forms, is crucial. It needs to happen 
now. It should be remembered that female taxpayers, and audiences, are paying 
for work in which their complex lives and experiences rarely appear.
