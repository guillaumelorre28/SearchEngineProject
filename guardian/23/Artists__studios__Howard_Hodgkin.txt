My studio is of necessity a very isolated building. Formally a workshop, and 
before that, a dairy. The room has a dirty glass roof, with dirty white walls, 
and dirty white floor. All four walls are covered with screens of different 
sizes, mostly even dirtier depending on their age. Each one conceals a 
painting, often a very small one, or at least small compared to the size of the 
screen, which enables me to look at one picture at a time and also to show them 
to visitors to the studio one at a time.

The brushes so neatly arranged on the floor (in a completely untypical-of-me 
fashion) are washed once a week by my assistant Neil. I have a "palette", not 
visible in the picture, which is a small table.

As well as the metal folding chair which you can see, there are two old, 
comfortable armchairs. The floor used to be washed from time to time, but this 
has not happened recently. It is too large an area to keep clean.

As my studio is surrounded by other buildings, it surprises visitors by its 
quietness and space somewhere near the middle of central London. As well as 
these two things, the most important thing for me is the glass roof, as I can 
only really work by daylight.
