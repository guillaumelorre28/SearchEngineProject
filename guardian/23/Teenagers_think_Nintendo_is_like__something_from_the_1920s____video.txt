The Nintendo Entertainment System. It’s the best selling 
<http://www.nintendo.com/corp/history.jsp> video console of all time and the 
platform for some classic titles:The Legend of Zelda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/the-legend-of-zelda>, Kung-Fu Master 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/09/bruce-lee-ea-sports->, 
Metroid <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT2ygHfbvos>, Super Mario Bros 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkWrFtMPFLA> and Pinball 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXypHXRLL-E>. But according to today’s 
teenagers, it “looks like a brick from the 1920s”.

In a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDOZbvE01Fk> that has been viewed 
over 4.5 million times since it was uploaded on 9 September, youngsters – aged 
between 15 and 19 – struggled to plug the NES in and boot it up, before they 
were advised of the age-old trick of blowing on the game cartridge to remove 
all the dust, spider webs and general debris that might be nestling in there.

Traversing the sparse, green first level of Super Mario Bros, one gamer 
remarks that she “feels like she’s inRekjavik 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/reykjavik>”, while another comments on the 
console’s snazzy, beige colour scheme.

“Reaction videos <http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reaction-videos>” have been 
hugely popular onYouTube <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube> for a 
while. The Fine Brothers’React YouTube channel 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/React> also includes teenagers bemused by the 
internet in the ‘90s <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0mg9DxvfZE>, and playing 
Mike Tyson’s Punch-Up! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnoIUyCp3dk> (on NES). 
From the other end of the telescope the channel also shows older peopletaking 
on Oculus Rift 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaIbwIJPcVc&list=PL73YndQawY3OPUCvuMvRWsFIJTnJQ4zsv>
. The verdict? “It looks like something you wear for the Ebola crisis.”
