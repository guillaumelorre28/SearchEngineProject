University: the home of free thought and discussion. That’s the fantasy I had 
in mind as I sprung through its doors on a late-summer day in September, eager 
to get cracking with some good, intellectual debate.

But it hasn’t quite panned out like that. On Friday morning I received an 
email explaining that my students’ union had votedto ban the Sun, the Daily 
Mail and the Daily Express 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/18/city-university-students-vote-for-campus-ban-sun-daily-mail-express>
 from campus.

Their reasoning was that these outlets “have a tendency to fuel fascism, 
racial tension and hatred in society”. And as a journalism student here at City 
University London, I can understand at least some of their concerns. Whether 
it’s the Sun’s objectification of women, the Express’ migrant bashing or the 
Mail’s campaign against “benefit scroungers”, it can often feel as if these 
papers do more damage than their presence is worth.

But these aren’t alternative, fringe publications read by a radical minority. 
Together these tabloids represent nearly half of the UK’s daily newspaper 
readership. To ban them – and, in effect, ignore the voice of swathes of the 
population – is to ignore the realities of modern Britain.

The motion, entitled “Opposing Fascism and Social Divisiveness in the UK 
Media”, is a contradiction of the very values that the students’ union claims 
it is protecting. There’s nothing remotely liberal about silencing those you 
may not agree with.

The great irony here is that City is home to one of the world’s top journalism 
schools. It’s said to hold a “legendary status 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/inside-story-the-graduates-531637.html>
” within the media, has been described as “the Oxbridge of journalism 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/postgraduate-mastering-the-art-of-journalism-via-higher-education-10142018.html>
”, and has sent graduates into the most prestigious jobs in the British media.

So the idea that its students’ union feels it must act as a shield against the 
wailings of the tabloid press is worrying. It’s worth pointing out that less 
than 1% of the university’s population – a mere 190 students – turned out to 
vote on the motion. To me, this is comforting, proof that the result is by no 
means representative of the student population. But it is frustrating to know 
that such a small number of misguided idealists have had such an effect on the 
rest of us – even if the ban itself seems practically impossible to implement.

Many other journalism students I have spoken to are strongly opposed to the 
vote. James Walker, 21, says: “The student union’s newspaper ban has damaged 
the reputation of the journalism department and, more importantly, the chances 
of students to get jobs in the industry.”

Is free speech in British universities under threat?

Jonas Henmo, 22, adds: “If we accept this ban, then we allow ourselves to 
become part of an authoritarian organisation.”

Petitions 
<https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/block-tabloid-ban-at-city-university> 
have been launched and protests took place today in the university’s journalism 
department. But even if this ban does get overturned, as it now seems it could, 
the very fact that it was so easily given the go-ahead is worrying.

If 2016 has taught us one thing, it’s that the UK is far more divided than we 
ever thought. The blame for that lies, in some part, with these tabloids and 
their rhetoric. I detest the sexism, xenophobia and Islamophobia they have 
spouted as much as the next left-leaning 21-year-old.

But these are issues that need to be debated, contested, argued. Shooing them 
away simply doesn’t work. If the 3.6 million daily readers of the Sun, Mail and 
Express don’t deserve to be part of the conversation, then I’ll never know who 
does.
