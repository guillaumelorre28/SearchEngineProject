An excellent performance from Saints, and they go through to their first 
League Cup semi-final for 30 years. Arsenal, who made 10 changes, were dreadful 
in the first half, and that’s where the game was lost: Saints scored two on the 
counter-attack, and then defended strongly when Arsenal poured forward in the 
second half. Davis, Reed and Clasie in particular were excellent: they just 
stoppedArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> playing. 
Arsenal’s long wait for a League Cup trophy goes on.

Thanks for reading. Goodbye.

90 min +3 Flicked across the six-yard box, but no one went for it! Coquelin’s 
shot is deflected. Another corner, which falls to Gibbs, who spanks it into 
orbit. That’s game over.

90 min Four minutes of added time. And Martinez denies Højbjerg! Saints could,

87 min Arsenal on the attack, but Southampton

superbly by the touchline, but McQueen can’t apply the final touch! Hacked 
clear by Arsenal. Actually, Maitland-Niles did very well to stop it becoming 
3-0.

83 min Another Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> corner. 
Heavy pressure from the hosts. Iwobi has a go after the first delivery is 
half-cleared, but it’s straight at Forster.

82 min Saints just rocking a little. Davis hacks clear. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> committing plenty of men 
forward, and they force a corner. Taken short, and Gibbs hits it, and Saints do 
just enough to clear. Another corner, this time punched clear by Forster.

81 min Lucas is booked for a late trip on Sims. Just looking back at that 
penalty claim, it was probably the right decision. Martina made slight contact, 
perhaps, but it would have been soft.

77 min David feeds McQueen, and goes for the return, but then lifts the shot 
over the crossbar! It came at him at a difficult height and couldn’t control 
the shot. Now Long goes clean through … and puts it wide! Oh, Shane! That was a 
golden chance for three. Will Saints live to regret that?!

56 min And now Boufal goes close! That was inches wide, and nearly cemented

54 min Nearly three for Saints. McQueen and Martina combined down the right, 
but Martina couldn’t quite find Long with the cross, and Holding comes across 
to concede the corner, which is wasted.

48 min Much better from Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>
. Lovely ball out wide to Jenkinson, and he finds Ramsey unmarked in the box, 
but he can’t quite get the connection, and it loops up into Forster’s arms. 
That’s more like it, though!

Some half-time emails.

Charles Antaki: “All very dismal. With Coquelin and Elneny about as creative 
and forward-looking as treacle, nothing much is going to come Pérez’s way. 
Which maybe just as well for his own sake, since he’s doing everything he can 
to persuade us that he won’t do much with it anyway.”

Mike Nichols: “Minus Cazorla, Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> always seem to err a little too 
much on the side of caution. There’s so much of an emphasis on keeping 
possession on their breaks versus hitting that pass to open up the defense or 
trying to hit an open runner.

“Too many sideways passes, especially with Coqneny at the wheel. I mean, I 
know Arsène wants to rest guys ahead of the Month of Death that December turns 
into, but they could use at least one more incisive player out there. “

What a superb display from Southampton, and what an abject one from Arsenal. 
The Gunners just haven’t got going at all – I don’t think they’ve had an effort 
on target.Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have 
sat deep, filled in the spaces, and counter-attacked briskly – and they’ve 
scored two excellent goals. Arsenal have serious work to do.

Back in 15 minutes!

45 min Super skill from Boufal on the right side to completely fool Gibbs, but 
then he slips at the wrong moment. Boufal’s been very good in this first half. 
Two added minutes.

43 min Reine-Adelaide tries to take on Martina, but he’s tackled cleanly. Good

39 min What an excellent goal from Ryan Bertrand. Saints won it in midfield, 
Boufal worried the full-back, and he slid it inside to Bertrand, who took a 
touch and fired it beyond Martinez. Clinical.

An excellent performance from Saints, and they go through to their first 
League Cup semi-final for 30 years. Arsenal, who made 10 changes, were dreadful 
in the first half, and that’s where the game was lost: Saints scored two on the 
counter-attack, and then defended strongly when Arsenal poured forward in the 
second half. Davis, Reed and Clasie in particular were excellent: they just 
stoppedArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> playing. 
Arsenal’s long wait for a League Cup trophy goes on.

Thanks for reading. Goodbye.

semi-finals!
 
90 min +3 Flicked across the six-yard box, but no one went for it! Coquelin’s 
shot is deflected. Another corner, which falls to Gibbs, who spanks it into 
orbit. That’s game over.
 
90 min +2 Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> win a corner,

89 min Still Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> come 
forward, but the impetus has rather slipped these past couple of minutes. This 
should be good enough for Saints.
 
88 min Ramsey bends one, but it’s well wide.

87 min Arsenal on the attack, but Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> break, and Sims does 
superbly by the touchline, but McQueen can’t apply the final touch! Hacked 
clear by Arsenal. Actually, Maitland-Niles did very well to stop it becoming 
3-0.
 
86 min In by Xhaka, headed back, and Holding couldn’t quite get there. Corner 
toArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, and Forster claims.
 
85 min Five minutes for the Gunners to save themselves. Everyone bar Martinez 
is in the Saints half, and Yoshida concedes a free kick 30 yards from goal.
 
84 min Good save from Martinez to deny Sims! Corner to Saints after another 
slick counter-attack.
 
83 min Another Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> corner. 
Heavy pressure from the hosts. Iwobi has a go after the first delivery is 
half-cleared, but it’s straight at Forster.
 
82 min Saints just rocking a little. Davis hacks clear. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> committing plenty of men 
forward, and they force a corner. Taken short, and Gibbs hits it, and Saints do 
just enough to clear. Another corner, this time punched clear by Forster.
 
81 min Lucas is booked for a late trip on Sims. Just looking back at that 
penalty claim, it was probably the right decision. Martina made slight contact, 
perhaps, but it would have been soft.
 
80 min And Yoshida hacks it off the line from Gibbs’s floating header! Now 
Ramsey goes down in the box, but Kevin Friend says no! SuddenlyArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have come alive.
 
79 min Oh, Oxlade-Chamberlain should have scored! Lovely touch inside from 
Perez, and Oxlade-Chamberlain is free in the box, but he fires it over! The 
clearest lookArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have had 
all night, and they couldn’t take it.

77 min David feeds McQueen, and goes for the return, but then lifts the shot 
over the crossbar! It came at him at a difficult height and couldn’t control 
the shot. Now Long goes clean through … and puts it wide! Oh, Shane! That was a 
golden chance for three. Will Saints live to regret that?!

76 min Still Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> can’t 
create that clear chance. Ramsey goes close, but it’s blocked.
 
75 min Martina and Sims combine nicely on the right touchline, but then the 
full-back’s touch lets him down, and it’s behind for a goal kick.
 
73 min Ramsey takes it nicely 30 yards from goal, but he slices his shot, and 
it’s a mile wide.
 
72 min Saints’ midfield trio have done very well to deny Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> space in the final third. 
There’s just no room for the hosts to work in.
 
71 min Mistake from Bertrand after Van Dijk went off on an upfield raid, but 
Forster does well to come out and clean up.
 
69 min Time running out for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. Still they haven’t really 
tested Forster, even though this second half has been much better.
 
66 min That sequence of three separate substitutions has just affected the 
momentum slightly.Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> back 
on the attack, but Saints defending stoutly. Coquelin with the shot from 20 
yards, but it’s wide.
 
65 min After that mild farce, it’s an Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> corner, which is headed clear by 
Long. And after all that, Saints make another change, with Josh Sims on for 
Sofiane Boufal.
 
64 min Harrison Reed is down. In the meantime, Maitland-Niles is on for Carl 
Jenkinson. Reed can’t continue, so Pierre-Emile Højbjerg is will come on. This 
is taking too long. Hurry up!
 
63 min Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> still 
look dangerous on the break, but Arsenal are at least showing some pep. Perez 
shoots, and it’s deflected over the bar. Corner.
 
62 min Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Reine-Adelaide.
 
60 min Coquelin has a go from 25 yards on his left foot, but it’s no problem 
for Forster, who saves easily.
 
59 min Oxlade-Chamberlain looks like he’s getting ready.
 
57 min McQueen with a chance! Martinez flapped at the corner, and McQueen 
struck it well, but just wide! Van Dijk took a knock in the melee but he’ll be 
OK.Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> close on two 
occasions.

56 min And now Boufal goes close! That was inches wide, and nearly cemented 
Saints’ place in the semis. It was deflected. Corner.
 
54 min Nearly three for Saints. McQueen and Martina combined down the right, 
but Martina couldn’t quite find Long with the cross, and Holding comes across 
to concede the corner, which is wasted.
 
52 min Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> win a free kick, 
and Xhaka hits it well, but it’s straight at Forster.

50 min Lucky Martinez! Long, was it, hit a fierce shot, and Martinez spilled 
it, but fortunately forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, 
it bobbled safe.
 
48 min Much better from Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>
. Lovely ball out wide to Jenkinson, and he finds Ramsey unmarked in the box, 
but he can’t quite get the connection, and it loops up into Forster’s arms. 
That’s more like it, though!
 
47 min Ramsey finds Perez in the box, and his shot is feeble, but it does 
count as an effort on target. Arsenal’s first.
 
46 min We’re back. No changes from either side at the break, although Xhaka is 
on for Elneny, who departed with an injury.
 
Some half-time emails.

Charles Antaki: “All very dismal. With Coquelin and Elneny about as creative 
and forward-looking as treacle, nothing much is going to come Pérez’s way. 
Which maybe just as well for his own sake, since he’s doing everything he can 
to persuade us that he won’t do much with it anyway.”

Mike Nichols: “Minus Cazorla, Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> always seem to err a little too 
much on the side of caution. There’s so much of an emphasis on keeping 
possession on their breaks versus hitting that pass to open up the defense or 
trying to hit an open runner.

“Too many sideways passes, especially with Coqneny at the wheel. I mean, I 
know Arsène wants to rest guys ahead of the Month of Death that December turns 
into, but they could use at least one more incisive player out there. “
 
What a superb display from Southampton, and what an abject one from Arsenal. 
The Gunners just haven’t got going at all – I don’t think they’ve had an effort 
on target.Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have 
sat deep, filled in the spaces, and counter-attacked briskly – and they’ve 
scored two excellent goals. Arsenal have serious work to do.

Back in 15 minutes!

And a moderate number of boos as the whistle blows.
 
45 min +2 Nearly another excellent break from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>, but Long’s touch let him 
down.
 
45 min Super skill from Boufal on the right side to completely fool Gibbs, but 
then he slips at the wrong moment. Boufal’s been very good in this first half. 
Two added minutes.
 
44 min On the bench, Arsène Wenger’s furrowed brow says plenty.
 
43 min Reine-Adelaide tries to take on Martina, but he’s tackled cleanly. Good 
defending.
 
42 min Elneny, who took a knock, can’t continue, and Xhaka is on.
 
41 min What an extremely accomplished first 40 minutes from the visitors. 
They’ve been happy to sit deep, let Arsenal have the ball, and hit on the 
counter. And they’ve done it brilliantly!Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have been dismal.
 
39 min What an excellent goal from Ryan Bertrand. Saints won it in midfield, 
Boufal worried the full-back, and he slid it inside to Bertrand, who took a 
touch and fired it beyond Martinez. Clinical.
 
Boufal did really well to find Bertrand, and his shot was precise! Saints two 
up!

38 min We still haven’t had an effort on the Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> goal. Arsenal just haven’t 
been very good.
