Jarvis Cocker, Andrew Marr <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> and 
Dame Joan Bakewell are among almost 40 BBC radio stars warning that a plan to 
commission 60% of the BBC’s radio content by competitive tender “sets 
bureaucracy over creativity”.

A BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> spokesman denied that the 
proposals, contained in the draft BBC charter and agreement, would in effect 
privatise much of the corporation’s radio production, saying that instead it 
would boost competition between independent production houses and the BBC’s 
in-house production teams.


Under the plans, BBC in-house production teams will compete against 
independent production houses to make programmes. The 60% requirement only 
applies to eligible hours, the BBC spokesman explained, saying news programmes, 
“talent-led” daytime programming on Radio 1 and 2, and some of Radio 4’s 
best-known programmes such asDesert Island Discs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/desert-island-discs> and The Archers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-archers> would not be affected. 

The proposal is based on an agreement between the BBC and the industry body the
Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> Independents Group, a culture 
department spokesman said.

The BBC stars, who come from across the corporation’s radio output, raised 
their concerns about the proposals in aletter to the Sunday Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/letters-to-the-editor-lrfxdxdnv>. 

In the past 20 years the BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> has 
gradually increased the proportion of content commissioned from external 
companies from zero to 20%. The open letter describes this as “a gradual rise 
that has fostered evolution while maintaining stability and allowing it to 
sustain its international reputation for excellence”.


But the draft BBC charter, which contains proposals to increase the proportion 
to three-fifths by 2022, would “threaten that excellence”, the letter states. 
The authors warn that it will add red tape and expense to the process of making 
radio content.

“This is poor value for money: the cost of commissioning-related 
administration will increase, but money spent on actual programmes will be cut, 
squeezing radio budgets that external and in-house producers already find 
barely adequate,” they write.

The letter continues: “It makes no sense to spend less on making programmes 
but more on the cost of commissioning them.”

Personalities from across the BBC’s radio output have lent their support to 
the letter.

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “The BBC’s 
model of commissioning content from independent producers has been shown to 
work very well. This will not change anything about what the listeners can 
expect from BBC radio. BBC commissioners make the final choice about what they 
want to appear on the BBC and who is best placed to make those shows.”

A BBC spokesman said: “The government’s draft charter has proposed greater 
competition in commissioning across the BBC, but our focus will always be on 
delivering the best programmes for audiences regardless of who makes them, 
while helping maintain both a thriving independent sector and a strong BBC 
production base.”
