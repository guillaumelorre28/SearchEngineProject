FATH: ‘The Man and the Dog’ (starts at 00:06) - Argentina

The music from the film Up always sets up viewers for an emotional 
rollercoaster and so it proves in this delightful Argentine film. We’ve 
identified the “brand” as FATH in the hope that this acronym doesn’t mean 
anything to you so that you can’t anticipate the lovely ending.

Vodafone: ‘Piggy Sue’ (starts at 01:42) - New Zealand

So we’ve had an emotional tale of one man and his dog ... how about an 
emotional tale of one man and his pig? This immensely sweet ad for Vodafone 
from New Zealand cleverly buries information about the usefulness of the mobile 
phone network’s service in a story about a lost piglet.

Aer Lingus: ‘Manifesto’ (starts at 03:16) - Ireland

This charming advert with a voiceover by Chris O’Dowd puts forward the 
argument that Ireland ought to provide a great airline because the Irish are 
blessed with “the travel gene”. Of course, the rain on this particular parade 
is Ryanair but if you try not to think about them (which is a good idea anyway) 
then you might find that this commercial sets out a very persuasive case.

Scrabble: ‘Anagram Lovers’ (starts at 04:00) - Spain

The ever-reliable game of Scrabble has been in the news recently over its 
controversial inclusion of modern words such as “newb”, “emoji”, and the 
28-point powerhouse “checkbox”. While aficionados of the game may be up in arms 
about the addition of these etymological cuckoos, they’ll adore this 
anagrammatic tale of love across the tiles.

YouTube: ‘The A-Z of YouTube’ (starts at 05:22) - UK

This arresting film pays tribute to YouTube on its 10th birthday and it does a 
terrific job of drawing our attention to a whole host of highlights from the 
video platform. Even casual users of the site will be surprised by how many of 
these ring a bell and that – by itself – underlines the place they now occupy 
on the cultural map.
