The total value of all bitcoins in circulation hit a record high above $14bn 
(£11bn) on Thursday, as the web-based digital currency jumped 5% to its highest 
levels in three years after more than doubling in price this year.

The price of one bitcoin reached $875 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, 
its strongest level since January 2014, putting the cryptocurrency on track for 
its best daily performance in six months.

That compared with levels around $435 at the start of the year, with many 
experts linking bitcoin’s rise with the steady depreciation of the Chinese 
yuan, which has slid almost 7% in 2016.

Data shows the majority of bitcoin trading is done in China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>, so any increase in demand from there 
tends to have a significant impact on the price.

The web-based bitcoin currency can move money across the globe quickly and 
anonymously with no need for a central authority. That makes it attractive to 
those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China’s.

The currency is still some way off the peaks it scaled in late 2013, when it 
traded as high as $1,163 on the Bitstamp exchange.

But because more bitcoins continue to be added to the system, currently at a 
rate of 12.5 every 10 minutes, its total value – or “market cap” – on Thursday 
surpassed the 2013 peak of $14.01bn. That puts its total value at about the 
same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.

Charles Hayter, the founder of data analysis website CryptoCompare 
<https://www.cryptocompare.com/>, said bitcoin had been helped higher by 
demonetisation in India

, and by global political uncertainty.

“If that trend continues, bitcoin is a good thematic play on the fracturing of 
our global norms as a flight to safety,” he said.
