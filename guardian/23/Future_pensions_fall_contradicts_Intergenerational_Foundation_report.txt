Whatever the merits of the other conclusions drawn by the Intergenerational 
Foundation <http://www.if.org.uk/> in its report on the balance between 
generations, they are completely incorrect to assert that public sector 
pensions are “overwhelming young people’s prospects” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/14/uk-younger-generation-pensions-bill-report>
, 15 August). The latestlong-term projections 
<http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/49753_OBR-Fiscal-Report-Web-Accessible.pdf>
 from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the cost of public sector 
pensions is projected to fall consistently in the future as a result of recent 
reforms to the schemes. The estimated cost of the main public sector schemes in 
2014-15 was 2.1% of GDP and this is forecast to fall to 1.5% of GDP in 2044-45 
and 1.2% in 2054-55; these schemes are becoming more affordable, not more of a 
burden.
