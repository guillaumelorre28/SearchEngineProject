European financial centres will not enjoy “easy pickings” after Brexit should 
businesses decide to leave, the head of theLondon Stock Exchange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup> has said.


Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the LSE Group, hailed London as 
unparalleled in its provision of services and raising capital, whether for 
projects in China, India or European small and medium-sized businesses.

However, the next port of call for companies seeking to leave post-Brexit 
would not be Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, but New York, as it was the only 
other global financial centre that could centrally and efficiently clear all 17 
major currencies, he said.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph

, Rolet said: “The UK financial ecosystem, with clearing at its heart, makes 
London the most economically attractive and stable destination for global 
investors and issuers. It is no longer just a few banks transacting individual 
products but the innovative home of global finance.”

Leaving the UK could cost firms tens of billions of dollars and that would 
also take money from the European real economy, warned the Frenchman, who was 
appointed head of the exchange in 2009.


Rolet called for entrepreneurs to be at the centre of the post-Brexit 
industrial strategy. “This ecosystem must be championed and protected. The best 
way is to secure continued regulatory equivalence with the EU, membership of 
which also provides equivalency with the US,” he said.

“But people in Europe and the UK should realise this isn’t a zero-sum game. If 
business leaves the UK, the European economy would suffer – and very little of 
that business is likely to go to Europe anyway.”
