I hadn’t had sex in years before meeting my current partner. I helped her 
through an abusive situation, but I don’t feel confident in my sexual 
abilities. I feel as if I will never measure up to the primal alpha male that 
abused her. I’m not sure I can role-play the kind of things she wants, but we 
really seem to love each other.

She is drawn to you because she feels safe with you, which actually makes you 
the alpha protector. But be careful. It sounds as though her sexual style might 
lead her to try to push you beyond your limits. Sexual creativity is usually a 
good thing, but you don’t have to like everything, even if it seems adventurous 
and your partner asks you to try it. If it’s too much, just say “no”.

Sometimes abuse survivors have difficulty understanding limits and what is 
consensual, because their own boundaries have been violated. Sometimes they 
desire to act out violent or abusive situations for unhealthy reasons. She may 
unconsciously will you to behave in a way that you will come to regret.

Stay aware, and listen to your own self-protective voice. And don’t fret about 
sexual confidence; it’s not about steaming ahead with a preordained sexual 
plan. It is simply the courage to explore, ask and learn what truly gives 
physical pleasure to a partner, and be willing to share your own desires with 
her.
