Shares in takeaway specialist Just Eat are as popular as a stale curry despite 
the company increasing its earnings guidance for the year.

It said like for like orders in the third quarter rose 34%, with more than 80% 
coming from mobile devices. So it now expects full year earnings of £109m to 
£111m, up from a previous estimate of £106m to £108m.

But its shares have dropped 19p or more than 3% to 542p, partly because UK 
order growth is slowing, up 28% compared to a 50% rise a year ago.

In a sell note, analysts at UBS also said the 34% rise in orders was below the 
consensus of 36%. They added:

Over 30% of UK orders are now being processed on Just Eat’s Orderpad platform. 
This seems to be ahead of expectations (July’s target was for a third of orders 
by year-end).

[The change in guidance] is slightly unusual since the previous guidance was 
set in July, before the extent of the UK’s warm and dry summer was known.

The stock has been strong into today’s numbers. Group order growth came in 
below consensus and the new high-end of EBITDA guidance is in-line with 
consensus so we would expect to see some selling pressure today.

Elsewhere JD Wetherspoon is now the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, down 55.5p 
to 832.5p after the pubs group said trading had slowed in recent weeks and c
hairman Tim Martin warned it could stop selling European drinks brands if EU 
leaders maintained a “bullying” approach to Brexit negotiations.
