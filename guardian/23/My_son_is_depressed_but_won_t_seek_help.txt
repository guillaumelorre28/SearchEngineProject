My 21-year-old son has been depressed since October, but refuses to get 
therapy. I saw his GP, but was told that, as he is 21, he should seek 
self-referral. At that time, he had just had a breakdown and was crying 
uncontrollably. He has since been a shadow of himself, has no appetite and in 
the evenings feels restless and tired. He is not on any medication. He has cut 
out his friends and feels uneasy when we go to any function other than church. 
He has lost interest in most things in life. There are just the two of us and 
it is beginning to take its toll on me. I have tried to talk him into therapy 
or counselling, but he insists he is fine. He is due back at university in 
January and I do not want him to lose his place.
