 The proposal to unseat Blanco, who became mayor of Cuernavaca in December,

 Since the 43-year-old took over the colonial city of 350,000, opponents have 
questioned his attendance record at city hall meetings and his political 
experience, saying advisers make decisions on his behalf.

 “He might be a good man but he is not qualified to rule,” said constitutional 
lawyer Raul Carranca, who filed the impeachment petition before the state’s 
legislature.

 Blanco, who played for Club America and the Chicago Fire and had a spell with 
Real Valladolid in Europe, played at three World Cups and is Mexico’s second 
leading scorer of all time, with 38 goals.

Off the field, he made headlines for his hot temper, including a 2007 incident 
in which he was filmed hitting a Mexican sports journalist.

 Carranca has also alleged that Blanco cannot adequately prove his residency 
in Cuernavaca.

Speaking by telephone from Cuernavaca, where he began his protest at dawn, 
Blanco told Reuters elements of the trial were baseless.

 “What they’re doing is outrageous,” Blanco said. His hunger strike, he added, 
would continue indefinitely.
