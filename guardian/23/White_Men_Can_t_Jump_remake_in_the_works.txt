The original starred Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as con artists who fool 
basketball players about Harrelson’s character’s lack of ability. It was a 
sleeper hit, grossing $90m worldwide, and wasa surprise favorite film

 of the acclaimed film-maker Stanley Kubrick.

Since Black-ish became a breakout hit for Barris, scooping up Emmy nominations 
and a recent Golden Globes win for its star Tracee Ellis Ross, he has also 
written the forthcoming comedy Girl Trip, starring Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen 
Latifah and Regina Hall, and is set to bring Shaft to the screen once again.

Griffin plays basketball for the Los Angeles Clippers – though he is currently 
sidelined with a knee injury – while Kalil is an NFL player for the Carolina 
Panthers. The pair now own a production banner called Mortal Media. They are 
also working on a remake of the action adventure The Rocketeer, centered around 
a black female protagonist.
