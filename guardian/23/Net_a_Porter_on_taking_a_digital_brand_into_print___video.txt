Speaking at the Guardian Changing Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/changing-media-summit> 2016, Tess 
Macleod-Smith, vice president, publishing and media, Net-a-Porter and Lucy 
Yeomans, editor-in-chief of Porter magazine and global content director, 
Net-a-Porter, discuss the launch of the Porter magazine.

They explain that market research found their customers still loved print. As 
a digital-first company, it was a great opportunity to create the physical 
embodiment of the brand, connecting the dots between print and digital. Each 
page of the magazine is shoppable by scanning pages from your phone, designed 
to appeal to cash-rich, time-poor women.
