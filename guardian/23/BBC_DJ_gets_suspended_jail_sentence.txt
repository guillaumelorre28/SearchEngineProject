The BBC radio DJ Andy Kershaw <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-kershaw> 
was today given a three-month suspended jail sentence for breaching a 
restraining order keeping him away from his former partner.

Sentencing Kershaw at the Isle of Man courts of justice, High Bailiff Michael 
Moyle said he did not want to make him a "martyr".

The former Radio 1 presenter, who now has a show on Radio 3, last month 
admitted to breaching the order after being arrested close to the home of 
Juliette Banner, the mother of his two children.

He today admitted drink-driving, and was banned for 16 months.

The 48-year-old had moved from London to the town of Peel with Ms Banner and 
their children in April last year. However, the couple separated and Ms Banner, 
along with their children, aged eight and nine, moved in with another man.

At the beginning of August, she was granted a restraining order against 
Kershaw, banning him from approaching her or Jim Imrie, her new partner. 
Kershaw was arrested close to her new home on August 29, spending six days in 
custody.

Speaking outside last month's hearing, he said: "I've lost my kids, I've lost 
the woman I love, I've lost everything. It's a very difficult time for me. I 
just want peace and quiet."

Nigel Cordwell, defending Kershaw, today said his client was "a man struggling 
to come to terms with personal tragedy".

Kershaw, originally from Rochdale, Manchester, moved to London in 1984 and 
worked as Billy Bragg's driver and roadie before being hired by the BBC.

He has presented a world music programme on Radio 3 since 2001, but it is not 
known whether he will return to the show.
