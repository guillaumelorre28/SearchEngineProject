We start this week with a stonker of a video that has had nearly 30m views. 
Look Up's gentle love story <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY&sns=em>
 might aim to persuade you to stop concentrating on your mobile phone, but it 
has taken the online world by storm and has been shared widely across social 
media.

Sharing opinions – or trading insults – is the theme of our second clip, which 
shows The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes going head to head with Breaking Bad's 
Walter White foran epic rap battle <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQHQvtIr6w>
.

We've got a couple of big names letting their hair down this week: Kevin 
Spacey joins Jimmy Fallon and the Ragtime Gals fora rendition of Jason Derulo's 
hit song Talk Dirty <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hHhELPERm4> and Andrew 
Garfield makeshis public performance as a singer/guitarist  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8GLoDHZMZQ>with the theme from The Amazing 
Spider-man 2.

It's the final of Eurovision on Saturday, so we end on a flashback to the 2009 
winner, Alexander Rybak from Norway 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiH4BFTELME>, a video that has been watched 
more than 56m times. Enjoy!
