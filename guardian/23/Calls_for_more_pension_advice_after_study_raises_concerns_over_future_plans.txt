More than half of people who have taken money out under pension freedoms have 
not planned for future care costs, a new study shows.

A survey of 500 people who have accessed their pension since April 2015 
revealed that just one in six has budgeted for the cost of care as they grow 
older.

Citizens Advice said its research found that three fifths have not thought 
about how they will pay for care costs, with one in 10 hoping to rely on their 
family or the government.

Local authorities should offer online or face-to-face services to help people 
plan for the future, said the report.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Care costs can be a 
heavy financial burden that many people are unprepared for.

“It is unsurprising that many people in their fifties are not thinking about 
how they will pay for care costs when the need for this could be 10, 20 or even 
30 years away. But this issue does need some attention, otherwise people risk 
dipping into their pension now only to find they need some of the money later.

“Getting the right guidance is key in helping people think about and plan how 
they will fund their retirement, including costs which are more tricky to 
consider, such as care fees.

“There is also an opportunity for local authorities to help people plan ahead 
for future care costs, by providing clear information about how funding for 
care works and how much it costs.”
