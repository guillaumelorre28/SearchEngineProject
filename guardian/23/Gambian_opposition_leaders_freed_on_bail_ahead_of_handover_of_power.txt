along with 18 other political prisoners following an electionthat unseated one 
of Africa’s most autocratic leaders

 after 22 years of rule.

A courtroom packed with supporters cheered and stood to sing the national 
anthem as Ousainou Darboe, the leader of the United Democratic party, was 
allowed to go home after eight months in Banjul’s notorious Mile Two prison.

On his way into court Darboe, looking much thinner than when he was imprisoned 
in April, said he felt “great”, adding that he would forgive president Yahya 
Jammeh, who on Friday conceded the election to Adama Barrow,a former Argos 
security guard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/adama-barrow-gambia-president-argos-security-guard-london>
 and estate agent who took over Darboe’s party when the latter was jailed.

“Nelson Mandela has been a role model to me,” a smiling Darboe told the 
Guardian. He said he had done a lot of meditation in jail and that it helped 
him forgive Jammeh for what he had done to him.

“It’s a new Gambia,” Darboe said. “I congratulate President Jammeh for 
accepting defeat. That is acting with maturity. I have respect for him. I would 
never address him as a crazy man and I never would address him as an evil man.”

Under Jammeh’s tenure, many opposition members, journalists and activists have 
been jailed, tortured and arrested. Some have died, including Solo Sandeng,
whose death triggered the protests

 in which Darboe and the others were arrested.

The UDP is the biggest party in the new coalition that is due to take over 
from Jammeh in January, and Darboe will almost certainly have one of the top 
jobs in government.

The prisoners, who had been led into court in handcuffs by riot police, were 
mostly old men dressed in simple tunics. They had all been beaten when they 
were arrested for protesting peacefully in April; one lost the sight in his eye.

Police in flak jackets and black gloves stood by them, as riot police 
surrounded the court of appeal, armed with guns and grenades. Outside the 
court, the streets were filled with cheering Gambians who left work to welcome 
Darboe.

Darboe’s wife Maya rushed towards him when he entered the courtroom and hugged 
him, in tears. Nafi, his daughter, said: “It’s like a dream. It’s surreal that 
this whole thing is over.”

Jammeh is thought to still be in the Gambia, though he has not appeared 
publicly since accepting defeat in a televised phone call with Barrow.

The celebrations have been constant since Barrow won, triggering the small 
west African country’sfirst ever democratic transfer of power

.

Darboe said: “President Jammeh has never won an election in this country, he 
has only rigged them. He calls himself a democrat, so I think he has no choice 
but to accept the result of the elections.”

Antouman Gaye, the prisoners’ lawyer, asked the judge for bail and said that 
it was in the public interest for the case to be thrown out and Darboe and his 
colleagues freed.

“We cannot with all due respect bury our respective heads in the sand and 
pretend there are no exceptional circumstances. This must come to a stop,” he 
said, before quoting Lord Denning,the celebrated English judge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/06/claredyer1>: “I know your ladyships 
and lordship. When I look at you I see bold spirits, not timorous souls.”

The Darboe family griot, or storyteller, stood up in court, loudly singing the 
praises of the lawyers in his red cap and yellow robe. After the ruling, Gaye 
said that it was “a vindication of the country’s democratisation process, which 
has just begun”.

He called for “a total overhaul of the judicial system” in the Gambia.

Eleven of the 19 prisoners are members of the UDP executive, and lawyer Amie 
Bensouda said that they were needed to lead the democratic transition.

“The transition period is a short one and the leadership of the UDP have a 
crucial role to play in this process,” she said. “They will not be able to do 
so unless this court grants them bail today. Every day counts.”

The director of public prosecutions did not oppose the bail application.

“I do not have much to say because there’s not much to be said. The practice 
in the court of appeal is always to entertain bail application formally,” Hadi 
Saleh Barkum said, denying that there was anything unusual about this.

“It’s normal. There’s nothing strange, it’s all great,” he said.

While they are the most prominent, the 19 prisoners in court were not the only 
ones jailed under Jammeh, according to Sabrina Mahtani from Amnesty 
International.

“This is a really joyful moment for the detainees and their families,” said 
Mahtani. “We need to remember that there are still many more people still in 
prison for voicing their opinions or being perceived as opponents to the regime 
and there are people who have disappeared who we still don’t know anything 
about.”
