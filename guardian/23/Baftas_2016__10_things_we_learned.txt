Stephen Fry has carved out his place as a popular Baftas host – at least for 
those at Bafta, as he’s now been doing it for 15 years. His one-liners have 
magically managed to avoid offence, which also makes him well-liked by the 
celebrity attendees. But this year,one particular lol turned into more of an 
omfg on Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/stephen-fry-hits-back-at-criticism-of-baftas-bag-lady-joke-she-got-it-derrr>
.

After costume designer Jenny Beavan accepted her award for Mad Max: Fury Road, 
Fry compared her outfit to that of a “bag lady” causing much anger on social 
media. But Fry hit back, referring to those who criticised him as 
“sanctimonious fuckers” who should “fuck the fuck off”. On the plus side, it’s 
the closest thing we had to drama this year.On Monday morning, he appeared to 
have deleted his account.

Julie Walters is queen of the clips

For her “female giddiness” outburst playing the cantankerous landlady Mrs 
Kehoe in Brooklyn. So rarely do clips deliver — briefly and in essence — the 
nature of a performance. Clips tend to cut people off midflow, leaving you 
baffled. But this clip gives you the microcosm.

It’s just long enough to be satisfying and amusing. It lets Walters shine; it 
showcases that tasty Irish accent, it lets her play off the younger actors but 
utterly upstages them and then she gets to finish the clip herself by banging 
the table. Enough! That clip has played every talk show and award show. It is 
pure clip perfection.

In recent years, the Oscars have tried to create more and more viral moments, 
in line with the tireless talk show tradition of clinically engineering easily 
shared rofls on a daily basis. This year, the Baftas tried to do their own with 
a rather bizarre take on the US sports tradition of the “kiss cam” as Fry tried 
to get various celebrity pair ups to make out on the big screen.

While Maggie Smith and Leonardo DiCaprio played along, actual real life couple 
Michael Fassbender <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> and 
Alicia Vikander refused to showcase their love and, given the awkwardness that 
ensued, the moment was culled from the telecast (though a fleeting reference 
remained). This failed attempt at “doing a viral” now makes Baftas the MySpace 
of awards ceremonies.


EE equals an EEK: this year’s red carpet was a dead feed

Before the ceremony had even begun, the biggest Bafta fail of the year had 
already happened – for two whole hair-pulling hours. This year, the idea was to 
show the red carpet arrivals via a live stream on YouTube. A great idea on 
paper but on actual tech, a rather horrendous one. The video was mostly 
unwatchable, cutting out, buffering and annoying pretty much anyone trying to 
watch, even sometime Bafta red carpet interviewerEdith Bowman 
<https://twitter.com/edibow/status/698935941969350656?lang=en-gb>. 
edith bowman (@edibow) 
Anyone else having problems with the @BAFTA <https://twitter.com/BAFTA> live 
stream? Xx

<https://twitter.com/edibow/status/698935941969350656> 
The most embarrassing element is that the ceremony’s sponsor is EE, whose 4G 
brags now seem even more far-fetched. Somewhere online, we hope Kevin Bacon is 
being personally blamed and ruthlessly trolled for this.

You know it’s a quiet night for controversy when Julie Walters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/julie-walters> mislaying an earring makes 
headlines, but then again, this was no ordinary earring. It was a diamond 
dangler worth “about the same price as my house” – and it is now missing in 
action. “As I got up on stage,” reported Walters, “I realised one of them was 
not there.” Walters then reiterated the property comparison saying: “Somebody’s 
found a bit of it, but even that it probably worth more than my house, so I 
need to look around.”

Without intimate knowledge of the value of Julie Walters’s house we can’t be 
sure exactly how much money we’re talking, but we do fear she has likely tipped 
off whoever might have been about to hand it into lost property they’d be 
advised not to do so. Plus, although Walters does look considerably paler 
following the loss, she also looks much more relaxed and gangster.

From Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday shoutout to his mum, who he remembers 
driving him three hours a day out of his rough east LA neighbourhood “to a 
different school, to show me a different opportunity”, to Alejandro González 
Iñárritu’s emotional tribute to his dad on the second anniversary of his death, 
this was a ceremony at which those parental influences loomed large, 
particularly in The Revenant camp. (This was doubtless a shoot to make you 
hanker for home.)

Less parental accord was found in the case of Amy, whose best documentary win 
prompted this from Mitch Winehouse:
mitch winehouse (@mitchwinehouse) 
Please don't congratulate me on the Amy film winning BAFTA. This is a one 
dimensional, miserable and misleading portrayal of Amy.

 Heart going on … Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Photograph: David

It was a big night for Titanic fans whose last Jack and Rose reunion was the 
rather un-romantic Revolutionary Road, a film about a couple ripping each other 
apart and destroying their dreams. Tonight saw both Kate and Leo win awards and 
their brief moments together were savoured by those who were still sore about 
that floating door 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/02/kate-winslet-breaks-silence-on-titanic-raft-ending-he-could-have-actually-fit>
. DiCaprio referred to Winslet as his “homegirl”, the pair “grabbed hands” as 
she accepted her Bafta and, perhaps most heartbreakingly, she saidhe didn’t 
even care 
<http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a783486/baftas-2016-kate-winslet-says-leonardo-dicaprio-really-doesnt-care-about-the-door-from-titanic/>
 about whether Jack could have squeezed onto the floating door or not. Which is 
a very Frank and April thing to say.

Rebel Wilson wins (or loses) but probably wins

Rebel Wilson makes fun of Oscars diversity row in show-stealing Baftas speech – 
video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/15/rebel-wilsons-makes-fun-of-oscars-diversity-row-in-show-stealing-baftas-speech-video>
In a night dripping with lukewarm contributions to the diversity debate, Rebel 
Wilson’s hat-trick of envelope-pushing really made an impact. Item one: Wilson 
saying “I’ve been practising my transgender face” so she can win future Baftas. 
Item two (praising Bafta’s drive to increase its mix of voters): “And that’s 
what we all wanna see in life, isn’t it – diverse members.” And item three, on 
Idris Elba making her nervous: “I’m sociologically programmed to want chocolate 
on Valentine’s Day.”


In 20 seconds flat, Wilson had cemented her place as this year’s comedy 
saviour or foul-mouthed bigot, depending on your point of view.

Often wheeled out to announce the winner of a major award at various 
ceremonies, this year Tom Cruise was called upon to reveal what would be named 
best film. But, despite his experience in this very specific field, his 
envelope-opening shtick is always disappointingly strait-laced. While virtually 
every presenter before him had a sometimes clumsily-written skit to perform, 
Cruise was joyless and alone. On Valentine’s Day too. Most of the Twitter chat 
was of the Renee Zellweger variety with MSP Ruth Davidson likening him to“

While Carol’s best picture omission at the Oscars was seen by some as an 
out-and-out snub, it entered this year’s Bafta race as a frontrunner, with nine 
nominations. But by the time Stephen Fry had made his last joke, it emerged 
with a grand total of zero awards. The night belonged to films fronted by men, 
from Leonardo DiCaprio’s chilly obstacle course The Revenant to Tom Hardy’s 
dusty chase thriller Mad Max: Fury Road. Best supporting awards also went to 
Mark Rylance in Bridge of Spies andKate Winslet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/katewinslet> in Steve Jobs, both centred 
around male characters. #BaftasSoSexist?
