<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/braconid-british-world-scrabble-champion-181-point-word>
 beat fellow Briton Mark Nyman with this perfectly obscure, delightful Scrabble 
specimen. How does it contend with other championship Scrabble moves?

Quetzals (365) Guatemala’s national bird and one of its monetary units.
In 1986, Cathy Evans, from Essex, won the highest-ever score for a single move 
during the Letchworth Open Scrabble Tournament. This one is all about 
placement, using all seven letters of your rack, with Q and S on a triple word 
score and Z on a double letter.

Quixotry (365) a visionary idea or scheme.
Stretching the word between two triple word squares, Michael Cresta made 
Scrabble history in 2006during a game in a church basement between a carpenter 
and a deli worker 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/gaming/2006/10/830.html>. Cresta’s 
final score of 830 remains the greatest number of points held in a game by a 
single player.

Caziques (392) Caribbean tribal chiefs or a black and red or black and yellow 
tropical birds.
Karl Khoshnaw set the record for the highest single word score in a 1982 
competition in England with this, played across two triple word squares.

Flatfish (239) any fish of the order Heterosomata (Pleuronectiformes), 
including halibut, sole, flounder.
Another Cresta triple-triple from that hallowed 2006 tournament. This one was 
unusual because it contains infrequently occurring letters – two Fs and an H.

Muzjiks (126) Russian peasants.
The highest possible opening move score in Scrabble, played by Jesse Inman at 
the 2008 National Scrabble Championship in Orlando

At the UK National Scrabble Championships in 2010 Mikki Nicholson 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11662754>’s highest score may have been for 
UPDATES (105), but COTHURNI was a more pleasing example ofScrabble 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/21/official-scrabble-book-adds-lotsa-ridic-new-words>
 skullduggery, played by a champion who had only turned to the tiles five years 
earlier.

Felty (36) resembling felt.
It is only worth 36 points and looks a little made up, but it’s a historic 
Scrabble word nonetheless for being the winning one in the 2015 World 
Championship final, when Nigeria’sWellington Jighere became the first African 
to win the title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/09/nigerias-wellington-jighere-almost-lost-for-words-after-scrabble-world-title-triumph>
. “It was a battle between one man and a whole continent,” Jighere wrote on his 
Facebook page after the victory.

Oxyphenbutazone (1778) Anti-inflammatory medication used to treat arthritis 
and bursitis.
OK, it has never actually been played but it’s thought to be the highest 
scoring word possible under American Scrabble rules
