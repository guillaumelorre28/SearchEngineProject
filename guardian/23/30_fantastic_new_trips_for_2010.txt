Ski in Eastern Europe
European ski resorts are seeing some fantastic powder, but those on a tight 
budget should consider heading east, taking advantage of new flights from 
Danube Wings launched last month. They link Luton, Manchester and Dublin to 
Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia, which is less than an hour's drive from Jasna, the 
country's largest resort and with a growing off-piste reputation.
• Flights to Poprad-Tatry with Danube Wings (danubewings.com 
<http://www.danubewings.com>) cost from £150. For accommodation information see 
jasna.sk <http://www.tatry.net/accommodation/>

Get Spiritual in India
Kumbh Mela is the biggest religious gathering on the planet, held four times 
every 12 years in places of spiritual significance. In 2010 it is at Haridwar, 
at the foot of the Himalayas in the state of Uttarakhand, beginning on Thursday 
and running until 28 April. Millions will come to bathe in the Ganges, float 
lamps in the river and take part in celebrations. It will be an incredible 
spectacle, but can be chaotic, so it's best to join an organised tour.
• For more information see kumbh2010haridwar.gov.in

February

Take the family to the Seychelles
The Seychelles have a (fairly accurate) reputation for high-end glamour – and 
prices. But the Ephelia Resort (epheliaresort.com <http://www.epheliaresort.com>
), which opens this month, aims to change all that: the four-star resort is 
ideal for families, with four swimming pools, two stunning beaches and a daily 
children's club. The hotel also has its own Padi dive centre and is on Mahe 
island, so no onward internal flights are needed. Best of all are the 
spectacular opening offers: a week half-board costs £1,249 with flights.

Check into a snow hole
Ice hotels are so last decade; this year the winter accommodation of choice is 
the snow hole, thanks to a new trip offered by the Torridon Hotel in the 
Scottish Highlands. The downside is that you have to dig it yourself before 
spending the night there. Heading out from the hotel in the company of mountain 
guide Chris Wilson, you will be shown how to tunnel into a slope, digging out a 
corridor and a room with sleeping platforms. The experience costs £325 
half-board, including a night either side at the hotel, available on 5-7 
February or 5-7 March.
• Book on 0800 089 3929; prideofbritainhotels.com

See the Winter Olympics
The Winter Olympics kick off on 13 February, but with accommodation in 
Whistler, Canada (where the downhill skiing events take place) either already 
booked or going for stratospherically high prices, the best plan is to base 
yourself in Vancouver. The resort of Cypress Mountain (cypressmountain.com 
<http://cypressmountain.com>) is just half an hour away from the city, so is 
perfect for day trips, and the freestyle skiing and snowboard half-pipe events 
are taking place there, so there will be plenty of atmosphere and Olympic buzz 
to enjoy.

March

Go out on the toonn
Spring is ideal time for a city break, and Newcastle offers an unbeatable mix 
of festivals and attractions in March. If it's a family weekend, older kids 
will love the ScienceFest (12-21 March; newcastlesciencefest.co.uk), with 
exhibitions at museums throughout the city, and the AV Festival (5-14 March;
avfest.co.uk <http://www.avfestival.co.uk>) of electronic arts. One of the 
biggest events will be the illumination of Hadrian's Wall on 13 March (
hadrians-wall.org <http://www.hadrians-wall.org/>), when 500 gas-fired braziers 
will light the wall from end to end.

Party in the snow
Forget summer festivals, these days it's all about partying in the snow. This 
year sees the brand new Big Snow Festival in Arinsal, Andorra, from 14-21 
March, with headliners including DJs Calvin Harris and Eddie Halliwell, and 
sets from Judge Jules and Micky Finn. Snowbombing, the original and biggest ski 
and music festival, runs from 5-10 April in Mayrhofen, Austria, and this year 
will be headlined by Fatboy Slim, who pulled out last year after checking into 
rehab.

April

Learn Dualie surfing 
For many, April is the start of the surfing season, but if you're unsure of 
your board technique, consider hiring a "Dualie" board. The latest trend in 
surfing, Dualies are bodyboards for two, so you can take to the water with a 
partner or friend, and younger kids can surf safely with Mum or Dad. Extreme 
Academy in Watergate Bay hires out Dualie boards; the Watergate Bay Hotel has a 
family room (sleeping five) from £245, with dinner and breakfast.

Go nuts for cocoa
Hotel Chocolat is a high-street chain of chocolate shops, but this year it is 
making good its name and opening a real hotel. The six room Real Hotel Chocolat 
is on the Caribbean island of St Lucia, on the 140-acre Rabot Estate, a working 
cocoa plantation from which the shop sources its supplies. Guests can learn how 
cocoa is processed and, of course, have a tasting (or two) of the chocolate 
produced. Room rates are still being finalised.

bloom, with the Floralies, a 10-day celebration of flowers, with displays, 
exhibitions, talks and contemporary floral art around the city. The Floralies 
has been held for more than 200 years, and in 2010 over 300 florists, designers 
and landscape gardeners will contribute to the festival.

real backdrops to the books and film on a new tour from Trek America which has

celebrations, there is a new way to reach Turkey – in serious style. The Danube 
Express luxury train is launching a new eight-day London-Istanbul itinerary, 
setting off from St Pancras and taking in Budapest, Prague, Transylvania and 
rural Bulgaria before reaching Istanbul on day six. You have two days to

One of the glitziest cities on the planet, Shanghai ups the ante in May when 
it launches the Shanghai World Expo, running from 1 May-31 October. The theme 
is Better City Better Life, and there will be 12 pavilions spread over a five 
square kilometre site, with dozens of countries exhibiting and taking part. It

June 

Live the longest day
Make the most of the longest day of the year (21 June) with a trip to 
Gothenburg in Sweden, where at this time of year the sun never really quite 
sets and a three-day break can feel like a week. An added bonus is that a 
recently discovered painting by Leonardo da Vinci, La Bella Principessa, will 
be on display for the first time as part of the city's "And There Was Light" 
exhibition (and-there-was-light.com <http://and-there-was-light.com/>), which 
brings together works by Michelangelo, Raphael and da Vinci.

football World Cup. Games will be played in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and 
Cape Town, with the final taking place on 11 July in Johannesburg. Some 
operators still have packages available, with tickets: Emirates Tours has a

July 

A rare Spanish fiesta
The Spanish love their festivals, and one that only happens every few years is 
inevitably going to be a pretty big deal. "Xacobeo" is a holy year that happens 
every time the feast of Saint James – 25 July – falls on a Sunday. The next, 
after this summer, will be 2021. The northern cities will be filled with 
pilgrims on the route to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, because in a holy 
year can they pass through the Puerto del Perdon – a door into the cathedral at 
Santiago which is bricked up at other times; all who pass through the door have 
their sins pardoned.
• For accommodation and more information see turgalicia.es

The 41st Passion Play
It only happens once a decade and you won't recognise the names of any of the 
actors, but thePassion Play in Oberammergau, Bavaria, is one of the biggest 
theatrical events in the world. The production runs from 15 May until 3 
October, but the long July evenings are the perfect time to see it: the play 
begins at 2.30pm and doesn't finish until 10.30pm (there is a three-hour 
interval). All the participants – up to 900 in the crowd scenes – must have 
lived in the village for at least 20 years.

Centenary train ride
Soaring to more than 2,100m, the Bernina Pass in Switzerland is one of the 
world's most spectacular stretches of railway, and this year celebrates its 
100th anniversary. The lush pastures of the Swiss mountains under clear July 
skies are best seen through picture windows on a leisurely train journey.

August

Outback cattle drive
Cattle drives across the vast landscapes of southern Australia are no small 
undertaking, but the Great Australian Outback Cattle Drive, from 30 July-20 
August is set to be really special. The event is a recreation of old-style 
drives, and involves a 320-mile journey along the Oodnadatta Track with around 
500 cattle and 120 horses.

Tall ships race
Hartlepool is set to host its biggest ever party when up to 100 tall ships 
sail into its harbour on 7 August to bring to a close the second and final Tall 
Ships race for 2010. The ships will have set off from the Norwegian port of 
Kristiansand on 1 August and will remain docked in Hartlepool for three nights. 
There will be street parties, live music and celebrations throughout the town

to sea.

Get to know Zimbabwe
The new decade may, one hopes, mean a fresh start for Zimbabwe. The country is 
cautiously opening up to tourism again, and South African tour company 
Wilderness Safaris is offering tours that start and end in Zambia, but dip into 
Zimbabwe's fabulous wildlife parks – such as Mana Pools – which see virtually 
no visitors. The Foreign Office does not currently advise against travelling to 
Zimbabwe, and going with an experienced guide is the safest way.
• The trip costs from £2,173, including flights, transfers and accommodation, 
booked through Expert Africa (020 8232 9777;expertafrica.com

October

Untrodden India
The state of Gujarat in north-western India is something of a revelation even 
to those who think they know India well. It's scattered with pristine marble 
temples, rural villages and 1,600km of coastline. Wild Frontiers is introducing 
Gujarat for the first time in 2010, with a tour including the state capital, 
Ahmedabad, and the historic towns of Poshina and Bhuj.

October, when the Ryder Cup takes place at the Celtic Manor Resort near 
Newport. There is no substitute for being there, but you have to be lucky:

towering mountains and unspoilt beaches make it a great place for a walking 
holiday. HF Holidays includes Montenegro in its programme for the first time 
this year, and October is an ideal month for enjoying the Lovcen National Park, 
breathtaking Kotor Bay and ancient trails around Lake Skadar.

November

Eat Heston's cooking
Tired of trying (and failing) to get a reservation at the Fat Duck? The good 
news is that in November Heston Blumenthal opens his first restaurant in 
London, at the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge. Even better, the restaurant 
seats 140, so the chances of sampling Blumenthal's legendarily eccentric take 
on classic British dishes should be relatively high.

The 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution falls on 20 November, when 
Pancho Villa and other insurgents led the country to freedom, and Mexico is 
planning to celebrate the centenary in typically vivacious style. The tourist 
office has worked out a number of suggested itineraries following in the 
footsteps of key movers and shakers in the Revolution (one such is the 
Zapatista Route, tracing the operations of the Zapatista Army of National 
Liberation through the states of Morelos, Puebla and Mexico State), and on 20 
November there is a parade at the central square in Mexico City. For more

December

Catch the Aurora
Next winter is set to be one of the best times to catch the elusive Northern 
Lights, as solar activity is on the increase after hitting a minimum in 2008. 
(The more solar activity, the more the aurora may be visible.) Head to Tromso 
in northern Norway and you'll miss the New Year crowds and can join in with the 
pre-Christmas partying – and with nights that last pretty much all day, they do 
love a party.
