Stand by to watch someone soar to space celebrity at the British Rocketry Oral 
History programme's annual beanfeast at Charterhouse School on April 2. 
Candidates for the first ever Sir Arthur C Clarke awards (to be known as 
Arthurs) now include Beagle 2's Colin Pillinger and the Huygens scientist John 
Zarnecki, on the shortlist for individual contribution, and Pillinger once 
again in the inspiration award. But the Open University's muttonchop-whiskered 
planetary science chief may not have things all his own way. Other candidates 
for the award include golden oldies such as Patrick Moore and Charles Chilton, 
who wrote the 1950s radio classic Journey Into Space.

"These awards are long overdue," says Jerry Stone, who organised the awards. 
"The UK's space activities have been hidden for too long and many of the 
nominees are heroes who richly deserve an honour such as this." Funds raised at 
the dinner will go to tsunami relief in Sri Lanka, home of Sir Arthur. Details
