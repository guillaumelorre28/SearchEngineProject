Till Faida, founder of Adblock maker, Eyeo, told a TechCrunch conference in 
New York on Monday that the company had racked up more than 100 million active 
installations. The figure does not translate directly to users, as people may 
be using the software on more than one device. However, it suggests the company 
is far and away the market leader and highlights the growing popularity of 
adblocking software.

The company described usage in countries “where adblocking is well known” – 
such as France and Germany – as relatively stable, but hinted that rates of 
adoption were faster in the UK and the US. A survey by KPMG found that44% of UK 
adults were planning to use an adblocker

 in the next six months.

The growth of adblocking is creating problems for online publishers, who rely 
on advertising, as it means there is a growing proportion of their audience 
from which they cannot make money.

Eyeo’s approach to adblocking has proved especially controversial as the 
company operates an “acceptable ads” programme, which charges larger publishers 
and advertising companies a fee to be able show users ads the company has 
decided users will find less annoying.

The approach has been described as a “protection racket
