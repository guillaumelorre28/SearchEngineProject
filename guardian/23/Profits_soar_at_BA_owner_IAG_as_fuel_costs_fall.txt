British Airways’ parent company IAG saw its full-year profits soar 64% in 2015 
to €1.8bn (£1.4bn), helped in part by falling fuel prices.

The group, which consists of Iberia, Vueling and the recent addition of Aer 
Lingu

s as well as BA, said it expected to drive up operating profits by about 
another €1bn in 2016.

Chief executive Willie Walsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/willie-walsh> said the results far 
exceeded the targets originally set in 2011 when BA merged with Iberia.

He said: “It’s undoubtedly been a good year but it’s also been challenging 
with extreme volatility in the currency and fuel markets. The benefits gained 
from lower fuel prices have been partially offset by the stronger US dollar.”

Fuel unit costs – calculated by distance and seats flown – have dropped 17%, 
he said, after the impact of hedging.

Walsh said the British EU referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> would not affect IAG: “We 
have conducted a risk analysis of a decision to leave the EU and we don’t see 
any material risk to our business.”

He added: “We’re a global business and have global ambition. It’s not going to 
alter how we look at the world.”

While he said IAG acknowledged that consumers had benefited from open aviation 
in the EU, “We think there is unlikely to be an impact on fares.”

He said that IAG would not, unlike Ryanair, be taking a stance on the vote: 
“We believe this is a position best determined by the electorate and we’re not 
giving advice.”

However, Walsh said he himself was for Europe but believed it needed to be 
reformed. “I am pro-Europe from a personal point of view – and I am Irish and 
see the benefits that it has brought.

“But I have significant experience of dealing with the European commission for 
business and Europe needs to be reformed, definitely – the concept of being 
part of a trading area is a positive one, but it needs to change.“

Meanwhile, Walsh repeated his warning to the new Canadian owners of London 
City airport that they should not look to raise landing charges following their
£2bn acquisition from GIP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/canadian-consortium-buys-london-city-airport-2bn>
: “I’m only concerned [by the deal] if they put up their prices – and they 
should be concerned that we won’t operate so many flights from City.

“If they are looking to make a return on their investment they should not rely 
on us having the same amount of activity ... We’re not a captured customer, and 
our customers are very clear they have choices too.”

IAG announced that Javier Sánchez-Prieto has become the new chairman and chief 
executive of Vueling, replacing Alex Cruz, whowill become chairman and chief 
executive of BA in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/british-airways-alex-cruz-keith-williams-chairman-iag>
, replacing Keith Williams in charge of the British flag-carrier.
