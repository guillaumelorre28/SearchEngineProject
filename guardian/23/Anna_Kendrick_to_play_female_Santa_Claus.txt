<http://variety.com/2017/film/news/anna-kendrick-santa-claus-disney-movie-marc-lawrence-1201945587/>
.

Currently titled Nicole, the story involves Father Christmas chucking in the 
towel on presents delivery and his son getting cold feet at the prospect of 
taking over. This leaves Kendrick to don the big red suit and get the reindeer 
in reins.

Lawrence, who wrote Sandra Bullock vehicle Miss Congeniality

Hugh Grant comedyThe Rewrite

. Kendrick is about to shoot Pitch Perfect 3.

Claus’s daughter is less of a folkloric figure than his spouse, but she has 
been present in Christmas literature for more than 100 years.

In an 1892 play, she is called Kitty and asks her father to give her the gift 
of another man, while in a revisionist 2000 novel, she is called Noel. On the 
big screen, she appears fleetingly in The Legend of Holly Claus, in which the 
heart of the infant daughter is frozen on account of a curse, shortly after 
birth.

On TV, the narrative has usually involved Claus’s daughter – variously 
christened Kristen, Mary and Annie, seeking to escape the North Pole. In Slavic 
literature, such a figure, calledSnegurochka 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snegurochka>, is often seen accompanying her 
father.
