The BBC’s governing body has rejected complaints about a BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> News interview in the wake of the 
Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in which the presenter said Palestinians “suffer 
hugely at Jewish hands as well”.


The live interview conducted by the BBC’s Tim Willcox with an Israeli-born 
Jewish woman was accused of being antisemitic and offensive after she was 
asked: “Many critics though of Israel’s policy would suggest that the 
Palestinians suffer hugely at Jewish hands as well.”

Critics included historian Simon Schama who described the interview as 
“appalling”.

Appalling of @BBCTimWillcox <https://twitter.com/BBCTimWillcox> to imply any 
and all JEWS (not Israelis) responsible for treatment of Palestinians by 
hectoring lady in Paris

Then he had gall to patronise her at the end - "you see people see it from all 
sides"That Palestinian plight justifies anti-semitic murder?

Willcox was part of the BBC News channel’s coverage of the rally against 
terrorism in Paris on 11 January last year in the wake of the attacks on the 
satirical magazine’s offices and a kosher supermarket.

Willcox later apologised on Twitter, saying: “Really sorry for any offence 
caused by a poorly phrased question in a live interview in Paris yesterday – it 
was entirely unintentional.”

The BBC Trust <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-trust>, in its ruling 
published on Thursday, described Willcox’s question as “clumsy” but rejected 
the complaints that it breached the BBC’s editorial guidelines.

It said it was not the presenter’s opinion but had been “clearly attributed to 
critics of Israel” and was “factually based”.

The interviewee had not made a formal complaint, it said, and there was “no 
evidence from the broadcast interview that she was surprised, upset, bewildered 
or offended by the exchange”.

 The Tim Willcox interview on BBC News 
The trust said: “The presenter’s error had been in the clumsy wording, for 
which he had apologised, and not in the inclusion of the content.”

It said his Twitter apology, later issued via the BBC press office, was 
“adequate and appropriate”, adding: “The presenter had accepted that this 
phrasing was poor, and had said it was entirely unintentional and had made an 
unequivocal apology.”

A BBC spokesman said: “BBC News reports widely and extensively across TV, 
radio and online, on many different aspects of this ongoing and complex 
conflict.

“Our role is to explain what is happening and why and we endeavour to reflect 
a range of voices, amid deeply held views. We are committed to continuing to 
report and analyse sometimes fast moving events in an accurate, fair and 
balanced way.”
