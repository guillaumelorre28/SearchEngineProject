Bobby Fischer was 23 when he became world No2 behind Boris Spassky. Garry 
Kasparov <https://www.theguardian.com/world/garry-kasparov> was 19 when Fide 
ranked him second to Anatoly Karpov.

Last weekend Norway's wunderkind Magnus Carlsen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnus-carlsen> eclipsed the immortal pair 
when daily Fide ratings showed that, after elegantly solving the puzzle below, 
he had jumped over Russia's Vladimir Kramnik and was now No2, only five points 
behind the world champion, Vishy Anand of India. Carlsen is aged 17 years and 
six months.

The Anand v Kramnik title match in Germany this October was billed as the 
ultimate showdown between the two current active greats after Kasparov's 
retirement. Now, however, it starts to have the look of a warm-up bout before 
the crown prince stakes his inevitable claim to the throne.

So impressive has been Carlsen's surge to the top that I predict a growing 
clamour from chess fans and media for the ultimate match: Carlsen v Kasparov. 
Kasparov never played Fischer. Fischer never met Karpov.Chess 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chess> needs an encounter between legends.

 M Carlsen v A Shirov, Aerosvit, Ukraine 2008. After hours of hard defence 
Black has just blundered by Be5-g7 instead of Be5-c7, which would have held the 
draw. How did Carlsen (White, to play) force a rapid victory?
