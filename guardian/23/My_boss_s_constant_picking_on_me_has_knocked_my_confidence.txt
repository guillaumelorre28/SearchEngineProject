Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

My boss doesn’t like me. I’m not sure why and I have given up trying to figure 
it out, but it is making my working life really miserable. She undermines me in 
front of the rest of the team, interrupts constantly with irrelevant asides 
when I’m trying to lead meetings, leaves me out of meetings I should be 
included in, and makes constant threats that I might lose my job or someone 
else more junior might lose theirs if I don’t do some, often irrelevant, task.

I am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her bullying, favouritism 
and passive-aggressive behaviour that I feel worthless and useless and 
unemployable.

She likes to remind me that I am lucky to have a job. I have worked there for 
15 years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle. What should I do?
