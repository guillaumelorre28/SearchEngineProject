Our pond suffers from blanket weed. I’ve tried all sorts of treatment, from 
chemical nastiness to barley straw, but nothing seems to deal with it. I’d love 
to fill our pond with plants, but they’d be consumed by the green peril. Is 
there any way to get rid of blanket weed, other than hoicking it out from time 
to time?
There’s no easy solution. The pond weed is doing too well, because the pond 
doesn’t have enough shade and is too rich in nutrients, so the chemical balance 
is out of whack. Removing debris from the bottom and keeping out excessive 
autumn leaves will help. Plant taller marginals, or even a tree, to give better 
shade to the pond.

I have had success in the past using the black dye, Dyofix 
<http://www.dyofix.co.uk>, which dyes the water black, blocking the red end of 
the light spectrum that the blanket weed needs to grow well; it’s harmless to 
wildlife and plants, and contains no pesticide. This will also affect any 
plants that live under the surface, but lilies and reeds that poke above the 
water will be fine.

If you try all these remedies together and continue to pull out any bits of 
blanket weed, I think you may succeed.
