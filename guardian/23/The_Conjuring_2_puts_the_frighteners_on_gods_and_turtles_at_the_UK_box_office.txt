The winner: The Conjuring 2

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/16/the-conjuring-2-review> begins 
with £2.78m plus previews of £1.86m for an opening total of £4.64m. That 
compares with a £2.16m debut forThe Conjuring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/the-conjuring-review> in 2013, 
and £1.94m for Conjuring spinoffAnnabelle

 in 2014. The Conjuring went on to a final gross of £10.46m, while Annabelle

original film’s final gross.

The Conjuring 2: trailer for Enfield-set horror sequel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/the-conjuring-2-new-trailer-for-enfield-set-horror-sequel-video>
However, with a sequel, you’d expect its box office to be relatively 
front-loaded, as fans of the franchise rush out to see the latest instalment. 
Further traction will depend more on audience word of mouth. IMDb user rating 
is an encouraging 8.0/10, although that number usually declines as a film goes 
beyond its fanbase and reaches a wider audience. MetaCritic score is a less 
warm 65/100. AlthoughThe Conjuring 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-conjuring-2> faced competition from Euro 
2016 on television, no England game fell at the weekend.

The real winner: The Secret Life of Pets


Not officially released until 24 June, the latest animated feature from 
Illumination – makers of Despicable Me and Minions – outgrossed The Conjuring 2 
at the weekend. Despite being available to audiences for one day less (Saturday 
and Sunday, but not Friday), The Secret Life of Pets beat The Conjuring 2’s 
weekend tally, with a nifty £3.6m. That will all be added into the tally for 
the coming weekend. When Disney’sZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
 opened in March, it managed £1.73m in previews, which did include a hefty 
chunk from the Saturday and Sunday prior to release. Zootropolis proved a 
significant word-of-mouth hit, reaching £23.6m so far. It’s too early to 
project any final total for The Secret Life of Pets, but its preview number is 
more than double what Zootropolis achieved.

The veteran: Me Before You

Dropping by the smallest amount of any film in the Top 10, Me Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock>
 fell 33% for third-weekend takings of £979,000, and a total of £6.54m. This is 
all good news for everyone involved, and directorThea Sharrock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/06/me-before-you-director-thea-sharrock-disability-campaigners>
 was announced last week as the director of new YA adaptation The Selection, 
based onthe book by Kiera Cass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/24/review-kiera-cass-selection>
.

According to Box Office Mojo, Me Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/me-before-you> has grossed $82m worldwide on 
a rumoured production budget of $20m. While that theatrical box office is split 
with cinemas, and marketing costs also have to be factored in, all the 
ancillary revenues including DVD, VOD and TV are still to come, plus many more 
markets including France, Germany, Spain, Russia and Italy.

The flop: Gods of Egypt

With a US total box office of just $31m and some of the worst reviews for a 
film this year, Alex Proyas’sGods of Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/16/gods-of-egypt-review-film-alex-proyas-bizarre-fantasy>
 always looked like a disaster waiting to happen. So distributor eOne may not 
be too depressed about an opening gross of £484,000, though that’s the lowest 
gross for a film in third place since May 2014.

Gods of Egypt has a rumoured production budget of $140m, so this looks set to 
be an unprofitable title for Lionsgate and its international distribution 
partners. On the other hand, total foreign gross is $112m, according to Box 
Office Mojo, with China ($35.6m) and Russia ($11.4m) doing best so far.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/tale-of-tales-salma-hayek-video-interview>
The arthouse battle

Top arthouse film in the market is Matteo Garrone’s Tale of Tales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/17/tale-of-tales-review-matteo-garrone-salam-hayek-john-c-reilly-toby-jones>
, landing in 13th place with £113,000 from 73 cinemas, plus £6,000 in previews. 
That puts it a place ahead of Whit Stillman’sLove & Friendship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/love-friendship-review-whit-stillmans-austen-drama-is-a-racy-delight>
, grossing a decent £107,000 in its fourth weekend. Holding well, with just an 
11% drop is Ciro Guerra’sEmbrace of the Serpent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/embrace-of-the-serpent-review-a-kurtzian-vision-of-the-amazon>
, set in the Colombian Amazon. The critically acclaimed black-and-white film 
has cracked £100,000 in 10 days – only the third film ever to reach that 
milestone from niche distributor Peccadillo, which specialises in gay and world 
cinema titles.

Admissions update

Tickets sold in May are pretty much level with the number for May 2015. For 
the first five months of the year, admissions are 2% down on the equivalent 
period a year ago. On the one hand, that’s good news: cinema admissions surged 
in 2015, after wobbling badly in 2014. On the other hand, it’s less good news: 
the final quarter last year contributed a big part of that surge, and the 2016 
release calendar appears not to have hits equivalent toSpectre
