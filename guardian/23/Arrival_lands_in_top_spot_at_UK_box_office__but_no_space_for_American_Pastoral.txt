The winner: Arrival

Arrival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/arrival-review-amy-adams-jeremy-renner-science-fiction>
 was the only film released at the weekend in more than 100 prints, and it 
enjoyed plenty of attention from cinemagoers, pushingDoctor Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/doctor-strange-review-benedict-cumberbatch-marvel-eyepoppingly-freaky-extravaganza>
 off the top spot. Opening at 561 cinemas, the brainy sci-fi took £2.57m, with 
Thursday takings pushing the total to £2.92m. The JK Rowling-createdFantastic 
Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
 arrives this week, which explains why Arrival was given such a clear field – 
distributors in general were reluctant to release a film and then have it 
clobbered after seven days.

Amy Adams: ‘Having a child helps you understand communication’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/09/amy-adams-arrival-jeremy-renner-alien-communication-video-interview>
Arrival represents the biggest opening for a film directed by Quebec-born 
Denis Villeneuve. In October 2015,Sicario 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/sicario-review-emily-blunt-at-the-sharp-end-in-war-on-drugs>
 began with £1.60m, including £220,000 in previews. Two years earlier,Prisoners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/26/prisoners-review>, starring Hugh 
Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, kicked off with £1.37m, including £38,000 in 
previews. Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, is hardly more 
star-driven than either of Villeneuve’s previous efforts, which suggests 
cinemagoers are responding to the genre, an appealing premise and the overall 
buzz.

The chasing pack

Family animations Trolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/11/trolls-review-anna-kendrick-a-candy-coloured-return-for-the-famed-ugly-lovable-creatures>
 andStorks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/storks-review-baby-carriers-deliver-a-bundle-of-wacky-fun>
 posted strong holds, dipping by just 9% and 7% from the previous session, while
Nocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-amy-adams-jake-gyllenhaal>
 fell a slim 12%. This means that Amy Adams is enjoying two sizable, 
awards-buzz titles, which are both straddling multiplexes and indie cinemas. 
Nocturnal Animals is doing especially well in the latter, with second-weekend 
takings of £617,000 taking the tally for Tom Ford’s film to a solid £1.85m.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/a-street-cat-named-bob-review> is 
another title experiencing a very small decline – down just 12% from its 
opening session. The adaptation of James Bowen’s memoir has reached £2.61m 
after 10 days.

The disappointment: American Pastoral

Landing in 19th place, Ewan McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ewanmcgregor>’s directorial debut American 
Pastoral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/american-pastoral-review-ewan-mcgregor-jennifer-connelly-philip-roth>
 makes an inauspicious start to its UK run, with £57,000 from 82 cinemas. 
Film-makers have been trying to adapt Philip Roth’s novels since 1969’s attempt 
at Goodbye, Columbus (published in 1959), with variable results. One notable 
effort was Robert Benton’s crack at The Human Stain (2003), which starred 
Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman. It began with £74,000 from 94 cinemas on its 
way to a mediocre total of £163,000.

Watch the trailer for American Pastoral – video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAAqiO_Z9Vs> 
American Pastoral faces what seems to be the cold shoulder from bookers at 
leading indie cinemas. A few Everyman sites played it at the weekend, as did 
Edinburgh Filmhouse (where McGregor is a local hero), but the Curzon and 
Picturehouse chains didn’t have it, nor did independent venues such as Home 
Manchester, Watershed Bristol, Showroom Sheffield, Tyneside Cinema, Broadway 
Nottingham and – surprisingly – Glasgow Film Theatre (which has however booked 
it for five days in December). American Pastoral has an IMDb user rating of 
6.2/10 and a discouraging Metacritic score of 43/100.

Yet another adaptation of a Roth novel, Indignation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/indignation-review-logan-lerman-excels-in-philip-roth-adaptation>
, arrives this Friday. This is the feature directing debut of triple 
Oscar-nominated producer James Schamus (Brokeback Mountain), and stars Logan 
Lerman and Sarah Gadon.

The big faller: The Light Between Oceans

Dropping by 50% from its opening frame, The Light Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/the-light-between-oceans-review-michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander>
 fell harder than any other film in the Top 10. Distributor eOne managed to 
retain 430 cinemas for the second session (down from 438 the week before), but 
will doubtless have lost out on showtimes, or seen the film shoved into 
smaller-capacity screens. A weekend gross of £226,000 yielded a site average of 
£526 – lower than any other film in the Top 10. Look for The Light Between 
Oceans to reduce its footprint in UK cinemas from this Friday.

The future

Despite the paucity of commercially potent new releases, takings overall fell 
only 7% from the previous frame. Compared with the equivalent weekend from 
2015, whenSpectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden>
 stayed at the top spot for a third week andThe Lady in the Van 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/12/the-lady-in-the-van-review-maggie-smith-alan-bennett-nicholas-hytner>
 was the top new release, the market is off by 23%. After this relatively quiet 
patch, cinema owners are braced for a bonanza with the arrival of Fantastic 
Beasts. Few are expecting numbers quite at Harry Potter levels, but there 
hasn’t been a film from Rowling’s magical universe for more than five years, so 
there is ample pent-up demand.

Predictably, everyone else is running scared of the date, and there are no 
other wide releases. As well as Indignation trying its luck at arthouse 
cinemas, also in the mix are Jim Jarmusch’s Iggy Pop documentaryGimme Danger
