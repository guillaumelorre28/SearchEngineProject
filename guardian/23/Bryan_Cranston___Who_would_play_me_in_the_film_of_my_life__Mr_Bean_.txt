Now is pretty damned good.

What is your earliest memory?
Crawling around the Christmas tree.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
Impatience.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
Every time I look in the mirror, I see an old guy I don’t recognise.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
Mr Bean.

What is your most unappealing habit?
I recycle religiously, and get on my high horse when people don’t.

What is your favourite smell?
My daughter’s neck.

Which book changed your life?
Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/men-are-from-mars-women-are-from-venus.html>.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
Decadent desserts.

To whom would you most like to say sorry?
Every girl I dated before I read Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.

What or who is the greatest love of your life?
My wife. We met on a terrible television drama called Airwolf

had to include a helicopter.

What was the best kiss of your life?
A year after we met, my wife and I found ourselves in a comedy improv class

What has been your biggest disappointment?
That I couldn’t bridge the gap with my parents before they died. My mother 
died 10 years ago of Alzheimer’s, and my father died two years ago. He left 
when I was 11 and we got back in touch when I was 22.

If you could go back in time, where would you go?
To Elizabethan England, to see the explosion of creativity in music and plays 
– but only so long as I wasn’t subjected to the plague.

When did you last cry, and why?
When I think of my mother. After my father left, she became an alcoholic and 
wallowed in resentment.

What single thing would improve the quality of your life?
If everybody was kind.

What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
When you are not feeling happy, pretend you are, and pretty soon you will be.

Tell us a joke
So there is a guy at home and there’s a knock at the door. He opens it and 
there’s no one there. He’s about to close the door when he notices that, on the 
ground, there’s a snail looking up at him. He bends down, picks up the snail, 
steps out on to his porch and throws the snail as far as he can. Three years 
later, there’s a knock at the door and the man opens the door, there’s no one 
there. He looks down and there’s the snail. The snail looks up at the man and 
says, “Hey, what was that about?”

Tell us a secret 
Sometimes I don’t really know what I am doing.
