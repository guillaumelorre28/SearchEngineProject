Between Golden State’s explosive offense and Portland’s lack of any decent 
defense, the Warriors steamrolled their opponents with smooth passing, a 
barrage of three-pointers and a series of thunderous dunks.

Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant

 showed off their chemistry on the court – including a Durant assist to Curry 
for a buzzer-beating three-pointer to end the third quarter, continuing their 
reign as the highest-scoring duo in the league.

“They’re the best team in the west right now,” Portland’s head coach, Terry 
Stotts, said of the Warriors before tipoff, seemingly prepared for a loss.

Durant had a near-perfect game, seeming more confident and at home than ever.

 scored 34 points in 31 minutes, hitting 11 of 13 shots and grabbing 11 
rebounds.

Curry added 19 points with five three-pointers and six assists. The reigning 
MVP now has 105 three-pointers in his 25 regular-season games against the Trail 
Blazers, his highest three-point total against any opponent.

Draymond Green had a standout performance in his 200th regular-season game, 
leading on defense with 12 rebounds and 13 assists. Klay Thompson contributed 
16 points and Ian Clark added a career-high 23 points off the bench to help 
seal the victory.

The commanding victory comes after a gruelling road trip that Durant described 
as a “rough patch”, though the team won all but one game.

“We weren’t playing well at all on both ends of the court,” he said. “We 
didn’t play with a sense of purpose. But now we kind of reset.”

Against the Trail Blazers, the Warriors hit 100 points before the fourth 
quarter even started. The lead was so strong that even Golden State fans didn’t 
stick out the entire game, many leaving their seats during a break halfway 
through the fourth quarter.

The Blazers – a team that normally has one of the highest-scoring backcourts 
in theNBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba>, and one of the only teams to 
beat the Warriors in last year’s record-breaking season – were more than a 
little off their game.

“This was a disappointing loss,” Stotts said. “Obviously we didn’t play well.”

Their star player, Damian Lillard, struggled to get started and ended the game 
with only 20 points. Portland was out-rebounded by 25 rebounds, the largest 
differential in the NBA this season.

“Right now we’re just having a hard time,” Lillard said. “We’ve as a team been 
in worse positions.”

Portland’s defense was lacking, particularly with Festus Ezili and Al-Farouq 
Aminu sitting out injured. The center Ezili, a former Warriors player, islikely 
to undergo season-ending surgery

 to address his left knee injury. Coaches refused to comment when prompted.

The victory was the Warriors’ second by 40 points or more this season. The 
rest of the league has only one,ESPN noted
