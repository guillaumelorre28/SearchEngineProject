The French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, whose Paris offices were the target 
of a jihadist massacre

 in January 2015, will launch a German edition on 1 December in the wake of 
that country’s support for its work, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

The German version, with an initial print run of 200,000, will consist mainly 
of articles and cartoons translated from the French, but its editors also want 
to create German content by collaborating with German cartoonists, she said.

Priced at €4 (£3.40), it will be available across Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> every Thursday. A team of five 
translators is based in the western German town of Frankfurt.

Germans bought 70,000 copies of Charlie Hebdo’s “survivors’ edition”, which 
appeared one week after the massacre, and sales of the French edition stand at 
about 1,000 a week in Germany today.

The attack at the Paris offices of the decades-old magazine left 12 people dead
