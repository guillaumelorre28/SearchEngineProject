Winning tip: El Ateneo Gran Splendid

There are stunning bookshops in the world and then there is El Ateneo Grand 
Splendid. Once a theatre and cinema, it opened in 1919 and became a bookshop 81 
years later. Inside El Ateneo clients are respectfully quiet, just like an 
audience right before the start of a show. Sit in the cafe, order acafecito, 
leaf through a Buenos Aires city guide and enjoy the majestic uniqueness of 
this book haven!

La Bombonera (The Chocolate Box) is the football stadium where Boca Juniors 
play, and if you catch a match there you’ll get a real flavour of the city – 
even if you don’t like football. The spectacular stands rise from the houses 
and shops of La Boca neighbourhood, south of the city centre. Just go with the 
flow - expect fireworks, in every sense.

Fine dining in secret
 Casa Felix 
Buenos Aires is famous for its steak houses and pizzerias, but some of the 
best food in the city is found in people’s homes. There are dozens of secret 
“closed-door” restaurants hidden around town, often run by top chefs wanting to 
offer something different for true foodies in intimate settings. The best I 
know of is Casa Felix, in an art deco home, where the menu is sourced from the 
garden where you enjoy cocktails when you arrive.

Yes, you will need a password to get in and yes, you need to go to a phone box 
to tap in a four-digit code, but, yes, it’s totally worth it! Great drinks 
coupled with a vibrant atmosphere make this an absolute must in Buenos Aires!

To see Argentine tango at its best, visit La Ventana in San Telmo. A visit 
here includes delicious food and a mesmerising professional tango show. These 
shows take place each night and the dancers’ passion for their art really comes 
through. We all felt a tad emotional and in awe! Even though I saw this show on 
a visit to Buenos Aires four years ago I can still remember the feeling and 
power portrayed by the whole performance so clearly. Highly recommended!

The Fuerza Bruta is an interactive experience like no other. Found in the 
Recoleta area, the venue feels more like a local students’ union, complete with 
cheap beer in the bar beforehand. The show begins with pounding drums and 
chanting and flows full force into 90 minutes of dreamy otherworldly chaos. 
Expect to see sprites running along the walls, girls sliding through water 
inches above your head and members of the audience being plucked out of the 
crowd and lifted high into a inflatable dome. Leave your camera at home and 
expect to get wet.

 The Natural History Museum in San Telmo. Photograph: Alamy 
One of BA’s best spots is San Telmo, the oldest neighbourhood in the city. It 
is a slope that starts with Bolivar street and ends in Parque Lezama just in 
front of the Museo Historico Nacional. Along the block of faded grandeur there 
are beautiful buildings from the 19th century and many restaurants and cafés. 
Traditional Argentinian fare at La Popular de San Telmo is ideal for a quiet 
lunch during the week.

Don Julio is an authentic Buenos Aires dining experience: it exudes a sort of 
1950s atmosphere, brick walls with signed bottles of wine in every nook and 
cranny, brown leather tablecloths and smart waiters. Enter and your appetite is 
whetted by a smoky aroma of grilled tender steaks cooking and musky Malbec 
swilling around in the customers glasses at thisparrilla in trendy Palermo.
