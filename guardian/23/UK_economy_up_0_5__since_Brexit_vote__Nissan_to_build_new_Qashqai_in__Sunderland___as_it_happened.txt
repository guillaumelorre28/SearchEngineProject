Closing summary: UK defies Brexit fears, for now...

Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours.

Britain’s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate 
recession following the EU referendum.

The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP 
rose by 0.5% between July and September.

That’s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected.

The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8%

.Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK 
economy remains unbalanced.

Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That 
suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services:

Were it not for the output of the Film & TV production sector in Q3, GDP 
growth would’ve been 0.37% instead of 0.5%.

Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the news, saying it shows the UK economy is 
resilient as it begins Brexit negotiations

But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811c03ae4b0219a00d392da#block-5811c03ae4b0219a00d392da>
. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too.

In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland 
plant. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e#block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e>
 The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be 
moved to France.

Prime minister Theresa May says it’s a vote of confidence in the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811d42ce4b08d944ba4b31e#block-5811d42ce4b08d944ba4b31e>
.

But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give 
details 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811f6bee4b0219a00d3941c#block-5811f6bee4b0219a00d3941c>
, but that hasn’t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against 
damage from Brexit.

Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors,
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811ebd4e4b08d944ba4b3b3#block-5811ebd4e4b08d944ba4b3b3>
and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit.

Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn’t revealing what the government 
has promised to Nissan.

According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a 
dozen questions on the World At One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/27/labour-to-warn-theresa-may-against-bankers-brexit-politics-live?page=with:block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a#block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a>
, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal.

The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget:

There’s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we’ve said 
that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of 
the sector.

But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour).

UK car industry wants Brexit assurances

Bang on cue.... Britain’s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be 
protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK’s exit 
from the EU.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders
, says:

“Today’s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming 
Britain as a leader in automotive production.

To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public 
assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained – namely, a 
competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and 
the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.”

Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government 
if Britain’s exit from the EU hurts Nissan.

So says Reuters, which reports:

Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event 
that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for 
new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of 
the matter told Reuters.

In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to 
offer further relief if the terms of Britain’s European Union exit ended up 
harming the plant’s performance, the source said.

That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail 
in Sunderland

Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour’s reaction to 
Nissan’s announcement:

John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with 
Nissan as a “chaotic” strategy.

In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise 
financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been 
no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker.

“We know nothing about it,” he said. “Are they literally going to decide 
factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive 
plan, and this is chaos at the moment.”

“We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum 
brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will 
divide our country once more.

The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for 
by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we 
going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more

The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in 
Sunderland are safe

, along with thousands more in the supply chain.

Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car 
industry’s world-leading status.

“Nissan’s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise 
of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the 
Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family.

Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single 
market, to help all UK car markets.

Breakthrough in EU-Canada trade deal deadlock

More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade 
deal with Canada has been broken!

Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that “an agreement” has been 
reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally 
blocked the deal last week.

Cecilia Malmström <https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU>, the Eu trade 
commissioner, says it’s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can 
now be signed.
Cecilia Malmström (@MalmstromEU) 
Finally white smoke on #CETA <https://twitter.com/hashtag/CETA?src=hash>. 
Belgian agreement reached. Hope a date can be set soon for the EU and Canada to 
sign the deal.
 <https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU/status/791592084843143168> October 27, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU/status/791592084843143168> 
Unfortunately, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has already cancelled 
his trip to Brussels to sign the deal. (he was due to land today) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/justin-trudeau-canadian-pm-cancels-brussels-trip-talks-trade-deal-eu>
.

And he needn’t pack his suitcase just yet. European Council chief Donald Tusk 
says he won’t be in touch until all the paperwork is definitely ready.
Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) 
I am glad for good news from PM @CharlesMichel 
<https://twitter.com/CharlesMichel>. Only once all procedures are finalised for 
EU signing CETA, will I contact PM@JustinTrudeau

John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, isn’t impressed that Nissan have 
apparently cut a deal to stay in Sunderland.

Nissan’s surprise announcement came just as McDonnell was giving a speech 
about the economy, which is rather bad luck for Labour (unless the dark arts of 
political spin are in play...).

Nissan: We're sticking with Sunderland following May's Brexit pledge

It’s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite 
the uncertainty over Britain’s future.

Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too.

And the company also confirms that Theresa May’s government has given a 
‘commitment’ that the plant’s competitiveness won’t be damaged by Brexit.

Here’s the official statement:

Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee 
meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the 
next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant.

Nissan’s decision follows the U.K. government’s commitment to ensure that the 
Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its 
investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 
workers at the plant.

“I am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. 
Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive 
powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,” said Carlos 
Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan.

“The support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that 
the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I 
welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May’s commitment to the automotive 
industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.”

Nissan’s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million 
cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the 
UK’s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from 
Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million 
Qashqai’s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to 
the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 
British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than 
£3.7 billion in Sunderland.

Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%.

So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan’s decision not to move Qashqai 
production abroad.

Paul Brand of ITV tweets:

When I reported from Sunderland during #EUref 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUref?src=hash> some Nissan workers were even 
voting Brexit, insisting their company was scaremongering 1/2

But big test won't be this next model of Qashqai. With Brexit still over 2 
years away, it's whether Nissan will build future models too. 2/2

Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU 
imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit?

CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new 
tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union.

After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said:

If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a 
commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of 
compensation.
Brian Groom (@GroomB) 
Sounds like Nissan has won guarantee of some form of compensation if it ends 
up paying tariffs on EU trade.https://t.co/Xt62WbWOe5 <https://t.co/Xt62WbWOe5>

Reuters: Nissan to build next Qashqai in Sunderland

Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it 
will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland.

That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major 
investment decisions since June.

The Nissan plant at Sunderland employs around 7,000 people, and is Britain’s 
biggest car factory.

Last week Nissan’s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa 
May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it 
was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote.

Today’s growth report shows that the “Brexit bogeyman” hasn’t yet been as 
scary as initially feared, saysNancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close 
Brothers Asset Management.

She writes:

Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been 
officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major 
assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has 
played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. 
These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth.

But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year:

The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty 
is having some bite, and it’s likely the ambiguity around the UK’s exit from 
the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with 
anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble 
on.

Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours.

Britain’s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate 
recession following the EU referendum. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811bab3e4b0219a00d392ca#block-5811bab3e4b0219a00d392ca>

The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP 
rose by 0.5% between July and September.

That’s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected.

The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811bc5ee4b01c528432d31e#block-5811bc5ee4b01c528432d31e>
.Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK 
economy remains unbalanced.

Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That 
suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services:

But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017

. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too.

In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland 
plant.

 The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be 
moved to France.

Prime minister Theresa May says it’s a vote of confidence in the UK

.

But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give 
details

, but that hasn’t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against 
damage from Brexit.

Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors,

and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit.

Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn’t revealing what the government 
has promised to Nissan.

According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a 
dozen questions on the World At One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/27/labour-to-warn-theresa-may-against-bankers-brexit-politics-live?page=with:block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a#block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a>
, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal.

The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget:

There’s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we’ve said 
that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of 
the sector.

But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour).

Bang on cue.... Britain’s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be 
protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK’s exit 
from the EU.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders
, says:

“Today’s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming 
Britain as a leader in automotive production.

To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public 
assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained – namely, a 
competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and 
the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.”
 
Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government 
if Britain’s exit from the EU hurts Nissan.

So says Reuters, which reports:

Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event 
that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for 
new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of 
the matter told Reuters.

In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to 
offer further relief if the terms of Britain’s European Union exit ended up 
harming the plant’s performance, the source said.

That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail 
in Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e#block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e>
.But surely other carmakers are going to want a similar deal, as Buzzfeed’s

Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour’s reaction to 
Nissan’s announcement:

John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with 
Nissan as a “chaotic” strategy.

In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise 
financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been 
no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker.

“We know nothing about it,” he said. “Are they literally going to decide 
factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive 
plan, and this is chaos at the moment.”

“We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum 
brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will 
divide our country once more.

The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for 
by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we 
going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more 
openness and transparency and accountability.”

The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in 
Sunderland are safe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-brexit-impact-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e#block-5811d228e4b01c528432d37e>
, along with thousands more in the supply chain.

Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car 
industry’s world-leading status.

“Nissan’s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise 
of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the 
Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family.

Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single 
market, to help all UK car markets.

More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade 
deal with Canada has been broken!

Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that “an agreement” has been 
reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally 
blocked the deal last week.

Cecilia Malmström <https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU>, the Eu trade 
commissioner, says it’s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can 
now be signed.

It’s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite 
the uncertainty over Britain’s future.

Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too.

And the company also confirms that Theresa May’s government has given a 
‘commitment’ that the plant’s competitiveness won’t be damaged by Brexit.

Here’s the official statement:

Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee 
meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the 
next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant.

Nissan’s decision follows the U.K. government’s commitment to ensure that the 
Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its 
investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 
workers at the plant.

“I am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. 
Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive 
powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,” said Carlos 
Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan.

“The support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that 
the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I 
welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May’s commitment to the automotive 
industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.”

Nissan’s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million 
cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the 
UK’s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from 
Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million 
Qashqai’s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to 
the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 
British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than 
£3.7 billion in Sunderland.
 
Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%.

So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan’s decision not to move Qashqai 
production abroad.

Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU 
imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit?

CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new 
tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union.

After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said:

If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a 
commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of 
compensation.

Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it 
will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland.

That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major 
investment decisions since June.

biggest car factory.

Last week Nissan’s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa 
May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it 
was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote.

We’ve called Nissan for comment.....
 
Today’s growth report shows that the “Brexit bogeyman” hasn’t yet been as 
scary as initially feared, saysNancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close 
Brothers Asset Management.

She writes:

Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been 
officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major 
assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has 
played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. 
These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth.

But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year:

The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty 
is having some bite, and it’s likely the ambiguity around the UK’s exit from 
the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with 
anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble 
on.
