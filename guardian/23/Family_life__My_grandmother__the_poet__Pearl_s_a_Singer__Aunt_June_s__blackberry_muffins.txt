Snapshot: My grandmother Effie, working-class poet


I love this photo, which was taken on my grandparents’ wedding day in about 
1925. My grandmother Effie is the one on the far right and my grandfather 
Charles is on the far left. I love Effie’s jaunty confidence and her happy 
smile, and I love the way that Charles stands quiet and modest, as he always 
was, in every photo that was ever taken. Effie’s sister, Min, is here, too, her 
father (second from left), and her brother, Harold.

My grandparents’ courtship came out of a shared grief. Effie had been engaged 
to Charles’s best friend, but he was killed in the first world war. They had 
all grown up together in Sheffield, in the same group of friends, but Effie and 
her family had moved to Cheltenham. Charles came to visit Effie there after her 
fiance died, and was so struck by her courage that he fell in love with her. 
That, at least, is what we were told. I think it is likely that he was also 
struck by her musical gifts and her wicked sense of humour.

Effie went on to become a known poet who has three books to her name, but she 
could never have done this without my grandfather’s quiet encouragement and his 
belief in her. They were working-class people. Thomas, Effie’s father, was a 
policeman and Charles was a barber.Working-class people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/10/andrew-ohagan-george-orwell-memoriallecture>
 didn’t write poetry … especially working-class women. Effie was perhaps 
conscious of this, but with Charles’s praise and quiet support she flourished.

When we were children, she would sometimes take down her poetry diary, which 
she called her “Book of Words” and read it to us. Somehow, the rhythms and the 
means of expression worked their way deep into my consciousness, and now, as a 
modern woman, with perhaps more confidence than she had, I write full-time – 
poems, stories, journalism and plays.

After Charles died, Effie stopped writing poetry. She never really recovered 
from his death, which came suddenly, and tragically, when they were in their 
early 50s. I never met him, but I was conscious of a grief that shadowed her, 
although she never dwelt on it, and was always full of bright stories to make 
us laugh.

When I look at this photo I remember that she really did know some happiness, 
and was, at least for a while, a good-looking, confident woman, full of 
laughter and strength.

Playlist: The only cassette my parents ever played

Pearl’s a Singer by Elkie Brooks

“Pearl’s a singer / She stands up when she plays the piano / In a nightclub / 
Pearl’s a singer / She sings songs for the lost and the lonely”

I know that my parents owned more than one cassette. There was a set of fake 
wooden drawers in the back room that had at least 10 others in it. But only one 
ever seemed to make it to the player. It played every Sunday while Mam made the 
dinner and Dad did the ironing, and every time we made a car journey (once a 
month to visit my auntie in Swansea). And it was the cause of a dreadful 
tension on one trip.

“I thought you were bringing it,” Mam said, when we were already too far to go 
back.

“No, I thought you bloody had it,” said Dad.

My sister and I offered to sing, but that didn’t help. No matter that we knew 
every word and had sung Pearl’s a Singer in our backyard shows with me playing 
the keyboard and my sister prancing around in the latest outfit she’d whisked 
together with Mam’s silk dressing gown and some ribbon. We were not Elkie 
Brooks.

My parents don’t like to travel these days. They’ve moved to a house by the 
sea and that, they say, is enough for them. Still, some things never change, 
and on Sunday afternoons even now I can be certain that Mam will be making the 
dinner, Dad will be doing the ironing and there in the background Pearl will be 
standing up when she plays the piano.

 Suzie Davis’s Aunt June’s blackberry muffins 
Auntie June was always foraging – mushrooms, sloes, wild damsons. At 
blackberry time she was truly in her element. She would give each of us an 
empty ice-cream tub and lead us through the Devon woods to her favourite 
thicket where they were in abundance. The pleasure of picking free food was a 
bittersweet experience as the nettles seemed to be as copious as the berries, 
and hands and arms smarted and tingled from the stings for days afterwards.

She told us this was where she had brought the American GIs who had been 
stationed locally during the war. She loved the attention and fun she shared 
with these handsome and slightly exotic young men, so different from uncouth 
farm lads. She loved sharing the local sights and simple pleasures with her 
new-found friends. “Gee – they’re cute! Like our blueberries at home, but more 
messy and sweeter,” one soldier exclaimed. “They’d make cool muffins eh, June?”

June had no idea what American muffins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/feb/27/how-make-perfect-blueberry-muffins>
 were, so she invited Timothy David Jnr to make her some. It wasn’t just the 
muffins she fell in love with. But Timothy and the Americans disappeared 
suddenly two days later. She never heard from the muffin man again, but every 
time we went to visit her at blackberrying time, she reminded us of her 
handsome GI, and mused on how she might not have ended up a spinster had he not 
gone to theNormandy beaches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ng-interactive/2014/jun/01/d-day-landings-scenes-in-1944-and-now-interactive>
. We never minded the repetition; the muffins were too delicious.
