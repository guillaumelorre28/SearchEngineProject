 and Branwell Brontë all worked as teachers.

The Old School Room is a cherished Grade II-listed building in Haworth, West 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire>, the village where 
the Brontë sisters wrote some of the best-loved books in the English language, 
including Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

But nearly 200 years in the weather-beaten Pennine valley have taken their 
toll on the historic school building and its Victorian-era roofs have begun to 
leak.

The renovation comes after eight years of fundraising by Brontë Spirit, the 
charity dedicated to repairing and refurbishing the property. About £70,000 
came from grant money and nearly £30,000 from community fundraising.

The Rev Peter Mayo-Smith, the rector of Haworth parish church, said that once 
the property was made watertight its custodians would be able to make 
improvements to other parts of the building.

He said he was delighted that the main part of the renovation was under way. 
“I congratulate the trustees of Brontë Spirit for the extremely hard work they 
have put into making this possible,” he added.

“This is excellent news. The Old School Room is a very valuable building not 
just for Haworth but also for the nation. It is one of two properties Patrick 
Brontë was responsible for building, the other being St Gabriel’s church in 
Stanbury.

“He was a great believer in education being a way out of poverty – something 
still very relevant today – and he wanted the children of local mill workers to 
have an education so they could escape the deprivation of the surrounding area.”

The Grade II-listed Old School Room was built by Patrick Brontë in 1832 and 
was extended in 1850 and 1871. It was replaced as a school in 1903, and was 
then used as a gymnasium, a library, a youth hostel and even an army billet 
during the second world war.

As part of the renovation, expected to take two and a half months, the roof 
will be fixed and six of the windows replaced with new, timber-frame replicas.

Trevor Mitchell, Historic England’s planning director for Yorkshire, said: “We 
are delighted that the community is moving forward with repairs. The Old School 
Room stands at the heart of the Brontë story and should be a cherished and 
visited space.

“Historic England worked with Bradford Council in 2012 to fund some window 
replacement and other improvements to the village and we are glad Haworth’s 
heritage is continuing to be celebrated and preserved.”
