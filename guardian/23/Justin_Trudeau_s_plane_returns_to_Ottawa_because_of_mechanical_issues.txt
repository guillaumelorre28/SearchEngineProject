Trudeau had agreed at the last minute to fly to Brussels to ink the landmark 
CETA pact 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/belgium-reaches-deal-with-wallonia-over-eu-canada-trade-agreement>
, which was seven years in the making, at a summit with European Union 
president Donald Tusk and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker.

The ceremony was originally meant to take place on Thursday but was delayed 
after Belgium’s French-speaking region of Wallonia, with just 3.6 million 
people, refused to agree to the terms of a deal affecting more than 500 million 
Europeans, along withCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada>.

Wallonia resisted huge pressure from all sides until it won concessions - for 
regional farming interests and guarantees that international investors will not 
be able to force governments to change laws – allowing Belgium to sign the deal 
late Friday, enabling Tusk and Trudeau to set a new date.

The summit was due begin at 0830 GMT with the signing due at 1000 GMT, but it 
is not known if the problem with Trudeau’s plane will push the meeting further 
back.
