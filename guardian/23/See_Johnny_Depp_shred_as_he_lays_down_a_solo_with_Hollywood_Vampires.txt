You may recall Johnny Depp’s views on Hollywood stars launching musical 
careers: “That whole idea for me is a sickening thing, it’s always just made me 
sick,” he said earlier this year. “I’ve been very lucky to play on friends’ 
records and it’s still going. Music is still part of my life. But you won’t be 
hearing theJohnny Depp <https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp> Band. That 
won’t ever exist.”

The Johnny Depp Band might not exist, but the Hollywood Vampires 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/16/johnny-depp-supergroup-hollywood-vampires-alice-cooper-joe-perry-aerosmith>
 do – that’s the band featuring Depp alongside his friend Alice Cooper –with 
whom he played in London in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/28/alice-cooper-review> – and 
Aerosmith’s Joe Perry, who’ve recorded an album featuring special guests 
including Dave Grohl, Paul McCartney, Slash and the late Christopher Lee.


Just in case you were thinking Depp might be the passenger in such august 
company, here’s some documentary evidence to the contrary – the man himself 
laying down his solo for the album’s final track, Dead Drunk Friends. Hollywood 
Vampires is out now.
