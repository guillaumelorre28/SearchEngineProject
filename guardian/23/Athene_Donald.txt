Athene Donald <https://www.theguardian.com/science/athene-donald>, 57, is 
passionate about being a role model. "Having very visible, successful women who 
have not become complete anoraks is really important to keep girls doing 
science. They are put off it; they think they can't have a family and be a 
successful scientist," she says.

An expert in the structure of "soft" matter, Donald researches unconventional 
areas for a physicist â€“ such as revolutionary treatments for Alzheimer's.

Now professor of experimental physics at Cambridge University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/13/athene-donald-physics>, she 
was made a dame last year. Donald is also director of theWomen in Science, 
Engineering and Technology Initiative at Cambridge 
<http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/equality/wiseti/>, which mentors female 
scientists at the university, and is chair of theAthena Forum 
<http://www.athenaforum.org.uk/>, which promotes women in science and 
technology.

A prolific blogger <http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/>, she comments 
regularly on the challenges facing female scientists.
