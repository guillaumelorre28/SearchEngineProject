BBC DJ Andy Kershaw <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-kershaw> is in 
jail after being charged with breaching a restraining order. The former Radio 1 
presenter who now works for Radio 3 was arrested on Wednesday afternoon near 
the home of his ex-partner Juliette Banner. Ms Banner had won a restraining 
order against Kershaw banning him from visiting her home after the couple 
separated.

Police arrested Kershaw, 48, after he allegedly attempted to visit Ms Banner 
at her home in Peel, on the Isle of Man. He appeared before the court in 
Douglas on Thursday and was remanded in custody to reappear on Tuesday. The 
couple have two children and the restraining order was granted on 1 August.

Kershaw, who is originally from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, now lives on the 
Isle of Man. He presents a world music show on Radio 3, where he has been since 
2001, on Mondays but is currently on a summer break.
