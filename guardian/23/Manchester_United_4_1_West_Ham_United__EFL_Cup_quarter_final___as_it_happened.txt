FULL TIME: Manchester United 4-1 West Ham United

And that’s the final kick of a comprehensive victory for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. The scoreline didn’t 
flatter them: in fact, it probably should have been more. But after repeatedly 
failing to finish teams off in the Premier League, they’ll take this. And they 
reach their 14th League Cup semi-final! They go into the hat with Southampton, 
who won tonight at Arsenal, plus Hull City and Liverpool. The draw’s coming up 
in a minute or two. Don’t go anywhere!

GOAL! Manchester United 4-1 West Ham United (Ibrahimovic 90+3)

Herrera busies himself down the inside-left channel, beating three men and 
pulling the ball into the centre. In the middle, on the edge of the six-yard 
box, Ibrahimovic. He can’t miss, and ends the game as he started it!

90 min +2: West Ham have come alive, but it’s far too late. Kouyate reaches 
the by-line down the right and cuts back from Feghouli, who should get his shot 
from 12 yards on target, but blasts crazily over the bar instead.

90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Rashford comes on for 
Mkhitaryan. Then Feghouli finds a bit of space down the right and has a wild

looks for the top right corner from 30 yards. Nowhere near, but hearty applause

84 min: Zaza wins a corner of Rojo. That’s a nice sentence to say out loud. 
People like to say salsa. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uub_Oqwefwc> The set 
piece, coming in from the left, should be met by Zaza, six yards out. But he 
only succeeds in heading thin air. A chance to launch an unlikely comeback 
spurned.

81 min: A brilliant effort by Ibrahimovic. On the left-hand corner of the 
six-yard box, he nutmegs Feghouli and curls one towards the bottom right, all 
in one sweet move. Adrian tips away from danger. “As a Liverpool fan I’m 
encouraged by West Ham’s defending but a little dispirited at Man United’s 
attacking verve,” writes Niall Mullen. “Aren’t they supposed to be a beaten 
docket?” As a rule, it’s best not to write offManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. Imagine what people 
were saying during the Herbert Bamlett era, for example, and look what happened 
in the four decades after that.

79 min: Mkhitaryan has a dig from distance. The ball balloons off a West Ham 
defender and out for a corner on the right. Before Rooney takes it, he has a 
little argument with the linesman, over nothing it would seem. He’s in that 
sort of mood tonight. It’s almost as though he’s better when he’s close to 
boiling over. Anyway, the resulting set piece is a waste of time.

76 min: As Rooney is repaired, Zaza comes on for Payet, who has been strangely 
quiet tonight. Apart from the shot that led to West Ham’s goal, of course, but 
you get the general point.

74 min: Manchester United press West Ham back. Ibrahimovic and Rooney acting 
as proper pests, buzzing hither and yon, causing all sorts of trouble. Rooney 
takes a whack in the face from Reid. Totally accidental, but blood’s been 
drawn. The referee stops play. Rooney is livid. Does he want a penalty? Is he 
cross that the pressure’s been relieved? Either way, he nearly talks his way 
into a second yellow, before running to the sidelines to mop up the red.

70 min: Kouyate earns a corner out on the right. Reid tries to connect with 
the set piece, ten yards out, but not for the first time tonight, a West Ham 
cross evades a team-mate’s noggin by inches.

68 min: Manchester United look confident and in control right now. Which, in 
fairness, they did at this point in the first half, before West Ham went on to 
level. But the visitors don’t look like they’ve got a dramatic two-goal 
comeback in them. Their passes aren’t sticking to feet.

66 min: West Ham look visibly deflated. On the touchline, Slaven Bilic has his 
hands thrust deep into his pockets, in the ‘Miffed’ style.

64 min: This is the sort of scoreline Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> deserved to take out 
of the first half. Only now do they have it. West Ham try to respond 
immediately, winning a corner down the left. But Payet, whose dead-ball efforts 
haven’t been so good tonight, can’t beat the first man.

GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 West Ham United (Martial 62)

The semi-finals beckon for Manchester Ujnited! Herrera, in the centre of the 
park on the right, passes inside for Ibrahimovic, who slide-rules a fine ball 
down the inside-right channel. Valencia strides into the box, and rolls across 
for Martial, who can’t miss from eight yards. He cracks it with purpose past 
Adrian, and Old Trafford erupts!

61 min: Rooney and Mkhitaryan triangulate nicely down the middle. Rooney then 
tries to flick Martial clear down the left channel, but overcooks the pass and 
runs into Reid. He’s awarded a slightly generous free kick though. Perhaps the 
referee feels guilty about that booking. Anyway, Ibrahimovic hits a hard 
daisycutter of a free kick towards the bottom left, curling it around the wall. 
That’s a clever effort, though it doesn’t fox Adrian, who handles a hot potato 
well on the line.

58 min: Antonio has tweaked his groin, and is replaced by Lanzini. West Ham 
are having no luck with injuries at this ground, having lost Sakho the other 
day.

56 min: Ibrahimovic and Rooney combine well down the middle, a couple of crisp 
passes, and suddenly the ball’s slid towards Martial, who breaks into the area 
down the inside-left channel. He looks for the right-hand side of the net, but 
Adrian parries well. Martial was probably an inch or two offside there, but 
give the attacker the benefit, and all that. Anyway, no harm done.

55 min: Space for Masuaka down the left. He curls low and hard into the 
Manchester United area. Jones should easily clear, but takes a fresh-air waft 
instead. The ball works its way through to Feghouli at the far post, but from a 
tight angle all the West Ham man can do is fall over. Goal kick. But for all 
their dominance,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> don’t look completely 
composed at the back.

53 min: Free kick for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> out on the right. They 
load the box. Rooney flays a ludicrous effort high towards the Stretford End. 
Too much of the old Wonderfuel Gas in that. And it’s a bad couple of minutes 
for the home captain, who clatters into Fernandes and picks up a booking 
that’ll rule him out of the upcoming visit to, of all places, Everton. He is
livid. There wasn’t much in that challenge, but he needs to calm down.

51 min: Antonio hoicks a long ball down the right and backs himself to beat 
Blind. He does that, but Rojo comes across to slide the danger into touch in 
spectacular style. That’s a very enjoyable no-nonsense tackle.

GOAL! Manchester United 2-1 West Ham United (Martial 48)

A thoughtful first couple of minutes to the half. And then suddenly Payet 
shanks a clearance up the left. The ball’s headed back down the flank towards 
Valencia, who backheels neatly to release Mkhitaryan into the box. Mkhitaryan 
isn’t chased by Payet. He draws a couple of men, then rolls a pass inside for 
Martial, who opens up his body and sidefoots a blooter into the top left! So 
much for Manchester United’s mental block at Old Trafford! But that was very 
sloppy by West Ham, who haven’t really come out to play again yet.

45 min 05 sec: Kouyate rolls a lame pass back to Adrian, nearly allowing 
Ibrahomovic to start this half like he did the first. But he can’t quite get to 
the ball before the keeper. Kouyate has the good grace to hold his hand up and 
apologise. The hosts made one change at half-time, incidentally. Shaw, injured 
we hear, is replaced by Blind.

And we’re off again! This is going to be a fascinating second half, because 
you have to wonder whether Manchester United are developing a mental block at 
Old Trafford. Recent matches have seen them incapable of polishing off Stoke, 
Burnley and Arsenal when thoroughly dominant. They won’t want to add this 
League Cup quarter-final to that list. West Ham will be hoping a trend of their 
own continues, though: they were very good in the second half here on Sunday, 
and will fancy their chances if they put on another display like that. Like we 
were saying, in terms of narrative  story, it’s perfectly poised. West Ham get 
the party re-started.

HALF TIME: Manchester United 1-1 West Ham United

That half flew by, and it ends with a scoreline that doesn’t reflect the 
balance of play.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> were utterly dominant 
until David de Gea’s error. But the teams go in level. The home side will take 
succour from the manner in which they’ve played for the bulk of that half; the 
visitors from the way they held on and fought their way back into the tie. It’s 
poised perfectly. Another entertaining half of football, please!

44 min: Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> look collectively 
frustrated, which is hardly surprising given their dominance before the 
equaliser. Rooney clips Kouayte’s ankle, then Shaw argues needlessly over a 
throw in the midfield. The volume levels have dropped around the stadium, too, 
apart from one corner, where the Great West Ham Songbook is being flicked 
through with gusto.

The draw!
Manchester United v Hull City
Southampton v Liverpool

United and Saints will be at home in the first leg, to be played the week 
commencing January 9. Hull and Liverpool get their turn to host the week 
commencing January 23. A replay of the 1986/87 semi-final between Saints and 
Liverpool, then. United will be favourites for the trophy right now: it’s been 
a good evening for them!
 
And that’s the final kick of a comprehensive victory for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. The scoreline didn’t 
flatter them: in fact, it probably should have been more. But after repeatedly 
failing to finish teams off in the Premier League, they’ll take this. And they 
reach their 14th League Cup semi-final! They go into the hat with Southampton, 
who won tonight at Arsenal, plus Hull City and Liverpool. The draw’s coming up 
in a minute or two. Don’t go anywhere!
 
Herrera busies himself down the inside-left channel, beating three men and 
pulling the ball into the centre. In the middle, on the edge of the six-yard 
box, Ibrahimovic. He can’t miss, and ends the game as he started it!

90 min +2: West Ham have come alive, but it’s far too late. Kouyate reaches 
the by-line down the right and cuts back from Feghouli, who should get his shot 
from 12 yards on target, but blasts crazily over the bar instead.
 
90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Rashford comes on for 
Mkhitaryan. Then Feghouli finds a bit of space down the right and has a wild 
slash from the edge of the box. Nope.
 
90 min: Smiles all round back there, but Schweinsteiger gets serious, as he 
looks for the top right corner from 30 yards. Nowhere near, but hearty applause 
nonetheless.

89 min: Schweinsteiger touches the ball. Off comes the roof. Everyone enjoying 
themselves.
 
88 min: Fernandes has a lash from 25 yards, out on the right. The ball’s 
deflected off Jones, and out for a corner. It leads to nothing.Southampton beat 
Arsenal 2-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/30/arsenal-southampton-efl-cup-quarter-final-live>
, by the way.
 
86 min: The biggest roar of the evening, as two-goal hero Anthony Martial is 
replaced by Bastian Schweinsteiger. The German legend is a popular man around 
these parts, it would seem. What a warm welcome on his first appearance of the 
season!
 Schweinsteiger comes on. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  
84 min: Zaza wins a corner of Rojo. That’s a nice sentence to say out loud. 
People like to say salsa. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uub_Oqwefwc> The set 
piece, coming in from the left, should be met by Zaza, six yards out. But he 
only succeeds in heading thin air. A chance to launch an unlikely comeback 
spurned.
 
81 min: A brilliant effort by Ibrahimovic. On the left-hand corner of the 
six-yard box, he nutmegs Feghouli and curls one towards the bottom right, all 
in one sweet move. Adrian tips away from danger. “As a Liverpool fan I’m 
encouraged by West Ham’s defending but a little dispirited at Man United’s 
attacking verve,” writes Niall Mullen. “Aren’t they supposed to be a beaten 
docket?” As a rule, it’s best not to write offManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. Imagine what people 
were saying during the Herbert Bamlett era, for example, and look what happened 
in the four decades after that.
 Ibrahimovic, close. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  
79 min: Mkhitaryan has a dig from distance. The ball balloons off a West Ham 
defender and out for a corner on the right. Before Rooney takes it, he has a 
little argument with the linesman, over nothing it would seem. He’s in that 
sort of mood tonight. It’s almost as though he’s better when he’s close to 
boiling over. Anyway, the resulting set piece is a waste of time.
 
76 min: As Rooney is repaired, Zaza comes on for Payet, who has been strangely 
quiet tonight. Apart from the shot that led to West Ham’s goal, of course, but 
you get the general point.
 
74 min: Manchester United press West Ham back. Ibrahimovic and Rooney acting 
as proper pests, buzzing hither and yon, causing all sorts of trouble. Rooney 
takes a whack in the face from Reid. Totally accidental, but blood’s been 
drawn. The referee stops play. Rooney is livid. Does he want a penalty? Is he 
cross that the pressure’s been relieved? Either way, he nearly talks his way 
into a second yellow, before running to the sidelines to mop up the red.

72 min: Old Trafford falls a bit quiet during a midfield lull. The general 
mood suggests this is all over.
 
70 min: Kouyate earns a corner out on the right. Reid tries to connect with 
the set piece, ten yards out, but not for the first time tonight, a West Ham 
cross evades a team-mate’s noggin by inches.
 
68 min: Manchester United look confident and in control right now. Which, in 
fairness, they did at this point in the first half, before West Ham went on to 
level. But the visitors don’t look like they’ve got a dramatic two-goal 
comeback in them. Their passes aren’t sticking to feet.
 
66 min: West Ham look visibly deflated. On the touchline, Slaven Bilic has his 
hands thrust deep into his pockets, in the ‘Miffed’ style.
 
64 min: This is the sort of scoreline Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> deserved to take out 
of the first half. Only now do they have it. West Ham try to respond 
immediately, winning a corner down the left. But Payet, whose dead-ball efforts 
haven’t been so good tonight, can’t beat the first man.
 
The semi-finals beckon for Manchester Ujnited! Herrera, in the centre of the 
park on the right, passes inside for Ibrahimovic, who slide-rules a fine ball 
down the inside-right channel. Valencia strides into the box, and rolls across 
for Martial, who can’t miss from eight yards. He cracks it with purpose past 
Adrian, and Old Trafford erupts!

61 min: Rooney and Mkhitaryan triangulate nicely down the middle. Rooney then 
tries to flick Martial clear down the left channel, but overcooks the pass and 
runs into Reid. He’s awarded a slightly generous free kick though. Perhaps the 
referee feels guilty about that booking. Anyway, Ibrahimovic hits a hard 
daisycutter of a free kick towards the bottom left, curling it around the wall. 
That’s a clever effort, though it doesn’t fox Adrian, who handles a hot potato 
well on the line.
 
58 min: Antonio has tweaked his groin, and is replaced by Lanzini. West Ham 
are having no luck with injuries at this ground, having lost Sakho the other 
day.
 
56 min: Ibrahimovic and Rooney combine well down the middle, a couple of crisp 
passes, and suddenly the ball’s slid towards Martial, who breaks into the area 
down the inside-left channel. He looks for the right-hand side of the net, but 
Adrian parries well. Martial was probably an inch or two offside there, but 
give the attacker the benefit, and all that. Anyway, no harm done.

55 min: Space for Masuaka down the left. He curls low and hard into the 
Manchester United area. Jones should easily clear, but takes a fresh-air waft 
instead. The ball works its way through to Feghouli at the far post, but from a 
tight angle all the West Ham man can do is fall over. Goal kick. But for all 
their dominance,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> don’t look completely 
composed at the back.
 
53 min: Free kick for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> out on the right. They 
load the box. Rooney flays a ludicrous effort high towards the Stretford End. 
Too much of the old Wonderfuel Gas in that. And it’s a bad couple of minutes 
for the home captain, who clatters into Fernandes and picks up a booking 
that’ll rule him out of the upcoming visit to, of all places, Everton. He is
livid. There wasn’t much in that challenge, but he needs to calm down.
 
51 min: Antonio hoicks a long ball down the right and backs himself to beat 
Blind. He does that, but Rojo comes across to slide the danger into touch in 
spectacular style. That’s a very enjoyable no-nonsense tackle.
 
50 min: Slaven Bilic has a face on. And no wonder.
 
A thoughtful first couple of minutes to the half. And then suddenly Payet 
shanks a clearance up the left. The ball’s headed back down the flank towards 
Valencia, who backheels neatly to release Mkhitaryan into the box. Mkhitaryan 
isn’t chased by Payet. He draws a couple of men, then rolls a pass inside for 
Martial, who opens up his body and sidefoots a blooter into the top left! So 
much for Manchester United’s mental block at Old Trafford! But that was very 
sloppy by West Ham, who haven’t really come out to play again yet.

45 min 05 sec: Kouyate rolls a lame pass back to Adrian, nearly allowing 
Ibrahomovic to start this half like he did the first. But he can’t quite get to 
the ball before the keeper. Kouyate has the good grace to hold his hand up and 
apologise. The hosts made one change at half-time, incidentally. Shaw, injured 
we hear, is replaced by Blind.
 
And we’re off again! This is going to be a fascinating second half, because 
you have to wonder whether Manchester United are developing a mental block at 
Old Trafford. Recent matches have seen them incapable of polishing off Stoke, 
Burnley and Arsenal when thoroughly dominant. They won’t want to add this 
League Cup quarter-final to that list. West Ham will be hoping a trend of their 
own continues, though: they were very good in the second half here on Sunday, 
and will fancy their chances if they put on another display like that. Like we 
were saying, in terms of narrative  story, it’s perfectly poised. West Ham get 
the party re-started.

That half flew by, and it ends with a scoreline that doesn’t reflect the 
balance of play.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> were utterly dominant 
until David de Gea’s error. But the teams go in level. The home side will take 
succour from the manner in which they’ve played for the bulk of that half; the 
visitors from the way they held on and fought their way back into the tie. It’s 
poised perfectly. Another entertaining half of football, please!
 Will Rooney get his goal? Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters  
45 min: Cresswell can’t continue. He’s withdrawn in favour of Masuaku.
 
44 min: Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> look collectively 
frustrated, which is hardly surprising given their dominance before the 
equaliser. Rooney clips Kouayte’s ankle, then Shaw argues needlessly over a 
throw in the midfield. The volume levels have dropped around the stadium, too, 
apart from one corner, where the Great West Ham Songbook is being flicked 
through with gusto.
 
42 min: Cresswell is down, and doesn’t look very happy. The West Ham physio 
doing a lot of tugging and tweaking to his right leg. But he’s going to battle 
on to half time. Maybe.
