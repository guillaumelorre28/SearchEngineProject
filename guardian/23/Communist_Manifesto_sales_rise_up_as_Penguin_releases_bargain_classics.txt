In its first week, the new series has sold 70,545 copies, according to Nielsen 
BookScan, and Penguin is already reprinting another 100,000 copies, despite an 
initial print run of one million. The bestselling title to date is the Marx, 
said the publisher, followed by Jane Austen’s The Beautifull Cassandra, a 
collection of the novelist’s early writings, Edgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale 
Heart, andNietzsche 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/my-hero-nietzsche-geoff-dyer>’s 
Aphorisms on Love and Hate.

A new edition of selected poems by Emily Brontë is the series’ 10th-best 
seller. “I’m really pleased that Emily Brontë’s poems are doing so well – 
suddenly lots of people are reading these extraordinary poems, who wouldn’t 
have been likely to read her complete poems,” said publishing directorSimon 
Winder <http://www.foyles.co.uk/simon-winder>.

“There are an awful lot of writers who are really wonderful but quite 
intimidating – who really wants to read the whole of Samuel Pepys’s diary? But 
choosing the bit about the Great Fire of London – who wouldn’t want to read 
that?” Winder said.Penguin <https://www.theguardian.com/books/penguin> had 
tried, he added, to evoke a “pick-and-mix atmosphere, like Woolworths, almost, 
but with Dante” – whose Circles of Hell is the series’ eighth-best selling 
title.

At Waterstones, which has sold more than 30,000 of the titles in the past 
week, Joseph Knobbs said the lineup was “hard for a book-lover to walk past” 
without seeing something that might catch their eye.

“I also think everyone loves the idea of a rediscovered classic – the idea of 
writing that endures so strongly that it still can’t be ignored 100 years 
later. It feels like a guarantee that your time won’t be wasted,” Knobbs said.
