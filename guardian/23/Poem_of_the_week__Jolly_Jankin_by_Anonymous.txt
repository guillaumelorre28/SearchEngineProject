Jolly Jankin


‘Kyrie’, so ‘kyrie’,
Jankin syngeth merie
With ‘aleyson’.


As I went on Yole day
In our prosessyon
Knew I joly Jankin
Be his mery ton:
Kyrieleyson.


Jankin began the Offis
On the Yole day,
And yet me thynketh it dos me good,
So merie gan he say
‘Kyrieleyson’.


Jankin red the Pistil
Ful fair and ful wel,
And yet me thinketh it dos me good,
As ever have I sel.
Kyrieleyson.


Jankin at the Sanctus
Craketh a merie note,
And yet me thinketh it dos me good –
I payed for his cote.
Kyrieleyson.


Jankin craketh notes
An hundred on a knot,
And yet he hakketh hem smaller
Than wortes to the pot.
Kyrieleyson.


Jankin at the Angnus
Bereth the pax-brede,
He twynkeled, but sayd nought,
And on myn foot he trede.
Kyrieleyson.


Benedicamus domino,
Crist fro schame me schilde.
Deo gracias therto –
Alas, I go with childe!
Kyrieleyson.

This late medieval carol, by our old friend Anon, has a jaunty air – and 
probablywas, originally, a jaunty air. Melodious even without its vanished 
tune, Jolly Jankin reminds us that medieval verse was written to be heard. 
Literacy was rare. And reading aloud, privately or publicly, was a favourite 
pastime. “In all ranks of society, whether literate or not, it was customary 
for books to be read aloud,” write the editors of The Oxford Book of Medieval 
English Verse (1970). “Criseyde <http://www.librarius.com/troicris.htm>, though 
she knew how to read, had The Siege of Thebes read to her by a maid, presumably 
one with special skills. AtHavelok’s coronation 
<https://archive.org/stream/LayOfHavelokTheDane/LayHavelokDane_218pgs51175375_djvu.txt>
, professional entertainers regaled the public by ‘roman-reading on the book’.” 
Rhyme, rhythm and refrain, the three Rs of oral poetry, pleased the speaker’s 
tongue and the listener’s ear – and aided the memory of all participants.


 Because the verses have such a light touch, it’s hard to gauge how seriously 
anticlerical they are. Jankin is one of that breed of corrupt clerics whose 
stereotype was comedy gold for the medieval satirist. He may possibly be a 
Pardoner,as in Chaucer’s tale 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pardoner’s_Tale>. The poem’s narrator, 
perhaps to be identified with the “Alison” whose name gives rise to the merry 
pun on “eleison”, remarks at one point, “I payed for his cote”, an indication 
he could have tricked her into buying an overpriced indulgence. She exposes 
Jankin as a flirt and a fake, while apparently extolling his charms. She’s a 
knowing player in the poet’s comic cast.

 Jankin is portrayed as a performer, even though the performance is holy mass. 
Alison claims to be tickled pink by his florid, showy singing. But when he 
winks at her and treads on her foot, it’s clear his seduction technique is 
actually quite basic.

 The little adventure ends with Alison’s pregnancy. And this is probably part 
of the joke – not a good joke, if you’re the deserted woman, but a fitting 
conclusion to an unromantic tale of a pardoner and his mistress. Jolly Jankin 
is effective as a piece of bawdy, satirical entertainment. As a fallen woman’s 
lament, it’s not quite convincing.

 English patois and Latin mingled happily in medieval verse, as this 
interesting examination of the carol 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvkZv2_i7nMC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=medieval+carols+kyrie+so+kyrie+carol&source=bl&ots=1MIKd8WKNy&sig=OBWAx9FgCbwY4hxSFHGsiMRlDbY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibh7u9-fvQAhVEIMAKHUlaBmMQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=medieval%20carols%20kyrie%20so%20kyrie%20carol&f=false>
 and its historical context explains. Neatly woven into the verses, the 
fragments from the liturgy produce a dialogic effect, the Latin or Greek 
commenting on the English, or vice versa. In the opening chorus, “So” – used 
not as intensifier but to mean “thus” or “in this way” – separates the two 
Greek “Kyries” and amusingly draws attention to the clash of sacred/secular 
values.

 In the last verse, that quick switch from the Latin to the vernacular 
(“Benedicamus Domino, / Crist fro schame me schilde”) retains the narrative 
playfulness. “Let us bless the Lord, Christ shield me from shame” is a 
combination of opposite reactions, as well as different lexicons. They can 
coexist only in a comic partnership. The subtext hinted throughout is that this 
couple were getting up to no good while the mass was going on.

 You can imagine the medieval performer cracking the notes of Jolly Jankin 
with a virtuosity pitched towards farce, and his audience lustily chorusing the 
“Kyrieleisons”. More suited to the pagan carnival than the Christian festival, 
as a carol it has understandably faded from the repertoire. People generally 
prefer the sentimental Victorian evergreens, once-in-royalling and 
away-in-a-mangering till kingdom come. They have their place, but for me it’s 
the medieval carols that are thrilling. They sparkle with energy and freshness, 
like Buck’s Fizz on the morning after. And they connect us to the bright and 
bustling past, which should never, ever be dismissed as “another country”.

 Jolly Jankin epitomises the mixed-up informality of medieval religious 
manners. As the literary historian of the earlier link reminds us, “Dancing 
carols in the churchyard and oogling clerics in church were two activities 
medieval women were encouraged to confess.” You may be sure that, even if this 
particular Jankin and Alison were figments of a lively and blasphemous 
imagination, there were plenty of assignations in the festive air. As for the 
idea that the couple were at it during mass, I leave the last word on that to 
the mass-goers among us.

 Of course, the poem could have been intended as a moral warning. But nothing 
about its rhythm or language suggests a sermon, or even honest piety. I suspect 
it’s unadulterated mischief.
