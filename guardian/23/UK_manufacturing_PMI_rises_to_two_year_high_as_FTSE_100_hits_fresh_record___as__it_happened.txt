All the main sub-indices were strong. New export business rose for the seventh 
month in December. Companies secured new orders from the US, Europe, China, the 
Middle East, India and other Asian markets.

Employment rose for the fifth month in December, with the pace of jobs growth 
picking up to the fastest in 14 months, especially at smaller and medium-sized 
firms.

Rates of inflation for input costs and prices charged both remained among the 
fastest seen during the survey’s history, but slowed from October’s highs.

UK factories ended 2016 on a strong note, according to the Markit/CIPS 
manufacturing survey. The December reading of 56.1, a 30-month high, is up from 
53.6 in November and well above its long-run average of 51.5.

Rising domestic and overseas demand has boosted output and companies’ order 
books. Price pressures remained elevated but eased from recent highs.

Oil prices push higher

Oil prices are pushing higher this morning, helping underpin gains in the FTSE 
100. Brent crude is up 82 cents, or 1.4%, at $57.64, not far below the 2016 
high of $57.89, hit on 12 December. US light crude is trading 72 cents higher 
at $54.44, a 1.3% gain.

1 January marked the official start of a recently agreed deal between the oil 
cartel Opec and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8m 
barrels a day.

Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Reuters:

First signals suggest the Opec and non-Opec production cuts are raising hops 
that the global oil oversupply will diminish.

German unemployment falls more than expected

The number of unemployed people in Germany has fallen for a third month in a 
row, declining by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in December from the previous 
month to 2.638 million. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000.

Germany’s Federal Statistics Office also said that the jobless rate was 
unchanged at 6%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990.

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/record-sales-vinyl-hits-25-year-high-and-outstrips-streaming>
, as LPs continue their comeback.Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes: 

More than 3.2m LPs were sold last year, a rise of 53% on last year and the 
highest number since 1991 when Simply Red’s Stars was the bestselling album. 
This was also the first year that spending on vinyl outstripped that spent on 
digital downloads.

The deaths of some music world giants was a key driver in vinyl sales, as 
people invested in records as a mementos. After David Bowie’s death he became 
the bestselling vinyl artist of 2016, with five albums posthumously featuring 
in the top 30.

All the main sub-indices were strong. New export business rose for the seventh 
month in December. Companies secured new orders from the US, Europe, China, the 
Middle East, India and other Asian markets.

Employment rose for the fifth month in December, with the pace of jobs growth 
picking up to the fastest in 14 months, especially at smaller and medium-sized 
firms.

Rates of inflation for input costs and prices charged both remained among the 
fastest seen during the survey’s history, but slowed from October’s highs.
 Manufacturing PMI Photograph: IHS Markit  
UK factories ended 2016 on a strong note, according to the Markit/CIPS 
manufacturing survey. The December reading of 56.1, a 30-month high, is up from 
53.6 in November and well above its long-run average of 51.5.

Rising domestic and overseas demand has boosted output and companies’ order 
books. Price pressures remained elevated but eased from recent highs.
 
The UK manufacturing PMI has hit the highest level since June 2014, rising to 
56.1 – better than expected.
 
Oil prices are pushing higher this morning, helping underpin gains in the FTSE 
100. Brent crude is up 82 cents, or 1.4%, at $57.64, not far below the 2016 
high of $57.89, hit on 12 December. US light crude is trading 72 cents higher 
at $54.44, a 1.3% gain.

1 January marked the official start of a recently agreed deal between the oil 
cartel Opec and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8m 
barrels a day.

Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Reuters:

First signals suggest the Opec and non-Opec production cuts are raising hops 
that the global oil oversupply will diminish.

The number of unemployed people in Germany has fallen for a third month in a 
row, declining by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in December from the previous 
month to 2.638 million. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000.

Germany’s Federal Statistics Office also said that the jobless rate was 
unchanged at 6%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990.
