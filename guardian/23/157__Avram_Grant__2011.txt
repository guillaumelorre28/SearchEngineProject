Keith Hackett's verdict

1) It's an indirect free-kick to the defending side, and a yellow card for the 
striker for unsporting behaviour. There are two cautionable offences here – 
simulation (diving) and deliberate handball – but, while they were not 
simultaneous, they were effectively part of one action, so you should only show 
one yellow. In a situation where a second incident took place 2-3 seconds 
later, for instance during an advantage, you could show two yellows, then a red.
Thanks to Jakob Svedbom. 
2) There are two issues to address. First, send the player off for his 
offensive language: it does not necessarily need to be aimed at an opponent or 
an official for it to be a red card. Second, talk to the home team's manager 
and make sure the ballboys are either providing towels to both sides, or to 
neither. Third, make sure the boy is OK. And fourth, report what happened to 
the authorities after the game.
Thanks to Clive Evans. 
3) Play restarts with the original penalty – but neither of these players will 
have any part in it. Send the defender off for offensive and abusive language, 
and send the penalty taker off for violent conduct. The incident does not alter 
the way the game resumes.
Michal Sosnowski wins the shirt.
