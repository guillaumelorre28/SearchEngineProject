So long

Early I know, but the campaign is over for today, and I need to bid you 
farewell in order to finish recording this week’s campaign podcast episode. 
Thanks very much for your company today.

Love this picture from Mike Bowers. Natural disaster, meet travelling circus.

was ripped up by flooding. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
Let’s take stock of Thursday.

 * Hiatus of sorts. The leaders went to Tasmania to inspect the damage, and 
declined to take questions about the campaign. Both were asked questions about 
climate change and extreme weather.Malcolm Turnbull addressed the subject 
delicately by saying we needed to prepare for more forceful tempests;Bill 
Shorten said today wasn’t the day to join any dots. (Do voters really get 
cranky if you suggest climate change may the culprit when they are dealing with 
a natural disaster? Like, really?)

 * Sub leader, Labor moved to back in its arguments about the budget by 
turning attention to the Coalition’s black hole as a consequence of the $18bn 
in savings baked in to the budget that will never clear the Senate. The 
Coalition said what black hole? We’ll have a mandate to do these things if we 
win the election. Expect to hear more on this when normal campaign transition 
resumes.

That’s the main threads. It’s been real. See you in the morning.

Q: How disappointed are you or are you disappointed that you and Malcolm 
Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> couldn’t 
stand side by side today in Tasmania?

Bill Shorten:

It is good that the prime minister has been down to Tasmania today. I was 
happy to do something with him and I spoke to him a couple of times in the last 
couple of days. We have had courteous discussions – completely professional.

This is about us showing solidarity with people in distress. I think even in 
the rancour and competition of an election, this country and its major 
political parties are able to focus on what we have in common here. I just 
think that is healthy for Australian democracy full stop.

(Translation: I’m annoyed, frankly, but can’t say that.)

'Today for me is not a day where I will join the dots about extreme weather 
events ...'

Q: Do you believe we will see bigger and more frequent wild weather that we 
have experienced here as a result of climate change and do communities need to 
better prepare?

Bill Shorten won’t go there. The prime minister joined the dots earlier, 
carefully, but Shorten isn’t inclined to.

Bill Shorten:

Let me talk about preparation and mitigation. The levees which were being 
built and rebuilt inLaunceston <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/launceston> 
I have no doubt have avoided a much greater disaster. Flood mitigation is 
clearly a priority for all levels of government. It will help keep downward 
pressure on insurance costs. I think that governments need to start 
contemplating more flood mitigation rather than paying out more disaster relief 
because if you don’t do the flood mitigation, you will pay out the disaster 
relief. It has me thinking about how we can do much more in the space of flood 
mitigation.

In terms of climate and weather, today for me is not a day where I will join 
the dots about extreme weather events.

Today is more about being reminded about what makes this country one of the 
best places in the world.

Bill Shorten addresses reporters in Latrobe

The Labor leader is now addressing reporters after inspecting flood-damaged 
regions in Tasmania.

Bill Shorten:

We have seen houses flooded; we see cost going forward in the future. We see 
the inevitable debates with the insurance industry – but I am hearing positive 
things about how the insurance companies are going so far, which is fantastic. 
Most of all, what we see here is that the things that unite us are greater than 
the things that divide us.

Sticking with disclosure, the Greens have said today that reports involving 
Parakeelia (this is the data mining operation associated with theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> that has made 
donations to the Liberal party) underscore the need for a national corruption 
watchdog and political donation reform back on the agenda.

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale:

Revelations about the flow of money from Liberal MPs to Parakeelia and from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party demand investigation.

I said earlier today there are a lot of small issues bubbling around the 
campaign about donations and disclosure, but no big cut through on integrity 
reform. More’s the pity.

Some particulars on Tony Windsor’s claims. Windsor has accused Barnaby Joyce 
of a conflict of interest on water security, claiming the federalNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> took more than 
$80,000 in donations from mining company Santos after the water trigger 
legislation was introduced.

Windsor claimed since he introduced the water trigger legislation in 2011 to 
assess the impacts of large mining projects on water quality, a steady stream 
of donations from Santos to the National party began.

“There’s a very, very strange money trail that has developed in relation to 
Santos and the National party federally,” Windsor said outside his electoral 
office in Tamworth.

Windsor said Santos donated to the federal National party once in 2003 and 
again in 2009. However, after the water trigger legislation was introduced in 
2011, the company donated 18 times, amounting to $80,360.

According to Windsor, larger donations of $22,000 were given at the time of 
the 2013 federal election and in August 2014, when the environment ministerGreg 
Hunt’s legislation to throw out the water trigger  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/palmer-united-party-to-block-one-stop-shop-environmental-approvals>
was before the parliament.

Oh, poo

We really are in challenging territory today. Earlier on I mentioned that Tony 
Windsor, up north in New England, has been criticising political donations made 
by coal seam gas interests. Oh, poo, says the deputy prime minister. Literally. 
Thanks to AAP for these quotes.

Barnaby Joyce:

It’s a very sad poo-throwing exercise. It is sad and somewhat pathetic when 
the best we have is ... a doorstop about an allegation which even in their own 
statement they can’t give any details about.

Back to the sorry tale of the tampon tax. The post I shared a little while ago 
outlined the tale: Labor was into removing the GST from tampons, then last night
Bill Shorten said he wouldn’t remove the GST from tampons, then today Labor is 
saying it would like to remove the GST from tampons but the states won’t agree.

Of the three positions, the shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, is 
sticking with option three. From 3AW earlier today.

Q: Do you want to take it off or not?

Andrew Leigh:

We do. But we need the changes, we need the agreement of states and 
territories to make that change.

I’m with Andrew, says Scott Morrison, from Perth earlier today.

Q: Just on another matter, Andrew Hastie has been told his service with the 
army has been terminated as a reservist, because of not bringing down, 
campaigning in uniform. Do you have any thoughts about that?

Scott Morrison:

Andrew Hastie has served his country as a member of our defence force and as a 
member of our parliament exceptionally well. He is an extraordinary individual 
and I stand by Andrew 100%, as does the entire team. The thing about Andrew is 
he always takes responsibility for the decisions he makes. He considers them 
carefully and he has had the responsibility of leading men and women and the 
responsibility of very serious matters that he has had to deal with in his 
career in the defence force and I think that has well prepared him for the role 
he now takes on. He is an extraordinary Australian and I thank him and all 
other Australians who have served like him.

Q: So you think it was right for him to refuse to take down the campaign 
materials?

Scott Morrison:

I support Andrew and his decision.

The view from Redfern

Helen Davidson

“We vote too,” a coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups 
have warned both sides of politics. On Thursday dozens of Indigenous peak 
bodies and organisations released the 2016 Redfern statement, outlining their 
call for government action on Indigenous affairs, including health, justice and 
education.

They also called for the next government to reinstate the scrapped funding of 
the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, which the Indigenous 
affairs minister,Nigel Scullion, accused of being unrepresentative. 

“What we’ve got done here today has been a united voice where we all come 
together and we don’t want to be marginalised,”Jacqui Huggins, co-chair of the 
congress told media in Redfern.

“They’ve said to us and we say to government clearly: ignore us at your peril, 
because we vote too.”

The Redfern statement calls on government to reform health, justice and 
disability, and to commit to refunding the congress and establishing national 
Indigenous representative bodies for education, employment and housing.

It also called for reform of the much-maligned Indigenous advancement 
strategy, although Huggins said realistically the government needed to “go back 
to the drawing board” on how it distribute funding to Indigenous groups.

Government engagement with Indigenous groups was key, the group said, urging 
both parties to sit down with leaders and representatives.

“Engage with us in a very real and meaningful and genuine relationship that we 
have been screaming out for for years,” said Huggins.

Rod Little, fellow co-chair, said government and political cycles were a big 
factor.

“When there’s a change of government there’s a change of relationship every 
time. What we’re saying is we want a longer-term arrangement … with the 
parliament of Australia so we can look at some long-term, long-lasting 
arrangements that are going to benefit generations to come.”

Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice 
commissioner, said at the moment they didn’t have a relationship with 
government. “We need a relationship, whether it’s in the form of a treaty or 
not,” he said. “They’ve defunded [the] congress, the only representative 
organisation we have. That’s our organisation. They’ve appointed an Indigenous 
adviser council who only represent themselves – and they’ll tell you that. What 
we need is this relationship between our peoples and government, not with our 
peoples and government agencies and departments.”

Magic mandates, with Angus Taylor

Liberal Angus Taylor has just been on the ABC with one message about the 
economic contest: don’t you worry about that. And mandates make budget numbers 
work.

Q: People are attuned to the question of affordability and there are big 
promises being laid out, the biggest being the company tax cut that you have 
already mentioned. As a member of the government, can you guarantee that the 
surplus projected for 2021 will be delivered and that a re-elected Turnbull 
government is determined to stick with that surplus time line?

Angus Taylor:

What I can say is our promises are funded. That is the most important thing. 
We have seen a contrast yesterday where it is clear now from Chris Bowen that 
Labor’s promises are not funded and they will have a gap. There will be a black 
hole over the next four years ...

Q: How can you be so sure of that? Leaving aside the Labor focus for a moment, 
but there is a massive pod of $18bn worth of assumed savings that will just fly 
through the Senate, we’re led to believe. What gives you that confidence, when 
they have been so roundly rejected so far?

Angus Taylor:

The Australian people want to see action on these things. The frustration of 
the Australian people, after the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd experiment and the 
challenges we have had with minor parties in the Senate, there is a strong 
desire out there to see governments get on with the job ...

Q: You’re going to claim a mandate for each and every one of those 
initiatives, are you?

Angus Taylor:

We are asking for a mandate to do that. That is the purpose of this election. 
That is what we’re asking for right here right now. I think – look, Australians 
understand that we are the custodians of their tax payments. They want that 
managed well and that is exactly what we are going to the Australian people 
with in this election. We will manage their tax payments well. We will spend it 
in the right places. We are asking for a mandate in the House of Reps and the 
Senate to do exactly that.

Q: Even if magically and hypothetically the Senate passed all the $18bn worth 
of the initiatives, they are not worth $18bn anymore, are they? Some were to 
kick in from 1 July and they can’t probably until August or September, let’s 
presume. The budget repair work you might have done can’t be done because the 
numbers don’t stack up, do they?

Angus Taylor:

We are confident the numbers will stack up. There is no doubt about that. We 
are asking for a mandate in the Senate, no doubt about that.

(See, mandates, #magic.)

My colleague Greg Jericho has blogged on the economic contest today, four-year 
forecasts versus 10-year forecasts. His view is politicians would be better 
placed to keep their eye on the imperatives of the here and now.

Greg Jericho:

We have a situation where demand in the economy is at historic lows, national 
income growth is essentially at recession levels, inflation expectations remain 
very low and, as a result, wage growth is also expected to stay at record low 
marks.

And in this situation we have a central bank wary of using its main weapon to 
stimulate the economy.

So all eyes turn to the fiscal side.

But there we have the media going into conniptions over suggestions the budget 
deficit projected by the ALP in four years’ time might be larger than that of 
the LNP and where critics of plans to give big business a tax cut worth $8bn a 
year are called anti-business.

And now it seems the whole purpose of the budget is to retain a AAA credit 
rating.

I’m all for long-term thinking; I’m all for policy that is well thought out 
and planned. But right now both parties seem to have more of an eye on the 
horizon and are ignoring the rocks immediately ahead.

You can read Greg here.

I do need to address the vexed matter of the tampon tax. I was actually just 
working through a post when I saw this news report from AAP. I think this 
really tells you what you need to know, so take it away AAP.

There’s one thing clear about the so-called tampon tax: nobody really wants to 
go near it. The sensitive issue of the GST on women’s sanitary products has 
been given new life in the federal election campaign after disappearing from 
the radar in the past year.

It once made a treasurer blush and now it’s forced an opposition leader to 
backtrack. The Labor leader,Bill Shorten, reignited the debate after flatly 
ruling out scrapping the tax on the feminine goods when quizzed at a Brisbane 
voters’ forum on Wednesday night. “No,” he answered, insisting a straight 
answer was better than a murky one.

But a day later, the response turned into just that as the language become a 
tad cloudy. The Labor leader pointed the finger at the states. “Labor has 
always been open to removing the GST from sanitary items,” a spokesman for 
Shorten said. “If we can get the agreement of all jurisdictions and if an 
alternative revenue source can be identified.”

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, insisted that money from the so-called 
Netflix tax could have paid for removing the tampon tax, but the states refused 
that offer. “Bill was just making that clear last night,” he told ABC radio. He 
in turn pointed the finger at the former treasurer,Joe Hockey, for failing to 
push the point. For his part, Hockey also stumbled, blushed and grinned when 
asked about the tampon tax on the ABC’s Q&A program last year.

He agreed to lobby states to ditch the tax but in the end he too conceded it 
was an issue for the states and insisted nothing could be done.

 The Greens came out swinging at the major parties for their inaction, saying 
tampons and pads should never have been taxed because they are not luxury 
items. “It screams of policy created without enough women in the room,” the 
deputy leader,Larissa Waters, said.

'Use your voice and your vote'

Patrick McGorry wound up his address on this note:

Just to sum up, we have got to invest much more strongly if we are going to 
reap the human and economic benefits of mental wealth.

So just to recap, we are everywhere. We are everywhere in Australia. Every 
electorate, every marginal seat. I want to appeal to everyone affected directly 
or indirectly by mental illness, to expect a real plan. Don’t get sold short 
this time.

We haven’t been sold short in the last 10 years. We have been making progress. 
Don’t be fobbed off; don’t accept; don’t be short-changed.

Use your voice and your vote.

close  
Early I know, but the campaign is over for today, and I need to bid you 
farewell in order to finish recording this week’s campaign podcast episode. 
Thanks very much for your company today.

Love this picture from Mike Bowers. Natural disaster, meet travelling circus.

Let’s take stock of Thursday.

 * Hiatus of sorts. The leaders went to Tasmania to inspect the damage, and 
declined to take questions about the campaign. Both were asked questions about 
climate change and extreme weather.Malcolm Turnbull addressed the subject 
delicately by saying we needed to prepare for more forceful tempests;Bill 
Shorten said today wasn’t the day to join any dots. (Do voters really get 
cranky if you suggest climate change may the culprit when they are dealing with 
a natural disaster? Like, really?)

 * Sub leader, Labor moved to back in its arguments about the budget by 
turning attention to the Coalition’s black hole as a consequence of the $18bn 
in savings baked in to the budget that will never clear the Senate. The 
Coalition said what black hole? We’ll have a mandate to do these things if we 
win the election. Expect to hear more on this when normal campaign transition 
resumes.

That’s the main threads. It’s been real. See you in the morning.

Neither leader has addressed campaign issues today.
 
Q: How disappointed are you or are you disappointed that you and Malcolm 
Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> couldn’t 
stand side by side today in Tasmania?

Bill Shorten:

It is good that the prime minister has been down to Tasmania today. I was 
happy to do something with him and I spoke to him a couple of times in the last 
couple of days. We have had courteous discussions – completely professional.

This is about us showing solidarity with people in distress. I think even in 
the rancour and competition of an election, this country and its major 
political parties are able to focus on what we have in common here. I just 
think that is healthy for Australian democracy full stop.

(Translation: I’m annoyed, frankly, but can’t say that.)
 
Q: Do you believe we will see bigger and more frequent wild weather that we 
have experienced here as a result of climate change and do communities need to 
better prepare?

Bill Shorten won’t go there. The prime minister joined the dots earlier, 
carefully, but Shorten isn’t inclined to.

Bill Shorten:

Let me talk about preparation and mitigation. The levees which were being 
built and rebuilt inLaunceston <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/launceston> 
I have no doubt have avoided a much greater disaster. Flood mitigation is 
clearly a priority for all levels of government. It will help keep downward 
pressure on insurance costs. I think that governments need to start 
contemplating more flood mitigation rather than paying out more disaster relief 
because if you don’t do the flood mitigation, you will pay out the disaster 
relief. It has me thinking about how we can do much more in the space of flood 
mitigation.

In terms of climate and weather, today for me is not a day where I will join 
the dots about extreme weather events.

Today is more about being reminded about what makes this country one of the 
best places in the world.

regions in Tasmania.

Bill Shorten:

We have seen houses flooded; we see cost going forward in the future. We see 
the inevitable debates with the insurance industry – but I am hearing positive 
things about how the insurance companies are going so far, which is fantastic. 
Most of all, what we see here is that the things that unite us are greater than 
the things that divide us.
 
Sticking with disclosure, the Greens have said today that reports involving 
Parakeelia (this is the data mining operation associated with theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> that has made 
donations to the Liberal party) underscore the need for a national corruption 
watchdog and political donation reform back on the agenda.

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale:

Revelations about the flow of money from Liberal MPs to Parakeelia and from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party demand investigation.

I said earlier today there are a lot of small issues bubbling around the 
campaign about donations and disclosure, but no big cut through on integrity 
reform. More’s the pity.
 
Some particulars on Tony Windsor’s claims. Windsor has accused Barnaby Joyce 
of a conflict of interest on water security, claiming the federalNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> took more than 
$80,000 in donations from mining company Santos after the water trigger 
legislation was introduced.

Windsor claimed since he introduced the water trigger legislation in 2011 to 
assess the impacts of large mining projects on water quality, a steady stream 
of donations from Santos to the National party began.

“There’s a very, very strange money trail that has developed in relation to 
Santos and the National party federally,” Windsor said outside his electoral 
office in Tamworth.

Windsor said Santos donated to the federal National party once in 2003 and 
again in 2009. However, after the water trigger legislation was introduced in 
2011, the company donated 18 times, amounting to $80,360.

According to Windsor, larger donations of $22,000 were given at the time of 
the 2013 federal election and in August 2014, when the environment ministerGreg 
Hunt’s legislation to throw out the water trigger  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/palmer-united-party-to-block-one-stop-shop-environmental-approvals>
was before the parliament.

 
We really are in challenging territory today. Earlier on I mentioned that Tony 
Windsor, up north in New England, has been criticising political donations made 
by coal seam gas interests. Oh, poo, says the deputy prime minister. Literally. 
Thanks to AAP for these quotes.

Barnaby Joyce:

It’s a very sad poo-throwing exercise. It is sad and somewhat pathetic when 
the best we have is ... a doorstop about an allegation which even in their own 
statement they can’t give any details about.
 
Back to the sorry tale of the tampon tax. The post I shared a little while ago 
outlined the tale: Labor was into removing the GST from tampons, then last night
Bill Shorten said he wouldn’t remove the GST from tampons, then today Labor is 
saying it would like to remove the GST from tampons but the states won’t agree.

Of the three positions, the shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, is 
sticking with option three. From 3AW earlier today.

Q: Do you want to take it off or not?

Andrew Leigh:

We do. But we need the changes, we need the agreement of states and 
territories to make that change.
 
I’m with Andrew, says Scott Morrison, from Perth earlier today.

Q: Just on another matter, Andrew Hastie has been told his service with the 
army has been terminated as a reservist, because of not bringing down, 
campaigning in uniform. Do you have any thoughts about that?

Scott Morrison:

Andrew Hastie has served his country as a member of our defence force and as a 
member of our parliament exceptionally well. He is an extraordinary individual 
and I stand by Andrew 100%, as does the entire team. The thing about Andrew is 
he always takes responsibility for the decisions he makes. He considers them 
carefully and he has had the responsibility of leading men and women and the 
responsibility of very serious matters that he has had to deal with in his 
career in the defence force and I think that has well prepared him for the role 
he now takes on. He is an extraordinary Australian and I thank him and all 
other Australians who have served like him.

Q: So you think it was right for him to refuse to take down the campaign 
materials?

Scott Morrison:

I support Andrew and his decision.
 
“We vote too,” a coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups 
have warned both sides of politics. On Thursday dozens of Indigenous peak 
bodies and organisations released the 2016 Redfern statement, outlining their 
call for government action on Indigenous affairs, including health, justice and 
education.

They also called for the next government to reinstate the scrapped funding of 
the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, which the Indigenous 
affairs minister,Nigel Scullion, accused of being unrepresentative. 

“What we’ve got done here today has been a united voice where we all come 
together and we don’t want to be marginalised,”Jacqui Huggins, co-chair of the 
congress told media in Redfern.

“They’ve said to us and we say to government clearly: ignore us at your peril, 
because we vote too.”

The Redfern statement calls on government to reform health, justice and 
disability, and to commit to refunding the congress and establishing national 
Indigenous representative bodies for education, employment and housing.

It also called for reform of the much-maligned Indigenous advancement 
strategy, although Huggins said realistically the government needed to “go back 
to the drawing board” on how it distribute funding to Indigenous groups.

Government engagement with Indigenous groups was key, the group said, urging 
both parties to sit down with leaders and representatives.

“Engage with us in a very real and meaningful and genuine relationship that we 
have been screaming out for for years,” said Huggins.

Rod Little, fellow co-chair, said government and political cycles were a big 
factor.

“When there’s a change of government there’s a change of relationship every 
time. What we’re saying is we want a longer-term arrangement … with the 
parliament of Australia so we can look at some long-term, long-lasting 
arrangements that are going to benefit generations to come.”

Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice 
commissioner, said at the moment they didn’t have a relationship with 
government. “We need a relationship, whether it’s in the form of a treaty or 
not,” he said. “They’ve defunded [the] congress, the only representative 
organisation we have. That’s our organisation. They’ve appointed an Indigenous 
adviser council who only represent themselves – and they’ll tell you that. What 
we need is this relationship between our peoples and government, not with our 
peoples and government agencies and departments.”
 
Liberal Angus Taylor has just been on the ABC with one message about the 
economic contest: don’t you worry about that. And mandates make budget numbers 
work.

Q: People are attuned to the question of affordability and there are big 
promises being laid out, the biggest being the company tax cut that you have 
already mentioned. As a member of the government, can you guarantee that the 
surplus projected for 2021 will be delivered and that a re-elected Turnbull 
government is determined to stick with that surplus time line?

Angus Taylor:

What I can say is our promises are funded. That is the most important thing. 
We have seen a contrast yesterday where it is clear now from Chris Bowen that 
Labor’s promises are not funded and they will have a gap. There will be a black 
hole over the next four years ...

Q: How can you be so sure of that? Leaving aside the Labor focus for a moment, 
but there is a massive pod of $18bn worth of assumed savings that will just fly 
through the Senate, we’re led to believe. What gives you that confidence, when 
they have been so roundly rejected so far?

Angus Taylor:

The Australian people want to see action on these things. The frustration of 
the Australian people, after the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd experiment and the 
challenges we have had with minor parties in the Senate, there is a strong 
desire out there to see governments get on with the job ...

Q: You’re going to claim a mandate for each and every one of those 
initiatives, are you?

Angus Taylor:

We are asking for a mandate to do that. That is the purpose of this election. 
That is what we’re asking for right here right now. I think – look, Australians 
understand that we are the custodians of their tax payments. They want that 
managed well and that is exactly what we are going to the Australian people 
with in this election. We will manage their tax payments well. We will spend it 
in the right places. We are asking for a mandate in the House of Reps and the 
Senate to do exactly that.

Q: Even if magically and hypothetically the Senate passed all the $18bn worth 
of the initiatives, they are not worth $18bn anymore, are they? Some were to 
kick in from 1 July and they can’t probably until August or September, let’s 
presume. The budget repair work you might have done can’t be done because the 
numbers don’t stack up, do they?

Angus Taylor:

We are confident the numbers will stack up. There is no doubt about that. We 
are asking for a mandate in the Senate, no doubt about that.

(See, mandates, #magic.)
 
My colleague Greg Jericho has blogged on the economic contest today, four-year 
forecasts versus 10-year forecasts. His view is politicians would be better 
placed to keep their eye on the imperatives of the here and now.

Greg Jericho:

We have a situation where demand in the economy is at historic lows, national 
income growth is essentially at recession levels, inflation expectations remain 
very low and, as a result, wage growth is also expected to stay at record low 
marks.

And in this situation we have a central bank wary of using its main weapon to 
stimulate the economy.

So all eyes turn to the fiscal side.

But there we have the media going into conniptions over suggestions the budget 
deficit projected by the ALP in four years’ time might be larger than that of 
the LNP and where critics of plans to give big business a tax cut worth $8bn a 
year are called anti-business.

And now it seems the whole purpose of the budget is to retain a AAA credit 
rating.

I’m all for long-term thinking; I’m all for policy that is well thought out 
and planned. But right now both parties seem to have more of an eye on the 
horizon and are ignoring the rocks immediately ahead.

You can read Greg here.

I do need to address the vexed matter of the tampon tax. I was actually just 
working through a post when I saw this news report from AAP. I think this 
really tells you what you need to know, so take it away AAP.

There’s one thing clear about the so-called tampon tax: nobody really wants to 
go near it. The sensitive issue of the GST on women’s sanitary products has 
been given new life in the federal election campaign after disappearing from 
the radar in the past year.

It once made a treasurer blush and now it’s forced an opposition leader to 
backtrack. The Labor leader,Bill Shorten, reignited the debate after flatly 
ruling out scrapping the tax on the feminine goods when quizzed at a Brisbane 
voters’ forum on Wednesday night. “No,” he answered, insisting a straight 
answer was better than a murky one.

But a day later, the response turned into just that as the language become a 
tad cloudy. The Labor leader pointed the finger at the states. “Labor has 
always been open to removing the GST from sanitary items,” a spokesman for 
Shorten said. “If we can get the agreement of all jurisdictions and if an 
alternative revenue source can be identified.”

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, insisted that money from the so-called 
Netflix tax could have paid for removing the tampon tax, but the states refused 
that offer. “Bill was just making that clear last night,” he told ABC radio. He 
in turn pointed the finger at the former treasurer,Joe Hockey, for failing to 
push the point. For his part, Hockey also stumbled, blushed and grinned when 
asked about the tampon tax on the ABC’s Q&A program last year.

He agreed to lobby states to ditch the tax but in the end he too conceded it 
was an issue for the states and insisted nothing could be done.

 The Greens came out swinging at the major parties for their inaction, saying 
tampons and pads should never have been taxed because they are not luxury 
items. “It screams of policy created without enough women in the room,” the 
deputy leader,Larissa Waters, said.
 
Patrick McGorry wound up his address on this note:

Just to sum up, we have got to invest much more strongly if we are going to 
reap the human and economic benefits of mental wealth.

So just to recap, we are everywhere. We are everywhere in Australia. Every 
electorate, every marginal seat. I want to appeal to everyone affected directly 
or indirectly by mental illness, to expect a real plan. Don’t get sold short 
this time.

We haven’t been sold short in the last 10 years. We have been making progress. 
Don’t be fobbed off; don’t accept; don’t be short-changed.

Use your voice and your vote.
