It’s been done before, but rarely in such spectacular and dramatic fashion. 

Goalkeepers getting their name on the scoresheet is nothing new, but not often 
do they perfectly execute audacious 96th-minute overhead kicks – or celebrate 
quite like Oscarine Masuluke.

With his team trailing 1-0 and the South African top-flight match against 
Orlando Pirates deep into stoppage time, the Baroka FC custodian left his own 
box and raced forward in one final attempt to salvage something from the game.

As the corner came over, his opposite number punched clear; Masuluke was first 
to the loose ball and with his back to goal launched himself into the air to 
score the most spectacular of goals.

Delighted to have earned his side a draw, the ensuing celebration – as he led 
his team-mates in a dance towards the corner flag – nearly matched the goal for 
flare.

Justice Chabalala had put Orlando ahead just after the half-time break but 
Masuluke’s outrageous injury-time intervention ensured the home side emerged 
with a point.

Baroka sit 10th in the 16-team South African Premier Division. Orlando Pirates 
are sixth after 11 rounds of the competition.

It is not the first time a goalkeeper has scored with an overhead kick; most 
memorably, Alcudia’sBartolomé Barceló scored with a sensational effort

2013.

Manchester United’s Peter Schmeichel, who scored 11 times during his career, 
also found the back of the net with an overhead kick

against Wimbledon in 1997, only to see his effort chalked off for offside.
