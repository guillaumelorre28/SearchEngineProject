Johnny Otis (28 December 1921 – 17 January 2012)

The bandleader Johnny Otis, who has died aged 90, was one of the first white 
American musicians to cross the racial divide, aligning himself with the black 
community as a teenager and from then on regarding himself – and being treated 
as – a black man. He attracted many nicknames – among them the Duke Ellington 
of Watts, the Reverend Hand Jive and the Godfather of Rhythm andBlues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/blues> – and distinguished himself as a 
television host, political activist, preacher, cartoonist, painter, chef, 
record producer, talent scout, DJ, sculptor, writer and organic farmer.

Etta James (25 January 1938 – 20 January 2012)

Etta James <https://www.theguardian.com/music/etta-james>, who has died aged 
73 after suffering from leukaemia, was among the most critically acclaimed and 
influential female singers of the past 50 years, even if she never achieved 
huge popular success. From her first R&B hit, in 1955, the risqué Roll With Me 
Henry – cut when she was only 15 – through a series of classic 1960s soul sides 
(the lush ballad At Last, the raucous house rocker Tell Mama and the emotional 
agony of I'd Rather Go Blind), then a series of critically acclaimed 1970s and 
1980s albums that won her a broad rock audience, to more recent albums of jazz 
vocals, James proved capable of developing and changing as an artist.

Whitney Houston (9 August 1963 – 11 February 2012)

Few pop singers have been gifted with a voice as glorious as Whitney 
Houston's, and even fewer have treated their talent with the frustrating 
indifference she did toward the end of her life. She sold more records and 
received more awards than almost any other female pop star of the 20th century, 
but spent most of her last years mired in a drug addiction that sapped her will 
to sing and left her in a shambolic state.

The singer-songwriter Dory Previn, who has died aged 86, gained a significant 
following in the 1970s with her dark and honest view of life that drew on a 
troubled childhood, marriage difficulties and periods of mental illness. By 
then she had gained three Oscar nominations for lyrics – early signs of 
recognition in a career that soon took her on quite a different path.

Earl Scruggs (6 January 1924 – 28 March 28)

If Bill Monroe was the architect of bluegrass music, the banjo player Earl 
Scruggs, who has died aged 88, was his chief construction worker. Scruggs, who 
played with Monroe for three momentous years in the late 1940s, devised a 
picking method in which the thumb and two fingers of the right hand led a 
breathtaking dance, its leaps and rolls transforming the sound of the rural 
stringband into an intricately engineered high-performance music. Critics would 
call him the Segovia of the five-string banjo, the Paganini of bluegrass.

When Jim Marshall, who has died aged 88 of cancer, opened a music store in 
1960, his customers included some of rock'n'roll's most prominent guitarists. 
They wanted a new type of amplifier. Marshall seized the opportunity and built 
it for them. His work would earn him the nickname the Father of Loud.

A shorthand way of describing Levon Helm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/levon-helm>, who has died of cancer aged 71, 
would be as the drummer with the Band, who were Bob Dylan's backing group as he 
made the leap from folk to rock, and then forged a hugely influential career of 
their own in the late 1960s and 70s. This would have made Helm eminent enough, 
but his career stretched in many other directions, as drummer with the 
rock'n'roller Ronnie Hawkins, solo artist, prolific film actor and, most 
recently, host of the all-star Midnight Ramble Sessions. He was an accomplished 
multi-instrumentalist, and a fine and distinctive singer.

Bert Weedon (10 May 1920 – 20 April 2012)

The manual Play in a Day was the bible for generations of budding guitarists 
in the 1950s and 1960s. Its author was Bert Weedon, an unassuming dance-band 
musician whose unpatronising approach made him Britain's earliest expert on the 
instrumental niceties of rock'n'roll. Weedon, who has died aged 91, was among 
the first British musicians to incorporate into his style the innovations of 
American country and western, boogie and rock'n'roll guitarists.

Adam Yauch (5 August 1964 – 4 May 2012)

In his late teens, Adam Yauch - "MCA" of the Beastie Boys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beastie-boys> – did not look the type to be 
an effective rapper. When they met for the first time, Darryl McDaniels of 
Run-DMC suspected that he might be an actor put up by the TV show Candid 
Camera. How else could he account for a white performer who, along with his 
bandmates Mike "Mike D" Diamond and Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz, coupled the 
carefree character of punk with the clownish one-upmanship of hip-hop?

Though she will be remembered for disco classics such as Love to Love You Baby 
and I Feel Love,Donna Summer <https://www.theguardian.com/music/donna-summer>, 
who has died of cancer aged 63, notched up many achievements in a career 
lasting more than 40 years. She recorded three multi-platinum albums and three 
consecutive double albums topping the US chart. She reached a commercial peak 
in the late 1970s with a string of chart-topping singles, including a duet with 
Barbra Streisand on No More Tears (Enough Is Enough), and was able to bounce 
back from a subsequent slump with hit records in succeeding decades. She also 
branched out into television, with appearances on America's Got Talent and the 
reality show Platinum Hit.

Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dietrich-fischer-dieskau>, the distinguished 
German baritone, has died aged 86. His protean career was surely unique, as he 
sang and recorded more vocal music than any who came before. In particular, he 
broached more lieder (German songs) than any of his predecessors of the genre, 
his recordings running into the hundreds. Many of these songs he recorded 
several times over: for instance, he made no fewer than eight recordings of 
Schubert's Winterreise.

in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. Robin also charted intermittently

For almost 50 years, Doc Watson, who has died aged 89, was the most 
illustrious name in traditional American folk music. A superb, original 
guitarist and a singer of warmth and simplicity, he set countless musicians on 
the road to careers in folk music. Probably no folk performer of his time has

In 1949, the Jamaican tenor saxophonist Andy Hamilton, who has died aged 94, 
faced a dilemma. As a musician he had reached the top, entertaining Noël Coward 
and friends at the Titchfield hotel in Port Antonio, then hired as a bandleader 
by the actor Errol Flynn for parties on his yacht, but his personal life was in 
crisis and he needed to escape. He joined others of his generation by moving to 
Britain, where he became a celebrated jazzman and prominent figure in the fight

Mehdi Hassan, who has died aged 84, was the Indian subcontinent's outstanding 
male exponent of the ghazal, a form of sung Urdu lyric verse, set to the 
appropriate raga melodies. Urdu poetry, which springs from the Persian, is 
filled with pathos, yearning, political and social injustice, loss, unrequited 
love and pleasure. Hassan evoked these with rare mastery, which is why devotees 
and eager students flocked to hear him from far and wide. It is claimed that he 
sang more than 50,000 ghazals during his lifetime, becoming known as the 
"emperor of the ghazal".

The saxophonist Lol Coxhill, who has died aged 79, was one of the great 
characters of British music – generous, gifted and amiably eccentric. He had 
long been a stalwart of the European jazz and improvised music scene, but he

Afro-Cuban, R&B, soul, progressive, punk, minimalist, electronic and beyond –

it was David's words as much as Bacharach's melodies that captured an audience 
for such songs as Anyone Who Had a Heart, I Say a Little Prayer, Walk on By, 
(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me, Alfie, Trains and Boats and 
Planes, (They Long to Be) Close to You, Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head and

When people think of Joe South, they generally think first of Games People 
Play, one of the most successful protest-related songs of the late 1960s, with 
its distinctive electric sitar accompaniment, played by the singer and composer 
himself, and a bitingly prescient lyric directed at pseudo-hippy types who

flowers / In the back of a black limousine."

recording-session musicians who accompanied the solo singers of the era and 
were frequently enlisted to improve the efforts of well-known pop groups. The 
principal guitarists of this elite team were Jimmy Page (later of Led Zeppelin) 
and Big Jim Sullivan, who has died aged 71 of complications from heart disease

The American composer Elliott Carter, who has died aged 103, was, apart from 
Pierre Boulez, the last survivor of the heroic age of postwar musical 
modernism, and perhaps its greatest exponent. In the 1950s, when Carter wrote

that age was in full flood. By the time he wrote his playful late masterpieces, 
it had long since passed into history.

message. In terms of international profile and honours, Harvey's status was 
almost on a par with his slightly older colleagues Harrison Birtwistle and 
Peter Maxwell Davies. While they have always been in the news, thanks to their
