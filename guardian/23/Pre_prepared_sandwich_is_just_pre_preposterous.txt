Congratulations on your editorial finesse. Page 4 of last Friday’s Guardian 
had photos of two Greens. One was aknighted establishment figure who sold a 
high street chain store 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/philip-green-knighthood-integrity-bhs-john-collins-forfeiture-committee>
 after taking out millions of pounds in dividends, leaving a massive pensions 
hole in a firm that has now collapsed, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The other 
is an elected member of parliament. Onlyone of these Greens has been spied on 
by the police

. Is this what is meant by a democratic deficit?

• If the junior doctors’ strike is today’s miners’ strike (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/25/junior-doctors-strike-defeated-jeremy-hunt>
, 26 April) then lessons can be learned from the past. The miners lost thanks 
to lack of support from the trade unions; this must not be allowed to happen 
again. The unions must now fully get behind the junior doctors and threaten 
industrial action on a mass scale. The Tories view the NHS and its staff as 
commodities to be sold off. If the junior doctors lose, we’ll be one step 
further to losing our NHS for good.

• I saw nine tautologies in your article (Has M&S gone too far with its 
pre-cut avocado? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/apr/26/marks-and-spencer-pre-cut-avocado-outrage>
, G2, 27 April). Every time I read “pre-peeled” or “pre-diced” I shuddered, and 
by the sixth paragraph a nervous tic had developed. A “pre-peeled banana” is a 
peeled banana. A “pre-sliced avocado” is a sliced avocado. “Prepared sandwich” 
would be bad enough; it’s obviously been prepared, as it exists. To go one 
stage further and call it a “pre-prepared sandwich” is just pre-preposterous.

• “My family values: Jane Fonda, Actress” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/29/my-family-values-jane-fonda-actress-henry-fonda>
 (Family, 30 April). Wow. When was the last time the word “actress” slipped 
past the Guardian style guide police?

• What a consummate politician Nicola Sturgeon is. In the photo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/01/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-election-snp>
 used with your article (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/what-next-for-nicola-sturgeon-and-the-snp>
, 29 April), the baby is kissing her and she doesn’t have to kiss it.
