 Urged on by the United States and a confederation of five South American 
states, the warring nations of Bolivia and Paraguay accepted a truce here 
today, bringing to a halt the three-year long Chaco War.
The war, which has claimed 35,000 victims, has been fought over the ownership 
of the Chaco Boreal, a wasteland of some 100,000 square miles west of the 
Paraguay river, the subject of a dispute betweenParaguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paraguay> and Bolivia since 1825.

Bolivia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia>, deprived of its coastal 
territories since the war of the Pacific, wanted to use the Chaco as a shipping 
route for its oil exports. It also hoped to exploit the oil reserves of the 
Chaco itself.

 Bolivian troops invaded in 1928, but a Pan-American conference averted 
outright war. Skirmishes continued until 1932 when Paraguay launched a major 
offensive, and formally declared war in May 1933. The Bolivian army, larger and 
better trained, fought back successfully, but in 1934 the Paraguayan offensive 
reversed the position, capturing much Bolivian land.

This tit-for-tat sequence came to an end today when the two sides, wearied by 
war, accepted the ceasefire.
