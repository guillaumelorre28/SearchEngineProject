GOAL! USA 0-4 Argentina (Higuaín, 86 min)

An egregiously poor giveaway by the USA

Easily intercepted by Messi, who slots a pass to Higuaín, whose clinical finish 
makes it 4-0.

83 min: Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> on the 
counter and it’s Messi leading the charge. He carries into the area and uncorks 
a left-footed shot to the far post that forces Guzan to lay out for a save. 
It’s out for a corner.

80 min: Dagbe on for Dempsey, the United States’ final sub. As Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> continue to turn the screw, 
here’s a note on the commentary from Matthew, via email.

More insightful commentary from Landon Donovan here on the US/Fox broadcast: 
“I’ve always said that goals change games, at 1-0, 2-0...”

Thanks for that, Landon. 

He might instead have noted that, so far, our only capable fullback has been 
the signboard.

Gonna call it a win at this point if the US take a single shot (on target 
preferable but not necessary).

70 min: The scathing indictments keep coming in, this one from Brian Doll, via 
email.

I can’t believe I’m going to say this but I miss the days when the US just sat 
back were organized played tough hard defensive football and looked to nick a 
goal on a set piece. Can’t even string three passes together. Northern Ireland 
looked a million times better against Germany today and I think on paper the 
rosters are pretty even

Oh, those halcyon days. And you’re probably right on the last point.

serious injury. He was unable to brace himself for the fall. TheArgentina

52 min: A note from Ricky Gill, via email.

Michael Bradley has shown today why no one rates him outside of the MLS. Not 
to mention, the Americans have been far happier playing the man than the ball 
and are probably lucky to still have 11 on the field. That being said, I’m 
thoroughly looking forward to more of Messi at work in 2nd half.

Can’t say I disagree on Bradley on tonight’s body of work.

GOAL! USA 0-3 Argentina (Higuaín, 50 min)

The ball is sent through to Higuaín alone in the area. Guzan makes a brilliant 
save off the initial effort, but the Napoli striker is there to pounce on the 
rebound and punch it into the goal. It’s Higuaín’s second goal in three games 
and surely the United States are finished now.
 Higuaín makes it three for Argentina

Here are some of your thoughts from the first half.

A note from Tony Bellew, hopefully that Tony Bellew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/tony-bellew-wbc-world-cruiserweight-title-win-goodison-park>
, via email:

That would have been a red card in rugby! An absolute coat hanger on Lavezzi.

Here’s one from Michael Brenner, via email:

No disgrace for TEAM USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
...

Using a tennis analogy - when top seed and world’s best Novak Djokovic suits 
up against the 25th ranked player @ Wimbledon - it is just a question of how 
soon the 3 sets will be over. No difference here on the soccer field - TEAM USA 
play to their rankings and no surprise or disgrace for them not to triumph over 
the # 1 seed.

Here’s Barrett Madden, via email:

Gotta say I disagree on the Guzan/Lavezzi play. I thought Lavezzi deserved 
yellow for endangering our keeper by playing on after the whistle had long gone.

And a dissenting view from Sam Abrahams, via email:

“Looked a bit intentional”????

That’s a straight red. I mean, a bit of a straight red.

Enjoy the trouncing :)

Half-time: USA 0-2 Argentina

It’s been all Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>. 
Frankly, the 2-0 scoreline flatters the USA, who, yes, are undermanned, but who 
also failed to answer the bell. Only 45 minutes in and we’re already on to the 
Big Questions.

45 min+1: Lavezzi sent through and he’s wide open with only Guzan between him 
and the goal but the offside flag is up. Some contact between Guzan and Lavezzi 
and the Argentine forward goes down in a heap! Looked a bit intentional by the 
frustratedUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> keeper but 
he gets off without a booking.

35 min: Chris from Cork dropping truth bombs, via email.

Dempsey could quite easily have been given a red for that flailing elbow. 
Still, 2-0. Onwards and upwards.

You’re right, Chris. Here’s a look at the play.

GOAL! USA 0-2 Argentina (Messi, 32 min)

Messi takes the kick and it soars directly into the top-right corner of the 
goal past the fully extended Guzan. Beautifully struck, a sensational goal. And 
with it, Messi eclipses Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina’s all-time leading 
goalscorer.
 Messi doubles Argentina’s lead

27 min: Clint Dempsey, last seen on the side of a milk carton and without a 
touch so far tonight (as far as I can remember), drops Mascherano with a high 
elbow to the neck and he’s down near the halfway line. Paraguayan referee 
Enrique Caceres gives Dempsey a stern warning but doesn’t show a card.

21 min: A free kick for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> in a dangerous place as 
Lavezzi is hacked down. It’s taken quickly – Perhaps prematurely? Did that 
whistle come from the referee or the stands? – but after the goal attempt is 
cleared the US take over possession.
Michael Davies (@embassydavies) 
Other than the goal and the total Argentinian domination this has been very 
even.

the area but the American keeper makes the save.

possession and making the US players chase. A through ball to Messi but Zardes 
makes a last-gasp slide to deflect it away.

8 min: Messi pulling the strings from the top of the area, the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> back four in disarray. A 
series of short passes and the ball is returned to Messi as he slashes toward 
the near post, but his left-footed shot is sent wide of the target. Goal kick.

GOAL! USA 0-1 Argentina (Lavezzi, 3 min)

Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> have kept 
possession nearly from kickoff. Messi receives it in acres of space and chips 
it forward to Lavezzi, but it’s cleared past the goal line for a corner. The 
corner is taken short and another chipped through ball is deflected, but it 
falls to Lavezzi and he heads it beautifully into the back of the goal. A 
nightmare start for the United States!

Our Tom Dart is on the ground in Houston. He’s sent along the following 
dispatch.

It’s the sort of hot and humid, stepping-into-a-shower summer’s day that 
Houston specialises in, with the threat of showers to boot. Not that it matters 
to either team, because NRG Stadium’s roof is closed and its air conditioning 
is well-equipped to handle the Texas climate.

The quality of the playing surface is more open to question: it’s grass laid 
out on pallets over the artificial surface used by the Houston Texans NFL team. 
While temporary grass fields have caused problems in the US in the past, they 
haven’t been much of an issue so far in this tournament here, though this will 
be the third game and there were a couple of signs in last week’s Mexico vs 
Venezuela group match that the ball wasn’t rolling quite the way that some 
players were expecting.

As for NFL games, fans began tailgating in the prairie-sized parking lots 
hours before kickoff. There was a good-natured incursion by a few dozenArgentina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> fans - some waving 
blue-and-white umbrellas - into an area populated by the American Outlaws 
supporters group, leading to duelling chants of “Olé! Olé! Olé!” and “U-S-A, 
U-S-A!”

Josue Sanchez, who made the 200-mile drive from San Antonio, stood on the 
fringes of the rally with Clint Dempsey. Or at least, a larger-than-life 
“Deuce-face” cut-out of the US’s star forward and son of Nacogdoches, TX.

Dempsey has three goals so far in the tournament. How many more tonight? 
“Realistically, hopefully two,” Sanchez said. “He’s back in his home state of 
Texas, so I think he’s going to put on a show for Texas.”

Now for a look into the crystal ball. And it’s not pretty. Here’s a note from 
Michael Philip, via email.

6 or 7 Argentine goals, this is going to be cruel and the US can go back to 
games only they play…

Tonight’s lineups are already generating discussion. Here’s a note from Daniel 
Stauss, via email.

Messi, Higuain, Lavezzi, Dempsey, Wondolowski. one of these names is not like 
the others, one of these manners just doesn’t belong. At least Clint won’t be 
totally stranded up top, maybe Wondo can stumble around in front of Otamendi 
and distract him a little.

The teams

Hello and welcome to tonight’s Copa América semi-final between the United 
States and Argentina. Kickoff is roughly 40 minutes away at Houston’s NRG 
Stadium and the sides have just taken the pitch for pre-match warmups. 
Argentina are clear favorites, but Jürgen Klinsmann’s men will no doubt be 
looking tostir up the echoes of 1995 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/copa-america-usa-argentina-1995>
.

Plenty more to come ahead of tonight’s match starting with the team 
information. Stand by.

game:

After USA beat Ecuador and Argentina swept past Venezuela, the two teams will 
meet in the Copa America semi-finals on Tuesday night, with Argentina firm 
favorites to advance to the final (and indeed win the whole tournament.) But 
what can Jürgen Klinsmann do to stop them? And just as importantly can they do

close  
And there’s the final whistle. Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> advance to face the winner of 
Wednesday’s match between Colombia and Chile in Sunday’s final. Meanwhile, the 
United States will face tomorrow’s loser in Saturday’s third-place match in 
Glendale. Let the post-mortems begin.
 
90 min+2: Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> just 
kicking it about the pitch, generally unmolested.
 
90 min: Three minutes of added time. It will all be over soon.
 
An egregiously poor giveaway by the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> in their own third. 
Easily intercepted by Messi, who slots a pass to Higuaín, whose clinical finish 
makes it 4-0.
 Higuaín scores a second  
83 min: Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> on the 
counter and it’s Messi leading the charge. He carries into the area and uncorks 
a left-footed shot to the far post that forces Guzan to lay out for a save. 
It’s out for a corner.
 
80 min: Dagbe on for Dempsey, the United States’ final sub. As Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> continue to turn the screw, 
here’s a note on the commentary from Matthew, via email.

More insightful commentary from Landon Donovan here on the US/Fox broadcast: 
“I’ve always said that goals change games, at 1-0, 2-0...”

Thanks for that, Landon. 

He might instead have noted that, so far, our only capable fullback has been 
the signboard.
 
77 min: The US charge up the right flank and it’s swung in to Pulisic ... who 
passes up a shot. Oh well. Quick counter forArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> but Lamela’s shot is off 
target.
 
74 min: It’s the moral victories.
Dave Zeitlin (@DaveZeitlin) 
Gonna call it a win at this point if the US take a single shot (on target 
preferable but not necessary).
 <https://twitter.com/DaveZeitlin/status/745445686850707457> June 22, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/DaveZeitlin/status/745445686850707457>  
70 min: The scathing indictments keep coming in, this one from Brian Doll, via 
email.

I can’t believe I’m going to say this but I miss the days when the US just sat 
back were organized played tough hard defensive football and looked to nick a 
goal on a set piece. Can’t even string three passes together. Northern Ireland 
looked a million times better against Germany today and I think on paper the 
rosters are pretty even

Oh, those halcyon days. And you’re probably right on the last point.
 
67 min: The US win their first corner of the match and on comes Lamela for the 
injured Lavezzi. Bradley’s corner goes directly into the keeper’s hands and 
he’d rid of it quickly andArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are on the counter! Messi’s 
shot is blocked but it’s out for a corner.
 
66 min: Messi is on the charge and tries to slip a through pass to Mascherano 
in the area, but he can’t run onto it in time. Meanwhile, Lavezzi is being 
wheeled to the locker room and they’ve yet to replace him.
 
63 min: Lavezzi leaps to head a ball near the touchline but falls over the 
electronic advertising board and, oh dear, it looks like he’s suffered a 
serious injury. He was unable to brace himself for the fall. TheArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> players and the medical staff 
all sprint over. And out comes a gurney. Fortunately, Lavezzi by now is on his 
feet and seems to be examining his wrist.
 
61 min: Rojo is down and the medical staff is out for treatment. While we wait 
for play to resume, a response from Paul Berry, via email.

In response to Ricky Gill, how dare he insult MLS supporters by saying we rate 
Michael Bradley.

Knives out.
 
60 min: Two switches at the hour mark. For Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>, Biglia replaces Fernandez. 
For the United States, Birnbaum comes on for Beckerman.
 
56 min: During a stoppage in play, it occurs to me the two best teams in 
Concacaf trail by a combined 10-0 scoreline against the two best teams from 
Conmebol over the last match and a half.
 
52 min: A note from Ricky Gill, via email.

Michael Bradley has shown today why no one rates him outside of the MLS. Not 
to mention, the Americans have been far happier playing the man than the ball 
and are probably lucky to still have 11 on the field. That being said, I’m 
thoroughly looking forward to more of Messi at work in 2nd half.

Can’t say I disagree on Bradley on tonight’s body of work.
 
The ball is sent through to Higuaín alone in the area. Guzan makes a brilliant 
save off the initial effort, but the Napoli striker is there to pounce on the 
rebound and punch it into the goal. It’s Higuaín’s second goal in three games 
and surely the United States are finished now.
 Higuaín makes it three for Argentina  
46 min: And we’re off and running in the second half. The youngster Christian 
Pulisic replaces Chris Wondolowski for the United States.
Tyler Duffy (@tyduffy) 
Wondo went as well as literally everyone expected.

<https://twitter.com/tyduffy/status/745439191681503232>  
Here are some of your thoughts from the first half.

A note from Tony Bellew, hopefully that Tony Bellew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/tony-bellew-wbc-world-cruiserweight-title-win-goodison-park>
, via email:

That would have been a red card in rugby! An absolute coat hanger on Lavezzi.

Here’s one from Michael Brenner, via email:

No disgrace for TEAM USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
...

Using a tennis analogy - when top seed and world’s best Novak Djokovic suits 
up against the 25th ranked player @ Wimbledon - it is just a question of how 
soon the 3 sets will be over. No difference here on the soccer field - TEAM USA 
play to their rankings and no surprise or disgrace for them not to triumph over 
the # 1 seed.

Here’s Barrett Madden, via email:

Gotta say I disagree on the Guzan/Lavezzi play. I thought Lavezzi deserved 
yellow for endangering our keeper by playing on after the whistle had long gone.

And a dissenting view from Sam Abrahams, via email:

“Looked a bit intentional”????

That’s a straight red. I mean, a bit of a straight red.

Enjoy the trouncing :)
 
It’s been all Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>. 
Frankly, the 2-0 scoreline flatters the USA, who, yes, are undermanned, but who 
also failed to answer the bell. Only 45 minutes in and we’re already on to the 
Big Questions.
Alecko Eskandarian (@alecko11) 
Not by creating false expectations in the pregame show. We don't have one 
player that would make Argentina's roster.https://t.co/H5oO6CZsKj

<https://twitter.com/alecko11/status/745431425176997888>  
45 min+1: Lavezzi sent through and he’s wide open with only Guzan between him 
and the goal but the offside flag is up. Some contact between Guzan and Lavezzi 
and the Argentine forward goes down in a heap! Looked a bit intentional by the 
frustratedUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> keeper but 
he gets off without a booking.
 
45 min: One minute of added time. 
 
42 min: Moments after the Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> corner is cleared, a long ball 
is sent to Yedlin and the USA are on a rare trip into the final third. It’s a 
short one.
 
40 min: Lavezzi wins a corner off Yedlin and Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> are pressuring again.
 
35 min: Chris from Cork dropping truth bombs, via email.

Dempsey could quite easily have been given a red for that flailing elbow. 
Still, 2-0. Onwards and upwards.

You’re right, Chris. Here’s a look at the play.
Univision Deportes (@UnivisionSports)

<https://twitter.com/UnivisionSports/status/745430025717964800>  
Messi takes the kick and it soars directly into the top-right corner of the 
goal past the fully extended Guzan. Beautifully struck, a sensational goal. And 
with it, Messi eclipses Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina’s all-time leading 
goalscorer.
 Messi doubles Argentina’s lead  
31 min: Wondolowski gives it away far too easily. Messi charging toward the 
goal and Wondolowski bumps him to the grass with his hip. A yellow card but a 
necessary foul. Free kick toArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> from about 24 yards out. Messi 
kneels to tie his shoes ...
 
27 min: Clint Dempsey, last seen on the side of a milk carton and without a 
touch so far tonight (as far as I can remember), drops Mascherano with a high 
elbow to the neck and he’s down near the halfway line. Paraguayan referee 
Enrique Caceres gives Dempsey a stern warning but doesn’t show a card.
 
24 min: Every cloud ...

21 min: A free kick for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> in a dangerous place as 
Lavezzi is hacked down. It’s taken quickly – Perhaps prematurely? Did that 
whistle come from the referee or the stands? – but after the goal attempt is 
cleared the US take over possession.
Michael Davies (@embassydavies) 
Other than the goal and the total Argentinian domination this has been very 
even.

<https://twitter.com/embassydavies/status/745426895047532547>  
18 min: Argentina win a free kick. It’s taken quickly by Mascherano, but 
intercepted by a USA player.Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> pressing very high and so far 
it’s worked, keeping the hosts on the back foot and generally unable to sustain 
anything resembling an attack.
 
15 min: The USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> string 
together six short passes in an attempt to work it up the left flank but are 
quickly dispossessed and all of a sudden it’s Messi running full speed with the 
ball toward Guzan. He uncorks a left-footed shot with pace from just outside 
the area but the American keeper makes the save.
 
12 min: Argentina really turning the screws over the past few minutes, keeping 
possession and making the US players chase. A through ball to Messi but Zardes 
makes a last-gasp slide to deflect it away.
 
8 min: Messi pulling the strings from the top of the area, the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> back four in disarray. A 
series of short passes and the ball is returned to Messi as he slashes toward 
the near post, but his left-footed shot is sent wide of the target. Goal kick.
 
7 min: USA win a free kick. Michael Bradley to take it. It’s short and easily 
cleared.
 
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> have kept 
possession nearly from kickoff. Messi receives it in acres of space and chips 
it forward to Lavezzi, but it’s cleared past the goal line for a corner. The 
corner is taken short and another chipped through ball is deflected, but it 
falls to Lavezzi and he heads it beautifully into the back of the goal. A 
nightmare start for the United States!
 Argentina strike early  
1 min: And they’re off! The United States in white shirts with blue trim and 
white shorts attacking from left to right,Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> in all-navy strips.

Anthem time in Houston. First it’s Himno Nacional Argentino, then a deafening 
rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner as tens of thousands of voices ring out 
throughout the stadium. Not much longer now.
 
Our Tom Dart is on the ground in Houston. He’s sent along the following 
dispatch.

It’s the sort of hot and humid, stepping-into-a-shower summer’s day that 
Houston specialises in, with the threat of showers to boot. Not that it matters 
to either team, because NRG Stadium’s roof is closed and its air conditioning 
is well-equipped to handle the Texas climate.

The quality of the playing surface is more open to question: it’s grass laid 
out on pallets over the artificial surface used by the Houston Texans NFL team. 
While temporary grass fields have caused problems in the US in the past, they 
haven’t been much of an issue so far in this tournament here, though this will 
be the third game and there were a couple of signs in last week’s Mexico vs 
Venezuela group match that the ball wasn’t rolling quite the way that some 
players were expecting.

As for NFL games, fans began tailgating in the prairie-sized parking lots 
hours before kickoff. There was a good-natured incursion by a few dozenArgentina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> fans - some waving 
blue-and-white umbrellas - into an area populated by the American Outlaws 
supporters group, leading to duelling chants of “Olé! Olé! Olé!” and “U-S-A, 
U-S-A!”

Josue Sanchez, who made the 200-mile drive from San Antonio, stood on the 
fringes of the rally with Clint Dempsey. Or at least, a larger-than-life 
“Deuce-face” cut-out of the US’s star forward and son of Nacogdoches, TX.

Dempsey has three goals so far in the tournament. How many more tonight? 
“Realistically, hopefully two,” Sanchez said. “He’s back in his home state of 
Texas, so I think he’s going to put on a show for Texas.”

Now for a look into the crystal ball. And it’s not pretty. Here’s a note from 
Michael Philip, via email.

6 or 7 Argentine goals, this is going to be cruel and the US can go back to 
games only they play…

Tonight’s lineups are already generating discussion. Here’s a note from Daniel 
Stauss, via email.

Messi, Higuain, Lavezzi, Dempsey, Wondolowski. one of these names is not like 
the others, one of these manners just doesn’t belong. At least Clint won’t be 
totally stranded up top, maybe Wondo can stumble around in front of Otamendi 
and distract him a little.
 
Here’s a look at tonight’s teams. USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> players Bobby Wood and 
Alejandro Bedoya are suspended for yellow-card accumulation in addition to 
Jermaine Jones, who picked up a straight red in the quarter-final against 
Ecuador.

Hello and welcome to tonight’s Copa América semi-final between the United 
States and Argentina. Kickoff is roughly 40 minutes away at Houston’s NRG 
Stadium and the sides have just taken the pitch for pre-match warmups. 
Argentina are clear favorites, but Jürgen Klinsmann’s men will no doubt be 
looking tostir up the echoes of 1995 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/copa-america-usa-argentina-1995>

Plenty more to come ahead of tonight’s match starting with the team
