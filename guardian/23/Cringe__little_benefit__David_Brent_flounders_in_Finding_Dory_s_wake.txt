The winner: Finding Dory

Returning to the top spot in its fourth week of play, Finding Dory has ended 
the two-week reign of Suicide Squad. WhileSuicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/suicide-squad> saw its box office decline 40% 
from the previous weekend, Finding Dory rose 12%. Weather most likely played a 
factor across the market, with weekend rain proving a boon to cinemas. Family 
films also scored particularly well, with audiences returning from holidays 
abroad and catching up on titles they missed. The BFG rose 10%, for example, 
and Pete’s Dragon fell a slim 6%.

After 24 days of play, Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-dory> has reached £32.4m, breathing 
down the neck of The Secret Life of Pets, the year’s top animated title so far 
on £33.7m. The Pixar sequel is only the sixth film this year to crack £30m, 
along with The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War, Batman v 
Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Secret Life of Pets. Three of the six are 
Disney titles, with one apiece from Fox, Warners and Universal. Warners’ 
Suicide Squad, on £27.7m so far, looks set to be the next 2016 release to make 
it into the £30m club.

With another two weeks before kids return to school in England and Wales, and 
the upcoming August Bank Holiday weekend, there should be plenty more life left 
in Finding Dory. Last summer, Pixar’s Inside Out had reached £30.7m at the same 
stage of the summer holiday, and ultimately reached £39.2m, boosted by a return 
to cinemas in the October half-term holiday. Look for the pattern to repeat 
with Dory.

King of the newbies: David Brent

Seeing off the challenge of Lights Out, Swallows and Amazons and Nine Lives, 
Ricky Gervais’sDavid Brent: Life on the Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-brent-life-on-the-road> was the top new 
release of the weekend, landing in the chart in third place. A debut gross of 
£1.46m compares with a very similar £1.43m plus £744,000 in previews for the 
opening salvo of Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa back in August 2013. Both films are 
cringe comedies celebrating man-child narcissists, that achieved big-screen 
success years after the respective characters’ peak TV popularity. Alpha Papa 
ended on £6.2m in the UK, which would be a very decent final result for Life on 
the Road.

Among the widely released new films (300 cinemas or more), the wooden spoon 
goes toNine Lives <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nine-lives>, featuring 
Kevin Spacey as a businessman who finds himself trapped in the body of the 
family cat. The film charted in ninth place. A PG rating will see it play to 
families looking for a comedy, but it isn’t specifically positioned as a 
children’s film.

Strength in depth

For only the fourth time this year, six movies delivered weekend grosses above 
£1m. But the strength in the market goes deeper than that, with 14 films 
contributing weekend box office above £300,000. That’s the first time this has 
happened since the middle of January 2015, when titles on release included 
leftover holiday season fare such as Annie and Night at the Museum: Secret of 
the Tomb, and awards contenders including The Theory of Everything, American 
Sniper, Into the Woods, Birdman, Whiplash, Wild, Testament of Youth and 
Foxcatcher.

Admissions update

Admissions figures – the number of tickets sold – are in for July, and they 
show a healthy 4.5% rise on July 2015. They also show the highest July total 
since 2011, when Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows: Part 2 were on offer. The top new releases in July last year 
were Inside Out and Ant-Man, but that month also benefited from a huge chunk of 
the box office for Minions, which was released on 26 June, as well as a tidy 
amount for June release Jurassic World.

 Pets mean prizes ... The Secret Life of Pets: one of the titles bumping 
admission figures 4.5% since July 2015 Photograph: Universal 
July 2016 has delivered the biggest number of admissions for any month so far 
this year, after a June with a rather cautious set of releases due to the 
anticipated competition for audiences from European Championship football. The 
Secret Life of Pets, released on 24 June, scored the majority of its admissions 
during July, while new releases included Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie and The 
BFG. Finding Dory and Jason Bourne both contributed one weekend of play right 
at the end of the month.

After seven months, admissions are overall 3.3% down on the same period of 
2015, but also 7.7% up on the first seven months of 2014. Last year was a 
particularly strong year for box office – in the UK and globally – buoyed by 
strong titles including Jurassic World. In contrast, 2014 was notably weak. 
Cinema owners will be pretty happy to see admissions only modestly down on 
2015, and so far August is proving strong relative to a year ago, buoyed by 
Suicide Squad, Finding Dory, Jason Bourne and continuing success for The BFG, 
which grossed more than £11m of its £25.8m total in August.

The indie hits: Wiener-Dog and The Childhood of a Leader

While summer 2016 has generally been poor for indie films, the season is 
ending on a brighter note with both Wiener-Dog andChildhood of a Leader 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/the-childhood-of-a-leader-review-brady-corbet>
. Todd Solondz’s canine-themed dark comedy has grossed a nifty £218,000 after 
10 days, which is way ahead of the lifetime box office of his earlier films 
Storytelling (£113,00), Palindromes (£101,000), Life During Wartime (£62,000) 
and Dark Horse (£30,000). It’s also ahead of 1997’s Welcome to the Dollhouse 
(£172,000), the first Solondz title to earn a theatrical release in the UK. It 
is, however, still a long way behind 1999’s Happiness, which grossed an 
impressive £648,000 here.

The Childhood of a Leader, the feature directing debut of actor Brady Corbet 
(Mysterious Skin, Funny Games), has begun with an encouraging £53,000 from 23 
cinemas, including £2,000 in previews. It’s a happy outcome for the film, after 
its original distributorMetrodome went in to administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/uk-film-distributor-metrodome-enters-administration>
 last week. Fellow arthouse distributor Soda stepped in to take over the title, 
perhaps encouraged by the glowing reviews that were stacking up in key outlets 
including the Guardian and Telegraph.

The future

Despite the lack of any major new release at the weekend, the rainy weather 
helped the UK box office achieve a soft landing, a surprise 3% up on the 
previous frame, and also a healthy 37% up on the equivalent session from 2015, 
when Paper Towns topped the chart in its first week of release. Cinema bookers 
are now hoping that the forthcoming Bank Holiday weekend can deliver a nice 
closer to the summer. The comedy Bad Moms has already proved a solid hit in the 
US, with $86m so far. The Purge: Election Year has grossed a similar $79m 
there. War Dogs, starring Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as America’s youngest and 
least likely arms dealers, opened in the US at the weekend with a robust $15m, 
but is perhaps a tougher sell here in the UK. Mechanic: Resurrection offers 
more Jason Statham, while the Andy Samberg comedyPopstar: Never Stop Never 
Stopping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/01/popstar-review-samberg-mockumentary-spinal-tap>
 looks like quite a distribution challenge for the UK market. Indie cinemas and 
upscale multiplexes will have a lot of hopes pinned on Perdo Almodóvar’sJulieta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/julieta-review-pedro-almodovar-ties-himself-down-with-fractured-melodrama>
, especially given the director’s track record of success with films released 
on the August holiday weekend. Monday sees the arrival of Noel Clarke’s 
Brotherhood, the final part of a trilogy that began with Kidulthood (2006) and 
Adulthood (2008).
