Finding a place through Clearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing> is much simpler than your 
original university application.

The process takes place over the phone, and you don’t have to wait long for a 
decision – it often happens during that call. The onus is on you to contact the 
university directly – you don’t go through Ucas.

This gives you some advantages: you get to talk to a human being, and you 
won’t automatically be dismissed if you don’t have the grades. If you can 
demonstrate a passion for the subject and good knowledge of it, you’re in with 
a chance.


What’s more, you can talk to your first-choice university, state your case in 
person and try to convince them that you’re worthy of a place on the course, 
even though you fell short of the grades.

Find a course Go to ucas.com <https://www.ucas.com/> and log in to Track. Find 
your Clearing number in the “my status” section and make a note of it, along 
with your personal ID number. Then use the Ucas online search tool to look for 
course vacancies through Clearing.

Make a shortlist You may need to whittle down the list of courses you’re going 
to investigate. What did you like most about your original choice? Was it the 
general subject or something specific about the course you liked? Which of your 
new choices appeals the most? Make a list.


Do more research Once you’ve found a course you’re interested in, find out 
what you can about the university. See what existing students think about the 
university through forums such asthestudentroom.co.uk 
<http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/> and Facebook. Do a virtual tour online. 


Make that phone call Make sure your phone is charged up – it’s time to phone 
the universities on your shortlist.

You’ll probably speak first to a member of the university’s Clearing helpline 
team. Make a good enough impression and you’ll go through to the programme 
administrator. Here’s how to wow them:

 * Prepare yourself Spend some time on this. Have your A-level and GCSE 
results to hand, as well as your personal statement. Re-read it for a 
confidence boost, then go through it with a highlighter to help you pick out 
the most relevant points. Have all your questions written down.

 * Go somewhere quiet Find somewhere private to make your call. The last thing 
you want is to be interrupted by your little brother barging into the room. Get 
the name of the person you speak to at each university and their contact 
details – you may well need these again.

 * Pick up the phone It’s time. Don’t dwell on what you didn’t achieve and 
focus on what you have to offer. Try to remember that universities don’t want 
empty places, so they’re on your side. Stay calm and confident.

Get a verbal offer The university may make you a verbal offer on the phone 
there and then. If there are several courses you want to apply for, thank them 
and add it to a new shortlist. Then decide which course you want to accept from 
your offers, log in to Track again, go to the “your choices” section and click 
“add Clearing choice”, along with the course details. Once you’ve added it, 
that’s it – the university will confirm it at their end and you’re on your way.
