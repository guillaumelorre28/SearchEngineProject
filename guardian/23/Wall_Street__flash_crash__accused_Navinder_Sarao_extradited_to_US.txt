The day trader accused of helping trigger the 2010 Wall Street “flash crash” 
from his parents’ home, has been extradited to the US and is expected to appear 
in a court in Chicago.

Navinder Sarao is in US custody and is scheduled to appear in federal court on 
Tuesday morning, Bloomberg reported. Sarao lost his year-long legal battle 
against extradition

 at the high court in London in mid-October.

Sarao, 37, faces 22 charges of fraud and market manipulation, which carry 
sentences totalling a maximum of 380 years. He is accused of making $40m (£32m) 
by “spoofing” the US market over five years, trading from his parents’ home in 
Hounslow, west London.

Sarao is alleged to have modified computer software to spoof the market by 
placing huge orders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange which he never intended 
to execute and which were later cancelled.

The case centres on his alleged contribution to the Dow Jones

points in five minutes on 6 May 2010, wiping almost $1tn off the value of US 
shares. US authorities claim he made $875,000 on the day.

Lawyers for the former bank worker and Brunel University student argued that 
his actions did not constitute a crime in the UK, where he should be tried 
because he is a British citizen.

US prosecutors in Chicago have stepped up their investigations into spoofing 
in recent years. In July, Michael Coscia became the first person to beconvicted

 of spoofing after it was made a crime under the Dodd-Frank Act. He was 
sentenced to three years in prison.
