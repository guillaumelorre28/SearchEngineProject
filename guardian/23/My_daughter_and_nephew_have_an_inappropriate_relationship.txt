My sister’s son, 25, and my daughter, 18, get on well. He’s a handsome lad and 
she’s an attractive girl. Recently, I accidentally discovered she keeps a diary 
and was unable to resist reading it. I was shocked at what I saw. Apparently 
one day while on holiday, she deliberately made him sexually excited by 
insisting they go swimming naked. No one could see them and unable to resist 
losing their virginity, they enjoyed the thrill of unprotected sex in the sea. 
She writes that it felt wonderful and that he was in absolute ecstasy, knowing 
my daughter is on the pill. Although sex between cousins is, I believe, legal, 
I think it’s disgusting. As her mother, should I confront her with my findings 
and alert my sister to the situation, or try to forget it instead?
