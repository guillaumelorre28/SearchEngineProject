As the final spots for Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> are filled, attention is 
turning to the tournament. The next six months will be spent assessing the 24 
playing squads, with places still up for grabs as managers look to monitor 
their established internationals and find players whose form demands their 
inclusion. Here are players from five of the favourites who may become 
unexpected stars next summer.


Nabil Fekir, age 22, France <http://www.whoscored.com/Players/134893>

The hosts have not faced competitive action since last summer’s World Cup but 
they are improving all the time and are contenders to regain the crown they 
last won in 2000. It may seem strange to tout a player who is suffering from a 
long-term injury as a potential key figure to France’s hopes, but such is the 
promise of Nabil Fekir that he has already been earmarked as the man Didier 
Deschamps’ side will be built around in the years to come. While the futures of 
Karim Benzema and Mathieu Valbuena are shrouded in doubt, it seems pretty clear 
that Fekir will play a crucial role if fit.

The 22-year old sustained a cruciate ligament injury on international duty 
back in September but should be ready in good time for the Euros. He had shone 
for Lyon in the year before his injury, with four goals and an assist in four 
Ligue 1 appearances this season following figures of 13 goals and nine assists 
in his breakthrough campaign last time out. The young playmaker accrued a 
sensational rating of 8.07 before his injury and is likely to link the midfield 
and attack for Les Bleus when available.

He may be a long shot to make an impact next summer, having only made his 
international debut last week at the age of just 19, but if Leroy Sané can 
continue his early season form he will stake a real claim for a place in 
Joachim Low’s plans. Across 16 appearances in the league and Europa League this 
season, the Schalke has scored five goals and registered four assists for a 
rating of 7.37.

He has already proven capable of rising to the big occasion, having scored his 
first senior goal on his Champions League debut in the knockout stages against 
Real Madrid earlier this year. The 19-year-old’s pace and trickery can pose the 
best defences problems; only two regulars in the Bundesliga have completed a 
dribble more often in the league this season (every 20.3 minutes).

A latecomer to the international scene, 29-year old Nolito has only really 
come to the fore in La Liga over the last 18 months. His outstanding form has 
led to reports that he will return to Barcelona – where he spent three years 
with the B before moving to Benfica in 2011. Nolito was not capped by any of 
Spain’s youth teams but his performances for Celta Vigo last season were duly 
noted by Vicente del Bosque, who gave him his debut in a friendly againstGermany
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> this time last year.

Nolito’s seven goals and four assists have helped Celta Vigo to fourth 
position in the league this season. He could carry the sort of threat that 
David Villa gaveSpain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain>, cutting in 
from the left to score goals for a team that has struggled to find the right 
centre-forward in recent years.

Michy Batshuayi, age 22, Belgium <http://www.whoscored.com/Players/97803/>

Divock Origi profited from Christian Benteke’s injury and Romelu Lukaku’s lack 
of form to emerge as one of the breakthrough stars of the World Cup in Brazil 
last summer. It hasn’t worked out for the Liverpool forward since then but that 
won’t deter Michy Batshuayi, who will be hoping to put significant pressure on 
the established Premier League duo for a starting place in theBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> team at Euro 2016.

The 22-year old has scored in both of his international appearances to date, 
against Cyprus earlier this year and against Italy last week. When he came on 
againstItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy>, he struck twice as 
many shots (four) as any team-mate in a 28-minute cameo. Only Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic has had a direct hand in more Ligue 1 goals this season than the 
Marseille striker (eight goals and three assists). If Batshuayi can continue in 
the same vein for the rest of the campaign, it will be hard for Marc Wilmots to 
overlook him next summer.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2015/feb/18/arrigo-sacchi-italy-football-ethical-dilemma-racism-foreign-players>
 – called up under the reign of Antonio Conte this year, Sampdoria striker Éder 
is a native of Brazil who was convinced to play for Italy in light of the
Azzurri’sstriking problems. Mario Balotelli’s disastrous spell at Liverpool 
along with persistent injuries to Giuseppe Rossi led to Éder and Graziano Pellè 
receiving recognition at a late age.

The pair are now Conte’s preferred front two and 29-year-old Éder thoroughly 
deserves his chance on the international stage. He is currently the joint top 
scorer in Serie A, tied on nine goals with Gonzalo Higuaín, and he will be 
aiming to make his mark at Euro 2016 before what looks likely to be a race for 
his signature next summer.
