Well, congrats to Seattle. They pulled it out of the bag, even though they 
were rubbish on the night. A generally tedious final, but Seattle won’t care. 
They’ve made history.

Thanks for reading. Goodnight.

They’ve done it! The Sounders are in a bundle on the field. They’ve won their 
first everMLS <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mls> Cup – and they did it 
in a game in which they didn’t have a shot. Torres slotted the penalty in 
really calm fashion – straight down the middle.

Commiserations to Toronto: they were the better side tonight. They just 
couldn’t do it in the shootout.

112 min Does that count as a shot on target for Seattle? Beitashour completely 
missed it in the six-yard box, but it took Torres by surprise and bobbled off 
his knee and into Irwin’s arms.

108 min What a magnificent save from Stefan Frei! Finally, we have some 
action! Ricketts did so well on the right side, hung up a cross, and Altidore’s 
header looked to be looping in, but Frei got fingertips and clawed it away from 
the net! Brilliant work from the Seattle goalie. I thought that was in.

107 min Oh, Ricketts! Seattle couldn’t clear, and Ricketts hit one on the 
volley. He didn’t quite catch it right, and it sliced off his boot and just 
trickled past the post! Frei was beaten. Morris can’t continue and Brad Evans 
is on for Seattle.

94 min As disappointing finals go, it’s not quite up there with 
Portugal-France this summer or every World Cup since 1990, but it’s lacked

82 min Morris is nearly on to a loose ball, but his touch is heavy, and it’s

81 min Mears drives inside but shoots wide. Still Seattle haven’t tested Clint 
Irwin.

Here’s Travis Giblin: “Tim, this game started out with such promise and 
excitement. Where did it all go wrong? It could seriously do with a goal, 
preferably from the home side.”

75 min A dumb passage of play. Alonso shot from 25 yards and Bradley got in 
the way, and when Giovinco picked the ball up in his own half, the Seattle 
defence had dropped back way inside their half! Why weren’t they at the halfway 
line? Giovinco streaked forward unchallenged, then got a bump, went down, and 
Alan Kelly said no free kick. All very messy.

Well, congrats to Seattle. They pulled it out of the bag, even though they 
were rubbish on the night. A generally tedious final, but Seattle won’t care. 
They’ve made history.

Thanks for reading. Goodnight.
 
They’ve done it! The Sounders are in a bundle on the field. They’ve won their 
first everMLS <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mls> Cup – and they did it 
in a game in which they didn’t have a shot. Torres slotted the penalty in 
really calm fashion – straight down the middle.

Commiserations to Toronto: they were the better side tonight. They just 
couldn’t do it in the shootout.
 
Torres scores! Toronto 4-5 Seattle

Seattle have done it!
 
Morrow misses! Toronto 4-4 Seattle

Off the crossbar! 
 
Lodeiro scores! Toronto 4-4 Seattle

Whew. Decisive. Great power.
 
Moor scores! Toronto 4-3 Seattle

In the corner. Seattle must score now.
 
Jones scores! Toronto 3-3 Seattle

Top corner! What a penalty!
 
Johnson scores! Toronto 3-2 Seattle

And Frei goes the wrong way!
 
Fernandez misses! Toronto 2-2 Seattle

And Irwin saves to his left! Another poor penalty, though.
 
Cheyrou scores! Toronto 2-2 Seattle

Right in the corner. Top penalty.
 
Ivanschitz scores! Toronto 1-2 Seattle

And the Austrian sends Irwin the wrong way. Seattle lead in the shootout!
 
Bradley misses! Toronto 1-1 Seattle

Frei saves! No conviction from the skipper.
 
Evans scores! Toronto 1-1 Seattle

Sends Irwin the wrong way.
 
Altidore scores! Toronto 1-0 Seattle

Decisive. Low to Frei’s right.
 
So here we go. Tension! TFC to kick first.
 
Well, that was dreadful, by and large, but at least we’ll have some drama with 
the shootout. Frei’s save from Altidore was genuinely magnificent, but that was 
about the sole highlight in what was, I’m afraid to say, a very poor final.
 
We’re going to penalties.
 
120 min A minute left. Seattle still haven’t had a shot on target.
 
118 min Ricketts goes clear past Marshall, but the angle is tight, and he 
can’t get the power. Frei saves easily.
 
117 min Both teams look shattered, understandably.
 
115 min Everybody’s got cramp. They’re all on the floor. Let’s just go to 
penalties, ref.
 
114 min Corner No10 for TFC. Nothing doing, though.
 
112 min Does that count as a shot on target for Seattle? Beitashour completely 
missed it in the six-yard box, but it took Torres by surprise and bobbled off 
his knee and into Irwin’s arms.
 
111 min Ivanschitz is nearly hit by a can of beer at the corner flag. We’ve 
seen this before at sports games in Toronto. Stupid.
 
109 min What a save that was. Brilliant from Frei. So athletic.
 
108 min What a magnificent save from Stefan Frei! Finally, we have some 
action! Ricketts did so well on the right side, hung up a cross, and Altidore’s 
header looked to be looping in, but Frei got fingertips and clawed it away from 
the net! Brilliant work from the Seattle goalie. I thought that was in.
 
107 min Oh, Ricketts! Seattle couldn’t clear, and Ricketts hit one on the 
volley. He didn’t quite catch it right, and it sliced off his boot and just 
trickled past the post! Frei was beaten. Morris can’t continue and Brad Evans 
is on for Seattle.
 
106 min Under way in the second half of extra time. Morris goes clear on the 
left, but Hagglund does well to clear the danger.
 
Still searching for that goal.

Sports  
105 min Ricketts is nearly through but Jones does well to mop up.
 
103 min And Sebastian Giovinco’s night is done. Tosaint Ricketts is on.
 
102 min Giovinco really looks like he’s struggling. He might not be able to 
continue.
 
101 min Moor heads clear. Quelle surprise.
 
100 min Get this: in 100 minutes of football, Seattle haven’t had a shot on 
target. Headed behind by Cheyrou, and it’s a corner.
 
99 min Giovinco is moving gingerly, and Ivanschitz has just gone down. Lodeiro 
wins a cheap free kick from Cheyrou’s foul, and Seattle have a chance to get 
the ball in the box.
 
98 min Seattle haven’t attacked in this first period of extra time. TFC 
playing in Seattle’s half.
 
96 min Altidore does well to win a corner off Joevin Jones. Bradley takes, and 
it’s crap.
 
94 min As disappointing finals go, it’s not quite up there with 
Portugal-France this summer or every World Cup since 1990, but it’s lacked 
excitement, for sure. Cheyrou finds a pocket of space but his shot is weak.
 
92 min Altidore and Giovinco haven’t really clicked tonight, and Altidore is 
penalised for a foul on Chad Marshall.
 
91 min We’re back at it, and immediately Cheyrou hits a shot that’s deflected 
wide. Frei wouldn’t have got there. Bradley’s corner is cleared. The corners 
have been rubbish tonight.
 
Well, we’ve got 30 minutes more of this, but it’s fair to say it hasn’t been a 
classic. In fact, it’s been pretty disappointing. But who knows? Maybe it’ll 
liven up.
 
And that’s it. We go into extra-time.
 
90 min +2 Bradley is cautioned for a late challenge on Roldan.
 
90 min +1 TFC corner. And Altidore nearly nicks a winner! It was headed on, 
and Altidore was inches from getting the vital touch.
 
90 min Three minutes of stoppage time. Who’s going to be the hero?!
 
88 min I don’t think Clint Irwin has had to make a save, but Seattle are still 
in this. It’s anyone’s to win!
 
86 min It comes to nothing, predictably. And then TFC had a two on one, but 
Cheyrou couldn’t get the pass right. Not good enough, unfortunately.
 
85 min Five minutes to go. Both sides are trying their best, but there’s just 
a lack of quality in attack. Morris wins a corner, Seattle’s third.
 
83 min Benoit Cheyrou replaces Armando Cooper, who looks thoroughly pissed to 
have been withdrawn.
 
82 min Morris is nearly on to a loose ball, but his touch is heavy, and it’s 
out for a goal kick. It’s been that kind of game.
 
81 min Mears drives inside but shoots wide. Still Seattle haven’t tested Clint 
Irwin.

Here’s Travis Giblin: “Tim, this game started out with such promise and 
excitement. Where did it all go wrong? It could seriously do with a goal, 
preferably from the home side.”
 
80 min Seattle win a free kick, and Ivanschitz plays it in, but TFC clear 
without much fuss.
 
79 min Seattle have ridden the storm, and the subs have had an influence. 
Seattle starting to get on the ball a bit more.
 
78 min Still plenty of time for a winner in regulation. Will Johnson replaces 
Osorio for TFC.
 
75 min A dumb passage of play. Alonso shot from 25 yards and Bradley got in 
the way, and when Giovinco picked the ball up in his own half, the Seattle 
defence had dropped back way inside their half! Why weren’t they at the halfway 
line? Giovinco streaked forward unchallenged, then got a bump, went down, and 
Alan Kelly said no free kick. All very messy.
 
73 min Panic in the Seattle defence, but they do enough. The Sounders have 
been focused on defending for the past 10 minutes or so.
 
72 min Andreas Ivanschitz replaces Nelson Valdez, who hobbles off injured. TFC 
have a free kick after that Jones-Beitashour tangle. It’s hustled behind for a 
corner after Frei flapped at the first cross.
