Widely trailed as a plan to help “just about managing’ familes, the 
government’s plan to ban spiralling letting agency fees will benefit renters if 
it is introduced as planned. But some readers were unconvinced that this would 
make much of a difference - echoing the view shared by housing minister Gavin 
Barwelljust two months ago. 
<https://twitter.com/GavinBarwellMP/status/777852917013512192>

Whilst Hammond’s planned intervention regarding estate agent fees is welcome, 
it will only offer short term relief in this unregulated sector. Estate agents 
will employ teams of lawyers to re-brand these fees and/or rise rents to plug 
the ‘shortfall’ they will incur. But more importantly, tenants will continue to 
be treated in a patronizing, heartless, and nakedly manipulative manner until 
the government learn that property exists to act as a home first and an asset 
second

George Osborne’s ‘National Living Wage’ - not to be confused with what 
campaigners consider to be a genuine living wage 
<http://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-living-wage> - will be raised from £7.20 to 
£7.50 an hour in April.

Although I have a degree and other professional qualifications, I am reduced 
to a minimum wage Saturday job as I have to care for my autistic 25-year-old 
son. My husband, who is a social care support worker, has no contract and works 
30 hours a week which aren’t guaranteed.

We struggle as we also support a son on an apprenticeship and a daughter who’s 
just graduated but can’t find work other than in Tescos - which again only 
provides the minimum wage and offers under 20 hours of work.

Not a new announcement as such 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-george-osborne-sugar-tax-growth-forecast-falls>
, Hammond confirmed a rise in the income tax threshold to £11,500 by April and 
£12,500 by 2020. Some readers were happy with the [re] announcement - others,
echoing Polly Toynbee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-panel-make-a-difference-philip-hammond>
, were less so.

My wife is self-employed (much encouraged by the Tories), but her work is now 
very precarious as it often relies on EU companies as clients. If the income 
tax threshold goes up, watch out for a change in national insurance. Filling 
out your own returns is a sobering reminder of just how much of that “tax-free” 
allowance is taken by HMRC.

The UK economy has been swamped with low wages and I see it very difficult for 
this ever to be resolved without joe public yet again having to take a bullet 
for the rich. It is not sustainable to have low wages - increasing the personal 
tax allowance which means less tax take. Add to this Brexit and the possible 
decline in immigration numbers and public services will start to take more of a 
cut. Appalling way to run an economy no wonder many top EU countries laugh at 
our so called economic "prudence".

 A continuation of austerity? Hammond with his autumn statement. Photograph:

The government no longer expects to balance the budget by 2020 - that 
particular Osborne pledge has already been shelved - butHammond introduced 
three new fiscal rules 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/nov/23/autumn-statement-2016-philip-hammond-brexit-growth-deficit-housing-jams-universal-credit-minimum-wage-live?page=with:block-58358f4de4b0da4920d6b415#block-58358f4de4b0da4920d6b415>
. If he is serious about being in surplus at some point in the next parliament, 
austerity measures introduced sine 2010 are likely to continue.

“Austerity was originally meant to be over within a single parliament of five 
years,” writes Aditya Chakrabortty in our panel, but “it will now last for up 
to 15 years. It will certainly carry on into a third parliament.

"Austerity may have been ditched, with the increasingly mythical goal of a 
budget surplus booted into the distant future, but the pain associated with it 
may simply be moving elsewhere."

Austerity <https://www.theguardian.com/business/austerity> has not been 
ditched, it will continue as cuts to public services under other name. What has 
been ditched id the objective of achieving balanced budget. Brexit makes it 
impossible in the same way as it makes cuts inevitable. Brexit just wasted 
nearly a decade of Tory attempts to balance the budget, regardless whether you 
think this was a good idea or not.

So basically after all this austerity, we are now worse off?

Finally, the elephant in the room - how Britain’s Leave vote will impact the 
UK’s economy in the months and years to come.

The OBR forecasts aren’t pretty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/philip-hammond-brexit-vote-borrowing-autumn-statement>
. Ed Miliband called the OBR figures a “salutary warning” against the kind of 
“hard Brexit” wished for by some Tory figures. It’s a theme that was picked up 
in the comments.

As a Euro-sceptical sort of person who has nevertheless been ultimately 
agonistic about Brexit, I am coming around to the view that the economic 
consequences of the UK leaving the EU are going to be catastrophic. I am still 
at a loss to understand how the circle of political legitimacy is going to be 
squared to halt the Brexit, as given that the referendum has taken place with 
its fateful result, and without exacerbating the dire political and 
constitutional crisis in which the UK is now mired. However, I am filled with 
great foreboding when I reflect that the said political-constitutional crisis 
is going to run concurrent with the sharp deterioration in economic conditions 
as foreshadowed in this not exactly morale-boosting effort from Mr Hammond.
