The Night Manager <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager> 
has been named the Radio Times show of 2016, with the Tom Hiddleston spy drama 
heading a top 30 list chosen by the magazine’s critics dominated by drama and 
the BBC.

In the top 10, all but three programmes – Planet Earth II, The Great British 
Bake Off and Fleabag – were drama, and all but two were shown on the BBC. Of 
the full list of 30, 21 were shown on theBBC

Police dramas Line of Duty on BBC2 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc2> 
and Happy Valley on BBC1 occupied the second and third slots, with BBC3’s 
Fleabag the only comedy in the top 10, at number four.

Planet Earth II, which racked up the largest audiences for a natural history 
programme in at least 15 years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/planet-earth-ii-bbc1-most-watched-natural-history-show-for-15-years>
, was ranked at number eight.

The only programmes not shown on the corporation’s channels to make the top 10 
were Netflix royal drama The Crown, which came in at number seven, and Channel 
4’s National Treasure, starring Robbie Coltrane and Andrea Riseborough.

Netflix’s Stranger Things, which became a water-cooler hit this summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/05/stranger-things-netflix-season-two-winona-ryder-us>
, just missed out on the top 10, but beat the BBC’s second series of Poldark at 
number 12 and Sky’s only entry, Westworld, at number 13.

In total, the US-based streaming service had four entries, with Charlie 
Brooker’s Black Mirror and long-awaited sitcom sequel Gilmore Girls also making 
the list. ITV’s only entry was the revival of drama Cold Feet, at number 14.

The popularity of the BBC’s content with critics was matched by audiences, 
with figures compiled earlier this weekshowing that all but nine of the 
top-rated programmes of the year were on the corporation’s channels

.

The Radio Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-times> online editor, 
Tim Glanfield, said: “2016 has been a fantastic year for television, from 
primetime homegrown dramas that have gripped the nation to classic series of 
Strictly and Bake Off that have shown that live linear TV still has the power 
to draw big audiences.

“We’ll look back on this decade as a golden age of TV – and drama in 
particular – as the arrival of pretenders like Netflix and Amazon has fired up 
the traditional channels to raise their game.”
