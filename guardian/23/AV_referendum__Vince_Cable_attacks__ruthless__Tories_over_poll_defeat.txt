Vince Cable has lashed out at the Conservatives for being "ruthless, 
calculating and thoroughly tribal", after the Lib Dems' massive defeats in 
Thursday's elections and theAV referendum

However, the business secretary said the coalition can still continue in a 
"businesslike" fashion.

"Some of us never had many illusions about the Conservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives>, but they have emerged as 
ruthless, calculating and thoroughly tribal," Cable said.

"But that doesn't mean to say we can't work with them. I think they have 
always been that way, but you have to be businesslike and professional and you 
have to work with people who aren't your natural bedfellows and that is being 
grownup in politics."

The referendum on changing how Britain elects its MPs was a major concession 
secured by the Lib Dems when they formed the coalition with the Tories last 
year. But in Thursday's poll it was rejected by 13,013,123 votes to 6,152,607.

During the campaign there was much animosity between the "yes" and "no" camps.

Speaking on the BBC today, Cable conceded that the main purpose of the 
coalition was to sort out the "economic mess", and not bring about electoral 
reform.

But he made it clear that the Lib Dems would not accept future policies which 
go beyond last year's agreement with their coalition partners, including 
proposals on NHS reform.

"We have a coalition agreement, which is a very good agreement and which is 
balanced and which we have to deliver, and that is the text around which we 
should operate in future while not losing sight of the central purpose of the 
coalition, which is to sort out this economic mess," he said.

"The health service reforms went some way beyond what was in the coalition 
agreement and that is going to be a major issue as we go forward."
