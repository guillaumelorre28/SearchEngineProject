The Ghana coach Avram Grant <https://www.theguardian.com/football/avram-grant> 
has been ordered to return to the country by the local football association to 
concentrate on his job before Africa Cup of Nations Cup qualifiers this month 
rather than appearing as a pundit on British television.

One parliamentarian, Kojo Baah Agyemang, said the former Chelsea and West Ham 
manager had been “taking the nation for granted”, telling a radio station it 
was unacceptable to spend his time out of the of country.

“We have ordered him to return from Europe to monitor the local league,” the 
Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> Football Association 
spokesman Ibrahim Sannie Daara said on Thursday. The GFA feels Grant should be 
watching local football matches to unearth talent rather than acting as a 
pundit on Sky Sports.

Ghana take on Mozambique in the Africa Cup of Nations Cup qualifiers home and 
away on 24 March and 27 March, and is expected back in the country soon to work 
with the squad in the lead up to the matches. Sannie Daara added: “The matches 
against Mozambique are approaching and we need him.”

Grant is not the first manager of an African national side to be criticised 
for spending time in Europe, and many defend their stays on the grounds that it 
allows them to easily monitor Ghanaian players based there.

Several national players are with Premier League sides, including the Chelsea 
left-back Baba Rahman and Leicester’s Daniel Amartey.

Grant took over as Ghana coach in late 2014 and within months led the Black 
Stars to a place in the final of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations Cup

 where they lost to Ivory Coast on penalties.
