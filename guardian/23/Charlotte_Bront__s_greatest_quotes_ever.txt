This year marks the bicentenary of Charlotte Brontë’s birth in Thorton, 
Yorkshire in 1816. Best known for her much-loved novelJane Eyre 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jane-eyre-58.html>, Charlotte has inspired 
aspiring writers since it was first published in October 1847.

Under the male pseudonym Currer Bell, Charlotte brought us wonderful stories 
from the heartbreaking and desolateVillette 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/villette-7.html> to the bold and courageous 
Shirley <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shirley-5.html>. Charlotte loved and 
wrote so passionately and it is this desire that brings to life the characters 
from her pages of her novels, whether it’s the fairy-like Jane, brooding Edward 
Rochester, chilly Lucy Snowe, vibrant Shirley or the violent mad woman in the 
attic.

Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and 
heartless? You think wrong! - I have as much soul as you, - and full as much 
heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have 
made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you!” — Jane 
Eyre

I ask you to pass through life at my side to be my second self, and my best 
earthly companion.” — Jane Eyre

bitterest thing we know.” — Shirley

I mean that I value vision, and dread being struck stone blind.” — Villette

The human heart has hidden treasures, In secret kept, in silence sealed; The 
thoughts, the hopes, the dreams, the pleasures, Whose charms were broken if 
revealed.” — Evening Solace
