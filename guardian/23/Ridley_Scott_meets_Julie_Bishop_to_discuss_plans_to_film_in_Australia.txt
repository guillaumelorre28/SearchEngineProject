Bishop confirmed to Sky News 
<http://www.skynews.com.au/video/program_featured/2015/09/30/2029--appropriate--time-to-be-unsc--bishop.html>
 on Wednesday that she had met Scott to talk about the possibilities of him 
producing a film in Australia.

“I was very interested to hear from him and it’s certainly a matter I’ll take 
up with prime ministerMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and treasurer 
Scott Morrison,” she said.

Bishop has previously dined with such celebrities as Robert De Niro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro> and Hugh Jackman, and she 
speculated that “maybe it was through De Niro” Scott had managed to wrangle the 
high-powered tête-à-tête.

Bishop said it was part of the government’s agenda to promote Australia’s 
creative economy.

“We have some of the most talented and creative people in Australia, one of 
our greatest natural assets,” she said.

“And if we can promote film production in Australia I think that’s a great 
opportunity for more jobs in our creative economies, in the creative sections 
in our country.”

Bishop did not reveal which film Scott might bring to Australia, but based on 
past interviews with the director it is likely to be the follow-up to his 1982 
classicBlade Runner <https://www.theguardian.com/film/blade-runner>, or a 
sequel toPrometheus <https://www.theguardian.com/film/prometheus> (itself a 
prequel to his Alien franchise).

At the recent Toronto international film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/toronto-film-festival-2015>, Scott said 
preparation for the follow-up to 2012 blockbuster Prometheus had begun and that 
the shoot wouldtake place in either Australia or Canada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/14/prometheus-sequel-to-be-shot-in-australia-or-canada-says-ridley-scott>
 next February.

Last week Scott confirmed with German site FilmFutter that there could be up 
to three Prometheus sequels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/23/ridley-scott-three-more-prometheus-films-alien>
, after which the series would link back to the original Alien franchise.

Scott was last seen in Australia

 in 2014 when he took a tour of Sydney’s Fox studios, prompting rumours that he 
was scouting for film locations.

Bishop’s office has been contacted for comment.
