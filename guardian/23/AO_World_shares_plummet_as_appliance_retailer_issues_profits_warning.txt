 last year.

AO World <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ao-world> stock, which 
attracted significant investor interest when it joined the stock market last 
year, plunged 47% to 154.5p at one point on Wednesday morning after it sounded 
the alarm on its full-year performance, before recovering slightly to close 
down 31.7%.

AO triggered the plunge by admitting in a trading update that a tough fourth 
quarter for its UK business would weigh on results for the year to 31 March 
2015.

John Roberts, its chief executive, said: “AO has experienced tougher than 
expected trading conditions in the final quarter of the year, as compared to 
the fourth quarter in the 2014 financial year.

“While we are disappointed that sales and profits are going to come in 
slightly below expectations, we remain committed to our market-leading, 
customer-focused business model.”


Roberts said it only amounted to a “slight miss” and was adamant that AO 
remained “a fast-growing e-commerce business.”

“It’s not a fundamental change in the story or the investment case. We’re 
still taking share and disrupting the way the market operates.”

AO said that UK revenue for the full year was likely to come in at between 
£470m and £475m, with adjusted earnings of about £16.5m. The City was expecting 
revenue in the range of £480m to £487, and earnings of £18.6m to £21.2m.

The retailer, which specialises in selling kitchen appliances, said that it 
now realised some of its earlier revenue growth was the result of extra 
publicity surrounding the floatation of the company, the impact of which had 
faded.

AO was listed on the stock exchange last February amid a frenzy over prospects 
for online retailers. Shares soared initially, prompting some analysts to warn 
the high valuation was reminiscent of the dotcom bubble. Shortly after the 
float the stock dipped below its 285p offer price.

Roberts, a former kitchen salesman, made £86m selling 10% of the company he 
founded

15 years ago. He retained a 28.6% stake.

He said on Wednesday that the process of floating the business had been an 
education.

“A year later, I would change very little. I’d still go ahead and push the 
button. We ran a great process. We became the poster child for an over-valued 
IPO [initial public offering], but I genuinely don’t think we were overvalued. 
I’m still the biggest shareholder in the business.”

He admitted, however, that it had been difficult to come out with a profits 
warning, and said he had spoken to all the company’s key shareholders.

“There is no doubt pride has been dented, of course it has. I don’t want to be 
having these conversations today. But the absolute fundamentals are unchanged.”


 AO said that as well as the fading impact of the floatation it had also been 
hit by the loss of a logistics contract and the effects of theBlack Friday 
discount day

 last November, which Roberts said condensed sales into a shorter time period 
without actually increasing them.

“These factors are also expected to impact the performance of the company in 
the next financial year,” the retailer said. “The board of AO is confident that 
the company’s fundamental business model remains strong and AO is continuing to 
deliver on its strategic objectives.”

AO said trading in Germany, a market it entered six months ahead of schedule, 
was doing well and that the company was looking at other possible markets for 
international expansion.
