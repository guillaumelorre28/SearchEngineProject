The winner #1: The Secret Life of Pets

Declining a slim 20%, Illumination Entertainment’s The Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
 holds on to the top spot, with second-weekend takings of £4.74m, and a 12-day 
total of £16.62m. Animation is powering the market on both sides of the 
Atlantic, with Pixar’sFinding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/finding-dory-review-nemo-sequel-disability-ellen-de-generes>
 reigning supreme at the US box office for the last three weeks.

For comparison, this year Disney Animation’s Zootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
 stood at £12.6m after two weekends, and DreamWorks Animation’sKung Fu Panda 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/kung-fu-panda-3-review> was at 
£7.08m. Zootropolis has reached £23.7m, so The Secret Life of Pets could be on 
target for around £31m. Ice Age: Collision Course played previews at the 
weekend, but does not appear to have posed much threat, given Pets’ modest 
decline. Finding Dory looks a more worthy adversary, but it doesn’t arrive 
until the end of the month. Also coming soon: live-action/CGI blendThe BFG

The winner # 2: Absolutely Fabulous

The TV show was in its prime as long ago as the mid-90s, but Absolutely 
Fabulous has retained significant fan affection. So would audiences approach
Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
 with caution or nostalgic enthusiasm?

With big-screen sitcoms, the biggest commercial successes lately have been 
exploitations of very current or recent properties (The Inbetweeners Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-movie>, Mrs Brown’s Boys 
D’Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/27/mrs-browns-boys-dmovie-brendan-ocarroll-review>
). On the other hand,The Bad Education Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/25/the-bad-education-movie-review-jack-whitehall-tv-spin-off>
 did not want for currency – it wasn’t a powerful enough comedy brand to 
deliver a big cinema audience.Dad’s Army 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/dads-army-review-film-who-dont-you-think-you-are-kidding>
 benefited from brand power, but the recasting represented a challenge for fans 
of the show.

Absolutely Fabulous was able to retain key cast, and the ageing of central duo 
Edina and Patsy arguably works in the premise’s favour. Powered by an effective 
marketing campaign from distributor Fox and brand partners, the film has opened 
at the top end of expectations, with a debut of just over £4m. In February, 
Dad’s Army began with £2.08m.Sex and the Cit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/may/30/romance.comedy>y kicked off 
with £5.12m plus £3.65m in previews in May 2008.

The weekend tends to deliver more of a couples audience, and midweek can be a 
favoured slot for female friendship groups. Absolutely Fabulous may achieve 
some pretty robust numbers on weekdays. On the other hand, some of the luxury, 
premium-priced packages being offered by cinemas (Absolutely Fabulous with 
Bolly, Darling; Absolutely Fabulous with Brunch, Darling) seem a better fit 
with weekend indulgence. The film was easily the highest-grossing title on 
Monday, falling just short of £700,000, and 70% ahead of the next title in the 
market. Some cinemas are offering premium-priced packages, including Absolutely 
Fabulous with Bolly, Darling, and Absolutely Fabulous with Brunch, Darling.

Fox is billing its film as the biggest UK opening so far this year for a 
British production, which it is. The competition includesEddie the Eagle

Delivering the biggest UK opening of Kevin Hart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kevin-hart>’s career – unless you count his 
voice work in The Secret Life of Pets – action comedyCentral Intelligence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/central-intelligence-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart>
 begins with a sturdy £3.05m. That compares with a £1.42m debut for the 
similarly conceivedRide Along 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/27/ride-along-review-ice-cube> in 
February 2014, and a £2.14m debut forRide Along 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/ride-along-2-review-ice-cube-kevin-hart>
 in January this year.

Hart receives a hefty commercial assist this time from Dwayne Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dwayne-johnson>, who has enjoyed big numbers 
in the last threeFast and Furious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fast-furious-7> films, and powered San Andreas
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/san-andreas> to a muscular £4.63m opening 
(including £740,000 in previews) last summer. As for comedies, Johnson had 
supporting roles inThe Other Guys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review> (£8.19m 
lifetime) and Get Smart (£4.84m lifetime), but Central Intelligence represents 
his biggest comedy opening. Johnson stars in the forthcomingBaywatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/baywatch>, a Jumanji reboot (reteaming with 
Hart) and Fast 8. San Andreas 2 is in development.

The success of The Secret Life of Pets, Absolutely Fabulous and Central 
Intelligence brings solidity to the top of the chart, with all three films 
grossing £3m-plus at the weekend. The last time this happened was in December 
2013, withThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/hobbit-desolation-of-smaug-review>
,Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues

, set in 1970s Chile, represents her first fully fledged lead role, playing a 
flight attendant caught up in Pinochet’s repression of political protesters.

Co-starring Daniel Brühl, The Colony received a token UK release from 
distributor Signature, showing in three cinemas. Consequently, it generated 
token box office, with data gatherer comScore reporting just £47 for the 
weekend period – a handful of tickets sold. The film is available as video on 
demand.

Independent film has hit the summer doldrums. Unless you count Shane Black’s 
The Nice Guys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/the-nice-guys-review-russell-crowe-and-ryan-gosling-cannes>
 as an indie title, it’s wall-to-wall mainstream releases. The highest grossing 
arthouse film isTale of Tales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/17/tale-of-tales-review-matteo-garrone-salam-hayek-john-c-reilly-toby-jones>
, in 14th place, and with a weekend gross of just £28,000. The well-reviewed 
documentaryNotes on Blindness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/notes-blindness-review-film-audio-diaries-theologian-john-hull-blind>
 has not delivered box office commensurate with the critical esteem (100% fresh 
at Rotten Tomatoes), opening with £20,000 from 32 cinemas, including some 
preview takings.

Thanks to the arrival of Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie and Central 
Intelligence, and the strong hold for The Secret Life of Pets, overall box 
office is 5% above average, when compared to the last 52 weekends. But that 
wasn’t enough, quite, to match the equivalent session from a year ago, when
Minions

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>
 let the box office charge. Takings are 2% down on that weekend frame. 
Programmers now have their hopes pinned onNow You See Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/now-you-see-me-2-review-sequel-magic>

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/the-legend-of-tarzan-review-an-inherently-problematic-remake>
