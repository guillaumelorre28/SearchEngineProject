Burton, who scored his biggest box-office hit to date with 2010’s Alice in 
Wonderland, was originally attached to the film in 2015 and now the studio is 
“aggressively” pushing the film towards production. The script comes from Ehren 
Kruger, whose credits include Scream 3 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

2016 was a record-breaking year for Disney, who were behind every film in the 
global top five, including their live-action take on the Jungle Book. This year 
also sees the release of an updated Beauty and the Beast with live-action 
versions of Mulan, Peter Pan, Aladdin and the Little Mermaid also in the offing.

It’s been a less successful run for Smith, whose last film Collateral Beauty 
received largely negative reviews (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it a
“horrifyingly yucky, toxically cutesy ensemble dramedy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/collateral-beauty-review-will-smith-helen-mirren-keira-knightley>
) and tanked at the box office with just $29m in the US. He’s next to be seen 
in the Netflix action fantasy Bright, where he plays a cop partnered with an 
orc and sequel Bad Boys for Life.
