No animated feature has ever won the Academy Award for best picture, and 
that’s not going to change this year.Inside Out may be the very best film of 
2015 (in my opinion), and with the recently expanded best picture field it has 
a shot at a nomination, but its greatest chances of statuette success are in 
the animated feature category.Room is devastating, and Carol is a note-perfect 
adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel, but all eyes will probably be on the 
grippingSpotlight on the night. Oh, and fingers crossed for a Mad Max: Fury Road
nomination.

Best director

■ Céline Sciamma – Girlhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode>
 (winner)
■ Lenny Abrahamson – Room
■ JJ Abrams – Star Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/20/star-wars-the-force-awakens-observer-review-mark-kermode>
■ Tom McCarthy – Spotlight
■ George Miller – Mad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/mad-max-fury-road-review-mark-kermode>


Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood is one of the 305 features listed as eligible in the 
88th Academy Awards, but I doubt whether many Oscar voters have seen or even 
heard of the movie. Which is a real shame because it’s one of the most 
remarkable films of recent years, and Sciamma’s work on it is outstanding. Of 
the more populist pictures, George Miller and Ridley Scott may well pick up 
nominations forMad Max: Fury Road and The Martian (although JJ Abrams has the 
edge for me withStar Wars: The Force Awakens), but the bookies currently have 
Alejandro González Iñárritu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu> (The Revenant) 
and Tom McCarthy fighting it out on the night.

It’s clearly Leonardo DiCaprio’s turn to win, and his beardy anguish in The 
Revenantlooks set to finally earn him an Oscar. Personally, I’d go for Michael 
Fassbender <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> in Steve Jobs, 
although hats off to Matt Damon for turning in one of the most entertaining 
performances of the year inThe Martian. I loved Paul Dano as Brian Wilson in 
Love & Mercy, but if he gets a look in it’ll doubtless be in the supporting 
actor category (the distinctions really baffle me!). And hats off to Samuel L 
Jackson who somehow manages to hold Tarantino’s baggyThe Hateful Eight together 
– a feat worthy of an award!

Best actress

■ Karidja Touré – Girlhood (winner)
■ Cate Blanchett – Carol
■ Brie Larson – Room
■ Saoirse Ronan – Brooklyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan>
■ Lily Tomlin – Grandma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/13/grandma-observer-film-review>


Once again, my vote would go to a complete outsider. Karidja Touré was 
nominated for a most promising actress César, but there’s zero chance of her 
being recognised at theOscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> for her 
brilliant central role inGirlhood. In her absence, I’d go for either Brie 
Larson inRoom or Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn, although competition in this 
category is extraordinarily strong. Others who deserve a place on the list 
include Charlotte Rampling for45 Years and Cate Blanchett’s Carol co-star 
Rooney Mara who, for campaign reasons, may end up triumphing in the supporting 
actress category.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/bridge-of-spies-review-tom-hanks-mark-rylance-steven-spielberg>
■ Jacob Tremblay – Room


Idris Elba dominates Beasts of No Nation, but he’s up for supporting actor at 
the Globes and is a frontrunner, along with Mark Rylance, in the same category 
at the Oscars. He gets my vote, although Jacob Tremblay deserves recognition 
for his remarkable performance inRoom. I’d also love to see Will Poulter 
nominated forThe Revenant and John Boyega for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but 
sadly that isn’t going to happen…

As with the best actress category, there’s a superfluity of great performances 
to choose from here. The bookies have Rooney Mara forCarol and Alicia Vikander 
(twice! – forEx Machina as well as The Danish Girl) battling it out for the top 
spot in roles that could equally be considered lead performances. Personally, I 
was very impressed by Julia Garner, who proved a terrific foil for Lily Tomlin 
inGrandma, but who sadly seems to have slipped under the voters’ radars.

I’m passing on this category because, as the Observer’s weekly film critic, I 
haven’t seen such acclaimed front-runners asSon of Saul, which has yet to open 
here in the UK. But for what it’s worth, I’m a tad disappointed that neither 
Taiwan’sThe Assassin, nor Sweden’s A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on 
Existence, nor indeed the UK’s own Under Milk Wood (submitted in its Welsh 
language version) made the Oscar longlist announced last month.

I first saw Charlie Kaufman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/07/subversive-allure-stop-motion-anomalisa-tim-burton>
 and Duke Johnson’s stop‑motion drama in perfect surroundings. Like its hero, I 
was alone, abroad, knackered, staying at a bland upmarket hotel, in a Stepford 
development, increasingly unable to distinguish between people. But even in 
London,Anomalisa – in which a customer sales guru falls in love and suffers a 
breakdown – is a masterpiece: technically extraordinary, emotionally 
annihilating and very, very funny. It’s probably miles too bleak to actually be 
up for the big prize; likewise far too upsetting – and full-frontal – to take 
even the best animation award. But this, like45 Years, is life-altering art, to 
make you comprehend the world a little more, to leave it a little richer.

I hated Birdman. I found it irritating and unengaging, its splashy stylings 
not the product of narrative but ego and self-satisfaction. But I think
Alejandro González Iñárritu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/03/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-interview-the-revenant>
 ought to take the prize again this year.The Revenant is an extraordinary piece 
of film-making. Don’t be distracted by the hype and myths of bear-rape and 
bison-guzzling. This is just gripping, immense storytelling, with an epic 
visual fluency unlike anything I’ve seen before.The Lobster is being sorely 
ignored this season, by the way, but Yorgos Lanthimos’s wit and innovation 
can’t compare with this level of ingenuity.

A tough category, this: a roll-call of great performances with no knockout 
victor. Ben Foster’s sociopathic portrayal ofLance Armstrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/26/lance-armstrong-cheat-again-doping-cycling>
 is being overlooked; likewise Tom Hanks’s sturdy, seamless Jimmy Stewart 
impression. But the one who pushed the boat furthest for me this year was Ralph 
Fiennes for his fantastically slappable turn inLuca Guadagnino

follows his shock comedy turn inThe Grand Budapest Hotel with his most 
memorable outing yet. Harry, his ageing record producer here, is an 
irresistible riot: rude, charming – and usually nude.

Andrew Haigh’s devastating drama sort of ought to win everything. I’d hoped 
the Baftas would oblige with a landslide; instead they snubbed it in every 
category save best British film. They even failed to nominateRampling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlotte-rampling> for her most bracing role 
in years, as the housewife who finds her long-standing marriage - plus 
everything she’s ever really believed in - under threat from the spectre of her 
husband’s former girlfriend. Rampling’s face at a couple of key moments will 
haunt me for ever. And I just loved the scenes in which her character goes 
shopping in Norwich, crowds around her utterly unaware of Rampling’s celebrity; 
as much an alien-in-disguise as Scarlett Johansson inUnder the Skin

’s false-nose reinvention inFoxcatcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/foxcatcher-review-steve-carell-excels-real-life-tragedy-wrestling-schultz>

outrage inThe Big Short, Adam McKay’s oddly successful adaptation of the 
Michael Lewis book about the2007 housing crash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/18/housingmarket>. Indignation 
is a natural metier for Carell; this is a terrific turn in a surprisingly fine 
comedy. Nine-year-old Jacob Tremblay gives what’s strictly the best performance 
of these five as the kidnapped boy inRoom – but he’s either the finest actor 
ever or simply not capable of knowing quite what he was up to. Let’s reserve 
the prize for a time if and when the first is proved correct.

but it was Tilda Swinton who gave maybe the year’s most all-round amazing

commissions (“Research whether garlic makes semen taste any different”) and her 
rigorous lack of taste or compassion, this was a creation both grotesquely 
funny and completely plausible. An inspiration, really.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/12/force-majeure-film-review-ruben-ostlund-avalanche>

Last year was an exceptional one for this category: Leviathan and Ida are 
contenders for the best film of all time, let alone just not in English and 
released in 2015. But anyhow, luckily, my top foreign language film for the 12 
months is the one pretty much guaranteed to win:Son of Saul, an extraordinary 
look at the life of oneSonderkommando  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/geza-rohrig-son-of-saul-interview-auschwitz-jewish-prisoner-sonderkommando>
(a Jewish prisoner forced to work in the gas chambers) at Auschwitz in 1944. 
It’s ethically as well as logistically ambitious, truly important and – 
obviously – deeply moving. Plus it’s by a 38-year-old first-time director, 
starring a man who’s never acted on screen before.

Andrew Haigh’s gentle flesh wound of a marital drama, 45 Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/30/45-years-charlotte-rampling-tom-courtenay-review-mark-kermode>
, is also pick of the week in my DVD column, but it’s worth getting repeatedly 
evangelical over. While Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay have deservedly 
been rewarded for their exquisitely pitched performances as a retired couple at 
a gaping romantic impasse, the film is so much more than a thespian showcase. 
Every shot and cut counts in the scheme of Haigh’s refined-yet-acute visual 
storytelling, while his script — adapting and enriching the short story from 
which it stems — is a masterclass in literary distillation and cinematic 
repurposing.

Todd Haynes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/todd-haynes-interview-carol-frock-film-cate-blanchett-rooney-mara>
 this one. It’s the year’s most immaculate feat of direction, marshalling the 
film’s every ravishing craft element — Ed Lachman’s icicled 16mm 
cinematography, Carter Burwell’s swooning score, Sandy Powell’s droolworthy 
ensembles of mink and plaid — not just into a rigorously disciplined throwback 
aesthetic, but a porcelain surface to be cracked by the film’s own subtle 
emotional violence, just as its lovers grow to see each other after so much 
enraptured looking. Few working film-makers have quite such a nuanced, 
nimble-fingered command of mise-en-scène.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/09/jason-bateman-my-dirty-secret-playing-the-straight-man-because-he-gets-to-be-in-every-scene>
 an undervalued (and, more crucially, undertested performer, so “revelation”

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/09/the-gift-film-review-joel-edgerton-jason-bateman-rebecca-hall>
. But he surprised me nonetheless, putting a daring, devastating twist on a 
screen persona — the amiably glib American suburbanite — that he has hitherto 
so comfortably established, dredging up reserves of coiled rage and 
self-loathing spite beneath the bland jocularity. He doesn’t have a prayer of 
Oscar recognition, but it’s far gutsier work than much of the ostentatious 
method acting and mannered biopic impersonations that will fill the category 
next week.

Best actress proffers a much richer and more varied field of possibilities

’s late-career peak, yet this differently textured study in mourning — if not 
for a lover, then for a more certain past — might just have topped it. A 
wordless revelation scene in a dusty attic, as crushed realisation, sorrow and 
anger spread simultaneously across that mesmerising face, should clinch her 
every prize going.

such in 2012’sMagic Mike 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/15/magic-mike-steven-soderbergh-review>
that it seemed fair to assume this hard-partyingsequel <http:> would suffer for 
his absence. Instead, like much else about the enterprise, the film took a 
female-targeted slant that paid off. As sleekly controlling club owner Rome, a 
role originally conceived for a man,Pinkett Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/24/jada-pinkett-smith-gloria-madagascar>
 refashioned it as a tangy celebration of black female empowerment, wholly on 
top even in her bristling sexual chemistry with Tatum. Too often brushed aside 
as Mrs Will Smith, she’s never been this electric on screen.

, for example) aren’t even in the hunt. I’ve picked from the official 
submissions, though most of my choices have already been knocked out in a 
preliminary vote: among them, the second chapter ofArabian Nights, Miguel 
Gomes’s astonishing six-hour triptych in which mythical lore and political 
rhetoric combine for an alternately elegiac, furious and wildly funny 
meditation on storytelling, ghost dogs and contemporary economic blight. It’s 
not yet out in the UK, but it’s worth the wait.

Ukrainian director Miroslav Slaboshpitsky’s feature debut blew audiences’ 
minds with its radically original, audacious take on the societal exploitation 
that flourishes from neglect. Filmed entirely in unsubtitled sign language but 
direct as a hammer-blow,The Tribe is set in a boarding school for the deaf 
that’s a front for organised crime, where a shy new student must adapt. Its 
absorbing, brutal dance couldn’t be further from the sentimental lens 
guaranteed to make Oscar voters well up. But while its form of daring 
confrontation might not speak their language – or that of Ukraine’s Oscar 
committee, which provoked a scandal when it wasn’t put forward as the country’s 
foreign film entry –The Tribe deserves an accolade as the year’s cinematic 
event.

Endlessly inventive director Todd Haynes has consistently sidestepped 
convention to find novel ways to connect us with richly complex outsider 
characters, from his earlySuperstar: The Karen Carpenter Story 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rACJWPd3VnI>, which used Barbie dolls to enact 
its take on troubled celebrity toI’m Not There 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/23/drama.heathledger>, in which Bob 
Dylan was played by six actors (including Cate Blanchett). His sense of genuine 
daring is fully matured in the gorgeously sensuous and melancholyCarol, his 
adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel, about the love affair between a 
society wife (Blanchett again) and a shop assistant (Rooney Mara) in 50s New 
York. Haynes’s nuanced feel for the pervasive dangers in a reputation-obsessed 
society blends with a transporting sense of period detail and atmosphere.

Oscar contention is not just about career-high performances, but also playing 
the awards game relentlessly. In the brutalThe Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio plays 
a 19th-century fur trapper who goes on a gruelling epic revenge journey after 
being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow hunters. With grisly 
tales of the star having to eat raw bison, sleep in an animal carcass and risk 
hypothermia in frozen lakes, this is the perfect role for award-season hustle, 
The only thing more punishing would be not even an Oscar nom, since he’s 
considered a shoo-in to win. We can be cynical about the campaigning side of 
the race – but for a consistently great actor who’s never won an Oscar despite 
his four acting nominations, it’s high time “poor Leo” bagged one.

astonishingly life-affirming film is its soul-wrenching depiction of hope’s 
survival in the most arid of circumstances. An 11ft-square cramped garden shed 
is the space in which a captive mother (Brie Larson) must use her imagination 
as her greatest resource to create the means of inner survival for her and her 
five-year-old son. That’s no easy call for an actress - especially as physical 
escape is only the beginning of the kind of isolation the trauma-racked pair 
are plunged into when grappling to regain normality. Larson’s emotionally 
articulate, searingly real grasp of the outer reaches of human despair and 
transformation makes for the performance of her career, and is everything in 
carrying this remarkable film.

Brooklyn is a sentimental, humour-tinged romantic drama about immigrants 
coming to America that caters to audiences looking for big-hearted, 
old-fashioned idealism even as it intelligently updates its tale for 
progressive sensibilities, making its Irish heroine a career-minded, practical 
young woman who is hesitant to bend her life for her lovestruck boyfriend. As 
the Italian lad in question, Emory Cohen (alongside a vibrant Saoirse Ronan) is 
just the right blend of jolty inexperience, candid decency and tousled charm to 
breathe bracing life into what is a likable but safe film, making us root for 
him as other options crowd in to complicate love’s path. Cohen is used to 
showing his acting talents in more under-the-radar indie fare such as Derek 
Cianfrance’sThe Place Beyond the Pines, and this movie should see him 
deservedly noticed.

The blistering energy, raw candour and attitude of low-budget indie breakout 
hitTangerine are its heart, and for this we have its actresses to thank. Mya 
Taylor plays Alex, a trans street worker who careers through the streets with 
her friend Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) as a cheating pimp boyfriend and 
Armenian taxi driver with a crush cause them complications. She was street-cast 
by director Sean Baker, who lives near the LA doughnut shop that serves as the 
hub of the film’s drama. Taylor would be the first trans actor to be 
Oscar-nominated, a strong sign of change afoot in a Hollywood casting bubble 
which sees trans roles monopolised by cisgender celebs when trans actors are 
struggling to work(Jared Leto’s Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club in 2014 prompted 
outcry in the trans community 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/05/jared-leto-heckled-trans-misogyny-dallas-buyers-club>
). A win might just see the big studios catch onto what they’ve been missing.

In his innovative feature debut, Hungarian director László Nemes attempts a 
whole new way of depicting the Holocaust. Roberto Benigni garnered controversy 
for mixing comedy with tragedy in portraying this modern-era cataclysm withLife 
Is Beautifulin 1998 but still won the Best Foreign Film category. Son of Saul 
stays unremittingly grim. Instead of consoling us with idealistic heroes, it 
immerses us in a hellish assault of sensory impressions as we follow close-in 
with a Sonderkommando prisoner (Geza Rohrig) working the crematoriums at 
Auschwitz, going about his daily tasks with traumatised disconnect. A more 
ambiguous spiritual hope glimmers. The film honours the sonorities of speech as 
historical memory, with Yiddish (a language that almost disappeared in the 
Holocaust) among the eight heard. A win for this film, deemed too risky to 
finance by numerous funders, would be a call for the revitalising powers of 
cinematic daring.
