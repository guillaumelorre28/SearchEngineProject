David Helliwell (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/09/grist-for-the-chattering-classes>
, 9 May) repeats the tired cliche that Camden is full of middle-class liberals 
who aren't in touch with "real issues", in contrast with common-sense 
Doncaster. In terms of social class, this is misleading. Camden and Doncaster 
have nearly the same number of people employed in manufacturing – Camden 
10,900, Doncaster 11,000, according to the Office of National Statistics. 
Camden has 23,665 council homes, with 15,213 people on its waiting lists; 
Doncaster has 21,000 council homes, with 10,438 on the waiting list. From 
2009-10 there were 17,500 people in Camden classed as "economically inactive 
looking for work"; in Doncaster there were 16,000.

It is also politically misleading. The people of Doncaster use the AV system 
<http://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/lifestyle/columnists/alternative_vote_we_ve_been_using_it_for_years_1_3144932>
 to elect their mayor. He is not a socialist working-class hero, but an English 
Democrat, ex-teacher. Meanwhile in Camden we have one of the largest 
constituency Labour parties in the country, with nearly 1,400 members.

• There may not be much remaining of the woollen industry in Yorkshire but 
there's evidently enough left to pull over the eyes of the dinosaur-tendency in 
the Labour party there. Thanks, Doncaster (No to AV, 73% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/06/av-referendum-results-map>
) for playing the willing dupe to the bankers and stockbrokers of Surrey Heath 
(No, 75%). Thanks, Labour No voters, for undermining the authority and 
credibility of your party leader. Thanks for helping to ensure that in the 
Midlands we'll have to endure many years of unpopular Conservative MPs voted in 
by a minority.
