Nine years ago, I met a wonderful woman with whom I fell in love very deeply; 
we had the most amazing connection and I learned so much from her. Then, five 
years ago, she dumped me. It was a huge shock and utterly devastating. She 
wanted to be friends, but I had to make a total break or I would have lived in 
constant agony. It took a good couple of years to get over, but now I have a 
very good life, and a relationship with another very special person. A few 
weeks ago, my ex’s family contacted me to say she is terminally ill and wants 
to see me again before she dies. Part of me feels surprisingly tense, hurt and 
angry at the prospect; part of me feels calm and curious and wants to meet 
briefly to say goodbye. What should I do?
