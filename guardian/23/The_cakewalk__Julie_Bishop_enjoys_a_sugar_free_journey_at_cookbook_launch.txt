Julie Bishop <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/julie-bishop> stepped 
into a packed crowd and faced the media throng. But this time there would be no 
press conference or taking of questions from the underdressed media about 
banning asylum seekers in offshore detention from coming to Australia. There 
was sugar-free cake to be baked.

The foreign minister launched a sugar-free cookbook written by her friend 
Carolyn Hartz on Monday night, describing it as a “timely reminder of the need 
to commit to healthy lifestyle” given the obesity epidemic in Australia and the 
Asia-Pacific.


After a day spent in Melbourne fielding questions about the government’s new 
asylum seeker laws

, Bishop ended it with a high tea at the Grand Hyatt hotel to launch Hartz’s 
cookbook and to hear about people’s sugar-free journeys.

Also attending was Bishop’s partner, David Panton, stars from the reality 
television show The Real Housewives ofMelbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne>, and the promoter for 
Arnold Schwarzenegger in Australia, Tony Doherty. Guests were promised Robert 
De Niro’s “favourite VDKA 6100 cocktails”, which were handed around on silver 
platters, though the actor himself was not in attendance.

The celebration of the book of sugar-free recipes began with an operatic 
performance of the song Hallelujah, before Bishop took the podium.

There was a link between the book, titled Sugar Free Baking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/baking>, and a very serious issue, 
Bishop told attendees. “The fact that our health budget and our health policies 
focus very much on the increasing burden of chronic diseases means that we must 
commit anew to healthy lifestyles,” she said.

“This is a focus of the government’s preventative health policies. It’s also a 
focus of our foreign aid polices in the Pacific, in our region. We see the 
shocking paradox of under nutrition caused by poor diet, which has an adverse 
impact on the development of children, and which also contributes to chronic 
disease, particularly obesity and diabetes.

“And so I think this book is a timely reminder of the need to commit to 
healthy lifestyle.”

The book also epitomised the mantra “everything in moderation”, Bishop added. 
To polite applause and delighted chuckles from the Melbourne elite, she closed 
by saying that with this particular cookbook, “You can have your cake and eat 
it.”

She was immediately whisked away to film a cooking demonstration for the 
Channel Seven program Sunrise, an intimidating pile of radishes and hundreds of 
fresh strawberries laid out in preparation.
