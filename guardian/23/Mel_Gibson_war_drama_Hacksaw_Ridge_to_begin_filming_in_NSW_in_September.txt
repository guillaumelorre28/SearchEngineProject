minister for the arts, Troy Grant, at a press conference in Sydney to announce 
the production. Grant said the film will bring 720 jobs and A$26m (US$19m) to

The film tells the story of conscientious objector and Seventh-Day Adventist 
Desmond Doss, who refused to kill or bear arms because of his religious 
beliefs, but served as a medic alongside the Americans fighting the Japanese in 
the Pacific.

The film focuses on the 1945 battle of Okinawa, where Doss single-handedly 
moved 75 injured men to safety under enemy fire. He was awarded the 
congressional medal of honour for his bravery by US President Harry Truman and 
was also awarded a Purple Heart three times and a Bronze star medal. The 
Amazing Spider-Man star, Garfield, will play Doss.
