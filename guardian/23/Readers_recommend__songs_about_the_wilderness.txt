“Laws change; people die; the land remains,” said Abraham Lincoln. “Wilderness 
is the preservation of the world,” added Henry David Thoreau. And 
environmentalist Sigurd Olson put it that: “Wilderness is a spiritual 
necessity, an antidote to the high pressure of modern life, a means of 
regaining serenity and equilibrium.” So this week we’re getting away from it 
all. To the forests of the Amazon, the deserts of the Atacama or Sahara, the 
grasslands of the Serengeti, the mountains of Nepal, or even Virginia, the 
wilds of Scotland’s Highlands, the Australian bush, frozen Alaska, China above 
the clouds, Mongolia’s plains, to the most treacherous oceans or even the cold, 
indifferent remoteness of space itself. But we are not entirely alone. There 
are still the echoes of songs from and inspired by these and many other places.

Sounds of and feelings about wilderness reverberate in many musical genres, 
from the bluegrass of the Appalachian Mountains around Kentucky, Tennessee and 
the Mississippi, to blues, and folk’s many mixed forms, including from the 
various British Isles. It can be heard in modern classical and electronic 
music, the pop and electronica from Scandinavia and Iceland, and a wealth of 
forms across Africa and Asia. But there are no genres where wilderness is not 
heard, whether in lyric, or influence or sound.

But what is it about wilderness that inspires? Awe and wonder, fear and 
excitement? Place to find or lose yourself? Above everything, wilderness is all 
about extremes. It can give us great serenity, but it can threaten us. It can 
be life-giving in its resources, but ruthless, indifferent and unfeeling. 
Wilderness is vital to the environment but also precarious, as endangered as it 
is dangerous. Wilderness is within us, and your song choices might express a 
pioneering spirit, or a savage heart reconciling itself with the tamer modern 
world. But go back and try to take a bite out of nature, and it will most 
definitely bite back. So your songs may also be about journeys through the 
wild, a sense of isolation, adventure or survival. Or about conservation of 
land that is being lost, destroyed, or stolen. Or about people who have 
ventured into it, found themselves, but then never return.

The wilderness, and music inspired by it, is particularly vivid in many books 
and films. TheJack London’s Call of the Wild (1903) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/100-best-novels-call-of-the-wild-jack-london>
 follows a pet dog, Buck, who ends up being stolen to become a sled dog, and 
after a series of heartbreaking adventures, finally joins with wolves, never to 
return. It was one of my favourites as a child, and I really wanted to join a 
pack of wolves too. Instead I joined the local choir and played football with 
the kids in our street. Not far off. And who can forgetThe Incredible Journey 
(1963) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Journey_%28film%29>, also 
from a book, about two pet dogs and a cat who somehow find their way home 
across 250 miles of Canadian wilderness?

Moving into slightly less innocent youth, it was also no coincidence that my 
interest in Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, with its frightening hand/branch 
tapping on the window and moorland passion of Catherine and Heathcliff, arrived 
at the same time discovering an early sexual awakening in the form of oneKate 
Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush>.

 Look who’s out on the windy moors. Wrap up, love, or you’ll catch your death 
The wilderness, and all its excitement, always has a darker side. Into the 
Wild (2007) is a powerful portrayal of the true story of Christopher 
McCandless, a bright and fearlessly independent young man, who after graduation 
in 1990, decided to reject conventional life, destroyed all his credit cards 
and identity documents, gave away most of his savings to charity and set off on 
a wild adventure across the American west, eventually hitchhiking his way to 
Alaska, and ending up living off the land in a disused bus. Despite his huge 
determination, energy, and resourcefulness, wilderness eventually got the 
better of him. It is a profound, moving and tragic story of how the wilderness 
brings complete freedom, but can also strip an individual of everything - body, 
mind and soul.

The wilderness doesn’t always beat us, but if not, it can get very close. 
Touching the Void, the 1988 book and later film, recounts climber Joe Simpson’s 
extraordinary feat of crawling miles back to camp with a broken leg after he 
fell down a crevasse. Reaching near-insanity at times, one of the oddest 
recollections is havingBoney M’s Brown Girl in the Ring 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiX2PbrBXCQ> going endlessly round and round 
his head as he contemplated his own death. Very frightening indeed.

 Touching the nerves ... Boney M 
Deliverance (1972, directed by John Boorman) is another brilliant 
white-knuckle ride of a film. Starring Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight, it follows 
four foolish white, middle-class guys who decide to take a canoe trip down the
Cahulawassee River <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahulawassee_River>, and has 
music that’s just as catchy, but not as cheesy, as the inescapable Boney M. For 
anyone who remembers its scariest scenes, it proves that wilderness is not only 
about forests, rapids, creeks and other dangerous environments, but the people 
who live there.

 Deliverance from ... evil or E flat? 
More offbeat expressions of the nature of wilderness includes Wim Wenders’ 
Paris, Texas (1984) which begins with a haunting scene, with Ry Cooder’s guitar 
to match, of amnesiac Harry Dean Stanton wandering aimlessly through the South 
Texas desert landscape. Fitzcarraldo is Werner Herzog’s unhinged masterpiece 
about Klaus Kinski’s rubber trading fanatic who tries to drag a huge ship up 
and over a steep hill near the Peruvian Amazon. He is also obsessed with 
bringing opera to the region, and plays Caruso on a 78 gramophone down the 
river to bemused natives. Finally, for a broader perspective, 
Koyaanisqatsi (1978) is an extraordinary dialogue-free trip across the world 
capturing the wildernesses of mountains, air, forests, deserts and sea, and the 
ever-changing scenes of cityscapes, where wilderness could be perceived in 
another form.
