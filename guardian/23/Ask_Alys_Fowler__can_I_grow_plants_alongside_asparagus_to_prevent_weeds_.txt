I seem to be wasting a lot of time and energy weeding my asparagus, then 
struggling to keep the bed from drying out. I realise the traditional way to 
grow it is to keep it asparagus only, but wouldn’t it benefit the asparagus to 
have a non-weed, shallow-growing ground cover, such as wild strawberries?

I agree with you wholeheartedly, but all my attempts to grow asparagus with 
other things have failed. Asparagus seems to resent any sort of competition – 
though clover may work if the asparagus is really well established.

My mother had amazing beds of asparagus that were more than 50 years old when 
she first found them under 5ft of weeds. Large parts of my childhood seemed 
to be dominated by watching her on her hands and knees, lovingly hand weeding 
them back into life. Once free of competition, they truly did thrive. She 
poured compost on them, and I think that is the answer to keeping asparagus 
plants moist. Try adding lots and lots of compost in autumn and again in early 
spring – that should do the trick.
