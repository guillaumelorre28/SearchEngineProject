I’ve not had much sympathy with all the talk of British sovereignty and 
tradition floating around of late. As a young, progressive woman (and a migrant 
to boot), most of the stuff that’s deemed classically British seems dull at 
best, alienating and racist at double worst. Yet it was with horror that I read 
that Cluedo, Britain’s favourite way to make light of homicide from 1944 until 
whenever Midsomer Murders started to air, isdoing away permanently with one of 
its characters 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/05/cluedo-kills-off-mrs-white-and-replaces-her-with-new-female-char/>

Are these the 10 worst board games of all time?

Mrs White, the chef, maid and all-round keeper of Tudor Mansion, is no longer 
a suspect in the ghoulish perpetual resurrection and slaying cycle of poor Dr 
Black. Instead, the game has introduced Dr Orchid, Dr Black’s adopted daughter. 
A brilliant scientist in her own right, Cluedo lore has it that she was mostly 
raised by Mrs White, giving her replacement of the character a seriously 
Shakespearean vibe.

This is one of many modernising moves Hasbro has made over the years to make 
the game more easy to relate to. Professor Plum, for example,has been a video 
game designer in some editions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/cluedo-new-rebrand-family>
, though it seems unwise to remind children playing a board game that video 
games exist. The original lead pipe tokens were even replaced when it was 
discovered they contained real lead. It’s political correctness gone mad! 
What’s a little poisoning between friends/fellow suspects?

If board games must modernise (and apparently they must, if only to appease 
social media), it’s important that they stay within the realm of likelihood. Dr 
Orchid, who is a woman of colour working as a doctor, is sure to catchNigel 
Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>’s eye but is 
otherwise an acceptable and realistic upgrade. But what about other bastions of 
Traditional English Values?

Gone are the days when a dog could own property in London. Those baby boomer 
dogs with their Mayfair kennels may talk a good game about saving their kibble 
and bones but realistically, the market is impossible for young pups to break 
into. An updated board would surely feature dilapidated rental properties in 
Walthamstow which the dog is forced to share with the thimble and the iron (and 
you just know that the thimble leaves their dishes in the sink).

Rather than spending time in jail, each character must periodically do The 
Weekly Tesco Shop, which takes them out of commission for at least a turn. 
Also, I’ve lived in London for four years and have yet to be invited to take 
part in any beauty contests, let alone come second in one. I refuse to believe 
this is a value judgment about me, so that card has to go.

Triv has long been a battleground for generational divides, with each age 
group believing their edition to be superior. My immediate family includes 
boomers, Gen X-ers and me, a lowly Y, and we solved this problem by mixing 
cards from our various copies together to even up the playing field. As a brief 
aside, I don’t remember my family every actually buying new editions and am 
thus forced to conclude that the game reproduces in a manner akin to a 
single-celled organism, evolving slightly over time.

The game must now surely embrace celebrity culture – just replace the Arts & 
Literature category and be done with it. I fully expect to one day read a card 
asking me to matchTaylor Swift’s albums 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/15/taylor-swift-wins-album-of-the-year-at-the-2016-grammys-for-1989>
 to the ex-boyfriends that inspired them (a question that, for the record, I 
could smash out of the park). After all, board games apparently must hold, as 
‘twere, the mirror up to nature.

Only this can remain untouched, for while human needs may change, the 
biological needs of hippopotamuses are eternal.

Our favourite games may be evolving with the times but have faith. Though 
Cluedo have seen fit to eliminate Mrs White, Colonel Mustard – the hunter and 
colonial imperialist – remains. For what would Britain be without old white men 
banging on about the good old days? Perish the thought.
