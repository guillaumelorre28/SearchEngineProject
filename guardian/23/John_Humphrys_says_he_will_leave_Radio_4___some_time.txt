He has been known as the “Rottweiler of Radio 4” for almost three decades, but 
John Humphrys <https://www.theguardian.com/media/john-humphrys> has revealed 
that his days behind the Today programme microphone are nearing an end.

Perhaps Britain’s most feared political interviewer, the 73-year-old said his 
departure from the agenda-setting show could come next week, next month or next 
year.

Taken to task in the Times magazine 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/thetimesmagazine/what-will-john-humphrys-do-next-vh5f0t2kh>
 for giving the sort of vague answer that would enrage him on air, Humphrys 
said he would not cover another general election: “That’s another three and a 
half years away, and it’s unlikely I’ll be there in three years. Extremely 
unlikely.”

Next year will mark his 30th anniversary as a Today presenter, and he is 
writing a book to be published when he finally hangs up the headphones.

John Humphrys on Twitter, TV and why 'sitting down is the new smoking'

“Will I be there in a year? I don’t know,” he said. “Today does make – even 
though I only do it a maximum four days a week – huge demands on you. 
Increasingly I think: ‘Yeah, there really are things I want to do.’ So I 
suppose one has to, you know…”

Humphrys also revealed that he recently wrote a resignation email in a “fit of 
anger” – thought to be about the Today presenting schedule around the time of 
the EU referendum vote.

“The absolute truth – but I am not going into any details, which will be 
frustrating for you – [is that I did] pen something, and didn’t in the end 
[resign] because it was pre-empted,” he told the Times. “It was something about 
which there was a certain amount of tension and I felt fairly strongly. And 
that was that. But that is as much as you’ll get from me.”

While Humphrys declined to reveal how much he earned from the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> – “I have as much as I need” – he 
confessed a reluctance to throw away spoiled food. “If there is a little bit of 
mould, how long does it take to scrape it off?”


It may not come as a surprise to learn that Humphrys declared to the Radio 
Times earlier this year: “I do not do Facebook or Twitter. I am anti the sort 
of idiocies that Twitter frequently produces and baffled by people who feel 
they’ve got to be telling everybody what they’re doing all the time.”

Yet his preferred way to read is on an iPad – and at a stand-up desk. He also 
tried out a virtual reality headset on air in February, which left him feeling 
“a little seasick”.

Humphrys’s question: “Would virtual reality be able to replicate the 
experience of having sex?” helped him trend on Twitter for the first time. 
Unfortunately, the Twitterati got his name slightly wrong:
