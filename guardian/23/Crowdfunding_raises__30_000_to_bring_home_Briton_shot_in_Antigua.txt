A campaign to fly a British holidaymaker back to the UK after he was shot in 
the head during an attempted robbery in Antigua has raised more than £30,000.


Christopher Tester, from Torquay, is in an induced coma on the Caribbean 
island after he was attacked at his parents’ restaurant on Christmas Day night.

Tester, 37, is said to be in a critical condition and friends launched a 
fundraising appeal to fly him home.

An appeal on the Crowdfunder website

 has raised more than a third of its £90,000 target.

Tester’s parents, Tony and Gill, run the Boxer Shack restaurant in Old Road.

Police in Antigua said: “It is alleged that a man approximately 5ft 8in in 
height, slim built, wearing a black hoodie and mask, attempted to rob his 
family, when a struggle ensued.

“During the struggle he was shot in his head, and he was transported to the 
hospital.

“The incident occurred around 10.30pm on Sunday. He arrived on the island on 
10 December and was due to leave on 29 December.

“Investigations are currently ongoing.”
