 The BBC radio presenter Andy Kershaw was released from jail yesterday after 
spending six nights in custody for allegedly breaching a restraining order 
which banned him from approaching his former partner.
The Radio 3 world music DJ was granted bail at a court hearing on the Isle of 
Man. He was arrested by police last Wednesday near Juliette Banner's home in 
Peel and charged with approaching her in breach of an order she won against him 
on August 1, restricting his access to her home.

The deputy high bailiff's court in Douglas was told Ms Banner had made claims 
of harassment dating back to last October. She and Mr Kershaw, who have two 
children, were together for about 10 years and lived in north London until they 
moved to Peel in April 2006. Mr Kershaw, 48, was granted bail with a Â£2,000 
bond. He is also banned from entering pubs and restaurants selling alcohol.

He was given a curfew not to leave his property between 9pm and 7am and was 
reminded that the restraining order was still in force.

The court heard that Mr Kershaw, originally from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, 
worked with the Peel lifeboat and he was given permission to work beyond his 
curfew in that capacity.

His solicitor, Nigel Cordwell, asked for the matter to be adjourned for two 
weeks while he takes instructions from his client regarding pleas. It was 
relisted for September 18.
