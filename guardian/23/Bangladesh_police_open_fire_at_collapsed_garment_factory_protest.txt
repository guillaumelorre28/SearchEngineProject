Police in Bangladesh <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh> have 
opened fired at a protest by former workers of a factory making clothes for 
western retailers that collapsed, who had taken to the streets to complain at 
their treatment by the authorities since the disaster six weeks ago.

The protests took place close to the site of the former Rana Plaza factory, 
now entirely demolished, in Savar, Many garment factories are concentrated in 
the town near the capital Dhaka. The death toll from theRana Plaza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/rana-plaza> disaster now stands at 1,130.

Hundreds of protesters, including former workers as well as relatives of 
victims killed or injured, were demonstrating to demand compensation or 
outstanding salaries promised by the government and the main body representing 
local employers in the booming industry, the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers 
and Exporters Association (BGMEA).

Sheikh Farid Uddin, a Savar police official, said: "Workers protested for 
their compensation and back pay. They stopped traffic on the highway for three 
hours. We requested them to clear the road but they became agitated and began 
damaging public transport [vehicles]. We have detained two people."

Protesters denied causing any damage.

"We did not commit any vandalism but still the police opened fire and [used] 
teargas," said Fatema Khatun, 20, a protester and survivor of the collapse, who 
said she had yet to receive outstanding pay.

According to the local newspaper Prothom Alo, around 50 people were injured 
when police charged with batons. Police officials said any firing had been 
directed into the air. There have been several such protests in recent weeks. 
The BGMEA says outstanding dues have been paid.

The clashes came as Alan Duncan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanduncan>, the UK minister for 
international development called for retailers who source garments in 
Bangladesh to assume responsibility for the clothes they sell "from the shop to 
the sewing machine".

On the first visit by a senior British official to Bangladesh since the Rana 
Plaza collapse, Duncan said such firms had a duty of care to those who made 
products sold on high streets.

The British retailers Primark and Matalan have admitted sourcing clothes in 
the Rana Plaza factory. Official investigations haveblamed poor construction 
and corruption for the collapse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/24/bangladesh-building-collapse-kills-garment-workers>
. The owner, Sohel Rana, has been detained.

The garment industry in Bangladesh now exports $20bn (Â£13bn) of clothes each 
year. However, accidents are common. Last year, 114 people died in a fire.

Duncan told the Guardian: "The challenge is to cope with the success of this 
sector. In one sense, this is a fantastic development story. But there are 
large defects, and these exist because the setting of standards of employment 
rights, health and safety at work and building construction have not kept pace."

Last month's disaster was one of the world's worst industrial accidents. It 
has prompted criticism of major brands, which have been accused of sacrificing 
protection of workers in pursuit of profits.

Companies including Primark, Marks & Spencer, Mothercare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mothercare> and Next have recently signed 
up to a legally binding agreement committing them to improving and monitoring 
conditions in factories where clothes are sourced.
