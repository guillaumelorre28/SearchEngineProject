Summary: Monte dei Paschi bailout expected

Here’s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie 
Kirchgaessner <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner> 
(out in Rome):

The Italian government is braced to bail out the world’s oldest bank, Monte 
dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win 
support from private investors for a €5bn (£4.2bn) rescue package.

The board of Italy’s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live>
 after it failed to secure an anchor investor – thought to be the Qatar 
sovereign wealth fund – to support its fundraising effort.

Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling 
back in confusion about the next steps. The shares – down 85% this year – 
slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to 
bolster its finances after it was theweakest of 51 European banks subjected to 
stress tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests>
.

The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to €1bn is expected to lead the 
bank’s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its 
capital gap without the Italian government. This meansItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> would have to impose losses on 
bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to 
stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses.

However, about €2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are 
expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses.

The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options 
for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the 
bank to below 50%.

The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have 
political consequences for Italy’s controlling Democratic party and Matteo 
Renzi, the former prime minister whostepped down from office earlier this month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister>
 after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni 
has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for 
election again as early as next year.

Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue 
might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public 
attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the 
issue could become “politically toxic” later, once it becomes clear how many of 
the bank’s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and 
how long it takes for them to be paid....


 Piccoli said:

“In terms of the junior bondholders, let’s see what happens. it will 
eventually be decided by Brussels,”

Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government 
support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future.

“This will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will 
be used then [against Renzi’s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect 
that.”

Here’s their full story:

MPS shares hit new record low

Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, 
as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank.

After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at €15.08 - around 99.85% 
lower than in early 2007.

MPS’s apparent failure to raise €5bn in new capital means investors now expect 
the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a 
large stake in the bank.

Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says:

The failure of MPS to secure €5bn from an anchor investor will have far 
ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a €20bn bailout.

With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing 
Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe’s banking system as a 
whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone.

Will Italian cabinet meet tonight?

So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi?


We’re basically waiting for the bank’s board to conclude their meeting, and 
submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary €5bn 
from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet).

Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni’s court; will his 
cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday?

Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here’s their latest report:

Italy’s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European 
markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei 
Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a €20bn safety net that Prime 
Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry.

Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss 
measures to help Italy’s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention 
the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday.

European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day 
dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi.

London’s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals 
producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining 
stocks, and banks, led the fallers.

Across Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, Italy’s FTSE 
MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country’s biggest banking 
bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed 
flat.

Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the 
red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone.

Robert O’Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi 
is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise €5bn from private 
investors has faltered.

He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more 
banks require government help.

O’Daly writes:

 * We expect the state to approve the MPS board’s request to inject capital. 
This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to 
compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a €20bn fund 
to shore up MPS and other weak banks.

 * More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy’s banking woes would be 
manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of 
cleaning up the banks’ bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less.

 * If mishandled, MPS’s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other 
problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy’s next 
national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties 
provided by the resounding “no” vote at the referendum. Facebook

Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt.

The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 
19,933.

That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the 
much-obsessed about 20,000 mark.

Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the 
bank’s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,.

With MPS’s capital raising push now over, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585bd0f7e4b0966513aecae6#block-585bd0f7e4b0966513aecae6>
theFT says:

According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to 
approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS 
board has requested help.

The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of 
trading on Thursday, those people said.

The FT also reports that Rome’s government will try to protect small 
bondholders, if there is a bailout:

Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue 
will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them 
share some of the financial burden.

Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 
MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors 
would not be spared.

“The scheme is ready”, said one senior Italian official. “The burden-sharing 
principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as 
much as possible.

US growth revised up to new two-year high

Breaking news from America: the world’s largest economy grew even faster than 
previously thought in the third quarter of 2016.

US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up 
from a previous estimate of 3.2%.

That’s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much 
faster than Britain’s 0.5% growth in the same period.


This shows that America’s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, 
driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in 
companies restocking their inventories:

There’s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, 
including the news that


 * New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) 
jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales).

 * The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 
275,000 last week.

Monte dei Paschi board to meet as cash call ends

The clocks in Siena have chimed two o’clock, which means that Monte dei 
Paschi’s attempt to raise €5bn from private investors has officially ended.

Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have 
failed to hit its target.

As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise €2bn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b>
, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night.

One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan 
their next move. They could decide to ask Italy’s government for assistance 
tonight, to help the bank reach its €5bn target.

Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under 
European banking rules, these bondholders must be ‘bailed in’, before the state 
can help.

But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail 
investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by 
the world’s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating 
them (one theory is that anyone holding less than €100,000 of bonds is 
protected, as with retail savings accounts).

Monte dei Paschi isn’t the only Italian bank in a fix.

Economists estimate that Italy’s banking sector needs more than €50bn in fresh 
capital, to help it tackle its bad debts.

Unicredit, the country’s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a €13bn cash 
call last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/italian-banking-crisis-unicredit-to-raise-13bn-euros>
, but many other lenders have not yet acted.

This chart from Bloomberg shows how the €20bn set aside by the Italian 
government this week might not be enough:

 Photograph: Bloomberg 
Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the 
sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital.

He writes:

“Shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise 
private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund 
pulling out from the €5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay 
afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and 
negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such 
weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject 
more than €20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have 
far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its 
collapse could pull down much of the country’s bad debt ridden banking sector 
with it.

The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> because of billions of euros of 
risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the 
Italian government’s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather 
large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless 
this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a 
threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region’s 
political future.”

Weak pound prompts Tesla to hike prices in UK

Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its 
products in the UK, in response to the pound’s decline this year.

The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next 
month.

In an email, Tesla said:

We have just received some information that we need to share with you – due to 
currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 
5% on 1 January 2017.”

“Prices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.”

The fog has now lifted in London, but there’s little else to report from the 
City.

After three hours of trading, Europe’s financial markets still seem becalmed, 
as people wait forMonte dei Paschi’s cash call to formally end after lunchtime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b>
 (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT).


Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors 
head,Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):.

“This situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a 
solution is in sight.

My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial 
markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.”

But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn’t pleased that a 
rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b81bbe4b06265ff0d5a28#block-585b81bbe4b06265ff0d5a28>
):

Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as 
well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to 
complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up 
Italy’s knackered banks.

An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want 
clarity on the issue.

All has gone quiet in Italy, so I’m going to pause this liveblog - but I’ll 
try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise,keep an eye on the 
Guardian Business page <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business> for fresh 
developments.
 
Here’s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie 
Kirchgaessner <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner> 
(out in Rome):

The Italian government is braced to bail out the world’s oldest bank, Monte 
dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win 
support from private investors for a €5bn (£4.2bn) rescue package.

The board of Italy’s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live>
 after it failed to secure an anchor investor – thought to be the Qatar 
sovereign wealth fund – to support its fundraising effort.

Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling 
back in confusion about the next steps. The shares – down 85% this year – 
slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to 
bolster its finances after it was theweakest of 51 European banks subjected to 
stress tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests>
.

The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to €1bn is expected to lead the 
bank’s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its 
capital gap without the Italian government. This meansItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> would have to impose losses on 
bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to 
stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses.

However, about €2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are 
expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses.

The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options 
for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the 
bank to below 50%.

The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have 
political consequences for Italy’s controlling Democratic party and Matteo 
Renzi, the former prime minister whostepped down from office earlier this month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister>
 after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni 
has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for 
election again as early as next year.

Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue 
might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public 
attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the 
issue could become “politically toxic” later, once it becomes clear how many of 
the bank’s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and 
how long it takes for them to be paid....


 Piccoli said:

“In terms of the junior bondholders, let’s see what happens. it will 
eventually be decided by Brussels,”

Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government 
support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future.

“This will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will 
be used then [against Renzi’s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect 
that.”

Here’s their full story:


Italy poised to bail out Monte dei Paschi di Siena as rescue deal fails

Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, 
as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank.

After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at €15.08 - around 99.85% 
lower than in early 2007.

MPS’s apparent failure to raise €5bn in new capital means investors now expect 
the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a 
large stake in the bank.

Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says:

The failure of MPS to secure €5bn from an anchor investor will have far 
ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a €20bn bailout.

With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing 
Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe’s banking system as a 
whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone.

So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi?


We’re basically waiting for the bank’s board to conclude their meeting, and 
submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary €5bn 
from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet).

Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni’s court; will his 
cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday?

Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here’s their latest report:

Italy’s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European 
markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei 
Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a €20bn safety net that Prime 
Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry.

Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss 
measures to help Italy’s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention 
the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday.
 
European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day 
dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi.

London’s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals 
producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining 
stocks, and banks, led the fallers.

Across Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, Italy’s FTSE 
MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country’s biggest banking 
bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed 
flat.

Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the 
red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone.

Robert O’Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi 
is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise €5bn from private 
investors has faltered.

He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more 
banks require government help.

O’Daly writes:

 * We expect the state to approve the MPS board’s request to inject capital. 
This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to 
compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a €20bn fund 
to shore up MPS and other weak banks.

 * More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy’s banking woes would be 
manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of 
cleaning up the banks’ bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less.

 * If mishandled, MPS’s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other 
problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy’s next 
national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties 
provided by the resounding “no” vote at the referendum.   The open of Wall Street today Photograph: Bloomberg TV  
Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt.

The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 
19,933.

That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the 
much-obsessed about 20,000 mark.

Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the 
bank’s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,.

With MPS’s capital raising push now over,

theFT says:

According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to 
approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS 
board has requested help.

The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of 
trading on Thursday, those people said.

The FT also reports that Rome’s government will try to protect small 
bondholders, if there is a bailout:

Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue 
will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them 
share some of the financial burden.

Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 
MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors 
would not be spared.

“The scheme is ready”, said one senior Italian official. “The burden-sharing 
principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as 
much as possible.
 
Breaking news from America: the world’s largest economy grew even faster than 
previously thought in the third quarter of 2016.

US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up 
from a previous estimate of 3.2%.

That’s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much 
faster than Britain’s 0.5% growth in the same period.


This shows that America’s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, 
driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in 
companies restocking their inventories:

There’s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, 
including the news that


 * New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) 
jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales).

 * The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 
275,000 last week.

The clocks in Siena have chimed two o’clock, which means that Monte dei 
Paschi’s attempt to raise €5bn from private investors has officially ended.

Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have 
failed to hit its target.

As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise €2bn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b>
, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night.

One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan 
their next move. They could decide to ask Italy’s government for assistance 
tonight, to help the bank reach its €5bn target.

Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under 
European banking rules, these bondholders must be ‘bailed in’, before the state 
can help.

But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail 
investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by 
the world’s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating 
them (one theory is that anyone holding less than €100,000 of bonds is 
protected, as with retail savings accounts).
 
Monte dei Paschi isn’t the only Italian bank in a fix.

Economists estimate that Italy’s banking sector needs more than €50bn in fresh 
capital, to help it tackle its bad debts.

Unicredit, the country’s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a €13bn cash 
call last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/italian-banking-crisis-unicredit-to-raise-13bn-euros>
, but many other lenders have not yet acted.

This chart from Bloomberg shows how the €20bn set aside by the Italian 
government this week might not be enough:

 Photograph: Bloomberg 
Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the 
sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital.

He writes:

“Shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise 
private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund 
pulling out from the €5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay 
afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and 
negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such 
weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject 
more than €20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have 
far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its 
collapse could pull down much of the country’s bad debt ridden banking sector 
with it.

The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> because of billions of euros of 
risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the 
Italian government’s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather 
large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless 
this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a 
threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region’s 
political future.”
 
Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its 
products in the UK, in response to the pound’s decline this year.

The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next 
month.

In an email, Tesla said:

We have just received some information that we need to share with you – due to 
currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 
5% on 1 January 2017.”

“Prices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.”

The fog has now lifted in London, but there’s little else to report from the 
City.

After three hours of trading, Europe’s financial markets still seem becalmed, 
as people wait forMonte dei Paschi’s cash call to formally end after lunchtime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b>
 (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT).


Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors 
head,Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):.

“This situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a 
solution is in sight.

My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial 
markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.”

But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn’t pleased that a 
rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b81bbe4b06265ff0d5a28#block-585b81bbe4b06265ff0d5a28>
):

Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as 
well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to 
complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up 
Italy’s knackered banks.

An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want 
clarity on the issue.
