All over my lawn, I have holes that are 1-2 inches across but appear to lead 
into tunnels. What is making these holes? They are not big enough for rats or 
rabbits.
I went to see my mum and she took me through a lengthy tour of her field and 
all the holes it contains. Rabbit holes, mole holes, bee holes, mice holes – it 
was quite the tour, because every hole needed to be examined carefully. One of 
the holes was made by along-tailed field mouse 
<https://ptes.org/get-informed/facts-figures/wood-long-tailed-field-mouse/> 
(aka wood mouse) and it sounds very similar to yours – it’s about an inch 
across and leads to a burrow.

Their population can explode quickly if they like the conditions, and my mum 
tells me they can appear all over the place. Then at some critical mass it all 
gets too much and they move off to find new territory – overnight they seem to 
disappear.

Ask Alys: which flowers can I plant on a damp grave?

My mum was pleased when they returned because they are an important source of 
food for barn owls. She also told me this: there are probably more long-tailed 
field mice in this country than rats. They like to eat seeds, berries, snails, 
insects and fungi. I love her because she spends a lot of time looking at the 
world beneath her feet.
