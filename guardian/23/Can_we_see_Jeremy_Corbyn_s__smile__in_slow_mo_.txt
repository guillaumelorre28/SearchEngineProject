The highlight of Jeremy Corbyn’s latest speech now appears to be the 
imperceptible “smile” he allegedly let loose during the brief booing of a 
journalist. The Sun has even promoted the Telegraph’s “smile” to a “smirk”. 
Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodgesthinks  
<https://twitter.com/DPJHodges/status/738308777007550464>it was a “grin”. So 
that the parameters of appropriate personal expression may be known to one and 
all, perhaps this headline-worthy “smile”, like the insufficient depth of 
Corbyn’s bow at the Cenotaph, could be measured, frame by frame?

• I wish neoliberalism were dying, as Aditya Chakrabortty claims (Opinion

, 31 May). But isn’t privatisation of the Land Registry evidence to the 
contrary?

• Janet Russell (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/29/women-are-ready-to-take-on-fracking>
, 30 May) is totally correct in her assessment of the importance of women in 
protesting against fracking. It is significant that the council chosen to 
decide about licensing fracking was all male, majority Tory and no doubt 
grey-suited.

• I have to disagree that “it’s a bit of a tall order to be a role model and a 
believable character in a sitcom” (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/carla-lane-funny-women-norm-1980s>
, 2 June). Wolfie Smith and Victor Meldrew have both been admirable role models 
for me, albeit at different times of life.

• Here in my area of south-east Wales, the alleys are called the “back”. As in 
“come round the back when you come”. Back meaning “back alley”. Still part of 
everyday use (Letters

, 1 June).
