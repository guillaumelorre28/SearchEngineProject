Thirty-seven miserable years have passed since Affirmed last swept the Triple 
Crown, and the patience of racing enthusiasts the world over has worn thinner 
than American Pharoah’s threadbare tail – the result, so the story goes, of a 
covert attack by ravenous pasture mates.

During those 37 years, 13 horses before American Pharoah have arrived at 
Belmont Park brimming with Triple Crown aspirations, only to leave the premises 
with their hopes as deflated as a New England Patriots’ football. It’s been so 
long, some have dismissed the Triple Crown as all but unattainable – an argument
strung around a number of theories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/04/american-pharoah-at-belmont-why-is-it-so-hard-to-win-the-triple-crown>
. Perhaps the most oft-repeated of those arguments is that horses aren’t as 
robust as they used to be, not as physically resilient to the rigors of 
frequent competition as those hardy warhorses of yore.

Even so, there are anomalies to every rule, and American Pharoah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/american-pharoah> has all the classic 
hallmarks of an anomaly.

Seven horses and the stamina-sapping one-and-a-half miles around Belmont 
Park’s deep sandy trough stand between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes 
winner and a plinth of his own alongside the greats. Some of the competition 
he’s soundly beaten already. One he’s meeting for the first time. None, 
however, have shown the same work ethic as American Pharoah in recent weeks – 
he’s the only one in the field to have lined up at both Churchill Downs and 
Pimlico. Which begs the question: Is a very good horse with tired legs better 
on the day than a good horse with fresh legs?

So, without further ado, here’s a look at each of the contenders for the 147th 
running of theBelmont Stakes <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/belmont-stakes>.

Mubtaahij

Trainer: Mike de Kock
Post: No1
Jockey: Irad Ortiz, Jr.

Twice well beaten in Newmarket maidens the back end of last year, Mubtaahij 
came alive on the dirt when sent to Dubai for the winter. His rapid ascent up 
the ladder culminated with a quite breathtaking display in the Group II UAE 
Derby on World Cup night. History was against Mubtaahij in the Kentucky Derby - 
previous runners from Dubai hadn’t fared so well in America’s most famous race, 
and so it proved again, when Mike de Kock’s son of Dubawi finished a 
never-threatening 8th at Churchill Downs, over nine lengths behind American 
Pharoah.

Mubtaahij wins the UAE Derby. 
Having skipped the Preakness, Mubtaahij’s batteries are recharged. And while 
the South African de Kock appears to stem from the Clive Brittain school of 
training – you can’t win if you’re not in – he has proved himself a trainer of 
no meager skill on the international stage. Still, it takes some imagination to 
believe that Mubtaahij can make up that deficit between him and American 
Pharoah in the Belmont.

Tale of Verve

Trainer: Dallas Stewart
Post: No2
Jockey: Gary Stevens

Having only broken his maiden in April – on his sixth attempt, no less – Tale 
of Verve made swift amends with a good second in the Preakness Stakes, 
finishing seven lengths behind American Pharoah. It was a performance that 
probably flatters, considering how American Pharoah’s main competitors that 
day, Firing Line and Dortmund, both ran dismally, while the rest of the 
eight-horse field didn’t amount to much.

 Tale of Verve finished second in the Preakness, seven lengths behind American 
Pharoah. 
Then comes the question of whether Tale of Verve will stay the mile-and-a-half 
trip around Belmont. His sire was best at a mile, while the dam was never 
campaigned over further than a mile and one sixteenth. A win would prove 
fitting retribution for trainer Dallas Stewart, however. Since 2008, he’s 
saddled the runners up in four Triple Crown heats: two in the Derby (Golden 
Soul in 2013, and Commanding Curve last year) and two in the Preakness (Macho 
Again in 2008, and Tale of Verve this year).

Madefromlucky

Trainer: Todd Pletcher
Post: No3
Jockey: Javier Castellano

Like Tonalist, the Belmont Stakes victor of 12 months ago, Madefromlucky is 
joining the Triple Crown carnival a newbie, having sat out both the Derby and 
the Preakness. He didn’t look anything special in the spring after a couple of 
fair efforts in the Grade II Rebel Stakes and Grade I Arkansas Derby. But a 
gritty turn early last month in the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park – 
a race Tonalist similarly claimed last year – suggests that he might just have 
struck a rich vein of form.

 Madefromlucky won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont last month. 
Madefromlucky’s performance that day was doughty. He was one of the first 
under pressure, but seemed to relish every furlong put before him. What is 
more, he proved in the process that he likes the deep sandy trough of Belmont 
Park – a track that has something of a marmite effect on horses. A contender 
with live chances, Madefromlucky appears on the surface to hold the slimmer 
claims of the two Pletcher runners.

Frammento

Trainer: Nick Zito
Post: No4
Jockey: Mike Smith

If you were to look at Frammento as a single entity, there’s little to quicken 
the pulse. He got roundly stuffed in the Derby, finishing 11th behind American 
Pharoah. Though that run can hardly have left connections too bamboozled. His 
best form prior to the Derby was a moderate third in the Grade II Fountain of 
Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park in February (ahead of Frosted that day, 
admittedly).

Throw Frammento’s trainer, Nick Zito, into the mix, and he starts to look a 
whole lot more interesting. Zito is well versed in gate-crashing Triple Crown 
appreciation parties. He sent Birdstone out to scupper Smarty Jones’ Triple 
Crown bid in the Belmont of 2004. He then sent Da’ Tara out to scupper Big 
Brown’s Triple Crown bid in 2008. Frammento bears more than a passing 
resemblance to Da’ Tara, who arrived in New York an unfancied 38-1 shot with a 
resume short on accolades. But if there’s going to be another Triple Crown 
gate-crasher again this year, it’s unlikely to be Zito.

American Pharoah

Trainer: Bob Baffert
Post: No5
Jockey: Victor Espinoza

You couldn’t find two people more qualified for what lies ahead than Bob 
Baffert and Victor Espinoza. Baffert has come within spitting distance of a 
Triple Crown three times: with Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and War 
Emblem in 2002. Espinoza isn’t far behind Baffert in the Triple Crown hard-luck 
story Hall of Fame. He was aboard War Emblem 13 years ago, and California 
Chrome last year.

 American Pharoah charged down the stretch from the outside to win the Kentucky 
Derby. 
As for the horse, American Pharoah heads into the Belmont Stakes with an array 
of ticks next to his name. What was so encouraging about the Preakness – other 
than the way he decimated the field – is that it was an improved performance 
from that in the Derby, where he labored to victory. It suggests that American 
Pharoah not only has the constitution for hard races in quick succession – this 
we already knew from his two-year-old days, when he collected two Grade Is 
within a three-week window – but that he might actually thrive off of it.

He’s done nothing to suggest the mile-and-a-half trip won’t be within his 
compass range. Baffert has been effusive about American Pharoah’s overall 
condition in recent days. And word from the stable is that Baffert has been 
doing the rain dance in New York in order to replicate conditions at Pimlico.

The only question that remains is the big imponderable: How much have the 
Derby and Preakness taken out of him, and will he have enough left for the 
skirmish around Big Sandy? Don’t expect Espinoza to go any easier on American 
Pharaoh than he did in the Preakness.

Frosted

Trainer: Kiaran McLaughlin
Post: No6
Jockey: Joel Rosario

The horse most likely to prove the villain of the piece this year, Frosted 
holds stellar claims on the back of an eye-catching performance in the Kentucky 
Derby. Loitering around the rear of the field for the first portion of the 
race, Frosted then made relentless strides to swoop within a little over three 
lengths of American Pharoah at the wire.

The positives stack up. In typically shrewd fashion, trainer Kiaran McLaughlin 
sat the Preakness out with Frosted in order to bring a fresh horse to New York. 
Frosted went into the Derby having secured a fine victory in the Grade I Wood 
Memorial Stakes the race prior – a performance that stood out from earlier more 
moderate bits of form – strongly suggesting that he’s a horse on the upgrade. 
While his Derby run points towards him relishing every yard of the 
mile-and-a-half trip around Belmont. You can be sure jockey Joel Rosario won’t 
be leaving Frosted with nearly so much to do this time around.

The three lengths Frosted was beaten in the Derby is far from an 
insurmountable distance. But what if American Pharoah has improved again, or at 
the very least maintained the same level of form?

Keen Ice

Trainer: Dale Romans
Post: No7
Jockey: Kent Desormeaux

Keen Ice was thrashed in the Derby. Before that, Keen Ice was thrashed in the 
Grade II Louisiana Derby. Before that, he ran OK in the Grade II Risen Star 
Stakes. And before that, he was thrashed in the Grade II Holy Bull Stakes. By 
the law of averages, Keen Ice’s fate in the Belmont Stakes looks none too 
promising.

Materiality

Trainer: Todd Pletcher
Post: No8
Jockey: John Velazquez

I was pretty bullish about Materiality in the lead up to the Run for the 
Roses, only for him to perform as so many of Pletcher’s do in the Derby: 
disappointingly. Materiality finished sixth at Churchill Downs, never able to 
land a blow. Prior to that, he showed himself to be a colt of no inconsiderable 
talent when landing the Grade I Florida Derby.

 Materiality scored a third straight win at the Florida Derby on 28 March. 
Materiality looked a decent galloper that day, resolute with a streak of 
class. Pletcher gave Materiality the day off when the Preakness rolled around, 
so he has the freshness factor. Perhaps more importantly, Pletcher’s record in 
the Belmont bears much closer scrutiny than his record in the Derby: 2 wins 
(Rags to Riches in 2007, and Palace Malice in 2013) from 18 starters in the 
Belmont compared to his 1 win (Super Saver in 2010) from 43 starters in the 
Derby.

Win: American Pharoah – it’s time the Triple Crown hoodoo was put firmly to bed

Place: Madefromlucky – the similarities with Tonalist are too stark to dismiss
