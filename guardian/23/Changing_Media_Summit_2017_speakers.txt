work. Eleven years on and the7stars is now the UK’s largest independent media 
agency. Recently, the7stars was awarded ‘media agency of the year’ by both 
Campaign and Media Week and named inthe Sunday Times’ top 5 best small

Rory is vice chairman, an attractively vague job title which has allowed him 
to co-found Ogilvychange, a behavioural science practice.

Rory co-heads a team of psychology graduates who look for “butterfly effects” 
in consumer behaviour - these are the very small contextual changes which can 
have enormous effects on the decisions people make - for instance tripling the 
sales rate of a call centre by adding just a few sentences to the script. Put 
another way, lots of agencies will talk about “bought, owned and earned” media: 
we also look for “invented media” and “discovered media”: seeking out those 
unexpected (and inexpensive) nudges that transform the way that people think 
and act.

Before founding Ogilvychange, Rory was a copywriter and creative director at 
Ogilvy for over 20 years, having joined as a graduate trainee in 1988. He has 
variously been President of the IPA, Chair of the Judges for the Direct Jury at 
Cannes, and has spoken at TED Global. He writes regular columns for the 
Spectator, Market Leader and Impact, and also occasional pieces for Wired.
