“Each contestant gives consent that they could be maimed, even killed,” reads 
an advert. “2000 cameras, 900 hectares and 30 lives. Everything is allowed. 
Fighting, alcohol, murder, rape, smoking, anything.”

Contestants will each sign a waiver acknowledging that they might be raped or 
killed but the rules also state that police are free to arrest anyone who 
commits a crime on the show. “You must understand that the police will come and 
take you away,” the rules state. “We are on the territory ofRussia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>, and obey the laws of the Russian 
Federation.”

Contestants will be placed in a landscape where bears and wolves are likely to 
be living. According to theSiberian Times

, knives will be allowed yet guns are forbidden. The show is the brainchild of 
entrepreneur Yevgeny Pyatkovsky who says he “will refuse any claim of 
participants even if they were to be killed or raped”.

There won’t be a crew but rather 2,000 cameras dotted around the area. Each 
contestant will also have their own personal recording device. Willing 
participants need to be 18 and “mentally sane” to compete.

“The show promises to be international,” Pyatkovsky said. “Five countries have 
already expressed the desire to broadcast it for their audiences.”

He claims that 60 people have already applied, including one American.
