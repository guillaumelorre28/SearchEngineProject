I have a lovely young -family and a house in a nice neighbourhood. My job is 
OK and well paid but I find it very stressful. My wife also has a very well 
paid job three days a week that she mainly does from home. I am 10 years older 
than her and happy to enjoy the life we have built, but she keeps taking on 
more and more responsibilities and obligations outside of work and doing more 
and more unnecessary housework. She wants more and more of the material 
trappings of life and seems to have lost the ability to relax and be thankful 
for what we have, which, materially, is everything I ever wanted. I just can’t 
keep up and she is wearing herself out. I know I love her and she still loves 
me but she resents me for being a slacker and I abhor her protestant work ethic 
and wanting to keep up with the Joneses. Every few months we have a massive row 
and every time it clears the air a little bit less. I’m worried as to where 
this is leading but I really don’t have the resources to keep up with the 
ever-increasing demands on my dwindling time, energy and earnings.
