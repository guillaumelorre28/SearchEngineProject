The winner: The Accountant

The weekend after Doctor Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/doctor-strange-review-benedict-cumberbatch-marvel-eyepoppingly-freaky-extravaganza>
, and two weeks beforeFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them>, the 
release calendar paused for breath. But, despite the lack of any blockbusters, 
four movies with individual commercial appeal arrived:The Accountant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/the-accountant-review-ben-affleck-superhero>
, starring Ben Affleck; bestseller adaptationA Street Cat Named Bob 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/a-street-cat-named-bob-review>; 
period romanceThe Light Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/the-light-between-oceans-review-michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander>
, with Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander; and Tom Ford’s starry awards

The Accountant’s Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick on the profession’s ‘sexy hitman 
makeover’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/26/the-accountant-ben-affleck-anna-kendrick-sexy-hitman-makeover-video-interview>
Of these, The Accountant delivered a solid £1.62m from 496 cinemas, including 
£115,000 in previews. Appropriate comparisons on Affleck’s CV are not obvious, 
but his own sophomore directing effortThe Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/23/the-town-review> might serve 
best. That 2010 heist thriller began with just over £1m from 321 venues – a 
similar result, if ticket price inflation is factored in.

All films faced the challenge of Bonfire night falling on a Saturday – usually 
the busiest day of the week for cinemas.

The Brit flick: A Street Cat Named Bob

A Street Cat Named Bob, adapted from James Bowen’s bestselling memoir, has 
begun with a decent £986,000 from 440 sites. That’s by far the biggest debut 
number for a film featuringLuke Treadaway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/16/luke-treadaway-interview-street-cat-named-bob-actor>
 in a lead role, although even his agent would probably concede that it’s the 
cat that is providing the film’s chief selling point. Treadaway plays Bowen, a 
former homeless heroin addict who turned his life around after meeting Bob, 
incorporating him into his work as a busker and Big Issue seller.

Still in the top spot, Doctor Strange took £3.45m at the weekend, boosting the 
12-day total to a sturdy £15.73m.Trolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/11/trolls-review-anna-kendrick-a-candy-coloured-return-for-the-famed-ugly-lovable-creatures>

‘It really got to me’: Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander on The Light 
Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/27/michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander-light-between-oceans-video-interview>
Two films this week effectively straddled the indie-mainstream space. Derek 
Cianfrance’sThe Light Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/the-light-between-oceans-review-michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander>
 stole a march on its competitor by hitting cinemas on Tuesday, racking up 
three days of previews before facing competition fromNocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-amy-adams-jake-gyllenhaal>
. Distributor eOne’s strategy was the wise course: the adaptation of ML 
Stedman’s novel achieved a handy £280,000 before Nocturnal Animals arrived and 
boosted the film to a six-day debut of £733,000 from 438 cinemas.

A cast led by Amy Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/05/amy-adams-if-cant-figure-out-cant-work-any-more>
 andJake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/24/jake-gyllenhaal-interview-pushing-myself-is-part-of-my-life-film-demolition>
 helped powerTom Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/tom-ford-suit-set-film-nocturnal-animals-director>
’s film to an impressive £755,000 from 242 venues, including modest previews of 
£54,000. Strip out the previews, and Nocturnal Animals achieved a site average 
of £2,899, which compares well with £1,034 for The Light Between Oceans.

Tom Ford on Nocturnal Animals: ‘I’m conflicted about what I do’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/02/tom-ford-amy-adams-aaron-taylor-johnson-nocturnal-animals-video-interview>
Ford’s previous feature, A Single Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review>, began in 
February 2010 with £502,000 from 79 cinemas, on its way to £3.24m. Universal 
has pushed Nocturnal Animals significantly wider, and should reach a bigger 
eventual total.

As for Cianfrance, his previous film, The Place Beyond the Pines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/11/place-beyond-the-pines-review>, 
began in April 2013 with £671,000 from 114 sites, ending up with £3.43m. That 
final total is likely to elude him this time around.

I, Daniel Blake cracks £2m

Ken Loach <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach>’s I, Daniel Blake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-daniel-blake-review-ken-loach-film-benefits-system>
 performed solidly in its third week of release. The campaigning drama expanded 
from 211 to 273 cinemas, and achieved some great results at many of its new 
venues at the weekend, including Edinburgh Filmhouse, Birmingham MAC and Hebden 
Bridge Picture House.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/i-daniel-blake-trailer-ken-loach-palme-dor-winner-video>
The £2.07m total so far pushes it past the lifetime of The Angels’ Share 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/31/the-angels-share-review> 
(£1.98m), thus becoming Loach’s second biggest hit at the UK and Ireland box 
office. It still has a fair way to go to catch 2006’sThe Wind That Shakes the 
Barley <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/23/3>, which made a 
lifetime £3.91m.

While I, Daniel Blake remains buoyant, Andrea Arnold 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrea-arnold>’s American Honey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold>
 – which competed with Loach’s film forthe Palme d’Or at Cannes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake>
 in May and was released in the UK one week before it – continues to plummet. 
Arnold’s first US-set film, which benefits fromShia LaBeouf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf> in the cast, has grossed 
£442,000 so far, and looks certain to fall short of the director’s earlierFish 
Tank <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/fish-tank-review> (£599,000) 
andWuthering Heights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review> 
(£612,000). The epic duration of American Honey – 2 hours, 43 minutes – could 
be a factor in the film’s commercial disappointment, especially since cinemas 
have struggled to offer two evening showtimes without the first one beginning 
inconveniently early and the second ending inconveniently late.

The future

Takings are 35% down on the previous frame, and also 31% down on the 
equivalent weekend in 2015, whenSpectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden>
 remained strong in its second week of play. While cinema bookers have their 
hopes pinned on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, arriving November 18, 
there’s one more frame to get through before that expected cash bonanza. This 
Thursday sees the release of alien-invasion dramaArrival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/arrival-review-amy-adams-denis-villeneuve-alien-contact>
, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. The following day it’s joined by
American Pastoral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/american-pastoral-review-ewan-mcgregor-no-match-for-philip-roth>
, debut director Ewan McGregor’s adaptation of the Philip Roth novel, starring 
himself, Jennifer Connelly and Dakota Fanning. Alternatives include London 
drama 100 Streets, featuring Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton in an ensemble cast.
