We welcome publication of the results 
<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2962227-1/abstract>
 of the Netherlands study on the impact of a restricted diet on young children 
with ADHD (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/04/adhd-diet-food-children-behaviour?INTCMP=SRCH>
, 5 February). The improvement in behaviour noted in up to 78% of the children 
in the study comes as no surprise as we have been promoting the Feingold 
elimination diet to families of ADHD children in this country for over 30 years 
with similar success. During this time we have helped hundreds of thousands of 
children and their families find successful outcomes. We gave evidence to the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence <http://www.nice.org.uk/> 
for its most recent ADHD guideline, including the recommendation that parents 
use the food and behaviour diary on our website, although Nice favoured a 
mainly pharmaceutical approach. We hope that as a result of this study the 
elimination diet will be recognised as a valuable first step in treating ADHD, 
with drug use seen as a last resort.
