The former Chelsea manager Avram Grant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/avram-grant> has been identified as the 
man the Ghana Football Association want to take over as coach, although a deal 
has still yet to be agreed.

Grant, who also had spells in charge of Portsmouth and West Ham, is the 
technical director for Thai club Tero Sasana having resigned as the Partizan 
Belgrade manager in May 2012.

The Israeli was included on a five-man shortlist to take over as the Black 
Stars coach along with the former Italy midfielder Marco Tardelli, Spain’s Juan 
Ignacio Martínez and the German Bernd Schuster.

The GFA president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, said Grant is their preferred choice, 
although he has yet to finalise his contract with the 2010 World Cup 
quarter-finalists.

“The exec considered a report of the committee to appoint the new coach for 
Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>,” Nyantakyi said. “It’s a 
very good job reviewing the applicants and two were considered exceptionally 
good.

“Our preference is Avram Grant and Martínez is our second choice. We have not 
reached agreement with him yet but it is left with some small details which 
will be sorted out soon.”
