The future funding of racing was in crisis last night as a further drop in the 
sport's income was forecast.The Levy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/the-levy> Board, which raises funds through 
a tax on bookmakers, said yesterday that its income for 2007/08 was expected to 
be only £85.5m, down from £90m in 2006/07 and 16% below the peak of £102m three 
years ago.

The board's statement said estimated income would remain under review during 
"the current very uncertain climate".

Support for the levy among the major bookmakers has been undermined by the 
creation of the racecourse-backed broadcaster Turf TV, now competing with the 
bookmaker-owned SIS to provide pictures to betting shops. Bookmakers argue that 
their costs have been increased and therefore their levy payments should be 
reduced by a similar amount.

The Levy Board's contribution to prizemoney in 2008 will be £49.5m, down from 
£55m this year, as a result of the decline in its income, while other regular 
payments to racing will also be frozen or reduced.

"We make these cuts with a heavy heart," said chairman Rob Hughes, "but 
continuing pressure on over-the-counter British horseracing business, together 
with the uncertainties created by changes in the betting shop picture market 
and other factors make them inevitable."

The board also agreed in principle to a Jockey Club proposal to secure the 
future of the National Stud, which had been threatened with closure due to a 
shortage of funds.
