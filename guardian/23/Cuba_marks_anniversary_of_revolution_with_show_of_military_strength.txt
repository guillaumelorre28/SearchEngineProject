waved from the base of a monument to the independence hero José Martí.

“Cuba will not abandon a single one of its principles … not its independence 
and not its sovereignty,” she told the crowd.

The military parade and march takes place every five years on 2 December to 
mark armed forces day and commemorate the Granma landing, however it was 
postponed by a month due to thedeath of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-cuba-revolutionary-icon-dies>
 in November.

The event, announced last April, has taken on added significance since the US 
election.

The president-elect, Donald Trump, who will take office on 20 January, has 
threatened to abandon efforts by the Obama administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/28/trump-aides-threaten-hard-line-as-cuba-steps-into-the-unknown>
 to restore trade and diplomatic ties with Cuba if the country does not offer 
the US a “better deal”.

“We are braced for conflict with the USA, we always have been, but I hope 
Trump will instead follow the path of Obama towards normalisation,” said 
70-year-old Marcial Garcia, who does logistical work for the army, as he 
watched the parade.

The threat to US-Cuba relations could not come at a worse time for the 
Caribbean country, which slipped into recession last year for the first time 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago.

A tourism boom that brought 4 million visitors in 2016, in part sparked by 
political thaw and a relaxing of US travel restrictions, was not enough to 
overcome dwindling oil shipments from its ally Venezuela and less cash for 
Cuban doctors and other professionals working overseas.
