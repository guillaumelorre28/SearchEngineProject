“They were going to do a sequel on Amazon,” he said in a Nerdist 
<http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-sam-rockwell/> podcast. “We were ready to 
sign up, and [then] Alan Rickman passed away and Tim Allen wasn’t available – 
he has a show – and everybody’s schedule was all weird. It was going to shoot, 
like, right now. And how do you fill that void of Alan Rickman? That’s a hard 
void to fill.”

On its release in 1999, Galaxy Quest wasn’t a big hit, despite good reviews. 
The story of sci-fi TV actors who get accidentally involved in a real-life 
space adventure only made $90m worldwide. But its cult following would have 
made it attractive to Amazon.

When asked about the likeliness of a sequel in 2013, Rickman said 
<http://www.moviefone.com/2013/10/08/alan-rickman-cbgb/>: “They’d need a few 
zimmer frames”. His last on-screen performance was in acclaimed drone warfare 
thriller Eye in the Sky, out now in the US and released on 15 April in the UK. 
His voice will also be heard in the big-budget sequel Alice Through the Looking 
Glass, to be released in May. The 69-year-old actor died in January after 
suffering from pancreatic cancer.
