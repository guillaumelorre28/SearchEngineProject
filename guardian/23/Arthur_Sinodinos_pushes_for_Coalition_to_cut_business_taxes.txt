The Liberal powerbroker Arthur Sinodinos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/arthur-sinodinos> has made the case 
for cutting business taxes over personal income tax breaks, softening the 
ground for a potential budget announcement next month.

Last week the treasurer, Scott Morrison, strongly indicated that the 
government would not be able to deliver tax cuts in the upcoming budget.

“The best way to drive income tax cuts ultimately is off growth,” he said. “So 
our focus is very much on let’s drive growth.”

Sinodinos, the government’s cabinet secretary, on Sunday pressed for company 
tax breaks to be a live option.

“The fact of the matter is that it’s not like [1999] or 2000, where we had a 
major budget surplus which allowed us to turbocharge income tax cuts as we were 
making a major tax mix switch,” he told the ABC’s Insiders program. “Today it’s 
the hard graft of looking at tax concessions, whether they’re fit for purpose 
and whether the money from tax concessions can be better used in other ways.”

He said there were benefits to decreasing company tax, which currently sits at 
30%.

“Putting money into the hands of consumers obviously encourages more spending 
and disposable income and has good incentive effects,” he said. “But cutting 
company taxes also has good effects. It can encourage investment, it can 
encourage higher productivity, it can encourage more investment from overseas.

“There are lots of studies that show that that ultimately leads to higher GDP 
in the economy and higher wages for workers. At least 50% of the impact of 
cutting company taxes goes in higher wages for workers and higher employment.”

The education minister, Simon Birmingham, also left the door open to reduce 
the company tax rate by 1.5%.

“The government is considering a range of things in relation to tax reform and 
I’m not going to speculate [what is in the budget],” he told reporters.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said he will assess all future tax 
considerations against his objectives of fairness and creating jobs and growth.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> delivered 
a 1.5% tax break for businesses that have an annual turnover of $2m or less in 
its 2015 federal budget.

The Coalition had cut tax rates for businesses the previous year, but offset 
the cut with a 1.5% levy for big businesses aimed at paying for its paid 
parental leave scheme. Thelevy stayed in place

 even after the scheme was dumped.

Morrison has been forced to back away from the government’s commitment to 
addressing bracket creep,linking the now defunct plan to increase

 the goods and service tax with delivering personal tax breaks.

“Scott Morrison has been out there, talking big, but he will deliver 
absolutely nothing for Australian families,” the opposition spokeswoman on 
education, Kate Ellis, told reporters on Sunday.
