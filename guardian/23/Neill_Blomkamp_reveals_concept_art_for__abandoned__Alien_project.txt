The South African director Neill Blomkamp has revealed concept art for an Alien
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alien> sequel he has now apparently 
abandoned.


The Elysium director posted artwork on his Instagram feed 
<http://instagram.com/neillblomkamp/> on New Year’s Day, showing original star 
Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn, who played Hicks in Aliens, in mocked-up 
images from a project Blomkamp said he was no longer working on.

He accompanied a picture of a xenomorph character with a short post that read: 
“Was working on this. Don’t think I am anymore. Love it though.”

The seven images include a spacecraft, buildings and Weaver in a suit that 
resembles a xenomorph from the franchise. Blomkamp described the artwork as 
taking “a mental stroll into the worldRidley Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott> created”.
