The Harrison Speakeasy, Palermo

Word is out on this ultra-exclusive, prohibition-themed bar. People now know 
where it is (behind Nicky NY sushi restaurant); the problem is how to get in. 
The owners still try to keep the riff-raff out by making it password-only. To 
get in you need to befriend a member, or you could try having a sushi dinner 
and charming the waiter. But as there are no guarantees you’ll need a fallback 
plan. If you’re into the trend of disguised bars, try its sister venue, Frank’s 
(get the password via Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/FranksBar.ar/app_738565362871291> and enter through a 
telephone booth) orVictoria Brown <http://victoriabrownbar.com/> (and enter 
through a coffee shop).
• Open Tue-Wed 9pm-12.30am, Thurs 9pm-2am, Fri 9pm-4am, Sat 9pm-4am, Malabia

When wandering the upmarket Recoleta neighbourhood you may be confused to see 
a florist’s open at 2am. The store is a front. Hidden in the basement is an 
ultra-stylish bar, co-owned by the city’s leading cocktail expert, Renato 
“Tato” Giovannoni. Try his gin – Principe de los Apóstoles – which is enhanced 
by a touch ofyerba mate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate> (Argentina’s 
signature herbal tea).

Lo de Roberto, Almagro

Stepping into this small and scruffy tango bar, its walls crammed with framed 
photos of old crooners, feels like visiting a bygone era. Some time after 
11.30pm, Osvaldo Peredo, the eighty-something owner, will rise to his feet and 
sing evocative lyrics from the bar floor. Groups of friends huddle around 
tables, sharing chairs and spilling out on to the pavement between acts. It’s a 
very special place – and nowhere offers a more localporteño 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porte%C3%B1o> experience.
• Open Mon–Fri 6.30pm-4am, Sat 9pm-4am, Sun 10pm-4am, Bulnes 331, +54 11 6546

Café San Bernardo, Villa Crespo

This is a typical old neighbourhood bar by day, where you might find an 
elderly patron sippingcortado coffee with an eye on the television showing last 
night’s football highlights. But, by night, it springs to life with raucous 
chatter and the clattering of paddle bats. As dozens of table-tennis tables are 
rolled out, a laid-back, beer-swilling crowd rolls in. Grab a plastic pint 
glass and expect to be here for the long haul. There’s table football and pool, 
too.

Take the lift up to the 13th floor of the chic Hotel Pulitzer 
<http://www.hotelpulitzer.com.ar/en> to find one of the few bars in the city 
with a view. Thursday is “after office” night, meaning it draws a crowd from 
early evening (which is 9pm in these parts), and so is a good place to come if 
you want a taste of the city’s famous party atmosphere without sacrificing too 
much sleep. Buenos Aires isn’t stunning from above – more of a mishmash of flat 
concrete roofs – but it certainly looks special during a purple-hued sunset. 
Get here early to grab one of the stools facing out over the city.
• Open from October to early April. Sun-Wed, 5pm-midnight, Thurs-Sat 5pm–2am, 
Maipú, 907, +54 11 4316 0800,hotelpulitzer.com.ar

Doppelgänger, San Telmo 

San Telmo is the city’s oldest neighbourhood and known for its artsy feel. The 
bar scene is similarly down-to-earth, with favourites including 
backpacker-magnetLa Puerta Roja <http://lapuertaroja.com.ar/> and chilled-out 
La Del Barco <http://www.lasdelbarcobar.blogspot.co.uk/>. But if you want 
something more sophisticated, head off the main drag to find this retro, 
gimmick-free cocktail bar. Low-lit, with racing-green walls and the feel of a 
youthful gentleman’s club, it specialises in the classics: from negronis and 
martinis to Latin favourites, including caipirinhas and pisco sours.
• Open Tue–Fri 7pm until close, Sat 8pm till close, +54 11 4300 0201, Avenida

 Cerveceria Nacional, Palermo, Buenos Aires 
Across much of Buenos Aires the beer choice is limited to Quilmes, the local 
watery lager, or Heineken. It’s a shame, considering there’s a thriving 
microbrewery scene. Fortunately, this new joint has come along to showcase the 
best of them … 100 varieties from 30 artisan brands. See also the mini chain of
Antares bar <http://www.cervezaantares.com/index.php>, which does a fun tasting 
selection of its own beers in mini glasses.

Ring the bell of this old mansion and you’ll wonder if you have the right 
place: is this really a bar, or the houseshare of some particularly lucky art 
students? You might still be asking the same question when you leave, after a 
night spent wandering its beautiful rooms (all wood panelling and stained 
glass) and happening upon the open-mic performances, music in the piano bar, 
some impromptu theatre or a swing-dance session. Check the Facebook page to

Festival, Palermo

This buzzing newcomer may not have the makings of an all-time classic, but 
it’s surely a top pick for the southern hemisphere 2014/15 summer. There’s an 
industrial feel, with big, garage-style doors opening on to a long, central 
bar, lined with recycled iron shutters. The roof retracts to provide some 
respite from the humidity, and live music and DJs keep things lively into the 
early hours. And, if you need a reminder that things start late here, note the 
sign beside the racks of spirits: “Happy hour, 4am–5am.”
• Open Tue-Wed 8pm-2am, Thur 8pm-3am, Fri–Sat 9pm-5am, Gorriti 5741, +54 11

Ferona, Palermo

This place began life as a speakeasy in another part of Palermo and in keeping 
with its origins, it doesn’t give much away from the outside. There’s no sign 
on the front, and the downstairs windows are obscured with heavy black drapes. 
The giveaway is the queue that forms outside the front gate in the early hours. 
Arrive at 2am and you may not get in. The attraction is the house-party 
atmosphere. Slump on a downstairs sofa by the DJs decks, or head to the terrace 
to mix with a sociable crowd.
