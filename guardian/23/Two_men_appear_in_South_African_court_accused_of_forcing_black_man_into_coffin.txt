Two white South Africans accused of forcing a black man into a coffin and 
threatening to set him on fire have appeared before a judge, as demonstrators 
protested against racism outside the courthouse.

Members of the ruling African National Congress party and opposition parties 
gathered on Wednesday outside the court in Middelburg town, Mpumalanga 
province, where the case against the two farmers, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo 
Martins Jackson, was postponed until 25 January.

A video showing the alleged racially charged incident has circulated on social 
media, intensifying debate about South Africaâ€™s legacy of white minority rule, 
which ended in 1994.

The video shows a man cowering and moaning in a coffin as a tormentor pushes 
part of the lid over his head and upper body. A man is also heard threatening 
to pour petrol in the coffin. Another threat is to put a snake in the coffin.

The assaulted man, identified as Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa, had been accused 
of trespassing on farmland, according to South African media.

Protesters at the courthouse included members of the Economic Freedom 
Fighters, an opposition party that wants land held by the white minority to be 
redistributed.

South Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica> won praise for 
reconciliation efforts among racial groups when apartheid ended, but many black 
South Africans express frustration that they have failed to reap the economic 
benefits they expected from democracy. The income of the average white 
household is six times that of a black household, according to 2011 census data.
