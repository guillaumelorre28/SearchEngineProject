After building a big third-quarter lead against the defending NBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> champions, the Milwaukee Bucks poured 
it on in the fourth as they stunned the Cavaliers 118-101 on Tuesday night

But perhaps the most remarkable passage of play came when the Bucks exploited 
JR Smith’s affable nature for an easy dunk in the second quarter. Right before 
an inbound play, Milwaukee’s Jason Terry stood up off the bench to say hello to 
Smith, sharing a handshake and hug along the baseline. Smith was supposed to be 
covering Tony Snell, but with Smith mingling, Snell cut to the basket, received 
the inbound pass and dunked with nobody around.

J.R. Smith is a national treasure. Dude stops to talk to Jason Terry and 
allows the easy dunk...https://t.co/u07jVGJvIE <https://t.co/u07jVGJvIE>

Terry said it wasn’t planned and he didn’t realize play had restarted, and 
Smith at first said he just wasn’t paying attention. When asked again, he said, 
“I didn’t even know I was in the game. My bad.”. The interview was made more 
memorable by the fact thatSmith was dressed in a ski-mask

“It’s my alter ego,” Smith said. “It’s a gift from Ohio State, so I figure why 
not?” Smith had attended the Ohio State-Michigan game last weekend.

The Cleveland Cavaliers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-cavaliers>
 pulled their starters, including LeBron James, midway through the final 
period, but the young Bucks still didn’t let up.

“We didn’t let them off the hook. We were attacking,” said Giannis 
Antetokounmpo, who tied a career high with 34 points. “They are the champs, but 
this is a great win.”

Bucks coach Jason Kidd had high praise for Antetokounmpo, who was often 
matched up against James. “He’s getting better with hard work,” Kidd said. “He 
was going against the best player in the world.”

Antetokounmpo added 12 rebounds and five assists while Milwaukee ended 
Cleveland’s four-game winning streak. Jabari Parker had 18 points and Michael 
Beasley had 17 off the bench for the Bucks.

“It was a matter of us trusting each other,” Kidd said. “For a young team, 
sometimes it takes time. You want to put it in the microwave and instantly get 
it right away, but if you’re patient enough for the process and the journey, it 
will come.”

James had 22 points for the Cavaliers, who fell to 13-3. Kyrie Irving added 20 
points. “You can’t simulate how long they are in the passing lanes,” James 
said. “But four of my seven [turnovers] were unforced and that’s careless.”

The Bucks scored a season-high 68 points in the paint. “They played harder 
than we did,” Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said.

The Bucks outscored Cleveland by 14 points in the third quarter and led by 22 
in the fourth. Cleveland rode hot early shooting to a 14-point first quarter 
lead, but Milwaukee closed on a 10-0 run and trailed by only two at the end of 
the period.

Antetokounmpo and Beasley sparked Milwaukee in the second quarter as the Bucks 
built an advantage of eight points before leading 58-54 at the half.
