90 min: The Ecuadorian bench did not like that call and made their displeasure 
known by throwing bottles onto the field. That prompts the referee to send off

onrushing Ecuadorian player. These last few minutes and stoppage time could be

GOAL! USA 2-0 Ecuador (Zardes, 65 min)

Moments after Pardes is shown yellow for a dangerous play it’s Bobby Wood – 
once again! – who keys the US attack by running onto a through ball and finds 
Besler, who sends it into Dempsey. Then Dempsey crosses it toward the far post 
where it’s tapped into an empty net by Zardes. The US have doubled their 
pleasure and are roughly a half hour from the semi-finals!
FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) 
Gyasi Zardes, off the feed from Clint Dempsey, gives the #USMNT 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash> some breathing room. #USAvECU

Just when it seemed that Jermaine Jones had maybe matured a teensy little bit 
in Brazil, where he was admittedly stupendous for us, he goes and gets himself 
sent off. He will always be a red card waiting to happen.

Le sigh.

51 min: Interesting series here as Jones and Antonio Valencia get tangled up 
near the touchline. It appears the Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan is headed to 
send off Valencia with a second yellow. Indeed, Valencia is sent off, but so is 
Jermaine Jones on a straight red! Replay confirms Jones put a fist in Arroyo’s 
face and appeared to swing a little bit. Jones will be out for the semi-finals 
ifUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> advance. For now, 
it’s 10 v 10 in Seattle.

48 min: A clumsy foul by Jermaine Jones gives Ecuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> a free kick from a dangerous 
area near the corner flag. It’s sent short to Enner Valencia, who heads it into 
the six-yard box just out of range of Antonio Valencia (no relation).

38 min: Antonio Valencia shown yellow for a high challenge on Brooks, who’s 
absorbed heaps of punishment tonight.
Ives Galarcep (@SoccerByIves) 
Don't want to say Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> is 
targeting Brooks, but kinda feels like they're targeting Brooks. He's picked up 
where he left off vs. Paraguay

27 min: Dempsey nearly scores his second in five minutes! Ecuador’s defenders 
ceding way too much space in the area, allowing the veteran midfielder to 
uncork a powerful shot that Dominguez parries away.

GOAL! USA 1-0 Ecuador (Dempsey, 22 min)

Bobby Wood runs onto a through ball and passes to Jermaine Jones, who lofts a 
cross to Dempsey that Dempsey heads into the back of the net. That’s three 
goals in as many games for Deuce, who moves into a tie for the lead in the 
Golden Boot race. A dream start for the hosts.

17 min: A moment of danger there for Ecuador! Dempsey slots a pass from the

throughout the first quarter hour, but the youngster can’t get enough foot on

Not much longer now. If you’re not sufficiently excited for tonight’s match, 
why not let the dulcet baritone of Kobe Bryant take you over the top? The 
retired NBA star narrated this hype video for Fox Sports 1, which just aired 
before cutting away to the players in the tunnel.

Kickoff is roughly 20 minutes away. Here’s a few newsy notes ahead of 
tonight’s meeting:

 * The win against Paraguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/clint-dempsey-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 was the USA’s first against a Conmebol side in Copa América since theirfamous 
win over Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/copa-america-usa-argentina-1995>
 in 1995. 
 * This makrs the USA’s first trip to the Copa América knockout stage since 
1995, when they reached the third-place match after beating Mexico on penalties 
in the quarters and losing 1-0 to Brazil in the semis. 
 * USA goalkeeper Brad Guzan is currently at 227 minutes of play without 
conceding as the Yanks took clean sheets in their last two matches. 
 * John Brooks set a Copa América record for clearances (15) against Paraguay 
and was named man of the match. Aaron Timmswrote about the Hertha Berlin center 
back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/12/john-brooks-brad-guzan-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 this week. 
 * The Paraguay match marked Clint Dempsey’s 127th cap for the USA, moving him 
level with Marcelo Balboa for fourth-most in team history. 
 * Ecuador has yet to lose a match in this tournament. They drew 0-0 with 
Brazil and 2-2 with Peru in their opening two clashes before rolling past Haiti 
to finish second in the group. 
 * Keeper Esteban Dreer was named man of the match against Brazil. The two 
goals conceded against Peru occurred in the first 15 minutes of the match – 
otherwise he’s kept a clean sheet. 
 * This is Ecuador’s first trip to the Copa América quarters since 1997 and 
only their third ever. They won 3-0 over Paraguay in 1993 and bowed on 
penalties to Mexico in 1997 after a scoreless draw. 
 * Ecuador has conceded the most goals of any team in Copa América history 
(309) and also have the most appearances in the tournament (26) without a win. 
They’ve yet to finish better than fourth, which happened in both 1959 and 1993.

Johnson to the right side. Michael Orozco, who was broadly speculated as 
Yedlin’s replacement, will start on the bench.

Dempsey, Wood

Substitutes: Birnbaum, Nagbe, Howard, Orozco, Beckerman, Kitchen, Pulisic,

 on alate Darlington Nagbe winner <https://streamable.com/p7bi> in Dallas only 
weeks ago.

Tonight’s meeting at Seattle’s CenturyLink Field is a rematch of a Copa América
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> 1993 clash which saw 
Ecuador win 2-0 at Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa in Quito.
 Ecuador saw off the United States at Copa América 1993 
Now the shoe is on the other foot as USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> are hosts. Can Jürgen 
Klinsmann’s men reverse that result and book a place in the semi-finals, where 
the winner of Saturday’s match between Argentina and Venezuela will await?

10.20pm BST 22:20  <> 

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s a look at Steve Brenner’s 
preview of tonight’s match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/16/usa-ecuador-copa-america-quarter-final-soccer>
 from Seattle.

This time no unhelpful outbursts are needed. Just hours before the previous 
make or break encounter for Jürgen Klinsmann, the Copa América Centenario group 
match with Costa Rica, which followedthe dispiriting opening defeat to Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/04/usa-beaten-colombia-copa-america-jurgen-klinsmann>
, the head of US Soccer Sunil Gulati saw it fit toheap more pressure on the 
German’s shoulders 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2016/06/07/sunil-gulati-addresses-klinsmann-trump-clinton-world-cup-bid-copa-america/?postshare=2171465337293315&tid=ss_tw>
.

More wins was the order from on high. No more chances could slip away. Just 
what you need four hours before kick-off. The response, however, was rapid and 
on point. Two wins –4-0 against Costa Rica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/07/copa-america-usa-costa-rica-match-report>
 and1-0 against Paraguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/clint-dempsey-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 – quickly followed, Klinsmann was able to wallow in the afterglow, and now all 
roads lead to Seattle and a chance to reach the semi-finals of the Copa.

An unchanged line-up for the first three games saw the German, for once, keep 
his tactical nerve and hit the jackpot.To paraphrase Sir Alex Ferguson 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfDA4pADaWo>: international soccer? Bloody 
hell.

“It has been a real team effort and the atmosphere from the playing staff to 
the coaches has been excellent,” goalkeeper Brad Guzan told the Guardian on 
Wednesday. “We cannot control what happens on the outside and will let others 
judge on how we are doing.”

But they can control how they play on Thursday night. If they beat Ecuador, 
Klinsmann will have set up a tantalising semi-final with Argentina in Houston 
next Tuesday. Ecuador, whose Premier League triumvirate of Antonio Valencia, 
Enner Valencia and Jefferson Monterowill pose a multitude of questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/15/ecuador-usa-copa-america-seattle>
 – especially with DeAndre Yedlin suspended following his red card against 
Paraguay – are an improved team, in form and riding on the crest of a wave.

And so the USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> move on 
to the semi-finals (even if Bedoya, Jones and Wood do not). Thanks as always 
for following along with us and be sure to check out Steve Brenner’s full match 
report from Seattle’s CenturyLink Field.

USA beat Ecuador in battle of Seattle to reach Copa América semi-final

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/usa-ecuador-copa-america-2016-game-report-soccer> 
This is only the USA’s fourth ever win in the knockout stage of a major 
tournament.The previous three: the semi-final win over Spain in the 2009 
Confederations Cup, the round of 16 triumph over Mexico at the 2002 World Cup 
and their victory on penalties over Mexico in the 1995Copa América 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america>.
 
Clint Dempsey has been named man of the match. Not only did he score for the 
third time in three games, but the veteran midfielder has been involved in 
every USA goal at this year’sCopa América 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> except one.
 
There it is! The United States are through to the semi-finals of Copa América 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> after holding on for a 2-1 
win over Ecuador. The match will take place on Tuesday in Houston against the 
winner of Saturday’s quarter-final between Argentina and Venezuela.
 
90 min+4: As Klinsmann tries to make a sub, the corner is sent into the area 
where it caroms around for an agonizing period before anEcuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> player sends it wide of the 
target.
 
90 min+3: Yet another attack by Ecuador busted up by Brooks, who clears the 
ball past the halfway line. Moments laterEcuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> win a corner.
 
90 min+1: Oh dear. Brooks nearly deflects a cross in for an own goal, forcing 
Guzan to make a save. Still 2-1!
 
90 min: The Ecuadorian bench did not like that call and made their displeasure 
known by throwing bottles onto the field. That prompts the referee to send off 
manager Gustavo Quinteros. Whoops. There will be four minutes of stoppage time.

<https://twitter.com/UnivisionSports/status/743646028675461120>  
89 min: Arroyo surges down the right flank and beats his man, but reverses 
tack and is briefly dispossessed and fouls Zardes while trying to recover.
 
88 min: Another note from Scott Bassett, via email:

I’ve switched from beer to whisky. This is too much.

#PrayForScott
 
86 min: Stressful moment for the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> as an errant back pass 
pulls Guzan well off his line and he’s forced to lunge for it in the face of an 
onrushing Ecuadorian player. These last few minutes and stoppage time could be 
a white-knuckler.
 
84 min: Paredes comes out for Jamie Ayovi, Ecuador’s final sub. Meanwhile, 
Guzan is show yellow for time-wasting.
 
83 min: (As Ecuador batter away, it’s worth remembering that under Copa América
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> rules, the teams will go 
straight to penalties if tied after 90 minutes without playing a half hour of 
extra time.)
 
81 min: A fracas near the touchline – apparently over a throw-in? – is broken 
up without a booking. Moments later an exhausted-looking Bedoya comes off for 
Graham Zusi.
 
79 min: Moments after Beckerman replaces Dempsey for the USA’s first 
substitution of the night,Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador>
 continue to apply heavy pressure on the USA back four. Walter Ayovi puts a 
shot on goal but it’s off target.
 
76 min: Enner Valencia strolls into the area completely unmarked and sends a 
header inches over the bar. How did he not score! A profoundly bad lapse of 
focus forUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam>, who are 
lucky it’s not 2-2.

<https://twitter.com/UnivisionSports/status/743642529694834688>  
Not over yet! Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> score off 
a set piece when a free kick is sent to the top of the area, where Arroyo thuds 
a low-drifting shot that beats Guzan to his right. The American keeper’s 
scoreless streak ends at 301 minutes.
 Ecuador strike back in the 74th minute  
73 min: Bedoya shown yellow for a foul and now he’ll too miss the semi-final 
if theUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> close this out.
 
72 min: Ramirez is on for Gurezo, Ecuador’s second substitution.
 
71 min: Fabian Johnson cross is deflected out for a USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> corner, but it’s easily 
cleared.
 
Moments after Pardes is shown yellow for a dangerous play it’s Bobby Wood – 
once again! – who keys the US attack by running onto a through ball and finds 
Besler, who sends it into Dempsey. Then Dempsey crosses it toward the far post 
where it’s tapped into an empty net by Zardes. The US have doubled their 
pleasure and are roughly a half hour from the semi-finals!

62 min: Gaibor coming on for an injured Noboa, the first switch of the match 
for either side.
 
61 min: Arroyo has a go on goal from the top of the area but it sails over the 
crossbar. A dangerous time for the United States, who are appearing to tire. A 
sub coming now forEcuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador>.
 
58 min: Daniel Stauss checks in, via email:

Just when it seemed that Jermaine Jones had maybe matured a teensy little bit 
in Brazil, where he was admittedly stupendous for us, he goes and gets himself 
sent off. He will always be a red card waiting to happen.

Le sigh.
 
56 min: Here’s another look at the fist to the face that earned Jones an early 
dismissal.

<https://twitter.com/UnivisionSports/status/743637538477211650>  
53 min: Now Wood is shown yellow for a foul. He stays on, but he’ll also miss 
the semi-final if theUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
win tonight.
 
51 min: Interesting series here as Jones and Antonio Valencia get tangled up 
near the touchline. It appears the Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan is headed to 
send off Valencia with a second yellow. Indeed, Valencia is sent off, but so is 
Jermaine Jones on a straight red! Replay confirms Jones put a fist in Arroyo’s 
face and appeared to swing a little bit. Jones will be out for the semi-finals 
ifUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> advance. For now, 
it’s 10 v 10 in Seattle.

<https://twitter.com/tdn_twit/status/743637344750731264>  
48 min: A clumsy foul by Jermaine Jones gives Ecuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> a free kick from a dangerous 
area near the corner flag. It’s sent short to Enner Valencia, who heads it into 
the six-yard box just out of range of Antonio Valencia (no relation).
 
46 min: And we’re off in the second half with no changes for either side. Said 
Jürgen Klinsmann to Fox Sports at half-time: “We have been fantastic. We 
haven’t given them anything. These next 20 minutes are crucial for us.”
 
Dempsey’s 52nd international goal is the difference as a well drilled and 
opportunisticUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> head 
into the break with a deserved 1-0 lead. Plenty more to come from Seattle.
 
45 min: No sooner does Kevin Reichelt check in, via Twitter ...

@BryanAGraham <https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham> Tthe work rate of the #USMNT 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash> back line, and the tracking back

<https://twitter.com/KReicheltDC/status/743629487116427264> 
... then a clumsy giveaway by Bradley leads to a breakway by Arroyo, whose 
tightly angled shot from point-blank range is turned away by Guzan.
 
44 min: Another attack by USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> with Bradley finding 
Bedoya in acres of space on the left side of the area as the crowd swells, but 
a perfectly timed tackle by Arturo Mina breaks it up.
 
42 min: USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> on the 
attack, Dempsey leading the charge up the left side. He slots a pass to Bedoya, 
but Bedoya’s left-footed shot – not his preferred foot – is struck with little 
pace and easily wrangled by Dominguez.
 
39 min: A Teddy Roosevelt sighting among the American Outlaws. Always a 
crowd-pleaser.

38 min: Antonio Valencia shown yellow for a high challenge on Brooks, who’s 
absorbed heaps of punishment tonight.
Ives Galarcep (@SoccerByIves) 
Don't want to say Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> is 
targeting Brooks, but kinda feels like they're targeting Brooks. He's picked up 
where he left off vs. Paraguay

<https://twitter.com/SoccerByIves/status/743627786162577412>  
37 min: The corner is easily cleared, but the ball falls to Bradley near the 
halfway line. Wood has dogged theEcuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> back line all day. A goal seems 
inevitable at the current rate.
 
36 min: Bobby Wood again gets behind the Ecuador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> back far. He’s tackled before he 
can get a shot off, but wins a corner.
 
35 min: Brooks appears to be contending with a right elbow issue. What a loss 
that would be. Staying on for now.
 
32 min: Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador> work it down to 
the final third and keep possession for a series of passes, but can’t crack the 
USA back line and are dispossessed.
 
30 min: John Brooks with yet another clearance to break up a clear chance for 
Arroyo. The 23-year-old is winning everything. A massive destructive presence 
for the United States, from the Paraguay game since in particular.
 
27 min: Dempsey nearly scores his second in five minutes! Ecuador’s defenders 
ceding way too much space in the area, allowing the veteran midfielder to 
uncork a powerful shot that Dominguez parries away.
 
Bobby Wood runs onto a through ball and passes to Jermaine Jones, who lofts a 
cross to Dempsey that Dempsey heads into the back of the net. That’s three 
goals in as many games for Deuce, who moves into a tie for the lead in the 
Golden Boot race. A dream start for the hosts.

18 min: An email from Venki Murthy, who writes:

Who’s the more mediocre corner taker in big games – Wayne Rooney or Michael 
Bradley?

Savage.
 
17 min: A moment of danger there for Ecuador! Dempsey slots a pass from the 
midfield through to Bobby Wood, who’s caused Ecuador’s back line fits 
throughout the first quarter hour, but the youngster can’t get enough foot on 
it to negotiate it on target.
 
14 min: Wood wins another corner for the United States. It’s taken by Bradley 
but Cameron heads it wide of the target.
 
13 min: For all the hand-wringing about the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> defense with Yedlin out, 
it’s been quite a solid showing so far. Behold the benefits of continuity with 
Bradley, Cameron and Brooks playing back there so consistently.
 
10 min: Fielding a quick email from Scott Bassett, who writes:

Looking over their team sheet, it seems there are two brothers (at least going 
by their last names). Are Jaime Javier Ayoví Corozo and Walter Orlando Ayoví 
Corozo actually brothers or is it just a wacky coincidence?

They’re cousins.
 
8 min: Enner Valencia spending an unnerving amount of time in the area with 
the ball, but a gaggle of US defenders close in and he’s dispossessed. And just 
like that anotherUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
counter-attack! But it’s broken up before they can pressure Ecuador’s back 
four. A fun, wide-open start.
 
6 min: Montero tests the left back Besler early and curls a shot just over the 
crossbar, but moments later Bobby Wood keys theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> counter-attack. Lots of 
back-and-forth action early on.

US Soccer also posted this video yesterday in solidarity with the fallen.
 
Not much longer now. If you’re not sufficiently excited for tonight’s match, 
why not let the dulcet baritone of Kobe Bryant take you over the top? The 
retired NBA star narrated this hype video for Fox Sports 1, which just aired 
before cutting away to the players in the tunnel.

Kickoff is roughly 20 minutes away. Here’s a few newsy notes ahead of 
tonight’s meeting:

 * The win against Paraguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/clint-dempsey-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 was the USA’s first against a Conmebol side in Copa América since theirfamous 
win over Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/copa-america-usa-argentina-1995>
 in 1995. 
 * This makrs the USA’s first trip to the Copa América knockout stage since 
1995, when they reached the third-place match after beating Mexico on penalties 
in the quarters and losing 1-0 to Brazil in the semis. 
 * USA goalkeeper Brad Guzan is currently at 227 minutes of play without 
conceding as the Yanks took clean sheets in their last two matches. 
 * John Brooks set a Copa América record for clearances (15) against Paraguay 
and was named man of the match. Aaron Timmswrote about the Hertha Berlin center 
back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/12/john-brooks-brad-guzan-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 this week. 
 * The Paraguay match marked Clint Dempsey’s 127th cap for the USA, moving him 
level with Marcelo Balboa for fourth-most in team history. 
 * Ecuador has yet to lose a match in this tournament. They drew 0-0 with 
Brazil and 2-2 with Peru in their opening two clashes before rolling past Haiti 
to finish second in the group. 
 * Keeper Esteban Dreer was named man of the match against Brazil. The two 
goals conceded against Peru occurred in the first 15 minutes of the match – 
otherwise he’s kept a clean sheet. 
 * This is Ecuador’s first trip to the Copa América quarters since 1997 and 
only their third ever. They won 3-0 over Paraguay in 1993 and bowed on 
penalties to Mexico in 1997 after a scoreless draw. 
 * Ecuador has conceded the most goals of any team in Copa América history 
(309) and also have the most appearances in the tournament (26) without a win. 
They’ve yet to finish better than fourth, which happened in both 1959 and 1993.  
Here’s a look at today’s teams. With USA’s first-choice right back DeAndre 
Yedlin unavailable after picking up a red card in the final group-stage win 
over Paraguay, Klinsmann has inserted Matt Besler at left back and moved Fabian 
Johnson to the right side. Michael Orozco, who was broadly speculated as 
Yedlin’s replacement, will start on the bench.

USA

XI: Guzan; Johnson, Cameron, Brooks, Besler; Bradley, Jones, Bedoya; Zardes, 
Dempsey, Wood

Substitutes: Birnbaum, Nagbe, Howard, Orozco, Beckerman, Kitchen, Pulisic, 
Wondolowski, Zusi, Castillo, Horvath

Ecuador

Montero; E. Valencia, J. Ayovi

Substitutes: Ecuador: Banguera, Ramirez, Gaibor, Martinez, Arroyo, Dreer, 
Mena, Larrea, Cazares, Arbedola, Achilier, Bolanos

Hello and welcome to tonight’s first Copa América quarter-final between the 
United States and Ecuador.Los Amarillos enter with an advantage of five wins, 
three losses and three draws in the all-time series, but all three of USA’s 
victories have come in their last five meetings,including 1-0 result 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/25/usa-v-ecuador-international-friendly-live>
 on alate Darlington Nagbe winner <https://streamable.com/p7bi> in Dallas only 
weeks ago.

Tonight’s meeting at Seattle’s CenturyLink Field is a rematch of a Copa América
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-america> 1993 clash which saw 
Ecuador win 2-0 at Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa in Quito.
 Ecuador saw off the United States at Copa América 1993 
Now the shoe is on the other foot as USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> are hosts. Can Jürgen 
Klinsmann’s men reverse that result and book a place in the semi-finals, where 
the winner of Saturday’s match between Argentina and Venezuela will await?
 
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s a look at Steve Brenner’s 
preview of tonight’s match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/16/usa-ecuador-copa-america-quarter-final-soccer>
 from Seattle.

This time no unhelpful outbursts are needed. Just hours before the previous 
make or break encounter for Jürgen Klinsmann, the Copa América Centenario group 
match with Costa Rica, which followedthe dispiriting opening defeat to Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/04/usa-beaten-colombia-copa-america-jurgen-klinsmann>
, the head of US Soccer Sunil Gulati saw it fit toheap more pressure on the 
German’s shoulders 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2016/06/07/sunil-gulati-addresses-klinsmann-trump-clinton-world-cup-bid-copa-america/?postshare=2171465337293315&tid=ss_tw>
.

More wins was the order from on high. No more chances could slip away. Just 
what you need four hours before kick-off. The response, however, was rapid and 
on point. Two wins –4-0 against Costa Rica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/07/copa-america-usa-costa-rica-match-report>
 and1-0 against Paraguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/clint-dempsey-usa-copa-america-paraguay>
 – quickly followed, Klinsmann was able to wallow in the afterglow, and now all 
roads lead to Seattle and a chance to reach the semi-finals of the Copa.

An unchanged line-up for the first three games saw the German, for once, keep 
his tactical nerve and hit the jackpot.To paraphrase Sir Alex Ferguson 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfDA4pADaWo>: international soccer? Bloody 
hell.

“It has been a real team effort and the atmosphere from the playing staff to 
the coaches has been excellent,” goalkeeper Brad Guzan told the Guardian on 
Wednesday. “We cannot control what happens on the outside and will let others 
judge on how we are doing.”

But they can control how they play on Thursday night. If they beat Ecuador, 
Klinsmann will have set up a tantalising semi-final with Argentina in Houston 
next Tuesday. Ecuador, whose Premier League triumvirate of Antonio Valencia, 
Enner Valencia and Jefferson Monterowill pose a multitude of questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/15/ecuador-usa-copa-america-seattle>
 – especially with DeAndre Yedlin suspended following his red card against 
Paraguay – are an improved team, in form and riding on the crest of a wave.
