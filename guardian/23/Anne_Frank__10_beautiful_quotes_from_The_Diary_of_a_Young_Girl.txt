The theme for Holocaust Memorial Day 2015 
<http://hmd.org.uk/resources/theme-papers/hmd-2015-keep-memory-alive> is “keep 
the memory alive”, and today we want to remember Annelies Marie Frank, better 
known as Anne Frank, who started her diaryDiary of a Young Girl 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/diary-of-a-young-girl-11.html> at the age of 
just 13, while hiding from the German occupation of Amsterdam during the second 
world war. Anne wrote her diary in hiding in a secret annex of an old warehouse 
for the next two years. The diary stops abruptly in August 1944, when her 
family are betrayed and eventually sent to Auschwitz death camp. Only Anne’s 
father Otto survived and published his daughter’s Anne’s diary in 1947.


Even if you haven’t read the diary, you will probably have heard of Anne 
Frank, seen one of the many film adaptations of Diary of a Young Girl, or even 
visited theAnne Frank museum in Amsterdam <http://www.annefrank.org/>. 

But we still think that the best way to experience Diary of a Young Girl 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/diary-of-a-young-girl-11.html> is to read it 
yourself. This funny, heartbreaking, inspiring book will make it so easy for 
you to keep the memory of Anne Frank alive.

To give you a little taste, we have collected 10 of the greatest quotes from 
Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl that are bound to make you want sit down 
right away and (finally) read this wonderful diary from cover to cover, if you 
haven’t already.

Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not 
only because I’ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to 
me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of 
a thirteen-year old school girl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like 
writing.

How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to 
improve the world.

I know what I want, I have a goal, an opinion, I have a religion and love. Let 
me be myself and then I am satisfied. I know that I’m a woman, a woman with 
inward strength and plenty of courage.

We aren’t allowed to have any opinions. People can tell you to keep your mouth 
shut, but it doesn’t stop you having your own opinion. Even if people are still 
very young, they shouldn’t be prevented from saying what they think.

Women should be respected as well! Generally speaking, men are held in great 
esteem in all parts of the world, so why shouldn’t women have their share? 
Soldiers and war heroes are honored and commemorated, explorers are granted 
immortal fame, martyrs are revered, but how many people look upon women too as 
soldiers?

Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you 
don’t know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can 
accomplish! And what your potential is!

It’s difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise 
within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It’s a wonder I haven’t 
abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to 
them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly 
good at heart.

What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again.

I don’t think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains.

Whoever is happy will make others happy too.

“Who has made us Jews different from all other people? Who has allowed us to 
suffer so terribly up until now? It is God who has made us as we are, but it 
will be God, too, who will raise us up again. Who knows? It might even be our 
religion from which the world and all peoples learn good, and for that reason 
and only that reason do we suffer. We can never become just Netherlanders, or 
just English or representatives of any country for that matter. We will always 
remain Jews, but we want to, too.” – April 11, 1944
