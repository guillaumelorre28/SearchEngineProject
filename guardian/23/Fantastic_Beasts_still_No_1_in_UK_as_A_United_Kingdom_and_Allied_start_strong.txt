The winner: JK Rowling

With £30.14m in 10 days, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-review>
 has become the quickest film to reach £30m at the UK and Ireland box office 
sinceStar Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/20/star-wars-the-force-awakens-observer-review-mark-kermode>
 last December. The JK Rowling-scripted film grossed £8.89m at the weekend, a 
decline of 42% on the opening frame. For comparison,Batman v Superman: Dawn of 
Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review>
 andCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 – which are the other two films this year that came particularly fast out of 
the gate – fell respectively by 68% and 67% in their second sessions.Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
 was sturdier, with a 43% drop on its second weekend.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the tenth release this year to 
crack £30m – afterBridget Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 (£47.8m),The Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review> (£46.2m), 
Finding Dory <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/31/finding-dory-review> 
(£42.8m), Deadpool (£37.9m), Captain America: Civil War (£36.9m),Batman v 
Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/nov/07/ben-affleck-batman-dc-warner-bros>
 (£36.6m),The Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/26/secret-life-of-pets-review-visual-gags-and-silliness>
 (£35.9m),Suicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/07/suicide-squad-review-bad-film-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
 (£33.6m) andThe BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/the-bfg-observer-review-mark-rylance-steven-spielberg-roald-dahl>
 (£30.6m). In addition, 2015 release Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed 
£35.9m in calendar year 2016, so that would be an eleventh.

The question now is whether Fantastic Beasts will burn through its audience 
and fall short of the year’s biggest hits, or sustain nicely through until 
Christmas. Based on the performance of Harry Potter films as well as a 7.9/10 
user rating forFantastic Beasts at IMDb <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183660/>, 
you’d suspect the latter. Competition for the family end of the audience 
arrives on Friday with Disney Animation’sMoana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/07/moana-review-disney-polynesian-princess-movie>
, which opened in the US at the extended Thanksgiving weekend with a muscular 
$81m. Rogue One follows on 16 December.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story – video trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-video-trailer>
The runner-up: Brad Pitt

With a debut of £1.30m (plus £33,000 previews), Robert Zemeckis’s second world 
war spy romanceAllied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/21/allied-review-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-fail-to-find-blitz-spirit>
 grossed just 15% of the Fantastic Beasts number at the weekend, but that was 
still enough to land in second place, given weak competition from other titles 
in the marketplace (everything else earned less than £1m in ticket sales at the 
weekend).

Marion Cotillard on starring with Brad Pitt in Allied: ‘Chemistry creates 
itself’ – video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/25/marion-cotillard-on-starring-with-brad-pitt-in-allied-chemistry-creates-itself-video-interview>
This is the third film for Brad Pitt set during the second world war, following
Inglourious Basterds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/19/inglourious-basterds-review-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino>
 andFury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/26/fury-review-stirring-macho-tank-drama-brad-pitt>
. Neither are particularly apt comparisons for Allied, but for the record those 
two films opened respectively with £1.9m (plus £1.69m previews) and £2m (plus 
£698,000 in previews).

Pitt had a supporting role in The Big Short 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/the-big-short-review-crash-riveting-steve-carell-christian-bale>
 in January. His previous lead was in romantic dramaBy the Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/by-the-sea-review-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie>
, co-starring and directed by Angelina Jolie. That creative and commercial 
misfire grossed a dismal £46,000 in its entire UK theatrical run last December.

The indie battle: Paterson v A United Kingdom

Two new releases targeted the indie market: Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/24/paterson-review-adam-driver-jim-jarmusch>
 and Amma Asante’sA United Kingdom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/27/a-united-kingdom-review-love-story-amma-asante-david-oyelowo-rosamund-pike>
. The latter was positioned much broader, with a release by Pathe/Fox into 419 
cinemas, including a wide swath of upscale multiplex sites. Soda put Paterson 
into a more targeted 62 venues, mixing boutique chains (Picturehouse, Curzon, 
Everyman) and selected plex venues with key independents.

Watch the trailer for Paterson – video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU> 
Given its wider release, A United Kingdom unsurprisingly achieved the bigger 
box office: £619,000 (including £54,000 previews), compared to £170,000 
(including £42,000 previews) for Paterson. Stripping out previews, site 
averages are £1,345 and £2,103 respectively.

Director Asante has achieved her biggest ever opening gross. Her previous film 
Belle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/15/belle-review-costume-drama-teeth-slavery>
 began in June 2014 with £407,000 from 408 cinemas, including negligible 
previews of £4,000. That film went on to a UK lifetime total of £1.95m.

Jarmusch has enjoyed rather patchy commercial success at the UK box office. 
His previous fiction featureOnly Lovers Left Alive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/23/only-lovers-left-alive-review> 
began with £124,000 from 68 cinemas on its way to a lifetime of £315,000. 
Arguably, the earlier film, with a cast including Tom Hiddleston as a vampire 
rock star, appeared to be a more commercial prospect than Paterson, with Adam 
Driver as a New Jersey bus-driving poet, so Soda should be happy with the 
outcome. Jarmusch’s biggest hit in the UK remains 2005’sBroken Flowers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/oct/21/1>, with £1.94m. The director 
is also currently in cinemas with Iggy Pop documentaryGimme Danger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/gimme-danger-iggy-pop-stooges-documentary-review>
, which has reached £53,000 so far.

Mum’s List struggles to make an impact

The challenges of releasing what might best be described as a small mainstream 
film are confirmed once again with the release ofMum’s List 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/27/mums-list-rafe-spall-emilia-fox-review>
, starring Rafe Spall and Emilia Fox. The film is adapted from the memoir by St 
John (aka “Singe”) Greene, celebrating the legacy left by his wife Kate, who 
died of breast cancer in 2010. Not a natural fit for independent cinemas, the 
film recounts Singe and Kate’s early courtship, life raising two young sons, 
her battle with cancer, and how Singe coped as a widower and single parent, 
honouring the titular list of instructions, wishes and thoughts left by his 
wife. But to succeed in multiplexes, a film needs a highly visible – and likely 
expensive – marketing campaign. Case in point, the recentA Street Cat Named Bob 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/06/street-cat-named-bob-review-luke-treadaway>
, which Sony has pushed, via bus sides and television, to £3.91m so far.

Watch the trailer for Mum’s List – video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcrlU1r-7Es> 
Mum’s List has opened with a poor £25,600 from 110 sites, yielding a location 
average of £233. The film will probably find a happier home on DVD – it should 
be on sale just before Mother’s Day next year – and on television.

The highest climber: Your Name

Surging from 29th position to 15th in the box-office chart, Your Name 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/your-name-review-makoto-shinkai> 
saw grosses nearly quadruple from the previous session. The Japanese anime 
began in a rather low-key way, exclusively at 17 Showcase cinemas. Then it 
expanded for one night only last Thursday into more than 100 venues, before 
contracting again at the weekend to 23 sites. Weekend gross was a solid 
£66,000, yielding a location average of £2,990. Cumulative total to date is 
£204,000.

André Rieu breaks concert record

Encore showings of André Rieu: Christmas with André 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/jul/23/andre-rieu-cinema-music-record>
 played on Sunday, grossing a handy £304,000. That takes the total for the 
event to £1.53m, beating the previous record holder for a concert in cinemas, 
which was set earlier this year by the Dutch violinist’s summer Maastricht 
concert (£1.45m). More cinemas are set to encore the event before Christmas, 
and distributor CinemaLive is looking for a final tally around £1.6m.

Given the lack of major new releases, it’s no surprise to see the overall 
market contract – by 32%, in fact – from the previous session. However, box 
office is down just 1% on the equivalent weekend from 2015, whenThe Good

sales, reports distributor Phoenix.
