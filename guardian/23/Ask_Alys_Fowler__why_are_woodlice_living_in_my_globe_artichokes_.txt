Woodlice have taken up residence in my globe artichokes, leaving them hollow 
and dried out. I have grown them for many years and this is the first time I 
have had this problem – what I can do?
Woodlice feed on dead or decaying organic matter. They like damp conditions in 
which to hide by day, mostly coming out to feed at night. Woodlice are a good 
thing in the compost heap as they help to break things down. I would have 
thought damage to the plant has been caused by other pests, perhaps slugs or 
vine weevils, and the woodlice are picking over the leftovers.

Ask Alys Fowler: my mother can see only white flowers. What should I plant?

Nevertheless, remove dead or dying plant material around the plant. Top-dress 
the plants with well-rotted farmyard manure or shop-bought compost; whatever 
you use, make sure it’s well broken down as homemade compost may attract more 
woodlice. Keep checking no rotting material is around the plant and the 
woodlice should move off.

Woodlice have a number of predators: shrews, toads, centipedes, some spiders 
and ground beetles. Encourage them by making a refuge, a beetle bank or adding 
a pond.
