Only two British newspapers failed to feature a picture of Jo Cox on their 
front pages today, as theterrorist killer of the MP was jailed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-found-guilty-of-jo-cox-murder>
: the Financial Times and the Daily Mail.

The editorial judgment is unsurprising, as far as the Financial Times is 
concerned. The neo-Nazi loner Thomas Mair was found guilty of murdering Cox on 
the same day as the first autumn statement from the chancellor, Philip Hammond. 
And for a financial newspaper that considers itself more global than British, 
this meant the news led its front-page briefing column instead.

But for Britain’s biggest-selling mid-market tabloid, the Daily Mail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail>, not to refer to Cox and her 
killer until page 30 was not only surprising but a shock.

Nearly all other papers put a smiling picture of the Labour MP and mother of 
two young children on their front page on the day her killer received a full 
life sentence – even if they led their news coverage on the economy.

So what happened at the Mail? And what does it say about that paper’s view of 
– and impact on – the UK’s political life that the verdict on the first murder 
of a sitting MP for 26 years can be relegated so far inside its pages?

The story about Mair’s sentence came after a full 17 pages welcoming the 
verdict of an “upbeat chancellor” confounding those dastardly “remain 
doom-mongers”. In the pages that followed this autumn statement coverage came 
news reports about “laughing migrants”, photos of a bikini-clad model taking a 
shower and the headline news that Santa is not real. They also featured a 
full-page column asking why leftwing comics laugh at the Queen.

It is surely worth asking whether the threat from far-right extremist 
terrorists is taken seriously by the British press

When today’s Mail finally gets to the verdict on Mair, the main headline 
points out that he “wanted to kill his own mother”, while the secondary story 
asks: “Did neo-Nazi murder Jo over fear he’d lose council house he grew up in?”

Most newspapers (certainly not just the Guardian) cited the judge’s own 
verdict that Mair killed her to advance his violent white supremacist ideology 
rather than because he “suspected the MP might not have helped him” to fight 
the council’s bid to move him.

The introduction to the Mail piece – which states that Mair “may have murdered 
MPJo Cox <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-cox> because he feared losing 
his home of 40 years to an immigrant family” – prompted law professor James 
Chalmers to tweet “turns out there really is nothing the Daily Mail can’t blame 
on immigrants”.

The evidence of his fear of losing his council house comes from interviews 
with Mair’s neighbours and, largely, his stepfather’s half-sister. There is, 
however, no mention of how close the relationship was between a white 
supremacist and the family of his black stepfather.

There are of course several arguments that can be made by the Mail and its 
many fans about its placement of this particular story: newspapers make tricky 
editorial decisions every day; they wanted to feature this across two pages 
free of advertising; and, for the paper’s huge number of online readers, where 
the story sits in the paper won’t actually matter. (Although it’s worth noting 
thatMail Online again highlighted Mair’s mental health  
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3963728/Thomas-Mair-GUILTY-murdering-MP-Jo-Cox.html>
and thoughts of matricide rather than his extreme ideology.)

And yet the Mail’s carefully crafted and hugely successful print edition is 
read by almost more people than any other daily paper in Britain (and is fast 
approaching the most widely read of all, the Sun). It is surely worth asking 
whether the threat from far-right extremist terrorists is taken seriously by 
the British press, or at least its most politically powerful publication.

On the day Cox was killed the Mail’s front page focused on the tragic waste of 
a woman“brutally murdered by a loner with a history of mental illness”  
<http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/newspaper-front-pages-pay-tribute-jo-cox-mp/>
as did many others. This was a week before the EU referendum, and Mair’s shouts 
of “Britain first” and “This is for Britain” were probably considered 
incendiary.

Yet Mair’s trial and most notably the judge’s verdict suggested that there was 
far more to his crime than the evil act of a mentally ill man.

When Lee Rigby’s killers were found guilty of a terrorist act, they were not 
called simply mentally ill but ideologically motivated. When Ian Gow, the last 
sitting MP to be killed, died in 1990, the members of the Provisional IRA who 
did it were not called simply unhinged.

These are politically dangerous times. The EU referendum and the US election 
have shown that fears over immigration and the economy are real and divisive.

So it is even more important that the media, which prides itself on real, not 
fake news, does not hide the true story – however unpleasant or contrary to 
their own worldview it might be.
