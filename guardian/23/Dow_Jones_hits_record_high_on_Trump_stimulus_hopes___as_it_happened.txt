Closing post: Dow closes at record high

It’s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime 
high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump’s election 
victory.

After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big 
gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points.

It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a 
Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the 
Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from 
infrastructure sending).

But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or 
protectionist trade police would hurt them.

Bloomberg has a neat summary:

Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 
percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.’s 4.3 percent rally. 
Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter & Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent.

Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of 
higher inflation and extra US government borrowing.

The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Barack Obama have their 
first meeting since the election.

It’s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as 
the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious.

Our US politics <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics> liveblog has 
full details.

Here’s a flavour:


Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump 
could be a successful president.

“If he succeeds, the country succeeds,” Obama said.

Trump said he had “respect for the president” and said they talked about some 
wonderful things and some difficult things.

Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a 
“very fine man.”

And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow 
up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close.

I’m taking a break now, but we’ll be back with the Wall Street close...

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> says 
investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump’s plans:

There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic 
policies of the incoming Republican administration.

However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences 
if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal 
expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the 
economy.

After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on 
track to hit a record close.

Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the 
rally, on predictions that they’ll benefit from Trumponomics.

But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they’ll 
suffer under the next presidency

FTSE 100 dragged down by stronger pound

A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, 
triggering a late selloff in London.

Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as 
investors come to terms with Trump’s success.

A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the 
value of international companies who earn money abroad.

 * So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827.

 * The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, 
finished 0.4% higher though.

It’s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. 
Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks 
would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates)

Steeper yield curve is really helping US bank stocks.

Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America 
will need a lot more metal to implement Trump’s new infrastructure plan.

But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, 
some by over 5%.

The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, and isn’t 
prejudging him.

Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it’s “too early 
to speculate” about whether Trump would hurt the global economy.

Rice added:

“We need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we’ll be 
making an assessment at that time.”

Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate 
that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president.


Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by 
at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too.

Trump’s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large 
numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news 
for the tech sector.

He’s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was 
pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign.

JP Morgan: Don't judge Trump by the stock market
 Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images 
Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn’t crashed 
sinceDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> pulled off 
one of the most surprising election results of the age.

But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider 
consequences of America’s choice -- asthe protests in New York, Chicago, Boston 
etc overnight show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-us-election-2016-live-reactio>
.


Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the 
world watches him closely.

The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in 
key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to 
continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was 
on display in his election night acceptance speech.

No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about 
open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. 
But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does 
not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually 
working quite well – notably, the US Federal Reserve.

Flanders points out that Trump’s economic plans will have major implications 
for the global economy:

The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over 
globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher 
US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful 
combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. 
But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the 
meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for 
theUS economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> following this 
result - or for US interest rates.

And remember, Trump’s success or failure won’t be measured in stock prices or 
foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:

This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.

At the heart of Donald Trump’s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that 
works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by 
globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is 
the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be 
judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another 
matter.”

Analyst: Republican unity driving markets up
 Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images 
Let’s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the 
presidential election. And most analysts were wrong.

There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied 
since Trump won the presidential race, saysJim Cielinski of Columbia 
Threadneedle Investments.

 * Trump “the President” will not be the same thing as Trump “the candidate”. 
Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, 
and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his 
ability to define himself as a “winner” will require a different approach, and 
most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.

 * The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the 
hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but 
a “clean-sweep” soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance 
to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those 
odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, 
recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the 
wounds and push the agenda forward.

 * Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, 
and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to 
conclusions.

 * For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with 
it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or 
likeability of the man putting the ideas forward.

Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs 
gaining 2%.


They’re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch 
Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial 
crisis.

Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are 
boosted by Hillary Clinton’s defeat, as she’d promised to end price-gouging.

And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump’s 
promise to rebuild American infrastructure.Caterpillar is up 2%.

Dow Jones hits intraday record high

Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as 
the Trump bump reached New York.

Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to 
yesterday’s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if 
Republicans won the race for the White House.

The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709.

And the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too:

Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly 
fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog.

Indeed, there’s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the 
billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be:

Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free 
victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen’s position at the 
Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months.

FT: Beware Trumpflation!

Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and 
scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation!

The Financial Times has coined this term 
<https://www.ft.com/content/32d4aaea-a5a8-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1>, to explain 
the big selloff in bond pricestoday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/10/markets-rebound-investors-welcome-trump-plans-us-election-live?page=with:block-582476ece4b0eda0192fe38a#block-582476ece4b0eda0192fe38a>
.

The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new 
president drives up economic growth, inflation,and inflation expectations, with 
a debt-financed stimulus programme.

Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, says:

“Under a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that 
drives growth and markets are reflecting that.

“There was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr 
Trump’s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are 
rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is 
steepening.”

And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause 
a bond crash.

Bond yields surge amid inflation fears

Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now.

The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is 
falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt.

Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump’s economic policies will 
drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that 
debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America’s infrastructure.

As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it:

 Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump 
implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster 
profit growth consequently boosting inflation.

So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to 
hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation.

Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their 
national debts.

 * The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night.

 * The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06%

 * The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17%

Longer-dated debt is also weakening:

We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels 
in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their 
quantitative easing schemes.

So a return to normal levels wouldn’t be a disaster.

Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict 
losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently.

And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European 
markets are lower as this morning’s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out.

It’s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime 
high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump’s election 
victory.

After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big 
gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points.

It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a 
Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the 
Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from 
infrastructure sending).

But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or 
protectionist trade police would hurt them.

Bloomberg has a neat summary:

Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 
percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.’s 4.3 percent rally. 
Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter & Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent.

Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of 
higher inflation and extra US government borrowing.
 
The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Barack Obama have their 
first meeting since the election.

It’s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as 
the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious.

Here’s a flavour:


Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump 
could be a successful president.

“If he succeeds, the country succeeds,” Obama said.

Trump said he had “respect for the president” and said they talked about some 
wonderful things and some difficult things.

Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a 
“very fine man.”

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> says 
investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump’s plans:

There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic 
policies of the incoming Republican administration.

However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences 
if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal 
expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the 
economy.
 
After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on 
track to hit a record close.

Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the 
rally, on predictions that they’ll benefit from Trumponomics.

But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they’ll 
suffer under the next presidency

A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, 
triggering a late selloff in London.

Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as 
investors come to terms with Trump’s success.

A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the 
value of international companies who earn money abroad.

 * So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827.

 * The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, 
finished 0.4% higher though.

It’s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. 
Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks

The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with

Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it’s “too early

Rice added:

“We need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we’ll be 
making an assessment at that time.”

Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by 
at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too.

Trump’s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large 
numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news 
for the tech sector.

He’s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was 
pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign.

Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn’t crashed 
sinceDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> pulled off 
one of the most surprising election results of the age.

But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider 
consequences of America’s choice -- asthe protests in New York, Chicago, Boston 
etc overnight show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-us-election-2016-live-reactio>
.


Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the 
world watches him closely.

The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in 
key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to 
continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was 
on display in his election night acceptance speech.

No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about 
open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. 
But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does 
not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually 
working quite well – notably, the US Federal Reserve.

Flanders points out that Trump’s economic plans will have major implications 
for the global economy:

The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over 
globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher 
US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful 
combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. 
But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the 
meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for 
theUS economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> following this 
result - or for US interest rates.

And remember, Trump’s success or failure won’t be measured in stock prices or 
foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:

This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.

At the heart of Donald Trump’s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that 
works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by 
globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is 
the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be 
judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another 
matter.”

Let’s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the 
presidential election. And most analysts were wrong.

There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied 
since Trump won the presidential race, saysJim Cielinski of Columbia 
Threadneedle Investments.

 * Trump “the President” will not be the same thing as Trump “the candidate”. 
Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, 
and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his 
ability to define himself as a “winner” will require a different approach, and 
most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.

 * The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the 
hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but 
a “clean-sweep” soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance 
to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those 
odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, 
recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the 
wounds and push the agenda forward.

 * Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, 
and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to 
conclusions.

 * For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with 
it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or 
likeability of the man putting the ideas forward.
 
Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs 
gaining 2%.


They’re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch 
Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial 
crisis.

Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are 
boosted by Hillary Clinton’s defeat, as she’d promised to end price-gouging.

And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump’s 
promise to rebuild American infrastructure.Caterpillar is up 2%.

Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as 
the Trump bump reached New York.

Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to 
yesterday’s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if 
Republicans won the race for the White House.

The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709.

And the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too:

Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly 
fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog.

Indeed, there’s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the 
billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be:

Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free 
victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen’s position at the 
Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months.
 
Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and 
scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation!

The Financial Times has coined this term 
<https://www.ft.com/content/32d4aaea-a5a8-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1>, to explain 
the big selloff in bond pricestoday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/10/markets-rebound-investors-welcome-trump-plans-us-election-live?page=with:block-582476ece4b0eda0192fe38a#block-582476ece4b0eda0192fe38a>
.

The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new 
president drives up economic growth, inflation,and inflation expectations, with 
a debt-financed stimulus programme.

Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, says:

“Under a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that 
drives growth and markets are reflecting that.

“There was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr 
Trump’s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are 
rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is 
steepening.”

And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause 
a bond crash.

Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is 
entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth.

He’s been speaking on CNBC:

Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now.

The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is 
falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt.

Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump’s economic policies will 
drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that 
debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America’s infrastructure.

As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it:

 Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump 
implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster 
profit growth consequently boosting inflation.

So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to 
hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation.

Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their 
national debts.

 * The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night.

 * The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06%

 * The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17%

Longer-dated debt is also weakening:

We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels 
in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their 
quantitative easing schemes.

So a return to normal levels wouldn’t be a disaster.

Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict 
losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently.

And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European 
markets are lower as this morning’s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out.
