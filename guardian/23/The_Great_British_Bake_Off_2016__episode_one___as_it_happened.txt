So that’s it for Week 1! I’m exhausted. Seems like a good bunch of bakers this 
year, should be a fun series. I’ll be back next Wednesday for Biscuit Week, and 
don’t forget to put Saturday 3rd September in your diary for the Strictly 
Launch Night liveblog.


In the meantime I’m off to watch The Chronicles of Nadiya - you’ll find me on 
Twitter @heidistephens, so come and say hello if you’re passing. Have a great 
week! Hx

So who will win this week’s Star Baker, and who is going home? Star Baker 
is...JANE! And going home this week is...LEE. It’s the right decision, he 
didn’t have a great weekend. Bye Lee, your stay in the tent of dreams was 
fleeting, but that’s the way the Bake Off cookie crumbles.

Andrew’s cake looks stunning, and his genoise is perfect. Candice cries a bit 
more, I don’t think I’ve ever seen Paul’s Paddington stare deployed so often.

Benjamina’s white chocolate has a lovely shine, and her genoise is lovely. YAY 
BENJAMINA! Candice’s glaze is lovely on the top, but the sides are a bit 
lacking. The genoise is underbaked, however - Paul describes it as “awful”. She 
has a little cry.

Paul loves how Jane’s cake looks - less is definitely more. It’s a massive 
Jaffa Cake, and Mary loves it. Rav’s is too dry, and Tom’s needed more Kirsch. 
Kate’s blue cake looks a bit of mess, and her swallows look like squashed 
penguins. Selasi’s cake lacks shine, but looks amazing inside and Paul loves 
the flavour. Val’s chocolate cake has a weird texture, and Lee’s is too simple, 
with no decorations. Louise’s cake has no mirror glaze at all, but is delicious.

Benjamin’s buttercream has turned into scrambled egg, so she’s starting again. 
Cakes are being iced and decorated, and everything seems to be melting. Nobody 
looks very happy, glazes aren’t setting and everyone needs a freezer. Benjamina 
starts to cry, but lovely Sue comes to the rescue. Stick with it, Benjamina.

Candice’s genoise is rubbery, so she’s using it as a frisbee and starting 
again. Val didn’t put the right amount of sugar in, so is also starting again. 
Basically half the tent is starting again, because their sponges are rubbish. 
It’s not a great start, is it?

close   Jane’s amazing mirror-glaze cake wins. Photograph: BBC 
So that’s it for Week 1! I’m exhausted. Seems like a good bunch of bakers this 
year, should be a fun series. I’ll be back next Wednesday for Biscuit Week, and 
don’t forget to put Saturday 3rd September in your diary for the Strictly 
Launch Night liveblog.


In the meantime I’m off to watch The Chronicles of Nadiya - you’ll find me on 
Twitter @heidistephens, so come and say hello if you’re passing. Have a great 
week! Hx
 
So who will win this week’s Star Baker, and who is going home? Star Baker 
is...JANE! And going home this week is...LEE. It’s the right decision, he 
didn’t have a great weekend. Bye Lee, your stay in the tent of dreams was 
fleeting, but that’s the way the Bake Off cookie crumbles.

  Paul Hollywood described Andrew’s cake as “...stunning.” Photograph: BBC 
Andrew’s cake looks stunning, and his genoise is perfect. Candice cries a bit 
more, I don’t think I’ve ever seen Paul’s Paddington stare deployed so often.

 
Benjamina’s white chocolate has a lovely shine, and her genoise is lovely. YAY 
BENJAMINA! Candice’s glaze is lovely on the top, but the sides are a bit 
lacking. The genoise is underbaked, however - Paul describes it as “awful”. She 
has a little cry.

 Mel Giedroyc gives Benjamina spome encouragement. Photograph: BBC  
Paul loves how Jane’s cake looks - less is definitely more. It’s a massive 
Jaffa Cake, and Mary loves it. Rav’s is too dry, and Tom’s needed more Kirsch. 
Kate’s blue cake looks a bit of mess, and her swallows look like squashed 
penguins. Selasi’s cake lacks shine, but looks amazing inside and Paul loves 
the flavour. Val’s chocolate cake has a weird texture, and Lee’s is too simple, 
with no decorations. Louise’s cake has no mirror glaze at all, but is delicious.
 
Goodness, that was tense. Time for some judging.

 
Everyone’s having a massive meltdown apart from Selasi, who might as well have 
a cigar and a smoking jacket.

 
Benjamin’s buttercream has turned into scrambled egg, so she’s starting again. 
Cakes are being iced and decorated, and everything seems to be melting. Nobody 
looks very happy, glazes aren’t setting and everyone needs a freezer. Benjamina 
starts to cry, but lovely Sue comes to the rescue. Stick with it, Benjamina.

 
Jane prefers an adult-only filling, the saucy minx. Meanwhile Kate is putting 
swallows on her cake, and also has swallows on her dress and on her earrings. 
She LOVES swallows.

 
Tom’s cake has a ton of Kirsch in it. His signature bake was 80% gin, so 
clearly Tom likes his booze. It’s the way to Mary’s heart, anyway.
