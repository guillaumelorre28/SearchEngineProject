BBC Radio 4 has pulled an edition of interview series On The Ropes featuring DJ
Andy Kershaw <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-kershaw> that was due to 
be broadcast today over fears it would impinge on the privacy of his former 
girlfriend and their children.

Kershaw was interviewed by John Humphrys for the heavily trailed edition of 
the Radio 4 series, which was due to be broadcast today at 9am, but was pulled 
at the last minute.

The Radio 4 controller, Mark Damazer, said: "We had hoped that we could 
explore the events leading to his personal and professional crisis and his 
subsequent efforts to recover while bearing in mind the interests of other 
parties and providing them with the appropriate degree of privacy.

"In the end that was not possible. The programme was recorded and edited close 
to the day of transmission – hence the lateness of the decision."

Writing on his Radio 4 blog 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2009/04/on_the_ropes_andy_kershaw.html>, 
Damazer added: "It is not often that we remove a programme from the schedule at 
short notice.

"The On The Ropes <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071nm9> we had hoped to 
broadcast this morning in the end did not work.

"We were mindful of the background and, in particular, the strained domestic 
circumstances surrounding the breakup of Andy Kershaw's long-term relationship 
and the legal order, the result of which makes it very difficult for him to 
have significant access to his children."

The programme featured Kershaw talking about rebuilding his life and career 
after losing hisBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Radio 3 show and 
spending time in prison for breaking a restraining order.

Kershaw was found guilty of drink driving. He breached a restraining order 
last year and wasjailed for three months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/16/radio.presenter.jailed>.

In advance publicity for the show <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jxb02>, 
the BBC said: "Andy has enjoyed a highly successful broadcasting career, 
winning a brace of Sony radio awards and receiving critical acclaim for his 
reports from Rwanda, Angola, Haiti and Iraq.

"However, his outspoken opinions led to him being dropped by Radio 1; he 
openly attacked Bob Geldof over his stance on Africa and in 2007 his personal 
life began to suffer. He is attempting to rebuild his life and career."

In a statement today, Radio 4 added: "This morning's edition of BBC Radio 4's 
On the Ropes, in which John Humphrys interviews Andy Kershaw, will not be 
broadcast. "The aim of the programme was to explore the events leading to 
Kershaw's breakdown and his subsequent efforts to recover, whilst providing the 
other parties involved with an appropriate degree of privacy. This, however, 
did not prove possible.

"The programme was recorded and edited very close to the day of broadcast, 
hence the lateness of the decision to cancel.

"Andy Kershaw's behaviour throughout the interview was in no way an issue and 
had nothing to do with the decision to pull the programme."

It is understood the programme was cleared by the corporation's lawyers last 
week and the decision to pull it was made by Damazer late yesterday.

Promoting the programme on BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday afternoon, Humphrys said 
Kershaw "cuts a very sad figure" but was "coming out the other side".

"I said to him during the course of the interview you are pretty hyper and he 
said 'I am always hyper, I am always hyper'," Humphrystold Simon Mayo 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00k1x5q/Simon_Mayo_27_04_2009/>.

"But he seemed to me to be in control of himself, he is desperately keen as 
you can imagine to get back into the business. He was very good, wasn't he?

"He hasn't touched a drop for 10 months, he said he stopped drinking. He's a 
sad man, there's no point in trying to pretend otherwise.

"His relationship fell apart, that was the cause of it all, he doesn't have 
proper access to his children. His latest relationship with his girlfriend has 
fallen apart. He doesn't have a job; he is living by himself effectively on the 
Isle of Man.

"In many ways he cuts a very sad figure, and I have to say I felt a good deal 
of sympathy for him as a colleague and a human being.

"But I think he's coming out the other side now – he assured me that he was 
coming out the other side. I would like to think one of these days we will hear 
him on the airwaves again."

Some Radio 4 listeners were today critical of the decision to pull the show at 
such late notice and without an on-air explanation.

"I take it then that there will be an on-air apology and explanation prior to 
the evening broadcast of On The Ropes," one listener said on the Radio 4 
messageboards. The show is repeated at 9.30pm.

"I was looking forward to hearing Andy Kershaw, surely his (ex)family were 
informed that the programme was going to be broadcast: obviously not."

Another listener said: "Shame the BBC weren't a bit more organised but then - 
hey - they're only the worlds premier broadcasting organisation."

On The Ropes, presented by Humphrys, features in-depth interviews with 
successful people who have weathered storms in their careers. Today Radio 4 
repeated an interview with Salman Rushdie in place of the Kershaw show.
