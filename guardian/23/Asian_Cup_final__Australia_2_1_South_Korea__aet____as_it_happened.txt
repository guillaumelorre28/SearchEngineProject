Final thoughts

I’m spent, ladies and gentleman. You’re spent. Imagine how the Socceroos and 
the Koreans feel. Both teams gave it everything tonight. Korea can be proud and 
they deserved their late late equaliser. But what an effort fromAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> to put that disappointment 
behind them and get on top in extra time. Postecoglou has done a brilliant job 
with this team and deserves all the plaudits. The future looks bright for 
Australian football.

And as the trophy presentation gets underway, I’ll leave you with the news 
that Robbie Kruse has just come on to the field on crutches, his left foot in a 
moon boot. At the sight of him his teammates rush over to embrace him, one big 
happy family.

Australia are 2015 Asian Cup champions

From somewhere the Socceroos have received —and put on— shirts that are more 
or less identical to the ones they wore in the game except these ones all have 
‘Champions’ written across the back. I imagine had the Socceroos lost the game 
these would have been taken out the back, put into an incinerator and torched 
lest word of their existence got out.

Here are some words from Postecoglou that I won’t claim are exact but you’ll 
get the gist:

“I’m not good for words right now. I’m super proud of everyone; players, 
staff, the whole organisation. I couldn’t be happier. It was tough, a real 
final; you have to grind those out sometimes. The courage the players showed 
was enormous.

“My only concern [after the late equaliser] was that after that heartbreak we 
couldn’t pick ourselves up [mentally]. But I knew we were fit, I knew we had 
half an hour of petrol in is, and I didn’t think they did.

“I know the whole country will be off their couches and won’t sleep tonight. 
Hopefully from now on us Aussies can take on the world. Not just these guys. 
I’ve got real belief in Aussie footballers.”

Ange Postecoglou is striding the sideline punching the air, fanning the fans’ 
roars and cheers with his arms. The Socceroos are arm in arm jumping up and 
down like some Antipodean marsupial the name of which escapes me.

ET 29: Troisi does very well to hold off three red shirts to try and find 
Juric in space but Korea just press him into an error.

And again Korea push forward. But their effort ends with a chipped ball 
forward that Ryan rushes out to meet and double fists clear. Offisde, however, 
andAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> get a chance to 
breathe.

ET 26: A Korea throw deep on the right. Damn this is tense! Ki holds off 
Troisi but the ball is turned over and a Socceroo, not sure who, just kicks it 
downfield to no-one.

ET 25: Lovely work by Ki on the left, weaving in and out and passing with the 
outside of his left boot to Kim Jin-Su. Kim would have got to that an hour ago 
but not this time as Milligan clears.

ET 19: A great penalty shout for Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> as Kim Young-Gwon clatters 
into the back of Leckie. But no.

Now Juric is freed on the right but he decides against a right foot shot from 
the right of the box and cuts in on his left. He shouldn’t have.

ET 18: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have done 
remarkably well to get over that goal and I’d say they’ve had the better of 
extra time.

Meantime, Nick Mangafas keeps it short nd sweet: “Come on!!!!”

ET 16: Davidson stifles Korea with some lovely defending but there’s no time 
to admire his handy work asAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> nip downfield. But Juric is 
called offside when he takes the ball of McKay’s feet when McKay (whowasn’t 
offside) just might have fashioned a shot.

ET 15: Juric scraps with Kim for the ball on the byline... They are at it for 
an age, Juric even goes down. But he gets back up and wriggles clear, crossing 
across the face of goal! Kim dives at it deflecting it into the path of Troisi.

ET 12: Korea, who’ve been defending for the past five or so minutes, push 
forward. And the goalscorer Son Heung-min races inside before playing a reverse 
pass to Kim Jin-Su overlapping. He gets to the byline and crosses but it’s too 
close to Ryan who gets it to safety.

ET 10: In traffic on the right Luongo crosses cleverly to Troisi and Juric, 
shoulder to shoulder, and it might have found one of them had keeper Kim not 
dived forward at full stretch to punch it away!

ET 9: Ryan intercepts the ball about 20 yards outside his own box. He doesn’t 
get it cleanly, however, and just when you think Korea might take advantage you 
realise the linesman had spotted a Korea offside.

ET 7: Spiranovic, already on a yellow, is a little lucky to be on the park. 
Lee Keun-ho slides into a 50/50 and Spiranovic gets there a split second later, 
his slightly airborne boot missing the ball and taking Lee’s ankle.

ET 2: Korea continue to press Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> but the Socceroos enjoy a 
brief period of possession.

But here’s our first cramp victim, Jang Hyun-soo. Our commentators are giving 
it to the ref for allowing him to be treated, delaying a Leckie throw-in. That

You’d have to say Korea have the edge now. Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have to put that late goal 
behind them. Easier said than done, of course.

Thomas Walker has been robbed of a cracking breakfast: “Update from New York - 
my American girlfriend and I were getting ready to pop the corks on a champagne 
brekky, then the news of that Korean goal came through... Got a bad feeling 
about extra time. We need Cahill on the pitch.”

90 + 2 min: Australia were almost there when Korea exchanged some short sharp 
passes on the edge of the box. Ki slipped a ball through to Son who ran in on 
goal as Ryan tried to cut down the angle. But Son kept his cool and with almost 
the last kick of regulation time found the back of the net from close range. 
Heartbreaking forAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>, 
but you can’t say Korea didn’t deserve it.

90 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> win a 
freekick deep in their own half as we tick into the 90th minute. They are not 
in a rush to take it. When they do it is sent deep, deep, deep. Juric ends up 
with it but his half-hearted attempt at a cross ends up in a goalkick to Korea. 
They pum it forward...

There will be three minutes of extra time...

crowd. Minutes left!

83 min: Still Korea, as Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> seem to be dropping deeper and 
deeper. Korea win a free-kick, 35 yards out, dead centre. Son Heung-min walks 
back like he’s about to attempt a long-range penalty at Eden Park. And he hits 
it in the same manner, sending it high over the bar.

81 min: Another turnover, by McKay this time, winds up with Korean danger man 
Ki. Korea work it from one flank to another but Kim Jin-Su’s cross from the 
left isn’t great. To be fair he’s put in a hell of a shift, Kim, and must be 
knackered.

Leckie picks up the crumbs and advances into dangerous areas. He squares to 
Troisi. Troisi makes room for a shot but not enough. It’s blocked and loops to 
Kim in goal.

I’m spent, ladies and gentleman. You’re spent. Imagine how the Socceroos and 
the Koreans feel. Both teams gave it everything tonight. Korea can be proud and 
they deserved their late late equaliser. But what an effort fromAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> to put that disappointment 
behind them and get on top in extra time. Postecoglou has done a brilliant job 
with this team and deserves all the plaudits. The future looks bright for 
Australian football.

And as the trophy presentation gets underway, I’ll leave you with the news 
that Robbie Kruse has just come on to the field on crutches, his left foot in a 
moon boot. At the sight of him his teammates rush over to embrace him, one big 
happy family.

Australia are 2015 Asian Cup champions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/31/socceroos-lift-asian-cup-after-dramatic-extra-time-win-over-south-korea>
!
 
From somewhere the Socceroos have received —and put on— shirts that are more 
or less identical to the ones they wore in the game except these ones all have 
‘Champions’ written across the back. I imagine had the Socceroos lost the game 
these would have been taken out the back, put into an incinerator and torched 
lest word of their existence got out.
 
Here are some words from Postecoglou that I won’t claim are exact but you’ll 
get the gist:

“I’m not good for words right now. I’m super proud of everyone; players, 
staff, the whole organisation. I couldn’t be happier. It was tough, a real 
final; you have to grind those out sometimes. The courage the players showed 
was enormous.

“My only concern [after the late equaliser] was that after that heartbreak we 
couldn’t pick ourselves up [mentally]. But I knew we were fit, I knew we had 
half an hour of petrol in is, and I didn’t think they did.

“I know the whole country will be off their couches and won’t sleep tonight. 
Hopefully from now on us Aussies can take on the world. Not just these guys. 
I’ve got real belief in Aussie footballers.”
 
Ange Postecoglou is striding the sideline punching the air, fanning the fans’ 
roars and cheers with his arms. The Socceroos are arm in arm jumping up and 
down like some Antipodean marsupial the name of which escapes me.
 
What. A. Game

And the Socceroos collapse into puddles of spent bodies!
 
ET 30 + 1 min: A mad scramble in the Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> area! The ball is pin-balling 
all over the joint but it runs over the byline as the ref whistles a Korea 
offside...
 
ET 30: There will be one additional minute! Korea in possession, a throw in 
midway in their own half... They surge down the left...
 
ET 29: Troisi does very well to hold off three red shirts to try and find 
Juric in space but Korea just press him into an error.

And again Korea push forward. But their effort ends with a chipped ball 
forward that Ryan rushes out to meet and double fists clear. Offisde, however, 
andAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> get a chance to 
breathe.
 
ET 27: Cha Du-ri tries to get on the outside of Davidson and does well enough 
to find room for a cross but he hits it straight to Ryan.
 
ET 26: A Korea throw deep on the right. Damn this is tense! Ki holds off 
Troisi but the ball is turned over and a Socceroo, not sure who, just kicks it 
downfield to no-one.
 
ET 25: Lovely work by Ki on the left, weaving in and out and passing with the 
outside of his left boot to Kim Jin-Su. Kim would have got to that an hour ago 
but not this time as Milligan clears.
 
ET 23: Korea are coming again! Wave after wave and Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> resort to booting it over the 
sideline.
 
ET 21: Matt Ryan hoofs a goal kick forward. Not playing out from the back 
now—not that you can blame them.
 
ET 20: Korea’s Kim Jin-Su ‘delaps’ a throw into the Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> box but they scramble it clear.
 
ET 19: A great penalty shout for Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> as Kim Young-Gwon clatters 
into the back of Leckie. But no.

Now Juric is freed on the right but he decides against a right foot shot from 
the right of the box and cuts in on his left. He shouldn’t have.
 
ET 18: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have done 
remarkably well to get over that goal and I’d say they’ve had the better of 
extra time.

Meantime, Nick Mangafas keeps it short nd sweet: “Come on!!!!”
 
ET 16: Davidson stifles Korea with some lovely defending but there’s no time 
to admire his handy work asAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> nip downfield. But Juric is 
called offside when he takes the ball of McKay’s feet when McKay (whowasn’t 
offside) just might have fashioned a shot.
 
Just time for a drink and we are back on! What an exhausting game to watch. I 
dare say it’s exhausting to play too.

scorrrrrrres!!!!

ET 15: Juric scraps with Kim for the ball on the byline... They are at it for 
an age, Juric even goes down. But he gets back up and wriggles clear, crossing 
across the face of goal! Kim dives at it deflecting it into the path of Troisi. 
Troisi.....
 
ET 12: Korea, who’ve been defending for the past five or so minutes, push 
forward. And the goalscorer Son Heung-min races inside before playing a reverse 
pass to Kim Jin-Su overlapping. He gets to the byline and crosses but it’s too 
close to Ryan who gets it to safety.
 
ET 10: In traffic on the right Luongo crosses cleverly to Troisi and Juric, 
shoulder to shoulder, and it might have found one of them had keeper Kim not 
dived forward at full stretch to punch it away!
 
ET 9: Ryan intercepts the ball about 20 yards outside his own box. He doesn’t 
get it cleanly, however, and just when you think Korea might take advantage you 
realise the linesman had spotted a Korea offside.
 
ET 7: Spiranovic, already on a yellow, is a little lucky to be on the park. 
Lee Keun-ho slides into a 50/50 and Spiranovic gets there a split second later, 
his slightly airborne boot missing the ball and taking Lee’s ankle.
 
ET 6: The entire Korea team are behind the ball as Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> probe, but in this passage 
they are like a dentist with a blunt tool.
 
ET 4:  Neither team is in a hurry to restart play when the ball goes out. 
Fatigue is setting in.
 
ET 2: Korea continue to press Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> but the Socceroos enjoy a 
brief period of possession.

But here’s our first cramp victim, Jang Hyun-soo. Our commentators are giving 
it to the ref for allowing him to be treated, delaying a Leckie throw-in. That 
led to nothing.
 
Here we go again...
 
You’d have to say Korea have the edge now. Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have to put that late goal 
behind them. Easier said than done, of course.

Thomas Walker has been robbed of a cracking breakfast: “Update from New York - 
my American girlfriend and I were getting ready to pop the corks on a champagne 
brekky, then the news of that Korean goal came through... Got a bad feeling 
about extra time. We need Cahill on the pitch.”
 
And we’ll play 30 minutes of extra time. I don’t know how any of these players 
will last. I don’t know I’ll last!
 
90 + 2 min: Australia were almost there when Korea exchanged some short sharp 
passes on the edge of the box. Ki slipped a ball through to Son who ran in on 
goal as Ryan tried to cut down the angle. But Son kept his cool and with almost 
the last kick of regulation time found the back of the net from close range. 
Heartbreaking forAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>, 
but you can’t say Korea didn’t deserve it.

90 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> win a 
freekick deep in their own half as we tick into the 90th minute. They are not 
in a rush to take it. When they do it is sent deep, deep, deep. Juric ends up 
with it but his half-hearted attempt at a cross ends up in a goalkick to Korea. 
They pum it forward...

There will be three minutes of extra time...
 
88 min: Korea sub but so quick are they to make it that I missed the names! 
And still the actions ebbs and flows to a soundtrack of a screams from the 
crowd. Minutes left!
 
87 min: A chance, but Troisi skews one wide with his left after dribbling 
across the Korea box.
 
85 min: Australia push forward with Leckie but Kim Young-Gwon dispossess him 
and immediately launches a counter. But Korea just can’t create a clear 
opportunity asAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> dig in.

Rycroft/AP  
83 min: Still Korea, as Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> seem to be dropping deeper and 
deeper. Korea win a free-kick, 35 yards out, dead centre. Son Heung-min walks 
back like he’s about to attempt a long-range penalty at Eden Park. And he hits 
it in the same manner, sending it high over the bar.
 
81 min: Another turnover, by McKay this time, winds up with Korean danger man 
Ki. Korea work it from one flank to another but Kim Jin-Su’s cross from the 
left isn’t great. To be fair he’s put in a hell of a shift, Kim, and must be 
knackered.
 
80 min: Just 10 minutes to go! Troisi wins a free kick after shielding the 
ball with some skill butAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> turn it over straight away. 
Such is the Korean pressure.
 
79 min:  Clare Lawrence is still wondering what that card for Kruse was for. 
“He’s off injured, hardly a dive!”
 
77 min: It’s still end to end stuff but here Kim Young-Gwon gives it up and 
Leckie picks up the crumbs and advances into dangerous areas. He squares to 
Troisi. Troisi makes room for a shot but not enough. It’s blocked and loops to 
Kim in goal.
 
75 min: Juric is taken down 30 yards out and Australia are awarded a freekick. 
ButAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> chose to pass it 
around instead of putting it in the mixer. They lose the ball.
 
74 min: Now Franjic walks off, unable to continue. Matt McKay comes on in his 
stead. Milligan to right fullback, MacKay into midfield.
