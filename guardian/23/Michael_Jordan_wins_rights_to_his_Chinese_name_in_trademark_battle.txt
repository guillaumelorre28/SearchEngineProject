Michael Jordan has won part of his trademark case against a China-based 
sportswear company, following the retired basketball star’s years-long struggle 
for control over the rights to his Chinese name.


In a ruling by the Chinese supreme court, Qiaodan Sports Co, based in 
south-eastern Fujian province, must stop using the Chinese characters forQiaodan
 on its merchandise, according to a transcript of court records posted on an 
official website.

The word is a Chinese rendering of Jordan’s name that is widely known by the 
country’s consumers.

Does China deserve a reputation as the land of copycats?

The supreme court did not stop the company from using phonetic spellings of 
Jordan’s Chinese name using the English alphabet, however, saying they do not 
infringe on his right to use his name in the country.

“I am happy that the supreme people’s court has recognised the right to 
protect my name through its ruling in the trademark cases,” Jordan said in a 
statement.

“Today’s decision ensures that my Chinese fans and all Chinese consumers know 
that Qiaodan Sports and its products have no connection to me.”

The former Chicago Bulls player

 asked Chinese authorities in 2012 to revoke the company’s trademarks, which 
featured a similar name and logo to Jordan’s Nike-produced brand.

The six-time NBA champion, who retired in 2003, accused the company of 
misleading consumers about its ties to him by using the name along with a 
silhouette of a leaping basketball player resembling the “Jumpman” logo used by
Nike <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nike> to promote its Air Jordan 
brand.

Jordan filed his appeal to China’s highest court after his claims were 
rejected by two lower courts.

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> has long been seen as a 
counterfeiters’ haven and has constantly been criticised by its trade partners 
over lax protection of intellectual property rights.

It remained on this year’s US priority watch list of trading partners that 
fail to protect such rights despite “welcome developments ... [in] legal and 
regulatory reform efforts, and encouraging developments in individual cases in 
China’s courts”, according to the committee that compiles the list.

Qiaodan Sports Co could not be reached for comment.
