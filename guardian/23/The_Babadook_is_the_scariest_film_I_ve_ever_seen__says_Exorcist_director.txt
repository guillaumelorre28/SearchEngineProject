Warming to his theme, Friedkin offered to host a screening of the film and 
berated US distributor IFC Films for failing to secure enough cinema screens 
for the movie.The Babadook <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-babadook> is 
now available to view on demand in north America after opening on limited 
release at the weekend. The film hit UK cinemas on 24 October and is still 
screening in iconic locations such as the Empire in Leicester Square.

The Observer’s Mark Kermode 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/26/the-babadook-review-mark-kermode-brilliant-chiller>
 has compared the horror to Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin and 
labelled it a “nightmarish fairytale about enchanted books and accursed 
dreams”, which will “make your skin crawl, your pulse quicken and the hairs on 
the back of your neck stand to attention”.

The Babadook is the story of a widow, played by acclaimed Australian stage 
actor Essie Davis, plagued by memories of her husband’s violent death. After 
discovering a mysterious new story book on the shelves of her six-year-old 
son’s bedroom wall, she comes to believe that his visions of a sinister 
fairytale monster – the relentless Babadook – may be real.

Friedkin’s intervention is not the only sign that Kent’s debut feature may be 
moving out from under the radar, and perhaps even towards a late run for awards 
season contention. It was named best first film at the New York Film Critics 
Circle awards on 2 December and has also picked up a number of festival awards.
