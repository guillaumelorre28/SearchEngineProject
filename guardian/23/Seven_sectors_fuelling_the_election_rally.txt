Seven sectors helped pull the London stock market higher in the wake of the 
Conservative party’s shock victory in the 2015 general election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/07/exit-poll-conservatives-win-david-cameron-general-election-labour>
, largely because the threat of Labour policies in these areas has now been 
lifted.

The pound surged and London’s blue chip index raced ahead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/08/pound-surges-after-shock-election-result-conservatives-seats-ftse-100>
, with the FTSE 100 index up by 150 points, or 2%, at one stage. The FTSE 250 
index – a broader measure of the UK economy – reached an all-time high.

Banks
 Bank shares rallied on Friday morning. This shows the FTSE 350 banking index.

Labour had been aiming to inject more competition into the banking sector – 
which is already being subjected to a Competition and Markets Authority review 
– by calling for the creation of new challenger banks and a market share test. 
There could also have been a bankers’ bonus tax to help pay for its compulsory 
jobs guarantee.

Shares in the bailed-out Lloyds Banking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> Group and Royal Bank of Scotland 
were among the early gainers because the Conservatives have pledged to press on 
with sales of their shares. In the case of Lloyds, where the taxpayer stake has 
already dipped below 20% from 43% at the time of the bailout, there may now be 
an offering to retail investors.

Housebuilders and estate agents
 The FTSE 350 construction and material index rose on Friday as shares in 
housebuilders jumped. Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Labour had pledged to introduce a mansion tax on homes worth £2m or more to 
fund the NHS and also cap rent increases in the private sector to make housing 
more affordable for tenants, hence a sharp rally in shares in estate agents 
Savills, Foxtons and housebuilders Countrywide and Berkeley.

Analysts at Liberun said: “UK housebuilders should benefit given there will be 
no mansion tax, rental caps or immediate headwinds from the bond markets. The 
Conservatives have shown themselves supportive of housebuilding through the 
help to buy policy, which was extended to 2020, and their manifesto commits 
them to remain pro-housebuilding”.

 Shares in Centrica, shown on this chart against the FTSE 100, and SSE - 
Scottish and Southern Energy - were among the early gainers in the FTSE 100.

A Labour government had pledged to freeze gas and electricity bills until 
2017. At one point this led Sir Roger Carr, the then chairman of British Gas 
ownerCentrica <https://www.theguardian.com/business/centrica>, to warn of 
“economic ruin” for energy firms.

Shares in Centrica led the FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 
100 risers, with a gain of 8%, and SSE – Scottish and Southern Energy – were 
also among the top risers, with a gain of just over 5%.

 Ladbrokes shares jumped, as shown here against the FTSE 100 - also higher in 
Friday morning trading. Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Labour had pledged to crack down fixed odd betting terminals, often described 
as the “crack cocaine” of the gambling industry. In its manifesto, Labour said 
that local councils would be able to review betting shop licences and reduce 
the number of terminals if needed.

Ladbrokes <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ladbrokes> was greatly exposed 
to this set of policies, and its shares topped the FTSE 250 leaderboard with a 
gain of more than 10%.

 Shares in Capita, shown here against the FTSE 100, were higher along with 
other outsourcing companies. Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Labour had been likely to reduce the role of outsourcing companies in public 
sector contracts, and the uncertainty over the outcome had already seen some 
delays in the award of contracts to some of the main players.

With five years of Conservative government committed to cutting public 
spending and ideologically keen on outsourcing – despite several high-profile 
problems in the sector – the companies have seen their shares climb.Capita 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/capitagroup> rose 5% while G4S has added 
1.5% and Serco rose 6%.

 With the threat to Trident removed, contractors to the project have moved 
higher. Babcock International shares jumped, as shown here against a stronger 
FTSE 100. Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Both Labour and the Conservatives had pledged to replace the four Trident 
nuclear submarines in a project likely to cost more than £100bn over its 
30-year lifespan. But the Scottish National party was clear it wanted to scrap 
the defence system, and the prospect of a Labour minority government supported 
by the SNP had caused uncertainty about the outlook.


Labour had also said it would launch a review of defence spending overall, 
while the Conservatives said they would not sanction further cuts in the 
regular army.

With the threat to Trident removed, contractors to the project have moved 
higher.Babcock International 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/babcockinternationalgroup> rose 8%, BAE 
Systems 3% and Rolls-Royce 0.5%.

Among the other defence companies, QinetiQ, the former Ministry of Defence 
research division, rose by more than 2%.

 Shares in bus and train operators, such as Stagecoach, rose in morning trading 
on Friday. Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Labour had promised to rip up the existing rail franchise system, and had 
criticised the move to return the East Coast mainline from public ownership to 
a company jointly owned byStagecoach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/stagecoachgroup> and Virgin Rail.

It wanted to allow public operators to be allowed to bid for franchises 
alongside private sector companies, thus falling short of full nationalisation.

Labour wanted to give more power to cities and regions to improve bus services 
and integrate them with other modes of transport such as trams. But operators 
claimed it would push up prices. In the wake of the party’s defeat Stagecoach 
climbed 6.5%, Go-Ahead 4.6% and National Express 3%.
