Nicaragua <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicaragua>’s congress has 
scuppered a bill backed by thousands of people hoping to block a cross-country 
canal project, saying the legislature does not have the authority to weigh the 
issue.

The draft legislation presented by rural dwellers living along the proposed 
canal’s path “is rejected as inadmissable”, congress’s first secretary wrote in 
a letter made public on Monday, adding that the chamber lacks the 
“jurisdiction” to handle it.

The government hopes the ambitious canal project will rival Panama’s lucrative 
canal, which handles 5% of commercial maritime traffic.

Some 28,000 Nicaraguans signed a petition backing the bill, which sought to 
block the state’s authorisation giving the canal project to a Chinese 
consortium, HKND, to build and run for 50 years.

Seven thousand of those signatures were stamped, as required by law. Only 
5,000 stamped signatures must be collected for congress to consider a citizen’s 
bill.

The legislature argued on Monday that it is unable to debate the citizen’s 
bill because of a 2013 ruling by the country’s supreme court rejecting a 
complaint against the canal and drawing a line under the issue.

A legal consultant for the petitioning rural citizens, Mónica López, 
criticised congress’s decision, saying the lawmakers were declaring that “the 
law on the canal is written in stone and 28,000 signatures cannot modify it”.

That, she said, was “a legal aberration, an outrageous situation”.

Congress in June 2013 approved a law handing the canal’s operating rights to 
the HKND consortium, which is tasked with building the gargantuan waterway at a 
cost of $50bn.
