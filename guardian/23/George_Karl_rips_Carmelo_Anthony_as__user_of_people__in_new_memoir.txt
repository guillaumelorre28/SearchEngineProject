Longtime NBA coach George Karl blasted New York Knicks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-knicks> star Carmelo Anthony in a 
memoir set to be released next month, calling the nine-times NBA all-star a 
“true conundrum” and a “user of people, addicted to the spotlight”.

Karl, who coached Anthony with the Denver Nuggets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/denver-nuggets> from January 2005 until 
February 2011, spared no criticism of his former charge, who in August became 
the first ever three-times Olympic gold medalist in men’s basketball.

“Carmelo was a true conundrum for me in the six years I had him,” Karl wrote 
in an advance copy of Furious George: My Forty Years Surviving NBA Divas, 
Clueless GMs, and Poor Shot Selection that wasobtained by the New York Post 
<http://nypost.com/2016/12/22/george-karl-rips-user-carmelo-anthony-in-upcoming-book/>
. “He was the best offensive player I ever coached. He was also a user of 
people, addicted to the spotlight and very unhappy when he had to share it.”

Added Karl: “He really lit my fuse with his low demand of himself on defense. 
He had no commitment to the hard, dirty work of stopping the other guy.

“My ideal – probably every coach’s ideal – is when your best player is also 
your leader. But since Carmelo only played hard on one side of the ball, he 
made it plain he couldn’t lead the Nuggets, even though he said he wanted to. 
Coaching him meant working around his defense and compensating for his 
attitude.”

Karl, one of only nine NBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> coaches 
with more than 1,000 career victories, described an organization-wide sense of 
relief when the Nuggets finally accommodated Anthony’s persistent request for a 
trade out of Denver in 2011, calling it “a sweet release for the coach and the 
team, like popping a blister”.

“I want as much effort on defense – maybe more – as on offense,” Karl wrote. 
“That was never going to happen with Melo, whose amazing ability to score with 
the ball made him a star but didn’t make him a winner. Which I pointed out to 
him. Which he didn’t like.”

The 65-year-old former coach also criticized JR Smith and Kenyon Martin, two 
of Anthony’s team-mates in Denver, likening them to “the spoiled brats you see 
in junior golf and junior tennis” and referencing the trio collectively as “AAU 
babies”.

Karl, who was fired from his most recent coaching post with Sacramento at the 
end of last season, amassed a career record of 1,175-824 in stints with the 
Kings, Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle Supersonics, Golden State Warriors and 
Cleveland Cavaliers.
