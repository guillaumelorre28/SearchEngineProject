Well, that was a long night. But Chile are in the final, and they’ll play 
Argentina on Sunday in a repeat of last year’s final. A shame that the game was 
delayed for more than two hours by bad weather in Chicago, but Chile were 
awesome in that opening 15 minutes, andColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> never recovered.

Thanks for reading – I’m off for a Solero. Night.

90 min: Now James is late on Pulgar. No card, although it probably should have 
been. Four minutes of stoppage time, but the game’s gone.

88 min: Mark Gonzalez is on for Vargas, and then Murillo goes in late and high 
on Puch. Bacca is booked, but it seems as though Murillo has escaped. That was 
naughty from the Colombian defender.

87 min: Now it’s Chile’s turn to look perplexed at a penalty that’s not given. 
Lovely three-man move involving Puch, Vargas and Alexis, who was clean through, 
took an extra touch, before being hauled down by Zapata. Referee Aguilar says 
no penalty. That was possibly even clearer than James’s.

77 min: Here’s Mark Fritzel: “Considering all the factors, this has been a 
crackling second half. Still seeing a few splashes now and then. Colombia’s 
threatened a handful of times since they went down to ten. Hard not to root for 
them in the face of the uneven calls. They should’ve either had a penalty or 
kept 11 men.Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> hasn’t slowed 
down their attack either.”

67 min: Here’s Robert Speed: “‎The question the ref should ask himself is 
whether a yellow card was warranted. If yes, and it is a second caution, he’s 
sent off. Whether he’s already been booked is irrelevant to the decision of 
whether a second booking is warranted under the laws of the game. By design.”

Yeah, could well be. And Sanchez is hardly Mother Teresa. But I just query 
whether it was really necessary, considering the state of the match.

62 min: Here’s Barrett Madden: “I just don’t understand the difference between 
the contact that wasn’t called a penalty – it’s not even a foul – and the 
contact that was both whistled for a foul and given a yellow card. That seems a 
huge difference in the interpretation of the rules by the ref.”

Yep. Stupid decision.

60 min: James looks for Arias in the box, but it’s just too long, and it’s out 
for a goal kick.

On second glance, I think that second yellow from Joel Aguilar is absurd. In 
the context of the game, what’s the point of sending him off? It wasn’t even 
that bad a foul. The fans have waited around for more than two hours. It’s 
spoiled the game.

58 min: Well, Sanchez was certainly late on Aranguiz, and he’d already been 
booked, but was it really that bad? Joel Aguilar thought so. The Colombians 
were outraged, and they surrounded the ref, but he’d made his decision. You 
could argue that the ref was within his rights, but was a red card really 
necessary? A two-hour delay, and within 12 minutes one team is a man down.

55 min: Both sides have begun the second period with a pleasing intensity, but 
there’s a lack of crispness, I’d suggest. Several misplaced passes and poor 
pieces of control. At least they’ve got an excuse. What’s the England national 
team’s?

53 min: Great first-time cross from Isla from Aranguiz’s crossfield pass, but 
no one had gambled on it, and it skips all the way through the six-yard box.

51 min: Daniel Torres spins, as the water comes up around him, but his cross 
for Martinez is too long. Just going back to that penalty shout: I think Jara 
really got away with one. He didn’t win the ball, but he took plenty of James.

47 min: Penalty for Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia>? 
Joel Aguilar says no. Jara miscontrolled, James seized upon it, and Jara

46 min: There’s still rather a lot of water on the pitch, although it’s not

The players are still inside the stadium, but apparently they’ve been warming 
up in the past few minutes. Then we’ll have a short warm-up on the field, and 
hopefully get going in about 15 minutes.

Remember earlier this evening when there was a football match going on?

Well, if you’d forgotten, Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> 
lead 2-0, through Aranguiz and Fuenzalida. This second half should be a 
45-minute battle royal.

The officials have made their way out to check on the condition of the field. 
According to Dr Joe, their No1 consideration is “safety of the players”. Which 
means, in layman’s terms, making sure the pitch is fit to play on.

If, once the game starts, the officials decide it’s not fit, they can 
absolutely stop the game and suspend play for a second time, says Dr Joe.

Well, the fans – at least those who have stayed – are back in their seats, and 
the ground crew are still doing their thing on the pitch. The players are 
expected to re-emerge shortly, but they’ll need to warm up.

Ok, we’re hearing we’ve been pushed back a little further: it’s now an 11.20pm 
ET start. Groan.

Well, that was a long night. But Chile are in the final, and they’ll play 
Argentina on Sunday in a repeat of last year’s final. A shame that the game was 
delayed for more than two hours by bad weather in Chicago, but Chile were 
awesome in that opening 15 minutes, andColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> never recovered.

Thanks for reading – I’m off for a Solero. Night.
 
Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> are into the final!
 
90 min +4: Into the wall. That sums up Colombia’s evening.
 
90 min +3: Free kick to Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> 25 yards from goal. Chance for 
James.
 
90 min +2: We’re back after that minor delay, but Bravo has the ball. Seconds 
left.
 
90 min +1: Foul on halfway, and Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> sling it in, but it’s cleared. 
Now a fan is on the field, and is pursued by security. It’s all a bit tiresome.
 
90 min: Now James is late on Pulgar. No card, although it probably should have 
been. Four minutes of stoppage time, but the game’s gone.
 
88 min: Mark Gonzalez is on for Vargas, and then Murillo goes in late and high 
on Puch. Bacca is booked, but it seems as though Murillo has escaped. That was 
naughty from the Colombian defender.
 
87 min: Now it’s Chile’s turn to look perplexed at a penalty that’s not given. 
Lovely three-man move involving Puch, Vargas and Alexis, who was clean through, 
took an extra touch, before being hauled down by Zapata. Referee Aguilar says 
no penalty. That was possibly even clearer than James’s.
 
85 min: Aranguiz finds Vargas in space on the left, but his cross is missed by 
everyone. Silva is then yellow carded asColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> attempt to counter-attack.
 
83 min: Chile break, and Alexis runs past two defenders, but Murillo does well 
to get back and block. Roger Martinez then fouls Aranguiz, andChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> have a free kick.
 
82 min: Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> are still 
pressing. They just haven’t quite created one really clear chance in this 
second half, although they should have had a penalty after 90 seconds of it.
 
81 min: Perez shoots over the bar from long range. Time’s ticking.
 
80 min: A wasted corner, and it’s a goal kick.
 
79 min: Moreno shoots wide from James’s cross, but it’s deflected. Another 
corner, and Carlos Bacca replaces Juan Cuadrado.
 
78 min: Moreno races down the left and is flattened by Puch. Yellow card and a 
good set piece chance forColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia>.
 
77 min: Here’s Mark Fritzel: “Considering all the factors, this has been a 
crackling second half. Still seeing a few splashes now and then. Colombia’s 
threatened a handful of times since they went down to ten. Hard not to root for 
them in the face of the uneven calls. They should’ve either had a penalty or 
kept 11 men.Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> hasn’t slowed 
down their attack either.”
 
75 min: Vargas fouls Torres, but no yellow. The mainly Colombian crowd is 
unhappy.
 
74 min: Edson Puch on for Fuenzalida, who’s been great.
 
72 min: Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> have about 20 
minutes to save their tournament. Sebastian Perez is on for Fabra.
 
70 min: Alexis forces a corner. Roger Martinez heads clear.
 
68 min: Marlos Moreno, on for Edwin Cardona, finds the side netting. Then 
James forces a fumble from Claudio Bravo, but theChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> captain grabs the second ball just 
in time.
 
67 min: Here’s Robert Speed: “‎The question the ref should ask himself is 
whether a yellow card was warranted. If yes, and it is a second caution, he’s 
sent off. Whether he’s already been booked is irrelevant to the decision of 
whether a second booking is warranted under the laws of the game. By design.”
 
65 min: Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> look comfortable, 
and Pulgar forces a top save from Ospina! Beaten away from the Bologna man’s 
header.

@timmyhilleh <https://twitter.com/timmyhilleh> I think Sanchez’s second yellow 
was for persistent fouling
 <https://twitter.com/KtotheOhout/status/745824625226035201> June 23, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/KtotheOhout/status/745824625226035201> 
Yeah, could well be. And Sanchez is hardly Mother Teresa. But I just query 
whether it was really necessary, considering the state of the match.
 
64 min: Yellow for Beausejour for a trip on Cuadrado, who splashes to the 
ground on halfway.
 
62 min: Here’s Barrett Madden: “I just don’t understand the difference between 
the contact that wasn’t called a penalty – it’s not even a foul – and the 
contact that was both whistled for a foul and given a yellow card. That seems a 
huge difference in the interpretation of the rules by the ref.”

Yep. Stupid decision.
 
60 min: James looks for Arias in the box, but it’s just too long, and it’s out 
for a goal kick.

On second glance, I think that second yellow from Joel Aguilar is absurd. In 
the context of the game, what’s the point of sending him off? It wasn’t even 
that bad a foul. The fans have waited around for more than two hours. It’s 
spoiled the game.
 
58 min: Well, Sanchez was certainly late on Aranguiz, and he’d already been 
booked, but was it really that bad? Joel Aguilar thought so. The Colombians 
were outraged, and they surrounded the ref, but he’d made his decision. You 
could argue that the ref was within his rights, but was a red card really 
necessary? A two-hour delay, and within 12 minutes one team is a man down.
 
Oh dear. Is it all over now for Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia>?
 
55 min: Both sides have begun the second period with a pleasing intensity, but 
there’s a lack of crispness, I’d suggest. Several misplaced passes and poor 
pieces of control. At least they’ve got an excuse. What’s the England national 
team’s?
 
53 min: Great first-time cross from Isla from Aranguiz’s crossfield pass, but 
no one had gambled on it, and it skips all the way through the six-yard box.
 
51 min: Daniel Torres spins, as the water comes up around him, but his cross 
for Martinez is too long. Just going back to that penalty shout: I think Jara 
really got away with one. He didn’t win the ball, but he took plenty of James.
 
49 min: It’s been a decent start to the second half. Neither team looks 
particularly sluggish, although the ball is sticking in some places.
 
47 min: Penalty for Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia>? 
Joel Aguilar says no. Jara miscontrolled, James seized upon it, and Jara 
tripped him! That should have been a penalty. Lucky Chile!
 
46 min: There’s still rather a lot of water on the pitch, although it’s not 
quite synchronised swimming just yet. The ball seems to be rolling OK.
 
At last! Or, as they say in French, putain enfin!
 
We’re very close. Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia> had 
all the momentum going into the break, even though they were two down. What to 
expect now?
 
Chile are out on the pitch. We’re about seven minutes away from kick off.
 
The Colombians are going through some rudimentary warm-ups. No sign of Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> yet.
 
The players have just run out on to the pitch! And the crowd has gone wild. It 
does looks pretty wet under foot, although there doesn’t seem to be too much 
standing water.
 
The players are still inside the stadium, but apparently they’ve been warming 
up in the past few minutes. Then we’ll have a short warm-up on the field, and 
hopefully get going in about 15 minutes.
 
My colleague Graham Russell points out that it’s not a good idea to mess 
around with lightning:

Remember earlier this evening when there was a football match going on?

Well, if you’d forgotten, Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> 
lead 2-0, through Aranguiz and Fuenzalida. This second half should be a 
45-minute battle royal.
 
Add on another five minutes.
 
The officials have made their way out to check on the condition of the field. 
According to Dr Joe, their No1 consideration is “safety of the players”. Which 
means, in layman’s terms, making sure the pitch is fit to play on.

If, once the game starts, the officials decide it’s not fit, they can 
absolutely stop the game and suspend play for a second time, says Dr Joe.
 
Well, the fans – at least those who have stayed – are back in their seats, and 
the ground crew are still doing their thing on the pitch. The players are 
expected to re-emerge shortly, but they’ll need to warm up.

Ok, we’re hearing we’ve been pushed back a little further: it’s now an 11.20pm 
ET start. Groan.

@timmyhilleh <https://twitter.com/timmyhilleh> They just put ”Play will resume 
shortly" on the screen

<https://twitter.com/FUNPANKACE/status/745810552316788736> 
Yep, fingers crossed we should be back on in about 10 minutes or so.
