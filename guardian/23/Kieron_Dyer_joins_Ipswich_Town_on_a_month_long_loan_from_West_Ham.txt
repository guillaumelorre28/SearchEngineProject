Avram Grant has claimed that Kieron Dyer's days at West Ham United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> are not numbered despite 
the injury-prone forward being loaned to Ipswich Town.

"He is a very good player," West Ham's manager said. "He hasn't played the 
last month because he was injured so I think he needs to play now. He has gone 
to Ipswich [where] everyone knows him there and he will play one month and 
hopefully he will come back fit for us.

"If he was fit he would've played like he did at the start of the season and 
find a place in the team. But unfortunately he had these injuries – he tried 
hard in the training so it's important for him to play for one month."

Yet Dyer, who began his career at Ipswich, appears a candidate to leave at the 
end of the season after a blighted four years at West Ham that have featured 
only 15 league starts. In February David Sullivan, the co-owner, apparently 
referred to Dyer when he said: "There is one player who hardly plays at all who 
might have to accept retirement [who earns] £60-70,000 a week."

Dyer trained with his new team-mates on Friday morning and could go straight 
into the Ipswich squad to face Leeds United on Saturday.
