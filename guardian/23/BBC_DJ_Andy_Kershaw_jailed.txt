BBC radio DJ Andy Kershaw <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-kershaw> was 
today jailed for three months for breaching a restraining order issued to keep 
him away from his former partner.

The former Radio 1 presenter was sentenced this morning at Isle of Man courts 
of justice after approaching Juliette Banner, the mother of his two children, 
in August and again in November.

Kershaw was initially given a three-month suspended jail term in October and 
ordered to stay away from Banner and her new partner, Jim Imrie.

In October Kershaw, who last presented his Radio 3 world music programme in 
spring 2007, also admitted to drink driving and was banned from driving for 16 
months.

Judge Michael Moyle warned Kershaw that he could face a jail sentence at his 
last hearing on December 11 at the High Bailiff's Court in Douglas.

At the hearing, the court was told that Kershaw had also sent unpleasant text 
messages about Banner and Imrie to his children.

Kershaw and Banner moved to the Isle of Man with their children in April 2006. 
They subsequently separated and Banner subsequently went to live with her new 
partner.

It is unclear whether Kershaw will return to his Radio 3 show, which he has 
hosted since 2001.

A BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> spokesperson said: "We have 
always said that this is a private matter.

"Andy has not been on air since Spring 2007. He is currently not under 
contract with the BBC."
