 and Supergirl. Matthew Robinson, who co-wrote and co-directedThe Invention of 
Lying

with Ricky Gervais, is writing the script.

Little Shop of Horrors originated as a low-budget 1960 comedy-horror film 
directed by Roger Corman, featuring a dorky flower-shop assistant who lavishes 
his affection on a flesh-craving plant called Audrey. It is chiefly remembered 
for an early role for Jack Nicholson as a dentist’s patient – and for the fact 
that the entire film was supposedly shot in 36 hours.

Alan Menken and Howard Ashman turned Little Shop into a successful 
off-Broadway musical in 1982, which was adapted into theFrank Oz-directed 1986 
film

, featuring Rick Moranis and Steve Martin, with Bill Murray in the role earlier 
played by Nicholson. It is thought that the new version will also be a musical, 
but there is no word on whether any of the Menken/Ashman songs will be retained.
