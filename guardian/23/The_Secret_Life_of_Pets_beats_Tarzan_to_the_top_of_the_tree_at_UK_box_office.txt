The winner: The Secret Life of Pets

With back-to-back declines of just 20% and 24%, The Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
 has held up remarkably well, reaching £22.3m after 19 days. It will soon 
overtakeZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
 (£23.8m) to become the biggest animated film of the year so far – a title it 
may concede to Pixar’sFinding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/finding-dory-review-nemo-sequel-disability-ellen-de-generes>
 after it opens at the end of the month.

Pets grossed £3.62m over the three-day weekend period, shrugging off the 
challenge of an Andy Murray Wimbledon final. This year, onlyThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review> has taken 
more in its third frame. A year ago,Minions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
 stood at £27.6m at the same stage of its run, on its way to a total of £47.8m. 
If Pets maintains a similar decay rate, it would reach an impressive £38.6m.

Second place: The Legend of Tarzan

The Legend of Tarzan: ‘It’s an adventure movie, it’s not there to educate’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/07/legend-of-tarzan-video-cast-crew-interview-video>
Swinging into second place with £2.76m plus £809,000 in previews, The Legend 
of Tarzan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/legend-tarzan-review-alexander-skarsgard-christoph-waltz>
 has delivered solid numbers. Following a lengthy development process, Harry 
Potter director David Yates was attached in 2012. Budget wrangling delayed 
filming until June 2014, filming wrapped in October that year, before a lengthy 
post-production period. Its production budget is a reported $180m, suggesting 
that Warners probably had higher box-office aspirations for the film when it 
was greenlit. However, Tarzan is a well known character across multiple 
territories, and it’s too soon to be projecting the final profitability on the 
film.

Battle for third: Now You See Me 2 v Absolutely Fabulous

Now You See Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/now-you-see-me-2-film-review-daniel-radcliffe-woody-harrelson-jesse-eisenberg-dave-franco-mark-ruffalo>
 has earned third place with box office of £2.96m. However, the film landed in 
cinemas last Monday, giving it four extra days of play that have been added 
into that total. Strip out the previews, and the illusionist caper’s weekend 
number drops to £1.6m. In other words, third place really belongs toAbsolutely 
Fabulous: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
, which posted weekend takings of £2.32m.

<http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DInqU8CLwbPg&media=>
The original Now You See Me began its run in July 2013 with £2.9m, including 
previews of £1.1m. It went on to enjoy warm word of mouth, eventually reaching 
£11.21m.

Absolutely Fabulous’s second weekend decline is an OK 43%. Distributor Fox 
will take particular heart from the midweek result last week. The film debuted 
with £4.04m, and took £2.32m in the second session. With a total of £9.78m so 
far, that means it grossed a robust £3.42m during Monday-to-Thursday last week.

The Bollywood hit: Sultan

Pinterest  
<http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwPxqcq6Byq0&media=>
With £1.05m, including previews of £445,000, Sultan 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832640/> is the biggest Bollywood hit of the year 
so far. Written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar (Gunday), it’s the story of a 
fictional mixed martial arts star played bySalman Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/salman-khan> (Dabangg). Khan’s last movie, 
Prem Ratan Dhan Pavo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/16/prem-ratan-dhan-payo-review-salman-khan-sensitive-side-on-show>
, kicked off last November with £912,000 including previews of £187,000. 
Stripping out the previews numbers, Sultan’s debut falls short of that result. 
Khan also starred last year inBajrangi Bhaijaan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie>
, which began with £758,000 and no previews.


With Central Intelligence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/central-intelligence-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart>
 one place above Sultan in the chart, that means six movies grossed £1m or 
more, which has happened only three times this year.

Indie alternatives: The Neon Demon and Maggie’s Plan

Many indie cinemas have turned to mainstream fare such as Absolutely Fabulous 
to keep the tills ringing this summer, and arthouse hits have been thin on the 
ground. The last one to open above £100,000 was Whit Stillman’sLove & Friendship
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/love-friendship-review-whit-stillmans-austen-drama-is-a-racy-delight>
, which landed in May. The weekend saw two new contenders arrive: Nicolas 
Winding Refn’sThe Neon Demon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/neon-demon-review-film-nicolas-winding-refn-elle-fanning-fashion-horror>
 and Rebecca Miller’sMaggie’s Plan

Nicolas Winding Refn on The Neon Demon: video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/01/nicolas-winding-refn-neon-demon-video-interview>
The Neon Demon debuted with £127,000 from 120 venues, including previews of 
£9,400. For comparison, Refn’s last movieOnly God Forgives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/only-god-forgives-review> kicked 
off with £466,000, including £10,500 in previews, from 188 cinemas. Site 
average was £2,478, compared with £1,058 this time around. Only God Forgives 
had the benefit of Ryan Gosling in the starring role, plus the box-office 
bounce provided by Refn’s previous film,Drive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/drive>. The Neon Demon, starring Elle 
Fanning, enjoys an IMDb user rating of 7.0/10 and a MetaCritic score of 51/100.

Maggie’s Plan landed behind The Neon Demon, with £103,000 (including previews 
of £3,700) from 80 cinemas. Given the tighter rollout, its site average of 
£1,282 is a bit healthier. Director Miller’s previous filmThe Private Lives of 
Pippa Lee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/10/private-lives-of-pippa-lee-film-review>
 debuted on just 25 screens, grossing £44,500 on its way to a total of just 
under £200,000. Before that,The Ballad of Jack and Rose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/31/13> was even smaller, grossing 
£23,000 in total.

Both The Neon Demon <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-neon-demon> and 
Maggie’s Plan saw takings dip significantly on Sunday, suggesting they were hit 
by the finals of Wimbledon and Euro 2016. That pattern was witnessed by all 
films with an adult audience skew.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/sep/16/the-hard-stop-trailer-documentary-mark-duggan-police-2011-riots-video>
Takings are overall 6% up on last weekend, and an encouraging 21% up on the 
equivalent session from 2015, whenTed 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/ted-2-review-mark-wahlberg-seth-macfarlane>

 – is already in cinemas, since Sony opted to push it out on Monday. It will be 
joined on Friday by Ice Age: Collision Course. Hard to predict, for the UK, is 
action comedyKeanu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/13/keanu-review-key-and-peele-disappoint-sxsw>
, from Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele – the film has already grossed more

French lesbian romanceSummertime 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4080768/?ref_=nv_sr_1>, Danish comedy Men and 
Chicken <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3877674/> and British documentary The Hard

Dakota Fanning stars in The Neon Demon. Its star is Elle Fanning. We also said 
The Neon Demon debuted at 80 cinemas, in fact it opened in 120. These errors
