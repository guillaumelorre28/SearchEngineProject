European shares put in downbeat performance

In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on 
concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi’s fundraising was in trouble, 
helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly 
dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to 
just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so 
far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 
12% 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 
points at 19,961.

On that note it’s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on 
Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in 
Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as 
Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has 
fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable 
reasons, no one wants to be first ‘over the top’ should the crisis worsen.

Italy’s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, 
paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the 
Italian government taking the tough decisions.

Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would 
have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about 
European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at 
€10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern 
European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, 
although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on.

Here’s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-montepaschi-offe-idUSKBN14A1NV?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29>
:

Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an 
anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less 
than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on 
Wednesday.

The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this 
month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in 
this week to bail it out.

The Tuscan lender, Italy’s third biggest bank and the world’s oldest, had 
pinned its hopes on Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in 
its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said.

As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on 
Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, 
they added.

The bank declined to comment.

Monte de Paschi woes continue

Over in Italy, the rescue package for struggling bank Monte dei Paschi is 
looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer:
Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) 
MONTE DEI PASCHI SHARE PLACEMENT HAS DRAWN LITTLE INVESTOR INTEREST BECAUSE NO 
ANCHOR INVESTOR HAS BEEN FOUND - SOURCES - Reuters News
 <https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/811592794234122240> December 21, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/811592794234122240> 
Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could 
find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the 
bill but investors are left untouched.

Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there 
was some caution over the future outlook.Dennis de Jong, managing director at 
UFX.com, said:

European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the 
Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post 
the year’s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in 
negative territory.

While today’s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer 
may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations 
begin in earnest next year.

Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe’s economy through choppy 
waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real 
challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017.

Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said:

An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose 
for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, 
consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. 
Consumers across theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> 
are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably 
including higher employment and still limited inflation.

This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...

While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the 
marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved 
perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job 
concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November 
(following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data 
showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and 
September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the 
summer.

Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence – particularly a decent 
increase – is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone 
growth prospects...

However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and 
economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over 
employment during 2017.

Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be 
pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, 
especially given that the UK’s Brexit vote in June and November’s election of 
Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in 
the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), 
France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur 
in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform.

Eurozone consumer confidence rises to 20 month high

Eurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> consumer confidence 
has improved so far in December.

The provisional reading for the month  
<http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/index_en.htm>from 
the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to 
expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said:

In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator 
increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 
1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November.

On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association’s chief economist, said the 
last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said:

The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of 
some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their 
historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. 
Furthermore, it’s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast — where 
price growth has been tame all year — had the most success last month.

Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now 
even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a 
result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of 
the country.

US home sales at near 10 year high

US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest 
level in nearly ten years.

Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, 
according to the National Association of Realtors. 
<https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2016/12/existing-home-sales-forge-ahead-in-november>
 Analysts had been expecting a fall from October’s figure of 5.57m units - 
itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m.

from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least.

Dow edges closer to 20,000 as Wall Street opens

After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, 
edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain 
in early trading.

The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&P 500 opened down 
just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%.

In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on 
concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi’s fundraising was in trouble, 
helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly 
dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to 
just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so 
far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 
12% 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 
points at 19,961.

On that note it’s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on 
Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in 
Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as 
Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has 
fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable 
reasons, no one wants to be first ‘over the top’ should the crisis worsen.

Italy’s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, 
paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the 
Italian government taking the tough decisions.

Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would 
have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about 
European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at 
€10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern 
European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, 
although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on.
 
Here’s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-montepaschi-offe-idUSKBN14A1NV?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29>
:

Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an 
anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less 
than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on 
Wednesday.

The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this 
month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in 
this week to bail it out.

The Tuscan lender, Italy’s third biggest bank and the world’s oldest, had 
pinned its hopes on Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in 
its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said.

As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on 
Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, 
they added.

The bank declined to comment.

looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer:

Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could 
find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the 
bill but investors are left untouched.

Oil prices have slipped slightly as the latest US figures show an unexpected 
rise in crude stocks.

West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.15% lower at $53.22 a barrel 
while Brent crude is down 0.38% to $55.14.
 
US crude stocks have defied expectations with a hefty jump last week.

They rose by nearly 2.3m barrels, according to the Energy Information 
Administration, compared to forecasts of a fall of around 2.5m barrels.

Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there 
was some caution over the future outlook.Dennis de Jong, managing director at 
UFX.com, said:

European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the 
Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post 
the year’s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in 
negative territory.

While today’s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer 
may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations 
begin in earnest next year.

Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe’s economy through choppy 
waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real 
challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017.

Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said:

An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose 
for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, 
consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. 
Consumers across theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> 
are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably 
including higher employment and still limited inflation.

This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...

While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the 
marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved 
perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job 
concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November 
(following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data 
showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and 
September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the 
summer.

Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence – particularly a decent 
increase – is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone 
growth prospects...

However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and 
economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over 
employment during 2017.

Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be 
pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, 
especially given that the UK’s Brexit vote in June and November’s election of 
Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in 
the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), 
France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur 
in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform.
 
Eurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> consumer confidence 
has improved so far in December.

The provisional reading for the month  
<http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/index_en.htm>from 
the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to 
expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said:

In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator 
increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 
1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November.
 
On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association’s chief economist, said the 
last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said:

The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of 
some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their 
historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. 
Furthermore, it’s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast — where 
price growth has been tame all year — had the most success last month.

Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now 
even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a 
result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of 
the country.
 
US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest 
level in nearly ten years.

Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, 
according to the National Association of Realtors. 
<https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2016/12/existing-home-sales-forge-ahead-in-november>
 Analysts had been expecting a fall from October’s figure of 5.57m units - 
itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m.
 
Well that didn’t last. The Dow is now down 14 points as investors shy away 
from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least.
 
After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, 
edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain 
in early trading.

The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&P 500 opened down 
just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%.
