Comments

213 entries, no noticeable mistakes. Favourite clue, of 19 nominated at least 
once, was (just) 'Badly nagged by Church? It's almost sure to be a cracking 
measure!' for EGG DANCE, with 6 votes, with five others (to ADAMIC, INTAKES, 
LIP-SYNC, LOIR and TWIG) one vote behind. I do apologize for the late 
announcement of the last two competition results. With three comps in quick 
succession this is always a busy time for me, and our holiday in India merely 
added to the pressure. Things should return to normal for the time being from 
February, barring the unforeseen.

SAYONARA proved unexpectedly awkward to clue effectively, making the judging 
process correspondingly difficult, and there was much unsoundness from less 
experienced solvers. This included the frequent use of 'back' to indicate 
reversal, which I've always found unacceptable in a down word. ('Back up' would 
be all right.) Several of you asked concernedly whether the choice of clue word 
was my way of announcing in advance the ending of the Azed series, in the same 
way that Araucaria warned his many solvers of his last illness by inserting a 
number of thematic words in one of his Guardian puzzles. I'm happy to dispel 
any such fears. I am as healthy as increasing age permits and have no plans to 
stop setting as long as I remain so. And on the subject of Araucaria, more than 
a few clues submitted were on the lines of 'Valedictory extract from essay on 
Araucaria', a nice tribute but, alas, just too popular to gain higher than HC 
placing in the lists.

More cricketing references, I'm afraid, with 'bye' invitingly possible as a 
definition for SAYONARA. And the arrival on the test-match scene of Ben Stokes 
makes the abbreviation S for 'stokes' (in what sense I know not) more 
attractive than hitherto. I certainly cannot declare a moratorium on such 
usage, beyond the general warning that clues with a cricketing theme in their 
surface reading are not an automatic guarantee of preference in the eyes of the 
judge!
