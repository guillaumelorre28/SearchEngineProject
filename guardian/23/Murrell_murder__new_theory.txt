West Mercia police are believed to be considering the possibility that Miss 
Hilda Murrell , the 78-year-old anti-nuclear campaigner who died last year, was 
murdered by a private detective acting for M15 or another security service. 
Miss Murrell's body was found six miles from her home in Shropshire. She had 
been punched and stabbed and left to die of exposure.

It is known that private investigators, some of who have been contacted by 
Special branch officers from the West Mercia force, work from time to time for 
the security service. It is also known that private detective were 
investigating objectors to plans to build a pressurised water nuclear reactor 
(PWR) - in which a number of companies, British and American, have a stake - at 
Sizewell, Suffolk at the time Miss Murrell died in March, 1984.

The Sunday Telegraph yesterday reported one private detective who had been 
interviewed by special branch officers as saying that 'something went badly 
wrong and it involved officialdom.' It was suggested yesterday that West Mercia 
police may have been prompted to renew its investigations by the independent 
inquiry into the murder now being undertaken by Mr Peter Smith, assistant chief 
constable of Northumbria police.

Mr Peter Hamilton, former military intelligence officer who now runs Zeus 
Security Consultants, has said that he had been asked secretly to investigate 
Sizewell objectors for a 'private client.'
