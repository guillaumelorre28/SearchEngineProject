The former snooker world champion Alex Higgins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alex-higgins> has been admitted to hospital. 
Higgins has fought a long battle with throat cancer but his condition is 
understood to be comfortable.

The 61-year-old from Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, known as the Hurricane by his 
fans, has suffered declining health in recent years. He is in the Belfast City 
Hospital after being admitted yesterday. A hospital spokesman said: "We will be 
making no comment on Mr Higgins's condition."

Friends and family have feared for the controversial Belfast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> player since he was diagnosed with 
throat cancer over 10 years ago. He is in remission but its toll on his body is 
evident in his drawn and thin appearance.

Living in sheltered housing on the Donegall Road in Belfast, Higgins is 
considered to be one of the finest snooker players of all time. He has had 
long-term problems with alcohol and smoking since winning the world title in 
1972 and 1982.

Despite his numerous fights and rows with referees over the years, he still 
plays the game and appeared at the Irish Professional Championship in 2005 and 
2006. Higgins has been an inspiration for many of today's best players, 
including Ken Doherty, Jimmy White and Ronnie O'Sullivan.
