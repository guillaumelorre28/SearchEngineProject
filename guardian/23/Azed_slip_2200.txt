Comments
191 entries, no mistakes. Favourite clue, of 17 mentioned in despatches: 'To 
the French about to pass on … this may be appropriate' (ADIEU), with 'What AZ 
has to go through and measure efforts' (ENTRIES) in second place. Some way 
further back, with four points, was 'Fancily trimmed hosiery will include it?' 
for SHORTIE, which I mention because it also received one 'anti' vote for 
failing to include an adequate definition. Well, perhaps. That question mark 
was certainly required.

A good competition, in general. Compound anagrams were especially popular, 
with, exceptionally, all three prizewinning clues opting for this approach. I 
hope those of you who are still unconvinced about the device will concede that 
these examples demonstrate how effective it can be when cleverly handled. 
BRINDISI, though now an Italian word, is in fact, I discover, derived from the 
German phrase '(Ich) bring dir's', meaning '(I) offer it to you' as the 
introduction to a toast, and unrelated etymologically to the name of the 
Italian port, from Latin Brundisium. Of several operatic instances of the 
brindisi, the best known is probably 'Libiamo' in Verdi's La Traviata (see 
TJM's clue above), but such drinking-songs also feature in Verdi's Otello, 
Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, and The Sorcerer 
by G & S ('The tea-cup brindisi'), among others.

I have just acquired a copy of the new (13th) edition of The Chambers 
Dictionary. Not much has changed. The publishers claim over 1,000 new words and 
meanings. 'The Word Lover's Miscellany', which I never cared for, has been 
replaced by 'The Word Lover's Ramble', now located after the appendices at the 
end (unchanged but for the welcome reinstatement of 'Some first names' from 
previous editions). Another improvement is the scrapping of the gimmicky 
highlighting of 'unusual words' in the text, but this has led to the loss of 
these words altogether, an editorial blunder which I am assured will be 
corrected at the first opportunity. I plan to start recommending the new 
edition from the start of 2015. This may annoy those who have only just bought 
and got used to the 12th edition, but I really have no choice. The published 
price is £39.99, ISBN 978-1-4736-0225-0. A nice Christmas present, perhaps.
