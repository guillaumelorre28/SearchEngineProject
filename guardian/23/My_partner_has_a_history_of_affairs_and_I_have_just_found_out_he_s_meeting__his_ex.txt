I have been with my partner in a long-distance relationship for two years. We 
met at a festival – later, I discovered he was in a relationship with someone 
else at the time. My partner is 65 and has history of extramarital affairs. By 
accident, I have just discovered he is planning to meet an ex and is taking her 
for an expensive meal. When I expressed my discomfort – in that he hadn’t told 
me they were meeting – he claimed he knew I would be upset and that I need to 
trust him because he loves me. I really don’t want to be jealous, but I am so 
cross he didn’t tell me. Both he and his ex have a history of having affairs.
