Coneygree will miss this year’s Cheltenham Gold Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenham-gold-cup> as he continues to 
recover from a setback.

The now 10-year-old, winner of the 2015 renewal as a novice but ruled out of 
last year’s running, also missed the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day and has 
been restricted to one outing this campaign, when chasing home Cue Card in the 
Betfair Chase at Haydock in November.

Sara Bradstock, assistant and wife of the trainer Mark, said: “I’m afraid it’s 
[Gold Cup] not going to happen, which is a real shame. When you have a horse 
like this you must not take any risks and there is no point going there 
half-baked. He has just niggled the bone, where the cannon bone meets the knee. 
He is still walking at the moment, but we must not take a risk as these 
niggling things can turn into fractures.

“We will not rush him and we will make sure he is fine before he comes back. 
He will do plenty of swimming and other stuff. Hopefully he will go to 
Punchestown and win the Irish equivalent.”

She added: “We might just give him a change of scenery and run him in the 
French Champion Hurdle, which is over three miles and is usually run on soft 
ground. He might possibly make Aintree.

“I think we ran him on ground we had not trained him on at Haydock, as it had 
only rained those two days there and there had been no soft ground to train him 
on. He ran a great race at Haydock, but he might have been feeling this coming 
on. He has no miles on the clock and I’m hoping he can become a veteran 
record-breaker and a novice record-breaker. He is in very good nick mentally, 
and is full of himself.”
