The BBC Radio 3 presenter Andy Kershaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-kershaw> has been jailed for three 
months after breaching a restraining order involving his former partner, the 
mother of his two children. The 48-year-old pleaded guilty to the offence at 
the high bailiff's court in Douglas, on the Isle of Man.

The breach of the order, which bans him from contacting Juliette Banner, took 
place in November. Passing sentence, high bailiff Michael Moyle said Kershaw 
seemed "hell-bent" on destroying himself.

At a hearing in December, the court heard Kershaw was menacing and provocative 
as he walked up to Banner and her partner, Jim Imrie, as they went for a 
coffee. He glared at them before circling them and walking "in front of them 
backwards". He admitted sending abusive text messages aimed at the couple to 
his two children, Sonny, 10, and Dolly, eight.

Kershaw also admitted being drunk and disorderly outside Peel police station 
on November 7, when he swore at officers.

Earlier, Nigel Cordwell, defending, said Kershaw would accept any decision to 
imprison him stoically: "It is devastating to Mr Kershaw that he finds himself 
in this humiliating situation."

Kershaw is currently on sabbatical from the show he presents on BBC Radio 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-3>. The BBC said: "It is a private 
matter ... He is currently not under contract with the BBC so we have nothing 
further to add."
