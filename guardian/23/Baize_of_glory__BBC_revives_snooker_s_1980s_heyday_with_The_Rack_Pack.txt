‘I’m exactly what the game needs – I’m an entertainer …’

A new film revives the 1980s rivalry between Alex “Hurricane” Higgins (Luke 
Treadaway) and Steve “The Nugget” Davis (Will Merrick), two very different 
personalities who helped popularise the sport on TV. In 1985, the world snooker 
final was watched by 18.5 million people, still a record for a post-midnight 
audience in the UK.

Debuting on BBC iPlayer, The Rack Pack 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02ddr5f> is directed by Brian Welsh (Glasgow 
Girls, Black Mirror), written by Shaun Pye, Mark Chappell and Alan Connor, the 
team behind A Young Doctor’s Notebook. Nichola Burley plays Alex’s wife Lynn 
Higgins, with James Bailey as Jimmy White and Kevin Bishop as Davis’s manager 
Barry Hearn.
