France <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> has been stunned and 
sickened by a third massacre in 18 months in which a truck driver mowed down 
night-time crowds celebrating Bastille Day on the seafront in Nice. He killed 
at least 84 people and injured scores more, many of them small children.

The armed man, believed to be a 31-year-old French Tunisian who lived locally, 
zigzagged the vehicle at high speeds for more than a mile along a beachfront 
esplanade, instantly turning a festival atmosphere of fireworks and families 
into carnage. Police shot him dead inside the truck’s cabin.

The atrocity was the third major attack to hit the country since the start of 
last year, followingthe Charlie Hebdo killings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack> and the massacre of 
130 people in Paris <https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks> in 
November.

The French president, François Hollande, extended a nine-month state of 
emergency for another three months, declared three days of national mourning 
starting on Saturday and then flew to the scene of the outrage.

“We we are facing a long battle because we have an enemy who will continue to 
hate all the people who enjoy liberty,” he said after visiting the bedside of 
survivors. In all, 202 people were injured in the attack, with 25 still on life 
support and 52 in critical condition.

“The whole of France is facing the threat of Islamist terrorism,” said the 
president, who is coming under increasing pressure to take more decisive action 
to defend France from its gravest security crisis since 1945.

Condolences poured in from around the world and officials in London and 
Washington said leaders were being briefed on the situation. Solidarity rallies 
were announced in at least a dozen French towns and cities for the weekend.

Investigators began searching a local apartment after finding identity papers 
in the truck cabin belonging to a French-Tunisian man named locally as Mohamed 
Lahouaiej-Bouhlel. Locals said he did not appear particularly religious.

Reports said the attacker was known to police for lower-level crimes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/bastille-day-truck-driver-was-known-to-police-reports-say>
, such as theft and violence, but had not been put on a watchlist by French 
intelligence services.

The Paris prosecutor’s office opened an investigation for “murder and 
attempted murder in an organised group linked to a terrorist enterprise”. 
Despite the early judgment that this was a terrorist attack, no group had 
claimed it.

Two grim details stood out from Thursday night’s events. First, the use of a 
truck 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/france-attack-use-of-truck-demonstrates-evolving-nature-of-threat>
 is rare among the many massacres perpetrated against western civilians over 
the past 10 years.

Second, the number of small children killed and injured was higher than in any 
other European massacre of recent years. At least 10 are thought to have died, 
and medical sources said another 50 had been taken to hospital overnight, many 
with life-threatening injuries.

Also among the victims were at least three Germans, two Americans and one 
Russian national.

The horror began shortly before 11pm when the truck somehow gained access to 
the Promenade des Anglais and began slewing into bystanders and revellers. 
Officials said the driver wove along the road, knocking people down “like 
skittles”, for a distance of at least 2km.

Bastille Day attack: armed French police shoot at lorry driver – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/15/bastille-day-attack-armed-french-police-shoot-at-lorry-driver-video>
Video footage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/15/bastille-day-truck-attack-driver-crashes-into-crowd-in-nice-video>
 showed the 19-tonne white truck speeding up as it drove into the screaming 
crowds while several people tried to chase it on foot.

Witnesses said people pushed each other out of the way, jumped down to the 
beach and even ran into the sea to avoid the vehicle.


Jaqueline Lacour and her companion George Pellet were sitting on their 
beachfront balcony watching the fireworks when chaos broke out.

“We were about to put away our camera when we saw a huge white truck plough 
into the crowd,” she said. “We could hear the awful thump every time a body hit 
the front of the vehicle. One man right in front of us was literally thrown 
into the air. He lay dead for ages. People were screaming. A group of teenagers 
were trying to hide on the beach.

“A man stayed next to a body for what seemed to be hours, he kept screaming: 
‘Help me, help me!’ It must have been one of his family members.”

A local official said that the truck was only brought to a stop by the heroics 
of a person who tried to jump on to its front. The attacker then opened fire 
before police killed him with a volley of shots through the windscreen.

As investigators continued to comb the vehicle, questions were being asked as 
to how the truck managed to get down to the waterfront. The city centre has 
restrictions on heavy lorries, and there were additional security restrictions 
for the festival including metal barriers that he apparently opened.

Bastille Day attack witness: ‘It was a harrowing scene’

Maryam Violet, an Iranian journalist on holiday in the Mediterranean city, 
told the Guardian she had seen the truck running over people as they walked in 
the pedestrian area minutes after the fireworks finished. “Everyone was 
completely shocked. I saw that suddenly people were fleeing and shouting,” she 
said.

“People were shouting, ‘It’s a terrorist attack, it’s a terrorist attack.’ It 
was clear that the driver was doing it deliberately,” she said. “I was walking 
for nearly a mile and there were dead bodies all over the place.

François Hollande on the truck attack: ‘Once more horror has struck France’ –

“I saw two sisters and one brother from Poland that were mourning the death of 
their two other siblings. There were so many Muslim people who were victims 
because I could see they had scarves over their head and some were speaking 
Arabic.”

A spokesman for the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she was being 
kept up to date on events, adding: “Our thoughts are with all those affected by 
this terrible incident on what was a day of national celebration.”


The White House said Barack Obama was being kept updated. The president 
condemned “what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice” and said he 
had directed his team to offer any assistance France might need in its 
investigation.

Nice terror attack is a crisis for presidency of François Hollande

But domestically, Hollande came under pressure to do more to shore up 
security. Marine Le Pen, the Front National leader and a rival for next year’s 
presidential election, called for a “war on Islamic fundamentalism” saying that 
all that had happened so far was a “war on words”.

“Nothing that we have proposed has been put in place. Considering the new 
nature of terrorism which is now a terrorism of opportunity, that’s to say 
without hierarchical structure, the urgency is to attack the ideology on which 
this terrorism is based.”

Alain Juppé, a centre-right presidential hopeful, said: “We know there are 
faults and shortcomings - the parliamentary inquiry after the November attacks 
showed us that. We must absolutely lead this struggle against radicalisation 
and better coordinate our intelligence services.”
Recent attacks

On Friday morning, the picturesque resort was all but deserted, beaches empty, 
cafés deserted, the esplanade cordoned off and the white goods truck visible 
from a distance, its windscreen pockmarked with bullet holes and its front 
buckled.


On the street, Piero Bianculli, 37, an Italian musician who grew up in Nice, 
said he had been at his stepfather’s apartment on the beachfront watching the 
firework display from the balcony when the lorry hit.


“We had been invited over to watch the fireworks because he had such a 
beautiful view of the sea,” Bianculli said. “Suddenly we saw people in the 
street running and screaming. We thought it was a false alarm or some sort of 
joke, but when I looked to the right I saw bodies flying in the air, and people 
thrown to the ground who didn’t get up.


“I took my binoculars and looked all the way up the promenade, and saw dead 
bodies lying scattered where they had fallen, bleeding. There was blood 
streaming across the street.”


Others who had witnessed the attack were seen wrapped in blankets, shaking 
their heads and crying. Restaurant owners on the beachfront described 
sheltering panicked crowds.


A man in a white blanket, haggard and dazed, limped down the street as 
neighbours tried to hold him up.

“He’s lost his whole family,” said a woman, crying behind her sunglasses.
