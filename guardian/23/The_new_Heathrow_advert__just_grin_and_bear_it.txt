Airports don’t need to advertise, because people literally have to visit them. 
You don’t book a trip to Skiathos because you fancy a steak at Café Rouge or a 
dump in a windowless loo. The people in Heathrow’s needless marketing 
department don’t seem to realise this though, so, erm, here’s a cuddly ad to 
entice you to swing by this Yuletide.

Two little bears arrive at Heathrow and move seamlessly through an eerily 
quiet airport, suggesting it may have been evacuated due to some terrifying 
threat, like, say, a sentient teddy wandering about in a flat cap. Then, just 
as they’re spotted at the Arrivals gate by some children, they morph into 
elderly humans.

Why they were bears in the first place is unclear. The target audience is 
unclear (sociopaths who wouldn’t otherwise bother seeing their families, but 
for the couple of quid they can save on gin and Toblerones?). Why all involved 
haven’t sat around trying to fart the Magic Roundabout theme instead of making 
this ad is unclear. The only thing that is clear is that using bears to 
advertise a transport terminus only makes you think of one place: Paddington.
