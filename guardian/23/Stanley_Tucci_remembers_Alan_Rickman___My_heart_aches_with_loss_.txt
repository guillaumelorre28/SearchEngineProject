The actor Stanley Tucci, who made a memorable supporting performance in Alan 
Rickman’s final film behind the camera, has paid tribute to “a wonderful actor 
and director”. Tucci also called Rickman,who died on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-giant-of-british-film-and-theatre-dies-at-69>
, “most importantly, behind his wry imperiousness, one of the kindest people 
and one of the most generous friends I have had the great fortune to know”.

Tucci played the flamboyant Duke of Orléans in last year’s period romance A 
Little Chaos <https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-little-chaos>, in which 
Rickman also featured as Louis XIV. They also co-starred in 2012s Gambit. But 
the pair had been friends since 2010, after meeting in a New York bar when both 
were directing plays on Broadway.

“After that night we seemed effortlessly to become part of each other’s 
lives,” Tucci told the Guardian. “I had begun to work a lot in London and would 
see him and Rima [Horton, Rickman’s partner] whenever I could. We went to the 
theatre together and shared many, many wonderful meals, as good food and drink 
were a common passion.”

Tucci remembered the couple coming to stay with him and his family in America; 
Rickman’s “imminent arrival throwing my three children into paroxysms of 
excitement and fear asHarry Potter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter> was basically the only thing on 
their minds in those days.

“My youngest, who about nine at the time, had invited her best friend to sleep 
over and their anticipation of meeting Severus Snape was nothing short of 
hysterical. When he finally did arrive he greeted them as graciously as he 
greeted everyone and then bent slightly at the waist so that he was just on the 
cusp of looming over them, lowered his eyelids slightly and asked them in that 
distinctive and profoundly sonorous voice: ‘Are you Harry Potter fans?’ 
Needless to say we almost had to take the poor things to the hospital.”

“How happy my family and I are to have had him in our lives for even a short 
period of time,” said Tucci. “My heart aches with loss.”
