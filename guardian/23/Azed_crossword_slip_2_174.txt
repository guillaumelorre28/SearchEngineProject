Comments

Despite a very warm welcome for the return of an old favourite, the entry was 
disappointingly low: only 173. Perhaps the appalling weather and widespread 
flooding had something to do with it. There were few mistakes, mostly NALLA for 
NABLA, and your favourite clue, of 18 nominated at least once, was 'He likes to 
think he's a good saxophonist but he isn't' for OBECHE, three votes ahead of 
'After a rough voyage there's many a bonking in the quayside inn!' (SUNDRI).

I must apologize straight away for ALKALIN, which is certainly not in 
Chambers, and is only justifiable as a bona fide word from its appearance in 
the OED as an obsolete 17th-century alternative spelling, and from the fact 
that, according to the Internet, it is an acceptable word in ®Scrabble – I've 
no idea why. I think I simply misread ALKALIS in Chambers Words, and naturally 
never had reason to check the dictionary entry thereafter. I'm so sorry for the 
trouble caused. No one got it wrong.

I was asked by more than one competitor whether I adopt a special approach to 
the construction of a PD grid that differs from that for a normal Plain. Not 
really, except that as each word goes in I have to be sure that it will be 
susceptible to devilry. (I don't as a rule plan the clue as a whole at this 
stage, though a number of general treatments may spring to mind.) I simply 
can't afford to arrive at the cluing process for a word which proves totally 
unworkable in PD. I choose the clue word before cluing any of the rest, aiming 
to offer you a reasonable range of possible approaches. CHARET actually proved 
a little less friendly than I had hoped (and as you doubtless discovered), but 
it nevertheless yielded an impressive range of ideas. Part of the knack is, as 
I've said before, to produce wording that reads convincingly in both devilled 
and undevilled forms. If either is less convincing, it must always be the 
devilled form.

Thought is already being given to a get-together to mark Azed No. 2,500, which 
is due to appear in July 2015. In the past such gatherings have taken the form 
of a dinner (or more recently a lunch) at one of the colleges in Oxford. Could 
I invite realistic suggestions (included with competition entries or 
separately) as to how the format might be modified or added to, with a view 
possibly to encouraging newer solvers or those unfamiliar with Azed puzzles to 
come along. It would certainly be nice to swell the ranks of regulars.

And finally, Mr N. G. Shippobotham's VHC, omitted in error from the slip for 
No. 2,165, was '"Too rude" for this?' (anag. & lit.). Short and sweet.
