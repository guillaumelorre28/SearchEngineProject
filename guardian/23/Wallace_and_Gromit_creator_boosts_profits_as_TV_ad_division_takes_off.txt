<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wallace-and-gromit>, Shaun the Sheep 
and Morph boosted pre-tax profits by more than 60% to £3.3m last year, largely 
thanks to a boom at its TV commercial-making division.

Aardman Animations, which recently branched out into the US with the 
acquisition of animation firm Nathan Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/23/shaun-the-sheep-creator-takes-majority-stake-in-us-animators-nathan-love>
, also reported a healthy 26% surge in turnover to £23.5m.

The 40-year-old Bristol-based firm acknowledged the performance of its 
commercials division which achieved its highest level of turnover since 2010.

Aardman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> has made campaigns in the 
US and UK for clients including Npower and the government’s Change4Life 
anti-obesity drive.

The company’s directors, co-founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton, each 
received a dividend payment of £94,956.

One of the duo – the company filing does not specify which – also received 
£62,755 as the un-named highest paid company director.

Operationally, the film division, which delivered the Shaun the Sheep film 
which premiered in February, saw revenues rise 60% year-on-year to £7.7m.

Revenue from other activities, which includes making commercials and 
licensing, grew 26% to £23.5m.

Over 80% of the company’s turnover comes from the UK, up on 2013, with North 
America generating just 10% of the work.

The broadcast division delivered 15 new one-minute episodes of Morph on 
YouTube, following a successful funding campaign raising half the money using 
crowdfunding.

The company said that a small number of projects on the broadcast development 
slate were written off last year.

Staff costs grew from £8.5m to £10.3m as employee numbers swelled from 204 to 
246.

This was due to a big increase in “project-related freelancers” from 121 to 
158.

Net funds at 31 December were £8.2m.
