The actor Bill Nighy has said he is proud to have filled the role intended for 
Alan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-obituary> in his 
latest film, The Limehouse Golem.

Rickman, who died of pancreatic cancer in January aged 69, was to star in the 
adaptation of Peter Ackroyd’s novel but was forced to pull out because of his 
illness.

Nighy, 66, said he was a great admirer of Rickman. He took over the role of 
the police inspector John Kildare, who investigates a series of brutal killings 
in Victorian-era London.

He said: “I didn’t have any reservations. I was very proud to be considered in 
those terms. I knew Alan reasonably well and I was a great admirer, like 
everyone else who came into contact with him.

“At the time we didn’t really know how ill he was. Obviously it was a great 
loss to everybody.”

Nighy, who has starred in Love Actually 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/nov/21/comedy> and Pirates of the 
Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest, said he was a fan of blockbusters such as 
superhero movies but believed there was an increasing market for smaller films.

“I think the market will get bigger and bigger because of the way of the 
digital revolution, people are just going to need more stuff,” he said. “People 
will always want other kinds of stories. I like all those superhero movies. I 
like all those blockbusters, I’m for everything if it’s any good.”

Discussing the success of British actors in the film industry, Nighy said: “I 
don’t think it has much to do with where you come from, it’s just those are the 
breaks.

“There’s a tradition, there are precedents, because we’ve been making films 
for a long time and therefore younger people coming through see that 
possibility. But I think it’s happening all over.

“I don’t think anybody should be discriminated against depending on their 
background. I think everybody should have equal opportunities.”

The Limehouse Golem had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film 
Festival <https://www.theguardian.com/film/torontofilmfestival>, which runs 
until 18 September.
