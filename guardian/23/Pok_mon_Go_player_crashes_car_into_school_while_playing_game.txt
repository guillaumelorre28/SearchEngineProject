The 19-year-old will likely be charged in relation to careless driving, police 
say.


Government agency VicRoads introduced almost 40 flashing road signs warning 
drivers “Don’t drive and Pokémon” a few days ago.

Police have warned that chasing Pokémon creatures while driving could earn a 
$466 fine and four demerit points.

Those hunting on foot are also warned to be aware of vehicles and other 
pedestrians, during the search.

The game has been downloaded more than 50m times from the Google Play store 
and is top of the Australian charts for free iOS apps.
