West Ham United's manager, Avram Grant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/avram-grant>, has denied a charge of 
improper conduct over comments made about the referee Mike Jones following the 
FA Cup quarter-final defeat by Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on 13 March. 
A personal hearing will be scheduled at a date no later than 7 April.

After the 2-1 defeat Grant was unhappy with Jones's handling of the second 
half, which began with Stoke being awarded a penalty 13 seconds after the 
restart.

Matthew Etherington missed the spot-kick but Grant intimated he felt that 
Jones had been swayed by the home fans after Frédéric Piquionne appeared to 
handle in the lead-up to the Hammers' opener in the first half.

"I think maybe this is the reason the referee started the second half very 
strange," Grant said. "Until they scored [the second] goal he gave fouls, a 
penalty, everything for them. Maybe he felt a little bit guilty. I think it was 
the effect of the first goal for us."
