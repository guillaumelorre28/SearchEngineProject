Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> defender Ivan 
Franjic’s chances of playing in the Asian Cup final have improved with scans 
clearing him of any serious injury. The right-back underwent scans on Thursday, 
for what team hierarchy said was a hip-related problem.

Yet, despite being cleared of a serious issue, Franjic remains in a battle to 
prove his fitness for the decider against South Korea in Sydney on Saturday 
night.

He clutched at the left side of his groin when hurt during Tuesday night’s 
semi-final win against the United Arab Emirates in Newcastle.


Franjic has been a mainstay, one of few Socceroos to play every minute of 
every game in the tournament so far. He has provided consistent drive along the 
flank and, if ruled out of the final, presents coach Ange Postecoglou with a 
major problem.

The only other specialist right-back in the Australian squad, Aston Villa’s 
Chris Herd, has returned to England for treatment on his tournament-ending 
Achilles injury. One option could be to switch centre-back Trent Sainsbury to 
the flank, with Alex Wilkinson taking the central defensive post.

“It doesn’t bother me,” Sainsbury said. “They can put me in goal if they want 
to. I’m not fussed, I’ll go out there and do the job that I’m told. I have 
played there a few times ... I just have to adjust and do what the coach tells 
me.”
