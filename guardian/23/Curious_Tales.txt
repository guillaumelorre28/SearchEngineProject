Curious Tales is a label selling quirky designer clothing from recycled and 
organic materials. The label combines a love of storytelling, fashion and the 
environment: the clothes themselves have stories of what their previous owners 
might have been like stitched into the insides. Good fun, quirky, and highly 
original, their website is worth a look for any eco-conscious shopper.

The online shop stocks refashioned jackets, upcycled belts, recycled 
accessories, salvaged bags, and organic t-shirts for men and women.
