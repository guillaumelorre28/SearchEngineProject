I have discovered gardening as I approach 60. My patio has a shady wall that 
needs softening. Planting will be in pots, height up to 1.5m, and I’d like 
colour throughout the year.
When I recently took up bike polo, a younger team-mate told me, “I find it’s 
necessary to be realistic and not overambitious with new sports.” I was 
crestfallen, but he has a point. Be enthusiastic, but be realistic. Year-round 
colour in the shade is a big ask: instead of lamenting its lack, embrace a 
palette of subtle hues and wallow in the detail of variation and texture.

First, buy a Hydrangea anomala subsp petiolaris 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/397.shtml>, a 
self-clinging, climbing variety that grows fast and gives wonderful panicles of 
white flowers in summer. It’s easy to please, but give it a big pot, to ease 
watering. Camellias do well in pots, love shade and give much-needed early 
spring colour; the rest of the year, they are dull, but the glossy foliage is 
elegant; I like the single varieties of the autumn-floweringC. sasanqua 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sasanqua> and the hybrid C. x williamsii
 <http://www.trehane.co.uk/hybrid_camellia_s/1832.htm>, but there’s plenty of 
froth if that’s your thing.

Foxgloves are biennial, but self-sow and are always a delight. Hostas are 
lovely pot plants:‘Sum and Substance’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=975> is a giant, reaching 1m, 
and as near to slug-proof as possible.
