Cheltenham Festival: Day Three wrap

 On a fairly catastrophic days for the bookies in which three short-priced 
favourites were cheered into the winner’s enclosure, the Colin Tizzard-trained 
Thistlecrack won the feature World Hurdle doing handstands under Tom Scudamore.

 Ruby Walsh added another three winners to his CV to bring his tally for the 
week to seven and his career total to an astonishing 52. His big winner of the 
day was on board Vautour, a controversial winner of the Ryanair Chase, which he 
won at his leisure. Black Hercules had got Walsh off the mark in the JLT 
Novices’ Chase, while odds-on shot Limini obliged at her leisure in the 
inaugural runner of the Mares’ Hurdle.

 Davy Russell had a controversial start to the day, finding himself unseated 
at the start of the opener only for his luck to change when he took advantage 
of interference suffered by If In Doubt to win the Pertemps Final on board Mall 
Dini. Elsewhere, Bryan Cooper got the Gigginstown stud off the mark with his 
win in the Brown Advisory Plate, while Cause Of Cause and amateur rider Jamie 
Codd took the closing race, the Kim Muir.

Sadly, an otherwise good day for punters was marred by further tragedy when 
Niceonfrankie lost his life in the Brown Advisory Plate, becoming the fifth 
horse to die during the past three days of Festival racing. Join us tomorrow on 
Victoria Pendleton Day, where racecourse officials may also find time to run 
the Gold Cup.

On a St Patrick’s Day when Irish-trained horses won six of the seven races, 
the score is now: Ireland 10-9 United Kingdom in the Betbright Cup.
 It was another very good day for WIllie Mullins and Ruby Walsh. Photograph:

Cause Of Causes came from nowhere to win that race, zooming up the outside 
like a train to win at his leisure. A Good Skin was second and - I think - 
Silver Grove was third. Confirmation of that in a moment.

Amigo leaps the second last with Cause Of Causes surging up on his outside. 
Cause Of Causes hoses home to win by 15 or 20 lengths under Jamie Codd to give 
trainer Gordon Ellioott another winner. Cause Of Causes wins the Kim Muir.

Oh jayzus! They’re sent away in the Kim Muir and Doctor Harper gives the first 
fence a mighty clatter, but manages to stay on his feet. That’s got to have 
taken the wind out of his sails, in so far as he had any wind in his sails at 
that early stage. He’s among the rear four at the moment. Splash Of Ginge leads 
from Silver Grove, with Amigo in third and The Giant Bolster in fourth on the

Preview: Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir (5.30)

Chris Cook

A staying handicap chase for amateur riders which has had some significance as 
a Grand National trial. David Pipe reckoned Doctor Harper was his best chance 
of a winner this week, which is encouraging, in view of Pipe’s having had 
another winner already. Cause Of Causes won the four-mile novice chase at the 
last Festival and looks really quite improbably well treated at the weights. 
Upswing represents the Jonjo O’Neill / Derek O’Connor team that won Tuesday’s 
amateur race. Sambremont has won his last two and is the Mullins runner, being 
ridden by the trainer’s son, Patrick. At 20-1, Indian Castle runs from a 6lb 
lower mark than two years ago, when he started favourite for this. He wears 
cheekpieces for only the second time and comes from a yard that had a winner 
here on Tuesday.

Mares' Novice Hurdle (4.50) 2m 1f

Ruby gives Limini a squeeze and she leads over the last. She wins pulling a 
milk-float. Limini wins the Mares’ Novice Hurdle and there’ll be bookies 
throwing off the roof of the grandstand after that result. Dusky Legend was 
second and Bloody Mary was third.

Mares' Novice Hurdle (4.50) 2m 1f

They’re off and running in the first running of a race many have dismissed as 
ridiculous and one that should have no place at theCheltenham Festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenhamfestival>. I have no strong views 
one way or the other, but the pot of £42,000 for the winner is better than a 
poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Limini goes off favourite, as Tea In 
Transvaal and Smart Talk make the running. Limini is nicely placed in fourth ...

The bookies are taking a hiding ...

“I just don’t know how the bookmakers can come back from this,” says 
professional punter and Racing UK betting analyst Dave Nevison, after the 
bookies took another pasting today. With Limini and a well-backed Martin Pipe 
horse to go off as favourites in the next two races, things could get a lot 
worse for them before they get better. Boo-hoo!

Another equine fatality being reported ...

Racing UK have extended their sympathies to the connections of Niceonefrankie, 
who they say has lost his life after falling in the Brown Advisory Plate. If 
true, that brings the number of fatalities in this year’s Festival to a rather 
depressing five.

Preview: Mares Novice Hurdle (4.50)

Chris Cook

A new race for this Festival which has been invented so that Willie Mullins 
can win something. And, oh look, he’s got the favourite. His Limini, unbeaten 
in two over hurdles, is handsomely bred, being by an Arc winner out of a 
half-sister to an Irish Oaks winner. Smart Talk is slightly higher in the 
ratings but has had six starts over hurdles and probably has less potential to 
improve on what she’s shown so far. Bloody Mary won well on her British debut 
last month, having run up a sequence of wins in her native France. Her trainer, 
Nicky Henderson, also has Chocca Wocca, the first foal out of Chomba Womba, who 
ran third at the Festival eight years ago.

A lot of falls in that race ...

And many of them were fairly unpleasant. Peter Carberry took quite a bad spill 
off Bear’s Affair and was still receiving treatment for sometime after the race 
ended, but was fit enough to walk back to the weighing room look little more 
than winded. There is one - as yet unidentified - horse still receiving 
veterinary attention on the course. Fingers crossed and more on that as we get 
it ...

Brown Advisory Plate (4.10) 2m 5f

Sew On Target continues to make the running as Nice One Frankie falls . Sew On 
Target from Kings Palace, with Bailey Green in third. Empire Of Dirt looks a 
big threat on the outside as he joins King’s Palace before going into the lead. 
Empire Of Dirt and King’s Palace take the final fence together, but Empire Of 
Dirt goes clear on the run-in to win for Gigginstown Stud under a fine, patient 
ride from Bryan Cooper. Empire Of Dirt wins the Brown Advisory Plate.

Preview: Brown Advisory Plate (4.10)

Chris Cook

Another tough handicap, in which two of the last three winners were returned 
at 33-1 and 50-1. The favourite is Johns Spirit, three times a winner round 
here, though he has yet to make an impact at the Festival. A series of poor 
runs have brought him down to a very reasonable weight. Fingal Bay is a 
Festival handicap winner over hurdles, fairly weighted and now sporting both 
blinkers AND a tongue tie, neither of which have been used on him before. He 
has not seemed a natural over fences, however. Stilletto has a classy and 
progressive profile, though this is a huge step up on the contests he has been 
in so far. Darna won this last year and is only 4lb higher now.

 On a fairly catastrophic days for the bookies in which three short-priced 
favourites were cheered into the winner’s enclosure, the Colin Tizzard-trained 
Thistlecrack won the feature World Hurdle doing handstands under Tom Scudamore.

 Ruby Walsh added another three winners to his CV to bring his tally for the 
week to seven and his career total to an astonishing 52. His big winner of the 
day was on board Vautour, a controversial winner of the Ryanair Chase, which he 
won at his leisure. Black Hercules had got Walsh off the mark in the JLT 
Novices’ Chase, while odds-on shot Limini obliged at her leisure in the 
inaugural runner of the Mares’ Hurdle.

 Davy Russell had a controversial start to the day, finding himself unseated 
at the start of the opener only for his luck to change when he took advantage 
of interference suffered by If In Doubt to win the Pertemps Final on board Mall 
Dini. Elsewhere, Bryan Cooper got the Gigginstown stud off the mark with his 
win in the Brown Advisory Plate, while Cause Of Cause and amateur rider Jamie 
Codd took the closing race, the Kim Muir.

Sadly, an otherwise good day for punters was marred by further tragedy when 
Niceonfrankie lost his life in the Brown Advisory Plate, becoming the fifth 
horse to die during the past three days of Festival racing. Join us tomorrow on 
Victoria Pendleton Day, where racecourse officials may also find time to run 
the Gold Cup.

On a St Patrick’s Day when Irish-trained horses won six of the seven races, 
the score is now: Ireland 10-9 United Kingdom in the Betbright Cup.

Cause Of Causes came from nowhere to win that race, zooming up the outside 
like a train to win at his leisure. A Good Skin was second and - I think - 
Silver Grove was third. Confirmation of that in a moment.
 
Amigo leaps the second last with Cause Of Causes surging up on his outside. 
Cause Of Causes hoses home to win by 15 or 20 lengths under Jamie Codd to give 
trainer Gordon Ellioott another winner. Cause Of Causes wins the Kim Muir.
 
They head out for the final circuit as Mon Perrain leads them along with Amigo 
upsides him. Mont Perrain starts going backwards as Amigo leads. Top Wood and 
Lost Legend fall as Amigo sets sail for home. Amigo leads by three lengths from 
Silver Grove ...
 
Splash Of Ginge, Silver Grove, Amigo, The Giant Bolster, Mon Parrain make the 
running, while Doctor Harper remains towards the back of the field. No fallers 
yet ....
 
Oh jayzus! They’re sent away in the Kim Muir and Doctor Harper gives the first 
fence a mighty clatter, but manages to stay on his feet. That’s got to have 
taken the wind out of his sails, in so far as he had any wind in his sails at 
that early stage. He’s among the rear four at the moment. Splash Of Ginge leads 
from Silver Grove, with Amigo in third and The Giant Bolster in fourth on the 
wide outside ...
 
 * Doctor Harper 7-2

 * Cause Of Causes 11-2

 * Upswing 8-1

 * The Giant Bolster 9-1

 * Sambremont 14-1

 * Silvergrove 16-1

 * A Good Skin 14-1

 * Knock House 16-1

 * Indian Castle 16-1 
20-1 bar <http://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/cheltenham/17:30/winner>
 
A staying handicap chase for amateur riders which has had some significance as 
a Grand National trial. David Pipe reckoned Doctor Harper was his best chance 
of a winner this week, which is encouraging, in view of Pipe’s having had 
another winner already. Cause Of Causes won the four-mile novice chase at the 
last Festival and looks really quite improbably well treated at the weights. 
Upswing represents the Jonjo O’Neill / Derek O’Connor team that won Tuesday’s 
amateur race. Sambremont has won his last two and is the Mullins runner, being 
ridden by the trainer’s son, Patrick. At 20-1, Indian Castle runs from a 6lb 
lower mark than two years ago, when he started favourite for this. He wears 
cheekpieces for only the second time and comes from a yard that had a winner 
here on Tuesday.

Ruby gives Limini a squeeze and she leads over the last. She wins pulling a 
milk-float. Limini wins the Mares’ Novice Hurdle and there’ll be bookies 
throwing off the roof of the grandstand after that result. Dusky Legend was 
second and Bloody Mary was third.
 
Smart Talk leads, but only just, from Tea In Transvaal, followed by Bloody 
Mary. Smart Talk is being ridden along, then it’s Ducky Legend and Limini. 
Robins Reef and Dusky Legend are coming into it and they’ve one to jump ...
 
Smart Talk continues to lead from Transvaal, with Bloody Mary up in third. 
Limini is still fourth or fifth with three to jump ...
 
They’re off and running in the first running of a race many have dismissed as 
ridiculous and one that should have no place at theCheltenham Festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenhamfestival>. I have no strong views 
one way or the other, but the pot of £42,000 for the winner is better than a 
poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Limini goes off favourite, as Tea In 
Transvaal and Smart Talk make the running. Limini is nicely placed in fourth ...
 
 * Limini 4-7

 * Smart Talk 7-1

 * Bloody Mary 12-1

“I just don’t know how the bookmakers can come back from this,” says 
professional punter and Racing UK betting analyst Dave Nevison, after the 
bookies took another pasting today. With Limini and a well-backed Martin Pipe 
horse to go off as favourites in the next two races, things could get a lot 
worse for them before they get better. Boo-hoo!
 
Racing UK have extended their sympathies to the connections of Niceonefrankie, 
who they say has lost his life after falling in the Brown Advisory Plate. If 
true, that brings the number of fatalities in this year’s Festival to a rather 
depressing five.
 
A new race for this Festival which has been invented so that Willie Mullins 
can win something. And, oh look, he’s got the favourite. His Limini, unbeaten 
in two over hurdles, is handsomely bred, being by an Arc winner out of a 
half-sister to an Irish Oaks winner. Smart Talk is slightly higher in the 
ratings but has had six starts over hurdles and probably has less potential to 
improve on what she’s shown so far. Bloody Mary won well on her British debut 
last month, having run up a sequence of wins in her native France. Her trainer, 
Nicky Henderson, also has Chocca Wocca, the first foal out of Chomba Womba, who 
ran third at the Festival eight years ago.

And many of them were fairly unpleasant. Peter Carberry took quite a bad spill 
off Bear’s Affair and was still receiving treatment for sometime after the race 
ended, but was fit enough to walk back to the weighing room look little more 
than winded. There is one - as yet unidentified - horse still receiving 
veterinary attention on the course. Fingers crossed and more on that as we get 
it ...

Sew On Target continues to make the running as Nice One Frankie falls . Sew On 
Target from Kings Palace, with Bailey Green in third. Empire Of Dirt looks a 
big threat on the outside as he joins King’s Palace before going into the lead. 
Empire Of Dirt and King’s Palace take the final fence together, but Empire Of 
Dirt goes clear on the run-in to win for Gigginstown Stud under a fine, patient 
ride from Bryan Cooper. Empire Of Dirt wins the Brown Advisory Plate.
 
Stiletto falls early doors, unshipping Sam Twiston-Davies, as Sew On Target 
leads them along, followed by Nice One Frankie, Kings Palace and Darna. Darna 
falls and brings down another runner ...
 
We’re more than halfway through the 28-race card for this year’s Festival and 
the starter calls them back after several horses canter towards the tapes, 
leaving Robbie Supple , the man with the flag, with no choice but to call them 
back. After administering a bollocking to several riders for not obeying his 
instructions, he sends them on their way from a standing start ...
 
Mark Walsh rides Full Shift in place of Barry Geraghty, who can’t make the 
weight.

Another tough handicap, in which two of the last three winners were returned 
at 33-1 and 50-1. The favourite is Johns Spirit, three times a winner round 
here, though he has yet to make an impact at the Festival. A series of poor 
runs have brought him down to a very reasonable weight. Fingal Bay is a 
Festival handicap winner over hurdles, fairly weighted and now sporting both 
blinkers AND a tongue tie, neither of which have been used on him before. He 
has not seemed a natural over fences, however. Stilletto has a classy and 
progressive profile, though this is a huge step up on the contests he has been 
in so far. Darna won this last year and is only 4lb higher now.
