1 Josephine Baker hits Brixton

Patience Agbabi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/poem-of-the-week-skins-by-patience-agbabi>
 makes language swing as she imagines an encounter with the 1920s singer, 
dancer and political activist Josephine Baker in Brixton, London. It’s a double 
monologue shaped like a palindrome, or mirror-poem, in which the second stanza 
uses the same lines as the first, but in reverse. As the twogarçonnes (sexually 
liberated women) enjoy a pick-up that’s also a mutual pick-me-up, you might not 
notice the formal virtuosity, but you’ll definitely feel the joy.

Josephine Baker Finds Herself

She picked me up
like a slow-burning fuse. I was down
that girls’ club used to run in Brixton,
on acid for fuel. Lipstick lesbians,
techno so hardcore it’s spewing out Audis.
She samples my heartbeat and mixes it with
vodka on the rocks. I’m her light-skinned, negative,
twenty-something, short black wavy-bobbed diva.
She purrs La Garçonne, fancy a drink? I say
Yes. She’s crossing the Star Bar like it’s a catwalk. So sleek!
A string of pearls, her flapper dress
studded with low-cut diamonds
through my skin, straight to my heart.
Twenties chic! She works
me up and down. I worship
the way she looks.

The way she looks
me up and down. I worship
twenties chic. She works
through my skin, straight to my heart
studded with low-cut diamonds.
A string of pearls her flapper dress.
Yes! She’s crossing the Star Bar like it’s a catwalk so sleek
she purrs, la garçonne! Fancy a drink? I say.
Twenty-something, short, Black, wavy-bobbed diva:
Vodka on the rocks, I’m her light-skinned negative.
She samples my heartbeat and mixes it with
techno so hardcore it’s spewing out Audis
on acid for fuel. Lipstick Lesbians,
that girls’ club used to run in Brixton
like a slow-burning fuse. I was down.
She picked me up.

2 Life, please!

Mind and body are old sparring partners, and their apparent argument gets a 
sharp new twist in this cleverly titled, deftly rhymed parable by Anne 
Stevenson. Both are tempted by “the naked abyss”. To turn away from death 
towards life is one of the great acts of courage. Indecision causes vertigo. If 
only we could ask our bodies to choose, there’d be no dilemma – every cell is 
hard-wired to shout: “Life, please!”

Vertigo

Mind led body
to the edge of the precipice.
They stared in desire
at the naked abyss.
If you love me, said mind,
take that step into silence.
If you love me, said body,
turn and exist.

3 A miniature sun in every cup

Perhaps suspicious of vulgar self-indulgence, the lyric muse tends to ignore 
the sense of taste. But this poem by Tomas Tranströmer,the Swedish Nobel 
prize-winner <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/31/tomas-transtromer>, 
defies the etiquette. Its grammar-dodging couplets invite us to sit with the 
poet in a cheerful, outdoor cafe on a spring morning. That “daylight dot of 
beneficent black” is like a miniature sun in every cup. And the coffee is not 
only delicious, but a spur to activity and inspiration. Sing caffeine Muse!

Espresso

The black coffee they serve outdoors
among tables and chairs gaudy as insects.

Precious distillations
filled with the same strength as Yes and No.

It’s carried out from the gloomy kitchen
and looks into the sun without blinking.

In the daylight a dot of beneficent black
that quickly flows into a pale customer.

It’s like the drops of black profoundness
sometimes gathered up by the soul,

giving a salutary push: Go!
Inspiration to open your eyes.

4 Feathered favourite

Emily Dickinson was a super-keen observer of nature and her poems are packed 
with metaphor and allusion. Although the bird in this poem is generic, casually 
evoked as “the thing with feathers”, it somehow achieves a real presence. The 
small bird of Hope asks nothing, survives extremity and never ceases to sing 
“the tune without the words”. Paradoxically, this must be one of the most 
often-memorised poems ever written. 


“Hope” is the thing with feathers

“Hope” is the thing with feathers --
That perches in the soul --
And sings the tune without the words --
And never stops -- at all --

And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard --
And sore must be the storm --
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm --

I’ve heard it in the chillest land --
And on the strangest Sea --
Yet -- never -- in Extremity,
It asked a crumb -- of me.

5 The washing sulks in the corner

Between the lines, Kim Moore may be writing about brawling lovers, but she 
exuberantly imagines their row as civil war between the objects in a house. 
It’s what is often described as “a domestic”. Even the doors go off in a huff, 
and the bed only just survives collapse. Enjoy the catharsis!

In Praise of Arguing

And the vacuum cleaner flew
down the stairs like a song
and the hiking boots
launched themselves
along the landing.

And one half of the house
hated the other half
and the blinds
wound themselves around
each other.

And the doors flung
themselves into the street
and flounced away
and the washing gathered
in corners and sulked.

And the bed collapsed
and was held up by books
and the walls developed
scars and it was a glorious,
glorious year.

6 That old seedy hotel sex magic

James Fenton’s speaker claims to have had enough of love. But as the old, 
seedy-hotel sex-magic asserts itself, his refrain gradually becomes one of 
delighted celebration. “Am I embarrassing you? I’m in Paris with you” gets my 
award for Best Rhyming Couplet in Contemporary EnglishPoetry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry>.

In Paris with You

Don’t talk to me of love. I’ve had an earful
And I get tearful when I’ve had a drink or two.
I’m one of your talking wounded.
I’m a hostage. I’m maroonded.
But I’m in Paris with you.

Yes I’m angry at the way I’ve been bamboozled
And resentful at the mess I’ve been through.
I admit I’m on the rebound
And I don’t care where are we bound.
I’m in Paris with you.

Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre,
If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame,
If we skip the Champs Elysées
And remain here in this sleazy
Old hotel room
Doing this and that
To what and whom,
Learning who you are,
Learning what I am.

Don’t talk to me of love. Let’s talk of Paris,
The little bit of Paris in our view.
There’s the crack across the ceiling
And the hotel walls are peeling
And I’m in Paris with you.

Don’t talk to me of love. Let’s talk of Paris.
I’m in Paris with the slightest thing you do.
I’m in Paris with your eyes, your mouth,
I’m in Paris with … all points south.
Am I embarrassing you?
I’m in Paris with you.

7 Dance of the newborn baby

Kate Miller’s poem charmingly captures all the dance moves of the newborn 
baby, whose native skills include the ability to lift its feet in the stepping 
reflex, “hopskip and bowing”. The image of the “separate knot” suggests both 
the umbilical cord and the casual kit of belongings tied together by an 
adventurous young traveller setting out.

And now you

exist
outside the royal room of blood you occupied

and – without being shown –
can close a fist or yawn.

Practised, you look
already. Hopskip and bowing,
treading measure in a dance.

You only took to unfamiliar air
with your first taste of dust
yesterday as evening fell. All the falling,

all the flow around you,
hair and water, will become familiar:
mother, father: skin-to-skin.

You’ve swum the sea of welcome,
been lifted on the swell,
slipped waxy through the crowd of hands.

Your own breath sounded
the all-clear,
all’s well,

when you sang out a first
exclamatory note

about the cord that tied you
being cut,
the tying-off, your separate knot.

8 Queen of my own universe

If you’ve never won a race (or perhaps never even run a race) and worry you 
might have missed something special, sit back and enjoy Tracey Herd’s winning 
monologue. While Tomas Tranströmer discerned the sun in a cup of rich espresso, 
Herd finds it in the athlete’s gold medal, “like a tiny sun catching the last 
of the light”. The runner’s sensations are heightened and small details as 
deeply etched as the moment of victory on the speaker’s memory.

What I Remember

is not the race itself but the evening
which disappeared in a tangle of diving
sunlight and nerves as I hugged myself,
chilled, and waited for the starter, bent
forward, the tang of mown grass
sprayed like water and the white lines
freshly painted on the spongy red track,
breasting the tape, alone and splendid,
queen of my own universe, then the medal
like a tiny sun catching the last of the light,
and feeling as if my heart would burst.

9 To bud and leaf again

With this poem by Gillian Clarke we’re in the depths of the winter solstice. 
All the “golden ones” have come to dust, and greater threats than winter may be 
brewing “while the world talks,/ and the ice melts, / and the seas rise”. But 
the winter trees are preparing to bud and leaf again, challenging the irony of 
the last line’s “Promises. Promises.”

The Year’s Midnight

The flown, the fallen,
the golden ones,
the deciduous dead, all gone
to ground, to dust, to sand,
borne on the shoulders of the wind.

Listen! They are whispering
now while the world talks,
and the ice melts,
and the seas rise.
Look at the trees!

Every leaf-scar is a bud
expecting a future.
The earth speaks in parables.
The burning bush. The rainbow.
Promises. Promises.

10 Every day is Saturday

Yorkshire poet Maurice Rutherford <http://www.mauricerutherford.com/> was born 
in 1922, the same year asPhilip Larkin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin>. Here, the writer-narrator 
pauses to savour some everyday gifts of wonder and pleasure. A linnet on the 
lawn, a ship outward-bound, and memories of classroom horticulture all remind 
the poet – and us – that “a place where/ every day is Saturday, and Saturday is 
Christmas” can be reached through the power of imagination.

Poem on Saturday

Outside my window, a linnet on the laburnum
shows poetry to the other birds, preens,
stutters its wings and corrugates away
across the lawn, and the nest of words
I am waiting to hatch goes cold.

Yesterday, as from the office window I watched
a vessel leave the lockpits, outward-bound
for Genoa, slipping the tugs from the task in hand,
my feet were treading Italian ground
before the Humber had healed in her wake.

I knew, once, a tall school window high above
the tiers of desks, where, in carbolic air,
peas imprisoned in a jar strove for the sky
and begged me join in their climb to a place where
every day is Saturday and Saturday is Christmas.
