 The Goblin King’s Masquerade Ball... ‘a dark, unshackled fairytale’. 
A Curious Invitation specialises in darkly alternative events and this latest 
ball took the filmLabyrinth as its inspiration, in a nod to the late David Bowie
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/17/david-bowie-as-seen-by-deborah-harry-chris-kate-bush-stein-carlos-alomar-julien-temple-edwyn-collins>
. It featured some fine bands, fire-eaters, sword-swallowers, a brilliantly 
surreal puppet tribute toJabberwocky 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42916>, and a 
disquieting Grand Guignol act involving a bird-skull-headed woman and some 
large scissors. Everybody dressed for the occasion, so we were immediately 
immersed in a dark, unshackled fairytale. Mortals were dragged past in chains 
by slinking, sinister fairies; dryads danced in vine-covered cages and horned 
goblins drank with masked unknowns in period finery.

 John Dee... a truly Renaissance man. Photograph: Apic 
This lecture evening at the Royal College of Physicians <http:> was discovered 
by a friend of mine with a nigh-supernatural ability to track down quirky 
things happening in London.John Dee 
<https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/events/scholar-courtier-magician-lost-library-john-dee>
 took his Renaissance man duties seriously, becoming an internationally 
acclaimed expert in mathematics, geometry, alchemy, history, Greek, navigation, 
astrology, astronomy, occult theory and talking to angels. The lecturers agreed 
that he probably wasn’t a spy, but it’s just about the only trick he missed. 
The accompanying exhibition displays volumes from Dee’s vast personal library, 
covered with his fascinating and oddly endearing notes and doodles. The 
obsidian mirror, engraved gold disc and scrying crystals alleged to have been 
used in Dee’s occult experiments still have an alluring mystique.

 Mercury in silhouette as it transits across the sun. Photograph: David 
Tyler/Barcroft Images 
About 13 times each century, Earth has a view of Mercury silhouetted against 
the sun. On 9 May, several telescopes were set up at theRoyal Observatory at 
Greenwich <http://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory> so that the public could 
watch the transit for free. I was lucky enough to turn up during a clear 
interval, just before the sun retreated to its trailer and refused to come back 
to the set. Through the telescope I could make out the surface of the sun, 
textured like orange peel. Against its glow, sunspots the size of the Earth 
were dark wisps and Mercury was a tiny, perfect, black circle. Even on an 
ordinary day there is plenty to do at the Royal Observatory. Where else can you 
touch a4.5bn-year-old meteorite?

The Crime Museum Uncovered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/oct/03/the-museum-uncovered>
 at theMuseum of London <http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london>

I have a confession to make. Crime fascinates me, particularly period crime. 
This exhibition was packed with items from historical cases, all of which would 
usually be hidden away in a teaching museum for police trainees. It offered a 
fascinating insight into the development of police procedure, but there was 
also an undeniable frisson to seeing a letter from the Victorian mass-murderer
Amelia Dyer <http://murderpedia.org/female.D/d/dyer-amelia.htm>, a pistol used 
in an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria, shackles said to have been worn 
by the 18th-centuryjail-breaker Jack Sheppard 
<http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Amazing-Escapes-of-Jack-Sheppard/>
, and the 19th-century mugshot and arrest card of a 12-year-old boy caught 
“housebreaking, stealing biscuits”.

 The Marvels by Brian Selznick... ‘about the ways myth-making can keep truths 
and memories alive’. Photograph: Scholastic Press 
This is essentially a story sandwich, with two entirely pictorial narratives 
flanking 200 pages of text. The monochrome pictures are sensitive and vivid and 
the story they tell fast paced and larger than life, so it’s a shock to realise 
that the book is actually about lies, loss, Aids and the ways that myth-making 
can keep truths and memories alive.The Marvels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/27/the-marvels-brian-selznick-review>
 is a children’s book, but I suspect it has a different resonance to me now 
than it would have done when I was young. After all, it’s a story about 
personal history and I have a lot more of that than I once did. It won’t be for 
everyone, but it’s unique.

Sentinels of the Multiverse <https://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/>

My partner and I have a serious board game addiction and our collection has 
now reached slightly terrifying dimensions. Over the last five years, we have 
become particularly fond of cooperative games, where all players are allies in 
their battle against the game itself. One of our more recent acquisitions is 
Sentinels of the Multiverse, a tongue-in-cheek, card-based game in which each 
player is a superhero, with their own deck tailored to their abilities. The 
heroes battle ingenious supervillains while trying to survive incidental 
dangers such as hungry dinosaurs and crashing monorails. Cooperative games tend 
to be gripping but good humoured – I’ve seen epic battles in which heroes have 
sacrificed themselves at the 11th hour, so that the last hero standing can 
strike the telling blow.

 The Turbans… spotted busking near London’s Oxford Circus. 
7 | Music

The Turbans <https://theturbansbandcamp.bandcamp.com/>

At the moment I’m listening to a CD that I impulse-bought from a band busking 
near Oxford Circus in London. I’m somewhat prone to such impulse purchases, so 
my musical collection is a little… eclectic. On previous occasions I have 
bought CDs from a man with a fold-up piano, a group singing 17th-century street 
ballads, and a band playing didgeridoos and using assorted scrap metal as 
percussion. The Turbans describe their music as combining traditional 
near-eastern and eastern European styles.
