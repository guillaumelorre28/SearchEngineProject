.

“Did you know he was dying?” Snow asked, to which the actor replied: “I did.”

Snow then joked: “So it wasn’t a case of ‘I don’t believe it’ then?” 
<http://bcove.me/tju2w8i8> in reference to the actor’s trademark catchphrase 
from the BBC sitcom.

While Wilson met the joke without obvious offence, many viewers criticised the 
incident as jarring.

Jon Snow <https://www.theguardian.com/media/jon-snow> is a news legend but the 
'I don't believe it' he shoe-horned into an interview with Richard Wilson on 
Alan Rickman was poor taste.

Jon Snow @Channel4News <https://twitter.com/Channel4News> just asked Richard 
Wilson if, when he heard Alan Rickman had died, it was a case of ' I don't 
believe it' Not good.

Wilson and Rickman worked together on stage in 1980 when the former directed 
the latter in a play called Commitments.

“He could take on anything,” Wilson told the Guardian on Thursday. “He was an 
open actor, a non-demonstrative actor. And he was easy peasy to direct. We 
remained friends ever since. He would come and see everything I did, and I 
would always see everything he did, and we would talk at length about it.”

Rickman’s death has led to tributes across the entertainment industry
