US markets close up 1.4%, despite earlier global panic at Trump's victory

Wall Street reacted positively to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th US 
president, despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the 
day. But experts warned that the US, and global, economy faces a very uncertain 
future

. Here’s how the markets looked at the close.

 * The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. 
 * The S&P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. 
 * The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251.

 were private prison operators, oil companies and pharmaceutical companies. All 
of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a Clinton presidency, and 
will benefit from Trump’s mission to loosen controls of businesses.

• On the currency markets, the dollar hit its highest in nearly four months 
against the Japanese yen. It had fallen 4% in overnight trading.

dollar.

 growth by 0.5 percentage points, and warned of “despair in the financial 
markets”.


• Trump’s economist adviser warned that Janet Yellen’s days as chair of the 
Federal Reserve are numbered

. And the odds of the central bank increasing interest rates in December have 
lengthened.

• The FTSE 100 fell 2% upon opening on Wednesday, before recovering to end the 
day more than 60 points up

• The Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down 5.4% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 2.2%.

We’re wrapping up for the day, but we’ll be back tomorrow (or tonight if 
things get dicey).

Jack Welch: Trump's economic plan offers "unlimited" opportunities

The former chairman and CEO of General Electric said “the opportunities are 
unlimited” under a Trump presidency.

You look at lower taxes. You look at job creation. We are stuck. We have been 
stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck. 
Business stinks.

Welch, a longtime Republican, told CNBC that he liked Trump’s message “from 
the first day” but he is still concerned about the messenger. “Every time I 
lurched forward in support, I’d lose the messenger. He’d do some wacky thing,” 
he said.

He said he hoped Trump would build a broad coalition of Republican talent in 
the White House. “You can’t have grudges in this game. You need talent. We will 
win with the best people,” he said.

Welch withdrew his support for Trump, following the revelations that the 
president-elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was 
famous.
Jack Welch (@jack_welch) 
Like Republican message on Economy, Security and Supreme 
Court...Unfortunately, wrong messenger...Party must change nominee now.

Larry Elliott

The Guardian’s economics editor Larry Elliott says Americans have gambled on 
Trump’s promise that he can shift the the US out of its post-financial crisis 
torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk 
of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit.

Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. 
Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would 
generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn’t.Tax breaks for the 
rich and military Keynesianism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/07/ronald-reagan-republicans>
sent the deficit rocketing.

For the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger 
corporate profits. That’s why share prices have been going up.

Trump will have to temper his global antagonism, economists say

Don’t panic, too much says Berenberg bank’s chief America’s economist Mickey 
Levy in a note to clients: 

Trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he 
will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that 
understand and influence the US’ approaches on international affairs. This will 
serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign.

Levy said Trump’s often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with 
Mexico and tear up global trade agreements “will fade, with no material follow 
through or implementation” and “no wall will be built between Mexico and the 
US”.

China and Mexico are two of the US’s largest trading partners. Neither wants 
to enter a trade war with the US, and neither can afford to do so. The US 
relies heavily on imports from those partners. Current concerns about major 
trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic.

Luca Paolini, chief strategist Pictet Asset Management, declared Trump “no 
friend of trade”and warned that his protectionist streak poses “perhaps the 
biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets”. 

His proposals to raise trade tariffs – pledging, among other things, to levy a 
45 per cent tax on Chinese imports – are a worry. His denouncement of China as 
a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the world’s second 
biggest economy. At a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a 
structural decline,Trump’s stance casts a shadow over the world’s economic 
prospects.

BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades US 2017 growth

The bank has cut its forecasts for US GDP growth by 0.5% percentage points in 
both the first and second quarter of 2017, and warned of“despair in the 
financial markets”. It said:

 * Near-term drag: Shaved 0.5pp from first and second quarter GDP growth, 
thereby lowering the annual number from 2.1% to 1.8%. 
 * A more cautious Fed: We expect 1 rather than 3 Fed rate hikes between now 
and the end of next year with the probability of a December hike falling to 
1-in-3. 
 * Given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this 
stage, we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting 
impacts on growth in the medium term. 
 * While a wide range of outcomes is possible, the risks to the economy seem 
to be skewed more to the downside. Facebook

Trump’s economic advisers have accused Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal 
Reserve, of creating a “false economy” by keeping interest rates artificially 
low to help President Obama and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

Trump has attacked Yellen throughout his campaign. In September he said Yellen 
“should be ashamed of herself,”. “I used to hope that the Fed was independent,” 
he said in an interview with CNBC. “And the Fed is obviously not independent. 
It’s obviously not even close to being independent.”

Just hours after Trump’s election, Judy Shelton, his only female economist 
adviser,told the FT 
<https://www.ft.com/content/81ccb764-a698-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1> that Trump 
wanted to a new chair of the Fed. She said:

He has made it a very strong point of his campaign that he thinks that the 
Federal Reserve’s intervention and elongated accommodative monetary policy has 
created a false economy. People who have worked all their lives have been 
penalised by these low rates.

Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast 
enough. The market expected the Fed to raise rates in December, but Trump’s 
election has - ironically - made a rate rise much less likely.

On Tuesday afternoon, when it looked like Clinton was odds-on to secure the 
White House the probability of a December rate hike was 81%, according to CME 
Group. Now it is 67%.

Trump has repeatedly said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed 
chief when her term expires in early 2018. He wants to replace her with a 
Republican who follows his economic thinking.


The Fed increased the benchmark federal funds rate to between 0.25-0.5% in 
December 2015, and has held there since due to various national and global 
uncertainties.

Dominic Rushe, US business editor, has been speaking to Jack Ablin, chief 
investment officer of BNP Private Bank. Ablin was as surprised as many by 
Trump’s victory and by the sanguine reaction of the US markets.

I expected that at the least the markets would give up all the gains that they 
had made when it looked like Clinton was going to win. That said it is 
encouraging that people are seeing opportunities,” he said.

But Ablin believes that there are likely to be issues ahead. Among today’s big 
gainers are pharmaceutical companies. Investors now believe will escape the 
price caps Clinton had proposed and benefit from Trump’s pledge to cut 
regulation. But those companies do the majority of their business overseas.

Trump has suggested building a wall around our borders and he’s attitude on 
trade could build a figurative wall around US business.”

Ablin believes today’s calm is unlikely to last and that Trump’s inexperience 
in foreign policy, and his comments on trade, are likely to cause volatility in 
the weeks and years ahead.

Mexico’s richest man, telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, is not quite as rich today.

The world’s 5th richest man, who is also a big donor to the Clinton Foundation 
and major New York Times shareholder, has lost $5.1bn in wake of Trump’s victory
according to Bloomberg

Slim’s personal fortune fell by as much as 9.2% as the Mexican peso plunged by 
13% before stabilizing at 8% down. The nation’s central bank governor and 
finance minister were forced to reassure the nation that the country’s finances 
are safe.

The top 10 Mexican billionaires on the Bloomberg’s index lost a combined 
$6.5bn. Overall, the world’s wealthiest people lost $41bn.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has emailed all his employees, calling on business 
leaders and government officials to listen to the disenfranchised working class 
voters who helped deliver Trump the election. He said they showed a “deep 
desire for change”.

Here is the full text of his memo (highlights, ours): 

Dear colleagues,

We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around 
the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting 
to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard 
through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the 
frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and 
the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices.

We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, 
which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it 
more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together 
Americans from all walks of life.Recognizing that our diversity is a core 
strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve 
our most serious challenges.

Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to 
collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and 
greater opportunity for all.

America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the 
political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one 
should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.

J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our 
countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that 
will continue to thrive – as we continue to focus on helping to serve our 
clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important 
public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges 
throughout the world.

I’m optimistic about America’s future and the role our company will continue 
to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. 
Jamie

This is Rupert Neate, in the Guardian’s New York office, taking over from 
Graeme.

As Wall Street pulls off a surprising surge despite 370 prominent economists 
warning that a Trump presidency would be “dangerous, destructive” for the 
national and the world economy <http:// 
http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/01/prominent-economists-including-eight-nobel-laureates-do-not-vote-for-donald-trump/>
, let’s take a look at who the biggest financial winners are.
RupertNeate (@RupertNeate) 
The biggest corporate winners from Trump's victory. Private prisons and oil 
companiespic.twitter.com/xVjRgH1Ziz <https://t.co/xVjRgH1Ziz>
 <https://twitter.com/RupertNeate/status/796407917746458624> November 9, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/RupertNeate/status/796407917746458624> 
Private prison operator Corrections of America surged by as much as 60% in 
early trading before settling back at a 41% increase. Rival operator GEO Group 
was also up 18%.

The companies are soaring as analysts reckon that Trump will row back on the 
Department of Justice’s ruling this summer to phase out privately run jails. 
The companies could benefit still further from Trump’s plan for the mass 
deportation of immigrants.

Analysts at Height Securities said: 

Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his 
administration will likely rescind the DOJ’s contract phase-out and ICE 
[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come 
under further stress.

Oil companies are benefiting from Trump’s pledge to make America “energy 
independent”, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas. 
He has also vowed withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to 
end the “billions and billion and billions” given to UN climate programmes and 
clean energy development.

Big pharma companies are also gaining, as Hillary Clinton had pledged to bring 
in controls to prevent pharmaceutical companies from hiking the price of drugs 
following recent scandals. Shares in Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, 
are up 7%.

S&P 500 hits one-month high

There’s never much room for sentiment in the financial markets.

And over on Wall Street, the S&P 500 index had hit its highest level in a 
month - just as Hillary Clinton was giving her first speech since the election.

The index has now gained 1% since trading opened, touching levels last seen in 
early October.

European markets end higher despite Trump shock

After a wild day’s trading, European stock markets have ended the day with 
solid gains.

In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed 1% higher at 6911.8.

That’s quite a turnaround, given the index plunged by 2% at the start of the 
trading day (just as Donald Trump’s victory was confirmed).

Wall Street is betting that the prospect of reforming America’s gun laws faded 
last night, sending shares of the US’s two largest gun companies sliding by 10% 
today.

Sam Thielman reports:


Donald Trump’s election effectively puts an end to the gun control legislation 
proposed by Democrats. Under Barack Obama, gun companies have enjoyed record 
breaking sales and share price growth driven by fears that he would tighten 
rules on sales following a series of mass shootings.

Smith & Wesson’s shares were down 10.21% and shares of Sturm Ruger were down 
12.29% in early morning trading.

US stocks are moving higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 
100 points, or 0.5%.

So much for the Trump slump....

Pharmaceuticals companies, infrastructure providers and banking stocks are 
leading the way (for reasons explained earlier).

Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says investors have digested the 
election result with impressive speed. But the long-term implications of the 
result simply aren’t known yet.

The narrative seems to be that Trump’s presidential promises during his 
victory speech have reassured investors, allowing for the remarkable recovery 
seen this afternoon. The market may also be correcting the intensely negative 
gut reaction it had to the result, much as it did in the aftermath of the 
Brexit.

Simply it is too early to tell what exactly President Trump has in store, 
something that may make for a rocky rest of November, even if today has 
confounded expectations market-wise.

The US dollar has now risen since Wall Street opened, reversing its overnight 
losses.

Some analysts are arguing that Trump’s victory doesn’t rule out a hike in US 
interest rates in December.

And if he does cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and impose trade 
curbs, then inflation would rise and the Fed might raise borrowing costs faster 
than currently anticipated in 2017 and 2018. That makes the dollar a more 
attractive asset.

Wall Street reacted positively to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th US 
president, despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the 
day. But experts warned that the US, and global, economy faces a very uncertain 
future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/nov/09/stock-markets-on-edge-as-us-presidential-election-heads-for-tense-climax?page=with:block-58238129e4b0eda0192fdf65#block-58238129e4b0eda0192fdf65>
. Here’s how the markets looked at the close.

 * The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. 
 * The S&P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. 
 * The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251.

of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a Clinton presidency, and 
will benefit from Trump’s mission to loosen controls of businesses.

• On the currency markets, the dollar hit its highest in nearly four months

The Mexican peso plunged 13%, before stabilizing at 8.7% at 19.91 pesos to the 
dollar.

We’re wrapping up for the day, but we’ll be back tomorrow (or tonight if 
things get dicey).
 
The former chairman and CEO of General Electric said “the opportunities are 
unlimited” under a Trump presidency.

You look at lower taxes. You look at job creation. We are stuck. We have been 
stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck. 
Business stinks.

Welch, a longtime Republican, told CNBC that he liked Trump’s message “from 
the first day” but he is still concerned about the messenger. “Every time I 
lurched forward in support, I’d lose the messenger. He’d do some wacky thing,” 
he said.

He said he hoped Trump would build a broad coalition of Republican talent in 
the White House. “You can’t have grudges in this game. You need talent. We will 
win with the best people,” he said.

Welch withdrew his support for Trump, following the revelations that the 
president-elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was 
famous.

Court...Unfortunately, wrong messenger...Party must change nominee now.

The Guardian’s economics editor Larry Elliott says Americans have gambled on 
Trump’s promise that he can shift the the US out of its post-financial crisis 
torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk 
of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit.

Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. 
Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would 
generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn’t.Tax breaks for the 
rich and military Keynesianism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/07/ronald-reagan-republicans>
sent the deficit rocketing.

For the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger 
corporate profits. That’s why share prices have been going up.

Trump will have to temper his global antagonism, economists say

Don’t panic, too much says Berenberg bank’s chief America’s economist Mickey 
Levy in a note to clients: 

Trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he 
will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that 
understand and influence the US’ approaches on international affairs. This will 
serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign.

Levy said Trump’s often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with 
Mexico and tear up global trade agreements “will fade, with no material follow 
through or implementation” and “no wall will be built between Mexico and the 
US”.

China and Mexico are two of the US’s largest trading partners. Neither wants 
to enter a trade war with the US, and neither can afford to do so. The US 
relies heavily on imports from those partners. Current concerns about major 
trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic.

Luca Paolini, chief strategist Pictet Asset Management, declared Trump “no 
friend of trade”and warned that his protectionist streak poses “perhaps the 
biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets”. 

His proposals to raise trade tariffs – pledging, among other things, to levy a 
45 per cent tax on Chinese imports – are a worry. His denouncement of China as 
a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the world’s second 
biggest economy. At a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a 
structural decline,Trump’s stance casts a shadow over the world’s economic 
prospects.
 
BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades US 2017 growth

The bank has cut its forecasts for US GDP growth by 0.5% percentage points in 
both the first and second quarter of 2017, and warned of“despair in the 
financial markets”. It said:

 * Near-term drag: Shaved 0.5pp from first and second quarter GDP growth, 
thereby lowering the annual number from 2.1% to 1.8%. 
 * A more cautious Fed: We expect 1 rather than 3 Fed rate hikes between now 
and the end of next year with the probability of a December hike falling to 
1-in-3. 
 * Given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this 
stage, we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting 
impacts on growth in the medium term. 
 * While a wide range of outcomes is possible, the risks to the economy seem 
to be skewed more to the downside.  
Trump’s economic advisers have accused Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal 
Reserve, of creating a “false economy” by keeping interest rates artificially 
low to help President Obama and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

Trump has attacked Yellen throughout his campaign. In September he said Yellen 
“should be ashamed of herself,”. “I used to hope that the Fed was independent,” 
he said in an interview with CNBC. “And the Fed is obviously not independent. 
It’s obviously not even close to being independent.”

Just hours after Trump’s election, Judy Shelton, his only female economist 
adviser,told the FT 
<https://www.ft.com/content/81ccb764-a698-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1> that Trump 
wanted to a new chair of the Fed. She said:

He has made it a very strong point of his campaign that he thinks that the 
Federal Reserve’s intervention and elongated accommodative monetary policy has 
created a false economy. People who have worked all their lives have been 
penalised by these low rates.

Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast 
enough. The market expected the Fed to raise rates in December, but Trump’s 
election has - ironically - made a rate rise much less likely.

On Tuesday afternoon, when it looked like Clinton was odds-on to secure the 
White House the probability of a December rate hike was 81%, according to CME 
Group. Now it is 67%.

Trump has repeatedly said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed 
chief when her term expires in early 2018. He wants to replace her with a 
Republican who follows his economic thinking.


The Fed increased the benchmark federal funds rate to between 0.25-0.5% in 
December 2015, and has held there since due to various national and global 
uncertainties.
 
Dominic Rushe, US business editor, has been speaking to Jack Ablin, chief 
investment officer of BNP Private Bank. Ablin was as surprised as many by 
Trump’s victory and by the sanguine reaction of the US markets.

I expected that at the least the markets would give up all the gains that they 
had made when it looked like Clinton was going to win. That said it is 
encouraging that people are seeing opportunities,” he said.

But Ablin believes that there are likely to be issues ahead. Among today’s big 
gainers are pharmaceutical companies. Investors now believe will escape the 
price caps Clinton had proposed and benefit from Trump’s pledge to cut 
regulation. But those companies do the majority of their business overseas.

Trump has suggested building a wall around our borders and he’s attitude on 
trade could build a figurative wall around US business.”

Ablin believes today’s calm is unlikely to last and that Trump’s inexperience 
in foreign policy, and his comments on trade, are likely to cause volatility in 
the weeks and years ahead.

 
Mexico’s richest man, telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, is not quite as rich today.

The world’s 5th richest man, who is also a big donor to the Clinton Foundation 
and major New York Times shareholder, has lost $5.1bn in wake of Trump’s victory
according to Bloomberg

.

Slim’s personal fortune fell by as much as 9.2% as the Mexican peso plunged by 
13% before stabilizing at 8% down. The nation’s central bank governor and 
finance minister were forced to reassure the nation that the country’s finances 
are safe.

The top 10 Mexican billionaires on the Bloomberg’s index lost a combined 
$6.5bn. Overall, the world’s wealthiest people lost $41bn.
 
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has emailed all his employees, calling on business 
leaders and government officials to listen to the disenfranchised working class 
voters who helped deliver Trump the election. He said they showed a “deep 
desire for change”.

Here is the full text of his memo (highlights, ours): 

Dear colleagues,

We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around 
the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting 
to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard 
through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the 
frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and 
the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices.

We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, 
which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it 
more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together 
Americans from all walks of life.Recognizing that our diversity is a core 
strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve 
our most serious challenges.

Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to 
collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and 
greater opportunity for all.

America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the 
political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one 
should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.

J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our 
countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that 
will continue to thrive – as we continue to focus on helping to serve our 
clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important 
public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges 
throughout the world.

I’m optimistic about America’s future and the role our company will continue 
to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together.

<https://twitter.com/RupertNeate/status/796407917746458624> 
Private prison operator Corrections of America surged by as much as 60% in 
early trading before settling back at a 41% increase. Rival operator GEO Group 
was also up 18%.

The companies are soaring as analysts reckon that Trump will row back on the 
Department of Justice’s ruling this summer to phase out privately run jails. 
The companies could benefit still further from Trump’s plan for the mass 
deportation of immigrants.

Analysts at Height Securities said: 

Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his 
administration will likely rescind the DOJ’s contract phase-out and ICE 
[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come 
under further stress.

Oil companies are benefiting from Trump’s pledge to make America “energy 
independent”, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas. 
He has also vowed withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to 
end the “billions and billion and billions” given to UN climate programmes and 
clean energy development.

Big pharma companies are also gaining, as Hillary Clinton had pledged to bring 
in controls to prevent pharmaceutical companies from hiking the price of drugs 
following recent scandals. Shares in Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, 
are up 7%.
 
There’s never much room for sentiment in the financial markets.

And over on Wall Street, the S&P 500 index had hit its highest level in a 
month - just as Hillary Clinton was giving her first speech since the election.

The index has now gained 1% since trading opened, touching levels last seen in 
early October.

After a wild day’s trading, European stock markets have ended the day with 
solid gains.

In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed 1% higher at 6911.8.

That’s quite a turnaround, given the index plunged by 2% at the start of the 
trading day (just as Donald Trump’s victory was confirmed).

Wall Street is betting that the prospect of reforming America’s gun laws faded 
last night, sending shares of the US’s two largest gun companies sliding by 10% 
today.

Sam Thielman reports:


Donald Trump’s election effectively puts an end to the gun control legislation 
proposed by Democrats. Under Barack Obama, gun companies have enjoyed record 
breaking sales and share price growth driven by fears that he would tighten 
rules on sales following a series of mass shootings.

Smith & Wesson’s shares were down 10.21% and shares of Sturm Ruger were down 
12.29% in early morning trading.

US stocks are moving higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 
100 points, or 0.5%.

So much for the Trump slump....

Pharmaceuticals companies, infrastructure providers and banking stocks are 
leading the way (for reasons explained earlier).

Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says investors have digested the 
election result with impressive speed. But the long-term implications of the 
result simply aren’t known yet.

The narrative seems to be that Trump’s presidential promises during his 
victory speech have reassured investors, allowing for the remarkable recovery 
seen this afternoon. The market may also be correcting the intensely negative 
gut reaction it had to the result, much as it did in the aftermath of the 
Brexit.

Simply it is too early to tell what exactly President Trump has in store, 
something that may make for a rocky rest of November, even if today has 
confounded expectations market-wise.

The US dollar has now risen since Wall Street opened, reversing its overnight 
losses.

Some analysts are arguing that Trump’s victory doesn’t rule out a hike in US 
interest rates in December.

And if he does cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and impose trade 
curbs, then inflation would rise and the Fed might raise borrowing costs faster 
than currently anticipated in 2017 and 2018. That makes the dollar a more 
attractive asset.
