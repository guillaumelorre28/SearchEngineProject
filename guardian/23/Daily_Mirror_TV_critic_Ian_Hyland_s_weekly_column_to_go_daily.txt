The Daily Mirror <https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror> is looking 
to take a version of highly-rated TV critic Ian Hyland’s column five days a 
week, as the newspaper looks to keep pace with the trend for more frequent TV 
reviews.

Hyland, one of the best known and highly regarded TV critics in the UK, 
currently writes a weekly column for the Daily Mirror.


However, it is understood that the historical idea of a weekly column is 
becoming outdated in the fast-paced modern digital and social media world.

It is not known when Hyland’s weekly column will be discontinued and when the 
new five-day strategy is to be implemented.

Trinity Mirror declined to comment on the plans, which are yet to be finalised.

The 46-year-old, who began his career as a show business columnist on the 
Sunday Mirror in 2000, has written a weekly column for the Mirror since joining 
from the Mail on Sunday in 2013.


He spent two years at the Mail on Sunday, joining from the News of the World 
which was shut in 2011 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.


In January, the Sunday Mirror’s TV critic, Kevin O’Sullivan, left after 10 
years with the newspaper

News of O’Sullivan’s column being dropped sparked an outpouring on social 
media, including support from former Mirror editor Piers Morgan and TV 
presenter Matthew Wright, and more than1,100 people signed an online petition

 to get him reinstated.
