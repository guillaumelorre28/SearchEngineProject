Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I am in the strange position of applying for a job I don’t want. I work in a 
tiny team in a small company that is expanding and consequently our workload 
has increased enormously, so a senior position has been advertised in our team. 
The role includes responsibilities I do not want to take on as I don’t want 
additional stress, but the job description also includes areas in which I am 
acknowledged as being the company expert. (It’s a niche industry so these 
skills are not directly transferable).

My boss is aware that I don’t think some aspects of the job are within my 
skill set, but has advised me to apply anyway. I think this is a benchmarking 
exercise, but I have to accept that I would not be happy if the job went to 
someone I felt was less qualified than me.

I don’t know how to approach the application and interview in these 
circumstances. How common are benchmarking interviews and what would you advise?
