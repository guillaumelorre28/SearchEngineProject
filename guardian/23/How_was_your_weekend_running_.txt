So. six days until Berlin marathon. It’s all been going well: good track 
sessions in training, no injuries (touch wood) and on Saturday I got a 5k PB at
Fulham Palace parkrun <http://www.parkrun.org.uk/fulhampalace/> (18m 42sec and 
before you ask - yes it is fine and normal and perfectly usual to do a 5k race 
a week before a marathon). While having a bad 5k race is fairly meaningless in 
the context of marathon prep, having a good one and getting a PB is obviously a 
nice confidence boost. Then a 10 miler yesterday for my last “long” run. So, as 
I say, all going well.

Too well? Well, I’m currently praying to the gods of hygiene and those of 
marathon running, and inhaling a cloud of Dettol, because my seven year old has 
come down with a particularly nasty strain of the norovirus. Anyone got a 
Hazmat suit I can borrow to give her a comforting hug in? Any handy tips about 
how to get her to drink any fluids? How to avoid germs, other than the liberal 
use of bleach and handwashing so much I think my skin may fall off? Or, err, 
anyone got a hotel I can move into for the duration instead?

So, as usual, please share your own weekend triumphs and woes below the line 
as always. Just make sure you are germ-free, ok?
