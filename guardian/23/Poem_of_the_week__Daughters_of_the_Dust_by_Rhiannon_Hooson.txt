Daughters of the Dust

There can be no mermaids of the steppe
though its bare hills roll and boom like the sea. Only
some strange creature, lithe in the gelid dust
and furred like a fox: silent, accusing in the eyes,
a deep wind parting fur down to bone coloured skin.
Horizons pile thin as paper one atop the next
and they spin their story into the pinched air: a woman,
and a wish, and a corsac fox. Nights

of the great white zud they might dance away the snow,
leaving paths of grass for the herd to eat, or else
rise like walls to blow across the landscape
stately and slow and sickening, only the chiming ice
singing their welcome with its spare high notes,
each like the prick of a needle. And in the city,
where the nights smell of sweet smoke and milk
and idling traffic, they go walking now:

silent over the glaze of blood frozen to the ground
around the wrestling palace. Silent in the alleys
where stray dogs sleep in the warmth from sewer grates.
Silent past the cafes where soldiers thaw their brows
over salt milk tea. Silent, until they are singing,
each alone in the dim reaches of the night,
each pale as an unlit candle, up through the gers
where the roads falter and the lights go out; up to the mountain
where the wind sings back; towering, and tidal, and old.

The sweep of the rhythm in Daughters of the Dust evokes the rolling Mongolian 
steppe <http://all-that-is-interesting.com/mongolia-nomads> that is its setting 
and, more broadly, suggests the movement of wind and weather, nomads and 
horses, and, perhaps, vaster trajectories of modern travel and migration.
Rhiannon Hooson <http://rhiannonhooson.blogspot.co.uk/p/bio.html> is a young 
Welsh poet whose imagination is sometimes engrossed by her native country, but 
is clearly not constrained by it.The Other City 
<https://www.serenbooks.com/author/rhiannon-hooson> is her first full 
collection, although an earlier pamphlet included Daughters of the Dust: you 
can reada little more about its inception here 
<http://rhiannonhooson.blogspot.co.uk/p/blog-page_1847.html>. 


 Having dismissed the unlikely notion of Mongolian mermaids, the speaker sets 
out to find their geographically appropriate equivalent. The time-honoured 
fictional device (of starting a story with “not this, but possibly this”) is 
the portal into myth and more – a sombre, intensely imagined celebration of a 
real place. Notice the music as you read – and how the erratic-seeming use of 
commas, some unexpectedly absent, others carefully present, denotes pace and 
pause.

 It’s not until the end of the first stanza that the speaker begins her 
conjury by setting out the three ingredients – “a woman, / and a wish, and a 
corsac fox”. These are the elements that will “spin their story into the 
pinched air”.

 From a first reluctant materialisation, “silent, accusing in the eyes”, 
springs a progeny of dusty sisters of the steppe. They are identified closely 
with the landscape, or at least belong to it with less ambiguity than the sad, 
hybrid mermaid belongs to the sea. Charm and seduction aren’t their game. In 
the first stanza, they are almost grammatically entwined with the paper-thin 
horizons forming the subject of the sentence in line six. They dance, like 
wind-blown dust or blizzards. But they also rise in the form of perambulating 
“walls … / stately and slow and sickening”.

 Mirroring the first stanza, the second concludes with another magic 
threesome, a triad that this time evokes the city night, and a druggy “smell of 
sweet smoke and milk / and idling traffic”. In a potent image signalling 
earlier, perhaps state-sanctioned, violence, the daughters glide “silent over 
the glaze of blood frozen to the ground / around the wrestling palace”. The 
adverb silent occurs four times in this stanza, emphasising the tenacity and 
subtlety ofthe dérive <http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html>. 
Although they’re clearly at home in the less salubrious recesses of the city 
(Ulaanbaatar, I presume) the dust-daughters seem on the whole neutral, neither 
motheringly protective nor witchily malignant. They are the embodiment of any 
natural order, even urbanisation. It seems right, though, that at the end of 
the poem they should be subsumed by the wind; the latter being imagined, after 
all, as a kind of sea, “towering, and tidal, and old”. So the daughters are 
both present and past: they are history itself. The final adjective finds their 
cosmic essence in its very sound.

 Sensations of pure, painful cold are evoked in the descriptions of the 
high-pitched, needle-like singing, the image of the “deep wind parting fur down 
to bone coloured skin”, and, by contrast, in the warm, relieving snapshots of 
the dogs basking by the sewer gratings and “the cafes where soldiers thaw their 
brows / over salt milk tea”.

 It would be interesting to compare Hooson’s topographical approach with that 
of Auden’s sestina,Paysage Moralisé 
<http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ian/paysage.html>. Auden’s term originated in 
a sometimes-questionedart-historical classification 
<http://wiki.williams.edu/display/ARTH400500/Paysage+Moralise> and the 
designation seems over-narrow for his beautiful, ominous “moralised landscape”. 
In the case of Hooson’s, the connection is looser still. Daughters of the Dust 
utters no sermons. Yet it gently validates equality of cultural values. It’s 
distinct from the average travel poem in not merely reflecting a different 
culture, however sensitively, but entering into its making. This is not 
appropriation but connection. Dips into phrasebook and guidebook are 
imaginatively earned, from the “corsac fox 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsac_fox>” and the “ger” (yurt) to the “zud 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zud>” (severe, livestock-threatening winter 
weather) and the salty tea, for which I’ve foundwhat I hope is an authentic 
recipe 
<http://hopieskitchen.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/mongolian-salt-tea-guest-post-by.html>
. Such words can seem like ideograms: they register as sharp new shapes or 
colour spots, but merge easily, on a second reading, into the poem’s texture. 
The imaginative engagement they’re part of forms the moral obverse of 
“othering” and divisive, east v west constructions. In narrative terms, the 
visitor not only receives but offers the host a share of the yarn, and the 
story becomes collaborative, as all real stories are.
