Former Essendon coach James Hird

“I am shocked by this decision. I firmly believe the players do not deserve 
this finding. They do not deserve to face a 12-month suspension from the sport. 
This is a miscarriage of justice for 34 young men.”

AFL Players Association CEO Paul Marsh


“We have maintained our position that the players have done nothing wrong. 
Nothing today has changed our view. The players took all reasonable steps to 
assure themselves that what they were being given was compliant with theWada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wada> code. They [the players] are the 
victims, not the perpetrators. They deserve our sympathy, not our scorn.”
AFL Players (@AFLPlayers) 
"I don't have a great deal of faith in the WADA regime, and ASADA's part of 
that. I'll be criticised for saying that, but I don't care."

AFL Commission chairman Mike Fitzpatrick

“The program at Essendon Football Club in 2012 was a stain on our game. This 
has been a very dark period. The last four years will not define theEssendon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> Football Club. The integrity of 
our competition, the health of our players, are the most important things in 
our game.”

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan

“It is our view that they [the players] have been horribly let down by the 
[Essendon] administration of the time. TheAFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> will support the players and the club 
through this period but these suspensions must stand.”

Former Wada president John Fahey

 “The reality of the matter is that the individual player is the responsible 
party. The strict liability applies to every athlete in the world, including 
Essendon players or any football player. That’s the simple facts of how the 
code works.”

Former Essendon player Matthew Lloyd

“It opens a pandora’s box – it’s Essendon’s and the AFL’s worst nightmare. 
Players have lost their careers, lost their livelihoods, the stress on the 
families, themselves. Probably another write off for Essendon in regards to 
playing finals football – how much can the supporters take it anymore? That’s 
devastating for everyone involved in the AFL fraternity.”

Sports minister Susan Ley

“Regardless of the outcome, this case has also highlighted clear community 
expectations that clubs and their coaching staff do have a moral obligation to 
care for a player’s health and safety. Athletes take guidance from those 
leading them and should be able to trust in the institutions through which they 
compete.”

Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten 

“My thoughts are first and foremost not about trying to say Liberal or Labor, 
who is better, who is worse. These young players are the meat in the sandwich 
... caught up in something which they never, from what I’ve seen, understood.”

The greatest miscarriage of sporting justice ever. Kangaroo courts really do 
exist. 34 players guilty? Majority verdict? No appeal?Go figure

 Asada CEO Ben McDevitt

 “This unfortunate episode has chronicled the most devastating self-inflicted 
injury by a sporting club in Australian history. There were very little grounds 
for the players to claim they were at no significant fault.”

Fairfax columnist Roy Masters

“The relentless and ultimately successful pursuit of Essendon by anti-doping 
agencies for a guilty verdict and a meaningful suspension was driven by their 
conviction that if an AFL Tribunal had heard the case against Lance Armstrong, 
the American cyclist would still have seven Tour de France titles.”

Wow. Heart goes out to Essendon players! U r 'conditioned' to trust ur coaches 
& club. Hired to 'comply' to directives. They arent at fault!

Port Adelaide general manager of football Chris Davies 

“Clearly, we are extremely disappointed with today’s outcome and in particular 
we are devastated for Angus [Monfries] and Paddy [Ryder] who have been through 
so much already. This has been a long, drawn out process for both of them and 
we are most unhappy that it has ended with such a significant suspension. First 
and foremost, we will look to support Angus and Paddy in every possible way 
during their time on the sidelines. We are very proud as to how Angus and Paddy 
have handled this whole process and as a club we will stand by them all the 
way.”

Positive for @AFL <https://twitter.com/AFL> : Easily the most poorly handled 
prolonged scandal of any pro sport EVER! (Or so it seems) So at least there is 
that......

I've got no sympathy at all for the #Essendon 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Essendon?src=hash> players. Even semi-pro athletes 
get extensive doping education with ASADA. There's no excuse.
