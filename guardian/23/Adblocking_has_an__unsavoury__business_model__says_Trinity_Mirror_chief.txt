Adblocking has a “pretty unsavoury” business model, the chief executive of the 
Daily Mirror publisher,Trinity Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/trinity-mirror>, has said.

“The business model of adblocking is a pretty unsavoury one,” Simon Fox said 
at an Enders Analysis conference on Tuesday.


“They offer software for free [to consumers] and then come to us and say ‘your 
site’s OK so if you pay us we will ensure ads on your sites get through’. There 
is something extremely unhealthy about this business model.”

His words echo those of culture secretary John Whittingdale, who last week 
said the government will look into taking action against adblocking companies, 
calling the business model a“modern day protection racket”

.

Fox also said that attempts by publishers to counter adblocking have turned 
into a technological game of cat and mouse.

“It is also becoming a war of technology,” he said. “As we come up with ways 
to detect adblocking software they come up with other way. It is a war, you 
have to be constantly updating.”

Last month, mobile company Three said that it is to introduce adblocking 
across its UK and Italian networks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/19/mobile-operator-three-ad-blocking>
, the first major European operator to do so.

David Pemsel, chief executive of Guardian Media Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/guardianmediagroup>, said he had written a 
letter to David Dyson, the chief executive of Three, about the issue. He said 
internet companies blocking ads at a network level was a “massive move”.

Pemsel also questioned the motives of companies such as Three that claim 
network-wide adblocking is being considered to protect consumers from unwanted 
ads.

“Is this generally about protecting consumers or do they want a slice of the 
[advertising] pie?” he said.

Pemsel also pointed to tensions between publishers and digital companies keen 
to strike deals to offer their content – saying that Applehad been eager to get 
partners for its news service, but then updated its operating system to enable 
adblocking.

“We all have a role to play here,” he said, acknowledging that publishers and 
ad agencies have to look at how they operate. “Perhaps we have lost sight [to 
an extent]. We have this quality real estate … and stuffed it full of ads. At 
the same time journalism needs to be paid for.”

Some analysts have argued that ISPs or mobile networks that block ads could 
face legal challenges under EU law, citing a precedentin France

.

Martin Morgan, chief executive of Daily Mail and Mail Online owner Daily Mail 
& General Trust, said he “suspected” that the solution to adblocking will not 
end up being a legislative one.

“It hasn’t affected us that much yet,” he said. “We are certainly not 
complacent about it. I couldn’t agree more that we have to work even harder in 
terms of content. And being mindful of the advertising we are serving is a 
challenge of innovation. We are finding Google good to work with. We are 
optimistic about our relationship with Facebook. These relationships will 
evolve.”

Will Lewis – chief executive of Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones a former 
senior executive at Sun and Times owner News Corporation – backed the virtues 
of a pay strategy.

“Adblocking is not going away anytime soon,” he said. “We are unlikely to find 
a new law to make this go away. It will come onto mobile, it will come onto 
apps. At some point everyone involved in high quality journalism should ask 
people to fund our journalism by paying it. It’s a mug’s game to remain reliant 
on advertising.”
