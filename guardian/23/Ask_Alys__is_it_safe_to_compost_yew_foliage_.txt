Having recently removed much of a yew tree, I now have a lot of shredded 
foliage to deal with. I’m aware that yew contains some very toxic biochemicals, 
as well as some useful ones, so can I safely add it to the compost bin?
Add a bit at a time, until you get through it all, making the layers thin and 
composting as you always have, and there should be no issues (other than it 
could take a long time). Alternatively, build a big pile of the foliage, wet 
it, then cover with plastic and leave the clippings to rot on their own. This, 
too, will take some time, but since it’s foliage, and not wood chippings, I 
wouldn’t imagine it would take too long. Any toxicity will be broken down in 
the composting process; if you’re unsure that it’s fully composted, use the 
results as a mulch for paths or under established trees and bushes, where it 
will break down with no ill-effect to surrounding plants.

There are two companies that will pay for yew clippings to use in the 
manufacture of chemotherapy drugs: Havant-basedlimehurst.co.uk 
<http://www.limehurst.co.uk> and friendshipestates.co.uk 
<http://www.friendshipestates.co.uk> in Doncaster. Unfortunately your yew tree 
clippings will not be suitable, but gardeners with large hedges to cut every 
summer should take note.
