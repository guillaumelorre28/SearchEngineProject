girls inSwaziland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/swaziland> had experienced 
sexual violence before turning 18.


This data triggered African governments into action. Policymakers from various 
sectors joined with leaders from civil society organisations to find how to

A global movement is underway. In May 2014, 20 countries came together for a 
landmark event in Swaziland, where everything first began.
