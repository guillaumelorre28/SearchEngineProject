girls inSwaziland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/swaziland> had experienced 
sexual violence before turning 18.


This data triggered African governments into action. Policymakers from various 
sectors joined with leaders from civil society organisations to find how to

landmark event in Swaziland, where everything first began.
