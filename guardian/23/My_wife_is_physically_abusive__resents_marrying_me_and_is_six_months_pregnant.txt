I am a man in my mid-30s, and my wife is physically abusive. This is difficult 
to talk about, not just because of the man-woman thing, but also because I’m 
from a more traditional country, and things aren’t the same there. My wife 
started pushing and slapping me early in our marriage, but this has descended 
to scratching, kicking and punching. When co-workers see me with a black eye, I 
make excuses. She complains that I don’t spend enough money on her. Recently, 
she told me that she resents marrying me and finds me ugly. She is also six 
months pregnant, and has never had a job. I haven’t told anyone about the abuse 
and don’t know what to do. My father was very abusive to my mother and I vowed 
never to be the same, but it takes a lot of restraint. Should I leave my wife?
