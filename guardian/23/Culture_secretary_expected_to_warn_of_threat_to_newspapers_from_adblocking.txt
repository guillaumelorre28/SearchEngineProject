Culture secretary John Whittingdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-whittingdale> is expected to warn of 
the dangers of adblocking for the newspaper industry in a speech on Wednesday.

Speaking a day after the publication of an independent report into BBC 
governance, Whittingdale is also set to backthe Clementi report’s central 
recommendations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/01/bbc-regulation-ofcom-trust-david-clementi>
 – that the BBC Trust should be scrapped and regulatory oversight of the 
corporation handed to Ofcom.

Whittingdale’s speech at the Oxford Media Convention comes in the wake of the 
announcement that the Independent will drop its print edition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/11/independent-owner-considering-closing-national-print-titles>
 and other signs that the shift online is causing havoc with newspaper revenues.

A report earlier this week showed that more than 9 million Britons use 
adblockers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/01/more-than-nine-million-brits-now-use-adblockers>
, which cut a further source of online revenue for the newspaper industry.

Coming a day after the DCMS published a report into the impact of BBC 
entertainment on commercial rivals, however, the culture secretary’s speech 
will fuel concerns within the BBC that the department is focusing on its 
possible impact on the market.

 The fact that Whittingdale is not expected to focus exclusively on the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> and broadcasting in his first major 
speech for months is likely to fuel fears that the white paper renewing the 
BBC’s royal charter has not even been drafted. There are increasing concerns 
that the planned EU referendum in June has caused further delay.

 A report by the Commons culture, media and sport select committee earlier 
this year warned that publishing the white paper in July would not leave enough 
time for parliamentary and public debate.
