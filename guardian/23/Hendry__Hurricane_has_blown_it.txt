Alex Higgins is a "down and out" who won't win a match on his comeback, 
according to seven-times world championStephen Hendry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/stephen-hendry>.

The 53-year-old Ulsterman, who has been out of the game for five years after 
battling throat cancer, is entering the Benson and Hedges qualifying tournament 
on October 23 as well as the Embassy World Championship next April.

Although Hendry thinks Higgins is past it, he feels the former world champion 
should be given one last chance.

"Although he clearly wouldn't live with the players of today, this guy is 
pretty much down and out and you cannot kick him when he is down," Hendry said. 
"At least give him the chance of achieving some glory.

"It is also good publicity for the game, though I don't envisage him winning a 
match."

Hendry credits Higgins, nicknamed Hurricane, with selling snooker to a wider 
audience. "What some players have to learn is that, without Higgins, this game 
wouldn't be where it is now," he told the Daily Telegraph.

Higgins won the world championship in 1972 and 1982 but clashes with authority 
have punctuated his colourful career.

A heavy smoker, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998. And when he 
appeared in a TV documentary two years later, viewers were shocked at the frail 
figure he cut.

Undeterred by his illness, or by its casues, Higgins will meet 22-year-old 
English hopeful Lee Spick in the qualifiers of the Benson and Hedges tournament 
on October 23.
