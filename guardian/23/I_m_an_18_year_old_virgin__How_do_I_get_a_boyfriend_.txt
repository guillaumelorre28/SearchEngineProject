I am a woman of almost 19, and have never kissed anyone, and am still a 
virgin. I’m also socially awkward. To top my list of woes, I attend a women’s 
college. It is a fabulous place, but the dearth of testosterone doesn’t help 
much. I’m no supermodel, but I’ve been told at times that I’m quite good 
looking. What should I do (and not ever do) if I want to get a boyfriend? I’ve 
tried online dating and nothing has worked out so far.
