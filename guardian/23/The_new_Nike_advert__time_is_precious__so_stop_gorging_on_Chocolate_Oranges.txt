Yuck, here comes January: dark, joyless and dispiritingly cold, despite the 
globular rolls of fat you’ve accumulated round the middle after consuming 
nothing but Chocolate Oranges, stilton and Tia Maria over Chrimbo.

Is there a worse month to attempt a lifestyle reboot? While slimming down to 
sinew feels like an impossible dream,Nike 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nike> has taken the hardbody ideal to 
heart, launching a global campaign that consists of nothing more than an 
automated female voice reading an accusatory tirade.

 Time is Precious 
Basically, this is Radiohead’s sadsack robo-manifesto Fitter Happier 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HimvFbossU8> – AKA The Most Skipped Track In 
Rock History – with an injection of fire emoji sass, calling us all out for 
spending 10 hours a day glued to our black mirrors when we could be pulling on 
trackie Bs. Forget bingeing on Narcos, fingering Tinder or tweeting to a 
handful of (likely fake) followers: time is precious, so go running instead.

Cramming this Trainspotting-ish takedown into just one minute apparently 
leaves no time to mention the thudding boredom, mortar-and-pestled knee 
cartilage and weirdly sore teeth familiar to any infrequent jogger. Back to 
Narcos it is, then.
