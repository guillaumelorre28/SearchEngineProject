The initiative, organised by a trade association representing online

“For our 400 journalists to provide you each day with high-quality, reliable 
and varied news each day ... we must be able to rely on advertising revenue,” 
read a message from Jerome Fenoglio, the editor-in-chief of French daily Le 
Monde, to users running adblocker software.

While Le Monde then let users continue on to its website, others such as those 
of sports daily L’Equipe and Le Parisien require users to disable their 
adblockers.

In addition to the websites of numerous French print, radio and television 
websites, the action was also joined by Deezer, a France-based music streaming 
service.

In announcing its plans in 2015 to organise joint actions against adblocker 
software, the Geste trade association said the objective was to remind users 
that “content and services aren’t free” and emphasise “the indispensible 
character of advertising as a source of financing”.


Nearly one-third of French internet users run adblocker software, according to 
a survey published by research firm Ipsos.
