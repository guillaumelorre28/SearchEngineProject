<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> season, dropping a season-high 19 
points as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Celtics 109-103 in Boston.

The big highlight from Mills came at the end of the third quarter when the 
Australian gave the Spurs the three-quarter time lead with a three-pointer from 
Steph Curry range.

The Australian dribbled down to just past half-court before draining a sweet 
shot from the edge of the centre circle to give the Spurs a 75-74 lead at the 
final break.

Mills wasn’t done though after Isaiah Thomas cut San Antonio’s lead to three 
at 104-101 with a corner three with a minute left on the clock.

The Aussie doubled back off a Manu Ginobili screen to find space in the corner 
and drain the three-pointer.

It meant the guard bagged 13 of his points tally came in the second half after 
the Spurs struggled to get out of the blocks.

It was Mills, along with Kawhi Leonard who had 25 points and 10 rebounds, that 
got them back into the game.

Boston got out to a 28-14 lead late in the first quarter before the Spurs 
started to reel them in thanks to a zone defence that completely shut down the 
Celtics offence.

For six minutes in the second term the Celtics failed to score as the Spurs 
kept them rooted to 38 points until Jonas Jerebko eventually made a driving 
hook shot as Boston held on for the halftime lead.
