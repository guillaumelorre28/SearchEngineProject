Shaun the Sheep has beaten Postman Pat and Sooty and Sweep to top a poll of 
favouriteBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> children's TV characters 
from the last 70 years.

The Aardman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> creation, who made his 
debut in the 1995 Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave and was given his own 
series in 2007, triumphed in a poll of the best BBC children's characters, 
beating Postman Pat into second place.

The shortlist put together by Radio Times and the British Film Institute 
attracted more than 41,000 votes. It featured shows from the 1950s to the 
present day including The Magic Roundabout, Paddington, Willo The Wisp, The 
Wombles, Teletubbies and In The Night Garden. Sooty and Sweep came third.

Another BBC children's character, SuperTed, is the latest classic children's 
show to be revived but the series, which aired in the 1980s, will be given a 
makeover for its 21st century audience, said its creator Mike Young.

"Popeye used to smash people in the face. And it was very funny. But of course 
there is no television network anywhere in the world that would let you do that 
now," Young told Radio Times.

Radio Times editor Ben Preston said: "Every generation has a favourite which 
lingers for a lifetime. Our winner, Shaun the Sheep, will be remembered in 50 
years' time, just as the children of the 80s voted for Postman Pat, and Sooty 
and Sweep remain hugely popular almost 60 years after they were first broadcast.

"It's a testament to the enduring quality of British children's television 
that a contemporary character topped the poll in a shortlist filled with 
classic programmes from the last seven decades."

Other children's TV shows being brought back for a new generation include 
Danger Mouse, the Clangers, Teletubbies and Thunderbirds.
