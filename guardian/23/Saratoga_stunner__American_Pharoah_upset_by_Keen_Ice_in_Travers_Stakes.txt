The Graveyard of Champions claimed another favorite on Saturday afternoon at 
Saratoga Race Course, when Keen Ice ran downAmerican Pharoah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/american-pharoah> in the lane to deny him 
victory in the Travers Stakes.

In defeat, American Pharoah joins Gallant Fox, Secretariat and Affirmed as 
Triple Crown winners that came to Saratoga and lost, along with a host of other 
champions and favorites to be bested by the track in Saratoga Springs.

The loss was American Pharoah’s first since last August, when he lost his 
first race, the defeat interrupting an eight-race winning streak.

As he did in the Belmont Stakes

, American Pharoah went to the front under jockey Victor Espinoza. But unlike 
that race, where he was allowed a largely uncontested lead, American Pharoah 
was harangued early and steadily in the Travers by Frosted, the Belmont Stakes 
runner-up, ridden by substitute jockey Jose Lezcano after Joel Rosario, named 
to ride Frosted, was injured earlier in the card.

Tracking him insistently, Frosted pounced heading into the far turn of the 
10-furlong Travers, only to be repelled by American Pharoah. But by that time, 
Keen Ice and jockey Javier Castellano had made their move, running down a 
wearying American Pharoah and passing him late to win by three-quarters of a 
length.

 Keen Ice overtook American Pharoah after the Triple Crown winner had been 
tested steadily by Belmont Stakes runner-up Frosted. 
Said a disconsolate Espinoza, “Maybe it was just a little too much for those 
three weeks (between the Haskell and the Travers), flying back and forth. He 
was running pretty comfortable there, but not like he used to. By the half-mile 
pole, I knew I was in trouble.”

Espinoza also said that, unlike his other races, the horse was anxious going 
into the starting gate.

“We gambled,” said trainer Bob Baffert. “He showed us all that signs that he 
was ready to go, but you really don’t know until they actually run.”

Baffert and owner Ahmed Zayat had delayed a decision on whether to run 
American Pharoah at Saratoga until last Sunday, when an impressive workout 
convinced them to head east for the third time in three months.

Though the plan had been to run American Pharoah in the Breeders’ Cup Classic 
at Keeneland in Kentucky in late October, Zayat put that plan in doubt 
immediately after the race.

“My gut feeling right now is to retire him,” he said.

Zayat has already signed a stallion deal for undisclosed terms with Coolmore, 
based in Lexington, Kentucky. Whether he retires now or after the Breeders’ 
Cup, his stud career will begin early next year.

Keen Ice came to the Travers with one win to his credit, that coming a year 
ago at Churchill Downs. Third in the Belmont and second in the Haskell, he 
didn’t exactly garner the public’s confidence, sent off at odds of 16-1 and 
paying $34.00 to win.

“This horse is a different horse since coming out of the Haskell,” maintained 
trainer Dale Romans. “He trained sharp all week.”

“American Pharoah’s legacy is not tarnished in any way,” he went on. 
“Secretariat got beat, Seattle Slew got beat, Affirmed got beat.”

Keen Ice was ridden by Javier Castellano, who set a record in winning his 
fifth Travers Stakes, more than any other jockey. The win was Romans’ first in 
the Travers and first at this summer’s racing meeting.

Fifteen thousand people showed up at Saratoga on Friday morning to see 
American Pharoah work over the traffic, and the New York Racing Association 
sold out all 50,000 tickets it put on sale for the event. NYRA capped 
attendance for the Travers for the first time this year.

But as much as the crowd wanted to see the Triple Crown winner add to his 
victories at Saratoga, they cheered for Castellano and Keen Ice, appreciating a 
hard-fought race at one of the country’s most historic racetracks.

The Louisville-based Romans said that Keen Ice will point towards the 
Breeders’ Cup Classic, where he may or may get a chance at a rematch with 
American Pharoah. While more non-committal than Zayat about the horse’s future, 
Baffert wouldn’t speculate on what might happen next.

“I want to see how taxing this race was on him,” he said. “This is something 
we have to sit and figure out.

“I’m not really used to being in the position with him, so it’s sort of hard 
to digest right now.”

He added, “It’s going to be a long plane ride home.”
