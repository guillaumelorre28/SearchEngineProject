Avram Grant <https://www.theguardian.com/football/avram-grant> faces a 
possible touchline ban after being charged with improper conduct by the 
Football Association for comments he made about Mike Jones, the referee who 
oversaw West Ham United's 2-1 defeat by Stoke City on Sunday in the FA Cup 
quarter-final.

The West Ham manager accused Jones of being "weak", suggesting that because 
the official missed Frédéric Piquionne handling the ball before equalising for 
West Ham he then compensated by favouring Stoke in his decisions until Danny 
Higginbotham's winner.

Grant said: "I think maybe [Piquionne's goal] is the reason the referee 
started the second half very, very strangely. Until they scored the goal [by 
Higginbotham], he gave fouls and penalties, everything for them. But it was a 
penalty for us at the end and he didn't give it. Maybe he felt a little bit 
weak."

A statement released by the governing body said: "The FA has today charged 
West Ham United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> manager 
Avram Grant with improper conduct relating to media comments. The charge 
relates to comments made about match official Mike Jones in post-match 
interviews following West Ham United's fixture with Stoke City at the Britannia 
Stadium on Sunday 13 March 2011. Grant has until 4pm on 21 March to respond to 
the charge."

It is not known if Grant will deny or accept the charge. But he may take note 
of Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to fight the same count, and the Manchester 
United manager on Wednesday then receiving a five-game touchline ban – two of 
which were from a suspended sentence – and a £30,000 fine for comments he made 
following Manchester United's defeat at Chelsea this month.

If Grant is found guilty he could be warned, fined and/or banned. His 
previously clean disciplinary record with the FA would count in his favour when 
any punishment is decided.
