AO World <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ao-world> stock slid 3.5% after 
its chairman, Richard Rose, sold 5.58m shares in the online electrical goods 
retailer.

The company revealed that on Friday Rose let go of a 1.3% stake in the company 
at a price of 180p, a hefty discount to AO’s float price of 285p when it joined 
the stock market last year.

The £10m sale comes after the retailer’s shares crashed late last month when 
it issued a profit warning

 and admitted it may have been a victim of flotation hype.

At the time, John Roberts, the chief executive, said the company had 
experienced tough trading conditions in the final quarter of last year after 
the loss of a logistics contract and the effects of the Black Friday discount 
day, which condensed sales into a shorter time period without increasing them.

But Roberts insisted that AO was not overvalued when it floated and said the 
company remained “a fast-growing e-commerce business”.

On Monday, Roberts said Rose’s share sale followed the expiry of a lock-up 
period following the company’s initial public offering and would help to 
increase liquidity and the number of shares in public hands.

He said Rose retained a significant holding in the firm, adding: “Richard 
remains committed to the company, both as a shareholder and as its chairman.”

Rose is also a non-executive chairman of the groceries wholesaler Booker 
Group, Crawshaw, the butchers, and agricultural feed supplier Anpario. He was 
previously chief executive of the tea retail specialist Whittard of Chelsea.

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “After the recent profit 
warning, you can’t blame the poor guy for bailing out … but it is amazing that 
a non-exec had such a big shareholding in the first place.”
