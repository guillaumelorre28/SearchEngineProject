That’s all from me on a day that belongs to Rule The World, his teenage 
debutant jockey David Mullins, and trainer Mouse Morris, who adds to his Irish 
National triumph, a year after his son passed away. Here’s Chris Cook’s race 
report from a dramatic day. Thanks for joining me, and don’t spend those 
winnings all at once.Bye!

Rule The World had never won over jumps, and hadn’t won a race since January 
2014. The 33-1 shot won by six lengths from The Last Samuri, a joint favourite 
whose trainer, Kim Bailey, can scarcely believe was overtaken at the last, with 
Vics Canvas, a 13-year-old available at 100-1, finishing third. There’s really 
no point trying to predict this race.

Good news: all horses and riders have made it back safely. There were only 12 
finishers in tough conditions. Spare a thought for Bryan Cooper, who had his 
pick from two Mouse Morris-trained rides. He picked First Lieutenant, who fell 
at the second and never recovered, and left Rule the World to Mullins. Ouch!

Here’s David Mullins: “I couldn’t have expected things to go better... 
everything went to plan really. Credit to Mouse, he’s a genius... I’d never 
walked round this course before today”

Clare Balding has just tried to interview Mouse Morris, but the trainer, who 
also won the Irish National this year, could barely get a word out.

One man never short of a word or two is the owner, Michael O’Leary (he of 
Ryanair): “Coming to win the race on his first attempt... it was a masterful 
ride”. O’Leary’s Gigginstown House Stud also gave him a Gold Cup win earlier 
this year.

O’Leary says hello to his children, on the verge of tears, then hollers “free 
flights for everyone!” OK, I made the last bit up.

The Last Samuri and Vics Canvas jump the last as one, with Rule the World 
close behind... it will be between these three, surely... and Rule the World 
gets up on the inside... he has too much pace for the joint favourite... and he 
romps away to win by a distance!

The horses are galloping down to the starting line. The Last Samuri and Many 
Clouds are joint favourites at 8-1, with Goonyella, who is likely to enjoy 
these conditions, down to 10-1. Plenty of outside bets coming in rapidly, 
including The Romford Pele and Katenko...

Five minutes to go, as Laura Wright belts out ‘God Save the Queen’. Are you 
with the betting public, andChris Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/talking-horses-racing-tips-grand-national-aintree-the-last-samuri>
, in backingThe Last Samuri? Do you, like AP McCoy, like the look of Gallant 
Oscar, or are you with most of the tipsters in picking Holywell? Whoever you’ve 
picked, be lucky. It’s likely to be a testing race; obviously, we hope all 
horses and riders make it back unharmed.

The going on the Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> course has just been changed 
to ‘Soft, Heavy in places’ after all the rain last night and today. That is 
even more testing than most of us were imagining when we made our calculations. 
It will make for fewer finishers but should also reduce the risk of injury to 
horses and jockeys, as the field will go slower and there will be more give 
underfoot if they fall. It is very good news for mudlovers, of whomGoonyella is 
the most obvious name in the field. It is probably not very good news for those 
at the top of the weights, since the effect of weight is exaggerated by testing 
conditions.

The going is now soft, heavy in places. As has been widely noted, conditions 
haven’t been this sticky since 2001, when 33-1 shot Red Marauder won the race – 
one of just two horses to get round without unseating their jockey. Ruby Walsh 
and AP McCoy got back on board Papillon and Blowing Wind respectively, with 
McCoy taking third ahead of the previous year’s winner.

Grand National <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> betting

We have a new favourite, with The Last Samuri in to 9-1, ahead of Many Clouds 
at 10-1. A trio of contenders at 12-1:Silviniaco Conti, Shutthefrontdoor and 
Holywell, with Gallant Oscar and Goonyella in to 14-1 on account of the 
conditions. At 16-1, two horses that came close last year –The Druids Nephew 
and runner-upSaint Are, plus Morning Assembly. Willie Mullins-trained pair Sir 
Des Champs and Boston Bob are 20-1, but there’s still time for the markets to 
change.

Half an hour until they’re under starter’s orders. This is, of course, a day 
for pin stickers as much as seasoned punters, so there’s still time to print 
out our sweepstake guide:

Chris Cook

A bad day has just got even worse for Brian Hughes. He began it by thinking he 
would get to ride the classy O’Faolains Boy in theGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational>. Then he got moved onto the 
less fancied The Romford Pele when O’Faolains became a non-runner. Then he fell 
at the first hurdle in the first race and was stood down for the rest of the 
day (though we do not believe he has sustained a significant injury). One of 
the other horses he was due to ride today, Maggio, has just won at 50-1. Ugh. 
If he owes you money, this is not the time to ring up about it.

If you’re looking for an omen for an outside bet, that result gives us a 
couple – winning jockey James Reveley, who handled that ride impeccably, is on
Vieux Lion Rouge at 80-1 in the big race – and he replaced Brian Hughes, who 
was injured earlier today – so perhaps his slated ride,The Romford Pele, is 
destined at 40-1...

In perhaps more relevant news, the going is very soft indeed, which could lead 
to a slow pace, plenty of horses pulling up, and a race that’s now even harder 
to call...

Virak is wilting, and Maggio romps into the lead, over the last, and wins by 
ten to twelve lengths! The 50-1 shot lands the win, with Virak second and Al Co

Eight to jump, with Coologue still in the lead, a length and a half from 
Virak, with Cloudy Too third. Favourite Mystifiable is well placed in the 
middle of the pack.

And they’re off, for a wide open handicap chase that makes for a tidy National 
prelude... all over the first two fences safely. Nina Carberry’s Knock House is 
an early back marker, with Virat and Cloudy Too leading the way.

Chris Cook

Chris Cook on the going at Aintree:

I’ve spent time shooting the breeze today with a couple of the experts I most 
respect, Jonathan Neesom and David Cleary, seeking their views on the state of 
the going. The conclusion is that this may well be the softest-ground National 
for 15 years, with the number of finishers unlikely to be more than 12.

The Timeform view of Friday’s going on the National course was that it was 
good to soft, since when we have had 7mm of overnight rain and continuing 
drizzle through the day. By the way, Douvan seems to have clocked a time 
consistent with ‘good’ going. The going is most certainly not ‘Good’, which 
just goes to show what a mighty animal he is.

Aintree going is soft

That recent deluge has officially changed the going to soft. That’s going to 
send a ripple through the markets, with Shutthefrontdoor, Gallant Oscar, Boston 
Bob and On His Own among the horses whose odds are coming in. There’s still 
time for a flutter if you fancy – take a late look at Chris Cook’s guide:

Betfred Handicap Chase: Preview

Here’s the day’s second fiendish handicap, to set you up for the king of all 
fiendish handicaps an hour later. It’s a good-quality chase for stayers and 
therefore is not wildly dissimilar to the National. Indeed it was won in 2009 
by Don’t Push It, who landed the National a year later, while today’s National 
entrant Saint Are also won this race in 2012.Mystifiable is the favourite, 
having won both his races over fences this season, though the grey is another 
stone higher in the weights this time.Cernunnos comes from the red-hot Tom 
George stable and was beaten only by a handicap blog last time; he’ll be most 
unlucky to run into such a well-treated rival here. Mick Channon’sKnock House 
runs here, having missed theGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> cut by two. Here’s hoping he 
has better luck than the horse who missed out by one spot, Bishops Road, who 
unseated at the first fence yesterday.Roc D’Apsis ran on to be third in a 
good-quality race at Kempton last time, despite early mistakes. This grey will 
go close here if he can manage to turn in a better round of jumping.

Guardian tip: Roc D’Apsis

Jockey Tom Scudamore talks to Racing UK about his cruise home on Thistlecrack: 
“It was very straightforward... a fantastic experience. He’s such a good horse, 
a clean jumper, he makes my job very easy... he’s got it all. It’s a thrill of 
a lifetime to be on him”

More from Chris Cook on what’s been a less than thrilling day’s racing so 
far...

So that makes three races in a row on Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> afternoon in which, for an 
awful lot of punters, betting interest is killed by a small field and a 
favourite at long odds-on. It is a subject of concern among bookmakers, as I 
found when chatting to two of their number just now. Their feeling is that, 
while it is helpful to run the National later in the afternoon, you then need 
to put in place a race programme leading up to it that builds excitement in 
stages. Instead, what we have had is a kind of lull that has lasted 90 minutes.

To some extent, this is just bad luck, because even a three-runner Grade One 
can sometimes be fiercely competitive. But the feeling is that this afternoon’s 
programme needs work and could perhaps benefit from the reintroduction of the
Aintree <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/aintree> Hurdle, which used to be 
run on this day but has now moved to a slot two days earlier. Or perhaps the 
exciting handicap hurdle that opens the card could be moved to a later slot. 
This will not be the purist view but the betting angle needs to be taken into 
account if racing wants to maximise interest and income.

That was awesome from Thistlecrack and we have certainly been treated to three 
impressive performances, following Douvan and Yorkhill earlier. But what we 
really want is to have two awesome horses in the same race...

Trainer Colin Tizzard <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-tizzard> seems 
reasonably pleased with that dominant performance, although he was rightly 
concerned by that clatter over the second last. It’s another short-priced 
winner at Aintree, the third in a row.

There’s a delay before the start, as Nico de Boinville hops off Different 
Gravey and fetches a new girth, after the first one snapped. Heavy favourite 
Thistlecrack is waiting patiently...

Chris Cook

3.40pm Liverpool Stayers’ Hurdle PREVIEW


Another short-priced favourite is likely to dominate this. Thistlecrack was 
perhaps the most impressive winner of the Cheltenham Festival last month, 
travelling throughout the World Hurdle as if he were the best by far and 
pulling seven lengths clear without apparent effort. He could cap a fine week 
for his West Country trainer,Colin Tizzard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-tizzard>, who also won a Grade One 
here on Thursday with Cue Card. Different Gravey is a major improver from the 
Nicky Henderson yard. Taking on Thistlecrack is a much greater test than 
anything he’s faced but we don’t yet know of a ceiling to his ability. Willie 
Mullins runs Shaneshill, back over hurdles for the first time in almost a year. 
He ran a fine race to be second in a novice chase at the Festival and he might 
have more to give in marathon races over hurdles.Guardian tip: Thistlecrack

That’s all from me on a day that belongs to Rule The World, his teenage 
debutant jockey David Mullins, and trainer Mouse Morris, who adds to his Irish 
National triumph, a year after his son passed away. Here’s Chris Cook’s race 
report from a dramatic day. Thanks for joining me, and don’t spend those 
winnings all at once.Bye!

Rule The World wins the Grand National with 19-year-old David Mullins
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/wins-grand-national-aintree>  
Rule The World had never won over jumps, and hadn’t won a race since January 
2014. The 33-1 shot won by six lengths from The Last Samuri, a joint favourite 
whose trainer, Kim Bailey, can scarcely believe was overtaken at the last, with 
Vics Canvas, a 13-year-old available at 100-1, finishing third. There’s really 
no point trying to predict this race.

Steele/Getty Images  
Good news: all horses and riders have made it back safely. There were only 12 
finishers in tough conditions. Spare a thought for Bryan Cooper, who had his 
pick from two Mouse Morris-trained rides. He picked First Lieutenant, who fell 
at the second and never recovered, and left Rule the World to Mullins. Ouch!
 
Here’s David Mullins: “I couldn’t have expected things to go better... 
everything went to plan really. Credit to Mouse, he’s a genius... I’d never 
walked round this course before today”

Clare Balding has just tried to interview Mouse Morris, but the trainer, who 
also won the Irish National this year, could barely get a word out.

One man never short of a word or two is the owner, Michael O’Leary (he of 
Ryanair): “Coming to win the race on his first attempt... it was a masterful 
ride”. O’Leary’s Gigginstown House Stud also gave him a Gold Cup win earlier 
this year.

O’Leary says hello to his children, on the verge of tears, then hollers “free 
flights for everyone!” OK, I made the last bit up.

The Last Samuri and Vics Canvas jump the last as one, with Rule the World 
close behind... it will be between these three, surely... and Rule the World 
gets up on the inside... he has too much pace for the joint favourite... and he 
romps away to win by a distance!
 
A mistake from Many Clouds hands the initiative to The Last Samuri, and with 
two to jump, he leads from Vics Canvas, Gilgamboa and Rule the World, with 
Morning Assembly out wide...
 
Over Foinavon and it’s still Many Clouds and The Last Samuri, with Saint Are 
losing ground. Aachen, who started so strongly, has refused a fence, with 
Gilgamboa, Goonyella and Rule the World well placed...
 
Ten fences to go, and Many Clouds comes through on the inside to lead by a 
nose from The Last Samuri. This could be a fierce battle, with Saint Are still 
close on the outside. Wonderful Charm, The Druid’s Nephew and Soll have all 
pulled up as the field begins to shrink...
 
Silviniaco Conti is in big trouble, and has been pulled up! Over a circuit to 
go as they approach the Chair, with a loose horse causing trouble. Sir Des 
Champs goes down at the Chair. Saint Are leads, with Aachen and Goonyella 
chasing...

 
Rocky Creek has been pulled up, with Home Farm, and appropriately enough, On 
His Own off the back. Aachen and Double Ross lead from Saint Are, with Many 
Clouds and The Last Samuri tucked in behind...
 
Over Becher’s Brook for the first time, with the remaining field landing 
safely. Holywell has continued despite falling at the second. The Romford Pele 
goes at the Canal Turn, with Double Ross and Aachen leading. Saint Are, 
Shutthefrontdoor and Many Clouds are all well placed...
 
Hadrian’s Approach goes down at the first, and at the second, Holywell has 
gone! First Lieutenant falls too, with Aachen heading the field in the early 
stages...
 
The 2016 Grand National <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> is 
under way...
 
The horses are galloping down to the starting line. The Last Samuri and Many 
Clouds are joint favourites at 8-1, with Goonyella, who is likely to enjoy 
these conditions, down to 10-1. Plenty of outside bets coming in rapidly, 
including The Romford Pele and Katenko...
 
Five minutes to go, as Laura Wright belts out ‘God Save the Queen’. Are you 
with the betting public, andChris Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/talking-horses-racing-tips-grand-national-aintree-the-last-samuri>
, in backingThe Last Samuri? Do you, like AP McCoy, like the look of Gallant 
Oscar, or are you with most of the tipsters in picking Holywell? Whoever you’ve 
picked, be lucky. It’s likely to be a testing race; obviously, we hope all 
horses and riders make it back unharmed.
 
The going on the Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> course has just been changed 
to ‘Soft, Heavy in places’ after all the rain last night and today. That is 
even more testing than most of us were imagining when we made our calculations. 
It will make for fewer finishers but should also reduce the risk of injury to 
horses and jockeys, as the field will go slower and there will be more give 
underfoot if they fall. It is very good news for mudlovers, of whomGoonyella is 
the most obvious name in the field. It is probably not very good news for those 
at the top of the weights, since the effect of weight is exaggerated by testing 
conditions.
 
The going is now soft, heavy in places. As has been widely noted, conditions 
haven’t been this sticky since 2001, when 33-1 shot Red Marauder won the race – 
one of just two horses to get round without unseating their jockey. Ruby Walsh 
and AP McCoy got back on board Papillon and Blowing Wind respectively, with 
McCoy taking third ahead of the previous year’s winner.
 
Grand National <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> betting

We have a new favourite, with The Last Samuri in to 9-1, ahead of Many Clouds 
at 10-1. A trio of contenders at 12-1:Silviniaco Conti, Shutthefrontdoor and 
Holywell, with Gallant Oscar and Goonyella in to 14-1 on account of the 
conditions. At 16-1, two horses that came close last year –The Druids Nephew 
and runner-upSaint Are, plus Morning Assembly. Willie Mullins-trained pair Sir 
Des Champs and Boston Bob are 20-1, but there’s still time for the markets to 
change.
 
Half an hour until they’re under starter’s orders. This is, of course, a day 
for pin stickers as much as seasoned punters, so there’s still time to print 
out our sweepstake guide:

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/08/grand-national-2016-sweepstake-kit>
And if you’ve got a spurious reason for backing a particular horse today, I’d 
love to hear it...
 
A bad day has just got even worse for Brian Hughes. He began it by thinking he 
would get to ride the classy O’Faolains Boy in theGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational>. Then he got moved onto the 
less fancied The Romford Pele when O’Faolains became a non-runner. Then he fell 
at the first hurdle in the first race and was stood down for the rest of the 
day (though we do not believe he has sustained a significant injury). One of 
the other horses he was due to ride today, Maggio, has just won at 50-1. Ugh. 
If he owes you money, this is not the time to ring up about it.
 
If you’re looking for an omen for an outside bet, that result gives us a 
couple – winning jockey James Reveley, who handled that ride impeccably, is on
Vieux Lion Rouge at 80-1 in the big race – and he replaced Brian Hughes, who 
was injured earlier today – so perhaps his slated ride,The Romford Pele, is 
destined at 40-1...

In perhaps more relevant news, the going is very soft indeed, which could lead 
to a slow pace, plenty of horses pulling up, and a race that’s now even harder 
to call...
 
1 Maggio (J Reveley) 50-1

2 Virak (H Cobden) 12-1

3 Al Co (S Bowen) 14-1
 Maggio takes the win. Photograph: racingfotos.com/REX/Shutterstock  
Virak is wilting, and Maggio romps into the lead, over the last, and wins by 
ten to twelve lengths! The 50-1 shot lands the win, with Virak second and Al Co 
third.
 
Over the third to last, Virak leads from Maggio, who has bolted through the 
field as Coologue falls off the pace. Al Co is in third, with the rest looking 
out of contention...
 
Racing Pulse pulled up with five to jump, with Virak and Coologue upping the 
pace. French outsider Al Co is in the mix too...
 
Eight to jump, with Coologue still in the lead, a length and a half from 
Virak, with Cloudy Too third. Favourite Mystifiable is well placed in the 
middle of the pack.
 
Richard Johnson leads the field on Coologue, a length clear of Virak, with 
Knock House losing touch at the back
 
And they’re off, for a wide open handicap chase that makes for a tidy National 
prelude... all over the first two fences safely. Nina Carberry’s Knock House is 
an early back marker, with Virat and Cloudy Too leading the way.

Chris Cook on the going at Aintree:

I’ve spent time shooting the breeze today with a couple of the experts I most 
respect, Jonathan Neesom and David Cleary, seeking their views on the state of 
the going. The conclusion is that this may well be the softest-ground National 
for 15 years, with the number of finishers unlikely to be more than 12.

The Timeform view of Friday’s going on the National course was that it was 
good to soft, since when we have had 7mm of overnight rain and continuing 
drizzle through the day. By the way, Douvan seems to have clocked a time 
consistent with ‘good’ going. The going is most certainly not ‘Good’, which 
just goes to show what a mighty animal he is.
 
That recent deluge has officially changed the going to soft. That’s going to 
send a ripple through the markets, with Shutthefrontdoor, Gallant Oscar, Boston 
Bob and On His Own among the horses whose odds are coming in. There’s still 
time for a flutter if you fancy – take a late look at Chris Cook’s guide:

Betfred Handicap Chase: Preview

Here’s the day’s second fiendish handicap, to set you up for the king of all 
fiendish handicaps an hour later. It’s a good-quality chase for stayers and 
therefore is not wildly dissimilar to the National. Indeed it was won in 2009 
by Don’t Push It, who landed the National a year later, while today’s National 
entrant Saint Are also won this race in 2012.Mystifiable is the favourite, 
having won both his races over fences this season, though the grey is another 
stone higher in the weights this time.Cernunnos comes from the red-hot Tom 
George stable and was beaten only by a handicap blog last time; he’ll be most 
unlucky to run into such a well-treated rival here. Mick Channon’sKnock House 
runs here, having missed theGrand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> cut by two. Here’s hoping he 
has better luck than the horse who missed out by one spot, Bishops Road, who 
unseated at the first fence yesterday.Roc D’Apsis ran on to be third in a 
good-quality race at Kempton last time, despite early mistakes. This grey will 
go close here if he can manage to turn in a better round of jumping.

Next up at 4.20pm, it’s the Betfred Handicap Chase, before the main event 
which is at 5.15pm. It’s a later start time this year, in case you’re wondering 
what on earth’s going on.
 
Jockey Tom Scudamore talks to Racing UK about his cruise home on Thistlecrack: 
“It was very straightforward... a fantastic experience. He’s such a good horse, 
a clean jumper, he makes my job very easy... he’s got it all. It’s a thrill of 
a lifetime to be on him”
 
More from Chris Cook on what’s been a less than thrilling day’s racing so 
far...

So that makes three races in a row on Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> afternoon in which, for an 
awful lot of punters, betting interest is killed by a small field and a 
favourite at long odds-on. It is a subject of concern among bookmakers, as I 
found when chatting to two of their number just now. Their feeling is that, 
while it is helpful to run the National later in the afternoon, you then need 
to put in place a race programme leading up to it that builds excitement in 
stages. Instead, what we have had is a kind of lull that has lasted 90 minutes.

To some extent, this is just bad luck, because even a three-runner Grade One 
can sometimes be fiercely competitive. But the feeling is that this afternoon’s 
programme needs work and could perhaps benefit from the reintroduction of the
Aintree <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/aintree> Hurdle, which used to be 
run on this day but has now moved to a slot two days earlier. Or perhaps the 
exciting handicap hurdle that opens the card could be moved to a later slot. 
This will not be the purist view but the betting angle needs to be taken into 
account if racing wants to maximise interest and income.
 
That was awesome from Thistlecrack and we have certainly been treated to three 
impressive performances, following Douvan and Yorkhill earlier. But what we 
really want is to have two awesome horses in the same race...
 
Trainer Colin Tizzard <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-tizzard> seems 
reasonably pleased with that dominant performance, although he was rightly 
concerned by that clatter over the second last. It’s another short-priced 
winner at Aintree, the third in a row.

3.40pm Liverpool Stayers’ Hurdle PREVIEW


Another short-priced favourite is likely to dominate this. Thistlecrack was 
perhaps the most impressive winner of the Cheltenham Festival last month, 
travelling throughout the World Hurdle as if he were the best by far and 
pulling seven lengths clear without apparent effort. He could cap a fine week 
for his West Country trainer,Colin Tizzard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-tizzard>, who also won a Grade One 
here on Thursday with Cue Card. Different Gravey is a major improver from the 
Nicky Henderson yard. Taking on Thistlecrack is a much greater test than 
anything he’s faced but we don’t yet know of a ceiling to his ability. Willie 
Mullins runs Shaneshill, back over hurdles for the first time in almost a year. 
He ran a fine race to be second in a novice chase at the Festival and he might 
have more to give in marathon races over hurdles.Guardian tip: Thistlecrack
