Outsourcing group Capita has slipped back after a downbeat note from analysts 
at Morgan Stanley.

The bank issued an underweight rating, albeit lifting its target price form 
950p to 990p, on the basis that it expects weak organic growth to come. Analyst 
Allen Wells said:

Revenue growth should be in low-double digits but is incrementally driven by 
acquisitions, and low organic growth in the first half could disappoint. On 
18.3 times 2016 estimated PE, share looks unattractive, with better 
opportunities in the sector: we preferBabcock among outsourcers.

We struggle to justify Capita’s 45% premium to Babcock, given our view on 
lower growth, downside risk to margins and concerns on falling cash generation 
and returns.

We expect first half 2015 organic growth of 4.1%, implying a slowdown in 2015 
versus 2014’s 9% and compares to management expectation of mid-single digit 
organic growth in 2015.

We expect acquisitions to drive 7% revenue growth, implying total revenue of 
£2,299m in the first half of 2015, implying 11% year on year (consensus 10%) 
and in line with management expectation of low double digit revenue growth in 
2015

However, with revenue growth incrementally driven by the acquisitions we see 
further risk, as this remains dilutive to returns.

Accounting for recent acquisitions increases our 2015-2017 estimated earnings 
per share increases by 2%, offsetting the impact of 40 basis points lower 
organic growth in 2015. Our price target moves up to 990p from 950p driven by 
higher earnings per share and valuation capturing more of 2016 versus 2015.

In a falling market, Capita <https://www.theguardian.com/business/capitagroup> 
is down 4p at £13.16 and Babcock 2p lower at £11.09.
