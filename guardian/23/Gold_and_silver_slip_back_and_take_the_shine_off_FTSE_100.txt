Precious metal miners are losing their lustre, helping undermine the market’s 
attempts to reach new record highs.

The FTSE 100, having reached an intraday record of 7129.83, is now down around 
8 points at 7089. An opening fall on Wall Street has not helped, with the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average now down 94 points or 0.5% after a disappointing 
update from Alcoa.

But one of the main factors for the decline is a fall in gold and silver as 
the dollar continues to climb on the basis that US interest rates may soon be 
increased. More clues could come from the minutes of the last Federal Reserve 
meeting, due to be released on Wednesday.

So Mexican miner Fresnillo has fallen 41p to £16.44, Randgold Resources is 
down 165p to £69 and, in the mid-cap index, the top three losers areHochschild, 
14.4p lower at 252.8p, Egyptian gold minerCentamin, down 7.6p at 147.8p and 
Africa’sAcacia Mining, off 14.1p at 461.8p.

Meanwhile the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 remains Old Mutual, down 11.5p at 
197.8p on disappointment with its presentation to City investors, as well as a 
fall in the rand after South Africa’s finance minister was ordered to appear in 
court next month.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said:

After the excitement of a fresh all-time intraday peak for the FTSE things 
have calmed down somewhat, the US open bringing in a wave of investors who 
aren’t purely Brexit-focused.

A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it’s back hovering 
below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhapsreports 
that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain 
appears to be heading for a hard Brexit

have weighed on investors’ appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of 
profit-taking. Either way the FTSE couldn’t hold onto its highs for long.
