Tim Cahill <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tim-cahill> has hung up on 
veteran broadcaster John Laws during a live-to-air interview in which the 2SM 
host seemed to belittle the achievements of the Socceroos during the recent 
Asian Cup.

Laws focused repeatedly on the financial aspect of the footballer’s reported 
$10m contract with Chinese Super League team Shanghai Shenhua, referring to the 
Socceroos striker as “a very rich man”.

When Laws interjected “champions of Asia? It’s a big call, Asia’s got a lot of 
people”, Cahill appeared to then hang up.

 Veteran broadcaster John Laws seems to have missed that the Socceroos have won 
the Asian Cup, in a meandering interview with striker Tim Cahill. 
Several of Laws’ listeners took exception with the veteran broadcaster’s line 
of questioning, with one passionately defending Cahill with a string of 
obscenities directed at the veteran broadcaster.
