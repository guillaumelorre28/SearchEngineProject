Nate Parker <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nate-parker>, director of the 
film The Birth of a Nation, says he does not feel guilty about a rape 
allegation levied against him in 1999, in a tapedinterview with 60 Minutes 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-preview-nate-parker/> to air on Sunday.

Parker has spoken out in the past 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/29/nate-parker-ebony-interview-rape-accusations-consent>
 about the2001 trial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/nate-parker-rape-penn-state-jean-celestin>
 against him and his college roommate Jean Celestin, who shares story credit 
with Parker on the film. Parker was acquitted of the charge of raping an 
unconscious woman, and Celestin’s conviction was later overturned. Parker and 
the woman had had an earlier, consensual sexual encounter.

News of the trial resurfaced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/birth-of-a-nation-film-nate-parker-rape-trial>
 as Parker’s directorial debut – based on the 1831 slave revolt led by Nat 
Turner – began to gain acclaim. Parker directed, co-wrote and starred in the 
film.

In a clip from the episode released by CBS on Thursday, interviewer Anderson 
Cooper asks Parker if he feels guilty about anything that happened that night.

“I don’t feel guilty,” Parker responds. Cooper then asks if Parker feels he 
did something morally wrong.

“As a Christian man, just being in that situation, yeah, sure. I’m 36 years 
old right now and my faith is very important to me. So looking back through 
that lens, it’s not the lens that I had when I was 19 years old,” Parker says.

Parker previously spoke to Ebony Magazine 
<http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/nate-parker-rape-charges-consent#axzz4IXuYYFFQ>
 and said his definition of consent had changed since the incident and that his
initial comments

 on the situation – which were met with a backlash,defaced posters

 – came from a “standpoint of ignorance”.

The woman who accused Parker and Celestin dropped out of college and later 
killed herself, in 2012. Court documents also show the woman said she was 
harassed by the two men after she reported the incident to the police. On 
Thursday, Variety publisheda column

 by the woman’s sister, speaking out against Parker.

Parker told Cooper that the news of the woman’s death was “devastating” and 
“shocking”. “I had absolutely no idea. I found out in the news,” he said.

According to a preview article written by CBS, Parker grew emotional when 
asked if he had anything to apologize for. “I was falsely accused … I went to 
court … I was vindicated,” he says. “I feel terrible that this woman isn’t here 
… Her family had to deal with that, but as I sit here, an apology is – no,” he 
said.
