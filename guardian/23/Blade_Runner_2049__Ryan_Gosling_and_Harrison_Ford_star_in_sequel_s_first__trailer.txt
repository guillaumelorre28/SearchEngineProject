The first teaser trailer for the film has arrived and shows an ageing Deckard 
confronted by Ryan Gosling’s Officer K who appears to be on a similar hunt for 
replicants.

The development of a sequel to Ridley Scott’s seminal sci-fi thriller started 
in 1999 with various failed attempts in the years since. Scott was originally 
set to directBlade Runner <https://www.theguardian.com/film/blade-runner> 2049, 
but he stepped back and is now on board as an executive producer. Instead, 
Arrival and Sicario director Denis Villeneuve has taken on the role.

Ford’s character is said to only appear in the third act of the film while 
Gosling will lead, supported by Robin Wright, Jared Leto and Dave Bautista.

“It’s like three movies that I usually make in one,” Gosling recently told GQ 
<http://www.gq.com/story/ryan-gosling-profile>. “Just in terms of the length 
and just the whole scope and experience. I’ve never done something so shrouded 
in secrecy or where there’s so much anticipation.”

Blade Runner 2049 will be released on 6 October 2017.
