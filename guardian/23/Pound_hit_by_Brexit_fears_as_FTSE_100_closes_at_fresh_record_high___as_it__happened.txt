Brexit uncertainty hasn’t hit the UK housing market, according to new figures 
from the Halifax today.

Halifax reports that house prices jumped by 1.7% in December, surprising 
economists who only forecast a 0.2% rise. On a annual basis, prices were 6.5% 
higher.

This survey only includes data from Halifax’s own customers, so should be 
treated cautiously (rival mortgage broker Nationwide reported annual growth of 
4.5% in December).

Commerzbank: City fears Brexit disaster

The Financial Times has got hold of a research note from Germany’s 
Commerzbank, which says investors fear a Brexit ‘disaster’ unless the UK 
produces a decent strategy for leaving the EU.

Commerzbank’s  Esther Reichelt argues that Theresa May’s opposition to 
“keeping bits” of EU membership raise the chances of a hard Brexit, and the 
loss of full access to the single market.

Here’s the key section:


Until the government finally presents a concrete and convincing strategy 
market participants will increasingly fear a disaster. In particular as she 
[May] signalled once again that the aim of controlling immigration was a red 
line she would not be willing to cross. That means that following Brexit the 
country is likely to lose access to the single market.

Even though the US President-elect has already signalled an interest in closer 
ties with its former colonial masters which may well cushion the economic 
impact of the decision for the UK, what Larry Summers said in his interview 
about the US also applies to the UK: “if our strategy is to trade only with 
people that speak English that’s going to be a poor strategy”.

The FX market shares this view and as a result Sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has come under pressure again 
this morning.

Brexit uncertainty appears to be overriding recent solid UK economic data, 
includingstrong service sector growth in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/uk-services-sector-grows-fastest-pace>
.


Jeremy Cook, economist at currency firm World First, explains:

Comments made by the Prime Minister on a Sunday morning political talk show 
suggested, once again, that she and her government therefore favour tighter 
controls over immigration than access to the single market. This is nothing new 
but with 11 weeks or so until the proposed invocation of Article 50 details 
seem to be few and far between. The PM seemed happier to talk about her 
domestic agenda and will outline further thoughts on the ‘shared society’ later 
today in a speech.

Of course, the sterling weakness comes despite a strong run of UK data last 
week; despite the good news markets are reticent to back a currency with such a 
political schism still unresolved and further economic fall out further 
unrealised. That being said, conditions are decent for a little bit of sterling 
strength this week as a result of weakness elsewhere. Trump could go off the 
rails* when pressed on China, protectionism or the new series of The Apprentice 
while the euro will have to deal with the latest round of minutes from the ECB 
(Thursday) and a possible ratings downgrade of Italy (Friday).

*--President-elect Trump is due to give a press conference on Wednesday.

FTSE 100 hits fresh record (again)

The slump in the pound today  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/09/pound-hard-brexit-fears-ftse-100-hits-another-record-high-business-live?page=with:block-587340d9e4b0be03bff4419b#block-587340d9e4b0be03bff4419b>
has driven Britain’s index of leading blue-chip shares up to a new alltime high 
in early trading.

The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 index jumped to 29 
points to 7239 points, putting it on track for eight record closing highs in a 
row.

Mining companies are leading the rally, with Anglo American up 2.7% and 
Glencore gaining 2.2%.

A cheap pound drives up the value of multinational firms listed on the 
Footsie, as it means their overseas earnings are worth more when converted into 
sterling.

So worries about a ‘hard Brexit’ can quickly translate into a weaker currency, 
but a higher stock market, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains:

The main driver of the index’s growth seemed to be the latest plunge from the 
pound, which dropped by 0.8% against both the dollar and the euro following 
Theresa May’s Sky News interview at the weekend.

 The Prime Minister’s comments were read as falling decidedly on the ‘hard’ 
end of the Brexit spectrum, with ‘control of [the UK’s] borders’ likely to be 
prioritised over continued access to the single market.

The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn points out that today selloff has wiped out the 
pound’s recent rally (it rose from $1.21 to $1.27 in November, before dipping 
in December).

Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) 
Pound falls to £1.219 overnight - down 1% - after Theresa May's single market 
departure hint. So much for the rebound.

Kit Juckes of French bank Société Générale says that the pound has been main 
mover in the currency markets “after UK PM May indicated that the UK won’t try 
to negotiate continued full access to the European single market when it leaves 
the EU”.

Brexit fears send pound sliding

Newsflash! The pound has fallen to its lowest level in over two months, as 
fears of a ‘hard Brexit’ sweep through the City.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has shed 1% against 
the US dollar in early trading to $1.2166, down from $1.228. That’s its lowest 
point since the end of October, and 18% below its value before last June’s 
referendum.

2017 <https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/818339172759048193> 
The pound is also suffering against the euro, shedding almost 1 cent as it 
slips to €1.155.

The selloff has been triggered by Theresa May’s comments yesterday that she 
wasn’t interested in keeping “bits of membership of the EU” and was determined 
to control immigration from Europe.

In her first major interview of 2017, May told Sky News that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/brexit-may-single-market-scotland-fears>
:

“Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still 
want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are 
coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.

We will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.”

That is being taken as a sign that the UK will not retain access to the Single 
Market after Brexit.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are certain that this has spooked traders into 
selling the pound this morning. They say:

Comments from UK PM Theresa May in a TV interview broadcast Sunday are being 
interpreted as an indication that the UK government will prioritise immigration 
control over single market access in its negotiations on exiting the EU.

More reaction to follow....

The agenda: Another FTSE record high today?

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

City traders trudging to work this morning have two issues on their mind 
(well, three, if you include today’s tube strike).

The first is whether the FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 
can hit a record closing high for the eighth day in a row, which hasn’t 
happened for 20 years

The blue-chip index closed at 7210 points on Friday, and traders reckon it’s 
going to rise again today.

The FTSE’s recent rise is partly due to the weakening pound. 

And the second issue is whether sterling is heading for another Brexit-induced 
bath, as worries over Britain’s exit from the EU mount.

A 8.30am, the Halifax building society publishes its house price figures, 
which will show if the sector slowed in December.

Europe’s economy is also on the agenda today. The Sentix research group will 
release its latest survey on investor confidence at 9.30am. And at 10am, we get 
the latest eurozone unemployment figures for November.


We’ve already had solid news from Germany; new figures show that its 
industrial sector grew by 0.4% last month:

Brexit uncertainty hasn’t hit the UK housing market, according to new figures 
from the Halifax today.

Halifax reports that house prices jumped by 1.7% in December, surprising 
economists who only forecast a 0.2% rise. On a annual basis, prices were 6.5% 
higher.

This survey only includes data from Halifax’s own customers, so should be 
treated cautiously (rival mortgage broker Nationwide reported annual growth of 
4.5% in December).
 
City PR boss George Trefgarne argues that the pound is suffering from more 
than just Theresa May’s appearance on the new Sophy Ridge show on Sunday.

The Financial Times has got hold of a research note from Germany’s 
Commerzbank, which says investors fear a Brexit ‘disaster’ unless the UK 
produces a decent strategy for leaving the EU.

Commerzbank’s  Esther Reichelt argues that Theresa May’s opposition to 
“keeping bits” of EU membership raise the chances of a hard Brexit, and the 
loss of full access to the single market.

Here’s the key section:


Until the government finally presents a concrete and convincing strategy 
market participants will increasingly fear a disaster. In particular as she 
[May] signalled once again that the aim of controlling immigration was a red 
line she would not be willing to cross. That means that following Brexit the 
country is likely to lose access to the single market.

Even though the US President-elect has already signalled an interest in closer 
ties with its former colonial masters which may well cushion the economic 
impact of the decision for the UK, what Larry Summers said in his interview 
about the US also applies to the UK: “if our strategy is to trade only with 
people that speak English that’s going to be a poor strategy”.

The FX market shares this view and as a result Sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has come under pressure again 
this morning.

Brexit uncertainty appears to be overriding recent solid UK economic data, 
includingstrong service sector growth in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/uk-services-sector-grows-fastest-pace>
.


Jeremy Cook, economist at currency firm World First, explains:

Comments made by the Prime Minister on a Sunday morning political talk show 
suggested, once again, that she and her government therefore favour tighter 
controls over immigration than access to the single market. This is nothing new 
but with 11 weeks or so until the proposed invocation of Article 50 details 
seem to be few and far between. The PM seemed happier to talk about her 
domestic agenda and will outline further thoughts on the ‘shared society’ later 
today in a speech.

Of course, the sterling weakness comes despite a strong run of UK data last 
week; despite the good news markets are reticent to back a currency with such a 
political schism still unresolved and further economic fall out further 
unrealised. That being said, conditions are decent for a little bit of sterling 
strength this week as a result of weakness elsewhere. Trump could go off the 
rails* when pressed on China, protectionism or the new series of The Apprentice 
while the euro will have to deal with the latest round of minutes from the ECB 
(Thursday) and a possible ratings downgrade of Italy (Friday).

*--President-elect Trump is due to give a press conference on Wednesday.
 
This chart, from Bloomberg’s Peter Hoskins, shows how the pound has been 
choppy since its slump in late June:

The slump in the pound today  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/09/pound-hard-brexit-fears-ftse-100-hits-another-record-high-business-live?page=with:block-587340d9e4b0be03bff4419b#block-587340d9e4b0be03bff4419b>
has driven Britain’s index of leading blue-chip shares up to a new alltime high 
in early trading.

The FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 index jumped to 29 
points to 7239 points, putting it on track for eight record closing highs in a 
row.

Mining companies are leading the rally, with Anglo American up 2.7% and 
Glencore gaining 2.2%.

A cheap pound drives up the value of multinational firms listed on the 
Footsie, as it means their overseas earnings are worth more when converted into 
sterling.

So worries about a ‘hard Brexit’ can quickly translate into a weaker currency, 
but a higher stock market, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains:

The main driver of the index’s growth seemed to be the latest plunge from the 
pound, which dropped by 0.8% against both the dollar and the euro following 
Theresa May’s Sky News interview at the weekend.

 The Prime Minister’s comments were read as falling decidedly on the ‘hard’ 
end of the Brexit spectrum, with ‘control of [the UK’s] borders’ likely to be 
prioritised over continued access to the single market.
 
The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn points out that today selloff has wiped out the 
pound’s recent rally (it rose from $1.21 to $1.27 in November, before dipping 
in December).

Kit Juckes of French bank Société Générale says that the pound has been main 
mover in the currency markets “after UK PM May indicated that the UK won’t try 
to negotiate continued full access to the European single market when it leaves 
the EU”.
 
Newsflash! The pound has fallen to its lowest level in over two months, as 
fears of a ‘hard Brexit’ sweep through the City.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has shed 1% against 
the US dollar in early trading to $1.2166, down from $1.228. That’s its lowest 
point since the end of October, and 18% below its value before last June’s 
referendum.

The pound is also suffering against the euro, shedding almost 1 cent as it 
slips to €1.155.

The selloff has been triggered by Theresa May’s comments yesterday that she 
wasn’t interested in keeping “bits of membership of the EU” and was determined 
to control immigration from Europe.

In her first major interview of 2017, May told Sky News that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/brexit-may-single-market-scotland-fears>
:

“Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still 
want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are 
coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.

We will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.”

That is being taken as a sign that the UK will not retain access to the Single 
Market after Brexit.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are certain that this has spooked traders into 
selling the pound this morning. They say:

Comments from UK PM Theresa May in a TV interview broadcast Sunday are being 
interpreted as an indication that the UK government will prioritise immigration 
control over single market access in its negotiations on exiting the EU.

More reaction to follow....
 
Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the

City traders trudging to work this morning have two issues on their mind 
(well, three, if you include today’s tube strike).

The FTSE’s recent rise is partly due to the weakening pound. 

And the second issue is whether sterling is heading for another Brexit-induced 
bath, as worries over Britain’s exit from the EU mount.

A 8.30am, the Halifax building society publishes its house price figures, 
which will show if the sector slowed in December.

Europe’s economy is also on the agenda today. The Sentix research group will 
release its latest survey on investor confidence at 9.30am. And at 10am, we get 
the latest eurozone unemployment figures for November.


We’ve already had solid news from Germany; new figures show that its 
industrial sector grew by 0.4% last month:
