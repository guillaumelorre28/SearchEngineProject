A playwright, translator and spy, Behn (also known as Astrea) has a good claim 
to being the first Englishwoman to make a living out of her writing. In the 
centuries after her death in 1689, her plays were dismissed as indecent because 
of their focus on female sexuality (“The stage how loosely does Astrea tread/ 
Who fairly puts all characters to bed!” wrote Alexander Pope in 1737). Recent 
feminist scholars have rediscovered her writing, and have made the case that 
the publication of her prose fictionOroonoko, the story of a slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview35>
, was a key moment in the development of the English novel.

“Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic 
equality of the sexes.” In the most high-profile pop-feminist moment of 2013,
Beyoncé included these words 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/beyonce-samples-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-feminism-talk>
 – taken from aTED talk given by Adichie 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc> – on her single Flawless. In the 
talk, which has since been published as a book calledWe Should All Be Feminists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/17/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-extract-we-should-all-be-feminists>
, the Nigerian-born author asks: why are girls taught to shrink themselves, to 
compete for men, to limit their ambitions? She urges her audience to reclaim 
the word “feminist” and to say: “Yes, there’s a problem with gender as it is 
today, and we must fix it.”

traveller. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis 
“No one but a man can do this,” Nellie Bly’s editor told her in 1886 when she 
suggested travelling round the world in less than 80 days. She would need a 
protector, he said – and how would she ever carry all the luggage a lady would 
need on such a trip? Bly didn’t worry too much about the first quibble, and 
travelled light, crushing all her belongings into a single handbag. She made it 
home in 72 days. That wasn’t the first time the pioneering American journalist 
had attracted attention through her work – a year earlier, in 1887, she faked 
madness to go undercover in an asylum, exposing its poor conditions and abusive 
staff.

Rarely has feminism seemed as much fun as it does in the work of Caitlin Moran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/caitlin-moran>. Her 2011 book, How to Be A 
Woman <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/26/caitlin-moran-how-be-woman>
, covered a host of modern dilemmas – body image, abortions, motherhood, what 
to do when Lady Gaga invites you to share her loo cubicle – and kicked off a 
feminist publishing boom. The movement might be fuelled by anger against 
injustice, but who doesn’t need laughter and silliness in their life, too? 
Moran followed up with a novel that celebrated the sexuality of teenage girls – 
a subject too often marred by the prurient anxiety of their elders.

If you only know Dworkin by reputation – a big, scary man-hater who decreed 
that “all sex is rape” – then a pleasant surprise awaits. Seen through her own 
words, a different woman emerges: still strident, still unapologetic, but with 
a fierce intelligence and a bludgeoning prose style that will take your breath 
away. Dworkin’s brand of anti-pornography feminism might have lost the “sex 
wars” of the late 70s and 80s, but that doesn’t invalidate her career. As 
feminists, we need to come to an accommodation with foremothers who are 
inconvenient, exasperating – or sometimes just wrong.

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai> became a symbol of the 
struggle to achieve the second of these goals when she was shot in the head by

In the past five years, the film star has shugged off lurid headlines about 
her relationship with Brad Pitt to become an eloquent advocate of better 
treatment and support for victims of rape in war zones. Last year’s UN summit 
in London heard from grassroots activists around the world and was attended by 
then foreign secretary William Hague. Sexual violence as a weapon of war is one 
of the world’smost persistent human rights abuses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/angelina-jolie-william-hague-war-zone-rape>
 : it is estimated that 12% of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo are 
rape survivors, and the crime affects thousands of men and children too. Brava, 
Angelina, for putting it on the international agenda.

answer is usually: read another book, don’t worry about what your hair looks 
like, and take no crap from anybody. The Cambridge professor of classics 
memorablystood up to internet trolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/27/mary-beard-befriends-twitter-trolls-online-abuse>
 by refusing to be ashamed when they made lewd jokes about her age and her 
body. She has recently opposed the trend among university societies for 
censoring feminists who have the“wrong” opinions on sex-work and gender 
<http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2015/02/no-platforming-1.html>. Just

“Chloe liked Olivia” was Virginia Woolf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf>’s nomination for the most 
startling sentence she had ever read. In her essay A Room Of One’s Own, Woolf 
attempted to reclaim English literature from its relentless focus on men’s 
lives, and she explored the material conditions that make it harder for women 
to be creative. The book was written in 1929, but it is just as relevant today, 
whenwomen wrote 11% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/13/number-of-female-film-directors-falls-over-last-two-decades>
 of the 250 top‑grossing films of 2014, and thelatest VIDA (Women in Literary 
Arts) count <http://www.vidaweb.org/> found that three-quarters of the authors 
and reviewers in journals such as theNew York Review of Books and the LRB were 
men.

Yes, Star Trek’s Captain Picard. In 2009, Stewart revealed that he had grown 
up in a household scarred by his father’s violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/nov/27/patrick-stewart-domestic-violence>
against his mother, Gladys. The police refused to help the family, telling 
Gladys: “Mrs Stewart, it takes two to make a fight.” Her son disagreed: 
“Violence is a choice a man makes and he alone is responsible for it.” At a 
time when funding cuts are hurting the women’s sector and specialist provision 
is being cut, the actor and activist offers a simple, heartfelt message: no 
woman should die, and no child should live in fear, because they cannot escape 
a violent man.
