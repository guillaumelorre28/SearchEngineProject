Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography by Adam Ant; read by the author 
(Macmillan Â£12.99, 4hrs)

From his troubled north London childhood to the frantic, sex-laden days of 
punk rock, Stuart Goddard, akaAdam Ant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-ant>, recounts his life story. He 
encounters a smelly Nancy Spungen, 'as dumb as Sid Vicious was naive', and a 
Johnny Rotten who wanted to save the world. Then came his Eighties success. But 
his fall was inevitable. As a sufferer of bipolar disease, he battled 
depression and suicidal tendencies. In 2002, he was arrested and detained under 
the Mental Health Act. Ant's delivery is stilted, but his love of cliches, 'a 
cappuccino that tasted like a sweet memory', is as endearing as his desire for 
a fairy-tale ending to his torment.
