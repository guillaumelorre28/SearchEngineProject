The Breaking Bad poster

You watched every single episode of the show on illegal streaming sites 
because you couldn’t wait to watch it on UK telly 24 hours later. You call your 
male friends “bitch” as bants but secretly worry that you’ll accidentally refer 
to a girl that way and get a misogynist rep in halls. Or is it sexistnot to 
call them bitch? You reckon you could definitely try crystal meth and not get 
addicted.

The old favourite that keeps on giving. You see yourself as a misunderstood 
outsider. In reality, you’re a middle-class sociology student who thinks 
quoting song lyrics will help get you laid. Your mates from back home in Surrey 
roast you on the group WhatsApp for dressing like you’re wearing “your dad’s 
gardening clothes” because two years ago, you were spending the profits of your 
weekend job in Costa Coffee at Hollister.

Panicked about going off to uni and missing your squad from college, you went 
to Boots and printed off a load of photos – well, the ones in which you look 
thin and hot in at least – and arranged them in a cute collage that takes pride 
of place on your wall in halls. At the centre is an adorable selfie of you and 
your bae, who’s staying back in Cheshire to work in Currys and save up for your 
engagement ring. You will cheat on them by the middle of the first term.

Did you mention that time on your gap year that you met these amazing local 
women who wove hemp into hareem trousers in Bolivia? Well, you say “met”, but 
you sort of heard about them from the Australian white-water rafting instructor 
you pulled in La Paz, and he wouldn’t lie to you, would he? Well, until you 
Facebooked him to tell him about the chlamydia, and he said it definitely 
wasn’t him, then blocked you. You’re also constantly having to make up stories 
about going to Papua New Guinea because you scratched it off the map thinking 
it was New Zealand.

You thought you’d be the only person with this framed print when you packed it 
into your mum’s Ford Galaxy and made the long journey from Lowestoft to Exeter 
Uni, but now you’ve spotted six in your halls alone. Your Instagram feed is 
meticulously curated and you’ve already burned through half of your student 
loan by drinking decent Rioja instead of cheap cider on nights out because it 
matches your “Alexa Chung meets Breakfast At Tiffanys” aesthetic.
