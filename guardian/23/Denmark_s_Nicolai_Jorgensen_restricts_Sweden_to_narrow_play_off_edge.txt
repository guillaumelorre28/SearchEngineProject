Emil Forsberg scored one goal and won a penalty that Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
converted before Denmark’s Nicolai Jorgensen snatched a late goal to leave the
Euro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> play-off delicately 
balanced as Sweden won the first leg 2-1.

The game exploded into life on the stroke of half-time when the winger 
Forsberg swept Mikael Lustig’s pass beyond Kasper Schmeichel in Denmark’s goal. 
The crowd had barely taken their seats at the start of the second period when 
Forsberg was upended by Thomas Kahlenberg after a surging run into the box and 
Sweden’s captain Ibrahimovic thundered home the resulting spot-kick.

Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark>, who failed to score in 
their final three group games, created few chances until the substitute 
Jorgensen stole in at the far post to poke the ball home in the 80th minute and 
throw his side a lifeline.

With the outside of Stockholm’s Friends Arena lit up in the red, white and 
blue colours of the French flag, a minute’s silence for the victims of Friday’s 
Paris attacks was observed before the game. Both sides also wore black armbands 
in memory of the 129 people who died.

In a game billed as a clash between the rival strikers Ibrahimovic and Nicklas 
Bendtner, the more direct approach of the Swedes paid dividends while the Danes 
put on a remarkably flat performance until their late goal.

Ibra’s strike partner Marcus Berg wasted a number of early chances although 
Bendtner could have put Denmark ahead before Forsberg’s goal when he steered an 
effort just wide.

Denmark dominated the last 10 minutes but could not find an equaliser. The 
second leg is in Copenhagen on Tuesday with the winners securing a place in the 
finals in France.
