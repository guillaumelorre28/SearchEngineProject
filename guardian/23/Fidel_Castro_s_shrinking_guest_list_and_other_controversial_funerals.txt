. All in all, the list of western leaders who won’t be attendingFidel Castro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro>’s funeral is looking more 
notable than those who will.

As with the tributes that poured in after the death of one of the world’s 
longest serving leaders, politicians across the world are split between 
praising Castro for his revolutionary zeal and excoriating his human rights 
record.François Hollande <https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande> 
is sending Ségolène Royal, but Greek prime ministerAlexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> will be there, as will Gerry 
Adams <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gerryadams>, South African 
President Jacob Zuma and Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Putin, is 
apparently busy working on his end-of-year statement for Russian lawmakers – 
the diplomatic equivalent of washing his hair. But Castro is far from the only 
world statesman to have a tricky guest list at his funeral …

The Cuban leader’s most ardent supporter had a funeral that was no less 
controversial. Despite often railing against the US, Obama chose to send a 
delegation – while actorSean Penn <https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn> 
and civil rights activistJesse Jackson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jesse-jackson> attended in a private 
capacity. Iran’s former leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the prize for most 
enthusiastic attendee – landing himselfin hot water with conservative clerics 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-chavez-idUSBRE92405420130308> in 
the Islamic Republic for his overly effusive eulogy in which he suggested 
Chavez would return “alongside Jesus Christ” on resurrection day, and for being 
pictured clasping the hands of Chávez’s grieving mother.

World leaders heaped praise on the three-time Israeli leader ahead of his 
funeral last year, with two American presidents – Obama and Bill Clinton – as 
well as Prince Charles and leaders of France, Mexico, Germany and Canada, among 
the attendees. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, Arab states were less keen on 
attending.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, despite being a close Israeli ally, did not 
attend – nor did Peres’ friend, Jordan’s King Abdullah. Morocco’s king, 
Mohammed VI, sent his personal adviser André Azulai, who is Jewish. Turkish 
president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also gave it a miss, offering a deputy foreign 
minister to represent Turkey at the funeral. Perhaps most surprisingly, the 
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas attended –shaking hands with the 
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu

, and sparking anger among some politicians.

He may have been called a “benevolent dictator” but Tito, who ruled 
Communist-era Yugoslavia for 35 years, had no problem getting world leaders to 
his send-off. Four kings, 31 presidents, six princes, 22 prime ministers and 47 
ministers of foreign affairs from countries on both sides of the cold war came 
along. One hundred and twenty-eight countries sent political delegations to the 
funeral in 1980; James Callaghan, Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gaddafi, the Duke of 
Edinburgh, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Erich Honecker were all there. In fact, 
controversially, only five countries stayed away – including Pinochet’s Chile 
and apartheid-era South Africa.

For controversial funerals in 2016, however, it will be hard to beat the 
Philippines dictator. Although he died back in 1993, Marcos has been kept in a 
refrigerated crypt, until this month, when he was finally buried.

Marcos ruled from 1965 until 1986, when he was overthrown by a popular revolt, 
and his martial law, from 1972 to 1981, is said to have caused the deaths of 
3,240 people, imprisonment of 70,000 and torture of 34,000,according to Amnesty 
International 
<http://www.academia.edu/7968581/TORTYUR_Human_Rights_Violations_During_The_Marcos_Regime>
.

Yet despite public outrage, the supreme court ruled the former leader could be 
interred in a heroes’ cemetery – and this month he was secretly buried with a 
21-gun salute. Now campaigners have launchedlegal action to exhume his body
