As my echeverias and aeoniums grow, the rosette develops a long, bare stalk 
that lolls around unattractively. If you cut the stalk hard back, a new rosette 
doesn’t form as it would in most plants. How do I get them back to their 
original state?

Your echeverias and aeoniums are growing leggy because of poor light levels. 
They need somewhere warm, with lots of direct sunlight; too little and they 
wander to find more.

You may be cutting them back too hard and discarding the bit you should keep, 
which is the top half of the plant. Cut off the rosette so that there is an 
inch or two of stem just below the bottom leaf. Leave this for a day or two, 
somewhere out of direct sunlight, but warm, so the stem can callus over and 
start to produce new roots. Then insert this in a pot with new compost and lots 
of grit for drainage. Keep it out of direct sunlight so that it doesn’t dry out 
while it reroots. Once this is done, move it somewhere sunny.

You can also propagate from the leaves of an echeveria; allow them to callus 
over before carefully nudging the base into some compost so they lie on their 
side. Miraculously, they will reroot. There areYouTube videos

started propagating.
