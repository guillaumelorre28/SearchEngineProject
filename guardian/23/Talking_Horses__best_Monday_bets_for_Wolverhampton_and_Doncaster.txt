Today’s best bets, by John O’Hara

The racing on offer today is what you would expect for a Monday but there are 
winners to be found and I strongly fancy that crafty old Yorkshireman Mick 
Easterby to get among them withBabouska (4.05) in Wolverhampton’s handicap over 
an extended nine furlongs.

The daughter of Monsieur Bond had run four times over six furlongs without so 
much as showing her face but when Easterby stepped her up to a mile for the 
first time she made the frame and looked for all the world that a step up in 
trip again would suit.

Easterby kept her to a mile at Newcastle for the next run and she won well, 
staying on very strongly. She has been raised 4lb for that which is more than 
fair and, with an extra furlong and a half, I think she can double her winning 
tally at odds of around 7-2.

Cliff (1.55) is another horse in great form, and won for Josephine Gordon 
three runs ago. He has hardly messed up since, with two very close seconds. 
Lewis Edmunds rides today and knows the horse very well, so don’t be put off by 
that. He is as genuine as the day is long and, in the form he is in, if all 
drops right, he can win again. The best odds as I type are 2-1.

Without doubt the best racing of the day is up at Doncaster where they have a 
six-race jumps card. Alan King has his horses in flying form, with 10 winners 
since Boxing Day, and he can make it 11 in the opener on Town Moor withZipple 
Back (1.00).

The Sendawar gelding has been knocking on the door of late in his three 
hurdling attempts and this looks the ideal opportunity to break his maiden at 
7-4 or thereabouts.
