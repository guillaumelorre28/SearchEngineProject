This weekend saw the UK release of Burnt, a film about a chef, played by 
Bradley Cooper <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper>, who is so 
desperate for success that he is driven to spout such nonsense as “I don’t want 
my restaurant to be a place where you come and eat,” and “I want people to sit 
at that table and be sick … with longing,” which makes you think he is less a 
chef and more a sort of elaborate Borat-style spoof.

But Cooper’s unstoppable punchability isn’t even the worst thing about the 
film. The worst thing about Burnt is the fact that it is called Burnt. It is a 
dog of a title – both grammatically obscure and, onomatopoeically, the noise 
you make when you barf your lunch into a bin. And, just to exacerbate things, 
it is actually the film’s third title. Originally Burnt was called Chef, 
because it is about a chef, but it was beaten to the punch by Jon Favreau’s 
2014 movie. Then it was renamed Adam Jones, which was similarly kiboshed, on 
the basis that you could give the world’s finest minds a million years and they 
still wouldn’t be able to come up with a film title less memorable than Adam 
Jones.

So Burnt it is. Will the last-minute name-change help? It is hard to say – 
movies change titles all the time, for better or worse. Here are some that 
worked, and some that really didn’t.

 Why didn’t they just call it All You Need is Kill? 
This movie already had a brilliant name. It was called All You Need is Kill, 
after the Hiroshi Sakurazaka novel it was adapted from. “But what if the word 
Kill is too violent for a film about a man who dies repeatedly in his quest to 
murder an entire army of aliens?”, worried Hollywood executives. So, instead, 
it was called Edge of Tomorrow: a title that managed to be a) meaningless, b) 
bland and c)the key lyric of the Saved by the Bell: The College Years theme tune
 
<https://thedissolve.com/news/2410-coolness-edge-of-tomorrow-with-edge-of-tomorrow-fr/>
. It was such a bad choice that, for its DVD release, the film wasrepackaged 
again as Live Die Repeat

 Frozen mimicked Tangled’s formula of renaming classic fairytales with blunt 
adjectives 
Since the 1940s, Disney had been trying to make a film of Hans Christian 
Andersen’s The Snow Queen, but it repeatedly failed because the character of 
the Snow Queen is such a catastrophic meanie. It was not until someone 
suggested changing the title toFrozen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen> 
– mimicking Tangled’s formula of renaming classic fairytales with blunt 
adjectives – that things fell into place. Great news for Disney, terrible news 
for anyone who has ever had to spend an entire long-haul flight listening to a 
six-year-old girl bellow Let it Go.

 Hancock – a sanitised version of Tonight He Comes 
For years, Tonight He Comes – the story of a porn-addicted superhero and 
attempted rapist – was considered one of the best unmade scripts in Hollywood. 
But somewhere along the line, Will Smith came aboard, the violence was scaled 
back and Tonight He Comes became Hancock, the story of a superhero who acts 
exactly likeWill Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/film/willsmith> would if he 
drank recreationally and had a slightly straggly beard.

 It probably would have been less frightening if it had been called Head Cheese 
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre> is a perfect 
title for a film, informing viewers that they are about to witness a massacre 
that takes place in Texas with a chainsaw. However, there is a good chance that 
the film would not have become a classic had it gone with its previous title of 
Head Cheese. Thank goodness someone had the sense to realise early on that 
nothing is less scary than an American potted meat product.

 The original title, Star Beast, sounds like a high-school metal band 
The late 1970s. Two writers decide to pen a claustrophobic thriller about a 
murderous alien that runs riot aboard a distant spacecraft. The name of that 
film? Star Beast. Fortunately, someone realises that Star Beast sounds like the 
name of the world’s worst high school metal band, and the title is changed to
Alien <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alien>. Things are never the same again.
