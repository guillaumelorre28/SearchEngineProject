All eyes are on the Opec meeting next week, to see if oil producers can agree 
an output cut.But the weekly Baker Hughes rig count from the US still excites 
some interest.

In the latest figures, a couple of days early due to Thanksgiving, the report 
showed 5 gas and oil rigs were added last week to 593. This marks the biggest 
monthly rise since July.

The news has seen Brent crude, which was slightly up ahead of the figures, 
slip back around 0.18% to $49.03 a barrel.

On that note it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets edge lower

Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting yet another record, European 
markets were in a more lacklustre mood. Bond yields jumped after Reuters 
reported that the European Central Bank was considering lending out more of the 
bonds it had bought, in an effort to boost liquidity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/23/estate-agents-shares-slump-after-government-fees-clampdown-business-live?page=with:block-583579b1e4b0da4920d6b376#block-583579b1e4b0da4920d6b376>

In the UK the Autumn Statement was the big economic event. Chris Beauchamp, 
chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The autumn statement will command the headlines, but the broad market impact 
has been limited. Aside from the hit to estate agents this morning, 
housebuilders were boosted by Mr Hammond’s plan to build more homes, but the 
impact was limited. Indeed, while the pound did gain against the US dollar in 
the period of the statement itself, the gains were rapidly wiped out by a surge 
in US durable goods orders. The resultant push higher in the dollar sent other 
currencies lower, indicating that the rally in the greenback is not done yet.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 2.01 points or 0.03% at 6817.71 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.48% to 10,662.44 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.42% at 4529.21 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% at 16,532.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8627.5 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 632.52 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.15% at 
19051, having earlier hit another new record of 19067.

Greece close to concluding bailout talks - Tsipras

Helena Smith

Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has announced the country is very 
close to concluding bailout negotiations with creditors. But in a new twist to 
the debt-stricken nation’s bid to regain economic certainty, core eurozone 
member states also said that they would cancel talks expected to focus on 
Greece this Friday. Helena Smith reports from Athens:

The Greek prime minister was in upbeat mood as he predicted that negotiations 
with creditors would be completed by December 5 a move, he said, that would 
automatically open the way to crucial debt relief discussions.

Addressing MPs in his leftwing Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras insisted that 
while his two-party government was implementing its bailout commitments “to the 
letter” it would never yield to what he described as “absurd demands” creditors 
were also making over labour reforms.

“We re not going to discuss absurd demands whether they be new measures or, 
even worse, measures after the [EU] program ends [in 2018].”

Tsipras has seen his popularity ratings plummet as his coalition has forged 
ahead with unpopular tax hikes, budget and pension cuts, the price of rescue 
funds to keep the country afloat.

Working on the assumption that conclusion of the review will trigger debt 
relief talks, Athens is keen to end the negotiations by the time eurozone 
finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5.

But Germany’s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has assiduously 
attempted to shoot down any such hope, telling German media earlier this week 
that it would be a disservice to Greece and its reform progress if its 
monumental debt mountain was cut.

Despite the widely held view that the country’s debt load is at the root of 
its economic ills, Schauble claimed that Greece would not face a debt repayment 
problem for the next ten years. The international Monetary Fund has been 
Athens’ biggest ally in the debt writedown battle, saying it will not sign up 
to its third €86bn rescue package until the issue is resolved.

Hopes of ending that row were brought to an abrupt halt today when the German 
finance ministry announced that talks aimed at securing the IMF’s participation 
in the bailout program would not be going ahead. Finance ministers of core EU 
countries had been due to meet this Friday to discuss the possible concessions 
Brussels could offer to bring the Washington-based organization on board.

Wall Street opens lower after record run

The post-election rally which has taken US markets to new peaks has stuttered 
in early trading, as a fall in the healthcare sector has taken some of the 
shine off.

Pharmaceutical companies had been in demand since Donald Trump’s victory, on 
the basis that the new administration would not bring in Hillary Clinton’s 
threatened price controls.

But a trial failure for its Alzheimer’s treatment sent shares in Eli Lilly 
sharply lower, dragging down other companies developing similar drugs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is current down 10 points or 0.06%, while the 
S&P 500 opened down 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.38%.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

After a couple of months in the doldrums, today’s data shows durable goods 
orders are at their highest since February. This could keep dollar-buying 
popular and also increase the likelihood of an interest rate hike.

Along with rising inflation and a strong dollar, today’s better than expected 
numbers are another positive pointer and the Federal Reserve is looking more 
likely than ever to buckle under increasing pressure to raise rates on December 
14th.

The greenback will now be given a breather as markets shut up shop for 
tomorrow’s Thanksgiving and Friday looks a light day.

US manufactured goods orders rebound in October

Away from the UK autumn statement, there are some strong US figures.

Orders for durable goods - longer lasting products such as computers, toasters 
and machinery - rebounded in October after a decline in September. They rose 
0.4%, in line with expectations, while the September figure was revised from a 
1.3% drop to 1.4%. But the recovery suggests that theUS economy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> is strengthening in the fourth 
quarter, and adds for fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates in December.

Meanwhile the number of Americans registering for unemployment benefits rose 
from a 43 year low last week, up 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000. But 
this is still consistent with a tightening jobs market.

Over in Europe again, and Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank 
wants to loan out some of the government debt it has bought to provide more 
liquidity in the bond market. Reuters says:

The European Central Bank is looking for ways to lend out more of its huge 
pile of government debt to avert a freeze in the 5.5 trillion euro short-term 
funding market that underpins the financial system, central bank sources told 
Reuters.

The ECB has bought more than a trillion euros ($1.06 trillion) of euro zone 
government bonds in a bid to shore up economic growth and inflation in the euro 
zone. For the most part the bank is holding these bonds.

By doing so, it has taken away the key ingredient for repurchase agreements, 
or repos, whereby financial firms lend to each other against collateral, 
typically high-rated government bonds such as Germany’s.

Repo is used by investment funds to finance trading and is regarded by the ECB 
as a key avenue to transmit its own monetary stimulus to the economy.

A freeze in repo activity risks undoing some of the ECB’s stimulus by 
hampering lending between financial companies and leaving bond markets 
vulnerable to sharp selloffs.

To avert this, the ECB wants to make it easier for banks to borrow the bonds 
that it has bought so that they can be used as collateral for repo loans, the 
sources said.

The pensions regulator is currently giving evidence to MPs on, among other 
things, BHS.

Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions 
committee Frank Field wrote to the regulator 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/sir-philip-green-yacht-bhs-frank-field-pension-scheme>
 asking if Sir Philip Green’s superyacht and other assets could be seized to 
help plug the gap in the BHS pension fund.

My colleague Graham Ruddick is following the hearing:

Boss of Pensions Regulator says "door remains open" for deal with Sir Philip 
Green over BHS pension scheme

Pensions Regulator confirms it could take assets as part of pension settlement 
with Green, but these would need property valued

Frank Field asking if Green's yacht can be taken is pure PR. Ultimately would 
only happen if Green chooses to make it part of settlement 1/2

or if he has no other cash and assets to raise money for settlement or legal 
demand so has to include yacht (and he does have the cash) 2/2

In other words, Sir Philip Green handing over his yacht to BHS pension scheme 
is just not going to happen (unfortunately)

Only five MPs present for hearing with Pensions Regulator. It may be autumn 
statement day, but surely could be better....

Back with the fall in estate agency shares, and analyst Anthony Codling at 
broker Jefferies International said:

Our view is that it would not be logical to ban fees outright, for instance 
inventory checks are usually outsourced to third parties and used to safeguard 
both landlord and tenant, perhaps these fees should be split.

Credit referencing fees: we think it fair that tenants can demonstrate that 
they have the ability to pay the rent.

Where fees are possibly unfair are, for instance, blanket fees of £300 to set 
up a standard tenancy agreement or a £60 additional charge to move in on a 
Saturday, such fees we believe generate high margins for the agent at the 
expense of the so called JAM tenants (Just About Managing).

All eyes are on the Opec meeting next week, to see if oil producers can agree 
an output cut.But the weekly Baker Hughes rig count from the US still excites 
some interest.

In the latest figures, a couple of days early due to Thanksgiving, the report 
showed 5 gas and oil rigs were added last week to 593. This marks the biggest 
monthly rise since July.

The news has seen Brent crude, which was slightly up ahead of the figures, 
slip back around 0.18% to $49.03 a barrel.

On that note it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting yet another record, European 
markets were in a more lacklustre mood. Bond yields jumped after Reuters 
reported that the European Central Bank was considering lending out more of the 
bonds it had bought, in an effort to boost liquidity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/23/estate-agents-shares-slump-after-government-fees-clampdown-business-live?page=with:block-583579b1e4b0da4920d6b376#block-583579b1e4b0da4920d6b376>

In the UK the Autumn Statement was the big economic event. Chris Beauchamp, 
chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The autumn statement will command the headlines, but the broad market impact 
has been limited. Aside from the hit to estate agents this morning, 
housebuilders were boosted by Mr Hammond’s plan to build more homes, but the 
impact was limited. Indeed, while the pound did gain against the US dollar in 
the period of the statement itself, the gains were rapidly wiped out by a surge 
in US durable goods orders. The resultant push higher in the dollar sent other 
currencies lower, indicating that the rally in the greenback is not done yet.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 2.01 points or 0.03% at 6817.71 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.48% to 10,662.44 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.42% at 4529.21 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% at 16,532.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8627.5 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 632.52 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.15% at 
19051, having earlier hit another new record of 19067.
 
Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has announced the country is very 
close to concluding bailout negotiations with creditors. But in a new twist to 
the debt-stricken nation’s bid to regain economic certainty, core eurozone 
member states also said that they would cancel talks expected to focus on 
Greece this Friday. Helena Smith reports from Athens:

The Greek prime minister was in upbeat mood as he predicted that negotiations 
with creditors would be completed by December 5 a move, he said, that would 
automatically open the way to crucial debt relief discussions.

Addressing MPs in his leftwing Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras insisted that 
while his two-party government was implementing its bailout commitments “to the 
letter” it would never yield to what he described as “absurd demands” creditors 
were also making over labour reforms.

“We re not going to discuss absurd demands whether they be new measures or, 
even worse, measures after the [EU] program ends [in 2018].”

Tsipras has seen his popularity ratings plummet as his coalition has forged 
ahead with unpopular tax hikes, budget and pension cuts, the price of rescue 
funds to keep the country afloat.

Working on the assumption that conclusion of the review will trigger debt 
relief talks, Athens is keen to end the negotiations by the time eurozone 
finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5.

But Germany’s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has assiduously 
attempted to shoot down any such hope, telling German media earlier this week 
that it would be a disservice to Greece and its reform progress if its 
monumental debt mountain was cut.

Despite the widely held view that the country’s debt load is at the root of 
its economic ills, Schauble claimed that Greece would not face a debt repayment 
problem for the next ten years. The international Monetary Fund has been 
Athens’ biggest ally in the debt writedown battle, saying it will not sign up 
to its third €86bn rescue package until the issue is resolved.

Hopes of ending that row were brought to an abrupt halt today when the German 
finance ministry announced that talks aimed at securing the IMF’s participation 
in the bailout program would not be going ahead. Finance ministers of core EU 
countries had been due to meet this Friday to discuss the possible concessions 
Brussels could offer to bring the Washington-based organization on board.
 
The post-election rally which has taken US markets to new peaks has stuttered 
in early trading, as a fall in the healthcare sector has taken some of the 
shine off.

Pharmaceutical companies had been in demand since Donald Trump’s victory, on 
the basis that the new administration would not bring in Hillary Clinton’s 
threatened price controls.

But a trial failure for its Alzheimer’s treatment sent shares in Eli Lilly 
sharply lower, dragging down other companies developing similar drugs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is current down 10 points or 0.06%, while the 
S&P 500 opened down 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.38%.
 
Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

After a couple of months in the doldrums, today’s data shows durable goods 
orders are at their highest since February. This could keep dollar-buying 
popular and also increase the likelihood of an interest rate hike.

Along with rising inflation and a strong dollar, today’s better than expected 
numbers are another positive pointer and the Federal Reserve is looking more 
likely than ever to buckle under increasing pressure to raise rates on December 
14th.

The greenback will now be given a breather as markets shut up shop for 
tomorrow’s Thanksgiving and Friday looks a light day.
 
Away from the UK autumn statement, there are some strong US figures.

Orders for durable goods - longer lasting products such as computers, toasters 
and machinery - rebounded in October after a decline in September. They rose 
0.4%, in line with expectations, while the September figure was revised from a 
1.3% drop to 1.4%. But the recovery suggests that theUS economy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> is strengthening in the fourth 
quarter, and adds for fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates in December.

Meanwhile the number of Americans registering for unemployment benefits rose 
from a 43 year low last week, up 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000. But 
this is still consistent with a tightening jobs market.

Over in Europe again, and Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank 
wants to loan out some of the government debt it has bought to provide more 
liquidity in the bond market. Reuters says:

The European Central Bank is looking for ways to lend out more of its huge 
pile of government debt to avert a freeze in the 5.5 trillion euro short-term 
funding market that underpins the financial system, central bank sources told 
Reuters.

The ECB has bought more than a trillion euros ($1.06 trillion) of euro zone 
government bonds in a bid to shore up economic growth and inflation in the euro 
zone. For the most part the bank is holding these bonds.

By doing so, it has taken away the key ingredient for repurchase agreements, 
or repos, whereby financial firms lend to each other against collateral, 
typically high-rated government bonds such as Germany’s.

Repo is used by investment funds to finance trading and is regarded by the ECB 
as a key avenue to transmit its own monetary stimulus to the economy.

A freeze in repo activity risks undoing some of the ECB’s stimulus by 
hampering lending between financial companies and leaving bond markets 
vulnerable to sharp selloffs.

To avert this, the ECB wants to make it easier for banks to borrow the bonds 
that it has bought so that they can be used as collateral for repo loans, the 
sources said.

The pensions regulator is currently giving evidence to MPs on, among other 
things, BHS.

Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions 
committee Frank Field wrote to the regulator 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/sir-philip-green-yacht-bhs-frank-field-pension-scheme>
 asking if Sir Philip Green’s superyacht and other assets could be seized to 
help plug the gap in the BHS pension fund.
