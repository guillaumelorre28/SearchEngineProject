An ancient monster rises from the murky depths of print sales. Bulks (ie 
copies punters can pick up free in hotels, airports etc) are back. At first 
sight, if you look at September’s ABC figures, theGuardian, down 5.5% year on 
year, and theObserver, down 5.9%, seem to be trailing in serious newspaper 
sales: even though – eschewing bulks – they both increased circulation month on 
month and, in theObserver’s case, for the sixth straight month in a row.

So how come that the Times was a whopping 12% up over September 2015 and the 
Telegraph down only 4.7%? Answer: because the Thunderer has added a walloping 
53,681 bulks to its bottom line and theTelegraph, which forswore bulks 
entirely, has suddenly conjured up 20,992 of them. Deal only in sold copies 
from your newsagent, and theTimes is actually down 0.8% on the year and the 
Telegraph 9.1%.

Now: there are perfectly good sampling reasons for printing a modicum of 
bulks, just as there are good reasons for sending copies overseas and claiming 
a sales figure that covers the entire order. ABC rules allow all this. But when 
digital reach figures are a hot, foggy topic in adland, you’d hope that poor 
old print would be clear as crystal, not mud.
