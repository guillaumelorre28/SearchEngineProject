alongsideEmily Blunt 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2Femily-blunt&ei=4HatU7r1KpTe7AaAjoGYAg&usg=AFQjCNGpLCUARWayj_oaA7IF9gaQ79D5Tg&sig2=iuwGKikdf8v92Ry_zArMSg&bvm=bv.69837884,d.ZGU>
 inArthur and Mike <https://www.theguardian.com/film/arthur-and-mike>, a road 
movie in which Firth plays Wallace, a failed amateur golfer, and Blunt plays 
Mike, his mysterious companion. ReadPeter Bradshaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbradshaw>'s review of the film here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/26/arthur-and-mike-review-blunt-firth>
.

Firth last month pulled out of his role voicing Paddington bear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/18/colin-firth-conscious-uncoupling-paddington-bear-film>
 in the upcoming live action movie. The film had beenalmost entirely shot 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFuzMlfZGWM> before Firth left the project – 
or "consciously uncoupled" from it, saying: "It's been bittersweet to see this 
delightful creature take shape and come to the sad realisation that he simply 
doesn't have my voice" – a decision whichthis paper praised 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2014%2Fjun%2F18%2Fin-praise-of-colin-firth&ei=E5CtU6LHBoSp0QX974CIBg&usg=AFQjCNEGiluFeRaSOSddM9K04nvfGIYuEw&sig2=Ei02ZmLH4iCBDRUpFJCOAw&bvm=bv.69837884,d.d2k>
 as a rare example of an actor doing what is best for a project and not his own 
celebrity.


Firth has excelled in plenty of other films, however. Here are our picks of 
his performances. Please add your own suggestions and comments in the thread 
below.

A Single Man (2009) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cz1SsfxFDk>


Adapted from Christopher Isherwood 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC0QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2Fchristopher-isherwood&ei=s32tU4fOH8TA7AbG64CIAw&usg=AFQjCNFzzqdNoitjPQaQmSlaXujqWTXLQg&sig2=RhIRA_Z09MNTEtZMhsI3WA&bvm=bv.69837884,d.d2k>

 was the directorial debut ofTom Ford 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffashion%2Ftom-ford&ei=h32tU6DWGMKW0AWP0YCwBg&usg=AFQjCNFCyYAErWLRBqBNweIQ7cscDvrV_g&sig2=GgcQcPKszL218FGy45s1Vw&bvm=bv.69837884,d.d2k>
, the ex-Gucci creative director. Astunningly beautiful film 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MCgJOxw788>, Firth gives a nuanced, 
heartbreaking performance as George, a depressed and repressed British college 
professor living in California and grieving for his partner, Jim (Matthew Goode 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2008%2Fsep%2F21%2F1&ei=FX6tU6GbBubT7AapwICYBg&usg=AFQjCNGks8w_FxCVeB3AtzNnGFEtuuSBNw&sig2=-YUqmI3aeeXQLtWTJUqPOQ&bvm=bv.69837884,d.d2k>
). Around him; the 60s swing, mescaline takes the edge off theCuba missile 
crisis 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCuban_missile_crisis&ei=sn-tU8TDLYbe7Aaq1YG4CA&usg=AFQjCNHUsGqkfvq6v_edTRUgFc7oVTDo-g&sig2=VtFLt9na8uvrMH-AR_BLiA&bvm=bv.69837884,d.ZGU>
, and homophobia mingles with the humidity. Firth is brilliant throughout, from 
portraying the quiet isolation of depression, to theimportance of old 
friendships <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65WoUIo4rAw>, to the animal 
instincts of lust. Peter Bradshaw commented: "Delicately, and rather 
brilliantly, Firth suggests how his quiet heroism is ­mingled with notes of 
irony and self-deprecation. It is a poignant, deeply compassionate portrait." 
He earned a best actor Academy nomination for his troubles.

impediment after the abdication of Edward VIII was unanimously applauded by 
critics. The film currently has a94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes

 proves there's fizzing life in old-school British period dramas – it's acted 
and directed with such sweep, verve, darting lightness. George VI's talking 
cure is gripping", was Peter Bradshaw's verdict.

Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gxOffgz6VI>


No list of Colin Firth's greatest moments would be complete without mention of 
his various meta-portrayals of Darcy. Firth excelled asJane Austen

's love interest – which endeared Firth to a new generation and made his name 
in Hollywood as a leading man. We swooned overhis Reindeer jumper 
<http://independentgentleman.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mark-darcy-christmas-jumper.jpg>
 and became all flustered over his pinstripe suits. We liked him, just as he 
was. Firth really proved his comedy chops here; shame the sequelBridget Jones: 
The Edge of Reason

 as his muse, Firth pulled off the difficult task of portraying a real-life 
artist (Derek Jacobi as Francis Bacon

The movie, adapted from theTracy Chevalier

 novel, has truly beautiful cinematography to match the output of its 
protagonist.In a four-star review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/16/dvdreviews.shopping> we called it 
a "a tremendously intelligent and detailed homage" and noted that "the 
production design by Ben Van Os is outstanding". Worth a watch for art buffs 
and non-art buffs alike.

And When Did You Last See Your Father? 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8DvJPkH_K8> (2007) <>


An oft-overlooked film based on the quietly affecting memoir of Blake 
Morrison's experience 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview13>
 of remembering his father before his death. This moving film, directed byAnand

gave it four stars on its release
