Leading shares have started the month on a positive note despite some mixed 
company news and poor manufacturing data from China.

Mining shares are having a mixed time, however. Anglo American has added 
20.15p to 500.4p after positive news on diamond sales from its De Beers’ 
subsidiary. Rough diamond sales for the second sales cycle rose to $610m from 
$545m in the first cycle. De Beers chief executive Philippe Mellier said:

Retailer restocking after the end of year holiday season is supporting demand 
for polished diamonds and in turn, we are seeing improved demand...for rough 
diamonds. However, we remain mindful of the need for a cautious approach as the 
recovery continues.

But Fresnillo has fallen 26.5p to 973.5p after the Mexican precious metals 
miner reported a 15.4% drop in full year profits to £212.4m.

And Glencore is down 3.35p at 129.9p as it unveiled a 32% fall in annual 
profits to $8.7bn as well as $5.8bn of impairment charges.

But overall the FTSE 100 has added 18.20 points to 6115.29, with the 
disappointing Chinese purchasing managers survey prompting talk of further 
stimulus measures from the central bank.

UK manufacturing activity slumped to a near three year low, suggesting any 
interest rate rise is unlikely to be on the agenda for some time. Meanwhile 
eurozone PMIs also disappointed.

Elsewhere Barclays has fallen 17.1p to 154.95p following a 2% drop in full 
year profits.

Ashtead is down 131p at 793p, the biggest loser in the leading index, despite 
a 20% rise in nine month profits. Analysts are concerned about the impact of a 
US slowdown on the equipment rental group. Charles Huggins at Hargreaves 
Lansdown said:

Ashtead <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ashteadgroup> generates the bulk 
of its profit in US non-residential construction markets where conditions 
remain favourable - for now. However, the market is clearly worried about a 
potential US slowdown. Ashtead’s plans to cut back capital expenditure and 
reduce leverage are sensible in this context, but do little to allay investors’ 
concerns of tougher times ahead.

But Direct Line is up 11.5p at 400.1p as the insurer reported better than 
expected full year profits of £507.5m.

The biggest rise in the FTSE 100 is London Stock Exchange, up 199p at £28.77 as
US group Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering making an offer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/nyse-owner-plots-offer-for-london-stock-exchange-deutsche-borse>
, thus barging into the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.

Among the mid-caps Greggs, 157p better at £11.92, and Just Eat, 16.2p better 
at 401.9p, both benefited from positive updates.

On Just Eat, Peel Hunt said:

The margin performance in the UK is materially better than we had expected and 
this appears to be long-term fundamental as opposed to a short-term boost. 
There is a lot of noise around the delivery market and whilst there are risks, 
we believe these have been overplayed in the short term. Given the margin 
surprise and recent share price weakness, we move to add from hold.
