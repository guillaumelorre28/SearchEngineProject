Sterling near one month high against dollar

The pound is holding onto its gains, which were inspired first by the High 
Court vote on Brexit, and then by theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> keeping interest 
rates on hold.

It is now up 1.2% against the dollar at $1.2447, having been as high as 
$1.2494. Against the euro it is 1.19% better at €1.1217.

and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets edge lower

The High Court ruling that parliament should have a vote on Brexit put the cat 
among the pigeons, sending the pound soaring and the UK market lower. News that 
theBank of England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> 
had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains, and 
kept the pressure on shares. The FTSE 100 is dominated by exporters and 
overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound, so the reverse is also 
true. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 managed to gain ground despite the 
uncertainty.

European markets outperformed the UK, helped by positive updates from ING, 
SocGen and Credit Suisse.

The US was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of 
next week’s presidential election. There was also one eye on Friday’s non farm 
payroll numbers.

The closing scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 54.91 points or 0.8% at 6790.51 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,325.88 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.07% at 4411.68 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.33% to 16,419.90 
 * Spain’s Ibex bucked the trend and ended 0.07% higher at 8879.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.57% to 578.23 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 8 points or 
0.04%.

The rise in the pound following the court ruling on Brexit and the Bank of 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> keeping 
interest rates on hold may not be the end of it, says Kathleen Brooks, research 
director at City Index.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> is currently up 1.25% 
against the dollar at $1.2450, and incidently, is also stronger against the 
euro, up 1.24% at €1.1224. Brooks said:

Although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the US election, 
if Hillary Clinton does manage to win next week, then the pound may continue to 
outperform the G10. The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed 
Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to 
extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England’s 
inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are 
the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.

Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears 
temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in 
the near term. If this happens then we could see the pound/dollar move towards 
the 1.25-1.30 range between now and the Fed meeting in December.

Back with the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> and its forecast 
changes, Unicredit Research is now expecting UK interest rates to remain on 
hold next year.

Daniel Vernazza, its lead UK economist, said:

The tone of the Inflation Report, MPC minutes and the Governor’s press 
conference were notably “less dovish” than we had expected. In particular, the 
MPC said monetary policy could now move in “either direction” to changes to the 
economic outlook, cancelling its guidance from August that a cut was the most 
likely next move. As a result, we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut 
in the bank rate in February next year. We now expect the MPC to remain on hold 
throughout 2017. So, what’s changed in the last three months?

First, economic activity has been much stronger than the BoE had 
expected...Second, the further depreciation of sterling since the beginning of 
October will push up inflation meaningfully over the forecast period.

Skipping across the Atlantic for a moment, and news of a slowdown in US 
service sector growth 
<https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/nonmfgrob.cfm?SSO=1>, 
partly due to caution about next week’s election.

The ISM non-manufacturing index fell from 57.1 in September to 54.8 last 
month, below expectations of a level of 56.

Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing survey committee, said:

There has been a slight cooling-off in the non-manufacturing sector 
month-over-month, indicating that last month’s increases weren’t sustainable. 
Respondent’s comments remain mostly positive about business conditions and the 
overall economy. Several comments were made about the uncertainty on the impact 
of the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

Meanwhile orders for manufactured goods rose by 0.3% in September, up from 
0.4% the previous month, the third straight month of increases.

Following the figures the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points or 
0.2%. The dollar is still down against the pound, with sterling at $1.2453, up 
1.26% following the High Court Brexit decision and theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> deciding not to 
cut interest rates again.

Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, is now forecasting UK interest rates 
to stay at 0.25% for some time. He also expects growth to be slower than the 
Bank is predicting but inflation to be higher:

We are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a 
low of 0.10%

We now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at 
0.25% for a prolonged period (very possibly to 2020). Ahead of the November MPC 
meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that 
interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 
2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by 
Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and 
diminishing fundamentals for consumers.

We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> on growth but see 
inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 
2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 
2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking 
around 3.5% around spring 2018.

It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding 
framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be 
adjusted. This follows recent comments by politicians that could be construed 
to threaten the Bank of England’s independence as well as some attacks on Mr. 
Carney and the MPC – particularly on their stance on the risks from Brexit.

The TUC is also worried that households face a severe wage squeeze next year, 
as the weaker pound drives up inflation.

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady fears Britain can’t afford a second dose 
of falling real wages (as seems possible, if companies don’t provide 
inflation-busting pay rises).


O’Grady says: 

“The Bank’s warning must spur the government into action so that workers don’t 
pay the price of Brexit with a squeeze on wages.

“UK workers already suffered the largest fall in real wages after the 
financial crisis of any developed country except Greece – they can’t afford 
another hit to their pay packets.

“The Chancellor should use the Autumn Statement to protect jobs and wages, 
with new investment in infrastructure like roads, rail, green energy and homes. 
And the national minimum wage must be increased to keep it well ahead of 
inflation.”

And here’s a reminder of the BoE’s new ‘fan chart’, showing how it expects 
inflation to romp upwards in 2017 and 2018.

Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, agrees with Mark 
Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> that households are 
going to find life tougher next year, as Brexit uncertainty continues to swirl.

He says:

GDP growth is likely to slow next year, on the back of a squeeze in real 
household incomes and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.”

Mark Carney's press conference: six things we learned
 Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA 
As suspected, Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> 
faced some robust questioning at today’sQuarterly Inflation report.

The governor found himself having to defend the Bank’s forecasting powers, 
after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth (to 1.4%), just three 
months after slashing it drastically.


He also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b3343e4b029b92ca45204#block-581b3343e4b029b92ca45204>
, and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond June 2019. Personally I 
can’t believe he’d reject the chance for more meetings with the UK economics 
press pack.

But what did we learn?

1) Life is going to get tougher, especially for poorer families.

Carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b365ce4b029b92ca45215#block-581b365ce4b029b92ca45215>
, saying:

We see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 
2018.”

That’s because the CPI rate is expected to surge to 2.7% in 2017, and hit 2.8% 
in 2018 -- which is higher than wage growth today.

And he said the Bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to 
rise over target (driving down real wages) and higher unemployment (which would 
happen if the Bank tightened monetary policy).

2) The economy is doing better than the Bank expected....

Alongside death and taxes, you can be pretty certain that the Bank of 
England’s economic forecasts will be tweaked before long.

But still, today’s upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite 
significant - and show that the BoE was too gloomy about the immediate impact 
of voting to leave the EU.

Carney painted a picture of serene calm:

The MPC had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the 
remainder of 2016. But consumption has been even stronger, with households 
appearing to entirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties.

For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their 
absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around 
the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and 
competitive. Confidence is solid.

Indeed, he had to pour cold water on the suggestion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b39ebe4b0d073c27d1152#block-581b39ebe4b0d073c27d1152>
 that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street.

3)....but there are signs that things are getting worse

The Bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back, as they watch Brexit 
play out:

That uncertainty does bear down on business investment,that effect builds with 
time, that lower business investment has consequences for employment.

4) We should get used to Brexit uncertainty

The governor said that today’s court ruling that MPs must vote on article 50 
is simplyan example of the drama we should get used to 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b30eee4b0d073c27d112f#block-581b30eee4b0d073c27d112f>
, as Britain leaves the EU.

 Obviously I am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the 
prospects here, but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise 
this process. “The negotiations haven’t even yet begun, there will be 
uncertainty, there will be volatility around those negotiations as they 
proceed, and I would view this as one example of that uncertainty.”

5) The next interest rate move could be up.

Britain’s primary schools are full of children who weren’t even born when the 
Bank last raised interest rates (it was July 2007, just before the credit crunch
 <https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/05/interestrates.interestrates>
). And a few months ago, many City economists were convinced rates would fall 
to 0.1% soon.

Not any more, with the BoE dropping its guidance that the next move is 
probably down.

As Carney puts it:

You can envisage scenarios where it goes either way. We don’t have a bias in 
terms of direction of where the next move will be. Again, in a period of a fair 
bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be 
merited.

Make of that what you will....
Katie Allen (@KatieAllenGdn) 
Carney asked if next rate move more likely up or down: "you can envision 
scenarios where either direction is merited" "could go either way"

6) The Bank of England isn’t at war with Downing Street.

Asked about Theresa May’s criticism of monetary policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b38c9e4b07ceadb3a209f#block-581b38c9e4b07ceadb3a209f>
, he argued:

 “We don’t feel under any pressure from the government,certainly none from the 
prime minister.

I think the prime minister fully supports, and the government fully supports, 
the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take 
those decisions.”

And he also indicated he accepted criticism from MPs, as part of the Bank’s 
accountability. He wouldn’t say whethersome critics should take a vow of silence
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b3546e4b07ceadb3a208e#block-581b3546e4b07ceadb3a208e>
, alas.

A final question.... is there an inflation level that would force the Bank to 
take action?

Carney won’t be lured into setting a figure -- perhaps burned by his previous 
experience of forward guidance.

It all depends what is causing prices to rise over target, and what the best 
response is.
Katie Allen (@KatieAllenGdn) 
Carney: Won't give a numerical limit we will tolerate on inflation. Any limit 
is a product of what's causing inflation overshoot.

Carney: I've got Theresa May's full support

Carney is then asked whether Theresa May’s recent criticism of the Bank’s 
monetary policy, at the Tory party conference, has undermined him.

Q: Does he feel any political pressure to change the bank’s forecasts?

Not at all, he replies.

We don’t feel under any pressure from the government, and especially not from 
the prime minister.

The prime minister, and the government, fully support the monetary policy 
framework we have in place.

Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail tries to get some new forward guidance out of 
the governor.

Q: Can you tell us whether the next move in interest rates is more likely to 
be up, or down?

You can see scenarios where it goes either way, we don’t have a bias, Mark 
Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> replies.

But the monetary policy committee currently unanimously believes that the 
present stance is right.

The pound is holding onto its gains, which were inspired first by the High 
Court vote on Brexit, and then by theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> keeping interest 
rates on hold.

It is now up 1.2% against the dollar at $1.2447, having been as high as 
$1.2494. Against the euro it is 1.19% better at €1.1217.

The High Court ruling that parliament should have a vote on Brexit put the cat 
among the pigeons, sending the pound soaring and the UK market lower. News that 
theBank of England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> 
had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains, and 
kept the pressure on shares. The FTSE 100 is dominated by exporters and 
overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound, so the reverse is also 
true. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 managed to gain ground despite the 
uncertainty.

European markets outperformed the UK, helped by positive updates from ING, 
SocGen and Credit Suisse.

The US was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of 
next week’s presidential election. There was also one eye on Friday’s non farm 
payroll numbers.

The closing scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 54.91 points or 0.8% at 6790.51 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,325.88 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.07% at 4411.68 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.33% to 16,419.90 
 * Spain’s Ibex bucked the trend and ended 0.07% higher at 8879.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.57% to 578.23 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 8 points or 
0.04%.
 
The rise in the pound following the court ruling on Brexit and the Bank of 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> keeping 
interest rates on hold may not be the end of it, says Kathleen Brooks, research 
director at City Index.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> is currently up 1.25% 
against the dollar at $1.2450, and incidently, is also stronger against the 
euro, up 1.24% at €1.1224. Brooks said:

Although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the US election, 
if Hillary Clinton does manage to win next week, then the pound may continue to 
outperform the G10. The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed 
Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to 
extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England’s 
inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are 
the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.

Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears 
temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in 
the near term. If this happens then we could see the pound/dollar move towards 
the 1.25-1.30 range between now and the Fed meeting in December.
 
Back with the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> and its forecast 
changes, Unicredit Research is now expecting UK interest rates to remain on 
hold next year.

Daniel Vernazza, its lead UK economist, said:

The tone of the Inflation Report, MPC minutes and the Governor’s press 
conference were notably “less dovish” than we had expected. In particular, the 
MPC said monetary policy could now move in “either direction” to changes to the 
economic outlook, cancelling its guidance from August that a cut was the most 
likely next move. As a result, we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut 
in the bank rate in February next year. We now expect the MPC to remain on hold 
throughout 2017. So, what’s changed in the last three months?

First, economic activity has been much stronger than the BoE had 
expected...Second, the further depreciation of sterling since the beginning of 
October will push up inflation meaningfully over the forecast period.

Skipping across the Atlantic for a moment, and news of a slowdown in US 
service sector growth 
<https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/nonmfgrob.cfm?SSO=1>, 
partly due to caution about next week’s election.

The ISM non-manufacturing index fell from 57.1 in September to 54.8 last 
month, below expectations of a level of 56.

Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing survey committee, said:

There has been a slight cooling-off in the non-manufacturing sector 
month-over-month, indicating that last month’s increases weren’t sustainable. 
Respondent’s comments remain mostly positive about business conditions and the 
overall economy. Several comments were made about the uncertainty on the impact 
of the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

Meanwhile orders for manufactured goods rose by 0.3% in September, up from 
0.4% the previous month, the third straight month of increases.

Following the figures the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points or 
0.2%. The dollar is still down against the pound, with sterling at $1.2453, up 
1.26% following the High Court Brexit decision and theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> deciding not to 
cut interest rates again.
 
Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, is now forecasting UK interest rates 
to stay at 0.25% for some time. He also expects growth to be slower than the 
Bank is predicting but inflation to be higher:

We are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a 
low of 0.10%

We now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at 
0.25% for a prolonged period (very possibly to 2020). Ahead of the November MPC 
meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that 
interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 
2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by 
Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and 
diminishing fundamentals for consumers.

We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> on growth but see 
inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 
2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 
2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking 
around 3.5% around spring 2018.

It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding 
framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be 
adjusted. This follows recent comments by politicians that could be construed 
to threaten the Bank of England’s independence as well as some attacks on Mr. 
Carney and the MPC – particularly on their stance on the risks from Brexit.







 
The TUC is also worried that households face a severe wage squeeze next year, 
as the weaker pound drives up inflation.

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady fears Britain can’t afford a second dose 
of falling real wages (as seems possible, if companies don’t provide 
inflation-busting pay rises).


O’Grady says: 

“The Bank’s warning must spur the government into action so that workers don’t 
pay the price of Brexit with a squeeze on wages.

“UK workers already suffered the largest fall in real wages after the 
financial crisis of any developed country except Greece – they can’t afford 
another hit to their pay packets.

“The Chancellor should use the Autumn Statement to protect jobs and wages, 
with new investment in infrastructure like roads, rail, green energy and homes. 
And the national minimum wage must be increased to keep it well ahead of 
inflation.”

And here’s a reminder of the BoE’s new ‘fan chart’, showing how it expects 
inflation to romp upwards in 2017 and 2018.

Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, agrees with Mark 
Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> that households are 
going to find life tougher next year, as Brexit uncertainty continues to swirl.

He says:

GDP growth is likely to slow next year, on the back of a squeeze in real 
household incomes and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.”

If you’re just tuning in, here’s Katie Allen’s news story about how UK 
interest rates were left on hold today:

Bank of England signals further rate cuts unlikely and lifts 2017 growth 
forecast
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation>  Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA 
As suspected, Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> 
faced some robust questioning at today’sQuarterly Inflation report.

The governor found himself having to defend the Bank’s forecasting powers, 
after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth (to 1.4%), just three 
months after slashing it drastically.


He also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b3343e4b029b92ca45204#block-581b3343e4b029b92ca45204>
, and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond June 2019. Personally I 
can’t believe he’d reject the chance for more meetings with the UK economics 
press pack.

But what did we learn?

1) Life is going to get tougher, especially for poorer families.

Carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b365ce4b029b92ca45215#block-581b365ce4b029b92ca45215>
, saying:

We see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 
2018.”

That’s because the CPI rate is expected to surge to 2.7% in 2017, and hit 2.8% 
in 2018 -- which is higher than wage growth today.

And he said the Bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to 
rise over target (driving down real wages) and higher unemployment (which would 
happen if the Bank tightened monetary policy).

2) The economy is doing better than the Bank expected....

Alongside death and taxes, you can be pretty certain that the Bank of 
England’s economic forecasts will be tweaked before long.

But still, today’s upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite 
significant - and show that the BoE was too gloomy about the immediate impact 
of voting to leave the EU.

Carney painted a picture of serene calm:

The MPC had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the 
remainder of 2016. But consumption has been even stronger, with households 
appearing to entirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties.

For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their 
absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around 
the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and 
competitive. Confidence is solid.

Indeed, he had to pour cold water on the suggestion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b39ebe4b0d073c27d1152#block-581b39ebe4b0d073c27d1152>
 that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street.

3)....but there are signs that things are getting worse

The Bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back, as they watch Brexit 
play out:

That uncertainty does bear down on business investment,that effect builds with 
time, that lower business investment has consequences for employment.

4) We should get used to Brexit uncertainty

The governor said that today’s court ruling that MPs must vote on article 50 
is simplyan example of the drama we should get used to 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b30eee4b0d073c27d112f#block-581b30eee4b0d073c27d112f>
, as Britain leaves the EU.

 Obviously I am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the 
prospects here, but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise 
this process. “The negotiations haven’t even yet begun, there will be 
uncertainty, there will be volatility around those negotiations as they 
proceed, and I would view this as one example of that uncertainty.”

5) The next interest rate move could be up.

Britain’s primary schools are full of children who weren’t even born when the 
Bank last raised interest rates (it was July 2007, just before the credit crunch
 <https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/05/interestrates.interestrates>
). And a few months ago, many City economists were convinced rates would fall 
to 0.1% soon.

Not any more, with the BoE dropping its guidance that the next move is 
probably down.

As Carney puts it:

You can envisage scenarios where it goes either way. We don’t have a bias in 
terms of direction of where the next move will be. Again, in a period of a fair 
bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be 
merited.

Make of that what you will....
Katie Allen (@KatieAllenGdn) 
Carney asked if next rate move more likely up or down: "you can envision 
scenarios where either direction is merited" "could go either way"

<https://twitter.com/Sathnam/status/794170927928004609> 
6) The Bank of England isn’t at war with Downing Street.

Asked about Theresa May’s criticism of monetary policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b38c9e4b07ceadb3a209f#block-581b38c9e4b07ceadb3a209f>
, he argued:

 “We don’t feel under any pressure from the government,certainly none from the 
prime minister.

I think the prime minister fully supports, and the government fully supports, 
the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take 
those decisions.”

And he also indicated he accepted criticism from MPs, as part of the Bank’s 
accountability. He wouldn’t say whethersome critics should take a vow of silence
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-581b3546e4b07ceadb3a208e#block-581b3546e4b07ceadb3a208e>
, alas.
 
A final question.... is there an inflation level that would force the Bank to 
take action?

Carney won’t be lured into setting a figure -- perhaps burned by his previous 
experience of forward guidance.

It all depends what is causing prices to rise over target, and what the best 
response is.
Katie Allen (@KatieAllenGdn) 
Carney: Won't give a numerical limit we will tolerate on inflation. Any limit 
is a product of what's causing inflation overshoot.

Carney is then asked whether Theresa May’s recent criticism of the Bank’s 
monetary policy, at the Tory party conference, has undermined him.

Q: Does he feel any political pressure to change the bank’s forecasts?

Not at all, he replies.

We don’t feel under any pressure from the government, and especially not from 
the prime minister.

The prime minister, and the government, fully support the monetary policy 
framework we have in place.
 
Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail tries to get some new forward guidance out of 
the governor.

Q: Can you tell us whether the next move in interest rates is more likely to 
be up, or down?

You can see scenarios where it goes either way, we don’t have a bias, Mark 
Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> replies.

But the monetary policy committee currently unanimously believes that the 
present stance is right.
