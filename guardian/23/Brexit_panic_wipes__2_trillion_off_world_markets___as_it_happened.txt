Closing summary: Brexit wipes $2 trillion (!!) off global markets

It’s almost 24 hours since it first became clear that David Cameron’s EU 
referendum had not gone as the PM had planned.

That realisation has triggered one of the most dramatic, volatile and 
downright scary trading sessions in the last decade. New estimates tonight say 
Brexit has wiped out over two trillion dollars of value, worldwide:

So, as City traders hit the pillow (or in some cases the gin bottle), we 
should also wrap up.

Here’s a very brisk summary of the state of play.

The British pound has suffered its biggest one-day selloff in recent history, 
as the shock news the the UK is heading out of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> sparked panic in the markets.

Sterling suffered a jaw-dropping plunge in the early hours of Friday in 
London, from $1.50 against the US dollar to just $1.33. It closed at $1.368, 
aftera day to forget for many FX traders

The London stock market suffered steep losses at the open, but recovered to 
finish down 199 points or minus 3.1%. Bank stocks suffered badly, while some 
housebuilders shed a quarter of their value amid forecasts of a UK recession.

The morning stopped being dramatic, and was upgraded to historic, at 8.15am 
London time when the prime minister resigned,

And that left central bankers (once again) to pick up the pieces. The Bank of 
England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have all promised to
flood market with new liquidity, if needed

But that wasn’t enough to stop France’s CAC sliding by 8%, or Wall Street 
suffering its biggest one-day fall in 10 months.

Asia had already tumbled while results from across the UK had flooded in, with 
Japan’s Nikkei index experiencing its biggest fall since the Fukushima disaster 
of 2011.

And then Moody’s fired a warning shot at Britain, cutting its rating outlook 
to negative due to the economic problems caused by Brexi

Britain also faces a political crisis tonight, of course, plus pressure from 
Europe to actually start the exit process..

Saturday is going to be another dramatic day in the UK. Ditto Sunday. And then 
the markets reopen on Monday morning....

So until then, a very good night!

The record 8%-ish slump in the pound on Friday has raised fears that UK 
inflation could spike (as imports will cost more).

That would be bad news for poorer citizens, says the IPPR thinktank tonight.

 Using Treasury modelling of currency shocks, IPPR finds that a 2.3 percent 
increase in CPI will increase costs for the poorest households by 3.3 per cent, 
compared to a 1.6 per cent increase for the richest 10 percent of families.

This chart shows how those with less money suffer more from rising living 
costs:

It’s 15 short (?!) hours since London’s stock markets opened, in a massive 
wave of selling that briefly wiped 550 points off the FTSE 100.

Our Jill Treanor and Simon Goodley were watching events unfold in the City, 
while we stared open-mouthed at our Reuters terminals in the news room.

Here’s their report on the action:

And here’s a flavour of a truly wild day...

On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in 
a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares 
when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but 
facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account.

Another told his dealer it was the end of the world.

By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG’s chief market analyst, was worrying about the 
effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his 
job until the afternoon.

“Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and 
if Cameron is still there,” he said. “If he says he’s going it will be sold off 
again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish 
elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose 
two would be careless.”

Moody’s also warns that Britain’s trade with the rest of the world is probably 
going to suffer.

That’s another reason for downgrading the UK’s outlook to negative tonight.

Moody’s says:

Moody’s expects a negative impact on the economy unless the UK government 
manages to negotiate a trade deal that largely replicates its current access to 
the Single Market.

However, at the moment there is substantial uncertainty over the type of trade 
agreement that could be achieved.

Moody's cuts outlook on UK debt to negative

Breaking news: Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has just lowered the outlook 
on Britain’s credit rating to negative from stable.

It says that Britain’s economic growth will be weaker, following the EU 
referendum vote. It also warns the the public finances will be weaker than 
previously forecast, meaning it will be harder to cut the deficit.

Moody’s says that the Brexit vote will herald a “prolonged period of 
uncertainty” for the UK, with negative implications for growth in the medium 
terms.

And it also warns that the effectiveness of economic policymaking could be 
‘somewhat diminished’ by the decision.

A negative outlook means there is a greater danger of a country being 
downgraded.

It’s three years since Moody’s cut Britain’s AAA rating. It currently has the 
UK on AA+, the second highest rating.

The morning stopped being dramatic, and was upgraded to historic, at 8.15am 
London time when the prime minister resigned,

And that left central bankers (once again) to pick up the pieces. The Bank of 
England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have all promised to
flood market with new liquidity, if needed

But that wasn’t enough to stop France’s CAC sliding by 8%, or Wall Street 
suffering its biggest one-day fall in 10 months.

Asia had already tumbled while results from across the UK had flooded in, with 
Japan’s Nikkei index experiencing its biggest fall since the Fukushima disaster 
of 2011.

And then Moody’s fired a warning shot at Britain, cutting its rating outlook 
to negative due to the economic problems caused by Brexi

Britain also faces a political crisis tonight, of course, plus pressure from 
Europe to actually start the exit process..

Saturday is going to be another dramatic day in the UK. Ditto Sunday. And then 
the markets reopen on Monday morning....

So until then, a very good night!

The record 8%-ish slump in the pound on Friday has raised fears that UK 
inflation could spike (as imports will cost more).

That would be bad news for poorer citizens, says the IPPR thinktank tonight.

 Using Treasury modelling of currency shocks, IPPR finds that a 2.3 percent 
increase in CPI will increase costs for the poorest households by 3.3 per cent, 
compared to a 1.6 per cent increase for the richest 10 percent of families.

This chart shows how those with less money suffer more from rising living 
costs:

It’s 15 short (?!) hours since London’s stock markets opened, in a massive 
wave of selling that briefly wiped 550 points off the FTSE 100.

Our Jill Treanor and Simon Goodley were watching events unfold in the City, 
while we stared open-mouthed at our Reuters terminals in the news room.

Here’s their report on the action:

A rollercoaster ride for City traders on EU referendum night

And here’s a flavour of a truly wild day...

On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in 
a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares 
when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but 
facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account.

Another told his dealer it was the end of the world.

By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG’s chief market analyst, was worrying about the 
effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his 
job until the afternoon.

“Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and 
if Cameron is still there,” he said. “If he says he’s going it will be sold off 
again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish 
elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose 
two would be careless.”
 
Germany’s Bild says Britain’s decision is a Black day for Europe:

Bild had made a last-ditch attempt to sway UK voters, promising to reserve sun 
loungers for Brits, and even recognise Geoff Hurst’s ‘on-the-line’ goal at the 
1966 World Cup. To no avail.

(anyway, it was definitely a goal, the Russian linesman said so

Moody’s also warns that Britain’s trade with the rest of the world is probably 
going to suffer.

That’s another reason for downgrading the UK’s outlook to negative tonight.

Moody’s says:

Moody’s expects a negative impact on the economy unless the UK government 
manages to negotiate a trade deal that largely replicates its current access to 
the Single Market.

However, at the moment there is substantial uncertainty over the type of trade 
agreement that could be achieved.
 
Breaking news: Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has just lowered the outlook 
on Britain’s credit rating to negative from stable.

It says that Britain’s economic growth will be weaker, following the EU 
referendum vote. It also warns the the public finances will be weaker than 
previously forecast, meaning it will be harder to cut the deficit.

Moody’s says that the Brexit vote will herald a “prolonged period of 
uncertainty” for the UK, with negative implications for growth in the medium 
terms.

And it also warns that the effectiveness of economic policymaking could be 
‘somewhat diminished’ by the decision.

A negative outlook means there is a greater danger of a country being 
downgraded.

It’s three years since Moody’s cut Britain’s AAA rating. It currently has the 
UK on AA+, the second highest rating.

This morning Standard & Poor’s, the only firm that Britain still on triple-A, 
warned that it is likely to downgrade Britain.
