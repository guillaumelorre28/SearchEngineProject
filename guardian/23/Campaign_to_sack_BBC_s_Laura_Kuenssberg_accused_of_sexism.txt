A campaign to sack BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/22/laura-kuenssberg-confirmed-as-new-bbc-political-editor>
 over her coverage of Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of misogyny and sexism.

More than 35,000 people have signed a petition posted on campaigning website 
38 Degrees <https://home.38degrees.org.uk/> claiming Kuenssberg is biased 
against Labour, most recently in her coverage of last week’s local and regional 
elections.

However, many of the comments by those sharing the petition on Twitter have 
used offensive and sexist language, with further abuse in more private Facebook 
postings.

Former Independent on Sunday political editor Jane Merrick said Kuenssberg’s 
questioning of what the results meant for Corbyn was justified and the petition 
was ridiculous, but that the BBC’s first female political editor faced an extra 
layer of sexist criticism. “She has been called a whore and a bitch on 
Twitter,” said Merrick. “Nick Robinson used to be accused of Tory bias but he 
never experienced this level of nastiness.

“Of course, not all Corbyn supporters are sexist, far from it, but there is a 
core of hard-left misogyny that comes out against women when Corbyn is under 
pressure – such as the abuse against Stella Creasy and Jess Phillips.Jeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> said back in 
September he wanted a ‘kinder politics’ so he should condemn these vile attacks 
against a respected and experienced journalist.”

On Sunday, Labour MP Phillips tweeted: 
Jess Phillips MP (@jessphillips) 
I have to say, I think attack on @bbclaurak <https://twitter.com/bbclaurak> is 
underlined with institutional sexism by people who dont even know they are 
perpetrators

It is the second time Kuenssberg has been targeted by campaigners. Earlier 
this year another petition called forboth her and Andrew Neil to be sacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/08/bbc-stephen-doughty-daily-politics-laura-kuenssberg>
 over the on-air resignation of Stephen Doughty.

The National Union of Journalists reiterated its position that calls for 
journalists to be sacked for their reporting were farcical.

“This was a legitimate story any journalist would have wanted to run on their 
show ... You cannot run witch hunts against journalists just because you don’t 
like the news they report. In the same way we supported journalists – at theBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> and elsewhere – who were attacked on 
social media by people from both sides of the argument on independence during 
the Scottish referendum, we will not tolerate people who try to suppress 
legitimate news coverage.”

The author of the petition, who originally set it up following what he 
described as a “tirade” against Corbyn by Kuenssberg in January, said the 
petition was not about her gender.

“I have been accused of sexist trolling on Twitter,” he wrote in the updated 
post. “I would like to reassure everyone that I am a passionate advocate for 
equality in all areas, not just gender equality.


“This petition has precisely zero to do with Kuenssberg’s gender. Regardless 
of the gender you identify with, there is no excuse for biased reporting and 
misrepresentation of facts when you represent an organisation that has been 
famed for its impartiality and balanced approach.”
