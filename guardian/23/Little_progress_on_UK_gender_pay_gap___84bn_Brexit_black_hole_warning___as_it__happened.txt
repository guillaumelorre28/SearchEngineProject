The revival in the oil price has proved short lived, as doubts over producers 
agreeing to curb output at next month’s Opec meeting began to outweigh the news 
of a surprise drop in US crude stocks.

So Brent crude is currently down 1.3% at $50.13 a barrel while West Texas 
Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $49.47.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets rebound from worst levels

A fall in commodity shares along with the usual concerns about Brexit and the 
US election, along with some disappointing results from the likes of Apple, 
have left most European markets nursing losses. However a revival in the oil 
price after a surprise drop in US crude stocks saw Wall Street reverse earlier 
falls and drag European shares off their worst levels. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 59.55 points or 0.85% at 6958.09 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.44% to 10,709.68 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.14% lower at 4534.59 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.29% to 17,280.74 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.37% at 9173.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.09% to 589.46 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 53 points or 
0.29%.

4.23pm BST 16:23  <> 

With Wall Street turning positive in the wake of the oil price recovery, 
European markets are coming off their worst levels, albeit still down on the 
day. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:


US markets continue to dictate the tone, as disappointing numbers from Apple 
weigh on sentiment, while investors keep a nervous eye on falling oil prices. 
While scepticism around the OPEC deal was palpable, no one really expected it 
to unravel this quickly, but a procession of nations bearing their own ‘sick 
notes’ as to why they couldn’t possibly be expected to participate has shown 
that the unanimity on display recently was simply a front. In addition, 
sentiment has been hit by news that the Trump campaign for president may not be 
quite as DOA as previously thought. When combined with the disappointing 
numbers from Apple, it is clear to see why markets remain under pressure.

At least oil prices have stabilised, with the weekly crude inventories 
providing their usual burst of volatility. The drop in stockpiles might provide 
some temporary relief, but overall if the OPEC deal continues to unravel then 
we could see the lows tested in short order.

Oil prices have recovered some ground from earlier falls after a surprise fall 
in US crude stocks.

Crude inventories dropped by 553,000m barrels last week to 468.16m, compared 
to expectations of a 4m barrel rise, according to the Energy Information 
Administration.

So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $49.65 a barrel on concerns that 
producers will not agree to curb output at next month’s meeting, is now at 
$50.63, down 0.32%.

West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.12% to $50.02 a barrel.

The European Central Bank is likely to extend its QE programme beyond the 
current March end date,according to Reuters 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy-idUKKCN12Q1TX>:

The European Central Bank is nearly certain to continue buying bonds beyond 
its March target and to relax its constraints on the purchases to ensure it 
finds enough paper to buy, central bank sources have told Reuters.

The moves will come in an attempt to bolster what is being heralded as the 
start of an economic recovery in the euro zone.

ECB policymakers are due to decide in December on the future shape and 
duration of their 80 billion euros (£71.58 billion) monthly quantitative easing 
(QE) scheme, based on new growth and inflation forecasts.

They did not discuss specific options at last week’s meeting and no policy 
proposal has been formulated. But sources familiar with the matter said it was 
all but sure that money printing would continue in some form beyond March, 
currently the ECB’s earliest end-date.

US new home sales have come in slightly better than expected, although there 
is some confusion in the figures.

They rose to 593,000 units in September, up 3.1% from the August figure of 
575,000, which was itself revised down from 609,000. This was lower than the 
600,000 expected but given the revision, the rise itself was better than the 
forecast 1.5% fall.

US service sector better than expected

The US service sector grew more strongly than forecast in October, according 
to a report.

The initial Markit US services PMI for this month came in at 54.8, up from the 
52.3 expected and 52.3 in September.

Markit’s composite PMI, which includes services and manufacturing, rose from 
52.3 in September to 54.9, the highest level since November 2015.

Markit said the surveys suggested that the US economy was growing at an 
annualised rate of 2% at the start of the fourth quarter. Tim Moore, a senior 
economist at IHS Markit, said:

The latest survey data reveal a decisive shift in growth momentum across the 
US service sector, which mirrors the more robust manufacturing performance seen 
during October.

Service providers experienced the fastest upturn in new business volumes since 
late 2015, which survey respondents linked to improving domestic economic 
conditions and signs of greater business investment in particular. That said, 
job creation remained relatively subdued in October, with firms reporting 
cautious hiring plans and efforts to alleviate pressures on margins.

October’s survey findings contained positive signs for near-term growth 
prospects, with service sector companies the most upbeat about the business 
outlook since August 2015. Moreover, the month-to-month rise in this index was 
one of the largest seen over the past two years.

PwC: How to fix gender pay problems

Laura Hinton, the head of people at PwC, argues that bosses must proactively 
do more to address the gender pay gap. She says:

It’s encouraging to see the gender pay gap reducing, but the underlying 
reasons for the gap remain the same. Women are still more likely to work part 
time, have lower-paid jobs and leave the workforce after having children. Until 
we tackle these underlying causes, it will be hard to reach true equality in 
the workplace.

In February, the government outlined plans to force large companies to reveal 
how much they pay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/12/gender-pay-gap-reporting-big-firms-start-2018>
 their male and female staff, starting in 2018.

Hinton says this has already worked at her company:

At PwC, publishing our gender pay gap has allowed us to understand the reasons 
for the gap and helps hold ourselves accountable to make practical changes. For 
example, we know that when senior women leave us, they are more likely to be 
replaced by a male.

We are challenging ourselves on this by testing our recruitment processes, 
making more senior jobs available as flexible or part time and targeting women 
who have been out of the workplace for a number of years via our return to work 
programme.

The Resolution Foundation is playing a blinder today, and has created some 
more charts to show what’s happening in Britain’s labour market.

This chart shows how the “national living wage” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means>
 has driven up earnings for customer service jobs above their pre-crisis level. 
Elementary occupations (unskilled jobs) are close behind.
ResolutionFoundation (@resfoundation) 
Large, NLW-related pay increase in sales and customer service occupations 
means typical pay for these roles has surpassed pre-downturn peak

I was surprised by this chart, which shows that wages in London are the 
furthest from pre-crisis levels.

And rising inflation is going to drive down real wages this year.

But still a long way to go, & prospects for lower pay growth & higher 
inflation mean this year’s growth unlikely to be repeated soon

It’s not been a great morning in the City.

The FTSE 100 has shed 68 points, nearly 1%, to 6,949. Mining stocks continue 
to struggle after copper company Antofagasta cut its production targets this 
morning.

The FTSE is also catching up with last night’s rally in the pound back to 
$1.22, which came after the London stock market closed. A stronger pound is bad 
for international companies that earn dollars.

Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, says the pound could spike ... if a 
legal challenge to Brexit is successful.

The continuing legal hearing against the government’s decision to view the 
referendum result as binding seems like the event risk no one is talking about.

Should the legal challenge succeed, it would push the decision to a vote in 
parliament, bringing about a sharp appreciation in the pound and subsequent 
weakness for the FTSE.

The oil price is also under pressure, with Brent crude dropping through the 
$50 a barrel mark for the first time in three weeks.

The revival in the oil price has proved short lived, as doubts over producers 
agreeing to curb output at next month’s Opec meeting began to outweigh the news 
of a surprise drop in US crude stocks.

So Brent crude is currently down 1.3% at $50.13 a barrel while West Texas 
Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $49.47.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
A fall in commodity shares along with the usual concerns about Brexit and the 
US election, along with some disappointing results from the likes of Apple, 
have left most European markets nursing losses. However a revival in the oil 
price after a surprise drop in US crude stocks saw Wall Street reverse earlier 
falls and drag European shares off their worst levels. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 59.55 points or 0.85% at 6958.09 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.44% to 10,709.68 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.14% lower at 4534.59 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.29% to 17,280.74 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.37% at 9173.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.09% to 589.46 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 53 points or 
0.29%.
 
With Wall Street turning positive in the wake of the oil price recovery, 
European markets are coming off their worst levels, albeit still down on the 
day. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:


US markets continue to dictate the tone, as disappointing numbers from Apple 
weigh on sentiment, while investors keep a nervous eye on falling oil prices. 
While scepticism around the OPEC deal was palpable, no one really expected it 
to unravel this quickly, but a procession of nations bearing their own ‘sick 
notes’ as to why they couldn’t possibly be expected to participate has shown 
that the unanimity on display recently was simply a front. In addition, 
sentiment has been hit by news that the Trump campaign for president may not be 
quite as DOA as previously thought. When combined with the disappointing 
numbers from Apple, it is clear to see why markets remain under pressure.

At least oil prices have stabilised, with the weekly crude inventories 
providing their usual burst of volatility. The drop in stockpiles might provide 
some temporary relief, but overall if the OPEC deal continues to unravel then 
we could see the lows tested in short order.
 
Oil prices have recovered some ground from earlier falls after a surprise fall 
in US crude stocks.

Crude inventories dropped by 553,000m barrels last week to 468.16m, compared 
to expectations of a 4m barrel rise, according to the Energy Information 
Administration.

So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $49.65 a barrel on concerns that 
producers will not agree to curb output at next month’s meeting, is now at 
$50.63, down 0.32%.

West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.12% to $50.02 a barrel.

The European Central Bank is likely to extend its QE programme beyond the 
current March end date,according to Reuters 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy-idUKKCN12Q1TX>:

The European Central Bank is nearly certain to continue buying bonds beyond 
its March target and to relax its constraints on the purchases to ensure it 
finds enough paper to buy, central bank sources have told Reuters.

The moves will come in an attempt to bolster what is being heralded as the 
start of an economic recovery in the euro zone.

ECB policymakers are due to decide in December on the future shape and 
duration of their 80 billion euros (£71.58 billion) monthly quantitative easing 
(QE) scheme, based on new growth and inflation forecasts.

They did not discuss specific options at last week’s meeting and no policy 
proposal has been formulated. But sources familiar with the matter said it was 
all but sure that money printing would continue in some form beyond March, 
currently the ECB’s earliest end-date.

US new home sales have come in slightly better than expected, although there 
is some confusion in the figures.

They rose to 593,000 units in September, up 3.1% from the August figure of 
575,000, which was itself revised down from 609,000. This was lower than the 
600,000 expected but given the revision, the rise itself was better than the 
forecast 1.5% fall.

The US service sector grew more strongly than forecast in October, according 
to a report.

The initial Markit US services PMI for this month came in at 54.8, up from the 
52.3 expected and 52.3 in September.

Markit’s composite PMI, which includes services and manufacturing, rose from 
52.3 in September to 54.9, the highest level since November 2015.

Markit said the surveys suggested that the US economy was growing at an 
annualised rate of 2% at the start of the fourth quarter. Tim Moore, a senior 
economist at IHS Markit, said:

The latest survey data reveal a decisive shift in growth momentum across the 
US service sector, which mirrors the more robust manufacturing performance seen 
during October.

Service providers experienced the fastest upturn in new business volumes since 
late 2015, which survey respondents linked to improving domestic economic 
conditions and signs of greater business investment in particular. That said, 
job creation remained relatively subdued in October, with firms reporting 
cautious hiring plans and efforts to alleviate pressures on margins.

October’s survey findings contained positive signs for near-term growth 
prospects, with service sector companies the most upbeat about the business 
outlook since August 2015. Moreover, the month-to-month rise in this index was 
one of the largest seen over the past two years.
 
The fall on Wall Street has helped push European markets lower, with the FTSE 
100 dropping by 91 points (1.3%). Germany’s Dax is down 0.97% and France’s Cac 
has fallen 0.6%.
 
The US stock market is dropping at the start of trading, following the UK’s 
lead.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed 90 points, or 0.5%. Energy companies 
have slipped after the oil price hit a three-week low today.

And Apple has fallen more than 3% after it posted falling sales and profits

Laura Hinton, the head of people at PwC, argues that bosses must proactively 
do more to address the gender pay gap. She says:

It’s encouraging to see the gender pay gap reducing, but the underlying 
reasons for the gap remain the same. Women are still more likely to work part 
time, have lower-paid jobs and leave the workforce after having children. Until 
we tackle these underlying causes, it will be hard to reach true equality in 
the workplace.

In February, the government outlined plans to force large companies to reveal 
how much they pay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/12/gender-pay-gap-reporting-big-firms-start-2018>
 their male and female staff, starting in 2018.

Hinton says this has already worked at her company:

At PwC, publishing our gender pay gap has allowed us to understand the reasons 
for the gap and helps hold ourselves accountable to make practical changes. For 
example, we know that when senior women leave us, they are more likely to be 
replaced by a male.

We are challenging ourselves on this by testing our recruitment processes, 
making more senior jobs available as flexible or part time and targeting women 
who have been out of the workplace for a number of years via our return to work 
programme.

<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means>
 has driven up earnings for customer service jobs above their pre-crisis level. 
Elementary occupations (unskilled jobs) are close behind.

Large, NLW-related pay increase in sales and customer service occupations 
means typical pay for these roles has surpassed pre-downturn peak

I was surprised by this chart, which shows that wages in London are the 
furthest from pre-crisis levels.

And rising inflation is going to drive down real wages this year.

But still a long way to go, & prospects for lower pay growth & higher 
inflation mean this year’s growth unlikely to be repeated soon

It’s not been a great morning in the City.

The FTSE 100 has shed 68 points, nearly 1%, to 6,949. Mining stocks continue 
to struggle after copper company Antofagasta cut its production targets this 
morning.

The FTSE is also catching up with last night’s rally in the pound back to 
$1.22, which came after the London stock market closed. A stronger pound is bad 
for international companies that earn dollars.

Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, says the pound could spike ... if a 
legal challenge to Brexit is successful.

The continuing legal hearing against the government’s decision to view the 
referendum result as binding seems like the event risk no one is talking about.

Should the legal challenge succeed, it would push the decision to a vote in 
parliament, bringing about a sharp appreciation in the pound and subsequent 
weakness for the FTSE.

The oil price is also under pressure, with Brent crude dropping through the 
$50 a barrel mark for the first time in three weeks.
