CLEMENTINE

1 G. H. Willett (Wimbledon): Eminent Liberal calling for reform in Church?

with us (anag. less us; ref. the late Sir Jeremy Morse).

one (l in cement + in e; ref. C. Churchill, Pooh-sticks).

VHC

round lawn’s border (l in cement + (f)ine; ref. 6th verse of song: ‘Grow the

Comments

164 entries, no mistakes, except of course for my carelessly faulty anagram of 
NERITIC. (‘Daft cretin, I’ just about sums it up, as well as Mr Arnott’s neatly 
apposite clue above.) A tough puzzle, clearly, prompting comments such as 
‘possibly the toughest ever’ and ‘nearly gave up’. Really? Puzzles with 
clashing letters seem to be becoming increasingly popular these days, and this 
element certainly adds to their difficulty, which is why I made sure that no 
word in the grid was thus affected more than once. It was the eighth ‘Cherchez 
la Femme’ I’ve given you, with minor variations (the first being No. 1,136), 
and only the second as a competition puzzle, since few female names are 
anything more than just that, thus limiting cluing possibilities. (One 
competitor said he’d been uncertain whether I required a clue to CLEMENTINE as 
a name only, ignoring the other senses. Absolutely not – they were the reason I 
chose it.) Favourite clue, of 20 nominated at least once (the clue for NERITIC 
receiving one vote!), was ‘After parking composer I dropped in for a whipped 
café “special”’ for FRAPPUCCINO.


The recent death of Sir Jeremy Morse at 87 has robbed the crossword world of a 
true giant, whose brilliance and enthusiasm dominated this series and that of 
Ximenes before it for decades (an astonishing 68 years and 3 months, to be 
exact). His first prizewinning clue (a PD) was in March 1950 (Ximenes No. 128). 
His lifetime scores in X and AZ competitions, occasionally in partnership with 
his son Richard, were: 650 honours points, 38 first prizes, 63 second or third 
prizes, 448 VHC and HC clues (plus 282 HC/runner-up clues). He appeared in 66 
honours lists between 1951 and 2015, occupying first place in 16 of them. His 
favourite of his own clues was his first prizewinner for BEDSTEAD in Ximenes 
No. 634: ‘To lie still is not enough here; both sides of the sheet must be 
tucked in’, but he was also rightly proud of his clue to BODY-SNATCHER for AZ 
No. 482: ‘Stiff collaring: that’s my trade – shows what can be done by starch’. 
I am grateful to John Tozer for assembling these amazing statistics. Full 
details of CJM’s crossword career can be followed on John’s andlit.org website. 
See specially Slip for No. 1,906, a puzzle I set to mark Jeremy’s 80th 
birthday. As well as admiring his incomparable skill at constructing witty and 
clever clues I shall, like so many others, miss him greatly as a friend.
