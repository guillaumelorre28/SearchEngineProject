 is facing a vote of no confidence by the ruling party’s executive committee, 
media reported on Monday.

The ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) extended its scheduled meeting 
into a third day on Monday, after Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom proposed the 
motion of no-confidence on Saturday, said Beeld, an Afrikaans-language daily.

Committee members were locked in a “fiery and fierce” debate over whether a 
secret ballot should be used to decide the no-confidence motion, it added, 
citing unnamed sources who had attended the meeting.

The ruling party’s spokesman did not respond to a telephone call to seek 
comment. In a statement on Sunday, the ANC did not give a reason for the 
extension of the meeting. The committee, which is meeting in the capital, 
Pretoria, is the only body in the ruling party that can remove the leader of 
the party, besides its 5-yearly congress.
