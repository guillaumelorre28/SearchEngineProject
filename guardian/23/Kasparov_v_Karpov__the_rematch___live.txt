5.24pm: 
In 1984, Kasparov and Karpov began a chess match 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2009/sep/21/kasparov-karpov-chess-rematch> 
that would last five months without actually producing a clear winner. But 
don't worry:tonight's 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/21/karpov-kasparov-chess-rematch-valencia>
 contest is a timed affair, so February is safe.
The two grandmasters go head to head 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/gallery/2009/sep/21/chess-kasparov-karpov-rematch-valencia>
 from 6pm. Follow all the thrills and spills here, with contributions from, 
among others, the British chess grandmaster and co-author (with Garry Kasparov) 
of the book Kasparov Against the World,Dan King 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-king>.
Emails to adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk <mailto:adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk> 
will be gratefully received.

5.40pm: 
The match starts at 6pm, and you can watch the developments <http://www.gva.es>
 online.
Over four days Kasparov and Karpov will play 12 matches of two different types 
of speed chess, starting tonight with two "semi-rapid" games.
Dan King, who knows rather more about this than I do, explains how it'll work:

Both players will be given 25 minutes at the start of the game - if they run 
out of time they will lose, no matter what is happening on the board. But after 
each move an additional 5 seconds will be added. It means that a player can 
still hope to win a game even if they run very short of time as with each move 
they gain a little bit on the clock.

5.48pm: 
From the rather grainy, and completely soundless video 
<http://www.gva.es/ajedrez/ei_ajedrez_en.htm> on the Generalitat Valenciana 
site, we can see that the table is set.
Kasparov's just been out, briefly, swishing theatrically towards the table 
through a curtain at stage-right.
He sat on his seat, didn't seem happy with a black cushion that was on it, and 
promptly exited.

5.57pm: 
The questions are coming thick and fast...
"How do they decide who is black and who is white?" asks Penny.
Dan King knows these things, and informs me that it is through a process of 
chance, sometimes the simple tossing of a coin, but on other occasions a more 
complex system of drawing a card from a pack.
We still await the arrival of our chess-titans.

 

6.01pm: 
Looking through the image gallery of previous Kasparov v Karpov encounters 
reminds me rather a lot of the Big Train staring sketch.
Possible inspiration? I wish there was the same sort of commentary on the 
official chess site.

close 
 6.18pm: 
And they're off. The official site, which never looked particularly robust, 
has immediately crashed for me.
But here's footage of the press conference 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2009/sep/22/chess-karpov-kasparov>.

6.20pm: 
Dan saves the day, here's what's gone on so far:

We have the first moves....1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 g3 Bg7 4 Bg2 d5 5 cxd5 Nxd5 6 e4 
Nb6 7 Ne2 c5 8 d5 0-0 9 0-0 e6 10 Nc3 Na6 11 h3...it's a very sharp 
position...Karpov has claimed the centre with his pawns, Kasparov is 
counter-attacking with pieces. It's just like the old days!

6.22pm: 
The live board <http://www.gva.es/ajedrez/ei_ajedrez_en.htm> is still working 
on the official site. It's just the video that's gone.
Karpov white, Kasparov black for this first match. 
Karpov has used up nearly 3 minutes more time than the (younger) pretender so 
far. Dan's unimpressed:

Karpov is pondering over how to recapture the pawn...but he is wasting a lot 
of time. This is meant to be speed chess!

6.27pm: 
Karpov still dithering. He's used 7 minutes more than Kasparov now. Currently 
spent 4 minutes pondering.

6.29pm: 
Dan's back:

We have some more moves: 11..exd5 12 exd5 Nc4 13 b3 Nd6 14 Bf4 b6 15 Qd2 Bb7.

Kasparov is playing fluently and quickly, Karpov more hesitantly, but the 
position remains finely balanced...

6.31pm: 

16 Rd1 Nc7...Kasparov has blockaded Karpov's advanced pawn, Karpov will look 
to destroy that blockade and advance, or create pressure against Black's king.


If Karpov were an animal, he'd be a snail. He only has 10 minutes left on the 
clock. Kasparov has 20 left.

6.33pm: 
Dan reckons the time difference could be decisive. Kasparov looking sharper at 
the moment.
He's been training in Norway against 18-year-old "chess prodigy" Magnus 
Carlsen. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen>

6.37pm:

This game is following the pattern of many of their previous encounters - 
Karpov consumes too much time, but often fights back under pressure. Will he do 
so here? Kasparov often gets too worked up and plays hot-headedly...Another 
move 17 g4 from Karpov.


Says our man Dan. 
Can Kasparov keep a cool head? He's 12 years younger, which he said beforehand 
would be an advantage, but will his political interests have numbed his killer 
instinct?

6.40pm: 

This is an excellent move, creating a nice square for the knight to come to g3 
and then maybe to e4. Karpov is brewing a nice kingside and central attack.

6.40pm: 
Kasparov now taking his time:

How much time the players consume is usually a good barometer of how they feel 
about the position, so Garry clearly believes that Anatoly's attack is serious 
enough...

6.41pm: 

17...Qd7 from Kasparov. That enables his queen's rook to enter the game. I 
wonder how he is going to deal with Ng3...?

6.42pm: 
Karpov's equal to it, replying instantly with 18 a4, preventing Black's knight 
from moving to b5.

This is typical Karpov, constricting his opponent before launching his attack.

6.45pm: 
The times are evening up to, A.K. on 8 minutes, G.K. down to 11 now.
Chess ok <http://www.chessok.com/broadcast/?key=KK1.pgn&game=0> showing the 
match too, with an interesting discussion going on below.

6.47pm: 
To quote Alan Partridge, albeit in a completely different context, "It's all 
happening."
Dan's excited:

18...f5 from Kasparov...WOW...he is attempting to blow up Karpov's king 
position...but Karpov manages to keep the position closed by advancing his pawn 
... 19 g5 and Kasparov replies 19...Rd8.

6.48pm: 
And G.K. might be in trouble. We heard he was hot-headed, and he's dived in:
Garry's last move was highly committal. He attempoted to open Karpov's king, 
but he might have only succeeded in weakening his own king position.

6.48pm: 
AK's got a sniff, and looks like GK could be in trouble:

20 Bg3 from Karpov. An excellent move, preparing to play his knight into f4 
and perhaps later into e6.
I think Kasparov will be regretting his move 18...f5 - it weakens his central 
squares. Very hot-headed.


He's a fiesty one, our Garry.

6.51pm:

20...f4 from Kasparov - a dynamic pawn sacrifice, freeing a square for his 
pieces, but I think also a sign that GK was not happy with his position.


AK's down to 3 minutes on the clock, Garry still on 9.

6.53pm: 
Dan thinks AK (wouldn't it be good if he was 47 years old?) has the better 
position, if he can handle the time pressure.
The discussion continues on Chess <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chess> OK 
as to whether or not pizza "is gay".

6.55pm: 
Here's Dan King:

21 Nxf4 from karpov...he has an extra pawn.
But as compensation Kasparov has found a good square for his knight on f5 - 
that could menace Karpov's king. Very tense.

6.56pm: 

22 Nb5. Great move from Karpov. He is looking to establish a knight in the 
heart of GK's position.

6.57pm: 
22...Nxb5 23 axb5 Nd4 - the pieces are flying, but wait:

24 Ne6 from Karpov he has thrown his knight into the heart of Garry's 
position..but this could be a blunder..

6.59pm: 
KASPAROV WINS!

7.01pm: 
Karpov runs out of time and loses, but by this stage it looked like he had 
blundered.
Kasparov still had 8 minutes left, but had looked shaky...

7.02pm: 

The younger man was just too fast for him, and, in the end, in spite of having 
a promising position, he couldn't work through the complexity. Good strategy 
from Kasparov: he played for a complicated position from the outset, and for a 
while Karpov played well, but then he cracked.


Says Dan. Still one more match to come tonight, in 10 minutes. Technical 
problems should be ironed out for the start too.
Cup of tea time.

7.14pm: 
Twitter, the lazy journalist's favourite, is all-a-flutter with chess. 
Well there's been a few posts. 
"Kasparov beats Karpov handily! Go Garry!" gushes @checkandmate.
@gbro isn't convinced Valencia, which is the third largest city in Spain, with 
a population of 810,064 in 2008 (Wikipedia), has quite taken to the action: 
"Valencia is apparently bored shitless by the Kasparov-Karpov rematch"

 

7.21pm: 
Kasparov, of course, was the first reigning World Champion to lose a chess 
match to a computer, called 'Deep Blue', in 1997.
Here he is after he lost. Not happy.

close 
 7.28pm: 
Here's our man Giles Tremlett, who's in Valencia:

Pre-match nerves had already seen both chess masters complain about the 
playing conditions ahead of yesterday's much-awaited rematch.
"They moaned about the lighting but they are playing in the lecture theatre 
not the main hall, so there is not a lot we can do about that," said one 
organiser at the Palau de les Arts opera house in Valencia, eastern Spain.
"I guess they are just like any other divas."

7.30pm: 
We're off in the second game, and Dan "the King" King is back:

Kasparov has the white pieces in the next game - that's roughly the equivalent 
of having the serve in tennis. You can attempt to dictate the course of events 
at the very least. I predict that Garry will follow the same tactics - he'll 
aim for complications and attempt to blow Old Man Anatoly off the board.

7.35pm: 

1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Be7 4 cxd5 exd5 5 Bf4 c6. A Queen's Gambit Declined. An 
opening they have played against each other before. They know it backwards.

7.37pm: 

6...Bd6 7 Bxd6 Qxd6 8 e3 Ne7 9 Bd3 Nd7. 

Bishops have been traded, and that eases Karpov's piece congestion.

7.38pm: 
Both players following a well-trodden path according to Dan:

10 Nge2 from Kasparov. This is a fairly well known position. the pawn 
structures are fixed and that leads to tense piece manoeuvring. Both players 
have shown themselves to be adept in this kind of position. Generally the 
position only really explodes around move 30...expect stodgy manoeuvring for 
the next 15-20 moves.

In the meantime, US chess champ Hikaru Nakamura isn't happy. Here's his post 
on theInternet Chess Club <http://www.chessclub.com/>:

"I just don't understand why you would want to get killed over and over again 
... Kaspy gonna win +5 at least ...
He is getting payback for 2003."

7.41pm: 
AK47 (Karpov) opens fire on G.K. Rowling (Kasparov).

10...h6 from Karpov. He would like to castle kingside but he needs to move 
that pawn first - otherwise Kasparov would take with the bishop.

Both players similar for time – Karpov obviously learning, if that can be said 
without outrageously patronising a chess grandmaster, from running out of time 
in the first match.

7.42pm: 
Sensible stuff so far from the Russians:

11 0-0 0-0 - both sides castle. They're bringing their kings out of the middle 
and into safety behind the pawns.

7.44pm: 
No news from Chess OK as to the sexual preference of pizza. 
Lots of Spanish tweets on the chess, but unfortunately I don't speak Spanish. 
Just a small amount of "Lancastrian French".
Here's one though, from @hemisterio. Hope it's not rude:

krpov VS kasparov, llevan 21 mins jugando y pinta para empate


I'm guessing 21 mins means 21 minutes.

7.47pm: 
Here's Dan:

Kasparov can choose between two plans: a pawn storm on the queenside (safest) 
or a pawn storm through the middle (dynamic and risky). C'mon Garry, be a man!


He adds:

(I wouldn't say that to his face, he's a bit scary)


Is a fight brewing?

7.49pm: 

12 a3 - he's going for the queenside pawn attack!


(Dan's exclamation mark) In my role as clock-watcher, I can confide that both 
players have about 15 minutes left.
Dan again:

This is the safest and probably the most sensible option. Black comes under 
long-term pressure, and it is hard for him to find counterplay. White will 
advance the b-pawn, possibly to b5 looking to weaken Black's queenside pawns.

7.51pm: 

12...a5 from Karpov, preventing GK from advancing his b-pawn.

7.54pm: 
Bloomandcurll - I'm unaware of a functioning video link. Follow the pieces here
 <http://www.gva.es/ajedrez/ei_ajedrez_en.htm>though

"Speed chess is all about instinct," says Dan, as he criticzes Rowling again:

Kasparov now under 15 mins - Karpov still has 16 mins. GK has forgotten the 
lessons of the first game. Don't think - move!


Rather Dan than me, if he gets that cross with a computer...

7.57pm: 
Now Kasparov's dithering... but eventually makes his move, so to speak:

13 Rad1 - finally. Oh...he seems to be reverting to his plan of advancing in 
the centre. He has planning at some stage to advance with his e-pawn, and this 
rook will support the pawn centre moving forward.

Our man Giles confirms @gbro's earlier suspicion of a lack of interest from 
Valencians, albeit slightly more eloquently:

I estimate no more than 150 people turned up to watch today. (in a 350 seater 
lecture theatre), so Spanish enthusiam somewhat muted.
Also Portsmouth soccer fans might like to know that the owner of their club, 
Sulaiman Al Fahim, formally opened the tournament. Seems he's a former chess 
whizz himself and is also head of the UAE's chess federation.

7.58pm: 

Kasparov used a very similar strategy to defeat Nigel Short in one of their 
world championship games from 1993.


Says Dan, displaying a weirdly encyclopedic knowledge of Kasparov's previous 
matches.
He continues:

13...b6 from Karpov - he needs to bring out his queen's bishop otherwsie his 
rook in the corner will never enter the game.
14 e4 straightaway from GK...

7.59pm: 
Quickfire updates from our chess guru. (Guru or expert?) Guru.

14...dxe4 15 Nxe4 Qb8. An exchange of pawns and Karpov has been forced to 
retreat his queen to the back rank. Kasparov is assuming the initiative.

But Anatoly has a 5 minute time advantage...

16 Nc3 from GK

8.02pm: 
Meanwhile they're still not happy on the Internet Chess Club:

They have drugged these people in the break.


Whinges GM Suat Atalik of Turkey.

Dan's loving it though, as Rowling returns fire towards AK47 (I'll stop it 
soon):

Garry definitely has the stronger position - look at his active and 
centralised pieces compared to Anatoly's - but AK is a brilliant defender, 
never write him off.

8.05pm: 

If this were a normal tournament game with a slow time limit I would not 
hesitate in saying 'Kasparov will win', but speed chess is another bag of 
pieces.


Says Dan, using a turn of phrase I've never heard before. (Another bag of 
pieces..?)

Here's another Kingism:

The pieces are staring across the board from each other, seemingly without 
engaging, manoeuvring for position. It's a bit like a Serie A Italian league 
game. It's a game of football out there at the moment.

My contribution: Karpov's down in 5 minute territory, Kasparov sitting pretty 
with 9 left.

8.08pm: 
Dan says Karpov being down to 5 minutes is "crazy".
He continues:

16...Ba6 from Karpov - he is trying to exchange pieces to relieve the pressure.
17 Bxa6 Rxa6 - GK exchanges bishops, and in so doing leaves AK's rook 
offside...

8.09pm: 

More exchanges: 18 d5 Nxd5 19 Nxd5 cxd5 20 Rxd5 Ra7.

8.11pm: 
More from Twitter; @jondunford's disappointed there's no video... Me too, 
missed opportunity fromGeneralitat Valnciania 
<http://www.gva.es/ajedrez/ei_ajedrez_en.htm>

was really hoping for live video feed of Karpov and Kasparov.. big shame, 
would have been great to see the clash of the titans live!

8.13pm: 
Dan King doesn't reckon think Anatoly can win this. Have to "work hard for a 
draw," according to our man.
An update.

21 Qd2 . GK nudges the queen over, lining up behind the rook to attack Black's 
knight.

8.18pm: 

21...Nc5 Typical Karpov. He gives up a pawn in order to simplify the position.

But wait:

Garry will have none of it - he is going for a mating attack!!!

It's all happening as Karpov fights off GK's "mating attack" (ahem):

22 Nf6+ gxf6 23 Qxh6 f5

GK's queen in the danger zone right next to the queen...he has a draw if he 
wants just by checking the king..but can he get the rook in to deliver mate?

24 Qg5+ Kh8

Clearanceclarence is pondering the likelihood of GK's first name being Garry. 
Good point.

8.22pm: 
Dan's pretty sure GK's going to take this, and is talking quicker than I can 
type, but here's his thoughts:


25 Qf6+ Kg8
26 Rxf5..that's it the rook comes in and the game is over
26..Ne4 27 Qh4...
Ak can resign...

In the death throes now I reckon, at least if Dan's ever shortening sentences 
are anything to go by:

I don't see a defence to the attack with queen and rook
27...Re8 from AK...
and now 28 Rh5...
That's it - I don't see a defence to the check on h8.

8.22pm: 
KASPAROV WINS!

8.25pm: 
Karpov out of time again. The 150 people in the crowd go wild (I imagine).
Dan's verdict:

Just when it looked as though Karpov was extricating himself, Kasparov came 
with a bolt from the blue. Dare I say it... vintage Kasparov. All the cliches 
tonight...

But clearanceclarence raises the real issue of the night: is Garry a strange 
name for a Russian man?

Press conference coming up, where that question will probably not be asked. 
Will Karpov be carping on about the lighting?
Will Kasparov turn as white as a (friendly) ghost?

All good questions.

8.33pm: 

Avoid the crowd. Do your own thinking independently. Be the chess player, not 
the chess piece.


Advises @IamAshCash on Twitter. Probably not related to the grandmasters' 
duel, but sage advice nonetheless.
Still no final word on the pizza debate from Chess OK. Do we eat it or not?

8.40pm: 
So a fairly comprehensive couple of wins for Kasparov, who looked in pretty 
solid form throughout.
Here's Dan's verdict, via the rather different game of tennis 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/tennis>, which I think works quite nicely:

In the first game, Garry Kasparov 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/garry-kasparov>, the younger man at 46, 
clearly came to the board with the idea of creating a complicated position, 
hoping that Karpov at the age of 58, would be less mentally agile in an unusual 
situation. His strategy worked like a dream. Although Karpov probably had the 
stronger position, he spent too much time getting there and after just 24 moves 
he ran out of time.

In game 2 Kasparov built up a solid advantage with the white pieces without 
risk. He was playing from the base line, but hitting harder than Karpov. The 
only question was whether Karpov could keep the ball in play. He failed. To 
continue the dodgy tennis analogy, Karpov sent up a lob and Kasparov smashed 
into the corner. Karpov's king was laid bare with a stunning knight sacrifice 
and GK's queen and rook entered to deliver checkmate.

This could turn into a rout.

21.08pm: 

Kasparov's just been talking to the press, but no sign of Karpov, who probably 
has a lot to consider ahead of the coming ten matches.
"No doubt it gives me quite an advantage for the next playing days (but) I 
wouldn't make any predictions yet," said Kasparov.
"Karpov was and still is a great opponent. I have to find out whether I will 
be able to keep my calm."

Rather less respectfully, he revealed that Karpov has "three young 
professional players working with him" to prepare the games. (Kasparov 
presumably didn't mention his own 18-year-old Norwegian prodigy).

There's a more in-depth analysis of tonight's matches here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/22/chess-kasparov-karpov-rematch>. 

So two down, ten to go, but at the moment, it looks ominous for Karpov.
