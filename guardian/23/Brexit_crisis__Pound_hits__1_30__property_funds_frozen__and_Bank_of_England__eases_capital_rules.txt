Closing summary

A late update... our full news wrap of today’s events is now live.

Here’s a flavour:

The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday 
as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash 
and theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> warned that risks 
to the financial system had begun to “crystallise”.

City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar 
withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values 
of office blocks and shopping centres in post Brexit Britain.

The suspensions came on another day of drama on the financial markets, 11 days 
after the vote to leave the EU wrong-footed investors and sparked political 
turmoil. Developments included:

 * The pound plunging to a new 31-year low against the dollar, falling 2% to 
$1.30 at one point.

 * A closely watched survey of the services sector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/pound-hits-31-year-low-after-service-sector-data>
 coming in worse than expected, indicating a sharp slowdown in the wider 
economy.

 * The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up 
to £150bn worth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability>
 of loans to households and businesses.

 * Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high 
street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans 
available.

Here’s the full tale:

Expert: This isn't a repeat of 2008

Although the UK property sector is undoubtedly in a serious situation, it 
doesn’t look like we’re careering into a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.


Jason Holland, managing director of City advisers Tilney Bestinvest, explains 
that it’s different this time, partly because theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> has been so 
proactive:

The uncertainty around Brexit is undoubtedly a challenge for the property 
sector but this is not a post Lehman Brothers style moment when the whole 
financial system faced collapse and the supply of credit - key to property 
transactions - was in doubt.

The Bank of England has set out its readiness to provide vast amounts of 
liquidity and interest rates look set to be cut. Talk is moving decisively in 
favour of a pro-growth rather than a tax hiking Budget. The stock market has 
weathered Brexit bettered than many predicted and successful corporate bond 
issues this week from British American Tobacco and Brown Forman (the producers 
of Jack Daniels) suggest the Sterling credit market remains open for business.

Sign up for US jobs report alerts

The Brexit crisis has been causing angst across the global economy, with 
investors worried that it could hurt world economic growth.

On Friday, we’ll get an early insight into the damage cause by the EU 
referendum when the latest US jobs report is released.

And we are looking for readers to join an experimental group of users who will 
receive notifications about the report, from the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab.

At 1.30pm BST on the day the jobs report is released each month, we’ll be 
sending a series of alerts about the report’s numbers and what they mean. Web 
notifications are currently only available on Chrome, so if you have an Android 
mobile phone (Samsung, included!), we hope you’ll sign up.

Click here <https://www.gdnmobilelab.com/jobsreport/> to sign up for the 
experiment.

A late update... our full news wrap of today’s events is now live.

Here’s a flavour:

The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday 
as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash 
and theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> warned that risks 
to the financial system had begun to “crystallise”.

City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar 
withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values 
of office blocks and shopping centres in post Brexit Britain.

The suspensions came on another day of drama on the financial markets, 11 days 
after the vote to leave the EU wrong-footed investors and sparked political 
turmoil. Developments included:

 * The pound plunging to a new 31-year low against the dollar, falling 2% to 
$1.30 at one point.

 * A closely watched survey of the services sector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/pound-hits-31-year-low-after-service-sector-data>
 coming in worse than expected, indicating a sharp slowdown in the wider 
economy.

 * The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up 
to £150bn worth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability>
 of loans to households and businesses.

 * Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high 
street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans 
available.

Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
Although the UK property sector is undoubtedly in a serious situation, it 
doesn’t look like we’re careering into a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.


Jason Holland, managing director of City advisers Tilney Bestinvest, explains 
that it’s different this time, partly because theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> has been so 
proactive:

The uncertainty around Brexit is undoubtedly a challenge for the property 
sector but this is not a post Lehman Brothers style moment when the whole 
financial system faced collapse and the supply of credit - key to property 
transactions - was in doubt.

The Bank of England has set out its readiness to provide vast amounts of 
liquidity and interest rates look set to be cut. Talk is moving decisively in 
favour of a pro-growth rather than a tax hiking Budget. The stock market has 
weathered Brexit bettered than many predicted and successful corporate bond 
issues this week from British American Tobacco and Brown Forman (the producers 
of Jack Daniels) suggest the Sterling credit market remains open for business.
 
The Brexit crisis has been causing angst across the global economy, with 
investors worried that it could hurt world economic growth.

On Friday, we’ll get an early insight into the damage cause by the EU 
referendum when the latest US jobs report is released.

And we are looking for readers to join an experimental group of users who will 
receive notifications about the report, from the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab.

At 1.30pm BST on the day the jobs report is released each month, we’ll be 
sending a series of alerts about the report’s numbers and what they mean. Web 
notifications are currently only available on Chrome, so if you have an Android 
mobile phone (Samsung, included!), we hope you’ll sign up.

experiment.
 
There she goes! The pound has just slid to the $1.300 mark for the first time 
in over three decades, having shed 2% today.
