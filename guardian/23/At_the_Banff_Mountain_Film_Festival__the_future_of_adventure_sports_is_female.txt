In a 1989 broadcast, David Letterman introduced the greatest climber in the 
world by saying that the athlete had “a lovely little outfit on”. Lynn Hill had 
just come off a several-year sweep of climbing competitions, including the 
world class Rock Master Invitational, and was ranked No1 in the world by the 
Association of Sport Climbers International. She would go on to complete the 
first free ascent of the Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, California, and 
the first free ascent in under 24 hours, a feat that’s only been repeated by 
one climber in the 20 years since. She accomplished all this while remaining, 
as one journalist put it, “probably the greatest athlete the general public has 
never heard of”.

Women in adventure sports have come a long way since the 80s and 90s, when the 
majority of outfitters still made gear exclusively for men. But in some ways 
the same barriers persist. In September,GQ magazine featured a high-fashion 
climbing spread <http://www.gq.com/story/fall-fashion-rock-climbing-joshua-tree>
 that was so gendered it seemed almost a farce to many in the climbing 
community. The glossy article featured three of the world’s best male climbers 
bouldering in Joshua Tree National Park while ornamented by lightly dressed 
fashion models who looked on from below.

While the spread prompted widespread scorn (and this sendup featuring 
“designer clothes for watching ladies climb” 
<https://www.outdoorresearch.com/blog/stories/we-took-falls-crunchiest-designer-clothes-to-watch-ladies-rock-climbing-in>
), Hill could only laugh at the $3,000 vest in which the magazine dressed one 
of the climbers.

“Climbing used to be more about non-conformism,” says Hill. “And now with the 
gyms and the rules and everything, it’s going in the opposite direction, 
towards conformism.”

With climbing’s popularity booming, it’s subject to mainstream push and pull. 
But what can feel like progress for the sport might just be more exposure. 
Despite major competitive accomplishments from female athletes, they still 
don’t get the kind of attention men do. “The hardest thing to realize is that 
you can make a lot of effort and there’s still a long road ahead of you,” Hill 
says.

Acknowledging that gap, the Banff Mountain Film and Book Festival, an annual 
gathering of the best media makers covering the outdoors and adventure sports, 
built this year’s theme around women in adventure. The film festival tours all 
over the world for the better part of a year and strongly influences exposure 
for adventure athletes.

“Our number one piece of feedback over the last five years is that we want 
more content that features women,” says Jim Baker, head of the festival’s world 
tour.

In response, the festival constructed this year’s program to feature notable 
women in the outdoors, like Hill, who appeared as keynote speaker. From films 
about athletes like ski mountaineer Kit Deslauriers to books by authors like 
2016 National Geographic Adventurer of the YearSarah Marquis 
<https://www.amazon.com/Sarah-Marquis/e/B00E1WCHLI/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1>, 
this year’s offerings feel notably more diverse.

The festival’s grand prize in books went to Ice Diaries by Jean McNeil 
<https://www.amazon.com/Ice-Diaries-Antarctic-Jean-McNeil/dp/1770413189>, a 
Canadian fiction and travel writer. The haunting memoir draws from a year she 
spent in the Antarctic, interwoven with stories from dark, cold places all over 
the world.

The film festival’s grand prize went to Shepherdess of the Glaciers 
<https://www.banffcentre.ca/articles/shepherdess-glaciers-takes-grand-prize-banff-mountain-film-and-book-festival-2016>
, a feature-length documentary about one of the last female sheepherders in 
Ladakh, India, who lives alone in the high mountains 5,000 meters above sea 
level, tending 300 goats.

 Shepherdess of the Glaciers, the 2016 Grand Prize winner 
Hill spoke about her hope that coverage of female adventurers will eventually 
be broad enough to cement the fact that women are no less capable than men. She 
points out that while men and women have to climb differently based on 
different biomechanics, at 5ft 2in, her build hasn’t held her back.

“The modern, ultimate level should be that men and women are – equal is a nice 
word – but we are unique,” says Hill. “A woman does approach climbing 
differently from a man. Probably because of a lower center of gravity, they’ll 
stay over their feet more, while men try to muscle through. But we can have 
mutual respect in terms of accepting each other.”

The psychological barriers to women competing are as real as anything solid. 
If women don’t appear as athletes in sports films or coverage in magazines, 
that has an impact. Hill has advocated for women and men to compete together in 
climbing events to encourage a movement away from the psychological block 
against women being competitive.

“The way we perceive challenges has a lot to do with how we manage them,” says 
Hill. “If you perceive something as being really scary or too difficult – all 
these little stories we tell ourselves – then it will be that.”

Even for women who don’t want to compete in sports like climbing, the way 
those pursuits are made accessible and represented still has a broader social 
impact.

“It’s actually more important for women to do activities that are empowering, 
like climbing, because social conditioning that happens on a very subconscious 
level does not tell women that they should be strong and take the lead and be a 
lot of the qualities that climbing demands of us,” says Hill. “I think it’s 
very important to challenge ourselves.”

The Banff Mountain Film Festival will tour 41 countries this year. Its UK and 
Ireland tour runs from January to May 2017 and its US tour runs from December 
2016 to May 2017. To find outwhen the Banff Mountain Film Festival is coming to
