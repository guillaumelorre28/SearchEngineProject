FULL TIME: Bosnia-Herzegovina 1-1 Republic of Ireland

And that’s that! A truly farcical second half comes to an end. In the thickest 
of pea-soupers, Ireland have come away with a very respectable draw, and a 
priceless away goal! It could have been even better but for Edin Dzeko’s late 
equaliser, but my goodness they’d have taken this at the start of the evening. 
It’s nothing more than the Irish deserved for a determined defensive 
performance, and a place atEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> is still very much within 
their reach. Monday night promises to be quite an event. Hopefully we’ll get to 
see all of it.

90 min +3: Four extra and extra-foggy minutes, will be played. Three have 
already elapsed without incident. “Sara Jevo (75 min) might have a point,” 
writes Simon McMahon. “Look at how difficult England, Wales and Northern 
Ireland find it to qualify for major finals because they can’t pick players 
from Scotland.”

90 min: For Dzeko, now read McCarthy. He’s already fortunately escaped one 
booking, and now, having bundled over Duric with extreme prejudice, has 
fortunately escaped another. He too would have missed Monday’s return. Both 
teams will be thankful the referee got out of the right side of bed today / 
wasn’t able to see any further than the end of his nose.

89 min: Dzeko slides in recklessly on Whelan. That’s from behind, and should 
really have been a booking. But the referee has been very lenient tonight, 
going against type, and he continues to be so. That’s quite a big non-decision, 
because Dzeko would have been out of the return leg in Dublin had he gone in 
the notebook there.

The Irish goal exploded from the fog out of nowhere, and so did this. Vranjes 
scampers away from McClean down the right and whips a low ball into the box.

GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-1 Repubilc of Ireland (Brady 81)

A long whack downfield. Brady drops a shoulder to cut inside from the right, 
past a floundering Sunjic. He batters low towards the bottom right. It bobbles 
over Begovic’s hand, and into the net! That took a little bit of piecing 
together from 1950svision, but it did happen!

79 min: ... nothing much happens. Pjanic sends a daisycutter into the box, 
perhaps hoping for some crazy pinball in the fog. The ball breaks to Spahic on 
the edge of the area. Spahic sends a gentle chip into the arms of Randolph.

75 min: In the absence of anything to look at - though the football is still 
going on, we can hear it - here’s another marvellously entertaining treatise on 
the state ofBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> from Sara Jevo: “As a 
glass half-empty kind of guy, I’m fairly happy with the match so far. To be 
perfectly honest I was baffled, and in some perverse way insulted, by the 
coverage of these play-off games here on Guardian. See, we’re not really good 
at all this football stuff, no matter how much outsiders like to romanticize 
eastern European teams. Since the break up of Yugoslavia, apart from Croatia’s 
freak ‘98 WC campaign, we’re all actually quite shite without each other. 
Imagine Midlands for example, playing footie on their own and trying to qualify 
for World Cup if England fell apart, and everyone still talked them up as if 
they’re talking about old powerhouse that was England. Ahem. Yeah, it’s like 
that. We even have Ibišević - a homeless man’s Rooney.” Isn’t the current 
Rooney the homeless man’s Rooney?

72 min: Wilson brings down Ibisevic on the right. Before the free kick can be 
taken, Duric replaces ... Visca. Eh? He’s been the best player on the pitch by 
some distance today. Unless someone out on the far side has spent the last 20 
minutes dribbling up and down the field like Garrincha, of course. There’s no 
way of knowing that hasn’t happened. But what a strange substitution.

71 min: Visca still appears to be the best home hope. He makes a bit of ground 
down the right for thenth time, but his hard and low cross is smothered by 
Randolph with blue indistinct blobs hovering.

70 min: This is preposterous. Will the referee’s patience run out? You 
couldn’t blame him if he calls this off. If the game’s abandoned, they’ll play 
out the remaining minutes tomorrow, or at some other mutually agreed time.

67 min: Ward is replaced by Wilson. Hats off to the referee for spotting the 
substitution board. The only other thing visible is the automated advertising 
hoarding. Uefa won’t be panicking yet, then.

60 min: Keogh and Hendrick combine to make an almighty balls up of a common or 
garden clearance. The ball breaks to Lulic, who has a batter at goal from the 
left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Randolph makes himself big to smother. A 
superlative save.

59 min: McClean comes on for Hoolahan. They might as well have just thrown him 
on without telling anyone, or taking anyone off. Who’s going to notice in this 
fog?

56 min: A weird atmosphere now at the Stadion Bilino polje. Quiet and 
brooding. Hard to know whether it’s because the home side are struggling to 
break down obdurate opponents, or simply because nobody can see a bloody thing. 
“Years of watching Ireland seem to be finally making me go blind,” writes 
Justin Kavanagh. “My mother warned me.”

54 min: Perhaps the best form of defence is attack. Brady finds a little space 
down the left, and his deep cross is met by Hendrick, coming in from the other 
flank. His header lands on the top netting, as close as Ireland have come.

53 min: And danger here, too. Once again Visca makes off down the right. His 
cross is once again for Dzeko, and once again it’s poor. But the ball only 
comes back to Vranjes, whose whipped high cross causes a little more trouble. 
Ireland survive, but they’re being pressed back here.

52 min: Pjanic hooks a ball down the right for Visca. If the cross is good, 
Dzeko is tapping in from six yards. But it bobbles a bit, allowing Clark to 
slide in and divert the ball towards Randolph. Danger there.

48 min: A free kick just inside the Irish half, Whelan having handled 
needlessly. Pjanic launches towards a packed box. It’s deflected en route, and 
pinged harmlessly into the arms of Randolph. Much of that comes with a 
disclaimer: there’s a real pea-souper in Zenica. It’s probably more of a 
problem right now for the television cameras (and therefore us) than the 
players at ground level, but if it gets much worse we could have a problem.

47 min: Brady makes off down the left. His cross is easily cleared, but lands 
at the feet of Whelan, 25 yards out. He blooters it goalwards, but that’s only 
going to be any good in rugby.

And we're off again!

No changes for Ireland, who were back out nice and early. Martin O’Neill isn’t 
particularly happy at his side being kept waiting, and makes the point with 
force and feeling to a Uefa rep. Eventually the hosts turn up. No changes for 
them, either. It’s fairly foggy in Zenica all of a sudden, incidentally. 
Visibility might become a problem if things get much worse.

HALF TIME: Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-0 Republic of Ireland

And that’s that for the opening 45. The hosts have been the better side, but 
haven’t got much on target, and Ireland will be happy enough with their work so 
far.

43 min: It threatens to kick off for a couple of seconds, as Mujdza and Clark 
both slide in on a 50-50 ball. In truth, both challenges are a bit useless, 
rather than reckless or vicious, and in the resulting tangle of legs, it’s 
Mujdza who comes off worse. A boot crumps in his chest. But it’s accidental, 
and while a few players congregate for a bit of a frown and a shout, it all 
calms down quickly enough, and everyone’s all right.

41 min: Lulic dribbles with purpose down the left, but his low cross is 
deflected back to his own keeper by Keogh. A slight sense that the hosts have 
lost a bit of confidence after failing to turn their early dominance into 
something tangible.

And that’s that! A truly farcical second half comes to an end. In the thickest 
of pea-soupers, Ireland have come away with a very respectable draw, and a 
priceless away goal! It could have been even better but for Edin Dzeko’s late 
equaliser, but my goodness they’d have taken this at the start of the evening. 
It’s nothing more than the Irish deserved for a determined defensive 
performance, and a place atEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> is still very much within 
their reach. Monday night promises to be quite an event. Hopefully we’ll get to 
see all of it.
 
90 min +3: Four extra and extra-foggy minutes, will be played. Three have 
already elapsed without incident. “Sara Jevo (75 min) might have a point,” 
writes Simon McMahon. “Look at how difficult England, Wales and Northern 
Ireland find it to qualify for major finals because they can’t pick players 
from Scotland.”

90 min: For Dzeko, now read McCarthy. He’s already fortunately escaped one 
booking, and now, having bundled over Duric with extreme prejudice, has 
fortunately escaped another. He too would have missed Monday’s return. Both 
teams will be thankful the referee got out of the right side of bed today / 
wasn’t able to see any further than the end of his nose.
 
89 min: Dzeko slides in recklessly on Whelan. That’s from behind, and should 
really have been a booking. But the referee has been very lenient tonight, 
going against type, and he continues to be so. That’s quite a big non-decision, 
because Dzeko would have been out of the return leg in Dublin had he gone in 
the notebook there.
 
88 min: Lulic is replaced by Hajrovic. “Can’t say I saw either of those goals 
coming.” Ladies and gentlemen, Fergus Carroll. He’s here all week, try the 
Ćevapi.
 
86 min: McGeady comes on for Brady.
 
The Irish goal exploded from the fog out of nowhere, and so did this. Vranjes 
scampers away from McClean down the right and whips a low ball into the box. 
Dzeko cracks a low shot home from the edge of the six-yard box.

84 min: Ibisevic wins a corner down the right, but Pjanic’s delivery is headed 
clear at the near post by Whelan.
 
A long whack downfield. Brady drops a shoulder to cut inside from the right, 
past a floundering Sunjic. He batters low towards the bottom right. It bobbles 
over Begovic’s hand, and into the net! That took a little bit of piecing 
together from 1950svision, but it did happen!

79 min: ... nothing much happens. Pjanic sends a daisycutter into the box, 
perhaps hoping for some crazy pinball in the fog. The ball breaks to Spahic on 
the edge of the area. Spahic sends a gentle chip into the arms of Randolph.
 
78 min: Dzeko feeds Pjanic down the middle of the park. McClean rather 
clumsily attaches a high foot to the playmaker. Free kick, 30 yards out. From 
which ...
 
75 min: In the absence of anything to look at - though the football is still 
going on, we can hear it - here’s another marvellously entertaining treatise on 
the state ofBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> from Sara Jevo: “As a 
glass half-empty kind of guy, I’m fairly happy with the match so far. To be 
perfectly honest I was baffled, and in some perverse way insulted, by the 
coverage of these play-off games here on Guardian. See, we’re not really good 
at all this football stuff, no matter how much outsiders like to romanticize 
eastern European teams. Since the break up of Yugoslavia, apart from Croatia’s 
freak ‘98 WC campaign, we’re all actually quite shite without each other. 
Imagine Midlands for example, playing footie on their own and trying to qualify 
for World Cup if England fell apart, and everyone still talked them up as if 
they’re talking about old powerhouse that was England. Ahem. Yeah, it’s like 
that. We even have Ibišević - a homeless man’s Rooney.” Isn’t the current 
Rooney the homeless man’s Rooney?
 
72 min: Wilson brings down Ibisevic on the right. Before the free kick can be 
taken, Duric replaces ... Visca. Eh? He’s been the best player on the pitch by 
some distance today. Unless someone out on the far side has spent the last 20 
minutes dribbling up and down the field like Garrincha, of course. There’s no 
way of knowing that hasn’t happened. But what a strange substitution.
 
71 min: Visca still appears to be the best home hope. He makes a bit of ground 
down the right for thenth time, but his hard and low cross is smothered by 
Randolph with blue indistinct blobs hovering.
 
70 min: This is preposterous. Will the referee’s patience run out? You 
couldn’t blame him if he calls this off. If the game’s abandoned, they’ll play 
out the remaining minutes tomorrow, or at some other mutually agreed time.
 
67 min: Ward is replaced by Wilson. Hats off to the referee for spotting the 
substitution board. The only other thing visible is the automated advertising 
hoarding. Uefa won’t be panicking yet, then.

65 min: Cocalic comes through the back of Murphy. No booking, though there 
should be. Murphy takes an absolute age to get up, much to the annoyance of the 
crowd, who whistle and jeer like billy-o.
 
63 min: This is farcical. Some indistinct white shapes move up and down the 
far side of the pitch. It’s like watching football in Moominvalley.
 
60 min: Keogh and Hendrick combine to make an almighty balls up of a common or 
garden clearance. The ball breaks to Lulic, who has a batter at goal from the 
left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Randolph makes himself big to smother. A 
superlative save.
 
59 min: McClean comes on for Hoolahan. They might as well have just thrown him 
on without telling anyone, or taking anyone off. Who’s going to notice in this 
fog?

56 min: A weird atmosphere now at the Stadion Bilino polje. Quiet and 
brooding. Hard to know whether it’s because the home side are struggling to 
break down obdurate opponents, or simply because nobody can see a bloody thing. 
“Years of watching Ireland seem to be finally making me go blind,” writes 
Justin Kavanagh. “My mother warned me.”
 
54 min: Perhaps the best form of defence is attack. Brady finds a little space 
down the left, and his deep cross is met by Hendrick, coming in from the other 
flank. His header lands on the top netting, as close as Ireland have come.

of Mensur Mujdza. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA  
53 min: And danger here, too. Once again Visca makes off down the right. His 
cross is once again for Dzeko, and once again it’s poor. But the ball only 
comes back to Vranjes, whose whipped high cross causes a little more trouble. 
Ireland survive, but they’re being pressed back here.
 
52 min: Pjanic hooks a ball down the right for Visca. If the cross is good, 
Dzeko is tapping in from six yards. But it bobbles a bit, allowing Clark to 
slide in and divert the ball towards Randolph. Danger there.
 
51 min: Bosnia-Herzegovina make their first change: Mujdza is replaced by 
Vranjes.
 
50 min: This is like watching television in 1953. Marvellous.
 
48 min: A free kick just inside the Irish half, Whelan having handled 
needlessly. Pjanic launches towards a packed box. It’s deflected en route, and 
pinged harmlessly into the arms of Randolph. Much of that comes with a 
disclaimer: there’s a real pea-souper in Zenica. It’s probably more of a 
problem right now for the television cameras (and therefore us) than the 
players at ground level, but if it gets much worse we could have a problem.
 
47 min: Brady makes off down the left. His cross is easily cleared, but lands 
at the feet of Whelan, 25 yards out. He blooters it goalwards, but that’s only 
going to be any good in rugby.
 
No changes for Ireland, who were back out nice and early. Martin O’Neill isn’t 
particularly happy at his side being kept waiting, and makes the point with 
force and feeling to a Uefa rep. Eventually the hosts turn up. No changes for 
them, either. It’s fairly foggy in Zenica all of a sudden, incidentally. 
Visibility might become a problem if things get much worse.

And that’s that for the opening 45. The hosts have been the better side, but 
haven’t got much on target, and Ireland will be happy enough with their work so 
far.
 
45 min: A bit of a scramble in the Irish area, allowing Dzeko to attempt a 
shot on the turn from the right-hand edge of the D. It’s blocked at source by 
Ward.
 
43 min: It threatens to kick off for a couple of seconds, as Mujdza and Clark 
both slide in on a 50-50 ball. In truth, both challenges are a bit useless, 
rather than reckless or vicious, and in the resulting tangle of legs, it’s 
Mujdza who comes off worse. A boot crumps in his chest. But it’s accidental, 
and while a few players congregate for a bit of a frown and a shout, it all 
calms down quickly enough, and everyone’s all right.
 
41 min: Lulic dribbles with purpose down the left, but his low cross is 
deflected back to his own keeper by Keogh. A slight sense that the hosts have 
lost a bit of confidence after failing to turn their early dominance into 
something tangible.
