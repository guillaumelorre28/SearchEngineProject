A Paddy Power TV ad promising that even “riff raff” could take part in a 
Cheltenham betting promotion has been banned.

The tongue-in-cheek ad, fronted by Fonejacker star Kayvan Novak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/04/paddy-power-unveils-spoof-complaints-ads-days-after-damning-report>
, featured the actor telling a caller to Paddy Power’s “complaints line” that 
its betting offer is available to “everyone – even riff raff”.


The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
received almost a dozen complaints that the ad was misleading as the Cheltenham 
betting offer was not open to all customers.


Paddy Power admitted that the particular offer was not available to all 
customers.


The company said it blocked about 0.5% of its customer base from participating 
if they had been identified as potentially “abusing the offer or using the 
offer to guarantee profits regardless of the outcome”.


The ASA’s investigation found that the majority of those that complained about 
the claim in the TV ad were already aware that Paddy Power had restricted their 
accounts.


However, the ad watchdog said that in a case where it was emphatically stated 
that the betting promotion was open to everyone it was not enough to have 
on-screen text stating “T&Cs apply”.


“Because we considered that consumers, including those who were subject to 
account restrictions, would infer from the ad that everyone could take up the 
promotion, when that was not the case, we concluded it was misleading,” said 
the ASA.


“We told Paddy Power not to state or imply that a promotion was open to 
everyone if that was not the case.”
