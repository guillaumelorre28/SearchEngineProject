Oh the giddy naivety of January: a year’s worth of films lying ahead, sight 
unseen, possibilities endless. And the bittersweet reflection of December: the 
hits, the misses, that film whereJennifer Lopez was given a first edition of a 
book written in ancient Greece

of the year as we long-listedthe 88 films to get excited about in 2015

Our top film of the year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/18/the-50-best-films-of-2015-in-the-uk-no-1-45-years>
 was an almost entirely unknown quantity back in January. While writer/director 
Andrew Haigh had impressed with his heartfelt and vibrant romance Weekend and 
intelligent HBO series Looking, taking on a drama about an older couple dealing 
with skeletons surrounding their 45th wedding anniversary was a gamble. We 
predicted a “complex marital drama”, but we couldn’t have guessed just how 
devastating the film would be and that Charlotte Rampling would be a dark horse 
Oscar contender.

The return of Todd Haynes, with a cast led by Cate Blanchett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett> and Rooney Mara, was 
admittedly a bit of a no-brainer for any 2015 preview. But the film’s runaway 
success (a best actress win for Mara at Cannes, five Golden Globe nominations, 
Oscars predicted to follow) was beyond any expectation for a 1950s-set lesbian 
romance.

The first English language film from Dogtooth director Yorgos Lanthimos had 
quite easily the oddest concept of the year: man must find soulmate in 45 days 
or get turned into wild animal. But he turned what could have been a quirky 
curio into a perceptive and ultimately poignant film about dating rituals and 
the often brutal search for love.

Two Noah Baumbach <https://www.theguardian.com/film/noah-baumbach> films in 
one year seemed too good to be true but quietly, and bizarrely without any 
awards recognition as yet, he delivered them both perfectly formed yet 
differently targeted. While we might have mistakenly pictured Greta Gerwig as 
the lonely freshman (it was in fact Lola Kirke), we rightfully assumed another 
well-observed comedy.

Out of Michael Fassbender’s many 2015 films, this one seemed like the least 
likely bet. After all, he had Steve Jobs and Macbeth on the way. But this 
psychedelic western became his most consistently enjoyable of the three. It’s a 
surreal, smartly told and proudly absurdist film that felt more inventive than 
Fassbender’s more staid projects of the year.

It was technically untitled when we included it in our list, with potential 
names Deep Tiki and Volcano Romance on the horizon, but Cameron Crowe’s 
entirely misjudged military conspiracy romance comedy drama arrived with a 
title as forgettable as the end product. The film, with the wasted cast of
Bradley Cooper <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper>, Emma Stone, 
Rachel McAdams and Bill Murray, was dumped in US cinemas before quietly being 
spat out on VOD in the UK. Crowe’s impending move to the small screen seems 
like a smart career choice.

2015 promised to be a big year for Tom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy> with roles in Legend, Mad Max: 
Fury Road, London Road and this crime thriller on the cards. Alongside a cast 
that included Noomi Rapace and Gary Oldman and based on a best-selling 
potboiler, this should have been an easy win. But it was a disaster, flopping 
at the box office with a $50m (£33m) budget to waste and receiving tepid 
reviews from critics.

Admittedly, this one was a bit of a shot in the dark. Napoleon Dynamite 
director Jared Hess has struggled somewhat since his breakout hit with Nacho 
Libre and Gentleman Broncos fizzling but neither received quite as much hate as 
this Sam Rockwell-starring faith satire.In The Guardian, Jordan Hoffman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/don-verdean-review-bible-belt-satire-has-audience-begging-for-deliverance>
 claimed the only thing to root for is “the eventual deliverance of the closing 
credits”.

With a prime Cannes slot, a cast including an on-a-roll Matthew McConaughey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/matthew-mcconaughey> and Naomi Watts and a 
director primed for a comeback, it seemed like a safe bet. But Gus Van Sant’s 
ponderous drama was rightly booed during its first screening and received some 
of the most toxic reviews of the year. Peter Bradshaw called it “exasperatingly 
shallow”. The film is yet to be officially released.

Perhaps fooled by the inclusion of Robert De Niro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro> and by Nancy Meyers’ earlier 
career success, we mistakenly thought that her latest would be an enjoyable 
piece of lightweight entertainment. But the film became a laughing stock for 
its series of cliches coated in sugar and became another nail in De Niro’s 
already nail-filled coffin.
