 earlier in the day for his dismissal during Sunday’s Premier League clash 
between the same two sides. But he said United’s performance had filled him 
with “real happiness” and was quick to praise Mkhitaryan’s contribution to a 
vibrant attacking display.

“I’m so happy with his performance today because it was against a Premier 
League team with Premier League qualities and characteristics,” said the United 
manager. “Against Feyenoord we could think, ‘Okay, it’s a different profile of 
football but today against a typical Premier League team, ‘Micky’ could perform 
this way.

“We are really happy. We know the reason we bought him and were waiting for 
his reputation. It looks like it’s coming.”

Mkhitaryan, who was named man of the match despite two goals apiece from 
Anthony Martial and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, said: “I’m pleased that we won. It was 
a very important game because now we’re in the semi-finals. We’ve done a good 
job and need to keep going.

“Playing in a cup final at Wembley is a dream but it’s not the main goal now. 
We have to focus on the next game and we’ll see what happens.”

United will face Hull in the semi-finals with rivals Liverpool drawn against 
Southampton.
