My wife and I went to the Almeida Theatre in Islington several years ago. Alan 
Rickman was in the audience (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-obituary>, 14 
January). At the interval we went to the bar. Rickman walked in and the crowd 
parted to let him make his way to the bar. “A glass of red wine, please,” he 
said, in a tone that sounded like he was delivering a speech from a play by 
Shakespeare. The whole bar applauded!

• I am indeed saddened to hear of the death of Alan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-rickman>, though by no means a filmgoer 
for the past 50 years or so. My immediate reaction was to recall a BBC TV 
production years ago of Trollope’s Barchester Towers, in which Rickman played 
the bishop’s chaplain, the Rev Obadiah Slope.

It was an outstanding performance which has remained vividly in my mind and, 
having just re-read the description of Slope in all his utter awfulness (“a 
pawing, greasy way with him”), I have re-lived that performance. Many of your 
filmgoing readers and, no doubt, knowledgeable fans of Rickman’s many later 
performances (which excludes me, of course!), would surely benefit were theBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> prevailed upon to repeat Barchester 
Towers as a tribute to this splendid actor.

• Following the untimely deaths of the French singer Michel Delpech, David 
Bowie and now Alan Rickman, can we say that 69 is the new 27?
