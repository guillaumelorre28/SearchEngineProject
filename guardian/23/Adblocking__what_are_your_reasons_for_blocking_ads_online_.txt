.

A recent report revealed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/01/more-than-nine-million-brits-now-use-adblockers>
 that 22% of the UK’s internet users have an adblocker installed, up from 18% 
just three months earlier. And that figure rises to almost half for 18- to 
24-year-olds.

We’d like to hear from people who regularly use adblockers. What are your main 
reasons for blocking online advertising with this software? Have publishers 
gone too far with digital ads? What other methods to build online audiences and 
revenue do you think would be more productive? Or do you agree with John 
Whittingdale that “if people don’t pay in some way for content, then that 
content will eventually no longer exist”?
