In the early hours of Tuesday morning, as the credits for Gavin and Stacey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gavin-and-stacey> rolled for one last 
time, the era of BBC3 as a traditional television channel came to an end.

In a cost-saving move for the BBC, the channel, launched 13 years ago, becomes 
the first in the world to make the transition from TV broadcast to asolely 
online platform 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/26/bbc3-tv-channel-to-be-switched-off-by-february-bbc-trust-confirms>
 as BBC3’sbudget is cut from £85m to £30m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/feb/14/bbc3-the-tv-channel-thats-now-an-online-first-destination>
, with the savingsploughed into drama on BBC1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/07/saving-bbc3-cutting-funds-dramas-sherlock>
.

The channel was launched in 2003 and set out to create programmes that brought 
in younger audiences between the ages of 16 and 24, broadcasting to around 11m 
viewers each week. It was responsible for launching the careers of James Corden 
and Matthew Horne onGavin and Stacey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gavin-and-stacey>, David Walliams and 
Matt Lucas onLittle Britain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/18/media.bbc1> and Julia Davis on 
Nighty Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/13/nighty-night-box-set-review-julia-davis>
.

The channel was also home to some of the BBC’s most provocative shows over the 
past decade, including the dark animated comedyMonkey Dust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/21/next-box-set-monkey-dust>
, which featured the voices of Sharon Horgan and Rebecca Front, as well as the 
fantastical cult comedyThe Mighty Boosh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/nov/10/television.bbc>, created by 
Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt, which ran from from 2004 to 2007.

 Toby Whithouse, who was the writer behind one of BBC3’s most successful 
original dramasBeing Human 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/mar/08/being-human-bbc-right-kill-off>
, said the channel had fulfilled its brief, not in terms of drawing in young 
audiences necessarily, but in becoming a home for more cutting edge programmes.

BBC3: the TV channel that’s now an … ‘online first destination’

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/feb/14/bbc3-the-tv-channel-thats-now-an-online-first-destination>
“I’m not sure how much I’ve ever believed that a channel is watched by a 
specific demographic. The age of the audience of Being Human, for example, was 
much more widespread than the small target that BBC3 was going for. But I think 
what BBC3 did was that it gave home to the more experimental shows and that’s 
why it was very important for us and for the show. I don’t thinkBeing Human 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/being-human> would have thrived as 
much on BBC1 or BBC2.

“I think it took a while but, in the end, BBC3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc3> did have a very clear idea of its own 
identity and, on the whole, their commissioning was very astute.”

 Whithouse predicted that BBC3’s move online would soon be closely followed by 
other channels in 10 to 15 years and said he would have no objection to his own 
work debuting on an online-only platform.

 He said: “Younger people do watch most TV online anyway so I don’t think it’s 
a colossal culture shift; the notion of watching something at an appointed time 
on an appointed channel is increasingly anachronistic. As long as they still 
have the budgets, it’s an opportunity to be more creative and more left-field.”

 Damien Kavanagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/07/bbc3-damian-kavanagh-youth-offer>
, the BBC3 controller, was adamant that the channel would continue to produce 
the quality drama and current affairs programmes that have won it plaudits 
despite the shift online and cuts to budget.

Recent successes for BBC3 include a documentary on male depression and suicide 
by rapperProfessor Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/27/professor-green-men-suicide-documentary-bbc3>
 and the dramaMurdered By My Boyfriend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/16/teenage-girls-domestic-violence-truth-risk-message-schools>
, based on a true story, which wonGeorgina Campbell the TV Bafta for best 
actress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/13/bafta-winner-georgina-campbell-we-wanted-it-to-be-truthful-and-real>
 in 2015.

 “The variety of forms that we can now produce content in is very interesting 
for our creative teams,” said Kavanagh. “I think the focus of the channel going 
forward – ‘make me laugh’ and ‘make me think’ – feels much sharper from an 
editorial point of view. We can allow people to do things that I don’t think 
other broadcasters can really do at the moment – in terms of giving people room 
to try things and also play around with form in a way we couldn’t have done if 
we’d stayed on television.

 “Of course it’s a risk. Anytime you try and do anything new and play with 
content, it’s a risk. The safety net in it is that we are part of the BBC; we 
are part of a big ecosystem.”

Kavanagh said moving the channel online fitted in with an age where 70% of UK 
adults (31 million) were using catch-up services such as BBCiPlayer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/iplayer> to watch TV. It enables the channel 
to create much more immediately responsive content and programmes, skipping 
over the months and even years it can take to develop a new show for television 
broadcast. “We can adapt and tell stories in different ways and respond to 
things a lot quicker,” he said.

Kavanagh pointed out that Netflix and Amazon Prime programmes were winning 
awards, so there was no reason BBC3 shows would not keep taking homeBaftas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/baftas>.

Upcoming commissions for the online BBC3 include a new series of the Greg 
Davies comedyCuckoo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/25/bbc3-to-work-with-idris-elba-and-skins-writer-for-online-only-show-lineup>
, a follow-up to Murdered By My Boyfriend and a new series of Life and Death 
Row, the Bafta-winning documentary series looking at capital punishment through 
the eyes of young people. All new BBC3 drama commissions will also be aired on 
either BBC1 or BBC2.

Other innovative formats being trialled by the channel include original 
shortform shows, such as The Man Who Witnessed 219 executions, which will be 
made up of three five-minute episodes.

 As part of the transition online, 20% of the overall BBC3 budget will be set 
aside to create newshort-form and viral content 
<http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-26/bbc3-controller-promises-a-bright--and-viral--online-future-from-2016>
, The Daily Drop, which will include parodies, videos, show spin-offs, articles 
and sports updates. The channel will also have outlets on YouTube, Facebook and 
Snapchat.

Shaun Pye, the co-writer of Monkey Dust, said he hoped the move online would 
revive the riskier, more provocative commissioning that he said had gone from 
channels such as BBC3 in the past few years.

“Back when we made Monkey Dust, BBC3 was a really good entry for new writers 
to get off the ground and I do think it reached out to younger audiences in a 
way that other channels didn’t,” said Pye. “But I don’t think Monkey Dust would 
ever get made by BBC3 as it is now. So the commitment to new types of shows 
with their move online, especially with short form stuff, will be a much needed 
place for young new writers to go. There aren’t a lot of other places at the 
moment.”
