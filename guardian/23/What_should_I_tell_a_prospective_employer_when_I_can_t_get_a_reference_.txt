Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
are two similar dilemmas – what are your thoughts?

How can I get a reference from an employer who just won’t provide one? I am 
studying, and looking forward to getting back into work once I finish the 
course. I’m three months away from completion and have had interviews. I have 
emailed my previous boss to provide references but received no answer after 
seven days.

I admit that we never got on. However, I complied with all my work 
expectations and took full responsibility for everything I did. Nor was I ever 
late or absent without permission or with a wrong attitude.

What should I do when faced with a prospective employer looking for references 
from my previous employer?

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a
