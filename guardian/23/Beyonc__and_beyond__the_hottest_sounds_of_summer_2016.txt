Skepta: Konnichiwa 


The thrilling revival of Skepta has mirrored that of UK grime itself. Before 
the Tottenham rapper was owning 2015 with his track Shutdown, his career had 
become derailed by the lure of major label money, and he was makingcheesy 
tracks about Rolex watches <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnar90VEwe4> with 
tacky dance routines in an attempt to mimic Dizzee’s Bonkers rise. Skepta has 
since found strength through going back to basics, and although comeback album 
Konnichiwa has been delayed, you get the sense that it’s because he’s 
determined to get this one right.

Busted

With McBusted on the road last year, you could be forgiven for thinking that 
fans of early noughties pop-punk would be over re-formation hysteria. However, 
with the return of Charlie Simpson,who left Busted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/jan/14/popandrock> 10 years ago 
vowing never to return, 100,000 arena concert tickets were shifted in the first 
hour of their release. The band – also featuring Matt Willis and James Bourne – 
aim to entice fans old and new by bringing British YouTuber Emma Blackery and 
Teenage Dirtbag rock group Wheatus on the road for their Pigs Can Fly tour.

Bob Dylan: Fallen Angels

Bob Dylan’s late-career reinvention as a crooner continues with a second 
successive set of standards – all bar one previously recorded by Frank Sinatra. 
This most quixotic of performers is now spilling all his musical facets out, 
one after another – last year it wasan 18CD set of every note he recorded 
during 1965 and 1966 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/05/my-back-pages-bob-dylan-bootleg-series-illuminates-his-past>
 – as if daring anyone to suggest they know what he represents. The contrast 
between the Thin Wild Mercury Sound of 50 years ago and the ragged crooner of 
today could hardly be greater.

Adam Ant

To tie in with a deluxe box set of Adam and the Ants’ breakthrough second 
album, Kings of the Wild Frontier – which with its cocktail of African-inspired 
drums, spaghetti western guitar and Native American-influenced whooping and 
chanting is surely one of the most unlikely records in pop history to propel an 
artist to teenybopper stardom – the band’s redoubtable mastermind, still a 
brilliant live performer, will take to the stage to play the album in its 
entirety.

Bruce Springsteen

The Boss shows no signs of slowing down: at 66, he still stages large tours at 
a moment’s notice, still plays for more than three hours, still leaves 
audiences exhilarated and baying for more. This latest jaunt with the E Street 
Band sees him revisit his 1980 double album The River, playing it in full and 
then adding on what for most bands would be a whole additional set of extra 
material. There’ll be no gimmicks, no visual effects, no state-of-the-art 
technology; just rock’s most versatile band and one man who can hold a stadium 
crowd in the palm of his hand.

Radiohead

After playing London’s O2 on their previous trip to the capital, this time 
around Radiohead, much to the misery of millions of fans, decided to downscale 
to three nights at the 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, a former railway engine shed. 
The news of a tour was accompanied by the usual frenzied speculation about a 
new album, which, according to one member of their management company, sounds 
“like nothing you’ve ever heard”. Regardless of whether ticketholders will be 
privy to revolutionary new material or simply slurring along to Karma Police, 
every era of the band’s back catalogue guarantees melancholic euphoria.

Beth Orton: Kidsticks

Not many people would have predicted Beth Orton’s next move would be to 
collaborate on a krautrock-inspired electropop album with one ofFuck Buttons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/19/fuck-buttons-kings-of-noise>, 
but we’re pleased it’s happened. From the tracks Orton has premiered so far 
(Moon and 1973), Kidsticks promises to be a radical departure from 2012’s folky 
Sugaring Season, one that is both synth-heavy and rhythmically interesting.

ABC: The Lexicon of Love II

It’s a bold move on the part of Martin Fry, the only remaining member of the 
ABC lineup who recorded their debut album, to announce a sequel, nearly 35 
years on. The Lexicon of Love may be the most celebrated album to emerge from 
the early 80s “new pop” movement: a lavish confection of classic pop 
songwriting, dancefloor infections and sumptuous strings and brass, the latter 
the work of arranger Anne Dudley, who reprises her role on the sequel.

Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul

2012,One Day I’m Going to Soar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/dexys-one-day-im-review>, the 
band’s excellent comeback album after 27 years away, saw them embracing their 
theatrical side. But the forthcoming Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and 
Country Soul appears to be an about-turn, consisting of soulful interpretations 
of predominantly Irish folk standards such as Carrickfergus and Curragh of 
Kildare. Kevin Rowland says it’s a project he has wanted to get off the ground 
since the mid-80s, and with typical contrariness the band tell us that it isnot 
a covers album. So there you go.

doctors told him to quit or risk losing his hearing. Their statement on the 
matter was terse to the point of rudeness. The appointment of Guns N’ Roses 
leader Axl Rose as his short-term replacement will shore up ticket sales, but 
raises questions: how will the world’s most efficient rock’n’roll organisation 
cope with having the planet’s most unpredictable frontman on board?

shows in snorkelling gear? Why not, eh? With tracks such as Start a Party,

Beyoncé

Her new album, Lemonade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with>
, has led some to claim Beyoncé is a kind of musical cross between Martin 
Luther King and Maya Angelou. She’s also a shrewd businesswoman who knows 
precisely the value of her brand – which is why tickets for her shows aren’t 
just seated or standing: you can also get BeyHive, BeyGoldCircle, Platinum and 
Beyswag packages, depending on just how much money you want to spend. The shows 
will be spectacular, but the real winner will be Beyoncé’s bank account.

Maxwell: blackSUMMERS’night

Before there was Miguel there was Maxwell. Twenty years after his definitive 
neo-soul album, Urban Hang Suite, the Brooklyn singer returns to the 
jazz-inflected R&B scene he helped establish. The new album, 
blackSUMMERS’night, comes after a seven-year absence, during which he turned 
40, and experienced the deaths of his cousin and his grandmother. Part two of a 
musical trilogy – following 2009’s Grammy award-winning BLACKsummers’night – 
finds the artist readjusting his mindset but retaining his inimitable 
smoothness.

Possibly Colliding

This new music weekend curated by contemporary composer and pianist Nils Frahm 
boasts boundary-pushing musicians, from Penguin Cafe, Wildbirds and Peacedrums 
to Britten Sinfonia Voices. The German-born Frahm, who sits where contemporary 
classical meets electronic music, will also play his only gig of 2016.

Love Supreme Jazz Festival 

The South Downs festival returns with an ambitious mix of big-name jazz, soul, 
funk, r&b and hip-hop. Pop legends such as Burt Bacharach and Grace Jones share 
the bill with jazz-inspired singer-songwriters Esperanza Spalding and Melody 
Gardot, meteorically risen saxist-bandleader Kamasi Washington, the new trio of 
guitarist John Scofield, pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana, as 
well as a raft of local talent.

Kendrick Lamar at Hyde Park

Last year, Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly won every critics’ poll going 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/18/best-albums-of-2015-no-1-to-pimp-a-butterfly-by-kendrick-lamar>
, from Pitchfork to Waste Management News (probably), and garnered praise for 
confronting the rising inequalities and racial tension bubbling away in 
America, and for its melding of modern production (courtesy of Flying Lotus, 
Thundercat) with the retro feel of 70s jazz and psychedelic soul. But having to 
translate its anger and underlying torment to a sunny park in London – not 
always the easiest outdoor music venue in which to make a connection – means 
the challenges haven’t ended for him just yet. 
•2 July, BST Hyde Park, London <http://www.bst-hydepark.com/events/detail/7>.

Carole King at Hyde Park

Perhaps the success of Beautiful, the musical based on her songs and life 
story, has convinced the queen of the Laurel Canyon set that it’s worth her 
coming to London to perform her 1971 smash album Tapestry in its entirety for 
the first time. While audience tears will doubtless be shed, it’s a moot point 
whether standing in a crowd of 60,000, a quarter of a mile from the stage, is 
the best way to hear this intimate record being played live.

Flit 

A handful of folk’s most visionary thinkers collaborate with BAFTA-winning 
animators to explore tales of migration through music and animation. Becky 
Unthank and Edinburgh-born singer songwriter Adam Holmes perform songs by 
Scottish musician Martin Green (best known as Lau’s accordion genius) with 
lyrics – inspired by first-hand stories – by Karine Polwart, Aidan Moffat, 
Sandy Wright and Anais Mitchell. Whiterobot (Will Anderson and Ainslie 
Henderson ) bring their trademark wit and wisdom to the visuals.

Green Man festival

Arguably the summer’s nicest festival – its closest rival is End of the Road 
<http://endoftheroadfestival.com/>, in Dorset in September – Green Man offers a 
stunning location in the Brecon Beacons, plenty to do that isn’t music, 
including talks, films and activities, and a list of artists who bathe in 
acclaim: Belle & Sebastian, James Blake, Julia Holter, Jason Isbell, White 
Denim, Floating Points and many more. Do take waterproofs though: Green Man has 
a reputation for dampness.

Reading and Leeds festivals

The rite-of-passage festivals for kids who have just got their GCSE results 
are now split three ways: part rock, part dance, part hip-hop (with a 
smattering of pop). It’s hard to see what appeal Red Hot Chili Peppers will 
have for the teens, but Disclosure, Foals, the 1975, Skrillex’s Jack Ü and A$AP 
Rocky will surely attract heaving throngs. Those who miss the days when Reading 
was all about metal should congregate at the Pit stage to catch the likes of 
Mastodon.
