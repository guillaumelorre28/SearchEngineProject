I booked easyJet <https://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjet> flights 
through the Nectar website and paid for hold luggage for our family of five. At 
the airport we were told I hadn’t booked any hold luggage. EasyJet’s customer 
services desk suggested that this happens a lot when people book through 
Nectar. I had to pay for the five bags with the reassurance I’d be able to 
claim the money back on my return.

However, Nectar refuses to pay. It says that my confirmation email didn’t show 
that baggage had been paid for. Well, no, it didn’t. But neither did it state 
“cabin baggage only” – which an easyJet confirmation normally does.

Obviously it’s in its interests to say as little as possible on confirmation 
emails – and I have no control over what they choose to specify. My return 
boarding pass, on the other hand, does declare that I’d paid for hold luggage 
even though there was no record of this when we flew home, so I had to fork out 
yet again.AC, Edinburgh

EasyJet claims that your predicament is rare and that, while hold baggage was 
added to your original booking, it was not transferred on to its system. 
Nectar, when alerted byThe Observer suddenly discovers that you did pay for the 
luggage after all. It says it is investigating how this could have happened.

Now, after weeks of intransigence, it can’t do enough, phoning twice in an 
hour, transferring the money to your account and donating 5,000 Nectar points 
(about £25-worth) to soothe your feelings. It would be interesting to know if 
airline staff are right and this is a frequent pitfall with Nectar bookings.
