Mark Carney doesn’t help himself by sounding so irritated when asked an 
awkward question. If you’re governor of the Bank of England, it’s best to 
remain good-humoured even whenJacob Rees-Mogg is prodding you in the ribs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/bank-of-england-governor-rejects-accusations-of-bias-over-eu-referendum>
.

But let’s stick to what Carney and the Bank have actually said about Brexit. 
On the facts, they’ve done nothing wrong. It would be odd if Threadneedle 
Street, with a mandate to promote monetary and financial stability, had nothing 
to say about a referendum that has potential consequences on both fronts.

That was the context in which Carney set his warning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite>
 last month that “a vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects – 
on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy’s supply potential.”

His comment about sterling is a statement of the bleedin’ obvious: you only 
have to observe how the currency markets twitch with opinion polls to 
appreciate the point. And, post-Brexit, speculation about the UK’s future 
trading relationship with the EU could surely dampen economic activity, if only 
because some companies would delay investment decisions.

This is hardly mischievous political meddling on Carney’s part, as Rees-Mogg 
thinks. Rather, it is an unremarkable economic analysis that many in the leave 
camp share.

Some of those Brexiters argue the short-term pain would be worth it in the end 
– either because the UK’s trade elsewhere would bloom, or because we would 
achieve greater distance from the dysfunctional eurozone. If Carney strayed 
into that territory – from either direction – he would have overstepped the 
mark. But he didn’t.

Meanwhile, Rees-Mogg’s intended googly – why is the Bank talking now when it 
is silent during general elections? – didn’t threaten the stumps. Referendums 
really are different: they are about single issues and their outcome is binding 
immediately.

Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, had it right when he 
said Carney & co would have had a harder time if they had taken “a vow of 
omerta” on the referendum. Quite. Let the Bank speak about risks – that’s its 
job.

Standard Life man makes stand against Shell auditor EY 

Boardroom pay grabs all the attention in the corporate governance wars, so 
well done Guy Jubb of Standard Life for demonstrating there’s more to it.

Jubb has kicked up a fuss about Shell’s appointment of EY – the former Ernst & 
Young – as its auditor. Standard Life voted against EY at Tuesday’s meeting and 
collected some co-travellers. Around 7.5% of votes were cast againstEY 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ernst-and-young> – not a big rebellion, 
but enough to spoil the usual 99%-plus majority enjoyed by auditors.

Standard Life’s complaint is that Shell’s new audit partner at EY is the 
fellow who did the same job at recently acquired BG Group. That arrangement is 
obviously problematic: Shell has bet its future on the £35bn takeover and now 
its lead auditor will be making judgments on assets that he had signed off in 
his last job. Objectivity could be impaired, argues Standard Life.

Shell, naturally, argues that “appropriate safeguards are in place” and that 
potential conflicts of interest can be managed. Too fussy. Just get a fresh 
pair of eyes on the job.

Hypersensitive Exxon bans Guardian from AGM

Keep it in the ground 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground>, this 
newspaper has argued for ages on fossil fuels. Then keep out of our annual 
meeting, replies ExxonMobil.

Or, to quote Exxon’s media relations manager, Alan Jeffers: “We are denying 
your request [to attend Wednesday’s meeting] because of the Guardian’s lack of 
objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with 
anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide 
energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.”

Corporate arrogance-cum-hypersensitivity on this scale is rare these days. One 
suspects Exxon’s board is still cross that it haslost its battle 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-shareholders-exclusive-idUSKCN0WP2TG>
 to prevent resolutions on climate change being put to the meeting.

The New York State Retirement Fund – backed by investors from around the world 
– has been allowed by the US Securities & Exchange Commission to table a 
proposal that would oblige Exxon to publish an annual assessment of the effect 
on its business of governments’ policies to limit climate change.

Oil industry rivals BP, Shell and Statoil have willingly supported and adopted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/bp-promises-more-transparency-on-climate-issues>
 similar proposals. Exxon, by contrast, seems determined to resist, just as it 
refuses to contemplate the possibility that some of its shareholders may 
sympathise with the Guardian’s reporting and wish to read a firsthand account 
of the meeting. Grow up.
