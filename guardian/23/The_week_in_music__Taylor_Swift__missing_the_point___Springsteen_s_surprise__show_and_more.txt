Nineteen-year-old barista Maggie Poukkula sparked some Kurt Cobain-related 
hysteria last Friday when she tweeted old photographs of her father playing 
live with Nirvana in 1987. The Washington house show was the band‚Äôs first ‚Äì 
though Poukkula initially didn‚Äôt think the photos were that historic. For fans 
of the band, it‚Äôs another chance to see the kind of archive materials that 
appeared in Brett Morgen‚Äôs recent documentary,Montage of Heck

Phil Rudd was arrested and held in custody overnight in New Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/20/phil-rudd-released-on-bail-after-being-jailed>

The AC/DC <https://www.theguardian.com/music/acdc> drummer may not be coping 
particularly well with his eight-month house-arrest sentence. On Sunday, he was 
arrested and held in custody overnight, allegedly for owning or consuming 
alcohol and thus breaking the terms of his sentence. Rudd‚Äôs out on bail as of 
Monday, and will enter a plea in court on 3 August. He picked up the original 
sentence after pleading guilty to threatening to kill a former employee, and 
possession of marijuana and methamphetamine.

Noel Gallagher stated the obvious about working with his brother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/19/noel-gallagher-relationship-my-brother-oasis-achilles-heel>

Gallagher‚Äôs turn on BBC‚Äôs Desert Island Discs did more than remind everyone 
that Noel is almost 50. The former Oasis songwriter and High Flying Birds 
frontman said that being in a band with Liam was his achilles heel, because 
‚Äúyou know how to push each other‚Äôs buttons‚Äù. To be fair, I think we all 
understood that their relationship was tumultuous, but it‚Äôs always a treat to 
hear it directly from Noel now and again.


MTV announced this year‚Äôs Video Music Award nominees ‚Ä¶ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/taylor-swift-mtv-vma-nominations>

It‚Äôs almost that time of year again, when the US pop industry wheels out 
memories of Miley Cyrus quasi-twerking ‚Äì oh, I mean, when MTV celebrates the 
cultural importance of the music video. That‚Äôs right: we‚Äôre almost in VMA 
season. Cyrus is set to host this year‚Äôs ceremony, andTaylor Swift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift> led the list of nominees on 
Tuesday with nine award nods. That all sounds fine. Hardly surprising, but fine.

‚Ä¶ Nicki Minaj tweeted her disappointment ‚Ä¶  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-twitter-feud-vma-awards>

Minaj, nominated in three categories, felt Anaconda had been overlooked in the 
video-of-the-year category. She used the nominee news as a springboard to share 
her view that black women are not being adequately rewarded for their 
contributions to pop culture. Over a series of tweets, she implied that were 
she a ‚Äúdifferent ‚Äòkind‚Äô of artist‚Äù, her provocative video may have pulled in 
more nominations. Lest we forget, Cyrus‚Äôs Wrecking Ball, also provocative, and 
watched by millions on YouTube, won video of the year last year.

The Nicki Minaj debate is bigger than Taylor Swift's ego

‚Ä¶ and then Taylor Swift made it all about her

As can so often be the case when someone tries to get serious on Twitter, 
Minaj‚Äôs point about authorship and recognition was soon sidetracked. In this 
case, by Taylor Swift. Thepop star replied 
<https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/623616796277506048> to one of Minaj‚Äôs 
tweets <https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/623608271774072832>, about 
nominated videos celebrating slim women‚Äôs bodies, saying it was unlike Minaj to 
‚Äúpit women against each other‚Äù. The Guardian has already publishedtwo articles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/22/nicki-minaj-debate-bigger-than-taylor-swifts-ego>
 on theproblematic elements of Swift‚Äôs response 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/22/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-faux-feminist-tone-deaf>
, so we won‚Äôt get into it again.

Whichever side you‚Äôre on (if you even care at all, by this point), it was an 
interesting example of how intersectional feminism, pop music and, somehow, the 
VMAs can all collide in an intellectually complicated mess. At the end of it 
all,Swift apologised

Mod-affiliated shirt brand Ben Sherman was sold. Again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/20/ben-sherman-sold-marquee-brands-us-private-equity-firm>

Ben Sherman is synonymous with mods, skinheads and those guys who made 
patterned short-sleeved shirts a thing again, post-Oasis ‚Äì and it‚Äôs now been 
snapped up by a private equity firm. The brand was first sold by its founder in 
the 70s, so it will be interesting to see whether this acquisition will lead to 
a resurgence. Perhaps the new owners can peg it to a new sub-genre ‚Äì PC music? 
The next reincarnation of witch house? ‚Äì and watch its popularity surge again.

Bruce Springsteen played a surprise gig in New Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/19/bruce-springsteen-surprise-gig-new-jersey>

The Boss gave gig-goers in his home state an unexpected treat last weekend. He 
rocked up during Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers‚Äô set, blessing the gig 
attendees with a rare performance and generally reminding everyone else why 
he‚Äôs one of Jersey‚Äôs best-loved exports. As far as stage invasions go, I trust 
this is one that people were happy to witness.

 Some fan-shot footage from Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs surprise gig on 18 July 2015 
Eminem uses a wider lyrical vocabulary than Bob Dylan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/23/hip-hop-kanye-west-beats-bob-dylan-breadth-lyrical-vocabulary>

According to an analysis of song lyrics by the 93 biggest-selling musicians, 
four rappers use more extensive vocabularies than Dylan.Eminem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem>, Jay Z, Tupac and Kanye West each 
used more than 5,000 words in up to 100 of their lengthiest tracks, while Dylan 
used 4,883. Predictably, some Guardian commenters defended Dylan with 
quality-over-quantity arguments. It seems that some readers will forever insist 
that rap is anti-intellectual and misogynistic, no matter what the evidence 
says.

Michael Jackson wanted to play Jar Jar Binks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/24/michael-jackson-wanted-to-play-jar-jar-binks-in-star-wars-prequels>

It‚Äôs oddly comforting to know that there were still people willing to say no 
to Jackson‚Äôs ill-conceived ideas at the height of his fame. George Lucas 
managed to squirm out of casting Jacko as the fairly universally despised Jar 
Jar Binks, in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Actor and filmmaker 
Ahmed Best said he landed the CGI part that Jackson had originally wanted to 
play, in Thriller-style prosthetics, in a recent Vice interview. A close shave 
for us all.
