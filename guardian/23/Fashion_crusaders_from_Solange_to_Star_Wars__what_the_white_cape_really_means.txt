When is a cape just a cape? Rarely, as proven by Ben Mendelsohn’s baddie in 
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story>. In his role as 
Director Orson Krennic, a middle-management imperial lackey, he has turned the 
off-white cape into a real takeaway from the new film.

It’s worth restating the obvious at this point: Star Wars bad guys usually opt 
for black. But, rather than blindsiding us with its political correctness, the 
white cape is actually a triple power move. The colour isCornforth White 
<http://www.farrow-ball.com/cornforth-white/colours/farrow-ball/fcp-product/100228>
 from Farrow & Ball, a mid-tone, off-white shade, which was the colour of 2016 
for people in positions of power. It’s what Hillary Clinton chose for her 
final-debate pantsuit, is a similar shade to Melania Trump’s jumpsuit worn to 
her husband’s victory speech and is Michelle Obama’s favourite dress colour. 
Also, capes are the root of shoulder-robing, that peculiar frow-friendly trend 
for wearing your coat on your shoulders, leaving your hands free to text or 
wield the lanyard to the Death Star. And they have been a consistent coat trend 
for the past five seasons, worn by Solange to her 2014 wedding, and most 
recently seen on the Gareth Pugh catwalk. The giveaway here is that the model 
wore sunglasses indoors while modelling.

As Mendelsohn has explained, it is significant as a performance tool as well 
as a prop: “It gives you a dignity and an uprightness that you might not have 
had otherwise. It’s the sign of a great costume.”
