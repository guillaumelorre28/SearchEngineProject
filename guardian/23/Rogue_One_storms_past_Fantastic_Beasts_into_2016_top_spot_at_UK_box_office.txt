The 2016 winner: Rogue One

Prior to release, many assumed that Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards>
 would turn out to be the year’s top-grossing film at the UK box office, and 
now this has indeed occurred. With £52.1m after 18 days of play, Rogue One is 
more than £1m ahead of its nearest competitor among 2016 releases: Fantastic 
Beasts and Where to Find Them.

A year ago, The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming>
 had reached £97.4m at the same stage of its run, on its way to a final total 
of £123.2m. If Rogue One performs with a similar pattern, it would reach a 
tally of £65-66m. That would require a remarkably long tail, but given that 
it’s not really being challenged in the blockbuster space currently, it’s 
highly achievable.

The 2016 runner-up: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

Fantastic Beasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
 did enjoy the warm glow of being the top grossing film of the year – but for 
less than a week. By the end of the Christmas weekend, the wizarding adventure 
had reached a total of £47.5m, still in second place for 2016 and just behind
Bridget Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 (£48.1m). Fantastic Beasts overtook Bridget on 26 or 27 December, briefly 
earning first place for 2016, but by 1 January Rogue One had already elbowed it 
aside.

Fantastic Beasts cast: ‘A bunch of squirrels together ... that’s pretty 
fantastic’ – video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/17/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-eddie-redmyane-video-interview>
With £51m so far, Fantastic Beasts has now overtaken the UK box office of four 
of the eight Harry Potter films – although adjusted for ticket-price inflation, 
it has yet to catch any of them.

The comedy hit: Why Him?

With an opening gross of £2.18m, Why Him? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/22/why-him-review-bryan-cranston-james-franco>
 has landed in second place in the UK box office chart and is the top new 
release for the period. However, it’s worth noting that the Bryan 
Cranston/James Franco comedy opened on Boxing Day, and so had seven days of 
ticket sales rolled into that figure. For the weekend period, takings were a 
less impressive £821,000 – enough for fifth place.

The obvious comparison title is Daddy’s Home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/daddys-home-review-will-ferrell-mark-wahlberg>
, which opened on Boxing Day 2015 as the big Hollywood comedy for last year’s 
post-Christmas period. That teamed Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, and opened 
with £1.63m (earned from just two days: 26 and 27 December), on its way to a 
total of £17.4m.

Daddy’s Home benefited from a 12A certificate, positioning it as a comedy for 
the whole family. In contrast, Why Him? is a 15. During the holiday period, 
there is a big upside for titles that can appeal to family members across 
multiple generations. Why Him? benefits from a generation-gap plot dynamic, but 
its appeal is more niche than Daddy’s Home.

Also benefiting from a Boxing Day release are Monster Trucks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/26/monster-trucks-review-chris-wedge-rob-lowe>
 (£1.73m debut) andCollateral Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/collateral-beauty-review-will-smith-helen-mirren-keira-knightley>
 (£1.18m). Strip out all those extra days of play, and the weekend tallies for 
these films fall to £748,000 and £492,000 respectively.

Michael Fassbender on Assassin’s Creed: ‘Genetic memory makes a lot of

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/dec/23/michael-fassbender-on-assassins-creed-genetic-memory-makes-a-lot-of-scientific-sense-to-me-video-interview>
Three major new releases opened on New Year’s Day, but are absent from the 
official comScore chart:Assassin’s Creed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/19/assassins-creed-film-review-michael-fassbender-videogame-marion-cotillard>
,A Monster Calls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/29/a-monster-calls-review-liam-neeson>
 and Martin Scorsese’sSilence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/10/silence-review-the-last-temptation-of-liam-neeson-in-scorseses-shattering-epic>
. In all cases, these films are being treated as new releases for the coming 
weekend, and they will report eight-day opening grosses (1-8 January) in a 
week’s time. On Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday, the three titles in fact earned 
more than £3m between them.

The slow burn: Moana

It’s been a long slog for Moana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/moana-review-disney>, but the 
Disney Animation title is now in a far better place than its debut weekend 
takings indicated. The film began on the first weekend of December with an 
uninspiring £2.21m including previews of £33,000. Aswe remarked at the time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/dec/06/uk-box-office-moana-sully-fantastic-beasts>
, this beginning was even worse than Disney Pixar’sThe Good Dinosaur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/the-good-dinosaur-review-desperately-disappointing-and-twee>
 the year before, which started with £2.93m. Moana ended the New Year weekend 
with a cumulative total of £13.70m, and holiday Monday takings push the total 
up to £14.31m. The Good Dinosaur ended its run with £15.15m, making it Pixar’s 
lowest-grossing film ever at the UK box office. Moana won’t be one of Disney 
Animation’s great commercial achievements in the UK, but it should play to 
audience stragglers throughout January before being clobbered by Illumination’s 
Sing at the end of the month.

The Bollywood hit: Dangal

With £1.88m after ten days of release, Dangal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/22/dangal-review-bollywood-nitesh-tiwari-aamir-khan-wrestling>
 is the biggest Bollywood hit of 2016 at UK cinemas. The previous biggest for 
the year were Sultan (£1.79m), starring Salman Khan, and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil 
(£1.47m), starring Anushka Sharma, Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai. Dangal is a 
biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan), who taught wrestling to 
his two daughters, both of whom won medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

The Eagle Huntress trailer: a soaring tale of success against the odds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/dec/12/the-eagle-huntress-trailer-a-soaring-tale-of-success-against-the-odds-video>
Another title that’s picked up after a modest start is The Eagle Huntress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/18/the-eagle-huntress-review-documentary-mongolia>
. The documentary began in mid-December with an OK £23,600 from 27 cinemas, or 
£31,500 including previews. The film subsequently expanded – it was on at 52 
venues for the New Year frame – and it has now reached a healthy £168,000, 
including holiday Monday. The film has already grossed more than seven times 
its opening, with what looks to be plenty of life in it yet.

The future

Since the previous frame was blighted by Christmas Day, when cinemas are 
closed, it’s no great surprise to see takings 39% up overall on that reporting 
period. The better comparison is with the equivalent weekend from last year – 
which welcomedJoy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/joy-review-jennifer-lawrence-david-o-russell>
 andThe Danish Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/the-danish-girl-review-redmayne-tom-hooper>
 – and takings are down 14% on that session. Not much is opening this Friday, 
and that’s because the week’s principal new releases – Assassin’s Creed, A 
Monster Calls and Silence – are all already in cinemas. Assassin’s Creed – 
which reunitesMacbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/macbeth-review-shakespeare-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard>
 director Justin Kurzel with stars Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard – 
has not been well reviewed (a 36/100 score at MetaCritic), but cinemagoers have 
so far been more generous (6.6/10 at IMDb). Silence is currently being better 
appreciated by critics (82/100) than by early audiences (7.7/10). Silence’s 
distributor will be hoping that awards buzz will sustain the film through to 
the Oscars ceremony on 26 February, but it faces competition from other titles 
competing for awards includingLa La Land
