Inside Out (2015)

By the time the credits rolled on Pete Docter’s boisterous existential satire, 
it was easy to imagine that we all have a Star Trek-style “bridge” inhabited by 
colourful motivators representing different aspects of the human persona, from 
Joy and Sadness to Anger and Disgust, inside our minds. Pixar’s ingeniously 
simple idea smartly reimagined a child’s inner turmoil as an epic white-knuckle 
ride through conflicting emotions and memories, as 12-year-old Riley Andersen 
desperately tries to adjust to strange and terrifying new experiences (such as 
broccoli infested pizza and hipster California classmates) with the help of the 
funny little people in her head. The sublime anarchy of the human condition 
beautifully rendered in dazzling primary colours. ★★★★★

 Unlikely friendship … Carl and Russell in Up. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images 
The best Pixar movies are often the ones the merchandise department must have 
struggled with the longest: it seems unlikely that Disney stores have sold many 
Carl Fredricksen and Russell toys over the years. OnlyPixar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/pixar> would make a film about the friendship 
between a curmudgeonly old widower determined not to give up his home to the 
ravages of corporate greed and a perky boy scout with daddy issues. A movie to 
brush away cobwebs from the soul, remove cataracts from the eyes and remind us 
that the spirit of adventure can never be entirely grounded, no matter how old 
we are. ★★★★★

 Chaplinesque … WALL-E with love interest EVE 
Like HG Wells’ The Time Machine, Andrew Stanton’s clarion call to the dangers 
of consumerism imagined a future in which we have lost our humanity through the 
horrors of indolence. But there are no terrifying Morlocks to menace the 
corpulent Eloi of the Axiom, only evil robot feeder types determined to keep 
their human charges in contented slothfulness for the rest of eternity. WALL-E 
himself makes for an unlikely, Chaplinesque hero, built entirely from 
mechanical parts yet somehow emerging as by far the story’s most ardently human 
participant. ★★★★★

 Revolutionary … cowboy Woody in the first Toy Story. Photograph:

Video never did quite kill the radio star, but Toy Story’s Oscar-winning CGI 
revolution really did wipe out the gilded Hollywood tradition for hand-drawn 
animation (though there have been occasional, sporadic rumblings of life in 
recent years.) However, an even more radical shift in the zeitgeist may have 
been the film’s relative absence of songs. BeforeToy Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/toy-story>, most animated movies were 
musicals. After Woody, Buzz et al made their presence felt, the genre was able 
to climb out of its box and begin talking a whole new language. ★★★★★

 Villain of the piece … Lots-O-Huggin’ Bear with Buzz Lightyear and Woody in 
Toy Story 3 
The real joy of this unexpected sequel lay in its ability to invent a 
meaningful circle of symmetry for the saga, Pixar bossJohn Lasseter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnlasseter> throwing a curveball by 
reconfiguring the trilogy around Andy’s story arc, rather than that of his 
colourful playthings. But, before the soon-to-be freshman can say goodbye to 
his toys for ever and begin the pathos-drenched journey into adulthood, there’s 
one last adventure to be had thanks to the nefarious plotting of the saga’s 
greatest villain yet – an evil bear who smells of strawberries. ★★★★★

What a strange confection this foodie feast represents. Despite its 
Francophile framing, Bird’s paean to epicurean pleasures feels fiercely 
Dickensian in its depiction of a naive young cuisinier vying to make his way in 
a cynical world (with the help of a gourmet rat). It was released in a golden 
age for Pixar during which the studio, by now owned by Disney, won the best 
animated film Oscar four years in a row. ★★★★☆

 Awash with fresh ideas … Finding Dory. Photograph: Pixar/AP 
Andrew Stanton’s return to animation after the disastrous response to John 
Carter <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/08/john-carter-review> does 
far more than just tick all the sequel boxes. Finding Dory’s genius (though 
some might call it cheating) is to find preposterous ways to bring the watery 
world of clown fish and blue tangs closer to our own as Ellen DeGeneres’ 
forgetful fish goes searching for her long-lost parents in a coastal oceanarium 
populated by grumpy octopi, helpful sea lions and a godlike disembodied voice 
known only as Sigourney Weaver. A fresh catch as bountiful as this is an 
encouraging sign that Pixar is entering a new, rich vein of form. ★★★★☆

 Existential dread … Mr and Mrs Potato Head in Toy Story 2. Photograph: 
Allstar/Disney/Pixar/Sportsphoto 
Disney wanted a quick, cheap, straight-to-DVD sequel to Toy Story, and part 
two of Woody and Buzz’s adventures, in which the rootin’ tootin’ cowboy is 
stolen by a toy collector and reunited with the Roundup Gang, was almost a 
disaster. Only Pixar’s refusal to compromise and its commitment to work around 
the clock to meet release deadlines allowed the final film to live up to the 
quality of its predecessor. With a fresh focus on the existential dread of the 
abandoned plaything, the sequel gave us perhaps the most emotive segue in 
animated history: Jessie the cowgirl’s tearful lament When Somebody Loved Me.

 A masterful feat of conceptual thinking … Monsters, Inc. Photograph: AP 
No compendium of childhood eccentricities would be complete without taking in 
the night terrors, so Pixar invented an entire world of menacing creatures 
whose job is to scare the living daylights out of poor little kiddies. John 
Goodman and Billy Crystal’s incomparable double act as Sulley and Mike brought 
a warm humanity to the freaky netherworld of Monstropolis, whose titular grand 
factory of ever-shifting doors, each one leading to a child’s bedroom, 
represented a masterful feat of outlandish conceptual thinking. ★★★★☆

 Awesome ocean odyssey … Finding Nemo 
Marlin the clownfish’s fishy odyssey across the ocean in search of his missing 
son was the first Pixar film to really go in hard on the age-old animated 
staple, the death of a family member. But, while Disney classics such as Bambi 
and The Lion King balanced grief with an abiding sense of fate and glorious 
birthright, director Andrew Stanton used it as fuel for comedy, as dear old dad 
is forced to leave the safety of the reef for open waters populated by all 
manner of wickedly vivacious creatures, from vegetarian sharks to surfer dude 
turtles and garrulous Aussie gulls. ★★★★☆

 A paean to childhood rebellion … Brave. Photograph: Pixar/AP 
Pixar’s sole foray into medieval fantasy is a rambunctious, vivacious affair 
that celebrates the power of non-conformity while pecking away at the nagging 
scab of childhood rebellion. Sister studio Disney Animation may have attracted 
more attention, with the following year’sFrozen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/frozen-review>, for reminding us 
that young women are not entirely reliant on romance and the willing arms of a 
charming suitor. And yet, with this lively, Oscar-winning tale of Caledonian 
pluck, Pixar was the first to split the arrow. ★★★★☆

 Part coming-of-age story, part western … The Good Dinosaur. Photograph: 
Allstar/Pixar/Disney 
A long and tortuous production process saw this tale of talking apatasauruses 
delayed by more than a year, with original director Bob Peterson removed to 
allow Pete Sohn to take charge. It’s part western, part coming-of-age story, 
with dino Arlo forced to find his own way in the world following the death of 
his hardworking dirt-poor farmer daddy. There are some nice touches, from 
sociopathic, parasitic pterodactyls to unexpectedly decent cowboy tyrannosaurs, 
but you wonder if the film suffered from the high bar Pixar had set for itself. 
It is noticeably superior to rival studio Dreamworks Animation’s own 
prehistoric fable,The Croods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/21/the-croods-review>. ★★★★☆

 Day of the locust (and ant) … A Bug’s Life. Photograph: 
Allstar/Cinetext/Disney/Pixar 
Like its controversial rival Antz, Pixar’s second film came into being because 
insect-like shapes and surfaces were among the few styles of animation that 
nascent CGI technology could do really well. Unfortunately for the studio, 
Dreamworks Animation’s venture had Woody Allen on board and a smarter storyline 
that used insects as a metaphor for the rigidity of human societies. Yet A 
Bug’s Life is decent enough entertainment, and in visual terms at least it has 
dated better than its competitors. ★★★★☆

 Back to school … Monsters University. Photograph: 
Allstar/Pixar/Disney/Sportsphoto 
Monsters Inc’s genius was to imagine that the monsters hiding in childhood 
closets are mostly just friendly, freakish-looking fellows going about their 
jobs. But this unnecessary prequel insisted on showing us what happened to 
Sully and Mike before they accidentally extracted little cutie Boo from her 
cosy bedroom. Tales of student debauchery can make fine R-rated comedies and 
semi-raunchy 80s frat boy romps, but they are far from logical material for a 
children’s animated film. ★★★☆☆

 Bright lights, big city … Cars. Photograph: Disney/Pixar 
Perhaps the most all-American of Pixar’s films, Lasseter’s petrolhead paean to 
forgotten small towns probably makes more sense if you have driven along route 
66 and seen some of these abandoned communities in the heart of America. Except 
even then, it is not all that interesting. Lightning McQueen may have been 
seduced by the hokey old charms of provincial life, but by the end most viewers 
were willing him to get back to the bright lights of the LA racetrack as soon 
as possible. ★★☆☆☆

 In reverse gear … Cars 2 
If Lasseter’s fondness for American car culture was the inspiration for the 
first movie, it’s not hard to suspect that the billions of dollars in resulting 
merchandise profits inspired the creation of a sequel. The follow-up completely 
departs from its roots via a shark-jumping gear shift into spy movie territory, 
as Mater the hillbilly tow-truck is accidentally recruited by some motorised 
British secret agents to help explore an international conspiracy involving 
motor fuel, while his good buddy Lighting embarks on a visually spectacular 
tour of global race tracks. After the late noughties golden era, this was the 
movie with which Pixar slipped lazily into reverse gear. ★★☆☆☆
