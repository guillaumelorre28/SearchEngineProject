This accomplished novel, winner of the 1974 Booker prize, is set in an 
invented resort, Bealthorpe, on the east coast of England: a world of 
landladies, beach towels and half-hearted dalliance. It is fiction’s equivalent 
to a sepia postcard, bringing out not what Philip Larkin dubbed as the 
“miniature gaiety” of the seaside but its dependable melancholy. Edwin Fisher 
returns to the scene of his childhood holidays for a week’s reflection on the 
end of his marriage, before running unexpectedly into his father-in-law, one of 
life’s jovial fixers, determined to put his daughter’s marriage back on track.

 ‘Travel narrows the mind’: Stevie Smith. Photograph: Carl Sutton/Getty Images 
The poet Stevie Smith, who lived with her aunt in Palmers Green, north London, 
memorably declared: “Travel narrows the mind.” Yet in this delightful novel 
(her favourite), she packs Celia’s bags for Lincolnshire where she visits her 
Uncle Heber, a vicar. She also gives Celia an Indian background and 
Lincolnshire is fancifully reconsidered: “I have the feeling it is India before 
me and not England; it is warmer, it grows warm and close, the night has a wild 
smell, a smell of dung, of sour smoke, of a magnolia, of a heavy scent…”

 Salter’s masterpiece features an unsatisfactory holiday on the Tuscan coast. 
Photograph: Elio Lombardo/Alamy 
This sensual, desolate masterpiece includes an unsatisfactory holiday taken by 
the middle-aged narrator, estranged from his wife, with a recently acquired 
Italian lover, Lia, on the Tuscan coast in April. “The country they were 
passing through was not what he had expected; it was bare, industrial 
seacoast.” Low-season holidays often suit fiction best because off-peak equals 
unpredictable. This is a barren non-honeymoon; the hotel is “isolated and 
expensive” and in a chilly, dark, mosquito-ridden room, two single beds are 
pushed together to form a double – a good symbol for two people not converging 
as they should.

A Room With a View

EM Forster <https://www.theguardian.com/books/emforster>, 1908
 Julian Sands and Helena Bonham Carter in the 1985 film adaptation of A Room 
WIth a View. 
Lucy Honeychurch, an upper-middle-class English woman, and her chaperone 
complain on arrival at Pension Bertolini in Florence (their room faces north, 
the meat served is second rate) but it is upon them that Forster turns his 
amusing and critical eye. The 1908 classic now reads as at once dated and 
fresh: “People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric 
trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter…” 
Lucy surrenders to “the pernicious charm of Italy” and begins to be happy.

The word “comfort” could not be more ironic. This is a nightmarish novel about 
Mary and Colin, who have been lovers for years and are on holiday in a city 
without a name – resembling Venice. It is fitting the city should be unnamed 
for this is about losing yourself in the worst and most complete way. The 
couple become involved with suavely hospitable Robert and Caroline whose taste 
for sado-masochism does not at first show itself. A masterly account of a 
holiday from which there can be no return.

The atmosphere of this unforgettably unsettling, bestselling novel is also 
what happens when people live on holiday and off-limits – beyond themselves. It 
is an idyll turned inside out. When Richard, a British backpacker, is given a 
map by a mysterious Scotsman about a hidden beach on the gulf of Thailand, 
inaccessible to tourists, it sounds like paradise. But what follows is a hip, 
drug-laden, grown-up version ofLord of the Flies. Chapter titles read as if 
torn from a breezy tourist guide: “Getting there” and “Beach life”.

Italian holidays get more than their fair share of literary attention but this 
uplifting novel is unmissable – reading it is almost as good as taking a 
holiday oneself. It begins with an advertisement in theTimes: “To Those Who 
Appreciate Wisteria and Sunshine. Small mediaeval Italian Castle on the shores 
of the Mediterranean to be Let furnished for the months of April.” A comically 
assorted group of women fetch up in the castle where each finds a happier 
version of herself. And because this is consummate gardener Elizabeth von Arnim 
writing, the castle’s garden is an Eden.

The hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva is, in a sense, a school. At least, it 
is the setting in which Edith Hope, an unmarried English woman in flight from 
an improper love affair, endures a sentimental education, spending her nights 
in a “veal-coloured” bedroom. Summer is almost over and each day contains “the 
seeds of its own fragility”, as if in sympathy with Edith herself. The novel 
won the Booker prize in 1984 and has not lost its melancholy power nor its 
unassailable elegance. It is the most autumnal of holidays with a low-season 
heroine.

“The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there.” This is the 
opening line of LP Hartley’s haunting novel about the heatwave summer of 1900 
when 13-year-old Leo Colston visits his friend Marcus in Brandston Hall, a 
country house in Norfolk. When Marcus falls ill, Leo gets caught up in a 
relationship he does not understand, delivering messages between Marcus’s 
beautiful older sister, Marian, and Ted Burgess, a tenant farmer. It is about a 
dawning sexuality coinciding with humiliation and a tragic fall from grace. The 
weather eventually breaks with metaphorical force.

 Tove Jansson. 
After the disturbance of many of these “holiday” novels, Tove Jansson’s 
novella reassures. Six-year-old Sophia and her grandmother have a gentle, 
philosophising relationship as summer unspools on a tiny island in the Gulf of 
Finland. It is at once idyllic, busy and engagingly real (it begins with the 
grandmother searching for her false teeth amid the peonies). It is possible to 
ask huge, idle questions about life and death and not to worry too much about 
the answers. “On an island,” the grandmother says, “everything is complete.”
