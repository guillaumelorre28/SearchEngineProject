Ladbrokes <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ladbrokes> has been given a 
red card by the advertising watchdog for using an image of Manchester United 
footballer Memphis Depay that was ruled to have broken the UK code on marketing 
to young people.

Under the UK advertising code, it is illegal to use people aged under 25, or 
someone who appears to be so, to play a “significant role” in promoting 
gambling.

An image of 21-year-old Dutch international Depay featured in an email from 
Ladbrokes promoting a money-back offer to punters.

The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
said featuring someone under the age of 25 in an ad is only allowed if they are 
the specific subject of a bet or on Ladbrokes’ own website.

“The ad had not appeared in a place, such as on the advertiser’s own website, 
where a bet could be placed directly through a transactional facility,” said 
the ASA. “Nor had he been used to illustrate specific betting selections where 
he was the subject of the bet offered.”

The ASA ruled that the ad was in breach of the UK code.

Ladbrokes is the latest betting company to be censured by the ASA for using 
young sportsmen to promote gambling.

Last month, the ASA handed down ad bans to Bet365, Coral and Totesport for 
using images of 22-year-old US Open champion Jordan Spieth inTwitter campaigns 
to promote betting

.

Last month, Ladbrokes hired Kristof Fahy, the former marketing chief of 
William Hill, as chief marketing officer.

Fahy joine dfrom Telegraph Media Group, where he was marketing chief for just 
seven months.
