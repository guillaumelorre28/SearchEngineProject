The winners: Warcraft and Turtles

With an official opening number of £3.62m, Warcraft: The Beginning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh>
 wins the box-office chart, just ahead ofTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of 
the Shadows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows-review-tmnt>
 on £3.5m. Both are seven-day figures. The films opened on bank holiday Monday 
last week with the half-term holiday under way. Warcraft’s figure includes 
£2.17m in previews earned on its first four days, while the Turtles picked up 
£2.02m over the Monday-to-Thursday period.

Apt comparisons for Warcraft are hard to frame, since notable big-screen 
adaptations of video games have been scant in recent years. Reboot/sequel
Hitman: Agent 47 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/27/hitman-agent-47-review-shoot-em-up-grind-em-down-with-dullness>
 debuted last August with £961,000 including previews of £171,000. As for Out 
of the Shadows, predecessorTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/16/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-review-total-turkey>
 began in October 2014 with £4.79m, including £1.56m in previews. A comparison 
of the three-day weekend periods reveals that the new film is significantly 
behind the pace: £1.47m, compared with £3.22m.

The real winner: Me Before You

Landing at number three in the chart with £1.79m, Me Before You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock>
 in fact outgrossed both Warcraft: The Beginning and Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles: Out of the Shadows on the weekend period. The film’s preview takings 
were a negligible £42,000. The adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ bestseller faced the 
challenge of a controversy erupting over the film’s storyline: paraplegic 
accident victim (Sam Claflin) chooses to end his life. While the news stories 
increased awareness, it’s hard to say how they affected box-office takings.

Me Before You enjoyed a happier start than Claflin’s previous chicklit 
adaptation.Love, Rosie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/love-rosie-review-lily-collins-claflin-romcom>
, based on the Cecelia Ahern novel, kicked off with a disappointing £482,000, 
including £110,000 in previews in 2014. That film was more of a traditional 
romantic comedy, whereas Me Before You is a tragic romantic drama with comedic 
elements. The film’s success follows that of teary teen-cancer romanceThe Fault 
in Our Stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green>
 (2014), which earned £11.4m at the UK box office.

Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass – video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview>
The fact that the Warcraft and Turtles movies played for seven days in the 
reporting period allows easy comparison with films that were already on 
release. Over the same period,Alice Through the Looking Glass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/alice-through-the-looking-glass-review>
 saw its total rise by £4.77m – significantly more than both of the top two 
films in the chart. Alice now stands at £7m after 10 days, a number that looks 
rosier than its anaemic £2.23m opening. Still, the film is way behind the pace 
of its predecessor:Alice in Wonderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review> stood 
at £22.75m at the same stage of its run. Through the Looking Glass is at 31% of 
that figure.

X-Men: Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/x-men-apocalypse-review-marvel-jennifer-lawrence-oscar-isaac>
 also enjoyed a half-term boost, adding £3.72m in the seven days to 5 June – 
more than Warcraft or the Turtles managed over the same period. Apocalypse now 
stands at £15.86m, which is ahead of the lifetime total ofX-Men: First Class 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/x-men-first-class-review> 
(£15.10m) and the first X-Men (£14.98m) as well as 2013’sThe Wolverine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/25/the-wolverine-hugh-jackman-review>
 (£13.77m). These figures are not adjusted for inflation. Apocalypse will soon

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/01/x-men-origins-wolverine-review> 
(£16.38m lifetime).

Declining just 4% from the previous frame, Whit Stillman’s Love & Friendship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/love-friendship-review-whit-stillmans-austen-drama-is-a-racy-delight>
 continues its domination of the arthouse space, with second weekend takings of 
£240,000, and £844,000 after 10 days. That’s more than the lifetime totals of 
Stillman’s previous biggest hits The Last Days of Disco (£619,00) and 
Metropolitan (£516,000) – although both those numbers were achieved at a time 
of significantly lower ticket prices.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/01/russell-crowe-the-nice-guys-ryan-gosling-video-interview>
Helping Love & Friendship was its expansion from 80 to 118 cinemas. Still, a 
screen average above £2,000 in the second week of release is impressive, and 
the film should hold its venues for a third session. It doesn’t face much 
competition for the audience that veers away from mainstream films, unless you 
count Shane Black’sThe Nice Guys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/the-nice-guys-review-russell-crowe-and-ryan-gosling-cannes>
 or Jodie Foster’sMoney Monster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/money-monster-review-george-clooney-jodie-foster-cannes-2016>
 – both playing widely in multiplexes. The Nice Guys opened with just over £1m. 
Black’s Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (2005) grossed £1.71m over the course of its UK 
theatrical run.

The flop

At the foot of our Other openers chart is Misconduct 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/misconduct-review-al-pacino-anthony-hopkins>
, with a very weedy £97 from five cinemas – that’salmost four people per venue. 
It stars Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino, Alice Eve and Malin Åkerman, 
and is the directorial debut of writer/producer Shintaro Shimosawa (The Grudge, 
Grudge 2). The film is available on VOD at iTunes.

 into 28 cinemas at the weekend, grossing £12,454. It also presented the film 
more widely on Sunday, with an innovative “pay what you can” offer. In total, 
43 venues participated, and there were introductions (from actors who had 
appeared in Loach films) at several venues, plus post-screening Q&As (with 
Loach, screenwriter partner Paul Laverty, Versus director Louise Osmond and Kes 
star David Bradley) at others. Takings are still being tallied by Dogwoof.
