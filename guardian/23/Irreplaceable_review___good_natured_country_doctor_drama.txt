There’s something a bit televisual to this French movie about a well-respected 
country doctor with cancer who is advised to take on a student assistant to 
lighten his workload during chemo. Naturally, this assistant is an attractive 
woman with whom he has a prickly relationship. When their car pulls into 
various barnyards, scattering geese, I could almost hear the theme music to the 
BBC’s All Creatures Great and Small. But, despite some cliches, it’s a warm and 
good-natured piece of work, featuring an attractive, humane lead performance by
François Cluzet

as Dr Jean-Pierre Werner, like a younger and more restrained Dustin Hoffman. 
Marianne Denicourt is Nathalie, a former nurse who is taking a midlife 
retraining course as a medical student; a city type who – of course – doesn’t 
at first appreciate the patience and subtlety needed to understand a country 
medical practice. And she certainly doesn’t understand Dr Werner’s reluctance 
to hospitalise a very ill elderly patient. He is suspicious of institutions, 
but could it be that this reluctance is a symptom of denial concerning his own 
condition? Not groundbreaking work, this, but watchable.
