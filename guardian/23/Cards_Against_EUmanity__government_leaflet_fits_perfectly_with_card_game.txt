Even if you are yet to receive the government’s pro-EU leaflet, you’ve 
probably heard about it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/9m-pro-eu-leaflet-is-necessary-and-right-says-cameron>
. But have you noticed how well it fits with the popular board game Cards 
Against Humanity?

The EU and a game known for its political incorrectness don’t seem like the 
most likely bedfellows – yet the minute a leaflet arrived at software engineer 
Jenny Owen’s home, the partnership seemed perfect.

For the uninitiated, this is how the game works: it’s essentially a 
fill-in-the-blanks game <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity> 
where players pick the funniest – and usually, in practice, the rudest – answer 
to win a round.

She told the Guardian: “The EU leaflet just looked so much like Cards Against 
Humanity. Like, the font, the layout, general design. Each page had these big 
statements on the top, like a CAH answer card.

“I thought it would be fun to play at matching the government’s statements up 
with the CAH prompts.”

The result? 

“During sex I like to think about ... the benefits of EU membership.”

“A stronger economy ... that’s why mums go to Iceland.”

“What happens if we leave? MechaHitler.”

Owen told us she’s actually very pro-EU, the whole exercise was just for a bit 
of fun.

She said: “I work with a lot of non-UK European people. I feel strongly that 
we should stay in the EU, so I don’t disagree with the content of the leaflet. 
I like that they were using (admittedly uncited) facts and numbers to convince 
me.
