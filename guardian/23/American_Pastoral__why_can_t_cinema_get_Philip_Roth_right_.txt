American Pastoral and the curse of adapting a literary classic

Poor old Philip Roth <https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth>. Every 
year around this time he must feel just like Graham Greene: another diss from 
the Nobel Committee, and another middling adaptation of one of his novels.

Actually, American Pastoral is the second Roth adaptation of 2016, and, after 
James Schamus’s well-received Indignation, the second best, hands down. The 
merest glance at the calamitous history of Roth adaptations to film 
demonstrates that American Pastoral is keeping up with some pretty old 
traditions in this field. There is miscasting both before and behind the 
camera, here meaning principally director-starEwan McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ewanmcgregor>. McGregor may pass for a Newark 
Jewish sports hero who looks like a blond Viking – “Swede” being his nickname – 
but passing for a gifted director is a whole other story.

As often with Roth, writers are anxious not to step on Big Phil’s toes, so 
they tend – as happens here – to load scads of the author’s exposition into a 
voiceover, which is then boomingly intoned as if it’s unamendable holy writ. 
Here, the honours go to David Strathairn, as Roth’s alter ego Nathan Zuckerman, 
who learns at his 45-year high-school reunion in 1996 that the golden hero of 
his youth, quarterback Swede, is dead.

American Pastoral review: Ewan McGregor no match for Philip Roth

In flashback – because the film-makers caved instantly on every 
Roth-adaptation cliche – we learn of Swede’s dream marriage to Dawn, Miss New 
Jersey 1949 (Jennifer Connolly), one of three deeply unsympathetic female roles 
decanted from Roth’s original. By the late 60s, Swede’s daughter Merry turns 
against everything her parents represent and ends up bombing a post office, 
killing a man, and going underground for decades. The after-effects ruin a 
marriage and pull an American hero apart limb from limb.

There are a couple of things to note. First, this is Philip Roth, and as 
usual, it’s goyim all the way in the casting, with only Peter Riegert, as 
Swede’s garment-industry dad, registering as even slightly New Jersey. Are we 
all out of actual Jewish people? Have we no more Richard Benjamins? Really? And 
second, are we not yet persuaded that Philip Roth novels mostly make for 
terrible, po-faced, unenlightening movies?

I propose a solution to this Rothy impasse. Film-makers should disavow the 
novels and confront the life. Paging Peter Morgan: just as I’d like to see a 
film of Shirley Hazzard’s memoir of Graham Greene (Greene On Capri), I’d rather 
see a movie of Roth’s real-life simultaneous relations with scorned partner 
Claire Bloom and former mistress Janet Hobhouse – talk about bad behaviour! – 
than another of these dopey adaptations.
