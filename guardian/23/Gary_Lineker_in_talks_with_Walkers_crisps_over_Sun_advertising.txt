The star of the Walkers crisps adverts, Gary Lineker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker>, has held talks with the 
brand about its relationship with the Sun newspaper, which has attacked him in 
recent weeks for his views on the refugee crisis.


Lineker <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker> said people would 
have to “wait and see” the outcome of the discussions. But, within hours, 
Walkers appeared to pour cold water on suggestions it would sever ties with the 
paper.


On Friday morning, the former footballer tweeted his support for a campaign 
that seeks to convince firms not to advertise with newspapers who “stir 
hostility”. Stop Funding Hate says the same firms that run adverts featuring 
messages of unity to make bumper profits over Christmas go on to spend that 
money on adverts in papers “with another message” – particularly in respect of 
foreigners and the refugee crisis.

In response to his support for that campaign, Lineker was asked if he would 
speak to Walkers about its own relationship with the Sun. The two have run 
campaigns together in the past.

The broadcaster, who has fronted Walkers’ ads for more than 20 years, said 
“already have”. The outcome? “Wait and see,” he tweeted.

But, on Friday evening, Walkers appeared to play down suggestions the talks 
with Lineker would sway its decision. A spokesperson said: “We have a very 
successful partnership with Gary Lineker and we will continue to do so. Our 
advertising approach is not determined by the editorial stances of individual 
newspapers.”

The former Leicester, Barcelona and Tottenham player was responding to tweets 
from the Daily Mail’s deputy sports editor, James White, who pointed out that 
Walkers has placed coupons in the Sun in the past.

Lineker has faced calls for him to be sacked from Match of the Day – notably 
by the Sun – since last month, when he described the treatment of young 
migrants arriving in the UK as “hideously racist”.


The paper had claimed the BBC was “under pressure to fire” the former 
footballer over his refugee comments but Lineker dismissed the suggestion. 
“Getting a bit of a spanking today, but things could be worse – Imagine, just 
for a second, being a refugee having to flee from your home,” he tweeted.
