The Daily Mirror <https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror> was famous 
for promoting women journalists, such as Marje Proops and Felicity Green. Less 
well known, but just as significant, was Doreen Spooner, reputed to be the 
first female photographer to have a staff job on a popular paper.

Now 88, and almost 30 years after retiring from the Mirror, she has just 
written her autobiography, Camera Girl (an ironic choice of title, as will 
become clear).*

She tells of her various assignments, which included a variety of hard news 
stories, features portraits and fashion shoots.

Spooner was as much at home taking pictures in Northern Ireland during the 
troubles as she was snapping scantily clad models in the studio.

Newspapers were in her blood: her father, Len, was art editor of the Daily 
Herald. After a college course and a brief spell with a photo agency, she 
joined the Mirror in 1949 and soon after won an award for her portrait of 
playwrightGeorge Bernard Shaw <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/bernardshaw> 
at his garden gate.

She left to freelance, first in America and then in Paris. She met and married 
another photographer, Pierre Vandeputte-Manevy, had three children and returned 
to London in the late 1950s.

Marital difficulties, exacerbated by financial problems, persuaded Spooner to 
go back to work and she regained her Mirror position.

It was in the summer of 1963, during the Profumo affair, that she landed her 
first front page scoop, a candid shot ofChristine Keeler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/christine-keeler> and Mandy Rice-Davies in a 
pub before they gave evidence in the trial of Stephen Ward.

She managed to get off just one shot before she realised the landlord had 
spotted her. Before he approached, she removed the film and hid it inside her 
coat.


“I knew in my gut I’d got it,” she told the Sunday Mirror 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-first-female-photographer-broke-9006039>
. “It’s easy to take photos – but so much harder to get ‘the picture’, the 
image that somehow captures the essence of the people in the frame.

“But right there in my lens I’d seen it – Christine Keeler, eyes down, 
fragile, and Mandy Rice-Davies looking straight ahead in a cocky blonde 
beehive. I’d got the contrast of personalities”.

Spooner was also relieved that the byline no longer said, as it had when she 
first joined the paper, “by Camera Girl Doreen Spooner”. She said: “That was a 
bloody cheek. I think they thought it endearing, but I wasn’t having it”.

She also talked of male-dominated Fleet Street being “Testosterone Alley”, 
saying “I like to think I played a small part in changing attitudes – never 
waving a feminist flag, just by getting on with my job...

“The excitement was intoxicating. I loved the buzz involved in creating a 
paper and getting it out to every corner of Britain”.

Among those jobs was coverage of the miners’ strike, the Greenham Common 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/greenham> protests and the Zeebrugge disaster 
in 1987 when the car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, capsized, killing 
193 people.


Spooner took pictures of “poor traumatised people, lying in their hospital 
beds, poleaxed by the horror that had befallen them”.

She is, naturally enough, happier to recall less stressful assignments in 
which she took photos of celebrities. Some, however, were anything but helpful 
subjects.

Albert Einstein <https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein>, for 
instance, “wasn’t a happy bunny”, and Sophia Loren “never cracked a smile”, 
although she looked beautiful all the same.

Several examples of her portfolio can be found here on the Mirror site 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/iconic-images-royals-actors-intellectuals-9012474>
 and alsoon the BBC website <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-37749923>, 
which includes a superb portrait of composer Leonard Bernstein.

Spooner did a great deal of studio work too. According to William Boot 
<http://www.gentlemenranters.com/30.html#spooner>, who may not have been the 
most reliable of sources, a female model once remarked: “You never mind getting 
your kit off for Doreen. It’s like undressing in front of your granny”.
