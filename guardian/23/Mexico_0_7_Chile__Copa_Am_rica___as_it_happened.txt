Final thoughts: A historically bad night for Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> is brought to a merciful close by 
the referee, who elects not to prolong the game into stoppage time.

Mexico, particularly their midfielders, appeared to give up after Chile scored 
first in the second half, and they duly conceded four more to a rampantChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> side who dominated them in every 
key area. When Patrick Vieira’s New York City FC team lost 7-0 to New York Red 
Bulls recently he claimed that it was “better to lose one match 7-0 than seven 
matches 1-0”, but the former Red Bulls manager Juan Carlos Osorio will know all 
too well that his previously unbeaten record as Mexico coach will count for 
nothing amid the inevitable inquests that will now come.

For Chile, they’ve sent a message to a Colombia team yet to find anything like 
the gears Chile found tonight, though Vidal’s suspension and injury worries 
over Diaz and possibly Puch may have taken a little gloss off the evening. But 
their Copa America has ignited — reports of the reigning champions’ demise have 
apparently been greatly exaggerated.

Thanks for joining me tonight, and for your tweets and emails. Sorry I 
couldn’t use them all. Good night!

GOAL! Mexico 0-7 Chile (PUCH!)

Alexi Sanchez surges forward into the box and checks back into a crowd of four 
Mexican defenders. The chance looks to have gone, but the ball breaks to Puch, 
bursting into the box to clip the ball past Ochoa and it’s 7-0!

86 mins: Ochoa does well to save a low shot to his right from Silva. He’s had 
a rough night. Some of the goals were hardly his fault, but “Some of the goals 
were hardly his fault” is not exactly the pull quote you use for the back of 
your autobiography...

That was a decent stop though, with the ball bouncing awkwardly just in front 
of him.

84 mins: The secondary runs of Chilean midfielders have been devastating to 
Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> tonight — especially once 
the game slipped out of reach and the Mexican midfielders stopped bothering 
trying to match them.

More worrying injury news for Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> though, as Puch stretches 
awkwardly, goes down and is now being treated on the sidelines.

82 mins: Chile toying with Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico>
 in their own half at the moment — before finally sending the ball forward for 
Vargas near the byline on the left. He casually rolls it back into the path of 
Vidal, who’s racing into the box at just too fast a clip to control his shot, 
which flies over.

Did you mean the first Vargas goal, Justin? Or the second? Or the third? Or 
the fourth?

I’d say there’s a slight lull now, but Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> don’t really do “lulls”. They’ve 
just stopped scoring for a minute.

GOAL! Mexico 0-6 Chile (VARGAS!)

...Gonzalez’ attempt at a narrow angle shot ends up squirming across the face 
of goal but with two defenders and Ochoa in front of him Vargas refuses to let 
the chance die as he slides in at the far post. He’s first to his feet on the 
rebound, first to position himself, and he shoots high into the net from a 
difficult angle for his fourth goal of the night!

72 mins: Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> have used all 
their subs, so new dad Rafa Marquez will not see the field tonight. Sure he’s 
glad to be missing quality dad time for this.
Mexico working dutifully, if not effectively, to try and at least get on the 
scoresheet, but every time an attack breaks down, red shirts are bursting 
forward.

Final Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> sub now, as Gonzalez 
comes on for Beausejour, who was on a yellow, and will now be safely available

close  
Final thoughts: A historically bad night for Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> is brought to a merciful close by 
the referee, who elects not to prolong the game into stoppage time.

Mexico, particularly their midfielders, appeared to give up after Chile scored 
first in the second half, and they duly conceded four more to a rampantChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> side who dominated them in every 
key area. When Patrick Vieira’s New York City FC team lost 7-0 to New York Red 
Bulls recently he claimed that it was “better to lose one match 7-0 than seven 
matches 1-0”, but the former Red Bulls manager Juan Carlos Osorio will know all 
too well that his previously unbeaten record as Mexico coach will count for 
nothing amid the inevitable inquests that will now come.

For Chile, they’ve sent a message to a Colombia team yet to find anything like 
the gears Chile found tonight, though Vidal’s suspension and injury worries 
over Diaz and possibly Puch may have taken a little gloss off the evening. But 
their Copa America has ignited — reports of the reigning champions’ demise have 
apparently been greatly exaggerated.

Thanks for joining me tonight, and for your tweets and emails. Sorry I 
couldn’t use them all. Good night!
 
Final thoughts in a minute.
 
90 mins: We might not be done yet. Mexico’s players just want to leave. Many 
of their fans already have.
 
Alexi Sanchez surges forward into the box and checks back into a crowd of four 
Mexican defenders. The chance looks to have gone, but the ball breaks to Puch, 
bursting into the box to clip the ball past Ochoa and it’s 7-0!
 
88 mins: Mexico corner. Can they at least get a consolation goal? No. They can 
concede one though...
 
86 mins: Ochoa does well to save a low shot to his right from Silva. He’s had 
a rough night. Some of the goals were hardly his fault, but “Some of the goals 
were hardly his fault” is not exactly the pull quote you use for the back of 
your autobiography...

That was a decent stop though, with the ball bouncing awkwardly just in front 
of him.
 
84 mins: The secondary runs of Chilean midfielders have been devastating to 
Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> tonight — especially once 
the game slipped out of reach and the Mexican midfielders stopped bothering 
trying to match them.

More worrying injury news for Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> though, as Puch stretches 
awkwardly, goes down and is now being treated on the sidelines.
 
82 mins: Chile toying with Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico>
 in their own half at the moment — before finally sending the ball forward for 
Vargas near the byline on the left. He casually rolls it back into the path of 
Vidal, who’s racing into the box at just too fast a clip to control his shot, 
which flies over.
 
80 mins: Justin Kavanagh writes:

“That Vargas goal reminded me of one by Johan Cruyff against Argenttina at the 
‘74 World Cup. Now hopefully someone from Mexico can emulate Maradona in ’86, 
because I think that’s the only way thatMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> will score tonight.”

Did you mean the first Vargas goal, Justin? Or the second? Or the third? Or 
the fourth?

I’d say there’s a slight lull now, but Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> don’t really do “lulls”. They’ve 
just stopped scoring for a minute.
 
78 mins: Chicharito’s shot is blocked just wide, but Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> have neither the ideas or the 
urgency to make anything of the resulting corner and now we go back to 
wondering how many Chile might score tonight.
 
...Gonzalez’ attempt at a narrow angle shot ends up squirming across the face 
of goal but with two defenders and Ochoa in front of him Vargas refuses to let 
the chance die as he slides in at the far post. He’s first to his feet on the 
rebound, first to position himself, and he shoots high into the net from a 
difficult angle for his fourth goal of the night!
 
74 mins: Chile looking for more as Puch sprints into the right side of the box 
before whipping the ball back to Vargas on the edge of the box. His curling 
shot goes just past the post, but he was under no pressure...and...wait for 
it...
 
72 mins: Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> have used all 
their subs, so new dad Rafa Marquez will not see the field tonight. Sure he’s 
glad to be missing quality dad time for this.
Mexico working dutifully, if not effectively, to try and at least get on the 
scoresheet, but every time an attack breaks down, red shirts are bursting 
forward.

Final Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> sub now, as Gonzalez 
comes on for Beausejour, who was on a yellow, and will now be safely available 
for the semi-final.
 
70 mins: Vargas forces a corner out of nothing off Layun when it looked like 
Puch’s cutback to noone had been mopped up.Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> still pressing, at 5-0 and in the 
70th minute.
