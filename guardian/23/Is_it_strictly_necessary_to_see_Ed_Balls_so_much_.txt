It is correct that “the government has already announced a plan to recruit 
2,500 extra prison officers” (Deal raises hopes of end to prisons crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/01/prison-officers-pay-deal-agreed-after-protests>
, 2 December), but that will still leave the service 4,500 short of the 
staffing level it had four years ago. I’m awaiting a reply to a written 
question I have tabled seeking clarification of how many more staff will have 
to be appointed to replace the considerable number expected to leave the 
service in the next five years, believed to be in the region of 5,500.

• While agreeing with the rightness of not putting injured armed services 
personnel and their families through months/years of litigation (Combat related 
compensation could be raised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/01/armed-forces-michael-fallon-pledge-raise-payouts-injury-death-in-combat>
, 2 December), could I additionally suggest there be some mechanism to estimate 
these costsbefore a decision to go to war is made. People are not machines.

think that; I couldn’t possibly comment”, “I was pleased to discover that line 
wasn’t Dobbs, it was me”. That’s odd, because I’m reading House of Cards at the 
moment (Harper, 2015), and on page 99 Urquhart says: “You might say that, 
Mattie. I couldn’t possibly comment.”
