 after the publication of a major report into sexual abuse at the corporation.

Blackburn accused the corporation of making him a scapegoat after he was 
dismissed because his evidence to Dame Janet Smith’s sex abuse inquiry“fell 
short” of the standards demanded

.


A complaint about his sacking escalated from the BBC to the appeals board of 
theBBC Trust <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-trust>, which governs the 
corporation.


The complainant maintained that there were “insufficient grounds” for sacking 
Blackburn which had meant the “loss from the airwaves of a competent, popular 
and entertaining presenter”.


The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Trust backed up the decision 
of the corporation’s own Audience Services department which deemed that the 
complaint had not “raised an issue that justified further investigation”.


Its complaints and appeals board said that said that the complaint was an 
“operational matter”, not one involving a potential breach of the BBC’s 
editorial guidelines that might warrant the BBC Trust’s involvement.


“Trustees agreed that the complainant had received a reasoned and reasonable 
reply from [BBC] Audience Services,” the BBC Trust said. “Trustees decided not 
to take the appeal, on the basis that it would not be appropriate, 
proportionate or cost-effective since there was no reasonable prospect of the 
appeal succeeding.”
