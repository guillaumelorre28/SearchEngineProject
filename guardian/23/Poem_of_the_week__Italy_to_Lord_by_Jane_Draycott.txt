Italy to Lord

It’s dark in here and forest green: Britannica,
sixteen oak trees in a London living room,
the little girl, my mother, in the bookcase glass.
Italy, Ithaca, Izmail, Japan, each page a mainsail,
turning, HMS Discovery – none of the rivers
of southern Italy is of any great importance.


Like birds on a long-haul flight, let not seas
or deserts, cliffs or icy mountain-tops
impede you. Jews, Kabȋr, Kabul, Kaffir,
from up here all seems clear (all evil in the world’s
ascribed to Maya or illusion), then home at last
returned from all those navigable miles


to Lichen, Linnet, Logic, London, to find
a century has passed, the forest’s cleared,
the animals all bared and scorched, the gold
all brought to light. I look into the glass,
discover there myself in dense shade, deep
and shadowy as on any wooded island.


Italy to Lord, the first poem in Jane Draycott’s new collection, The Occupant 
<http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784103002>, makes an apt 
overture. Fulfilling one of its own metaphors, in which “each page” of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica> becomes “a 
mainsail, / turning,HMS Discovery 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Discovery_(1774)>”, Italy to Lord 
anticipates the lexical adventure of the whole poetry collection.


 The pleasure of word-led circumnavigation is a subject to which writers are 
naturally drawn. Draycott, though, has found a refreshingly individual 
approach. Her ultimate emotional focus is a significant human person, “the 
little girl, my mother”, imagined almost spectrally in the mysterious dimness 
of the bookcase glass. Distant, nameless among the many names, the child may be 
playing or hovering near the bookcase, too young to read, or read beyond the 
lettering on the spines, but attracted nonetheless by atmosphere and ambience. 
This Alice in Wonderland-ish world resembles a deep forest, distinguished by 
the “sixteen oak trees” of the (incomplete?) set of encyclopaedias. The 
metaphorical transformation may not be wholly dependent on verbal stimuli, but 
it sets the scene of linguistic empowerment. We’ll meet the speaker in a 
similar setting at the end of the poem.

 Typography is an important factor. The listed entry words – “Italy, Ithaca, 
Izmail, Japan”, for instance, in line four – are not in bold or italic type 
and, as a result, they lose the anorexic look of the signifier to fill out with 
meaning. It’s up to the reader to supply the meanings and associations, though 
the choices provide clues: each of us, to some extent, is his or her own 
lexicographer. At the same time, because of the randomness imparted by 
alphabetical ordering, we are permitted to read as innocently as the 
seven-year-old for whom the new place-name, Ithaca, might feel exciting and 
potent even without any Homeric associations.

 The first piece of information quoted by the poem seems dismissive and its 
positioning may be ironical: “none of the rivers / of southern Italy is of any 
great importance.” In both quotations, the combination of formal grammar, 
italics and good old-fashioned assertiveness suggest a somewhat dated 
historical context, and an awareness that facts can be styles of knowing, 
subject to change.

 The second stanza utters a prayer, primarily for the child but perhaps for 
the speaker and reader, too. Its wish – that there should be no more of an 
impediment to the mental flight than there is to birds migrating across 
difficult terrain – is embodied in the quartet of entry words, “Jews, Kabir, 
Kabul, Kaffir”. India itself does not qualify alphabetically for an entry, but 
the quotation aboutMaya <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(illusion)> 
bridging lines four and five may relate to the entry onKabȋr 
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sok/sok001.htm>. Kabȋr was a radical mystic 
who sought to combine Muslim and Hindu belief systems. Conversely, political 
and religious brutality simmers in such words as “Kabul 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul>” and “Kaffir 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir>”: the word “Jews” is an expanding 
universe of historical complexity. But Draycott’s intensely packed short-list 
seems to invoke neutrality and suppress dissent. It’s almost as if the value of 
the encyclopaedia were perceived as a moral one, expressed in the democracy of 
the alphabet and the impartiality of the definitions.

 There’s no break in the sense between stanzas two and three. The syntax 
curves elegantly to the home stretch of “Lichen, Linnet, Logic, London”. (The 
child has already been located to “a London living room”.) But, as we now 
discover, the journey has crossed time as well as space, and a century has 
passed. There is a different face in the glass. The “little girl” grew up long 
ago and, glancingly, the poem has become her elegy.

 Fine brush strokes summarise the depradations: “the forest’s cleared, / the 
animals all bared and scorched, the gold / all brought to light”. The quick 
shock of those passive verbs “bared and scorched” conveys ecological 
devastation; the reference to the gold resonates as exploitation rather than 
discovery. But these metaphors transpose beautifully to the domestic sphere. A 
family home has been cleaned out of all its treasures. The bookcase has 
suffered deforestation.

 Poetic imagination recovers itself in that Marvellian 
<https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44682> location, 
“dense shade”. A new figure, probably that of the poet-daughter, hovers in the 
glass, a circularity that recalls the etymology of the word “encyclopedia 
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=e&p=13&allowed_in_frame=0>”. The poem’s 
last phrase, “as on any wooded island”, is ambiguous: it need not imply any 
real wooded island. Yet, for post-EU referendum readers, the phrase may conjure 
an enchantment tinged with warning.

Since the Earth-loving sage and poet Kabîr qualifies as the genius loci of 
Draycott’s gentle, subtle and generous poem, I’ll give him the last word:


The jewel is lost in the mud, 
and all are seeking for it; 
Some look for it in the east, 
and some in the west; 
some in the water and some amongst stones. 
But the servant Kabîr has appraised it at its true value, 
and has wrapped it with care 
in the end of the mantle of his heart.
