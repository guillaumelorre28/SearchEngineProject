Once again, a major company folds with a gaping hole in its pension fund (
Former BHS owner agreed not to take cash out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/former-bhs-owner-arcadia-group-agreed-to-protect-business>
, 6 June). Like most people, when paying into my firm’s pension, I assumed all 
the money contributed by employees and the company would be ringfenced in a 
fund kept totally clear of the company to protect against the sort of situation 
now happening with terrible regularity. Why does this not happen. Is it simply 
a lack of political will?

• Muhammad Ali was, as your supplement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali/2016/jun/05/all> (6 June) 
indicates, a great man and sportsman, also a great campaigner for his race. He 
was not, however, the greatest heavyweight world champion ever. This title, 
most certainly, belongs to Rocky Marciano (49 fights, 49 wins, 43 knockouts, 
six successful title defences).

• Your editorial (The bravest of heroes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-muhammad-ali-a-life-of-bravery>
, 6 June) was arguably the most moving piece of prose I have read, and moved 
this hard-bitten, cynical mid-60s white male to tears.

• The lane across the small market town of Narberth in Pembrokeshire is known 
as The Drang (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/05/the-tenfoot-a-place-to-bool-ones-tansad>
, 6 June). I had supposed it to be local to Pembrokeshire and an internet 
search suggested a handful of others in the county, although I was aware of no 
other when I lived in the town for almost 20 years. My search also indicated 
that drang is used in the West Country and Newfoundland, but shed no light on 
the origins of the word.
