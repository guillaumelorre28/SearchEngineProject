where it has invested more than in Germany, France and Italy combined in recent 
years.

real estate to banks and football clubs according to figures from the American 
Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.

Alongside the low-key property deals, Chinese companies have also struck deals 
to buy a string of household names over the past few years.
