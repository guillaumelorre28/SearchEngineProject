The winner: Doctor Strange

Disney-Marvel’s strategy of creating film franchises beyond its core Avengers 
group of characters has achieved its latest success with the release ofDoctor 
Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/doctor-strange-review-benedict-cumberbatch-marvel-eyepoppingly-freaky-extravaganza>
, starringBenedict Cumberbatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch>. A UK debut of 
£5.49m at the weekend and £9.29m including three days of previews represents a 
robustly encouraging result. While below the opening numbers of recent Avengers 
films, it compares favourably toAnt-Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-marvel>
’s debut of £4.01m in July last year, and is also better thanGuardians of the 
Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes>
’s initial £4.99m plus £1.37m in previews in 2014.

Marvel and parent Disney have significantly expanded the range of stories and 
genres that work within the brand. While Marvel has long straddled comedy and 
science fiction, Guardians of the Galaxy pushed it further in that direction. 
NowDoctor Strange <https://www.theguardian.com/film/doctor-strange> takes the 
action into a cosmic realm of astral projection, time loops and alternate 
dimensions.

Doctor Strange: trailer for film starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Marvel’s 
Sorcerer Supreme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/13/marvel-doctor-strange-benedict-cumberbatch-sorcerer-supreme-video>
Boosted by the half-term holiday last week, Doctor Strange exceeded £1m box 
office every day of release. The film should have no problem exceeding 
Ant-Man’s £16.3m and may approach Guardians of the Galaxy’s £28.5m. 
Cumberbatch’s previous best as a lead actor wasThe Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/the-imitation-game-review-cumberbatch-turing>
, with £16.4m.

The indie hit: I, Daniel Blake

Boosted in part by an expansion from 94 to 211 cinemas, I, Daniel Blake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving>
 rises 18% from the previous weekend, for a 10-day total of £1.33m. There were 
significant individual successes at key venues – takings went up at Manchester 
HOME – and they barely dipped at other core indie sites. Tyneside Cinema 
delivered another stellar result, aided by the film’s local setting.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/i-daniel-blake-trailer-ken-loach-palme-dor-winner-video>
I, Daniel Blake has set a faster pace than any previous Ken Loach film. The 
Wind That Shakes the Barley <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/23/3> 
– Loach’s biggest UK hit – stood at £1.16m at this stage of its run. That film 
was boosted by huge numbers in Ireland, which is treated as part of a single 
reporting territory with the UK. It went on to a whopping lifetime gross of 
£3.91m. Loach’s second biggest UK hit,The Angels’ Share 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/31/the-angels-share-review>, reached 
£1.98m, boosted by a stellar result in Scotland.

Top indie challengers were the relatively modest Train to Busan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/train-to-busan-review-korean-zombie-thriller-yeon-sang-ho>
 (£38,000 including previews),After Love

 (£23,000) and Werner Herzog’sLo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/lo-and-behold-reveries-of-the-connected-world-review-herzogs-wild-ride-through-the-web>
 (£20,000 plus £51,000 in previews). Already on release areQueen of Katwe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/queen-of-katwe-review-mira-nair-chess-phiona-mutesi-lupita-nyong-o>
 (£37,000 at the weekend),My Scientology Movie

 (£32,000) andAmerican Honey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold>
 (£25,000). I, Daniel Blake grossed £476,000 over the weekend period. The film 
led theBritish independent film awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/01/i-daniel-blake-leads-british-independent-film-award-nominations-bifa-ken-loach>
 nominations announced this week, with seven nods.

The phenomenon: Bridget Jones’s Baby

It’s official: Bridget Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 is now the biggest grossing film of 2016 at UK cinemas. Although it ended the 
weekend with £46.17m, just behindThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review>’s 
£46.19m, Monday’s takings pushed Bridget to £46.27m. Other top titles this year 
includeFinding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
 (£42.6m),Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
 (£37.9m),Captain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 (£37.0m) andBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill>
 (£36.6m). Not many would have predicted that the revival of Working Title’s 
Bridget Jones franchise would gross £10m more here than the year’s big 
superhero smackdowns from Marvel and DC.

The Diwali hit: Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

The Diwali festival invariably brings a major Bollywood release to cinemas, 
and in 2016 it wasAe Dil Hai Mushkil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/28/ae-dil-hai-mushkil-review-karan-johar-fawad-khan>
, from director Karan Johar (Shah Rukh Khan hits such asKabhi Khushi Kabhie 
Gham … <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248126/> and My Name Is Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/12/india>). Johar’s latest film 
reteamsBombay Velvet <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2979920/>’s Ranbir Kapoor and 
Anushka Sharma, adding Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (probably best known in the UK 
for Gurinder Chadha’sBride and Prejudice <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361411/>
). Romantic dramaAi Dil Hai Mushkil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/mumbai-police-vow-to-protect-cinemas-showing-film-with-pakistani-actor>
 (rough English translation: Oh my dear heart, it’s tough) has opened with 
£617,000 from 132 cinemas, delivering a good average of £4,677.

Ai Dil Hai Mushkil has delivered the biggest debut for a Bollywood film this 
year – as long as previews are discounted from the opening tally of July release
Sultan <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832640/?ref_=nv_sr_1>. That Salman Khan 
starrer began with £603,000 plus hefty previews of £445,000, for a combined 
£1.05m. For Diwali last year, top Bollywood titlePrem Ratan Dhan Payo

, starring Salman Khan and Sonam Kapoor, opened with £725,000 plus previews of 
£187,000.

Spreading the wealth

For only the second time this year, all films in the UK Top 10 took at least 
£500,000. With £532,000,Ouija: Origin of Evil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/18/ouija-origin-of-evil-review> 
achieved the highest gross for a 10th-placed film since early January 2015, when
Annie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/16/annie-review-pink-sparkly-radioactive-waste>
 found itself in 10th place in its third week of release, grossing £628,000.

Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/27/michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander-light-between-oceans-video-interview>
The arrival of Doctor Strange helped UK box office rise 21% on the previous 
frame. Compared to the equivalent weekend in 2015, however, it’s a huge drop of 
59% – because that session saw the arrival ofSpectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden>
, which delivered a mammoth £41.3m including previews. Cinemas have already 
made adjustments to their programmes to make way for the arrival today ofThe 
Light Between Oceans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/the-light-between-oceans-review-michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander>
, the romantic literary adaptation starring Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander 
and Rachel Weisz. From Friday, they will also be accommodating Tom Ford’s 
acclaimedNocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale>
, starring Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, The Accountant, a thriller starring 
Ben Affleck, and A Street Cat Named Bob, adapted from the bestselling memoir by 
James Bowen.
