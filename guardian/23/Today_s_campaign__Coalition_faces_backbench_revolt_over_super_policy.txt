The government may have seized on the latest growth figures released yesterday 
as proof of its strong economic management – the release of the national 
accounts data revealed some of the strongest growth figures in four years.


But the issue of superannuation remains an ongoing headache for the 
government, and no doubt we’ll be hearing more about that today. Changes to the 
Coalition’s superannuation policy could be made if the government is 
re-elected, a policy which senior ministers have struggled to explain this week.

The finance minister minister, Mathias Cormann, is playing down reports this 
morning that political party donors are threatening to withhold donations over 
the policy.

The big picture

Aspects of the Coalition’s confusing superannuation policy may be changed or 
abolished after the election, reports say this morning.

Two senior ministers – Julie Bishop and Josh Frydenberg – this week struggled 
to explain the superannuation policy measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/31/turnbull-backs-bishop-after-gotcha-moment-on-superannuation>
, prompting cabinet secretary,Arthur Sinodinos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/arthur-sinodinos>, to commit the 
government to take the superannuation policy back to the party room.

Gabrielle Chan writes that Sinodinos said the Coalition was open to changes to 
superannuation measures after the election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/01/superannuation-transition-to-retirement-julie-bishop-gotcha-moment>
, while claiming the government would have a clear mandate to implement the 
changes if they win:

The superannuation changes were part of the budget so they were presented to 
the party room before the budget was handed down to the parliament,” he said.

“The next process will be if we win the election there will be consultations 
on various changes and then legislation presented to the party room.”

In an interview on Sky  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/01/australian-election-2016-bill-shorten-malcolm-turnbull-campaign-politics-live>
 including Labor’sJoel Fitzgibbon, Sinodinos said no fellow MPs had rung to 
urge the government to change the superannuation measures.

He confirmed the “transition to retirement” policy was not presented to the 
party room specifically – it was part of the whole budget package.

“If we win the election, we would have a mandate to implement our 
superannuation changes and that’s what we’ll put up to the parliament,” 
Sinodinos said.

“So you’ll have a mandate to implement the thing you are going to consult on 
after the election Arthur?” asked Fitzgibbon.


Sinodinos said there would be consultations on “subsidiary matters” but denied 
it was around the start date of the superannuation measures.

Meanwhile, Phillip Coorey writes 
<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election-2016-goverment-faces-super-push-after-election-20160531-gp8nrt>
 for the Financial Review that Turnbull andScott Morrison will face pressure 
from the backbench to change or even abolish elements of the superannuation 
overhaul, should it win the election.

In a separate report, he writes that a re-elected Turnbull government would 
also struggle to pass a 10-year plan to cut the company tax rate to 25% through 
the Senate.

All those likely to hold the balance of power are opposed to some or all of 
the package,Coorey explains 
<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election-2016-company-tax-cuts-will-struggle-to-pass-senate-20160531-gp8nqn#ixzz4AMHeFehP>
:

 The Greens confirmed their opposition to the entirety of the tax cuts with 
the release of costings by the Parliamentary Budget Office which estimated the 
cost of the cuts over a decade would be $51 billion.


While just $3 billion different from the $48.2 billion Treasury estimated for 
the government, Greens treasury spokesmanAdam Bandt, who commissioned the PBO 
modelling, called it “a death blow to the argument that company tax cuts are 
affordable”.

Labor, if it loses the election, will also have the numbers to pass the tax 
cuts through the Senate, but will only support lowering from 28.5% to 27.5% 
rate for businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million, which is just a 
fraction of the package.

Nick Xenophon, who is expected to add to his Senate numbers at the election, 
will be critical to any negotiation when Labor and the Greens are opposed. But 
he said on Wednesday his support for the package was limited.

Senator Xenophon, whose home town of Adelaide will be hit hard next year by 
the closure of General Motors Holden, would only guarantee supporting a lower 
rate for companies with a turnover of up to $10 million.

Meanwhile, an electorate-by-electorate breakdown of economic growth for 
Fairfax Media, conducted by SGS Economics & Planning, shows slowing economic 
activity in 30 of the country’s 150 parliamentary seats.Fairfax reports 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-australia-divided-on-gdp-as-30-electorates-go-backwards-20160601-gp970o.html#ixzz4AMMI1yuH>
:

 A surge in mining exports has delivered the fastest economic growth in the 
life of the Coalition government, but has left much of Australia going 
backwards.


In parts of Queensland and Western Australia, the economy is shrinking by as 
much as 2% per year. At the other end of the scale, in parts of Sydney and 
remote Western Australia, the economy is growing by 5% or more per year.


Nine of the 10 fastest-growing electorates are held by the Coalition.
The results, for each of Australia’s 150 electorates, show economic activity 
growing at more than 5% per annum in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne 
but going backwards in western and south-western Sydney seats such as 
Parramatta, Fowler, McMahon, Chifley and Werriwa. All are held by Labor.

In outer Melbourne, Corio and Corangamite are going backwards. Corio is held 
by Labor and Corangamite is held by the Coalition’s Sarah Henderson even though 
a redistribution makes it marginally Labor.

On the campaign trail

Turnbull will continue campaigning in Sydney, with innovation a central theme.

Shorten will also be in Sydney today where he will announce Labor’s policy to 
drive investment in renewable energy to reduce household power costs and create 
jobs.

Labor wants 50% of all energy to be renewable by 2030. Shorten will announce a 
policy to sign 10-15 year power purchase agreements with energy companies, 
forcing the purchase of the same amount of renewable energy as half of the 
commonwealth’s power usage.

The campaign you should be watching

The ABC has examined the electorate 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-01/barton-highway-residents-shocked-by-lack-of-funding/7465530>
 of Eden-Monaro, and writes that residents along the Barton Highway are calling 
on both the government and opposition to commit to funding the road’s 
duplication in the coming federal election. It’s a marginal Liberal seat that 
has been held by Peter Hendy since 2013. The ABC reports:

 Earlier this week federal Labor announced a funding boost of more than $6m 
that would go towards planning roads in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, but the 
Barton Highway was left off the list.


Sophie Wade, from the Barton Highway Community Action Group, said the road was 
a key issue for voters.

“I’m quite shocked, I can’t believe the Barton Highway doesn’t rate a mention, 
it’s a critical piece of infrastructure in this electorate, and the safety 
issues need to be addressed urgently,” she said.

And another thing(s)

Conservative South Australian Liberal senator Cory Bernadi has defended using 
his blog to link to an article by a controversial “pick-up artist” whose views 
have been condemned around the world.

Calla Wahlquist writes that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/01/cory-bernardi-defends-linking-to-article-by-neo-masculinist-roosh-v>
 “Bernardi offered the article with the preface “know thyself”, to which the 
internet responded with variations of “know thy source”.

Bernardi shared the article with his 17,000 Twitter followers on Wednesday, 
saying it was “particularly relevant to many Twitter users”.

The article was a lengthy missive against “social justice warriors” and warned 
the readers, assumed to be white heterosexual men, against attacks from those 
who find their statements offensive.

The author, Daryush Valizadeh, who uses the moniker Roosh V online, is best 
known for an article – which he said was “satirical” – that argued rape should 
be legal on private property.

He was monitored by the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, in February, after 
suggesting he would come to Australia to attend a series of men-only “tribal 
meetings” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/02/controversial-neo-masculinist-daryush-valizadeh-claims-he-can-enter-australia-with-no-visa>
 for supporters of his website, Return of Kings.

Unfortunately, Valizadeh has seized on Bernadi’s linking to him, using Twitter 
to boast about the outrage it has created. I’m not going to link to that tweet, 
because Valizadeh doesn’t deserve that.
Cory Bernardi (@corybernardi) 
Dear outraged, the article I linked to is interesting in light of events of 
last week. It doesn't mean I endorse author's other views.
