Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> will use events at 
Aintree tomorrow to announce a general election manifesto pledge to oblige 
overseas bookmakers to pay the horserace betting levy.

With the eyes – and the wallets – of the nation on the Grand National, the 
party will announce its commitment to prevent British bookies moving offices 
offshore to circumvent the annual payment that is the sport's lifeblood.

Figures released last year, when William Hill and Ladbrokes' online operations 
moved offshore, coincided with a 20% drop in the British Horserace Betting Levy 
Board's overall receipts. The total impact attributable to Hill's and 
Ladbrokes' move was estimated to be £4.2m.

Gerry Sutcliffe, the sports minister, announced in January his intention to 
introduce the policy to the statute book before the election. But, with the 
election having been called for 6 May, time has run out for the government to 
introduce the measure as law, although Sutcliffe has previously stressed how 
important the move is.

"Of course it's right that all operators pay, wherever they are," Sutcliffe 
said in January. "Offshore operators have been getting away with it for too 
long and racing has taken a considerable hit to its Levy income. It has also 
had the ever-present threat of more moves offshore with potentially severe 
consequences."

Although refusing to confirm whether the matter will make it into the 
manifesto, the Conservative party said it has already welcomed the proposal. 
However, describing the Levy as "outdated", a spokesman added: "A Conservative 
government [would be] determined to find a commercially viable alternative, 
which works for everyone."
