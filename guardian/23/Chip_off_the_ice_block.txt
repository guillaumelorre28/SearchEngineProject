You don't have to head Arctic-wards to find an icy bolthole this winter; 
instead snuggle up in an igloo just two hours' drive from Barcelona. The 
Pyrenean resort of Grand Valira in Andorra is to get its first icy 
accommodation for tourists this winter, when the Iglu-Dorf chain - which 
already runs igloo developments in five Swiss ski resorts - opens a snow palace 
to cater for up to 26 guests - complete with fur-covered beds and an après-ski 
bar - at 2,300m.
