The company that operates the national broadband network has downplayed new 
findings on global internet speeds that show Australia continues to lag behind 
other Asia-Pacific countries.

Akamai released its third-quarter “State of the Internet” connectivity report 
<https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q3-2016-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report.pdf>
, acknowledged as a benchmark for broadband performance within the industry, on 
Thursday.

Australia ranked 50th in the global rankings for average connection speed, and 
eighth among Asia-Pacific countries and regions, with an average of 9.6Mbps for 
the third quarter this year – a decline of 13% on the previous quarter.

South Korea and Hong Kong were at first and second in the world, with 26.3Mbps 
and 20.1Mbps respectively.

Average connection speeds globally had increased by 2.3% to 6.3Mbps, a 21% 
increase year-over-year.

Australia’s average peak connection speed was 46.9Mbps, putting it at 57th in 
the world, and far behind leaders in the Asia-Pacific region such as Singapore 
– with the highest peak speed of the countries assessed of 162.0Mbps.

With Japan, Australia had the smallest gains year-over-year of countries 
within the Asia-Pacific in the third quarter, at just 12%. By comparison, 
Indonesia’s speeds increased by 220%. But third-quarter average mobile 
connections in Australia were 12.8Mbps, behind only the Philippines in the 
Asia-Pacific region.

The Akamai report said the NBN was on track to roll out universal broadband 
access in Australia at a minimum speed of 25Mbps, with 40% of the country 
having gigabit-speed access by 2020.

A spokeswoman for the national broadband network agreed that the findings 
reflected the need to bridge the digital divide in Australia, but said most of 
the 10m IP addresses assessed by Akamai would be “legacy ADSL services” and 
were not a reflection on the NBN.

The speed experienced by consumers would be ultimately dictated by their 
choice of package from internet service providers, she said. “Consumers may 
choose a 12Mbps package and that what would be what is measured, not what the 
line is capable of doing.”

She also noted that Australia’s average speeds had increased year-over-year.

Some 1.6m premises around Australia now have NBN services. 

Internet <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet> Australia, the 
not-for-profit peak body representing the interests of Australian internet 
users, said the mix of technologies being used in the NBN meant it could not 
guarantee the speeds that would be delivered to all consumers.

Between 30% and 40% of premises using the NBN will be serviced by 
“fibre-to-the-node”, which IA’s chief executive, Laurie Patton, says will not 
meet Australia’s future needs, given the fact that ageing copper-wire fibres 
will need replacing in 10 to 15 years’ time.

“The simple fact is we are being outplayed by our global competitors who are 
building fibre-based systems providing speeds that cannot be matched by 
fibre-to-the-node,” he said.

“The wholesale speeds claimed by NBN are largely irrelevant as they are not 
necessarily the speeds that will be delivered to consumers. What counts is what 
you pay for and what you get.”

IA has been calling for the NBN to dump the fibre-to-the-node rollout in 
favour of the “fibre-to-the-home” approachinitially committed to by Kevin 
Rudd’s government

 before being watered down by the Abbott-led government.

The annual cost to the federal budget of the government’s investment in the 
NBN is expected to grow in coming years.

A report by the Parliamentary Budget Office released on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/annual-cost-of-nbn-to-rise-to-21bn-by-2017-says-budget-office>
 estimated the cost to the budget in 2016-17 to be about $580m.
