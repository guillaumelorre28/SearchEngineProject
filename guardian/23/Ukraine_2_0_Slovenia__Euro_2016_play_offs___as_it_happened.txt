Well Ukraine deserve their lead going into the second leg on Tuesday, but 
there was actually enough in that game to suggest some sort of encouragement for
Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>. The way Ukraine 
seemed to back off towards the end was mildly concerning from their point of 
view, even if they were pretty safe with their 2-0 lead. Yarmolenko was the 
primary danger, with Konoplyanka chipping in from the other flank.

Cheers for reading - we’ll have Sweden v Denmark for you shortly. 

Andriy Yarmolenko gives Ukraine solid play-off lead against Slovenia

90 mins: Great chance for Konoplyanka, running at pace at the Slovenian 
defence who look absolutely terrified of him, but the finish is poor and is 
skewed wide.

87 mins: Jokic clips a cross to the back stick, but Novakovic stumbles and

85 mins: Shevchuk concedes a throw, but has an absolutely sensational, toys 
out of the pram, kid who doesn’t want to eat his greens tantrum on the 
touchline. He jumped up and down and everything.

force something with a counter attack. Cynical, but he still complains.

82 mins: Pyatov and Fedetskiy almost get into a frightful pickle in defence, 
but eventuallyUkraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> get the 
ball clear, Yarmolenko dashes into attack and squares the ball to Malinovsky, 
who lines up a shot but it’s low and without power, and Handanovic saves.

81 mins: Ukraine have gone a little flat in the last ten minutes or so. Like 
they’re perfectly happy with the 2-0 but aren’t quite sure how to defend it 
properly. Their fluidity from earlier has gone, and if they’re not careful some 
of that uncertainty in defence might bite them.

78 mins: A bit of pressure now from Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, with a cross from the left 
causing a moment of disquiet in the Ukraine defence, but nothing much more than 
that. Ukraine try to counter with a big, booming ball downfield to Yarmolenko, 
but his first touch, on his chest, is too heavy and the attack breaks down.

77 mins: Slovenia win a free-kick, and after nearly a minute of arguing like a

the cross with some ease.

73 mins: Another change for Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, and Birsa comes off, replaced 
by Nejc Pecnik. And, shall we say, it doesn’t look like Birsa necessarily 
agrees with the decision and lets the coach know, with some gusto.

72 mins: Ukraine work a corner short, and after a little while of what can 
only be described as ‘titting about’ from Yarmolenko, the ball loops over into 
the box and falls to Khacheridi, who volleys over the bar.

69 mins: And that really should be three. Seleznyov finds himself away in the 
left channel in space, space, space and he has time to pick his spot, but his 
effort thunks against the post and is put behind for a corner. The striker then 
looks as if he’s going to burst into tears at the cruel unfairness of it all.

then springs back to life when the half-cleared ball looks like it’s going to

63 mins: A change for Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>
, and interestingly it’s Josip Ilicic coming off, replaced by Roman Bezjak. We 
can expect some freaky dancing, presumably.

62 mins: Seleznyov is lucky not to be booked after knocking away an attempted 
clearance with his hands, like a rugby player charging down a kick from a 
full-back.

60 mins: Ukraine flow forwards again. More goals in this one, you’d think. A 
Klitschko brother is in the crowd - not sure which one. The one that’s big and 
looks mean. You know who I mean.

58 mins: Ukraine should be three up. They counter through Konoplyanka down the 
left, he squares to Fedetskiy who clips a cross to the back post where Garmash 
is waiting, he heads powerfully at goal but Handanovic just manages to get a 
hand in the way. It rebounds to Seleznyov but he handles the ball, and the 
chance goes. Garmash really, really should have scored that - a downward header 
would’ve done the trick.

54 mins: Beautiful play by Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine>. Yarmolenko slips the ball 
between the left- back and centre-half for Fedetskiy barreling forwards from 
right-back, he plays across for Seleznyov who slides the ball into the empty 
net. He looks around for the linesman’s flag, which doesn’t go up but it 
probably should have, with the striker just in front of the ball when it was 
played. Tight, but probably a mistake there.

53 mins: Slovenia seem to be paying a bit more attention to Yarmolenko in this 
half, which seems sensible. He gets the ball on the right, but is doubled up on 
by Kampl and Jokic, then a few moments later by Birsa and Jokic.

a shot asUkraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> defenders back,

48 mins: Co-commentator Garry Birtles has been complaining like someone’s 
grandpa about how soft players are these days, “the game’s gone” etc, and after 
another of these whines, following an admittedly suspect free-kick awarded to
Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, the commentator 
rather wearily notes “That’s not the last time you’ll hear Garry Birtles say 
‘the game’s gone.’” Poor bloke.

Splendid old affair, this. Ukraine deserve their lead, but there are enough 
iffy moments in their defence to suggest thatSlovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia> still have a more than solid 
chance of nicking something. Plus, there’s enough needle to suggest that these 
two don’t like each other. Lovely stuff.
 Ukraine’s goalscorer Andriy Yarmolenko happily displays his passion.

the arm somewhat when going for a header with Sydorchuk, but the man with the

39 mins: Konoplyanka manages a decent corner from the left, curling and 
fizzing one into the near-post, where Garmash gets a head to it but Handanovic 
almost nonchalantly flips it over the bar, like a man absent-mindedly plucking 
a rogue leaf from a branch while walking past a tree.

Well Ukraine deserve their lead going into the second leg on Tuesday, but 
there was actually enough in that game to suggest some sort of encouragement for
Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>. The way Ukraine 
seemed to back off towards the end was mildly concerning from their point of 
view, even if they were pretty safe with their 2-0 lead. Yarmolenko was the 
primary danger, with Konoplyanka chipping in from the other flank.

Cheers for reading - we’ll have Sweden v Denmark for you shortly.

...but the corner comes to nothing, and it’s all over.
 
90 mins +3: Last chance for Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, as they toss a free-kick from 
deep into the area, but it goes behind and a corner is somewhat dubiously 
awarded...
 
90 mins + 1: Changes for both teams - Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia> bring Zlatan Ljubijankič on for 
Novakovic, while Ukraine withdraw Yarmolenko in favour of Karavayev. Three 
minutes of added time to come.
 
90 mins: Great chance for Konoplyanka, running at pace at the Slovenian 
defence who look absolutely terrified of him, but the finish is poor and is 
skewed wide.
 
89 mins: The crowd start singing the Ukraine national anthem. The Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> president, in the crowd and who 
has waved his country’s flag around like a frantic cheerleader after both 
goals, stands and joins them, hand over heart.
 
87 mins: Jokic clips a cross to the back stick, but Novakovic stumbles and 
tumbles before he can get to it. He half claims a foul, but nothing doing there.
 
85 mins: Shevchuk concedes a throw, but has an absolutely sensational, toys 
out of the pram, kid who doesn’t want to eat his greens tantrum on the 
touchline. He jumped up and down and everything.
 
84 mins: Booking for Rakitskiy, who takes out Pecnik as the Slovenian tries to 
force something with a counter attack. Cynical, but he still complains.
 
83 mins: Sub for Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> - 
Seleznyov comes of, and Artem Kravets is on.
 
82 mins: Pyatov and Fedetskiy almost get into a frightful pickle in defence, 
but eventuallyUkraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> get the 
ball clear, Yarmolenko dashes into attack and squares the ball to Malinovsky, 
who lines up a shot but it’s low and without power, and Handanovic saves.
 
81 mins: Ukraine have gone a little flat in the last ten minutes or so. Like 
they’re perfectly happy with the 2-0 but aren’t quite sure how to defend it 
properly. Their fluidity from earlier has gone, and if they’re not careful some 
of that uncertainty in defence might bite them.
 
80 mins: Sub for Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> - 
Garmash is off, and Ruslan Malinovsky is on in his place.
 
78 mins: A bit of pressure now from Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, with a cross from the left 
causing a moment of disquiet in the Ukraine defence, but nothing much more than 
that. Ukraine try to counter with a big, booming ball downfield to Yarmolenko, 
but his first touch, on his chest, is too heavy and the attack breaks down.
 
77 mins: Slovenia win a free-kick, and after nearly a minute of arguing like a 
collection of children, it’s all something of an anti-climax as Pyatov claims 
the cross with some ease.
 
74 mins: Half chance for Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, as Kampl works some space on 
the left and clips it inside to Jokic in the area, but his shot flies way over.

73 mins: Another change for Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, and Birsa comes off, replaced 
by Nejc Pecnik. And, shall we say, it doesn’t look like Birsa necessarily 
agrees with the decision and lets the coach know, with some gusto.
 
72 mins: Ukraine work a corner short, and after a little while of what can 
only be described as ‘titting about’ from Yarmolenko, the ball loops over into 
the box and falls to Khacheridi, who volleys over the bar.
 
69 mins: And that really should be three. Seleznyov finds himself away in the 
left channel in space, space, space and he has time to pick his spot, but his 
effort thunks against the post and is put behind for a corner. The striker then 
looks as if he’s going to burst into tears at the cruel unfairness of it all. 
Football, this game, life...
 
67 mins: Unfortunate moment as a stray boot from Kurtic goes straight into 
Rybalka’s, well....his balls. Ouch.
 
66 mins: Chance for Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine>, as 
a free kick is thrown into the box but Seleznyov goes down for reasons unclear, 
then springs back to life when the half-cleared ball looks like it’s going to 
come back into the box.
 
63 mins: A change for Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>
, and interestingly it’s Josip Ilicic coming off, replaced by Roman Bezjak. We 
can expect some freaky dancing, presumably.
 
62 mins: Seleznyov is lucky not to be booked after knocking away an attempted 
clearance with his hands, like a rugby player charging down a kick from a 
full-back.
 
60 mins: Ukraine flow forwards again. More goals in this one, you’d think. A 
Klitschko brother is in the crowd - not sure which one. The one that’s big and 
looks mean. You know who I mean.
 
58 mins: Ukraine should be three up. They counter through Konoplyanka down the 
left, he squares to Fedetskiy who clips a cross to the back post where Garmash 
is waiting, he heads powerfully at goal but Handanovic just manages to get a 
hand in the way. It rebounds to Seleznyov but he handles the ball, and the 
chance goes. Garmash really, really should have scored that - a downward header 
would’ve done the trick.
 
57 mins: Slovenia try to get back into the game straight away through Kampl on 
the left, but he struggles to create anything.
 
54 mins: Beautiful play by Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine>. Yarmolenko slips the ball 
between the left- back and centre-half for Fedetskiy barreling forwards from 
right-back, he plays across for Seleznyov who slides the ball into the empty 
net. He looks around for the linesman’s flag, which doesn’t go up but it 
probably should have, with the striker just in front of the ball when it was 
played. Tight, but probably a mistake there.
 
Again, a lovely move and that should be that for tonight.

53 mins: Slovenia seem to be paying a bit more attention to Yarmolenko in this 
half, which seems sensible. He gets the ball on the right, but is doubled up on 
by Kampl and Jokic, then a few moments later by Birsa and Jokic.
 
51 mins: Mexican wave. Take it all back Mr Birtles, the game has indeed gone. 
 
50 mins: Slovenia build a promising attack, and Kurtic has the ball through 
the middle, with space suddenly opening up in front of him to line up and take 
a shot asUkraine <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> defenders back, 
back, back off, but the effort he tries is skewed massively wide.
 
48 mins: Co-commentator Garry Birtles has been complaining like someone’s 
grandpa about how soft players are these days, “the game’s gone” etc, and after 
another of these whines, following an admittedly suspect free-kick awarded to
Slovenia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia>, the commentator 
rather wearily notes “That’s not the last time you’ll hear Garry Birtles say 
‘the game’s gone.’” Poor bloke.
 
46 mins: The second half, it is underway. Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> get us started, and it’s a 
scrappy first minute, with neither team managing to hold onto the thing for 
more than a couple of touches/passes.
 
Splendid old affair, this. Ukraine deserve their lead, but there are enough 
iffy moments in their defence to suggest thatSlovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia> still have a more than solid 
chance of nicking something. Plus, there’s enough needle to suggest that these 
two don’t like each other. Lovely stuff.

Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: Another situation for the referee to deal with, as Jokic leads with 
the arm somewhat when going for a header with Sydorchuk, but the man with the 
whistle settles for a word withSlovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia> captain Cesar. One minute of 
injury time to be added.
 
44 mins: A minute or so after Seleznyov embarrasses himself by backing into a 
defender and throwing himself forwards, trying to get his opponent booked, 
Krhin does receive a yellow for tugging the shirt of theUkraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ukraine> forward.

41 mins: Novakovic is very nearly in, as Slovenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/slovenia> launch a counter, Khacheridi 
doesn’t deal with a ball over the top but Rakitskiy does well to swoop in, 
snuff out the danger and save his pal’s bacon.
 
39 mins: Konoplyanka manages a decent corner from the left, curling and 
fizzing one into the near-post, where Garmash gets a head to it but Handanovic 
almost nonchalantly flips it over the bar, like a man absent-mindedly plucking 
a rogue leaf from a branch while walking past a tree.
