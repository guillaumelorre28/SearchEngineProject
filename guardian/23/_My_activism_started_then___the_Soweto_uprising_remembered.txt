For many South Africans looking back on the events of 16 June 1976, when 
police brutally attacked thousands of protesting school children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/soweto-uprising-40-years-on-hector-pieterson-image-shocked-the-world>
, the day marked the beginning of the end of the apartheid system.


The uprising began as students came together against a decree that all pupils 
must learn Afrikaans in school. As historian Julian Brown, the author of anew 
study, The Road to Soweto 
<http://www.jacana.co.za/upcoming-events-53274/2307-julian-brown-launches-the-road-to-soweto-resistance-and-the-uprising-of-16-june-1976>
, says: “These crowds were not coordinated by any national political body. They 
were the product of local tensions. They constituted new efforts to remake 
South Africa’s democracy from the ground up.”

To commemorate 40 years since the uprising and the violence against peaceful 
protesters that followed,we asked Guardian readers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/soweto-uprising-16-june-share-experiences-pictures-perspectives>
 to share their memories with us. From protesters to reporters to radical 
teachers, we heard from an array of people who were there that day, and shared 
moving accounts with us. Alongside them, we are also publishingthe accounts of 
survivors

I had no idea what was going on. I was a young student and did not understand 
politics. I followed older students I knew and we all began marching towards 
town. Immediately after reaching Vincent Road we were met by police who arrived 
in large ‘hippos’ [armoured vehicles] and began firing live ammunition and tear 
gas.

The protester

My name is Phumla Williams I was born in Pimville, Soweto. I was brought up by 
a single parent who worked as a domestic worker, and I later became an 
assistant nurse in a clinic in Soweto.


In June 1976, I was 16 years old and a student in Musi High School. On the 
16th, when the student uprising started in Orlando, our school was still having 
normal classes. In fact, on that day, I was writing my half-yearly test of the 
Afrikaans paper.

The students crossed Soweto and protested over night. On the 17 June, Musi 
High students joined the protest. My activism started then.

I came to realise that African children’s education was designed to be 
inferior to the other races inSouth Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica>, and that the conditions under 
which I was being schooled were unlikely to change unless I took action.

the African National Congress. Photograph: Phumla Williams 
One of the sad memories that still lingers with me was one my schoolmates who 
was shot and killed. She was one of those who did not participate in the 
protest, but a stray bullet hit her whilst she was sweeping the yard at her 
home. This was the madness of the system we were dealing at time.

After the events in Soweto, my activism led me to leave the country in 1978 to 
join the exiled African National Congress (ANC) in Swaziland. My political 
consciousness had developed to a level of appreciating that the apartheid 
system in the country was responsible for the inequalities in our society.

What is recently pleasing is the level of constructive activism by the 
students that we saw in universities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/mar/03/south-africas-student-protests-have-lessons-for-all-universities>
. But a lot still needs to be done. Education remains the pillar to a better 
life. Three-hundred years of subjugation can never be undone in 40 years. 
Generations to come need to stay on the cause.

When the shooting began, I went into hiding. When the shooting stopped, I came 
out of hiding when others came out. I saw [my brother] Hector [Pieterson] 
across the street, and I called him and waved at him. He came over and I spoke 
to him, but more shots rang out and I went into hiding again. I thought he 
followed me, but he did not come. I came out again and waited at the spot where 
I just saw him. He did not come. When Mbuyiso came past me a group of children 
were gathering nearby. He walked towards the group and picked up a body ... And 
then I saw Hector’s shoes.

The reporter

Tony Kleu, now 67 and living in Sydney, was a white journalist in his mid-20s 
working at the Rand Daily Mail in 1976. He recalled the atmosphere in the build 
up to events on 16 June, as well as his vivid memories of despair and anguish 
as news filtered in. He says theirs was an unusual newsroom at the time in that 
he had many black colleagues, and though the staff did include “a few openly 
pro-government people and several suspected informers, the vast majority of us 
were sympathetic to black aspirations and despised the government.”

“We had known there was growing unrest and that students planned to march,” he 
said, “but I don’t believe anyone had anticipated the scale of the protest or 
the reaction on the 16 June. I don’t think there was expectation of high drama, 
but the reaction when we first heard thousands had joined the march (quite late 
in the morning I think) and that police had attempted to block them was alarm 
and disbelief.

“We were alarmed because we knew damn well what had happened at Sharpeville, 
16 years earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/south-africa-sharpeville-massacre-anniversary>
, and we feared what might happen if the heavily armed police, renowned for 
their brutality, lost control. For several hours there was confusion about the 
scale of the clashes. Palls of smoke could be seen over Soweto, but 
communication was compromised, roads in and out had been blocked and we were 
wary of reports from police.”

It wasn’t until first-hand accounts from reporters came in that the scale of 
the brutality would become clear.

“The first report of a fatality came from the police, who announced that 
rioters, unprovoked, had killed white civilians, but we would soon receive 
evidence the death toll far exceeded the government’s early claims only a 
handful of black people had been killed,” says Kleu.


“We heard how one of our photographers, I think it was Alf Kumalo 
<http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/alf-kumalo-anti-apartheid-photographer-201312641847953345.html>
, hid behind garbage bins risking his life to snap images while trigger happy 
police drove past. I remember the sense of dread in the air and intense concern 
everyone in the newsroom felt – it seemed the country had finally tipped over 
the edge and into barbarism.”

Kleu says he felt a clear need to “convey the full drama”, that “whatever the 
truth, it should be recorded.”

“The most appalling memory I have is one of our black reporters telling us how 
he saw bodies thrown into a van like sacks of potatoes. That image will always 
remain with me.


“I doubt any of us, that night, recognised the day’s events as the beginning 
of a revolution,” he adds. “Those kids were astonishingly proud and brave. I 
feel they became the catalyst that mobilised the masses after a decade of 
ineffectual activism. They deserve to be remembered.”

The historians

Ismail Farouk was a young researcher at the Hector Pieterson Museum in Soweto 
in 2005 when he was commissioned to investigate alternative narratives of the 
16 June uprising.

“The museum itself is limited, and has a strong African National Congress 
political bias, and arguably, a very masculine focus,” he says. “I was 
interested in whose stories get told and why, and wanted to find a multiplicity 
of voices to better reflect the events of that day.”

After 1976, there was little information in the public domain about the 
events: “It was hushed up.”

Searching for ways to present the various voices and memories he had collected 
during extensive interviews, Farouk met Babak Fakhamzadeh, a mobile developer, 
and they started working on an open, accessible way to present the data.

“[Already in 2005] these people were getting older, and they had subjective 
views. We asked ourselves: how do we collect all of these and allow for all the 
discrepancies in the stories. There isn’t one official narrative,” Fakhamzadeh 
explains.

Back then, Google Maps was in its infancy and the two decided to sketch out 
the various routes of the protestors, allowing users to add to it and make 
changes. The result waswww.sowetouprisings.com 
<http://www.sowetouprisings.com/site/>. 

It’s a dynamic narrative of the events of that day. “The popular imagination 
of the uprisings is one of a chaotic, crazy day where the students were violent 
and disorganised,” Farouk explains. “But if you look at the different routes, 
there was a clear goal.”

Looking back on the project more than 10 years later, the two admit that 
although the technology now feels a little rudimentary, the spirit of the 
project remains: “Our core goal was to represent a different view of what 
happened that day.”

small and running everywhere trying to hide ourselves. We had to run for safety 
and ran into neighbouring houses. There was lots of smoke and lots of children 
– it was chaos.

The teacher

In 1976 Richard Welch was a young teacher riding his Vespa scooter to work 
when he saw the newspaper hoardings reporting the uprising. “A feeling of 
exhilaration came over me,” he recalls. “I thought: ‘This is it. Nothing will 
be the same again’.”

After the brutal events of that day, Welch became involved in an alternative 
education project for the young students who had rejected Bantu Education, a 
system designed to keep them in subjection.

“The events of 1976 generated a popular culture of resistance to Bantu 
education and apartheid which spread from the highly politicised township 
students into almost every sphere of South African life,” Welch remembers.

The initiative for the education project came from the Witwatersrand Council 
of Churches, under Simeon Nkoane, the Anglican Dean of Johannesburg. It was 
established as a church initiative, because Nkoane believed “the security 
police would be less likely to threaten an initiative ... if it was based in 
the suburban (mainly white) churches and manned and supported by concerned 
white teachers, students, and other folk,” Welch says.

“In those days the average black high school student had many obstacles to 
overcome in his or her school career, so our students ranged in age from about 
20 years old to 25 years old, some even older. The project ran for 21 years, 
from 1978 to 1999, and it began with approximately 200 students. All in all, it 
probably catered for 150 to 250 students per year.”

Welch’s classes covered basic lessons such as maths, science, english and 
biology, but offered other options too.

“Twice a week, on Thursdays and Saturdays, students participated in the 
so-called Enrichment Programme, later known as the Cultural Programme which 
involved activities promoting theory of music, fine arts, drama, modern dance, 
modern african literature and history, contemporary urban life, and study 
skills.”

Looking back, Welch realises the radical nature of what he and so many others 
were doing. “It was ‘clandestine’ in the sense that we had continually to be on 
our guard, take care what was said in the phone, or to whom one said it. The 
organisers and students, and some tutors at least were often in danger of 
arrest. We never spoke publicly about what we were doing, or sought any kind of 
public profile.”
