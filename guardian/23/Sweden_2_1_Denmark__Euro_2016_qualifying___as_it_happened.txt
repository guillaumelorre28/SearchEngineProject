Well, that was a very enjoyable game. Denmark were disappointing for an hour, 
70 minutes, but then Sweden got nervous. Denmark pushed them back, got a cheap 
goal from a corner, and set things up very nicely for Tuesday. Sweden were much 
the better side for the majority of the game, and created some clear chances, 
but you get the feeling that they rather missed their chance to close the game 
out.Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> will be confident of 
overturning that deficit, I think: they’ve got a slightly more refined style, 
two superior centre-backs, a better goalkeeper, and a playmaker of rare quality 
in Christian Eriksen. Although they don’t have Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and that 
could be the difference.

Thanks for reading. Goodbye.

90 min: Ooh, that was a good chance again: Jacobsen was in acres of space on 
the right, and Olsson didn’t get close enough, and Jorgensen attacks the cross 
– but it’s just over! Very presentable. Jorgensen has done really well since 
coming in.

stick or twist, and ended up doing neither, allowing Denmark to get back into

88 min: Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> have gone to 
pieces, and Johansson completely miskicks in the area, facing his own goal. 
That could have gone anywhere, but fortunately it bounced to safety. I thought 
it was in!

87 min: You have to credit Morten Olsen for making that double change, and 
making it early enough to make a difference. And that’s another good ball in 
from Durmisi, but Jorgensen just can’t get there.

81 min: You could sense that goal was coming, but what a bad goal to concede 
from Sweden’s point of view. The corner was swung in, it was flicked on at the 
near post, and Jorgensen was all alone at the far post to turn it in. Where was 
the Swedish marking?

79 min: Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are really 
pressing here, and Poulsen is not far from getting on the end of a good cross 
from Durmisi. Now it’s a corner. Nervy moments for the hosts.

75 min: Oh, that was a shame: Forsberg did well on the left as Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> broke, and his ball in found 
Ibrahimovic by the byline, but he went with his foot rather than his head, 
karate-style, and couldn’t bring it under control. He’d have been better off 
trying to nod it back for Berg, imho.

68 min: Change for Sweden: Larsson on for Durmaz. That was a good opportunity 
for Bendtner, and he met it well, but Granqvist, I think it was, did just 
enough to put him off.

67 min: Jacobsen’s cross is deflected, and Isaksson couldn’t be certain that 
it was safe, so palms it behind. Corner. And that’s a free header for Bendtner! 
But he puts it wide. Another chance for NB!

63 min: Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> have shown a 
bit more purpose since the double substitution. In the first half they seemed 
reluctant to commit bodies forward, but they’re higher up the pitch now, a bit 
closer to Bendtner.

Well, that was a very enjoyable game. Denmark were disappointing for an hour, 
70 minutes, but then Sweden got nervous. Denmark pushed them back, got a cheap 
goal from a corner, and set things up very nicely for Tuesday. Sweden were much 
the better side for the majority of the game, and created some clear chances, 
but you get the feeling that they rather missed their chance to close the game 
out.Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> will be confident of 
overturning that deficit, I think: they’ve got a slightly more refined style, 
two superior centre-backs, a better goalkeeper, and a playmaker of rare quality 
in Christian Eriksen. Although they don’t have Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and that 
could be the difference.

Thanks for reading. Goodbye.

That’s it!
 
90 min + 3: Bendtner looks like he used his arm as he tried to get on to 
Kjaer’s long pass, but no whistle.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> really pressuring, and Sweden 
are just happy to blam it clear.
 
90 min + 2: Sweden are back on the edge of their 18-yard box. Anywhere will 
do. But that’s a fortunate call – Poulsen is blown for a foul on Olsson, and 
there was hardly anything in it.Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> can breathe.
 
90 min + 1: Three minutes of stoppage time. Swedish fans are biting their 
nails.
 
90 min: Ooh, that was a good chance again: Jacobsen was in acres of space on 
the right, and Olsson didn’t get close enough, and Jorgensen attacks the cross 
– but it’s just over! Very presentable. Jorgensen has done really well since 
coming in.
 
89 min: I just think Sweden got nervous: at 2-0, they didn’t know whether to 
stick or twist, and ended up doing neither, allowing Denmark to get back into 
it.Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are really pressing 
high. They fancy an equaliser.
 
88 min: Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> have gone to 
pieces, and Johansson completely miskicks in the area, facing his own goal. 
That could have gone anywhere, but fortunately it bounced to safety. I thought 
it was in!
 
87 min: You have to credit Morten Olsen for making that double change, and 
making it early enough to make a difference. And that’s another good ball in 
from Durmisi, but Jorgensen just can’t get there.
 
86 min: Eriksen finds space on the edge of the box, but Olsson is across to 
clear the danger. It’s all hands to the pump forSweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden>.
 
84 min: That goal has really changed the tie, hasn’t it? Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> were sub-par for 70 minutes; now 
they look the more likely to score again.
 
83 min: Another corner. The Friends Arena is nervous. Isaksson palms it clear 
after Eriksen took it quickly.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are on top here.
 
82 min: John Guidetti replaces Ibrahimovic. If Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> can get another one here, 
they’ll have got out of jail. They haven’t played well at all, but they’re back 
in it.
 
81 min: You could sense that goal was coming, but what a bad goal to concede 
from Sweden’s point of view. The corner was swung in, it was flicked on at the 
near post, and Jorgensen was all alone at the far post to turn it in. Where was 
the Swedish marking?
 
Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are back in it!

the tie. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX Shutterstock  
79 min: Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are really 
pressing here, and Poulsen is not far from getting on the end of a good cross 
from Durmisi. Now it’s a corner. Nervy moments for the hosts.
 
77 min: Really nice from Forsberg again, but his pass for Larsson as he 
approached the box was errant.Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> can kill this game off on the 
counter-attack, if they so desire.
 
75 min: Oh, that was a shame: Forsberg did well on the left as Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> broke, and his ball in found 
Ibrahimovic by the byline, but he went with his foot rather than his head, 
karate-style, and couldn’t bring it under control. He’d have been better off 
trying to nod it back for Berg, imho.
 
74 min: Durmisi’s cross is too long for everybody, but Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> can push Sweden in here, since 
it’s a throw right next to the corner flag.
 
73 min: Sweden are in control here, but they must be careful not to concede: 
Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> would fancy their 
chances if this match ended 2-1.
 
72 min: Ooh, that was close! Durmisi looked for Braithwaite, and though 
everyone missed it, it had Isaksson worried. That’s Braithwaite’s last action, 
and he’s replaced by Yussuf Poulsen.
 
70 min: Olsson goes at Jacobsen and wins the corner. It’s a waste, and easily 
gathered by Schmeichel.
 
68 min: Change for Sweden: Larsson on for Durmaz. That was a good opportunity 
for Bendtner, and he met it well, but Granqvist, I think it was, did just 
enough to put him off.
 
67 min: Jacobsen’s cross is deflected, and Isaksson couldn’t be certain that 
it was safe, so palms it behind. Corner. And that’s a free header for Bendtner! 
But he puts it wide. Another chance for NB!
 
66 min: Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> have woken up, 
at last, and they’ve pushed Sweden right back. But that’s doughty work from 
Kallstrom, and Eriksen must make do with a throw.
 
65 min: Ooh, terrible giveaway by Hojbjerg, but Forsberg’s touch lets him 
down, andSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> can’t profit.
 
63 min: Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> have shown a 
bit more purpose since the double substitution. In the first half they seemed 
reluctant to commit bodies forward, but they’re higher up the pitch now, a bit 
closer to Bendtner.
 
62 min: Agger does well to lever Ibrahimovic off it, as the Swede fell to 
ground. No penalty. NowDenmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> 
respond, and Bendtner is close to getting on the end of a cross from the left; 
it was just too high for him.
 
60 min: Durmisi lets it run under his foot by the left touchline, and the 
Sweden fans guffaw. It’s been that sort of night forDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark>.
 
59 min: Olsson got clear in box next to the byline, and waited to pull it back 
to a yellow shirt … but just couldn’t find one.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> recover and whack it clear.
