The unlikely choice of in-flight entertainment

 for the occupants of the ISS, which has been in orbit since 1998, has been 
revealed after a freedom of information request by Gizmodo’s Matt Novak. The 
list, which contains more than 500 movies and TV shows, includes some 
questionable entries. As well as all four Alien films – which essentially 
detail the plight of isolated space travellers picked off by near-unkillable 
xenomorphs, astronauts can watch Gravity (a tyro astronaut barely survives a 
traumatic accident in orbit), Starship Troopers (humanity menaced by 
near-unkillable alien insectoids), and Moon (after an accident, an astronaut 
realises he is a clone). On the upside, the ISS residents can relax with such 
apparently harmless comedies as Zoolander, A Room With a View and Dodgeball.

The movie-screening abilities of the ISS were revealed in 2015, when station 
commander Scott Kelly tweeted a picture of the HD projection facilities, 
showing a still fromGravity <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity>.
