When I lived in Buenos Aires in the 90s, one of its few drawbacks was the 
sweltering summer heat. Escaping the reach of the city usually involved a long 
trek on a bus. My one salvation was Tres Bocas – an island in the Rio Paraná 
delta. It only entailed a short train journey to Tigre, and a 40-minute boat 
ride (about £8).

Each year, on my return to Argentina with my family, I still head here. The 
island’s main restaurant and only shop is El Hornero, astride a small 
tributary, a short amble along a mud track from the landing bay. We usually sit 
outside in the courtyard, under the welcome shade of a giant wisteria and 
savour the alchemy of smoke and meat being grilled.

The food is nothing fancy – the usual Argentinian suspects of chorizo, morcilla
 (blood sausage),vacio (flank), entrańa (skirt) – but it’s well executed and 
cheap too, about £10 a head. The alfesco setting enhances the eating experience 
(there’s no interior just a small grocer shop) and we arrive hungry. Having 
eaten long and well, we sit back under the cool, dappled light and polish off 
the remaining malbec, while the kids scamper off, ice-creams in hand, to 
explore the island.

Though only an hour away, the bustle and grind of the city seem a distant 
prospect. The only sound that might break the tranquillity is the distant chug 
of a boat or the hiss of thecigarras (crickets). The waters gurgle past and the 
late-afternoon light slants through the birch trees. For now, for this short 
while, all is fine.
