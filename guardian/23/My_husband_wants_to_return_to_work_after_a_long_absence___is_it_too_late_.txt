Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?

My husband is a previously successful accountant, but three years ago our 
family was hit by several tragic incidents that affected us all badly, and my 
husband in particular. He felt he had to take time out from work to get through 
a grieving process, and hasn’t worked since. He now feels fully fit to work 
again, physically and emotionally.

He is highly qualified (CFA) and worked in City firms. Is it too late for 
someone in his position to re-enter the industry? How might potential employers 
view someone who has been out of the profession for such an extended period 
when there is an emotional, rather than a practical, underlying reason, for 
doing so? He is concerned that, if asked to explain the break, he wouldn’t be 
able to provide a good rationale.

Would potential employers consider this extended break too much of a gap? Or 
is there another way of easing his way back into the field, short of actually 
applying for a staff job with a firm and avoiding the question he fears most?

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a
