A former cabinet secretary who was forced to resign after arranging Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>’s visit to Mexico has 
been unexpectedly named foreign minister as the country prepares for a 
potentially rocky relationship with the incoming US president.

President Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto> named ex-finance 
minister Luis Videgaray as foreign relations minister on Wednesday, apparently 
hoping that his most trusted adviser can court close relations with senior 
members of the Trump administration.

“With the change of government in the United States on 20 January, the 
instructions for secretary Videgaray is to accelerate dialogue and contacts so 
that from the first day the bases for building a constructive work relationship 
can be established,” Peña Nieto said in televised address to the nation.


“It should be a relationship, which will allow us to strengthen bilateral ties 
in security, immigration, commerce and investment.”


Videgaray stood down from his previous cabinet position in September, after 
Trump visited Mexico City for an encounterwidely seen as a humiliating public 
relations disaster for Peña Nieto

The meeting transpired in spite of objections of the foreign ministry, but at 
the urging of Videgaray, Mexican media reported.

Mexicans expressed outrage with Peña Nieto, who appeared not to have 
challenged Trump over his expressed plans to makeMexico

deport millions of Mexican migrants

Videgaray resigned barely a week later, through political pundits suspected he 
still had the president’s ear.


Trump initially claimed Videgaray’s resignation as a personal victory, saying 
in an NBC News forum: “Look at the aftermath today, where the people that 
arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That’s how well 
we did.”

Less than a day later, however, Trump described Videgaray on Twitter as “a 
brilliant finance minister and wonderful man”, adding: “With Luis, Mexico and 
the United States would have made wonderful deals together – where both Mexico 
and the US would have benefitted.”

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is 
highly respected by President Peña Nieto.

The apparent change in tack was not lost on some in Mexico, where former 
president Vicente Fox – an outspoken critic of Trump – accused him of having a 
“two-face personality”.

@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, yesterday you took 
credit for his withdrawal and now you praise him? Don, you gotta stop this 
two-face personality.

Immediately after Trump’s election victory, Fox himself changed his tone 
<https://twitter.com/vicentefoxque/status/796387798303571972>, calling Peña 
Nieto “visionary” for inviting Trump and saying Videgaray “was right”.

But Trump’s posture towards Mexico has not softened: he has maintained his 
pledges to expel undocumented Mexicans, and taken aim at US companies with 
factories in Mexico.

On Tuesday, Ford announced it would not proceed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/donald-trump-general-motors-tax-chevrolet-cruz>
 with a $1.6bn investment in the northern state of San Luis Potosí and will 
instead invest in a factory in Michigan.


Analysts in Mexico said they were not surprised by the return to prominence of 
Videgaray, who managed Peña Nieto’s presidential election campaign and served 
as finance minister, overseeing the approval and implementation of suite of 
structural reforms which won applause from international investors.

“It was bound to happen,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine 
Nexos. “He’s the president’s brain.”

His time as finance secretary proved controversial, however. Public spending 
climbed during his time in office, along with indebtedness, while economic 
growth failed to meet the promised 5% growth per year.
