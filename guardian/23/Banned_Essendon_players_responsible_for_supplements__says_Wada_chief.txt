Wada <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wada> director general David Howman 
said the players’ lack of curiosity about the Bombers’ controversial 
supplements regime was one aspect contributing to their suspensions.

“They’ve been educated so they are responsible for what went into their 
bodies,” Howman told 3AW on Wednesday.

“The players were not consistent in what they told various people and the way 
the evidence was actually presented to the Court of Arbitration.

“The matters relating to each player came out in a different fashion including 
one who didn’t even concede to his doctor, when treated for a special illness, 
that he had been taking these things.

“That could have led to real detrimental aspects to him health-wise.”

Howman said Wada launched the appeal to CAS to ensure the standard of proof 
required in anti-doping cases was equal worldwide.

“It’s not a question extending sympathy [to the players] when you have to 
administer laws, it’s a question of following the process and following the 
laws properly,” Howman said.

“If you stop doing that then you open up avenues of appeal for all sorts of 
people in all sorts of sports around the world.”

AFL Players’ Association boss Paul Marsh on Tuesday called for the AFL to 
consider severing ties with Wada in the wake of the CAS decision.

Howman dismissed Marsh’s criticism. “We cater for all team sports throughout 
the world,” Howman said. “It’s not as though the AFL is alone in this.”
