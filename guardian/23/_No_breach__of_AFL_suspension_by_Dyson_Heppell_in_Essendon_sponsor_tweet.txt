Dyson Heppell did not breach his suspension when he used social media to 
promote anEssendon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> sponsor, the 
AFL says.


The star midfielder, who will miss this season as one of 34 current and past 
Essendon players found guilty of an anti-doping charge, tweeted on Monday he 
would attend a local car launch for Kia, one of Essendon’s major sponsors.


“As I understand it there was no issue ... he wasn’t in club-based gear and 
they’re a personal sponsor of his,”AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> 
chief Gillon McLachlan told reporters in Adelaide on Tuesday.


Wada’s successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport means Heppell, 
11 of his team-mates and five players at other clubs will miss this season.

The AFL initially directed enquiries about the tweet to Asada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada> but a spokesperson for the 
anti-doping body said it was a matter for the AFL.

“Clearly players need to be careful ... [but] I’ve had advice this morning 
that there was no breach of his suspension,” McLachlan said on Tuesday.


There are strict guidelines around what the banned players at Essendon and 
other clubs can and cannot do during their suspension. They are allowed to 
attend AFL games but cannot go into their changerooms. They also cannot be 
involved in official club activities.
