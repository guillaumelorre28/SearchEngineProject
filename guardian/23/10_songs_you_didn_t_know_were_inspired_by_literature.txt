Perhaps the most famous song with literary references, Kate Bush’s Wuthering 
Heights relays the tale of Emily Bronte’s gothic novel of the same name. Told 
through the point of view of Catherine during a ghostly visit to her old house, 
she calls to her lover, Heathcliff, to let her in through the window. Kate 
Bush’s operatic voice and quirky dancing conveys the eerie spirit of the scene 
from chapter three of Wuthering Heights when she is seen by the new tenant, Mr 
Lockwood.

Fun fact: Kate Bush and Emily Bronte share the same birthday. 

We Are the Dead by David Bowie is inspired by 1984 by George Orwell

We Are the Dead is one of many tracks on David Bowie’s Diamond Dogs album that 
pays homage to George Orwell’s 1984. The title of the track is taken from a 
recurring line in the novel which simultaneously comments on the repressed 
“inner and outer parties” as well the protagonist’s impending imprisonment by 
the thought police.

Fun fact: A great deal of the songs on this album were originally intended for 
a theatrical production of the novel, but Orwell’s estate denied Bowie the 
rights.

Atticus by the Noisettes is inspired by To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

This song by the Noisettes uses To Kill a Mockingbird’s protagonist, Atticus, 
as a metaphor for fearlessness and integrity. Throughout Harper Lee’s timeless 
classic, Atticus routinely demonstrates the sort of courage that Shingai 
Shoniwa sings about in the song of the same title, with a clear reference to 
the novel in the first line of the song: “To kill a mockingbird is to silence 
the song that seduces you”.

Banana Co by Radiohead is inspired by One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez

In this Gabriel Garcia Marquez-inspired track, Radiohead use imagery from One 
Hundred Years of Solitude to relay the devastation that banana companies 
brought to a great deal of Latin American countries in the twentieth century.

Fun fact: This is of one of many references to literature in Radiohead’s 
catalogue; their 1997 single, Paranoid Android, for example, is named after 
Marvin, the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the 
Galaxy series.


Hurricane by Thirty Seconds to Mars takes some inspiration from The Raven, by 
Edgar Allan Poe 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/edgar-allan-poe-complete-stories-and-poems.html>

Poe’s famous narrative poem The Raven tells the tale of a man who, plagued 
with the memories of a dead woman called Lenore, is visited by a talking raven 
in the dead of the night.

Although Hurricane was not explicitly written about The Raven, the conclusion 
of the uncensored director’s cut of the music video for the single release 
directly quotes the following lines of the poem: “Deep into that darkness 
peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no 
mortal ever dared to dream before”.

Despite the fact that Hurricane doesn’t take its lyrical influence from Poe, 
themes from The Raven such as anxiety, death and lost love are echoed in it, 
which probably explains why it makes such a good fit with the music video!

Firework by Katy Perry is inspired by On the Road by Jack Kerouac 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/on-the-road-24.html>

Despite it’s widely parodied opening line – “Do you ever feel like a plastic 
bag” – the chorus from the smash-hit Firework by Katy Perry has an unlikely 
source of inspiration: Jack Kerouac’s Beat generation classic, On the Road.

Compare the lyrics: 

you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine, just own the night like the 
4th of July. Cause, baby, you’re a firework, come on, show ‘em what you’re 
worth, make ‘em go, aah, aah, aah, As you shoot across the sky.

… with this famous quotation from Kerouac’s novel:

The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to 
talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who 
never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow 
roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see 
the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes, “Awww!”

… and you can see the similarities.

Fun fact: Katy Perry’s ex-husband, Russell Brand is a huge fan of Kerouac. 
Katy Perry acknowledged the influence in ared carpet interview at the 2012 
Grammy Nominations <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4z465jcg0k>. 

Thieves in the Night by Blackstar takes some inspiration from The Bluest Eye 
by Toni Morrison <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bluest-eye.html>

The Bluest Eye’s exploration of the effects of racism and the cultural 
imposition of European standards of beauty on black people in late 1930s 
mid-western America (as told through the voice of the main character, Pecola, a 
little black girl who desperately wants blue eyes) is referenced in the song by 
the occasional hip-hop duo Mos Def and Talib Kweli.

Themes from Morrison’s novel are used throughout the song as a means of 
echoing those same ideas, but as they applied to the other rappers and the 
wider African American community in 1998, when Black Star, Mos Def and Talib 
Kweli’s collaborative album was released.

Ramble On by Led Zepplin is inspired by Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lord-of-the-rings-18.html>

One of several Led Zeppelin songs said to have been inspired by JRR Tolkien’s 
epic series, Ramble On is a re-imagining of the journey of Lord of the Rings 
characters Sam and Frodo. In this 1969 classic, a woman, and not the infamous 
ring, is the object of the narrator’s obsessions. In the second verse for 
example, lead vocalist Robert Plant sings:

Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair, but Gollum and the 
evil one, crept up and slipped away with her.

Fun Fact: Robert Plant’s dog, Strider, was allegedly named after Lord of the 
Rings character Aragorn, who is referred to by the same name at various points 
in the series.

Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones is inspired by The Master and the 
Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/master-and-margarita.html>

Mikhail Bulgakov’s surreal, anti-Stalinist satire played a part in inspiring 
this Stones staple. In parts of Sympathy for the Devil, Mick Jagger takes on a 
voice similar to that of The Master and the Margarita’s devilish protagonist, 
mirroring the opening of the novel in which Satan, disguised as a mysterious, 
sophisticated figure, approaches two men in 1930s Russia, who are debating the 
existence of Jesus Christ.

another source of inspiration for Sympathy for the Devil.

Song for Clay by Bloc Party is inspired by Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/less-than-zero.html>

Bret Easton Ellis’s coming of age memoir is a fitting allusion for Song for 
Clay by broody indie band, Bloc Party. Often compared to J.D. Salinger’s angsty 
bildungsroman, The Catcher in the Rye, Less Than Zero follows the experiences 
of the main character, Clay when he returns home to Los Angeles during his 
winter break from University in the 1980s.

In Bloc Party’s Song for Clay, references to the book’s themes of youth, 
overindulgence and Ellis’s exploration of the pervasiveness of early MTV 
culture – which, similar to social media today, had a huge impact on teenagers 
in the 1980s – are present in almost every line.
