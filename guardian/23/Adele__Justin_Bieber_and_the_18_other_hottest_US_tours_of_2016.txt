 AC/DC conclude the first leg of their Rock or Bust world tour in Melbourne 
this month. Photograph: C Taylor Crothers 
Giant inflatable women? Napoleonic cannons? An animated short depicting 
guitarist Angus Young as an asteroid? If the US leg of the Dacca’s Rock or Bust 
tour resembles the European dates, be prepared for all the above. There will be 
poignancy as well as preposterousness, though. After 43 years, this is the 
Australians’ first run without founding member Malcolm Young.He retired with 
dementia last year.

Described by one Guardian review as a lyricist who can and does “make water 
marks on the ceiling interesting” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/10/best-albums-of-2015-no-7-sometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit-courtney-barnett>
, the 25-year-old Melbourne singer-guitarist combines everyday subject material 
– vegetable shopping, anyone? – with deceptively addictive tunes. On stage, she 
can seem painfully shy but, with her debut album making many best-of-2015 
lists, these three shows promise much.

summer: they dropped two records in five weeks.Depression Cherry

it gives the Baltimore duo plenty of new material to play.

After two years of arrests, assault charges and one attempt at smuggling a 
monkey into Germany, the previously clean-cut Canadian seems to be 
reacquainting himself with The Rails. His November albumPurpose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/justin-bieber-purpose-review-a-grown-up-sorry-sort-of>
 showcased a matured sound, while Bieber used a VMA appearance to apologise for 
past indiscretions. This 58-stop tour should (probably) see the growing up 
continue.

They’ve won 10 Grammys and sold 30m albums yet the Dallas trio’s legacy 
remains defined by one onstage comment. Frontwoman Natalie Maines’ 2003 
declaration she was ashamed of President George W Bushled to the band being 
blackballed by country music’s establishment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/the-dixie-chicks-tour-is-country-music-ready-to-forgive>

American tour since then. Whether they share their views on Donald Trump 
remains to be seen.

The shoulder pads, white suits and supermodels have (largely) disappeared as 
Duran Duran have matured from New Romantic playboys into elder statesmen of 
English pop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/10/duran-duran-snubbed-dylan-simon-le-bon-paper-gods>

They’re on the road in support of 14th album Paper Gods but expect the classics 
– and Simon Le Bon’s sequinned trousers – to be aired.

Too many extra-curricular activities – prison time, multimillion dollar 
lawsuits,inter-hip hop feuds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/17/cash-money-sues-tidal-for-50m-over-lil-wayne-album>
 – have arguably distracted Lil Wayne from living up to the hype once lavished 
on him. This year’sFree Weezy Album 
<http://www.complex.com/music/2015/07/lil-wayne-free-weezy-album-first-impressions-review/>
 was brilliant in bursts, inconsistent in the main. Still, at least his 
unpredictability means the 33-year-old New Orleanian is never anything but 
interesting live.

albumWilder Mind  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/30/mumford-and-sons-wilder-mind-review>

Despite Winston Marshall recently declaring“I fucking hate the banjo”

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/muse-drones-review-the-bands-most-focused-work-in-a-decade>
tour. Never ones to eschew either the big topics – war and peace, government 
oppression, supermassive black holes – or potentially ridiculous stagecraft, 
the first leg saw the English prog-poppers flying actual drones over their 
audiences. “Vaguely threatening,”noted the LA Times

Back in January 2014, electro-experimentalists MuteMath made a resolution to 
write a song a day. The result isVitals 
<http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/stream-mutemaths-new-album-vitals/>, the 
New Orleans outfit’s fourth and, thus far, most poppy album, released last 
month. Live, they’re famously kaleidoscopic, freewheeling through jazz, punk, 
funk, gospel and disco with the odd 10-minute drum solo thrown in for good 
measure.

Protomartyr

Three albums in, the urgency that propels the post-punk of Detroit’s 
Protomartyr <http://www.protomartyrband.com/>shows no sign of slowing. Perhaps 
that’s because lead singer Joe Casey was already deep into his 30s when he 
started the band in 2008. Live and in support of 2015’sThe Agent Intellect 
<http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20966-the-agent-intellect/>, expect more 
Joy Division-ist doom distilled through distortion.

drop “very soon”. Since then, we’ve had singles,cover art viewings

upcoming tour difficult but this is Rihanna. Expect hits, bling, costume 
changes and raunch.

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/16/bruce-springsteen-to-release-mammoth-box-set-of-the-river-sessions>
. A possible bonus here: when he first toured this record 26 years ago, it was 
the only time he’s started with the searing Born to Run. Same again, Boss?

NOT a band you could accuse of understatement, the New Jersey outfit’s fourth 
album,The Most Lamentable Tragedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/23/titus-andronicus-the-most-lamentable-tragedy-review>
, was a 29-track punk rock opera based on frontman Patrick Stickles’ battle 
with depression. Their gigs are similarly intense, oscillating between reaching 
for greatness and collapsing into chaos. Often in the space of a single song.

Waiting for new Tool material has long been one of music’s least-rewarding 
endeavours. After releasing just four records in 16 years, the California metal 
band’s fifth is still gestating a decade on. Safe to say,guitarist Adam Jones’s 
November announcement that “things are really flowing” 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tool-s-adam-jones-on-2016-tour-album-progress-amazing-new-song-20151123>
 is probably best taken with a pinch of salt. These 17 shows should fill a gap.
