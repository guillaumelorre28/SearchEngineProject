Faldela Tolker is waiting to greet us on the doorstep of her neat, 
lilac-coloured house. She ushers us into the kitchen, where a large metal pot 
simmering on the hotplate emits a spicy aroma.

Chef Faldela gives cookery lessons to tourists at her home in Bo-Kaap, Cape 
Town. The food cooked in this predominantly Muslim neighbourhood is as piquant 
as the hot pink and burnt orange painted houses that rise gently up the lower 
slopes of Signal Hill, part of Table Mountain.

Unique to the Western Cape of South Africa, Cape Malay cuisine mixes African 
traditions with those of the Malaysian and Indonesian slaves brought over by 
the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries. A blend of spices – ginger, fennel, 
star anise, tamarind and, most important, turmeric – gives the food its 
distinctive aromatic quality. Stews, roasts and sauce-heavy curries are 
popular, as are meat patties and milk and bread puddings.

Before we start wrapping pastry squares around a chicken and potato mix to 
make samosas, Faldela, whose own background is Malaysian Indian, offers us each 
a little tulip glass filled with a baby-pink liquid. Calledfalooda, it’s a 
refreshing mix of rose syrup, tapioca seeds and cow’s milk. Afterwards, around 
the kitchen table, we use fluffy rotis (pronounced “rootis”) to mop up our lamb 
and coconut stew.

 Freshly fried samosas at Faldela’s house 
Koeksisters, sweet sticky doughnuts sprinkled with desiccated coconut, are 
washed down with redbush tea for afters. Later, a gentle stroll around Bo-Kaap 
walks at least some of it off.
• A two-hour cookery lesson and lunch with Faldela costs from £13pp (+27 72
