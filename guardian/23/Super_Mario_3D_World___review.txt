What's the story?


About as deep and involving as the story for any of Mario's platforming 
outings – Bowser is causing trouble again, so the scarlet-clad plumber, his 
brother, Luigi, and assorted colourful friends are out to jump on the 
turtle-shelled creep until he behaves again.

Gameplay

If it ain't broke... The finely tuned pipe-warping, enemy-squishing gameplay 
of the Mario series remains essentially unchanged, having been refined over 
several decades. The only notable change comes in adding multiplayer, a first 
for the 3D outings. Group play is fun, demanding teamwork.

Highs and lows


3D World introduces the single greatest addition to Mario's power-up arsenal: 
the Super Bell. This humble artefact turns characters into cat form, scampering 
up walls, scratching away enemies and becoming around 60% more adorable – 
clearly created with internet fandom in mind. Judging proper attack or jump 
distance can be troublesome though.

The verdict


Kitty-shaped distractions aside, this still doesn't quite scratch the itch 
that a fully 3D Mario game would. The numerous courses emulate classic 
scrolling levels, feeling a bit stunted compared to the likes ofSuper Mario 
Galaxy. However, it remains extraordinarily fun in its own right, and is proof 
thatNintendo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> knows what it's 
doing with the Wii U.
