Well, as expected, Korea have won through to the final and once again they’ve 
kept a clean sheet. AsIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> 
struggled to find any kind of synchronicity Korea dominated possession and took 
their goals well. That said, there were a number of times they looked panicky 
in defence and that will give the UAE* hope that they can be the first team to 
find a way through them in the final.

* There’s no way the Socceroos will beat the UAE tomorrow night. But do join 
me here for the game. Until then, thanks for coming. Three cheers for Prince 
Philip on this Australia Day! Hip hip....

90 min + 6: Korea win a corner in an extra minute of time added on. They don’t 
look to cross it over, however, but rather take a touch and surround it like 
sentries.

90 min: There will be two minutes of added time. Korea will surely be in the 
final now, for the first time in a long time.

Kalaf, meantime, races down field and delays his cross too long and, under 
pressure, his last ditch attempt to cross, or was it shoot?, loops over the 
goal.

sits for Hussein but Kim Jin-su, on a yellow, dives in spectacularly to knock 
away before Hussein can shoot.

86 min: Need I say Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are 
running out of time? Mike Mackenzie, meantime, wants a photo of the ref. I’ll 
do my best, Mike.

Mahmood, meantime, tries to knock down a cross to a teammate, but there was no 
teammate within coo-ee. Korea win possession and in their upfield romp Son 
Heung-min is brought down somewhat roughly. Free kick in midfield. Korea are in 
no hurry to take it.

82 min: Kyle Greenwood joins us late for a compliment and, less importantly, a 
stab at the colour of the ref’s shirt: “Firstly, thanks for the MBM. Enjoying 
it immensely, especially in those moments whenIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are displaying their dynamic lack 
of imagination with the ball. Secondly, I think describing the ref’s shirt as 
‘pale mauve’ is unkind. I’m streaming it on my computer, so perhaps my colour 
settings are misleading, but I’d have described it as ‘blood lavender’. 
Somebody really ought to get the Pantone colour swatch out for this one.”

Blood lavender. Genius.

78 min: And still the rain falls... as Hassan has his shoelaces tied by his 
centre-half. Not, I assume, because he can’t tie shoelaces more that he can’t 
be stuffed taking off his gloves.Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq>, meanwhile, have lost a bit of zip. 
That epic quarterfinal could be catching up with them.

catch them on the break. But passes aren’t sticking and some of the challenges

Iraq sub: Marwan Hussein on for Abdul Zahra. Striker for midfielder.

73 min: An email! On the game. Sort of. Michael O’Regan is trying to decide 
what colour the ref’s shirt is: “A rather natty outfit of a colour never seen 
before on a football pitch. While the shorts are the traditional black, I would 
describe the shirts, and their matching socks, as a sort of, um, pale mauve. 
Perhaps others with different television colour settings would like to comment 
on this so we can all agree.” That’s a much nicer description of the colour 
than my early attempt.

70 min: Sub Ali Adnan risks getting himself sent off when he and Son Heung-min 
clash and the Iraqi leans in like a tower in Pisa. Not sure if he made contact 
with the head but he was chastised by the ref who, in waving away interested 
onlookers, brushes his thumb into Adnan’s eye. Figuring that’s punishment 
enough Adnan is spared a card.

64 min: Hassan is forced into action again, punching a high ball that Lee 
Jeong-Hyeop attempts to head with the back of his noggin.

A free-kick follows from the left and a lovely cross from Kim-Young-Gwon whips 
towards his teammates, lining up on near the far post, but a timely head from 
Iraqi sends it out for a corner. Nothing comes from it, however.

60 min: Kalaf runs about 40m across field but Korea are content to shadow him, 
driving him towards the sideline like sheep dogs with diplomas. Kalaf is forced 
to turn and look inside and it all fizzles out.

58 min: More jitters from Korea at the back, and a poor clearance from the 
keeper put them under all sorts butIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> can’t capitalise. Makes you wonder 
how Korea haven’t conceded so far this tournament. Iraq’s pressing has led to 
some mistakes. Take note Australia. I mean, UAE.

56 min: Two great chances to Korea! First Kim Sung-Yueng stings the hands of 
Hassan from range, before Son Heung-min gets an even better chance. But again 
Hassan is equal to it, pushing it away to his right.

53 min: Abdul Zahra finds space on the right, skips inside the defence and 
tries to find a teammate in space near the penalty spot, but Korea swarm on the 
cross and clear the ball, not without a tremor.

52 min: Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are looking long odds 
now, and remember they’ve had a day’s less rest than Korea. It will take some 
effort to pull this out of the fire.

50 min: From a deflected cross that looped high in the air Lee Jeong-Hyeop 
chested it down in order to take a snap right-foot shot from the edge of the D. 
But he didn’t drop it at his feet, rather at the feet of Kim Young-Gwon who 
propped on his right and put his left boot through it. It took a deflection en 
route and beat Hassan on his left. Nice strike.

48 min: He’ll get roasted for that later but Korea keeper Kim Jin-Hyeon, in 
pursuit of a through-ball on the left, ends up marking Yasin, I think it was, 
on the left touchline. ButIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> 
couldn’t find a way to get a shot off sparing Jin-Hyeon’s blushes. That was the 
worst of Bruce Grobbelaar.

Half-time

Peeeeep! And that’s oranges. Korea have dominated on the whole but in the last 
10 minutes of that half they’ve looked nervy and they might have conceded an 
equaliser hadIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> been more 
clinical. Back in a bit.

45 min + 1: A late chance for a Korean second before the break. Free-kick from 
just to the right of centre, 25 yards out. Son Heung-min lines it up and, using 
all his experience with Bayer Leverkusen, hits the wall. This tournament has 
lacked some spectacular dead ball goals, hasn’t it?

45 min: Mahmood and Park Joo-ho square up when a hefty Mahmood tackle leaves 
the Korean squished up against the advertising hoardings like a thrown tomato. 
No foul, says the ref. As you were lads.

44 min: Yes, Korea are shaky! A backward header to his keeper by Kwak Tae-Hwi 
fails to take into account Abdul Zahra lurking in behind him. The Iraqi should 
have taken a shot in hindsight but he looked to square to Mahmood. Mahmood 
couldn’t get on the end of it, however, so a great chance went begging.

43 min: And now Kalaf get off a shot from the edge of the box! But Kim 
Jin-Hyeon gets down low to his right and turns it away for a corner. Just as 
well, as Abdul Zahra was on the scene ready to tap in on the rebound.

42 min: A nice one-two on the right between Abdul Zahra and Kalaf falls to 
Mahmood but just as he tries to get a shot in it’s nipped away. Korea looking a 
tad shaky here before the break.

Well, as expected, Korea have won through to the final and once again they’ve 
kept a clean sheet. AsIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> 
struggled to find any kind of synchronicity Korea dominated possession and took 
their goals well. That said, there were a number of times they looked panicky 
in defence and that will give the UAE* hope that they can be the first team to 
find a way through them in the final.

* There’s no way the Socceroos will beat the UAE tomorrow night. But do join 
me here for the game. Until then, thanks for coming. Three cheers for Prince 
Philip on this Australia Day! Hip hip....
 
Peeep! Peeeeeep!

And that’s fulltime. Korea break their semi-final hoodoo and will return to 
Stadium Australia in five days.
 
90 min + 6: Korea win a corner in an extra minute of time added on. They don’t 
look to cross it over, however, but rather take a touch and surround it like 
sentries.
 
90 min + 5: Korea harry Iraq into a backpass. Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq>, Robbie Slater says, “have a 
mountain to climb”. Does he mean to suggest they could still win it?
 
90 min + 3: Korea sub: Ki Sung-yueng goes off replaced by Han Kook Young. To 
waste time and protect him from any late injury.
 
90 min + 2: Adnan takes the corner from the left and though Ibrahim gets a 
head to it he was back-peddling when he did so and as a result couldn’t get 
enough purchase on it. Goalkick.
 
90 min + 1: Two minutes of added time? I meant five. Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> push forward again and win a corner.
 
90 min: There will be two minutes of added time. Korea will surely be in the 
final now, for the first time in a long time.

Kalaf, meantime, races down field and delays his cross too long and, under 
pressure, his last ditch attempt to cross, or was it shoot?, loops over the 
goal.
 
89 min: But forget colours for a moment, as a Mahmood backheel in the area 
sits for Hussein but Kim Jin-su, on a yellow, dives in spectacularly to knock 
away before Hussein can shoot.
 
88 min: You can just about make out the ref in this pic, Mike:

86 min: Need I say Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are 
running out of time? Mike Mackenzie, meantime, wants a photo of the ref. I’ll 
do my best, Mike.

Mahmood, meantime, tries to knock down a cross to a teammate, but there was no 
teammate within coo-ee. Korea win possession and in their upfield romp Son 
Heung-min is brought down somewhat roughly. Free kick in midfield. Korea are in 
no hurry to take it.
 
84 min: There’s an idiot on the field and security swarm him like bees on 
honey. It is Australia Day so he may have overindulged on the Iced Vo-Vos.
 
82 min: Kyle Greenwood joins us late for a compliment and, less importantly, a 
stab at the colour of the ref’s shirt: “Firstly, thanks for the MBM. Enjoying 
it immensely, especially in those moments whenIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are displaying their dynamic lack 
of imagination with the ball. Secondly, I think describing the ref’s shirt as 
‘pale mauve’ is unkind. I’m streaming it on my computer, so perhaps my colour 
settings are misleading, but I’d have described it as ‘blood lavender’. 
Somebody really ought to get the Pantone colour swatch out for this one.”

Blood lavender. Genius.
 
81 min: Sub Korea: Nam Tae-hee goes off to get out of the rain, Jang Hyun-soo 
comes on. Midfielder for a defender. As you’d expect at this stage.
 
79 min: Salim slides in for a tackle and has his leading ankle stood on, quite 
accidentally it seemed.Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> have no 
more subs so he’ll just have to soldier on. And he does. Good man.
 
78 min: And still the rain falls... as Hassan has his shoelaces tied by his 
centre-half. Not, I assume, because he can’t tie shoelaces more that he can’t 
be stuffed taking off his gloves.Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq>, meanwhile, have lost a bit of zip. 
That epic quarterfinal could be catching up with them.
 
75 min: It’s become scrappy here, end to end stuff as Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> push forward and Korea look to 
catch them on the break. But passes aren’t sticking and some of the challenges 
are getting more agricultural.

Iraq sub: Marwan Hussein on for Abdul Zahra. Striker for midfielder.
 
73 min: An email! On the game. Sort of. Michael O’Regan is trying to decide 
what colour the ref’s shirt is: “A rather natty outfit of a colour never seen 
before on a football pitch. While the shorts are the traditional black, I would 
describe the shirts, and their matching socks, as a sort of, um, pale mauve. 
Perhaps others with different television colour settings would like to comment 
on this so we can all agree.” That’s a much nicer description of the colour 
than my early attempt.
 
70 min: Sub Ali Adnan risks getting himself sent off when he and Son Heung-min 
clash and the Iraqi leans in like a tower in Pisa. Not sure if he made contact 
with the head but he was chastised by the ref who, in waving away interested 
onlookers, brushes his thumb into Adnan’s eye. Figuring that’s punishment 
enough Adnan is spared a card.
 
69 min: An Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> corner is cleared 
but the Lions of Mesopotamia can’t get a shot away.
 
67 min: Some real urgency from Iraqi now. Might lead to a goal. To Korea. Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are pushing higher and higher.
 
64 min: Hassan is forced into action again, punching a high ball that Lee 
Jeong-Hyeop attempts to head with the back of his noggin.

A free-kick follows from the left and a lovely cross from Kim-Young-Gwon whips 
towards his teammates, lining up on near the far post, but a timely head from 
Iraqi sends it out for a corner. Nothing comes from it, however.
 
62 min: An Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> goal, you feel, 
would really trouble Korea. They are pushing for it:

60 min: Kalaf runs about 40m across field but Korea are content to shadow him, 
driving him towards the sideline like sheep dogs with diplomas. Kalaf is forced 
to turn and look inside and it all fizzles out.
 
58 min: More jitters from Korea at the back, and a poor clearance from the 
keeper put them under all sorts butIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> can’t capitalise. Makes you wonder 
how Korea haven’t conceded so far this tournament. Iraq’s pressing has led to 
some mistakes. Take note Australia. I mean, UAE.
 
56 min: Two great chances to Korea! First Kim Sung-Yueng stings the hands of 
Hassan from range, before Son Heung-min gets an even better chance. But again 
Hassan is equal to it, pushing it away to his right.
 
55 min: Young-Gwon gets a vital touch to kick away a dangerous cross heading 
right for Mahmood standing in space in the Korean area.
 
53 min: Abdul Zahra finds space on the right, skips inside the defence and 
tries to find a teammate in space near the penalty spot, but Korea swarm on the 
cross and clear the ball, not without a tremor.
 
52 min: Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> are looking long odds 
now, and remember they’ve had a day’s less rest than Korea. It will take some 
effort to pull this out of the fire.
 
50 min: From a deflected cross that looped high in the air Lee Jeong-Hyeop 
chested it down in order to take a snap right-foot shot from the edge of the D. 
But he didn’t drop it at his feet, rather at the feet of Kim Young-Gwon who 
propped on his right and put his left boot through it. It took a deflection en 
route and beat Hassan on his left. Nice strike.
 
Korea take a mighty step towards the final!

48 min: He’ll get roasted for that later but Korea keeper Kim Jin-Hyeon, in 
pursuit of a through-ball on the left, ends up marking Yasin, I think it was, 
on the left touchline. ButIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> 
couldn’t find a way to get a shot off sparing Jin-Hyeon’s blushes. That was the 
worst of Bruce Grobbelaar.
 
46 min: And already Korea have resumed their dominance of possession, helped 
when Mahmood gives away a free-kick by pushing his opponent over, playground 
style, as they contest a ball.
 
Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> get us underway as some 
Australia Day fireworks twinkle off in the distance.

Peeeeep! And that’s oranges. Korea have dominated on the whole but in the last 
10 minutes of that half they’ve looked nervy and they might have conceded an 
equaliser hadIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iraq> been more 
clinical. Back in a bit.
 
45 min + 1: A late chance for a Korean second before the break. Free-kick from 
just to the right of centre, 25 yards out. Son Heung-min lines it up and, using 
all his experience with Bayer Leverkusen, hits the wall. This tournament has 
lacked some spectacular dead ball goals, hasn’t it?
 
45 min: Mahmood and Park Joo-ho square up when a hefty Mahmood tackle leaves 
the Korean squished up against the advertising hoardings like a thrown tomato. 
No foul, says the ref. As you were lads.
 
44 min: Yes, Korea are shaky! A backward header to his keeper by Kwak Tae-Hwi 
fails to take into account Abdul Zahra lurking in behind him. The Iraqi should 
have taken a shot in hindsight but he looked to square to Mahmood. Mahmood 
couldn’t get on the end of it, however, so a great chance went begging.
 
43 min: And now Kalaf get off a shot from the edge of the box! But Kim 
Jin-Hyeon gets down low to his right and turns it away for a corner. Just as 
well, as Abdul Zahra was on the scene ready to tap in on the rebound.
 
42 min: A nice one-two on the right between Abdul Zahra and Kalaf falls to 
Mahmood but just as he tries to get a shot in it’s nipped away. Korea looking a 
tad shaky here before the break.
