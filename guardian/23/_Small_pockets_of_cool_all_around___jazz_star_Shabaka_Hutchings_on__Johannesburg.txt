The first time I realised there was something going on musically in South 
Africa was 2008, when I went there to play with a Nigerian afrobeat band called 
Ayetoro <https://www.facebook.com/ayetorolive/>. Before, when I thought about 
South Africa my mind immediately went to the old greats, such asAbdullah Ibrahim
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWY8Qa-3Nbo> or Hugh Masekela 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/mar/04/hugh-masekela-interview-mandela-corruption>
; but all of a sudden I realised there was a big scene, with younger musicians 
doing great stuff. I had to go back.

For the past four years I’ve been going to South Africa twice a year, to 
Johannesburg <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/johannesburg> and Cape Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/capetown>, for a couple of months at a 
time. I met a girl from South Africa and we started a long-distance 
relationship; that’s when I started going back. I would start playing with 
musicians there and trying to put on my own gigs. That’s where I met most of 
the players who appear on my new album [Wisdom of Elders].

Johannesburg musicians have a restless energy. It’s a big city and not as 
picturesque or tranquil as Cape Town; coming from London it’s more like what 
I’m used to.

The city is strange because it feels quite cold, architecturally. There are 
lots of city blocks. There’s not an area like Dalston or Shoreditch, there are 
just small pockets of cool things to do all around.

In South Africa it’s like the audience is a part of the band. If I look at it 
through the lens of jazz, it looks like people are really receptive to 
performers giving everything they have. It’s as if someone is there with you 
while you’re on stage – like a hype man, or a personal trainer.

Johannesburg has a lot of creative startups and music initiatives at a 
grassroots level. Friends of mine who play free jazz run an event called Avant 
Guarde at King Kong in Jeppestown: the audience listens to avant garde jazz 
records and a band plays afterwards.

 Hanging out at Afrikan Freedom Station. Photograph: Thabo Sixishe 
Afrikan Freedom Station <http://afrikanfreedomstation.withtank.com/> is 
probably my favourite venue. It’s a tiny place – just a room with a small PA – 
but it gets in creative musicians. It’s based around jazz, but not necessarily 
jazz in that very straight, stiff way. It’s run by a guy called Steve Kwena 
Mokwena, a visual artist and writer. He’s got art pieces upstairs and live 
music downstairs. It’s where I played the first gig with my band, the 
Ancestors, the day before we recorded. It has a real special energy.

The Orbit <http://www.theorbit.co.za/> was, I think, the first dedicated jazz 
club in Johannesburg, in the classic jazz model. In the UK we’re used to places 
like that, but I guess over there to have jazz played six nights a week is a 
special thing. There’s still a vibe at The Orbit … a real atmosphere.

 A band onstage at The Orbit. Photograph: Tawedzerwa Zhou 
I’ve seen a couple of amazing shows at the Curiocity Backpackers hostel 
<http://curiocitybackpackers.com/joburg.html>. One was a band called the 
Brother Moves On who I play with when they tour the UK.

At Newtown Junction <http://www.newtownjunctionmall.co.za/> you’ll find a lot 
of independent fashion shops. One brand, MaXhosa by Laduma 
<http://www.maxhosa.co.za/>, makes clothes in traditional Xhosa patterns – 
knitwear, normally. It’s very beautiful.

It’s a strange thing that the city itself is perceived as so violent, because 
people in Johannesburg are so warm and open. I definitely found that; you might 
be waiting in a line, or riding a taxi, and you’ll have a great chat with 
someone.

One musician to check out if you’re visiting is Tumi Mogorosi 
<https://www.facebook.com/Tumi-Mogorosi-459074930840082/> – he’s the drummer on 
our album.Then there’s the singer, Siyabonga Mthembu, and an amazing trombonist 
and singer who’s not on the album – though I wish she was – calledSiya Makuzeni 
<https://en-gb.facebook.com/Siya-Makuzeni-315189533984/>. Her music is jazz 
based, and her songs are incredible. It’s a special experience to see her play.
