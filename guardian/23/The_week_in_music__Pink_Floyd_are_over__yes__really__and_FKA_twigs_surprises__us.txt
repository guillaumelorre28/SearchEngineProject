The people who saw Smith’s set at Glastonbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/28/patti-smith-at-glastonbury-2015-review-punk-rage-dalai-lama>
 in June have probably only just emotionally recovered, but the musician and 
poet has more material on the way. She’s due to co-write and co-produce a 
Showtime TV mini-series based on her memoir, Just Kids. Don’t hurt us too much, 
Patti. Please.

Prince announced an exclusive Tidal album release 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/07/prince-release-hitnrun-album-exclusively-via-tidal>

I thought Prince hated just about anything related to digital music, but he 
may be willing to make an exception for Tidal. He’s set to release new album, 
Hitnrun, on the artist-owned music streaming service next month. But don’t 
worry, he’s sticking to his classic stances elsewhere: just this week, he once 
againlikened a record contract to slavery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/history-prince-contractual-controversy-warner-paisley-park>
. That’s the Prince we all know and love.

Janelle Monáe led a #BlackLivesMatter rally in Philadelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/janelle-monae-leads-protest-against-police-brutality-philadelphia>


Monáe has been singing about alien overlords and intergalactic rebellions for 
years, so it’s no surprise that she’d take to the streets on good old planet 
Earth. The singer-songwriter and producer and labelmate Jidenna led chants and 
marched through north Philadelphia on a rally celebrating “black joy”. She’s 
also officially recorded a protest song,Hell You Talmbout 
<https://soundcloud.com/wondalandarts/hell-you-talmbout>, in the wake of the 
rally.

Phil Rudd really wants his band back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/phil-rudd-claims-going-to-be-back-in-acdc>

It seems no amount of arrests or court appearances will keep Rudd away from 
AC/DC. The members of his band seemed to havemanaged just fine without him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/ac-dc-review-wembley-stadium-essence-of-rock-and-roll>
, recruiting Chris Slade as a replacement drummer on tour in Europe and North 
America, but Rudd is determined to return. “Chris Slade’s a good drummer, but 
I’ve got no idea what he’s doing up there,” Rudd said in an interview. “Trust 
me, I know what I’m talking about. I got nothing against Chris. It’s just he 
hasn’t got a permanent job. I hope!”

Dave Gilmour stated the obvious and said Pink Floyd are done 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/14/pink-floyd-are-done-says-dave-gilmour>

On the flipside of the classic rock-band coin, Gilmour made it sound as though 
the last thing he wanted was a Pink Floyd reunion. Of course, without Syd 
Barrett and Richard Wright it wouldn’treally be Pink Floyd, but Gilmour thought 
it might be best to lay to rest any niggling reunion rumours. “I accept there 
are people who want to go and see and hear this legend that wasPink Floyd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd>, but I’m afraid that’s not my 
responsibility,” Gilmour said, in a radio interview. It’s really over, guys.

FKA twigs surprise-released an EP and a 16-minute video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/14/fka-twigs-surprise-releases-m3ll155x-ep-and-short-film>

FKA twigs <https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs> has momentarily 
deviated from her previous albums’ numbering system. She suddenly put out a 
third EP on Friday morning, but didn’t call it EP3 – rather, it’s called the 
SEO-friendly M3LL155X. I can only assume that’s the cool internet spelling of 
Mellissa, like “Chvrches” for churches or “Ho99o9” rather than Horror. 
Whatever. In any case, twigs padded out the ticking, jittery five-track EP with 
a 16-minute short film that’s as beautiful as her past visual work.

Cobain: Montage of Heck’s soundtrack is due out in November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/kurt-cobain-montage-heck-film-soundtrack-november-release>

Am I the only one who feels as though Nirvana-related news has cropped up 
every couple of weeks <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain> for the 
last year? That may be an exaggeration, but the slow trickle of archival 
content unearthed by Brett Morgen’s Montage of Heck documentary continues with 
an official release date for the film’s soundtrack. There’s no tracklisting 
yet, but at least we now know we’ll be able to hear Kurt’s demos (and 
apparently his comedy skit) from 6 November.

A new study claims music can make surgery less painful

You’re one playlist away from a slightly less painful recovery after 
undergoing surgery,according to a recent study 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/13/hospital-surgery-playlist-open-thread>
. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London analysed about 70 trials 
that included approximately 7,000 patients, and found that blissing out to 
music before, during and after surgery can help a patient experience less 
post-op pain and anxiety. Unfortunately, playing some tunes won’t shorten the 
average patient’s recovery time. Music can do great things, but it can’t yet 
perform medical miracles.

There’s an Arcade Fire album documentary on the way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/11/arcade-fire-the-reflektor-tapes-first-look-trailer>

In other music doc news, indie darlings Arcade Fire premiered the trailer for 
The Reflektor Tapes this week. The film, due out worldwide on 24 September, is 
set to chart the process behind making the band’s Grammy-nominated album, 
Reflektor. By the looks of things, there’s footage from Haiti, Jamaica and 
various behind-the-scenes shots on tour. The jury is out among Guardian readers 
on whether Arcade Fire are overrated or exceptionally talented, if the comments
here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/11/arcade-fire-the-reflektor-tapes-first-look-trailer#comments>
 are anything to go by.

 Arcade Fire: the Reflektor Tapes film trailer 
A Swedish folk festival squared up to fascists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/09/sweden-folk-musicians-against-racism-fmr>

Ah, the Swedish folk music scene. It surely makes you think of full skirts 
over woolly stockings and plucked fiddle lines rolling on a summer breeze – but 
how about firmly anti-fascist ideals, borne out in impassioned demonstrations? 
Musicians from the organisation Folk Musicians Against Racism staged a 
“play-in” against a far-right political party at Stockholm’s folk festival last 
weekend. That’s one way to stoke a fire in the belly of a genre that most of us 
find increasingly placid.
