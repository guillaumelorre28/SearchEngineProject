And the world record for the largest number of bylines on a single story goes 
to theNew York Times, which used no fewer than 16 journalists to write its 
obituary ofFidel Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro>, a 
labour it began in 1959 and has constantly updated ever since.

It is inevitable, perhaps, that the obit of a great world figure should be the 
winner here, but inevitable, too, that a few eyebrows be raised over the sheer 
extent of the coverage of Castro’s end.

Had he died in 1989, 1999 or even 2009, all those pages turned and TV hours 
filled would be understandable. But the Castro issues now are essentially 
retrospective – just as the issues for the regime he left behind are 
essentially unknowable. So many words, so many pictures – because of so many 
years to prepare them?
