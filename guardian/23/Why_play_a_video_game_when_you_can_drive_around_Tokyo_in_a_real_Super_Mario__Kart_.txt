Tyres screech. Children scream. Men cry … I’m causing a scene on the streets 
of Tokyo. Perhaps it’s my shiny modified ride, all flashing indicators and 
gutsy exhaust. Or my cool ensemble of blue dungarees, tomato-red top and 
oversized cap. Or maybe it’s my new moustache, dangling limply from my sweaty 
upper lip.

For today, and for one day only, just call me Mario. Super Mario 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/super-mario>, in fact – gaming icon and 
the planet’s most-cherished Italian plumber. Over the next three hours I’m 
touring the neighbourhoods of Tokyo in a pimped-up, road-ready go kart.

Hot on the heels of Pokemon Go, coming to a mobile screen near you this 
December, is Nintendo’s latest game,Super Mario Run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/iphone-7-launch-nintendo-super-mario-run-game>
. And if, like me, you’re tragically into the characters, you can skid around 
Tokyo’s sights and streets dressed up as your favourite star.

 Hannah dressed as Mario and her boyfriend as his sidekick, Luigi 
My boyfriend – bless his blue and pea-green jumpsuit – has agreed to ride 
along as Mario’s sidekick, Luigi. Forget roleplay, we’re all about the cosplay. 
It’s a thing here. We’re taking a private tour, but group bookings are 
available: Princess Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong – the whole crew can join in the 
fun.

We begin in suitably “geeky” Akihabara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/01/charlie-brooker-tokyo-japan-games>
, where shops are crammed with gadgets and speakers scream out Japanese pop. 
After a brief safety demo we’re off, our guide Kuzuoka leading, then me, with 
Luigi at the rear. A group of American tourists stops us at the lights. “You’re 
going to be more famous than David Hasselholff,” they shriek.

The crowds start to descend minutes later. As we cruise the highway, skimming 
along the grounds of the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace, runners lapping 
the park stop mid-stride, briefcase-carrying men beg us for a wave and drivers 
pull over attempting a through-the-window selfie.

If Tokyo makes you think of a traffic-crammed metropolis, you have a new 
perspective 10cm off the tarmac at a breezy 40mph. Cars give us space, and we 
navigate peaceful back streets.

On to the big sights, including the one of the world’s busiest junction’s, the 
famous Shibuya scramble crossing. The lights change and we floor it, nipping 
beneath the neon-lit buildings to a raucous applause from open-mouthed 
onlookers.

Next up is Harajuku, the fashion hangout where kookily dressed teens usually 
pose for pictures. Not today. As we crawl through tree-lined Omotesando Avenue, 
well-heeled shoppers emerge from Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hugo Boss, whooping 
as we return their waves.

The language barrier keeps conversation short and vaguely snappy: “Karting, it 
tires,” Kuzuoka tells me, via Google Translate on his phone. He’s right. Even 
my costume can’t hack the pace; as we cross the final flyover my moustache 
takes off, landing on the windscreen of the car behind.

A fully versed city tour this is not – but who needs the big sights? Trust me, 
in Tokyo it’s better to be the main attraction.
