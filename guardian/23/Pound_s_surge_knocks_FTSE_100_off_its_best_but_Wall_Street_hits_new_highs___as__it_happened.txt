European markets edge higher

A rising oil price, along with political developments in France and Germany, 
has helped push European stock markets into positive territory on the first 
trading day of the week.

The prospect that Francois Fillon could beat Marine Le Pen in next year’s 
French presidential election has given investors some comfort, as has Angela 
Merkel’s announcement she was running for a fourth term as German chancellor.

Meanwhile the climb in crude, based on growing hopes that Opec would reach an 
agreement on limiting output at its meeting next week, has lifted commodity 
companies, while dollar weakness has also helped.

But London shares slipped back from their highs after a bounce in sterling - 
the leading UK index is full of exporters and overseas earners who benefit from 
a weak pound. The currency responded to supposed hints from UK prime minister 
Theresa May about a Brexit transition deal.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up just 2.19 points or 0.03% at 6777.96 
 * Germany’s Dax was 0.19% higher at 10,685.13 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4529.58 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.19% to 16,297.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 0.1% down at 8614.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 615.83 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 0.4%, 
hovering around a new peak of 18947. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also recorded 
new highs.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

On the effect of the US election on the euro area economic outlook, Draghi 
said it is too early too now.

But he said, as with the UK referendum vote, the reaction in the markets was 
significant to start with, but then muted. Markets have shown their resilience, 
helped by the actions of in the first case the Bank of England, then the ECB.

But clearly these changes have a long term impact which difficult to assess 
and in the case of the UK, depends on the shape of negotiations and the length 
of time it takes to find an agreement.

ECB president Mario Draghi is now responding to the comments of MEPs.

He says he understands the concerns about the bank’s unconventional measures, 
and says there are some risks. But he says they do not see an asset price 
bubble developing.

He said the risks are for the time being contained “but we watch them closely.”

Low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation around 
the world, he said, not the creation of the ECB. Policy rates have to be low to 
stimulate growth.

By and large, regarding the negative rate situation , the benefits outweigh 
the disadvantages.

Our monetary policy is by and large the same as in the US, UK and Japan, says 
Draghi.

He denies that the bank is overstepping its mandate (as was suggested by 
several MEPs).

Meanwhile, while ECB president Mario Draghi is listening to the various 
comments - often negative - on the bank’s annual report, executive board member 
Benoît Cœuré has also been speaking.

According to Reuters, he said that at some point the ECB would scale down its 
stimulus programme but not yet. And there was never any discussion about buying 
stocks as part of the QE programme.

Draghi repeats calls for government action to boost growth

European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has defended the bank’s monetary 
policy actions once more, and repeated his calls for governments to step up 
their own reforms to boost growth.

And he said the bank needed to continue its supportive policies to bring 
inflation close to its target.

In a speech to the European Parliament relating to the ECB’s annual report 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161121_1.en.html>, he 
said challenges had increased since his last session there in February. [Brexit 
for a start, one would think].

But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global 
uncertainty, partly due to the ECB’s actions:

The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. 
It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties 
emanating from the global environment...

Our monetary policy measures since June 2014­ have been a key factor behind 
these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing 
operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery...

Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We 
also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At 
the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price 
dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors 
related to the stabilisation of oil prices.

Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the 
continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite 
of the gradual closing of the output gap.

It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very 
substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained 
convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium 
term.

But then he called for further action elsewhere:

However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive 
action from other policy areas.

In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are 
holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right 
policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges 
and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area...

The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. 
This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve 
the business environment...

Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while 
remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For 
instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost 
growth.

The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also 
pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial 
analyst at Spreadex, said:

After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel’s 
announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon’s 
right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le 
Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might 
be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden 
movement, it appears that May’s (attempted) reassurances that the government is 
working to avoid a Brexit ‘cliff edge’ for businesses, comments that perhaps 
suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling’s resurgence.

And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher 
against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the 
latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the 
red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite 
the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement 
the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively.

The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar’s dip this Monday (the greenback 
maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 
points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though 
without much actual momentum to push it any higher.

A rising oil price, along with political developments in France and Germany, 
has helped push European stock markets into positive territory on the first 
trading day of the week.

The prospect that Francois Fillon could beat Marine Le Pen in next year’s 
French presidential election has given investors some comfort, as has Angela 
Merkel’s announcement she was running for a fourth term as German chancellor.

Meanwhile the climb in crude, based on growing hopes that Opec would reach an 
agreement on limiting output at its meeting next week, has lifted commodity 
companies, while dollar weakness has also helped.

But London shares slipped back from their highs after a bounce in sterling - 
the leading UK index is full of exporters and overseas earners who benefit from 
a weak pound. The currency responded to supposed hints from UK prime minister 
Theresa May about a Brexit transition deal.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up just 2.19 points or 0.03% at 6777.96 
 * Germany’s Dax was 0.19% higher at 10,685.13 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4529.58 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.19% to 16,297.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 0.1% down at 8614.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 615.83 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 0.4%, 
hovering around a new peak of 18947. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also recorded 
new highs.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
On the effect of the US election on the euro area economic outlook, Draghi 
said it is too early too now.

But he said, as with the UK referendum vote, the reaction in the markets was 
significant to start with, but then muted. Markets have shown their resilience, 
helped by the actions of in the first case the Bank of England, then the ECB.

But clearly these changes have a long term impact which difficult to assess 
and in the case of the UK, depends on the shape of negotiations and the length 
of time it takes to find an agreement.

ECB president Mario Draghi is now responding to the comments of MEPs.

He says he understands the concerns about the bank’s unconventional measures, 
and says there are some risks. But he says they do not see an asset price 
bubble developing.

He said the risks are for the time being contained “but we watch them closely.”

Low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation around 
the world, he said, not the creation of the ECB. Policy rates have to be low to 
stimulate growth.

By and large, regarding the negative rate situation , the benefits outweigh 
the disadvantages.

Our monetary policy is by and large the same as in the US, UK and Japan, says 
Draghi.

He denies that the bank is overstepping its mandate (as was suggested by 
several MEPs).
 
Here’s the full Reuters report 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-coeure-idUKKBN13G1ZF> on the

buying stocks as part of its QE programme.

Meanwhile, while ECB president Mario Draghi is listening to the various 
comments - often negative - on the bank’s annual report, executive board member 
Benoît Cœuré has also been speaking.

According to Reuters, he said that at some point the ECB would scale down its 
stimulus programme but not yet. And there was never any discussion about buying 
stocks as part of the QE programme.
 
A number of MEPs are lining up to point out the problems in the eurozone and

policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges 
and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area...

The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. 
This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve 
the business environment...

Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while 
remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For 
instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost 
growth.
 
The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also 
pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial 
analyst at Spreadex, said:

After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel’s 
announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon’s 
right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le 
Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might 
be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden 
movement, it appears that May’s (attempted) reassurances that the government is 
working to avoid a Brexit ‘cliff edge’ for businesses, comments that perhaps 
suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling’s resurgence.

And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher 
against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the 
latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the 
red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite 
the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement 
the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively.

The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar’s dip this Monday (the greenback 
maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 
points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though 
without much actual momentum to push it any higher.
