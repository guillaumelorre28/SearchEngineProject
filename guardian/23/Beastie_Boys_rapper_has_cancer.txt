Adam Yauch, better known as MCA from the Beastie Boys, has revealed he has 
been diagnosed with cancer. Speaking alongside fellow band member Ad-Rock via a 
video broadcast on theBeastie Boys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beastie-boys> website earlier today, Yauch 
explained he has "a form of cancer in the gland that's over here (points to 
neck), the Parotid gland. It's also in a lymph node right in that area." The 
44-year-old then went on to say: "I'm actually going to have to have surgery, 
probably next week, and after that some radiation."

His treatment will result in the cancellation of "a bunch of shows" and the 
postponement of the Beastie Boys' forthcoming album, Hot Sauce Committee, which 
was scheduled for release in September of this year.

The Beastie Boys rose to fame in the mid-80s with their debut album Licensed 
to Ill and established a reputation for their punkish, frat boy style. The New 
York based trio have enjoyed continued critical and commercial success, notably 
with their 1993 album Ill Communication, having evolved into one of the most 
innovative and creative rap groups still performing.

Yauch ended the message on an upbeat note, explaining that the cancer was 
treatable. "The good news is that it's only localised in this one area, and 
it's not in a place that effects my voice... so it's a pain in the ass and a 
setback, but it's treatable in most cases." The rapper also apologised to fans 
who were looking forward to their forthcoming live dates.

An update on Yauch's condition and the band's cancelled shows is expected in 
the near future.
