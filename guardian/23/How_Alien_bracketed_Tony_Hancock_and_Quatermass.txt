Clifford Hatts (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/04/clifford-hatts>, 25 
September) designed many memorable productions for BBC Television,including 
Quatermass and the Pit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36267/quatermass-and-the-pit>. I wonder 
if he was also involved in what for me was more memorable – Hancock and the 
Pit, a spoof of the sci-fi serial.

I particularly recall an exchange in which Tony Hancock asks Sid James what he 
would do if an alien appeared. James says he would give it“a punch up the 
bracket” 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/tony-hancock-20-great-quotes/a-punch-up-the-bracket/>
. “Has it occurred to you,” retorts Hancock, “that a Martian might not have a 
bracket to be punched up?”

The fact, as you report, that Ridley Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott> was one of Hatts’ disciples 
leads me to speculate that this might have subconciously inspired the Alien 
franchise. The monster of the Nostromo was demonstrably without a bracket.
