Like millions of Americans, on Monday Anna Gunn watched Michelle Obama’s 
endorsement of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-democratic-national-convention-speech>
 at the Democratic convention in complete awe. “I made it up to my room just in 
time to see it and I thought, ‘Yes!’” the actor says, her eyes shining.

It’s the day after the first lady made her stirring plea to voters, and a 
happy, relaxed Gunn is seated in a posh hotel suite in New York. “I was 
applauding and shouting back at the TV. It was just so exciting.”

Equity review: hotly toxic tale of women on Wall Street is a greedy treat

Gunn has reason to be doubly revved-up. Equity 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3958780/reference>, her first film since 
completing five seasons on Breaking Bad, opens on Friday, months after 
premiering toenthusiastic reviews at the Sundance film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/equity-review-hotly-toxic-tale-of-women-on-wall-street-is-a-greedy-treat>
. Given Clinton’s recent historic clinching of the Democratic nomination, the 
timing for Gunn – an avid Clinton supporter – couldn’t be sweeter.

Equity, you see, is an anomaly in Hollywood: not only does it boast an 
all-female core creative team, including producer co-stars Sarah Megan Thomas 
and Alysia Reiner, screenwriter Amy Fox and director Meera Menon; it’s also the 
first financial thriller in which women call the shots.

“I really did like The Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/wolf-of-wall-street-review>,” 
Gunn says, looking almost guilty. “But not seeing women represented in that 
world, it definitely had less resonance for me.”

In Equity, Gunn plays Naomi Bishop, an ambitious senior investment banker. At 
the outset of Menon’s sleek and arresting film, Bishop is reeling from a recent 
deal gone sour because her client had a last-minute change of heart. Bishop 
asks why, and is told: “You rub people the wrong way.” As a result, her snide 
male boss overlooks her for a deserved promotion, forcing her to latch on to 
the public offering of a new viral media privacy app that could help her score 
big, and put her back on top.

“For women, no matter what career, what path you choose, it’s still an uphill 
battle to work your way up to these top leadership positions,” Gunn says. “And 
you’re much more closely scrutinized for everything – for things that men are 
not. Now, because of this time [we’re in], it’s a much broader conversation 
really. We really wanted to not only talk about women in Wall Street but women 
in all positions of life.”


The world of trading was somewhat familiar to Gunn before making the film, 
because her father once worked as a stockbroker. To beef up on her finance 
knowledge, Gunn spent time shadowing a number of Wall Street’s top female 
bosses, some of whom are executive producers on Equity.


Gunn, however, didn’t need much assistance to get inside the mind of a 
powerful woman battling institutional sexism in her profession. Being a 
successful female actor in Hollywood, Gunn knows all too well what it’s like to 
be routinely put under the microscope.

After winning her first Emmy in 2013 for playing Skyler White (she won a 
second for the show’s final season), the long-suffering wife to Bryan 
Cranston’s drug kingpin husband Walter White, Gunn was barely given a moment to 
revel in her achievement, before having to talk about her weight in public 
after publications such as theDaily Mail,  
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2537476/Gaunt-Anna-Gunn-barely-recognisable-Breaking-Bad-days-kicks-shows-final-awards-season-AFI-Awards-luncheon.html>
described her appearance as “worryingly thin”. Talking toPeople magazine 
<https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwju4cSRsZTOAhVDLyYKHZVtBjkQFgg6MAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Fmobile%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20304925_20737906%2C00.html&usg=AFQjCNH83C9sP4qhtKcLMnWisrfz0qUXQA&sig2=HxATthYll2J3tLxeSYOZJw>
, Gunn explained that while filming the show, she was on medication that caused 
her to gain weight, and that she’s simply back to her old, fitter self. “I run 
around after two kids – and I do pilates,” she said at the time.

“I reached a career high, and all the questions were not about what I put into 
the world, but more about how I looked,” Gunn recalls. “That was disturbing. I 
didn’t even want to really comment on it, because why should you? Why should I 
have to explain myself? But I got tired of being asked about it.”

At the same time, Gunn also endured attacks from fans of Breaking Bad, 
incensed by the reluctance of her character to accept her husband’s double-life 
cheerfully. The online vitriol got so intense that Gunn felt compelled to pen 
an opinion column that ran in theNew York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/opinion/i-have-a-character-issue.html>, in 
which she directly addressed the troubling nature of Skyler’s unpopularity.

“My character, to judge from the popularity of websites and Facebook pages 
devoted to hating her, has become a flash point for many people’s feelings 
about strong, non-submissive, ill-treated women,” she wrote. “Because Skyler 
didn’t conform to a comfortable ideal of the archetypical female, she had 
become a kind of Rorschach test for society, a measure of our attitudes toward 
gender.”

Looking back on that troubling episode, Gunn shares that the “personal 
attacks” are what hurt the most.

“It went from disliking the character, then hating the character, to then 
hating me. It became about not liking the way I look: I’m either too thin; I’ve 
gained too much weight; I’m too tall; they don’t like my face; they don’t like 
my voice. To be picked apart in that way is brutal.

“Skyler was demonized as a character – and I was demonized as the actor 
playing her,” she continues. “It’s the same thing I think women in any 
profession who are rising to the top endure: they get scrutinized more closely 
and more harshly than men do.”

Equity: the cast and crew on the women of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/25/equity-movie-cast-women-wall-street-video>
Gunn says she sympathizes with Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, who recently 
endured even harsher racist and misogynist abuse on Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/18/leslie-jones-racist-tweets-ghostbusters>
.

“It made me angry,” Gunn says of the slurs hurled at Jones. “It makes me sad. 
Whoever has the time to be sitting down and writing all that stuff, I don’t 
know what kind of life that is, but it doesn’t seem like a great life to me.”

Jones didn’t cave in to her attackers by leaving Twitter; nor did Gunn retreat 
from the spotlight, even after receiving what she describes as a death threat 
from a female Twitter user, who wrote: “I want to find out where Anna Gunn 
lives, so I can kill her.”

Gunn likens the gender-targeted venom to the some of the attacks made on 
Clinton by her opposers. “I just have to silence the TV sometimes because it’s 
just overwhelming,” she says, sighing heavily.

For that reason, she says she found the experience of making Equity, a 
female-empowering project, “extraordinarily liberating”.

“It’s important for women to continue to break through barriers in our 
industry, in politics, in Wall Street,” she says. “And now that I have two 
daughters, that’s even more important.

“My mom told me I could do anything I want, be anyone I want. I believed it. 
And so I want my daughters to as well.”
