Alex Higgins <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alex-higgins> has deferred his 
much publicised return to competition after a five-year absence by withdrawing 
from his first-round match in the qualifying competition for the Benson & 
Hedges Masters next Wednesday.

The two-times world champion requires urgent and extensive dental work, a 
bi-product from his treatment during his battles with cancer of the palate and 
the throat.

Higgins, who was due to play the 22-year-old Lee Spick in Mansfield, has paid 
his £200 entry fee for the pre-qualifying stage of the Embassy world 
championship in Harrogate at the end of November, but there is some scepticism 
as to whether his comeback will ever leave the launch pad.

The prospect of a decisive battle in snooker's civil war looms next month when 
the 78 players with full voting rights ballot at an EGM of the World 
Professional Billiards andSnooker <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> 
Association on a resolution to remove its entire board. The requisition has 
been put forward by Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry and has been coordinated by 
Terry Griffiths. The meeting will be held at a hotel in Shifnal, Shropshire on 
November 13, coinciding with the scheduled start of play of the British Open in 
nearby Telford.

This week the WPBSA announced that a new company, World Snooker Enterprises, 
has been appointed to manage its commercial rights.

"This does not address underlying problems like the lack of outside investment 
in the game," said Griffiths, who if successful at the EGM will form part of a 
new board looking to reopen negotiations with Altium, a company prepared to 
invest an initial £2.5m in the sport.
