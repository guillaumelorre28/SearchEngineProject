The makers of Fast and Furious 7 are considering the use of CGI and body 
doubles to complete scenes starring the late Paul Walker which were left 
unfinished, according to theNew York Daily News 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/fast-furious-7-double-time-walker-article-1.1728704>
.

Studio Universal may also make use of voice effects in some cases where audio 
for Walker's character Brian O'Conner is unavailable. The film is due to 
recommence shooting in Abu Dhabi early next month, more than four months after 
the 40-year-old actor was killed in a car crash.

An unnamed production source told the News: "They have hired four actors with 
bodies very similar to Paul's physique and they will be used for movement and 
as a base. Paul's face and voice will be used on top using CGI."

Universal has refused to confirm the report, according to the Hollywood 
Reporter <http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fast-furious-7-cgi-may-690418>. 
It had previously been thought director James Wan would make use of existing 
footage to complete the film. Screenwriter Chris Morgan was said to be working 
on a script change in which Walker's character was retired during the movie, 
instead of being killed off as had originally been planned.

Walker died on 30 November  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash>when 
the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burst into flames in Santa Clarita, 
southern California. The actor had been on hiatus from a shoot in Atlanta.

Fast and Furious 7, also starring series stalwarts Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson 
and Michelle Rodriguez, has been delayed from July this year to April 2015.
