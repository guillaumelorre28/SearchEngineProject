Closing post: Pound profits after surprise US election

After a momentous week, Wall Street seems to have simply run out of energy.

The Dow Jones index is virtually flat now, up 0.02%, while the S&P 500 and the 
Nasdaq are slightly in the red. Traders are taking a breather, and watching 
political events unfold.

And there’s plenty happening -- the latest news is that vice-president in 
waiting Mike Pence has just been appointed to lead the Trump transition team, 
instead of Chris Christie.

Our US politics liveblog has all the details:

Pound has a good week against the euro

As currency traders head home, or to the nearest City winebar, they can 
reflect on the pound’s unexpected strength this week.

As this chart shows, sterling has gained more than 3% against the single 
currency this week, from €1.12 to around €1.16.
The pound vs the euro this week 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-11T18:10:42/embed.html>
There’s an argument that people are hoping that Brexit will be easier with 
Trump in the White House.

But I think the pound is really benefitting from worries about Europe. Italy’s 
constitutional referendum next month, or the French and German elections in 
2017, could all undermine the eurozone.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says:

Fears of the rising political right in the Eurozone and potential US 
instability once Trump takes over are crucially helping to put Brexit on the 
back-burner for the time being.

The US government bond market is closed today for Veterans Day.

And bond traders should enjoy the rest while they can - Treasuries will surely 
be volatile next week too, as the clock ticks towards Donald Trump’s 
inauguration.

Capital Economics’ Julian Jessop predicts further losses, as the markets try 
to price in the prospect of a new infrastructure spending programme financed by 
debt.

He writes:

The election results mean that there may now be a big fiscal expansion, which 
adds to the downside risks for bonds for at least two reasons. First, it would 
increase their supply. Second, we think it would mainly boost inflation rather 
than growth.

Jessop also suspects that the Wall Street rally will fizzle out, as investors 
focus their minds on possible trade wars under President Trump.

For a start, the strong performance of some sectors (such as industrials, 
basic materials and energy) has reflected hopes for a big splurge on 
infrastructure spending, which we think is unlikely – most of the fiscal 
stimulus is likely to take the form of tax cuts.Stock markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> do not tend to fare well 
when inflation is rising either.

And investors may start to worry again soon about the implications for growth 
of Trump’s other proposals, such as trade tariffs.

There’s no respite for the Mexican economy, I’m afraid.

Its government bonds are weakening again, driving up yields, and the peso is

European markets end week with losses

The Trump Jump we saw in the immediate aftermath of this week’s presidential 
election has hit a hump.

London’s FTSE 100 has suffered another day of chunky losses, closing down 97 
points, or almost 1.5%.

The stronger pound is partly to blame; sterling is up 0.5% right not over 
$1.26.

 Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains that Brexit anxiety has faded 
this week.

If FTSE bulls were emboldened by Wednesday’s incredible fightback to regain 
the 7000 mark, they will be feeling somewhat weary today, as the UK benchmark 
suffered substantial losses amid a comprehensive recovery for sterling.

The pound was expected to rise on last week’s realisation that Article 50 is 
now in the hands of Brexit-sceptic MPs, and with the US election now out of the 
way, we are seeing that pound rebound take shape. Much like a weakening euro 
was perceived to be good for UK stocks, today’s pound rally is doing little to 
help the FTSE, which has suffered more than most.

Most other European stock markets also closed in the red, and Wall Street is 
still down

, analysts believe Europe will suffer if Trump does manage to boostUS growth 
through tax cuts and a spending boost.

Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says:

The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of 
international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for 
corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets.

The City is also concerned by the heavy losses in the bond market this week 
<https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/796983323256061952/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
, which wiped out around $1trn. That, funnily enough, is also how much has been 
added to the US equities market this week, according to Bloomberg.

Buffett: Wealth inequality drove some voters to Trump
 Photograph: Warren Buffett 
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says income inequality helped to drive 
Donald Trump to the White House.

In an interview with CNN, Buffett, who has called for tax reform in the past, 
says ordinary Americans feel that wealth distribution is unfair:

The Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] had $93bn dollars in 1982, and 
they’ve got 2.4 trillion dollars today. That’s 25 times as much.

If you’ve been working 40 hours a week, maybe holding a second job and you 
work with the Little League [junior baseball] and you’ve been a good parent, 
and you’re really struggling.

Then you think, “What’s wrong with this picture?”, and you want to change the 
picture.

Buffett, worth an estimated $70bn, also criticises Trump’s criticism of free 
trade, saying protectionism would harm the US economy.

But while Buffett isn’t a fan of Trump, he’s now calling on Americans to back 
the president-elect. Unity, he says, is now crucial, after a particularly 
negative and personal campaign:

It’s every important that the American people coalesce behind a president.

That doesn’t mean they can’t criticise, or disagree with what he’s doing. But 
we need a country unified by a president.

Buffett also warns that Trump can’t deliver on all his pledges, such as 
doubling economic growth.

“Nobody can grow the economy 4% in real terms over time...The math is too 
extraordinary.”

Speaking of Europe... Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom suggested today 
that talks with the US about the controversial TTIP agreement will probably be 
‘frozen’ for a while now.

Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that:

“There will be a natural pause, of course, while we wait for the next 
administration; then, for quite some time TTIP will probably be in the freezer.

Then what happens when it’s defrosted, I think we will need to wait and see.”
Duncan Robinson (@duncanrobinson) 
Malmstrom: "I don’t think we see the resumption of any TTIP negotiation in 
quite a long time.”

The FTSE 100 is now down 116 points, or -1.7%, at 6712. 

Precious metals firms are leading the rout, along with oil companies and major

Germany is defying the global market selloff today, with its DAX index 
slightly higher.

That’s partly thanks to Deutsche Bank, whose shares have surged over 4% today. 
There’s speculation that the German lender has a better chance of negotiating a 
lower penalty with the US Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 
financial crisis.

Deutsche should also benefit from a higher inflation environment; record low 
interest rates have hurt its profitability.

Its share plunged through €10 at the end of September, on fears over its 
financial health. They’re now worth €14.7

Europe’s biggest threat from the Trump presidency is a new trade war that 
scuppers exports and growth, says Kallum Pickering of Germany’s Berenberg bank.

He writes:

Europe earns almost 20% of its GDP from exports, that is 50% more than the US 
[see chart below].

European producers would feel the pinch of a more inward-looking and less 
trade-oriented US. A US shift towards isolationism over the next four years 
that might then be mirrored by other countries is the major economic risk for 
Europe following the Trump victory.

If Trump does what he said in the campaign, namely brand China as a currency 
manipulator and place a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, he could 
trigger a trade war. While Congress would block many of his more extreme policy 
proposals, such a move would badly exacerbate a tilt in the Western world 
against globalisation. Trade oriented economies like those of Europe would lose 
even more from that than the US.

After several days of gains, the US stock market appears to be readjusting to 
the new reality.


Some of the shares that have done best since Donald Trump won the election are 
leading the fallers.

That includes drugs firms Pfizer (-2%) and Merck (-1%), who had posted gains 
after the prospect of a price-gouging clampdown faded with Hillary Clinton’s 
victory chances.

Exxon Mobile is down 1.8% -- it had been another Trump gainer, as the next 
president is relaxed about the dangers of climate change.

And Caterpillar had lost 0.6%; having been driven up by the prospect of new 
orders for its digging machines to help build new American highways, airports 
and schools.

After a momentous week, Wall Street seems to have simply run out of energy.

The Dow Jones index is virtually flat now, up 0.02%, while the S&P 500 and the 
Nasdaq are slightly in the red. Traders are taking a breather, and watching 
political events unfold.

And there’s plenty happening -- the latest news is that vice-president in 
waiting Mike Pence has just been appointed to lead the Trump transition team, 
instead of Chris Christie.

As currency traders head home, or to the nearest City winebar, they can 
reflect on the pound’s unexpected strength this week.

As this chart shows, sterling has gained more than 3% against the single 
currency this week, from €1.12 to around €1.16.
The pound vs the euro this week 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-11T18:10:42/embed.html>
There’s an argument that people are hoping that Brexit will be easier with 
Trump in the White House.

But I think the pound is really benefitting from worries about Europe. Italy’s 
constitutional referendum next month, or the French and German elections in 
2017, could all undermine the eurozone.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says:

Fears of the rising political right in the Eurozone and potential US 
instability once Trump takes over are crucially helping to put Brexit on the 
back-burner for the time being.

The US government bond market is closed today for Veterans Day.

And bond traders should enjoy the rest while they can - Treasuries will surely 
be volatile next week too, as the clock ticks towards Donald Trump’s 
inauguration.

Capital Economics’ Julian Jessop predicts further losses, as the markets try 
to price in the prospect of a new infrastructure spending programme financed by 
debt.

He writes:

The election results mean that there may now be a big fiscal expansion, which 
adds to the downside risks for bonds for at least two reasons. First, it would 
increase their supply. Second, we think it would mainly boost inflation rather 
than growth.

Jessop also suspects that the Wall Street rally will fizzle out, as investors 
focus their minds on possible trade wars under President Trump.

For a start, the strong performance of some sectors (such as industrials, 
basic materials and energy) has reflected hopes for a big splurge on 
infrastructure spending, which we think is unlikely – most of the fiscal 
stimulus is likely to take the form of tax cuts.Stock markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> do not tend to fare well 
when inflation is rising either.

And investors may start to worry again soon about the implications for growth 
of Trump’s other proposals, such as trade tariffs.
 
There’s no respite for the Mexican economy, I’m afraid.

Its government bonds are weakening again, driving up yields, and the peso is 
hitting fresh lows:

The Trump Jump we saw in the immediate aftermath of this week’s presidential 
election has hit a hump.

London’s FTSE 100 has suffered another day of chunky losses, closing down 97 
points, or almost 1.5%.

The stronger pound is partly to blame; sterling is up 0.5% right not over 
$1.26.

 Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains that Brexit anxiety has faded 
this week.

If FTSE bulls were emboldened by Wednesday’s incredible fightback to regain 
the 7000 mark, they will be feeling somewhat weary today, as the UK benchmark 
suffered substantial losses amid a comprehensive recovery for sterling.

The pound was expected to rise on last week’s realisation that Article 50 is 
now in the hands of Brexit-sceptic MPs, and with the US election now out of the 
way, we are seeing that pound rebound take shape. Much like a weakening euro 
was perceived to be good for UK stocks, today’s pound rally is doing little to 
help the FTSE, which has suffered more than most.

, analysts believe Europe will suffer if Trump does manage to boostUS growth 
through tax cuts and a spending boost.

Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says:

The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of 
international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for 
corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets.

The City is also concerned by the heavy losses in the bond market this week

, which wiped out around $1trn. That, funnily enough, is also how much has been 
added to the US equities market this week, according to Bloomberg.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says income inequality helped to drive 
Donald Trump to the White House.

In an interview with CNN, Buffett, who has called for tax reform in the past, 
says ordinary Americans feel that wealth distribution is unfair:

The Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] had $93bn dollars in 1982, and 
they’ve got 2.4 trillion dollars today. That’s 25 times as much.

If you’ve been working 40 hours a week, maybe holding a second job and you 
work with the Little League [junior baseball] and you’ve been a good parent, 
and you’re really struggling.

Then you think, “What’s wrong with this picture?”, and you want to change the 
picture.

Buffett, worth an estimated $70bn, also criticises Trump’s criticism of free 
trade, saying protectionism would harm the US economy.

But while Buffett isn’t a fan of Trump, he’s now calling on Americans to back 
the president-elect. Unity, he says, is now crucial, after a particularly 
negative and personal campaign:

It’s every important that the American people coalesce behind a president.

That doesn’t mean they can’t criticise, or disagree with what he’s doing. But 
we need a country unified by a president.

Buffett also warns that Trump can’t deliver on all his pledges, such as 
doubling economic growth.

“Nobody can grow the economy 4% in real terms over time...The math is too 
extraordinary.”

Speaking of Europe... Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom suggested today 
that talks with the US about the controversial TTIP agreement will probably be 
‘frozen’ for a while now.

Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that:

“There will be a natural pause, of course, while we wait for the next 
administration; then, for quite some time TTIP will probably be in the freezer.

Then what happens when it’s defrosted, I think we will need to wait and see.”

Malmstrom: "I don’t think we see the resumption of any TTIP negotiation in

Germany is defying the global market selloff today, with its DAX index 
slightly higher.

That’s partly thanks to Deutsche Bank, whose shares have surged over 4% today. 
There’s speculation that the German lender has a better chance of negotiating a 
lower penalty with the US Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 
financial crisis.

Deutsche should also benefit from a higher inflation environment; record low 
interest rates have hurt its profitability.

Its share plunged through €10 at the end of September, on fears over its 
financial health. They’re now worth €14.7
