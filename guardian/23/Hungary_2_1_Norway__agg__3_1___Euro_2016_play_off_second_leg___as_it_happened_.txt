Full-time! Hungary 2-1 Norway (agg: 3-1)

90 min +3: Hungary are through. Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> had so much possession, so many 
chances but could only score when 3-0 down on aggregate. This was poor viewing 
for the neutral but the Magic Magyars are back in a tournament for the first 
time in 30 years and they are dancing jubilantly on the pitch. We’ll see them 
in France in June. Norway’s players can book their couple of weeks in the sun. 
Thanks for reading. Bye!

90 min +2: Bode is offside and, already on a booking, kicks the ball away to 
kill a few more seconds. Lucky not to be sent off, there.

90 min: Helland shoots acrobatically from the edge of the area. It trickles 
out for a goal-kick and that should snap Norway’s final straw.

63 min: Second change for the hosts sees the goalscorer, Priskin, replaced by

61 min: Helland crosses from the right and Henriksen rises above Kadar but the 
Norwegian’s attempt is headed away for a corner. Helland delivers and Pedersen 
is whistle up incorrectly for a foul on Kiraly, who had actually dived for the 
cross but missed it completely.

57 min: Norway passing it back and forth but there are red shirts in front of 
them. When they inevitably lose possession,Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> break again and the captain, 
Dzsudzsak has a go from a tightish angle on the right of the box after cutting 
in on his left. It takes a deflection and loops onto the bar. That was close to 
sealing it, though it’s a struggle to figure out where Norway will score once, 
nevermind twice.

55 min: Helland puts in another free-kick! His fourth set-piece since coming 
on nine minutes ago! This one is poor and Kiraly collects. At least there is a 
really good atmosphere to enjoy, because the football is poor – and that’s 
being kind.

53 min: Forren makes a fine but tough tackle on Priskin as Hungary

first thing Norway have done that deserves credit so far.

51 min: Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> win another 
free-kick. Helland takes once more, but from the left on this occasion. It 
bounces unchallenged in the area. Nobody gets on it and Kiraly saves. That’s 
awful from both sides – nobody there to defend a dangerous cross but no 
attacker on hand to even attempt to convert it.

48 min: Norway’s formation appears to remain the same despite those changes, 
with Henriksen the lone frontman. Helland delivers from a free-kick on the 
right. Three white shirts try to get on the end of it but none can connect and
Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have a goal-kick.

47 min: Helland’s first act is to deliver a corner. It’s hit long and Tettey

46 min: We are underway again. What can Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> do? Changes are certainly what 
the doctor ordered considering how short they were of ideas in attack.

One change for Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> – Pinter 
on for Elek. And two changes for Norway – Pedersen on for Elyounoussi and 
Helland on for Odegaard, who still looks out of his depth at international 
level.

 Hungary’s supporters are happy. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images
Priskin’s early goal – a stunner following a counter-attack – has Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> with one foot in next summer’s 
tournament. Norway remain short on ideas up front and really need to improve 
quick.

Odegaard and Hovland rises and connects well but is denied by Kiraly’s 
right-hand post.

43 min: Another Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> cross. 
Elyounoussi delivers from the left after Allesami fed him. It’s too long for 
Odegaard and the ball trickles out harmlessly for a goal-kick.

40 min: And that means Norway’s only real threat comes from crosses. 
Elabdellaoui sends one in from the right, Guzmics puts it out for a corner.
Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> clear and break. The 
counter ends up with Priskin but Elabdellaoui gets across to block just as he 
shot from about eight yards.

37 min: Allesami tries to cross from deep on the left but sends the ball into 
the stands. Dismal. Norway have had one attempt on goal,Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have had four on target. The 
visitors lack someone capable of picking out a defence-splitting pass. They 
also don’t have anybody capable of running directly.

pressure.

27 min: And they create a decent chance! Allesami has an attempt blocked 
before Elyounoussi’s rebound is saved well by Kiraly, who gets down low. 
Odegaard takes the ensuing corner and Henriksen cannot direct his header 
towards goal.

25 min: Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> are playing in 
what Pep Guardiola calls the ineffective U – attempting to work it down one 
flank, finding no way through before going back and trying their luck on the 
other wing. Before going back again until they eventually run into trouble and 
squander control of the ball.

3 min: Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary>, having had such 
little of the ball in the first leg, will have to do a lot of defending again 
this evening. Gabor Kiraly, in goal for the hosts, is wearing trackies of 
course.

I’m watching this on Hungarian TV due to a problem with our office box here in 
London. Unusually, the pundits and presenter are wearing the Hungarian kit! Can 
you imagine Pougatch, Dixon, Wright and friends sat in the studio with the 
three lions on their shirt? Actually, you probably can imagine Wright.

Preamble

Remember when Hungary were a big name in international football? World Cup 
winners! They played in the Match of the Century against England at Wembley in 
1953. But they have not been at a major tournament since the 1986 World Cup.
Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> are also mourning the 
tragic death of their former goalkeeper Marton Fulop to cancer at the far too 
young age of 32 and the passing of Pal Varhidi, who played in that 1953 game at 
Wembley.

They are only 90 minutes away from a long-awaited return thanks to Laszlo 
Kleinheisler’s 26th-minute goal.Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> were utterly dominant in Oslo 
though – having 83% of possession but failing to score from 23 attempts on 
goal. Pal Andre Helland had a late header come back off the bar and even though 
they are away this evening are still fancied to haul themselves back into the 
tie.

Team news will be along shortly but while we wait here is that aforementioned 
match! Kick-off is 7.45pm GMT.

close  
90 min +3: Hungary are through. Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> had so much possession, so many 
chances but could only score when 3-0 down on aggregate. This was poor viewing 
for the neutral but the Magic Magyars are back in a tournament for the first 
time in 30 years and they are dancing jubilantly on the pitch. We’ll see them 
in France in June. Norway’s players can book their couple of weeks in the sun. 
Thanks for reading. Bye!
 
90 min +2: Bode is offside and, already on a booking, kicks the ball away to 
kill a few more seconds. Lucky not to be sent off, there.
 
90 min: There will be three minutes added on. Three minutes that won’t seem 
too long whenHungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have been 
waiting 30 years for some success.
 
90 min: Helland shoots acrobatically from the edge of the area. It trickles 
out for a goal-kick and that should snap Norway’s final straw.
 
89 min: Helland has a pop from range. Kiraly smothers it. Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> need to hold their bottle.
 
87 min: And with the game beyond their reach Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> finally score! Berget is denied 
by Kiraly but Henriksen is on hand to convert the rebound, the ball nestling in 
the bottom right corner.

83 min: The 30-year wait is over! Dzsudzsak sends in a corner Bode flicks it 
on at the near post and it looks like Henriksen deflects the ball into his own 
net with no time to react.Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary>
 are on their way to France. Norway’s players can have the summer off.
 
80 min: Bode is booked for a ludicrous wrestling tackle on Hovland. And Berget 
is on forNorway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway>, in the place of 
Skjelbred.
 
79 min: Another Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> chance … 
and again it fails to find the target. Johansen’s curling attempt is a few 
inches too high.
 
76 min: A chance for Norway: Pedersen, after a Tettey attempt is not cleared, 
shoots low but is denied by the diving Kiraly.
 
75 min: Hungary’s final substitution sees Nemeth replaced the hard-working 
Kleinheisler.
 
72 min: And still Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> look 
more dangerous. Dzsudzsak evades Allesami and his low drive is well saved by 
Nylland.

70 min: The 24th corner is cleared. The 25th is delivered by Helland. It’s 
half-cleared to Skjelbred, whose shot is blocked and eventuallyHungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> get fully rid.
 Jonathan Wilson (@jonawils) 
23 corners now for Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> over 
the two legs. No goals.

<https://twitter.com/jonawils/status/666000077631193088>  
66 min: Hungary attack again. Lovrenscics shoots from a tough angle but can 
only find the side-netting.
 
64 min: A rare Hungarian attack in this half sees Lovrenscics cross from the 
left after Kleinheisler’s decent through ball. Bode rises to meet the delivery 
but is called up for a foul on Hovland.
 
63 min: Second change for the hosts sees the goalscorer, Priskin, replaced by 
Bode – although the announcer in the stadium has got it the wrong way round. 
Chuckle, my pedantic friends, chuckle!
 
61 min: Helland crosses from the right and Henriksen rises above Kadar but the 
Norwegian’s attempt is headed away for a corner. Helland delivers and Pedersen 
is whistle up incorrectly for a foul on Kiraly, who had actually dived for the 
cross but missed it completely.
 
60 min: Forren sends a pass that is more hopeless than hopeful forward. Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> are now resorting to punts 
forward.
 
57 min: Norway passing it back and forth but there are red shirts in front of 
them. When they inevitably lose possession,Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> break again and the captain, 
Dzsudzsak has a go from a tightish angle on the right of the box after cutting 
in on his left. It takes a deflection and loops onto the bar. That was close to 
sealing it, though it’s a struggle to figure out where Norway will score once, 
nevermind twice.
 
Seeing as the game is poor, let’s stare at wonder at this!

 <https://twitter.com/TerraceLife_/status/665812015034834944>  
55 min: Helland puts in another free-kick! His fourth set-piece since coming 
on nine minutes ago! This one is poor and Kiraly collects. At least there is a 
really good atmosphere to enjoy, because the football is poor – and that’s 
being kind.
 
53 min: Forren makes a fine but tough tackle on Priskin as Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> attempt to break. That’s the 
first thing Norway have done that deserves credit so far.
 Norway’s Marcus Pedersen and Vegard Forren try to find a breakthrough. 
Photograph: Laszlo Balogh/Reuters  
51 min: Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> win another 
free-kick. Helland takes once more, but from the left on this occasion. It 
bounces unchallenged in the area. Nobody gets on it and Kiraly saves. That’s 
awful from both sides – nobody there to defend a dangerous cross but no 
attacker on hand to even attempt to convert it.
 
48 min: Norway’s formation appears to remain the same despite those changes, 
with Henriksen the lone frontman. Helland delivers from a free-kick on the 
right. Three white shirts try to get on the end of it but none can connect and
Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have a goal-kick.
 
47 min: Helland’s first act is to deliver a corner. It’s hit long and Tettey 
heads wide at the rear stick.
 
46 min: We are underway again. What can Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> do? Changes are certainly what 
the doctor ordered considering how short they were of ideas in attack.
 
One change for Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> – Pinter 
on for Elek. And two changes for Norway – Pedersen on for Elyounoussi and 
Helland on for Odegaard, who still looks out of his depth at international 
level.
  Hungary’s supporters are happy. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images 
Priskin’s early goal – a stunner following a counter-attack – has Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> with one foot in next summer’s 
tournament. Norway remain short on ideas up front and really need to improve 
quick.
 
45 min: There will be one minute added on. Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> are pushing a little more – the 
break is coming at the wrong time for them.
 
44 min: Norway go close! They win a corner. Another ball is crossed in by 
Odegaard and Hovland rises and connects well but is denied by Kiraly’s 
right-hand post.
 
43 min: Another Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> cross. 
Elyounoussi delivers from the left after Allesami fed him. It’s too long for 
Odegaard and the ball trickles out harmlessly for a goal-kick.
 
42 min: Priskin, still running hard after that dreamy goal, fouls Allesami 
near Norway’s endline.
 
40 min: And that means Norway’s only real threat comes from crosses. 
Elabdellaoui sends one in from the right, Guzmics puts it out for a corner.
Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> clear and break. The 
counter ends up with Priskin but Elabdellaoui gets across to block just as he 
shot from about eight yards.

Henriksen. Photograph: Tibor Illyes/EPA  
37 min: Allesami tries to cross from deep on the left but sends the ball into 
the stands. Dismal. Norway have had one attempt on goal,Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have had four on target. The 
visitors lack someone capable of picking out a defence-splitting pass. They 
also don’t have anybody capable of running directly.
 
35 min: Norway have had almost 70% of the ball but Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> still look more likely to score. 
Kleinheisler sends a teasing cross in from the right and Lovrenscics arrives at 
the backpost but heads narrowly wide.
 
33 min: Dzsudzsak ambitiously attempts to catch out Nylland by shooting from a 
free-kick wide on the right but it bounces once before theNorway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> keeper makes a simple collection.
 
30 min: Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> pass it across 
the back to a chorus of oles from the home support but a dawdling Fiola is 
closed down by Johansen and ends up kicking the ball out for a throw-in under 
pressure.
 
27 min: And they create a decent chance! Allesami has an attempt blocked 
before Elyounoussi’s rebound is saved well by Kiraly, who gets down low. 
Odegaard takes the ensuing corner and Henriksen cannot direct his header 
towards goal.
 
26 min: Hungary are by no means an impressive side but Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> really are a limited outfit – 
perhaps illustrated by playing a 16-year-old in midfield.
 Norway’s 16-year-old midfielder Martin Odegaard, right, looks older than 
Hungary’s Adam Nagy. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images  
25 min: Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> are playing in 
what Pep Guardiola calls the ineffective U – attempting to work it down one 
flank, finding no way through before going back and trying their luck on the 
other wing. Before going back again until they eventually run into trouble and 
squander control of the ball.
 
22 min: Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> are also 
working hard to press Norway in possession and when Kelinheisler dispossess 
Skjelbred, the Norway captain cynically and frustratedly commits a foul on 
halfway.
 
20 min: Skjelbred is fouled by Kadar just inside the Hungary half on the 
right. But Norway continue to find very little space to squeeze through in 
attack. Odegaard, born eight years after the last timeHungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> were in a major tournament, has 
been anonymous thus far.
 
18 min: Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> are now on top 
since the goal, probing for the goal that will end Norway’s challenge. 
Dzsudzsak does some dancing before a shot from around 25 yards is blocked by 
Forren.
 
15 min: That also means no extra-time! But, obviously, Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> still only need two goals to 
progress.
  Hungary’s Tamas Priskin scores. Photograph: Laszlo Balogh/Reuters 
14 min: Wow! A long ball is played forward by Kadar to Priskin on the left 
channel. He turns Forren before rifling a stunning effort home from just inside 
the area, leaving Nylland with no chance. AreHungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> back in the big time?
 
12 min: Kleinheisler picks up possession in midfield and tries to play in 
Priskin, but Hungary’s lone striker is offside.
 
10 min: Another cross on the left, this time from Allesami, is more 
threatening but Hungary defend well again and Dzsudzsak is allowed to break. 
Johansen is across to stop him quickly – sliding in and picking up a yellow 
card for a foul. TheHungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
captain rolls half a dozen times before immediately picking himself up once he 
noticed the referee, Senor Velasco Carballo reaching for his pocket.
 
9 min: Henriksen crosses deep from the left but it troubles nobody and Lang 
heads it calmly back to Kiraly.
 
7 min: It sounds like there is an amazing atmosphere in Budapest though! 
Norway are presently enjoying plenty of the ball in their own half but are 
struggling to find a way pastHungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary>, lined up in a compact 4-2-3-1.
 
3 min: Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary>, having had such 
little of the ball in the first leg, will have to do a lot of defending again 
this evening. Gabor Kiraly, in goal for the hosts, is wearing trackies of 
course.
 
1 min: Promising start for the hosts. Dzsudzsak has a shot from range that is 
saved by Nylland. TheHungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
captain then wins a corner that is taken short to Kleinheisler – Norway clear 
at their near post.
 
1 min: Norway, in white with navy shorts, kick-off to a deafening chorus of 
boos.Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> are in red with 
white shorts.
 
We will now have a minute of applause in memory of those who lost their lives 
in the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday night, plus recently deceased 
former players Marton Fulop and Pal Varhidi.

I’m watching this on Hungarian TV due to a problem with our office box here in 
London. Unusually, the pundits and presenter are wearing the Hungarian kit! Can 
you imagine Pougatch, Dixon, Wright and friends sat in the studio with the 
three lions on their shirt? Actually, you probably can imagine Wright.
 
The teams are out and the anthems are imminent.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> were utterly dominant in Oslo 
though – having 83% of possession but failing to score from 23 attempts on 
goal. Pal Andre Helland had a late header come back off the bar and even though 
they are away this evening are still fancied to haul themselves back into the 
tie.

Team news will be along shortly but while we wait here is that aforementioned 
match! Kick-off is 7.45pm GMT.
