Philip Hammond has said the government cannot ignore the £59bn black hole in 
the public finances directly related to Brexit, as pro-leave Tories criticised 
the economic forecast as overly pessimistic.

Speaking after his first autumn statement, where he outlined plans for modest 
further borrowing to boost investment in infrastructure, Hammond said forecasts 
from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for the costs of leaving the EU 
were based on a “a very high degree of uncertainty in the circumstances we are 
in”.

Eurosceptic Conservatives including the former work and pensions secretary 
Iain Duncan Smith said the OBR forecast was “another utter doom and gloom 
scenario” and criticised the advisory body, which he said “simply hasn’t got 
anything right”.

“The key thing is that the OBR has been wrong in every single forecast they 
have made so far,” he told Sky News. “On the deficit, on growth, on jobs, they 
have pretty much been wrong on everything.”

Though cautioning that economic forecasting was “not an exact science”, 
Hammond said the Treasury was preparing for “very challenging fiscal 
circumstances”.

“We should certainly not ignore it but look at it as one of the possible 
ranges of outcomes we need to plan for. We should note what it says about the 
strength of our economy, and the OBR has upgraded its forecast for our economic 
growth this year,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Hammond said the OBR’s forecasts, a £21bn deficit with public debt expected to 
peak at more than 90% of GDP, were not only based on the uncertainty linked to 
the Brexit negotiations but also the election of Donald Trump and his attitude 
to free-trade agreements with the rest of the world.

“There’s uncertainty around the future course of policy in the US, uncertainty 
about global trade, uncertainty about the growth rate of the Chinese economy,” 
he said.

“We should have a plan, and that’s what I outlined yesterday, which both 
invests in our economy to build on strengths but provides for perhaps a little 
more rainy day next year and the year after as the OBR forecast says.”

The government itself was unable to accurately predict what the outcome of 
negotiations with the EU would be once the UK triggered the two-year article 50 
process for leaving the bloc, Hammond said.

“It’s not about what we want the outcome to be. It’s going to be a 
negotiation. We are going to sit at a table with the representatives of the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and no one can say for 
certain what the outcome of that negotiation will be,” he said. “That’s what 
creates the uncertainty.”

The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, an arch-Eurosceptic, said the economy had 
consistently outperformed predictions since the Brexit vote in June and the 
OBR’s forecasts were “particularly gloomy on the prospects for financial 
services”.


“Suspicion of experts goes back into antiquity. Experts, soothsayers, 
astrologers are all in much the same category,” he told the BBC.

His fellow Tory MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the figures were created by 
“throwing into a pot and coming up with a set of potential outcomes ... 
predictions that have come out of the Treasury, the OBR and even the Bank of 
England have proved to be wildly inaccurate at times”.

The Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who chairs the pro-Brexit Change Britain, said: 
“Predictions for a loss of investment and trade for the next 10 years do not 
seem credible.

“Outside of the EU’s single market we can look forward to an even stronger 
economy – with better regulation and free trade deals with some of the fastest 
growing economies in the world. This will benefit businesses large and small 
and help to create jobs and spread prosperity across the country.”

The former Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised the leave campaigners for 
their attacks on the OBR, tweeting:
Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) 
Now Brexiteers attack OBR. They can't win argument for hard, destructive 
Brexit based on truth so have to try and win based on fantasy.

Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Today programme 
the OBR’s forecasts were “considerably more optimistic than those we have from 
most independent forecasters, and significantly more so than those we have from 
the Bank of England”.

“We really don’t know very much about where we will be, certainly after 2019,” 
he said.

Speaking earlier on the programme, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said 
Hammond had some wrong economic priorities given the uncertain economic climate.

“They have given tax giveaways on capital gains tax, corporation tax, 
inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and corporation, cutting 
universal credit to people they call Jams – just about managing – people going 
into work, looking after their families, doing everything they ask for,” he 
said.
