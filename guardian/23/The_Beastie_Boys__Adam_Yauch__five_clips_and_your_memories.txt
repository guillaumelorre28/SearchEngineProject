Live on the Scott and Gary Show <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn61xsn1dPk>
Before they became rap's biggest act, the Beastie Boys were a hardcore punk 
band intoBlack Flag 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/9941a936-196a-4a62-ae53-a69cbc33f20e> 
andBad Brains 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/e919b253-da5b-4aae-a444-6a368376a2d6>. 
Here, Adam Yauch is on bass while adding to the primeval racket are Adam 
Horovitz on guitar and Michael Diamond on vocals (with, on drums, Kate 
Schellenbach, later of Luscious Jackson), ahead of their rechristening (as far 
as Jews can be rechristened) as, respectively, MCA, Ad-Rock and Mike D. The 
footage is from 1984, from a cable TV programme called the Scott and Gary Show, 
and includes such never-to-be-revisited early "classics" as White Shadow and 
Egg Raid on Mojo.

(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party) 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naf5uJYGoiU>
The 1986 bracket-fest (You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!) wasn't the 
Beasties' first single - that honour went to 1985'sShe's On It 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PLfjhQG97I>. It wasn't even the first single 
released off their 1986 debut album,Licensed To Ill 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/57f5e7c8-2a6e-34a0-b4cd-0e77695bc36f> - 
in fact, it was the fourth. But the song, helped not a little by the video, was 
the one that propelled them to global infamy and, at least for the next three 
years, fixed them in the public imagination as the terminally bratty snot-rap 
upstarts. Cameos include Def Jam labelmate LL Cool J and their producer Rick 
Rubin.

Hey Ladies <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naf5uJYGoiU>
Hey Ladies was the only charting single from 1989's Paul's Boutique 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/b534aa01-d621-31ba-9278-38a500e3cdca> 
and presented a different Beasties - the astute, adroit sampladelicists with a 
more far-reaching lyrical and sonic agenda, one way beyond the juvenile 
dementia of that debut: this is probably the only rap single in history to 
include snippets of glam rockers the Sweet alongside the more typical Kool and 
the Gang and James Brown. The 70s fetishism of the video - featuring the Boys 
in Saturday Night Fever flares playing swaggering Travolta-style disco 
narcissists - set them up nicely for the classic Sabotage.

Sabotage <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE>
Routinely regarded as one of the greatest videos of all time, Sabotage was 
directed by Spike Jonze and saw our heroes playing detectives in what was meant 
to be the opening scene of a TV show loosely based on, variously, Starsky & 
Hutch, the Streets Of San Francisco and Hawaii 5-0. Hardly surprisingly, it won 
five awards at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, although shamefully they 
neglected to hand out individual gongs for Best Kicking Down of a Door, Best 
Use of a Megaphone, and Best Moustache.

Intergalactic <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORYO0atB6g&ob=av2e>
Intergalactic, directed by MCA under the pseudonym of Nathanial Hornblower, 
was the Beasties' biggest hit in the UK, reaching No 5 in 1998. The video was 
another superb and affectionate parody that amply reflected their satirical 
imaginations: this time it was Japanese sci-fi/horror B-movies that got the 
pastiche treatment. Again, it demolished (movie monster pun intended) 
all-comers at the MTV Video Music Awards, and the Beasties got to live out 
their mad professor and cyber worker fantasies. And they got to show their best 
kung-fu moves while wearing yellow wellington boots.
