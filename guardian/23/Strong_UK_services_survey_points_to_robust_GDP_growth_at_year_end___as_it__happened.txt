Dennis de Jong, managing director at online forex broker UFX.com, was quick to 
react to the survey data.

The US services industry accounts for two-thirds of the country’s economic 
output, so the above-expectations ISM non-manufacturing PMI for December will 
please Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed, especially as it comes on 
the back of broadly encouraging financial data of recent weeks.

The US economy was remarkably resilient in the face of growing uncertainty 
during 2016, and the markets reacted positively to Donald Trump’s election in 
November. With the president-elect now just weeks away from the White House, 
the challenge is to deliver the growth he has promised.

Wall Street opens lower; FTSE up

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened nearly 14 points lower at 19,928.41, 
as expected – its first lower open in 2017. It got tantalisingly close to the 
historic 20,000 mark yesterday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have both slipped a 
couple of points.

Here in London, the FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 is 
now more than 10 points ahead at 7,201.18, a 0.16% gain, and could get to 
another record close today. It would be the sixth in a row. The longest run of 
all-time closing highs (eight in a row) was in May 1997.

Back to the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane, who is answering 
questions at the Institute for Government, a think tank.

He said the central bank was keeping an eye on the recent strong growth in 
consumer lending but saw no need for alarm.

You’ll have seen and read from our Financial Policy Committee that this is 
something that they’re keeping a close... eye on. And they are right to do so.

Nonetheless, we need to put all this in a bit of context. Aggregate borrowing 
by households isn’t tearing away right now. We’ve gone through a long period 
where borrowing, both by companies and households, has actually been rather 
subdued.

Wall Street set for first lower open of 2017

US stocks are set for their first lower open of the year, following the 
weaker-than-expected jobs data and the minutes of the last Fed meeting. Almost 
every Fed policymaker thought Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts and 
infrastructure spending could stoke higher inflation, which could force the 
central bank to step up rate hikes this year.

The Dow Jones has been flirting with the 20,000 mark for weeks but future 
markets suggest it will open 15 points lower today. It has never broken through 
that level before. It closed at 19,942.16 yesterday.

Over in the US, the ADP National Employment Report (from payrolls processor 
ADP) indicated that employers in the private sector created 153,000 jobs last 
month, below Wall Street forecasts of a job gain of 170,000. The figures come a 
day before the government’s key non-farm payrolls data.

US Treasury bond yields slipped on the news.

Haldane reiterated the Bank of England’s view that economic growth will slow a 
little while inflation will pick up materially this year, following the sharp 
fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum.

That [higher inflation] will in turn produce something of a squeeze on the 
spending power of consumers and may lead them to throttle back somewhat in 
their spending plans.

It might not happen, they might choose to run down their savings. But it’s 
possible, indeed I’d say likely that there will be something of a slowdown.

The US services industry accounts for two-thirds of the country’s economic 
output, so the above-expectations ISM non-manufacturing PMI for December will 
please Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed, especially as it comes on 
the back of broadly encouraging financial data of recent weeks.

The US economy was remarkably resilient in the face of growing uncertainty 
during 2016, and the markets reacted positively to Donald Trump’s election in 
November. With the president-elect now just weeks away from the White House, 
the challenge is to deliver the growth he has promised.
 
The Dow Jones is still in negative territory, but has improved slightly from 
the open. It is now down 8 points at 19,934.68.
 
The closely watched ISM survey for the US has come in stronger than expected. 
The non-manufacturing sector PMI, from the Institute for Supply Management, 
rose to 57.2 in December from 57.2 in November. The new orders sub-index jumped 
from 57 to 51.6, the highest since August 2015.
 
Another piece of labour market data from the US, ahead of tomorrow’s key 
non-farm payrolls: the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits 
dropped 28,000 to 235,000 last week, according to the US Labour Department – 
close to the 233,000 touched in November, a 43-year low.
 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened nearly 14 points lower at 19,928.41, 
as expected – its first lower open in 2017. It got tantalisingly close to the 
historic 20,000 mark yesterday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have both slipped a 
couple of points.

Here in London, the FTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 is 
now more than 10 points ahead at 7,201.18, a 0.16% gain, and could get to 
another record close today. It would be the sixth in a row. The longest run of 
all-time closing highs (eight in a row) was in May 1997.
 
The Haldane event has now finished.
 
Back to the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane, who is answering 
questions at the Institute for Government, a think tank.

He said the central bank was keeping an eye on the recent strong growth in 
consumer lending but saw no need for alarm.

You’ll have seen and read from our Financial Policy Committee that this is 
something that they’re keeping a close... eye on. And they are right to do so.

Nonetheless, we need to put all this in a bit of context. Aggregate borrowing 
by households isn’t tearing away right now. We’ve gone through a long period 
where borrowing, both by companies and households, has actually been rather 
subdued.
 
US stocks are set for their first lower open of the year, following the 
weaker-than-expected jobs data and the minutes of the last Fed meeting. Almost 
every Fed policymaker thought Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts and 
infrastructure spending could stoke higher inflation, which could force the 
central bank to step up rate hikes this year.

The Dow Jones has been flirting with the 20,000 mark for weeks but future 
markets suggest it will open 15 points lower today. It has never broken through 
that level before. It closed at 19,942.16 yesterday.
 
Over in the US, the ADP National Employment Report (from payrolls processor 
ADP) indicated that employers in the private sector created 153,000 jobs last 
month, below Wall Street forecasts of a job gain of 170,000. The figures come a 
day before the government’s key non-farm payrolls data.

US Treasury bond yields slipped on the news.
 
Haldane reiterated the Bank of England’s view that economic growth will slow a 
little while inflation will pick up materially this year, following the sharp 
fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum.

That [higher inflation] will in turn produce something of a squeeze on the 
spending power of consumers and may lead them to throttle back somewhat in 
their spending plans.

It might not happen, they might choose to run down their savings. But it’s 
possible, indeed I’d say likely that there will be something of a slowdown.
