Afternoon summary: Pound fears grip City as Lagarde urges action

Time for a recap, after another busy day of financial twists and turns.


Britain has been threatened with the spectre of the pound falling towards 
parity with the US dollar.

Mohamed El-Erian of investment giant Allianz warned that sterling could hit 
record lows, unless politicians get their act together and negotiate a new 
agreement with the EU.

He told Reuters that:

The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the 
structural uncertainty is resolved – if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn’t 
involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for 
sterling to head to parity with the US dollar.

Three investment banks have warned that the pound will fall to $1.20, or 
lower, this year.

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has also weighed in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live?page=with:block-577e40e2e4b04e08d34e31bc#block-577e40e2e4b04e08d34e31bc>
. She fears Britain’s economy will suffer long-term damage if the uncertainty 
following last month’s EU referendum isn’t resolved soon.

Senior bosses at the world’s largest banks have promised to help London retain 
its place as a global financial hub....


...But the boss of JP Morgan has reiterated that thousands of London-based 
jobs will be lost if the City loses its ‘passport’ into the UK.

UK consumers have been warned that the slump in the pound will soon hit their 
purses and wallets:

It’s been a better day in the market, though. The pound clawed its way above 
$1.30, although it has now dipped back towards yesterday’s 31-year lows.

Barclays fears rancorous Brexit negotiations

Analysts at Barclays have slashed their growth forecast for next year, 
predicting that the Brexit vote will cause “prolonged uncertainty and financial 
stress.”

They now expect the UK economy to contact by 0.4% next year, down from growth 
of 1.8% previously. They also cut their euro area growth forecast to 0.6%, down 
from 1.7%.

Barclays also see several flashpoints in the months ahead which could even put 
the future of the eurozone in doubt again:

For example, the UK-EU exit negotiations could turn rancorous. And market 
upheaval could be even greater if an EMU country were to actively question EU 
membership; redenomination risk could return.

Hence, investors are likely to pay close attention to the October referendum 
on constitutional reforms in Italy, as well as the general elections in the 
Netherlands, France and Germany in 2017. Any outcome that helps anti-EU 
political parties would likely be poorly received by markets

NIESR: UK economy contracted in June

Newsflash: The British economy appears to have contracted last month.

New figures from the National Institute Of Economic and Social Research 
indicate that the economy was weakening, even before Britons headed to the 
polls.

NIESR estimates that the economy grew by 0.6% in the April-June quarter, up 
from 0.4% in January-March. So far so good....
 UK quarterly growth Photograph: NIESR 
But before anyone gets the bunting out, NIERS also estimate that strong growth 
in April fizzled out in May, leading to the economy shrinking in June.


Jack Meaning, Research Fellow at NIESR, explains:

“At first glance this represents a robust rate of quarterly growth for the UK 
economy. However, the quarterly figure masks an important within-quarter 
pattern. Our monthly estimates suggest that April saw a large expansion in GDP, 
which then stagnated in May.

The estimate for June is one of an intensifying contraction across the board, 
but this is not enough to offset the very strong April numbers.

What it does suggest is that when April drops out of the 3 month calculation 
we should see a quick deterioration of growth, especially if the estimated 
contraction in June persists or accelerates into July and beyond.”

Fancy buying a supermarket or an office block? It could be your lucky day.


Somewhere between £3bn to £5bn of direct real estate is now up for sale, as 
commercial real estate funds try to generate cash to pay redemptions to 
investors.

And as it is a buyers market, some assets could be sold pretty cheaply.

Investment bank Jefferies is scathing about the ‘open-ended’ funds which have 
invested in property on the way up. Six funds have now locked the exit doors 
this week; Standard Life, Aviva, M&S, Columbia, Canada Life and Henderson.

Jefferies accuses them of selling “snake oil” to retail investors, by 
guaranteeing liquidity while investing in a notoriously illiquid asset class. 
You can’t just sell a tower block in a few days, which is why redemptions are 
now frozen.

Jefferies analysts predict more pain ahead:

Now the virtuous cycle is turning into a vicious circle of redemptions, REIT 
sales, gating, discounted asset sales, lower fund valuations, and Major (Ret’d) 
& Mrs Smith complaining in the Sunday Times Money Section that they never read 
the small print and then more redemptions etc. etc.

[REIT = real estate investment trusts; companies who generate an income from 
owning commercial property ]

In another sign of Brexit tensions, rating agency Standard & Poor’s has 
revised down its opinion of several UK banks.

It has cut Barclays’ outlook to negative, from stable, and also lowered Royal 
Bank of Scotland to stable, from positive.

It blames “potential economic deterioration” following the EU vote, and says 
the UK is “entering a correction phase”, in which consumer confidence will 
suffer.

There are fresh rumblings in the UK commercial property market, where the 
Brexit vote continues to alarm investors.

Two more funds have announced that the value of their shopping centres, office 
blocks and suchlike has fallen sharply in the last two weeks.

Legal & General cut the value of its £2.3bn property fund by 10% – following a 
5% cut last week – while Foreign & Colonial cut the value of its £290m fund by 
5%.

L&G also warned that it’s too early to know the full impact of the EU 
referendum vote.

Some 172,000 new private sector jobs were created in June, some 13,000 more

Christine Lagarde also warned that the global economy could suffer if Britain 
enters a limbo state where it delays the process of leaving the EU.

Do we have a forecast and scenario with prolonged uncertainty, total lack of 
clarity, no triggering of Article 50 [the official notification required to 
leave the EU], things staying in limbo for a long period of time? No. We don’t 
have that. We doubt that it would be sustainable politically, geopolitically.

Lagarde: We need clarity about UK's Brexit plans
 Photograph: Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images 
Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has called on 
Britain to resolve its relationship with the European Union quickly, to limit 
the economic damage of Brexit.

She’s echoing Mohamed El-Erian’s warning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live?page=with:block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b#block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b>
 that uncertainty will hurt the UK economy.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Lagarde says: 


“We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack 
of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and 
decision making.

The IMF believes could UK cushion the impact of leaving the EU by agreeing a 
Norway-style agreement (basically getting access to the single market, but also 
agreeing to EU laws and freedom of movement). That would only cut 1.5% off GDP 
growth by 2019

However, if the UK clatters out of the EU without a new trade deal, it will 
revert to standard WTO tariffs - meaning the economy would be 4.5% smaller than 
otherwise by the end of the decade.The boss of the WTO has already warned that 
this would cost consumers £9bn per year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/wto-eu-uk-consumers-trade-deals>
.

It’s not clear when the UK can deliver the clarity which Lagarde is seeking. 
This morning, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told MPs that the government 
simply isn’t in a position to start ‘substantive negotiations’ with Brussels.

The pound has broken back over the $1.30 mark, away from yesterday’s 31-year 
low of $1.28 (and further away from dollar parity, of course).

It appears that some calm has returned to the markets, after some wild days.

But analysts are expecting sterling to keep dropping.

fastFT have the details:

Deutsche Bank believes that sterling is in line to fall as far as $1.15 
<https://next.ft.com/content/4e9eb89c-69c7-3b92-b195-4fd41a9a02ac>, while HSBC 
has set $1.20 as its target for the end of the year. Goldman Sachs has a 
three-month target of $1.20.

Bank chiefs pledge to protect the City

Five top executives from the biggest international banks based in London have 
pledged to work together to protect the City following the Brexit vote

Bosses from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 
Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan issued the promise, after a meeting with 
chancellor George Osborne.

They cite Britain’s “brilliant workforce” and “stable legal systems” as key 
assets.

Here’s the statement:

Britain’s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges which 
we are determined to work together to meet.

We will also work together to identify the new opportunities that may now 
become available so that Britain remains one of the most attractive places in 
the world to do business.

One of Britain’s key economic strengths is that it is a world leading 
financial centre.

It has one of the most stable legal systems in the world, a brilliant 
workforce and deep, liquid capital markets unmatched anywhere else in Europe, 
all of which are underpinned by world class regulators.

In recent years it has established itself as a global hub for renminbi, rupee, 
Islamic finance and green finance, as well as leading in new markets such as 
FinTech.

Today we met and agreed that we would work together to build on all this with 
a common aim to help London retain its position as the leading international 
financial centre.

It’s signed by:

 * Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne 
 * Mr Bill Winters, CBE, (Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered) 
 * Mr Michael Sherwood, (Vice Chairman and co-CEO, Goldman Sachs International)
 * Mr Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, (President (Europe and Emerging markets excl. 
Asia), Bank of America Merrill Lynch) 
 * Mr Robert Rooney, (CEO, Morgan Stanley International) 
 * Mr Viswas Raghavan, (Deputy CEO and Head of Investment Banking (EMEA), JP 
Morgan)

According to the financial markets, there’s a high chance that the Bank of 
England will cut interest rates to new record lows next week.

Ben Brettell of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown has drilled down into the 
interest-rate swaps traded in the City, and reports that they imply:

 * 78% chance of a cut next week [the decision is due on Thursday] 

 * 86% chance of a cut by August, with a 27% chance rates will be 0% by then

 *  89% chance of a cut by December, with a 34% chance rates will be 0% and an 
8% chance rates will be negative by then

He explains:

Initially August had looked more likely, but with economic data deteriorating 
and markets still nervous, it now looks probable the Monetary Policy Committee 
will adjudge that immediate action is warranted.

Time for a recap, after another busy day of financial twists and turns.


Britain has been threatened with the spectre of the pound falling towards 
parity with the US dollar.

Mohamed El-Erian of investment giant Allianz warned that sterling could hit 
record lows, unless politicians get their act together and negotiate a new 
agreement with the EU.

He told Reuters that:

The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the 
structural uncertainty is resolved – if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn’t 
involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for 
sterling to head to parity with the US dollar.

Three investment banks have warned that the pound will fall to $1.20, or 
lower, this year.

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has also weighed in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live?page=with:block-577e40e2e4b04e08d34e31bc#block-577e40e2e4b04e08d34e31bc>
. She fears Britain’s economy will suffer long-term damage if the uncertainty 
following last month’s EU referendum isn’t resolved soon.

Senior bosses at the world’s largest banks have promised to help London retain 
its place as a global financial hub....


...But the boss of JP Morgan has reiterated that thousands of London-based 
jobs will be lost if the City loses its ‘passport’ into the UK.

UK consumers have been warned that the slump in the pound will soon hit their 
purses and wallets:

It’s been a better day in the market, though. The pound clawed its way above 
$1.30, although it has now dipped back towards yesterday’s 31-year lows.

Analysts at Barclays have slashed their growth forecast for next year, 
predicting that the Brexit vote will cause “prolonged uncertainty and financial 
stress.”

They now expect the UK economy to contact by 0.4% next year, down from growth 
of 1.8% previously. They also cut their euro area growth forecast to 0.6%, down 
from 1.7%.

Barclays also see several flashpoints in the months ahead which could even put 
the future of the eurozone in doubt again:

For example, the UK-EU exit negotiations could turn rancorous. And market 
upheaval could be even greater if an EMU country were to actively question EU 
membership; redenomination risk could return.

Hence, investors are likely to pay close attention to the October referendum 
on constitutional reforms in Italy, as well as the general elections in the 
Netherlands, France and Germany in 2017. Any outcome that helps anti-EU 
political parties would likely be poorly received by markets
 
Newsflash: The British economy appears to have contracted last month.

New figures from the National Institute Of Economic and Social Research 
indicate that the economy was weakening, even before Britons headed to the 
polls.

NIESR estimates that the economy grew by 0.6% in the April-June quarter, up 
from 0.4% in January-March. So far so good....
 UK quarterly growth Photograph: NIESR 
But before anyone gets the bunting out, NIERS also estimate that strong growth 
in April fizzled out in May, leading to the economy shrinking in June.


Jack Meaning, Research Fellow at NIESR, explains:

“At first glance this represents a robust rate of quarterly growth for the UK 
economy. However, the quarterly figure masks an important within-quarter 
pattern. Our monthly estimates suggest that April saw a large expansion in GDP, 
which then stagnated in May.

The estimate for June is one of an intensifying contraction across the board, 
but this is not enough to offset the very strong April numbers.

What it does suggest is that when April drops out of the 3 month calculation 
we should see a quick deterioration of growth, especially if the estimated 
contraction in June persists or accelerates into July and beyond.”

Fancy buying a supermarket or an office block? It could be your lucky day.


Somewhere between £3bn to £5bn of direct real estate is now up for sale, as 
commercial real estate funds try to generate cash to pay redemptions to 
investors.

And as it is a buyers market, some assets could be sold pretty cheaply.

Investment bank Jefferies is scathing about the ‘open-ended’ funds which have 
invested in property on the way up. Six funds have now locked the exit doors 
this week; Standard Life, Aviva, M&S, Columbia, Canada Life and Henderson.

Jefferies accuses them of selling “snake oil” to retail investors, by 
guaranteeing liquidity while investing in a notoriously illiquid asset class. 
You can’t just sell a tower block in a few days, which is why redemptions are 
now frozen.

Jefferies analysts predict more pain ahead:

Now the virtuous cycle is turning into a vicious circle of redemptions, REIT 
sales, gating, discounted asset sales, lower fund valuations, and Major (Ret’d) 
& Mrs Smith complaining in the Sunday Times Money Section that they never read 
the small print and then more redemptions etc. etc.

[REIT = real estate investment trusts; companies who generate an income from 
owning commercial property ]
 
Newsflash: Another investment fund has cut the value of its property funds, 
followingL&G and Foreign & Colonial

.

This time it’s CCLA, which invests money for a range of charities, religious 
groups and the public sector. It has lopped 4.5% off the value of its funds, 
which were worth £1.3bn.
 
In another sign of Brexit tensions, rating agency Standard & Poor’s has 
revised down its opinion of several UK banks.

It has cut Barclays’ outlook to negative, from stable, and also lowered Royal 
Bank of Scotland to stable, from positive.

It blames “potential economic deterioration” following the EU vote, and says 
the UK is “entering a correction phase”, in which consumer confidence will 
suffer.
 
There are fresh rumblings in the UK commercial property market, where the 
Brexit vote continues to alarm investors.

Two more funds have announced that the value of their shopping centres, office 
blocks and suchlike has fallen sharply in the last two weeks.

Legal & General cut the value of its £2.3bn property fund by 10% – following a 
5% cut last week – while Foreign & Colonial cut the value of its £290m fund by 
5%.

L&G also warned that it’s too early to know the full impact of the EU 
referendum vote.

Just in: The latest US employment survey has beaten expectations.

Some 172,000 new private sector jobs were created in June, some 13,000 more 
than expected.

We get the main US jobs report tomorrow, the Non-Farm Payroll, and that will 
show if Brexit worries had any impact on hiring last month.

Christine Lagarde also warned that the global economy could suffer if Britain 
enters a limbo state where it delays the process of leaving the EU.

Do we have a forecast and scenario with prolonged uncertainty, total lack of 
clarity, no triggering of Article 50 [the official notification required to 
leave the EU], things staying in limbo for a long period of time? No. We don’t 
have that. We doubt that it would be sustainable politically, geopolitically.

Lagarde warns Trump-style protectionism would hit world economy

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has called on 
Britain to resolve its relationship with the European Union quickly, to limit 
the economic damage of Brexit.

She’s echoing Mohamed El-Erian’s warning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live?page=with:block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b#block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b>
 that uncertainty will hurt the UK economy.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Lagarde says: 


“We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack 
of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and 
decision making.

The IMF believes could UK cushion the impact of leaving the EU by agreeing a 
Norway-style agreement (basically getting access to the single market, but also 
agreeing to EU laws and freedom of movement). That would only cut 1.5% off GDP 
growth by 2019

However, if the UK clatters out of the EU without a new trade deal, it will 
revert to standard WTO tariffs - meaning the economy would be 4.5% smaller than 
otherwise by the end of the decade.The boss of the WTO has already warned that 
this would cost consumers £9bn per year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/wto-eu-uk-consumers-trade-deals>
.

It’s not clear when the UK can deliver the clarity which Lagarde is seeking. 
This morning, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told MPs that the government 
simply isn’t in a position to start ‘substantive negotiations’ with Brussels.

The pound has broken back over the $1.30 mark, away from yesterday’s 31-year 
low of $1.28 (and further away from dollar parity, of course).

It appears that some calm has returned to the markets, after some wild days.

But analysts are expecting sterling to keep dropping.

fastFT have the details:

Deutsche Bank believes that sterling is in line to fall as far as $1.15 
<https://next.ft.com/content/4e9eb89c-69c7-3b92-b195-4fd41a9a02ac>, while HSBC 
has set $1.20 as its target for the end of the year. Goldman Sachs has a 
three-month target of $1.20.

Five top executives from the biggest international banks based in London have 
pledged to work together to protect the City following the Brexit vote

Bosses from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 
Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan issued the promise, after a meeting with 
chancellor George Osborne.

They cite Britain’s “brilliant workforce” and “stable legal systems” as key 
assets.

Here’s the statement:

Britain’s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges which 
we are determined to work together to meet.

We will also work together to identify the new opportunities that may now 
become available so that Britain remains one of the most attractive places in 
the world to do business.

One of Britain’s key economic strengths is that it is a world leading 
financial centre.

It has one of the most stable legal systems in the world, a brilliant 
workforce and deep, liquid capital markets unmatched anywhere else in Europe, 
all of which are underpinned by world class regulators.

In recent years it has established itself as a global hub for renminbi, rupee, 
Islamic finance and green finance, as well as leading in new markets such as 
FinTech.

Today we met and agreed that we would work together to build on all this with 
a common aim to help London retain its position as the leading international 
financial centre.

It’s signed by:

 * Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne 
 * Mr Bill Winters, CBE, (Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered) 
 * Mr Michael Sherwood, (Vice Chairman and co-CEO, Goldman Sachs International)
 * Mr Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, (President (Europe and Emerging markets excl. 
Asia), Bank of America Merrill Lynch) 
 * Mr Robert Rooney, (CEO, Morgan Stanley International) 
 * Mr Viswas Raghavan, (Deputy CEO and Head of Investment Banking (EMEA), JP 
Morgan)  
According to the financial markets, there’s a high chance that the Bank of 
England will cut interest rates to new record lows next week.

Ben Brettell of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown has drilled down into the 
interest-rate swaps traded in the City, and reports that they imply:

 * 78% chance of a cut next week [the decision is due on Thursday] 

 * 86% chance of a cut by August, with a 27% chance rates will be 0% by then

 *  89% chance of a cut by December, with a 34% chance rates will be 0% and an 
8% chance rates will be negative by then

He explains:

Initially August had looked more likely, but with economic data deteriorating 
and markets still nervous, it now looks probable the Monetary Policy Committee 
will adjudge that immediate action is warranted.
