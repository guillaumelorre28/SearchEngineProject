Adblocking <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ad-blocking> has become popular 
because people have become frustrated with ads slowing page load times on the 
internet, particularly on mobile.

A recent report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/01/more-than-nine-million-brits-now-use-adblockers>
 revealed that 22% of the UK’s internet users have an adblocker installed, up 
from 18% just three months earlier, and the figure rises to almost half for 18- 
to 24-year-olds.


But culture secretary John Whittingdale described adblocking as a “protection 
racket”

, saying that it presented an existential threat to the newspaper and music 
industries.

That is in part motivated by the company behind the most popular adblocking 
software, AdBlock Plus, which allows some companies to serve ads if they meet 
its criteria for what make an “acceptable” advert and, if the newspaper or 
other publisher is big enough, they cough up 30% of therevenue they make from 
people using the software.

 Newspapers with websites and other publishers have created much of the 
problem themselves. By trying to maximise the money they make from digital 
readers (already far less than from those in print), many have introduced ever 
more intrusive ads, and ever more intrusive ways of tracking who is seeing them.

 Though most newspapers still rely on declining print advertising and cover 
sales for most of their income, their plans for the future have long relied on 
building huge audiences online and showing them digital ads.

Adblocking throws that future into doubt.

Apple, Facebook and Google have all developed programmes to help publishers 
deliver content and ads more cleanly and quickly, but many are concerned that 
the rapid adoption of adblocking software means the genie is already out of the 
bottle.
