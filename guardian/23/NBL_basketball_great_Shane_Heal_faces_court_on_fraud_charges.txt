Former Australian basketballer and NBL star Shane Heal has faced court accused 
of a $750,000 scam. The 46-year-old former Minnesota Timberwolves and San 
Antonio Spurs NBA guard appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday 
morning on three counts of fraud.

Heal did not enter a plea at the preliminary hearing and the matter was 
adjourned for further mention on 16 December. The former Boomers Olympic star 
has been released on bail.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) alleges the former 
Olympian dishonestly gained benefits of $250,000 from an investor on three 
occasions in 2008 while he was the director of three companies.

Those alleged benefits include a $250,000 investment in Heal’s company Shyfox 
Pty Ltd in 2008, a $250,000 investment in Heal’s company Cre8ive Constructions 
Queensland in 2009, and a $250,000 investment in a third company, 23 
Investments, in 2010. All three companies have since been deregistered.

Heal, who claimed last year to be writing a book about his turbulent life on 
and off the court, is currently working as a TV commentator on NBL games. Ina 
2015 interview with the Courier-Mail

, he claimed that the business interests he developed after his playing career 
once accelerated to the point that he was employing 360 people.
