In five words

History. Neoclassical. River. Messi. Rock.


Sound of the city

Rosario is the city where the Argentine flag was raised for the first time and 
where theNational Flag Memorial <mailto:http://monumentoalabandera.gob.ar/> is 
located, soRosarinos are very proud of their town. This translates into an 
overflowing sense of patriotism and it’s not unusual to see people waving the 
flag or cranking up the National Anthem from their balconies.


Everyone’s tuning into …

Todo Pasa <mailto:https://www.facebook.com/radiofonica> (It gets better) is 
without a doubt the most popularradio show <http://www.radiofonica.com> in the 
city. Hosted by Nacho Russo and Nanci Duggan, and originally a morning show, it 
garnered such a strong following (particularly with younger audiences) that the 
station decided to create an afternoon edition.


The hosts play music, cover current events in an informal, irreverent tone, 
interview Argentine celebrities and interact with their listeners on a regular 
basis.

Cultural bar Distrito Sie7e <mailto:www.facebook.com/distritosie7e> (or D7) on 
Ovidio Lagos Avenue is everything you would expect from the city where Che 
Guevara was born. Soaked in politics and artistic bohemia, this venue presents 
a different musical performance every night, ranging from tango and hip-hop to 
jazz and bossa nova. The founders of the bar always intended for D7 to reach 
beyond the realm of the cultural underground and have founded several 
organisations to support cultural centres, create schools and establish a 
worker cooperative movement.

This city breathes rock, and Vicio is an up-and-coming rock band that has been 
growing steadily in the last five years. Born in the smoky bars of the deep 
Rosario and defined as “classic rock and roll from the 60s and 70s,” the band 
has managed to expand beyond the independent circuits and is now performing at 
music festivals along with other mainstream musicians.

 A cartoon featuring Oily Boogie 
Roberto Fontanarrosa <mailto:http://www.negrofontanarrosa.com/> was a 
Rosario-born cartoonist and writer whose iconic characters transcended his 
country’s borders and found fans in all of Latin America. His two most popular 
creations were a gaucho namedInodoro Pereyra 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inodoro_Pereyra>, who is always having 
philosophical discussions with his dog, and Oily Boogie, a violent sexist, 
racist Vietnam veteran that was born as a parody of Dirty Harry.

Eight years after his death, his comic strips and books continue to be a hit 
among Argentines who consider his texts to be full of wisdom, even when he was 
being politically incorrect.


The look on the street

Rosario is well known for its beautiful people and their infallible sense of 
fashion. No matter where you look, Rosarinos on the street are dressed like 
Hollywood superstars. This cosmopolitan hive of activity sees people dressed to 
impress from morning to night.




Rosario-born Rocío Robles  <https://twitter.com/rocioroblesok>is one of the 
many local models that have gained Instagram fame.


Best cultural Instagram?

Rosarioturismo <mailto:https://instagram.com/rosarioturismo/> is run by the 
city’s official tourism agency. It manages to perfectly capture the city’s 
spirit by mixing images of neoclassical architecture with pop culture 
references involving Lionel Messi.

Everyone’s talking about

The presidential race. With a historic run-off coming up between Daniel Scioli 
and Mauricio Macri – two highly polarising presidential candidates – a meteor 
could be about to hit the city and not even that would manage to change the 
conversation. In a city (and province) run by the Socialist party, keeping 
Peronism at bay has been quite a challenge. And a regime change (no matter who 
wins) will effectively alter the dynamic between the provincial and the 
national governments. For better or for worse.

Rosario is where football superstar Lionel Messi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lionel-messi> was born, so understandably 
people in the city are proud of his legacy. The city is usually referred to as a
semillero (seedbed), an expression used to describe a place where great or very 
talented people come from.

And while the local clubs seem to possess an extraordinary sense of instinct 
when selecting their potential star players, this quality reaches beyond the 
world of football. After all, this is the city that also saw the rise ofLuciana 
Aymar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciana_Aymar>, today considered to be one 
of the greatest female hockey players of all time.

When it comes to sports culture, this is a place that is hard to beat.

Stand up comedy is slowly becoming mainstream in Rosario and bars such as 
McNamara <mailto:http://www.mcnamaramusic.com.ar/> and Café de la Flor 
<mailto:http://www.cafedelaflor.com.ar/> are now turning to comedians during 
the weekend. Francisco Obaid’s show has been making the rounds for a year and a 
half now and has seen its popularity increase after riffing on his numerous 
traumatising experiences in church as a child.

Every November, a festival known as the Fiesta Nacional de las Colectividades 
<mailto:http://www.rosario.gov.ar/web/ciudad/cultura/festivales/encuentro-y-fiesta-nacional-de-colectividades>
 takes over the city and thousands of people from around the country make their 
yearly pilgrimage to Rosario to celebrate the community’s rich cultural 
heritage. Since 1985, over 50 communities made of immigrants – or descendants 
of immigrants – from all over the world join forces to throw a festival that 
includes a lot of eating, drinking and dancing.

Best street art
 Artista busca pared is a project hoping to connect local Rosario residents 
and artists. Photograph: Artista Busca Pared 
Artista busca pared <mailto:www.artistabuscapared.com.ar/> (Artist seeking 
wall) isa street art project 
<http://streetartunitedstates.com/analizarte-artista-busca-pared/> run by Anali 
Chanquia that has been expanding over the city over the last three years. It 
seeks to make Rosario “more beautiful” while looking to create a collaboration 
between locals residents and artists. One needs an empty wall to use as a 
canvas; the other might have one to offer. The results are mesmerising.
