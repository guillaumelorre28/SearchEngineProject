The organisation says modern life is bad for our health and so has launched a 
campaign, One You, aimed at the 83% of 40 to 60-year-olds who are overweight or 
obese, exceed thechief medical officer’s alcohol guidelines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/mens-recommended-maximum-weekly-alcohol-units-cut-14>
 or are physically inactive.


Prof Sir Muir Gray, a clinical adviser to One You, said: “The demands of 
modern day living are taking their toll on the health of the nation and it’s 
those in middle age that are suffering the consequences most, as their 
[ill-]health reaches worrying new levels.


“More than 15 million Britons are living with a long-term health condition, 
and busy lives and desk jobs make it difficult to live healthily. But just 
making a few small changes will have significant benefits to people’s health 
now and in later life.”
