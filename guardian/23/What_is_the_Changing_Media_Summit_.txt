The Guardian’s flagship media event, the Changing Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/changing-media-summit>, returns on 15 and 16 
March 2017.

The event will address restoring faith in the media sector. 

The growing role of social media as a distribution channel for news raises 
important questions around the extent to which our view of the world is being 
distorted by online ‘filter bubbles’.

Readers, fed up with irrelevant and poor quality ads, are increasingly turning 
on adblockers to improve their online experience.


Consumers are also turning their backs on brands that offer empty big, bold 
promises and those that offer unrealistic, stereotypical images of perfection.


In addition, there’s a breakdown of trust between brands and agencies, with 
the recent rebate scandal in the US, and ongoing concern with digital ad fraud 
and viewability, compounding the issue.


Join more than 400 decision-makers from across the media spectrum as we debate 
how the industry can rebuild trust in a post-truth age.


We are always open to our members and the professional community participating 
in shaping the programme. If you have content and speaker ideas, please send
