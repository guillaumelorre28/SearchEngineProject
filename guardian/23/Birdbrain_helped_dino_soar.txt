Scientists say they have solved the mystery of archaeopteryx, a creature that 
lived 150m years ago and is regarded as the earliest known bird. They say they 
have proved it could fly.

Patricio Dominguez Alonso of the University of Madrid and his colleagues 
report in Nature that archaeopteryx, which had the teeth and claws of a 
dinosaur but also feathers and wings, had a brain similar to a modern sparrow's 
- with all the features necessary for flight.

Ever since the first archaeopteryx fossil was discovered, in Bavaria, Germany, 
in 1861, the creature has been at the centre of the debate on the origin of 
birds and flight.

Using state-of-the-art technology, the Madrid team found evidence that 
archaeopteryx could soar. The 2cm skull of a fossil, acquired by the Natural 
History Museum in London in the 19th century, was taken to the University of 
Texas for scanning by x-ray computed tomography, to build a 3D computer model 
of the brain. The tests showed archaeopteryx had good balance and eyesight and 
a brain equipped for flight.

The findings may push the origins of bird flight further back. "If flight was 
this advanced by the time archaeopteryx was around, were birds flying millions 
of years earlier than we'd previously thought?" asked Angela Milner of the 
Natural History Museum.
