Relatives of Debbie Reynolds <https://www.theguardian.com/film/debbie-reynolds>
 and Carrie Fisher hope to organise a joint memorial service for them as 
tributes continued to pour in following their deaths within a day of eachother.

Fisher’s brother Todd said funeral plans were being made and it was “likely” 
his mother and sister would share a joint memorial service. He told the New 
York Daily News: “It’s what we want to do, but we’re still working on the 
mechanics. We like the idea, if it’s at all possible. I think it’s appropriate.”

Reynolds, 84, died from a suspected stroke on Wednesday

, just a day afterFisher, 60, died in hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-dies-star-wars-princess-leia>
. She had suffered a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles on 23 
December.

Todd Fisher said that, shortly before Reynolds fell ill, she had expressed an 
interest in laying her only daughter to rest at the spot where she planned to 
be buried.

He had earlier shared a drawing of his mother and sister, in which they were 
depicted embracing each other as their most famous movie characters.

The sketch, posted on Fisher’s Twitter account, shows his sister Carrie 
dressed as Princess Leia from Star Wars and Reynolds in a raincoat as Kathy 
Selden from Singin’ In The Rain.

Bruce Bozzi, the stepfather to Fisher’s only child, Billie Lourd, wrote a 
heartfelt message saying he was “honoured” to be part of Lourd’s family 
following the loss of her mother and grandmother.

Bozzi, who is married to Fisher’s ex-partner Bryan Lourd, posted a photo of 
Lourd, 24, with Fisher and Reynolds at her university graduation ceremony.

@praisethelourd it's an honor to be your Stepfather. This day, your NYU grad 
day we had so much fun! Yankee Stadium your mom and I laughed our asses off, as 
she kept one fantastic line coming after the other - no less when we all fell 
asleep the night before in the smaller ceremony because it was so boring. Every 
time Carrie looked at me she said " how are you still awake"! Your grandmother 
with our sweet Ava was the kindest most loving. So...as Carrie said to me years 
ago " I'm a good stepmother" I promise I will always be & the strength of these 
women live so vibrantly in you. I've been lucky enough to see this for a 
decade! Many decades to come.....heaven just got a shit load more fun!!!! I 
love you @praisethelourd xo Bru Thursday 12/29/16

“As Carrie said to me years ago ‘I’m a good stepmother’ I promise I will 
always be & the strength of these women live so vibrantly in you.”

Todd Fisher announced Reynolds’ death on Wednesday as he revealed her last 
words were about her late daughter. “She said, ‘I want to be with Carrie’,” he 
said. “And then she was gone.”
