Comments

189 entries, a handful with QUITCH for QUATCH. 14 clues received nominations 
as favourite, the winner by a wide margin being ‘A pointilliste may spatter 
tile with these’ for OIL-PAINTS, with ‘Sleep that’s rapid coming upon the old’ 
(SHUT-EYE) a long way back in second place, in a puzzle that seems to have been 
about average in terms of difficulty.

With entries for No. 2,250 already coming in, I must be brief this month. I 
shall say more in the next slip about the lunch at Wolfson College on 18 July 
to mark this latest Azed milestone. Enough to say here that it was a truly 
memorable occasion for me and my wife Alison, blessed by ideal weather.

WAISTLINE proved unsurprisingly popular, crying out as it did for ‘& lit.’ 
clues, which you duly served up aplenty. See above for the best. Judging the 
entry was like savouring the varied delights of a good meal. My thanks to all 
the cooks, certainly not too many. I managed to finish judging this puzzle in 
time for the Wolfson lunch and was able to announce the prizewinners and also 
the name at the top of this year’s honours list. Many congratulations to Mark 
Barley for again reaching this position, after a consistently good year. He was 
presented with the silver salver from Jeremy Morse, last year’s winner, and 
both spoke tellingly of the fine tradition it represents. My congratulations 
also to all the others on the list. The shifting fortunes of the leading 
contenders from year to year illustrate just how close a contest it always is. 
And my sincere thanks, as always, to Martin Perkins for keeping the score.
