Famous children’s characters such as Dora the Explorer may soon disappear from 
some commercial food packaging in theNetherlands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands> to discourage unhealthy eating 
habits, food industry representatives have said.


The decision was made after “public debates on the impact of advertising 
targeting children”, the umbrella Dutch Food Industry Federation (FNLI) said. 
“Obesity is a problem over which the food industry is greatly concerned.”

The move, a first in Europe, would see popular cartoon characters also

at children

 up to 13 years, said the FNLI, which represents 450 food industry businesses 
and 19 organisations.

The newspaper De Telegraaf said: “These products are placed on shelves at 
childrens’ eye level and are often unhealthy, containing too much salt, sugar 
or fats.”

Dutch health ministry spokeswoman Leonne Gartz said the measures would involve 
characters like Miffy and Dora the Explorer being removed.

“It does not affect characters specific to products,” for instance the tiger 
on a famous cereal brand, she said.

The FNLI hoped that the phasing-out would be implemented during the course of 
2017 following a number of tests to ensure the plan did not lead to unfair 
competition in the market.

The Dutch deputy health minister Martin van Rijn praised the food industry’s 
initiative.

“It’s important to me that children and their parents are spared from the 
constant bombardment of seductive advertising on unhealthy foods,” Van Rijn 
told De Telegraaf.
