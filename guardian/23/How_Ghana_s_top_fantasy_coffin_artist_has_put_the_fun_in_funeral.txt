His work has been bought by US presidents and appears in museum collections 
all over the world – and yet most of Paa Joe’s creations are buried six feet 
underground.


Joe, who turned 69 this week, is Ghana’s most prolific coffin artist and, 
after five decades in the funeral industry producing some of the world’s most 
extravagant designs, his work is being celebrated in a major exhibition in 
Accra.

Joe’s work – which includes coffins in the shape of Porsches, naked women, 
Nike trainers, cameras, Coca-Cola bottles and chilli peppers – is designed to 
represent the life of the deceased, with each item handcrafted and painted for 
the funeral procession, which can last up to three days and three nights.

Working with curator Nana Oforiatta-Ayim, Joe and his son Jacob have developed 
an exhibition that explores the traditions behind the fantasy coffins and their 
particular popularity within the Ga community inGhana

“People celebrate death in Ghana. At a funeral, we have a passion for the 
person leaving us – there are a lot of people, and a lot of noise,” says Jacob, 
28, who has worked with his father for eight years.

Far from seeing their work as morbid, Jacob says the coffins are celebratory 
and reflect west African attitudes to death. “It reminds people that life 
continues after death, that when someone dies they will go on in the afterlife, 
so it is important that they go in style.”

Joe’s creations have attracted high-profile fans: Jacob recalls visits from 
Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, and the ex-US president Jimmy 
Carter, who reportedly purchased two coffins. Bill Clinton also stopped by 
during an official state visit to Ghana in 1998.

Joe discovered coffin-making when he was 16, when his mother sent him to do an 
apprenticeship in the Ga fishing community of Teshie. His uncles, Ajetey and 
Kane Kwei, were prominent fantasy coffin makers in the area in the 1950s, and 
Joe worked with Kane for 12 years before returning to Accra in 1976 to 
establish his own workshop.

His first fantasy coffin, carved in 1978, was in the shape of a building and 
designed for a real-estate developer.

But demand has since slowed, Jacob says. “In Accra, when it was blowing up, we 
would make up to 10 coffins a month,” he says. Now, the pair – who work alone 
at their workshop in Pobiman, 15 miles from the capital – create about two a 
month, though the more complex designs can take longer.

The local price for a coffin for conventional use is equivalent to about 
£1,500, depending on the commission. Those created for exhibitions can fetch up 
to £8,000.

But while Joe’s work has received international recognition – displayed at the 
Pompidou Centre in Paris, the British Museum and the V&A in London, as well as 
the Brooklyn Museum in New York – he has endured financial hardship at home and 
was forced to move his workshop out of central Accra to cheaper premises in 
2008.

“Any time we travel abroad, people in the western world have a huge respect 
for our work, but in Ghana they don’t recognise this as art,” Jacob says.

But this is starting to change, and Oforiatta-Ayim says the exhibition, 
scheduled to be held atANO, a new art space in Accra 
<http://anoghana.org/anos-new-space-in-accra/>, in early 2017, will showcase 
just how significant a role Joe has played in Ghanaian culture.

“What I love so much about the coffins is that they underline this idea of art 
being part of life and death in Ghana,” she says. “His coffins have been so 
prevalent in the birth of contemporary African art in the west.”

Joe is also the subject of a documentary directed by the British film-maker 
Benjamin Wigley <http://benjaminwigley.co.uk/>. Paa Joe and the Lion 
<http://paajoe.artdocs.co.uk/> premiered in the UK in August and follows the 
father and son as they arrive for a one-month residency at Clumber Park 
botanical gardens in Nottinghamshire, where the pair build a lion-shaped coffin.

After the UK screening, Joe received his biggest commission to date: a request 
for a Chevrolet Stingray convertible with room for two people.

With the renewed interest in Joe’s work, Jacob is thinking about how his 
father’s legacy can be protected.

“We are interested in teaching students from abroad, either in Ghana or 
Europe, and we’re hoping to establish some kind of residency,” he says.


But Joe is not hanging up his tools just yet. He continues to produce caskets 
at his workshop but says when he does eventually require one himself, he would 
like his coffin to be in the shape of a hammer.
