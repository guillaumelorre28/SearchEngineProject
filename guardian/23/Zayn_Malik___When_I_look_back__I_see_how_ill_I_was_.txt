Zayn Malik <https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik> has opened up about 
his battles with anxiety, admitting that the pressures of fame often prevented 
him from eating.

The former One Direction star has spoken before about having anxiety

, telling fans it was the reason he was unable to perform at London’s Capital 
Summertime Ball last June.

In a new autobiography, called Zayn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/14/zayn-malik-to-publish-debut-autobiography-aged-23>
, the 23-year-old singer goes further, writing: “When I look back at the images 
of myself from around November 2014, before the final tour, I can see how ill I 
was. Something I’ve never talked about in public before, but which I have come 
to terms with since leaving the band, is that I was suffering from an eating 
disorder.”

Speaking to Associated Press, Malik elaborated on this passage of the book, 
saying that he was often so busy on the road that he wouldn’t eat. “I realised 
that I wasn’t eating as much just down to the amount of work that we were 
doing. Our schedule was kind of crazy, so we were all over the place.”


He added: “It was just more down to losing track of, you know, actually 
eating, and being super busy and getting caught up with other things that 17- 
or 18-year-olds do, which normally entails them going out, drinking or 
partying.”

Malik, however, seemed to distance himself from the claim he had an eating 
disorder. Looking back, he suggested it was more a life-management problem: “I 
was never diagnosed with [an eating disorder],” he said, adding that he’s 
better at managing his diet now.

Malik’s autobiography is published on 1 November.
