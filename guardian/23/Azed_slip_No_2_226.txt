Comments
Only 158 entries, but no mistakes. Favourite clue (by a long way, out of 17 
nominated at least once): 'Touring abroad (having left Britain), part needing 
to be plugged in?' for ADAPTOR. I know some of you dislike Playfairs, 
especially the process of deducing the code word – 'makes me realize I would 
never have been Bletchley Park material' was one comment – but many love them, 
and they don't come up all that often. One senior solver said he first learnt 
about the code when he was in the Scouts about seventy years ago. In more 
recent Playfair competitions I've given hints of some kind to identifying the 
code word to help you a bit, and though many of you expressed gratitude for the 
'double-p' hint, I got the faint feeling that some thought it somewhat 
over-generous. Ah, well. In response to another query, there have been 20 
Playfairs in the AZ series, 12 of them competition puzzles, but they were 
already well-established in the Ximenes repertoire (without hints!), and he may 
well have originated the idea.

I was pleased to chance upon DOUBLE-PARKING. There aren't many of these 
extra-long words without recurrent letters which haven't been used in Playfairs 
before. Though shorter words would do equally well, there's something 
satisfying about such jumbos, especially ones with a decent set of letters. 
(Ximenes once, rather wickedly, used CAB, resulting in only one letter in the 
word square being misplaced!) As it turned out, only two approaches to cluing 
DOUBLE-PARKING predominated, with variations on the 'loading up kerb' anagram 
proving (understandably) so popular that neatness of wording became a crucial 
factor in the judging process. Mr Leyland's double anagram proved especially 
attractive in this regard, and also because the first of the anagrams is far 
from obvious. I was also introduced by a few competitors to what I assume is a 
relatively new meaning of DOUBLE-PARKING, viz the practice of having a second 
drink waiting on the bar beside the one you are currently drinking. Since this 
seems not yet to have caught the attention of lexicographers, I couldn't in all 
fairness place clues that exploited it higher than HC.

I am very grateful to those of you who, having heard of the recent death of my 
mother Joan (at 96), wrote to express their sympathy. It was a merciful release 
in many ways as she had being suffering from advanced dementia for some time, 
but it still feels strange to be without both parents for the first time at the 
age of 72.
