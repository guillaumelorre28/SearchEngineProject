Avram Grant warned his West Ham United players at half-time against West 
Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> that if they 
did not improve their attitude they "would be out", according to a senior 
source in the dressing room at The Hawthorns.

West Ham were 3-0 down following a lacklustre first-half display. "The players 
were told they had two choices," the source said. "They could either feel sorry 
for themselves or try and change the game by adjusting their attitude and 
beginning to press West Brom more. The spirit in the team has been good but 
[the manager] was not happy. [He] was calm but told them that if they did not 
improve they were out."

Carlton Cole revealed after the game that Scott Parker had also given his 
team-mates a rousing speech that helped motivate them.

Regarding Parker's intervention the source added: "It was a surprise as Scott 
does not normally speak and the changing room can be quiet, which is a worry 
[of the manager's]."

Grant had previously shown the squad a league table consisting of their 
previous eight games, which places West Ham in the top half of the division, to 
boost positivity as the players' confidence is also an ongoing concern for the 
Israeli.
