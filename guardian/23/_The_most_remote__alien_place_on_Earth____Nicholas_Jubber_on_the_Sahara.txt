I was six when I first saw the Sahara – sitting on my father’s knee, watching 
Star Wars on the telly. It stuck in my mind as the most remote, alien place on 
Earth (although at the time I thought it was a planet called Tatooine!) Over 
the years, images from the movies (a galloping Peter O’Toole, a burnt Ralph 
Fiennes) reinforced my romantic image of the desert.

On my first journey there, I was thrilled by the scale and emptiness. I loved 
how you could lie at night, warmed by the embers of your fire, gazing at the 
constellations; or how you could stumble upon neolithic rock paintings of 
giraffes and crocodiles – I saw a few on a cliff near Amougjar Pass in 
Mauritania. I loved how history was laid out for you, above and below.

The longer I spent in the Sahara, the less empty it became. Travelling from 
Fez down to Timbuktu, I was fascinated by the desert’s capacity to transform. 
In the caravan town of Ouadane, Mauritania, I wandered through a maze of 
medieval dry-stone houses where the only sign of habitation was the droppings 
of rock hyraxes (rodent-like creatures). But later that evening, hundreds of 
people gathered in a courtyard house for a wedding party, where there were 
swirls of colour from women’s headscarves, the hullabaloo of ululations, and 
frantic dancing to electric guitars and a Moorish lute.

The desert is in a state of constant flux, and life reflects that. Brutal 
winds shift the sand to the unlikeliest places: to the decks of Atlantic 
freighters and mainland Europe. There’s a feeling of perpetual movement. This 
was never clearer to me than in northern Mali. Riding across scrub desert, my 
guide checked the stars to locate his family’s camp, only to discover they had 
moved in search of grazing. He raised a finger to read the starscape, 
re-calibrating our position. After an hour’s tacking, we found them, and 
settled down to the customary three glasses of tea, like commuters after a 
hectic journey.

Staying in nomad camps were some of my happiest experiences. Morocco is the 
safest Saharan country at the moment; I’d recommend Zagora or Merzouga in the 
south-east as a first ports of call. I loved hanging around the tents, taking 
part in daily chores: drawing water, hobbling camels, baking millet-bread (you 
drop it in a pit covered in ash, and turn it over after half an hour). But 
mealtimes could be hard work – as an un-supple leftie I struggled with 
cross-legged, right-handed eating. My bit of carpet would be scattered with so 
much rice that goats would gather around me.

Nomads are driven by adaptability, like the fauna around them. I was 
fascinated by the tracks my guides picked up: snakes, grasshoppers, even hares 
and fennec foxes. Most distinctive are the heart-shaped hoof prints of camels. 
The 19th-century explorer René Caillié called them “a masterpiece of nature’s 
workmanship” and he was right. They can modulate their temperature, reflect 
sunlight off their coats, consume up to 120 litres at a single watering, among 
many other talents. No animal rules the desert like the camel, and spending 
time with them (not just riding them) is one of the region’s real treats.

I had some edgy moments on my journey. There was fighting in Mali, banditry in 
Mauritania, a couple of terrorist incidents in Morocco, and Western Sahara 
languishing under military occupation. A friend insisted on dressing me in a 
Tuareg veil to avoid attention on the way to Timbuktu (there had been a murder 
and multiple kidnappings a few days earlier). Another guided me away from 
trouble in Laayoune through text messages, like something out of a thriller. 
Occasionally, I met people hostile to westerners (in the context of Saharan 
history, it would be odd if you didn’t), but the desert is mostly governed by a 
code of kindness to strangers, the positive values of Islam.

One of my happiest memories is of riding away from a well-keeper’s tent a few 
miles north of Timbuktu. Ismail, the well-keeper, stood on his dune, chanting a 
song of blessing. He only had a few teeth, but the acoustics of the desert 
lifted his words and they floated around us, as resonant as an aria sung in the 
Albert Hall. That’s my favourite thing about the Sahara: its capacity to 
conjure the improbable.
