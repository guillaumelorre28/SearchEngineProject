Alejandro Kozak has the last word as he writes in with the scene in Santiago:

“Santiago, and the whole of Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile>
, has just gone crazy. And tomorrow’s a pubic holiday: the celebration will be 
long and very well lubricated, all accompanied by the best Latin music – and a 
lot of very happy dancing chilenos.”

Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> salute their fans, who 
chant We Are The Champions (the Queen version). Then the players huddle in the 
middle and sing and scream among themselves. The camera cuts to Biglia weeping, 
alone and unconsolable.

Messi is sat down on the subs bench, looking stunned. Argentina’s drought 
continues - it’s now 23 years without a major trophy. WhenChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> went a man down I thought they 
were finished, done. But they hung on. They weren’t pretty tonight but they 
were gritty and showed nerves of steel in the shoot-out. Wow.

Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> were the better 
team in regulation but it would be tough to say Chile don’t deserve to still be 
alive after a stirring comeback from 10 men down (with assistance from the ref).

So the match ends as it did last year, with Argentina

other down. Chile won last year, we will see how it pans out this time shortly.

ET 24 min: Messi wins a free-kick in Messi range. 25 yards out and in the 
middle of the pitch. There’s some low-level grabbing from both teams as they 
assemble the wall. And then it’s Messi ... he glances twice at goal, steps up 
and the shot is deflected over for a corner.

ET 16 min: Corner for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>, their seventh of the evening 
but they can’t do anything with it. Resting Messi in those early matches looks 
like a good idea now. “After calming down during the second half, we’ll soon 
reach the point of the game where Mr Lopes can freely send off another couple 
of players without unduly ruining the spectacle,” says Graham Parker. “Though 
by his own standards of this game, surprised that Funes Mori didn’t get a 
straight red for his studs up tackle early in extra-time.”

ET Half-time: Argentina 0-0 Chile

JR Illinois sums it up: “What do you think the number would be if you added up 
the blood pressures of all the players currently on the pitch? I’m guessing it 
would be something in the neighborhood of 120,000,000,000/80,000,000,000.”

Alejandro Kozak has the last word as he writes in with the scene in Santiago:

“Santiago, and the whole of Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile>
, has just gone crazy. And tomorrow’s a pubic holiday: the celebration will be 
long and very well lubricated, all accompanied by the best Latin music – and a 
lot of very happy dancing chilenos.”
 
Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> salute their fans, who 
chant We Are The Champions (the Queen version). Then the players huddle in the 
middle and sing and scream among themselves. The camera cuts to Biglia weeping, 
alone and unconsolable.
 
Messi is sat down on the subs bench, looking stunned. Argentina’s drought 
continues - it’s now 23 years without a major trophy. WhenChile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> went a man down I thought they 
were finished, done. But they hung on. They weren’t pretty tonight but they 
were gritty and showed nerves of steel in the shoot-out. Wow.
 
Silva to win it. Silva SCORES! Firmly to the right of Romero and Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> are champions again!
 
Biglia steps up. He looks nervous - but you would too. And Bravo saves to his 
left!
 
Beausejour, he’s been playing for Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> for 12 years. And scores with 
power and placement.
 
Aguero is next up. Rolled past Bravo ... just. 
 
Aranguiz scored last year in the final. This time he scores again: Romero is 
stuck on his line.
 
Mascherano scores. Same spot as Castillo. 
 
Castillo, the sub scores. A great penalty, firmly struck. 
 
Messi is next AND MISSES. Way worse than Vidal too way over the bar. Seriously 
over the bar.
 
Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> take first. Vidal is first 
upAND MISSES. Romero saves low to his left. Not a great penalty.
 
Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> were the better 
team in regulation but it would be tough to say Chile don’t deserve to still be 
alive after a stirring comeback from 10 men down (with assistance from the ref).
 
So the match ends as it did last year, with Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and Chile unable to break each 
other down. Chile won last year, we will see how it pans out this time shortly.
 
And so the spot-kicks come. The terrible, terrible shoot out.
 
ET 29 min: Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> slog their way 
forward for one final attack, what an effort from both teams.
 
ET 28 min: Plenty of - understandably - sloppy play after nearly 120 minutes 
of 10 v 10 AFTER a long season of domestic competition.
 
ET 26 min: Chile can’t get it clear - Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> look keen to win it without 
penalties after what happened last season. Kranevitter is the man who ends the 
pressure with a shot over the bar.
 
ET 24 min: Messi wins a free-kick in Messi range. 25 yards out and in the 
middle of the pitch. There’s some low-level grabbing from both teams as they 
assemble the wall. And then it’s Messi ... he glances twice at goal, steps up 
and the shot is deflected over for a corner.
 
ET 22 min: A corner for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> and the sub Lamela takes. But 
fresh legs don’t do much here and Chile head clear.
 
ET 21 min: Lamela is on for Banega. Always painful at this stage looking at 
the faces and knowing one of them is likely to be crumpled in agony after 
missing a penalty shortly.
 
ET 18 min: After a furious end to the first half of extra-time both teams are 
out on their feet and play has slowed. Vargas comes off for Castillo.
 
ET 16 min: Corner for Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina>, their seventh of the evening 
but they can’t do anything with it. Resting Messi in those early matches looks 
like a good idea now. “After calming down during the second half, we’ll soon 
reach the point of the game where Mr Lopes can freely send off another couple 
of players without unduly ruining the spectacle,” says Graham Parker. “Though 
by his own standards of this game, surprised that Funes Mori didn’t get a 
straight red for his studs up tackle early in extra-time.”
 
JR Illinois sums it up: “What do you think the number would be if you added up 
the blood pressures of all the players currently on the pitch? I’m guessing it 
would be something in the neighborhood of 120,000,000,000/80,000,000,000.”
 
ET 14 min: Silva is on for Sanchez, who has clearly played through pain and 
yet still managed to be one of the best players on the pitch.
 
ET 12 min: This is a brilliantly thrilling extra time. Neither side - we’re 
looking at your Croatia and Portugal - is satisfied to sit back and wait for 
penalties.
 
ET 10 min: Bravo, who has been superb tonight, pulls off the save of the 
tournament stretching to tip an Aguero header over the bar. An exceptional save 
at a crucial time in the game.
 
ET 9 min: Oh, Vargas nearly breaks the deadlock. The Chilean’s diving header 
is plucked out of the air by Romero, who does very well to catch it cleanly 
rather than parry in at the feet of an opponent.
