A Chilean judge has questioned the 94-year-old widow of the late dictator 
Augusto Pinochet <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet> over allegations 
she embezzled public funds through a not-for-profit women’s group she ran.

She is suspected of embezzling the proceeds from selling off real estate ceded 
by the state to the Cema-Chile foundation, over which she presided until a few 
weeks ago.

Formerly a training institution for women, the foundation provided popular 
backing for the Pinochet regime, under which thousands of people were abducted 
or killed.

After the dictatorship, Cema transformed into a lucrative property business 
until the embezzlement charges caught up with Hiriart.

The government is suing to recover possession of 135 public properties it says 
were ceded to Cema, worth about $120m.

Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile> marked the 10th anniversary of 
Pinochet’s death on Saturday.

He ruled the country with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990.

He was arrested in London in 1998 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/oct/18/pinochet.chile>, when British 
magistrates ordered him to be extradited to Spain, where judges wanted to try 
him for human rights violations.

However, the British government eventually ordered Pinochet’s release on 
health grounds.

He died in 2006 without ever being brought to justice for crimes committed by 
his regime.
