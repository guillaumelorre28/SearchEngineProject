I guess I am reaching out for any guidance on my marriage. All of a sudden, my 
husband has become cold and distant. I feel as if I have wronged him in some 
way that he cannot forgive, but I have no idea what I have done. I have been 
married to him for nine years, travelling and moving to different towns every 
year for his job. I will admit to him being a big part of my life and us doing 
pretty much everything together, but we usually have a great time. Now he tells 
me he does not think this marriage is fixable, and that I should leave him 
alone and get on with my own life. I am scared, as I am 63 years old and 
financially dependent on him. He simply will not tell me what the problem is.
