Buying land to build on in Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/world/senegal> 
can be a nightmare. There are plenty of empty-looking plots in desirable areas, 
but woe betide the novice buyer.

Scams abound, and any one plot might have five “owners” – each of whom has 
paid and thinks it is all theirs. “Not for sale” is scrawled on walls across 
the country as a rudimentary prevention tactic.

Soon, though, buyers will have an easier way of telling what is really for 
sale, as four young coders have created an app that should thwart the scammers.

The “women in charge”, as Sigeste’s creators call themselves, are uploading 
digitised title deeds from the local authority, so that when you look at a map 
of your area on their app, you can see which bits of land are owned and which 
are still available.

Nellya Maylis, 24, in geek-chic glasses and a bright flowered headwrap, opened 
her laptop to explain how it works.

“These are free bits of land, and these are taken. But only the council can 
see who owns each bit of land – we protect people’s data and don’t share that 
information,” she said, pointing at blue and pink patches on the map.

Maylis and her three friends are ambitious young computer programmers who 
study together in the northern city of Saint-Louis, and are part of a growing 
push to get girls coding in Senegal and several other African countries.

Coding clubs have been set up for girls between the age of five and 24 as part 
of a #RewritingTheCode campaign started by the charityTheirworld 
<http://www.theirworld.org/>, founded by Sarah Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/09/sarah-brown-57-million-children-school-campaign-interview>
, the wife of former British prime minister Gordon Brown. The idea is that 
girls are born with a certain code, a set of expectations about them that say 
that they belong at home, and that careers, particularly in technology, are not 
for them. This code needs to be rewritten, the charity says.

Despite these cultural barriers, Senegalese women have much to offer, 
according to Bitilokho Ndiaye, the adviser on technology and gender at the 
country’s ministry of post and telecommunications. As a young girl, Ndiaye was 
expected to do well in her studies and do a lot of chores at home – something 
that was not asked of her brothers. Her frustration at wanting to achieve 
professionally but being so short of time led her to try to push for more 
equality for girls.

“I can imagine a Senegalese woman at the head of Google without a problem,” 
she said.

So keen is the Senegalese government to get girls into careers in science, 
technology, engineering and maths, it has opened new universities, set up 
technology competitions and held open days in government agencies to show them 
what working in technology looks like. There are more and more jobs being 
created in these sectors, and the government wants to make sure that girls are 
in a position to get them.

“We’ve started a programme to ensure the training of girls in technology and 
everything digital, as we realised that there really aren’t a lot of young 
girls and women in the sector. We’re also trying to push entrepreneurship – to 
give girls what they need to be entrepreneurs in the tech sector,” Ndiaye said. 
“Infrastructure-wise, there’s no obstacle in Senegal. What the obstacle is is 
all of the socio-cultural stereotypes and judgments around the issue of women 
in technology. And we’re trying to deconstruct that stereotype.”

Each year the ministry runs a startup weekend for 100 girls in the telecoms 
sector, where they pitch their ideas for information and communications 
technology projects on anything from health and education to the environment 
and women’s rights. The ministry picks the best ideas and finances them.

A 26-hectare digital park is being built in Senegal’s new “smart city”, 
Diamniadio – aimed at attracting companies from all over the world, growing 
local digital business and increasing e-government services. With $80m in 
funding from the African Development Bank, the government hopes at least 35,000 
jobs will be created there by 2025.

The technology push goes beyond government. Unesco in Dakar is helping young 
women develop mobile apps like Sigeste – and the solutions they are coming up 
with are aimed at solving very local problems.

One app helps people exchange books, which are expensive and in short supply 
in Senegal, and offers online classes. Another helps women track the health of 
their babies, sharing the information with their doctor and giving reminders 
for checkups and vaccinations.

An app being developed will let users report rubbish in the street to the 
local authority, and another helps find lost children.

Maclean for the Guardian 
 This local focus is important to Moussoukoro Diop, a prominent Senegalese 
technology blogger and computer engineer who describes herself as “open in 
spirit, but very anchored in tradition”, who gets homesick and misses her 
mother when she goes abroad, and wants to stem the flow of Senegalese people 
seeking work in the west.

“Above all, I want to show children and young people that in order to succeed 
you don’t need to leave the country,” she said. “You can stay here in Senegal 
and do well. This is a big issue for us – people leave to try to make it, but 
you can stay and be happy and successful. I don’t want to say that the next 
Mark Zuckerberg or head of Google will come from Senegal – rather, we can 
create our own tools that can be exported globally.”

To do this, she said, the country needs to prepare them better for the reality 
of modern work – being a self-starter.

“Entrepreneurship is really important here because it’s difficult to find 
exactly the job that you want, and even if you have a diploma you might still 
not find employment,” Diop said. “People are leaving Senegal to look for work 
as salaried employees, but there’s a lot of opportunity for entrepreneurs in 
Senegal. It’s more important to prepare them for that than to be traditional 
employees. The world of work is changing. And technology and entrepreneurship 
go hand in hand.”

Young women are already doing this, though they may go unnoticed, according to 
Ndiaye.

“Women are dynamic, they build things that may not be visible yet, but you’ll 
be surprised by the contribution to technology that women here will make in 
Senegal and beyond,” she said. “When you hear women talk, you realise that they 
are in fact beyond what the state has proposed for them.”
