The London Stock Exchange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup> Group is to 
sell its 50% stake in the French clearing arm of LCH to Euronext in a €510m 
(£433m) deal.

LSE Group has sold its stake in LCH SA to the European Exchanges operator in a 
move to try to see offanti-trust concerns raised by the European commission 
over its proposed £21bn mega-merger

 with Deutsche Börse.


“The proposed sale of LCH SA would be subject to review and approval by the 
European commission <https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission> in 
connection with the recommended merger of LSEG and Deutsche Börse AG which was 
announced on 16 March 2016,” LSE said in a stock market statement. “It would 
also be conditional on the successful closing of the merger.”


In December, LSE Group received a statement of objections from the European 
commission over its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.


Following the UK vote to leave the European Union in June, LSE and Germany’s 
Deutsche Börse moved quickly toallay fears that the referendum result and 
subsequent Brexit would scupper the deal

.


Details of the merger released before the referendum showed the combined 
entity aims to make €250m in annual cost savings after five years, as well as 
the €450m already flagged, and cut 1,250 jobs.


However, the two exchanges also believe that 550 new roles can be created as a 
result of the tie-up.
