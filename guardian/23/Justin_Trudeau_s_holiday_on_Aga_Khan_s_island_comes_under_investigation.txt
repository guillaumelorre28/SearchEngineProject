Canada’s ethics commissioner is launching an investigation into the recent 
family holiday

 taken by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the Aga Khan’s private island 
in the Bahamas.


Mary Dawson said on Monday that Trudeau may have violated the federal ethics 
code during his holiday with the Aga Khan, the philanthropist and hereditary 
spiritual leader to the world’s Ismaili Muslims who Trudeau says is a family 
friend. It is the first time the ethics commissioner has opted to investigate 
the actions of a sitting prime minister.

In a letter to opposition Conservative politician Blaine Calkins, who was 
among those who filed formal complaints, Dawson said she was looking into 
Trudeau’s stay at the island and his use of the Aga Khan’s private helicopter 
to get there.

Trudeau, his family, Liberal politician Seamus O’Regan and Liberal party 
president Anna Gainey all took a helicopter flight from Nassau to the secluded 
island.

The Conflict of Interest Act and Trudeau’s own ethics guidelines both bar the 
use of sponsored travel in private aircraft, allowing it only for exceptional 
circumstances. The guidelines also prohibit a minister or any member of their 
family from accepting gifts or “advantages” that could reasonably be seen as 
influencing government decisions. The only exception is if the person providing 
the gift is a friend.

Trudeau has repeatedly called the Aga Khan a longtime family friend. He was a 
pallbearer at the funeral of his father, the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

The prime minister’s office said: “As the prime minister said last week, we 
are happy to engage with the commissioner and answer any questions she may 
have.”
