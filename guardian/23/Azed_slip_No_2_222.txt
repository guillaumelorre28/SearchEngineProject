Comments
175 entries, no noticeable mistakes. Favourite clue (by far), among 16 
receiving one or more votes, was 'Who'll render France lawful when it strays?' 
for FLIC. Equal second was 'Reynard's tail behind, brush-like' for DAFT, though 
I've a sneaking feeling I might have used the idea, if not the precise wording, 
before. (I never deliberately reuse an old clue verbatim, no matter how pleased 
I was with it first time round.) Another clue, which received a few votes of 
approval, was actually flawed: in 'Being so makes car drive off, instinctively' 
(IN SE) the final word should have been 'intrinsically', which I keyed 
incorrectly and then failed to spot the error at proof stage. A few of you 
clearly saw that something was amiss by querying my definition. I do apologize.

There were lots of good ideas, nicely realized, for a not very inspiring 
compound noun. Picking the best was uncommonly tricky. The three prizewinners I 
chose in the end on the naturalness of their wording, a factor always worth 
keeping in mind when composing your entries. The less a clue reads like a clue, 
i.e. something that would sound odd in any other context than that of a 
crossword, the better, I feel. A fair number of you dealt with the LESSON part 
as LESS ON. Nothing wrong with that, but too often it was clued by 'wearing 
fewer clothes' or something similar, which isn't quite right: 'wearing fewer 
clothes' leads to 'having less on'. Such fine syntactical distinctions are most 
important.

The comments I received on my question regarding my use of Mrs/Ms in slips, 
etc (for which many thanks) were overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the 
status quo. (The only time I don't use Mrs is for husband-and-wife teams, where 
logic would demand both Mr and Mrs, though this seems too pernickety.) There 
was also a universal welcome for my decision to accept all abbreviations in 
Chambers in future. I'm just sorry it's taken me so long! And yes, I'm also 
happy to accept the use of international radio communication code words such as 
alpha, bravo, etc.

While on the subject of Chambers, I've had the following update from the 
'project editor': 'The situation with The Chambers Dictionary, 13th edition is 
that we can [sic] to reprint it later this year, although we do not have a set 
date for this yet. It would not be cost effective to pulp our current stock and 
to reprint the book just yet so our next reprint will be based on shifting our 
current stock. We do have the missing words list available on the Chambers 
website as a printable PDF for those who have purchased the 13th edition.' This 
strikes me as pretty outrageous and I shall say so. If you feel like 
complaining direct to the publishers, please do. Meanwhile I shall continue to 
recommend the new edition, but this should not inconvenience those who have not 
yet bought it.
