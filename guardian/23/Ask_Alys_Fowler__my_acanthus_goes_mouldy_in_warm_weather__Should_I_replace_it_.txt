At the first blink of warmth, my beautiful acanthus is covered in mouldy white 
spots (black underneath) that kill the leaves, attracting snails, which then 
eat the few surviving leaves. Should I admit defeat?

Powdery mildew is a natural part of gardening – it happens to a wide variety 
of plants. The simplest solution is a shedload of muck. Youracanthus 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=15> (aka bear’s breeches) is too 
dry and there’s not enough air circulation around the plant, which is making 
perfect conditions for powdery mildew. Add a lot more mulch around the base of 
the plants – go crazy with leaf mould or homemade compost, and thin out the 
plants so that the air can move more freely. Remove infected leaves 
immediately; if you allow them to decompose into the soil there will be more 
spores the following spring.

If you’ve chosen a spot where you can’t thin out the plants or increase air 
circulation, consider trying something else that will cope with these 
conditions. Our native shield fern (Polystichum aculeatum 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/25900/Hard-shield-fern/Details>) will cope, as 
willP. setiferum ‘Herrenhausen’

, an elegant, finely divided, soft-shield fern. Both are a similar size to your 
acanthus.
