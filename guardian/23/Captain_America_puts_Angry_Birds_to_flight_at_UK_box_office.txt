Decent weather and a lack of strong commercially appealing new releases saw a 
continuing decline in UK box office, down 13% on the previous session, and 33% 
below the equivalent frame from 2015, whenPitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/pitch-perfect-2-anna-kendrick-review>
 topped the chart. Disney Marvel’sCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 resisted the challenge of Sony Animation’sThe Angry Birds Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/the-angry-birds-movie-review-game-spin-off-that-doesnt-quite-reach-lego-movie-levels>
, hanging on to the top spot for the third week, and with a decent 42% decline. 
After 17 days, the box office is a robust £32.2m. Civil War is the fourth 2016 
release to cross £30m here, followingDeadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill>
 andThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review>. Civil 
War is just behind the pace of Batman v Superman, which stood at £33.3m at the 
same stage of its run.

The runner-up: The Angry Birds Movie

Sony’s adaptation of the Rovio game debuted with a so-so £2.12m. The biggest 
animated hit so far this year is Disney’sZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
, which debuted in March with £5.31m, including previews of £1.73m. The Angry 
Birds Movie would probably have made a splashier debut had it arrived in 2013 
when development of the film was announced – but lengthy production schedules 
for animated features tend to resist any attempt by studios to speed them up.

The 2016 champ: The Jungle Book

Jon Favreau: ‘Whenever I hear Garry Shandling’s voice in The Jungle Book, it’s 
sobering’

Still in the box-office top three in its fifth week of play, and with £39.3m, 
Disney’s The Jungle Book has just overtaken Fox-Marvel’s Deadpool (£37.9m) to 
become the biggest hit of the year so far. Takings were just 24% down on the 
previous weekend – evidence that audience word of mouth continues to hold up on 
the Rudyard Kipling adaptation. The film looks certain to overtake the lifetime 
total ofAlice in Wonderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review> 
(£42.5m) and could well catchThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and 
the Wardrobe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/dec/02/thechroniclesofnarniafilms.cslewis>
 (£44.4m) – two family titles that far exceeded box-office expectations.

A quintet of mid-size films was released collectively on 721 screens, 
delivering a poor total of £783,000, including previews. Best result was 
achieved by John le Carré adaptationOur Kind of Traitor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/our-kind-of-traitor-review-ewan-mcgregor-le-carre-potboiler>
, starring Ewan McGregor, Naomie Harris, Damian Lewis and Stellan Skarsgård: 
£358,000 from 245 sites, yielding an average of £1,461.

Critical support couldn’t push Richard Linklater’s campus comedy Everybody 
Wants Some!! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/everybody-wants-some-review-richard-linklaters-sports-jock-comedy-is-a-winner>
 very far, despite the director coming off the widely admired Oscar winner
Boyhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/boyhood-review-richard-linklater-film>
. It debuted with £170,000 from 111 cinemas, but that includes £35,000 in 
previews. For comparison, Boyhood kicked off in July 2014 with £333,000 from 89 
cinemas. Commercial chances for the new film may not have been helped in the UK 
by the profusion of college baseball players among principal characters – a 
fact that the trailer could not hide. The look and feel of the film also 
appeared very male, and it was certainly a challenge to communicate the 
disarming sweetness that gradually emerges.

Landing just inside the Top 10 is Jeremy Saulnier’s 18-rated Green Room 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/green-room-review-horror-cannes-film-festival-2015-patrick-stewart>
, starring Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and Patrick Stewart. A debut of £145,000 
from 136 sites includes previews of £49,000. Strip those out, and the film’s 
screen average falls to a weak £706.

All of the aforementioned new releases look like hits when compared with the 
two films that round out the quintet:Whiskey Tango Foxtrot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/whiskey-tango-foxtrot-review-tina-fey-afghanistan-war-reporting>
 andThe Darkness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/the-darkness-review-kevin-bacon-horror-film>
. Both landed outside the Top 10. The former, a Tina Fey comedy drama based on 
US journalist Kim Barker’s memoir The Taliban Shuffle, struggled to define its 
audience, debuting in 12th place with £59,000 from 123 sites for a £478 
average. Three places below it is horror title The Darkness, starring Jennifer 
Mason and Kevin Bacon, which kicks off with a limp £51,000 from 106 sites, for 
a similar average of £486. MetaCritic score is a poor 28/100.

It’s hard to escape the conclusion that, in at least a couple of cases, 
commercially problematic films were being pushed into the marketplace in what 
has been a relatively fallow period between Captain America: Civil War and the 
forthcomingX-Men: Apocalypse

third in the series to feature James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer 
Lawrence, and the eighth appearance for Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine.
