Closing post: Wall Street posts biggest jump since March

DING DING! Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, 
as the closing bell brings today’s rally to a halt.

Predictions of a Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> election victory have 
cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&P 
500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as 
investors piled back into shares.

This followed a strong rally in Europe, where London’s FTSE 100 posted a 
triple-digit gain

Chris Beauchamp of IG says we’ve seen a buying stampede today:

According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the 
favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been 
heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant 
memory.

With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of 
potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow 
if the battleground states remain in close contention.

As we’ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI’s decision to 
clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate 
a last-minute lift.

But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton 
is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania 
will determine who wins the White House.

And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here’s 
a flavour of our latest news story:

The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination 
battles began – in the rustbelt – as Hillary Clinton andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> spent the last hours of a 
bitter election focused on the country’s deep economic divide.

Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion 
polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point 
already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump’s 
anti-immigration rhetoric.

But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world 
was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to 
victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger 
over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, 
though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including 
Florida and North Carolina to win outright.


Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources 
into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar 
anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. 
Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before 
planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce 
Springsteen....

Shares in shipping, logistics and transport companies are having a 
particularly good day, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.8% 
in late trading.

The index has gained 19% since January, which is significant as it’s often 
seen as a bellwether for the wider economy (companies don’t ship as much if 
they’re losing business).

Analysts reckon that the transport sector would do well under a Clinton or 
Trump presidency, as both have promised spending on infrastructure.

The British pound continues to be buffeted by the sudden strength of the US 
dollar today.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has shed one cent, or 
0.9%, today and is currently hovering around $1.24.

The dollar is up around 0.75% against a basket of currencies today, including 
the euro and the yen. That’s (yet) another sign that investors are pricing in a 
Clinton victory.

Constellation Brands, which imports beers such as Mexico’s Corona, has joined 
the Mexican Peso as a surprise proxy for Trump success.


Shares in Constellation have jumped by 4% today, having fallen pretty steadily 
through November.

Trump’s anti-Mexico rhetoric has worried many US firms who import from Mexico, 
as he has pledged to shake up trade links between the two countries.

Wall Street on track for a good day

today. Photograph: Richard Drew/AP 
With less than 90 minutes to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still 
on a tear and on track for its best day’s trading since March.

Signs that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has a better chance of 
winning tomorrow’s election are driving share higher, despite many polls 
suggesting she only has a narrow lead over Donald Trump.

Here’s the situation on the trading floors:

 * Dow Jones: up 335 points or 1.8% at 18,223

 * S&P 500: Up 43 points or 2% at 2,128

 * Nasdaq: Up 111 points or 2.4% at 4,771

With Clinton seen as the more status quo option, investors are aware that the 
markets could tumble ifDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> stages a surprise victory.

Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North 
Carolina, says (via Reuters):

“I don’t see another 5 percent bump on a Clinton win, but I could see a 5 to 7 
percent pullback on a Trump win.”

Today’s stock market rally has added tens of billions of dollars to the wealth 
of the world’s richest people.

Bloomberg Billionaires Index

, which tracks those with more money then they could possibly know what to do 
with, has jumped by 0.9% today to $4.4 trillion, a gain of $37bn.

Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, gained $2.7bn, while Mexico’s richesst man, 
Carlos Slim, gained a far from slimline $2.2nbn.

Well done chaps. And now we know who’ll suffer if the markets have a meltdown 
on Wednesday.....

DING DING! Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, 
as the closing bell brings today’s rally to a halt.

Predictions of a Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> election victory have 
cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&P 
500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as 
investors piled back into shares.

This followed a strong rally in Europe, where London’s FTSE 100 posted a 
triple-digit gain

Chris Beauchamp of IG says we’ve seen a buying stampede today:

According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the 
favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been 
heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant 
memory.

With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of 
potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow 
if the battleground states remain in close contention.

As we’ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI’s decision to 
clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate 
a last-minute lift.

But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton 
is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania 
will determine who wins the White House.

And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here’s 
a flavour of our latest news story:

The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination 
battles began – in the rustbelt – as Hillary Clinton andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> spent the last hours of a 
bitter election focused on the country’s deep economic divide.

Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion 
polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point 
already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump’s 
anti-immigration rhetoric.

But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world 
was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to 
victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger 
over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, 
though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including 
Florida and North Carolina to win outright.


Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources 
into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar 
anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. 
Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before 
planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce 
Springsteen....

Shares in shipping, logistics and transport companies are having a 
particularly good day, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.8% 
in late trading.

The index has gained 19% since January, which is significant as it’s often 
seen as a bellwether for the wider economy (companies don’t ship as much if 
they’re losing business).

Analysts reckon that the transport sector would do well under a Clinton or 
Trump presidency, as both have promised spending on infrastructure.

The British pound continues to be buffeted by the sudden strength of the US 
dollar today.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has shed one cent, or 
0.9%, today and is currently hovering around $1.24.

The dollar is up around 0.75% against a basket of currencies today, including 
the euro and the yen. That’s (yet) another sign that investors are pricing in a 
Clinton victory.

Constellation Brands, which imports beers such as Mexico’s Corona, has joined 
the Mexican Peso as a surprise proxy for Trump success.


Shares in Constellation have jumped by 4% today, having fallen pretty steadily 
through November.

Trump’s anti-Mexico rhetoric has worried many US firms who import from Mexico, 
as he has pledged to shake up trade links between the two countries.

With less than 90 minutes to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still 
on a tear and on track for its best day’s trading since March.

Signs that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has a better chance of 
winning tomorrow’s election are driving share higher, despite many polls 
suggesting she only has a narrow lead over Donald Trump.

Here’s the situation on the trading floors:

 * Dow Jones: up 335 points or 1.8% at 18,223

 * S&P 500: Up 43 points or 2% at 2,128

 * Nasdaq: Up 111 points or 2.4% at 4,771

With Clinton seen as the more status quo option, investors are aware that the 
markets could tumble ifDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> stages a surprise victory.

Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North 
Carolina, says (via Reuters):

“I don’t see another 5 percent bump on a Clinton win, but I could see a 5 to 7 
percent pullback on a Trump win.”
 
The gold price is continuing to slide today, as traders put their money into 
riskier assets.

Bullion is down 1.8% right now at $1,280 per ounce, down from $1,304 on Friday 
night.

with, has jumped by 0.9% today to $4.4 trillion, a gain of $37bn.
