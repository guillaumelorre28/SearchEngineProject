As he releases two documentaries in one week, Werner Herzog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/wernerherzog>, aged 74, remains as fascinated 
as ever by both creation and destruction. In Lo And Behold, Reveries Of The 
Connected World he takes flight across the digital cosmos of the internet; in 
Into The Inferno, he explores his enduring obsession with volcanoes.

His basalt bug began in 1977, when Herzog journeyed to La Soufrière in 
Guadeloupe. Volcanologists said it would blow imminently (it didn’t) and Herzog 
came back with a film about it. Later, in Encounters At The End Of The World 
(2007), he stood on Antarctica’s Erebus as it vomited blocks of boiling rock 
above him. There he met volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer, whose writings 
inspired Into The Inferno.

For this film the pair visited six volcanoes around the world, filming not 
just the formations themselves but also the societies around them and their 
complex volcano-inspired belief systems. We see how former cannibal tribes in 
Indonesia respond with offerings and songs. We hear the Norse legends of 
Iceland’s volcanic origins, inscribed in the 13th-century Codex Regius. And 
weirdest of all, we see how the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has 
co-opted the ancient legends of Korea’s seismic origins: its most famous 
volcano is now “the sacred mountain of the revolution”, omnipresent in the 
state’s propaganda and art.

There’s lots of lava. Herzog shoves his cameras down the earth’s throat amid 
lashing serpent-tongues of magma. These brightly glowing but deadly rivers are 
a sinister sister-liquid to the ebony lakes of spilled Kuwaiti oil in Herzog’s 
post-apocalyptic tone poem Lessons Of Darkness (1992). Herzog is entranced by 
cataclysm, engulfment by lava and ash, by endings. But, for him, volcanoes also 
signify beginnings: our terrestrial origins, the first ash in “ashes to ashes”, 
and often the last, too. Origin and terminus: they recur throughout Herzog’s 
work, whether the first cave paintings (Cave Of Forgotten Dreams, 2010) or the 
last days of a death row inmate’s life (2011’s Into The Abyss).

Alpha and omega resurface in Lo And Behold, his sketchbook-like look at 
aspects of the internet, including its Big Bang-like origins and conceivable 
apocalyptic consequences. Here, the internet is another of Herzog’s feverish 
Darwinian universes: no less cosmic in its enormity and implications than 
nature or time; both slave and master to us; and ultimately unfathomable. It’s 
another savage kingdom in which Herzog can seek ecstasy and the sublime among 
the entrancing horrors and delights.

Into The Inferno is available on Netflix from Friday; Lo And Behold is in 
cinemas from Friday
