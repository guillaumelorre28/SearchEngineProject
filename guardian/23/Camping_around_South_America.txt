South America is all about the freedom of the great outdoors. That’s what we 
have been embracing during a 1,500-day, 44,000-mile campervan trip that’s taken 
my husband Jeremy and I to hundreds of camping spots – from Colombia’s 
Caribbean coast through deserts and plains, around volcanoes and over the Andes 
down to the continent’s most southerly tip: wind-whipped Tierra del Fuego.

We’ve woken up on tranquil beaches, beside sparkling highland lakes, at the 
foot of snowy mountains and in plenty of petrol stations. In four years we’ve 
learned a thing or two about camping and living with the elements, from hot and 
bug-infested to downright freezing … and we have never felt more free.

South America may not be as well-known for camping as Europe or North America, 
but the continent is rich with opportunities for a camping holiday of any 
duration. Whether you’re backpacking with a tent, or hiring a car or motorhome, 
here are a few tips and our favourite discoveries for unforgettable nights 
under the stars.
• Unless stated, campsites are open all year and reservations are not 
required. Tent hire is available at some sites. Prices rounded to the nearest 
pound.

coast. Photograph: Alamy 
Tourism in Colombia is increasing as the country has become safer, and camping 
has recently been embraced in a big way. Good coastal spots for camping include 
the area around Palomino and the Tayrona national park on the Caribbean coast, 
east of Cartagena. The Andes region and coffee country are also attractive 
places to pitch up. Vehicle hire is not common though, and driving conditions 
can be on the hairy side.


1 Desert camping, Villavieja
Colombia’s Tatacoa Desert takes sleeping under the stars to a whole new level. 
Camp out, rustic-style, at the Observatorio Astronómico de la Tatacoa, 4km east 
of Villavieja. It’s also possible to wild camp or pitch up alongside cabins or 
restaurants – look for camping signs. Once the sun has set – an extraordinary 
sight in itself as the rock formations turn pink – it’s eyes upwards to take in 
the stars.

2 Finca San Pedro, Sogamoso, Boyacá
The English-speaking owner of this pretty farm well off the beaten track runs 
Agama yoga courses and organises hikes to see the unique flora of the Andes’ 
Páramo de Ocetá, a landscape that only exists in high mountains in tropical 
areas.

 A view of Imbabura volcano from Rose Cottage. Photograph: Paula Dear 
There are a number of superb campsites in the country, including in its 
network of national parks and reserves, and along the Pacific coast. There are 
even a few designated camping areas on the Galapagos Islands. Decent main roads 
make it more attractive for vehicle hire than neighbouring countries.

5 Rose Cottage, Mojandita, Otavalo
As the name might suggest, this Andean resting spot is part-British owned, 
which also shows in the country-garden flowers and cutesy cabins. The hammocks, 
with views of multiple volcanoes, are undeniably more Ecuador than England 
though. It’s a 3km walk to the northern Ecuadorian town of Otavalo, with its 
famous craft market and Saturday animal fair, where some vendors trade guinea 
pigs to eat. Quito is two hours’ drive to the south.

6 Tambopaxi, Cotopaxi national park 
There can be few more dramatic places to camp than beneath one of the world’s 
tallest active volcanoes. This hostel and campsite has a privileged position at 
the foot of 5,897-metre Cotopaxi, a perfect snow-cone surrounded by Andean 
grasslands. Prepare for chilly nights – the fact it’s almost on the equator is 
outweighed by the camping ground’s altitude of almost 4,000 metres. Beyond 
Tambopaxi the national park has several rustic, but free, designated camping 
areas, but visitors should ensure they arrive before the national park entrance 
closes at 3pm. The park is two hours’ drive south of Quito.

 Colibri Camping, near La Paz. Photograph: Paula Dear 
Camping in Bolivia is still a low key affair but there’s a growing network of 
quality sites in popular areas such asSorata 
<http://www.hosteltrail.com/hostels/altaioasis>, Samaipata 
<http://eljardinsamaipata.blogspot.com.ar/p/hostalcamping.html>, Coroico and La 
Paz. Elsewhere, it’s possible to get creative by asking to stay in the gardens 
of out-of-town restaurants or hotels. Wild camping is common around the 
other-wordly salt flats and lakes of the altiplano in the Andean south-west and 
the Jesuit mission towns of the eastern lowlands. In the highlands, allow time 
for acclimatising to the altitude and prepare for potentially cold, windy 
weather. Vehicle hire for foreigners is not common.

7 Sol y Luna Eco-Lodge, Coroico, Yungas 
This is a tranquil resting spot in a sub-tropical cloud forest near the bottom 
of Bolivia’s infamous “Death Road” – otherwise known as the Yungas Road, which 
claimed scores of lives annually until new sections were opened in 2006, 
bypassing the dangerous stretches. Following the trails through the campsite’s 
huge garden is a fascinating wander in itself, especially for birders. The 
garden camping area is near one of two swimming pools, and the site boasts a 
restaurant, Wi-Fi, yoga and meditation room. It’s just under three hours’ drive 
from La Paz.

8 Colibri Camping, Mallasa, La Paz
Perched high above a river valley with incredible views, this is a friendly 
British/Bolivian-owned outfit in a village with a rural feel. It’s close to the 
Valley of the Moon and 30 minutes from La Paz. Cooking classes, horse-riding 
and language lessons are available. There’s an outdoor kitchen and hot-tub, 
plus teepees and a cabin for glamping.

 Camping in the garden of Hostel Naylamp. Photograph: Paula Dear 
The organised camping scene in Peru tends to align with the areas where 
tourists concentrate. Sites can be most easily found in the surfy beach areas 
of the north coast, and popular destinations like the Sacred Valley. In between 
the obvious locations, some improvisation might be needed. Hotel gardens are 
often a good bet – it’s worth asking on spec, especially in low season. Vehicle 
hire is not common.

9 Hostel Naylamp, Huanchaco, Trujillo
There is a walled garden for tents at this hostel, which is across the road 
from Huanchaco’s long sandy surfing beach. Motorhomers can useHuanchaco Gardens

has Wi-Fi, a swimming pool and restaurant.

10 Camping Quinta LaLa, Cusco
This site, which attracts overlanding vehicles and tents, has only basic 
facilities, but what it lacks in luxury it makes up for by being quiet, secure 
and within walking distance of Cusco, Peru’s most stunning, and heavily 
touristed, colonial city, the capital of the Inca empire at the time of the 
Spanish conquest. It’s also very close to the Sacsaywamán ruins. Quinta LaLa’s 
friendly owners have good knowledge of trips and logistics. Drivers can store 
vehicles here if trekking or taking the train to Machu Picchu.

This campsite in the Pan de Azúcar national park looks directly on to the 
island home of about 2,000 Humboldt penguins, plus marine otters, sea lions and 
pelicans. It’s located in an area of wild coastal desert – so don’t expect hot

and boat trips to the island to see the penguins.

the day to grill unfeasible quantities of meat and enjoy family time. Alongside 
hundreds of private campgrounds, it’s the only country in South America where 
municipal sites – usually simple, well-maintained public spaces – are 
guaranteed in most towns. It’s also acceptable for vehicle campers to sleep for 
no charge at petrol stations. The Argentina Super Atlas (available fromStanfords

20 Lakeside Camping Hain, Tolhuin, Tierra del Fuego 
This site is as much a work of art as a campsite. Its energetic owner has 
turned it into an installation of colourful recycled junk, such as bottle 
“trees”. To counter the fierce winds, there are wooden teepees for tents to 
nestle in. The fire-heated kitchen contains commemorative plaques from 
travellers who have made it to remote Tierra del Fuego.
