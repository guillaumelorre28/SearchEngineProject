I planted a few agapanthus bulbs last spring in a large pot with new potting 
compost, but they only produced leaves. Should I dig them up and replant?

Agapanthus doesn’t want to be neglected altogether, but does take its time. 
Then when you’ve almost given up on it, the flowers do their thing and you 
remember why you like agapanthus so much.

As far as a pot is concerned, agapanthus likes to be hugged very tightly and 
baked in the sun in a very small container – a strange sort of fetish, but when 
you understand that agapanthus grows in very free-draining rocky spots in South 
Africa with small root space, it makes more sense. And you need to keep 
agapanthus on a strict diet: it may be that your compost is a little too rich 
at present, and as the nutrients are used up, flowers will follow.

But mostly I think you’re imagining a big fat pot of agapanthus, such as the 
sort you see in glossy magazines; these are large, established specimens and 
you have a few bulbs. Plants dislike being endlessly disturbed, so don’t dig 
them up. Be patient, and allow your agapanthus to grow into their roomy 
conditions.
