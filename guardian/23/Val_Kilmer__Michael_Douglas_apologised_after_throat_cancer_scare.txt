Michael Douglas has apologised for the incautious remark in which he claimed 
that fellow actor Val Kilmer wassuffering from the same form of throat cancer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/02/val-kilmer-denies-he-has-cancer-after-michael-douglas-claims>
 that had affected Douglas.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday 
<https://www.facebook.com/valkilmer/posts/1333274326704272>, Kilmer wrote: 
“Michael Douglas wrote me a nice note apologizing for suggesting to the press 
overseas, I ‘wasn’t doing too well …’ and was grateful to hear I am doing well. 
He’s a classy guy.”

Douglas had originally sparked widespread alarm by stating during a Q&A in 
London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/02/val-kilmer-denies-he-has-cancer-after-michael-douglas-claims>
 on 30 October that Kilmer, with whom he had worked on the 1996 film The Ghost 
and the Darkness, was “a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had, 
and things don’t look too good for him”.

Kilmer denied the story two days later, writing: “I love Michael Douglas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-douglas> but he is misinformed … [I] 
have no cancer whatsoever.”
