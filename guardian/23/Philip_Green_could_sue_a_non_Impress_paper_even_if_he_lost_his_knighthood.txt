There’ll be time enough later this week to weigh the impact of section 40 of 
the Crime and Courts Act going live if Impress, the would-be press regulator, 
is deemed fit for Royal Charter purpose. But it’s difficult even now, as Sir 
Philip Green becomes plain Phil – at least at the hands of MPsshouting 
“billionaire spiv”

 – not to ponder what section 40 might mean in any notional case brought by 
Green against a non-Impress paper (from theGuardian and FT to the Mail). Plain 
Phil could lose big – but he’d still win the costs on both sides. A newspaper 
would lose hundreds of thousands of pounds in victory.

No, the BBC and ITN aren’t affected here. Nor is BuzzFeed, the HuffPost or 
Vice. This is one post-Leveson legacy reserved for newspapering alone. And 
looking increasingly idiotic.
