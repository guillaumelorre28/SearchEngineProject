Wolfgang Blau, the Guardian’s director of digital strategy, is joining Vogue 
and Vanity Fair publisher Condé Nast International as chief digital officer.

Blau, who has worked at the Guardian since 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/16/guardian-wolfgang-blau-digital-strategy>
 and serves on the executive committee, will take up the new role on 1 December.

“Wolfgang brings a commitment to journalistic excellence, a deep knowledge of 
all things digital and international scope to the position. He is the ideal 
person to take on this hugely important role,” said Jonathan Newhouse, the 
publisher’s chairman and chief executive.

Blau will take on responsibility for digital activities across Condé Nast 
International’s portfolio of magazines, which include GQ and Wired, as well as 
joining the publisher’s executive committee.

“I am delighted to take on this new assignment,” said Blau. “As a family owned 
journalistic enterprise, Condé Nast has enormous resources and talent and has a 
rare, long-term perspective. This presents a unique opportunity.”

“My two-and-a-half years at The Guardian have been very exciting, from the 
Snowden story which broke only a few weeks after I joined, to our work together 
on the Guardian’s new sites and apps, the hustings for a new chief editor and 
our climate change campaign earlier this year - all of it was a privilege to be 
part of. I will remain a close friend ofThe Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> in years to come.”


Blau previously edited Zeit Online – the digital publication of the weekly 
German newspaper Die Zeit – for five years. Some of his responsibilities at the 
Guardian will be taken on by acting chief digital officer Aron Pilhofer.

He was one of four internal candidates to apply for the role of 
editor-in-chief of the Guardian in early 2015.
