 ‘He kicked off the modern golden age of television’: Steven Bochco. 
Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP 
I’m reading this at the moment. Steven Bochco is a hugely successful American 
TV producer. He createdLA Law 
<http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/steven-bochco-l-a-law-reboot-1201827966/> and 
Hill Street Blues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/17/hill-street-blues-1981-emmy-awards>
 – a groundbreaking show which had many story lines, several leading 
characters, and changed the dynamic of TV drama. It kicked off the modern 
golden age of television – he basically invented the modern hour-long TV drama. 
He has some great anecdotes in this book about actors and their behaviour – he 
wrote for the first season ofColumbo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/23/natalie-haynes-detectives-columbo>
 and apparently Peter Falk wasn’t well behaved. Bochco has a nice turn of 
phrase and a way of bringing the industry to life in a way that I very much 
recognise.

 ‘You work out clues from the things around you’: Locked Canada. Photograph: 
Lockedcanada.com 
A few weeks ago I went to an “escape room” with some other cast members 
[Harewood is filmingSupergirl season 2 
<http://supergirl.wikia.com/wiki/Season_2> in Vancouver] and it was really good 
fun. You go to a warehouse, choose from different experiences, such as zombies, 
and you have to make your way out of a room. There are obscure questions and 
puzzles, and you work out the clues from the things around you – such as a 
calculator and paper, or things written on the wall in red, like blood. The 
room we chose was difficult, I think only 5% had ever got out of it. We didn’t 
get out of it.

 ‘It’s bizarre but looks incredible’: Anthony Hopkins in Westworld. Photograph:

I am really into Westworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/04/westworld-review-seamless-marriage-cowboys-dystopians>
 right now: it’s become my new go-to fix. The writing and acting are second to 
none. It’s such a clever take on the original movie, trying to work out who’s 
human and who’s not. It’s about an amusement park where visitors can enjoy the 
wild west, and there are robots that you can talk to, have sex with, shoot, 
kill, beat up – anything. But unbeknown to the park’s creators, the robots are 
developing awareness and intelligence. There are shots of the robots with flies 
crawling over them; apparently they have a fly-wrangler on set, who freezes the 
flies and puts them on people’s faces, where they slowly start to thaw. It’s 
bizarre but looks incredible.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us>
, who is one of the great actors at the moment. It’s a coming-of-age story 
about being black and gay in America, which is a sensitive subject matter, and 
a guy coming to terms with his sexuality. With black masculinity, we’re taught 
to be macho and tough, but this looks at the soft, sensitive side of the black 
character that you rarely see.

 ‘The more people you lock up, the more money you make’: Ava DuVernay’s 
documentary 13th. Photograph: Netflix 
This is a shocking, hard-hitting Netflix documentary by Ava DuVernay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/08/13th-ava-duvernay-documentary-netflix>
, which looks at the incarceration of black American men. The 13th amendment to 
the US constitution abolished slavery and said all men were created equal, 
except criminals. What the system has worked out is that when people are locked 
up, you can put them to work, so the more people you lock up, the more money 
you make. There are private prisons springing up all over America, and they’re 
full of black men. In 1960, there were around 200,000 black men incarcerated 
each year; now it’s 3 million. It’s a kind of genocide – the removal of a 
generation of black men from American life.

It’s so rare we get time off the job, but the other day we went to this 
Mediterranean restaurant and had a nice night out. It has beautiful food and 
fresh, home-made pasta. I do like my red wines and had some really lovely 
Italian wine; rather too much, to tell the truth. The place feels rustic and 
the atmosphere is great. We were with some actors from other TV shows filming

sunshine: in the time I’ve been here, it’s rained every day.

 ‘Because I’ve been working so hard, I’m very much looking forward to it’: 
Gastown Float House. Photograph: Emanuele Pinna/Gastown Float House 
Later this week I’m going to this flotation experience: you get into a big 
tank of warm water with Epsom salts, and it’s very good for you. You float for 
about 90 minutes in the dark and you can’t hear a thing. It’s meant to be 
extremely relaxing, like meditating in water. It should be quite rejuvenating 
and because I’ve been working so hard, I’m very much looking forward to it.
