As I sat in the toilets at the Royal Festival Hall with terror clutching at my 
throat, trying to look over my prepared speech, I found myself hoping thatWolf 
Hall <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wolf-hall> wouldn’t win the 
Bafta and I would be spared the need to pontificate in front of my peers. Or 
that the best drama category would come well down the running order and other 
colleagues would say what needed to be said before I got to my feet, freeing me 
to utter the usual pleasurable platitudes – thanking my mother, the broom 
cupboard, the clement weather.

But no, we were the first award of the night and I had to be served up for the 
slaughter. And slaughter it has indeed been, at least from some quarters.

My criticism of the secretary of state for proposing to put government 
placemen and women on theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> executive 
board has provoked howls of anger from the zealous right.

I was part of an orchestrated attack, making lunatic assertions: a tearful “
leftie luvvie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-john-whittingdale-white-paper-star-pay-board>
” with appalling dress sense who had best leave it to the professionals and 
scurry back into his box.

But there’s something odd about this, isn’t there? The right is traditionally 
fiercely opposed to big government in all its manifestations, and yet that is 
from where the derision emanated. What’s going on?

Imagine one possible future. Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister and, with a 
compliant parliamentary Labour party behind him, attempts to insert six Labour 
nominees on to the body responsible for determining the editorial direction of 
the BBC.

I think we can imagine the response of her majesty’s opposition, of vast 
swaths of the press. Proof positive, they would cry, if proof were needed, that 
Corbyn’s instincts are the time-honoured instincts of the hard left – 
centralise, propagandise, Stalinise. That his idea of a beacon of freedom 
remains the defunct Soviet state.

Apoplectic Conservative MPs would point to the row between the BBC and 
Alastair Campbell last time Labour was in power, asking us if the issue would 
even have seen the light of day if Campbell had been able to instruct six board 
lackeys to undermine the editorial will of the national broadcaster from within.

But when I criticise a Conservative government for exactly the same power 
grab, the right of the party attacks with one voice – and a very personalised 
attack at that. It makes no sense.

Except it does. It’s not the policy, which is deeply unloved on the Tory back 
benches. It’s not the message, which even Stephen Glover of the Daily Mail 
grudgingly admits is reasonable. It’s the fact that it’s the BBC, of which they 
are preternaturally suspicious, and in particular it’s the messenger – or from 
where he’s assumed to hail.

But setting aside these petty tribal antipathies, isn’t it true – as evidenced 
by the reaction ofNorman Fowler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/02/the-bbc-needs-to-be-truly-independent>
 andChris Patten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/03/bbc-strictly-lord-patten-john-whittingdale>
 – that there is something scarily un-Tory about these proposals?

Isn’t the attempt to pack the board of a public service broadcaster exactly 
the kind of attack on free speech, exactly the kind of insidious encroachment 
of big and centralising government that the right has always wisely opposed 
when it hails from the left?

Isn’t it time to put aside the name-calling and sectarian abuse and call this 
out for what it is: a deeply authoritarian and undemocratic proposal?
