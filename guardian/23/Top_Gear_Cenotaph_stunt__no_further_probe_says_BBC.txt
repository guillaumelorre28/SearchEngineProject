The BBC Trust <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-trust> has ruled out 
further investigation of Top Gear’s controversial Cenotaph stunt after 
complaints that the BBC had attempted to “shrug off” people’s concerns with a 
“cut and paste” apology.


Chris Evans, who has since stepped down from his Top Gear role, apologised 
after co-hostMatt LeBlanc and rally driver Ken Block were filmed doing 
“doughnuts”

 close to the central London war memorial and said the footage would never be 
used.

The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> said at the time that the 
Cenotaph was never intended to feature in the programme and offered its 
“sincere apologies”.

The BBC later issued a further apology after two people complained that its 
initial response had been insufficient. “The BBC would never knowingly 
disrespect any war heroes,” it said.

“We hope you can accept our fulsome apologies and our further reassurances 
that we will be mindful of our filming locations henceforth.”

At least one person was still unhappy with the BBC’s response, but the trust 
said on Thursday that it would not take the appeal further on the basis that it 
had “no reasonable prospect of succeeding”.

The trust said the main points of complaint were operational and editorial 
matters that rested with the BBC and were not matters for the trust.

Evans announced he was stepping down from the programme last week after just 
one series in charge, saying he had given it his best shot but it wasn’t good 
enough.

BBC director general Tony Hall said this week he was looking forward to the 
second series

, with Evans’ former co-host Matt LeBlanc expected to be its lead presenter.

Despite its ratings woes and critical mauling in the UK, the BBC’s commercial 
arm, BBC Worldwide, said this week thatthe new show was even bigger

 than it was when it was fronted by Jeremy Clarkson.
