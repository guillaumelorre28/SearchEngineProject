The British Horseracing Authority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-horseracing-authority> is 
considering whether immediate action is required in the case of three jockeys 
accused of rape.

The men were arrested by Wiltshire Police on Friday and Saturday in connection 
with an alleged incident at a home in Chiseldon, Swindon, on Thursday night.

A statement from the force said detectives are investigating an allegation of 
rape by an 18-year-old woman and the men, aged between 20 and 21, had been 
bailed to return on a date in late December.

The BHA said its officials were “considering urgently what action is warranted 
in the interests of all parties concerned and in the context of the wider 
sport. In the meantime, and at least until we have obtained further details and 
been able to consider them, the jockeys concerned can continue to ride under 
our rules.”

The Professional Jockeys Association said it was “aware of today’s reports 
that a complaint of a very serious nature has been made to Wiltshire 
Constabulary regarding three PJA members and await the outcome of that 
investigation … We remind all our members to avoid speculation, comment or 
discussion of these allegations on social media and to respect the formal 
process that has commenced.”
