Batman has always been defined by his Batwear. Tim Burton ushered in a new era 
for Gotham’s dark knight by jettisoning the familiar colour scheme sported by 
Adam West in the much-loved 1960s show in favour of typically gothic black and 
an armored, musclebound look.George Clooney’s awful Batnipples 
<http://www.dorkly.com/post/60798/why-the-nipple-suits-in-batman-robin-were-actually-brilliant>
, intended as a paean to classical visions of the gods, came to define the 
floundering Joel Schumacher years. With Ben Affleck sporting a new goggled look 
in the upcomingJustice League

The camp tone of the 1966-68 show and its 1966 spin-off movie heavily inspired 
West’s outfit, featuring a short cape because the actor’s co-stars kept 
stepping on it in slapstick-inspired action scenes, and painted-on eyebrows 
(serving to give the dark knight an eternally surprised expression), presumably 
to avoid the expense of moulding the caped crusader’s brow-line into the famous 
cowl. To be fair to West and the show’s writers, it is hard to look menacing 
when you’re wearing your underpants over a pair of tights, so a comic approach 
was probably advisable. And at least Batman’s bargain bin gold utility belt 
always seemed to contain exactly the right weapon of choice to take down the 
relevant member of the caped crusader’s rogues’ gallery.

Five-foot-10, 160-pound Keaton might not have been the obvious choice to play 
Gotham’s terrifying defender in the Tim Burton films, but who needs endless 
trips to the gym and a diet of raw eggs and protein powder when moulded rubber 
muscles and a fearsomely beaky cowl can serve just as well? Nevertheless, with 
the new black Batsuit featuring a design based on unyielding foam rubber that 
extended to his skull, the actor was faced with a whole new set of problems. 
Legend has it that the caped crusader’s famous “hero turn” in 1989’s Batman and 
its 1991 sequel Batman Returns came about because Keaton simply had no 
alternative. The rigid suit meanthe was physically incapable of turning his head

Gorgeous George might be best known for ruining the dark knight for a 
generation with those superimposed nipples in 1997’s execrable Batman & Robin, 
but Kilmer had them first (if not quite so pronounced) in 1995’s almost equally 
hideousBatman Forever <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/>. 
Clooney definitely wins the prize for worst Batman suit of all time, however, 
in the shape of the silver and blue outfit worn by our hero and his Batpals in 
the denouement of Joel Schumacher’s much-maligned final turn in the director’s 
chair. This time there are not just nipples on show, but an enormous sculpted,
excruciatingly outlined Batcodpiece 
<https://www.yahoo.com/movies/nipple-regret-joel-schumacher-and-george-clooney-keep-99922446722.html>
. We should also mention that a different version of the suit features pop-out 
ice skates, essential for taking on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr Freeze, or 
simply terrifying small children at your local rink.

A welcome return to sanity arrived in the shape of Christopher Nolan’s 
tech-inspired Batsuits for the Dark Knight trilogy, supposedly based on a 
discontinued Wayne Enterprises design for an armored military bodysuit that 
Bruce Wayne initially just paints black and sticks a Batsymbol on in 2005’s 
Batman Begins. But the most sensible revolution, after close to two decades of 
caped crusaders who are unable to really turn their heads, came with 2008’sThe 
Dark Knight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/14/the-dark-knight-my-most-overrated-film-christopher-nolan>
. Apparently at the behest of Christian Bale, who found the costume 
uncomfortable, Morgan Freeman’s Lucius Fox simply develops a cowl that’s only 
loosely connected to the rest of the suit. Yes, it only took 19 years for 
Batman and his team to work out the importance of flexibility and actual 
peripheral vision when risking one’s life every night on the grim and bloody 
streets of Gotham.

If West’s fabric-based suit, which has often been retained for the comics, 
makes the actor look slightly pudgy when compared to the statuesque physicality 
of some of his successors, Affleckwas preposterously accused of being fat 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/14/ben-affleck-batman-fat-twitter_n_5321799.html>
 when he first pulled on his new Dark Knight Returns-inspired costume, 
supposedly made from a mix of kevlar and titanium but still with a cloth-like 
appearance, forBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2>. 

The truth is that a return to the woven look of Bill Finger-era Bats required 
the new dark knight to be in ridiculously impressive shape. A rather easier 
pitch was the movie’s mech-suit, inspired by the armor worn byBatman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/batman> for his battle with Superman in 
Frank Miller’s seminal 1986 graphic novel.

Batfleck’s new “tactical Batsuit” for Justice League

<https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/776125466113630208> 
And now here’s a third suit for Batfleck, which really is approaching Edna 
Mode levels of sartorial superhero extravagance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8>. This one will be rolled out for 
Snyder’s Justice League and reminds us of the begoggled look sported by Patrick 
Wilson’s Nite Owl in Snyder’s splendid 2009 superhero epic Watchmen. Rumour has 
it that it features additional metal plating to allow Batman to take more of a 
pounding from his enemies, which sounds like a good idea after one of those 
Gotham scumbags managed to plunge a knife straight through the dark knight’s 
costume and into his arm last time out.
