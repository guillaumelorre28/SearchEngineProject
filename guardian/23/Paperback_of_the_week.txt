Diaries: Into Politics 1972-1982
Alan Clark, edited by Ion Trewin
Phoenix Press Â£8.99, pp404 

Baldly listed, Alan Clark's qualities are not appealing. He was a snob, a 
racist, a womaniser who, even as his libido wandered, professed undying loyalty 
to his wife. He reviled his constituency in Plymouth and detested the general 
public.

Yet somehow he places himself beyond our dislike as he struggles against 
various frailties. These include vintage cars, 'cutie' women and backgammon. 
His intermittent hypochondria he inherited - along with bankable works of art 
and the family pile at Saltwood Castle in Kent - from his father Kenneth Clark. 
The first volume of the diaries covered the period 1983-92. In this posthumous 
edition we accompany Clark from his political initiation in Plymouth in 1972 to 
the point when the Falklands War saved Mrs Thatcher and at last gave Clark the 
prospect of office.

The first five years are full of anxiety, depression and self-loathing. He 
takes ill to Plymouth, neglecting his constituency duties and facing 
deselection threats. He fights off bankruptcy and finds sexual adventure with a 
'coven' of women, and later, with the assistance of Jonathan Aitken, buys off 
another woman who tries to blackmail him.

Then the tone shifts. Clark becomes addicted to Westminster. He begins to 
covet office. He courts Mrs Thatcher by cultivating her fixer, Ian Gow. But he 
loathes Willie Whitelaw and loses no opportunity to sneer at Michael Heseltine. 
If the first volume was a classic study, this is scarcely less valuable as an 
insight into the lower pond life of the parliamentary system where greed, 
hopeless ambition, self-delusion and bitter disillusion lurk. Clark's saving 
grace was that he recognised all these failings in himself.
