Does the European commission’s demand that Apple pay a record-breaking £11bn 
in back taxes to Ireland reflect well on theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>?

Does it justify the British people having opted for Brexit because of the EU’s 
high-handedness? Or does it suggest that Britain has decided to quit the EU at 
the very moment it has shown its teeth by bringing a giant corporation to heel?

Although national newspapers had different answers to those questions, they 
did appear united in their belief thatApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> itself was in the wrong. 
Struggling old media was delighted with the opportunity to sink its teeth into 
digital media.

The Times thundered 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/one-bad-apple-9zzhgf902>: “Apple’s 
founder, the late Steve Jobs, once said that individuals are basically ‘noble 
and honourable’. The same cannot be said of Apple’s tax arrangements.”

Both the Sun and the Daily Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror> believed the deal between 
Apple and the Irish state was “rotten to the core.”

The Sun <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> thought it “about time Apple 
was hit with a monster tax bill” because . “they and other web giants have got 
away with murder when it comes to paying their dues.”


In the Daily Mail, its business commentator, Alex Brummer, remarked on the 
“corporate arrogance, tax avoidance and cultish secrecy of Apple” 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3766103/Why-aren-t-tough-tax-dodging-firms-ALEX-BRUMMER-believes-EU-s-robust-approach-tackling-tax-avoidance-behold.html>
 and derided governments for giving “Apple and other digital giants a free pass 
to trample over the tax codes of countries where it makes hundreds of millions 
in profits.”

The Independent <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent> scorned 
“the behemoths of technology” - the Apples, Amazons and Googles - for depriving 
governments of hundreds of billions in tax revenues.

But there was no such unity about the EU. The pro-remain Mirror viewed the tax 
ruling as“a huge prize for the European Union.” 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/voice-mirror-apples-sweetheart-tax-8738085>
 It said: “We congratulate the European commission for fining the bad Apple but 
there are more companies spoiling this particular barrel.”

No so the Brexit-supporting Telegraph. It viewed the commission’s decision as 
an interference in the free market, an example ofthe EU failing to demonstrate 
a “commitment to economic openness.” 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/08/30/the-eu-is-showing-its-true-colours-high-tax-anti-trade-and-not-f/>
 It continued:

“The European commission’s dealings with Apple and Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> are a textbook example of what is 
wrong with the EU, both economically and politically.

Economically, a punitive approach to the taxation of highly mobile 
international corporations is an act of self-harm: such firms can and will 
relocate to countries that do not seek to milk them for every penny of tax they 
can.

Politically, it is an affront to democracy that the unelected commission in 
Brussels should presume to dictate to Ireland’s government what taxes it should 
levy.”

The Telegraph sees Brexit as a chance to do as Ireland has done by striking 
deals with corporations and other non-EU economies.

A news story in the fanatically pro-leave Daily Express, headlined “Apple’s 
£11bn tax levy ‘will benefit UK after Brexit’” 
<http://www.pressreader.com/uk/daily-express/20160831/281522225519021>, quoted 
“experts” who claimed that an EU-free Britain could attract companies bu 
forging tax deals, “unfettered by Brussels anti-trust rulings.”

The Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes>, which came out in 
favour of remain ahead of the EU referendum, was scathing about Apple’s tax 
deal with the Irish authorities. It must pay what it owes, said the paper, and 
“Ireland must tighten its rules.”


It had little time for the argument that Apple created jobs in lieu of paying 
tax. Elected governments should worry about jobs, not “technology executives”.

Conceding that “it will always be difficult to devise a system without 
loopholes”, the Times urged developed countries to co-operate and companies to 
“play fair” so that governments can “take more of what they are owed.’

Brummer’s commentary in the Brexit-supporting Mail was interesting because he 
praised the EU for its “most significant drive... to make multinational 
companies engaged in complex tax avoidance play fair.” He wrote:

“All this is surprising because generally the EU is a sclerotic and 
slow-moving organisation. But now the arm that deals with corporate competition 
has showed itself to have real teeth...

The take-no-prisoners intervention of the EU also offers a great contrast to 
the softly, softly approach of former chancellor George Osborne and Her 
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in their efforts to make Google, Amazon, 
Starbucks and others pay their fair share of taxes.”

He thought Apple had previously benefitted from a “soft ride” in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> but regarded “this economic 
howitzer launched at Apple” as “a huge step towards a fairer global tax system.”

In essence, the Mail’s Brummer was in unusual accord with the Guardian. Its 
editorial, “Apple, pay your way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-ireland-apple-pay-your-way>
”, also saw the EU decision as a positive step.

Unlike the Telegraph, it argued that Apple’s tax avoidance “offers the voters 
of Brexit Britain a grim warning of the ever more dysfunctional capitalism 
being urged on their government by the free-market fundamentalists around the 
cabinet table and the lobbyists for investment banks and big business.”

After examining Apple’s global activities, it pointed to the company’s 
creation of a “paper” head office in Ireland where “profits allocated to it 
went untaxed” and called it “a version of globalisation taken to its deformed, 
absurd limit.”

As for Apple’s plea about providing jobs in Ireland, the Guardian remarked: 

“When Apple said yesterday that next to no research work was carried out in 
its European headquarters of Cork, it was both preparing for a legal appeal and 
giving the game away about the quality of jobs it has actually created in 
Ireland.”

And it concluded: “The lessons here for Brexit Britain are unignorable. For a 
long time, the City of London has functioned as a tax haven... As she maps out 
the UK’s future outside the EU at Chequers today, Theresa May is under ever 
more pressure to go further down that route - to turn all of Britain into some 
lighttouch special enterprise zone, with favours for industries making 
extravagant promises.

“The lesson of Apple in Ireland is that such promises are never as good as 
they seem.”

The Independent was also worried by “huge and powerful corporations” that 
“overwhelm small and feeble nation states” 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/imperial-powers-were-the-ones-who-once-divided-and-ruled-now-its-corporations-like-apple-a7216876.html>
 in an environment where “‘intellectual rights’” can be relocated on a keyboard 
stroke.”

It said: “Such was all too obviously the case with Ireland, virtually 
bankrupted by the global financial crisis - and Apple, the world’s richest 
company by some measures.”


So “thanks to the European commission, which receives little gratitude 
whatever it does, Europe’s citizens have discovered the full scale of this 
abuse.”

It contended that “the EU, by dint of its sheer size as marketplace, has the 
stature to stand up to the likes of Apple” and continued:

“It is painful to think what position HM Treasury will be in in these sorts of 
scraps, post-Brexit. It could follow the Irish example and leave these 
enterprises virtually untaxed in return for locating jobs in Britain; in which 
case our European neighbours would be entitled to object to unfair ‘tax 
competition’ on such a scale.

They might well retaliate by restricting access to the single market still 
further. We would all be the losers then, except of course for global 
corporations like Apple, which would find no difficulty in exploiting these 
arguments to their best advantage.”

The Irish Times saw it somewhat differently 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/the-irish-times-view-a-damning-verdict-in-apple-case-leaves-government-with-little-option-but-to-appeal-1.2773307>
: “Ireland has always presented itself as having a tax system with a clear 
legal underpinning, offering certainty to companies.

“Rightly or wrongly the judgment casts doubt over the way we taxed at least 
one major corporation – and this carries with it reputational damage for 
Ireland.” It said:

“The damning verdict by the commission on how tax was applied in the Apple 
case leaves the [Irish] government with little option but to lodge an appeal, 
given the central importance of foreign direct investment to our economy...

The Irish side is insistent that the commission has erred legally, as is 
Apple. Ireland will also claim an infringement on our tax sovereignty.”

But, like UK newspapers, it understood that “big US companies have used the 
interplay of European and US tax laws to pay very little tax on profits earned 
in European markets... There is no doubt that this needs to change and that the 
amounts paid by many of these companies has been indefensibly low.”

I applaud the Irish Times’s columnist, Fintan O’Toole, for arguing that 
Ireland should take the money 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/we-should-collect-apple-s-13-billion-and-change-ireland-1.2773136>
 and then use it “properly and rigorously” in order to make “an epoch-making, 
transformational intervention” for the good of the Irish people.
