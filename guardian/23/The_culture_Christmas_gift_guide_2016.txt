A quirky book examining a killer in the Victorian home: the glorious 
wallpapers that were created using a toxic compound of arsenic and verdigris. 
The book’s title was a phrase coined by William Morris, owner of a highly 
profitable arsenic mine, who used it to poo-poo fears that people were being 
poisoned in their own homes. Lucinda Hawksley tells the story in chapters 
interleaved with fabulous designs. £28
