I was completely gobsmacked by Madagascar when I first arrived in 2006, as 
part of a televised tour around the Tropic of Capricorn. It’s like nowhere else 
on Earth. The only place I can compare it to is the Galápagos Islands, but on a 
much bigger scale; it’s the fourth biggest island in the world.

 Simon Reeve … mad about Madagascar 
Everywhere you look in Antananarivo, or Tana, as it’s known, there is 
something surprising and different. It’s like a crazy mix of France, Nepal, 
Vietnam, Lima … There is an extraordinary mix of architecture: French 
colonialism and clay huts; old Renault 4s and rickshaws; paddy fields inside 
the city itself. I love that collision of cultures.

 ‘Crazy mix’ … the capital, Antananarivo. Photograph: Alamy 
The train from Fianarantsoa to Manakara, a 101-mile trip to the coast, is the 
maddest journey I’ve ever been on. The track was built in colonial times and 
thousands of workers died during its construction; it was a wicked project. But 
now it helps Malagasy farmers in the hinterland shift out their crops of coffee 
and fruit. When the railway doesn’t run, the farmers are forced to slash and 
burn the land to grow rice. So the trains are now vital for conservation. The 
route has dozens of tunnels, viaducts, valleys, bridges and steep inclines. 
It’s totally chaotic – health and safety doesn’t exist: we stood on the 
cowcatcher on the front of the train. There are no proper lights, the toilets 
leak and it takes 12 hours, but it was magical.

 ‘Maddest journey’ … the train from Fianarantsoa to Manakara. Photograph: Alamy 
Go to Ilakaka – but only during the day. It is a pretty lawless, wild west 
kind of town. Pink sapphires were discovered there in the late 1990s and there 
was a gem rush. It’s an extraordinary sight: a wooden town has sprung up with 
filthy miners wandering about, chubby lawmen in bars, gem sellers and buyers, 
prostitutes … You need to be pretty tough to go there.

Madagascar has been cut off from the rest of the world for so long (it split 
from the Indian peninsula about 88 million years ago) that life has evolved in 
specific and unique ways. It is one of the most biologically diverse countries 
in the world; about 90% of the flora and fauna are endemic.

We’d search the forest for lemurs, only to return to our lodge and find them 
playing there.Berenty, a wildlife reserve in the south, is home to the island’s 
famous ringtailed and sifaka lemurs. When humans first settled on the island, 
they found lemurs the size of gorillas, and also elephant birds and jumping 
rats.

Madagascan forests are an extraordinary mix of thorn trees, octopus trees and 
incredible baobab trees. Some baobabs have caves carved into them for cattle 
herders to stay in. There is a legend that the tree looked so haughty, God 
turned it the wrong way up. There are several clear ecosystems across the 
island: dry savana, plateau, spiny desert, rainforest and grassland.

 The ring-tailed lemur – the creature most associated with Madagascar.

Blue Ventures <https://blueventures.org/volunteer/madagascar/> is a 
conservation group in the south-west, which was founded by a young Brit. 
Volunteers can stay there and work with the locals to save the environment; 
you’re really embedded in a community. The Blue Ventures’ Captain Condom boat 
goes up and down the coast, helping people with family planning. I met the 
Vezo, a coastal people, when we went to a crazy little island.

The most memorable dish I ate was zebu penis soup (zebu are horned cattle). It 
was in a filthy cafe – more of a shack – near a market in Tana. The penis was 
massive, a metre long, and it looked revolting, served as pieces of gristly 
willy in a pretty rancid soup – not exactly fine cuisine. But I always 
encourage people to eat crazy food; weird insect dishes are on the menu in 
Madagascar, too.

There is a culture of taboos in Madagascar called fady. Centuries of isolation 
have allowed the human imagination to run wild. In some parts, you can’t wear 
red on a Thursday, or pass an egg from hand to hand. Twins are considered evil 
and are often left out in the forest. When someone dies, the dead body is left 
on matting. The juices seep out into a sipping cup that is passed around the 
relatives. It is the only thing I’ve ever refused to drink.
