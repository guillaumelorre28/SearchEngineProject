Rose caused consternation when he failed to show up for Monday night’s game 
against the Pelicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/09/derrick-rose-missing-new-york-knicks-awol>
 at Madison Square Garden. Several team-mates and officials said they were 
unsure of Rose’s whereabouts, and the Knicks were so concerned for the player’s 
safety that they sent someone to check on him at his apartment, sources said.

Without their star guard, the Knicks lost 110-96 
<http://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400899989> – their eighth loss in nine 
games.

On Tuesday, Rose attempted to clear matters up, and confirmed he left New York 
on Monday to fly to Chicago to be with his mother. “It was personal. I put it 
on myself for not telling the Knicks,” he said. “I am not perfect. I apologized 
to the team.”

Rose, 28, said he made contact with Knicks officials late on Monday. He said 
he didn’t pick up when the Knicks called him before the game because he needed 
“space to process what was happening with my family” – but he didn’t go into 
further details.

The Knicks confirmed Rose arrived back in New York on Tuesday morning. The 
team tweeted: “Derrick Rose has rejoined the team and has been fined. He is 
expected to be in uniform tomorrow in Philadelphia.”The team also tweeted a 
photo of practice

Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said he was “satisfied” with his player’s reason 
for leaving – but said Rose should have contacted the team earlier. The Knicks 
coach said he received a text from Rose after the game to let him know he was 
OK.

Rose has averaged 17.3 points, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds in 33 games for 
the Knicks, but was unhappy at being benched in the fourth quarter in recent 
games against Milwaukee and Indiana. But sources said it was wrong to connect 
Rose’s frustration with his absence on Monday.
