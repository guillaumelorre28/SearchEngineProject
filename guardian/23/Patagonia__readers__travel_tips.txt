Winning tip: DIY Torres del Paine

You don’t need to go on an organised tour through the Torres del Paine 
national park, as it’s really easy to do it by yourself. The town of Puerto 
Natales caters for trekkers, and the Erratic Rock hostel runs daily seminars 
telling you everything you need to know about trekking in the park. It’s also a 
great way to meet up with other trekkers if you’re on your own.
Dorms $22, seminars free, erraticrock.com <http://www.erraticrock.com/hostel/>

To appreciate the vastness, variety and beauty of Patagonia, fly into Osorno, 
Chile, rent a four-wheel drive vehicle or off-road motorbike, and crisscross 
southbound between Chile and Argentina. Two weeks’ drive takes you to Punta 
Arenas to fly home. En route, experience the splendour of the Carretera Austral 
in Chile and the starkly beautiful Ruta 40 in Argentina. Both roads are a 
mixture of metalled and gravel surfaces. Stop off at the magnificent Perito 
Moreno glacier and visit the stunning Torres del Paine national park. Stay in 
hotels or on workingestancias, meeting the friendly local people and enjoying 
their rustic cuisine. I went on a motorbike trip organised by BMW Motorrad 
Tours.

White water rafting

“Float feet first” are the guide’s instructions as we dive off the raft and 
into the glacial melt of the Manso river. The water is bottle green, so clear 
you can see the bottom, and the air is pure. After an exhilarating five 
minutes, we climbed back onto the raft for another two hours of excitement. At 
the Chilean border we were met by the tour company, who drove us back to camp, 
where a welcomeasado (barbecue) was waiting.

Lake Caminante, Tierra del Fuego

An energetic six-hour trek to get there. A seven-hour assault course scramble 
to get down – snow, mud, tree trunks, shale and boulders. Unzipping my tent 
door to this view was worth every blister and shiver.

La Tablita restaurant, El Calafate 


Go to eat huge plates of meat at this buzzing, family parrilla. Book ahead or 
be prepared to queue while being tormented by the smell of roasting meats on 
the flaming grills. Best enjoyed after a day at Perito Moreno glacier, or the
Laguna Nimez bird reserve 
<http://www.patagonia.com.ar/El+Calafate/835E_Municipal+Ecological+Reserve+.html>
, on the edge of town and with wonderful views over Lago Argentino.

An experience I can only describe as a privilege; it’s the intensely moving, 
raw impact of that first sight of the glacier. The silence and immensity of the 
expanse of white against a bright blue sky was punctuated by distant rumbles 
and haunting echoes of crashing ice. I recommend Viator Tours, who will pick up 
and drop off from hotels in El Calafate. Fares include entrance to the Los 
Glaciares national park and a boat trip taking you close to the edge, where 
millions of years of ice drop from the glacier to drift away. After several 
busy days’ trekking, time stood still while I watched something reminiscent of 
creation.

Exploring Welsh connections, Gaiman


Plas y Coed is famous for being the oldest Welsh teahouse in the town of 
Gaiman. It is run by Ana Rees, whose love for Wales and Welsh culture led to 
her achieving a degree in the subject. Chatting over Welsh cakes and “torta 
galesa” about her family’s experiences – and the way in which the language and 
culture almost died out, but is now reviving – was fascinating, and, frankly, 
made the holiday.

A Unesco world heritage site, this is the most amazing place, lost in the 
Patagonian steppe. We were taken by private car along a rough stone track for 
two and a half hours, amid bleak scenery, before we descended into a great 
cavernous valley; here you’ll find hand paintings under the cliff face, said to 
date back 9,000-13,000 years. It is the most breathtaking experience. There are 
not many tourists, so you find yourself alone, with a great sense of peace and 
humility, looking at the paintings showing animals drinking at the river – and 
then look to the same spot below, where the water used to run.

Whale watching, Puerto Madryn

For whale watching trips from June to December, head to Puerto Madryn, where 
the warmer waters of the Golfo San José attract more species. The boat trips 
led by friendly native fishermen start from just £10. They last two hours, with 
barbecued, freshly caught fish, and the guarantee of your money back if you 
don’t see any whales: a win-win deal.

Forget the John Lewis advert, at Punta Tombo you can actually walk among 
Magellanic penguins – or rather, they walk among you – and you can see (and 
smell!) them up close and personal. Absolute heaven. There are also some 
further south around Ushuaia, the southernmost town in the world, where among 
other attractions you can try several delicious craft beers.
