I have grown a tree echium 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/6295/Echium-pininana/Details> (Echium pininana) 
from seed and it now stands proudly in my front garden at over 4m high. It has 
become the talking point of our street. Last winter I protected it from frosts 
but it has since doubled in height. What can I do this winter? An offshoot has 
appeared about 50cm from the base of the plant. I feel the weight of 
expectation from my neighbours to keep the plant going into next year.
The tree echium is a biennial or short-lived perennial, so once it flowers, it 
dies. Flowering usually occurs in the second year, so it should have set seed; 
often if it likes its space (and it sounds as if yours does). It will readily 
self-seed, but it makes sense to collect some seed to sow indoors from February 
to May. If you want to remain the talking point, you will have to resow the 
plant every year to keep a continuous supply of flowers.

If it hasn’t flowered (and sometimes they don’t), it may remain vegetative for 
another year and you will have to erect some sort of scaffolding to keep it 
warm this winter. Horticultural fleece held up with a structure of bamboo canes 
is probably your best bet.
