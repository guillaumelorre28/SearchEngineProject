That is according to the NSPCC’s Childline <https://www.childline.org.uk/> 
service, which handled 11,706 counselling sessions for anxiety over the past 
year, a 35% increase on 2014-15. In the last six months it dealt with 6,500 
contacts where anxiety was cited the main issue and research showed a growing 
number of children and young people were concerned about world affairs.

It’s thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political 
issues, while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing 
events seen in the media and on social media.

Childline’s president, Esther Rantzen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/esther-rantzen>, said: “Seeing 
pictures of crying and bewildered toddlers being pulled from bomb-damaged homes 
upsets all of us. Often we fail to notice the impact these stories are having 
on young people.”


Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, said: “The world can be a 
worrying place but we need to ensure our children are reassured rather than 
left overwhelmed and frightened.


Has your child or student expressed concern about global issues? What do they 
worry about? Do you limit their access to the internet as a result? How do you 
respond to their worries? We want to hear from parents and teachers on this 
topic.
