Chi-Raq
The debut offering from Amazon’s big-screen arm gets its cinematic release 
this week.Spike Lee’s latest relocates the classical Greek play Lysistrata to 
modern-day Chicago, for a satire with a timely message 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece>
. When a child is accidentally shot dead, the title character, played by Mad 
Men’s Teyonah Parris, organises the women of the city’s South Side to pressure 
the men into putting an end to their violence by withholding sex. Big, bold and 
controversial, Chi-Raq tackles gun crime in the age of Black Lives Matter 
through sideways means, and boasts a starry cast including Samuel L Jackson and 
Jennifer Hudson.
On general release from Friday 9 Dec

Ricky Gervais 
In some ways, Ricky Gervais <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-gervais>
’s career trajectory has been textbook: the critical acclaim; the cracking of 
the US; the slide into deeply unsettling levels of self-indulgence. Yet he’s 
also seemed like a comedy outsider at times, at least in part thanks to his 
apparently graftless sideways move into standup comedy stardom post-Office. So 
it will be intriguing to see a potentially rusty Gervais return to the live 
stage after six years, warming up for his new tour Humanity. First announced in 
2012 and finally set to materialise in full next year, tickets for the show 
proper are available now.
At Royal Theatre, Bath on Sunday 4 Dec

 Anthony Hopkins as Dr Robert Ford in Westworld. 
Triumphantly picking up the water cooler-chat baton from Game Of Thrones, 
HBO’s handsome and pensive thriller has gradually unfurled a labyrinthine plot 
over nine masterful episodes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>. Now for the finale, and 
there are plenty of threads to pick up, not least whether Maeve can finally 
raise her army of cowpoke simulacrums, take revenge on her creators and escape 
the park.
