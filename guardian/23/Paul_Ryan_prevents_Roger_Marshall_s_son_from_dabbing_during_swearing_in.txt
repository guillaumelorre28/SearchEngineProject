 by dabbing during a photo call at his swearing in.

Paul Ryan <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/paul-ryan> believed Cal 
Marshall, the 17-year-old son of Roger Marshall, was about to sneeze when he 
moved his face down to his forearm while he and his family posed for 
photographs at Tuesday’s swearing in.

He was in fact dabbing: a viral dance move popularised by US athletes and 
rappers, and embraced by teenagers as an irreverent or celebratory gesture.


Video footage shows Cal Marshall determinedly doing the dab despite Ryan’s 
attempts to dissuade him.


“You all right?” he asks of the teenager.

“I’m all right,” Marshall replies into the crook of his elbow, mid-dab.

“Do you want – can you put your hand down?” persists Ryan.

When Marshall eventually concedes, Ryan asks: “Were you going to sneeze? Is 
that it?”

“Yeah,” says Marshall.

“He’s sneezing!” his father tells the photographers.

Congressman Roger Marshall later told Ryan over Twitter that 
<https://twitter.com/RogerMarshallMD/status/816402331143118848> Cal was 
grounded.

Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) 
Just so you know @SpeakerRyan <https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan>: He's grounded.

But Ryan seemed more bemused than offended.

“Just finished swearing-in photos,” he later tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/816422778614194176>. “Nearly 300 
members. Countless cute kids.

“Still don’t get what dabbing is, though.”

Ryan’s misapprehension was understandable, given the dab does resemble a 
polite attempt to muffle a loud sneeze.

In December, a viral image of unknown origin 
<https://twitter.com/GPSofficial/status/806004565250162688> showed the dab 
appropriated as a public health message not to spread germs: the acronym 
“Destroy All Bacteria”.

The move is believed to have originated in the hip-hop scene of Atlanta, 
Georgia, as long ago as 2013, but reached a tipping point in late 2015 after 
featuring in a number of viral videos online.

After being popularised as a celebratory gesture by US sports players, most 
notably the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, and took on a new life on 
social media.

Hillary Clinton did the dab on Ellen in January 2016 
<https://youtu.be/WkNL_cfVyWU>, around the same time Jesse Lingard brought the 
dab to Britain when he marked his goal in Manchester United’s 3-3 draw against 
Newcastle.

In the chronology of viral dance moves, it succeeded the Whip and the Nae Nae 
(both demonstrated by Clinton on Ellen) and was followed byJuju on that Beat
