Jacqueline Durran has won the Oscar for best costume design for Anna Karenina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anna-karenina> at the 85th Academy Awards in 
LA.

Anna Karenina, adapted from the Tolstoy novel and starring Keira Knightley, 
proved a hit with the voters for its elaborate period costumes and lush 
visuals, enabling Durran to carry off the Bafta in the same category earlier 
this month.

Durran has been nominated three times before – in 2006 for Pride & Prejudice 
and 2008 for Atonement, both directed by Anna Karenina's Joe Wright – but this 
is her first success.
