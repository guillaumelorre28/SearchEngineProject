, a new adaptation of the Agatha Christie short story on which Billy Wilder’s 
six-time Oscar-nominated 1957 thriller was based.

Affleck will presumably play the central character, a lawyer who is called to 
defend a man accused of the murder of a wealthy older woman, who bequeathed him 
her wealth without realising he was already married. In Wilder’s version, the 
lawyer was played by Charles Laughton, while Tyrone Power was the defendant and 
Marlene Dietrich played the suspect’s wife.

It will be Affleck’s first directing gig since Argo, which won the 2013 Oscar 
for best picture
