Controversial sports scientist Stephen Dank will contest the guilty findings 
and resultant AFL life ban imposed by the league’s anti-doping tribunal for his 
role in the controversialEssendon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> 
supplements scandal.


Dank informed AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> general counsel 
Andrew Dillon on Monday morning of his decision to contest the findings. The 
appeal is set to be heard by the AFL’s appeal board, chaired by Peter 
O’Callaghan QC, in August.

Dank’s decision to appeal has the potential to delay the World Anti-Doping 
Agency’s proposed re-hearing of the case against 34 past and present Essendon 
players at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.


Earlier this year, the Essendon players were cleared of taking banned peptide 
Thymosin Beta-4 by the AFL tribunal, a finding being appealed against by WADA.


The anti-doping tribunal had found Dank guilty of 10 anti-doping infringements 
which occurred during his time at Essendon and Gold Coast, but he was cleared 
of 24 other alleged infringements.


The life ban – which was welcomed by both the AFL and Asada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada> – effectively meant Dank would not be 
able to work again in any sport that was a signatory to the Wada code.


After Dank received the life ban last month he vowed to take legal action 
against the AFL.

“We will now accelerate our legal action against the AFL and individual 
members of its executive who are responsible for this decision being handed 
down,” Dank said at the time.

“They have contaminated the truth and impaired natural justice, and now they 
will feel the full thrust of the law in relation to how they’ve handled this 
process.”
