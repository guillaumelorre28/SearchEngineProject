European shares climb as US markets hit new peaks

Taking their cue from overnight records set on Wall Street, and boosted by 
further gains as US markets opened higher once more, European investors pushed 
shares higher once more. Despite dips in the oil price on renewed doubts about 
Opec agreeing output cuts next week, the prospect of a Trump boost to spending 
continued to support markets.

In Europe, French and German markets were lifted once again by recent 
political developments - Francois Fillon’s victory in the French presidential 
primary and Angela Merkel standing for a fourth term as German chancellor.

As for the UK, the pound weakened ahead of Wednesday’s Autumn Statement, but 
shares simply shrugged this off. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at 
IG,said:

Ahead of tomorrow’s Autumn Statement sterling remains weak, dropping back from 
yesterday’s highs above $1.25. It is clear that the chancellor faces a 
difficult set of choices, with little wiggle room. Given the still murky path 
ahead for the UK economy, it is hard to see how Mr Hammond can do more than 
tinker around the edges. Markets will be watching closely for signs of concern 
about the economic outlook, which could see the pound weaken further against 
the dollar and the euro.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 41.76 points or 0.62% at 6819.72 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.27% to 10,713.85 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4548.35 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was 1.37% better at 16,519.89 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.43% at 8651.5 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.5% to 631.21 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 
18980, having earlier surged past 19,000 to 19014.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Despite the better than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures, there 
is a chance the mood may not last, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank:

Eurozone consumers have good reason to cheer in November. The oil price fell 
sharply at the start of the month and Eurozone stock prices have gained on the 
Trump victory.

The unemployment rate has been flat over the summer months, but the employment 
outlook has been improving recently as companies are indicating to be hiring at 
a faster pace in both services and industry. This seems to have humoured the 
Eurozone consumer, who had been cautious through the summer months awaiting a 
negative Brexit response that has turned out to be mild so far.

The question is whether this momentum can continue to build in the coming 
months though. While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be 
maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth. 
As inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming months, real wages 
will probably take a hit before nominal wage growth edges up again.

And after a mild response to Brexit and the Trump election, will the Eurozone 
consumer respond more negatively to political uncertainty within the Eurozone? 
As a ‘no’ in the Italian referendum is ahead in the polls for the moment, it 
could well be that we will soon find out.

The improved eurozone consumer confidence figures bode well for future growth 
in the region, says Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG 
Markit:

An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose 
for a third month running in November - and markedly - to reach an 11-month 
high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared 
to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone hare currently benefiting 
from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment 
and still very low inflation.

This buoys hopes that the Eurozone is on course for improved GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter after expansion was limited to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both 
the third and second quarters. We currently expect fourth-quarter GDP growth of 
0.4% quarter-on-quarter and believe that 0.5% expansion is a genuine 
possibility. However, we have significant concerns over the Eurozone growth 
outlook for 2017 amid an uncertain political outlook.

While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the 
marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in November was due to improved 
perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job 
concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly 
true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November 
surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped 
at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of 
faltering.

Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence – particularly a marked 
increase – is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone 
growth prospects.

Eurozone consumer confidence beats forecasts

Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in 
November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit.

The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, 
better than the forecast -7.8 points.

In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8. 
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:

EU consumer confidence hasn’t been in positive territory for nearly two 
decades so today’s negative reading is no surprise, but [ECB president] Mario 
Draghi will be pleased to see the above expectations data is at least moving in 
the right direction.

Draghi deserves credit for maintaining a relatively stable eurozone economy at 
one of the most uncertain geopolitical times in memory.

With the cloud of Brexit hanging over the future direction of the eurozone, in 
addition to volatile elections and referendums on the horizon that could add 
further uncertainty, holding firm is likely just what the doctor ordered.

Maybe it will be louder at NYSE if/when Dow tops 20K. Some cheers just after 
Dow hit a new record. But nothing crazy. Now it's quiet again.

Wall Street hits new highs as Dow reaches 19,000

The surge in US markets - based on the recent strength of the oil price and 
hopes that Donald Trumps infrastructure plans will boost the economy - is 
continuing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has breached 19,000 for the first time, 
touching 19007, before slipping back to 18,991, up 0.18%.

Both the Nasdaq Composite - up 0.37% - and the S&P 500 - 0.23% better - opened 
at new peaks.

Oil slips back on new Opec deal doubts

The oil price has been rising in recent days on growing expectation that Opec 
might agree to limit output at its meeting next week, following an outline plan 
drawn up in Algiers in September.

But as is always the case, it does not take much to dent the mood. Reuters is 
reporting that Iran, Iraq and Indonesia have doubts about the proposed output 
cut.

So Brent crude, previously as high as $49.96m a barrel today is now down 0.59% 
at $48.61. And West Texas Intermediate is now down 0.56% at $47.97.

A quick recap of the main points

1) Britain is on track to blow past its budget forecasts for this year, 
despite cutting its borrowing in October by 25% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/22/uk-public-finances-economic-healthcheck-autumn-statement-business-live?page=with:block-58340fffe4b0da4920d6b069#block-58340fffe4b0da4920d6b069>
.


The UK has now borrowed £48.6bn since April 2016, down from £54.2bn a year 
ago, but already close to the £55bn target for this current financial year (to 
March 2017).

Economists believe it could overshoot the target by £10bn or more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/22/uk-public-finances-economic-healthcheck-autumn-statement-business-live?page=with:block-58342312e4b0da4920d6b0b6#block-58342312e4b0da4920d6b0b6>
, underlining the weak state of the public finances.

The better news is that October’s deficit fell to £4.8bn, from £6.4bn a year 
ago, thanks to a rise in corporation tax receipts.

2) UK families are more pessimistic about the long-term impact of leaving the 
EU.

 A new survey showed that confidence fell across all ages and income groups in 
the last three months.

3) British factories have reported a pick-up in orders, after a summer 
slowdown.

However, many are also planning to hike prices to cover the slump in the pound.

according to Credit Suisse’s regular report:

Taking their cue from overnight records set on Wall Street, and boosted by 
further gains as US markets opened higher once more, European investors pushed 
shares higher once more. Despite dips in the oil price on renewed doubts about 
Opec agreeing output cuts next week, the prospect of a Trump boost to spending 
continued to support markets.

In Europe, French and German markets were lifted once again by recent 
political developments - Francois Fillon’s victory in the French presidential 
primary and Angela Merkel standing for a fourth term as German chancellor.

As for the UK, the pound weakened ahead of Wednesday’s Autumn Statement, but 
shares simply shrugged this off. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at 
IG,said:

Ahead of tomorrow’s Autumn Statement sterling remains weak, dropping back from 
yesterday’s highs above $1.25. It is clear that the chancellor faces a 
difficult set of choices, with little wiggle room. Given the still murky path 
ahead for the UK economy, it is hard to see how Mr Hammond can do more than 
tinker around the edges. Markets will be watching closely for signs of concern 
about the economic outlook, which could see the pound weaken further against 
the dollar and the euro.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 41.76 points or 0.62% at 6819.72 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.27% to 10,713.85 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4548.35 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was 1.37% better at 16,519.89 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.43% at 8651.5 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.5% to 631.21 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 
18980, having earlier surged past 19,000 to 19014.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Here’s an interesting chart showing the moves in various commodities following

Despite the better than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures, there 
is a chance the mood may not last, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank:

Eurozone consumers have good reason to cheer in November. The oil price fell 
sharply at the start of the month and Eurozone stock prices have gained on the 
Trump victory.

The unemployment rate has been flat over the summer months, but the employment 
outlook has been improving recently as companies are indicating to be hiring at 
a faster pace in both services and industry. This seems to have humoured the 
Eurozone consumer, who had been cautious through the summer months awaiting a 
negative Brexit response that has turned out to be mild so far.

The question is whether this momentum can continue to build in the coming 
months though. While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be 
maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth. 
As inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming months, real wages 
will probably take a hit before nominal wage growth edges up again.

And after a mild response to Brexit and the Trump election, will the Eurozone 
consumer respond more negatively to political uncertainty within the Eurozone? 
As a ‘no’ in the Italian referendum is ahead in the polls for the moment, it 
could well be that we will soon find out.
 
The improved eurozone consumer confidence figures bode well for future growth 
in the region, says Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG 
Markit:

An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose 
for a third month running in November - and markedly - to reach an 11-month 
high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared 
to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone hare currently benefiting 
from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment 
and still very low inflation.

This buoys hopes that the Eurozone is on course for improved GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter after expansion was limited to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both 
the third and second quarters. We currently expect fourth-quarter GDP growth of 
0.4% quarter-on-quarter and believe that 0.5% expansion is a genuine 
possibility. However, we have significant concerns over the Eurozone growth 
outlook for 2017 amid an uncertain political outlook.

While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the 
marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in November was due to improved 
perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job 
concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly 
true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November 
surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped 
at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of 
faltering.

Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence – particularly a marked 
increase – is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone 
growth prospects.
 
Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in 
November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit.

The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, 
better than the forecast -7.8 points.

In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8. 
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:

EU consumer confidence hasn’t been in positive territory for nearly two 
decades so today’s negative reading is no surprise, but [ECB president] Mario 
Draghi will be pleased to see the above expectations data is at least moving in 
the right direction.

Draghi deserves credit for maintaining a relatively stable eurozone economy at 
one of the most uncertain geopolitical times in memory.

With the cloud of Brexit hanging over the future direction of the eurozone, in 
addition to volatile elections and referendums on the horizon that could add 
further uncertainty, holding firm is likely just what the doctor ordered.

Some upbeat US economic news, with new home sales rising to their highest 
level in more than nine and a half years in October.

The National Association of Realtors said sales rose 2% to an annual rate of 
5.6m, with September’s figure revised up from 5.47m to 5.49m.

Analysts had expected a figure of 5.43m in October.

Meanwhile the Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index came in 
at +4 in November, compared to -4 in October.

The surge in US markets - based on the recent strength of the oil price and 
hopes that Donald Trumps infrastructure plans will boost the economy - is 
continuing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has breached 19,000 for the first time, 
touching 19007, before slipping back to 18,991, up 0.18%.

Both the Nasdaq Composite - up 0.37% - and the S&P 500 - 0.23% better - opened 
at new peaks.
 
Over in the eurozone, and some good news from Portugal:

The oil price has been rising in recent days on growing expectation that Opec 
might agree to limit output at its meeting next week, following an outline plan 
drawn up in Algiers in September.

But as is always the case, it does not take much to dent the mood. Reuters is 
reporting that Iran, Iraq and Indonesia have doubts about the proposed output 
cut.

So Brent crude, previously as high as $49.96m a barrel today is now down 0.59% 
at $48.61. And West Texas Intermediate is now down 0.56% at $47.97.

1) Britain is on track to blow past its budget forecasts for this year, 
despite cutting its borrowing in October by 25%

.


The UK has now borrowed £48.6bn since April 2016, down from £54.2bn a year 
ago, but already close to the £55bn target for this current financial year (to 
March 2017).

Economists believe it could overshoot the target by £10bn or more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/22/uk-public-finances-economic-healthcheck-autumn-statement-business-live?page=with:block-58342312e4b0da4920d6b0b6#block-58342312e4b0da4920d6b0b6>
, underlining the weak state of the public finances.

The better news is that October’s deficit fell to £4.8bn, from £6.4bn a year 
ago, thanks to a rise in corporation tax receipts.

 A new survey showed that confidence fell across all ages and income groups in 
the last three months.

3) British factories have reported a pick-up in orders, after a summer 
slowdown.

However, many are also planning to hike prices to cover the slump in the pound.
