At this year’s Changing Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/changing-media-summit>, News UK’s Dominic 
Carter and the BFI’s Kerensa Samanidis explain how they’re making video video 
work within their own businesses.

Dominic discusses how The Sun needs to operate at scale to be successful. He 
believes storytelling with video can take emotional engagement with stories to 
another level, and that making the video engaging is much more important for 
likes and shares than worrying about length.


Kerensa explains their decision making process during development and the 
launch of their online video platform, BFI Player.
