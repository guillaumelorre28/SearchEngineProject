It says something about human nature that the most tweeted about event in 
sport this year was Brazil’s 7-1 trouncing against Germany at theWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football>. The hosts fell from 
their perch the way Homer Simpson falls off a cliff: the pain went on and on 
and on and on and on and on and on. And the people of the world united to tweet 
in derision, delight, dismay and disbelief.


The World Cup dominated the attention of sports fans across the globe in 2014, 
with six of the 10 most mentioned moments coming from those 33 days in the 
summer. Mario Balotelli offering his romantic services to the Queen, Mario 
Götze scoring the final goal of the competition and Wayne Rooney’s strike 
against Uruguay were all popular topics, but the World Cup was a victory for 
the German concept of schadenfreude.
