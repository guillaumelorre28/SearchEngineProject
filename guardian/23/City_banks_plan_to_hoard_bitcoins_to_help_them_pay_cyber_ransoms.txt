Several of London’s largest banks are looking to stockpile bitcoins in order 
to pay off cyber criminals who threaten to bring down their critical IT systems.

The virtual currency, which is highly prized by criminal networks because it 
is difficult to trace, is being acquired by blue chip companies in order to pay 
ransoms, according to a leading IT expert.

On Friday, hackers attacked the websites of a number of leading online 
companies includingTwitter, Spotify and Reddit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/ddos-attack-dyn-internet-denial-service>
. They used a special code to harness the power of hundreds of thousands of 
internet-connected home devices, such as CCTV cameras and printers, to launch 
“distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks through a US company called Dyn, 
which provides directory services to online companies.DDoS attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/brian-krebs-ddos-attack-google-protection-cybercrime>
 involve inundating computer servers with so much data traffic that they cannot 
cope.

There is no evidence that Dyn was the subject of extortion demands but it has 
become apparent that hackers have been using the code to threaten other 
businesses into paying them with bitcoins or risk becoming the target of 
similar attacks.

Dr Simon Moores, a former technology ambassador for the UK government and 
chair of the annual international e-Crime Congress, the global body that brings 
together IT professionals, said the scale and ferocity of the attacks meant 
some banks were coming round to the view that it was cheaper to pay off the 
criminals than risk an attack.

“The police will concede that they don’t have the resources available to deal 
with this because of the significant growth in the number of attacks,” Moores 
said. “From a purely pragmatic perspective, financial institutions are now 
exploring the need to maintain stocks of bitcoin in the unfortunate event that 
they themselves become the target of a high-intensity attack, when law 
enforcement perhaps might not be able to assist them at the speed with which 
they need to put themselves back in business.”

Moores declined to identify the banks buying up bitcoins but it is understood 
senior police officers have been made aware of the practice. The cost to 
businesses of an attack can far outweigh paying off the blackmailers: telecoms

 lost 101,000 customers and suffered costs of £60m as a result of a cyber 
attack last year.

“Big companies are now starting to worry that an attack is no longer an 
information security issue, it’s a board and shareholder and customer 
confidence issue,” Moores said. “What we are seeing is the weaponisation of 
these [hacking] tools. It becomes a much broader issue than businesses ever 
anticipated.”

We've got to come to grips with this. Everybody's over-exposed
Dr Simon Moores 
In recent months, DDoS attacks have led to around 600 gigabits of data a 
second being directed at targets – more than enough, according to experts, to 
bring most websites down.

Moores predicted that the situation was becoming critical. “Once it goes above 
a terabit, that wipes out any protection. No current protection systems can 
deal with that sort of flood.”

In September the website KrebsOnSecurity.com <https://krebsonsecurity.com> was 
the target of what it describes as “an extremely large and unusual distributed 
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack designed to knock the site offline”. Initial 
reports put it at approximately 665 gigabits of traffic a second, far more than 
is typically needed to knock most sites offline.

Some experts believe the attacks were launched in response to articles that 
Krebs <https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/23/brians-krebs-ddos-attack/> had 
published about the DDoS-for-hire service vDOS, which coincided with the 
arrests of two young men identified as its founders.

The attack on Krebs was launched by a large botnet, a collection of enslaved 
computers – in this case, hundreds of thousands ofhacked devices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/oct/22/how-did-hackers-use-everyday-devices-to-launch-a-cyber-attack-video-report>
 that constitute the internet of things (IoT), notably routers, IP cameras and 
digital video recorders. These devices are the internet’s achilles heel. Unlike 
personal computers or smartphones, they are often not password protected, 
relying on factory settings. Because of this they make soft targets forbotnets 
<https://digitalguardian.com/blog/attack-killer-cameras> scanning the internet 
for IoT systems that can be easily compromised.

The Krebs attack might have gone largely unnoticed outside of internet 
security circles if someone using the name Anna-senpai had not then chosen to 
release the source code that powered the botnet on to a hackers’ forum.

“When I first go in DDoS industry, I wasn’t planning on staying in it long,” 
Anna-senpai said on the Hack Forums site. “I made my money, there’s lots of 
eyes looking at IoT now, so it’s time to GTFO.”

Within hours of Anna-senpai’s decision to release the botnet into the wild, it 
was creating havoc as others started to employ the code to enslave more 
devices. Soon an army of zombified devices was mobilising against Dyn.

By targeting Dyn, it appears that hackers were able temporarily to disrupt a 
raft of sites. Others that reported problems included Mashable, CNN, theNew 
York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Yelp.

Amazon’s web services division reported issues in western Europe. In the UK, 
Twitter and several news sites could not be accessed by some users.

Anna-senpai’s identity and motivation for releasing the code remains a 
mystery. Some believe state agents were involved. China, Russia and North Korea 
have all been mentioned in IT circles.

“While this particular attack [on Dyn] may not have been motivated by 
extortion, a new model of ransom-based attacks could be on the horizon, 
motivated to pay off threats for fear of infrastructure-wide customer outages,” 
said Thomas Pore, director of IT at Plixer, a malware incident response 
company. “An infrastructure outage, such as DNS [denial of service], against a 
service provider impacting both the provider and customers may prompt a quick 
ransom payoff to avoid unwanted customer attrition or larger financial impact.”

The problem facing businesses battling the hackers is becoming one of scale. 
The devices the hackers can recruit to launch their attacks is growing 
exponentially.

It is estimated that there are anywhere between 7bn and 19bn devices connected 
to the IoT at the moment. Conservative predictions suggest that this figure 
will balloon to between 30bn and 50bn within five years.

At some point, Moores believes that the dam will burst as the rollout of 
connected smart devices will allow for the harnessing of devastating computer 
power that can no longer be repelled by existing IT security systems.

He draws an analogy with financial crises, predicting that a “Lehman Brothers 
moment” is on the cards.

“We’ve got to come to grips with this,” Moores said. “Everybody’s overexposed.”

RISE OF THE HACKER

The evolution of DDoS attacks

February 2000

“Mafiaboy”, a 15-year-old Canadian called Michael Calce, launches the first 
big distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS), crippling popular websites. 
His Project Rivolta takes down Yahoo, the number one search engine at the time, 
and many leading tech companies.

January 2008

Hacking collective Anonymous targets the Church of Scientology in an operation 
called Project Chanology that briefly knocks Scientology.org offline.

April 2012

A cyber-attack by anti-Israel groups on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day 
fails in its attempt to erase all mentions of Israel from the internet.

March 2013

Spamhaus, a filtering service to weed out spam emails, is subjected to a DDoS 
attack after adding a web hosting company called Cyberbunker to its blacklisted 
sites. Cyberbunker and other hosting companies hire hackers to shut down 
Spamhaus using botnets. At its peak the attack was being conducted at a rate of 
330 gigabits a second, around five times the average DDoS attack.

January 2016

A group called New World Hacking attacks the BBC’s website at a rate of 602 
gigabits a second, almost twice the size of the previous record of 334 gigabits 
a second.
