 Ralph Assor, a 61-year-old businessman, has accumulated a pension fund worth 
£60,000 with Friends Provident, a reasonable sum by most people's standards.

 He has been told to expect an income of £5,000 from that. But what upsets him 
almost as much as the low return is the inflexibility of the annuity he must 
buy with his accumulated saving.

 In particular, he is appalled by the fact that were he to die soon after 
retiring, much of his money would be lost.

 If he buys a 'guaranteed' annuity, he can ensure that his wife receives a 
pension for, say, five years after his death. But the guarantee would provide 
limited protection. 'If I were to live for, say, two years after drawing my 
annuity, my pension could pass to my wife. If she dies, say, three years after 
I have passed away, the total payment by the insurance company would be 
£25,000, leaving a balance in the fund of £35,000.

 'I am now informed that this balance is kept by the insurer and not passed on 
to my estate on my wife's death. This money has been saved by me. Why should 
the insurance company keep it?'

 Insurance companies insist that the system is fair. But like many people 
retiring now, Assor feels the annuity represents poor value for a lifetime of 
hard saving, particularly in comparison with other investments. If he had 
£60,000 in a personal equity plan, the funds would pass to his estate. Assor 
also has money in a property and says: 'I am getting a very good return, and 
property goes up all the time.'

 He feels that the annuity deal he has been offered is at odds with the 
Government's emphasis on individuals providing for themselves. He was shocked 
when he discovered how annuities work, and believes others will be similarly 
appalled.
