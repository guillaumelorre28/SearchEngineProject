Pizza delivery historians of the future will look back on 2016 with wonder as 
the year Pizza Hut devised the first pizza-ordering tattoo, heralded in a 
grime-soaked ad to appeal to a generation more ink than skin. Simply get the 
hi-tech temporary tattoo, which knows your location, tap it with your 
smartphone – pizza ordered. That Pizza Hut now sells itself as a delivery 
service reminds us of its decline.

Once, along with Deep Pan and Pizzaland, its chain dominated the high street – 
American-derived but as English as shopping precincts. Who could forget its 
panelled booths, or stacking up at its sneeze-proof salad bars? Pizza Express 
has driven all that away, its branches stationed every 100 yards, offering the 
assurance of nationwide uniformity.

Then, there is the sourdough fad. In the 20th century, we’d have been put out 
if our pizza dough had been sour, though being a non-complaining generation we 
wouldn’t have said anything, merely asked for a sachet of sugar and rectified 
the dough ourselves. These are sourer times: of grime, tattoos and contriving 
any excuse to replace human interaction with a smartphone fad, however 
bewilderingly daft.
