We are a married couple in our 60s with grownup children who come to stay. My 
husband has his own bedroom and is addicted to sex chatrooms. The sounds can be 
heard all over the house every night. He refuses to acknowledge this, and says 
it is all in my imagination. Should I leave the marriage now to protect the 
wider family, or wait for matters to be overheard by our children? (Friends no 
longer stay.) A counsellor has advised turning detective, but I feel ill with 
the worry of it all and have little energy left.
