Almost 120,000 bitcoin worth around $78m has been stolen from Hong Kong-based 
Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, causing a 20% drop 
in the value of the currency.

The hack, which is the largest of its kind and limited to bitcoin wallets held 
by the company, forced Bitfinex to cease trading and report the theft to law 
enforcement, the company said in a statement on its website.

Bitfinex said in a statement on its website: “We are investigating the breach 
to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their 
bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been 
affected by the breach.”

 Zane Tackett, director of community and product development for Bitfinex, 
said: “The [119,756 bitcoin] was stolen from users’ segregated wallets.”

The value of bitcoin plunged nearly 20% on the news, according to data from

. The 120,000 bitcoin account for around 0.75% of all bitcoin in circulation.

Antony Lewis, a bitcoin expert in Singapore, said: “It’s the biggest USD 
exchange, so outside China it’s the one that everyone has an account with. It’s 
very liquid, folk can trade on margin, lots of daily volume.”

 It is not yet clear whether the theft was an inside job or whether hackers 
were able to gain access to the system externally.

It is also unknown whether the theft will force Bitfinex into bankruptcy. A 
similar loss of bitcoin from the then biggest exchange MtGox forced itinto 
bankruptcy protection in 2014
