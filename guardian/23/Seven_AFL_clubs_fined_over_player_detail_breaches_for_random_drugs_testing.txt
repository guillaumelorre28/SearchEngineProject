Hawthorn <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hawthorn> were among seven AFL 
clubs handed fines by the league on Wednesday for failing to keep player 
information up to date. Clubs are required to keep the AFL updated on the 
whereabouts of their players at all times so that they can be subjected to 
random drug tests conducted by Asada.

The Hawks were the worst offenders, sanctioned $7,500 in total for three 
breaches, West Coast and Geelong were sanctioned $5,000 for two breaches and 
Collingwood, Essendon, the Western Bulldogs and St Kilda were each fined $2,500 
for one breach apiece.

However, all breaches were considered administrative rather than a deliberate 
attempt to avoid drug testing.

AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon said all clubs need to constantly ensure 
that all paperwork requirements were met at all times. “AFL players may be 
tested 365 days of the year for World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited drugs,” an
AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> statement read.

“While no tests were missed for players from any of the clubs sanctioned, 
under the operation of the AFL’s code withAsada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada>, it is the club that is sanctioned 
for the failure to provide complete up-to-date whereabouts information at all 
times for testing purposes.

“In these cases the failures were found to be administrative in nature and not 
intentional.”

Greater Western Sydney player Lachie Whitfield is currently under 
investigation by the AFL and Asada for spending three days at former 
development manager Craig Lambert’s house in an alleged attempt to avoid drug 
testing.
