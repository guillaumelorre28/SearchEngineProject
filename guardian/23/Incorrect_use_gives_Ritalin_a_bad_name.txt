It is depressing to read yet another article (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/18/behaviour-drugs-four-year-olds>
, 19 March) criticising the use of methylphenidate (Ritalin) for the treatment 
of ADHD. Clearly if the drug is being wrongly prescribed that is a bad thing, 
but this should not obscure the tremendous benefits that it brings to many 
children and their families.

Our son and daughter both have ADHD. Despite the efforts of various 
therapists, they found life very difficult. Lack of concentration meant that 
they struggled to understand what was happening at school. Home life was 
stressful due to the constant misbehaviour and arguments. Perhaps worst of all, 
forming friendships was difficult. Imagine always being the child who is bottom 
of the class, always in trouble, has no friends and who doesn't get invited to 
parties. ADHD is not a trivial disorder.

The transformation once our children were given methylphenidate was profound. 
Suddenly they were able to concentrate, to interact in a positive way with 
other children, and to sit quietly when they wished. The drug is not a sedative 
and their personalities have not been affected. It doesn't provide a complete 
cure for ADHD, but it does have an enormous impact on their quality of life. It 
would be unfortunate if other children were denied this treatment because of 
the negative publicity surrounding its incorrect use in a minority of cases.
