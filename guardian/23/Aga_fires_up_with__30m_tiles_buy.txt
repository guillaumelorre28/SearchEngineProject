Aspiring interior designers will soon be able to buy hearty oil-fired Aga 
cookers and Fired Earth tiles under the same roof, thanks to the takeover of 
the paints and ceramics firm by Aga Foodservice Group for £30m yesterday.

Aga, which has a £150m war chest following the disposal of its pipes business 
earlier this year, snapped up Fired Earth from PPM Ventures, Prudential's 
private equity arm.

Aga's chief executive, William McGrath, said he would seek to cross-fertilise 
both brands in their respective stores. The deal will provide Aga with a 
much-needed south-east England platform via Fired Earth's 46 showrooms and out 
of town shops, and give Fired Earth access to many of Aga's 87 shops and 
centres across the UK.

Mr McGrath said he will be seeking further acquisitions on the food service 
side - particularly in the US: "Since the US market started to slow, we believe 
there are plenty of opportunities. It is the right time to have net cash."

Of the £29.5m Aga is paying for Fired Earth, some £20m is debt, which means 
that founder Nicholas Kneale, with a 20% stake, pocketed £2m. Fired Earth made 
£2.1m operating profits on £18m sales last year and was taken private in 1998 
for £20.6m. Aga shares rose 1p to 251p.
