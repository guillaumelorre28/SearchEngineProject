Aurora Orchestra’s Roadtrip takes a journey across the US with a programme 
that juxtaposes core American compositions by John Adams, Charles Ives and 
Aaron Copland with specially commissioned folk and pop-song arrangements and 
new works byNico Muhly <https://www.theguardian.com/music/nico-muhly> and the 
Aurora Orchestra’s own Max Baillie.

Reviewing the CD, Andrew Clements wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/27/aurora-orchestra-road-trip-adams-copland-cd-review>
: “It is an imaginative and carefully thought out scheme, and certainly becomes 
a highly attractive package when it’s performed with the panache that the 
Aurora Orchestra and its conductor,Nicholas Collon, 
<http://www.nicholascollon.co.uk/> bring to everything.” Read the entire review
