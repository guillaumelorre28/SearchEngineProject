Jon Snow has apologised for making a joke about the death of Alan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-rickman> in an interview with fellow 
actor Richard Wilson on Channel Four news.

The presenter asked Wilson, who was friends with Rickman and is best known for 
his portrayal of Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave, whether news of the 
death inspired that character’s famous catchphrase “I don’t believe it”.

Reacting to criticism on Twitter, Snow said on Saturday the comment was a 
“mistake in the heat of a sad moment” and that he apologised unreservedly.

On Thursday night’s programme, Snow asked his guest whether he knew Rickman 
was dying, to which the actor replied: “I did.”.

Snow then joked: “So it wasn’t a case of ‘I don’t believe it’ then?”

Wilson did not appear to take offence at Snow’s quip, but some viewers reacted 
angrily. After Snow’s apology, however, there were numerous supportive 
responses on Twitter.

<https://twitter.com/leedsju> I'm sure Alan Rickman didn't mind at all. He was 
probably laughing at it.
