got silver. Then they triedever so hard again 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/video/2011/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-art-yorkshire-garden-video>
, and got silver again. But this year the Yorkshire garden at Chelsea has 
finally achieved its ambition, and been awarded aRoyal Horticultural Society 
gold medal.

That's what the biggest and brashest of England's counties naturally expects; 
(actually – interesting fact - historic Yorkshire also contains England's 
second-biggest county: the West Riding on its own beats Devon, Lincolnshire and 
other such rivals). But the organisers made the mistake of not enlisting the 
magical powers of the Mighty Sisters until now.

In 2010, the garden was themed on rhubarb and custard, picking up the lore and 
legend of the'rhubarb-growing triangle'  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/09/rhubarb-growers-yorkshire-hope-freeze>
between Wakefield, Pontefract and Leeds. Last year, a rather architectural 
construction of drystone walls and the like drew on Yorkshire Artists, with 
references to David Hockney, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore.

But at last, this year, Charlotte, Emily and Bronte appeared in a dream to 
Gary Verity, the chief executive ofWelcome to Yorkshire  
<http://www.yorkshire.com>which organises the garden, and said: "Daft ha'porth. 
It's us you need."

So it has proved. The massive metropolitan cliché mill grinds out unswerving 
descriptions of the sisters and their moors as wuthering and howling, but we 
who live here know better. Charlotte herself wrote of Emily after her death and 
how:

There is not a knoll of heather, not a branch of fern, not a young bilberry 
leaf, not a fluttering lark or linnet, but reminds me of her

And Emily carolled in one of her perhaps less original poems:

May flowers are opening
And leaves unfolding free
There are bees in every blossom
And birds in every tree.

Anyway, Verity arose and his staff carried out the ghostly instructions, 
recreating the 'Bronte bridge' which crosses the Bronte beck by the Bronte 
waterfalls on the way toTop Withens 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/dec/16/emilybronte-yorkshire-topwithens-pennines>
 (aka Wuthering Heights) above the sisters' home village of Haworth. They also 
crammed in a goodly stock of plants, making the composition more garden than 
artificial construction. Although the Brontes were not actually very good 
gardeners themselves, as theGuardian Northerner recently described 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/apr/30/brontes-sisters-haworth-yorkshire-chelsea-flower-show>
, they would surely have approved.

Verity says: 

The garden has had a non-stop stream of admirers since The Chelsea Flower Show 
opened but this was the ultimate goal, taking gold back to Yorkshire. This is 
the third time we've entered and we're delighted to be going home with a gold 
medal for the first time. We hope to convert thousands of well-wishers into 
tourists over the course of the week.


 
Tracy Foster, the garden's designer <http://www.tracyfostergardendesign.co.uk/>
 from Leeds, worked closely with theBrontë Parsonage Museum  
<http://www.bronte.info/>in Haworth throughout the project, describes how the 
garden tried to source materials from nearby, including boulders from Dove 
Stones moor:

The stone is beautiful. We have deliberately not cleaned it so it has aged 
naturally and it is of the period when the girls would have been walking around 
the Yorkshire Moors and writing their novels. The stone still has its original 
lichens and mosses attached which look just perfect in the garden and really 
give a sense of the beauty and bleakness that epitomise the wonderful moorland 
landscape.


She is properly over the moon, deservedly:

My first Chelsea and I get gold, it doesn't get much better than this! I'm so 
proud of what we have achieved. I hope the high profile medal inspires more 
people to come to Yorkshire to see for themselves the landscape that brought 
gold to the garden.
