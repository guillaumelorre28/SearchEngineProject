Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has come to the 
defence of the British newspapers that attacked three high court judges after 
they ruled that the government could not trigger article 50 without a vote in 
parliament.

Speaking on board a flight to Delhi for her first bilateral meeting abroad, 
the prime minister said she believed the high court had every right to deliver 
its verdict but argued that journalists were similarly free to complain about 
it.

Theresa May insists government are ‘getting on’ with Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/06/theresa-may-insists-government-are-getting-on-with-brexit-video>
The decision and its response caused controversy after the judges were branded 
“enemies of the people” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling>
 and the cabinet minister Sajid Javid said the ruling flew in the face of 
democracy and was an unacceptable attempt to frustrate the will of the people.

“I believe in and value the independence of our judiciary. I also value the 
freedom of our press,” she told reporters. “These both underpin our democracy.”

May also stressed that the government was determined to overturn the legal 
decision, whichprevents her from starting the formal process of exiting the EU 
without a vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
 in the Commons and Lords.

She warned MPs and peers that it was their duty to respect the outcome of 
June’s referendum in favour of Brexit, as she highlighted that asimilar legal 
case in Belfast had resulted in an opposite ruling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/28/belfast-court-rejects-legal-challenges-brexit>
.

“In terms of the legal situation, we have had two court cases in the UK. They 
have come out with different decisions. The Northern Irish court found in 
favour of the government; the high court found against the government. We think 
we have strong legal arguments and will be taking those arguments to the 
supreme court,” she said. “What’s important for MPs and peers is to recognise 
that parliament voted to give the decision on our membership of theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> to the people on 23 June – a 
majority voted and we should now deliver.”

The prime minister also made clear that she would not compromise over the 
issue of immigration, which she saw as a red line when it came to her “end 
goals” in Brexit negotiations.

She hit back at comments from Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, 
that he would use the court ruling to pursue a soft Brexit, arguing that 
parliamentarians should be able to block a “more self-harming, hard Brexit”.

May responded: “I think the people spoke on the 23 June and I think it was an 
important aspect that underpinned people’s approach to that was a concern they 
had about control of movement of people from the EU into the UK. I believe it 
is important for the UK government to deliver on that.”

But she was unable to say whether the government would be able to bring the 
overall net migration numbers down to her government’s target of the tens of 
thousands by a 2020 general election.


May’s comments came as Labour said it would not block the triggering of 
article 50, which begins the formal process of Britain leaving the EU.Tom Watson
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tom-watson>, the deputy leader, said the 
party would instead seek to put pressure on May to bring more detailed 
negotiating terms to the House of Commons.


The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, appeared to suggest in an interview with the 
Sunday Mirror 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-gives-theresa-ultimatum-9204393>
 that his party would be prepared to vote against the government invoking 
article 50 unless May signed up to hisBrexit “bottom lines” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/05/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-brexit-bottom-line-article-50-early-election>
, including pressing for full access to the single market and safeguarding 
workers’ rights.

But appearing on Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live, Watson clarified the 
party’s position, saying: “No, we’re not going to hold this up. The British 
people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to 
Westminster.

“I think it’s important, the country needs to hear this, because I think most 
people think that that court judgment meant that the referendum result has 
fallen. It hasn’t, it will go through. We want Theresa May to be accountable to 
parliament, but the people have spoken and we respect that decision.”

Corbyn later echoed Watson’s assurances.
Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) 
There must be transparency and accountability on Brexit terms. We won't block 
Article 50 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50> but will fight for 
a Brexit that works for Britain

Labour MPs in Brexit-leaning constituencies are nervous about the party 
adopting any position that appears to be one of seeking to keep Britain in the 
EU. But unless the party is willing to block the triggering of article 50, it 
is unclear howLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> can exert 
influence over the process.


The prime minister has reassured European leaders that she plans to stick to 
her self-imposed deadline of triggering article 50by the end of March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws>
.

Corbyn had told the Sunday Mirror: “Sorry, but we live in a democracy and the 
government has to be responsive to parliament. It’s not my timetable, so it’s 
up to her to respond.”


The Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats are thought to be 
willing to vote down any legislation on article 50 unless they receive 
reassurances. Added to Corbyn’s tough language, this suggests the government 
could be defeated, triggering an early election, which Corbyn said he would 
welcome. “It would give us the chance to put before the British people an 
alternative economic strategy for this country,” he said.

The interview, which came after Corbyn refused to answer questions about a 
potential early general election from an ITV reporter earlier in the day, sowed 
confusion about Labour’s Brexit strategy, which had appeared clearer since a 
shadow Brexit team led by Keir Starmerwas appointed last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/keir-starmer-calls-for-immigration-to-be-reduced>
.

The government is planning to appeal against Thursday’s high court judgment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
, which ruled that it would be illegal for the government to trigger article 50 
without consulting parliament.

The Brexit secretary, David Davis, said the judgment appeared to imply that 
the government would have to bring a bill before both houses of parliament, and 
all opposition parties, as well as remain-leaning Conservatives, were 
considering how they would use the extra leverage that could give them.



The prime minister wrote in the Sunday Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/05/why-i-will-not-allow-the-british-peoples-vote-for-brexit-to-be-s/>
: “Parliament voted to put the decision about our membership of the EU in the 
hands of the British people. The people made their choice, and did so 
decisively. It is the responsibility of the government to get on with the job 
and to carry out their instruction in full. MPs and peers who regret the 
referendum result need to accept what the people decided.”

On Saturday, the justice secretary, Liz Truss, issued a statement upholding 
the independence of the judiciary
