Comments
173 entries, no mistakes: a bit disappointing for a Christmas competition. The 
puzzle itself you seem to have found not too testing, having once mastered the 
preamble, but the clue-writing challenge may have proved too daunting for some. 
The judging process was certainly protracted, each part of each double clue 
needing to be carefully unpicked and then assessed for soundness before I could 
sit back, as it were, and judge the whole thing for readability and 
inspiration. As well as commenting favourably on the puzzle as a whole, for 
which I was grateful, a few made helpful suggestions as to how the clue 
specifications could be improved, in case I use the format again. New ideas for 
Christmas themes are increasingly difficult to dream up, but if I do return to 
this one it won't be for quite a while. Sighs of relief all round, perhaps.

In asking you to choose your own clue words (a late decision on my part), I 
thought I was giving you a certain amount of extra help, though it's possible 
that the wider freedom of choice simply added to the task you were faced with. 
It certainly added to mine! The range you came up with was understandably wide: 
of those that were used more than once the most popular were REINDEER/REDEEMER 
and CHAMPERS/PRESENTS. The 'Christmas flavour' I asked for could be in either 
or both of the words chosen, or in the wording of the clue itself, or in both 
of these: all were equally acceptable to the judge. Favourite among my own 
clues was 'Those encouraging sailor to be in French street, genuine sport when 
it's going after women' (ABETTERS/STERLING; ABETRESTLING). As I think most of 
you realized when concocting you own clues, it was necessary to indicate 
unambiguously at least once the order of the central jumbled letters, to enable 
the words to be entered once solved. So, for example, a pair of separate 
anagrams for the two words would fail to indicate the correct order for the 
central jumble. A few otherwise promising clues were flawed in this regard.
That apart, the biggest (and possibly toughest) challenge was, I think, to 
produce overall wording that was both smooth and convincing.

Anyway it seems to have been an enjoyable seasonal special. My thanks to all 
who competed, and my best wishes for the new year to all Azed solvers. More 
next time (I hope) on your response to the points I raised in the December slip.
