The British Horseracing Board said yesterday that it "warmly welcomes" the 
confirmation by Richard Caborn, the minister for sport, that the Levy system 
for the funding of the sport is to be retained.

"Racing is extremely grateful to government for today's announcement," Martin 
Broughton, the BHB chairman, said. "It gives the sport vital reassurance about 
its longer term funding beyond 2009."
