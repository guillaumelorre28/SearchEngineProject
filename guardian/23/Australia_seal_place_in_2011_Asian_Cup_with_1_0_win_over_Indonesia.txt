Mark Milligan scored his first international goal as Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> sealed their place in the 2011 
Asian Cup with a 1-0 victory over Indonesia at Suncorp Stadium.

The Socceroos never really hit top gear, but quick thinking and a neat finish 
from Milligan four minutes before half-time was enough for the hosts to book 
their ticket to Qatar â€“ much to the delight of the 20,422-strong crowd.

Milligan, deployed as a central defender for the match, used his shoulder to 
deflect a looping dead-ball strike from Luke Wilkshire onto the crossbar and 
then pounced on the rebound with Indonesia goalkeeper Markus Rihihina left 
stranded.

After a trying qualification campaign, typified by a loss to Kuwait on home 
soil last year, Australia needed to take at least one point away from the final 
Asian Cup qualifier to ensure they would not miss out.

National coach Pim Verbeek handed full debuts to both Tommy Oar and Shannon 
Cole, and entrusted a squad made up of predominately A-League talent to get the 
job done against Indonesia, ranked 136th in the world.

Verbeek would have had a few nervous moments while his side failed to score in 
the first 40 minutes despite controlling the tempo and dominating possession in 
the early stages of what was a reasonably physical encounter.

But Milligan's impressive effort allowed Verbeek to collect his thoughts 
before a thoroughly entertaining second period where Oar's slick skills came to 
the fore.

The 18-year-old winger was kept reasonably quiet in the opening half, but his 
pace and lethal left foot were more often than not a part of Australia's surges 
forward after the break.
