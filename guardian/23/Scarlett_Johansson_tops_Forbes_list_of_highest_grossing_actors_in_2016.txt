Scarlett Johansson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson> has 
been named the top grossing actor of 2016 by Forbes magazine.

Johansson, 32, edged out her Captain America co-stars Chris Evans and Robert 
Downey Jr <https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdowneyjr>, who tied for 
second place with $1.15bn each.

Forbes calculated the annual ranking using the global ticket sales of top 
actors’ films.

Briton Felicity Jones was ninth after making $805m at the box office, largely 
thanks to massive hitRogue One: A Star Wars Story
