has continued with the discovery of six decapitated heads in one state and the 
killing of seven people in another.


 The Michoacan state prosecutor’s office said the six heads were found on 
Christmas Day in Jiquilpan, a municipality near the state of Jalisco in a 
region that has been a battleground between competing drug gangs in recent 
years.

In a brief statement, it said the six men had not yet been identified and 
their bodies had not been found.

Meanwhile state security officials in the neighbouring state of Guerrero said 
gunmen entered a house and shot seven people dead in the municipality of Atoyac 
de Alvarez. Five were members of one family and two were a married couple.

State security spokesman Roberto Alvarez Heredia said in a statement that two 
of the seven killed were municipal police officers and one a state police 
officer.

The preliminary investigation suggested the gunmen wanted to kill one of the 
victims in a revenge attack but ended up killing them all.

 Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, is one of the states most plagued by 
drug gang violence.
