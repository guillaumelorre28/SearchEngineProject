Carey Davies’s image of a dry stone waller most certainly needs modifying (
Rugged men build rugged walls in rugged landscapes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/07/dry-stone-walls-millstone-grit-limestone-country-diary>
, Country Diary, 7 November). Here in Dorset the local branch of the Dry Stone 
Walling Association boasts a number of highly skilled and highly respected 
women members (sadly I am not one of them) who are often to be found in the 
rugged, windswept locations that are the natural home of dry stone walls. They 
may, or may not, consider themselves to be rugged, but their dedication to high 
standards and their stamina in all weathers are testament to their passion for 
the craft.

• I see that Roy Boffy (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/if-elected-donald-trump-poses-the-greatest-threat-to-all-our-futures>
, 8 November) has moved to Sutton Coldfield. What a shame. I used to be very 
proud that someone from Walsall’s letters were regularly published.

• As a severe migraine sufferer, I was advised to give up chocolate, cheese 
and coffee more than 60 years ago (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/08/sugar-free-drinks-not-such-a-sweet-deal>
, 9 November). The migraines continued for another 20 years but I did lose 
weight and I can still fit into my “age-inappropriate” M&S jeans (alsoLetters
