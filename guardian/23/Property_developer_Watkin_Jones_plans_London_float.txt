Watkin Jones, a developer of student accommodation in the UK, expects to be 
valued at about £255m when it lists on the junior Alternative Investment Market 
in London this month.


 Since 1999, the company has built 28,000 “student beds” across 88 sites with 
funding from institutional partners.

 Watkin Jones said it had the capacity to deliver at least 10 student 
developments a year and its current programme consisted of 11,300 beds and 31 
developments.

 Revenue from continuing operations rose about 7% to £244.2m in the year ended 
30 September, while operating profit more than doubled to £32.5m.

 Watkin Jones aims to expand into the private rented sector, where demand has 
risen sharply amid an acute housing shortage and rising property prices.

Zeus Capital and Peel Hunt were acting as bookrunners and brokers, the company 
said.

Trading in Watkin Jones shares is expected to begin on 23 March.
