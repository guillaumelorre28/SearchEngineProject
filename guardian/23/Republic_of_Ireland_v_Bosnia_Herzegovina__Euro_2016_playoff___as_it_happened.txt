A wonderful atmosphere in the Aviva Stadium, as Ireland win the second leg of 
a major-championship play-off for the first time! They deserved that result, 
because while the visitors enjoyed the lion’s share of possession, they were 
undone by rope-a-dope tactics. Ireland soaked up the pressure, conceded very 
few real chances, and put theirs away when they arrived. The penalty in the 
first half may have been farcical, but the result was secured in the second, so 
controversy doesn’t come into it. Ultimately, Ireland are the deserved victors 
in this play-off, and will be joining theEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> party! Magnificent scenes. 
Still, poor old Edin Visca, eh? He wasbrilliant.

90 min +2: Another free kick to the visitors, this time in the middle of the 
Irish half. Everyone in the box. The ball drops to Ibisevic, on the left-hand 
side of the six-yard box. Leaning back, he lashes a hell of a shot past 
Randolph ... and onto the crossbar! So unlucky! But it’s too little, too late. 
Dzeko and Djuric are booked for some moaning after the ball goes out of play.

87 min: A high ball into the Irish box leads to another Bosnian corner on the 
left. From the set piece, a massive playground scramble in the six-yard box. 
Someone should slam it home, really. Dzeko, perhaps, in the middle of it all. 
But the ball bobbles into the arms of Randolph. If they can’t get a shot on 
target from that, it’s not going to happen for them.

85 min: Corner for the visitors down the left. It’s whipped to the near post, 
where Walters and Spahic compete. The referee signals for another corner, then 
changes his mind. One way and another, the referee has been hopeless tonight. 
But for all the controversy over the penalty decision, his bungling doesn’t 
look to have made any difference.Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> haven’t scored.

83 min: Long, going up for a high ball with Zukanovic, flicks a kick into the 
side of his opponent. It threatens to kick off, and Zukanovic is livid, but the 
referee shows only yellow.

78 min: A throw deep in Irish territory. Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> knock it around in 
pretty triangles. Then Lulic embarks on a skitter into the area. He shapes to 
shoot, but Coleman spreads himself to block. Corner on the left, from which 
Randolph rises highest to punch clear with confidence.

75 min: Coleman bashes a clearance down the right. The pointless Spahic should 
mop it up, but he miscontrols and allows Long, on his shoulder, to tear clear 
on goal! Long’s never quite got the ball under control, though, and with 
Begovic coming off his line, bobbles a poor shot wide left of the goal. That 
would have been that.

73 min: Brady very nearly releases Long down the inside-left channel, but 
there’s a bit too much juice on the ball and Begovic comes to the edge of his 
area to claim. The Aviva is in full voice right now.

71 min: Visca comes zipping down the right yet again. If there’s one player 
who doesn’t deserve to lose, after his performance over the two legs, it’s this 
lad. But his cross is smacked clear from the waiting Djuric by Clark.

GOAL! Republic of Ireland 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Walters 70); agg 3-1

Finally Brady delivers something special! The free kick, 35 yards out on the 
left, drops into the six-yard box. Vranjes, at full stretch, looks to hook away 
from danger, but succeeds only in guiding the ball to Walters, on the 
right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Walters creams it into the right-hand 
portion of the net, and Ireland are so close to theEuro 2016

69 min: Medunjanin makes way for Djuric. When the game restarts, Spahic gets 
himself involved once again in nonsense, sticking a high boot into Walters’ 
trouser arrangement. That really should be a second yellow card. The referee’s 
had a shocker. But no matter! Because...

68 min: A free kick for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina>, 25 yards out on the 
right. A chance to load the box. Medunjanin curls it in carefully, but it’s 
battered clear by the head of Clark. Randolph hasn’t had to make a serious save 
yet.

66 min: Hendrick sprays a lovely long ball down the left wing to release 
McClean into space. A rare Irish attack, and he wins a corner off Spahic. They 
don’t rush to take the set piece. It’s cleared easily enough, but the ball 
breaks to Hendrick, 30 yards out. He attempts to lob Begovic. Ambitious is the 
best thing we can say about it. The ball drifts off to the right, and the free 
players either side of Hendrick launch an internal debate.

64 min: A simple belt down the middle of the park exposes the Irish defence. 
Lulic and Dzeko swarm around Coleman, who holds his nerve rather magnificently 
as he brings the ball down from the sky then plays it away from trouble. The 
smallest misjudgement there, a little miscontrol, andBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> were away. As calm as 
you like from the Everton star.

62 min: This game is slowly morphing into attack versus defence. Ireland are 
sitting very deep, with the visitors enjoying most of the possession. They’ve 
not created too much as of yet, but you know how these things often pan out. 
The Aviva is a cauldron of nerves as a result.

59 min: McClean is booked for a fairly agricultural shove in the back of 
Vranjes, who was making good down the right. The free kick, right on the corner 
of the area by the byline, is pulled back for Pjanic on the penalty spot. 
Pjanic snaps a shot away first time, but it smacks Coleman in the face. Brave 
closing down there. Ireland clear the danger.

57 min: Zukanovic goes up to make a fairly simple header, but loses his 
bearings and allows the ball to smack into his upper arm. He can’t really 
complain this time. A completely needless free kick, 25 yards out, in a fairly 
central position. Brady takes it, and can you guess what he does with it? Yep: 
he smacks it straight into the first white shirt he can see. His delivery has 
been nothing short of appalling tonight.

54 min: Vranjes slides a delicious ball down the right to release Visca. He’s 
past Brady, and reaches the byline. His pull back finds Lulic on the right-hand 
corner of the six-yard box. He should trouble Randolph, but fluffs his shot. A 
very decent chance spurned.

52 min: Randolph sends a kick straight down the field and into the arms of 
Begovic. With his team under some pressure, and chasing shadows at the moment, 
he needs to be doing better with his distribution than that.

50 min: Hendrick palms Visca to the floor, just to the right of the Irish box. 
Free kick. Medunjanin teases a high one towards the far post. Dzeko rises, but 
the ball is deflected away by McCarthy’s eyebrows. It nearly flies into the top 
left. But it’s over the bar. Just. Corner, which is cleared easily enough. But 
it’s clear the visitors aren’t going to get knocked out wondering. They’re 
coming at the Irish with some force here.
 A dangerous free-kick from Medunjanin is headed just over the bar.

49 min: Visca has a dig from the edge of the area, but succeeds only in 
belting the ball against Dzeko. Meanwhile here comes karma policeman Matt Dony: 
“With any luck, sometime in the next 10 years or so,Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> will qualify for a 
major tournament through play-offs at the expense of France, all due to a 
controversial hand-ball decision. And the circle will be complete.”

47 min: Bosnia-Herzegovina are on the front foot early doors. Visca makes an 
almost immediate burst down the right but is brushed off the ball with purpose 
by Brady. Medunjanin then makes it two poor shots from two in this game: in 
space down the right, and with options, he decides to fire low towards the 
bottom-right corner. Randolph could have flung a cap on it.

And we're off again!

The visitors get the ball rolling for the second half. They need an equaliser 
to force extra time: 1-1 is the only result that’d lead to an extra 30 minutes, 
and possible penalty kicks. They’ve made a change, bringing on Everton’s 
Muhamed Besic for Cocalic.

HALF TIME: Republic of Ireland 1-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina (agg: 2-1)

And that’s that for the first 45. A ludicrous penalty decision, but the Irish 
are probably due a bit of hand-ball luck in major-tournament play-offs.
Bosnia-Herzegovina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> 
will feel aggrieved, but then they’ve done precious little up front so far, and 
would be going out anyway. Ireland are 45 minutes away from Euro 2016!
 Martin O’Neill will be happy so far though Bosnia-Herzegovina started to 
threaten towards the end of that half. Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock

43 min: The hapless Spahic bangs into the back of Walters as the pair contest 
a high ball, in the middle of theBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> half. Not worthy of a 
yellow in itself, but he’ll be undone by the totting-up procedure soon. Brady’s 
free kick, with the box loaded, proves yet another risible nonsense. “Has 
Steven Gerrard been coaching the Irish on free-kicks and corners in his 
off-season?” wonders Justin Kavanagh.

41 min: Hendrick, in space down the left, floats a lovely high ball into the 
middle towards Murphy. The striker rises with a view to powering home his 
first-ever international goal. But Begovic rises higher, and smoothly claims 
with one hand. Fine football all round.

37 min: Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> are enjoying the 
lion’s share of possession, but doing very little with it. A lot of sterile 
nonsense in the middle of the park. Ireland harass and harry, and seem happy 
enough with the way the match is going so far.

A wonderful atmosphere in the Aviva Stadium, as Ireland win the second leg of 
a major-championship play-off for the first time! They deserved that result, 
because while the visitors enjoyed the lion’s share of possession, they were 
undone by rope-a-dope tactics. Ireland soaked up the pressure, conceded very 
few real chances, and put theirs away when they arrived. The penalty in the 
first half may have been farcical, but the result was secured in the second, so 
controversy doesn’t come into it. Ultimately, Ireland are the deserved victors 
in this play-off, and will be joining theEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> party! Magnificent scenes.

90 min +2: Another free kick to the visitors, this time in the middle of the 
Irish half. Everyone in the box. The ball drops to Ibisevic, on the left-hand 
side of the six-yard box. Leaning back, he lashes a hell of a shot past 
Randolph ... and onto the crossbar! So unlucky! But it’s too little, too late. 
Dzeko and Djuric are booked for some moaning after the ball goes out of play.
 
90 min +1: The clock ticks by without incident. The crowd in full voice. It’s 
on!
 
90 min: Walters, on a hat-trick, tries to complete it from the halfway line. 
Eh, no. Whelan is replaced by O’Shea. And a mere three additional minutes stand 
between Ireland and Euro 2016!
 
89 min: Some McClean clumsiness leads to yet another free kick for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> 
out on the right. Needless pressure on his own team, but Randolph calms 
everyone down with a confident jump and claim.
 
88 min: A free kick for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> on the halfway line. 
Besic hoicks it straight out of play for a goal kick. That’s amused the home 
support.
 
87 min: A high ball into the Irish box leads to another Bosnian corner on the 
left. From the set piece, a massive playground scramble in the six-yard box. 
Someone should slam it home, really. Dzeko, perhaps, in the middle of it all. 
But the ball bobbles into the arms of Randolph. If they can’t get a shot on 
target from that, it’s not going to happen for them.
 
85 min: Corner for the visitors down the left. It’s whipped to the near post, 
where Walters and Spahic compete. The referee signals for another corner, then 
changes his mind. One way and another, the referee has been hopeless tonight. 
But for all the controversy over the penalty decision, his bungling doesn’t 
look to have made any difference.Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> haven’t scored.
 
83 min: Long, going up for a high ball with Zukanovic, flicks a kick into the 
side of his opponent. It threatens to kick off, and Zukanovic is livid, but the 
referee shows only yellow.
 
82 min: Walters is back. Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> can’t get anything 
going.
 
81 min: Walters is down getting some attention for ailments minor. The clock 
is Ireland’s friend.
 
80 min: Lulic is replaced by Ibisevic.
 
78 min: A throw deep in Irish territory. Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> knock it around in 
pretty triangles. Then Lulic embarks on a skitter into the area. He shapes to 
shoot, but Coleman spreads himself to block. Corner on the left, from which 
Randolph rises highest to punch clear with confidence.
 
76 min: Besic, from out on the right, swings one high and long towards Djuric. 
Randolph rises and claims rather magnificently.

Mohan/Sportsfile/Corbis  
75 min: Coleman bashes a clearance down the right. The pointless Spahic should 
mop it up, but he miscontrols and allows Long, on his shoulder, to tear clear 
on goal! Long’s never quite got the ball under control, though, and with 
Begovic coming off his line, bobbles a poor shot wide left of the goal. That 
would have been that.
 
73 min: Brady very nearly releases Long down the inside-left channel, but 
there’s a bit too much juice on the ball and Begovic comes to the edge of his 
area to claim. The Aviva is in full voice right now.
 
71 min: Visca comes zipping down the right yet again. If there’s one player 
who doesn’t deserve to lose, after his performance over the two legs, it’s this 
lad. But his cross is smacked clear from the waiting Djuric by Clark.

Finally Brady delivers something special! The free kick, 35 yards out on the 
left, drops into the six-yard box. Vranjes, at full stretch, looks to hook away 
from danger, but succeeds only in guiding the ball to Walters, on the 
right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Walters creams it into the right-hand 
portion of the net, and Ireland are so close to theEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> finals now!

Martin Rickett/PA  
69 min: Medunjanin makes way for Djuric. When the game restarts, Spahic gets 
himself involved once again in nonsense, sticking a high boot into Walters’ 
trouser arrangement. That really should be a second yellow card. The referee’s 
had a shocker. But no matter! Because...
 
68 min: A free kick for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina>, 25 yards out on the 
right. A chance to load the box. Medunjanin curls it in carefully, but it’s 
battered clear by the head of Clark. Randolph hasn’t had to make a serious save 
yet.

Cahill/ActionPlus/Corbis  
66 min: Hendrick sprays a lovely long ball down the left wing to release 
McClean into space. A rare Irish attack, and he wins a corner off Spahic. They 
don’t rush to take the set piece. It’s cleared easily enough, but the ball 
breaks to Hendrick, 30 yards out. He attempts to lob Begovic. Ambitious is the 
best thing we can say about it. The ball drifts off to the right, and the free 
players either side of Hendrick launch an internal debate.
 
64 min: A simple belt down the middle of the park exposes the Irish defence. 
Lulic and Dzeko swarm around Coleman, who holds his nerve rather magnificently 
as he brings the ball down from the sky then plays it away from trouble. The 
smallest misjudgement there, a little miscontrol, andBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> were away. As calm as 
you like from the Everton star.

62 min: This game is slowly morphing into attack versus defence. Ireland are 
sitting very deep, with the visitors enjoying most of the possession. They’ve 
not created too much as of yet, but you know how these things often pan out. 
The Aviva is a cauldron of nerves as a result.
 
59 min: McClean is booked for a fairly agricultural shove in the back of 
Vranjes, who was making good down the right. The free kick, right on the corner 
of the area by the byline, is pulled back for Pjanic on the penalty spot. 
Pjanic snaps a shot away first time, but it smacks Coleman in the face. Brave 
closing down there. Ireland clear the danger.
 
57 min: Zukanovic goes up to make a fairly simple header, but loses his 
bearings and allows the ball to smack into his upper arm. He can’t really 
complain this time. A completely needless free kick, 25 yards out, in a fairly 
central position. Brady takes it, and can you guess what he does with it? Yep: 
he smacks it straight into the first white shirt he can see. His delivery has 
been nothing short of appalling tonight.
 
55 min: Ireland make a double change. Out go Hoolahan and Murphy. In come 
McClean and - to great cheers - Long.
 
54 min: Vranjes slides a delicious ball down the right to release Visca. He’s 
past Brady, and reaches the byline. His pull back finds Lulic on the right-hand 
corner of the six-yard box. He should trouble Randolph, but fluffs his shot. A 
very decent chance spurned.
 
52 min: Randolph sends a kick straight down the field and into the arms of 
Begovic. With his team under some pressure, and chasing shadows at the moment, 
he needs to be doing better with his distribution than that.
 
50 min: Hendrick palms Visca to the floor, just to the right of the Irish box. 
Free kick. Medunjanin teases a high one towards the far post. Dzeko rises, but 
the ball is deflected away by McCarthy’s eyebrows. It nearly flies into the top 
left. But it’s over the bar. Just. Corner, which is cleared easily enough. But 
it’s clear the visitors aren’t going to get knocked out wondering. They’re 
coming at the Irish with some force here.

49 min: Visca has a dig from the edge of the area, but succeeds only in 
belting the ball against Dzeko. Meanwhile here comes karma policeman Matt Dony: 
“With any luck, sometime in the next 10 years or so,Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> will qualify for a 
major tournament through play-offs at the expense of France, all due to a 
controversial hand-ball decision. And the circle will be complete.”

McQuillan/Getty Images  
47 min: Bosnia-Herzegovina are on the front foot early doors. Visca makes an 
almost immediate burst down the right but is brushed off the ball with purpose 
by Brady. Medunjanin then makes it two poor shots from two in this game: in 
space down the right, and with options, he decides to fire low towards the 
bottom-right corner. Randolph could have flung a cap on it.
 
The visitors get the ball rolling for the second half. They need an equaliser 
to force extra time: 1-1 is the only result that’d lead to an extra 30 minutes, 
and possible penalty kicks. They’ve made a change, bringing on Everton’s 
Muhamed Besic for Cocalic.
 
Half-time RTÉ advertisements: This selection really gets going around the 
one-minute mark. “Are clouds of doubt hanging over your livestock?”
 
And that’s that for the first 45. A ludicrous penalty decision, but the Irish 
are probably due a bit of hand-ball luck in major-tournament play-offs.
Bosnia-Herzegovina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> 
will feel aggrieved, but then they’ve done precious little up front so far, and 
would be going out anyway. Ireland are 45 minutes away from Euro 2016!
 Martin O’Neill will be happy so far though Bosnia-Herzegovina started to 
threaten towards the end of that half. Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock  
45 min: Begovic hits long. Dzeko doesn’t win his header. The visitors really 
need to hear the half-time whistle, and think up a few new ideas.
 
43 min: The hapless Spahic bangs into the back of Walters as the pair contest 
a high ball, in the middle of theBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> half. Not worthy of a 
yellow in itself, but he’ll be undone by the totting-up procedure soon. Brady’s 
free kick, with the box loaded, proves yet another risible nonsense. “Has 
Steven Gerrard been coaching the Irish on free-kicks and corners in his 
off-season?” wonders Justin Kavanagh.
 
41 min: Hendrick, in space down the left, floats a lovely high ball into the 
middle towards Murphy. The striker rises with a view to powering home his 
first-ever international goal. But Begovic rises higher, and smoothly claims 
with one hand. Fine football all round.

39 min: Visca delivers a teasing cross into the Irish box from the right. 
Dzeko is nowhere to be seen.Then Vranjes hits another one from that wing, to 
the far stick. Keogh cedes no ground to Lulic.
 
37 min: Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> are enjoying the 
lion’s share of possession, but doing very little with it. A lot of sterile 
nonsense in the middle of the park. Ireland harass and harry, and seem happy 
enough with the way the match is going so far.
