Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

After many years working for the same large company in a technical capacity on 
a small team, the management has finally formalised my job spec and advertised 
the role. I applied for it along with a more junior colleague.

Although I have vast experience and I have been doing this job for nearly 30 
years, the post was given to my colleague. There are lots of possible reasons – 
he is cheaper, toes the line (unlike me), interviewed better. (No surprise, as 
this was my first interview for 30 years!)

I get on very well with my colleague and do not grudge him the job one bit, 
but I am in a dilemma. He regularly comes to me for help and advice as he does 
not have my technical experience. How do I proceed now he has been promoted 
above me? Do I say “sorry but I can no longer offer the help I have in the 
past”, or do I continue to help him and simply lump the fact that he is getting 
remuneration off my back?

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a 
brief email todear.jeremy@theguardian.com <mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com>.
