Following Castro’s death, perhaps we can now acknowledge the role that 
British-made aircraft played in defendingCuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> from the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs 
invasion. The Cuban Air Force Hawker Sea Furies were instrumental in preventing 
the full invasion force from landing, which was the last time Sea Furies were 
ever used in action. A remaining plane is displayed at the Bay of Pigs Museo 
Giron.

• “British remainers must be EU reformers,” writes Martin Kettle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stop-brexit-remainers> 
(2 December). We all saw what David Cameron’s fundamental reform effort came up 
with. The EU isn’t reformable. And does he seriously think that the EU will 
take a blind bit of notice of us once we’ve crawled back?

• John Redwood writes “when we have our own fishing policy we could move back 
to being net exporters” (Opinion, 1 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/plan-brexit-austerity-voters-spending-money-chancellor>
). Easy to see the holes in that.

• Shirazeh Houshiary put a Christmas tree upside down in the Tate Britain 
stairwell, painted the roots gold and designated it “art” (Front-page picture, 
2 December). ObviouslyTate Britain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain> has a colony of cats. 
I’ve always understood the reason for hanging Christmas trees from the ceiling 
is to stop cats climbing into the branches.

• My experience was rather different from Chris Seidel (Letters, 1 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/30/fiery-riposte-put-paid-to-guardian-reading-habit>
). It was my first wife who hid behind the Guardian at the breakfast table. I 
had the temerity to suggest she might share the newspaper. Her hands moved from 
the sides of the paper to the top, either side of the centre fold. She tore the 
paper in two and handed me one half. We separated, like the newspaper, shortly 
afterwards. Great style, though.

• Saturday’s Guardian is a great disappointment as there is no Suguru. Please 
find a little corner. I really, really miss it.
