WINNING TIP: La Casa de François, San Agustín, Colombia

François, an architect from the Alps, stopped off in San Agustín on a 
motorbike journey from Mexico to Patagonia 19 years ago. He liked what he saw, 
bought a coffee plantation and designed and built an eco-friendly hideaway 
using sustainable anti-seismic materials like bamboo. Home-grown organic coffee 
is still served at the hostelry on a hill overlooking this pretty, historic 
town, and close to theParque Arqueológico 
<http://www.sanagustin-huila.gov.co/index.shtml> where there are 100s of 
pre-Colombian statues.

 Casa Los Molles 
Casa Los Molles, Tilcara, Jujuy
Casa Los Molles overlooks the hills of Quebrada de Humahuaca, near the amazing 
rock formations of Purmamarca and the Argentinian salt flats. A converted house 
run and owned by Diego and his friends, there is a vegetable garden, from which 
they pick veggies each day to make amazingly tasty but cheap food – they even 
have a vegetarian menu. The guys will try to help with any problem or query, 
although they're not fluent in English. There's an area for a bonfire and you 
can buy alcohol or bring your own; marvel at the fantastic murals, which cover 
four of thehostal's walls.

 Beach at Vila do Abraão, Ilha Grande. Photograph: Alamy 
Pousada Tapera das Palmas, Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro state 
Unlike most of the accommodation on the stunning Ilha Grande, which is 
clustered in the tourist-packed port of Vila da Abraão, thispousada (as it's 
called in Brazil) sits with a single neighbour on an isolated beach across the 
island. Yes, this means it's a pain to get to and from – a 45-minute trek in 
the thick heat or a choppy boat ride. Yes, the owners are slightly eccentric 
and the service is patchy. But it's cheap and you get to sip generous 
caipirinhas on a perfect beach shared with a just a few locals, which is surely 
the whole point of being there. Paradise.

 Aquabarra 
Aquabarra, Búzios, Rio de Janeiro state 
Fantastic boutique pousada near to (probably) the best beach in Búzios with a 
lovely hippyish, calm feel and a fantastic buffet breakfast on the eclectic 
terrace. Family-owned and run, it even has a mini spa, with free treatments 
available. Wonderful returning back after an evening meal to the honesty bar 
and music chosen by the guests, sitting on the beautiful veranda near to the 
pool, listening to the sea. Have been twice and will return!

 Hostal Maria Casa 
Hostal Maria Casa, La Serena, Coquimbo
In La Serena on the Chilean coast, Maria and "Pancho" run a lovely little 
guesthouse-cum-leather workshop from their family home. The rooms are basic, 
but the hospitality is warm, there's a delightful garden and it's in a good 
location near the bus station. La Serena is a quiet town, near a number of 
observatories offering stargazing in the Atacama desert – an incredible 
experience which was certainly one of the highlights of my South American 
experience. Thoroughly recommended.

Ritoque Raices, Valparaíso
Playa de Ritoque is 10km of relatively untouched coastline, hidden by vast 
rolling dunes. Ritoque Raices is nestled among the foliage with commanding 
views of the beautiful beach, popular with local surfers. I arrived on foot, 
unable to find the accommodation. I then watched a lone local surfer ride a 
wave all the way in, pick up his board and jog up the beach towards me. The 
hostel owner greeted me and led me to the building, a mix of comfortable 
doubles and dorms. Gorgeous sunsets, accompanied by fresh barbecued fish and 
localpisco make this a tranquil getaway that is only a one hour bus journey 
north of Valparaíso. Horse riding and sea-kayaking also possible. It is a 
wonderful place to spend a few days.

Posada del Parque, Ritoque, Valparaíso
With or without a car, it's necessary to travel along Valparaíso's stunningly 
dramatic coastline to get to Posada del Parque, set in the national reserves 
surrounding Ritoque. Looking out over the glittering flats of the wetlands and 
the surreal undulating flow of the giant sand dunes, this posada is a peaceful 
retreat (the sound of the Pacific is also therapeutic). Activities range from 
kayaking to yoga, although the best way to admire the scenery is on horseback. 
Make sure you don't miss the sunsets and the evening barbecues hosted by owners 
Osvaldo and Monica.

 El Capullo 
El Capullo, Colonia de Sacramento, Río de la Plata 
El Capullo is just as cool as it appears on the website: a restored colonial 
house in a beautiful tree-lined, cobbled street in a quaint little town. The 
Anglo-American owners, Tom & Kelli, fired up the barbecue for us as we chatted 
with them into the wee hours, swapping Latin American adventure stories. The 
back garden is idyllic and has a pool and lovely shady trees. The posada is 
modern on the inside and full of the owners' collection of artwork.

 Posada al Sur 
Posada al Sur, Montevideo
Not much to look at on the outside but within, a haven of tranquillity and 
comfort in a beautiful old house with lovely communal areas and a roof terrace. 
It's in the old town, a short walk from the ferry terminal to Buenos Aires and 
to the city centre. If you love meat, head to theparilla restaurants in the 
Mercado del Puerto on a Saturday.

Venezuela

Casa Sol, Mérida 
An amazing posada in the centre of Mérida, the most chilled-out city in 
Venezuela. With paragliding, walking and climbing in the Andes a short trip 
from the city, there's loads to do. The design of the posada is beautiful, with 
internal courtyards and a tropical garden behind. Breakfast ofarepas 
(flatbreads) with local cheeses and fresh juices is served in the garden, eaten 
to the sound of hummingbirds up in the trees above your head.
