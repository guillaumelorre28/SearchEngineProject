Alex Gibney isn’t just one of America’s most prolific documentary makers, he’s 
also one of the best. He’s taken on whistleblowers (We Steal Secrets: The Story 
of Wikileaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/14/we-steal-secrets-wikileaks-review>
), corporate corruption (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/30/philipfrench3>) and the war on 
terror (Taxi to the Dark Side 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/15/culture.review>), for which he 
won an Oscar for best documentary.Esquire has described him as “becoming the 
most important documentarian of our time”.

Exploring the murky terrain between truth and lies has become something of a 
speciality (he’d finished a film on Lance Armstrong’s comeback when revelations 
about his doping finally came out. Gibney went back and remade the entire 
film). It’s a skill that comes to the fore again in his latest work, which 
turns its attention to the Church ofScientology 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology>, described by the New York Times
 as “maybe his most perfect subject yet”.

Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-going-clear-scientology-documentary-alex-gibney>
 is a forensic examination of the religion invented wholesale by the science 
fiction writer L Ron Hubbard, 50 years ago. Gibney doesn’t just dwell on the 
wackier elements (Thetans, a galactic overlord called Xenu, humans frozen 75m 
years ago and dropped into volcanoes) but on the very human stories at the 
heart of it: why perfectly ordinary people (and not so ordinary people, like 
Tom Cruise and John Travolta) have been drawn to it. Using the eyewitness 
accounts of former high-ranking officials from within the church and previously 
unseen archive footage, he builds a picture of a powerful, multinational 
organisation that controls its followers through abuse and fear – and takes on 
all critics. The film is being released in the UK this week despite legal 
attempts by the church to prevent it.

So, what first sparked your interest in Scientology?
I’d just finished a film on sex abuse, clerical sex abuse in the Catholic 
church, calledMea Maxima Culpa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/17/mea-maxima-culpa-review>, and I’d 
been thinking about these issues of faith and belief and also corruption, 
specifically noble-cause corruption, where the end justifies the means. I was 
thinking about some of these issues and thenLarry Wright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/29/scientology-lawrence-wright-going-clear>
 sent me his book [Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/14/cant-read-scientology-book-uk>
]. I’d been offered an opportunity to do a Scientology film in the past, and 
turned it down. But when I read Larry’s book I felt I had to do it, because it 
was about some of those ideas I’d been thinking about already. And Larry’s 
focus on this notion of the prison of belief was very powerful. A lot of stuff 
on Scientology in the past had been very focused on the wacky stuff and 
neglected the broader context.

One of the things that comes across very powerfully in the film is how 
credible and normal the people you interview are… and yet were involved with 
Scientology for years. Was that something you found difficult to get your head 
round at first?
Yes, it was. And I spent more time than I would have thought asking them about 
how they got into it. Because I was so impressed with them as people and I was 
curious to know what led them there in the first place. And then also what it 
was that broke their faith. They were these really interesting, vital, 
discerning people and it kind of turned my head around. I think there is a 
tendency in all of us to think, “I would never do something like that, how 
could people be so stupid?” And by spending time with these folks, it seemed 
very evident that any of us could have gone there under the right circumstances.

One of your interviewees is Paul Haggis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/paul-haggis-interview>, who’s an 
almost exact peer to you in that you’re both Oscar-winning film-makers. [Haggis 
wrote and produced Million DollarBaby and directed 2004’s Crash.] Was there any 
sense of his story being a kind of parallel journey?
So we’re both bald and wear glasses. But yes, I think so. I was a bit amazed 
that he kind of practised this cognitive dissonance for so long. But the more I 
talked, the more I kind of understood it. I think he himself deeply regrets it 
now, but there’s this idea that you can imagine yourself to be an embattled 
outsider and that that gives you a sort of moral basis on which to deny any 
attacks on you or your religion.

There does seem to be the essential difficulty of grappling with any 
understanding of Scientology. From the outside, so many of its central tenets 
seem preposterous. But then the people who are inside it obviously do have 
these beliefs, and have found something of worth to them, haven’t they?
They have. But then there’s a lot of things about, say, Christianity, that I 
think many Christians, if pressed, would probably conclude were more resonant 
as metaphor than reality, like the virgin birth. But still they accept the idea 
and move forward. Scientology does not explain its cosmology or origin story to 
a member until that person has been in for many years. Scientology attracts you 
with a very simple form of therapy that can be immediately appealing, and 
doesn’t threaten any of your other beliefs. They say, “It’s an applied 
philosophy and here are some tools to make your life better.” No one’s going 
argue with that. And then the next thing you know, you are spending thousands 
of dollars moving up the bridge to total freedom and reading – as a sacred text 
– L Ron Hubbard’s tales about body thetans, prison planets and Xenu the 
galactic overlord.

Isn’t that the thing? That lots of religions have outlandish creation myths, 
but they’re older and originated in pre-modern times. Whereas, the idea that a 
grown adult is going to buy the idea that people were frozen 75m years ago and 
then shot up into space in rockets and dropped into volcanoes is quite 
something, isn’t it?
Yes, it seems preposterous on the face of it. But I think one of the things 
that the film tries to do is to show how you slowly slide into that. By the 
time you find out about the Xenu story, I think people like Paul Haggis think, 
“Oh well, whatever this crazy stuff is, I’m still getting something out of the 
auditing [a talking therapy] and now I know all these people.” You’re part of a 
community. And it has its whole own language. I talked to some Scientologists 
who had only recently left and I needed a translator to talk to them, because 
they were so steeped in the language of Scientology. Which I think is very 
purposeful. It gives you a sense of character and identity that is very hard to 
give up.

What is striking in the film is the bravery of the people who have spoken out 
against Scientology. It’s been so effective in silencing critics, hasn’t it? 
One of the interviewees, Mike Rinder, had to give up his entire family when he 
left, didn’t he?
Yes, and another had to make a Sophie’s choice. She had to pick one of her 
children over the other. Scientology is one of the few religions that doesn’t 
allow you to escape, that tries to do everything it can to prevent you from 
escaping. If you’re a Catholic and you decide one day you’re not going to mass, 
the priest doesn’t usually show up at your house, or the house of your 
relatives, and persuade them to “disconnect” from you. But in Scientology, they 
really go after you pretty hard.

Church of Scientology targets film critics over Going Clear documentary

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/church-of-scientology-attacks-film-critics-going-clear-documentary>
Did you think long and hard about doing the film? You must have known that 
they’d come after you…
Yes, I did. I knew they would. So yes, I had to think long and hard about 
whether or not to take it on. But a lot of my films have been about abuses of 
power, and I didn’t see why I should steer away from this one.

So it was no great surprise when they did come after you? That they’ve done 
things like setting up a website to try to slur your reputation, and your 
father’s reputation even. [They have claimed that Gibney’s father, a 
journalist, worked undercover for the CIA.]
No, and I’m perfectly happy to guide people to [these websites] because I 
think there are some ridiculous ones. On freedommag.org for example, you’ll 
find they vilify me, my dad and everybody who’s in the film. And they are still 
calling up colleagues and trying to get them to talk dirt about me. It’s a 
campaign that still goes on. The number of legal letters threatening me, 
threatening HBO and the distributors and exhibitors in every single one of the 
territories has been staggering.

Wright – review

And in the UK, they’ve had some success, haven’t they? They quashed the 
publication ofLawrence Wright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/02/going-clear-scientology-wright-review>
’s book two years ago, didn’t they?
My understanding about that is that it was a risk/reward calculation done by 
the publishers. They didn’t feel that the commercial success of the book would 
warrant the legal fees that they would have to undertake. Which to me is a very 
small-minded and shortsighted view, but it’s the accountant’s view and the 
lawyer’s view. It was a business decision, and Lawrence Wright’s book has still 
not been published in the UK, Canada or Australia.

They’ve also been sending out legal letters, haven’t they, to Sky, the UK 
distributor?
To Sky. To the [Oscars] academy. To Sundance. To everyone. They come after 
you. Particularly in the UK, because the libel laws are not as friendly to the 
press as they are in the States. If you were to accuse me of libel in America, 
there’d be a discovery process and I don’t think David Miscavige [the head of 
the Church of Scientology] orTom Cruise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise> want to put themselves in front of 
a skilled lawyer to answer questions about the Church of Scientology.

David Miscavige and Tom Cruise really come across as these very powerful, 
charismatic figures right at the heart of everything. Don’t they?
Yes. They’re very much at the heart of Scientology. I think David Miscavige 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/jul/08/profile-david-miscavige-scientology>
 is a true believer, but he’s also ruthless. If there was ever an example of an 
organisation run with an iron fist, singlehandedly, by a ruthless individual, 
it’s Scientology.

And Tom Cruise is so tightly bound up in it, isn’t he? The highest-paid movie 
star in the world… did you get to the bottom of what the great attraction is 
for him of Scientology?
I think he’s a true believer. I think there’s probably a sense of jeopardy, 
were he ever to become a critic, because they have so much on him, but I think 
he is very much a true believer. And I know actors and writers who’ve been on 
the receiving end of his prophesying. So he’s all in, I don’t doubt that for 
one second. And, I think that he knows it’s at some sacrifice to his career and 
he is very invested in being a movie star.

In the film, it’s suggested that he is in such a position of power that he 
could look into these abuses of power or demand reform. And the fact that he 
hasn’t, you think…
It’s appalling. He could stop a lot of this abuse but he chooses not to.

Scientology has been incredibly clever in harnessing the power of celebrity. 
Is it the ultimate American religion in some respects?
Yes. And also the fact that it was invented by somebody who’s looking to make 
a buck. That is a classic American plan.L Ron Hubbard 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard> invented the whole thing. He was 
a science fiction writer who invented a religion to make money. But America is 
a land of self-invention and reinvention, and Hubbard is a classic example of 
that. And he really understood the power of celebrity in America.

In the film, you made the point that the numbers of active members is going 
down, but the church’s financial assets keep going up and up.
It’s dying as a religion, but as a business, it is thriving. And I think they 
will continue to be powerful because money buys you lawyers. And lawyers can 
threaten you and it can have a chilling impact.

You’ve had this incredibly prolific career, and you’ve taken on these big 
subjects - Enron, the war on terror, Wikileaks. Do you see your film on 
Scientology as part of an arc? A lot of your films have reflected upon the 
state of modern America. Is this a continuation of that?
People have pointed out a pattern, though I wasn’t entirely conscious of it. 
I’m interested in abuses of power and deception, and self-deception. And how 
for many people the ends justify the means. America is a land of extremes and 
Scientology represents that in a way. It’s a self-help religion, but it’s also 
a corporation, a brutal and abusive place.

You have two more films about to be released, one on Steve Jobs and another 
about Frank Sinatra – two more extraordinary, successful individuals. What’s the
Alex Gibney <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alex-gibney> secret to success? 
You’re incredibly productive.
I’m insane. All these films take a long time but I do a number of them in 
tandem, and I work with very talented people. That’s something I learned from 
Steve Jobs. Surround yourself with really talented people.
