Two pieces of brilliance from Zlatan Ibrahimovic did the damage, and Sweden 
deserved that even if they had that wobble at the end.Denmark had started 
strongly, hitting the bar, but lost their way after the first goal and did not 
really carve too much else out until Poulsen’s header. If the match had been 
five minutes longer when Vestergaard’s goal may have made things a little more 
tense, but it feels like the right outcome over two legs – if a sad end for 
Morten Olsen, who is a legend in Danish football.Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> have done it!


And so have Ukraine, who gritted it out in Slovenia and eventually won 3-1 on 
aggregate. That’s ourEuro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> 
lineup complete! Hope you’ve enjoyed this, and our previous coverage. Goodnight!

90+2 min: Hojbjerg misses a big chance to give us an exciting final minute or 
so! It’s laid on to him 15 yards out and he really should score, but tries to 
measure his finish a little too much and it slides wide!

Goal! Denmark 2-2 Sweden (Vestergaard 90+1)

The substitute, who came on a few minutes ago as an auxiliary striker (he’s 
normally a centre back), powers in a superb header from Eriksen’s corner. 
Respectability on the night, but with only three added minutes it won’t be 
enough.

86 min: Rasmussen turns onto a right-sided cross and goes down under 
Granqvist’s attentions. He seeks a penalty, and Granqvist did seem to be 
tugging his hand, but the fall was too dramatic to do him many favours.

Goal! Denmark 1-2 Sweden (Poulsen 81, 4-2 agg)

Durmisi has got forward well all night and this is probably his best cross, 
attacked well at the far post by Poulsen and headed into the far corner.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> still need three so it counts 
for very little.

80 min: A lazy cliche or two coming out from the commentary team about 
Ibrahimovic’s desire levels. We’re all body language experts, aren’t we? And, 
of course, we all went to school with Zlatan.

Goal! Denmark 0-2 Sweden (Ibrahimovic 76)

That is punishment enough! Oh, what a goal that is. The free kick is to the 
right of centre and 25 yards out. Ibrahimovic steps up and it’s just perfect – 
up, over, round, with enough bend and pace and dip to beat any goalkeeper in 
the world. 2-0, and Sweden will play atEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>. That was brilliant.

76 min: Agger could be in trouble here ... he barges Forsberg over as he looks 
to get onto a header over the top, and wouldn’t Forsberg have been through on 
goal if it hadn’t been for that? I think Agger is lucky not to receive greater 
punishment than a 25-yard free kick there.

74 min: If European Championships were contested by the 16 (sorry – 24!) best 
sets of fans,Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> would have a 
free pass every time. I remember how fun their travelling thousands were in 
Kiev in 2012, colonising the island in the middle of the city. I’m sure there 
will be more of the same in France – if they can see out another 20 minutes or 
so.

73 min: Denmark so close to a lifeline! Agger throws another long one and it 
bobbles up for Eriksen 12 yards out – you’d put your house on him scoring from 
there but it strikes Larsson and deflects just away from goal!

67 min: Durmisi remains a useful outlet on the left but his latest cross is 
too high for Poulsen.Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are 
the definition of huff and puff here – it’s really hard to see them scoring, 
let alone twice.

63 min: Corner to the Danes, which Eriksen puts in towards the near post. 
Ibrahimovic “of all people!!!” back there to head away for another, and then 
heads the second flag kick well clear. Good defensive work by the striker.

56 min: That’s better though, as Durmisi crosses sharply towards Jorgensen and 
it’s only just headed away from him. They win another free kick inside the 
Swedish half, can they build a head of steam now? Krohn-Dehli has a 20-yarder 
well blocked by Granqvist as they try to assert themselves.

52 min: More danger from Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden>, 
as Berg nods a diagonal ball across the box with Lewicki – I think – lurking, 
and Agger has to clear hurriedly. Then, at the other end, a Jorgensen cross 
from the left is sliced inches wide of his own post by Johansson! Hojbjerg 
lashes over from the corner.

51 min: Lewicki, who was excellent for Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> in their victorious Uefa Under-21 
Championship campaign during the summer and has impressed here too, is heavily 
involved in some interplay down the right – which at some stage there involved 
a foul by Durmisi, who is booked by Atkinson.

Second half underway!

Michael Krohn-Dehli replaces Delaney, who had actually done well but I expect 
Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> need to go for broke now.

Still Slovenia 1-0 Ukraine in the other game. One more for the home side, 
without reply, would take them into extra time. Should that stay close and 
Den-Swe become insurmountable for the home team, I’ll give it a bit more 
billing here than at present.

Half-time: Denmark 0-1 Sweden (1-3 agg)

So the Danes have it all to do, and that’s thanks to a neatly improvised and 
completely against-the-run-of-play goal from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Denmark 
started like a train and hit the bar through a combination of Poulsen and 
Kallstrom, but have only huffed and puffed since. Sweden have had a couple of 
chances to put them out of sight, in the meantime. CanDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> find some incisiveness to claw 
this back? Don’t. Go. Anywhere.

45+1 min: For a second it looks as if Poulsen is in on the left side of the 
box, after a good Delaney ball, but his touch takes him away from goal and the 
chance goes.

44 min: That was an opening for Bendtner! Jacobsen crosses really well from 
deep on the right and Bendtner, unattended but perhaps put off by a defender 
jumping and missing in front of him, totally mistimes his header – it dribbles 
off his hand and away. Should have been more alert there, probably.

43 min: Agger has to clear from in front of goal again, this time facing in 
the right direction, as Larsson searches out the lurking Berg with a whipped 
cross from the right.

now is too hasty and Eriksen, who you would want to keep a cool head in this 
situation, is as guilty as anyone. Nothing is coming off; few of the decisions 
are the right ones.

40 min: Agger nearly imposes himself in the worst way possible! Ibrahimovic, 
in a real show of determination, sprints down the left to beat Jacobsen to a 
ball he had no right to win and then crosses low. Agger intervenes and, with 
Schmeichel committed, knocks the ball into the ground, into the air ... and 
*just* over his own crossbar.

39 min: Now a ball aims from Aggers over to Poulsen runs under the winger’s 
boot and out of play. I’m just not sure that, beyond the centre backs, this 
team is imposing enough to really stamp its authority here.

37 min: Denmark really do seem to have lost their cool. Durmisi tries to pass 
back to Schmeichel with his right foot but gets it all wrong and it goes out 
for a corner. This one from Kallstrom is deep to the far post, where 
Ibrahimovic wins the header but loops it to Schmeichel. Eriksen then wastes a 
swift counter with another bad cross.

35 min: A bit more pressure from Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> now, prompted by a 
solid-but-fair challenge from Agger on Larsson. It gets the crowd going but 
doesn’t inspire Bendtner to do much more than cross limply out of play.

33 min: Sweden finding a gap or two now and they win another right-sided 
corner. Same routine again? Nope – this time disappointing from Kallstrom and 
it’s hacked away at the near post.

31 min: Granqvist, once of Wigan of course, bundles through Jorgensen and it’s 
another free-kick, just about within Eriksen territory. HowDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> could do with something here ... 
and they come quite close to getting it, and Eriksen’s 30-yard effort bounces 
just in front of Isaksson and he has to parry wide. The corner comes to nothing.

28 min: That could have been that! Ibrahimovic is slid through inside the area 
on his left side, and has only Schmeichel to beat ... the angle isn’t perfect 
but you’d still back him, until the Leicester ‘keeper saves the day with his 
legs! Big moment?

26 min: And by the same token, another goal from Sweden would leave Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> needing four. It’d very much be 
game over then. No clincher just now though as, following a good passing move, 
Bengtsson slices his cross behind the goal.

Two pieces of brilliance from Zlatan Ibrahimovic did the damage, and Sweden 
deserved that even if they had that wobble at the end.Denmark had started 
strongly, hitting the bar, but lost their way after the first goal and did not 
really carve too much else out until Poulsen’s header. If the match had been 
five minutes longer when Vestergaard’s goal may have made things a little more 
tense, but it feels like the right outcome over two legs – if a sad end for 
Morten Olsen, who is a legend in Danish football.Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> have done it!


And so have Ukraine, who gritted it out in Slovenia and eventually won 3-1 on 
aggregate. That’s ourEuro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> 
lineup complete! Hope you’ve enjoyed this, and our previous coverage. Goodnight!

90+3 min: So it *will* finish 2-2, eh? Hmmm.
 
90+2 min: Hojbjerg misses a big chance to give us an exciting final minute or 
so! It’s laid on to him 15 yards out and he really should score, but tries to 
measure his finish a little too much and it slides wide!
 
The substitute, who came on a few minutes ago as an auxiliary striker (he’s 
normally a centre back), powers in a superb header from Eriksen’s corner. 
Respectability on the night, but with only three added minutes it won’t be 
enough.
 
88 min: Four against two for Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> but Ibrahimovic’s ball for 
Hiljemark is just overcooked and he is forced wide, with Krohn-Dehli clearing 
his cross.
 
87 min: Bengtsson goes off, Norwich’s Martin Olsson comes on at left-back.
 
86 min: Rasmussen turns onto a right-sided cross and goes down under 
Granqvist’s attentions. He seeks a penalty, and Granqvist did seem to be 
tugging his hand, but the fall was too dramatic to do him many favours.
 
84 min: Ukraine are holding on against Slovenia with 10 minutes left, and 
things are on hold there at the moment after flares were thrown onto the pitch. 
Just restarting now.
 
Durmisi has got forward well all night and this is probably his best cross, 
attacked well at the far post by Poulsen and headed into the far corner.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> still need three so it counts 
for very little.
 
81 min: Berg volleys an Ibrahimovic cross over. Then Larsson is replaced by 
Hiljemark.
 
80 min: A lazy cliche or two coming out from the commentary team about 
Ibrahimovic’s desire levels. We’re all body language experts, aren’t we? And, 
of course, we all went to school with Zlatan.
 
78 min: Can Ibrahimovic do exactly the same, just a couple of yards further 
out? Not this time, it’s wide. But it really doesn’t matter now.
 
That is punishment enough! Oh, what a goal that is. The free kick is to the 
right of centre and 25 yards out. Ibrahimovic steps up and it’s just perfect – 
up, over, round, with enough bend and pace and dip to beat any goalkeeper in 
the world. 2-0, and Sweden will play atEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>. That was brilliant.
 Ibrahimovic scores the second. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images  and 
celebrates. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images  
76 min: Agger could be in trouble here ... he barges Forsberg over as he looks 
to get onto a header over the top, and wouldn’t Forsberg have been through on 
goal if it hadn’t been for that? I think Agger is lucky not to receive greater 
punishment than a 25-yard free kick there.
 
74 min: If European Championships were contested by the 16 (sorry – 24!) best 
sets of fans,Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> would have a 
free pass every time. I remember how fun their travelling thousands were in 
Kiev in 2012, colonising the island in the middle of the city. I’m sure there 
will be more of the same in France – if they can see out another 20 minutes or 
so.
 
73 min: Denmark so close to a lifeline! Agger throws another long one and it 
bobbles up for Eriksen 12 yards out – you’d put your house on him scoring from 
there but it strikes Larsson and deflects just away from goal!
 
70 min: Seb Larsson is booked for a foul – not his first – on Durmisi.
 
69 min: It’s cleared. Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> 
applying some sustained pressure now but it’s little more intricate than cross 
after cross. Sweden now make a change: Gustav Svensson replaces the 
crossbar-striking Kallstrom in midfield.
 
68 min: Agger chucks in a long throw from the left and there’s some mild 
excitement as Rasmussen looks to latch onto the half-cleared ball butSweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> get it away. Then Lustig heads 
away a Krohn-Dehli cross, and moments later Bengtsson concedes a corner....
 
67 min: Durmisi remains a useful outlet on the left but his latest cross is 
too high for Poulsen.Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> are 
the definition of huff and puff here – it’s really hard to see them scoring, 
let alone twice.
 
64 min: You’d have to say that Sweden seem to have done a real job here – that 
goal came at the perfect time and has just killedDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark>, really.
 
63 min: Corner to the Danes, which Eriksen puts in towards the near post. 
Ibrahimovic “of all people!!!” back there to head away for another, and then 
heads the second flag kick well clear. Good defensive work by the striker.
 
62 min: Schmeichel is out sharply to beat Berg to a ball over the top. Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> retain a threat here.
 
61 min: Rasmussen replaces Bendtner, who I seem to remember once rubbished his 
abilities when the pair were Under-21s. He probably won’t offer much less than 
Bendtner did tonight...
 
60 min: Another Danish sub shortly – it’ll be the centre-forward Morten 
Rasmussen....
 
58 min: Bendtner gives chase to a Jorgensen ball down the right but Granqvist 
is quicker and halts him. Disappointing from Bendtner so far tonight – just 
hasn’t been a threat.
 
56 min: That’s better though, as Durmisi crosses sharply towards Jorgensen and 
it’s only just headed away from him. They win another free kick inside the 
Swedish half, can they build a head of steam now? Krohn-Dehli has a 20-yarder 
well blocked by Granqvist as they try to assert themselves.
 
55 min: Sweden looking pretty comfortable at the moment. Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> needed a strong opening to the 
half and haven’t really produced it.
 
52 min: More danger from Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden>, 
as Berg nods a diagonal ball across the box with Lewicki – I think – lurking, 
and Agger has to clear hurriedly. Then, at the other end, a Jorgensen cross 
from the left is sliced inches wide of his own post by Johansson! Hojbjerg 
lashes over from the corner.
 
51 min: Lewicki, who was excellent for Sweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> in their victorious Uefa Under-21 
Championship campaign during the summer and has impressed here too, is heavily 
involved in some interplay down the right – which at some stage there involved 
a foul by Durmisi, who is booked by Atkinson.
 
49 min: Morten Olsen barking out the odds from the touchline. If Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> don’t go through, he’ll be 
bringing a close to his 15-year tenure.
 
47 min: Early free-kick chance to Eriksen, but his ball into the box is poor 
again – far beyond Poulsen and into Isaksson’s arms.
 
Michael Krohn-Dehli replaces Delaney, who had actually done well but I expect 
Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> need to go for broke now.
 
Still Slovenia 1-0 Ukraine in the other game. One more for the home side, 
without reply, would take them into extra time. Should that stay close and 
Den-Swe become insurmountable for the home team, I’ll give it a bit more 
billing here than at present.
 
Dele Alli, who is going to be one of the world’s best midfielders, has put 
England 1-0 up against France with a lovely goal.Scott Murray will describe it

Ouch.
 
So the Danes have it all to do, and that’s thanks to a neatly improvised and 
completely against-the-run-of-play goal from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Denmark 
started like a train and hit the bar through a combination of Poulsen and 
Kallstrom, but have only huffed and puffed since. Sweden have had a couple of 
chances to put them out of sight, in the meantime. CanDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> find some incisiveness to claw 
this back? Don’t. Go. Anywhere.
 
45+1 min: For a second it looks as if Poulsen is in on the left side of the 
box, after a good Delaney ball, but his touch takes him away from goal and the 
chance goes.
 
44 min: That was an opening for Bendtner! Jacobsen crosses really well from 
deep on the right and Bendtner, unattended but perhaps put off by a defender 
jumping and missing in front of him, totally mistimes his header – it dribbles 
off his hand and away. Should have been more alert there, probably.
 
43 min: Agger has to clear from in front of goal again, this time facing in 
the right direction, as Larsson searches out the lurking Berg with a whipped 
cross from the right.
 
42 min: Everything from Denmark <https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> 
now is too hasty and Eriksen, who you would want to keep a cool head in this 
situation, is as guilty as anyone. Nothing is coming off; few of the decisions 
are the right ones.
 
40 min: Agger nearly imposes himself in the worst way possible! Ibrahimovic, 
in a real show of determination, sprints down the left to beat Jacobsen to a 
ball he had no right to win and then crosses low. Agger intervenes and, with 
Schmeichel committed, knocks the ball into the ground, into the air ... and 
*just* over his own crossbar.
 
39 min: Now a ball aims from Aggers over to Poulsen runs under the winger’s 
boot and out of play. I’m just not sure that, beyond the centre backs, this 
team is imposing enough to really stamp its authority here.
 
37 min: Denmark really do seem to have lost their cool. Durmisi tries to pass 
back to Schmeichel with his right foot but gets it all wrong and it goes out 
for a corner. This one from Kallstrom is deep to the far post, where 
Ibrahimovic wins the header but loops it to Schmeichel. Eriksen then wastes a 
swift counter with another bad cross.
 
35 min: A bit more pressure from Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> now, prompted by a 
solid-but-fair challenge from Agger on Larsson. It gets the crowd going but 
doesn’t inspire Bendtner to do much more than cross limply out of play.
 
33 min: Sweden finding a gap or two now and they win another right-sided 
corner. Same routine again? Nope – this time disappointing from Kallstrom and 
it’s hacked away at the near post.
 
31 min: Granqvist, once of Wigan of course, bundles through Jorgensen and it’s 
another free-kick, just about within Eriksen territory. HowDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> could do with something here ... 
and they come quite close to getting it, and Eriksen’s 30-yard effort bounces 
just in front of Isaksson and he has to parry wide. The corner comes to nothing.
 
28 min: Jacobsen crosses to nobody, which makes me wonder what Bendtner’s been 
up to for 28 minutes.
 
28 min: That could have been that! Ibrahimovic is slid through inside the area 
on his left side, and has only Schmeichel to beat ... the angle isn’t perfect 
but you’d still back him, until the Leicester ‘keeper saves the day with his 
legs! Big moment?
 
26 min: Jorgensen gets his head onto a good cross from Durmisi, but his neck 
isn’t long enough for a proper contact. Those flanks may still be key.
 
26 min: And by the same token, another goal from Sweden would leave Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> needing four. It’d very much be 
game over then. No clincher just now though as, following a good passing move, 
Bengtsson slices his cross behind the goal.
 
24 min: Easier said than done, but Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> need to keep calm now and do 
what they had been doing. Their task is doubly hard now and that will have been 
a big psychological blow ... but one goal can change the whole mood again.
 
22 min: Absolutely classic against-the-run-of-play stuff there, and what a 
wonderfully-taken goal from Sweden’s talisman.Denmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> try and hit back and win a 
corner, again punched away by Isaksson.
