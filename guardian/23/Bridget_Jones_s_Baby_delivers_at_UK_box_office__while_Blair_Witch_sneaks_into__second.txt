The winner: Bridget Jones’s Baby

The US opening may have offered a disappointing $8.6m (£6.64m), but Bridget 
Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 delivered a storming victory on home turf, with a UK debut of £8.11m. That’s 
the biggest opening ever for a film released in September, says distributor 
Universal.

Ignoring preview numbers, Bridget Jones’s Baby has the seventh biggest debut 
of the year, almost level withFinding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
 (£8.12m) and behindBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

In 2016, the most aptly comparable title for Bridget is Absolutely Fabulous: 
The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
, which began in early July with £4.04m including negligible previews. Bridget 
Jones’s Baby has delivered a little more than twice that opening number.

Almost 12 years have elapsed since the release of second film in the series, 
Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1348598,00.html>
, and it was hardly inevitable that audiences would return in equivalent 
numbers. Edge of Reason began with £10.44m, but that includes previews of 
£3.31m – so it was £7.13m for the actual weekend period. The originalBridget 
Jones’s Diary <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/13/helenfielding> 
kicked off in April 2001 with £5.72m, including previews of £1.14m. Baby has 
brought the biggest weekend gross of the series.

Bridget Jones’s Baby should play to mixed-gender couples (more of a weekend 
audience) and female pairs and groups (strong on weekdays). Word of mouth will 
be crucial to sustain its performance.

The runner-up: Blair Witch

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/26/blair-witch-trailer-watch-first-footage-from-the-surprise-sequel-video>
Bridget Jones’s Baby grossed more than eight times its nearest competitor, 
Blair Witch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/blair-witch-review-horror-sequel>
. Like Bridget, it is the third instalment in a franchise and a belated sequel 
to a second episode (Book of Shadows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,388403,00.html>
, released in 2000). This latest film took £959,000, and while it is some 
achievement to bring back audiences after the poorly received Book of Shadows, 
there seemed to be plenty of excitement about a successful creative revival of 
Blair Witch. Book of Shadows kicked off its UK run with £1.09m, including 
£108,000 in previews.

The event: The Beatles

The Top 10 chart, below, suggests that Ron Howard’s documentary The Beatles: 
Eight Days a Week – The Touring Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-review-ron-howard-documentary>
 has achieved a scorching site average, given an opening weekend gross of 
£655,000 from 96 sites. Indeed, the film has done well – but not that well on a 
per cinema basis. The £655,000 figure includes the special transmission on 
Thursday of the film’s London premiere, which contributes £597,000 from 497 
cinemas. Thereafter, it has been achieving spotty bookings – encore showings, 
in event cinema parlance.

Comparisons are hard to make, although the previous week the Nick Cave 
documentaryOne More Time With Feeling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/one-more-time-with-feeling-review-film-nick-cave-andrew-dominik-venice>
 began with £343,000 from 59 sites, including £260,000 from a Thursday release 
in wider play.

The Irish hit: The Young Offenders

From a first-time feature director (Peter Foott) and starring two teenage 
actors also making their big-screen debuts (Alex Murphy, Chris Walley), Irish 
comedy The Young Offenders has delivered a robust debut in Ireland, with 
£172,000 from 65 sites. It premieres in the UK at the London film festival on 7 
October.

The indie hit: Hunt for the Wilderpeople

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-sam-neill-misfit-kid-kiwi-hit>
, which begins with an impressive £168,000 from 63 cinemas, including £15,00 in 
previews. That compares with a debut of £128,000 from 33 cinemas, including 
previews of £63,000, for Shadows.

Admissions update

Figures for August show 18.09m tickets were sold in the UK, up 26% up on the 
same month in 2015, and the biggest total for any month since August 2011. 
While admissions this year had been lagging behind 2015 levels, the strong 
showing in August means that they are now up 0.4% for the first eight months of 
the year. That’s a surprising outcome, given the strong product in 2015, which 
saw admissions surge from 2014 levels.

Star performers in August include Suicide Squad, Finding Dory and Jason 
Bourne. The challenge for 2016 in terms of continuing to match 2015 is the 
robust final quarter a year ago, which hadSpectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden>
 andStar Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming>
. Cinema bookers will be hoping thatFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them> and 
Rogue One <https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story> can 
deliver equivalent numbers.

The future

Thanks to that scorching Bridget number, the 16-18 September market is up 64% 
on the previous frame and 43% ahead of the equivalent weekend from 2015, when
