So John Harris believes that there were once some halcyon days when “pop music 
was a great leveller” (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/16/pop-music-bespoke-plaything-wealth-divide>
, 16 November). In 1966, aged 15, when I was earning £6 10s 6d a week in my 
first job, a 45 rpm single cost about 6s 8d, and an LP £1 12s 6d. To buy the 
Beatles LP Revolver therefore cost me more or less a quarter of my wages.

Pop music was a great leveller. Now it’s a bespoke plaything for the rich |

Looking back, the pop business was extraordinarily rapacious, screwing every 
last penny it could out of young pop pickers like me. And what did we get for 
that money? A piece of plastic and two bits of cardboard.

No wonder the Beatles were travelling around in Rolls-Royces while I had to 
make do with the bus. The only egalitarianism at work was that millions of pop 
fans were equally ripped off.
