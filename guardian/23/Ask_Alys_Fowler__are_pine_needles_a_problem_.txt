Are pine needles the friend or foe of gardeners?
All leaves are our friends, because they break down to make leaf mould. This 
is magic stuff that can be used as seed compost, or as a mulch for woodland 
plants, or added to any soil to increase moisture and improve root growth by 
boosting fungal activity.

Some leaves take longer than others to break down. The quickest leaf mould 
tends to be from beech, hornbeam or oak. Pine needles are not quick to rot 
down, but when they do, they are acidic, making perfect leaf mould for 
ericaceous plants such as blueberries, rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias, 
heathers andpieris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_(plant)>.

Conifer needles are less exciting, because they take such a long time to rot 
(two to three years) and aren’t as acidic. Evergreens such as holly, aucuba and 
cherry laurel are also a bit of a pain: I think these are best shredded before 
adding to the leaf mould pile, because this will help them break down faster.

Aim to keep deciduous leaves in a separate pile from evergreens, because 
evergreens take so much longer to break down. Once they have, they make a 
great leaf mould.
