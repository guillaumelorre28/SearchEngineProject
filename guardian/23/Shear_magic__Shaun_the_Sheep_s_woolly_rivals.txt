Since his cameo role in Wallace & Gromit’s A Close Shave two decades ago, 
Aardman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/aardman> Animations’ plucky 
plasticine hero Shaun the Sheep has become a genuine fleecy phenomenon. His 
CBBC series has been exported worldwide and a film spin-off gambols friskily on 
to cinema screens this Friday (tagline: “Catch them if ewe can”). To mark the 
ovine occasion, we round up and rate the star’s famous fleecy rivals…

Baa Baa Black Sheep 

The nursery rhyme has been around for at least 300 years, but debate about its 
meaning still bleats on. Was it a protest song against the slave trade or 
medieval taxes on wool? It was certainly the subject of “loony left” scare 
stories in the 80s and 90s, when PC nurseries changed the lyrics to “little 
sheep” or, randomly, “rainbow sheep”.

Dolly the Sheep


Named after Dolly Parton because the crucial cells were taken from a mammary 
gland, Dolly was the world’s first mammal successfully cloned from an adult. 
She was born at Edinburgh University in 1996 and became quite the celebrity. 
When Dolly died, she was stuffed and displayed in the National Museum of 
Scotland.

Larry the Lamb


Not to be confused with actor Larry Lamb, this Larry was the lead character in 
BBC radio’sToytown plays. Alongside sidekick Dennis the Dachshund, Larry shot 
to livestock stardom in 1929 on theChildren’s Hour slot, then moved to ITV in 
the 70s.

Lamb Chop

Created in 1957 by ventriloquist Shari Lewis, Lamb Chop had long eyelashes and 
a feisty attitude. Alongside fellow sock puppet Hush Puppy, the ovine diva 
remained a fixture on American pre-school TV into the 90s, winning Emmys and 
even being made a three-star general by the US military. When Lewis died, 
daughter Mallory took up the woolly mantle.

Clarice Starling’s lamb


When FBI rookie Starling interrogates serial killer Hannibal Lecter in Thomas 
Harris’sSilence of the Lambs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/39337/silence.of.the.lambs>, the 
flesh-scoffing psychiatrist trades information for personal confessions. 
Clarice recalls how she was orphaned and sent to live on her uncle’s Montana 
farm but ran away in horror when she heard spring lambs being slaughtered – 
trying to save one as she fled.

McMutton

Football comic strip Hot Shot Hamish, which appeared in Scorcher, Tiger and 
Roy of the Rovers, followed gentle Hebridean giant Hamish Balfour, who had the 
world’s hardest shot. Hamish also owned a ferocious “wee pet sheep” called 
McMutton, fond of butting his master’s enemies. Ram-raiding, if you will.
