.

Curtis made his directorial debut with the 2003 film, an ensemble comedy about 
intersecting couples in the run-up to Christmas, which has become a perennial 
holiday favourite.

Rickman plays the unfaithful husband of Emma Thompson

Said Curtis: “It seemed like a miracle to me when Alan agreed to do our film, 
and he did the part exquisitely, of course, better than it was written. As an 
actor he almost literally made every single word complex and interesting.”

Curtis went on to pay tribute to Rickman’s generous personality, and prowess 
at more compassionate roles than those for which he became most famous.

“Strangely – for someone who had a reputation for villainy, as it were – I 
always particularly loved his portrayals of goodness and gentleness. He was 
wonderful in Stephen Poliakoff’s Close My Eyes as the benign betrayed husband, 
so graceful and noble in Ang Lee’s Sense and Sensibility and the perfect, 
casual, loving, dead husband in Truly Madly Deeply.”

Curtis concluded by remembering a key scene from the Anthony Minghella 
romance: “Is there a lovelier two minutes in the movies than their version of 
‘The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore’ … ? Alas.”

The evergreen appeal of Curtis’s film was demonstrated by the excitement

 last month when the fate of Rickman and Thompson’s characters was revealed.

Writing on Twitter, the film’s co-writer (and Curtis’s wife), Emma Freud, 
answered questions about what she envisioned happening after the credits 
rolled. Freud had been rewatching the film and said she was again moved by the 
gift scene.

She then went on to explain that the pair do reconcile – as suggested after 
Thompson’s character confronts her husband – but any happily-after-resolution 
is muted.

Sensibility, Rickman’s directorial debut, The Winter Guest, and The Song of 
Lunch – in which they also play a one-time couple.

Writing on Thursday, she spoke of her immense sadness at Rickman’s death, 
having “just kissed him goodbye”.

“What I remember most in this moment of painful leave-taking is his humour, 
intelligence, wisdom and kindness,” she wrote. “His capacity to fell you with a 
look or lift you with a word.”

Thompson continued: “I couldn’t wait to see what he was going to do with his 
face next … He was the ultimate ally. In life, art and politics. I trusted him 
absolutely. He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we 
shall not see his like again.”
