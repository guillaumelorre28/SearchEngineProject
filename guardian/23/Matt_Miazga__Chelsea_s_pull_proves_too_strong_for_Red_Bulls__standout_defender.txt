With Thierry Henry snarling in his direction, incredulous at the howler made 
by the New York Red Bulls’ rookie <https://youtu.be/w8T0ATEy-Rk?t=2m10s> 
18-year-old, Matt Miazga looked to have a rather steep learning curve ahead of 
him. The New Jersey native of Polish descent has certainly scaled that arc in 
the 18 months since that blunder against the Columbus Crew, but now he has 
another peak to climb. London is calling.

Chelsea confirm signing of Matt Miazga from New York Red Bulls

Miazga this week completed a remarkable rise, with Chelsea wrapping up a £3.5m 
move for the centre-back. At 20, he in the vanguard of Major League Soccer’s 
homegrown crop, and at Stamford Bridge he will be given the kind of platform no 
American player has had since Tim Howard also made the move from New York to the
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> over 12 
years ago. The past year was unanimously acknowledged to have been a good one 
for Miazga – lifting the Supporters’ Shield as one of the Red Bulls’ standout 
performers – but maybe not this good.

So what are Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> getting 
from their new American stopper? At 6ft 4in, the lanky Miazga certainly 
commands a presence, but there is a technicality to his game too. Athleticism 
is indeed his greatest – and most obvious – asset, yet his ability on the ball 
will serve him well in a more technically demanding division. Miazga can pass.

He arrives with an international background too, although his track record 
makes Timothy Chandler look like a flag-waving nationalist. Miazga turned out 
for the United States’ Under-14s, -16s and -20s sides, but also played for 
Poland’s Under-16s and -18s. His future was the subject of discussion – Poland 
wanted him to commit – but his substitute appearance for USA in a World Cup 
qualifier against St Vincent & the Grenadines put paid to Polish hopes. It was 
forUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> that Miazga first 
caught the eye of Premier League scouts.

Last year’s Under-20 World Cup was a breakthrough event for the defender, with 
Tab Ramos’s side only knocked out on penalties by eventual winners Serbia. He 
might not have been Captain America, but in effect Miazga was the USA’s leader 
at the back, showing the kind of leadership capacity not seen in many players 
of his age. By his own admission, he is hardly a natural figurehead but has 
worked hard at that aspect of his game.

In MLS <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mls> terms, Miazga has pedigree, 
marking David Villa out of a Yankee Stadium derby in a nationally televised 
game last June, and also finding the net for the Red Bulls in a 3-1 win. At 
Chelsea, however, the 20-year-old will have to prove himself all over again. 
First-team opportunities will be at a premium, with some already mooting that a 
loan deal away from Stamford Bridge might give Miazga the best chance of making 
an impression in England.

“We don’t rush him, but he will be one of the squad members for the future,” 
Guus Hiddink explained when asked about what role Miazga will play at Chelsea. 
“He’s a young guy stepping up to the national team and it’s always good to have 
such players here so you can see what they are capable of in training. He’s a 
young player, a promising player – let’s see if he can get himself to the high 
demands of this club and the Premier League.”

2015 saw the Red Bulls became a very different franchise, with billboard faces 
like Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill replaced by more shrewdly acquired signings. 
Head coach Jesse Marsch placed more of an emphasis on organic development, and 
Miazga was arguably the primary beneficiary of that renewed approach. He became 
the poster-boy for MLS’s often maligned homegrown program.

“I think he’s been one of the best defenders in the league this year and 
should be considered in that echelon,” Marsch gushed towards the close of last 
season. “His starting points are very high – everything from his mentality, to 
his awareness, to his athleticism – which means his ceiling is very high.”

Others aren’t so convinced, though. “He is a really nice guy, but pretty naive 
and he plays young,” a mystery former teammate, who apparently played with 
Miazga in New York, told the Secret Footballer. “He looks big but he is soft, 
so hopefully he gets a little stronger and meaner otherwise he will be eaten 
alive in the Premier League. He is a good kid, so I am happy for him, but he 
needs to be loaned out to get experience.”

Here is a quote I got from a former teammate of new Chelsea signing Matt 
Miazga ...pic.twitter.com/yvAe8o0a67 <https://t.co/yvAe8o0a67>

Miazga has resisted the Premier League’s overtures before – with Leicester 
City and Stoke City both reportedly interested parties – but this time English 
soccer’s pull has proven too strong. The defender could probably have used at 
least another year in MLS, backing up what he achieved last season, but the 
appeal of joining one of the game’s biggest clubs is understandable.

On the flip side, Chelsea fans – with little over 48 hours of the transfer 
window remaining – will surely question how the signing of Miazga, as well as 
Alexandre Pato, can possibly turn around their ailing campaign. Why the latter 
was sought is anyone’s guess, but Miazga has been signed with at least one eye 
on the future. The past year has taken him further than anyone could have 
envisaged – providing encouragement that in a better league he will only 
improve further. And with Henry now working as a TV pundit in England he might 
still have the Frenchman to send him a well-meaning scowl every so often.
