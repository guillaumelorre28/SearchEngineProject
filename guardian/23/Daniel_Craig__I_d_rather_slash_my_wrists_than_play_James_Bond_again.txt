For actors of a certain masculine bent, James Bond has long been viewed as a 
career pinnacle. But after four films as 007Daniel Craig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig> says he has had enough, and 
would “rather slash my wrists” than reprise the role.

If that wasn’t enough, the 47-year-old admitted that if he did return as Bond 
it would be just for the money. He took a similarly dismissive opinion on that 
staple of British conversational life,who should take over in the role

: “Look, I don’t give a fuck.”

During a brief but open interview with Time Out magazine 
<http://www.timeout.com/london/film/daniel-craig-interview-my-advice-to-the-next-james-bond-dont-be-shit>
 before the release this month of the latest Bond title,Spectre 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/>, Craig also confirmed his torso gets an 
airing (“Yes, I’ve been working out for six months. Of course I’m getting my 
kit off!”), while noting that the focus on Bond’s physical appearance was “a 
drag”.

The strongest words came when Craig was asked if he could imagine another film 
in the role. “Now? I’d rather … slash my wrists,” he replied. “No, not at the 
moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I 
want to do is move on.”

Craig added a slight caveat, saying this would be his view for “at least a 
year or two”. He added: “I don’t know what the next step is. I’ve no idea. Not 
because I’m trying to be cagey. Who the fuck knows? At the moment, we’ve done 
it. I’m not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond 
movie, it would only be for the money.”

Daniel Craig: I will keep playing Bond as long as I can

It’s worth noting, however, that only last month Craig said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/30/daniel-craig-james-bond-film-role-spectre>
 he would continue in the role “as long as I’m physically able”.

Craig was initially seen as a somewhat risky choice for Bond before his debut 
inCasino Royale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/10/jamesbond.danielcraig> in 2006, 
viewed by some as insufficiently debonair and arched-eyebrowed, even too blond. 
But his tougher, more brutal take on the rebooted character has proved vastly 
popular, with2012’s Skyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review>, Craig’s third 
film, proving the highest-grossing Bond of all time.

In the Time Out interview, Craig said he and Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall 
and Spectre, “butted heads a lot” during the first film, but have become very 
close. OnSpectre <https://www.theguardian.com/film/spectre>, Craig added, he 
contributed to elements of the script.

“The way it works is that I’d wake up in the middle of the night with an idea 
and write it down and send it to Sam and he ignores me or doesn’t ignore me, or 
talks to me the following morning and we develop it from there,” Craig said. 
“So I’m not physically writing things down.”

Gingerfinger: Damien Lewis new bookies' favourite for next James Bond

If Craig does retire as Bond he will do so relatively young compared with some 
of his predecessors. Pierce Brosnan was 49 in his last appearance, Roger Moore, 
was 58 as he wheezed through A View to a Kill, but Timothy Dalton escaped at 45.

Some Bonds have seen their profile dip after the role. Dalton, for example, 
admittedly more of a stage actor, is possibly best known since for voicing a 
thespian toy hedgehog in Toy Story 3.

Craig said he did not worry about being typecast because Bond had “changed my 
working life in an incredible way”. He added: “There are more opportunities. I 
could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, 
the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming. That’s the 
restriction.”

And while Craig professed no view on who should take over from him, he did 
have some sage, if arguably obvious, advice: “Don’t be shit. You’ve got to step 
up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So 
don’t be shit.”
