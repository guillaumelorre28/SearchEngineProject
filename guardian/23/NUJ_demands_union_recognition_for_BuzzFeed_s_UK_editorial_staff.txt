Staff working for BuzzFeed in London have requested recognition for the 
National Union of Journalists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/nationalunionofjournalists> (NUJ).


According to a report on the BuzzFeed site 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/marieleconte/buzzfeed-uk-editorial-staff-ask-for-union-recognition>
, the majority of editorial staff (in a total workforce of about 80) have 
signed union cards.

On 25 November, the NUJ sent a letter to BuzzFeed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/buzzfeed> UK’s editor-in-chief, Janine 
Gibson, requesting union recognition for collective bargaining purposes.

The NUJ organiser wrote: “We are hopeful you will see this as a positive and 
productive step in the long-term development of BuzzFeed UK.

“Your staff are very keen to emphasise they all enjoy working for BuzzFeed UK, 
and believe in building a sustainable business with you.”

BuzzFeed’s chief executive, Jonah Peretti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/jonah-peretti>, responded in an email. He 
wrote:

“Before any decision is made, it is incredibly important to me that I have a 
direct line of communication with all of you, that I know about any concerns, 
complaints, or suggestions for improvement you have, and that we can speak 
openly and directly with each other.”

Peretti is due to visit the London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> 
office later this month to discuss the issue with staff. In his email, he said: 
“We’d like an opportunity to talk directly with you before you make any 
irreversible decisions.”

Peretti’s email response to “UK BuzzFeeders”can be found here
