The leaked US diplomatic cables reveal a particular intelligence interest in 
Alan Duncan <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanduncan>, at the time 
shadow minister for prisons. Duncan, a former oil trader who is now 
international development minister, is gay. He once shared a London flat with 
William Hague, who has felt obliged to deny public speculation about his own 
sexuality.

A 22 January 2010 cable was signed off by Elizabeth Pitterle, head of 
intelligence operations. She thanked the London embassy for its intelligence on 
Duncan's "friendship with ... William Hague 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/244921>", saying 
it was "particularly insightful and exceptionally well timed, as analysts are 
preparing finished products on the Conservative leadership for senior 
policymakers".

The cable called for further intelligence on "Duncan's relationship with 
Conservative party leader David Cameron and William Hague", and asked:"What 
role would Duncan play if theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> form a government? What 
are Duncan's political ambitions?"

The original dispatch profiling Duncan is not available among the 250,000 
leaked Siprnet cables. Intelligence information was normally sent to Washington 
on a separate, more restricted telecommunications channel called Roger, which 
has not been breached.
