The weaker than expected UK inflation figures have put pressure on the pound 
again, pushing it lower against the dollar and the euro.

Sterling is currently down 0.4% at $1.2433 against the dollar, and the same 
amount lower against the euro at €1.1585.

Meanwhile the dollar itself is on the rise after the latest US economic data - 
stronger than expected retail sales - pointed once more to an interest rate 
rise next month.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets edge higher

Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping back after several days of 
gains, European markets ended the day in positive territory. The UK market was 
helped by weaker than expected inflation figures, which pushed back the chances 
of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. Joshua Mahony, market 
analyst at IG, said:

Stock markets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> rose once 
more today, as hopes of a high growth period based on substantial fiscal 
stimulus continued to stoke the embers of last week’s US election... we have 
seen energy stocks grab some respite today, as crude prices rose in the wake of 
a fresh charge from OPEC to find a means to ensure the output cut comes to 
fruition.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 39.56 points or 0.59% at 6792.74 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.39% to 10,735.14 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.62% at 4536.53 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.02% at 16,682.37 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8687.1 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% at 578.17 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points 
or 0.14%.

Elsewhere, crude has been buoyed by renewed talk that oil producers are trying 
to pave the way for an agreement on curbing output later this month. Brent 
crude is currently up 4% at $46.24 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has 
jumped 4.4% to $45.24.

Reuters has reported that Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is expected to 
travel to Qatar this week for a meeting with producers. The outline of a deal 
to limit output was agreed by Opec in Algiers in September, but the details 
have proved difficult to agree.

Helena Smith

Not everyone is happy with Barack Obama’s presence in Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>. Helena Smith reports:

Thousands of protestors have taken to the streets in a mass display of 
opposition against Obama.

Despite a government ban on protestors taking place during the 29-hour period 
the US president is expected to be in the Greek capital as many as 3,000 
people, many communists and hardline leftists, have defied the order to gather 
in central Athens and march towards the US embassy.

Some are carrying placards proclaiming “unwanted,” others decrying “capitalism 
and imperialism.” Riot police have been dispatched with organisers, including 
Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister and far left leader of the 
pro-drachma, breakaway Popular Unity party, denouncing the prohibition as 
“illegal and provocative” as Greece prepares to mark the November 17 
anniversary commemorating the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against US-backed 
military rule.

US markets off to a mixed start

After six straight days of rises, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pausing 
for breathe.

It is currently down 26 points or 0.15%, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both moved 
higher at the open.

And here are Obama’s comments. Helena reports:

“I have always wanted to come to Greece ... I think we all know that the world 
owes an enormous debt toGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and 
the Greek people,” Obama also told reporters.

“The ideas of ancient Greeks helped inspire our founding fathers ….to this day 
the United States is profoundly grateful to our Greek friends.

“I know this has been a painful and difficult time … this crisis is not an 
abstraction but has a very concrete and devastating impact on people in this 
country.”

It was, he said, now very important that “Greeks see improvements in their 
daily lives.”

Obama backs debt relief for Greece

Helena Smith

Back to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> again, where the US 
president has begun his farewell tour of Europe. Our correspondent Helena Smith 
reports:

Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> may be 
visiting Athens at the end of his time in office but the outgoing US leader has 
not disappointed. Barely three hours after he touched down in a Greek capital 
rendered almost unrecognizable by draconian security, Obama said the three 
words Greek officials have wanted the world leader to utter: debt, austerity 
and solidarity. “I will continue to underline that austerity alone cannot 
deliver prosperity,” he told the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after 
being greeted by the debt-stricken country’s head of state and the rousing 
tones of a military honour band. “Debt relief is needed.”

Earlier he had said: “Greece has gone through very challenging and dramatic 
times over the last several years. We are glad to see that progress is being 
made, although we recognise that there are significant challenges ahead, and we 
intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Greek people throughout this 
process. “

Athens’ leftist led government has made little secret that it hopes the US 
president’s open display of support will resonate withGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> and other partners in Europe which 
have footed the bill of the nation’s massive bailouts but demanded punishing 
belt-tightening in return. “We consider this visit will contribute to the 
effort to reduce Greece’s debt, its spokesman said ahead of the leader’s 
arrival. “The US president has repeatedly stated he wants to solve this huge 
issue before he leaves office.”

Obama, only the fourth American leader to visit the country since its 
foundation nearly 200 years ago, heads to Berlin once his 29-hour sojourn in 
Athens ends on Wednesday.

Tsipras is pushing EU partners to agree to a debt deal by the end of the year. 
At around €330bn, or 180 percent of GDP, Greece’s debt pile is not only 
regarded as unsustainable but perhaps the biggest impediment to its economic 
recovery.

Without the load being partially forgiven, Tsipras’ Syriza-dominated 
government says it will be high-nigh impossible to get out of the death spiral 
in which the recession-ravaged economy now finds itself.

Obama, who also spoke of the importance of reforms in making the Greek economy 
more competitive, emphasized the significance of a “strong, prosperous and 
unified Europe … not just for the people of Europe but for the whole world and 
the US.”

This is the first time a sitting US president has elected to visit Greece on 
its own. On previous occasions Turkey has also been included in the tour. But 
Obama, who is accompanied by his Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew and Assistant 
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, is 
believed to have wanted to make the trip for a long time. “It was a personal 
choice,” said the defense minister Panos Kammenos speaking to a local radio 
station after welcoming the leader at Athens’ international airport. The 
symbolism of Athens being the birthplace of democracy also played a significant 
role for a president now determined to allay the fears of European leaders 
following the election of his successor Donald Trump last week.

At a press conference following 90-minute talks with Obama, the Greek prime 
minister said it was vital that Greeks began to feel the effects of the 
sacrifices they have made in recent years.

“After seven years the Greek people cannot bear any more austerity,” he told 
reporters. “Greece deserves debt relief and the time is now. President Obama 
and I discussed a number of issues specifically the important potential of 
investment in Greece and the future of Greece with its shipping power becoming 
an important centre for trade, transport and energy.”

But the signs of US economic strength question the need for any fiscal 
stimulus, says Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research:

The consumption strength (and the related good performance of the US economy 
in the second half of 2016) has important policy implications.

First, and most straightforward, it allows the Fed to stay on course for a 
rate hike at the upcoming meeting in mid-December.

Second, and probably more controversial, it really questions the need for a 
massive fiscal stimulus at this point. After all, the idea of such a stimulus 
is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing 
literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is 
close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for 
the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed 
policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than 
damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher 
inflation, and then a deeper recession.

The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the 
US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Rob Carnell, chief 
international economist at ING Bank, said a hike next month was almost in the 
bag:

Strong US retail sales, and an expectation of further gains in inflation (due 
out on November 17) make the 92% market probability for a 14 December Fed rate 
hike look about right (nothing is 100% until it is done).

Not only were headline retail sales figures strong at +0.8% month on month, 
but there were strong core figures (control group which strips out the more 
volatile items also rose 0.8% month on month). The figures were stronger than 
the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards 
revisions to the previous months’ data are taken into account.

The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few 
sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on 
month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on 
month).

While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in 
markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently 
optimistic about Trump’s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying 
risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right. 
That said, it places most of the risk on the downside, should expansion take 
longer to materialise than expected, or protectionism rear up more strongly 
than anticipated.

US retail sales stronger than expected

While Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> was 
delighting MPs by doling out party invitations, the US released better than 
forecast retail sales figures for October.

According to the Commerce Department, <http://www.census.gov/retail/index.html>
 retail sales rose 0.8% last month compared to September, with a particularly 
strong performance from the car industry. On top of that, building materials 
were also in demand, perhaps due to households hit by Hurricane Matthew having 
to rebuild and repair damage. The year on year rise was 4.3%.

Analysts had forecast a month on month rise of 0.6% in October. Meanwhile 
September’s figure was revised upwards from 0.6% to 1%. The combined gain in 
September and October was the biggest two month gain since early 2014.

The weaker than expected UK inflation figures have put pressure on the pound 
again, pushing it lower against the dollar and the euro.

Sterling is currently down 0.4% at $1.2433 against the dollar, and the same 
amount lower against the euro at €1.1585.

Meanwhile the dollar itself is on the rise after the latest US economic data - 
stronger than expected retail sales - pointed once more to an interest rate 
rise next month.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping back after several days of 
gains, European markets ended the day in positive territory. The UK market was 
helped by weaker than expected inflation figures, which pushed back the chances 
of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. Joshua Mahony, market 
analyst at IG, said:

Stock markets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> rose once 
more today, as hopes of a high growth period based on substantial fiscal 
stimulus continued to stoke the embers of last week’s US election... we have 
seen energy stocks grab some respite today, as crude prices rose in the wake of 
a fresh charge from OPEC to find a means to ensure the output cut comes to 
fruition.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 39.56 points or 0.59% at 6792.74 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.39% to 10,735.14 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.62% at 4536.53 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.02% at 16,682.37 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8687.1 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% at 578.17 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points 
or 0.14%.
 
Elsewhere, crude has been buoyed by renewed talk that oil producers are trying 
to pave the way for an agreement on curbing output later this month. Brent 
crude is currently up 4% at $46.24 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has 
jumped 4.4% to $45.24.

Reuters has reported that Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is expected to 
travel to Qatar this week for a meeting with producers. The outline of a deal 
to limit output was agreed by Opec in Algiers in September, but the details 
have proved difficult to agree.
 
Not everyone is happy with Barack Obama’s presence in Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>. Helena Smith reports:

Thousands of protestors have taken to the streets in a mass display of 
opposition against Obama.

Despite a government ban on protestors taking place during the 29-hour period 
the US president is expected to be in the Greek capital as many as 3,000 
people, many communists and hardline leftists, have defied the order to gather 
in central Athens and march towards the US embassy.

Some are carrying placards proclaiming “unwanted,” others decrying “capitalism 
and imperialism.” Riot police have been dispatched with organisers, including 
Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister and far left leader of the 
pro-drachma, breakaway Popular Unity party, denouncing the prohibition as 
“illegal and provocative” as Greece prepares to mark the November 17 
anniversary commemorating the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against US-backed 
military rule.

Here are Obama and Alexis Tsipras, courtesy of the White House, with the US 
president saying he would continue to urge Greece’s creditors to take the steps 
needed to put the country on the path to a durable economic recovery:

After six straight days of rises, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pausing 
for breathe.

It is currently down 26 points or 0.15%, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both moved 
higher at the open.

And here are Obama’s comments. Helena reports:

“I have always wanted to come to Greece ... I think we all know that the world 
owes an enormous debt toGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and 
the Greek people,” Obama also told reporters.

“The ideas of ancient Greeks helped inspire our founding fathers ….to this day 
the United States is profoundly grateful to our Greek friends.

“I know this has been a painful and difficult time … this crisis is not an 
abstraction but has a very concrete and devastating impact on people in this 
country.”

It was, he said, now very important that “Greeks see improvements in their 
daily lives.”
 
Back to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> again, where the US 
president has begun his farewell tour of Europe. Our correspondent Helena Smith 
reports:

Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> may be 
visiting Athens at the end of his time in office but the outgoing US leader has 
not disappointed. Barely three hours after he touched down in a Greek capital 
rendered almost unrecognizable by draconian security, Obama said the three 
words Greek officials have wanted the world leader to utter: debt, austerity 
and solidarity. “I will continue to underline that austerity alone cannot 
deliver prosperity,” he told the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after 
being greeted by the debt-stricken country’s head of state and the rousing 
tones of a military honour band. “Debt relief is needed.”

Earlier he had said: “Greece has gone through very challenging and dramatic 
times over the last several years. We are glad to see that progress is being 
made, although we recognise that there are significant challenges ahead, and we 
intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Greek people throughout this 
process. “
 Tsipras welcomes Obama Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images 
Athens’ leftist led government has made little secret that it hopes the US 
president’s open display of support will resonate withGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> and other partners in Europe which 
have footed the bill of the nation’s massive bailouts but demanded punishing 
belt-tightening in return. “We consider this visit will contribute to the 
effort to reduce Greece’s debt, its spokesman said ahead of the leader’s 
arrival. “The US president has repeatedly stated he wants to solve this huge 
issue before he leaves office.”

Obama, only the fourth American leader to visit the country since its 
foundation nearly 200 years ago, heads to Berlin once his 29-hour sojourn in 
Athens ends on Wednesday.

Tsipras is pushing EU partners to agree to a debt deal by the end of the year. 
At around €330bn, or 180 percent of GDP, Greece’s debt pile is not only 
regarded as unsustainable but perhaps the biggest impediment to its economic 
recovery.

Without the load being partially forgiven, Tsipras’ Syriza-dominated 
government says it will be high-nigh impossible to get out of the death spiral 
in which the recession-ravaged economy now finds itself.

Obama, who also spoke of the importance of reforms in making the Greek economy 
more competitive, emphasized the significance of a “strong, prosperous and 
unified Europe … not just for the people of Europe but for the whole world and 
the US.”

This is the first time a sitting US president has elected to visit Greece on 
its own. On previous occasions Turkey has also been included in the tour. But 
Obama, who is accompanied by his Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew and Assistant 
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, is 
believed to have wanted to make the trip for a long time. “It was a personal 
choice,” said the defense minister Panos Kammenos speaking to a local radio 
station after welcoming the leader at Athens’ international airport. The 
symbolism of Athens being the birthplace of democracy also played a significant 
role for a president now determined to allay the fears of European leaders 
following the election of his successor Donald Trump last week.
 The leaders’ press conference Photograph: POOL/Reuters 
At a press conference following 90-minute talks with Obama, the Greek prime 
minister said it was vital that Greeks began to feel the effects of the 
sacrifices they have made in recent years.

“After seven years the Greek people cannot bear any more austerity,” he told 
reporters. “Greece deserves debt relief and the time is now. President Obama 
and I discussed a number of issues specifically the important potential of 
investment in Greece and the future of Greece with its shipping power becoming 
an important centre for trade, transport and energy.”
 
But the signs of US economic strength question the need for any fiscal 
stimulus, says Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research:

The consumption strength (and the related good performance of the US economy 
in the second half of 2016) has important policy implications.

First, and most straightforward, it allows the Fed to stay on course for a 
rate hike at the upcoming meeting in mid-December.

Second, and probably more controversial, it really questions the need for a 
massive fiscal stimulus at this point. After all, the idea of such a stimulus 
is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing 
literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is 
close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for 
the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed 
policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than 
damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher 
inflation, and then a deeper recession.
 
The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the 
US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Rob Carnell, chief 
international economist at ING Bank, said a hike next month was almost in the 
bag:

Strong US retail sales, and an expectation of further gains in inflation (due 
out on November 17) make the 92% market probability for a 14 December Fed rate 
hike look about right (nothing is 100% until it is done).

Not only were headline retail sales figures strong at +0.8% month on month, 
but there were strong core figures (control group which strips out the more 
volatile items also rose 0.8% month on month). The figures were stronger than 
the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards 
revisions to the previous months’ data are taken into account.

The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few 
sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on 
month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on 
month).

While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in 
markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently 
optimistic about Trump’s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying 
risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right. 
That said, it places most of the risk on the downside, should expansion take 
longer to materialise than expected, or protectionism rear up more strongly 
than anticipated.
