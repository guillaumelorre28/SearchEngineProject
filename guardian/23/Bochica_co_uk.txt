An affordable ethical fashion site featuring women's and men's fashions as 
well as accessories. Bochica launched its first Autumn/Winter collections from 
brands such as Komodo, Made and Doy Bags. It promises to be both ethical and 
affordable but most importantly fashionable - there are no Hessian sack cloths 
or jesus-creepers in sight.

With prices starting from just £8.00 for jewellery and £45 for denim Bochica 
proves that being ethical doesn't have to be a luxury but can be the norm.
