The winner: Finding Dory

With Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/finding-dory-review-nemo-sequel-disability-ellen-de-generes>
 now the most successful animated movie of all time at theUS box-office 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/03/finding-dory-bfg-tarzan-debut-budget>
 ($469m so far), the pressure was on the UK division of Disney – which has 
always performed well with Pixar movies – to come up with a similar result. And 
the Finding Nemo sequel has certainly gotten off to a flying start, with debut 
weekend takings of £8.12m. That’s the second biggest three-day opening for a 
Disney or Pixar animated film, behind only Toy Story 3, which began in July 
2010 with £11.49m, plus previews of £9.69m. In terms of the whole animation 
sector, including companies such as DreamWorks Animation and Illumination 
Entertainment, Finding Dory has delivered the seventh-biggest three-day 
opening, behind Minions, Toy Story 3, Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Despicable Me 2 
and The Simpsons Movie.

interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/29/ellen-degeneres-finding-dory-video-interview>
If previews are included in opening weekend tallies, then several other films 
leapfrog Finding Dory, includingThe Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/26/secret-life-of-pets-review-visual-gags-and-silliness>
 (£9.58m including £3.63m in previews). To replicate Finding Dory’s US success 
and become the biggest animated title ever in the UK, the film would have to 
overtake Toy Story 3, which reached £73.8m. That almost certainly won’t happen. 
A more realistic target is Pixar’s second biggest UK hit, Toy Story 2 (£44.4m, 
not including the 3D re-release), or its third, Monsters, Inc (£37.9m). Even 
matching Finding Nemo (£37.4m) would be a significant achievement.

One factor in the film’s favour is that it has the whole of the rest of the 
summer school holiday ahead of it, with none of the family films yet to come 
(such asPete’s Dragon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak>
 and Swallows and Amazons) offering equivalent commercial appeal. The Secret 
Life of Pets is still in the Top 10, but having already passed the £30m 
milestone at the weekend, it has now presumably reached the bulk of its total 
audience.Ice Age: Collision Course 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ice-age-collision-course-review>, 
which grossed less than £200,000 at the weekend, looks a rather spent force, 
with a poor £6.06m so far. 

The runner-up: Jason Bourne

Matt Damon returns in new trailer for Jason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/21/matt-damon-returns-in-new-trailer-for-jason-bourne-video>
When Universal extended its Bourne franchise with 2012’s The Bourne Legacy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/the-bourne-legacy-review>, 
starring Jeremy Renner, the film debuted in the UK with £2.10m plus previews of 
£2.54m, on its way to a final total of £11.11m. That was a big drop from 2007’s 
The Bourne Ultimatum – the last to feature Matt Damon, and the last to be 
directed by Paul Greengrass – which reached a final total of just below £24m. 
WithJason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp>
, bothDamon and Greengrass are back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/17/matt-damon-paul-greengrass-jason-bourne-interview>
, and so are audiences. The fifth film in the franchise – and the fourth to 
feature the central character – has started its UK run with £5.31m including 
previews, taking the five-day opening total to £7.60m. That compares with a 
debut for The Bourne Ultimatum of £5.32m, or £6.55m including previews.

Like The BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/21/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-towers-over-roald-dahls-classic-tale>
 the week before, Jason Bourne has proved a welcome programming fit not just at 
multiplex venues but also at independent cinemas, trading on the cachet of its 
director, actor and brand. The fact that arthouse hits are currently few and 
far between is also encouraging indie venues to veer into a more mainstream 
programming mix. Even if Jason Bourne ultimately fails to catch Ultimatum, it 
will have no problem sailing past the lifetime totals of The Bourne Identity 
(£7.88m) and The Bourne Supremacy (£11.56m). 

The strong hold: The BFG

The BFG trailer: Steven Spielberg directs Roald Dahl’s fantasy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/18/the-bfg-trailer-steven-spielberg-directs-roald-dahls-fantasy-video>
With The BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/21/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-towers-over-roald-dahls-classic-tale>
 landing on the release calendar on 22 July and Finding Dory on 29 July, the 
pressure was always on distributor eOne to grab as much cash as possible in the 
film’s first seven days. Because who knew how it would fare in competition with 
the mighty Pixar?

Two things to say. First, The BFG did indeed enjoy a mighty first week, 
grossing a very nifty £11.12m. And second, it’s not over yet. Despite the 
arrival ofFinding Dory <https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-dory>, The BFG 
in fact declined by the smallest margin of any film in the Top 10, down a 
reasonable 37%. A second-weekend gross of £3.36m raises the 10-day tally to 
£14.48m. In the US, The BFG has grossed $52m after five weeks, and is reaching 
the end of its theatrical life. An equivalent gross in the UK would be just 
over £5m, so it’s clear that The BFG is in fact going to achieve a significant 
rise on that number. In the US, the film has the advantage of powerhouse 
distributor Disney, with all its marketing channels including television, 
stores and theme parks, not to mention the trusted authority of the Disney 
brand. In the UK, eOne’s advantage was the special regard for author Roald Dahl 
and the film’s British characters and setting.

The indie wipeout

The current Top 10 features one Bollywood film (Dishoom) plus nine major 
studio pictures including four sequels (Finding Dory, Jason Bourne,Star Trek 
Beyond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/15/star-trek-beyond-review-zachary-quinto-spock-anton-yelchin>
, Ice Age: Collision Course), one reboot (Ghostbusters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ghostbusters-review-very-funny-action-comedy-spectacular>
) and three appropriation of familiar brands (The BFG,The Legend of Tarzan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/the-legend-of-tarzan-review-an-inherently-problematic-remake>
,Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
). Illumination Entertainment’s The Secret Life of Pets wins points for 
introducing a fresh concept to the screen.

Indie movie hits, meanwhile, are hardly to be seen. Best of the bunch is 
Thomas Vinterberg’sThe Commune 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/the-commune-review-kollektivet-thomas-vinterberg>
, landing at No 18 with an opening gross of just over £25,000 from 23 cinemas. 
To be fair, that’s only moderately down on the debut of Vinterberg’s last 
Danish-language film,The Hunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/29/the-hunt-review>, which began in 
2012 with £40,200 from 27 sites, plus £3,000 in previews. Also flying the flag 
in the arthouse sector is the rerelease of Stanley Kubrick’sBarry Lyndon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/barry-lyndon-review-stanley-kubrick-ryan-o-neal>
, with £22,500 from 20 venues, although a significant chunk of that comes from 
the flagship venue of London’s BFI Southbank. New releasesBorn to Be Blue

 andAuthor: The JT Leroy Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/author-jt-leroy-story-review-literary-hoax-laura-albert>
 failed to crack the Top 30, while relatively recent releases Chevalier,

takings are 34% up on the previous frame and also 66% up on the equivalent 
weekend from 2015, whenMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation

 off the top spot. The market delivered the fifth-highest takings from the past 
52 weekends. Cinema bookers hope that the summer bonanza is not over yet, since 
Friday seesthe arrival of Suicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/suicide-squad-summer-blockbusters-superhero-fatigue>
. On the one hand, this DC Comics property doesn’t have the brand value of 
Batman or Superman. On the other, Warner has seemingly orchestrated a brilliant 
press and marketing campaign, creating excitement for a bunch of renegade 
outlaws hitherto little known to broader audiences. And afterthe success of 
Fox/Marvel’s Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/14/deadpools-success-moves-us-one-step-closer-to-the-inevitable-total-geek-culture-domination>
 earlier this year, the pressure is on to deliver big box-office numbers. Other 
distributors are running scared, although counter-programming alternatives this 
weekend include the French romantic comedy Up for Love, starring Jean Dujardin, 
and a rerelease of Alex Cox’s Sid and Nancy, starring Gary Oldman.
