The rest of the BBC’s Christmas radio lineup is peppered with big names.

Christmas morning will be welcomed in on Radio 2 by Clare Balding with guests 
the archbishop of Westminster and comedian Barry Humphries – better known as 
Dame Edna Everage – who will present a two-hour festive edition of his 
Forgotten Musical Masterpieces later that evening.

The station will also broadcast Paul Gambaccini’s exploration of the 
friendship between the Beatles and Kenny Everett, incorporating archive audio 
of the comedian and radio DJ and members of the band, as well as new interviews.

Attenborough will occupy the Radio 3 evening slot on Christmas Day, telling 
the stories behind music he recorded while travelling the world. The Planet 
Earth narrator has been digging through recordings from places such as New 
Guinea, Borneo, Paraguay and Tonga, which he was inspired to begin collecting 
in the 1950s after working on The Song Hunter, which was presented by Alan 
Lomax and brought a host of traditional musicians from Britain and Ireland to 
TV for the first time.

“I’m delighted that the music I recorded, all over the world, half a century 
ago, is coming to light at last,” said Attenborough. “I’m enjoying listening to 
it very much and I hope the Radio 3 audience will enjoy it too, and the stories 
of how I met the players and singers who shared with me their fascinating and 
wonderful music.”
