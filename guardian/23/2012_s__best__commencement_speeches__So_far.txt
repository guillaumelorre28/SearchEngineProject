Assembled readers, fellow bloggers, distinguished friends …

First, let me say what a great honour it is to have been asked to write this 
blogpost about commencement speeches. Where I come from, there isn't really any 
equivalent to this quintessentially American phenomenon; and as a result, every 
year, thousands of young British people collect their degrees and head into the 
world in a dangerously uninspired state – not knowing, for example, whether or 
not they should say "yes" to life, or follow their hearts, or dare to be 
different.

With these lost souls in mind above all, let's review what we've learned from 
2012's speeches so far. By now, you'll have seenBarack Obama's 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPHJnHXEDq8&feature=player_embedded>, and maybe 
Mitt Romney's <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2HAluw63Q>, and perhaps even 
Neil Gaiman's <http://vimeo.com/42372767>, which went justifiably viral.

But what about the others?

Aaron Sorkin at Syracuse: "Make no mistake about it, you are dumb"

"You're a group of incredibly well-educated dumb people," explains the West 
Wing creator, who oddly chose not to deliver this speech to graduating students 
at Syracuse University, in upstate New York, while pacing down one of its 
corridors in an extended tracking shot.

"I was there. We all were there. You're barely functional. There are some 
screw-ups headed your way. I wish I could tell you that there was a trick to 
avoiding the screw-ups … but they're coming for ya. It's a combination of life 
being unpredictable, and you being super dumb."

Another piece of advice not so much expressed in this speech as embodied by 
it: if you come up with some clever one-liners in your TV scripts, feel free to 
recycle them in commencement speeches

Alice Cooper at the Musicians' Institute: "Apparently, chickens don't fly so 
much as they plummet"

The man known on his birth certificate as Vincent Furnier begins this speech 
with the observation that his being invited shows "a certain lack of judgment" 
on behalf of the Los Angeles Musicians' Institute. But it really doesn't: apart 
from the bit about almost shooting Elvis dead, it's a thoroughly classic genial 
commencement address.

"Whatever you do, avoid mediocrity. Mediocrity is your enemy," Cooper urges 
his audience. Instead, go out on a limb: you'll either be a big success or a 
terrible failure, but either is better than mediocrity. It's not that this is a 
bad message, exactly – it's just that it might be nice to hear it, now and 
again, from the non-millionaire, non-successful non-rock-stars.

Isn't it a little too easy to celebrate the risk of failure when, in your 
case, it happened to pay off so handsomely?

Oprah Winfrey at Spelman College: "You want to be in the driver's seat of your 
own life because if you're not, life will drive you"

With the exception of a powerful few of minutes near the beginning about the 
legacy of the civil rights movement, Oprah's speech is a tumbling waterfall of 
positive-thinking platitudes. But Oprah can be forgiven for this because she is 
Oprah, and the commencement speech is fundamentally the most Oprahesque of all 
rhetorical forms; it's thus a perfect match, and she wisely doesn't try to mess 
with the genre.

Quick summary: things that are good, according to Oprah, include persistence, 
goodwill, service, having a direction for your life, and knowing who you are. 
Things that are possible if you believe in yourself: all of them.

Tony Blair at Colby College: "Be a doer, not a critic"

Remember this guy? He's an old hand at commencement speeches 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6F6iGNpQX0>, which he uses to deliver a 
message that seems painfully susceptible to armchair psychoanalysis: that the 
future won't belong to "commentators, critics and cynics", but to those who 
"have confidence", who "wake up every morning with a sense of purpose", who get 
out there anddo things.

Regrettably, several moaning naysayers at Colby College in Maine seemed not to 
have heeded his point about not being a critic: his speech wasinterrupted at 
several points <http://www.colby.edu/news_events/commencement/2012/speaker/> by 
shouts of "warmonger" and "war criminal". One man (not Tony Blair) was arrested.

Oh, the usual: competition is good, dare to be a maverick, smartphones are 
making the world a more connected place. Included here mainly for the New York 
mayor's amusingly awkward attempts at call-and-response chants in the first few 
seconds.

Jane Lynch at Smith College: "Say 'yes and'"

The star of Glee does it the way it ought to be done: audience flattery, mixed 
with actual humour.

"Smith women have transformed cuisine, spearheaded social movements, created 
great literature and, in the case of my friend Piper, class of '92, even gone 
to prison! But damnit – when a Smithie goes to prison – she writes a clever and 
compelling book about it!" Lynch steps onto thin ice with her angle, which 
involvesapplying the lessons of improv comedy to living a worthwhile life 
<http://www.smith.edu/events/commencement_speech2012.php> – 
motivational-speaker types arealways making this tired analogy – but actually, 
she pulls it off brilliantly:

"'Yes and' is the vital and only rule of improvisation … if I say to you 
'Stick 'em up!' and you say 'That's not a gun, that's your finger!', we've got 
nowhere to go … Life is just a big extended improvisation. Embrace the ever 
changing, ever evolving world with the best rule I've ever found. Say 'Yes 
And.'"

… but enough about your parents"

The NBC news anchor has been developing an unexpected sideline in properly 
funny comedy <http://nymag.com/news/media/brian-williams-2011-5/>, some of 
which is on show here, though it gets a bit lost in his efforts to make A Big 
Meaningful Point. Half of this speech is an entertaining tour through 
Williams's own story of academic failure; the rest of it is a box-checking list 
of rousing American cliches: the greatness of the space program, the importance 
of the military, the importance of ambition.

Not wanting to suggest that his listeners must necessarily build spaceships or 
become soldiers, Williams is reduced to urging them towards some kind of 
non-specific but nationally significant action:

"Please: take us somewhere. Keep us moving, push us somewhere, make us better."

Ira Glass at Goucher College: "Commencement speakers give doomed advice which 
is then promptly ignored"

It should come as no surprise that the host of This American Life gets all 
meta on his Baltimore audience. "The central mission of the commencement speech 
is itself ridiculous: to inspire at a moment which needs no inspiration," he 
points out.

"Look at yourselves at this moment. Something incredible is happening to you 
right now. The whole world is opening to you. You guys have been in school your 
entire lives. You have completed something difficult that took persistence and 
wilfulness, and probably you questioned yourselves again and again … What can 
words add to that except delay the moment you get your diploma?"

His real message: that you'll do mediocre work as part of any life path worth 
pursuing, and that you'll often suspect you're doing it all wrong.

"You will question your own choices, your relationships, your jobs, your 
friends … that's totally OK. That's totally normal. If that happens, you're 
doing it right."

Which is subtler than Alice Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alicecooper>. Although, then again, so are 
most things.
