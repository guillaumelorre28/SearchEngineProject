Channel 4’s coverage of its last Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> went out on a high with a 
peak of 10 million viewers on Saturday, the race’s biggest audience since the 
BBC last aired it in 2012.

The Grand National, which was spectacularly won by 33-1 long shot Rule the 
World, drew a five-minute peak audience of 10 million. The race attracted a 
15-minute peak audience of 9.6 million viewers.

This is the highest since Channel 4 took over the rights to air the Grand 
National from the BBC in 2012 (five-minute peak 10.89m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/16/grand-national-bbc>). 


The race, which was moved an hour later to 5.15pm in order to boost viewers

, is the broadcaster’s second biggest audience of the last decade after the 
Paralympics opening ceremony in 2012.

ITV has snapped up the TV rights to air the Grand National from next year.
