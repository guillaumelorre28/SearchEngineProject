Dolly magazine will publish its last hard-copy issue next month after 46 years 
acting as a bible for millions of Australian teenage girls.


The 5 December issue will be the last one in print form, but the title will 
continue as an online platform for 14- to 17-year-old girls, its publisher, 
Bauer Media, announced on Wednesday.

First published in 1970, Dolly has provided a mix of celebrity news, fashion, 
beauty and medical advice to generations of women. The Dolly Doctor feature has 
informed millions of girls keen for advice on everything from periods to 
contraception and acne.

A former Dolly editor who steered the magazine for six years, Lisa Wilkinson, 
said she was saddened by the news.

Once a key part of the late Kerry Packer’s media empire, Dolly has been 
another victim of the digital revolution – as so much of its content is now 
available free online.


It has been a long, slow demise for Dolly as a print product: its editorial 
staff weremerged with Cleo’s three years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/04/dolly-and-cleo-staff-merger-the-end-of-an-era-says-lisa-wilkinson>
 – before its sister magazine was axed entirely 10 months ago. Dolly then 
became a bimonthly magazine but that couldn’t save it.

The chief executive of Bauer Media, Nick Chan, said Dolly readers engaged with 
the content on social media through their smartphones and it was “no longer 
feasible to continue publishing the magazine on a regular basis”.

“Dolly has played a part in the lives of many Australians over the years, 
which is why we’re delighted its outstanding content continues, but now 
exclusively on the channels today’s teens prefer to interact with most,” he 
said.


Bauer says dolly.com.au <http://www.dolly.com.au/> is growing and more than 
90% of its audience reads it on a smartphone. The website is expected to hit 
1.2m visits in November.


Dolly’s editor, Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke, said earlier that readers enjoyed 
the longer reads on celebrity, lifestyle and relationships that the magazine 
provided.


Bauer, a German media group, has closed dozens of titles since buying ACP 
Magazines <https://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines> from Nine Entertainment 
for $500m in 2012. These include Top Gear, Zoo, Madison, Grazia, Burke’s 
Backyard, BBC Good Food, Cleo and FHM.


To celebrate its 40th year Dolly produced a gallery featuring some of its 
covers 
<http://www.dolly.com.au/celebrity/dolly-through-the-decades-the-70s-10361> and 
content through the years, including cover shoots with lambs, a look at the 
pros and cons of wearing a bra and advice on how to keep a guy.
