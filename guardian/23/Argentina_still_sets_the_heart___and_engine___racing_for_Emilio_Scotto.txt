I travelled 735,000km in 10 years. This is almost as much as travelling from 
Earth to the moon and back. Starting in 1985 and arriving back in Argentina on 
2 April 1995, I circled the globe twice on a Honda Gold Wing 1100 motorcycle 
after quitting my job. I had only $300 in my pocket. I had never left my 
country before, and I was embarking on a mind-blowing journey. My motorcycle 
was my main companion, along with the countless souls I met along the road. 
Muhammad Ali gave me a $50 bill. Pope John Paul II blessed me. I shared 
thoughts on travelling on Earth and to the moon with astronaut Buzz Aldrin. I 
used 13 passports of 64 pages each.

I did not choose my motorcycle. She picked me. Once, a colleague asked me to 
come along to see bikes in Buenos Aires. When I stepped into the place, I saw 
through the glass door of the dealer’s office a photograph of an alluring black 
motorcycle with fairing, a radio, an antenna, suitcases on both sides and a 
sign that read: “The world is yours, on two wheels.” It became my motto. I had 
never ridden a motorcycle but I knew it was the one. I called it the Black 
Princess.

Money was too scarce for me to do any travelling when I was a child. I was 
born in Buenos Aires to a couple aged 17 and 18. My first adventure was in 
central Argentina, in the foothills of the green Sierras Chicas, in Cordoba 
province. I was four. There was a thread of water falling from a 15-metre-high 
stone wall into a pond. It then flowed through the grass and disappeared off to 
the horizon. I remember looking at the thread and pondering how far it went, 
and how far I could go.

Deep in the Amazon I met 50-year-old Pedro, a gold miner and a fugitive. He 
was as wise as a Jedi Master. When I told him I was not stopping by Santarém, a 
drowsy port town with white-sand river beaches in northern Brazil, he asked: 
“How does one pick a place and eliminate the others? How do you know that a 
place will not teach something?” Since then, I strove not to leave one single 
island, atoll, town or person behind.

Diving with whales off Puerto Madryn in Patagonia is one of the best 
experiences I have had in Argentina.They migrate to this area from Antarctica 
every year between June and December, their breeding season. The Valdes 
peninsula is one of the best whale-watching spots in South America and aUnesco 
world heritage site <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/937> for marine mammals such 
as southern right whales.

 Rainbow - or door to another dimension - in Patagonia 
I saw a sign that read 'The world is yours, on two wheels.' It became my motto

Patagonia <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/patagonia> often feels surreal. 
I once saw a rainbow so big it seemed to be the door to a different dimension. 
Walking along the deserted beaches ofPatagonia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/patagonia>’s Cabo Vírgenes at kilometre 0 
of Route 40 (which runs parallel with the Andes for about 5,000km) teaches you 
the meaning of true solitude.

There are some great places in the north of Argentina, too. The Quebrada de 
las Flechas (“gorge of the arrows”), also on Route 40, is extraordinary for its 
angled, pointed rock formations. The famousIguazu falls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/30/iguazu-falls-argentina-brazil-rainforest>
, both in Argentina and Brazil, have to be visited, too.

At Salta, which is nicknamed “the beautiful”, visitors should try knife-cut 
meat empanadas –carne cortada a cuchillo – and spend a few days in a family 
hacienda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/nov/28/south-american-ranches-argentina-chile>
 rather than a hotel. Some of them, in the outskirts of the town, are more than 
100 years old. They usually serve a fantastic breakfast with fresh homemade 
bread.

Two hours’ drive north of Salta is Purmamarca, with its Cerro de Siete Colores 
(hill of seven colours) and Inca past. It is part of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, 
a 95-mile-long valley used as a major economic and cultural route for at least 
10,000 years, and now aUnesco world heritage site 
<http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1116>. You have to spend at least a night in the 
Spanish neocolonial-styledHotel Manantial del Silencio 
<http://www.hotelmanantialdelsilencio.com/> (double room from £95 B&B) with its 
beautiful interior and views of the colourful hill.

I believe that God decides people’s jobs. I got to be a traveller and I will 
commit to doing it for the rest of my life. I am positive that humans were born 
to grow wings, not roots.
