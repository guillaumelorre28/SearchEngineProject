If Kazakh politicians get their wish, the capital city will be renamed to 
honour the country’s first and only president, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The suggestion to rename Astana was buried in a declaration

 unanimously passed by both chambers of parliament on Wednesday.

On the surface, the declaration was to mark the forthcoming 25th anniversary 
of Kazakhstan’s independence. But reading past the tributes to Nazarbayev’s 
“outstanding service”, the declaration’s final paragraph calls for renaming the 
capital and other important facilities across the country after theleader of 
the Republic ofKazakhstan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kazakhstan>.

However, that decision rests with the 76-year-old president himself, the 
Constitutional Council head was quoted as saying.

Igor Rogov said Nazarbayev could either call a referendum or send the matter 
to parliament for debate. “I cannot say whether the president will make such a 
decision or not,” he said.

There was no immediate comment from the office of Nazarbayev, who has ruled 
Kazakhstan since 1989, first as Communist party leader then, after independence 
in 1991, as president.

But Kuanysh Sultanov MP said he expected the president to respond to the 
initiative within weeks. Another parliament deputy, Pavel Kazantsev, said he 
believed the capital would be renamed by the end of the year.

Initiatives to cement Nazarbayev’s legacy are not uncommon in Kazakhstan. In 
2010, parliament bestowed the title of “elbasy” (leader of the nation) on 
Nazarbayev, granting him and his family lifelong immunity from any civic or 
criminal prosecution.

While Nazarbayev formally opposed the bill, it automatically became law under 
a legal clause.

Last week, days before the passage of the most recent declaration, a 
10,000-tenge banknote was introduced featuring Nazarbayev’s image. It will go 
into circulation on 1 December, a fortnight before Independence Day on 16 
December.

It is not clear what names might be considered for the capital. “Nursultan” 
has become one of the most popular baby names in Kazakhstan in recent years 
and, according to official statistics, in 2015 the president had more than 
38,000 namesakes. “Nazarbayev” or “Elbasy” would also be possibilities.

Astana has been renamed several times since it was founded in 1830 as the 
settlement of Akmoly. In 1832, it became the town of Akmolinsk. In1961 it was 
renamed Tselinograd, then Akmola in 1992.

In December 1997, the government made the city the capital of the country, 
replacing Almaty. In May 1998, it was renamed Astana, a Kazakh word that means 
“the capital”.
