There are two things you should know about the upcoming movie Monster Trucks 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQrj2M-2Uiw>. First, a four-year-old came up 
with the idea. Second, it looks set to be a gigantic financial disaster, with 
Paramount already taking a$115m writedown 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/paramount-takes-115-million-write-down-for-movie-that-isnt-released-yet-1474577856>
 on the film. So what happened?

There are two possible explanations: a) Asking a four-year-old to be the 
primary creative force behind a big movie is an act of almost obscene hubris 
and the project was doomed to failure from the outset; or b) They asked the 
wrong kid.

Convinced the latter was true, the Guardian assembled a crack team of children 
in its HQ, shut them in a room, and told them that they couldn’t leave until 
they’d created a blockbuster. Here are their pitches, which we then handed to 
Oscar-nominated producer Stephen Woolley (The Crying Game, Interview with a 
Vampire, Carol). Brace yourself, Hollywood.

Ben: The Laser Monster from Not Space
“The laser monsters come from a really strange planet very far from Earth 
that’s not in space, and they laser people with their 100 eyes. They came to 
Earth because they have double-boosters on their feet. The people win in the 
end because they find a big gun. It’s bigger than the laser monster and the 
laser monster is bigger than a mountain. I’m thirsty.”

Producer Stephen Woolley <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-woolley>
: “Ben, this has Hollywood potential – especially Big Gun. I’m afraid I 
couldn’t raise the budget for this, though. Feels like a $150million movie.”

Ezra: The Christmas Mountain
“There’s a mountain and it’s really cold, so he has a jumper on. He has a lily 
pad on his eye. He’s a nice monster, because he lets frogs go in his eyes. He 
grows when it’s Christmas and now he’s as big as anything. He doesn’t do much, 
but he’s bigger than the Shard and high-fives elephants. I’m bigger than 
anything. I’m bigger than the Earth. I live on Saturn.”

SW: “With the right CGI effects and some claymation, this could be a Nick Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/03/how-we-made-wallace-and-gromit>
 film. In fact, it could be a British hit – especially as it has Christmas in 
the title!”

James: Pokémon Hulk v Marshall the Fire Pup
“Pokémon Hulk is a million centimetres tall. His special move is splashing 
people with mud. He’s fighting Marshall fromPaw Patrol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/05/paw-patrol-no-job-too-big-parents-christmas-must-have-toy>
. Pokémon Hulk punches Marshall in the face, then he kicks him in the bum. 
Marshall squirts out fire. He’s a baddie! Then Marshall runs away, then he 
dies, then he comes back to life, then he puts himself on fire.”

SW: “This is 18-certificate stuff. The excessive violence won’t get past the 
brand owners. But Mel Gibson might like it, if you can give a religious ending!”

Tess: The Polar Bear and his Mummy
“A polar bear drives a car. He’s half polar bear and half box and half chip. 
He also has human hands. He’s not friendly, because he’s a witch polar bear. 
He’s a witch-chip polar bear and he eats humans. His mummy is half elephant and 
she’s nice and she doesn’t eat people. She’s sad about her son and she uses her 
long tail to tie him up. The mummy polar bear is a hero. Her tail is made out 
of teeth.”

SW: “Perfect as a European co-production. Can see it fitting a Spanish 
director –Guillermo Del Toro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/03/guillermo-del-toro-bleak-house-home-lacma-exhibit>
 would love this! Keep the budget down though.”

Polly: The Snow Witch
“Melanie the witch turns people into snowpeople. People have to stop Melanie 
the witch by destroying her with her own powers. They turn her into a snowman. 
There’s also Giant Spider. She turns people into little snowmen. When you’re a 
snowman, you just melt.”

SW: “Another huge concept. Giant spider makes the poster exciting but Raymond 
Briggs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/07/raymond-briggs-snowman-interview-1978>
 has perhaps cornered this market.”

Timmy: The House That Says Yes
“There are stones with faces called Austin, Tim and Ralph. They fight a snow 
monster and the snow monster melts. He melts because he’s made out of snow and 
it’s good because he’s a baddie. There’s a house that talks, too. It’s a happy 
house. It says, ‘Yes.’ It goes, ‘Yeeeeeaah!’ I’m going under the table.”

SW: “Perhaps Mick and the rest of the Rolling Stones could make a cameo. Given 
the obsession with reality TV andKirstie Allsopp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/kirstie-allsopp>’s property shows, 
this has Brit movie written all over it. Especially the tactical retreat at the 
end.”

Ethan: The Scribbling Monsters
“These are monsters that throw scribbles in your eyes. They lived underground 
for 100 years and now they’re here. Then there’s a dot monster and the dots 
aren’t attached. They’re going to Australia and they’re going to kill you. And 
this monster puts cannonballs in your eyes – in your eyes! It sneak up on 
people and then they’re dead. And then the next monster lives under paper and 
it bangs on people and then they’re dead. And this one punches you and you’re 
dead on the floor and you can never get up.”

SW: “The violence in this one makes me feel like the main market for this is 
South Korea. Perfect for Yeon Sang-ho, who directedTrain to Busan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/train-to-busan-review-korean-zombie-thriller-yeon-sang-ho>
, although the Australian connection gives a great co-funding opportunity. 
Thanks to all the four-year-old pitchers. For me, The Christmas Mountain is the 
winner, the one I’d green-light first.”
