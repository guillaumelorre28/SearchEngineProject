An ad for bookmaker Ladbrokes <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ladbrokes> 
featuring the popular superhero Iron Man has been banned over fears it would 
appeal to children.

The email promoting the Ladbrokes casino featured an image of Iron Man and the 
text: “Enjoy this exclusive Ladbrokes welcome offer withIron Man 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/iron-man-3>.”

Ladbrokes said all its email offers were sent to registered customers or those 
known to be over 18.

It said the image was “adult-themed” and reflected popular culture, adding 
that evidence indicated that followers of Marvel comics and superheroes were 
predominantly adults.

The bookmaker argued that this was supported by data on attendance at 
Comic-Con events and Facebook demographics for the Marvel brand.

The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
noted in its ruling upholding a complaint against the email that gambling ads 
must not be likely to be of particular appeal to children, especially by 
reflecting or being associated with youth culture.

The ASA said it understood that the email was only sent to over-18s, but it 
nevertheless should not be of particular appeal to young people.

It said that as all Facebook users must declare themselves to be at least 13 
years old, younger children were therefore excluded from the sample.

The ASA said: “We considered those younger children were likely to be the 
primary audience for Iron Man action figures and related merchandise, which we 
understood were widely available at toy retailers.

“We understood that Iron Man was a popular character that would appeal to many 
adults but considered its comic book nature, and the availability of various 
related toys, meant it was likely to have particular appeal to children and 
young people.

“We therefore concluded that the ad breached the code.”
