, ditching what could have been the biggest flotation in London this year.

Misys <https://www.theguardian.com/business/misys> had already slashed the 
value of its mooted £4.5bn float by £1bn last week due to market nerves.

The company said on Thursday: “Despite encouraging institutional support Misys 
Group Limited has decided not to proceed with its potential initial public 
offering at the current time due to market conditions.”

The news came as the boss of O2’s Spanish owner Telefonica cast doubt on the 
UK mobile firm’s planned £10bn IPO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/o2s-possible-ipo-depends-weakening-state-uk-economy>
. Mark Evans said the company was “prepared but not committed” to the float and 
that it would decide next year, depending on market conditions and the state of 
the UK economy.

As possibility of hard Brexit has increased since last month’s Conservative 
party conference, sending the pound tumbling, investors have become more 
concerned about the outlook for UK companies. Sterling has lost 18% of its 
value since the referendum in June.

Several companies have cancelled or postponed IPOs, including the fitness

Biffa, the waste management company, recently cut the price of its flotation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/waste-disposal-firm-biffa-cuts-flotation-price-brexit-jitters>
 after failing to get enough investor support.

Misys was delisted four years ago when it was bought by the US private equity 
firm Vista, which merged Misys with Turaz, previously a software division of 
Thomson Reuters.

When it unveiled its IPO plans three weeks ago, chief executive Nadeem Syed 
brushed off the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. He insisted it was 
right time for the business to return to the stock market, because of the 
sweeping regulatory changes facing its banking and financial services 
customers. The firm says it is cheaper for banks to use its software than to 
develop their own technology.

The London-based company had planned to use the £500m it expected to raise 
from the float to pay debts. Misys was founded in 1979 as a computer systems 
supplier to UK insurance brokers and debuted on theLondon Stock Exchange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup> in 1990.
