If Donald Trump’s presidency has a house publication, it will not be the 
165-year-oldNew York Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times>, 
which Trump attacked again on Twitter on Sunday. It will surely be Breitbart, a 
rightwing opinion and news website formed in 2007 that one former editor has 
described as “Trump Pravda”.

America’s president-elect has now appointed the site’s executive chairman, 
Steve Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker known for “screaming matches” with 
staff, as his White House strategy chief.

The fast-growing opinion and news website has become a rallying point for 
Trump’s nationalist, sometimes racist and often angry “alt-right” support base. 
It campaigned hard for Trump throughout the primaries, waging war against the 
candidacy of the Florida senator Marco Rubio, before becoming Trump’s voicebox 
during the general election.

The Washington website already has outposts in Jerusalem, London, Los Angeles 
and Texas, and expansion is planned into Germany and France, where it is 
expected to support Marine Le Pen’s Front National.

“So much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names,” 
said the site’s editor-in-chief, Alexander Marlow on Sunday, following Bannon’s 
appointment. “And then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a 
president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy and 
savour.”

During the election campaign, Hillary Clinton warned her supporters of the 
alt-right’s “emerging racist ideology” and “the de facto merger between 
Breitbart and the Trump campaign … [which] represents a landmark achievement 
for this group, a fringe element that has effectively taken over the Republican 
party”.

And indeed, white supremacist leaders in the US were delighted on Monday that 
Bannon had secured a White House appointment. According to the Southern Poverty 
Law Centre’s Hatewatch report, Ken Reed, the national director of the neo-Nazi 
group the Aryan Renaissance Society, responded to Bannon’s hire with a Facebook 
post: “Can you say WINNING boys and girls???” He followed with 
“#WhiteLivesMatter”.

With Trump continuing to use his Twitter account to vent on everything from 
protesters to the reporting of his policy on nuclear weapons, Breitbart is now 
poised to become a key outlet for White House communications.

“It will be as close as we are ever going to have – hopefully – to a state-run 
media enterprise,” Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman and now a critic 
of the website, told the New York Times at the weekend.

Breitbart’s webpages foam with opinion and news divided into themes that 
appeal directly to the concerns and fears of its rightwing readers. They attack 
“big government”, “big Hollywood” and “big journalism”. One story from August 
about plans by Bill Kristol, a Republican considering blocking Trump’s path to 
the White House, waspublished under the headline: “Bill Kristol: Republican 
spoiler, renegade Jew” 
<http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/15/bill-kristol-republican-spoiler-renegade-jew/>
.

On Monday there was a video of a white man being beaten in the road 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/10/you-voted-trump-shock-video/>
 by a black man while onlookers jeered: “Don’t vote Trump”, plus a report about 
university students in Washington DC burning a stars and stripes flag.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has become a regular Breitbart columnist and his 
former aide Raheem Kassam also worked for the site. Both met Trump at his 5th 
Avenue penthouse on Saturday night.

Appointment of 'white nationalist' Steve Bannon must be reversed, critics 
declare

Bannon has said Breitbart trades in “original reporting untainted by 
establishment spin”, but the tone is angrier than that. It regularly features 
“shock jock” articles including “Would you rather your child had feminism or 
cancer?” and “Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy”. Its “wear the 
#war” merchandise section sells T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan “under 
attack all the time” and featuring crossed guns.

It is an ethos carried forward from its founder Andrew Breitbart, who died 
suddenly in 2012, aged 43 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/01/andrew-breitbart-dies-at-43>. 
Shortly before he died, he recorded a video message that pledged “war” against 
the liberal establishment. But according to Angelo Carusone, executive 
vice-president at Media Matters, a non-profit research centre which analyses 
rightwing media, Breitbart “would have hated the current iteration of his own 
website” as “he was no racist”.

Carusone first became aware of this “hip new rightwing news outfit advancing 
misinformation” six years ago. “I consider Breitbart to be a disreputable 
website,” he said. “It’s a propaganda tool advancing the ethno-nationalist 
movement.”

Breitbart’s US audience has more than doubled from 7.4 million users in 
September 2014 to 15.8 million this September. That is still much smaller than 
the Washington Post and the New York Times, which recorded 83 million and 88 
million respectively, according to ComScore, although figures are expected to 
be higher for November.

“Breitbart has been hugely significant in the US,” said Matthew Elliott, the 
former chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign in the UK. “Virtually every 
newspaper endorsed Clinton and, outside of Fox News, all of the broadcasters 
laughed Trump out of court. In that climate, there was a market for a website 
that put over a more Trumpish view of politics.

“It’s the voice of the angry right. No other media outlet has reflected this. 
In the UK we have a more plural press and you can make a choice within the 
mainstream media.”

Bannon’s leadership of the site has been strongly criticised by Ben Shapiro, 
the site’s former editor-at-large, who left in March. In anarticle he 
republished on Monday 
<http://www.dailywire.com/news/8441/i-know-trumps-new-campaign-chairman-steve-bannon-ben-shapiro#>
, he claimed: “Breitbart openly embraced the white supremacist alt-right … He 
[Bannon] used his role as Breitbart CEO to turn the outlet into Trump Pravda, 
creating a stepping stone to close connection with Trump.

“Breitbart publicly burned bridges with everyone to maintain its Trump 
loyalty. That was Bannon, a scorched-earth personal opportunist.”

What do Bannon and Priebus tell us about Trump's coming reign? | Richard Wolffe

Bannon has been accused of being personally antisemitic in court documents 
from 2007. His ex-wife said he did not want their daughters attending the 
Archer school for girls – a private school in Los Angeles – because he did not 
want the girls going to school with Jews. According the court filings, she 
stated: “He said he doesn’t like Jews and that he doesn’t like the way they 
raise their kids to be ‘whiny brats’.”

A spokeswoman told US media that Bannon denied the allegation. “At the time, 
Mr Bannon never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer 
for their middle-school and high-school education.”

But in the hours since his appointment, it was his stewardship of Breitbart 
that was in the public spotlight. On Monday morning, Trump’s newly appointed 
chief of staff,Reince Priebus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/reince-priebus>, was asked on MSNBC about 
“concerns about Steve Bannon because of the Breitbart connections”. “He was a 
force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw, all the time,” he 
replied. “I’ve only seen a generous, hospitable, wise person to work with.”

Newt Gingrich, tipped as a possible secretary of state, defended Bannon on 
Sunday on CBS. Asked about claims that Trump’s victory in the primaries “gave 
unprecedented visibility to the alt-right, a small but vocal fringe of white 
supremacists and antisemites and self-proclaimed fascists”, Gingrich said it 
was “garbage”. “You get this all these smears of Steve Bannon,” he said. “Steve 
Bannon was a naval officer. He was a managing partner of Goldman Sachs. He was 
a Hollywood movie producer.”

To Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart’s technology editor, who was permanently 
banned by Twitter for his role in the online abuse of Ghostbusters actor Leslie 
Jones, Breitbart is engaged in “a culture war” with liberals. “With the 
cowardly suspension of my account, Twitter has confirmed itself as a safe space 
for Muslim terrorists and Black Lives Matter extremists, but a no-go zone for 
conservatives,” he said following his suspension in July. “Like all acts of the 
totalitarian regressive left, this will blow up in their faces, netting me more 
adoring fans.”

When asked how he, Breitbart and other sites mobilised the alt-right 
community, Yiannopoulos said: “I don’t pander to anyone. I just gave the 
alt-right a fair hearing. That was considered heretical by the 
virtue-signalling leftist media, so now they call me a white nationalist and 
antisemite, despite the fact that I’m a gay Jew with a black boyfriend.

“To the American media, anyone who is not a far-left social justice activist 
is a racist and sexist. This has had a predictable consequence: no one cares 
about their name-calling and hysteria any more.

“Trump’s voters, and I would wager in fact most of America, are repulsed by 
the Lena Dunham, Black Lives Matter, third-wave feminist, communist, ‘kill all 
white men’ politics of the progressive left. Which is in large part why this 
election went the way it did. Some of us saw it coming a while ago. Most 
didn’t.”

The UK anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate 
<http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/> has been watching Breitbart closely. “Under 
Bannon, Breitbart has provided a key online resource for the loose collection 
of ultra-conservatives, neo-Nazis and internet trolls calling themselves the 
alt-right,” said David Lawrence, a Hope Not Hate researcher. “Following the 
racially motivatedmassacre of nine [African American] worshippers in a South 
Carolina church last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/18/charleston-church-shooting-nine-dead-after-hate-attack>
, Breitbart published a piece entitled ‘Hoist it high and proud: the 
Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage’.”

On Breitbart’s UK site, its London editor James Delingpole chimed with Trump’s 
climate change denials with the headline: “Climate change: the hoax that costs 
us $4bn a day.” Delingpole claims that “climate change is the biggest scam in 
the history of the world – a $1.5tn-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer”.

Delingpole has been described as a “figure of fun” by Bob Ward, policy 
director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the 
Environment <http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/>and at the London School 
of Economics. “He has no scientific credibility, he uses inflammatory language, 
and resorts to extreme statements.” Although he attacks climate scientists, 
Delingpole admits to having little scientific knowledge.

In a BBC2 programme about climate change, he told Nobel prize winning 
scientist Sir Paul Nurse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/24/james-delingpole-tv-interview>
: “It is not my job to sit down and read peer-reviewed papers, because I simply 
haven’t got the time … I am an interpreter of interpretations.”
