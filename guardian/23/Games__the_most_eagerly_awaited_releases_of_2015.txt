It may not have had a cash-intensive PR blitzkrieg, but The Witcher 2 – with 
its story quietly moulding itself around your actions and The Witcher himself 
refusing to conform to genre stereotype – generated endless word of mouth. This 
outing will be larger, prettier and even more open-ended.

A steampunk vision of Victorian London where monsters roam, ready to be hacked 
to pieces by a shadowy organisation called The Order. It might involve a lot of 
coal-fired super-technology, but its setting and devotion to storytelling 
already stand out.

Like last year’s Ground Zeroes, this will put grizzled antihero Snake into an 
open world, letting you approach objectives however you like. Snake now smokes 
E-cigarettes and is once again voiced by Kiefer Sutherland to no great effect, 
but judging by Ground Zeroes, this should be dazzling.

Nintendo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> turns its hand to 
multiplayer shooters with Splatoon, in which you fire volleys of brightly 
coloured paint at other players and also at the environment, with the team 
managing to paint-spatter the biggest floor area winning.

Set in pastoral England in the mid-1980s, this is an alternative take on the 
apocalypse, which for once doesn’t appear to feature either guns or zombies. As 
you might expect from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Dear 
Esther, it looks thought-provoking and eerily atmospheric.

More deliciously wry story-driven adventures for Nathan Drake, the (naturally) 
American descendant of Sir Francis. The subtitle’s grim implication that this 
might be his swansong is about as likely as someone with a money-printing 
machine deciding to destroy it in a controlled explosion.

By the same developer as the exquisite Limbo, Inside looks as though it could 
be even more spine-chilling and emotionally affecting. Taking place after a 
cataclysm turns almost everyone into shuffling automaton-like zombies, you have 
to blend in with the mindless horde as well as avoiding faster-moving beasts.

Build your own Mario <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mario> levels 
using a tool set that makes good use of the Wii U’s touch screen. Originally 
intended for use by Nintendo’s level designers, the richness and flexibility of 
this offering gives you access to enemies, obstacles and level furniture to 
create your own side-scrolling platform games.

More end-of-civilisation hijinks, as you team up with other players to patrol 
a decaying city in search of baddies to end. Ubisoft has had a few hiccups 
recently, so this will no doubt receive the full benefit of obsessive web 
forum-based scrutiny.

Quantum Break’s tale of a time travel experiment that goes tragically awry is 
being jointly made as an episodic video game and TV series. The last attempt at 
this, Defiance, wasn’t a total bust, but wasn’t great; could this one be the 
breakthrough?
