Local authority pension funds are planning to back a shareholder resolution 
calling for an independent review ofSports Direct’s  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international>treatment of 
employees.

The retail group will hold its annual general meeting on 7 September in 
Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where shareholders will vote on atrade union-backed 
plan to commission an investigation into working practices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/sports-direct-agm-to-vote-on-review-of-firms-treatment-of-workers>
 that will report back within six months.

Last week, the company said it would publish an “independent report” on 
working practices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/sports-direct-vows-to-publish-report-into-staff-working-conditions>
 put together by its lawyers, RPC. It said the report would review and report 
on an internal investigation announced last Decemberafter the Guardian’s 
revelations about treatment of staff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/how-sports-direct-responded-to-guardian-investigation>
 at its Shirebrook warehouse.

The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said it was supporting the 
Unite resolution, briefing member funds that the company’s review, led by 
Sports Direct’s majority shareholder and founderMike Ashley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/mike-ashley>, was not independent. It 
added that RPC’s report “would just rubber-stamp the company’s version of 
affairs”.

“LAPFF’s hope is that an independent human capital strategy review will 
rectify any workplace practices deemed inappropriate and will help Sports 
Direct to move forward from the reputational and financial damage it has 
suffered,” said LAPFF’s chairman, councillor Kieran Quinn.


“LAPFF’s view is that responsible business practices by companies lead to 
sustainable returns for investors over the long term. We are worried that this 
view is not shared by Sports Direct.”

The Trade Union Share Owners group, which represents £1bn of pension funds and 
worked with Unite and Sports Direct shareholders including the Unison and TUC 
pension funds to put forward the resolution, said RPC “lacks relevant expertise 
in employment and industrial relations practice”.


Sports Direct’s board has advised shareholders to vote against the resolution 
as it had already asked RPC to undertake a review. In its recommendation, it 
said: “The board therefore considers the action called for by this resolution 
to be an unnecessary distraction that would duplicate the important work that 
is already under way.”

Sports Direct has come under pressure to reform its working practices and 
corporate governance as its sales performance and share price have suffered 
followingdamning revelations about its treatment of store and warehouse workers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay>
.

The calls for change got louder this week as it emerged that Sports Direct 
pays an obscure company owned by Ashley’s brother to deliver online orders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/sports-direct-investors-attack-deal-with-mike-ashleys-brother>
 outside the UK.

One of Sports Direct’s top 10 shareholders said the arrangement with John 
Ashley did not look good, while Royal London Asset Management said it had lost 
confidence in the retailer’s directors to protect the interests of investors 
other than its founder.

Leading shareholders had already told the Guardian they were considering 
voting against board reappointments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/sports-direct-large-shareholders-may-vote-against-chair-at-agm>
. A leading advisory group has recommended that Sports Direct shareholders 
should vote against the reelection of the company’s chairman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/sports-direct-agm-shareholders-vote-against-board-pirc-mike-ashley>
 Keith Hellawell, and Mike Ashley.

In a note to clients, Pensions <https://www.theguardian.com/money/pensions> 
and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said under Hellawell’s leadership 
Sports Direct’s board had “consistently failed to address the employment 
practices issues raised by some shareholders and trade unions that have also 
been criticised by a parliamentary select committee report”.

Sports Direct has commissioned an external evaluation of its board of 
directors, following criticism of the retailer’s corporate governance.

More than 28% of independent shareholders did not back Hellawell at last 
year’s annual meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/sports-direct-investors-revolt-against-chairman-and-pay-policy>
, including the well-respected Standard Life. New rules mean he must now win 
their support, rather than relying on the vote of Ashley, the company’s founder 
who owns a 55% stake.
