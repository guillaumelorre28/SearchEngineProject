Unparalleled queen of the curve and conjuror of sinuous, billowing forms, the 
maverick architectZaha Hadid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/zaha-hadid> has died aged 65.

Over her 30-year career, the Iraqi-born, London-based designer developed a 
style more recognisable, and more imitated, than any of her contemporaries, 
transforming what began as world of dreamy abstract paintings into a global 
brand for daring art galleries and experimental opera houses that now dot the 
globe from Baku to Guangzhou.

In her best buildings, the laws of physics appear momentarily suspended. Walls 
melt into floors, ceilings ripple and bulge, facades dissolve into perforated 
skins and flowing veils, transporting the visitor to another dimension. They 
can feel like sublime landscapes, sculpted by an irresistible geological force.

can be a thrilling experience, leaving you in thrall to the feats of structural 
gymnastics on show.

On other occasions, the ambitious schemes dreamed up on planet Zaha struggle 
when they crash down to earth and are forced to meet reality. Her first built 
work of note,a small fire station the Vitra furniture campus 
<http://www.archdaily.com/112681/ad-classics-vitra-fire-station-zaha-hadid> in 
Weil am Rhein, Germany, famously sent its users round the bend, its wayward 
walls and aggressive angles driving the firemen to distraction.

Nor have the sloping surfaces of the Maxxi

historic neighbour with the same thuggish inelegance as herSerpentine Sackler

 does in London. For all her wonders, it is fair to say there were an equal 
number of blunders.

At the time of her death, Hadid was one of the most sought-after architects in 
the world, perhaps even the best known living architect. She had a portfolio 
brimming with ongoing mega-projects, from the World Cup stadium in Qatar to a 
clutch of towers and cultural projects in China, Russia, Mexico and Miami 
(where she died suddenly of a heart attack after contracting bronchitis), as 
well as a line ofluxury homeware in Harrods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/sep/18/zaha-hadid-luxury-homeware-collection-harrods>
. Creator of an entire“parametric” universe beyond buildings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/may/23/zaha-hadid-design-gallery>
, she designed a handbag for Fendi, vases for Lalique, and a perfume bottle for 
Donna Karan, as well as the obligatory luxury yacht and even araunchy range of 
swimwear 
<http://www.designboom.com/design/zaha-hadid-swimwear-by-viviona-2014-collection-3-29-2014/>
.

But her feted starchitect status wasn’t easily won.

After graduating from London’s Architectural Association in 1977, having first 
studied mathematics in Beirut, she remained a “paper architect” for years. She 
produced intricate paintings and exquisite paper relief sculptures of fractured 
landscapes and skewed perspectives, drawing on the abstract energy of the 
Russian suprematists’ images of colliding planes and shards floating in space, 
but she did not get a chance to build until the 1990s.

In 1995, the year after her fateful fire station project, she suffered a loss 
that would haunt the rest of her career, when her winning design for the 
Cardiff Bay opera house was cancelled, a decision she put down to prejudice 
against her being a woman and a foreigner. She would go on to build her seminal 
opera house 15 years later, in the Chinese city of Guangzhou instead, a project 
that has been showered with accolades – even if the cladding panels have been 
known to fall off and are now bodged together with mastic.

Determined to push the limits of structural engineering and material science 
(as well as her clients’ pockets) with every project, her work was inevitably 
never far from controversy. Every major international award was met with an 
equal outcry, from the human rights claims surrounding herHeydar Aliyev centre 
in Azerbaijan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/30/zaha-hadid-architecture>, 
to the cost overruns of the London Olympic pool, to the lethal cocktail of 
escalating budget, sensitive context and local architectural opposition that 
finally put paid toher scheme for the Tokyo Olympic stadium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/17/the-troubled-history-of-zaha-hadids-tokyo-olympic-stadium-project>
 last year, which was perhaps her most bitter loss of all.

She was always characteristically blunt in the face of such criticism, 
accusing Japanese architects of jealousy over her win and, whenquestioned about 
conditions of labourers in Qatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/zaha-hadid-qatar-world-cup-migrant-worker-deaths>
, simply responding: “It’s not my duty as an architect to look at it.” When 
asked why the roof of her Olympic pool had to use 10 times the amount of steel 
as the velodrome to cover the same approximate span, she simply rolled her 
eyes. To have admired her genius, you had to forgive her shortcomings.

Twice winner of the Stirling prize, for the Maxxi and the Evelyn Grace Academy 
school in Brixton,Hadid finally received the RIBA gold medal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/23/zaha-hadid-from-baghdad-global-ubiquity-and-the-riba-gold-medal>
 last year. As her former tutor Peter Cook put it, when she was awarded the 
prize: “Let’s face it, we might have awarded the medal to a worthy, comfortable 
character. We didn’t, we awarded it to Zaha: larger than life, bold as brass 
and certainly on the case.”

The world of architecture would certainly have been more dull without her.
