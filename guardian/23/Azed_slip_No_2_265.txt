Comments

179 entries, no noticeable mistakes. Equal favourite clues, of 24 receiving 
one or more votes: ‘Sea-gulls are possibly (not eagles, silly)’ (LARUS) and 
‘Priest leading High Requiem Mass leaving pungent smoke’ (PERIQUE). I can take 
no credit for the second of these; as a number of you spotted, it won a prize 
(third, actually) in Competition No. 1,988 for Mr Borland, whose name occurs 
again in the top three quoted above. It’s satisfying that his earlier winner 
also found favour with many of you this time around (I make no apology for 
recycling former gems like this from time to time when the opportunity presents 
itself, and when my memory has not faded. They deserve a fresh airing.)

The clue that caused the most trouble was ‘Bird e.g. once famously in tow, 
left dull fatty’ for LUMP, which exploits the abbreviation ‘ump.’ and refers to 
Dickie Bird, the former test match umpire and professional Yorkshireman, who I 
thought was sufficiently well known, even to non-cricket-lovers. The fact that 
my clue only received one vote may indicate that I was mistaken (or simply that 
it wasn’t a particularly good clue anyway)!

I had some misgivings about ESPRIT FORT, a lexical item not previously known 
to me and, I guess, rarely used these days. It is not in myConcise Oxford 
Hachette French Dictionary (1995), which translates ‘freethinker’ as libre 
penseur/-euse. You still managed to come up with plenty of good ideas. 
Variations on ‘turbulent priest’ were understandably popular, so extra-clever 
wording was called for to raise such clues above the average level, but then 
that is so often the case. ‘Libertine’ was also a nice find. AlthoughChambers 
refers to its historical use, it does not label it as obsolete, so I tended to 
be lenient. A significant few used the idea of ‘Harry Potter’ to indicate an 
anagram of POTTER. I haven’t read the books but I recognized this as a 
promising approach, though none who used it really managed to produce a 
complete clue that was totally convincing.

In conclusion I’d like to say, as I rarely do, how much I appreciate the 
comments so many of you include with your entries, on all manner of issues. You 
will appreciate, I’m sure, that I cannot respond to all but a handful of these. 
If I think they deserve a wider audience I try to allude to them in the slip, 
but if you have a particular query you want me to answer, do please include a 
stamped addressed envelope and I’ll do my best not to keep you waiting unduly.
