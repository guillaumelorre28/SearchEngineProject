LSE boss: Thousands of jobs threatened by Brexit uncertainty

Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has 
warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around 
Brexit doesn’t ease.


Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn’t wait for 
clarity about Britain’s exit from the EU.


He said:

“I’m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the 
few thousands.

But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it’s syndication, 
trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, 
software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of 
thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.”

(thanks to Ben Woods of the Press Association for the quotes).

Food inflation picks up as Premier Foods plans price hikes

Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame.

Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% 
in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food 
prices have gone up.

The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has 
risen since sterling slumped against other currencies.And one of the country’s 
largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices.

It’s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd 
Grossman’s sauces.

City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco 
<http://www.cityam.com/company/tesco>, Sainsbury’s and Asda 
<http://www.cityam.com/company/asda> due to “growing cost pressures from the 
weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum”.

A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying:

“The situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands 
and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer.

On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.”

The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s.

And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the ‘Brexometer’ to show 
whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit.

Today’s weakening pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284#block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284>
 suggests we’re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the 
single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, 
goods and services).
Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) 
HSBC's "Brexometer" to track how hard FX market thinks Brexit will be; If no 
Brexit at all, GBP would be around $1.55. Hard Brexit = $1.10.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that 
will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit.

Our political editor Anushka Asthana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anushkaasthana> explains:


Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> will use 
his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU 
and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free 
movement of European workers in the UK.

Setting out his party’s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> will trigger article 50, the 
Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by 
promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS 
every week.

He will say Labour’s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to 
the European single market, but that his party wants “managed migration” and to 
repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in 
struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic 
demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than 
membership that they argued did not exist.

Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that 
this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems 
familiar....

The Financial Times argues today that “exasperation” over Theresa May’s lack 
of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling.

Traders aren’t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to 
allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark 
waiting for more details.

Here’s a flavour:

With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke 
Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the 
government has yet to reveal a plan. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/b14bca70-a1b1-11e6-82c3-4351ce86813f>

“There is no clear path and a lack of substance,” said Andrew Soper, head of 
FX options at Nomura.

FTSE 100 climbs to new hgihs

Boom! Britain’s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading.

The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, 
to hit 7261 points.

That’s partly due to the pound’s weakness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284#block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284>
, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters.

A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after 
Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison’s share are up 
4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind.

On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a 
row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would 
break that record.

Pound hits two-month low against the euro

Despite Theresa May’s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this 
morning as investors fret about Brexit.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has fallen by 0.3% 
against the euro to €1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th 
November.

The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to 
Monday’s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback).

The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the 
EU.

However, her insistence that the UK can’t keep ‘bits of membership’ have 
fuelled worries about a ‘hard’ Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and 
exit from the single market.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was ‘battered’ on Monday. She 
predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the 
details of Brexit.

We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the 
coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the 
market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the 
end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won’t be ‘hard’ or 
disastrous for the UK economy.

While Theresa May says that we can’t keep ‘bits of the EU’, sterling isn’t 
safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market.

Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by “heightened levels of 
political risk”, she adds.

The agenda: Christmas cheer from Morrisons and Majestic

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

We’re getting a new healthcheck on Britain’s economy this morning, with 
results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine.

The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison’s posting its best sales growth 
since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK 
consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison’s new management team 
should take the credit too.
David Buik (@truemagic68) 
WM MORRISON - like for like transaction growth for the last year +5.2% - 
strongest sales performance for 7 years! - shares called up 4%!

<https://twitter.com/truemagic68/status/818715527594016768> 
Majestic says its retail outlets had their biggest ever Christmas too, with 
like-for-like sales up 7.5%.
Louise Cooper (@Louiseaileen70) 
Xmas retail trading statements looking good...
Majestic Wine sales +15%
Blimey
30% of annual sales at Xmas.

 So, Britain hasn’t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame 
us?

More on all that shortly....

Also coming up today

Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas 
Flintof HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of 
the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am.

And City traders will be watching to see Britain’s FTSE 100 can maintain its 
run of record highs.

Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has 
warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around 
Brexit doesn’t ease.


Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn’t wait for 
clarity about Britain’s exit from the EU.


He said:

“I’m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the 
few thousands.

But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it’s syndication, 
trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, 
software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of 
thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.”

Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame.

Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% 
in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food 
prices have gone up.

The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has 
risen since sterling slumped against other currencies.And one of the country’s 
largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices.

It’s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd 
Grossman’s sauces.

City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco 
<http://www.cityam.com/company/tesco>, Sainsbury’s and Asda 
<http://www.cityam.com/company/asda> due to “growing cost pressures from the 
weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum”.

A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying:

“The situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands 
and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer.

On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.”

The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s.

And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the ‘Brexometer’ to show 
whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit.

Today’s weakening pound

 suggests we’re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the 
single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, 
goods and services).

Connor Campbell of SpreadEx predicts more sterling volatility today: 

The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn set to deliver a speech claiming the UK can be 
better off out of the EU meaning it might be another rough day for the pound.
 
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that 
will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit.

Our political editor Anushka Asthana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anushkaasthana> explains:


Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> will use 
his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU 
and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free 
movement of European workers in the UK.

Setting out his party’s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> will trigger article 50, the 
Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by 
promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS 
every week.

He will say Labour’s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to 
the European single market, but that his party wants “managed migration” and to 
repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in 
struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic 
demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than 
membership that they argued did not exist.

Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that 
this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems 
familiar....

The Financial Times argues today that “exasperation” over Theresa May’s lack 
of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling.

Traders aren’t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to 
allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark 
waiting for more details.

Here’s a flavour:

With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke 
Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the 
government has yet to reveal a plan. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/b14bca70-a1b1-11e6-82c3-4351ce86813f>

“There is no clear path and a lack of substance,” said Andrew Soper, head of 
FX options at Nomura.

The pound is continuing to drop.

It just hit a new 10-week low of $1.2118 against the US dollar, down another 
half a cent this morning.
 
Boom! Britain’s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading.

The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, 
to hit 7261 points.

That’s partly due to the pound’s weakness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284#block-587491f9e4b071ad1d690284>
, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters.

A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after 
Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison’s share are up 
4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind.

On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a 
row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would 
break that record.
 
Despite Theresa May’s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this 
morning as investors fret about Brexit.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has fallen by 0.3% 
against the euro to €1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th 
November.

The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to 
Monday’s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback).

The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the 
EU.

However, her insistence that the UK can’t keep ‘bits of membership’ have 
fuelled worries about a ‘hard’ Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and 
exit from the single market.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was ‘battered’ on Monday. She 
predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the 
details of Brexit.

We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the 
coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the 
market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the 
end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won’t be ‘hard’ or 
disastrous for the UK economy.

While Theresa May says that we can’t keep ‘bits of the EU’, sterling isn’t 
safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market.

Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by “heightened levels of 
political risk”, she adds.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

We’re getting a new healthcheck on Britain’s economy this morning, with 
results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine.

The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison’s posting its best sales growth 
since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK 
consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison’s new management team 
should take the credit too.
David Buik (@truemagic68) 
WM MORRISON - like for like transaction growth for the last year +5.2% - 
strongest sales performance for 7 years! - shares called up 4%!

 So, Britain hasn’t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame 
us?

More on all that shortly....

Also coming up today

Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas 
Flintof HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of 
the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am.

And City traders will be watching to see Britain’s FTSE 100 can maintain its 
run of record highs.
