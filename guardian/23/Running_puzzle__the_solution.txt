This is a fantastically counter-intuitive puzzle because it seems impossible 
for Daphne, who runs every mile in 8 minutes and one second, to beat Constance, 
who runs every mile in 8 minutes flat.

But, of course, she can – otherwise there would be no puzzle. The runner who 
is slower over every mile can surprisingly devise a way to be faster over 26.2 
miles.

Let’s first think about how Daphne runs the race. She does not run at a 
constant speed, but even so she covers every mile interval in the same time. 
How does she do this?

Look at the graph below, which tracks a runner’s speed over the distance of 
the course. It shows a racing strategy of running the first a of each mile at a 
high constant speed, and the remaining section of the mile at a low constant 
speed. If this strategy is repeated every mile all the way through the race, 
the runner is not running at a constant speed overall, but every mile interval 
will be run in the same time. This is because whichever mile you take, a of 
that mile is run at high speed and the remainder of the mile at low speed.

 Graph for Alex Bellos running puzzle 
If Daphne runs a marathon using this strategy, then let’s adapt it to best 
suit her needs. The marathon is 26.2 miles. We know – since she loses a second 
every full mile to Constance – that she will be 26 seconds behind at the 
26-mile mark. So Daphne needs to make up 26 seconds on the remaining 0.2 miles.

Let Daphne’s strategy be to run her high speed for the first 0.2 of each mile 
and her low speed for the rest. We now need to switch to talking about time 
rather than distance. Let Daphne run the first 0.2 miles in x seconds, and the 
remaining 0.8 miles in y seconds. She runs every mile in x + y seconds.

The question states that Daphne runs every mile in 8 minutes 1 second, which 
is 481 seconds. This gives us the equation:

[1] x + y = 481 

Constance runs every mile in 8 minutes, so she runs the entire marathon in 
26.2 × 8 × 60 seconds, which is 12,576 seconds.

Let’s now assume that Daphne wins the marathon by a single second, completing 
it in 12,575 seconds. Since she runs the first 0.2 miles of her mile cycle 27 
times, and the 0.8 mile section only 26 times, we get the following equation:

[2] 27x + 26y = 12,575 

We can solve these simultaneous equations without too much trouble. From [1] y 
= 481 – x. Substitute this value of y in [2]. The numbers thankfully cancel out 
nicely to leave x = 69 seconds and y = 412 seconds. So, if Daphne sprints the 
first 0.2 of each mile in 69 seconds, and takes 412 seconds for the rest of the 
mile, she will lose every single mile versus mile comparison, but pip Constance 
to the final post by a second.
