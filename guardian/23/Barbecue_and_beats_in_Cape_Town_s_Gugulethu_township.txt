The sun beats down on the queue snaking round the block from this bar and 
restaurant in Gugulethu, a vibrant township 11 miles from Cape Town. It’s 
Sunday lunch and a couple of hundred people have got there before us and are 
already throwing some moves to DJ Crazy’s booming South African house beats.


Opened in 2003 by Mzoli Ngcawuzele, the shisha nyama (a Zulu term for an 
informal barbecue) is something of an institution. Essentially, a big open-air 
shack, it has a devoted following – a mixed bag of locals, adventurous tourists 
and the odd celeb (Jamie Oliver’s been) who come to dance the afternoon away to 
hip-hop, house, R&B, and some of the best live bands in the country, as well as 
devour big plates of meat.

The diverse bunch of Capetonians at the canteen-style plastic tables are 
tucking into juicy pork chops and sausages which you choose from the butchery 
next door and take to the huge grills out back for staff to barbecue, orbraai 
in front of you.

We forgo the food and head to the bar (you can bring your own booze) for two 
more Castle beers. There’s a great energy about the place and as the music is 
cranked up, the crowd whoops and cheers. Time to watch the party unfold.
