Two influential sets of film prizes have given boosts in the awards-season 
scramble toMoonlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america>
, Barry Jenkins’ poetic study of an African-American teenager’s struggle with 
his sexuality, andAmerican Honey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold>
, Andrea Arnold’s freewheeling road trip following a group of magazine 
subscription sellers.

Moonlight was the main beneficiary of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association 
awards <http://www.lafca.net/years/2016.html>, where it took home four, 
including best picture, best director for Jenkins, best supporting actor for 
Mahershala Ali, and best cinematography for James Laxton. This followsits 
success at the equivalent New York critics awards <http://www.nyfcc.com/awards/>
, where Jenkins, Ali and Laxton all won in the same categories (though it lost 
out toLa La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone>
 in the best picture category), andits strong showing at the Gotham awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/29/moonlight-sweeps-gotham-awards-best-feature-isabelle-huppert-casey-affleck>
, a key independent-cinema oriented ceremony.

Momentum would also appear to be building behind Isabelle Huppert’s startling 
turn as a revenging rape victim in thePaul Verhoeven

: she won the LA critics’ best actress award (along with her work inThings to 
Come 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/things-to-come-review-mia-hansen-love-isabelle-huppert>
), replicating earlier wins at the NY critics (for the same two films) and the 
Gothams (for Elle alone).

American Honey emerged at the head of the pack at the British independent film 
awards <https://www.bifa.film/awards/winners>, winning four and just edging 
British-Iranian horrorUnder the Shadow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/05/under-the-shadow-review-feminist-horror-film-sundance-film-festival>
 which took three. American Honey won best British independent film, best 
director for Arnold, best actress for Sasha Lane and the craft award for 
cinematographer Robbie Ryan. The critically admired but little heralded Under 
the Shadow was a surprise success, taking best screenplay for writer-director 
Babak Anvari, best supporting actress for Avin Manshadi, and the Douglas Hickox 
award for best debut director for Anvari.

Ken Loach’s hard-hitting benefits-system drama I, Daniel Blake <http://I, 
Daniel Blake> did less well than expected, taking two awards for its cast 
members – best actor for Dave Johns, and most promising newcomer for Hayley 
Squires – but was passed over elsewhere.
