At the Changing Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/changing-media-summit> 2017 you will hear 
how the media industry can begin to rebuild trust between publisher and reader, 
brand and consumer, and agency and brand.

Who is the summit for?
The Changing Media Summit is for everyone working in the media sector. 
Attended by a senior, creative audience who are interested in gaining the very 
best insights and strategies, the event attracts those working in publishing, 
advertising, marketing, television, music, film and games.

What will I learn at the Changing Media Summit 2017?
The theme of the summit is “rebuilding trust in a post-truth age”. As trust in 
the media sector continues to decline, we’ll be asking how we can start to 
restore faith in the industry and re-establish meaningful relationships with 
consumers.

Key themes to be addressed at this event:


 * With readers discovering more and more news through social networks, how 
can they assess trust and authority? 
 * In a distributed media landscape, what new revenue streams are publishers 
pursuing? 
 * Is adblocking the best thing to happen to advertising? 
 * After the rebate scandal in the US, how can media agencies restore trust 
with clients? 
 * Do we need a regulatory framework to improve our trust in robotics and AI?
