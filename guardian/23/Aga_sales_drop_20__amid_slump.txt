Aga Rangemaster <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aga-rangemaster> is 
seeing no respite in the drop in demand for its upmarket cast-iron stoves, as 
the slump in the housing market and the wider economy continues to bite.

The company reported this morning that orders have fallen more than 20% in the 
17 weeks to 1 May compared with a year ago, thesame level of decline it 
reported in mid-March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/13/aga-profits-down-dividend-scrapped>
. This has forced it to cut back on production and slash costs.

"Economic conditions remain testing and unpredictable but we continue to act 
decisively," the company told shareholders at its annual meeting.

"Aga has seen the level of enquiries stabilise but order levels are currently 
well down on prior years. Marvel, our US refrigeration business, has seen the 
sharp volume falls of the last 18 months continue."

However, its Rangemaster stoves continue to "trade satisfactorily" and grow 
market share. The group believes it is the only leading UK-based manufacturer 
in the industry to have benefited from the weaker pound.

The firm, which is known for its Aga, Rayburn, Rangemaster and Stanley 
cast-iron cookers, has introduced electric models partly in response to last 
year's spike in oil prices and to improve its green ­credentials. The Guardian 
columnistGeorge ­Monbiot has criticised the environmental impact of Aga cookers

.

The company reiterated its main goal this year was to remain profitable and 
cash generative.

Aga has responded to the downturn by taking a series of cost-cutting 
­measures, including laying off 470 staff and implementing a shorter working 
week.
