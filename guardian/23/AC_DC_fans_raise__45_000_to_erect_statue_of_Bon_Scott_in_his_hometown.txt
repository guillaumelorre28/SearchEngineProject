AC/DC <https://www.theguardian.com/music/acdc> fans have succeeded in raising 
£45,000 to erect a statue of the late Bon Scott, the band’s singer before Brian 
Johnson, in his Scottish hometown.

The statue, by John McKenna, will be erected in a car park on Bellies Brae, a 
road leading out of Kirriemuir, north of Dundee. Thecrowdfunding appeal 
<http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/bonscottstatue/updates/?> by DD8Music has in fact 
raised almost £50,000, and the extra money will go towards a memorial garden – 
designed by students from Dundee and Angus College – for the singer.

The statue depicts Scott, in sleeveless denim jacket and very tight trousers, 
clutching a set of bagpipes

 – the instrument he played on the group’s song It’s a Long Way to the Top (If 
You Wanna Rock’n’Roll). McKenna previously designed theJock Stein Memorial at 
Celtic Park <http://www.a4a.co.uk/Resources/jocksteinandneila.jpeg> in Glasgow.

Scott’s statue is set to be unveiled next April, at the annual Bonfest 
<http://dd8music.com/bonfest-2016> held in the town, celebrating the life of 
the singer. Scott fronted AC/DC from 1974 until his death from acute alcohol 
poisoning in London in February 1980, aged 33.

The Kirriemuir statue will make Scott – so far as the Guardian can tell – the 
first hard rock singer to have two statues in his honour. In 2008, a lifesize 
bronze statue of him was erected in Fremantle, Western Australia. His family 
emigrated fromScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> to Australia 
in 1952.
