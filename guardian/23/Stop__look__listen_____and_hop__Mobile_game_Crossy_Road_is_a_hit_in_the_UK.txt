Crossy Road has become one of the most popular mobile games in the UK 
according to a new report from research firm App Annie.

The report claims Crossy Road had the most active British users of any iOS 
game in the first quarter of 2015, ahead of Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans.

In the equivalent chart for Android in the UK, Crossy Road placed third behind 
Candy Crush Saga and its sequel Candy Crush Soda Saga.

The game, a colourful and addictive action game inspired by arcade classic 
Frogger, was released in November 2014, andmade more than $10m globally for its 
developer Hipster Whale

 over the next three months.

That’s a relatively small amount compared to the other games listed above, with
Candy Crush Saga players spending $1.33bn on that game alone in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/candy-crush-saga-players-855m-2014>
 – or more than $10m every three days.

At the time of writing, Crossy Road is 164th in the top-grossing chart for 
Apple’s App Store in the UK compared to the top-five placings of the Candy 
Crush games and Clash of Clans.

Still, reaching the fiscal heights of those titles isn’t the aim of Hipster 
Whale, with its handful of staff and an enthusiastic and growing fanbase.

“Obviously, $10m is fantastic. That’s way, way, way, way, way more than we 
thought we would get. But someone on the free-to-play business would look at 
those numbers and think we could make a lot more per user,”said co-founder Matt 
Hall

 at the GDC conference in March.

“But, if we changed it … if we followed some of those best practices … if we 
sold coins and had a ‘save-me’ button and it felt like the other games, would 
anyone have cared?

At the start of April, Hipster Whale updated Crossy Road with a collection of 
British and Irish characters to play as

, including a Queen’s guard, a policeman and a Scottish piper. At that point, 
the game had been downloaded 70m times globally.

Exactly how many Brits does it take to make a mobile game the most popular by 
UK active users on iOS? Hall told the Guardian that Crossy Road “peaked at 2.9 
million monthly active users right at the end of February” – although this 
figure covers the UK and Ireland combined.

App Annie also published iOS and Android charts for the most popular 
non-gaming apps in the UK during the first quarter of 2015.

The iOS rankings were topped by Facebook, followed by WhatsApp, Facebook 
Messenger, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Google Maps, Twitter, eBay and the 
separate eBay for iPad app.

On Android, the same list ran Google, YouTube, Maps, Chrome Browser, Facebook, 
WhatsApp, Gmail, Google Play, Facebook Messenger and Google+. Unsurprisingly, 
the apps preloaded on Android devices dominated that chart.

Apps <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apps> popular in the US but not 
the UK according to App Annie’s analysis include Kik Messenger, Pandora Radio 
and Netflix, while in Japan and South Korea homegrown social apps Line and 
KakaoTalk (respectively) beat the big western social networks.

Quiz game Trivia Crack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/26/what-is-trivia-crack-100m-people-mobile-game>
 topped the company’s charts for the most popular iOS and Android games in the 
US in the first quarter of 2015, while in Japan, Disney’s Tsum Tsum – which 
uses Line’s social graph – headed both lists.
