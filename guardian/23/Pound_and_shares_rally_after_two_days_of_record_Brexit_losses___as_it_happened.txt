European markets end higher

The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in 
the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came 
in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet 
too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at 
Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still 
adjusting to the post-Brexit world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out 
further price swings.

The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are 
swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up, or down, 
in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better.

Valuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical 
range, which suggests it’s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you 
are a long term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be 
willing to stomach further price falls, if you are dipping a toe in.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 2.64% or 158.19 points at 6140.39 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.93% to 9447.28 
 * France’s Cac closed 2.61% higher at 4088.85 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 3.3% to 15601.62 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 2.48% at 7835.0 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 3.72% to 538.65 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 148 points or 
0.87%.

As for the pound, it is now up 0.9% at $1.3342 after climbing as high as 
$1.3418. Against the euro it is 0.68% higher at €1.2075.

On that note, it’s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s the full Reuters report on the meeting between business leaders and 
government minister Sajid Javid:

Britain appears a long way from developing a clear plan on the country’s 
future trading relationship with the European Union, the head of the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday after a meeting with 
government.

CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said some firms were putting investment 
on hold after Britain’s vote to leave the EU last week, and that they needed a 
clearer sense of what the government intended to do.

“It’s incredibly early days. I don’t think anybody’s coming out of these 
meetings feeling great, but they are coming out with a sense of resolve,” she 
told reporters.

“We’re a long way off having a plan and leadership and that is still where we 
will be continuing to make (the point) that this is what businesses need,” she 
added.

Fairbairn said businesses expressed very high levels of real and genuine 
concern to business minister Sajid Javid, who had called the meeting, and that 
the government also needed to address the fears of EU migrants employed in 
Britain.

At the meeting between business leaders and the government, there were high 
levels of real concern following the Brexit vote according to the CBI.

Reuters reports the CBI saying that the government needed to develop a plan on 
the country’s trading relationship with the EU very quickly. Businesses also 
wanted the government to get on with major infrastructure projects which are 
already underway. There were also concerns about rising prices, housing, and 
the insecurity being felt by migrant workers in the UK.

The CBI director general said a number of firms had put investment on hold, 
said Reuters, and said the meeting did not feel great but there was a sense of 
resolve.

After two days of panic leading shares have regained a little of the lost 
ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

Today has seen a welcome reprieve from the incessant fear and risk aversion 
that has dominated financial markets since Friday’s unexpected referendum 
result. The question on everyone’s lips is whether we have seen an end to the 
selling, with many seeing current prices as an opportunity to buy their 
favourite firms at a temporary discount. [But] this selloff is unlikely to be 
over and perhaps the only thing that will truly raise risk appetite for good 
will be a faint glimmer of hope that we could see a second referendum.

Despite the binary nature of Friday’s referendum result, far from providing a 
definitive answer to the markets, we now find ourselves in the eye of a 
political and economic storm. We have moved from a position of security and 
stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main 
political parties in a year’s time. David Cameron may have said that there is 
no way to go back on the referendum result, but Jeremy Hunt’s suggestion that 
he would hold a second referendum reminds us that crucially the decision is no 
longer Cameron’s to make.

UK business secretary Sajid Javid says maintaining single market access will 
be his number one priority in negotiations with the EU. He says British access 
to the single market may not take the same form as other non-EU countries. He 
says the UK economy remains strong and over the past few days investors have 
reaffirmed their commitment to the UK.

US banks with significant UK operations are likely to act sooner rather than 
later to shift their operations,according to ratings agency Fitch 
<https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pressrelease?id=1008118>. It said:

The UK’s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global 
banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their 
profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the 
impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate 
through other EU legal entities.

US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their 
contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be 
agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was 
constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement 
to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and 
activities.


Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various 
jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially 
reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. 
Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, 
JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted 
out of the country.


Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, 
depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by 
these countries. Flexible labor laws will be important for US firms, so this 
may favor countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, rather than Germany and 
France.

After cutting the UK’s credit rating from AAA to AA, Standard & Poor’s has 
said it had no plans to downgrade any other EU country in the wake of the 
Brexit vote.

But it said it would decide whether any UK bank ratings should be cut in the 
coming weeks. Reuters reports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-ratings-s-p-banks-idUSKCN0ZE1PQ?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29>
:

“This does not lead to mechanical changes (in bank ratings),” S&P banking 
sector analyst Giles Edwards said on a webcast.

“But equally this (Brexit scenario) was not our base case... where we see a 
need to change ratings we will do so in the coming weeks.”

On other EU sovereign ratings, S&P’s global sovereign chief Moritz Kraemer 
said: “We have no intention of downgrading any other EU sovereign.”

S&P chopped the UK’s credit rating by two notches to AA and kept it on a 
‘negative outlook’ on Monday in the wake of last week’s vote to leave the 
European Union. It was the first time it had ever made such a deep cut to a 
top-rated sovereign.

More Brexit fallout. Siemens is putting new wind power investment plans in the 
UK on hold due to uncertainty caused by last week’s Brexit vote, theGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> energy company has told the 
Guardian. Arthur Neslen reports:

A £310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people 
<http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1435902/analysis-siemens-and-davey-fear-brexit-fall-out-for-uk-offshore-wind>
 will not be affected by the decision, and should still begin producing blades 
and assembling turbines next year.

But Siemens <https://www.theguardian.com/business/siemens>, one of the few 
firms to openly back a Remain vote, will not be making new investments until 
the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe becomes clearer.

Juergen Maier, the firm’s UK CEO, said that an existing blueprint to export 
offshore wind turbine machinery from the Hull hub was now up in the air.

 He said: “Those plans were only beginning to happen and I expect that they 
will stall until we can work out exactly what the [new government’s] plan is, 
how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues 
around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.”

According to the conference board, the consumer confidence index came in at 98

Earlier UK chancellor George Osborne suggested taxes would have to go up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/28/brexit-3-trillion-stock-markets-sterling-ftse-business-live?page=with:block-57723331e4b030d83eb4af74#block-57723331e4b030d83eb4af74>
 to address the economic damage caused by Brexit.

So what taxes would they be? VAT could be one, according to tax specialists at 
Eversheds. The law firms partner Ben Jones said:

If tax rises are required, ironically VAT (the only real European tax and a 
prerequisite for EU membership) could be the tax most likely to increase. VAT 
is a huge source of tax revenue and relatively easy to increase, both 
practically and politically. Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2008 and 
after, VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% as part of measures to tackle the 
fiscal deficit. Increases to income taxes, national insurance contributions or 
business taxes would most likely be far more publically unpopular and 
politically undesirable.

Wall Street opens sharply higher

In tandem with other global markets, which have recovered a small part of the 
hefty declines seen in the wake of last week’s Brexit vote, the US has moved 
higher in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average - down almost 900 points since the referendum 
outcome - has gained 144 points or 0.8% as bargain hunters dip their toes into 
the market. The S&P 500 has opened up 0.7% and Nasdaq 1.1%.

Rob Davies

Representatives of several industries are due to meet business minister Sajid 
Javid MP this afternoon for a summit on the potential impact of the Brexit vote 
on UK firms, writes Rob Davies.

Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright will warn Javid that the 
industry faces a huge staffing shortfall if EU citizens are blocked from 
working in the UK.

“The UK food industry has almost 100,000 workers from the rest of the EU. We 
have an emerging gap of up to a further 130,000 workers as our ageing staff 
retire over the next decade,” he said in a prepared statement.

“While we as an industry continue to take many steps to develop home-grown 
talent through ambitious graduate and apprenticeship programmes, EU workers 
also provide a highly valued solution to our skills gap.

 “The UK food industry benefits from bringing in skilled labour from the EU 
and we urgently need assurances from UK Government that EU nationals working in 
the UK will be granted leave to remain. UK Government must now develop a new 
migration policy that ensures food and drink manufacturers have continued 
access to the workers we will need to address a looming skills gap and the 
drive for future innovation to support our UK competitive advantage.”

The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in 
the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came 
in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet 
too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at 
Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still 
adjusting to the post-Brexit world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out 
further price swings.

The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are 
swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up, or down, 
in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better.

Valuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical 
range, which suggests it’s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you 
are a long term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be 
willing to stomach further price falls, if you are dipping a toe in.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 2.64% or 158.19 points at 6140.39 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.93% to 9447.28 
 * France’s Cac closed 2.61% higher at 4088.85 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 3.3% to 15601.62 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 2.48% at 7835.0 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 3.72% to 538.65 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 148 points or 
0.87%.

As for the pound, it is now up 0.9% at $1.3342 after climbing as high as 
$1.3418. Against the euro it is 0.68% higher at €1.2075.

On that note, it’s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s the full Reuters report on the meeting between business leaders and 
government minister Sajid Javid:

Britain appears a long way from developing a clear plan on the country’s 
future trading relationship with the European Union, the head of the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday after a meeting with 
government.

CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said some firms were putting investment 
on hold after Britain’s vote to leave the EU last week, and that they needed a 
clearer sense of what the government intended to do.

“It’s incredibly early days. I don’t think anybody’s coming out of these 
meetings feeling great, but they are coming out with a sense of resolve,” she 
told reporters.

“We’re a long way off having a plan and leadership and that is still where we 
will be continuing to make (the point) that this is what businesses need,” she 
added.

Fairbairn said businesses expressed very high levels of real and genuine 
concern to business minister Sajid Javid, who had called the meeting, and that 
the government also needed to address the fears of EU migrants employed in 
Britain.
 
At the meeting between business leaders and the government, there were high 
levels of real concern following the Brexit vote according to the CBI.

Reuters reports the CBI saying that the government needed to develop a plan on 
the country’s trading relationship with the EU very quickly. Businesses also 
wanted the government to get on with major infrastructure projects which are 
already underway. There were also concerns about rising prices, housing, and 
the insecurity being felt by migrant workers in the UK.

The CBI director general said a number of firms had put investment on hold, 
said Reuters, and said the meeting did not feel great but there was a sense of 
resolve.
 
After two days of panic leading shares have regained a little of the lost 
ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

Today has seen a welcome reprieve from the incessant fear and risk aversion 
that has dominated financial markets since Friday’s unexpected referendum 
result. The question on everyone’s lips is whether we have seen an end to the 
selling, with many seeing current prices as an opportunity to buy their 
favourite firms at a temporary discount. [But] this selloff is unlikely to be 
over and perhaps the only thing that will truly raise risk appetite for good 
will be a faint glimmer of hope that we could see a second referendum.

Despite the binary nature of Friday’s referendum result, far from providing a 
definitive answer to the markets, we now find ourselves in the eye of a 
political and economic storm. We have moved from a position of security and 
stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main 
political parties in a year’s time. David Cameron may have said that there is 
no way to go back on the referendum result, but Jeremy Hunt’s suggestion that 
he would hold a second referendum reminds us that crucially the decision is no 
longer Cameron’s to make.
 
UK business secretary Sajid Javid says maintaining single market access will 
be his number one priority in negotiations with the EU. He says British access 
to the single market may not take the same form as other non-EU countries. He 
says the UK economy remains strong and over the past few days investors have 
reaffirmed their commitment to the UK.

US banks with significant UK operations are likely to act sooner rather than 
later to shift their operations,according to ratings agency Fitch 
<https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pressrelease?id=1008118>. It said:

The UK’s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global 
banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their 
profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the 
impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate 
through other EU legal entities.

US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their 
contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be 
agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was 
constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement 
to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and 
activities.


Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various 
jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially 
reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. 
Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, 
JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted 
out of the country.


Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, 
depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by 
these countries. Flexible labor laws will be important for US firms, so this 
may favor countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, rather than Germany and 
France.

 
After cutting the UK’s credit rating from AAA to AA, Standard & Poor’s has 
said it had no plans to downgrade any other EU country in the wake of the 
Brexit vote.

But it said it would decide whether any UK bank ratings should be cut in the 
coming weeks. Reuters reports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-ratings-s-p-banks-idUSKCN0ZE1PQ?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29>
:

“This does not lead to mechanical changes (in bank ratings),” S&P banking 
sector analyst Giles Edwards said on a webcast.

“But equally this (Brexit scenario) was not our base case... where we see a 
need to change ratings we will do so in the coming weeks.”

On other EU sovereign ratings, S&P’s global sovereign chief Moritz Kraemer 
said: “We have no intention of downgrading any other EU sovereign.”

S&P chopped the UK’s credit rating by two notches to AA and kept it on a 
‘negative outlook’ on Monday in the wake of last week’s vote to leave the 
European Union. It was the first time it had ever made such a deep cut to a 
top-rated sovereign.

More Brexit fallout. Siemens is putting new wind power investment plans in the 
UK on hold due to uncertainty caused by last week’s Brexit vote, theGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> energy company has told the 
Guardian. Arthur Neslen reports:

A £310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people 
<http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1435902/analysis-siemens-and-davey-fear-brexit-fall-out-for-uk-offshore-wind>
 will not be affected by the decision, and should still begin producing blades 
and assembling turbines next year.

But Siemens <https://www.theguardian.com/business/siemens>, one of the few 
firms to openly back a Remain vote, will not be making new investments until 
the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe becomes clearer.

Juergen Maier, the firm’s UK CEO, said that an existing blueprint to export 
offshore wind turbine machinery from the Hull hub was now up in the air.

 He said: “Those plans were only beginning to happen and I expect that they 
will stall until we can work out exactly what the [new government’s] plan is, 
how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues 
around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.”

, comes a better than expected consumer confidence number.

According to the conference board, the consumer confidence index came in at 98 
in June, compared to 92.4 in the previous month and an expected 93.3. (This was 
before the outcome of the UK referendum of course.)

Earlier UK chancellor George Osborne suggested taxes would have to go up

 to address the economic damage caused by Brexit.

So what taxes would they be? VAT could be one, according to tax specialists at 
Eversheds. The law firms partner Ben Jones said:

If tax rises are required, ironically VAT (the only real European tax and a 
prerequisite for EU membership) could be the tax most likely to increase. VAT 
is a huge source of tax revenue and relatively easy to increase, both 
practically and politically. Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2008 and 
after, VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% as part of measures to tackle the 
fiscal deficit. Increases to income taxes, national insurance contributions or 
business taxes would most likely be far more publically unpopular and 
politically undesirable.

In tandem with other global markets, which have recovered a small part of the 
hefty declines seen in the wake of last week’s Brexit vote, the US has moved 
higher in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average - down almost 900 points since the referendum 
outcome - has gained 144 points or 0.8% as bargain hunters dip their toes into 
the market. The S&P 500 has opened up 0.7% and Nasdaq 1.1%.
 
Representatives of several industries are due to meet business minister Sajid 
Javid MP this afternoon for a summit on the potential impact of the Brexit vote 
on UK firms, writes Rob Davies.

Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright will warn Javid that the 
industry faces a huge staffing shortfall if EU citizens are blocked from 
working in the UK.

“The UK food industry has almost 100,000 workers from the rest of the EU. We 
have an emerging gap of up to a further 130,000 workers as our ageing staff 
retire over the next decade,” he said in a prepared statement.

“While we as an industry continue to take many steps to develop home-grown 
talent through ambitious graduate and apprenticeship programmes, EU workers 
also provide a highly valued solution to our skills gap.

 “The UK food industry benefits from bringing in skilled labour from the EU 
and we urgently need assurances from UK Government that EU nationals working in 
the UK will be granted leave to remain. UK Government must now develop a new 
migration policy that ensures food and drink manufacturers have continued 
access to the workers we will need to address a looming skills gap and the 
drive for future innovation to support our UK competitive advantage.”
