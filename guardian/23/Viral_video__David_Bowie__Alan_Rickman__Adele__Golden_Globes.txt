This week was dominated by the untimely deaths of two stars – David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69>
 andAlan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-giant-of-british-film-and-theatre-dies-at-69>
. Both died at the age of 69, and both leave bodies of work that have been 
widely shared by their fans in the wake of their passing.


Bowie’s death was marked by many fans with an animated GIF rather than a video 
– illustratorHelen Green’s striking drawings 
<http://helengreenillustration.com/Time-May-Change-Me> of the star’s hairstyles 
throughout his career. Created to mark the Thin White Duke’s 68th birthday, it 
became one of the defining image of his death almost exactly a year later.

 Helen Green’s animated GIF of David Bowie 
In terms of video, it’s impossible to give more than a taste here of Bowie’s 
legacy in video, from Space Oddity to Ashes to Ashes to the singles from his 
latest album Blackstar. Bowie videos broke Adele’s record for the most views in 
a day on video platform Vevo, with his clips watched 51 million times on Monday.


They were led by Bowie’s most recent single, Lazarus 
<https://youtu.be/y-JqH1M4Ya8>, which features the opening line “Look up here, 
I’m in heaven / I’ve got scars that can’t be seen”. The lyrics took on a new 
resonance in the wake of the star’s death, while fans scoured the video for 
references to his career, with some pointing to the skull on the desk (also in 
the Blackstar promo) and others highlighting that his clothes as he gets into 
the wardrobe are was identical to an outfit from 1976’s The Man Who Fell To 
Earth.

Arguably one of the best Bowie videos is also the simplest – Mick Rock’s 1971 
promo for Life on Mars? Featuring the star with striking red hair and piercing 
blue eyeshadow, it allows his personality to shine straight through the screen.

Fellow musicians’ tributes to Bowie also made waves this week, with Madonna 
singing Rebel Rebel live in Houston 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em0dO5FEPUc> and Elton John performing a piano 
piece echoing Space Odyssey <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiloNpJ8k_Y>. 


Amid all the gloom surrounding Bowie’s death, it’s easy to forget that the 
singer had a great sense of humour and did a string of turns sending up his 
cool image, from avoice role in a Spongebob Squarepants movie 
<http://www.spin.com/2006/10/bowie-lends-voice-episode-spongebob-squarepants/> 
to acameo on Zoolander 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/bowie-on-screen-his-best-movie-roles-20160111/zoolander-2001-20160111>
. Perhaps the best is his appearance in Ricky Gervais’s Extras, with the star 
mocking the comic as a “chubby little loser, national joke”. Here’s an 
interview in which Bowie gives a deadpan account of his cameo.

 David Bowie on his appearance in Extras 
Although he did his share of serious theatical roles, Rickman was also notable 
for his comic appearances. As well as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films, 
he played the deliciously evil Hans Gruber in Die Hard. But perhaps his most 
memorable comic appearance was as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: 
Prince Of Thieves, where he pretty much steals the show fom Kevin Kostner with 
lines such as “Locksley! I’ll cut your heart out with a spoon!”

Another standout moment was Rickman’s voiceover for Marvin the robot in The 
Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKd6ZxCEJdI>, 
a masterclass in comic misery. His line “I think you ought to know I’m feeling 
very depressed” echoed the feelings of many fans this week.

Sunday’s Golden Globes provided plenty of headlines this week, from Ricky 
Gervais ribbing the audience <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71bDdVbjp4> to 
Jennifer Lawrence telling off a reporter for looking at his phone during a 
press conference <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_zja9pepgU>. But the 
highlight for many viewers was the glimpse ofLeonardo DiCaprio’s face as Lady 
Gaga brushed past <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY1YIYipvoc> on her way to 
pick up best actress for American Horror Story. His look of horror as the 
singer appears next to him is a million miles away from a Poker Face.

Finally, the week’s most-shared video was Adele’s appearnce in James Corden’s 
Carpool Karaoke slot <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nck6BZga7TQ>. Hearing the 
Hello star belt out the Spice Girls’ Wannabe is a highlight while her rap of 
Nicki Minaj’s Monster shows her talents reach beyond singing.
