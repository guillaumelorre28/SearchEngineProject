The British Medical Association (BMA) has called for a 24-hour helpline to be 
introduced for patients who are addicted to prescription drugs.

The group believes it could help tackle problems created when strong 
tranquillisers prescribed for short-term use, to treat issues such as anxiety 
and insomnia, are issued for longer periods.

Dr Andrew Green, the BMA’s GP clinical and prescribing policy lead, described 
dependence on the powerful prescription drugs as a widespread problem that 
sometimes involves patients who are upset at having been harmed by treatments 
they hoped would help them.

Green said services needed to be specifically designed for this group of 
people as they may feel out of place if they are referred to existing services, 
which are aimed at cocaine or methadone users.

He told BBC Breakfast: “The situation has been made worse because they have 
come to the NHS for help and they have found that the services are not 
available for them.

“We have even had some patients say they feel they are being blamed for the 
situation that they find themselves in.”

Benzodiazepines – taken for severe anxiety, insomnia and sometimes pain relief 
– are a particular concern. Disturbed sleep, personality changes, blunted 
emotions and people feeling they are struggling to manage their lives are among 
the potential side-effects of the drugs.
