Former snooker player Alex Higgins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alex-higgins> has died at the age of 61. The 
two-time world champion, nicknamed 'Hurricane', had been suffering from throat 
cancer for a number of years.

Higgins will be remembered for his flamboyant playing style that attracted the 
loyal support of thousands of snooker fans, and is credited with being one of 
the greatest talents the game has seen. At 22 Higgins won the World 
Championship at his first attempt in 1972, and again in 1982.

He was instrumental in driving the growth in popularity of snooker throughout 
the 1970s and 1980s, aided by television coverage, and inspired many future 
professionals to take up the game.

Snooker <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> promoter Barry Hearn said 
Higgins would be remembered as the "original people's champion" and the man who 
transformed the popularity of the sport. "I have known him for nearly 40 
years," Hearn said. "He was the major reason for snooker's popularity in the 
early days. He was controversial at times, but he always played the game in the 
right spirit. We will miss him â€“ he was the original people's champion."

Higgins was discovered at a block of flats in the centre of Belfast. He had 
been unwell for some time.

The player had not been answering his mobile phone and the flat had to be 
broken into, sources close to him said.
