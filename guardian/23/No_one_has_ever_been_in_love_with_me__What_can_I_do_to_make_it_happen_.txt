I’ve been single for a few years, after going through a breakup that left me 
incapacitated. That, coupled with growing up with an alcoholic father who was 
abusive enough that I had to leave my home, has left me wary. I’ve only met a 
few men that I wanted to pursue something with, and the people I’ve fallen for 
haven’t seemed bothered, and it’s knocked me back. A recent experience 
particularly so. I try to remain open and keep dating, and be brave and honest 
about emotions, however I find it hard after my experiences. I begin to lose 
faith as I approach 30, and I’m aware no one has been especially in love with 
me. I wonder if it will happen, and meanwhile I feel like male affection and 
care is significantly absent in my life. What can I do?
