Our neighbour on the west side has removed a line of tall leylandii and 
erected a fence. The soil is very shallow: bamboo, a cordyline and euphorbias 
survive, but some dark green, spiky things – possibly howeas – have given up. 
What can we do?
I’d give up, too, if I was forced to live in a bed with a bamboo, euphorbia 
and a cordyline, in no depth of soil with a leylandii peering in. Poor spiky 
things, whatever they were.

It’s good that the other plants are doing well. Your best option is to add 
a good dose of organic matter to improve the soil. The cheapest option is 
homemade organic compost, but recycled green waste compost (most councils offer 
this) is a cheap alternative, or buy peat-free compost and load it on. The 
euphorbias and cordyline will resent it if you bury their stems: draw back the 
compost from around their bases to make a well. I’d suggest adding more 
cordylines and euphorbias if you have gaps, because you know these will survive.
