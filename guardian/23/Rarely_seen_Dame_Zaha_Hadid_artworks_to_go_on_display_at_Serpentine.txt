During the speech, Hadid showed private notebooks that contained remarkable 
sketches, shining a light on how she thought about architectural forms.

“I was completely transfixed,” said Obrist. “I had never seen such notebooks. 
I wanted to see her to discuss what we could do. An exhibition? A book?”

They met soon after and talked about both, agreeing on an exhibition that will 
be held at theSerpentine Sackler gallery, which opened in 2013, the second 
Kensington Gardens outpost for the gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/25/serpentine-sackler-gallery-marquee-battling>
. Hadid was responsible for the £14.5m renovation and extension of what was the 
Royal Parks’ magazine, a former gunpowder store built in 1805.

About a week after her meeting with Obrist, Hadid left for Miami where she 
died suddenly in hospital after being treated for bronchitis. “We had planned 
that after her return, her office would get all the drawings out and we would 
start the work,” said Obrist.

The Serpentine exhibition will also display Hadid’s paintings, which were 
heavily inspired by her passion for early Russian avant-garde art andthe work 
of Kazimir Malevich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/04/kazimir-malevich-liberated-painting-tate>
 in particular.

Obrist said of her paintings: “They are not known enough, they are not known 
to a wider audience and we want many people to see them beyond the art and 
architecture world.

“She is one of the great visionaries of our time, she is a historic figure and 
this is also why we feel this work has to be seen now and why it is so urgent. 
There could not be a more wonderful connection, to show it in her own building, 
the only structure in central London of hers.”


Hadid, whose best-known projects include the London Aquatics Centre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/31/london-olympics-aquatic-hadid-review>
 andthe Maxxi museum in Rome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/16/zaha-hadid-maxxi-rome>, 
had a two-decade association with the Serpentine, becoming a trustee in 1996 and
designing the inaugural Serpentine Pavilion in 2000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/23/serpentine-pavilions-ten-years-on>
, her first structure in London.

Obrist said Hadid’s declaration that there should be no end to experimentation 
had become “a mantra for the Serpentine Galleries as it looks to the future”.

For years Hadid was as known for her unrealised projects as much as her 
realised ones, regarded by some as being the designer ofbeautiful but 
impractical, overly expensive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/27/zaha-hadid-profile-> 
buildings.

Obrist said that was not a fair characterisation, pointing to the “staggering 
number of competitions she won, the staggering number of buildings she built 
but also [that] will be built ... almost every month a new building is opening”.

The Hadid show was announced at a press conference under the new leadership of 
the galleries, with Obrist joined by the new chief executive, Yana Peel.

Other exhibitions announced include one with new work by Grayson Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/22/grayson-perry-provincial-punk-review-turner-contemporary-margate>
 called The Most Popular Art Exhibition Ever! that will open in June 2017. 
Shows will also be staged for the emerging New York-based artist Lucy Raven and 
the influential Britishsculptor and conceptual artist John Latham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/15/anatomy-of-an-artwork>.

Latham, with his wife Barbara Steveni, created the Artist Placement Group in 
1966 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/artist-placement-group>
, with the aim of making artists useful and placing them in government and 
commercial organisations. Inspired by that, the Serpentine said it would next 
year hold a “congress of ideas” where artists will join politicians, scientists 
and business leaders to discuss potential solutions to some of the world’s 
biggest problems.
