Now that letting agents’ fees will be abolished (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/23/rents-unfair-letting-fees-tenants-charges>
, 24 November), attention could turn to that other concealed charge, the 
booking fee. York’s Barbican and its agents levy a 12.5% fee on card purchases. 
They charge no such fee on cash payments, despite the fact that it costs them 
more to handle cash than debit cards. If rents go up as a result of the 
abolition of letting agents’ fees, and the price of concert tickets rises if 
booking fees are outlawed, we shall at least have a more honest market.

• The insurance premium tax was invented by the Tories in 1997, and set at 4%. 
Labour strongly condemned it, but in power increased it to 5%. The Tories have 
since increased it to 6%, 9.5%, 10%, and now 12%. Someone has to pay for the 
Tory election bribe not to increase income tax, national insurance, or VAT.

• Nice to hear from Mr Hammond that we have saved £130 due to the freezing of 
petrol tax for seven years. He is a little modest. If we consider chimney tax 
(frozen 327 years, saving £25), soap tax (frozen 181 years, saving £20), brick 
tax (frozen 166 years, saving £15), window tax (frozen 165 years, saving £75) 
and playing card tax (frozen 56 years, saving £5) we have actually saved £270. 
Thank you very much, Mr Hammond.

• So, now we know that for years to come we will have higher inflation, lower 
growth and higher borrowing – £58.7bn to be precise. After Brexit things were 
meant to get better.

• As a triple-locked pensioner whose “Jam

” children and grandchildren survive on financial support from me, I’m 
wondering how things will pan out when pensioner poverty creeps back in under 
the Tories next year and my generation are no longer able to bail out their 
children?
