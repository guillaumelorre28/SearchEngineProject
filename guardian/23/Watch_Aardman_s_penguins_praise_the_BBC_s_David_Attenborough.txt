Maltesers: ‘Leaving’ (starts at 00:04) - UK

Beattie Edmondson’s role in the BBC sitcom Josh showed off the skills she’s 
inherited from parents Ade Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders, and she put them to 
good use in this short but funny commercial for Maltesers, which maintains the 
chocolate brand’s light-hearted approach to marketing.

Save The Children: ‘A Second A Day’ (starts at 04:02) - UK

It may not seem possible to create a film about the Syrian crisis as impactful 
asMartin Stirling’s extraordinary 2014 film <https://vimeo.com/88339881> but 
Tom Green’s sequel is gut-wrenchingly affecting. The same young actor who 
played Lily in the original film becomes a refugee and through her plight this 
film makes the case for opening its arms to those in need.
