Canada’s government should regulate the production of cannabis when it is 
legalized for recreational use and require plain packaging for such products, 
an official panel has recommended, in a potential setback to growers who hoped 
to build brands.

How cannabis is sold should be left up to the provinces and should include 
both retail storefronts and a mail order system, the report recommended.

, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia.

Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau’s Liberal government madelegalizing marijuana for recreationa use a 
part of its successful election campaign last year

 and will introduce legislation in the spring of 2017.

Canada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> is following in the 
footsteps of some U.S. states that have already legalized recreational use, 
including Colorado and Washington. While Tuesday’s recommendations are not 
binding, the government said it will take them under consideration.

 On the whole, the report was positive for the existing companies that 
currently produce and sell medical marijuana, analysts said, with a 
lower-than-expected age limit of 18 for buyers and the allowance of some forms 
of edibles, which have been popular in places such as Colorado, where marijuana 
is already legal.

 Still, the panel recommended that plain packaging be required, while 
restrictions to advertising should be put in place similar to those currently 
on tobacco products.

 “That’s where the downside is for some of these licensed producers that had 
been hoping to advertise and really develop brands,” said Jason Zandberg, an 
analyst who covers the industry for PI Financial.

 Canopy Growth, which has a C$1.2bn ($914.98m)market capitalization on the 
main TSX exchange, was up 3.9% at C$10.39, after initially jumping as much as 
8%.

 Producer and seller Aphria Inc soared as much as 10% but similarly trimmed 
its gains and was up 3.6% at C$5.25.

Cannabis <https://www.theguardian.com/society/cannabis> production should be 
regulated by the federal government, with licensing and production controls 
used to ensure a competitive system that includes small producers, the panel 
said, suggesting the door was open for new producers to get into the burgeoning 
sector.

 There are currently 36 producers that have received a license to grow and 
sell marijuana under the medical framework, according to Health Canada. The 
panel recommended that Canada maintain a separate system for medical marijuana.

 Whether storefronts operate through a government-run model, the way some 
alcohol is sold in Canada, or through private stores should be left up to the 
provinces, the report recommended.
