We began 2016 contending with #OscarSoWhite <https://twitter.com/oscarsowhite> 
and cinema’s gender imbalance, and if we haven’t fixed either, there’s evidence 
we’re working on it, especially the latter. The year started, and will almost 
certainly end, with a heroine-led Star Wars movie atop the box office chart, 
and we’ve been spoiled for female roles and role models: Sasha Lane’s drifter in
American Honey <https://youtu.be/y1SpWZm1PLc>; Brie Larson’s resilient mother in
Room <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ci-pAL4eE>; Kate Beckinsale’s 
social-climber inLove & Friendship <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0>
; an all-femaleGhostbusters <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw> 
reboot; and, let’s not forget, the second-biggest UK movie of the year was
Bridget Jones’s Baby <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJsvmscPY9w>.

As for #OscarSoWhite, it’s clearly still a work in progress. 2016 did give us 
Creed <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv554B7YHk4>, starring Michael B Jordan 
– such a great movie by and about young black Americans, you forgot it was 
supposed to be a Rocky sequel. Beyoncé’s radical, full-lengthLemonade 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM89Q5Eng_M&list=PLxKHVMqMZqUSPF11Ghs0KqDfOGhB9Vw5E>
 film put mainstream cinema to shame, and forthcoming black coming-of-ager
Moonlight <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc> is this awards season’s 
frontrunner. Clearly more needs to be done, but it looks like Hollywood might 
have got the memo.

 Hot dog… Sausage Party 
This could also go down as the year we hit Peak Franchise. Studios lazily 
rolled out sequels, assuming we’d obediently lap them up:Alice Through The 
Looking Glass <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3IWwnNe5mc>, Independence Day 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCe_JshWOZ0>, Inferno 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH2BD49sEZI>, Zoolander 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CL4LNWHegk>, Teenage Sodding Mutant Ninja 
Turtles <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeaugHGd1Kw>. We didn’t. Nor did the 
likes of Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman live up to the overhype. So many 
tentpoles collapsed this year, Hollywood might have to consider more permanent 
structures. Even the smash-hitCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKrVegVI0Us> felt like a last-gasp doubling 
down, cramming all Marvel’s superheroes into one basket.

The new comic book batch were far more interesting. Particularly Deadpool 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vN6DHB6bJc>, the year’s best comedy, which 
was bracingly straight-up and grown-up about the superhero rules it was messing 
with.Doctor Strange <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM> was the most 
psychedelic blockbuster we’ve ever had, and in animation terms,Zootopia 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWM0ct-OLsM>, Kubo And The Two Strings 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vex0gPFnBvM>, Sausage Party 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VoNgLnjzVg> and Anomalisa 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQkHA3fHk_0> all won out by giving us 
something new to chew on.

It was the one-offs that shone through in arthouse cinema, too: the amazing 
one-take German thrillerVictoria <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qorWoQfoKFU>; 
transporting Amazonian epicEmbrace Of The Serpent 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uymNkBuR-SY>; and intensely focused Holocaust 
dramaSon Of Saul <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wMzPztPavs>. Ken Loach’s 
powerfulI, Daniel Blake <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahWgxw9E_h4> must also 
go into this category, being the only serious take on modern-day, 
benefits-broken Britain we got. So, if 2016 had a lesson for the movies, it 
was: be original, be brave, be inclusive. Or be Star Wars.
