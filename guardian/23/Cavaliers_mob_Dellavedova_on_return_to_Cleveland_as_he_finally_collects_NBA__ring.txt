championship ring.


The Australian guard was mobbed by former Cleveland team-mates after receiving 
his prized piece of jewellery from Cavaliers general manager David Griffin.

Griffin was knocked aside as Cavaliers players rushed to swarm Dellavedova.

The 26-year-old Dellavedova left Cleveland after winning last season’s title 
and most of his fellow 2015-16 champions received the ornament pre-game at 
their season opener against New York in October.


Dellavedova, a fan favourite at Cleveland for his tenacious playing style, was 
forced to wait until his new team Milwaukee played at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans 
Arena.


But it wasn’t the greatest night for the Boomers point guard or his Bucks, who 
went down 113-102 thanks to 29 points to Cleveland star LeBron James and a 
game-high 31 from Kyrie Irving.


Starting point guard Dellavedova had two points and three assists and fellow 
Australian Thon Maker three points and three rebounds coming off the bench.


It was their second loss to the defending champions in as many days after they 
went down in overtime at home 24 hours earlier.
