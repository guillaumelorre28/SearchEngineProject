One of the reasons I love writing is that you can do it pretty much anywhere 
you want. On a train, on a plane, on a rollercoaster (if you’re got the stomach 
for it), up a hill or down a well. With pen and paper or typewriter or laptop 
or slate, you can conjure worlds, conquer tyrants and present your heroes and 
heroines with riches beyond their wildest dreams.

Yes, you can write anywhere, but the truth is most of us do not. In reality 
the majority of authors find themselves drawn to a single working space where 
they feel most creative, empowered and free. At home I’ve always found myself 
too easily distracted by coffee and comics and games and my wife and my baby 
boy to get any actual writing done. You can imagine my delight therefore when I 
was given the chance to rent a desk at Aardman.

AARDMAN. THE Aardman <http://www.aardman.com/>. Home of Wallace and Gromit and 
Shaun and Timmy and Morph and those pesky Pirates and so many other amazing 
creations. When I arrive at work in the morning, THIS is the first thing I see.

 Wallace greeting Robin Etherington! 
The Aardman headquarters are crammed with models and posters and art and 
visual treats. Around every corner lies a gem like this…

 More Shaun the sheeps! 
In fact the old Banana warehouse in which I work (true fact: the building was 
used for ripening bananas before Aardman took over the space in the 1990s) is 
still used to shoot stop-motion animation. Walking to work I pass a brilliant 
sounding room labelled BOFFIN CITY and the model making department.

 Aardman model making. 
Finally I climb the stairs to my office, a large room I share with lots of 
other creative folk, and I slide behind my desk and get down to the work of 
crafting a new comic adventure.

 A laptop with two keyboards! 
But wait a second… that’s a pretty boring desk, isn’t it? Only three Lego men 
and a small basketball for company! Well, after all the inspiration I’ve seen 
on my walk to work, I really don’t need anything else cluttering up my mind. 
Some writers like to surround themselves with bits and bobs that remind them 
why it is AMAZING FUN to be able to create for a living, and I’m no different. 
But instead of covering my desk with cool stuff, I’ve surrounded myself with an 
entire BUILDING that has the same effect!

Plus, when I leave at night, it’s always nice to know that this pair are 
guarding my desk!
