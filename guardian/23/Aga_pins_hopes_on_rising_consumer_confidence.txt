Shoppers are in a better mood and the "tide is turning" in consumer confidence 
according toAga Rangemaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/aga-rangemaster>, the maker of 
aspirational cookers, which revealed an uptick in orders this spring.

The company said that improved trading in the three months to the end of June 
had offset a slow start to the year.

"The tide is turning, the mood amongst our customers is better and there is a 
buzz about our new products," said William McGrath, its chief executive.

He said Aga cooker orders were up 8% at the half-year stage and the company 
hoped that new electric versions of its cookers, which are traditionally 
fuelled by oil, would continue to boost sales. The company's luxury tile brand, 
Fired Earth, saw sales rise 5% and made an operating profit for the first time 
since the start of the economic downturn.

The fortunes of Aga tend to be closely linked to the housing market as new 
home buyers tend to update their kitchen equipment. The company said that an 
increase in the number of housing transactions should help the business through 
the rest of the year.

"With consumer confidence improving, mortgage approvals picking up, government 
stimulus into the housing market continuing, and strong new products, we expect 
top-line progress through the second half," said analysts from Numis in a note.

However, in the first half, revenues were only £300,000 more than the same 
period a year before at £119.5m while operating profit remained the same, at 
£1.5m.
