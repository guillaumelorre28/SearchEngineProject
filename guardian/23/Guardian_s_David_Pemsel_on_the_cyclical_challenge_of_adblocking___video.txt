Watch David Pemsel, CEO of the Guardian Media Group, deliver the opening 
welcome at theChanging Media Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/changing-media-summit> 2016.

He argued that the media industry is partially to blame for the rise of 
adblockers. As algorithms have prized the individual, not the context, the cost 
of impressions has been driven down. This puts pressure on the revenues of 
publishers, who then load their ad pages. This ultimately creates a bad user 
experience, leading to adblocking.


He believes that advertising, mobile networks and publishers are all complicit 
in the erosion of quality environments. Great advertising should exist in great 
environments, but this is currently lost.
