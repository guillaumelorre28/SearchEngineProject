Disgraced sports scientist Stephen Dank claims he supplied former Gold Coast 
Suns star Nathan Bock with the prohibited peptide CJC-1295. The allegations 
come just a week after Bock was cleared of doping by the Australian Anti-Doping 
Authority (Asada) and allowed to continue coaching NEAFL team Southport Sharks.

Dank told News Corp Australia he bought the drug at a Sydney compounding 
pharmacy in December 2010 and took it to the Gold Coast on a plane in a cooler 
bag packed with dry ice. He said he then gave the CJC-1295 to then Suns fitness 
boss Dean Robinson, who taught Bock how to self-administer it.

Dank’s confession came as Asada <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asada> 
insisted on Tuesday it was unable to establish whether the drug Bock used was 
actually CJC-1295. Robinson and Dank worked for the Suns in late 2010 when 
Bock, one the start-up club’s star signings, was being treated for an achilles 
injury.

The pair then reunited at Essendon in late 2011 and played key roles in 
establishing the Bombers pharmacologically experimental drugs program. An Asada 
spokesperson on Tuesday said: “To prove that an athlete has used a prohibited 
substance, it must be able to prove the substance used by that athlete.”

Dank, who was slapped with a lifetime ban by the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> last year, said he was bewildered by 
Asada’s failure to confirm what drug he had given Bock. “I don’t know why they 
couldn’t establish that it was CJC-1295 when they think they’ve established 
that I gave (Essendon players) Thymosin beta-4, which they can’t,” Dank told 
The Herald Sun.
