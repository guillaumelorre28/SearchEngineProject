Dogs are often described as man's best friend, but it's a hero cat who 
features in our top video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI867wz93Lw> this 
week as he chases away a dog that is attacking a young boy on his bike. The 
fearless moggie saves the youngster from even more serious injury. We've also 
got a very cute bunny who is tucking into raspberries and looks as if he has 
applied some lipstick.

Jay-Z is rarely out of the headlines and this week was seen being beaten up by 
Beyonc√©'s sister, Solange, in a lift 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWdhX9c_7FA&feature=youtu.be>. The attack 
happened after a gala event in the Standard Hotel in New York and was filmed on 
the elevator's CCTV.

Appearances matter - and they can be deceptive. When a French film team tried 
to test out who would play Good Samaritan when a man collapsed in a city street,
 the results were predictable <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGPjUyVtTQw> - 
but depressing. To lift the mood, we've gota magical video from make-up artist 
Elvis Schmoulianoff <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YseUBgN3igE>. She filmed 
herself in her bedroom with a point and shoot camera, natural light, paints, 
brushes and a mirror over a period of 10 days. The final sequence contains 
footage from five of those days and is comprised of 1,064 individual images.

The UK is mourning the death of fundraiser Stephen Sutton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/14/stephen-sutton-dies-teenage-cancer-trust-mother>
, who died on Wednesday from cancer aged just 19.Watch and be inspired by 
Stephen's diary <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvG3ifEd0t0>. Teenage cancer 
is the theme of the film The Fault In Our Stars, which features Shailene 
Woodley and Ansel Elgort and will be released in the UK next month. We've got 
thehaunting theme song  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkqVm5aiC28>performed 
by Ed Sheeran.
