Giants of speculative fiction including Stephen King, Neil Gaiman and Margaret 
Atwood have made way for newcomers on a lively shortlist for this year'sArthur 
C Clarke award <https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurcclarkeaward> for the 
best science fiction novel of the year.

The UK's most prestigious science fiction prize will see American author Ann 
Leckie's first novelAncillary Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/20/science-fiction-round-up-reviews>
 – a space opera about a spaceship trapped in a human body – competing with 
Egypt-born Ramez Naam's debut Nexus, in which an experimental drug links human 
beings mind to mind. A third debut also makes the line-up: American novelist 
Kameron Hurley's God's War, about a bisexual bounty hunter who collects the 
heads of deserters.

James Smythe <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-smythe>, a growing 
force in British science fiction, makes the cut for The Machine, set in a 
near-future dystopia where memories can be recorded on machines. The list is 
completed with novels from two well known names in science fiction: former 
winner Christopher Priest, chosen forThe Adjacent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/26/adjacent-christopher-priest-review>
, and Phillip Mann, picked for his first novel since 1996, The Disestablishment 
of Paradise.

The books were selected from 121 submissions, which were made public by the 
award followingcontroversy around last year's all-male shortlist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/04/arthur-c-clarke-award-shortlist-all-male>
. This year, said director Tom Hunter, 34 books were submitted by female 
writers, a ratio of "approximately one in four, [of which] one in three made it 
through to the discussion list of 30 titles from which the judges made their 
final selection today". This ratio "carried through into the final six 
shortlisted titles, two of which are by new female authors," said Hunter.

He called the shortlist "such an excitingly fresh list, which really reflects 
new writers as well as classics of the genre". The line-up, he said, shows the 
"real vibrant health" of science fiction today, with submissions received from 
42 different publishing houses and imprints. "There's a lot of energy in the 
genre at the moment," said Hunter.

Titles which failed to make the final cut for this year's Arthur C Clarke 
award include books by giants of the genre Terry Pratchett, Alastair Reynolds 
and Kim Stanley Robinson, as well as Ruth Ozeki's Booker-shortlistedA Tale for 
the Time Being 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/15/tale-time-being-ozecki-review>, 
Atwood'sMaddAddam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/08/maddaddam-by-margaret-atwood-review>
 and King'sDoctor Sleep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/doctor-sleep-stephen-king-review>
.

The judging panel features Ian Whates and Duncan Lawie from the British 
Science Fiction Association <http://www.bsfa.co.uk/>, and Sarah Brown and 
Lesley Hall from theScience Fiction Foundation <http://www.sf-foundation.org/>, 
along with Georgie Knight from theSci-Fi-London <http://www.sci-fi-london.com/> 
film festival. The winner of the award, who receives a cheque for £2014, will 
be announced on 1 May and will join an illustrious roster of former winners 
including Atwood, M John Harrison and  China Miéville.
