Michael Doughty was tripped by Eastleigh goalkeeper Ryan Clarke and the 
Swindon midfielder dusted himself down to slot home the resulting penalty on 68 
minutes.

Robins forward Luke Norris had earlier seen a close-range header saved by 
Clarke, with replays suggesting the ball may have crossed the line, but 
National League Eastleigh also saw an Ayo Obileye effort cleared off the line 
in added time.

In Friday night’s other tie, Mahlon Romeo scored the only goal as Millwall 
beat League One rivals Southend 1-0 at the Den.
