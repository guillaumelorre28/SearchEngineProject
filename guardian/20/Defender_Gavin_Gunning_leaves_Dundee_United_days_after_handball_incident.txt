Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> have parted 
company with the defender Gavin Gunning by mutual consent, the club said on 
Tuesday, three days after the Irishman inexplicably picked up the ball and 
walked off the field during a match.

The 25-year-old was playing in Saturday’s 2-0 league defeat to Inverness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/09/ross-county-dundee-st-johnstone-kilmarnock-scottish-premiership>
 when he scooped up the ball, walked to the touchline and claimed he was 
injured. He was ordered to return to the pitch by United’s manager, Mixu 
Paatelainen.

When Gunning was substituted shortly after the incident, he walked away down 
the tunnel while appearing sarcastically to applaud the club’s supporters.

United, who are bottom of the Scottish Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership>, released a brief 
statement which read: “Gavin Gunning has left Dundee United by mutual consent. 
This is a private matter and the club will not make any further comment.”
