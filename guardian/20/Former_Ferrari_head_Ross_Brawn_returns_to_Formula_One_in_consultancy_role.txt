Ross Brawn <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/brawn>, one of Formula One’s 
major players of the modern era, looks certain to be restored to the sport in 
the near future – but the precise role he will play remains uncertain.

After three years out, there were reports that he was about to be named the 
new head ofFormula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone>. Instead, 
he is officially helping the sport’s future owner, Liberty Media, as a 
consultant.

He told the BBC <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/37847748> on Wednesday: 
“Liberty have not got far enough down the road to make any commitments yet. I’m 
doing a little consulting to help them better understand F1, but that’s all.”

Brawn, 61, was technical director of the championship-winning teams Benetton 
and Ferrari. He then became the owner of the Brawn GP team thatwon the 
championship with Jenson Button in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/18/jenson-button-wins-f1-world-title-brazil>
. But after doing much of the work to build up the current Mercedes team he 
walked away from the sport at the end of the 2013 season.

Since then he has been linked with a number of teams. But it seems certain 
that his likely return will be in some general capacity; he is unlikely to work 
for a team again.

Bernie Ecclestone <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernie-ecclestone>, the 
F1 chief executive officer, has described the idea that Brawn might replace him 
as “a load of bollocks”. But Ecclestone feels that Brawn could do a job for the 
sport’s governing body, the FIA.

He told Autosport: “I’d be delighted if he went to the FIA – he would be 
absolutely first class. I haven’t spoken to him for quite a long time. I 
haven’t got the slightest idea what he could do. But nothing with us.

“We don’t need an engineer. If anyone is going to be put in that position 
[CEO] then I would be the person that would be doing it.”

Brawn could certainly do an impressive job with the FIA, and his experience 
would make him a difficult man for any team to dupe when it comes to getting 
round the rules. But a job with Liberty Media is more plausible.

The media company will be taking over F1 next year, with big ideas for the 
future. Brawn would be ideally placed to show the new chairman, Chase Carey, 
the way around a sport with more pitfalls than a box-set of Indiana Jones films.
