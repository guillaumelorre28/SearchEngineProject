Villa’s Scott Sinclair, with a hat-trick, has missed a sitter and Notts County 
live on in hope of a fourth. Palace have that many goals … Souare beats two on 
the left and crosses to Zaha who heads home at the near post and they are 4-1 
in front against Shrewsbury. Ipswich lead by the same scoreline at Doncaster 
thanks to Ryan Fraser.

Zzzzzzz. It’s still scoreless between West Brom and Port Vale.
 
Villa’s Scott Sinclair, with a hat-trick, has missed a sitter and Notts County 
live on in hope of a fourth. Palace have that many goals … Souare beats two on 
the left and crosses to Zaha who heads home at the near post and they are 4-1 
in front against Shrewsbury. Ipswich lead by the same scoreline at Doncaster 
thanks to Ryan Fraser.
 
MK Dons lead at home to Cardiff, who were ahead in normal time, thanks to Josh 
Murphy.
 
Middlesbrough are in front! Christian Stuani scores his second early in the 
second period of extra-time at Burton.
 
James Alabi has made it 3-1 to Ipswich at Doncaster. It’s half-time in 
extra-time at Luton, while Burton are fading but clinging on against 
Middlesbrough.
 
Hearts fans can breath a sigh of relief. Callum Paterson has scored on the 
stroke of half-time in extra-time at Forfar.
