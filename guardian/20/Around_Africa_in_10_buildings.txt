The Great Mosque of Djenné <http://www.greatmosqueofdjenne.com/> is the 
largest mud- or earth-brick building in the world and is widely acknowledged to 
be the greatest achievement ofSudano-Sahelian 
<http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1376621> architectural style.

The present-day mosque is the third reconstruction of this religious building, 
located on the flood plains of the Bani river. The original mosque was built in 
the 13th century, while today’s Great Mosque was completed in 1907. Unusually, 
compared with other important west African mosques, the site was not sacred 
prior to its establishment. In fact, a palace previously stood there.

Every spring the mosque is re-plastered, a task that the entire city 
participates in. The repairs are supervised by a guild of 80 senior masons who 
plaster the facade with mud that has been cured for weeks beforehand. Women 
provide water for the mixture, while the elders give advice. The festival of the
Crépissage de la Grande Mosquée 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/arts/design/the-great-mosque-in-djenne-mali.html?_r=0>
 is a time of repairing the damage, cracks and erosion inflicted on the mosque 
in the previous year by west Africa’s torrential rains.

Away from the noise and bustle of Marrakech’s old medina is the Majorelle 
garden <http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/>and house, an oasis of calm and colour. 
In 1931 the French orientalist painter Jacques Majorelle commissioned the 
architectPaul Sinoir <http://lara.rufflecol.es/tag/paul-sinoir/> to build him a 
studio in an art deco-Islamic style. Majorelle and his son Louis, a furniture 
designer, decided to create a living work of art: a majestic garden of exotic 
plants. The garden was officially opened to the public in 1947, then abandoned 
after Jacques Majorelle’s death in 1962. It remained derelict for more than 20 
years, until the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, a long-time lover of 
Morocco, acquired the property and restored it.

Ethiopia’s long history of kingdoms, emperors and dynasties dates back more 
than 3,000 years. The town of Lalibela has 11 well-preserved and extraordinary 
rock-hewn medieval churches, theChurch of St George 
<http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/18> or Bet Giorgis being the finest.

The roof, in the form of the crucifix, is the most visible part of Bet Giorgis 
from the surrounding terrain. The interior attests to how cosmopolitan this 
part ofAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> was at this time. 
There are images, carvings and influences from all over Christendom and beyond: 
a two-headed eagle you’d have been more likely to see in Constantinople; the 
star of David with the cross carved inside it; and carvings that resemble Greek 
icons. In the words of the 16th-century Portuguese explorer Francisco Alvares, 
Bet Giorgis has “edifices, the like of which cannot be found anywhere in the 
world”.

In 1948 South Africa’s National party government started a process that turned 
over 20 million people into second-class citizens, condemning them to a life of 
servitude, humiliation and abuse that lasted until the country’s first free 
elections in 1994. Inaugurated in 2001, theApartheid Museum 
<http://www.apartheidmuseum.org/> on the outskirts of Johannesburg tells the 
story of this era and the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.

Light is an important symbolic feature of the museum’s design, getting 
brighter as visitors make their way through a series of 22 individual 
exhibition areas. It acts as a guide to the final room, devoted to the 
liberation of Nelson Mandela, signalling the collapse of apartheid. Seven 
concrete pillars, 18 metres high, tower over the complex, marking the entrance 
to the exhibition spaces. Inscribed on them are the following words: democracy, 
freedom, responsibility, equality, reconciliation, diversity and tolerance, 
providing the foundations and vision for a newSouth Africa

Located 200km north-east of Khartoum, the site of the ancient city of Meroe on 
the eastern bank of the Nile is marked by temples, palaces and – astonishingly 
– more than 200 pyramids. These ruins testify to the vast exchange of art, 
architecture, religion and language that once existed between the Mediterranean 
and Africa.

John Garstang, from the University of Liverpool, undertook extensive 
excavation in Meroe, uncovering the Royal Baths in 1912. In 2011 the pyramids 
of Meroe gainedUnesco world heritage status <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1336>
.Kéré Architecture <http://www.kere-architecture.com/> has proposed a 
protective shelter over the Royal Baths, which are believed to have serviced 
nearby palaces, to celebrate the heritage of the site.

 Independence Arch, Accra. Photograph: Ulrich Doering/Alamy 
Independence Square 
<http://www.timeout.com/accra/attractions/independence-square-and-independence-arch>
 or Black Star Square, is the second-largest square in the world after 
Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. Completed in 1961, the square was 
commissioned by Ghana’s first president,Kwame Nkrumah 
<http://www.britannica.com/biography/Kwame-Nkrumah>.

The square is made up of several elements: the Black Star Monument, 
reminiscent of the Arc de Triomphe, is inscribed with “Freedom and Justice, AD 
1957”, commemorating Ghana’s independence; eight stands around the periphery 
have the capacity to seat more than 30,000 people; the vast space within the 
square is designed for huge events and military parades. The final element is a 
modernist structure, Independence Arch, that sits parallel to the beach. The 
inspiration for its prominent arch is said to have come from the handle of the 
handbag that Nkrumah’s Egyptian wife,Fathia Nkrumah 
<http://infoboxdaily.com/your-world/ghana/item/1771-africas-first-ladies-fathia-nkrumah>
, carried on special occasions.

The “black star” of the square’s name was inspired by the Black Star shipping 
line, founded in 1919 by the Jamaican-born civil rights activistMarcus Garvey 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/garvey_marcus.shtml> to provide 
transportation to encourage African economic development, independence and 
freedom.

Picture Library /Alamy 
Kenyatta International Conference Centre <http://kicc.co.ke/> (KICC) is a 
28-storey icon of the Nairobi landscape. Commissioned by the then president,
Jomo Kenyatta <http://www.britannica.com/biography/Jomo-Kenyatta>, in 1967, and 
designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik Nøstvik, it became the 
country’s first post-independence government building when completed in 1973.

The architecture consists of a tower, amphitheatre, a spectacular plenary and 
a courtyard. The idea of using terracotta facade draws inspiration from 
traditional African architecture; the tower has a revolving restaurant offering 
panoramic views of Nairobi that takes 76 minutes to complete one revolution.

This high-rise building was a byproduct of new partnerships that were 
developing between postcolonial east African countries and Nordic countries 
seeking to give development aid.

Standing in a country where less than a third of the population are 
Christians, the “Basilica in the Bush 
<http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,152145,00.html>” is the 
largest church in the world. This is another presidential project, commissioned 
by the first president of Ivory Coast, Felix Houphouët-Boigny, who was 83 at 
the time. He spared no expense: the marble was imported from Italy; 7,000 sq 
metres of hand-blown stained glass windows from France. The church was 
completed in four years, at a cost of over £190m.

The basilica has two long arms reminiscent of St Peter’s plaza, formed by 128 
massive Doric columns, stretching across an area of 30,000 sq metres paved with 
granite and marble. Its dome reaches a height of 158 metres making it the 
world’s tallest church. Houphouët-Boigny’s vision was to design a modern city 
in the middle of the rainforest while relocating the administrative capital 
from Abidjan to Yamoussoukro, his birthplace.

The basilica was initially rejected by the Catholic church over its 
extravagance, andPope John Paul II requested that a hospital be built on the 
site 
<http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-10/news/mn-369_1_basilica-pope-africans> 
in order to accept it. Although Houphouët-Boigny agreed, the hospital was never 
built.

Construction will begin later this year on a cancer centre and hospital 
designed by the renowned British/Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, commissioned 
by the Eugène Gasana Jr Foundation. According toAdjaye Associates 
<http://www.dezeen.com/2015/07/22/david-adjaye-gahanga-international-childrens-cancer-hospital-treatment-centre-rwanda-eugene-gasana-junior-foundation/>
, the 100-bed paediatric cancer centre is thefirst of its kind anywhere in 
Africa

.

The 40,000-sq-metre rectangular building is set in a four-hectare site. The 
architecture responds to the climate and location: the facade is shaded by 
screens comprised of triangular forms, which increase or decrease in density 
with the building’s orientation to the sun. In addition, the geometric facade 
draws inspiration from traditionalImigongo 
<https://kodumuki.wordpress.com/history-of-imigongo/> art, which involves 
applying a surface of cow dung to a wall before adding graphic patterns in 
black, white and red.

The end of Angola’s civil war in 2002 signalled the beginning of an oil boom. 
But this southern African country experienced a boom of a very different type 
in the 20th century – cinemas. Between the early 1930s to the late 1970s, 50 
cinemas were built in Angola 
<http://www.designindaba.com/articles/point-view/unique-and-distinctive-architectural-style-angola%E2%80%99s-cinemas>
, with theCinema Infante Sagres 
<http://www.cineafrica.net/angola/home.php?il=52&l=en> in the capital Luanda 
being the largest on the continent in 1975.

These cathedrals of culture, also referred to as cine-esplanadas (open-air 
cinemas), are colourful, modernist buildings that are now mostly derelict. A 
few are being restored – such as Cine-Atlantico and Cine-Teatro Nacional, the 
oldest cinema in Luanda – heralding a revival in cinema culture. While most 
African nations commissioned grand buildings to house their political class, 
the Cinema Restauração became Angola’s National Assembly building after 
independence in 1975.
