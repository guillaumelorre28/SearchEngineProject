Last week’s Marrakech climate summit shone a light on Morocco’s clean energy 
plans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/17/cop22-host-morocco-lights-way-africa-renewable-energy-2020>
, which have drawn praise from around the world. At the heart of King Mohammed 
VI’s ambitions is a windfarm in the country’s south-west region, which, due to 
an expansion over the summer, has seen offan array of challengers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/africas-largest-windfarm-set-to-connect-remote-kenya-to-the-grid>
 for the title of Africa’s biggest.

Built in just two years and launched in 2015, the Tarfaya complex 
<https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/africas-largest-wind-energy-project-commissioned-morocco/>
 stretches more than 100 square km across the Saharan desert, its 131 wind 
turbines grinding out enough electricity to power a city the size of Marrakech 
every day.

But the renewable energy project is also controversial with some Sahrawi – the 
people who live in the west of the Sahara desert – who complain that it will 
deepen what they say is the occupation of their land.

The Western Sahara dispute traces back to November 1975, when Morocco oversaw 
a 350,000-strong “green march <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_March>” from 
Tarfaya across the region, as Spain was beginning a haphazard decolonisation. A 
mass flight of Sahrawi refugees and decades of armed conflict followed, as the 
UN declared the region a “non self-governing territory”.

When UN chief Ban Ki-moon described the situation as an occupation 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morocco-westernsahara-un-idUSKCN0WU1N9> 
earlier this year, dozens of UN staff were expelled from the country.

Today, Tarfaya is a sleepy concrete village, sparsely surrounded by military 
checkpoints, camel trains, inlets dotted with flamingos – and 12 waves of 
turbines that rise from the Saharan sand dunes like a desert circus.

Their performance is a showstopper. Tarfaya annually saves 900 tonnes of CO2 
emissions - and around $200m of oil imports. It has brought new transmission 
lines which, officials say, guarantee power supplies to Sahrawi communities, 
even if many still complain that they are excluded from the green tech industry.

Hafsa Tarfaoui, a 25 year-old civil engineer at the plant, herself Sahrawi, 
said: “It is not that Sahrawis don’t find jobs in the windfarm industry. When 
we want to recruit a person, the priority is finding a person from this area. 
The problem is the lack of universities and places to study here. If you have 
no diploma, how can they offer you a job?”

Tarfaoui got her first job at the plant after years of study but says: “If I 
was a Sahrawi with zero experience I wouldn’t be here.” Of the plant’s 60 or so 
workers, there are two other Sahrawi office staff members and 15 security 
guards.

While Tarfaya sits on the Moroccan side of the Western Sahara border, four 
existing or soon-to-exist windfarms are situated on the other side.

By 2020, wind and solar resources in Western Sahara could provide more than a 
quarter of Morocco’s clean energy, which will power 42% of Morocco’s 
electricity.


The Tarfaya plant gives 400,000 Dirhams (£32,000) to a local town each year. 
It sponsors local projects and youth vacations, as well as funding a street 
lighting programme in Tarfaya.

But that has not stopped opposition to the windfarm. While a declaration

, protesting against any of it coming from Western Sahara.

Ali Salem Tamek <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Salem_Tamek>, the 
vice-president of Codesa, a Sahrawi human rights collective, said in a email: 
“It is amazing to have green energy. It is our responsibility as human beings 
to protect the world we live in, but if you occupy your neighbours yard to 
produce that green energy – and sell it to them at the end – believe me, your 
neighbours will not be happy about it.”

in the clean energy process. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images 
A face-to-face interview with Tamek was impossible during the fortnight-long 
UN climate talks, after a security clampdown saw activists arrested and at 
least one Algerian journalist, Hamza Hamouchene, deported to Agadir. Moroccohas 
been ranked <https://rsf.org/en/ranking> 131st out of 180 countries for press 
freedom.

Tamek warned of unrest if Sahrawi voices were shut out of the clean energy 
process. “Multinational companies are dividing our country’s natural resources 
without consulting or benefiting the Sahrawi people and we have recently seen a 
huge protest in the refugee camps against Siemens and Enel,” he wrote. “In the 
occupied territories of Western Sahara there is growing awareness about this, 
and growing understanding of the long-term consequences.”

In Morocco <https://www.theguardian.com/world/morocco>, some environmentalists 
sympathise with the Sahrawis but wonder whether the planet has time to wait for 
“national liberation movements” to win their struggles before cutting carbon 
emissions. Others argue that without a just transition to low-carbon societies, 
public support will inevitably turn to disaffection, with undesirable 
consequences.

A recent report 
<https://www.scribd.com/document/329721379/Powering-the-Plunder#from_embed> by 
Western Saharan Resource Watch, a network of pro-Sahrawi groups, accused the 
King of using the region’s windfarms to enrich himself, and cement Moroccan 
dominion with vital energy infrastructure.

“Green energy production is making Morocco’s plunder of the territory even 
more lucrative,” the report said. “Siemens and the Italian company Enel ... win 
Moroccan tenders in Western Sahara by partnering with the energy company owned 
by the king of Morocco. Would the king be interested in a process of 
self-determination and decolonisation in Western Sahara when he, himself, is 
benefiting from the Moroccan army’s illegal presence there?”

The report backed calls by Tamek for Siemens and Enel to withdraw from Saharan 
projects to help advance the region’s moribund peace process.

Such demands provoke incredulity among Morocco’s political elite. Hakima 
el-Haité, the country’s environment minister, responded: “What would [they] 
prefer: to have energy or to be isolated? To have wind energy or be located 
near a coal installation?

“The political issue is solved,” she added. “I don’t know any ‘Western 
Sahara’. In my country there is only the Sahara and the south of Morocco.”





El-Haité insists that 90% of the local population are happy with the project, 
and just “0.0001% of the population” have criticisms. “Maybe the people you 
spoke to are not citizens of Morocco?” she said.

All the same, some public support is thought to have waned after hundreds of 
Sahrawi workers were laid off when the plant’s construction finished. “It was a 
bit brutal,” the engineer Tarfaoui admitted.

 The huge state-owned OCP company, which mines phosphates for global 
fertiliser use has been a lightning conductor forSahrawi protests 
<http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Morocco-Bars-67-Human-Rights-Defenders-from-Western-Sahara-20160121-0023.html>
. That has been partly fuelled byan OCP subsidiary’s claim 
<http://www.phosboucraa.ma/sustainability/sustainability/sustainable-operations>
 that 95% of its energy came from a nearby windfarm.

The suggestion appears questionable. Abdellatif al-Ghali, Tarfaya’s director, 
said that specific industries could not be powered by the turbines. “We just 
transmit electricity to the national grid,” he said. “Our exclusive customer is
ONEE <http://www.one.org.ma/> (the national electricity firm) and that is who 
we generate electricity for.” On-site engineers confirmed this.



For now, the biggest threat to the remote renewable power plant comes from 
three highly poisonous snake species - and two types of scorpions - some of 
which can kill a person within 30 minutes. Signs instruct workers to kick the 
doors of power substation huts before entry, and then stand back, just in case.

 Maintenance engineer Nabil Fadili described the challenges that the Tarfaya 
complex faces. Photograph: Arthur Neslen 
Nabil Fadili, a 28-year-old maintenance engineer at Tarfaya, said: “The 
biggest challenge we face is keeping the plant’s availability all year round. 
We aim for 95% availability and it is really hard.”

Western Sahara’s coastal strip is one of the region’s windiest areas with a 
wind load factor of around 46%. “It is windier than in the Netherlands or 
Belgium,” el-Ghali said.

In the calmer winter months, winds can drop off dramatically but the 317MW 
plant was still operating at 73.5MW of capacity when the Guardian visited.

On the Saharan beaches that day, fishermen living in huts made of tarpaulin 
and rubbish unfurled their nets as usual, between jagged cliffs that looked as 
though someone had hacked them off with a saw.

At Tan Tan airport, security officials continued their heightened checks on 
new arrivals and departures, as the Marrakech climate summit continued, a world 
away.


“A planetary crisis on the scale of climate change can only be met by an 
approach based on fairness, between countries and within countries,” said 
Friends of the Earth’s Asad Rehman at the Marrakech conference. “Without that, 
no political leader will be able to convince citizens of the need for the 
transformation required, to create a safer and more equal world for us all.”
