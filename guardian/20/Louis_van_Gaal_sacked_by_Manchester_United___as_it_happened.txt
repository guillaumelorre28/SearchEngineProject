Dignified statement from Van Gaal (or whoever wrote it on his behalf). No 
mention of Giggs but that will come when Mourinho's confirmed.

Louis van Gaal statement

It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> FC, and in doing so, I 
have fulfilled a long-held ambition.

I am immensely proud to have helped United win the FA Cup for the 12th time in 
the club’s history. I have been privileged during my management career to have 
won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, 
will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.

I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan. 
I believe that the foundations are firmly in place to enable the club to move 
forward and achieve even greater success.

I hope that winning the FA Cup will give the club a platform to build upon 
next season to restore the success that this passionate set of fans desire.

Having managed in Holland, Spain and Germany, I had always hoped for the 
opportunity to manage in English football and be part of English culture. Both 
of these experiences have lived up to expectations and been fantastic.

I thank my players and wish them well for next season. It has been a pleasure 
to work with them and it has been particularly rewarding to see so many young 
players take their chance to break into the first team and excel. I look 
forward to watching the continued development of these young players next 
season.

Thank you to the owners and board of Manchester United for giving me the 
opportunity to manage this great club.

Manchester United statement

Louis van Gaal is to leave Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, with immediate effect.

Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said: “I would like to thank Louis and his 
staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a 
record-equalling 12th FA Cup for the club (and securing him a title in four 
different countries). He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity 
throughout his time here. He leaves us with a legacy of having given several 
young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage. 
Everyone at the club wishes him all the best in the future.”

A decision on a successor as manager will be announced soon.

Rio Ferdinand has, we’re are obliged to say, ‘taken to Facebook’ and written 
the following <https://www.facebook.com/RioFerdinandOfficial/?fref=ts>:

After few hours to let the dust settle.. I thought I would write a few words 
on (Louis Van Gaal (LVG)

His unwavering belief in his methods is something to respect in many ways but 
it was also part of his undoing too.

Success (winning the league or CL) is what Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> demands & added to 
that an attacking, quick, aggressive & imaginative style of football.

Unfortunately LVG failed to bring either of those elements to the club.

He is huge personality who won an FA cup, keeping up his habit of winning 
trophies everywhere he has been but his‪#‎MUFC‬ 
<https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/mufc?source=feed_text&story_id=1024372190944029>
 legacy will be the introduction of the players from the academy like Rashford, 
Lingard, Fosu-Mensah etc which WAS in keeping with the history of the club - 
giving kids an opportunity to play.

They could delay the finalisation, I guess...
M. Yass (@TheFamedNeutral) 
@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> re idea LVG asked for delay. 
NYSE rules wouldn't allow it. They HAVE to announce when it's finalised.

There might actually be something in this, from Henry Oundo:

“Van Gaal probably asked for a day to allow him leave the country before he is

- an ounce of respect he must have asked! “

It’s debate time! Should the players be more ashamed of themselves for downing 
tools or should we blame Van Gaal for creating such an atmosphere of ennui that 
the tools just slipped from their lifeless hands?
Nick Ames (@NickAmes82) 
Haven't seen much about how the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> players' stonewalling 
of Van Gaal's methods might reflect more dimly on them.

@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> Jose has said a few times 
he'd be back at work 'in July.' You may be at this blog for some time. Should 
we send food & drink?

JOSE SPEAKS

Technically. He opened his mouth and made noises, but they weren’t especially 
startling ones

“I give you this, I’m not leaving my house again today, so you should all go 
home,” he told Sky Sports.

So there you go. We should all go home, he’s quite right. He’s been out having 
a little wander, with his personal yappy attack dog Rui Faria and a chap with a 
beard & a cool leather jacket. Any idea who this gadge in the middle is?

It is with a heavy heart that, seven and a half hours after my first post, 
made with an announcement apparently imminent, I hang up my liveblogging hat 
for the night. I have been defeated. Ed Woodward, you win. (Which probably 
isn’t something he’ll have heard very often.)

The good news, for you and for the world, is that the fight will go on! Nick 
Miller is going to take up the baton (email himhere 
<mailto:nick.miller@theguardian.com>, tweet him here

Mourinho latest!

Jose Mourinho has got a takeaway! It’s from a restaurant called Salmontini, 
who are “located in the heart of Belgravia” and have “a fresh approach”. They 
sound like a fishy cocktail - an appletini for the committed pescetarian.

“You mentioned earlier that the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> shares have gone up 
amidst the excitement of Mourinho’s expected appointment,” writes Ben 
Mohammadi. This is true - apparently the Glazers have made £50m today on 
United’s increased valuation. “Perhaps the delay is because the United 
hierarchy are cynically riding out the high as long as possible before they 
announce Ed Woodward’s mum as the new manager.” Hmmm, I’m not sure the Glazers’ 
gains would survive that move.

“If I were LvG, I would have it written into my severance that the only way I 
were able to leave Carrington today would be via helicopter,” suggests Karl 
Gibbons. “No driving by the “media scrum”, and also a very cool way to leave. I 
am envisaging him hanging from an open door at the back waving a la someone in 
Die Hard or some such film.”

I’m starting to think he’s tunneling out.

@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> Above those Wenger 
palmarès, it states his time at Arsenal lasted 1996-2016. There might be a high 
profile sacking today yet!

Perhaps he’s going to sign for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, where fans are 
demanding greater on-field artistry, while Arsenal, whose fans have had enough 
of the artistry and just want to win something, will move for Mourinho? It’s a 
win-win-win.

I have to say that, while on a personal level today is turning into a bizarre 
and surprisingly lengthy form of torture, I’m starting to find the continued 
lack of statement quite funny. If they’re delaying it because they’re trying to 
cause the nation’s media a bit of trouble, they will spend five more hours 
watching us all liveblog like performing chimps and then, five minutes before 
the papers go to print, release their statement. On the other hand, they may 
just be incompetent/confused/being held hostage by an angry Dutchman.

anyone but someone should call the police. What is LVG still doing in there?

Sounds like Woodward actually told LVG in person last night that he was sacked.
 <https://twitter.com/hirstclass/status/734749012012699649> May 23, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/hirstclass/status/734749012012699649> 
That is kind of him. Perhaps Woodward is now travelling the nation breaking 
the news in person to the entire UK population, one by one. Slowly.

Please let it be my turn soon.

Thanks to @LukkaSamir on Twitter for tipping me off about yesterday’s big 
events near Strasbourg, where Arsène Wenger opened the Stade Arsène Wenger. 
Will they ever have to update thosepalmarès, though?

Hello again! A couple of key updates for you:

 * Jose Mourinho has gone back home.

 * Paul Gilroy QC, the employment lawyer working on the whole severance thing, 
has left Carrington. He’s probably also on the way home. 
 * There is, however, no news on when Louis van Gaal is going home. Facebook

A bit of ‘news’ from  Aryadita Balakrishnan  someone who would prefer to 
remain nameless now:

Just heard from Hoek, a close family friend, Louis is keen on picking up the 
vacant position in Amsterdam for a last hurrah with Ajax.

Remains to be seen whether he’d be sacked though.

Remember that Van der Sar called LvG ‘the best trainer I ever had’. Which 
implies he was better than SAF, according to Van der Sar.

I think a lot of people have been regretting jumping aboard the LVG bandwagon 
for a while now Jurjen, but a vaild point nonetheless.

Intriguing. Who could it possibly be?

<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/734829918698242048>  
It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> FC, and in doing so, I 
have fulfilled a long-held ambition.

I am immensely proud to have helped United win the FA Cup for the 12th time in 
the club’s history. I have been privileged during my management career to have 
won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, 
will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.

I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan. 
I believe that the foundations are firmly in place to enable the club to move 
forward and achieve even greater success.

I hope that winning the FA Cup will give the club a platform to build upon 
next season to restore the success that this passionate set of fans desire.

Having managed in Holland, Spain and Germany, I had always hoped for the 
opportunity to manage in English football and be part of English culture. Both 
of these experiences have lived up to expectations and been fantastic.

I thank my players and wish them well for next season. It has been a pleasure 
to work with them and it has been particularly rewarding to see so many young 
players take their chance to break into the first team and excel. I look 
forward to watching the continued development of these young players next 
season.

Thank you to the owners and board of Manchester United for giving me the 
opportunity to manage this great club.
 
Louis van Gaal is to leave Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, with immediate effect.

Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said: “I would like to thank Louis and his 
staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a 
record-equalling 12th FA Cup for the club (and securing him a title in four 
different countries). He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity 
throughout his time here. He leaves us with a legacy of having given several 
young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage. 
Everyone at the club wishes him all the best in the future.”

A decision on a successor as manager will be announced soon.
 
And there it is - confirmed on the Manchester United

After few hours to let the dust settle.. I thought I would write a few words 
on (Louis Van Gaal (LVG)

His unwavering belief in his methods is something to respect in many ways but 
it was also part of his undoing too.

Success (winning the league or CL) is what Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> demands & added to 
that an attacking, quick, aggressive & imaginative style of football.

Unfortunately LVG failed to bring either of those elements to the club.

He is huge personality who won an FA cup, keeping up his habit of winning 
trophies everywhere he has been but his‪#‎MUFC‬

 legacy will be the introduction of the players from the academy like Rashford,

They could delay the finalisation, I guess...
M. Yass (@TheFamedNeutral) 
@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> re idea LVG asked for delay. 
NYSE rules wouldn't allow it. They HAVE to announce when it's finalised.

“The Salmontini restaurant 
<http://www.salmontini.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/from-the-sea.pdf> 
Mourinho order takeout from offers a St Germain sauce for £2.50,” writes Martin 
Taylor. “I presume Jose showed initial interest but after negotiations decided 
it sound a bit boring.”

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooooo.
 
There might actually be something in this, from Henry Oundo:

“Van Gaal probably asked for a day to allow him leave the country before he is 
mobbed by his “friends in the media”... it’s the least United could do for him 
- an ounce of respect he must have asked! “
 
Can anyone top this offer of sustenance, from Claire McConnell?

“I have just made a delicious fish soup with cod, shrimp, BACON, cream, white 
wine and veggies. It’s delicious and if you are going to be there until July, I 
have lots of time to freeze it and have it flown over from Toronto. Just let me 
know.”
 
“While we are all waiting for news from United,” writes Dave Fox, “perhaps we 
could have a song from Louis.”
 
Oh Giggsy...
Samuel Luckhurst (@samuelluckhurst) 
Told Giggs' offer from #mufc <https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash> is a 
'downgrade'. Was described as having a 'face like thunder' at George's earlier.

It’s debate time! Should the players be more ashamed of themselves for downing 
tools or should we blame Van Gaal for creating such an atmosphere of ennui that 
the tools just slipped from their lifeless hands?

meat.
 
Technically. He opened his mouth and made noises, but they weren’t especially 
startling ones

“I give you this, I’m not leaving my house again today, so you should all go 
home,” he told Sky Sports.

So there you go. We should all go home, he’s quite right. He’s been out having 
a little wander, with his personal yappy attack dog Rui Faria and a chap with a 
beard & a cool leather jacket. Any idea who this gadge in the middle is?

It is with a heavy heart that, seven and a half hours after my first post,

No helicopter. No tunnel. No jetpack. When Van Gaal left Carrington it was at 
the wheel of a large, gleaming, soon-to-be-available-second-hand 
one-careful-owner Mercedes.

Jose Mourinho has got a takeaway! It’s from a restaurant called Salmontini, 
who are “located in the heart of Belgravia” and have “a fresh approach”. They 
sound like a fishy cocktail - an appletini for the committed pescetarian.

“You mentioned earlier that the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> shares have gone up 
amidst the excitement of Mourinho’s expected appointment,” writes Ben 
Mohammadi. This is true - apparently the Glazers have made £50m today on 
United’s increased valuation. “Perhaps the delay is because the United 
hierarchy are cynically riding out the high as long as possible before they 
announce Ed Woodward’s mum as the new manager.” Hmmm, I’m not sure the Glazers’ 
gains would survive that move.
  
“If I were LvG, I would have it written into my severance that the only way I 
were able to leave Carrington today would be via helicopter,” suggests Karl 
Gibbons. “No driving by the “media scrum”, and also a very cool way to leave. I 
am envisaging him hanging from an open door at the back waving a la someone in 
Die Hard or some such film.”

I’m starting to think he’s tunneling out.

Perhaps he’s going to sign for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, where fans are 
demanding greater on-field artistry, while Arsenal, whose fans have had enough 
of the artistry and just want to win something, will move for Mourinho? It’s a 
win-win-win.
 
I have to say that, while on a personal level today is turning into a bizarre 
and surprisingly lengthy form of torture, I’m starting to find the continued 
lack of statement quite funny. If they’re delaying it because they’re trying to 
cause the nation’s media a bit of trouble, they will spend five more hours 
watching us all liveblog like performing chimps and then, five minutes before 
the papers go to print, release their statement. On the other hand, they may 
just be incompetent/confused/being held hostage by an angry Dutchman.
 
Two things I’ve just learned:

At what point do we report him missing? Any signs of United installing a new 
patio?
 Paul Hirst (@hirstclass) 
Sounds like Woodward actually told LVG in person last night that he was sacked.

That is kind of him. Perhaps Woodward is now travelling the nation breaking 
the news in person to the entire UK population, one by one. Slowly.

Please let it be my turn soon.

Hello again! A couple of key updates for you:

 * Jose Mourinho has gone back home.

 * Paul Gilroy QC, the employment lawyer working on the whole severance thing, 
has left Carrington. He’s probably also on the way home. 
 * There is, however, no news on when Louis van Gaal is going home.  
Right that’s all from me. Much to my relief, Simon is back to talk you through 
the rest of this momentous day.

Cheerio!

A bit of ‘news’ from  Aryadita Balakrishnan  someone who would prefer to 
remain nameless now:

Just heard from Hoek, a close family friend, Louis is keen on picking up the 
vacant position in Amsterdam for a last hurrah with Ajax.

Remains to be seen whether he’d be sacked though.

 
Remember that Van der Sar called LvG ‘the best trainer I ever had’. Which 
implies he was better than SAF, according to Van der Sar.

I think a lot of people have been regretting jumping aboard the LVG bandwagon 
for a while now Jurjen, but a vaild point nonetheless.
