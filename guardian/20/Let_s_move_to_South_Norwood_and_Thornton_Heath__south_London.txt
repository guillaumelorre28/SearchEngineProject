What’s going for it? Not every square metre of London is swarming with 
oligarchs, hepcat hipsters and buy-to-let investors from Hong Kong. There is 
another London: it’s still there, holding out against the tabloid headlines, 
with its chicken shops, “continental” greengrocers, kebab spots and 
unreconstructed caffs. And this is it. Wedged between Croydon and Upper Norwood 
(so posh it likes to call itself Crystal Palace these days) is a huge, humdrum 
wodge of the capital. That’s not to say there aren’t sublime spots: the Norwood 
Lakes, the restored pomp of the Stanley Halls. The unrelenting strips of 
pebbledash could get claustrophobic were it not for the geography, the 
landscape folding this way and that in the foothills of the alps of Crystal 
Palace.

The case against Suburban claustrophobia. There are some rather gloomy patches 
and some of the housing can be a bit drab (lots of pebbledash; and Ilike 
pebbledash).

Well connected? Trains: seven or eight an hour from Norwood Junction to London 
Bridge or London Victoria (17-34 mins). Overground: every 15 mins to Canada 
Water (23 mins) and Shoreditch (33 mins); or to West Croydon (five minutes). 
Harrington Road is on the Tramlink.
