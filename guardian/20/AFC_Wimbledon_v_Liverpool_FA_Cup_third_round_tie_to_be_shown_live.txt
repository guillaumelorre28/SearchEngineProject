The rematch of the 1988 FA Cup final between Liverpool and AFC Wimbledon

Lawrie Sanchez’s goal and Dave Beasant’s penalty save

 at Wembley provided one of the biggest shocks in the competition’s history and 
nearly 27 years later, their reunion at AFC Wimbledon’s Kingsmeadow Stadium 
will be shown live on the BBC on Monday 5 January at 7.55pm.

With no matches being covered live on Saturday, the weekend’s action will kick 
off with Crystal Palace’s trip to face Conference side Dover Athletic at 1pm on 
Sunday 4 January. That is followed by Manchester United’s visit to either
Accrington Stanley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/accringtonstanley> or 
Yeovil Town at 3.30pm, with the BBC showing a rematch of last year’s final 
between Arsenal and Hull City at 5.30pm.

After Liverpool’s trip to south-west London, BT Sport will then show Everton’s 
home tie against West Ham United on Tuesday night, with kick off at 7.45pm.
