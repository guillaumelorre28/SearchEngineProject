CP Snow’s essay on The Two Cultures (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-humanities-science-doesnt-have-all-the-answers>
, 21 November) was published in the New Statesman on 6 October 1956 – also the 
day of Bobby Charlton’s Manchester United debut and my wife Lucy’s birth. For 
what it’s worth, I’m unrepentantly on the FR Leavis side of the debate: science 
can learn far more from the humanities than the other way round.

• During the 1960s coypu eradication campaign in the Norfolk Broads, my mother 
regularly served a tasty coypu stew, including, on one occasion, to newspaper 
and BBC journalists (Waiter, there’s a rat in my burger: rodent on the menu in 
Moscow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/hot-rat-is-so-hot-right-now-moscow-falls-for-the-rodent-burger>
, 19 November). We children were under strict instructions to say, if asked,

• The French have been eating nutria (coypu) for years. On the Île d’Oléron 
you can buy jars of very tastyrillettes de ragondin, made from local nutria – 
and just down the road you can, for a modest fee, visit Le Parc Myocastor, 
where you can stroke and feed tame specimens of the same species.

• Nice to see some column inches devoted to women’s rugby alongside the 
previews of the men’s autumn Tests in Saturday’s Sport supplement. But no 
preview of Scotland’s match with Argentina. Aren’t we still part of the union?

• The proposal that a future female US president might be chosen at birth and 
educated into the role (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/17/foodies-flies-and-the-ultimate-school-photo>
, 18 November) is intriguing. However, this has been tried already. Our current 
monarch is the beneficiary of such a system.

• Have those who thought up the notion of “Jam” (just about managing) never 
heard of the White Queen’s dictum: “Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday – but never 
jam today” (Passnotes, G2, 21 November)?
