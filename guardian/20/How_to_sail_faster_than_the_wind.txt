On 16 November 2012, the Vestas Sailrocket 2 
<http://vestas%20sailrocket%202%20http//sailrocket.com> smashed the record for 
the fastest sailing yacht, with a speed of nearly 80mph in Walvis Bay, Namibia. 
You might expect this feat would require a hurricane-force wind, but in fact 
there was a mere 30mph breeze blowing. For modern high-performance yachts, boat 
design can be more important than wind speed for going fast.

The secret is that Sailrocket was not travelling in the same direction as the 
wind <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZVIj5TUSKE>. If the wind is blowing due 
north at 30mph, then the fastest you can sail north is 30mph. By aiming 
north-west, you can maintain the same northwards motion and add some westwards 
motion to achieve a higher net speed.

By sailing at 80 degrees to the wind, a boat could, in theory, travel almost 
six times as fast as the wind.

This technique relies on having enough resistance to stop the boat being 
pushed sideways by the wind. Traditional boats have a heavy keel for stability, 
but this makes them slow. Instead, yachts like Sailrocket have a hydrofoil 
resembling an underwater wing to keep them upright.The grip and the drag from 
this hydrofoil

determine the top speed, not the strength of the wind.

Yachts that sail on ice or sand have a solid surface to push against, and so 
can go even faster than boats on water.The sand yacht Greenbird 
<http://www.greenbird.co.uk/land-record> holds the record for a wind-powered 
craft at 126mph, achieved with winds blowing at just 30-50mph.
