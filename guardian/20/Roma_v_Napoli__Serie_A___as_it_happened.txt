The unfortunate truth for Napoli is that they didn’t do enough today. They had 
chances in patches but they didn’t play with enough intensity and the sting in 
the tale is that they’ve not just lost the league, they’ve given Roma hope of 
taking the second automatic Champions League place off them. Roma are two 
points behindNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli>, who can no 
longer catch Juventus. Five titles in a row for the Old Lady. It truly is a 
fairytale. Move over, Leicester.

Full-time: Roma 1-0 Napoli

That’s it! Radja Nainggolan’s late goal means that Juventus are the Italian 
champions for the fifth consecutive year!

GOAL! Roma 1-0 Napoli (Nainggolan, 89 min)

The title is heading to Juventus! Not that Roma care. This is a magnificent 
team goal and it began with Totti, who clipped a lovely ball over the top and 
into theNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> area. From there, 
Pjanic combined with Salah, who showed good feet and equally good composure to 
beat a man and then roll the ball back to the edge of the area for Nainggolan. 
From there, the midfielder opened up his body and stroked an accurate low 
finish to Reina’s left with the inside of his right foot.

83 min: Napoli thought they were going to score. Everyone thought they were 
going to score. The ball is flicked into the area towards Higuain and a flap 
from Szczesny sees it drop into the six-yard box. Hamsik comes steaming in, 
seemingly certain to prod it into the empty net, only for Rudiger to deny him 
with a spectacular challenge at the expense of a corner.

74 min: Lorenzo Insigne replaces Dries Mertens. Can he spark Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> into life? “Equal parts concerned 
and enthused about Florenzi’s injury,” says Barry Lysaght. “Concerned as, if 
serious, it would rob the football-loving public of a ding-dong, mouthwatering 
“who’s the best underrated right-back in Europe?” throwdown in Lille later this 
summer. Enthused as it means we need fear neither goals from the halfway line 
nor the goalscorer’s celebrations with elderly members of the Florenzi family 
who may be sitting near us in the stands. What about Dries Mertens? Seems like 
he’s having a fairly profitable afternoon. Anything for our Séamus to be 
concerned about there when Ireland v Belgium rolls around on 18th June?”

Mertens has been tricky and dangerous but there wasn’t much of an end product 
from the Belgian.

73 min: Callejon spins and sends a cross towards the far post. It takes a 
deflection and loops towards Maicon, who decides he might as well leave it and 
see if Higuain score. It’s a wonderful opportunity for Higuain but his shot is 
saved by Szczesny. But Maicon’s not done there. He decides to try and knock the 
ball back to the grounded Szczesny, just to test his keeper’s reflexes, and the 
Pole is forced to scramble it behind. From the resulting corner, Szczesny is 
forced to make another save, tipping the ball over his bar.

68 min: Mertens goes for goal again, this time for 25 yards. But again his aim

65 min: Higuain bewitches Zukanovic with a splendid turn that leaves the Roma 
defender in no man’s land, before rolling the ball to the left for Mertens, who 
dips inside and curls one wide.Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> have 25 minutes to find a goal.

60 min: Maicon plays a one-two with Nainggolan and charges into the Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> area on the right, but his low 
drive from an angle, possibly destined for the far corner, is tipped away by 
Reina. He’s scored from tighter angles, come to think of it.

41 min: Napoli achieve a rare double, getting wo players booked for committing 
separate fouls within the same attack. The first booking went to Koulibaly, who 
chopped down Perotti, the second went to Ghoulam, who caught Salah as he 
attempted to sprint on to the loose ball after playing a clever one-two with 
Perrotti. But for the foul, Salah would probably have raced clear on goal, but 
it was too far out for it to be considered an obvious goalscoring opportunity, 
and there was also a coveringNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> defender.

39 min: “I am embroiled in an ongoing dispute with a Roma-supporting Italian 
colleague about the relative merits of Alessandro Florenzi and Séamus Coleman - 
two of Europe’s best right-backs who don’t get the credit they deserve,” says 
Barry Lysaght. “One scores outrageous long-range efforts from the halfway line 
in crucial Champions League fixtures against Barcelona, while the other 
routinely slotted them over the bar from similar distances for his local GAA 
team, Na Cealla Beaga. The similarities are, obviously, endless, and the debate 
has only intensified what with us both nabbing tickets to Ireland v Italy on 22 
June in Lille. Based on what you’ve seen today, does Séamus have anything to be 
worried about?”

I think that Seamus Coleman has a lot to worry about, playing on the right 
side of Everton’s Wiganised defence, but Florenzi hasn’t done a so far. Hope 
that helps!

think about Chelsea trying to get him in a package deal with Pjanic?” wonders 
Sanel Aganovic. “It looks like they complement each other well in the midfield, 
and Pjanic would be a good Fabregas replacement?”

Will they need a Fabregas replacement?

29 min: With the Roma back four creaking - Florenzi has been off for treatment 
and Maicon is warming up - Higuain superbly plucks a high ball out of the sky, 
his instant control sending two defenders off in the wrong direction, and he 
looks certain to score. He appears to have done enough, with Szczesny committed 
and on the floor, but he aims his shot too close to theRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> goalkeeper, who makes a cracking 
save!

28 min: “I can only assume Big Ron’s massive coat gave him sunstroke and he 
forgot how outrageously brilliant Totti is,” says Rory McGee . Sure, Totti is 
definitely cynical, egotistical, a bit snide, a bit nasty and a bit of a bully- 
yet we’ll happily forgive players all sorts of on and off the pitch malarky 
time and again. In Totti’s case, how can you not? The man is pure unadulterated 
football. Passion and delightful skill in one. Plus he’s a much better “What 
could have been if only he’d moved clubs” example than Steven Gerrard will ever 
be. Incidentally, I reckon Totti’sRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> may be in with a shout for best 11 
made up of players to play with one other player at a club. Giggs, Gigi Buffon 
(even at Parma) and Iker Casillas are also going to do quite well at that 
tournament-do you reckon you could persuade Nike to set that up before the next 
world cup? Enjoy the Rome sun vicariously, I’ll be enjoying the football 
through you”

26 min: Mertens pierces the Roma defence with a stunning ball through to 
Callejon, who smashes the ball high past Szczesny - but the flag is up for 
offside! There wasn’t much in that. “Juve fan for 31 years now, and hoping this 
will be a draw,” says Cheta Nwanze. “Principally because this will be the 
sweetest scudetto of the last five given our horrendous start to the season, 
but also because I thinkNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> 
will do a better job in next season’s UCL.”

4 min: Other than that early chance for Salah, it’s been a cautious, tight 
start from both sides.

And we’re off! Napoli, all in blue, get the game underway at a sparsely 
populated Stadio Olimpico. And they almost make an awful start. Salah pounces 
on a dreadful defensive clearance and whistles a drive inches over the bar from 
the edge of the area. Pepe Reina was nowhere near that.

And here’s Francesco Totti at international tournaments. He was class at Euro 
2000; and less class at Euro 2004. But perhaps the best moment of his career 
came when a technical glitch meant thatBig “Ron” Atkinson was caught slagging 
him off live on air in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/nov/28/championsleague.sport2>. 
“He’s a little twat, that Totti. I can’t see what all the fuss is about,” 
Atkinson said during a Champions League game between Arsenal and Roma, unaware 
that his mic was on.

Despite his recent goalscoring form off the bench, there’s no place in the 
Roma 11 for Francesco Totti. With his time at Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> possibly coming to an end, what do 
you make of the great man? Worth the hype or overrated?

Hello. Away from the incredible Leicester City surge to the Premier League 
title, another fairytale is talking place at the top ofSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball>. It is only nine years 
since unfashionable Juventus won promotion from Serie B; today they stand on 
the brink of their fifth consecutive title. Production on the Mario Mandzukic 
film begins soon.

Juve’s 2-1 win over Fiorentina last night means that it will all be over if 
Napoli fail to beat Roma at the Stadio Olimpico this afternoon. And even then, 
it’ll probably still be over. Victory forNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> would leave them nine points 
behind the leaders with three games left. They have a substantially superior 
goal difference to Max Allegri’s side, so they still have hope. But come on. 
It’s not happening.

Serie A talking points: Juventus close in on title as Inter chase third place

Still, it’s been a fine season for Napoli. After missing out on Champions 
League qualification last season, they’re assured of a place in the top three 
this time and perhaps the more pressing issue than the title race is ensuring 
that they go straight into the group stage by finishing second. They can take a 
giant stride towards that goal by defeatingRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, who are five points behind them in 
third place. Yet it won’t be easy against Luciano Spalleti’s side, who need the 
points to move eight points clear of fourth-placed Inter. It’s all to play for 
on Italy’s Liberation Day!

Kick-off: 2pm BST, 3pm in Rome.

The unfortunate truth for Napoli is that they didn’t do enough today. They had 
chances in patches but they didn’t play with enough intensity and the sting in 
the tale is that they’ve not just lost the league, they’ve given Roma hope of 
taking the second automatic Champions League place off them. Roma are two 
points behindNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli>, who can no 
longer catch Juventus. Five titles in a row for the Old Lady. It truly is a 
fairytale. Move over, Leicester.

Juventus crowned Serie A champions after Roma score late against Napoli
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/25/roma-napoli-serie-a-match-report> 
That’s it! Radja Nainggolan’s late goal means that Juventus are the Italian 
champions for the fifth consecutive year!
 
90 min: There will be three minutes of stoppage time. From Roma’s perspective, 
winning here will keep their hopes of nabbing second place offNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> alive.
 
The title is heading to Juventus! Not that Roma care. This is a magnificent 
team goal and it began with Totti, who clipped a lovely ball over the top and 
into theNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> area. From there, 
Pjanic combined with Salah, who showed good feet and equally good composure to 
beat a man and then roll the ball back to the edge of the area for Nainggolan. 
From there, the midfielder opened up his body and stroked an accurate low 
finish to Reina’s left with the inside of his right foot.
 
87 min: Insigne wallops one over from 25 yards. It’s not happening for Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli>.
 
84 min: It’s all Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> now. Is 
there to be a late twist?
 
83 min: Napoli thought they were going to score. Everyone thought they were 
going to score. The ball is flicked into the area towards Higuain and a flap 
from Szczesny sees it drop into the six-yard box. Hamsik comes steaming in, 
seemingly certain to prod it into the empty net, only for Rudiger to deny him 
with a spectacular challenge at the expense of a corner.
 
82 min: Totti’s first contribution is to give a free-kick away.
 
81 min: A huge roar goes up around the stadium. El Shaaraway is making way ... 
for Francesco Totti.
 
79 min: Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> make another 
change, David Lopez coming on for Allan.
 
78 min: Maicon’s cross is blocked by Ghoulam. Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> appeal for handball and a penalty; 
nothing doing.
 
74 min: Lorenzo Insigne replaces Dries Mertens. Can he spark Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> into life? “Equal parts concerned 
and enthused about Florenzi’s injury,” says Barry Lysaght. “Concerned as, if 
serious, it would rob the football-loving public of a ding-dong, mouthwatering 
“who’s the best underrated right-back in Europe?” throwdown in Lille later this 
summer. Enthused as it means we need fear neither goals from the halfway line 
nor the goalscorer’s celebrations with elderly members of the Florenzi family 
who may be sitting near us in the stands. What about Dries Mertens? Seems like 
he’s having a fairly profitable afternoon. Anything for our Séamus to be 
concerned about there when Ireland v Belgium rolls around on 18th June?”

Mertens has been tricky and dangerous but there wasn’t much of an end product 
from the Belgian.
 
73 min: Callejon spins and sends a cross towards the far post. It takes a 
deflection and loops towards Maicon, who decides he might as well leave it and 
see if Higuain score. It’s a wonderful opportunity for Higuain but his shot is 
saved by Szczesny. But Maicon’s not done there. He decides to try and knock the 
ball back to the grounded Szczesny, just to test his keeper’s reflexes, and the 
Pole is forced to scramble it behind. From the resulting corner, Szczesny is 
forced to make another save, tipping the ball over his bar.
 
70 min: After Mertens is booked for diving, Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> almost find the breakthrough at the 
other end, only for Albiol to deny El Shaaraway with a superb last-ditch 
challenge.
 
68 min: Mertens goes for goal again, this time for 25 yards. But again his aim 
is awry, the ball fizzing over the bar.
 
65 min: Higuain bewitches Zukanovic with a splendid turn that leaves the Roma 
defender in no man’s land, before rolling the ball to the left for Mertens, who 
dips inside and curls one wide.Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> have 25 minutes to find a goal.
 
64 min: Maicon’s cross is only headed as far as El Shaarawy on the left, but 
the winger’s shot is deflected over for a corner, from which nothing occurs.
 
60 min: Maicon plays a one-two with Nainggolan and charges into the Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> area on the right, but his low 
drive from an angle, possibly destined for the far corner, is tipped away by 
Reina. He’s scored from tighter angles, come to think of it.
 
58 min: Get Totti on.
 
55 min: This will probably annoy European Football Experts everywhere, but 
watchingSerie A <https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> is quite 
sad these days. To think how good it used to be; the state of it now.
 
52 min: “Re: the comments on Totti, to be fair he hasn’t done that much for 
the national team – he kept his best for his club,” says Fritz Stelluto. “He’s 
a bit of a Le Tissier in that respect.”

I’m not sure that I agree with that comparison. He helped them win the World 
Cup!
 
50 min: It strikes me that Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> 
don’t have enough of a presence up front. Edin Dzeko is on the bench.
 
49 min: Hamsik breaks into the Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>
 area from the left, but his shot takes a deflection and goes straight at 
Szczesny.
 
47 min: Rudiger picks up Roma’s first booking for a foul on Mertens.
 
46 min: Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> get the second half 
underway.
 
There’s some bad news for Barry Lysaght. Maicon has replaced the injured 
Florenzi.
 
Unless Napoli score, Juventus will be confirmed as champions in 45 minutes. And
Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> haven’t really looked like 
scoring. Fortunately for them, neither have Roma.
 
45 min+2: A clever dummy from Higuain buys some space for Hamsik, but the 
Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> midfielder rams his 
25-yarder miles over.
 
45 min: There will be three minutes of added nonsense. This isn’t a very good 
game.
 
41 min: Napoli achieve a rare double, getting wo players booked for committing 
separate fouls within the same attack. The first booking went to Koulibaly, who 
chopped down Perotti, the second went to Ghoulam, who caught Salah as he 
attempted to sprint on to the loose ball after playing a clever one-two with 
Perrotti. But for the foul, Salah would probably have raced clear on goal, but 
it was too far out for it to be considered an obvious goalscoring opportunity, 
and there was also a coveringNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> defender.
 
39 min: “I am embroiled in an ongoing dispute with a Roma-supporting Italian 
colleague about the relative merits of Alessandro Florenzi and Séamus Coleman - 
two of Europe’s best right-backs who don’t get the credit they deserve,” says 
Barry Lysaght. “One scores outrageous long-range efforts from the halfway line 
in crucial Champions League fixtures against Barcelona, while the other 
routinely slotted them over the bar from similar distances for his local GAA 
team, Na Cealla Beaga. The similarities are, obviously, endless, and the debate 
has only intensified what with us both nabbing tickets to Ireland v Italy on 22 
June in Lille. Based on what you’ve seen today, does Séamus have anything to be 
worried about?”

I think that Seamus Coleman has a lot to worry about, playing on the right 
side of Everton’s Wiganised defence, but Florenzi hasn’t done a so far. Hope 
that helps!
 
38 min: Pjanic picks up a blatant booking for a cynical foul on Mertens, who 
was haring away down the left.
 
34 min: Nothing of much significance, but this was a fairly incompetent 
moment, twoNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> players sending 
farcically miscued volleys high into the area, another keeping the ball 
airborne with his 50p head.
 
32 min: Having cut inside from the right, Salah shoots tamely at Reina from 18 
yards. “With Nainggolan being more and more connected with Chelsea, what do you 
think about Chelsea trying to get him in a package deal with Pjanic?” wonders 
Sanel Aganovic. “It looks like they complement each other well in the midfield, 
and Pjanic would be a good Fabregas replacement?”

Will they need a Fabregas replacement?
 
29 min: With the Roma back four creaking - Florenzi has been off for treatment 
and Maicon is warming up - Higuain superbly plucks a high ball out of the sky, 
his instant control sending two defenders off in the wrong direction, and he 
looks certain to score. He appears to have done enough, with Szczesny committed 
and on the floor, but he aims his shot too close to theRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> goalkeeper, who makes a cracking 
save!
 
28 min: “I can only assume Big Ron’s massive coat gave him sunstroke and he 
forgot how outrageously brilliant Totti is,” says Rory McGee . Sure, Totti is 
definitely cynical, egotistical, a bit snide, a bit nasty and a bit of a bully- 
yet we’ll happily forgive players all sorts of on and off the pitch malarky 
time and again. In Totti’s case, how can you not? The man is pure unadulterated 
football. Passion and delightful skill in one. Plus he’s a much better “What 
could have been if only he’d moved clubs” example than Steven Gerrard will ever 
be. Incidentally, I reckon Totti’sRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> may be in with a shout for best 11 
made up of players to play with one other player at a club. Giggs, Gigi Buffon 
(even at Parma) and Iker Casillas are also going to do quite well at that 
tournament-do you reckon you could persuade Nike to set that up before the next 
world cup? Enjoy the Rome sun vicariously, I’ll be enjoying the football 
through you”
 
26 min: Mertens pierces the Roma defence with a stunning ball through to 
Callejon, who smashes the ball high past Szczesny - but the flag is up for 
offside! There wasn’t much in that. “Juve fan for 31 years now, and hoping this 
will be a draw,” says Cheta Nwanze. “Principally because this will be the 
sweetest scudetto of the last five given our horrendous start to the season, 
but also because I thinkNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> 
will do a better job in next season’s UCL.”
 
23 min: Mertens tries to bend one into the top left from the edge of the Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> area but he doesn’t hit it cleanly 
enough, allowing Szczesny to make a comfortable save.
 
22 min: Loud boos greet a brilliant surge through the middle by Higuain, who’s 
eventually toppled on the edge of theRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> area. But no free-kick is given.
 
21 min: Manolas does indeed trot off, replaced at the back by Zukanovic.
 
19 min: Manolas is still struggling after that blow from Higuain. He might not 
be able to continue; it seems that he can’t see properly. His team-mates are 
looking at him quizzically.
 
16 min: Higuain, back in the side after three games out, catches Manolas with 
a stray arm. The temperature rises. TheRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> players want Higuain booked but 
that’s not going to happen.
 
15 min: Emails please!
 
12 min: Mertens, who’s looking lively, twists and turns on the left, easily 
confounding Florenzi, but his ball into the centre falls into the vague area 
between cross and shot.
 
10 min: Pjanic stands over a free-kick on the left. He taps it to Florenzi, a 
few yards to his right, taking theNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> defence by surprise, but they 
recover to block the right-back’s shot.
 
8 min: Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> haven’t got going 
yet; they’re making quite a few errors in their own half, Roma’s pressing 
disrupting their rhythm.
 
6 min: Salah has started well. He tries to burst into the Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> area and goes down under a 
challenge from Ghoulam. No penalty.
 
4 min: Other than that early chance for Salah, it’s been a cautious, tight 
start from both sides.
 
2 min: It’s a sunny day in Rome. I want to go to Rome. I wish I was in Rome.
 
And we’re off! Napoli, all in blue, get the game underway at a sparsely 
populated Stadio Olimpico. And they almost make an awful start. Salah pounces 
on a dreadful defensive clearance and whistles a drive inches over the bar from 
the edge of the area. Pepe Reina was nowhere near that.
 
And here’s Francesco Totti at international tournaments. He was class at Euro 
2000; and less class at Euro 2004. But perhaps the best moment of his career 
came when a technical glitch meant thatBig “Ron” Atkinson was caught slagging 
him off live on air in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/nov/28/championsleague.sport2>. 
“He’s a little twat, that Totti. I can’t see what all the fuss is about,” 
Atkinson said during a Champions League game between Arsenal and Roma, unaware 
that his mic was on.
 
While we wait, here’s Paolo Bandini’s Serie A

Well blow me down. Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> beat

Despite his recent goalscoring form off the bench, there’s no place in the 
Roma 11 for Francesco Totti. With his time at Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> possibly coming to an end, what do 
you make of the great man? Worth the hype or overrated?
 
Roma: Szczesny; Florenzi, Manolas, Rüdiger, Digne; Keita, Pjanic, Nainggolan; 
El Shaarawy, Perotti, Salah.

Napoli: Reina; Hysaj, Albiol, Koulibaly, Ghoulam; Allan, Jorginho, Hamsik; 
Callejon, Higuain, Mertens. 
 
Hello. Away from the incredible Leicester City surge to the Premier League 
title, another fairytale is talking place at the top ofSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball>. It is only nine years 
since unfashionable Juventus won promotion from Serie B; today they stand on 
the brink of their fifth consecutive title. Production on the Mario Mandzukic 
film begins soon.

Juve’s 2-1 win over Fiorentina last night means that it will all be over if 
Napoli fail to beat Roma at the Stadio Olimpico this afternoon. And even then, 
it’ll probably still be over. Victory forNapoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> would leave them nine points 
behind the leaders with three games left. They have a substantially superior 
goal difference to Max Allegri’s side, so they still have hope. But come on. 
It’s not happening.

Still, it’s been a fine season for Napoli. After missing out on Champions 
League qualification last season, they’re assured of a place in the top three 
this time and perhaps the more pressing issue than the title race is ensuring 
that they go straight into the group stage by finishing second. They can take a 
giant stride towards that goal by defeatingRoma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, who are five points behind them in 
third place. Yet it won’t be easy against Luciano Spalleti’s side, who need the 
points to move eight points clear of fourth-placed Inter. It’s all to play for 
on Italy’s Liberation Day!

Kick-off: 2pm BST, 3pm in Rome.
