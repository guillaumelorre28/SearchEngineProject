I’m in the Lake Market in Kolkata, West Bengal, staring hungrily at the most 
beautiful crustaceans – giant armoured titans with spindly blue claws, unlike 
any prawns I’ve seen elsewhere. I’ve been craving these critters on and off for 
the two years since I was last here. My mum tuts with disapproval: when she was 
a child, she tells me, they were two or three times this size.

I was born and raised in England, but my parents came from Kolkata, and my 
extended family still lives there. Both sides of my family were originally from 
East Bengal (now Bangladesh). My father remembers my grandfather’s land 
becoming – almost overnight – a refugee camp for those fleeing the brutality of 
the 1947 partition. They moved to Kolkata three years later. My mother’s family 
came later, but already had a home waiting for them in the city. My grandmother 
had become concerned at the growing discontent in their homeland, and urged my 
grandfather to build the house in southern Kolkata by Rabindra Sarobar lake 
where she still lives today.

This place has been at the heart of every trip I’ve ever made to India. Coming 
back to Kolkata can be a shock, thrown from the swanky new international 
airport to the chaos of the city, air thick with pollution, unmarked roads 
crowded and screaming with horns. You might find it difficult to reconcile the 
chaotic sprawl of modern Kolkata with the refined splendour it once had. When 
the East India Company first sailed up the Hooghly river in the 17th century, 
they found small villages along its banks; trade built it into a grand capital 
that would come to be known, after London, as the second great city of the 
British empire. The spacious mansions and wide avenues fostered a unique spirit 
where culture could thrive. It was Kolkata that gaveIndia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> some of its greatest modern 
intellectuals and artists, icons such as Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray.

That affluence and aesthetic spread from Kolkata across its home state. It 
used to be said, “What Bengal thinks today, the rest of India thinks tomorrow.” 
But the city has been playing catchup for decades with the burdens placed on it 
by an ever-increasing population. Much of the old colonial architecture has 
fallen into disrepair. There is still beauty in the place, though – the elegant 
old mansions, with their crumbling masonry and tattered green shutters, stand 
still and silent over the beat of the city. Everywhere, there is energy and 
life – from the verdant shine of fresh vegetables seemingly sold on every 
street corner to the excited chatter of Bengalis going about their day’s 
business.

India is a country of rivers – and nowhere is that more true than in Bengal. 
The vast labyrinth of rivers and wetlands scattered across the region provide 
Bengalis with their greatest love: fish. Kolkata’s markets teem with an 
abundance so varied it is bewildering to the uninitiated. Piles of fat carp sit 
alongside catfish and the beloved ilish, an oily fish similar to herring. 
Venders sit astride imposing mounted blades calledbotis, ready to carve and 
scale fish for their customers. There is no hum of industrial freezers here; 
this is truly fresh fish, brought in several times daily on a convoy of 
bicycles, rickshaws and trucks to feed the city’s insatiable appetite.

In many western kitchens, fish is treated as a delicate ingredient suited only 
to gentle seasoning, some herbs and a squeeze of lemon juice. Centuries of 
honing their cuisine have taught Bengalis, however, that fish is robust enough 
to carry bold flavours. They fry it with onions, garlic and ginger, or poach it 
in broths with cumin, turmeric and coriander. My aunt will prepare the monster 
prawns we bought earlier in the traditional way, cooked in their shells with 
fresh coconut and mustard oil. To truly do them justice, you’re supposed to 
chew the shelled head and body to extract all their gutsy flavour. I can never 
quite do it – the crunch of the shells gives me the unpleasant idea that I’m 
chewing a giant cockroach. This earns me disapproving looks from my parents as 
I push the shells to the corner of my plate, a sin as terrible as throwing away 
the skin on fried chicken.

There is something else Bengalis are famous for, and that is their love of 
sweets, known locally asmishti. The city’s most famous sweet shops have become 
legendary institutions, closely guarding their secrets. During the many 
religious festivals celebrated throughout the year, the shops will be crammed 
with jostling customers. Some sweets will be prepared as offerings to deities (
prashad) to be consumed with reverence after receiving divine blessing. Others 
will be given as gifts, wolfed down eagerly by young and old alike. It is a 
shame thatmishti have failed to capture the world’s favour in the way that 
savoury Indian cuisine has. I love them, but concede that they are 
eye-wateringly sweet. As they are usually created from milk, massive amounts of 
sugar was needed to preserve these sweets in a tropical climate before 
refrigeration.

More recently, western-style bakeries have been popping up across the city, 
giving Bengalis another opportunity to indulge a sweet tooth. Domestic ovens 
remain a rarity in the average household kitchen and, for now, fruit tarts and 
choux buns are treats that have to be bought in. I wonder if that might change 
in the next few years, though. Perhaps we’ll see a new generation of Bengali 
patissiers combining a knowledge of eastern flavours with European baking 
skills to bring something new and exciting to the world. If it were to happen 
anywhere, I’d put money on it happening in Kolkata, inspired by the same 
marriage of east meets west on which this great city was founded.

Mustard oil is an essential ingredient in many Bengali dishes, where it is 
valued for its unique pungent aroma. It is subject to an EU ban as it is rich 
in erucic acid, which has been linked to heart disease in animal studies (in 
humans, the link has not been conclusively established). You can buy it in 
Indian stores, with a warning that it is for external use. Like numerous 
Indians across the world (andNigel Slater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/nov/26/foodanddrink.recipes> and 
many chefs in Europe and America 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/dining/american-chefs-discover-mustard-oil.html?_r=0>
), I cook with it and have included it in my recipe – but this is an individual 
choice.


(Serves 4)
20 king prawns, shell-on
¼ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp table salt
2 tbsp mustard oil (or vegetable oil, if you prefer)
2 bay leaves
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cumin powder
¼-½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder (according to taste)
1 white onion, finely chopped
80g desiccated coconut
400ml tin of coconut milk
3cm cinnamon stick
2 green cardamom pods
3 cloves

Keep the prawn shells on – they enhance the flavour of the dish immeasurably. 
Coat the prawns in the turmeric and salt, then fry them in the mustard oil (if 
using) on a medium-high heat for one or two minutes, until pink. Remove from 
the pan and set aside.

Bring a little more mustard oil to a medium heat, then drop in the bay leaves, 
the remaining turmeric, cumin and chilli powder, and cook for 30 seconds. Add 
the onion and fry for 10 minutes, stirring until soft and browned.

Add the desiccated coconut and coconut milk and bring to the boil, then reduce 
the heat to a gentle simmer.

Toss in the prawns and cook for five minutes. Add extra salt, if necessary.

Add the cinnamon, cardamom and cloves, and cook for another couple of minutes. 
Serve with plain basmati rice.

These little fried balls are my brother-in-law’s favourite mishti. They are 
traditionally made with milk solids, but a quick version can be made with 
powdered milk and flour. There is an obscene amount of sugar in the syrup, but 
as an occasional treat they can’t be beaten.

(Makes 12)
150g milk powder
40g plain white flour
1 pinch baking powder
200g double cream
400ml vegetable oil
400g caster sugar
40g golden syrup
115g water
1 pinch saffron (about 10 strands)
3 green cardamom pods

Sieve together the milk powder, flour and baking powder. Add the double cream, 
then knead into a smooth dough. Form the dough into 12 balls, working quickly 
and with a light tough – the balls should be free of surface cracks, which 
might cause them to burst when cooking, but also not too dense from pressure 
during rolling.


Heat the vegetable oil to a low-medium heat (about 140C/284F) and carefully 
tip in half the balls. Keep them moving in the pan for six to eight minutes, so 
they colour evenly to a chestnut brown, then repeat with the second batch.

Meanwhile, in another pan, gently heat the sugar, golden syrup and water, 
until the sugar has all dissolved. Bring the pan to the boil and add the 
saffron and cardamom. Boil for a further two minutes to thicken, then remove 
from the heat.

Remove the balls from the pan, shake off any excess oil and add them to the 
hot sugar syrup. Leave them to soak for a few hours before eating.
