<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> electorate.

issues such as the aborted greyhound racing ban.

 in the wake of the byelection, following an unprecedented 34% primary vote 
swing away from the party in the previously safe seat, which it had held bya 
margin of 21.7% <http://www.tallyroom.com.au/nswby2016/oraby2016>.

A recount was granted by the New South Wales Electoral Comission and was 
carried out on Monday.

Donato, a police prosecutor, won with 18,593 votes to Barret’s 18,543 and will 
become the party’s first MP in the state’s lower house when he is officially 
sworn in.

The community’s move away from the Nationals should send a message to 
parliamentarians, he said.

“The people within the Orange electorate were clearly not happy about the 
manner in which they’d been governed ... and they used their position and the 
opportunity to really make a statement,” he said after hearing the result.

“I think governments need to take that on notice that they need to listen and 
represent their constituents.”

The count has been subject to a number of ups and downs for more than a week. 
A misplaced bundle of votes briefly caused confusion last week. The Nationals 
then asked for a recount on Friday when results put Mr Donato ahead by 55 votes.
