Armson was the hero for the Vanarama National League North side, opening the 
scoring in the 17th minute from close range after Steve Diggin had headed a 
free-kick into his path.

Nine minutes later the Saints doubled their advantage when Diggin played a 
ball across the face of goal for Armson to slide in at the back post.

Jake Hessenthaler pulled one back for the visitors before the interval, firing 
in from a tight angle after the goalkeeper Laurie Walker had saved Bradley 
Dack’s shot.

Scott Wagstaff equalised in the second half, just moments after his 
introduction from the bench, poking in after the goalkeeper had pushed out Cody 
McDonald’s cross.

An own goal from the Gills goalkeeper Stuart Nelson restored the home side’s 
advantage six minutes into extra-time when a corner crept in at the near post. 
And Armson completed his hat-trick shortly after, curling an effort into the 
corner.

McDonald ensured a nervous finish with eight minutes to go, seizing on a 
defensive error and rounding the keeper to tap into an empty net. However, 
Gillingham could not force an equaliser.
