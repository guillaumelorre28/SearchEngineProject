Neil Lennon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/neil-lennon> has received a 
two-game touchline ban from the Scottish Football Association for his 
post-match comments at last month's League Cup final but Celtic's manager will 
face no punishment for being sent to the stand during the subsequent Old Firm 
game at Ibrox.

Lennon called the decision of the League Cup final's referee, Willie Collum, 
not to handCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> a last-minute 
penalty in the 1-0 defeat by Kilmarnock "criminal". He will serve an immediate 
dugout penalty for that transgression.

A week later Lennon was sent to the stands during the half-time interval at 
Ibrox. After a hearing at Hampden Park on Thursday, the Scottish FA said its 
disciplinary tribunal "imposed no further sanction on the basis that the 
half-game served outwith the technical area was sufficient".

Lennon has further disciplinary issues pending. The Northern Irishman is 
likely to be called to account for accosting the referee Euan Norris on the 
Hampden pitch after Celtic lost a controversial Scottish Cup semi-final to 
Hearts last Sunday. Subsequent tweets from the manager are also likely to 
attract SFA attention.

Lennon has received a letter asking him to explain newspaper comments made 
about referees before a Scottish Premier League match against St Johnstone. The 
latest indications, however, are that the case is unlikely to result in 
punishment.
