Full-time: PSG 1-1 Arsenal

It’s a satisfying result for Arsenal after a ropey performance. Wenger’s 
decision to start with Ospina was vindicated, as the Colombia made several 
vital saves, helped, it is true, but bad finishing by Cavani. PSG will curse 
their flakiness around goal, while Arsenal will take heart from the fact that 
they came back when being outplayed. Another thing to note is that Giroud is 
very silly. He had a chance to endear himself toArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans here by giving his team the 
fulcrum they needed; but all he did was throw a dumb shape and get sent off.

TWO RED CARDS!

Giroud and Verratti are dismissed for an off-the-ball kerfuffle. Giroud seemed 
to block a Verratti run, shouldering him to the ground. A stupid thing for 
Giroud to do when on a yellow but, really, it’s a sorry day when that’s deemed 
violent enough to warrant dismissal. Not sure what Verratti was judged to have 
done wrong.

chagrin. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images  Marco Verratti, right, pleads 
with Wenger after being shown the red card by referee Viktor Kassai.

90+2 min: Motta booked brushing off Giroud with a hand to the face. You can’t 
expect to do that to the lovely Giroud and get away with it.

90 min: PSG win a corner and one last chance, perhaps. They take it short and 
faff about. Cazorla relieves them of the ball and clears.

83 min: Ozil makes a shrewd run to create space for Iwobi to receive a past 
from Sanchez. Iwobi tries to curl a low shot into the far corner from 14 yards, 
Thierry Henry-style. Areola saves.

80 min: Ospina saves/Cavani bungles again. The striker showed speed and 
strength to beat Koscielny to the ball and run clear through on goal again. 
Ospina ran out to meet hi and won the ball. Cavani collapsed theatrically but 
was never going to get a penalty.

GOAL! PSG 1-1 Arsenal (Sanchez 78)

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> make PSG pay! The 
visitors got plenty of players in the box for a chance, and Ozil picked out 
Iwobi with a clever pass from the left. Iwobi took a touch and walloped it at 
goal, but Areola made a good block. Sanchez pounced on the rebound and hammered 
it past a couple of defenders and into the net from 12 yards!

75 min: Another promising Arsenal buildup founders as soon as they try to 
enter the PSG box. Giroud, it has to be said, has yet to make any difference. 
But thanks to PSG’s wastefulness,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> may just have to get one attack 
right to salvage a point from this ordeal.

71 min: Ospina to the rescue once more! This time, however, he was at the 
origin of the chance, as his slack pass put Koscielny in trouble and allowed 
PSG to win possession on the edge of the box. The keeper atoned by pushing Di 
Maria’s shot over the bar.

69 min: Ospina saves Arsenal again! Or, if you prefer, Cavani misses another 
sitter. Again the chance came from a combination of slick PSG passing and 
muddledArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defending. When 
Cavani ran through on goal he tried to slot it under Ospina, but the keeper 
read it and saved well with his feet.

68 min: Aurier returns ... and nearly celebrates that fact by scoring. He 
exchanged a lovely one-two with Di Maria to cut theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defence open. Ospina did well to 
charge off his line and smother the shot.

be made to regret failing to capitalise on their superiority so far?

63 min: Encouragement for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. After a decent ove, Sanchez 
slipped a ball into the box for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who, for once, had made a 
dangerous run in anticipation of just that sort of delivery. Unfortunately he 
was unable to get off a good shot on the run and under pressure from a 
defender, so Areola had an easy save.

57 min: Arsenal’s second-half vim has faded. PSG are back in control, although 
not looking as polished as in the first half. A lot of errant passing by both 
sides. “If you were expecting changes you seem to have mistaken half time for 
the 70th minute,” quips Gavin O’Reilly. You’re right, I forgot: best wait until 
it’s 2-0 before throwing on a striker, making it 2-1 and clinching a valiant 
narrow defeat.

54 min: Di Maria dashes beyond the last Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender to collect a lofted 
pass from deep. Bellerin scampers back after him but the Argentinian is bearing 
down on goal ... but he takes a heavy touch, kneeing the bouncing ball too far 
in front of him, and then throws himself to the ground. The ref is having none 
of it.

Asked by Gary Lineker on BT what Wenger is like in the dressing room when 
things are going wrong for his team, an exasperated-sounding Ian Wright says: 
“He’s very calm .. he doesn’t say a word for the first 10 minutes.”

Here’s Angus Macaskill with the case for Wenger: “The team shape isn’t that 
bad, Wenger’s rationale being to use the speedy front three to counter quickly. 
The problem isArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> can’t get 
Cazorla and Ozil on the ball enough so can’t build attacks. Put Elneny on for 
Coquelin to get more control on the ball our from the back and use Elneny’s 
movement to create more space fro Cazorla.” Irrespective of shape, they’ll not 
get more control so long as they’re slower and weaker than their opponents. 
Let’s start with that.

A replay of the PSG goal confirms how much of a mess it was from an Arsenal 
viewpoint: everyArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender 
did exactly the wrong thing before Cavani scored. On the plus side, that sort 
of defensive ineptitude may have made Cavani complacent and caused him to 
bungle two even better chances later in the half.

“Reading the MBM from San Diego, thanks for the wry commentary.” ingratiates 
Jim Dunker. I am flummoxed at putting Oxlade-Chamberlain & Iwobi in the 
starting line-up, with Coquelin in midfield. After watching the ham-handed game 
on Saturday, a logical observer would think they rested Sanchez, Giroud & Xhaka 
then to start today, which is only a third right, and still mind boggling!”

Half-time: PSG 1-0 Arsenal

It’s been a no-show by Arsenal, and they’re lucky not to be out of the game. 
PSG have been far superior all over the pitch, especially in central midfield 
and on the right, where Aurier is a constant threat. If Cavani had been cooler, 
he’s have had a hat-trick by now.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have no one up front but being 
outnumbered and outplayed in midfield. It’s both a systemic and personnel 
failure and no proper manager can allow this to continue. It’ll be staggering 
if Wenger doesn’t make changes during the break.

42 min: A soft-shoe shuffle takes Verratti past Cazorla and brings cheers from 
the crowd. The Italian then offloads to Di Maria, who clips a lovely pass from 
deep to Cavani, who has beaten the offside trap and is face to face with 
Ospina, eight yards out! He takes the ball on his chest .... and falls over, 
kicking the air as he goes down. No danger in that, and no dignity. Another 
let-off forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, who could 
easily be three down. Wenger should have made a change by now: his pre-match 
plan is very obviously failing.

40 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have a bout of 
possession near the PSG box. Unable to break through, Coquelin eventually 
essays a dinked cross from the left. Oxlade-Chamberain, alone amid three 
defenders, was never going to make it look good.

a looping cross from Bellerin behind for a corner. Which comes to nothing.

pass through from deep. AnArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>

beat him to the ball but had an open goal from 18 yards ... but he was 
off-balance and skewed the ball wide with his left foot!

It’s a satisfying result for Arsenal after a ropey performance. Wenger’s 
decision to start with Ospina was vindicated, as the Colombia made several 
vital saves, helped, it is true, but bad finishing by Cavani. PSG will curse 
their flakiness around goal, while Arsenal will take heart from the fact that 
they came back when being outplayed. Another thing to note is that Giroud is 
very silly. He had a chance to endear himself toArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans here by giving his team the 
fulcrum they needed; but all he did was throw a dumb shape and get sent off.
 
Giroud and Verratti are dismissed for an off-the-ball kerfuffle. Giroud seemed 
to block a Verratti run, shouldering him to the ground. A stupid thing for 
Giroud to do when on a yellow but, really, it’s a sorry day when that’s deemed 
violent enough to warrant dismissal. Not sure what Verratti was judged to have 
done wrong.

chagrin. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images  Marco Verratti, right, pleads 
with Wenger after being shown the red card by referee Viktor Kassai.

90+2 min: Motta booked brushing off Giroud with a hand to the face. You can’t 
expect to do that to the lovely Giroud and get away with it.
 
90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. 
 
90 min: PSG win a corner and one last chance, perhaps. They take it short and 
faff about. Cazorla relieves them of the ball and clears.
 
88 min: Giroud booked for whinging. 
 
86 min: Pastore dabs a cross towards Meunier, who gets above Monreal but 
cannot steer his header on target.
 
Arsenal substitution: Elneny on, Ozil off. Wenger doesn’t want to let a good 
point slip.
 
PSG substitution: Meunier on, Aurier off. Monreal exhales gratefully. 
 
83 min: Ozil makes a shrewd run to create space for Iwobi to receive a past 
from Sanchez. Iwobi tries to curl a low shot into the far corner from 14 yards, 
Thierry Henry-style. Areola saves.
 
82 min: We’ve got a fun finale in store here: both teams seem to fancy a 
winner now.
 
80 min: Ospina saves/Cavani bungles again. The striker showed speed and 
strength to beat Koscielny to the ball and run clear through on goal again. 
Ospina ran out to meet hi and won the ball. Cavani collapsed theatrically but 
was never going to get a penalty.

79 min: So then, will Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
go on to win and give Wenger the last laugh?
 
PSG substitution: Pastore on, Krychowiak off.
 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> make PSG pay! The 
visitors got plenty of players in the box for a chance, and Ozil picked out 
Iwobi with a clever pass from the left. Iwobi took a touch and walloped it at 
goal, but Areola made a good block. Sanchez pounced on the rebound and hammered 
it past a couple of defenders and into the net from 12 yards!

75 min: Another promising Arsenal buildup founders as soon as they try to 
enter the PSG box. Giroud, it has to be said, has yet to make any difference. 
But thanks to PSG’s wastefulness,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> may just have to get one attack 
right to salvage a point from this ordeal.
 
PSG substitution: Motta on, Rabiot off 
 
71 min: Ospina to the rescue once more! This time, however, he was at the 
origin of the chance, as his slack pass put Koscielny in trouble and allowed 
PSG to win possession on the edge of the box. The keeper atoned by pushing Di 
Maria’s shot over the bar.
 
Arsenal substitution: Xhaka on, Coquelin off. How come none of you thought of 
that?
 
69 min: Ospina saves Arsenal again! Or, if you prefer, Cavani misses another 
sitter. Again the chance came from a combination of slick PSG passing and 
muddledArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defending. When 
Cavani ran through on goal he tried to slot it under Ospina, but the keeper 
read it and saved well with his feet.

68 min: Aurier returns ... and nearly celebrates that fact by scoring. He 
exchanged a lovely one-two with Di Maria to cut theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defence open. Ospina did well to 
charge off his line and smother the shot.

66 min: Aurier hurts his ankle as he lands following a header. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> play on while he receives 
treatment.
 
Arsenal substitution: Here comes Giroud, on for Oxlade-Chamberlain. Will PSG 
be made to regret failing to capitalise on their superiority so far?
 
63 min: Encouragement for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. After a decent ove, Sanchez 
slipped a ball into the box for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who, for once, had made a 
dangerous run in anticipation of just that sort of delivery. Unfortunately he 
was unable to get off a good shot on the run and under pressure from a 
defender, so Areola had an easy save.
 
62 min: Bellerin does well to throw himself in front of a cross by Aurier and 
clear it off the feet of Matuidi.
 
61 min: In this group’s other match, Ludogorets are currently winning 1-0 in 
Basel, so that’s whoArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> will 
be vying with for a second place.
 
59 min: Aurier - who is always free - races behind Oxlade-Chamberlain to 
receive a clipped pass. His first touch is hefty and forces him to slide in an 
attempt to get in a cross. He fires it into the sidenetting.
 
57 min: Arsenal’s second-half vim has faded. PSG are back in control, although 
not looking as polished as in the first half. A lot of errant passing by both 
sides. “If you were expecting changes you seem to have mistaken half time for 
the 70th minute,” quips Gavin O’Reilly. You’re right, I forgot: best wait until 
it’s 2-0 before throwing on a striker, making it 2-1 and clinching a valiant 
narrow defeat.

Oxlade-Chamberlain. Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters  
54 min: Di Maria dashes beyond the last Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender to collect a lofted 
pass from deep. Bellerin scampers back after him but the Argentinian is bearing 
down on goal ... but he takes a heavy touch, kneeing the bouncing ball too far 
in front of him, and then throws himself to the ground. The ref is having none 
of it.
 
53 min: The game has entered a sloppy spell, with both sides coughing up 
possession too easily.
 
51 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have had most 
of the ball this period, with PSG seemingly content to draw them on and hope to 
hit on the counter.
 
49 min: Ozil tries to pick out Coquelin, who had burst from deep into the PSG 
box because someone had to. Rabiot went with him and headed clear.
 
47 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> make a bright 
start, insofar as they string together a load of passes around the PSG box. But 
as soon as they try to put the ball in there, PSG win it.
 
46 min: No personnel changes. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> intend to carry on regardless. 
Wenger, it seems, intends to prove everyone wrong ...
 
Asked by Gary Lineker on BT what Wenger is like in the dressing room when 
things are going wrong for his team, an exasperated-sounding Ian Wright says: 
“He’s very calm .. he doesn’t say a word for the first 10 minutes.”
 
Here’s Angus Macaskill with the case for Wenger: “The team shape isn’t that 
bad, Wenger’s rationale being to use the speedy front three to counter quickly. 
The problem isArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> can’t get 
Cazorla and Ozil on the ball enough so can’t build attacks. Put Elneny on for 
Coquelin to get more control on the ball our from the back and use Elneny’s 
movement to create more space fro Cazorla.” Irrespective of shape, they’ll not 
get more control so long as they’re slower and weaker than their opponents. 
Let’s start with that.
 
A replay of the PSG goal confirms how much of a mess it was from an Arsenal 
viewpoint: everyArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender 
did exactly the wrong thing before Cavani scored. On the plus side, that sort 
of defensive ineptitude may have made Cavani complacent and caused him to 
bungle two even better chances later in the half.
 
“Reading the MBM from San Diego, thanks for the wry commentary.” ingratiates 
Jim Dunker. I am flummoxed at putting Oxlade-Chamberlain & Iwobi in the 
starting line-up, with Coquelin in midfield. After watching the ham-handed game 
on Saturday, a logical observer would think they rested Sanchez, Giroud & Xhaka 
then to start today, which is only a third right, and still mind boggling!”
 
It’s been a no-show by Arsenal, and they’re lucky not to be out of the game. 
PSG have been far superior all over the pitch, especially in central midfield 
and on the right, where Aurier is a constant threat. If Cavani had been cooler, 
he’s have had a hat-trick by now.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have no one up front but being 
outnumbered and outplayed in midfield. It’s both a systemic and personnel 
failure and no proper manager can allow this to continue. It’ll be staggering 
if Wenger doesn’t make changes during the break.
 
42 min: A soft-shoe shuffle takes Verratti past Cazorla and brings cheers from 
the crowd. The Italian then offloads to Di Maria, who clips a lovely pass from 
deep to Cavani, who has beaten the offside trap and is face to face with 
Ospina, eight yards out! He takes the ball on his chest .... and falls over, 
kicking the air as he goes down. No danger in that, and no dignity. Another 
let-off forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, who could 
easily be three down. Wenger should have made a change by now: his pre-match 
plan is very obviously failing.
 
40 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have a bout of 
possession near the PSG box. Unable to break through, Coquelin eventually 
essays a dinked cross from the left. Oxlade-Chamberain, alone amid three 
defenders, was never going to make it look good.
 
38 min: Aurier, unaware that he was under no pressure at the back post, heads 
a looping cross from Bellerin behind for a corner. Which comes to nothing.
 
36 min: Another corner to PSG, after a long and varied buildup. They’re 
schoolingArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> at the moment.
 
34 min: What a miss! What sweet mercy for Arsenal! Verratti sent a teasing low 
pass through from deep. AnArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>
 defender got a touch to it and Ospina hared off his line to clear. But Cavani 
beat him to the ball but had an open goal from 18 yards ... but he was 
off-balance and skewed the ball wide with his left foot!

33 min: Aurier and Verratti combine slickly before teeing up Di Maria. He 
fakes a shot before slipping the ball wide to Maxwell, who tries to ping in a 
first-time cross. Bellerin puts it out for a corner.
