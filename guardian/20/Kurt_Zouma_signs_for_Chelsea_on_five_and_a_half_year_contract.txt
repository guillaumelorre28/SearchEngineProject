Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Kurt Zouma from St Etienne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stetienne>, where the defender will 
remain on loan for the rest of the season.

The 19-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half year contract at Stamford Bridge 
and has joined for a fee believed to be £12.5m.

He will remain in France for the rest of the season, before joining up with his
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> team-mates at the end of 
this campaign.

The Chelsea manager José Mourinho said Zouma is Chelsea's fourth and final 
signing of the transfer window, following the captures of the midfielder 
Nemanja Matic from Benfica, Mohamed Salah from Basel and Bertrand Traoré, who 
immediately was sent on loan to Vitesse Arnhem.

"Job done," Mourinho said. "The last one in the transfer window. In almost 
every position we have the present and also the future."

Chelsea moved for Zouma as other sides were lining up to recruit the defender, 
who could spend next season on loan or at Stamford Bridge.

"If we don't do it now, probably we can't do it in the summer because other 
clubs were also very strong on him," Mourinho added.

"So we did it, now he stays at St Etienne, pre-season he will join us. We will 
see if it is to stay or if it is to go on loan."

Mourinho has spoken of building a team for the next decade and Zouma's 
acquisition fits with his brief of recruiting young players full of potential.

Mourinho added: "He's another young player in the profile of some Chelsea 
signed in the couple of last years.

"We liked the profile, we think he's very much adapted to the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>.

"He is a young player for a position where we also need the future.

"He's a player with big potential, physically ready. One thing is to be 
physically ready, another thing is to be tactically ready. Well done Chelsea."
