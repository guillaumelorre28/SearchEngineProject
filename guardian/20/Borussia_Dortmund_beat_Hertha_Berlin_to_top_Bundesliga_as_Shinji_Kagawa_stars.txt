Shinji Kagawa helped set up two goals as Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> beat Hertha Berlin 3-1 
on Sunday to go back top of the Bundesliga on goal difference, ahead of the 
champions Bayern Munich.

Kagawa, who looks to have rediscovered his form this season, charged through 
in the 27th minute and sailed a perfect cross to the far post for Mats Hummels 
to head in.

Kagawa then chipped a brilliant pass for Matthias Ginter, whose cut back in 
the box found Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the Gabon international had no 
trouble netting his third goal in three games this season.

The 26-year-old crowd favourite had won two Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> titles in 2011 and 
2012 with Dortmund before joining Manchester United for an inconsistent 
two-year spell, and returned last year.

Kagawa had the chance to score one himself in the 73rd minute but his 20-yard 
drive sailed narrowly wide with keeper Thomas Kraft out of position.

Hertha cut the deficit with substitute Salomon Kalou, who looked to be 
offside, tapping in on the rebound after a save from keeper Roman Buerki, but 
Adrian Ramos scored in stoppage time to make sure Dortmund went top on goal 
difference.
