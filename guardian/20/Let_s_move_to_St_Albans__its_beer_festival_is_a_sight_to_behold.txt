What’s going for it? St Albans is a Goldilocks kind of place: it’s just right. 
Old (one of Britain’s oldest settlements), but not over-preserved. Not too 
frantic and urban, not too dull and commutery. Dense, but green and verdant. 
The city centre is a historical delight, high on a hill and folded into 
Verulamium park, bursting with Roman remains and ancient trees. Not too big, 
not too small. Technically speaking, it’s a city, with a ma-hoo-sive cathedral 
abbey (including England’s longest nave, trivia geeks) and the cultural heft of 
a city; its beer festival is a sight to behold. But you can walk to the city 
limits. It’s perfectly positioned not too far away from anywhere in particular, 
20 minutes’ journey from central London, cupped by the M1 and the M25. Mum and 
Dad moved here in the mid-1960s; Let’s Move To… must be in the genes. This is 
where I began life in a starter home on a suburban cul-de-sac at the edge of 
town. Four decades on, though, there’s only one teeny tiny problem: the 
property prices. Just wrong.

The case against Some people might call it Posh Watford. How dare they.

Well connected? Trains: a dozen or so an hour at peak times to London St 
Pancras (19-34 minutes), and six or so north to Luton (about 15 minutes) and 
Bedford (40 minutes). Driving: on a good day, it’s an hour into central London. 
Plus you’re 10 minutes’s drive from the M25 and M1; half an hour to Luton and 
its airport; and about 45 minutes to Heathrow airport.

From the streets 


Bill Howard “The Odyssey cinema. Waited years for it to be restored. One 
screen, comfy chairs, tables and a few sofas. Best of all: the bar is open 
throughout the film.”


Gill Cairns “Twice-weekly market plus visiting French, Italian and farmers’ 
markets.”
