Full-time: Bordeaux 1-1 Liverpool

A useful away point for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> on a night gained thanks to a 
wonderful goal from Adam Lallana. With more composure and solidity they would 
have held on for the win but they remain fragile at the back and were punished. 
Worth noting a nice European debut from Rossiter, another joyful display from 
Coutinho and not an awful lot else. There are still far more questions than 
answers for Rodgers.

90+1 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> spending 
the final minutes protecting their away point as Bordeaux seek another 
breakthrough. After Sakho heads a cross clear, Lallana casually gifts it back 
to the home side, who resume their pressurising.

89 min: Wonderful strength and footwork by Maurice-Belay to set up a chance for
Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux>. Can, showing sound 
defensive instinct this time, gets across to deflect the shot out for the 
corner, which Mignolet then punches clear at the near post.

88 min: Corner to Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
after some purposeful and slick interplay, mainly involving Coutinho and 
Lallana. Bordeaux clear the corner as far as the edge of their box, where 
Brannigan retrieves it. His shot wobbles a few yards wide.

GOAL! Bordeaux 1-1 Liverpool (Jussié 81)

Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> dinked it around the 
box nicely, Then Crivelli took a pass from Jussié got it about 17 yards out and 
juggled the ball while battling with Gomez and Sakho. Gomez got a foot to it 
but only diverted it to Jussié, who fired into the net from 14 yards. In the 
whole thing, Can was in the the vicinity but ineffective, showing once again 
that he has no real defensive instinct.
 Jussie, left, fires home the equaliser ...  Then goes off to celebrate with 
the appreciative Bordeaux fans. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters

74 min: Nearly a second goal for Liverpool! Ings produced a beautiful first 
touch to take down a long ball from midfield and simultaneously elude Pablo. He 
then tried to recreate Lallana’s finish but the goalkeeper was forewarned and 
this time saved the low curler towards the far corner.

GOAL! Bordeaux 0-1 Liverpool (Lallana 65)

You see, that’s why I’ve been berating him all night - because I knew he was 
capable of that and was falling way short of his standards - and that is a hell 
of a way to make up for it. Lallana received a pass at the corner of the box 
with his back to goal, then spun and deftly nutmegged Pablo before using 
another defender to help target his shot, which he curled low into the bottom 
corner! A marvellous goal!

63 min: A let-off for Liverpool! Shoddy defending all-round. First Sakho 
didn’t do enough to prevent a cross from the right, then Gome and Can jumped 
for the same ball. Gomez met it but, being jostled by Can, he merely headed on 
to Maurice-Belay, whose eight-yard shot from a difficult angle was well parried 
by Mignolet. Crivelli couldn’t divert the rebound into the net because it came 
at him too fast.

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. They take it short, 
then eventually toss it into the box. Saivet heads it away but Rossiter meets 
it 25 yards out and unleashes a respectable shot. Saved by Carrasco.

Lallana, who turns cutely past the last man and fires at goal from 16 yards. 
Carrasco bats it behind for a corner.

51 min: See, that’s not really on. There was a couple of minutes of artless 
skirmishing by both sides before Coutinho injected a bit of guile and dash 
before rolling a perfectly adequate pass into the path of Lallana, who, if he 
had collected it, would have had the ball and space at the edge of theBordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> area. But Lallana was instead 
caught on his heels and failed to bring it under control so the chance 
evaporates.

Half-time: Bordeaux 0-0 Liverpool

Well, it hasn’t been a thriller but it has held a certain intrigue, 
nonetheless. As so often, it has been hard to know quite whetherLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are on the verge of finding an 
identity or completely collapsing, but they’ve been closer to the latter. It is 
plain that they remain a bag of nerves at the back and that hasn’t been helped 
by Touré having to depart injured. Rossiter has been useful in midfield but 
Coutinho is the only one who has looked capable of doing something really 
inventive. Lallana has been disappointing. Origi has been full of enthusiasm 
and made some shrewd runs but has received paltry service and not held the ball 
up well on the few occasions that he has been invited to do so.
 Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has got a bit of work to do at half-time.

41 min: A canny reverse pass from Coutinho (I think) finds Lallana, who 
dithers and then catches it under his feet before being dispossessed by a 
defender, whom Lallana then boots while trying belatedly to take a shot. An 
undignified episode, to be fair.

35 min: Chantome booked for steaming into Rossiter, who got to the ball first, 
something he has mad a good habit of doing so far. Early days, but if forced to 
make a ridiculously kneejerk prediction, I’d say this lad will go farther than 
Jay Spearing.

34 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> lost 
control of midfield a good while before the rejig but they attempted to 
reassert themselves just now and did so quite well with Chirivella contributing 
well to a patient move from back to front. It might have concluded with a 
Coutinho shot from the edge of the box but Lallana left the pass too short, 
allowing a defender to get to the ball first and divert it behind for a corner, 
which brought no joy for the visitors.

31 min: Rossiter takes down Rolan a few of yards outside the box. Freekick to 
Bordeaux. Mignolet orders a five-man wall - but there are two Bordealais in 
there aswell to complicate matters. Saivet lets fly and it deflects off one of 
theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> bricks, but 
Mignolet keeps close watch of it and saves comfortably.
 Simon Mignolet may have ordered a five-man wall he’s only got Philippe 
Couthino, Divock Origi, Emre Can and Adam Lallana lining up in front of him.

28 min: A new challenge for Liverpool: turns out that that rejig is required 
after all. Touré can’t continue so is replace by Pedro Chirivella, an 
18-year-old Spaniard. Can drops back into defence and Chirivella joins Rossiter 
in central midfield, whereLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> now had a duo with a combined 
age of one Steven Gerrard, give or take a few months.

27 min: Nice move by Liverpool! They work it forward neatly and then Origi 
gives Moreno a good option by making a clever run across the defence. The 
Spaniard rewards it with a perfect low pass and Origi finds himself with a 
clear sight of goal from 16 yards ... but he fires low and just wide!

26 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> try to 
settle things down with a bout of steady possession play. It’s going well until 
Can goofs - not for the first time - and gives the ball away in midfield.

20 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> are looking 
more composed now and popping the ball about craftily. Rossiter, as keen a 
tackler as there is on the pitch, intervenes in his own box to nod the ball out 
for a corner as the home side threatened to create another opening. The corner 
is well cleared.

18 min: Panic at the back for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> as another crossfield pass 
finds Maurice-Belay, who had eluded the attention of Ibe. That’s twice the 
wing-back has dozed off defensively (he’s been decent going forward). 
Maurice-Belay sought to punish him by laying the ball back to Khazri, who, 
under pressure, slashed at his shot and saw it swerve just wide from 12 yards.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are down to 10 men at the 
moment, with Can filling in at the back.

12 min: A jittery spell for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. First Touré is booked for a 
rash foul, then Mignolet makes an unnecessary drama of a routine clearance, 
coming out to punch a ball that Touré had covered and instead catching his 
team-mates on the side of the head. Touré is now receiving treatment.

9 min: Moments after a gentle overhead kick from Can brings a comfortable save 
at one hand, Liverpool are nearly caught out at the other end. Crivelli pinged 
a nice crossfield pass over the top of theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defence and Rolan took it down 
about 10 yards out. Mignolet hurtled out to intercept and Roland lifted it over 
him ... and over the bar.

8 min: No clear chances so far but Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fans can at least be heartened 
by the tempo and positivity of their play. Few token sideways passes, plenty of 
aggression and enterprise. Rossiter has started very impressively, showing real 
composure and tidy passing in midfield.

6 min: More promising play from Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, with Rossiter dropping a fine 
40-yard pass into the path of Ibe, who got to it and then lifted the ball over 
the head of Poundjé and tried to retrieve it on the other side in the box. The 
defender stretches out a leg and pokes it away. Ibe went down under the 
challenge but, without seeing a replay, it looked just about OK.

5 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win the ball 
in midfield and rip forward, Lallana feeding Coutinho at the edge of the area. 
The Brazilian has Moreno free to the left but decides to have a shot himself 
and drags a disappointing effort wide. Promising move, though.

2 min: So the early signs are that Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are indeed playing a 3-4-3, 
with the back trio being Touré, Sakho and Gomez. Moreno is the left wingback 
and has just showed his intent by dashing down the flank and sending in a 
cross. It was too close to the keeper but a fair idea.
 Liverpool’s Joe Gomez gets the better of Bordeaux’s Enzo Crivelli.

“The Reds in Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux>? I just 
hope the occasion won’t produce a case of fine whine served up by Monsieur 
Rodgers’ in the post-match press conference,” chortles Peter Oh. Feel free to 
call him a plonker, if only in the name of punnery. And actually, as a point of 
order I should mention that The Reds are all in white tonight. And before you 
pipe up, know that no one cares what you think about that, El Hadji Diouf.

Rodgers has had a pre-match natter with BT. About tonights lineup he said: 
“The idea is to hopefully get through in the group and also to take a chance to 
play players that havent played so much and also to take a look at some young 
players … by putting them in pressure situations like tonight. This is an 
opportunity for players to show they can play in the Premier League team. We’ve 
got good speed and movement in the team [tonight] ... tt’s important that we 
get that intensity and aggression in the team.

On another note, he was asked whether Jordan Henerson could be fit for the 
weekend and indicated that it’s possible, saying: “I’ll see tomorrow how he is 
tomorrow.”

Several people have emailed to say they can’t see the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> line-up, which suggests either 
that they are too lazy to scroll down to the bottom of the page or there is 
some manner of technical boobery afoot. Instead of exploring that issue, why 
don’t I just print it here again. Good idea:

Liverpool: Mignolet, Gomez, Toure, Sakho, Rossiter, Can, Ibe, Moreno, Lallana, 
Coutinho, Origi.

One of the question posed by the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> line-up concerns the 
formation: it looks like a back three. Does that mean Rodgers plans to revert 
to a back three in the Premier League this weekend too? If so, why not use the 
same players he intends using then? Maybe he is. Who knows? Let’s wait to find 
out. Is it OK for a media operative to do that these days?

Preamble:


Brendan Rodgers works in mysterious ways. So far those ways have brought 
nothing but embarrassment in Europe, especially on the road (no wins from 5 
matches, no goals scored in last four), and aren’t looking to clever 
domestically at the moment either. But tonight is the start of a new European 
campaign and maybe, just maybe, new clues will emerge as to the way forward for
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Most likely Rodgers 
has left out several regular starters because he is resting them for this 
weekend’s Premier League joust with Norwich City (sparing players a European 
tie against Bordeaux to preserve them for a home league match against Norwich? 
Does that sound right to you?) but you could argue that tonight’s defence is 
stronger than the one used so far this season: it’ll certainly be interesting 
to see how Mamadou Sakho does at centreback. The Frenchman has been given the 
armband too; a display of solidity and leadership should surely lead to him 
regaining his place for Premier League matches too. With Christian Benteke left 
at home, Divock Origi makes his first start: he’ll contribute speed and 
vivacity, at the very least, and could profit from through-balls from the 
returning Coutinho. Eyes will also be trained on young Jordan Rossiter, 
deployed in midfield in the absence of Henderson and Milner.

Bordeaux were no match for Liverpool the last time the sides met. But that was 
back in 2006, when Liverpool were on their away to another Champions League 
final and had this rearguard: Reina, Finnan, Hyypia, Riise, Carragher. How 
times change, eh? For tonight,Bordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> deploy virtually the same side 
that drew 2-2 away to Paris Saint-Germain last weekend. They proved adept at 
exploiting goalkeeping errors in that game, and that might not be a bad quality 
to have tonight. Another attraction to look out is the dinky scheming of Wahbi 
Khazri - the Tunisian trickster can be a delight when in the groove.

A useful away point for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> on a night gained thanks to a 
wonderful goal from Adam Lallana. With more composure and solidity they would 
have held on for the win but they remain fragile at the back and were punished. 
Worth noting a nice European debut from Rossiter, another joyful display from 
Coutinho and not an awful lot else. There are still far more questions than 
answers for Rodgers.

back to his players and applaud the travelling fans. Photograph: Lee 
Smith/Action Images via Reuters  
90+1 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> spending 
the final minutes protecting their away point as Bordeaux seek another 
breakthrough. After Sakho heads a cross clear, Lallana casually gifts it back 
to the home side, who resume their pressurising.
 
89 min: Wonderful strength and footwork by Maurice-Belay to set up a chance for
Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux>. Can, showing sound 
defensive instinct this time, gets across to deflect the shot out for the 
corner, which Mignolet then punches clear at the near post.
 
88 min: Corner to Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
after some purposeful and slick interplay, mainly involving Coutinho and 
Lallana. Bordeaux clear the corner as far as the edge of their box, where 
Brannigan retrieves it. His shot wobbles a few yards wide.
 
86 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> substitution: 
Gajic off, Guilbert on.
 
84 min: Moreno lashes a fine shot goalward from 30 yards. It was struck hard 
and true and demanded a decent save from Carrasco.
 
Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> dinked it around the 
box nicely, Then Crivelli took a pass from Jussié got it about 17 yards out and 
juggled the ball while battling with Gomez and Sakho. Gomez got a foot to it 
but only diverted it to Jussié, who fired into the net from 14 yards. In the 
whole thing, Can was in the the vicinity but ineffective, showing once again 
that he has no real defensive instinct.
 Jussie, left, fires home the equaliser ...  Then goes off to celebrate with 
the appreciative Bordeaux fans. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters  
80 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
substitution: Rossiter off, Brannigan on. It was a good European debut for 
Rossiter, who did a reasonable imitation of Jordan Henderson. Now 19-year-old 
Cameron Brannigan gets a valuable experience too.
 
78 min: Can diverts a cross worrying lose to his own goal, but it hits the 
sidenetting.Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> then 
overhit the corner.
 
76 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> change: Poko 
on, Saivet off.
 
74 min: Nearly a second goal for Liverpool! Ings produced a beautiful first 
touch to take down a long ball from midfield and simultaneously elude Pablo. He 
then tried to recreate Lallana’s finish but the goalkeeper was forewarned and 
this time saved the low curler towards the far corner.
 
73 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
substitution: Origi off, Ings on. The Belgian made some clever runs and worked 
hard but nothing quite came off for him tonight.
 
70 min: Ibe marauds down the right and lashes in a good low cross. Origi tries 
to get to it at the near post but a defender beats him there and sticks it 
behind for a corner.
 
68 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> change: 
Jussie on, Khazri off. So that sa striker for a creative midfielder.
 
You see, that’s why I’ve been berating him all night - because I knew he was 
capable of that and was falling way short of his standards - and that is a hell 
of a way to make up for it. Lallana received a pass at the corner of the box 
with his back to goal, then spun and deftly nutmegged Pablo before using 
another defender to help target his shot, which he curled low into the bottom 
corner! A marvellous goal!

Images  
63 min: A let-off for Liverpool! Shoddy defending all-round. First Sakho 
didn’t do enough to prevent a cross from the right, then Gome and Can jumped 
for the same ball. Gomez met it but, being jostled by Can, he merely headed on 
to Maurice-Belay, whose eight-yard shot from a difficult angle was well parried 
by Mignolet. Crivelli couldn’t divert the rebound into the net because it came 
at him too fast.
 
61 min: After a spell of blunt Bordeaux pressure, Ibe wins a corner for 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. They take it short, 
then eventually toss it into the box. Saivet heads it away but Rossiter meets 
it 25 yards out and unleashes a respectable shot. Saved by Carrasco.
 
58 min: Bordeaux reply by going close themselves, Saivet nutting the ball into 
the sidenetting after racing in front ofLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defenders to meet a corner at 
the near post.
 
56 min: Thats more like it! Coutinho darts infield and rolls the ball to 
Lallana, who turns cutely past the last man and fires at goal from 16 yards. 
Carrasco bats it behind for a corner.
 
53 min: The intensity that Rodgers demanded before the game? It has only been 
seen in spurts so far. It’s alarming how quickly thisLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> side lapse into casualness, 
sometimes even passivity.
 
51 min: See, that’s not really on. There was a couple of minutes of artless 
skirmishing by both sides before Coutinho injected a bit of guile and dash 
before rolling a perfectly adequate pass into the path of Lallana, who, if he 
had collected it, would have had the ball and space at the edge of theBordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> area. But Lallana was instead 
caught on his heels and failed to bring it under control so the chance 
evaporates.
 
48 min: A liverpool move breaks down after Origi plays a loose pass. Bordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> hurtle forward but Sakho brings 
an end to their conniving.
 
46 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> get the 
second half going.
 
Well, it hasn’t been a thriller but it has held a certain intrigue, 
nonetheless. As so often, it has been hard to know quite whetherLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are on the verge of finding an 
identity or completely collapsing, but they’ve been closer to the latter. It is 
plain that they remain a bag of nerves at the back and that hasn’t been helped 
by Touré having to depart injured. Rossiter has been useful in midfield but 
Coutinho is the only one who has looked capable of doing something really 
inventive. Lallana has been disappointing. Origi has been full of enthusiasm 
and made some shrewd runs but has received paltry service and not held the ball 
up well on the few occasions that he has been invited to do so.
 Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has got a bit of work to do at half-time. 
Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images  
45 min: Pow! Coutinho collects a pass from Moreno about 27 yards out and tries 
to do what he did it at Stoke, but this time his drive cannons back off the 
post!
 
43 min: More concerns for Liverpool, as Khazri collects the ball just inside 
the opposing half and scurries all the way into the box. Again noLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> player was decisive enough to 
make a telling intervention, all backing off or tracking other runners. They 
were fortunate that Khazri’s shot at the nd of it it all was weak.
 
41 min: A canny reverse pass from Coutinho (I think) finds Lallana, who 
dithers and then catches it under his feet before being dispossessed by a 
defender, whom Lallana then boots while trying belatedly to take a shot. An 
undignified episode, to be fair.
 
39 min: Rolan is allowed to take down a long straight ball from midfield and, 
with Sakho a few yards away, turns and smashes a wayward shot over the bar from 
18 yards. A band finish following slack defending.
 
35 min: Chantome booked for steaming into Rossiter, who got to the ball first, 
something he has mad a good habit of doing so far. Early days, but if forced to 
make a ridiculously kneejerk prediction, I’d say this lad will go farther than 
Jay Spearing.
 
34 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> lost 
control of midfield a good while before the rejig but they attempted to 
reassert themselves just now and did so quite well with Chirivella contributing 
well to a patient move from back to front. It might have concluded with a 
Coutinho shot from the edge of the box but Lallana left the pass too short, 
allowing a defender to get to the ball first and divert it behind for a corner, 
which brought no joy for the visitors.

31 min: Rossiter takes down Rolan a few of yards outside the box. Freekick to 
Bordeaux. Mignolet orders a five-man wall - but there are two Bordealais in 
there aswell to complicate matters. Saivet lets fly and it deflects off one of 
theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> bricks, but 
Mignolet keeps close watch of it and saves comfortably.
 Simon Mignolet may have ordered a five-man wall he’s only got Philippe 
Couthino, Divock Origi, Emre Can and Adam Lallana lining up in front of him.

28 min: A new challenge for Liverpool: turns out that that rejig is required 
after all. Touré can’t continue so is replace by Pedro Chirivella, an 
18-year-old Spaniard. Can drops back into defence and Chirivella joins Rossiter 
in central midfield, whereLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> now had a duo with a combined 
age of one Steven Gerrard, give or take a few months.
 
27 min: Nice move by Liverpool! They work it forward neatly and then Origi 
gives Moreno a good option by making a clever run across the defence. The 
Spaniard rewards it with a perfect low pass and Origi finds himself with a 
clear sight of goal from 16 yards ... but he fires low and just wide!
 
26 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> try to 
settle things down with a bout of steady possession play. It’s going well until 
Can goofs - not for the first time - and gives the ball away in midfield.
 
24 min: Another headed clearance by Touré. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are having to endure a lot of 
pressure here ...
 
22 min: Khazri cuts infield and aims a menacing ball towards Crivelli. Touré 
is well positioned and cuts it out.
 
20 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> are looking 
more composed now and popping the ball about craftily. Rossiter, as keen a 
tackler as there is on the pitch, intervenes in his own box to nod the ball out 
for a corner as the home side threatened to create another opening. The corner 
is well cleared.

18 min: Panic at the back for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> as another crossfield pass 
finds Maurice-Belay, who had eluded the attention of Ibe. That’s twice the 
wing-back has dozed off defensively (he’s been decent going forward). 
Maurice-Belay sought to punish him by laying the ball back to Khazri, who, 
under pressure, slashed at his shot and saw it swerve just wide from 12 yards.
 
16 min: Touré is back on. No need for a rejig. But go ahead and do a repeat 
dance if you want, all the same.
 
15 min: After prolonged dabbing with the sponge and so on, Touré still feels 
iffy. He hobbles off to continue treatment soLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are down to 10 men at the 
moment, with Can filling in at the back.
 
12 min: A jittery spell for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. First Touré is booked for a 
rash foul, then Mignolet makes an unnecessary drama of a routine clearance, 
coming out to punch a ball that Touré had covered and instead catching his 
team-mates on the side of the head. Touré is now receiving treatment.

9 min: Moments after a gentle overhead kick from Can brings a comfortable save 
at one hand, Liverpool are nearly caught out at the other end. Crivelli pinged 
a nice crossfield pass over the top of theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defence and Rolan took it down 
about 10 yards out. Mignolet hurtled out to intercept and Roland lifted it over 
him ... and over the bar.
 
8 min: No clear chances so far but Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fans can at least be heartened 
by the tempo and positivity of their play. Few token sideways passes, plenty of 
aggression and enterprise. Rossiter has started very impressively, showing real 
composure and tidy passing in midfield.
 
6 min: More promising play from Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, with Rossiter dropping a fine 
40-yard pass into the path of Ibe, who got to it and then lifted the ball over 
the head of Poundjé and tried to retrieve it on the other side in the box. The 
defender stretches out a leg and pokes it away. Ibe went down under the 
challenge but, without seeing a replay, it looked just about OK.
 
5 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win the ball 
in midfield and rip forward, Lallana feeding Coutinho at the edge of the area. 
The Brazilian has Moreno free to the left but decides to have a shot himself 
and drags a disappointing effort wide. Promising move, though.
 
4 min: Origi gets his first chance to show what he can do. His intention was 
commendably adventurous but his attempt to burst past two defenders failed.
 
2 min: So the early signs are that Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are indeed playing a 3-4-3, 
with the back trio being Touré, Sakho and Gomez. Moreno is the left wingback 
and has just showed his intent by dashing down the flank and sending in a 
cross. It was too close to the keeper but a fair idea.

1 min: We have kick-off! Bordeaux do the honours. And now, all raise a glass 
to Alex Adams, who submitted this: “In reference to Peter Oh, let me just say I 
predictLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> will win at 
decanter.”
 
The players march into the arena, which is only about 70% full but looks 
mighty smart.

For those of you who don’t want to simply imagine what the Nouveau Stade de 
Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> looks like five 
minutes before kick-off:
 
“The Reds in Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux>? I just 
hope the occasion won’t produce a case of fine whine served up by Monsieur 
Rodgers’ in the post-match press conference,” chortles Peter Oh. Feel free to 
call him a plonker, if only in the name of punnery. And actually, as a point of 
order I should mention that The Reds are all in white tonight. And before you 
pipe up, know that no one cares what you think about that, El Hadji Diouf.
 
Rodgers has had a pre-match natter with BT. About tonights lineup he said: 
“The idea is to hopefully get through in the group and also to take a chance to 
play players that havent played so much and also to take a look at some young 
players … by putting them in pressure situations like tonight. This is an 
opportunity for players to show they can play in the Premier League team. We’ve 
got good speed and movement in the team [tonight] ... tt’s important that we 
get that intensity and aggression in the team.

On another note, he was asked whether Jordan Henerson could be fit for the 
weekend and indicated that it’s possible, saying: “I’ll see tomorrow how he is 
tomorrow.”
 
Several people have emailed to say they can’t see the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> line-up, which suggests either 
that they are too lazy to scroll down to the bottom of the page or there is 
some manner of technical boobery afoot. Instead of exploring that issue, why 
don’t I just print it here again. Good idea:

Liverpool: Mignolet, Gomez, Toure, Sakho, Rossiter, Can, Ibe, Moreno, Lallana, 
Coutinho, Origi.
 
One of the question posed by the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> line-up concerns the 
formation: it looks like a back three. Does that mean Rodgers plans to revert 
to a back three in the Premier League this weekend too? If so, why not use the 
same players he intends using then? Maybe he is. Who knows? Let’s wait to find 
out. Is it OK for a media operative to do that these days?
 
“Hurray, you’re here!” booms Daniel Johnson. “I’ve been waiting for ages for 
this thread to open so the banter can begin. Not that I’ve any comedy gold to 
contribute - I’ll leave that to the professionals. TheLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defence should be on any 
minute ...”
 

Brendan Rodgers works in mysterious ways. So far those ways have brought 
nothing but embarrassment in Europe, especially on the road (no wins from 5 
matches, no goals scored in last four), and aren’t looking to clever 
domestically at the moment either. But tonight is the start of a new European 
campaign and maybe, just maybe, new clues will emerge as to the way forward for
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Most likely Rodgers 
has left out several regular starters because he is resting them for this 
weekend’s Premier League joust with Norwich City (sparing players a European 
tie against Bordeaux to preserve them for a home league match against Norwich? 
Does that sound right to you?) but you could argue that tonight’s defence is 
stronger than the one used so far this season: it’ll certainly be interesting 
to see how Mamadou Sakho does at centreback. The Frenchman has been given the 
armband too; a display of solidity and leadership should surely lead to him 
regaining his place for Premier League matches too. With Christian Benteke left 
at home, Divock Origi makes his first start: he’ll contribute speed and 
vivacity, at the very least, and could profit from through-balls from the 
returning Coutinho. Eyes will also be trained on young Jordan Rossiter, 
deployed in midfield in the absence of Henderson and Milner.

Bordeaux were no match for Liverpool the last time the sides met. But that was 
back in 2006, when Liverpool were on their away to another Champions League 
final and had this rearguard: Reina, Finnan, Hyypia, Riise, Carragher. How 
times change, eh? For tonight,Bordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> deploy virtually the same side 
that drew 2-2 away to Paris Saint-Germain last weekend. They proved adept at 
exploiting goalkeeping errors in that game, and that might not be a bad quality 
to have tonight. Another attraction to look out is the dinky scheming of Wahbi 
Khazri - the Tunisian trickster can be a delight when in the groove.
