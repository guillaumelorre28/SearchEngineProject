.

Lionel Messi <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lionel-messi> was also 
verbally abused and Espanyol will be reported to a Spanish government 
commission that seeks to combat violence, racism and xenophobia in sport, the 
Liga de Fútbol Profesional said on Tuesday.

A section of supporters at Espanyol’s stadium insulted Piqué, his pop star 
partner Shakira and their young son as part of sustained abuse of Barça, who 
won 2-0 despite having Jordi Alba sent off shortly after half-time. Alba was 
also verbally abused as he left the pitch, the LFP said.

Espanyol <https://www.theguardian.com/football/espanyol> are likely to be hit 
with a hefty fine over the incidents.

Racism and abuse has long been a problem at stadiums in Spain but the LFP is 
seeking to crack down following thedeath of a Deportivo La Coruña fan

 in fighting before their match at Atlético Madrid at the end of November.

Alves has been targeted by racists before and hit the headlines in April last 
year when he picked up a banana thrown from the crowd at Villarreal, peeled it 
and took a bite before flinging it away.
