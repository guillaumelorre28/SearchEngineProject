Ally McCoist <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ally-mccoist> has launched 
a sensational attack on Charles Green, branding the former Rangers chief 
executive as "an embarrassment".

The manager hit out after Green – who is set to return to Ibrox in a 
consultancy role – warned McCoist in theScottish Sun on Saturday that he must 
win a cup this year and that simply delivering another league title would not 
be enough. Hours later,Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
crashed out of the first round of the Scottish League Cup 2-1 after extra-time 
to Forfar.

At Station Park, when asked for his thoughts on Green's remarks, McCoist said: 
"I was appalled by them to be quite honest with you. The self-acclaimed 
straight-talking Yorkshireman has again let himself down. His contempt and 
total lack of respect for my players, for our football club, for our support 
and Scottish football in general is appalling – and he is an embarrassment."

Responding to the former Sheffield United chief executive's comments about 
winning a cup, McCoist added: "If it was a threat then the self-acclaimed 
straight-talking Yorkshireman should know that boys from the west of Scotland 
don't scare easily. If he does come back, I'll certainly go and pick him at the 
airport. I won't have a problem doing that. It's just more hot air that we've 
come to expect from Charles."
