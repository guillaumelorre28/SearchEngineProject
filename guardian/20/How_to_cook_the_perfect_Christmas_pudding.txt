Though it’s not fashionable to admit it in this age of chocolate 
tortilla-covered chips 
<http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/m-s-reveal-its-christmas-food-range-and-it-includes-chocolate-coated-tortilla-chips/story-29498524-detail/story.html>
 and salted caramel bombes, I bloody love Christmas pudding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/dec/21/consider-christmas-pudding>
. However many pigs in blankets have been put away beforehand, no matter the 
number of chocolates scoffed in place of breakfast, I solemnly swear I’ll never 
ever give in to the inevitable suggestion that we save it until Boxing Day 
instead. Partly because Boxing Day is for trifle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/dec/22/how-to-make-perfect-trifle>
, and I’m not missing out on that, but mostly because it doesn’t matter how 
full I am, there’s always room for a little wedge of fruity stodge on top of 
the mound of other food.

And though it may seem rather early to be thinking of Christmas, we’re only 
days away from what’s traditionally known as “Stir-up Sunday”, thanks to the 
opening words from the Book of Common Prayer’s collect for the Sunday before 
Advent, “Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people” – 
an unambiguous signal to dig out the silver sixpence and get mixing. Real 
pudding aficionados may have made them months ago, but, with more than a month 
to go before the big day, there’s still ample time to wield the wooden spoon.

Christmas puddings are as much about texture as flavour – they should be 
unapologetically dense, without being solid. Mary Berry <http://www.apple.com> 
makes hers with a standard cake base, creaming together butter and sugar before 
adding eggs and flour, giving a lighter, fluffier result which, although 
delicious, doesn’t seem quite in the spirit of the dish.

Traditionally, such puddings are made from breadcrumbs and, often, flour; 
Richard Boston 
<http://neilcooksgrigson.blogspot.co.uk/2008/10/88-richard-bostons-guinness-christmas.html>
, author of this very newspaper’s first beer column, supplies a flour-free 
version, which may be to blame for his pudding’s soft, slightly oily 
consistency – the flour clearly does a better job of soaking up the melted suet 
than mere breadcrumbs alone. Gary Rhodes 
<http://www.meandmine.me/2011/10/christmas-pudding.html> includes ground 
almonds in the recipe in Rhodes Around Britain, but I’d prefer to keep the 
batter fairly plain and allow the fruit to do the talking instead.

Raymond Blanc 
<http://www.raymondblanc.com/recipes/raymond-blancs-christmas-pudding/> 
suggests using brown rather than white breadcrumbs; once everything is mixed 
together, the difference is fairly negligible, but still, a couple of testers 
claim to be able to detect a slightly maltier note, which is enough for me to 
recommend them, though whatever needs using up should do the job.

Berry uses self-raising flour, and Nigella Lawson <http://www.apple.com> and 
Rhodes add baking powder to their puddings. Older recipes employ no raising 
agents, but tastes change, and a slightly lighter consistency should be welcome 
at this point in proceedings.

Everyone uses eggs in their puddings, but Boston and the recipe from Florence 
White’s Good Things in England, reputedly from the court of George I (though 
historian Ivan Day casts doubt on its provenance 
<http://foodhistorjottings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/pudding-king.html>), also add 
milk, resulting in a slightly squidgier texture we all rather like.

Boston and Rhodes’s stout also finds favour for the rich, almost savoury 
character it gives the pudding – less stridently alcoholic than Berry’s rum or 
White’s brandy, but a good match with the dark sugars and dried fruit. That 
said, we also prove suckers for Lawson’s fruit soaked in “sweet, dark, sticky 
sherry that has a hint of liquorice, fig and treacle about it” – doing it this 
way, rather than simply adding the booze to the mix and hoping for the best, 
means more flavour seems to find its way into the finished pudding. If you’re 
not a sherry fan, other sticky sweet alcohols would probably work, too, though 
I would respectfully suggest that madeira or tawny port might be a better bet 
than, say, Jägermeister.

 Gary Rhodes’s Christmas pudding: with grated apple and carrot. Photograph: 
Felicity Cloake for the Guardian 
The backbone, indeed the whole skeleton of a Christmas pudding, which should 
be cram-full of the stuff – the plums originally referred to raisins, but 
that’s no reason to reject the juicy prunes deployed by Lawson and Rhodes, 
though I slightly prefer the sweeter, crunchier dried fig in combination with 
sweet little currants and juicy sultanas. Feel free to make up the weight with 
whatever you happen to have on hand, however; Berry uses dried apricots, for 
example.

Rhodes and Lawson both add grated apple to their puddings, with Rhodes 
chucking in a carrot for good measure, a combination also recommended in the 
1922 recipe collected in Mary Gwynn’s WI Cookbook. I want to like this more 
than I do; the fresh stuff gives Rhodes’s pudding an almost mushy consistency, 
and testers agree they would prefer a bit more body. Eat more veg with your 
turkey instead.

Mixed peel is a must for me, because I love it, though if you’re able to find 
the candied citron called for by White, you’re a better person than me (as I 
discover too late, it is, inevitably, available online 
<https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/peel-citron-slices-250g.html?gclid=CMzT7JiaqNACFdMV0wodQe0F8A>
). I’m also a big fan of Berry’s blanched almonds, which add textural interest 
to a dessert that can sometimes feel a bit like it’s aimed at those who have 
mislaid their false teeth while napping during the Queen’s speech.

Sugar

Though all that fruit provides a hefty hit of sugar, a little more is welcome 
– it is Christmas, after all. Testers find Rhodes’s and Lawson’s dark muscovado 
a little too bitter for their liking, preferring the toffeeish sweetness of 
Boston and Berry’s light variety, though I will be sneaking in a little of 
Rhodes’s treacle, too, because it goes so well with the stout. Golden syrup or 
honey can be used instead if you’re not a fan.

 Florence White’s Christmas pudding: uses fresh suet, which gives a distinct 
whiff of the chippie. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian 
Steamed puddings are one of the few excuses we have to break out the suet, 
although for once, I’d steer clear of the fresh kind, which gives White’s 
18th-century recipe an almost greasy texture … and a distinct whiff of the 
chippie. Berry goes for butter, which, cold and grated, is a decent vegetarian 
substitute, though its lower melting point means puddings using it will have a 
denser texture than those made with suet – or, of course, you could brave 
vegetarian suet, if you can work out which contain non-hydrogenated vegetable 
oils from sustainable sources.

Flavourings

I’m going to keep things trad with the mixed spice everyone but Lawson deploys 
(she prefers cinnamon and cloves) and a little of Rhodes’s and Berry’s grated 
orange and lemon zest to add a citrussy freshness to the dish, though I shall 
not be using Boston’s and Rhodes’s lemon juice, because I don’t think Christmas 
pudding ought to be at all sour. If you taste the mix and disagree, however, 
feel free to add it to taste.

Storing and cooking

Rhodes suggests resting the mixture for up to a week before steaming, and, if 
you have the luxury of time, this will no doubt help the flavours develop even 
further. More important is to give it a long initial steam to caramelise the 
sugars – White suggests as much as eight hours, though I think Rhodes’ four 
hours is sufficient to cook them through.

 Felicity Cloake’s perfect christmas pudding. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for 
the Guardian 
Makes 1 x 1.4l/2½ pint pudding


400g dried fruit of your choice (I like 150g currants, 150g sultanas, 100g 
dried figs, roughly chopped)
50g candied peel
175ml pedro ximénez sherry
150g soft light brown sugar
1/2 tsp mixed spice
75g self-raising flour
Pinch of salt
75g fresh breadcrumbs, preferably brown
Finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemon and 1 unwaxed orange
150g suet
50g blanched almonds, roughly chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 tbsp treacle
150ml stout
75ml milk

Soak the dried fruit and peel in the sherry overnight.

Whisk together the sugar, spice, flour, salt and breadcrumbs in a large mixing 
bowl then stir in the zest, suet and almonds. Beat together the egg and treacle 
then mix into the dry ingredients along with the stout and milk – stirring 
should traditionally be shared by everyone in the household, stirring from east 
to west, while making a wish. Stir in the fruit and any sherry in the bottom of 
the bowl, and then taste the mixture and add a little more mixed spice or 
sherry if you like, and any silver coins, rings or other charms you might like 
to break your family’s teeth on.

Thoroughly grease a 1.4l/2½ pint pudding basin, including the lid, and spoon 
the mixture in – it should be no more than three-quarters full. Cut a round of 
greaseproof paper to fit the top, then cover with a lid, or two pieces of 
pleated foil. Wrap the whole lot in foil to ensure it is watertight. Steam in a 
steamer – or a saucepan with a saucer, or the lid of a jar, in the bottom – for 
4 hours, checking the water level regularly. Store in a cool place until 
Christmas Day, feeding occasionally with alcohol if you like your puddings 
boozy.

Steam for 1.5 hours then top with booze, light and serve with brandy butter, 
custard or (my favourite) ice-cream.

Am I alone in my wholehearted love of Christmas pudding, or does anyone else 
relish a slab of fruity stodge on the big day? And if you’re not a fan, what do 
you round off the meal with?
