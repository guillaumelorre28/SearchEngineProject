Hertha Berlin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin> says its 
team bus was shot at on Sunday before a German Cup match in Bielefeld.

The Bundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> club 
says no one was injured in the incident. There were no players on the bus at 
the time.

The Hertha general manager, Michael Preetz, told Sport1 that the bus was 
overtaken by a motorcyclist who threatened the driver with his fist and then 
pulled out a pistol at a roundabout. The shot did not penetrate the windscreen.

Preetz said: “It was one shot but we cannot say what the motivation was. The 
bus driver immediately called the police and now the search is on for the 
culprit. This was an attack on life and limb and not a trivial matter. It’s 
simply madness.”

Hertha are due to play Arminia Bielefeld on Monday.
