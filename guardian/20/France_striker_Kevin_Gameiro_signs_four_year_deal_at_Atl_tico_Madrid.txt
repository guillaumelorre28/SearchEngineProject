The France striker Kevin Gameiro has joined Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> on a four-year deal from 
fellow La Liga side Sevilla, last season’s Champions League finalists announced 
on Saturday.

Gameiro, 29, scored 67 goals in three years at Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> and though no financial details 
of the transfer were released, media reports suggested Atlético signed the 
France forward for an initial fee in the region of £28m (€32m).

“Atlético Madrid and Sevilla FC have reached an agreement for the transfer of 
Kevin Gameiro to our club. The striker, who will sign for four seasons, will 
travel to Madrid this evening,” Atlético said in a statement. “The transfer is 
contingent to the French player successfully undergoing a medical examination.”

Gameiro’s arrival is also likely put an end to Atlético’s hopes of re-signing 
the striker Diego Costa from Chelsea. “Diego Costa is our player,”the Chelsea 
manager, Antonio Conte, said this month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/19/chelsea-diego-costa-antonio-costa>
. “He’s a fantastic player with fundamental importance. He’s very happy and is 
working hard.”

Meanwhile, the Atlético forward Luciano Vietto has moved in the opposite 
direction by joining Sevilla on a season-long loan, with the Europa League 
champions having the option of reaching a permanent deal during the next summer 
transfer window.

Atlético Madrid finished third in La Liga last term and begin the new season 
at home against Deportivo Alavés on 21 August.
