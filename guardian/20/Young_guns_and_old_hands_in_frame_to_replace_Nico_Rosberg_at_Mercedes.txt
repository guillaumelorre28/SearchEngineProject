Max Verstappen

The most exciting driver in Formula One and almost certainly a future world 
champion. But he is under contract at Red Bull and Christian Horner would be 
incredibly unlikely to let him go. That, however, has not stopped the 
19-year-old frommischievously tweeting a screengrab of his phone screen 
<https://twitter.com/Max33Verstappen/status/804720896367849476> which showed, 
in what is presumably mock-up, the Mercedes chief Toto Wolff giving him a call.

Fernando Alonso

Under contract at McLaren until the end of 2018, he has long been unsettled at 
a team who have seriously underperformed in recent years. One of the most 
skilled drivers inFormula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> 
and a move to Mercedes would give him a car to match his talents but would mean 
a reprise of the turbulent relationship he endured in 2007 when team-mates with 
Lewis Hamilton at McLaren.

Sebastian Vettel

Endured another disappointing year at Ferrari in which he did not come close 
to adding to his four world titles. A move to the German constructor would suit 
him, and the thought of him and Hamilton finally racing in cars which match 
each other for performance would be mouth watering. Under contract at Ferrari 
until 2018.

Pascal Wehrlein

The simplest solution for Mercedes would be to promote a driver who is already 
on a development contract with the team. Though he spent 2016 racing for Manor, 
he has filled in for Nico Rosberg and Hamilton in testing and has been 
identified by Mercedes as a future star. The 22-year-old German could be 
offered a one-year deal to fill the seat until Alonso or Vettel’s contracts 
come up.

Jenson Button

Another decent short-term option. Button is, officially, on a year-long 
sabbatical from McLaren with a return to the team left open. However, he has 
acknowledged he is unlikely to return. A safe pair of hands to keep the seat 
warm for Alonso or Vettel while also picking up points for the constructors’ 
championship. Spent three years as Hamilton’s team-mate at McLaren and while 
they were not close, neither were they openly hostile.

Esteban Ocon

A Mercedes development driver, who made his debut alongside Wehrlein at Manor 
this season. However, he has agreed to drive for Force India in 2017 and, at 
20, is young and inexperienced. A complicating factor could be that Mercedes 
supply Force India with engines so, should the German team pinch their driver, 
it could lead to bad blood.

Valtteri Bottas

The Finn has signed up for another year at Williams but is a reliable and 
solid driver who could be the sort of under-the-radar team-member Mercedes 
could pair with the combustible Hamilton.
