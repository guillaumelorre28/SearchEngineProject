 on Saturday and have a game in hand over their main rivals at the halfway 
stage of the season.

Griezmann sent Luciano Vietto clear on the left four minutes into the second 
half and raced into the penalty area to sidefoot the Argentinian’s low centre 
past the stranded Celta goalkeeper, Sergio Álvarez, the France forward’s 10thLa 
Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> goal of the season.

With fifth-placed Celta pressing for an equaliser, the Atlético substitute 
Carrasco picked up a loose ball 10 minutes from time and galloped forward 
before cracking a shot high into the net.

Atlético, who have conceded a mere eight goals, have 44 points from 19 
matches, with Barcelona on 42 from 18 games.

“We knew it would be a tough game as Celta play the ball around well,” 
Griezmann told Spanish television. “But we were strong at the back and we know 
that when we have chances up front we can score at any moment.

“At the back and in attack we are doing things well and we have to keep it 
going.“
