A club statement read: “Chesterfield have parted company with manager Dean 
Saunders and his assistant Brian Carey following a 4-0 defeat at home to 
Swindon Town.

“An interim management team, which will be announced in due course, will take 
temporary charge prior to the appointment of a new manager.”

The chairman Dave Allen added: “We will not be rushed into making a decision 
on a new manager.”

Saunders, who made five changes to his side for the clash with the Robins, was 
not expecting the sack when he addressed the media after the game, but knew he 
had to start getting results.

He said: “It’s a results business and I have to get enough results for us to 
regroup as a club.

“As a manager all you try and do is survive long enough to get it right. We’re 
not in a crisis, we’ve just hit a bad patch and a couple of good results get us 
back to where we should be.”
