Bernie Ecclestone has once again confounded the sceptics, clinching a $1bn 
(£625m) deal to sell just over a third of hisFormula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> motor racing business to a San 
Francisco-based private equity specialist, Hellman & Friedman.

The move comes a week after Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, the venture 
capital arm of Deutsche Bank, abandoned attempts to bring a consortium of 
investors into Mr Ecclestone's business including the Benetton family and Tommy 
Hilfiger boss Lawrence Stroll.

Having in October bought a 12% stake in Slec Holdings, which owns Formula One 
Holdings and Formula One Administration, for £234m, Morgan had an option to 
take its stake to 50% for an additional £700m. But the London-based investment 
fund allowed its option to lapse.

"Bernie had Hellman & Friedland lined up as a fall-back all along," one source 
close to the discussions said - although Mr Ecclestone's family trusts have had 
to take an 11% cut in the price to get the deal done.

Hellman, run by former Jardine Matheson executive Brian Powers, has made 40 
substantial investments in the 16 years since it was founded, including a stake 
in troubled jeans maker Levi Strauss.

It has moved into the Formula One business ahead of a planned flotation of the 
operation, the timing of which remains as uncertain as ever. Mr Ecclestone is 
still waiting for a ruling from the European Commission on whether his 
company's grand prix broadcasting rights breach EU competition rules.

The dispute has led to a string of threats to pull grand prix racing out of 
Europe altogether, launching new racing fixtures in countries such as South 
Africa and Saudi Arabia in which cars such as the new BMW-Williams, pictured 
above being unveiled in Munich, would race.
