76 min: It’s very easy for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> now. Lille have faded badly, a 
crumpled shell of a team. Eveton could score more if they wanted, but there’s 
no need for that. They should just conserve their energies for bigger games 
ahead. Except you, Naismith, run, run, run until you can run no more!

69 min: Gibson spanks a lovely ball wide to Naismith, who eludes one defenders 
and then lays it off. But the Everton move then peters out. “Is there player in 
England more improved than Naismith?” wonders David Lamont. “He seems to 
squeeze everything from the talents he has. I remember well the derision he 
received in his first season atEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>.” He sure has been excellent 
this season, a really clever mover and sharp finisher. It’s really quite 
worrying, with next Friday in mind.

66 min: Roberto Martinez finally does the right thing: he takes McGeady out of 
danger and introduces Atsu in his place. Meanwhile, Barry limps off after 
committing a foul on Corchia that earned him a yellow card. On comes Darron 
Gibson: hmmn - Martinez gives with one hand and takes away with the other. 
Still,Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are in the groove 
and here is your chance to get into it too: a man called Liam has just emailed 
this tribute to James McCarthy.

GOAL! Everton 3-0 Lille (Naismith 61)

That’s a wonderful goal! Lukaku demonstrated excellent link-up play again 
before slipping the ball off to the overlapping Baines, who fired a low cross 
into Naismith. And the Scot finished with worrying style, teeing himself up 
with one shrewd touch and then slamming the ball into the roof of the net from 
nine yards.

53 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, picking their 
way forward for the first time in the second half, win a freekick in a 
dangerous position. It’s about 26.1 yards out and Lukaku, rather than Baines, 
fancies it.

49 min: As Lille huff and puff mid-way inside the Everton

school MBMs - a contribution from the lesser-spotted Gary Naylor.

James McCarthy is a magnificent player who, with this dearth of defensive 
players in Europe, must be worth £30M+. What a buy!@Paul_Doyle

47 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> seem resolved to 
play more of the match in the opposing half. “Why are Napoli wearing grey at 
home? storms Nicholas Merriman, who does not sound so aptly named. As to the 
question, let me answer it with another: why the hell are you asking me? I’m 
watching this Everton-Lille, a crucial preparatory fixture for next week’s big

46 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> get the second 
period going. Neither side have made any personnel changes during the break, 
nor hairdo adjustments, since you ask.

Half-time: Everton 2-0 Lille

Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are on easy street. 
There was a spell mid-way through the half when it looked like the visitors’ 
rope-a-dope strategy might work but Everton’s superiority eventually told and 
there seems little chance of the French side getting back into this. You can 
rest McGeady and McCarthy now, Roberto, please! but tell Naismith to run around 
more. Much, much more.

meets Corchia’s delivery with a decent header, but not good enough to beat 
Howard.

40 min: Lukaku’s touches have been a bit sketchy but he remains full of 
running and menace - and it took an excellent tackle from Mavuba on the edge of 
the area just now to stop him from getting off a shot.

35 min: A lull. “For some reason i find the idea of pinning Ireland’s hopes on 
McGeady intensely depressing,” weeps Hugh Collins. “Still, we always have Wes 
Hoolahan,” weeps Hugh Collins. McGeady is having a fine season, as are his 
club-mates McCarthy and Coleman - and I fear Martin O’Neill won’t start Wessi 
in Glasgow, especially due to injury.

33 min: A crisp finish from Lukaku this time ... but it counts for nothing, 
because the Belgian was offside when Barry made the cutting pass.

31 min: Wonderful skill by McGeady on the right - more of that next week 
please! - followed by a sumptuous cross. Lukaku should score from eight yards 
... but instead sends a weak header wide!

27 min: Mavuba was cautioned in the aftermath of that goal for clutching at 
the scrawniest straws, claiming that Osman handled the ball. He was wrong. On 
the day Osman put pen to paper to sign a new contract, the ref puts pen to 
paper to book impudent Mavuba.

GOAL Everton 1-0 Lille (Osman 26)

Lovely move by Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, 
featuring smart hold-up play by Lukaku and a good run and cross by McGeady, 
then excellent chest-control and a fine finish from Osman! The lemur will live!

24 min: Lukaku holds the ball up long enough for Barry to come forward and 
take it off him and then make a sprint towards the byline. It’s put behind for 
a corner. Baines floats it towards the head of McGeady at the far post and 
that’s never going to result in a goal, now is it?

22 min: Suddenly Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> have bust 
out of their shell: Mendes forces an awkward save from Howard with a swirling

clears the stand.

12 min: Origi gets a touch! I’d almost forgotten he was on the pitch. Not his 
fault: his team are showing all the adventurous spirit of a troglodyte hermit. 
By the way, if you don’t want to know the latest score from the 
Feyenoord-Rijeka match, stay right here. I have no intention of mentioning it 
ever again.

7 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are looking 
encouragingly sharp and seem to have enough penetrative qualities to get the 
better of a notoriously tough Lille defence. This won’t be 0-0, I’ll stake my 
(pet lemur’s) life on that.

4 min: This time Enyeama doesn’t look so nimble! he scarpered out of his box 
in a bid to beat Naismith to a flick-on from Lukaku but the forward got to it 
first. In fairness to the keeper though, the pressure as enough to prevent 
Naismith from getting a clean striker on it, so instead the Scot just prodded 
it past Enyeama but into the path of a retreating defender, who cleared the 
danger.

 Not so clever from Enyeama but Naismith fails to score. Photograph: Alex

3 min: Enyeama has to show his skil again, this time dashing off his line to 
intercept an attempted through-ball for Lukaku. It’s a buoyant start byEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> and an even better one by the 
visiting goalkeeper.

1 min: Off we pop. Lukaku to Naismith from kick-off, and Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> begin knocking the ball about 
nicely. And within 32 seconds Enyeama has to make a superb one-handed save to 
paw away a shot from Lukaku, who had been put through by a canny pass from 
Naismith!

Roberto Martinez, talking to the man from ITV, has just said that he expects a 
terrific game provided that “the weather respects football”. Right on cue, 
there’s a cloud solemnly sporting a RESPECT armband.

Preamble:

Hello, welcome and please leave your Champions League snootiness at the door. 
Because this is a proper European tie and we’ll brook no pettifoggery about 
that. Everton, the 1985 European Cup Winners Cup Winners Cup Winners Cup 
Winners Cup Winners, are rightly among the favourites to win the Europa League 
this season, and Lille have amassed decent continental pedigree themselves in 
recent years: indeed, tonight is their 100th European match since their first 
one just 13 years ago and in that period they have treated us to some fine 
feats, such as when they becamethe first French side to beat Milan at the San 
Siro in 2004 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF3DAt4yPHg>. True, Lille have 
not exactly been in scorching form so far this season, drawing all three of 
their matches in the Europa League so far and finding goals difficult to come 
by both abroad and domestically, but they’re also hard to score against, not 
least because of the excellence of Vincent Enyeama, one of the best keepers 
around. And, erm, if that well-intentioned build-up makes it sound like we’re 
on course for another stalemate, then remember that Lille have Divock Origi, a 
player who doesn’t find the net as often as he should but tonight will be extra 
highly motivated by the prospect of scoring the first of many goals on 
Merseyside (ahead of hooking up with Liverpool next season, see). Besides, 
gritty 0-0s can lead to great things, as Everton’s class of ‘85 could tell you, 
havingonly just squeezed by a band of plucky Irish students 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZR-RDz19Vg> on their way to their own chunk 
of glory.

close  
An emphatic victory from the hosts, featuring some sweet goals and several 
fines personal performances, notably from Naismith, McCarthy and Baines. If 
they continue to take this competition this way, Everton could win it. That 
would mean a Champions League place and GLORY!A bit like this 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2eh7P2NPzI>.

 Naismith and Baines celebrate on a good night for the blues. They held on to 
their 3-0 lead in Europe... Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty  
90 min: There will be at least three more minutes. In other words, keep 
running, Naismith, sprint, sprint, sprint!

 
89 min: Festive tricks from Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, as Baines and Naismith produces 
foxy backheels deep in the Lille half, eliciting yelps of glee from the locals 
and hot tears of shame from Lille.

 
87 min: Corner to Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>. It’s 
cleared as far as Beria, who tonks it high and wide from 25 yards.

 
86 min: Balmont booked for a late tackle on Baines. Ridiculous: the full-back 
doesn’t look a bit like Naismith.

 
84 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> sub: Besic 
trots on to replace McCarthy, who has been fabulous tonight and really should 
be given the weekend off as a reward.

 
82 min: Besic is limbering up on the sideline, showing more vigour than Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> are mustering in these dying 
minutes.

 
79 min: For those of you asking, Seamus Coleman has been rested tonight. 
Eminently sensible, I think we can all agree. Meanwhile on the pitch, nothing 
is happening because Lille have given up andEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are just toddling about. 

 
76 min: It’s very easy for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> now. Lille have faded badly, a 
crumpled shell of a team. Eveton could score more if they wanted, but there’s 
no need for that. They should just conserve their energies for bigger games 
ahead. Except you, Naismith, run, run, run until you can run no more!

 
74 min: In the other match in this group, by the way, Wolfsburg are beating 
Krasnodor 3-1.

Franklin/Bongarts/Getty  
72 min: Origi - yes, he’s still out there - skitters down the left and into the
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> box, but then runs out 
of space and support. Danger over.

 
69 min: Gibson spanks a lovely ball wide to Naismith, who eludes one defenders 
and then lays it off. But the Everton move then peters out. “Is there player in 
England more improved than Naismith?” wonders David Lamont. “He seems to 
squeeze everything from the talents he has. I remember well the derision he 
received in his first season atEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>.” He sure has been excellent 
this season, a really clever mover and sharp finisher. It’s really quite 
worrying, with next Friday in mind.

 
66 min: Roberto Martinez finally does the right thing: he takes McGeady out of 
danger and introduces Atsu in his place. Meanwhile, Barry limps off after 
committing a foul on Corchia that earned him a yellow card. On comes Darron 
Gibson: hmmn - Martinez gives with one hand and takes away with the other. 
Still,Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are in the groove 
and here is your chance to get into it too: a man called Liam has just emailed 
this tribute to James McCarthy.
 
64 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> making changes for 
the hell of it: Frey and Mendes off, Roux, Beria on.

 Thats more like it, Tim Howard celebrates Naismith’s goal. Photograph: 
Matthew Ashton/AMA/Corbis  
That’s a wonderful goal! Lukaku demonstrated excellent link-up play again 
before slipping the ball off to the overlapping Baines, who fired a low cross 
into Naismith. And the Scot finished with worrying style, teeing himself up 
with one shrewd touch and then slamming the ball into the roof of the net from 
nine yards.

 Steven Naismith shoots past Marko Basa and Simon Kjaer to score the third, 
another good finish. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty  
59 min: Eveton are starting to drift a little and Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> are attempting to profit. The 
French win a corner, but fail to make the most of it.

 
56 min: As if to emphasis Naylor’s point of a moment ago, McCarthy charges 
back and makes a superb tackle to snuff out a Lille counter-attack and launch 
andEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> on. 

 
54 min: Well struck by Lukaku! Hard and curling, forcing a flying save from 
Enyeama.

 
53 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, picking their 
way forward for the first time in the second half, win a freekick in a 
dangerous position. It’s about 26.1 yards out and Lukaku, rather than Baines, 
fancies it.

 
51 min: Origi has shifted out to the right as he seeks a way to weigh more 
heavily on the game. ButEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
have made light work of his threat so far.

 
49 min: As Lille huff and puff mid-way inside the Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> half, here’s a tribute to old 
school MBMs - a contribution from the lesser-spotted Gary Naylor.

Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) 
James McCarthy is a magnificent player who, with this dearth of defensive 
players in Europe, must be worth £30M+. What a buy!@Paul_Doyle 
<https://twitter.com/Paul_Doyle>
 <https://twitter.com/garynaylor999/status/530467101547716610> November 6, 2014
 <https://twitter.com/garynaylor999/status/530467101547716610>  
47 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> seem resolved to 
play more of the match in the opposing half. “Why are Napoli wearing grey at 
home? storms Nicholas Merriman, who does not sound so aptly named. As to the 
question, let me answer it with another: why the hell are you asking me? I’m 
watching this Everton-Lille, a crucial preparatory fixture for next week’s big 
game in Glasgow.

 
46 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> get the second 
period going. Neither side have made any personnel changes during the break, 
nor hairdo adjustments, since you ask.

 
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are on easy street. 
There was a spell mid-way through the half when it looked like the visitors’ 
rope-a-dope strategy might work but Everton’s superiority eventually told and 
there seems little chance of the French side getting back into this. You can 
rest McGeady and McCarthy now, Roberto, please! but tell Naismith to run around 
more. Much, much more.

 
44 min: Corner to Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>. Origi 
meets Corchia’s delivery with a decent header, but not good enough to beat 
Howard.

 
A powerful header from a corner, which had been won thanks to magnificent work 
by McCarthy and a good save by Enyeama from a Naismith shot.Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> well on course for victory now.

 Phil Jagielka powers in the second. Photograph: Rogan Thomson/JMP/Rex  
40 min: Lukaku’s touches have been a bit sketchy but he remains full of 
running and menace - and it took an excellent tackle from Mavuba on the edge of 
the area just now to stop him from getting off a shot.

 
38 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> work their way into 
an attacking position; Origi lofts a hopeful cross towards the penalty area, 
but there was no one there to receive it.

 
36 min: Gueye clatters into McCarthy. Listen, lads, just cut that out right 
now. Pick on Naismith, if you insist on clobbering people.

 
35 min: A lull. “For some reason i find the idea of pinning Ireland’s hopes on 
McGeady intensely depressing,” weeps Hugh Collins. “Still, we always have Wes 
Hoolahan,” weeps Hugh Collins. McGeady is having a fine season, as are his 
club-mates McCarthy and Coleman - and I fear Martin O’Neill won’t start Wessi 
in Glasgow, especially due to injury.
 
33 min: A crisp finish from Lukaku this time ... but it counts for nothing, 
because the Belgian was offside when Barry made the cutting pass.

 
31 min: Wonderful skill by McGeady on the right - more of that next week 
please! - followed by a sumptuous cross. Lukaku should score from eight yards 
... but instead sends a weak header wide!

 
30 min: Corner to Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> after 
Howard tips an Origi header over the bar. The American then thumps the 
set-piece to safety.

 
27 min: Mavuba was cautioned in the aftermath of that goal for clutching at 
the scrawniest straws, claiming that Osman handled the ball. He was wrong. On 
the day Osman put pen to paper to sign a new contract, the ref puts pen to 
paper to book impudent Mavuba.

 
Lovely move by Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, 
featuring smart hold-up play by Lukaku and a good run and cross by McGeady, 
then excellent chest-control and a fine finish from Osman! The lemur will live!

past Enyeama. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty  Osman celebrates by singing into 
the corner flag. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Corbis  Not quite as dramatic 
as a Tim Cahill. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty  
24 min: Lukaku holds the ball up long enough for Barry to come forward and 
take it off him and then make a sprint towards the byline. It’s put behind for 
a corner. Baines floats it towards the head of McGeady at the far post and 
that’s never going to result in a goal, now is it?

 
22 min: Suddenly Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> have bust 
out of their shell: Mendes forces an awkward save from Howard with a swirling 
shot from 18 yards. Naismith clears the corner as far as Gueye, whose shot 
clears the stand.

 
20 min: Another cross from the right by Balmont, who’s emerging as the most 
likely menace toEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>. Having 
said that, Mendes wins a corner down the other flank ...

 
18 min: A rare counter-attack from Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>, as Balmont race down the right 
and aims a cross at Frey, who can’t find the target with his header.

 
17 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are having 
almost all of the ball but Lille are playing the frustration game. And my 
lemur’s starting to fret...

 
15 min: Souare chops down McGeady on the left: that is intolerable! The winger 
has a crucial match for Ireland against Scotland next week and anyone that puts 
his participation in jeopardy should be banished forthwith!

 Lille’s Pape Souare takes out Aiden McGeady. Photograph: Magi Haroun/Rex  
12 min: Origi gets a touch! I’d almost forgotten he was on the pitch. Not his 
fault: his team are showing all the adventurous spirit of a troglodyte hermit. 
By the way, if you don’t want to know the latest score from the 
Feyenoord-Rijeka match, stay right here. I have no intention of mentioning it 
ever again.

 
10 min: As Lille settle a bit and being to snuff out the space that Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> had been exploiting adeptly, the 
home side try to diversify, bashing a few long balls forward to see what gives. 
Answer: nothing.

 
7 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are looking 
encouragingly sharp and seem to have enough penetrative qualities to get the 
better of a notoriously tough Lille defence. This won’t be 0-0, I’ll stake my 
(pet lemur’s) life on that.

 
4 min: This time Enyeama doesn’t look so nimble! he scarpered out of his box 
in a bid to beat Naismith to a flick-on from Lukaku but the forward got to it 
first. In fairness to the keeper though, the pressure as enough to prevent 
Naismith from getting a clean striker on it, so instead the Scot just prodded 
it past Enyeama but into the path of a retreating defender, who cleared the 
danger.

 Not so clever from Enyeama but Naismith fails to score. Photograph: Alex 
Livesey/Getty  
3 min: Enyeama has to show his skil again, this time dashing off his line to 
intercept an attempted through-ball for Lukaku. It’s a buoyant start byEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> and an even better one by the 
visiting goalkeeper.

 
1 min: Off we pop. Lukaku to Naismith from kick-off, and Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> begin knocking the ball about 
nicely. And within 32 seconds Enyeama has to make a superb one-handed save to 
paw away a shot from Lukaku, who had been put through by a canny pass from 
Naismith!

 An early chance for Everton’s Romelu Lukaku but his shot is brilliantly saved 
by Vincent Enyeama. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images  
The teams stride confidently out onto the pitch, Lille in Dortmund 
yellow-and-black tracksuits,Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> in their familiar Cookie Monster 
blue.

 
Roberto Martinez, talking to the man from ITV, has just said that he expects a 
terrific game provided that “the weather respects football”. Right on cue, 
there’s a cloud solemnly sporting a RESPECT armband.

 
In anticipation of Origi introducing himself to Merseyside tonight with a 
goal, here is a chant you might like to practice. Or not.

not exactly been in scorching form so far this season, drawing all three of 
their matches in the Europa League so far and finding goals difficult to come 
by both abroad and domestically, but they’re also hard to score against, not 
least because of the excellence of Vincent Enyeama, one of the best keepers 
around. And, erm, if that well-intentioned build-up makes it sound like we’re 
on course for another stalemate, then remember that Lille have Divock Origi, a 
player who doesn’t find the net as often as he should but tonight will be extra 
highly motivated by the prospect of scoring the first of many goals on 
Merseyside (ahead of hooking up with Liverpool next season, see). Besides, 
gritty 0-0s can lead to great things, as Everton’s class of ‘85 could tell you, 
havingonly just squeezed by a band of plucky Irish students 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZR-RDz19Vg> on their way to their own chunk 
of glory.
