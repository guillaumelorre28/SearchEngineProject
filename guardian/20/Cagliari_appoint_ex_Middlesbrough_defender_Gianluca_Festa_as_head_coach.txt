Cagliari <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cagliari> have appointed 
Gianluca Festa as their new head coach, the Serie A club announced on Wednesday.

Festa takes over from Zdenek Zeman, who resigned on Tuesday following the 
team’s poor run of form.

A statement from Cagliari read: “Gianluca Festa has been appointed as the 
coach of the first team until the end of the season.”

Zeman started the campaign in charge of Cagliari but was dismissed during the 
winter break

 and replaced by Gianfranco Zola.

Zola lasted just three months

 before he was fired in March, with the club then deciding to reappoint Zeman.

Festa, a former Middlesbrough and Cagliari player, inherits a team who are 
19th in the standings and nine points adrift of safety with seven games 
remaining.

Sunday’s 3-0 home defeat to Napoli was Cagliari’s seventh loss in their last 
eight league games.

The Cagliari-born Festa had been out of a job since being sacked by the third 
division side Lumezzane in March 2013.

Festa has no experience of being a first-team head coach in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> but was assistant to 
Giorgio Melis at Cagliari for a brief spell in 2010 before taking over the 
Sardinian club’s reserve team for the following two campaigns.

The 46-year-old’s first game in charge will be at Fiorentina on Sunday. 
Cagliari have not won since a 2-1 home success over Sassuolo on 24 January.
