Mark Rylance will return to London’s West End this winter in the comic play 
Nice Fish <http://www.nicefishtheplay.co.uk>. The play, which he co-wrote with 
the American prose poetLouis Jenkins 
<http://www.louisjenkins.com/Ann_Jenkins_webpages/Welcome.html>, draws on 
Rylance’s experiences growing up in the American midwest and follows two old 
friends on an ice-fishing expedition. It opens at the Harold Pinter theatre in 
November and the theatre is offering free tickets on the night, in a private 
box, to the first audience members who turn up either dressed as a fish or in 
fishing gear (a rod appears to be essential <http://www.nicefishtheplay.co.uk/>
). A total of four free tickets will be given away each night.

 with whom Rylance has collaborated frequently since they married in 1989. She 
wroteFarinelli and the King

, which starred Rylance as King Philippe V of Spain and ran in the West End 
last year after opening at Shakespeare’s Globe.


Previews for Nice Fish begin on 15 November. Jim Lichtscheidl co-stars with 
Rylance. They are joined by Kayli Carter, Bob Davis and Raye Birk.

The show was staged at St Ann’s Warehouse in New York earlier this year. In 
her Guardian review, Alexis Soloski described it as a cross between Samuel 
Beckett and A Prairie Home Companion as it “merges existential dread with 
genial folksiness”. Soloski concluded: “To see Rylance wrestle with a tent is a 
vision to melt even the iciest heart.”
