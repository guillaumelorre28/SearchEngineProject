How wise are you? Unlike its flashier cousin intelligence, the concept of 
wisdom has been virtually ignored by scientists, perhaps because nobody can 
quite put their finger on exactly what wisdom is. But recently this has started 
to change, to the point where you can now measure your wisdom by answering a 
few simple questions.

First, take a few moments to think over a recent negative incident involving 
another person. Now, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), 
to what extent do you feel that…

(a) In order to understand the incident, I need to have detailed information 
about the exact circumstances of the incident (“intellectual humility”).

(b) As I thought about the incident, I saw it more from the perspective of an 
onlooker than through my own eyes (“self-transendence”).

(c) I am now more able to understand the other person’s point of view, and 
even to sacrifice my own interests in order to avoid damaging my relationship 
with this person (“other perspectives and compromise”).

The higher your score, the wiser you are. A recent study found that wisdom 
varies not only from person to person, but from day to day within individuals. 
When people took a “wise” perspective on negative events, they were not only 
more forgiving to others, but better able to control their own emotions and 
less adversely affected by the event. So next time somebody winds you up, don’t 
rise to it – get wise to it.
