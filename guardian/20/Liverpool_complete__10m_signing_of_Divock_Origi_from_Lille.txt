delighted a club as big as Liverpool showed interest in me. I’m very excited,” 
the striker told the club website.

“I know it’s a club with a great history, great fans and a lot of great 
players. For me, Liverpool is one of the greatest clubs in the world and I’m 
very excited to be part of this great history.”

Origi played in all of Belgium’s five games at the World Cup in Brazil and 
scored the winning goal against Russia in the group stage.

The Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, added: “For me, he can be one of the 
most exciting talents in world football. I genuinely believe that. You see a 
lot of good players, but this kid – for 19 years of age – he burst on to the 
scene at the World Cup, but we’d tracked him before that, we’d seen him as a 
young player playing in the youth internationals. He has everything to be world 
class.”
