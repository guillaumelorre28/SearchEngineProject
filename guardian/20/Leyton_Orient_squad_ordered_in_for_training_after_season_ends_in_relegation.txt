The end of the season usually heralds a well-earned break for footballers, as 
the dust settles on the campaign just concluded – but not atLeyton Orient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient>, where players have been 
ordered in for extra training after being relegated from League One nine days 
ago.

The decision, reportedly made at the behest of the club’s owner Francesco 
Becchetti, does not appear to have gone down well in the squad, with the east 
London club’s striker Shaun Batt tweeting: “Seasons finished, there’s no more 
games, yet were in training mon/tues/wed/thurs till the 24th May. #Buzzing 
#NoFamilyHolidaysThisYearBoys”.

His team-mate, the French defender Mathieu Baudry, had last week tweeted with 
some sarcasm: “Really looking forward to double training sessions this week”, 
adding that he had not been home for a year and misses his family.

Orient appear to be in some turmoil following their relegation, which came 
only a year after they missed promotion to the Championship on penalties after 
losing the play-off final to Rotherham United and despite spending freely after 
last summer’s takeover by the Italian energy magnate Becchetti.

The team have had four managers this season and the latest incumbent, Fabio 
Liverani, was unable to prevent the club sliding into the bottom division for 
the first time in nine years.

Reports last week suggested that Becchetti was now considering selling up, but 
the club have been silent on the future of both manager and owner since their 
demotion was confirmed after last week’s 2-2 draw at Swindon Town.
