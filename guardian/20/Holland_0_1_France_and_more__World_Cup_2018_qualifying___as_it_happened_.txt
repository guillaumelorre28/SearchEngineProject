So, a pretty predictable night with one exception – Luxembourg battling back 
to draw with Belarus despite having only 10 men. It was their only shot, too. 
Neither side will be in Russia, though. France look big favourites to finish 
top of Group A, but Sweden could well pip Holland to the play-off place. In 
Group B, the three away teams won. That was true to form but Switzerland were 
not entirely convincing against Andorra. And in Group H Christian Benteke 
scored the fastest ever goal inWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifying history, 
setting up Belgium for a 6-0 win over Gibraltar after only seven seconds. 
Bosnia and Greece both won 2-0. Thanks for reading.

FULL-TIME! Holland 0-1 France

Pogba’s goal on the half hour is enough for Les Bleus. They deserved it 
despite not being at their best.Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> showed some decent flashes but 
they lack a cutting edge.

Goal tally check in from JR in Illinois: “With about ten minutes left we’re at 
24 goals, 33.33% of which have been scored byBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> and Switzerland. Too bad betting 
is illegal here. Or maybe not as I was ready to back Faroe Islands to qualify 
at the start of today. I don’t like to make predictions but I don’t think 
they’re going to make it.”

55 min: Gameiro has a good chance, played in by a class pass from Pogba. The 
striker takes an exquisite first touch to beat Bruma but Stekelenburg is out

“If we’re handing out plaudits to the French, how about one for Raphaël 
Varane?” emails Charles Antaki. “Not many central defenders manage that

41 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> have a big 
penalty shout turned down. Janssen’s shot is blocked by the midriff of 
Koscielny but as the France defender falls to the ground it comes back off his 
hand. It’s entirely accidental, play continues.

Paul Pogba boosts France as Liverpool’s Georginio Wijnaldum suffers injury
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/holland-france-world-cup-qualifier-match-report> 
So, a pretty predictable night with one exception – Luxembourg battling back 
to draw with Belarus despite having only 10 men. It was their only shot, too. 
Neither side will be in Russia, though. France look big favourites to finish 
top of Group A, but Sweden could well pip Holland to the play-off place. In 
Group B, the three away teams won. That was true to form but Switzerland were 
not entirely convincing against Andorra. And in Group H Christian Benteke 
scored the fastest ever goal inWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifying history, 
setting up Belgium for a 6-0 win over Gibraltar after only seven seconds. 
Bosnia and Greece both won 2-0. Thanks for reading.

Pogba’s goal on the half hour is enough for Les Bleus. They deserved it 
despite not being at their best.Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> showed some decent flashes but 
they lack a cutting edge.
 
90 min +2: France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> kill time by 
replacing Griezmann with Kanté.
 
Goal: Joao Cancelo has made it 6-0 to Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> in injury time.
 
90 min: There will be three minutes added on and Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are wrongly given a corner after 
the ball comes off Depay last. Blind shoots over when it’s sent in anyway.

88 min: Janssen heads down to Depay and the winger shoots first time but 
Lloris makes a solid stop.
 
Goal: Cristian Martínez has pulled one back for Andorra in the first minute of 
injury time. Can they equalise against Switzerland? Probably not.
 
Goal: More bad news for all you Faroes out there as Joao Moutinho scores 
Portugal’s fifth.
 
Goal tally check in from JR in Illinois: “With about ten minutes left we’re at 
24 goals, 33.33% of which have been scored byBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> and Switzerland. Too bad betting 
is illegal here. Or maybe not as I was ready to back Faroe Islands to qualify 
at the start of today. I don’t like to make predictions but I don’t think 
they’re going to make it.”
 
Goal: Luxembourg are level. Aurélien Joachim has made it 1-1 in Belarus.
 
Goal: Dzeko has a second, making things a bit more comfortable for Bosnia 
against Cyprus. It’s 2-0 with nine minutes to go.

Goal: Pavel Savitskiy has given Belarus the lead against Luxembourg.

78 min: Pogba and Strootman pick up a yellow card each after a little 
schemozzle before Gameiro trots off, to be replaced by Gignac.
 
Goal: Adam Szalai makes it 2-0 to Hungary in Latvia.
 
Goal: Gibraltar have now been hit for six. Eden Hazard bringing up the half 
dozen forBelgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>.
 
Goal: Andorra have conceded for a second time against Switzerland, Admir 
Mehmedi finding the net again.
 
74 min: Strootman goes down in the area under pressure from Matuidi having 
been fed by Janssen. Play, rightly, continues. It’s never a penalty.
 
72 min: Memphis Depay lines up a free kick on the left. Everybody expects him 
to cross but he shoots from a silly angle. Lloris claims and the home crowd 
groan. For all his raw talent, sometimes Depay’s decision making really lets 
him down.
 
Goal: With 20 minutes remaining, the deadlock has been broken in Zenica. 
Bosnia lead Cyprus thanks to the dependable Edin Dzeko.
 
70 min: Karsdorp piles forward again and sends a tasty cross in from the 
right. It almost reaches Dost.
 
67 min: Anthony Martial replaces Dimitri Payet. The West Ham player’s last act 
is to tee up Pogba from a corner, whose header from close range should really 
have put the game to bed.
 
Goal: Konstantinos Stafylidis scores in Tallinn, making it 2-0 to Greece.
 
Goal: Cristiano Ronaldo is back on the scoresheet, making it 4-0 to Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> against the Faroes.
 
62 min: Temporarily down to 10 men with Dost getting ready to come on, 
Karsdorp picks out Depay from the right and the Manchester United reserve 
shoots wide. Depay has been decent since coming on.
 
61 min: And now some bad news for Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> – Wijnaldum has gone to ground 
clutching his right hamstring. That will be the end of his evening and 
Liverpool may also be worried. Dost is getting ready to come on, meaning a 
change in formation.
 
60 min: France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> remain 
comfortable and it’s not particularly obvious what Holland’s Plan B is.
 
Goal: Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> are strolling 
against Bulgaria. Victor Lindelof has added their third.

against Bulgaria. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images  
55 min: Gameiro has a good chance, played in by a class pass from Pogba. The 
striker takes an exquisite first touch to beat Bruma but Stekelenburg is out 
quickly to block his shot. Griezmann fires the rebound over.
 
Goal: Benteke has his hat-trick. And Belgium have five. What will it end up? 
6-, 7-, 8-0? His first, I should add, came after only seven seconds – the 
quickest goal inWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifying history.
 
53 min: It’s become quite tedious in Amsterdam.
 
Goal: Dries Mertens has got in on the Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> act, making it 4-0 after 51 
minutes. Poor Gibraltar.
 
47 min: Janssen rolls Varane and shoot from a tight angle. He can only find 
the side netting.
 
46 min: France restart and immediately give possession away.
 Harry Palmer (@Harry_Palmer1) 
@alansmith90 <https://twitter.com/alansmith90> the Dutch side is a who's who 
of "who?"s isn'it, not even a thimbleful of stardust.

 <https://twitter.com/Harry_Palmer1/status/785566282183798785> 
Yes, this is fair, but some of the young players have plenty of potential and 
there is the makings of a good side there – in the future, but maybe not right 
now.
 
“Totally agree on Griezmann,” writes Johan Sjostedt. “His touch is just sexy, 
there is no other word for it. I could watch him receive passes all day, and I 
say that as a straight married man.”
 
The other half-times

Paul Pogba’s goal is the difference at the break.
 
45 min: There will be two minutes added on in Amsterdam.
 
Goal: Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden> have doubled their 
advantage over Bulgaria. Oscar Hiljemark has scored on the stroke of half time.
 
Red card: Luxembourg’s Dirk Carlson has been shown a second yellow in their 
game with Belarus. It remains scoreless there.

“If we’re handing out plaudits to the French, how about one for Raphaël 
Varane?” emails Charles Antaki. “Not many central defenders manage that 
elegant, languid look while also being understated and efficient. Having Pepe 
as his club team-mate helps bring out the contrast, of course.”

 
Goal: Christian Benteke has his second of the evening in the Algarve, making it
Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> 3-0 Gibraltar. Their 
share of the ball has at least dropped to 69%.
 
41 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> have a big 
penalty shout turned down. Janssen’s shot is blocked by the midriff of 
Koscielny but as the France defender falls to the ground it comes back off his 
hand. It’s entirely accidental, play continues.
