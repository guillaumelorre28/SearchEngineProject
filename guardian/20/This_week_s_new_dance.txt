Vincent Dance Company, On tour

This week, Charlotte Vincent celebrates the 21st anniversary of her dance 
company, with which she’s developed her intimate style of choreography as well 
as a distinctively female perspective on dance and politics. She will present a 
showcase including a restaging of the large ensemble work Underworld (London 
only); the funny and moving solo piece Look At Me Mummy; a screening of the 
film Glasshouse; and a space containing an online archive and live discussions.

English National Ballet: Modern Masters, London

ENB marks its first season as associate company of Sadler’s Wells with a bill 
of works by three very different 20th-century choreographers. John Neumeier’s 
Spring And Fall is set to Dvořák’s Serenade For Strings In E Major, the tension 
and lyricism of the music driving the relationships of the four lead dancers 
and the corps de ballet. William Forsythe’s In The Middle, Somewhat Elevated is 
a classic of the 1980s: a powerhouse of slicing, off-centred dance that drives 
its cast to fierce physical extremes. Completing the programme is a revival of 
Jiři Kylián’s Petite Mort, a tender and brutal meditation on sex and death.
