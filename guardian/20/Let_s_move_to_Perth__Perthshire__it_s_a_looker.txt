What’s going for it? It’s called the Fair City. Too right. It’s a looker. 
Standing on the bridge over the river, gawping at Tay Street and the city 
skyline, I doubt there’s a prettier city in the nation. So neat are its sober 
grey streets, so handsome its architecture, so prim and perfect its gardens, I 
can hardly imagine fiery oldJohn Knox in St John’s Kirk 
<http://www.st-johns-kirk.co.uk/explore/page/history> all those centuries ago, 
kickstarting the Scottish reformation. You don’t come to Perth for kicks these 
days; you come for the good life. Its economy rests on whisky and insurance. It 
is equipped with nice restaurants for date nights; parks for conker-hunting 
with the kids in the honied autumn light; soft, green, squelchy countryside for 
Sunday walks with the in-laws; property for sale straight out of Elle 
Decoration.

The case against Perhaps a little uptight in parts. Not the cheapest part of 
Scotland.

Fraser David “It’s the gateway to the Highlands. It has great food, 
entertainment galore, parks, forests, one of the best fishing rivers (the Tay), 
as well as walking, cycling and skiing opportunities.”

Kath Clark “We’re an hour from the beach, the mountains, and Edinburgh. Could 
do with better public transport, but it’s not bad.”
