. Here are a few highlights from this week.

Gareth Bale on the run

It took Gareth Bale 24 appearances over three seasons to win a game in a 
Tottenham shirt. He's making up for that now. After hishalf-pitch run

Norwich came atop-corner blaster 
<http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8440487031_12c8f39efe_o.gif> against West 
Brom and then he knocked ina free-kick 
<http://balls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/balefreekick.gif> and slotted 
another home <http://i.minus.com/ibfdRqcx1kLS3V.gif> against Newcastle. He also 
scored <http://i.minus.com/itrAe6dyDMLOe.gif> a brace against Lyon 
<http://i.minus.com/iJ1FPsI0fMQO0.gif> before his virtuoso performance at West 
Ham <http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8507232177_fa48c50988_o.gif>. No wonder 
his team-mate Scott Parker thinks Arsenal will be "deflated" ahead of the north 
London derby on Sunday.

Bayern v Bremen

It's not often one match provides so much entertainment, but Bayern Munich's 
6-1 thrashing of Werder Bremen <http://i.minus.com/iTRms90Qrdpin.gif> proved 
exceptional. Bayern produced enoughdinked passes 
<http://i.minus.com/ibjtrFtNaLFoJl.gif> to fill an end-of-season DVD.

Backheeling bloopers

What's worse than making your defender backheel the ball into your own net?

A signature slam dunk

The slam dunk makes a return after popular demand on last week's blog

.This 540Â° spinner <http://www.strangecosmos.com/images/content/181357.gif> is 
impressive, but not even Clark Kent could have stopped this guy
