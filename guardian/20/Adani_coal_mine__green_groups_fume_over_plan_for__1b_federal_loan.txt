The environmental movement is up in arms over a move towards federal funding 
of up to $1b for a railway that will serve Adani’s proposedQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> coal mine.

A $2.2b rail link to Adani’s huge Carmichael mine in the untapped Galilee 
basin has gained conditional approval for a commonwealth loan, days before its 
billionaire promoter, Gautam Adani, is due to meet state and federal political 
leaders.

The 310km North Galilee Basin Rail Project has met the economic, financial and 
employmentconditions for a 50% loan over five years under the Northern 
Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF), the Courier-Mail reported.

The railway, which will open up coalfields that reef scientists argue must 
remain untapped for the survival of theGreat Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef>, will require more 
detailed assessment before the NAIF panel agrees to fund it.

The preliminary approval of the loan, one of 80 unmet funding requests to the 
NAIF, was news to Queensland government ministers familiar with the project on 
Saturday, Guardian Australia confirmed.

A spokesman for Adani said he was unaware of any official advice received by 
the company on the rail loan request. A spokeswoman for the federal minister 
for northern Australia, Matthew Canavan, was contacted for comment.

Gautam Adani is due to join the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/annastacia-palaszczuk>, for an 
announcement in Townsville on Tuesday, as well as the prime minister, Malcolm 
Turnbull, in a separate meeting.

Last week, Australia sent a progress report to Unesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/great-barrier-reef-progress-report-we-have-to-do-better-on-water-quality-says-australia>
 on its conservation plan to save the reef, which has lost 22% of coral after 
its worst ever bleaching event this year.

Previous Unesco scrutiny of a possible “in danger” listing for the World 
Heritage site was prompted in part by Adani’s earlier plans to expand its Abbot 
Point coal port through dumping dredged seabed in reef waters.

Those plans were scrapped before the Queensland government banned capital 
dredge from being dumped at sea andinsisted Adani gain “financial close” on its 
$22b coal project before the Abbot Point expansion could begin

.

It also ruled out state funding of hundreds of millions of dollars for the 
Galilee rail project that was flagged under the former Newman Liberal National 
government.

But the state government recently declared the Carmichael coal project 
“critical infrastructure” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/09/carmichael-mine-to-be-given-essential-status-in-sign-of-palaszczuksupport?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other>
, heading off legal challenges after a raft of court cases brought by 
environmental groups and traditional owners.

The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said a federal government 
decision to fund the Galilee project was “condemning the reef to worse 
bleaching and jeopardising the 70,000 jobs it provides”.

Waters criticised the state government for “creating loopholes for Adani and 
fast-tracking this disastrous project”.

“[With] the federal Liberal-Nationals moving to pour in public money, it’s 
clearer than ever that big corporations call the shots, not ordinary 
Australians,” she said.

“Big coal has captured our politics, but we will fight them every step of the 
way.”

The Greenpeace Australia Pacific reef campaigner Shani Tager said public 
funding was “a trainwreck of an idea and it must be stopped”.

“While the world is moving away from coal, the federal government is looking 
at funding a project that some of the biggest banks in the world won’t go near 
and the Queensland Treasury has called unbankable,” she said.

“It’s absurd to prop up a project that banks won’t touch.

 “No more taxpayer money should be wasted on coal projects that threaten our 
Great Barrier Reef.”

The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said 
the loan would be “a serious misuse of public money”, claiming Adani had “a 
mining licence but no social licence”.

She said if Adani was unable to ultimately fund the mine, “Australia will be 
left with a railway to nowhere and an unpaid billion-dollar loan”.

“The NAIF board must release the assessment documents that show how it has 
determined the environmental and social benefits of this project,” she said.

Waters said there were “clean energy alternatives to this climate-wrecking 
disaster” that could boost Queensland regional communities hard hit by the 
crash of the mining boom.
