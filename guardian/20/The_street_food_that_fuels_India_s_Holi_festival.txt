Holi, the Hindu festival of colour, is a celebration of good triumphing over 
evil, marking the end of winter (23 March this year). My favourite Holi snack is
dahi bhalla. Originating from north India, these delicious spongy lentil 
dumplings are served in yoghurt and topped with tamarind and coriander 
chutneys. They’re sweet, savoury, soft, and creamy all in one bite and are the 
perfect way to refuel after an afternoon of paint throwing (a traditional part 
of the celebrations).

The best one I have tried is from a little stall called Natraj in the Old 
Delhi area of Chandni Chowk. Well known for its street food, this area is a 
bustling market in a labyrinth of tiny roads, playing host to hundreds of 
wholesalers selling silver, stones, jewellery, cloth, spices and more.

If you’re weary of eating on the street, pick up some ready-made in Haldirams 
<http://timescity.com/delhi/haldirams-listing>, a famous and hygienic (if a 
little soulless) Indian canteen-like eatery which has several outlets in New 
Delhi, or make them at home withmy online recipe

Other Holi favourites include the drink bhang lassi. Consumed in the Bihar 
region, it’s traditionally an intoxicating mix of cannabis, milk, spices, 
watermelon seeds, rose petals and poppy seeds – though nowadays it is mostly 
made without the drug.

In Gujarat, barfi is a popular coconut sweet for the celebrations that has a 
lovely texture and is lightly spiced with green cardamom and topped with 
pistachios or almonds. Andkesari malai peda is a sweet saffron pastry often 
eaten in Uttar Pradesh during the Holi period.
