The American Brown, a former Formula Three racer and former chief of marketing 
company JMI, is due to take up his new role next month. Dennis, the McLaren 
chairman and chief executive, last week failed in a high‑court bid to stop the

McLaren are continuing their search for a new chief executive to replace 
Dennis, 69, with Brown due to work alongside the chief operating officer, 
Jonathan Neale, to align the group’s commercial and strategic operations.

Brown had been linked with a role with Formula One’s new owners Liberty Media

 before accepting the job at McLaren, a team he previously worked with on 
sponsorship deals.

“I’m immensely proud to be joining McLaren Technology Group,” Brown said in a 
statement. “I have the utmost respect and admiration for what the business has 
achieved to date, and I look forward to contributing to the next important 
phase in its development.

“Having worked closely with McLaren for many years, I’ve been struck by the 
talent and ambition of the entire workforce, and I very much look forward to 
complementing the business’s many existing strengths, and building on them to 
drive future success in everything we do.”

Dennis, who owns 25% of McLaren, has in effect been forced out after a bitter 
boardroom dispute, ending his 36-year stay with the team.
