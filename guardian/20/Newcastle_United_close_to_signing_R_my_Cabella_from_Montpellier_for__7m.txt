Rémy Cabella is close to completing a move to Newcastle United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> from Montpellier for 
around £7m. Alan Pardew regards the 24-year-old playmaker as an ideal 
replacement for Yohan Cabaye who was sorely missed at St James’ Park after his 
£20m move to Paris Saint-Germain in January.

Newcastle’s manager tried and failed to sign Cabella during that transfer 
window but now it seems a player currently on Didier Deschamps’ standby list 
for the Brazil-bound France World Cup squad really could be heading towards 
Tyneside.

The recruitment of Cabella promises to end Pardew’s disastrous attempt to make 
his team much more direct in the wake of Cabaye’s departure. If Newcastle fans 
will welcome a reversion to more of a controlled passing game, they should also 
be relieved that Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, seems set to deliver on 
promises to invest significantly in reconstructing the squad this summer.

Newcastle struggled horribly to score goals from midfield after Cabaye’s exit 
but Cabella, who has an Italian father, managed an encouraging 14 in 41 Ligue 
One appearances forMontpellier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/montpellier-football-team> last season.

A fast, agile and creative attacking midfielder he is capable of operating on 
either wing or behind the main striker as well as in a slightly deeper 
playmaking role.

While Pardew is determined to restock his heavily Francophone dressing room 
with more British players this summer Cabella – a creator tracked for many 
months by Graham Carr, Newcastle’s influential chief scout – always ranked high 
on his shopping list.
