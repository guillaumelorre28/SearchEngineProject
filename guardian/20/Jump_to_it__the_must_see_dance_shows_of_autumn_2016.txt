After the powerfully imagined Dust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/03/enb-lest-we-forget-review>, with 
which Akram Khan began his artistic relationship with ENB, the choreographer 
deepens the association with a new and radically reinvented version of Giselle. 
Working in collaboration with composerVincenzo Lamagna 
<http://blog.ballet.org.uk/meet-composer-vincenzo-lamagna/> and dramaturg Ruth 
Little <http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/ruth-little>, Khan promises 
a very 21st-century interpretation of the familiar romantic tragedy of love, 
betrayal and redemption.

Watch the Dance Umbrella trailer <https://vimeo.com/168035546> 
 This year’s programme develops the jauntily experimental spirit introduced by 
artistic director Emma Gladstone three years ago. Among its most intriguing 
works are Unknown Pleasures, a programme in which the identities of its five 
contributing choreographers remain hidden from the audience; a new work by 
Jérôme Bel, created for three different London locations, including the Tanks 
at Tate Modern; and a performance byAditi Mangaldas 
<http://danceumbrella.co.uk/event.php?ref=inter-rupted#.V78llTYrJyo>, one of 
India’s new wave of Kathak choreographers.

The Royal Ballet pays tribute to McGregor <http://waynemcgregor.com/>’s first 
decade as the company’s resident choreographer, with a full evening devoted to 
his work. The revival of his 2012 piece Carbon Life might be controversial, but 
also on the programme is a new ballet set to a specially commissioned score by 
Steve Reich, plus a performance ofChroma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/11/royal-ballet-chroma-review>, 
with a fascinating cast that combines dancers from the Royal with those from 
the Alvin Ailey dance company, who acquired the work for their repertory three 
years ago.
