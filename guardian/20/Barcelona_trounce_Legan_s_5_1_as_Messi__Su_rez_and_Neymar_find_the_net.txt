The three combined repeatedly in the first half to set the defending champions 
on their way to a 5-1 win in Barça’s first visit toLeganés 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/legan-s>, a small club from southern 
Madrid playing its maiden campaign in the top tier.

Messi scored twice, and hit a post, giving the Argentinian five goals in two 
matches in five-days, and there was one apiece for Suárez,Neymar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/neymar> and Rafinha.

Last weekend, Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> left 
Messi and Suárez on the bench against Alavés, only to see the promoted side 
snatch a rare 2-1 win at Camp Nou. The lesson was clearly learned.

Luis Enrique went with Messi and Suárez from the start this time and the two 
linked up with Neymar to completely outclass their hosts.

Playing just their fourth match in the top flight in their 88-year history, 
Leganés opted to be daring. They had reason to trust their coach, Asier 
Garitano, who had led the club from the third division to the first in only 
three years. They started the season with a 1-0 win at Celta Vigo and a 0-0 
draw against Atlético Madrid.

Their high defensive line, however, left Barcelona’s big three with plenty of 
room to romp.

The easy win was a continuation of Barcelona’s dominant week after thrashing 
Celtic 7-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/barcelona-celtic-champions-league-match-report>
. Messi scored three times against the Scottish champions and helped set a club 
record for their biggest win in the Champions League.
