Are you a morning person? If you had no responsibilities to others and could 
plan your day entirely to suit yourself, would you be up:

a) at the crack of dawn
b) at noon after a long lie-in?

Although it might sound like a trivial matter, psychologists are increasingly 
discovering that the tendency towards being a morning person or a night owl 
tells us a lot about our personalities. You won’t be particularly surprised to 
hear that morning people are more likely to turn up for early appointments on 
time.

Impressively, though, one recent study of high-school students found that 
morning people outperformed evening people in maths, science and language 
exams, even when the two groups were first matched on an IQ test. Morning 
people also score higher on tests of proactivity – the tendency to take charge 
of a situation and use it to your advantage. Evening people are more likely to 
be risk-takers, especially when gambling and making financial investments. They 
are also more likely to be smokers and drinkers, possibly because they are 
suffering from a kind of “social jet lag” – a mismatch between the schedule 
imposed by the working week and their own internal timetables.

Beyond this, one recent study found that evening people are more likely to 
display aspects of narcissism, Machiavellianism and lack of self-control: all 
characteristics of people who show greater willingness to have affairs and 
one-night stands, and to commit petty theft. Creatures of the night indeed.
