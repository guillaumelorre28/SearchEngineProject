Thibaut Courtois got the nod ahead of Petr Cech to start Chelsea’s friendly 
againstWerder Bremen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen> but he 
found himself on the wrong end of a 3-0 scoreline in his first game for the 
club.

The Belgian goalkeeper, returning to Stamford Bridge after two years on loan 
in Spain with Atlético Madrid, was beaten from the spot by Eljero Elia before 
Ludovic Obraniak’s powerful header made it 2-0 at half-time.

Didier Drogba made his return to action for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> in the second half – his first 
appearance in a Blues’ shirt since the Champions League final in May 2012 – 
before Felix Kroos made it 3-0 with another penalty late on, with Cech between 
the posts.

Mikel John Obi and Eden Hazard made their first pre-season outings after the 
World Cup and Chelsea started with the same front six as in their 3-1 win at 
Vitesse Arnhem, with Cesc Fábregas again selected in the No10 role.

Kurt Zouma played alongside John Terry in defence and Terry was deemed to have 
handled the ball in the area from Elia’s cross in the 17th minute. Elia beat 
Courtois from the penalty spot.

Elia then picked out the unmarked Obraniak for the Pole to place a fine header 
into the far corner for Werder’s second.

Hazard’s introduction early in the second period triggered Chelsea’s best 
period of the game but a series of promising moves failed to bear fruit.

Terry was taken off after 75 mintues and Drogba took the captain’s armband 
before Kroos’s late penalty for a foul by Nathan Ake gave Bremen their third.
