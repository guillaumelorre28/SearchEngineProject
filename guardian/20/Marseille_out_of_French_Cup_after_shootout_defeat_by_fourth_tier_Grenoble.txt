Fourth-tier Grenoble came from behind three times before producing the first 
“giant killing” of the French Cup with a 5-4 win on penalties over the league 
leaders,Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille>, on Sunday.

Other top-flight favourites avoided falling at the first hurdle as Lyon, 
Monaco andBordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> all 
progressed to the round of 32.

The France forward André-Pierre Gignac scored a first-half brace for Marseille 
but the 10-time winners failed to hold on to their lead on a very poor surface 
at the Stade des Alpes and the teams were locked at 3-3 after extra time.

Mourad Nasrallah and Fares Hachi cancelled out Gignac’s goals before the Ghana 
winger André Ayew looked to have scored the winner in extra-time with a tap-in 
from close range. But Grenoble’s captain, Selim Bengriba, headed home a 
last-second equaliser to take Marcelo Bielsa’s side to a penalty shootout.

The former Grenoble <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grenoble> player 
Florian Thauvin then missed from the spot and Nasrallah sent Brice Samba the 
wrong way to knock out Marseille.

“There is no point analysing this match,” Bielsa said. “This is an 
unacceptable result and I’m mainly responsible for it.”

After a strong first half to the season that saw them climb to second in the 
league standings,Lyon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> picked up 
where they left off before the Christmas break and quickly built a 3-0 lead 
before resisting a late charge from Lens to win 3-2.

Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> were in control from the 
start against Nîmes of the second division and won 2-0 with goals from Bernardo 
Silva and Valère Germain while Bordeaux defeated Toulouse 2-1.

Guingamp began their title defence with a 3-0 victory at the fifth-tier side 
Dinan Léhon and Franck Tabanou scored the winner seven minutes into extra-time 
with a half-volley into the top corner as Saint-Étienne scrapped to a 1-0 win 
over Nancy.

The Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, the leading goalscorer in the league 
with 17 goals, netted a penalty after Nabil Fekir opened the scoring and 
Mouhamadou Dabo then extended the visitors’ lead to 3-0 after only 30 minutes. 
Alharbi El Jadeyaoui pulled one back 14 minutes from time and Adamo Coulibaly 
ensured a nervy finish after heading home in the 90th minute.

“We should not be allowed to frighten ourselves like that,” said Lacazette. 
“It’s always a pleasure to be decisive, it’s good for the group.”

Monaco were shown strong resistance by Nîmes, who were looking for redemption 
after making the headlines in a suspected match-fixing case that is continuing. 
Leonardo Jardim’s side went ahead in the 33rd minute and sealed their spot in 
the next round in added time.

“We continue our good string of results with a seventh consecutive win,” 
Jardim said. “It was our first match after the break, the pitch was not good 
and the players were not at 100% but we showed good attitude and solidarity.”

Paris Saint-Germain visit Montpellier on Monday.
