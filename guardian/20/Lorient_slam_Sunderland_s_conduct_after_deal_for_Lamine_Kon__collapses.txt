Lorient’s vice-president has criticised Sunderland’s conduct after the Premier 
League side pulled out of a deal for Ivorian defender Lamine Koné.

Sunderland had a bid accepted

 for the 27-year-old at the end of last month and Koné appeared set to become 
Sam Allardyce’s first signing of the transfer window last week.

However, with Bayern Munich’s Jan Kirchhoff having been pictured at the club’s 
training ground

on Wednesday as he arrived for a medical, Lorient vice-president Alex Hayes 
confirmed that the move for Koné is now off.

“It’s quite outrageous,” Hayes told French newspaper Le Télégramme 
<http://www.letelegramme.fr/football/fc-lorient/fc-lorient-kone-n-ira-pas-a-sunderland-07-01-2016-10911614.php>
. “We gave Sunderland our consent last Tuesday, Lamine left the next day to 
have contract talks, but the player warned us there were problems in 
negotiating his contract.

“Because of the holidays it dragged out until Monday. They tried to change the 
pre-agreed deal. Lamine called me to ask if he could return toLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> and I told him with great 
pleasure.”

Koné missed last weekend’s cup victory over Tours and will not be available 
for this weekend’s Ligue 1 fixture against Rennes after missing training.

“Our defensive pillar was lost for the cup game against Tours and for the 
Rennes derby, for nothing,” said Hayes, who added that the club are now 
exploring legal options.

“It’s quite outrageous on the part of Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> who, meanwhile, have 
negotiated with a Bayern player.”
