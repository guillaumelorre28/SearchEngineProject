Pablo Hernández struck a superb late winner as Celta Vigo came from behind to 
win atReal Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> and 
move third in La Liga. David Moyes’ side had twice gone ahead through Imanol 
Agirretxe only to see Iago Aspas draw the visitors level on both occasions 
before Hernández turned the game on its head with an 89th-minute winner.

The 3-2 win sees Celta leapfrog Villarreal and Atlético Madrid and to within 
three points of the joint leaders, Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Sociedad took the lead early on as Agirretxe headed home David Zurutuza’s 
cross, but Aspas equalised with a smart finish from inside the penalty area. 
Aspas came close to putting Celta ahead moments later but his shot was well 
saved by Geronimo Rulli in the Sociedad goal.

And it was the hosts who went in at the break ahead as Yuri Berchiche’s pass 
was converted by Agirretxe.

At that stage Moyes would have been hoping his side could hang on and move 
clear of 15th place after their slow start to the season.

But the former Everton and Manchester United manager remains under pressure as 
Celta hit back after the interval. It was Aspas who once again provided Celta’s 
route back into the game as he headed home Daniel Wass’s cross just before the 
hour.

Mikel González and Berchiche both missed good chances to rapidly restore 
Sociedad’s lead, and the game appeared to be heading for a draw.

That was until Hernández flashed home a perfect half-volley, cracking his 
left-footed effort past Rulli in the dying stages to keep Celta’s impressive 
start to the campaign moving forward.
