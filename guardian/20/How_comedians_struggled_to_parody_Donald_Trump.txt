This election season has inspired acres of commentary about the effectiveness 
of political satire against an unprecedented candidate like Donald Trump 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/arts/television/donald-trump-is-a-conundrum-for-political-comedy.html?_r=0>
. But after 18 excruciating months, the big day is finally upon us, and the 
state of political comedy seems as uncertain as the state of the country at 
large.

 has had a good election: her fire-and-brimstone comedy about the evils of 
Trump and his ilk has given her a powerful new voice sure to remain vital 
beyond the election. Given that her fury extends beyond Trump to the inequality 
and bigotry that has infected the body politic, she is sure to have plenty to 
rage at in the coming years – no matter who wins.

Another of the most successful breakout comedians of this election, Anthony 
Atamanuik <http://trumpvsbernie.com/about/>, seems to have had enough. 
Atamanuik spent much of the year touring his Donald Trump impression in the 
brilliant Trump v Bernie debates with James Adomian. After Trump clinched the 
nomination, Atamanuik switched to one-man “Trump Dump

” rallies, where he gave long, Trumpish speeches in the Republican candidate’s 
signature rambling style.

At a show on Thursday night at the New York comedy festival, however, both he 
and his audience seemed to have had their fill of the election. For his final 
Trump rally, Atamanuik ditched the parody and launched his own spiel, a 
personal, leftist take on the history of oppression in America and the laziness 
of modern-day slacktivism. When he pulled the Trump wig off at the end of the 
show, the message was clear – we need to leave this guy in the dust.

So how will comedians – late-night hosts and standups alike, many of whom 
barely came to grips with the unparalleled absurdity of the Trump campaign – 
handle a world after today?

If Clinton wins, it may be tempting for some to shift back to normal as soon 
as possible, with the “give it to both sides” mentality that has been the 
traditional approach to American satire. But has the way some comedians and 
writers have been so unabashedly partisan in their attacks on Trump broken the 
seal of balance, pushing comedy into advocacy? In a recent Late Night with Seth 
Meyers piece for instance, the host was unequivocal in his feelings about 
election day, comparing Clinton’s problem – someone who was under federal 
investigation for using a private email server – versus a seemingly 
never-ending list of Trump’s sins.

Clinton has had her fair share of mockery over the decades, but her 
shortcomings are so much less baroque than her opponent’s that she’s had an 
easy ride. Will comedians move back into mocking her ruthlessness, Bill’s 
affairs, her paranoia – as if they hadn’t been glossing over it for the past 
six months? Or will they stay kind, just grateful that she’s the one who made 
it to the Oval Office?

Predicting how the satirical class would react to a Trump win is even harder. 
Early in the race, Trump seemed like a goldmine for comedians, but his sheer 
grotesquery often put him beyond satire. Trump may have taken offense at Alec 
Baldwin’s impression of him on Saturday Night Live, but such spot-on mimicry 
hasn’t had the devastating effect that great impressions – like Tina Fey’s 
Sarah Palin – have had in the past.

Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and 
unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!

One consistent point of mockery has been Trump’s looks – his outrageous hair 
and unnatural skin tone have been central to mocking him for years. Bee has 
perhaps been better at it than anyone, as this compilation of her Trump 
thesaurus proves:

But will it still be funny to refer to President Trump as a “melting hunk of 
uninformed apricot Jell-O” in the third year of his term? Even by the low bar 
of typical political discourse, this election has been abysmally short on 
policy discussions, particularly where Trump is involved. Are comedians ready 
to hit him on executive decisions? How will they frame their approach to his 
presidency? What comedic narrative would define a Trump administration?

Like most people, comedians were not fully prepared for a Trump candidacy. 
After years of politicians like George Bush, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, the 
comedy institution didn’t know how to handle someone so apparently immune to 
mockery. So if future leaders attempt to copy Trump’s satire-proof, demagogue 
style, let’s hope that future comics will have figured out a way to take it 
down.
