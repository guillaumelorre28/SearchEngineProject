Lionel Messi notched his 250th La Liga goal to move one off the all-time 
league scoring record as leadersBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> won 3-0 against Eibar on 
Saturday ahead of next weekend’s clásico with Real Madrid.

Barca needed Xavi to come to the rescue on the hour to finally break the 
resistance of a resoluteEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> side 
who are enjoying their first season in the top flight.

Neymar quickly added to the lead and then combined with Messi for the 
Argentine,who this week celebrated 10 years since his Barça debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/15/lionel-messi-barcelona-decade>
, to reach a quarter-century of La Liga goals.

Messi has a chance against Real to beat Telmo Zarra’s record of 251 goals for 
Athletic Bilbao in the 1940s and ‘50s.

“We found it difficult to get the opener but after that it was a lot easier,” 
Xavi told reporters. “They were more tired by then but at the same time we were 
strong defensively and that should be recognised.”

New coach Luis Enrique has strengthened the defence and Barça are still to 
concede a goal after eight league games.

“Sometimes you score in the first minute but this is football and it just 
depends. I think we played well,” Xavi added.

“It is not just a coincidence that we haven’t let in a goal but it is the work 
from all the team. The coach has some set rules and everyone does their own 
work.”
