Torquay's five-year stay in the Football League will end with relegation 
despite a 3-1 victory atMansfield, who played the second half with 10 men after 
Matt Rhead was sent off.

Bristol Rovers' 2-1 win at Wycombe and Northampton's 3-0 win at Dagenham and 
Redbridge means it is all over for Torquay, who recorded a third successive 
away win.

The visitors took the lead after 13 minutes when Mansfield's John Dempster put 
through his own goal and Ashley Yeoman made it two after 32 minutes with a 
close-range effort after his header from a corner had been saved. Rhead was 
sent off for a poor challenge on Dale Tonge before the break but shortly after 
the restartMansfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mansfield> pulled 
one back thanks to a James Jennings header.

Shaquile Coulthirst headed home substitute Jordan Chappell's centre after 78 
minutes to seal the win, but the victory came too late for Torquay.

Rochdale made sure of automatic promotion with a 2-0 win at Cheltenham. Peter 
Vincenti put them ahead on 11 minutes with a shot from 10 yards and five 
minutes later Ian Henderson slotted home from close range.

Fleetwood's chances of automatic promotion were dealt a blow when they could 
only draw 1-1 at home toSouthend, who themselves secured a place in the 
play-offs. With rivals Chesterfield visiting Burton on Sunday, Fleetwood took 
the lead through Steven Schumacher's 37th-minute free-kick but just three 
minutes later Barry Corr thumped the ball home to put the Shrimpers level. 
Chesterfield, who have a superior goal difference, are likely to need one point 
from their last two games to seal promotion.
