This brilliant festival of high-quality work made by disabled artists returns. 
Look out for Liz Carr’s Assisted Suicide: the Musical, which considers the 
legalisation of suicide as a humane choice, and Cherophobia, in which Noemi 
Lakmaier will spend 48 hours attempting to lift her immobilised body off the 
ground using 20,000 helium balloons. There is plenty more, including a solo

A Streetcar Named Desire

Maxine Peake, following striking performances in Hamlet

andThe Skriker

, now plays Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Williams classic. It will be 
fascinating to see whether Peake plays Blanche as an embodiment of the poetic 
spirit rather than a cracked southern belle. With Sarah Frankcom directing and 
Ben Batt as Stanley Kowalski, the omens look good.

Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, having bonded in a revival of Waiting for 
Godot

, star in Sean Mathias’s production of Harold Pinter’s austere masterpiece 
about the meeting of an aged literary lion and a pushy minor poet. Owen Teale 
and Damien Molony play the manservants in a work that, with its echoes of Eliot 
and Beckett, ushers one into an unforgettable twilight zone.

Dedication


Nick Dear’s new play explores the relationship between Shakespeare and the 
third Earl of Southampton, who was his cross-dressing patron and to whom The 
Rape of Lucrece is dedicated. He might also have been the playwright’s lover. 
Set against a background of an Elizabethan England full of suspicion and plots, 
this speculative romantic drama puts Shakespeare in the dock to try to uncover 
the truth of the relationship, and uses poetry as evidence.

Father Comes Home from the Wars (Parts 1, 2 & 3)

These three short plays by Suzan Lori-Parks are the start of an ambitious 
attempt to retell the story of the American civil war. The focus is on a slave 
promised his freedom by his master if he joins the Confederacy in its fight 
against the Union. Steve Toussaint and Jimmy Akingbola head the cast, and Jo 
Bonney, who directed the hugely acclaimed 2014 American production, is in

Every parent wants the best for their baby. Kurt and Martha are prepared to 
work hard to ensure theirs has everything he needs, even if that means Kurt

Travesties

Patrick Marber directs the first London revival in over 20 years of Tom 
Stoppard’s exuberant 1974 comedy. Tom Hollander plays Henry Carr, a minor 
consular official who, in first world war Zurich, encounters James Joyce, Lenin 
and the dadaist Tristan Tzara. Freddie Fox and Amy Morgan play supporting 
roles, and the play offers a wild, and even Wildean, excursion into art, 
politics and the strange coincidences of history.

 Unanswered questions … The Gaul. 
The Gaul

Some time on the night of 8 February 1974, fishing trawler FV Gaul disappeared 
without trace off the coast of Norway. For the families of the 36 men on board, 
waiting for news back in Hull was a time of great distress. Theories began to 
abound, including the possibility that the boat had fallen victim to cold war 
hostilities. Even when the trawler was discovered on the seabed, and despite a 
subsequent inquiry, many still feel there arequestions that remain unanswered. 
As Hull hurtles towards the 2017 Year of Culture, Mark Babych directs Janet 
Plater’s play.

The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to 
the Scriptures

The title is a bit of a mouthful but anything from the pen of Tony Kushner, 
who wrote Angels in America (soon to be revived by the National 
<http://national-theatre.tumblr.com/post/138601022681/coming-up-at-the-nt-2016-and-beyond>
), is to be savoured. This play takes the form of a family reunion in which 
everyone struggles to find meaning in a landscape they no longer recognise.

debut, was said to fizz with ideas.

Lazarus


There is an inevitable pathos about seeing this musical by David Bowie and 
Enda Walsh so soon after Bowie’s death. Inspired by the sci-fi novel and movie,
The Man Who Fell to Earth, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/17/the-man-who-fell-to-earth-david-bowie-trailer-video>
 it deals with a hero, Thomas Newton, unable to die and haunted by a past love. 
Likely to be the autumn’s hottest ticket, the score includes new songs 
specially composed by Bowie and Ivo van Hove’s production features the stars of 
the original New York cast, Michael C Hall, Michael Esper and Sophia Anne 
Caruso.

In a year filled with Lears, including Antony Sher and Timothy West, no one 
should be surprised to see Glenda Jackson having a crack at the title. She not 
only has impeccable Shakespearean credentials, but also direct experience of

 Groundbreaking tech … The Tempest. 
The Tempest

Simon Russell Beale returns to the Stratford stage for the first time in 20 
years to play Prospero in Shakespeare’s magical fable about the supremacy of 
forgiveness over vengeance. Mark Quartley is Ariel, once played by Russell 
Beale, in a production by Gregory Doran that promises a groundbreaking link 
between the RSC and Intel in its use of advanced technology. Could that mean a 
digitised TV Ariel?

Trouble in Mind

Alice Childress won an Obie (Off-Broadway award) in 1956 for this story of a 
black actress rehearsing a play with a white director who increasingly finds it 
impossible for the show to go on. The wonderful Tanya Moodie and Joseph Marcell 
star in a scathing satire directed by Laurence Boswell, who has turned the tiny 
Ustinov Studio into a powerhouse.
• 10 November to 17 December, Ustinov

Bath. Box office: 01225 448844.
