The Galicians were facing a near-impossible task to recover from a 4-0 deficit 
after the first leg but gained some hope before half-time when Iago Aspas 
converted at the far post after Fabian Orellana’s break down the left on 35 
minutes.

As the rain poured down, the Balaidos faithful were on their feet again when 
Aspas, the former Liverpool forward, made it 2-0 on 55 minutes, nodding in a 
rebound from close range.

The home fans, though, were silenced three minutes later when the Argentina 
midfielder Ever Banega re-established Seville’s control of the tie with a neat 
finish from the edge of the penalty area.

The drama continued when Celta were awarded a penalty almost immediately 
following the restart after John Guidetti was tripped by the goalkeeper Sergio 
Rico. However, the Sweden striker saw his spot-kick come back off the base of 
the post and bounce to safety.

Celta continued to pour forward and forced Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> into some last-ditch defending, 
but were caught on the break with three minutes left when the substitute Yevhen 
Konoplyanka stabbed in from close range after Vitolo had cut into the right 
side of the penalty area.
