“I am sorry to be leaving the club in this difficult situation but I think 
everyone will understand that my health takes priority,” Stevens, who has had 
more than a half dozen coaching stops in the Bundesliga and also won the Uefa 
Cup with Schalke in 1997, said.

“I took my decision following the advice of doctors. You have to be 100% fit 
and I am not. It was a big risk for me to continue. I don’t have a lot of years 
left, but I want to make the most of the ones I have left,” he said.

Stevens, who saved Stuttgart from relegation in the past two seasons after 
twice taking over midway through the campaigns, replaced Markus Gisdol at 
Hoffenheim in October.

But after 10 matches in charge Hoffenheim have managed only one victory and 
are languishing in 17th place on 14 points, level with the bottom side Hannover.

The assistant coaches Alfred Schreuder and Armin Reutershahn have taken charge 
for now, with the youth team coach Julian Nagelsmann set to take the reins next 
season.

Hoffenheim, backed by the billionaire and SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp, shot up 
through the minor leagues before winning promotion to the top division in 2008.

Stevens, who has also coached Hertha Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne among others, 
had signed a deal with Hoffenheim until the end of the season.
