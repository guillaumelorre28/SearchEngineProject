The Belgian winger Carrasco put Diego Simeone’s side in front after just seven 
minutes before Gameiro made it 2-0 on 24 minutes.

Sandro scored a stunning free-kick for Málaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/malaga> to halve the deficit before 
Gameiro made it 3-1 before the break after an excellent touch by Antoine 
Griezmann.

Málaga responded strongly in the second half and Ignacio Camacho pulled 
another goal back for the visitors just before Atletico’s Stefan Savic was 
dismissed for a second bookable offence.

But Carrasco sealed the points for Atlético four minutes from time following a 
brilliant solo run and finish. Málaga’s fate was then sealed when Gonzalo 
Castro was sent off after receiving a second yellow card.
