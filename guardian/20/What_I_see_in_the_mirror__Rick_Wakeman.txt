There must be something wrong with the mirrors in our house, because every 
single one I gaze into makes me appear somewhat overweight. I've queried this 
with my wife, who said, "That's because you are fat." My solution was to raise 
all the mirrors by two and a half feet, so only my head and shoulders are 
reflected now. This is not ideal for my wife who is 5ft 2in (I am 6ft 3in), but 
she is coping by standing on a stool to brush her hair.

So what do I see now? Well, I was 65 in May, and when I have just shaved I see 
my father. I realise that I now have the same facial idiosyncrasies he had: 
little twitches here and there, mouth and nose movements, even the way he would 
tilt his head.

Once through my father's mask, I see a different me almost every day. My eyes 
are green, and in one of them there is a splash of brown – apparently it is not 
a colour, but a freckle! Sometimes I notice that one eyelid droops more than 
the other. I see my greyish beard, which is bizarre really, because the hair on 
my head hasn't gone grey – I still have a good head of blond, shoulder-length 
hair. I have rather large pores on my nose (which may be down to the fact that 
I have a rather large nose). And on a really bad day I can count numerous 
chins, which only goes to prove that, sadly, the mirror never lies, and both 
the mirror and my wife must be right: I am fat.
