90 mins + 11: McCormack delivers the cross, but this time Dean somehow finds a

90 mins + 7: Agbonlahor has a minor case of the Gazzas in the 1991 FA Cup

90 mins + 1: Wiggins drives inside from the left and finds enough room for a 
shot, which he takes and it flicks off a defender, completely wrong-footing 
Gollini but it scuttles just, just wide of the post. Of more concern for 
Wiggins is that he seemed to collide with a defender just after the shot, he’s 
down on the turf and looks in serious bother.

90 mins: Maghoma is rapidly closed down by Agbonlahor but a little too 
aggressively, and the Villa man gives away a free-kick. Five minutes of added 
time.

87 mins: Big guns for Villa now: Rudy Gestede is on, and it’s in place of 
Westwood. That’s four forwards on the pitch for Bruce’s boys now.

McCormack on the edge of his own box, the striker tackles him but fortunately 
for the Brum man, it goes out for a goal-kick.

85 mins: Corner for Birmingham from the left, which Cotterill swings over, 
Shotton rises and heads back into the middle from the back post, but Morrison 
can only stab over the bar from inside the six-yard box. Big chance that.

up doing neither.

80 mins: Now then: set your narrative-o-meters to heavy. A sub for Villa, as 
Gabriel Agbonlahor comes on for Ayew. This is his first involvement since 
March, and until Bruce arrived it very much looked like he would never play for 
Villa again. But here he is.

to Kodjia whose shot is blocked. Birmingham haven’t quite harnessed the

76 mins: What a chance! Davis skims a cross into the box for Jutkiewicz, who 
nods it down towards Spector, he lets it go to Donaldson in space around 12 
yards from goal, but he drags his shot wide. Half of the crowd were up in 
anticipation of the goal.

75 mins: Gardner is allowed to run through the middle of the Birmingham 
midfield, he slides a lovely pass through to Kodjia in the Thierry Henry 
position, but he’s just offside.

74 mins: The home fans are in better voice now, with that chant encouraging 
all and sundry to “void their bowels on the Villa”. Or words to that effect.

71 mins: Cotterill is straight into the action, making a fine run down the 
right and to the byline. His cross is half-cleared, makes its way to Davis on 
the edge of the box and sidesteps around one challenge, but creates enough 
space to fire a low shot into the bottom corner, perhaps via a small 
deflection. He repeats Gardner’s celebration, running around with a crazed look 
in his eyes, but adds the variation of removing his shirt, which of course 
earns him a booking.

65 mins: The linesman gives one of the most ludicrously wrong decisions you’ll 
see, as the ball bounces off Hutton’s shins about two feet away from the 
official, but he gives the throw to Villa. Fortunately for the sake of truth, 
justice and the footballing way, the throw comes to nothing.

64 mins: Change for Birmingham, which suggests, shall we say, a change in 
tactics: big Lukas Jutkiewicz is on for Che Adams.

into Ayew - unintentional on the part of both men - and took a whack to the

60 mins: Birmingham much the better side in the second half, but they’re still 
having problems creating too many clear chances. Another attack fizzles as 
Kieftenbeld swipes at the ball with his left, and misses.

57 mins: Some interesting decisions from ref Dean. Jedinak and Gleeson go for 
a ball in the air, both collide at about the same point, neither goes to 
ground, neither claim much: free-kick to Villa.

55 mins: Ayew streaks down the left and clips a nice cross into the middle, 
but McCormack seems to mistime his jump and the ball eludes him. Birmingham try 
to counter, but Westwood cynically takes down Maghoma as he sprints down the 
left, and gets a fully deserved booking.

53 mins: Huge chance for Birmingham, as Maghoma takes advantage of Hutton 
dithering on the ball and sets himself through on goal, but the Villa 
right-back does well to get back and at least put the winger off. His shot is 
scuffed and straight at Gollini, and while the ball gets back to Maghoma, he 
loses his footing, eventually shovelling the ball somewhere near the goal, but 
it’s scrambled clear.

52 mins: Free-kick to Brum in the centre circle, which Shotton clips into the 
box for Morrison. He wins the header back to Kieftenbeld, but his volley goes 
over.

50 mins: Kodjia is down again, sent to the turf via a knee in the small of his 
back from Shotton. He’s not happy with either the pain or not even getting a 
free-kick for his troubles, but after some treatment he should be fine.

49 mins: Adams gets down the right, crosses and Donaldson does well to hold 
the ball up in the box then lay it off to Spector, but his shot is sliced over. 
Birmingham then build another attack as Maghoma cuts in from the left, but his 
low effort doesn’t have much power and Gollini saves easily.

47 mins: Spector seems to knock Ayew to the ground and then straddle his back, 
making returning to his feet tricky, at best, but nothing given from Renegade 
Dean.

atmosphere sounds significantly less lively among the home fans.

Without wishing to encourage reading anything but your super soaraway 
Guardian, you might be interested inthese pieces about Steve Bruce’s 
extra-curricular hobby: novel-writing 
<http://thesetpieces.com/features/defender-steve-bruce-review/>. He did three 
of them, remarkably.

And if you’d like to hear an extract from one of them read out loud, here’s

Good half for Villa. It’s not been 45 minutes of flowing, dominant football 
from Brucie’s boys, but they’ve been largely solid and have prevented 
Birmingham from creating much of note, beyond that Donaldson header that damn 
near went over the line. Great header for the goal. Great header.

45 mins + 4: A bit of space opens up in the middle for Birmingham, but again

might be a little misdirected.

44 mins: McCormack tries to shepherd the ball out for a goal kick under 
pressure from Che Adams, but it rebounds off his shin and goes out for a 
corn...oh, no, hello Mike Dean - a goal-kick is given. Forever the maverick, is 
Deano.

42 mins: Birmingham having trouble getting beyond about 40 yards from the 
Villa goal at the moment. They’re reduced to speculative long passes from deep, 
one of which Donaldson can’t control, another is too long for Spector down the 
right and possession is donated right back to Villa.

40 mins: Spector has his legs whipped away by Gardner, and here’s a chance for 
Birmingham to threaten from the free-kick on the right. Maghoma sticks it into 
the box and finds Shotton, but it goes over.

38 mins: Kodjia down on the turf after an aerial challenge with Shotton. The 
Brum centre-half was pretty robust but it looked like more his heavy landing on 
his left leg that caused the problem.

37 mins: Amavi gets the ball on the left, starts to lose control of it but 
then takes advantage of a slight hint of breath on his neck from Davis, and 
goes down. It works, as Dean gives the free-kick.

35 mins: Not vintage football in the last few minutes. Morrison gives the ball 
straight to Westwood, who clips it over the top of the defence looking for the 
run of Gardner, but Shotton scoots over and clears.

32 mins: It’d be a stretch to say Villa have been the better team, but man 
alive what a header that was. Sky summariser David Prutton describes Donaldson 
as “no slug” in the air. You sort of know what he’s getting at.

And that’s yer lot. A decent game without being a proper classic. Both sides 
will probably be disappointed not to have won, which probably means a draw was 
a fair result. Probably. Birmingham go up to seventh, and Villa are now up one 
to 15th.

Cheers for reading, and now have a look at Everton v West Ham in the Prem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/30/everton-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live>
. Daniel Harris is taking you through that one.
 
Peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
90 mins + 11: McCormack delivers the cross, but this time Dean somehow finds a 
foul in the Birmingham box by a Villa player. What a maverick this man is.
 
90 mins + 10: But wait: a free-kick for Villa, about 40 yards out on the 
right...
 
90 mins + 9: A throw for Birmingham. It’s eventually launched into the box by 
Morrison, towards Jutkiewicz, but it’s too long and that might be that.
 
90 mins + 7: Agbonlahor has a minor case of the Gazzas in the 1991 FA Cup 
final. He chases Maghoma down frantically then hacks him to the ground, about 
two yards in front of the linesman, then bafflingly claims innocence.
 
90 mins + 6: After about four minutes break, we’re back, and a minor goalmouth 
scramble ends as referee Dean finds a free-kick from somewhere to give to Villa.
 
90 mins + 4: Wiggins is being loaded very carefully onto a stretcher. Looks 
bad.
 
90 mins + 2: Oxygen mask for Wiggins. Ach, poor lad. Looks like the old 
warhorse Paul Robinson will come on his his place.
 
90 mins + 1: Wiggins drives inside from the left and finds enough room for a 
shot, which he takes and it flicks off a defender, completely wrong-footing 
Gollini but it scuttles just, just wide of the post. Of more concern for 
Wiggins is that he seemed to collide with a defender just after the shot, he’s 
down on the turf and looks in serious bother.
 
90 mins: Maghoma is rapidly closed down by Agbonlahor but a little too 
aggressively, and the Villa man gives away a free-kick. Five minutes of added 
time.
 
89 mins: Villa try to tee up a crossing chance, but it comes from Amavi and he 
hoys it far too long from the left.
 
87 mins: Big guns for Villa now: Rudy Gestede is on, and it’s in place of 
Westwood. That’s four forwards on the pitch for Bruce’s boys now.
 
86 mins: Shotton gets away with one as he tries to take the ball around 
McCormack on the edge of his own box, the striker tackles him but fortunately 
for the Brum man, it goes out for a goal-kick.
 
85 mins: Corner for Birmingham from the left, which Cotterill swings over, 
Shotton rises and heads back into the middle from the back post, but Morrison 
can only stab over the bar from inside the six-yard box. Big chance that.
 
84 mins: Wiggins booms a cross over from the left, it drops to Cotterill but 
he hesitates while deciding whether to shoot first-time or control it, and ends 
up doing neither.
 
81 mins: Agbonlahor gets involved straight away, laying the ball back to 
McCormack, but his shot is deflected wide. From the corner, Kodjia wins the 
header but diverts it wide.
 
80 mins: Now then: set your narrative-o-meters to heavy. A sub for Villa, as 
Gabriel Agbonlahor comes on for Ayew. This is his first involvement since 
March, and until Bruce arrived it very much looked like he would never play for 
Villa again. But here he is.
 
79 mins: Villa corner from the left. Ayew can’t beat the first man, it breaks 
to Kodjia whose shot is blocked. Birmingham haven’t quite harnessed the 
momentum from their goal a few minutes ago.
 
76 mins: What a chance! Davis skims a cross into the box for Jutkiewicz, who 
nods it down towards Spector, he lets it go to Donaldson in space around 12 
yards from goal, but he drags his shot wide. Half of the crowd were up in 
anticipation of the goal.
 
75 mins: Gardner is allowed to run through the middle of the Birmingham 
midfield, he slides a lovely pass through to Kodjia in the Thierry Henry 
position, but he’s just offside.
 
74 mins: The home fans are in better voice now, with that chant encouraging 
all and sundry to “void their bowels on the Villa”. Or words to that effect.
 
71 mins: Cotterill is straight into the action, making a fine run down the 
right and to the byline. His cross is half-cleared, makes its way to Davis on 
the edge of the box and sidesteps around one challenge, but creates enough 
space to fire a low shot into the bottom corner, perhaps via a small 
deflection. He repeats Gardner’s celebration, running around with a crazed look 
in his eyes, but adds the variation of removing his shirt, which of course 
earns him a booking.
 
Well, not quite so happy now.

70 mins: A quiet spell. Bruce will presumably be delighted with how this is 
going. Here comes another change for Birmingham, as David Cotterill replaces 
Kieftenbeld.
 
68 mins: The Birmingham crowd have their most uplifting moment of the half so 
far, as McCormack tumbles over the advertising boards. Thin gruel otherwise for 
Blues.
 
65 mins: The linesman gives one of the most ludicrously wrong decisions you’ll 
see, as the ball bounces off Hutton’s shins about two feet away from the 
official, but he gives the throw to Villa. Fortunately for the sake of truth, 
justice and the footballing way, the throw comes to nothing.
 
64 mins: Change for Birmingham, which suggests, shall we say, a change in 
tactics: big Lukas Jutkiewicz is on for Che Adams.
 
62 mins: Gleeson looks in some pain after winning a challenge them sliding 
into Ayew - unintentional on the part of both men - and took a whack to the 
knee.
 
60 mins: Birmingham much the better side in the second half, but they’re still 
having problems creating too many clear chances. Another attack fizzles as 
Kieftenbeld swipes at the ball with his left, and misses.
 
57 mins: Some interesting decisions from ref Dean. Jedinak and Gleeson go for 
a ball in the air, both collide at about the same point, neither goes to 
ground, neither claim much: free-kick to Villa.
 
55 mins: Ayew streaks down the left and clips a nice cross into the middle, 
but McCormack seems to mistime his jump and the ball eludes him. Birmingham try 
to counter, but Westwood cynically takes down Maghoma as he sprints down the 
left, and gets a fully deserved booking.
 
53 mins: Huge chance for Birmingham, as Maghoma takes advantage of Hutton 
dithering on the ball and sets himself through on goal, but the Villa 
right-back does well to get back and at least put the winger off. His shot is 
scuffed and straight at Gollini, and while the ball gets back to Maghoma, he 
loses his footing, eventually shovelling the ball somewhere near the goal, but 
it’s scrambled clear.

52 mins: Free-kick to Brum in the centre circle, which Shotton clips into the 
box for Morrison. He wins the header back to Kieftenbeld, but his volley goes 
over.
 
50 mins: Kodjia is down again, sent to the turf via a knee in the small of his 
back from Shotton. He’s not happy with either the pain or not even getting a 
free-kick for his troubles, but after some treatment he should be fine.
 
49 mins: Adams gets down the right, crosses and Donaldson does well to hold 
the ball up in the box then lay it off to Spector, but his shot is sliced over. 
Birmingham then build another attack as Maghoma cuts in from the left, but his 
low effort doesn’t have much power and Gollini saves easily.

47 mins: Spector seems to knock Ayew to the ground and then straddle his back, 
making returning to his feet tricky, at best, but nothing given from Renegade 
Dean.
 
46 mins: And we’re away for the second half. More boos for Brucie, but the 
atmosphere sounds significantly less lively among the home fans.
 
Without wishing to encourage reading anything but your super soaraway 
Guardian, you might be interested inthese pieces about Steve Bruce’s 
extra-curricular hobby: novel-writing 
<http://thesetpieces.com/features/defender-steve-bruce-review/>. He did three 
of them, remarkably.

And if you’d like to hear an extract from one of them read out loud, here’s 
Football Weekly from a couple of weeks back

Good half for Villa. It’s not been 45 minutes of flowing, dominant football 
from Brucie’s boys, but they’ve been largely solid and have prevented 
Birmingham from creating much of note, beyond that Donaldson header that damn 
near went over the line. Great header for the goal. Great header.

45 mins + 4: A bit of space opens up in the middle for Birmingham, but again 
they can’t create something. That frustration from the crowd towards the ref 
might be a little misdirected.
 
45 mins + 2: Frustration grows in the home crowd as Kodjia trips himself up 
over Grounds’s torso, but a free-kick is given to the away team. Rowett is not 
best pleased.
 
45 mins: Five minutes of added time to come. 
 
44 mins: McCormack tries to shepherd the ball out for a goal kick under 
pressure from Che Adams, but it rebounds off his shin and goes out for a 
corn...oh, no, hello Mike Dean - a goal-kick is given. Forever the maverick, is 
Deano.
 
42 mins: Birmingham having trouble getting beyond about 40 yards from the 
Villa goal at the moment. They’re reduced to speculative long passes from deep, 
one of which Donaldson can’t control, another is too long for Spector down the 
right and possession is donated right back to Villa.
 
40 mins: Spector has his legs whipped away by Gardner, and here’s a chance for 
Birmingham to threaten from the free-kick on the right. Maghoma sticks it into 
the box and finds Shotton, but it goes over.
 
38 mins: Kodjia down on the turf after an aerial challenge with Shotton. The 
Brum centre-half was pretty robust but it looked like more his heavy landing on 
his left leg that caused the problem.
 
37 mins: Amavi gets the ball on the left, starts to lose control of it but 
then takes advantage of a slight hint of breath on his neck from Davis, and 
goes down. It works, as Dean gives the free-kick.
 
35 mins: Not vintage football in the last few minutes. Morrison gives the ball 
straight to Westwood, who clips it over the top of the defence looking for the 
run of Gardner, but Shotton scoots over and clears.
 
32 mins: It’d be a stretch to say Villa have been the better team, but man 
alive what a header that was. Sky summariser David Prutton describes Donaldson 
as “no slug” in the air. You sort of know what he’s getting at.
