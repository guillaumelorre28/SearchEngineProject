The vicory marked Barça's return to winning ways after the 3-2 defeat at Real 
Sociedad, their first of the campaign. Messi became the first player to score 
on 11 successiveLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> 
match days and, at 25, the youngest to reach 200 league goals.

He has scored more goals than all the other La Liga teams apart from Real and 
Atlético and is on course to beat the record for the most in a season (50) he 
set last term.

The Argentina forward opened the scoring in the 11th minute at the Camp Nou 
when he was sent clear in the penalty area by a pinpoint Xavi pass.

Messi waited for the goalkeeper Andrés Fernández to go to ground before 
walking the ball into the net.

The visitors, who are third from bottom on 18 points, grabbed a shock 
equaliser in the 24th minute through the midfielder Raoul Loe but their chances 
of causing an upset were ended when the defender Alejandro Arribas was shown a 
second yellow card three minutes later.

Arribas handled in the penalty area and Messi hammered the ball home from the 
spot before Daniel Alves unselfishly set up Pedro to tap in Barça's third goal 
five minutes before the break.

Messi completed his hat-trick in the 56th minute and added a fourth goal two 
minutes later.

"The important thing was to get through the match because when so much is 
being said about the 'Clasico' [against Real Madrid this week in the Copa Del 
Rey] it's not easy," Messi said. "We came out the same way as always and we 
achieved our goal."
