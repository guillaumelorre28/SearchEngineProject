The Köln striker Lukas Podolski refused to comment on a possible move to 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> this summer after 
earning his side a point in a 1-1 draw with Hoffenheim.

The Germany striker still has more than a year left on his contract with Köln, 
but has repeatedly expressed his disappointment at how his hometown club is 
being run and has been widely linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium at the 
end of theBundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> 
season.

Köln <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cologne> have not given up hope of 
convincing him to sign a new contract, and Podolski himself has not given 
anything away.

"I will give all I've got to the very end," he said at the Rhein-Neckar Arena. 
"We have 10 more very tough matches. Every game is a final for us. On Saturday 
we have an important game against Hertha [Berlin] and we need to win that game 
at all costs."

When pressed on whether he would be leaving Köln to join Arsenal in the 
summer, Podolski said he had "nothing to say" on the issue, asking only for the 
next question.

The Köln director of sport, Volker Finke, was equally tight-lipped, telling 
Bild newspaper: "We don't want to give any indication at all as to what stage 
we are at." But the coach, Stale Solbakken, said Podolski would "give 
everything for Köln in the last games" before adding "whether he moves or not".
