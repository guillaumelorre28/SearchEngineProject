In summary

Albania had their moments and created a couple of decent chances – but it may 
have turned out quite differently if they had 11 players on the pitch. Fabian 
Schar’s early header, capitalising on an error from the goalkeeper Etri 
Berisha, was enough to earn Vladimir Petkovic’sSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> an opening weekend win. 
Albania had their captain, Lorik Cana, sent off eight minutes before the 
interval for a second yellow due to a deliberate handball but battled well. In 
reality, neither are likely to trouble France in Group A and go deep into this 
tournament. But it was still an entertaining watch. Thanks for reading – now 
immediately turn your attention to Wales v Slovakia with Paul Doyle.

77 min: Albania get their chance, and fail to take it. Hysaj, forward from 
right back, squares to Sadiku but he cannot find the target from about eight 
yards, put off by Sommer stretching to cut out the angle. The shot, poorly 
executed, hits the side-netting.
 Armando Sadiku reacts with the Albanian fans after missing a chance.

75 min: Embolo has looked good and lively since coming on. Seferovic holds up 
the ball and slides to the Basel striker – he hits a first-time curler but 
misses the target narrowly.

66 min: Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> zip it 
about under little pressure before Shaqiri advances forward and Abrishi 
dispossesses him. Albania break through Lenjani, he hits the deck following a 
challenge from Behrami but the move continues until Embolo steals the ball from 
Kukeli. Embolo, possessor of fresh legs, charges forward and slides a lovely 
pass to Seferovic. He fends of Hysaj and finds space to shoot but Berisha saves 
well with his right boot. The referee comes back to book Behrami for his 
earlier tackle.

63 min: Taulant throws a tantrum: upset by the end of the Xhaka duel, he 
batters a bottle when reaching the dugout. His replacement, Kace, is booked for 
his first involvement – he loses possession to Behrami, pulls down the Swiss 
player’s shorts and then hacks at him. Err, not the best start for him.

56 min: Behrami, featuring a barnet almost as bad as Aaron Ramsey, fouls 
Kukeli on halfway. Speaking of Ramsey, there is a concern for Wales over the 
fitness of goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey for this evening’s game against Slovakia 
– confirmed team news is still 45 minutes away though.

53 min: Seferovic is denied by Berisha again after a sweet Granit Xhaka pass 
to the striker – the keeper is making up for his dismal error, standing up well 
to the striker’s toe poke and palming the ball away.

@alansmith90 <https://twitter.com/alansmith90> Not so sure an Albanian goal 
comes from a set-piece. There are definite gaps down the seams for Vardy-like 
fast breaks.

50 min: Djourou, as Arsenal fans may recall, is always capable of lapse and he 
almost allows Sadiku through when dallying and lazily attempting to clear a 
long ball forward.

Half-time: Albania 0-1 Switzerland

45 min +1: Shaqiri attempts to find Seferovic but overhits his pass, the ball 
trickling out for a goal-kick. And that’s the last act of the half. Schar’s 
early goal, heading into an empty net after Berisha, the Albania keeper, went 
walkabout, hasSwitzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 
ahead. Albania battled well and created a couple of decent chances before their 
captain, Cana, was dismissed for two yellows – the first an aggressive and late 
tackle on Dzemaili near halfway, the second a deliberate handball on the edge 
of the box – and they now have quite the task at hand to get back into the game.

44 min: Albania win their third corner. Xhaka will take … but Sommer is strong 
and confident and catches the ball – the antithesis of Berisha’s attempt from 
the corner that led to the goal.

Red card! Albania's captain Cana is sent off

37 min: Oh dear – just as they were getting back into the game, Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> lose their captain for a silly 
handball. He slips under pressure on the edge of the area from Seferovic and 
puts his arm out to handle the ball. The referee has no option but to flash a 
second yellow … and to make matters worse Shaqiri and Dzemaili are lining up a 
free-kick on the edge of the area.
 Lorik Cana clearly handles the ball under pressure from Seferovic.

Albania had their moments and created a couple of decent chances – but it may 
have turned out quite differently if they had 11 players on the pitch. Fabian 
Schar’s early header, capitalising on an error from the goalkeeper Etri 
Berisha, was enough to earn Vladimir Petkovic’sSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> an opening weekend win. 
Albania had their captain, Lorik Cana, sent off eight minutes before the 
interval for a second yellow due to a deliberate handball but battled well. In 
reality, neither are likely to trouble France in Group A and go deep into this 
tournament. But it was still an entertaining watch. Thanks for reading – now 
immediately turn your attention to Wales v Slovakia with Paul Doyle.

90 min +2: Mevraj concedes a free-kick deep in Switzerland’s half and they 
should kill the game off now and head to the corner.
 
90 min: There will be three minutes added on.
 
90 min: Abrashi wins a free-kick on the left. It’s taken short and quick to 
Kache and he sends a dismal diagonal straight into the hands of Sommer.
 
89 min: Kukeli, who has filled in at centre back for Cana, gets booked for 
cynically hauling down Embolo. He is entered into Seno Carballo’s black book.
 
88 min: Shaqiri is off, replaced by Gelson Fernandes. OK, on reflection after 
seeing a replay that is a very good save from Sommer but Gashi had far more to 
aim at.

87 min: Yes they can but it is wasted by the substitute Gashi, who is straight 
through on goal and with only Sommer to beat cannot pick a corner, allowing the 
keeper to make the save.

86 min: Lenjani sends in a cross from the left but there are no red shirts in 
the box and Sommer claims. CanAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> fashion another chance?
 
85 min: Shaqiri, who is still being jeered by the Albanian fans, delivers a 
stinking corner – putting far too much on the delivery.
 
84 min: Frei has a pop from range and it is deflected out for a corner.
 
83 min: Replays of Lenjani v Lictsteiner are shown and that appears harsh on 
Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania>. Very much file it under 
I’ve Seen ‘Em Given.
 
81 min: Now, at the opposite end, Seferovic goes down from a challenge by 
Berisha. Again the referee is not interested. Albania make their final change: 
Sadiku comes off, Shkelzen Gashi replaces him and instantly urges theAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> fans to make some noise.

80 min: Albania have calls for a penalty ignored. Lenjani appears to be 
obstructed by Lictsteiner. Both end up flailing on the floor and referee 
Carballo waves play on.
 
77 min: Albania get their chance, and fail to take it. Hysaj, forward from 
right back, squares to Sadiku but he cannot find the target from about eight 
yards, put off by Sommer stretching to cut out the angle. The shot, poorly 
executed, hits the side-netting.

76 min: A second change for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> sees Dzemaili trot off, 
replaced by Fabian Frei.
 
75 min: Embolo has looked good and lively since coming on. Seferovic holds up 
the ball and slides to the Basel striker – he hits a first-time curler but 
misses the target narrowly.
 
73 min: A positive change for Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> sees the target man Sokol 
Cikalleshi replace Odise Roshi, who spent much of the game wide on the right.
 
72 min: Albania will be satisfied with how they have stunted Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> but, really, they have not 
done enough to trouble Sommer. And the worry is if/when they commit more 
players forward, Embolo’s pace could punish them on the break.
 
69 min: Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> win their first 
corner of the half. Kace takes it on the left but Schar rises to head the ball 
away.
 
66 min: Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> zip it 
about under little pressure before Shaqiri advances forward and Abrishi 
dispossesses him. Albania break through Lenjani, he hits the deck following a 
challenge from Behrami but the move continues until Embolo steals the ball from 
Kukeli. Embolo, possessor of fresh legs, charges forward and slides a lovely 
pass to Seferovic. He fends of Hysaj and finds space to shoot but Berisha saves 
well with his right boot. The referee comes back to book Behrami for his 
earlier tackle.

Recine/Reuters  
64 min: Shaqiri takes the free-kick that follows but it’s a little too far out 
and Berisha makes an easy save.
 
63 min: Taulant throws a tantrum: upset by the end of the Xhaka duel, he 
batters a bottle when reaching the dugout. His replacement, Kace, is booked for 
his first involvement – he loses possession to Behrami, pulls down the Swiss 
player’s shorts and then hacks at him. Err, not the best start for him.

62 min: And a change for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> immediately followed – Breel 
Embolo, the highly-rated Basel forward, comes on for Admir Mehmedi.
 
61 min: Here comes that change, the first of the match. Ergys Kace replaces 
Taulant Xhaka.
 
60 min: Lenjani races forward but Lichtsteiner steps into where Djourou should 
be to quell any danger. Then a cross from the right is picked from the air by 
Sommer.
 
58 min: This is becoming desperately sloppy and error-strewn. There is no 
shortage of misplaced passes and numerous slips and poor control … butAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> are still in with a shout. They 
will make a substitute soon, too.
 
56 min: Behrami, featuring a barnet almost as bad as Aaron Ramsey, fouls 
Kukeli on halfway. Speaking of Ramsey, there is a concern for Wales over the 
fitness of goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey for this evening’s game against Slovakia 
– confirmed team news is still 45 minutes away though.
 
55 min: Granit Xhaka and Dzemaili share a heated exchange as the former 
berates the latter for moving the ball on too slowly.
 
53 min: Seferovic is denied by Berisha again after a sweet Granit Xhaka pass 
to the striker – the keeper is making up for his dismal error, standing up well 
to the striker’s toe poke and palming the ball away.

A slight problem: they do not have a Vardy-paced attacker.
 
52 min: Now Agolli sends a good pass forward to Sadiku but Djourou does well 
to block the avenue to goal, forcing the Albanian attacker out of play, leading 
to a goal-kick.
 
51 min: Djourou, awoken from his slumber by that dicey moment, heads a tasty 
cross from the left away.
 
50 min: Djourou, as Arsenal fans may recall, is always capable of lapse and he 
almost allows Sadiku through when dallying and lazily attempting to clear a 
long ball forward.
 
48 min: The early exchanges are tepid. Can the Swiss kill the game off with an 
early second goal? Or areAlbania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> 
capable of frustrating to the extent they can keep within one goal and threaten 
from a set piece? That appears their only likely route back into the game.
 
46 min: Switzerland gets us going again. No changes for either side.

45 min +1: Shaqiri attempts to find Seferovic but overhits his pass, the ball 
trickling out for a goal-kick. And that’s the last act of the half. Schar’s 
early goal, heading into an empty net after Berisha, the Albania keeper, went 
walkabout, hasSwitzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 
ahead. Albania battled well and created a couple of decent chances before their 
captain, Cana, was dismissed for two yellows – the first an aggressive and late 
tackle on Dzemaili near halfway, the second a deliberate handball on the edge 
of the box – and they now have quite the task at hand to get back into the game.

45 min: There will be one minute added on.
 
44 min: Albania win their third corner. Xhaka will take … but Sommer is strong 
and confident and catches the ball – the antithesis of Berisha’s attempt from 
the corner that led to the goal.
 
43 min: Dzemaili finds Seferovic with a suave through ball but the striker’s 
shot is well stopped by Berisha.
 
Human Sporting Encyclopedia Rob Smyth is quick to point out an uncanny 
resemblance between Cana and Beckenbauer
 
41 min: Dzemaili goes close after Lichtsteiner squares to him, shooting first 
time with his right but only finding the side-netting.
 
39 min: Linjani finds himself alone in attack for Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> and, crowded by white shirts, 
has no option but to send a speculative effort goalwards. It is tame and Sommer 
makes the easiest of easy saves.
 
38 min: Dzemaili takes, it is deflected and comes back off the right post. 
Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> will be looking 
to kill this off with a second before half-time now.
 
37 min: Oh dear – just as they were getting back into the game, Albania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> lose their captain for a silly 
handball. He slips under pressure on the edge of the area from Seferovic and 
puts his arm out to handle the ball. The referee has no option but to flash a 
second yellow … and to make matters worse Shaqiri and Dzemaili are lining up a 
free-kick on the edge of the area.
 Lorik Cana clearly handles the ball under pressure from Seferovic.

36 min: Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> venture 
forward for the first time in a little while but Shaqiri is punished for a 
nudge on Roshi, who hits the deck far too easily. The referee still gives a 
free-kick.
 
33 min: Albania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> charge forward 
menacingly once more but Roshi’s low cross from the right edge of the box is 
cleared.
 
32 min: Rodriguez is penalised for a shoulder charge on Hysaj. A free-kick and 
nothing more on the right wing, a few yards inside theAlbania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/albania> half.
