.

Robins, who has signed a three-year deal, watched on from the stands as 
Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> beat 10-man 
Gillingham at Priestfield on Saturday.

He said: “First and foremost, I’m delighted. I watched the game on Saturday 
and was very encouraged with what I saw.

“Gillingham is not an easy place to go and we controlled that game. To gain a 
job, someone has to lose a job and Russ did a fantastic job last season and has 
brought in some great players.

“It’s exciting times for the football club. Injuries have caused us problems, 
so we have to get those players back. Every job is a different challenge. But 
saying that, it’s the same challenge, we have to start picking points up.

“There are reasons to be optimistic within the squad but obviously there are 
areas to be worked on. That will be an ongoing thing. There are no panic 
stations yet. We’ve got a lot of games left and we will put in a plan to not 
only get out of this but play exciting football.”
