If Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
beat Middlesbrough this will be a fifth successive Premier League win for José 
Mourinho’s in-form side. Two seasons have passed since United last did the same 
number. In the sole golden run under Louis van Gaal, the February-April period 
of the 2014-15 season, United won six consecutive league games and offered an 
outside chance of the title before defeat at Chelsea, the eventual champions. 
The manager of the west Londoners then? Mourinho.Jamie Jackson
