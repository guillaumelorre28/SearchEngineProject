and the cast of the diversity-celebrating hit musical Hamilton, after the 
vice-president elect,Mike Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>
, was booed by the audience.

Trump took to Twitter to demand an apology from the cast after its members 
called on Pence and the incoming Trump administration

 to respect the rights of all Americans.

“Our wonderful future VP Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theatre by

blazing. This should not happen!”, Trump tweeted.

The Indiana governor was booed by theatregoers after he arrived at the Richard 
Rodgers theatre in New York on Friday night to see the Pulitzer prize-winning 
musical.

Then, after the curtain call, one of the actors, Brandon Victor Dixon, 
addressed Pence from the stage, with the cast behind him. “Vice-president elect 
Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us, just a few more 
moments. There’s nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen,” Dixon said. “We’re 
all here sharing a story about love.

“We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new 
administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or 
defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope this show has 
inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All 
of us.”

Many of the remaining audience began to cheer softly as Dixon pointed towards 
Pence. “We thank you for sharing this wonderful American story, told by a 
diverse group of men and women of different colours, creeds and orientations,” 
he said.

But the president-elect took exception to the cast’s intervention. “The 
theatre must always be a safe and special place,” Trump tweeted. “The cast of 
Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologise!”

Dixon fired back at Trump’s allegations of harassment. “Conversation is not 
harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike-pence for stopping to listen,” he 
tweeted in response.

According to Variety the performance was sporadically disrupted by loud booing 
at the presence of a strong conservative and evangelical Christian, with a 
voting record that shows opposition to gay rights, at aBroadway

Outside, many protesters jeered, including one woman who held up a sign with a 
line from the musical that always gets a cheer: “Immigrants: we get the job 
done.”

It was not clear whether Pence heard the whole address or made any response.

The incident brings into focus the conflicts and divisions that Donald Trump’s 
nascent presidency has already brought to Manhattan. His midtown home and 
transition HQ, Trump Tower, has been turned into a fortified citadel by the 
police and Secret Service, causing congestion and chaos in the area.

Meanwhile, foreign leaders and diplomats are running a gauntlet of protesters 
to meet with the president-elect, and finding that they are taking meetings not 
with Trump and foreign policy advisers, but surrounded by family members.

When the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Trump in his gilded 
penthouse last week, he found himself seated across from Trump’s daughter, 
Ivanka, whose jewellery business last week sent out a marketing email pointing 
to the bracelet she wore during her father’s interview on the current affairs 
show 60 Minutes.

Hamilton is a hip-hop musical biography of Alexander Hamilton, one of the 
founding fathers of the United States, who rose to become the righthand man of 
George Washington, as well as a key figure in the creation of the US financial 
system and the coastguard. He was killed in an 1804 duel with the then 
vice-president Aaron Burr – the character Dixon plays in the show.

The musical, which has enjoyed a spectacular run on Broadway, was created by 
Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom it turned into a superstar. He had a long run in the 
lead part before relinquishing it earlier this year to Javier Muñoz, his 
understudy.

Muñoz is openly gay and HIV-positive. He has made a point of speaking out 
about living with HIV since 2002 and his hopes to diminish the stigma around 
the condition.
