campaigns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/europe-top-four-leagues-guaranteed-four-automatic-champions-league-places>
, which appears to favour major European clubs in the continent’s richest 
leagues, it’s perhaps no surprise that other clubs who feel frozen out by the

European breakaway league.

At the forefront of these negotiations are Danish club FC Copenhagen. Club 
director Anders Horsholt has revealed discussions have been held  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/atlantic-league-fc-copenhagen-director-scotland?CMP=share_btn_tw>
over a potential European league involving teams from Scotland, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Sweden. Stale Solbakken’s side have made a 
great start to this season’s Champions League and are worried that they and 
other medium-sized European clubs will be squeezed out by bigger clubs in 
future Champions League campaigns. Norwegian champions Rosenborg are also 
apparentlykeen on the idea

, having totally dominated their domestic league this season but failed to 
advance through the Champions League qualifying rounds.

We’d like to hear the thoughts of supporters from the countries linked to this 
breakaway league. What impact would an “Atlantic league” have on clubs? Have the
Uefa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa> proposals left clubs with 
little option or is there a better alternative than a breakaway league? Share 
your thoughts with us by filling the form out below. We’ll feature a selection
