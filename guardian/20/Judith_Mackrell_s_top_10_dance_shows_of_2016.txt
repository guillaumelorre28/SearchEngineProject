1 Betroffenheit 
Sadler’s Wells, London 

It was a tribute to Crystal Pite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/12/crystal-pite-girls-ballet-choreographer-prized-mavericks>
’s choreographic imagination and craft that a work so harrowing in its subject 
matter should have been so compelling, and even beautiful, to watch. 
Betroffenheit (the German word expresses a state of traumatised emotion) was 
created in collaboration with the actor and writer Jonathon Young. Having taken 
as its starting point the terrible accident that led to the deaths of Young’s 
daughter, nephew and niece, it explored the condition of human suffering in two 
hours of raw, heroic and coruscating dance theatre.

At its centre was Young himself, locked inside the hellhole of his grief and 
guilt, and tormented by voices that either urged him to search for meaning in 
his own tragedy or alternatively tempted him to escape into the numbing embrace 
of drink and drugs.

During the first half of the work Young’s performance was a searingly physical 
embodiment of nightmare as he argued with his private demons, brilliantly 
depicted as a chorus of trashy and sinister cabaret performers. Pite’s framing 
choreography was no less extraordinary, especially in the second half where the 
dynamics and patterns of pure movement were used to evoke a more abstract 
poetry of grief and redemption and where the dancers were astounding in their 
responsiveness and clarity.

Betroffenheit was cruelly staunch in its refusal to grant any easy insights 
into the meaning of suffering or to deliver any consoling promises of recovery, 
yet the work built to an intensity that was cathartic. Clear-eyed, humane and 
fraught with a terrible kind of poetry, this work kept faith with the power of 
art to navigate depths of experience that lie beyond the scope of reason.Read a

 Transcendence … Swan Lake/Loch na hEala. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the 
Guardian 
Just when you thought there was nothing new to extract from this overworked 
and often abused classic, Michael Keegan-Dolan created a version whose 
bleakness and comedy were touched by moments of pure poetic transcendence. 
Updating the story to the Irish Midlands (the choreographer’s rich home 
terrain), Loch na hEala supplied a poignant and brutally credible back story to 
the ballet’s original narrative while at the same time heightening the magic of 
its dream logic.Read a full review

It was a spectacularly successful year for Akram Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/27/akram-khan-giselle-migrant-english-national-ballet-tamara-rojo-interview>
. His new Giselle for English National Ballet entirely justified his decision 
to update the Romantic classic to the wilderness world of migrant workers and 
refugees. Even if Khan’s choreography did not completely nail the storytelling, 
it created a transfixing, poetic take on the emotional intensities of the 
ballet especially in the witchy, spectral point work of Act 2. The ballet was a 
gift to ENB’s dancers, and it formed a worthy companion piece to Khan’s other 
2016 triumph,Until the Lions

As newly appointed principal at the Royal Ballet, Francesca Hayward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/19/francesca-hayward-next-great-ballerina>
 had a superb season, displaying her exquisite musicality and intrepid 
technique across a wide range of roles. Her most captivating debut however was 
in Frederick Ashton’s Fille, where she was partnered by Marcelino Sambé. Both 
dancers were skimmingly light and fast in the finely embroidered detail of 
Ashton’s choreography, but they also brought a very 21st-century charm and 
naturalism to the lovers’ story that promised a fine partnership in the making.

The Ailey company’s dancers would look marvellous in pretty much anything, but 
the repertory they performed for this UK tour gave fresh insights into their 
spirit and versatility. While the company brought their traditional mix of 
sincerity and showmanship to their signature classic Revelations, they were 
equally fine in Paul Taylor’s witty tango piece, Piazzolla Caldera, Rennie 
Harris’s hip-hop-inflected Exodus and Christopher Wheeldon’s neoclassical duet, 
After the Rain. How fabulous they looked too,sharing the stage with the Royal

 Surreal … BalletBoyz perform Rabbit. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the 
Guardian 
This superb all-male company reinvented themselves yet again, with a double 
bill of work that was unlike anything else on the British dance stage. Pontus 
Lidberg’s Rabbit was a captivating fusion of surreal imagery and psychological 
depth exploring the dynamics of loneliness, power play and sexual attraction 
amongst the men. Javier de Frutos’s Fiction was one of the funniest dances I’d 
seen in ages, a combination of text and choreography that played dark, mordant 
games around the idea of the choreographer’s own death.Read a full review

In this beautifully paced and emotionally transparent solo, Marc Brew

paralysed from the waist down. It opened in a white, bright hospitalised space 
where Brew’s dancing was restricted to a choreography of confinement and 
yearning but progressed through a powerful journey of discovery and endurance, 
ending in a final liberating apotheosis whose elation felt joyously earned.Read

There were moments when Cathy Marston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/02/ballet.dance>’s new work for 
Northern Ballet got lost in the detours of Charlotte Brontë’s plot, but it kept 
exemplary and imaginative faith with the prickly independence and righteous 
anger of its heroine. Marston displayed a novelist’s attention to nuance as her 
choreography charted Jane’s journey from the jagged tantrums of her childhood, 
through the wary self-containment of her adult self, to finding tenderness in 
her closing love duet with Rochester.Read a full review
