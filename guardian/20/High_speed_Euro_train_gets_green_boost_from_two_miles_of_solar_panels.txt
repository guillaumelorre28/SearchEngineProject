A two-mile-long Belgian rail tunnel, built to shelter trains from falling 
trees, will from Monday provide a double environmental benefit by hosting a 
unique solar power project.

The high-speed line running from Paris to Amsterdam passes Antwerp and a 
nearby ancient forest. To avoid the need to fell protected trees, a long tunnel 
was built over the line which has now been topped with 16,000 solar panels. The 
electricity produced is equivalent to that needed to power all the trains in
Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/world/belgium> for one day per year, and 
will also help power Antwerp station.

"For train operators, it is the perfect way to cut their carbon footprints 
because you can use spaces that have no other economic value and the projects 
can be delivered within a year because they don't attract the protests that 
wind power does," said Bart Van Renterghem, UK head of Belgian renewable energy 
companyEnfinity <http://www.enfinity.biz/EN/>, which installed the panels. 

"We had a couple of projects lined up around London with train operators and 
water utilities, but they have been put on hold."

Van Renterghem said this was due to the UK government's controversial review 
of subsidies for large-scale solar power projects 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/18/slash-feed-in-tariffs>, 
which will lower the returns available.

The UK government argues that solar technology is too expensive, but Van 
Renterghem said he had seen the cost of cells halve in the last two to three 
years thanks to economies of scale in Germany, France and Belgium.

The new Blackfriars station <http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/6243.aspx> in 
London, which will span the River Thames, will host the largest single 
collection of solar panels in the UK when it opens in spring 2012.

The roof of the new station will have 4,400 panels and a capacity of 1MW, 
enough to provide 50% of the station's electricity. However, the development is 
not dependent on the level of government subsidy for solar power as the Â£7.3m 
bill was paid by the transport department's environment fund.
