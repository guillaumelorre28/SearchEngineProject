Hidden under turf and grass, Kolarbyn’s charcoal huts, 30 miles from the city 
of Västerås, scream fairytale. They forgo electricity or running water in 
favour of old-fashioned pleasures: you drift off in front of a log fire and 
awake to birdsong. Beds are inflatable mattresses with sheepskin rugs, and 
guests chop their own wood and pick their own blueberries. Guided activity 
options in the surrounding spruce forest include overnight beaver safaris.

East of Sweden’s capital is the Stockholm archipelago, where islands calve 
into the Baltic. Reached via two ferries, Blidö is one of the furthest out, an 
airy place of woods, hedgerows, rye fields and timber houses. Among the latter 
is this two-person studio cottage, right on the water. Its bright interiors 
include a conservatory – perfect for watching the sunset – and a sauna, while 
outside, canoes are tied to your own private jetty, and there are bikes to 
pedal around, watching for roe deer.

Less far-flung but similarly rustic is Grinda island. Just back from the sea, 
an attractive “cabin village” has 27 units in various sizes among apple trees. 
Each cabin has a private patio, simple kitchen and barbecue, with shared shower 
units and water taps close at hand. Visitors can rent kayaks, hike through 
meadows on a nature trail, and swim; seal-watching trips and petanque games 
demand less adrenaline. Most restful of all is the nearby Hotel Wärdshus’s 
floating sauna.

West Sweden’s new Meet the Swedes scheme allows tourists to chum up with 
friendly locals and benefit from their neighbourhood knowledge. Those who rent 
Maria and Sture Boström’s summer house on Rossö island, for instance, can 
accompany the couple on hikes or kayak trips, or simply share a barbecue. They 
offer fishing and golf recommendations, too. Although the cottage has a kitchen 
and garden, it has no hot water and the toilet is outside.

The name means Lapland Pearl, and this pretty property borders a lake and 
reindeer farm deep in northern Sweden. Tenants can fish for perch, trout and 
grayling, and have a small, sandy beach, a skiff and two bikes to themselves. 
The one-bedroom cottage has a sauna and kitchen, but most tempting is the 
light-filled, cushion-covered conservatory. Bring an eye mask if visiting in 
summer, as the midnight sun can make sleep difficult.

Crimson-painted fishermen’s cabins are a traditional feature of northern 
Norway’s wild Lofoten archipelago. Sample one of these stiltedrorbu – 
timber-built and each boasting modern kitchens, lounges and nice bathrooms – in 
the cod-fishing town of Svolvær. Try surfing lessons and deep-sea rafting 
before scoffing whisky-marinated Arctic char and cloudberry cheesecake at the 
quayside Børsen Spiseri fish restaurant.

Waterfalls, vertiginous green slopes and a meandering, idyllic waterway 
explain why Unesco-protected Geirangerfjord is one of Norway’s premier tourist 
spots. Overlooking it – and positioned just off the hairpin-happy Eagle Road – 
are Grande Hytteutleige’s five simple cabins. Bedding, fridges and a patio are 
included, but showers and toilets are in a separate building, 10 metres away. 
Kayaks and motorboats are available for rent, with scenic hiking paths heading 
into the hills.

The Norwegian Trekking Association maintains 460 cottages, huts and other 
accommodation around its thrilling countryside. While some are basic, others 
are quite stylish. With a Game of Thrones-vibe and open until mid-September, 
Breidablik’s two stone cabins (sleeping 10 altogether – you pay per person and 
may not have it to yourselves) have grass roofs and come with crockery, 
blankets and firewood. The views of forested valleys are magnificent, with lots 
of peak-bagging options all around. Be sure to reserve ahead.

Norway’s largest waterway is the Sognefjord, and this family-owned campsite is 
near its southern end. Cabins have kitchen, shower and toilet. There’s free 
Wi-Fi, too, but you’ll probably be far too busy admiring Jostedalsbreen, 
continental Europe’s largest glacier. Other local activities include salmon 
fishing and, rather improbably, beach volleyball.

The Oslofjord curves round from the Norwegian capital towards the Baltic. One 
of its largest islands is gentle-paced Brønnøya, with its apple orchards, 
gravel roads and beaches. This attractive waterside cabin sleeping six is 
shrouded in plants and has a bright, white-walled kitchen and three bedrooms. 
There are bikes and board games to use, and access to a tennis court. Oslo is 
15 minutes away.

Budget alternatives don’t come much quirkier. Each dinky camping pod has a 
bedroom and lounge area, plus electricity, radiators, Wi-Fi and proper 
mattresses. Guests also have access to a cooking cabin, hot tubs and a 
restaurant that overlooks a waterfall and sometimes doubles as a recording 
studio for owner Steinar’s band. All around are rivers, lakes and mountains, 
linked by footpaths.

Brennistaðir farm has three cottages – plus camping pitches – amid its fields, 
manor, sheep, goats, horses and pet rabbits. Each roomy retreat sleeps five, 
and has a patio and lounge, but only Berghylur backs onto a waterfall. Farm 
tours are happily provided, as is sage advice on how best to tackle the 
dramatic Snæfellsnes peninsula, a short drive away.

second world war. There are motorboats for hire for further exploration.

Fun, funky and – if filled to capacity – affordable, this eye-catching home is 
formed of nine cylinders fused to form a three-bedroom villa for six. The 
interiors have wood, steel and pebble floors, and beds are in snugs with large 
windows. Their view is of sandy Råbylille beach, just one reason why tourists 
are lured to the southern island of Møn. Others include fish-smoking 
restaurants art galleries, chalk cliffs and tranquil meadows.

Taking the family to Denmark? Few sites are better set up for little’uns than 
Gjerrild Nordstrand on the Djursland peninsula. It packs in two playgrounds 
with trampolines, plus a beach-volleyball court and heated kids’ and adults’ 
pools. Grenå Beach, one of Denmark’s best, is only 300 metres away. Among the 
secluded cabins, opt for the well-furnished three-bedroom red one (sleeping 
six) and enjoy its hot tub.

Want to be close to Copenhagen? This splashy option for two people is only 
half an hour away by public transport, although its sleepy Søllerød Lake 
setting makes that hard to believe. Woodland tennis courts and a golf course 
are nearer still, while across the water is Michelin-starred restaurant 
Søllerød Kro. A rowing boat stands ready – supposing you can resist the large 
pool, that is. The digs include a double bed, kitchenette, bathroom and Wi-Fi.
