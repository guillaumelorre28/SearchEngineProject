Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have 
confirmed that Gelson Fernandes has joined St Etienne for an undisclosed fee. 
The Swiss midfielder found himself on the fringes last season after Mark 
Hughes' arrival from Blackburn as manager.

Fernandes moved to City from FC Sion in July 2007 and made his debut in the 
Carling Cup win over Bristol City a month later. He made 59 appearances, 
scoring four times, but he was increasingly used as a substitute.

St Etienne <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stetienne> are currently 
coached by the former Portsmouth manager Alain Perrin.
