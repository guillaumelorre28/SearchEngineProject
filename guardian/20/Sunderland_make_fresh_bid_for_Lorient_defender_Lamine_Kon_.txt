The Sunderland manager has twice ended his interest in the 26-year Ivorian 
this month with the Black Cats initially cooling on a £5m

 deal and then negotiations breaking down on the other side of the Channel 
after a loan move had been proposed.

However, the transfer has been resurrected with the Lorient vice-president 
Alex Hayes confirming that the club had received a bid it “couldn’t refuse”.

Hayes told Ouest France: “Sunderland have come back with a firm offer that we 
couldn’t refuse. The ball is therefore in Lamine Koné’s camp. He has to make 
his decision in the coming hours.”

Allardyce has signalled his intention to bring in another defender and an 
attacking player before the end of the transfer window having already signed 
Jan Kirchhoff, Dame N’Doye and Steve Harper.

Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> are also 
monitoring full-back Mathieu Debuchy’s situation at Arsenal as he looks for 
regular club football before this summer’s Euro 2016 finals, although they face 
a battle with fellow Premier League strugglers Aston Villa if they are to 
strike a loan deal.

A successful swoop for Koné could see the Uruguayan defender Sebastián Coates 
leave Wearside with the former Liverpool player understood to be the subject of 
talks with the Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon.
