My heart goes out to Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>, 
who fought back brilliantly in the second half before Jamie Vincent’s sucker 
punch. If they were fortuitous in the route they had to the final, they were 
perhaps unlucky to lose today.

It’s Inverness who lift the trophy though, and Vincent, who has scored 11 
goals in eight years with Caley, Stockport and Kidderminster, who becomes a 
bona fide Cup hero. Thanks for joining me.Cheerio!

Speaking of St. Johnstone

With apologies to Simon McMahon, one for mention for the Saints, who sneak 
into the Europa League as a result of Inverness’ win. John Hughes’ side also 
skip a round, and a couple of weeks’ well-earned holiday.

So, despite a Herculean effort from Falkirk in the second half, Inverness 
recover from a red card and equaliser to snatch the spoils in an even, 
end-to-end contest, with Marley Watkins scoring one and crucially, if 
indirectly, setting up Jamie Vincent’s winner. For the second year running, 
there’s a brand new name on theScottish Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup>. Whoever said Scottish 
football was predictable?

inside 90 minutes – but now, they’re back to searching for an equaliser. Maybe 
that’s more their thing. Two minutes of normal time to go.

GOAL! Falkirk 1-2 Inverness Caledonian Thistle (Vincent)

Who saw that coming? As Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> 
pile forward, Watkins breaks, and he shows plenty of nous to evade his marker 
despite his tired legs. His shot, placed wide of MacDonald, isn’t powerful 
enough – but MacDonald can only push it out, and sub Vincent, who had raced the 
length of the pitch, was first to the rebound to slot home!

down the right, is miles ahead of marker Williams – but his first touch is 
edgy, and he’s closed down.

81 mins: So, second-tier Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>
, a man up and with the momentum, might just be favourites for this now, while 
Inverness have to somehow steady the ship.

37,000 fans inside Hampden today – with average attendances for both these 
teams below the 5,000 mark, that’s a solid turnout.

GOAL! Falkirk 1-1 Inverness Caledonian Thistle (Grant)

This has been coming for the last forty minutes, and from a free kick close to 
the byline, Alston puts in a teasing delivery – and centre-back Grant is on 
hand to thunk home a close-range header!
 Falkirk are back in the game with a thunk, courtesy of Peter Grant’s head ...

76 mins: Inverness fans, hold onto your hats. Moments after Tremarco’s 
departure, Draper fails to control the ball on the edge of his own area, and 
the ball bobbles up and hits his arm. The referee, right behind him, shakes his 
head. It looked a handball, although perhaps just outside the area.

RED CARD! Tremarco sent off for Inverness Caley Thistle!

...Falkirk clear, Alston breaks – and suddenly, there’s only Tremarco between 
him and the goalkeeper! Tremarco hauls him down – and Collum, who hasn’t shown 
a single yellow, has little option but to show a straight red!

71 mins: Falkirk continue to press, with Taiwo’s shot blocked away, before the 
lively Biabi fires a low shot wide of Esson’s far post. Vincent is on, but in 
place of Ryan Christie, rather than Watkins.

68 mins: Goalscorer Watkins’ afternoon could be about to come to an 
ignominious end – he went down after falling over the ball, and needed a couple 
of minutes’ treatment. Jamie Vincent is primed to come on for Caley, but 
Watkins will be given a few moments to recover first.

65 mins: Falkirk come right back at Caley, forcing two corners in quick 
succession. The second, whipped in by Sibbald, lands to Vaulks, who drifts away 
from his marker – and after a smart turn back onto his right, he lifts a chip 
inches over the bar!

63 mins: Inverness try to break, but Watkins has too much to do, all alone on 
the right flank. Eventually, a Falkirk foul gives Caley a chance from a 
set-piece. Tansey’s long ball is headed on by Ofere towards Meekings, butFalkirk
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> clear, and Tansey is forced 
into what we’ll call a containing foul.

61 mins: This has been a terrific response from Falkirk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>. The game looked to only be 
going one way at half-time, but they’ve been dominant in the second half. They 
force a corner, but it comes to nothing, and Smith is replaced by Botti Biabi.

60 mins: Whistles abound as Duffie charges down the right wing, with Tremarco 
lying prone on the touchline. Caley can’t complain; they gave possession away 
with Tremarco already down. Duffie’s cross finds Alston, who really should do 
better from a central area, instead raising a leg to spoon the ball well over 
the bar.

55 mins: Inverness are a bag of nerves, trying and failing to clear the ball 
before it falls once more to Vaulks – but his shot from the edge of the area is 
deflected behind. From the corner, the statuesque Collum gets in the way of 
Leahy, and Caley break – but Watkins, incorrectly flagged offside, fires into 
the side netting.

53 mins: Falkirk are playing towards their own fans in the second half, and 
there’s plenty of noise behind Ryan Esson’s goal as Loy is brought down on the 
edge of the area. Ref Willie Collum is unmoved.

51 mins: Vaulks, playing at the base of midfield, has arguably been Falkirk’s 
biggest goal threat – and again, he flashes a low shot just wide. This from a 
player who began hisFalkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>

49 mins: It’s not just in Inverness where a Caley Cup win would be celebrated; 
there will be moderate jigging in the streets of Perth too. A win for 
Inverness, who already made the Europa League by finishing third in the top 
flight, would open up a space for fourth-placed finishers, and last year’s Cup 
winners, St. Johnstone.

Shinnie, but he avoids a booking. Gary Warren is pictured up in the stands – 
this is the second final he’s missed for the Highlanders through suspension.

45 mins: Falkirk have Peter Grant to thank for not being two goals, or indeed 
a man, down at the half – Doran is one on one with the centre-back, but Grant 
dispossesses with an expert sliding tackle. That’ll do for the first half.

touch of a dry stone wall pull off a two-touch dribble round the keeper. 
Chapeau, Marley Watkins. The half, as you might expect, is drifting towards its 
conclusion.

My heart goes out to Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>, 
who fought back brilliantly in the second half before Jamie Vincent’s sucker 
punch. If they were fortuitous in the route they had to the final, they were 
perhaps unlucky to lose today.

It’s Inverness who lift the trophy though, and Vincent, who has scored 11 
goals in eight years with Caley, Stockport and Kidderminster, who becomes a 
bona fide Cup hero. Thanks for joining me.Cheerio!

Speaking of St. Johnstone

With apologies to Simon McMahon, one for mention for the Saints, who sneak 
into the Europa League as a result of Inverness’ win. John Hughes’ side also 
skip a round, and a couple of weeks’ well-earned holiday.
 
So, despite a Herculean effort from Falkirk in the second half, Inverness 
recover from a red card and equaliser to snatch the spoils in an even, 
end-to-end contest, with Marley Watkins scoring one and crucially, if 
indirectly, setting up Jamie Vincent’s winner. For the second year running, 
there’s a brand new name on theScottish Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup>. Whoever said Scottish 
football was predictable?
 
It’s finished Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> 1-2 
Inverness, and the Highlanders have won the first major trophy in their history!
 
95 mins: A spell of head tennis that for both sets of fans, must have lasted 
an eternity. Eventually, painstakingly, Ryan Esson hauls the ball in. Surely 
time is up...
 
94 mins: Falkirk looking a little forlorn now, but Peter Houston makes a 
change, with Taylor Morgan on for Loy. Time for one more heave forward...
 
93 mins: Poor Watkins’ legs have finally gone, and he’s replaced by Nick Ross 
(not that one) for the last few minutes. They’ve ground their way through three 
minutes of the five added on – although most of that was while Watkins hobbled 
off.
 
90 mins: Alston’s effort hits a very solid Caley wall, before Leahy blazes the 
rebound over. Five minutes of stoppage time. What a Cup final!
 
89 mins: A free kick for Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>
, as Loy is clumsily upended by Tansey. This is central, and about 18 inches 
outside the penalty area. Now or never...
 
88 mins: Goodness gracious. Falkirk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> had looked the only winners 
inside 90 minutes – but now, they’re back to searching for an equaliser. Maybe 
that’s more their thing. Two minutes of normal time to go.
 
Who saw that coming? As Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> 
pile forward, Watkins breaks, and he shows plenty of nous to evade his marker 
despite his tired legs. His shot, placed wide of MacDonald, isn’t powerful 
enough – but MacDonald can only push it out, and sub Vincent, who had raced the 
length of the pitch, was first to the rebound to slot home!

via Reuters  He’s rather pleased. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images  
85 mins: Vaulks threads the ball out wide, and Duffie, again bombing forward 
down the right, is miles ahead of marker Williams – but his first touch is 
edgy, and he’s closed down.
 
83 mins: Vaulks, practicing for that 30-yard stoppage time winner, has another 
go from distance – but his acrobatic effort deflects wide off his own team-mate.
Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> still pressing.
 
81 mins: So, second-tier Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>
, a man up and with the momentum, might just be favourites for this now, while 
Inverness have to somehow steady the ship.

37,000 fans inside Hampden today – with average attendances for both these 
teams below the 5,000 mark, that’s a solid turnout.
 
This has been coming for the last forty minutes, and from a free kick close to 
the byline, Alston puts in a teasing delivery – and centre-back Grant is on 
hand to thunk home a close-range header!
 Falkirk are back in the game with a thunk, courtesy of Peter Grant’s head ...

Russell Cheyne/Reuters  
78 mins: Danny Williams is on for Doran, as John Hughes looks to shut up shop. 
ForFalkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>, Taiwo picks up a 
booking.
 
76 mins: Inverness fans, hold onto your hats. Moments after Tremarco’s 
departure, Draper fails to control the ball on the edge of his own area, and 
the ball bobbles up and hits his arm. The referee, right behind him, shakes his 
head. It looked a handball, although perhaps just outside the area.
 
...Falkirk clear, Alston breaks – and suddenly, there’s only Tremarco between 
him and the goalkeeper! Tremarco hauls him down – and Collum, who hasn’t shown 
a single yellow, has little option but to show a straight red!

73 mins: Greg Tansey is tripped in midfield, then takes an age to line up a 
free kick, before firing it into a cluster of defenders. Inverness playing for 
time...
 
71 mins: Falkirk continue to press, with Taiwo’s shot blocked away, before the 
lively Biabi fires a low shot wide of Esson’s far post. Vincent is on, but in 
place of Ryan Christie, rather than Watkins.
 
68 mins: Goalscorer Watkins’ afternoon could be about to come to an 
ignominious end – he went down after falling over the ball, and needed a couple 
of minutes’ treatment. Jamie Vincent is primed to come on for Caley, but 
Watkins will be given a few moments to recover first.
 
65 mins: Falkirk come right back at Caley, forcing two corners in quick 
succession. The second, whipped in by Sibbald, lands to Vaulks, who drifts away 
from his marker – and after a smart turn back onto his right, he lifts a chip 
inches over the bar!
 
63 mins: Inverness try to break, but Watkins has too much to do, all alone on 
the right flank. Eventually, a Falkirk foul gives Caley a chance from a 
set-piece. Tansey’s long ball is headed on by Ofere towards Meekings, butFalkirk
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> clear, and Tansey is forced 
into what we’ll call a containing foul.
 
61 mins: This has been a terrific response from Falkirk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk>. The game looked to only be 
going one way at half-time, but they’ve been dominant in the second half. They 
force a corner, but it comes to nothing, and Smith is replaced by Botti Biabi.
 
60 mins: Whistles abound as Duffie charges down the right wing, with Tremarco 
lying prone on the touchline. Caley can’t complain; they gave possession away 
with Tremarco already down. Duffie’s cross finds Alston, who really should do 
better from a central area, instead raising a leg to spoon the ball well over 
the bar.
 
58 mins: Loy, back from a lengthy injury, is tripped unceremoniously by Devine 
– but the referee, as he’s done all match, keeps the yellow card in his pocket. 
From the free kick,Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> are 
flagged offside. 65% possession for the Bairns since the break, and a long half 
hour or so for Caley to come.
 
55 mins: Inverness are a bag of nerves, trying and failing to clear the ball 
before it falls once more to Vaulks – but his shot from the edge of the area is 
deflected behind. From the corner, the statuesque Collum gets in the way of 
Leahy, and Caley break – but Watkins, incorrectly flagged offside, fires into 
the side netting.
 
53 mins: Falkirk are playing towards their own fans in the second half, and 
there’s plenty of noise behind Ryan Esson’s goal as Loy is brought down on the 
edge of the area. Ref Willie Collum is unmoved.
 
51 mins: Vaulks, playing at the base of midfield, has arguably been Falkirk’s 
biggest goal threat – and again, he flashes a low shot just wide. This from a 
player who began hisFalkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> 
career playing for free, after being released by Workington.
 
49 mins: It’s not just in Inverness where a Caley Cup win would be celebrated; 
there will be moderate jigging in the streets of Perth too. A win for 
Inverness, who already made the Europa League by finishing third in the top 
flight, would open up a space for fourth-placed finishers, and last year’s Cup 
winners, St. Johnstone.
 
47 mins: A quiet start here, with Smith ending a Falkirk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> attack with a petulant lunge at 
Shinnie, but he avoids a booking. Gary Warren is pictured up in the stands – 
this is the second final he’s missed for the Highlanders through suspension. 
Once is unlucky, twice is careless.
 
45 minutes for Falkirk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> to save 
their, and indeed Aston Villa’s, cup dreams. They get us underway; no changes 
at half-time.
 
So, Inverness are halfway there after edging the first half, with Marley 
Watkins getting the goal. More to follow, but for now, I’ll let the Inverness 
Caley Thistle official Twitter feed fill you in on the first half highlights:
 
45 mins: Falkirk have Peter Grant to thank for not being two goals, or indeed
