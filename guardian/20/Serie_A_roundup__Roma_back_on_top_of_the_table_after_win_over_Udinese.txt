Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> opened the scoring against 
Udinese after four minutes when Miralem Pjanic met Maicon’s cross with a 
precise right-foot shot. Maicon doubled the lead five minutes later as he 
picked up a back-heel pass from Edin Dzeko before tearing into the box and 
beating Orestis Karnezis.

Gervinho added a third in the 63rd minute, a sixth goal in his last seven 
matches, after collecting Kostas Manolas’s cross in the box and firing the ball 
beyond Karnezis. Cyril Théréau pulled one back for Udinese late on.
