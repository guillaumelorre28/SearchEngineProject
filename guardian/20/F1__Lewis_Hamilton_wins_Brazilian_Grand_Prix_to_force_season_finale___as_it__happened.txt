Summary

All Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> needs to do 
in Abu Dhabi in two weeks is take a minimum of third place and he will be 
crowned world champion for the first time. Hamilton must win and hope Rosberg 
finishes in fourth if he is to win his third successive world title.

This could have been so different. Hamilton was struggling to see out of his 
visor at the beginning of the race today, and Rosberg somehow avoided a spin 
and crash on lap 46. But it‚Äôs nicely poised. Join us in two weeks for the 
season finale.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!

Lewis Hamilton wins the Brazilian Grand Prix!

Lap 71: Rosberg in second, so we go to the final race of the season in Abu 
Dhabi! Verstappen comes home to claim a quite remarkable third place. I‚Äôve 
never seen driving like it, especially in these conditions.

‚ÄúShame for Verstappen it‚Äôs unlikely to rain in the last race,‚Äù emails Peter 
van Balen.

Lap 70: Verstappen has taken third. He held the inside line over Perez for 
three corners, and the Mexican eventually yielded. The Brazilian crowd roar. 
They are loving this, especially with Massa out of the race.

Lap 68: Verstappen into fourth! Down the inside of Sainz and three seconds 
behind Perez in third. Three laps to go, three seconds. Absurd driving from the 
19-year-old.

Lap 67: Now Verstappen has overtaken Vettel. First he tries on the outside, 
which Vettel defends, but the German can do nothing about the next corner, 
which Verstappen takes on the inside, forcing Vettel onto the grass.

‚ÄúHe pushed me off the track. I was a little bit ahead with my nose and he 
pushed me.‚Äù

Sour grapes from Vettel, nothing wrong with that. Just fantastic driving.

Lap 64: It looks as though we‚Äôre going to make it to the end of this race at 
71 laps. Still a lot of racing left, and a lot of time for Verstappen to 
continue this charge. Could he make an unlikely podium?

Lap 52: Safety car still out there, here‚Äôs an email from Damon Moffatt. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing it will be dry in Dubai for the final grand prix so cannot see 
Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> so long as his 
car holds up not finishing worse than second. Verstappen seems to be the race 
driver actually able to take on the Mercedes cars though and he could be very 
desirable in the years to come.‚Äù

Lap 51: Some of the Brazilian marshals out on the course are in tears at the 
news of Massa‚Äôs crash. The driver has walked back to the pit lane, where he 
receives a guard of honour from the other teams. Mercedes, Ferrari and all 
among those to hug him, as are his family. The entry to the pit lane is now 
entry, so let‚Äôs hope that nobody comes hurtling down there. There‚Äôs a lot of 
people out there hugging Felipe.

race. The safety car is out once more! Massa is OK, he gets out the crowd and 
waves to the crowd, before holding up a Brazilian flag to the adoring crowd. 
He‚Äôs wet through.

Lap 46: Rosberg half-spins! Ooooooh, he came so close to crashing coming into 
turn 12, but corrects himself and continues down the home straight unhindered. 
That was so nearly a championship defining moment. Caution is the name of the 
game here for Rosberg, he‚Äôd take second at this point, currently 18 seconds 
behind Hamilton, who has no spray to contend with.

Lap 40: It seems the intermediate tyres are working. Massa is the quickest 
driver on the track at present, and Button, also on the intermediates, is going 
well. Hamilton‚Äôs tyres are fading, apparently. He still leads, with Rosberg in 
third.

Lap 38: Verstappen spins coming into the home straight! He slides sideways 
down the tracks, looks destined to hit the barriers, but somehow corrects his 
car, avoids the barriers by a few inches, and continues down the straight 
unhindered. Verstappen did lose speed, and Rosberg comes haring up the inside, 
but Verstappen defends his position at the first corner, to keep the world 
championship leader in third. What defence by the 19-year-old. Amazing save!

Lap 33: Ricciardo takes Sainz to take fifth! The Red Bulls are flying out 
there. Remember power is less of a factor out there, the bravest drivers are 
being rewarded! Ricciardo has a five-second penalty though, remember.

All Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> needs to do 
in Abu Dhabi in two weeks is take a minimum of third place and he will be 
crowned world champion for the first time. Hamilton must win and hope Rosberg 
finishes in fourth if he is to win his third successive world title.

This could have been so different. Hamilton was struggling to see out of his 
visor at the beginning of the race today, and Rosberg somehow avoided a spin 
and crash on lap 46. But it‚Äôs nicely poised. Join us in two weeks for the 
season finale.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!

Lap 70: Verstappen has taken third. He held the inside line over Perez for 
three corners, and the Mexican eventually yielded. The Brazilian crowd roar. 
They are loving this, especially with Massa out of the race.
 
Lap 69: Hamilton still leading this race, Rosberg still second. Eleven seconds

Lap 68: Verstappen into fourth! Down the inside of Sainz and three seconds 
behind Perez in third. Three laps to go, three seconds. Absurd driving from the 
19-year-old.
 
Lap 67: Now Verstappen has overtaken Vettel. First he tries on the outside, 
which Vettel defends, but the German can do nothing about the next corner, 
which Verstappen takes on the inside, forcing Vettel onto the grass.

‚ÄúHe pushed me off the track. I was a little bit ahead with my nose and he 
pushed me.‚Äù

Sour grapes from Vettel, nothing wrong with that. Just fantastic driving. 
 
Lap 66: And you can add Verstappen to that mix, he‚Äôs overtaken Hulkenberg into 
sixth. I‚Äôve never seen driving like this. Racing through those puddles like 
they are nothing.
 
Lap 65: Perez is looking to defend his third position. Sainz in fourth and 
Vettel in fifth bearing down on the Spaniard!
 
Lap 64: It looks as though we‚Äôre going to make it to the end of this race at 
71 laps. Still a lot of racing left, and a lot of time for Verstappen to 
continue this charge. Could he make an unlikely podium?
 
Lap 63: Gutierrez has retired. The Mexican is absolutely furious, flinging his 
gloves to the floor back in the pits. He‚Äôs being released at the end of this 
season, remember.
 
Lap 62: All the action is with Verstappen though, who is now in seventh. The 
talent! The talent!

Lap 60: Hulkenberg takes sixth, with a great move round the outside. Nasr

Lap 57: Verstappen is on the move, up into 11th past Bottas. 
 
Lap 56: We‚Äôre racing again, the safety car is off the track. Hamilton leads, 
with Rosberg just behind! Alonso spins, but recovers. He‚Äôs at the back of the 
field in 17th.
 
Lap 55: Verstappen has pitted to come off the intermediates. They obviously 
expect to see the race go the full distance of 71 laps. He‚Äôs now in 12th, seems 
like a second ago that he was passing Rosberg into second!

Lap 54: Fifty three laps completed. ‚ÄúHow many crashes do they want to see? 
It‚Äôs impossible out here, ‚Äù says Rosberg.

‚ÄúOh man, it‚Äôs like a boat,‚Äù exclaims Verstappen. ‚ÄúWe are just waiting for a 
crash!‚Äù
 
Lap 53: ‚ÄúThe safety car is going so slow that I‚Äôm struggling to keep the 
temperature in these tyres,‚Äù says Hamilton.

Ricciardo has pitted to fit full wets again.
 
Lap 52: Safety car still out there, here‚Äôs an email from Damon Moffatt. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing it will be dry in Dubai for the final grand prix so cannot see 
Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> so long as his 
car holds up not finishing worse than second. Verstappen seems to be the race 
driver actually able to take on the Mercedes cars though and he could be very 
desirable in the years to come.‚Äù
 
Lap 51: Some of the Brazilian marshals out on the course are in tears at the 
news of Massa‚Äôs crash. The driver has walked back to the pit lane, where he 
receives a guard of honour from the other teams. Mercedes, Ferrari and all 
among those to hug him, as are his family. The entry to the pit lane is now 
entry, so let‚Äôs hope that nobody comes hurtling down there. There‚Äôs a lot of 
people out there hugging Felipe.

Lap 50: Remember we‚Äôve got to get to 54 laps for their to be full points 
awarded, and we‚Äôve got about 30 minutes to complete. So it looks as though 
there is going to be full points. Good news for Hamilton.

Lap 49: Massa‚Äôs crash is really going to hurt Hamilton. Hamilton‚Äôs lead of 25 
seconds over Rosberg has been wiped out, as has his 46 second lead over 
Verstappen in fifth.
 
Lap 48: Massa spins out! He‚Äôs crashed in his final race on home soil. That‚Äôs 
terrible for the Brazilian, but what does that mean in the context of this 
race. The safety car is out once more! Massa is OK, he gets out the crowd and 
waves to the crowd, before holding up a Brazilian flag to the adoring crowd. 
He‚Äôs wet through.

Lap 46: Rosberg half-spins! Ooooooh, he came so close to crashing coming into 
turn 12, but corrects himself and continues down the home straight unhindered. 
That was so nearly a championship defining moment. Caution is the name of the 
game here for Rosberg, he‚Äôd take second at this point, currently 18 seconds 
behind Hamilton, who has no spray to contend with.
 
Lap 45: Vettel takes sixth! Nasr fights back, but to no avail!
 
Lap 44: Pit stops for both Red Bull. Verstappen is now on the intermediates, 
and he re-emerges in fifth. Ricciardo does the same, takes his penalty, and 
comes out in 11th.

Meanwhile @danielricciardo <https://twitter.com/danielricciardo> pits on Lap 
41 for inters and to take his 5 second penalty. He returns to the field in P11.

Lap 43: Vettel comes down the inside of Alonso to take seventh! This is 
vintage driving from the German, we haven‚Äôt seen those moves for a while!
 
Lap 42: If Nico comes 3rd today and Lewis first the title will be decided in 
Abu Dhabi correct?‚Äù emails Shivanee Ravi. ‚ÄúAnd in Abu Dhabi if Lewis is first 
and Nico is second the championship goes to nico right?‚Äù

That‚Äôs correct.
 
Lap 41: Heavy rain is expected in five minutes or so ‚Ä¶
 
Lap 40: It seems the intermediate tyres are working. Massa is the quickest 
driver on the track at present, and Button, also on the intermediates, is going 
well. Hamilton‚Äôs tyres are fading, apparently. He still leads, with Rosberg in 
third.
 
Lap 39: ‚ÄúWell saved there Max, says Red Bull‚Äôs Christian Horner. 

‚ÄúYep, heartbeat went a bit higher there,‚Äù replies the driver.

Lap 38: Verstappen spins coming into the home straight! He slides sideways 
down the tracks, looks destined to hit the barriers, but somehow corrects his 
car, avoids the barriers by a few inches, and continues down the straight 
unhindered. Verstappen did lose speed, and Rosberg comes haring up the inside, 
but Verstappen defends his position at the first corner, to keep the world 
championship leader in third. What defence by the 19-year-old. Amazing save!
 
Lap 37: Vettel is on the march! He charges past Ocon on the straight to take 
ninth. Now 1.7 secs to Alonso. Meanwhile Button is changing to the 
intermediates, but even after that change, the Brit is still struggling.

Lap 36: Wehrlein is fading fast: Bottas and Hulkenberg pass him to relegate 
him to 13th place. What a race this is turning out to be.
 
Lap 35: Verstappen records the fastest lap of the race, he‚Äôs getting close to 
within DRS zone behind Hamilton.

Lap 33: Ricciardo takes Sainz to take fifth! The Red Bulls are flying out 
there. Remember power is less of a factor out there, the bravest drivers are 
being rewarded! Ricciardo has a five-second penalty though, remember.
 
Lap 32: And we‚Äôre racing! Hamilton first into the first corner, Rosberg 
second, Verstappen in third. The spray is everywhere! But wait ‚Ä¶ Verstappen 
takes the wide line out of turn three, and out of Hamilton‚Äôs spray, and he 
takes second spot! Wow!
