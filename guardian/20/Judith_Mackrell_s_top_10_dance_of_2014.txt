1. Natalia Osipova: Royal Ballet | Royal Opera House, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2014/oct/14/natalia-osipova-giselle-ballet-video>

The past year has seen Natalia Osipova 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/natalia-osipova> in her latest career role 
as principal with the Royal – and the evolving chemistry between her and the 
company has been compelling to watch.

She was predictably high-powered in Wayne McGregor’s Tetractys 
<http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/tetractys-the-art-of-fugue-by-wayne-mcgregor>
. The extreme lines of his choreography answered to her own exceptional 
suppleness and strength, but she also brought her own high-pitched intensity to 
the work’s mathematical rigour. Less predictable was her affinity to Titania in 
The Dream, which she danced with a witty elegance and true Ashtonian 
sensuousness in her upper body and arms. Her greatest performance, though, had 
to be Giselle. We’d already seen Osipova dance the role with the Bolshoi and 
Mikhailovsky but in the context of the Royal’s more naturalistic dramatic 
style, there was still more detail to see in her interpretation, as she moved 
from frail, emotional peasant girl to gothic ghost. Pulling against the 
choreography’s thistledown prettiness, Osipova’s dancing veered towards the 
ugly and the macabre, her jumps spookily levitating, her body locked into a 
jerky trance. It was the ferocity of her entrance in Act II, a spinning 
fragment of ectoplasm, that inspired Arthur Pita to re-write his work Facada 
for Osipova, as part of theSolo for Two that she staged with Ivan Vasiliev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/07/solo-for-two-review-vasiliev-osipova-ballet>
. Osipova as the blackly comic Bride, knifing the treacherous Vasiliev to 
death, was one of the sights of the summer season.

2. Event: Rambert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/30/rambert-event-review> | Rambert 
building, London

One of great dance experiences of the century was the 2003 Merce Cunningham 
Event at Tate Modern, framed against the sublime installation of Olafur 
Eliasson’s Weather Project.But this year, Rambert came close to matching it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/30/rambert-event-review> with their 
own series of Events set against the giant glowing screen prints of Gerhard 
Richter’s Cage 1-6 series and accompanied by the intricately expressive music 
of Radiohead drummer Philip Selway. With the dancers performing just inches 
away from us, in the company’s South Bank base, the extracts from Cunningham 
repertory felt as through they had been re-minted, for that moment, that space.

3. Ashton programme: Royal Ballet | Royal Opera House, London

Frederick Ashton is key to the repertory and style of the Royal, yet his works 
don’t always get the stage space they deserve. So to some of us thisall-Ashton 
programme was ballet heaven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/20/royal-ballet-frederick-ashton-mixed-programme-royal-opera-house-review>
. It paired the perfectly formed Scènes de Ballet and Symphonic Variations: the 
one cool, taut and mysterious, the other airily sublime – especially when 
danced by the opening cast of Vadim Muntagirov and Marianela Nuñez. Month in 
the Country was just as well served, with Rupert Pennefather finally, and 
triumphantly, back on form as Belaeiv andZenaida Yanowsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/dec/15/dance> a layered and subtly 
histrionic Natalia Petrovna. But the strength of this cast was in the entire 
ensemble – one of those rare instances of collective dance chemistry when you 
feel as if the ballet is being re-invented as you watch.

4. Vertical Influences: Le Patin Libre | Alexandra Palace Ice Rink, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/30/le-patin-libre-vertical-influences-review-ice-dance>

Contemporary dance on skates, was a concept waiting to happen and the 
fabulously fresh and inventive Canadian groupLe Patin Libre were worth the wait 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/30/le-patin-libre-vertical-influences-review-ice-dance>
: a quintet of bearded, dreadlocked, baggy-jeaned dancers who sparked with 
movement ideas that I’d never seen on stage before, let alone on ice. The group 
(four men and one woman) didn’t forget to remind us of their championship level 
skills, pulling off dizzying spins and spiralling arabesques with a fine 
insouciance. But they also pushed into new terrain competing in b-boy head and 
shoulder spins, skittering across the ice in strange staccato moves, and 
wheeling into formations as high and free as flocking birds, ice dancing so 
exhilarating that it spoke to the wannabe skater in us all.

5. Mixed Bill: Mariinsky Ballet | Royal Opera House, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/14/mariinksy-ballet-mixed-programme-review-firebird>

The Mariinsky season was disappointingly lacklustre this year, except for its 
final programme of one-act ballets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/14/mariinksy-ballet-mixed-programme-review-firebird>
. Dancers and orchestra were equally galvanising in the Stravinsky-Fokine 
classic The Firebird; while Uliana Lopatkina was both queenly and ravaged as 
the consumptive heroine of Ashton’s Marguerite and Armand. The wonder of the 
evening, though, was Ratmansky’s Concerto DSCH, the dancers taking flight in 
scintillating cross currents and constellations of movement, and wonderfully 
alert to the choreography’s subtext of dark melancholy and brightly comic 
satire.

6. The Winter’s Tale: Christopher Wheeldon, Royal Ballet | Royal Opera House, 
London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/royal-ballet-winters-tale-review-christopher-wheeldon>

Christopher Wheeldon choreographed a game-changer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/royal-ballet-winters-tale-review-christopher-wheeldon>
 of a work with his brand new setting of The Winter’s Tale. Possibly the first 
ballet version ever of this late Shakespeare play, it made vivid choreographic 
sense of the original text, from the distorted frenzies of jealous Leontes to 
the exhilarating lightness and fantasy of the Bohemia scenes. With a new score 
by Joby Talbot and beautifully imagined designs by Bob Crowley this was ballet 
narrative at a sophisticated high of expression and style.

7. Lest We Forget: English National Ballet | Barbican, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/03/enb-lest-we-forget-review>

In this war-themed mixed bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/03/enb-lest-we-forget-review>, 
Tamara Rojo staked her claim to be ENB’s most intrepid director in years. New 
works were commissioned by Liam Scarlett, Akram Khan and Russell Maliphant, 
which challenged the company’s dancers to go beyond their classical comfort 
zone, and into the grounded, fluid language of contemporary dance. Highlights 
were the intense, winding duet for Alina Cojocaru and Junor Souza in 
Maliphant’s Second Breath and the ferocious pairing of Rojo and Khan in the 
latter’s Dust.

8. See the Music, Hear the Dance | Sadler’s Wells, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/02/see-the-music-hear-the-dance-sadlers-wells-thomas-ades-review>

This programme of four dance works, set the music of Thomas Adès 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/02/see-the-music-hear-the-dance-sadlers-wells-thomas-ades-review>
, was part of the Wells long-term project to focus on contemporary composers. 
As pure music it was superb – a quartet of exhilaratingly varied scores which 
saw Adès either conducting or playing the piano. As choreography it was more 
mixed but the highlight of the evening (a highlight of the whole year) was 
Crystal Pite’s audacious setting of Polaris. The scale of this work was huge: 
64 dancers matched against the orchestral forces of Adès’s score, and Pite 
matched it with exultant skill, her choreography moving in dark shifting 
masses, roiling waves and great scattered configurations. We almost never see 
contemporary dance on this scale – and it was electrifying.

9. Bosque Ardora: Rocío Molina | Barbican, London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/17/rocio-molina-bosque-ardora-review>

The structure and staging of Molina’s first full-scale production owed a lot 
to Pina Bausch, butMolina’s awesome powers as a dancer were all her own 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/17/rocio-molina-bosque-ardora-review>
. As a pure flamenco artist she was as riveting as always: her footwork 
sustained over unfeasible peaks of intensity, her torso curving in passionate 
arcs. But in a work that attempted to channel primitive instinctive forces, 
Molina’s body also inhabited a chameleon range of styles. Shifting from the 
hallucinatory slow motion of butoh, to a loping undulating menagerie of animal 
moves, Molina proved she was far more than a flamenco diva – but one of the

10. A Dream Within a Midsummer Night’s Dream: Ballet Black | Linbury Studio, 
London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/27/ballet-black-review-arthur-pita>

Arthur Pita’s clever, delinquent imagination 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/27/ballet-black-review-arthur-pita> 
was perfectly showcased in this version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, created 
for Ballet Black. While more or less recognisable as Shakespeare’s comedy, 
genders were riotously bent and partners swapped. Puck was a girl in a boy 
scout’s uniform, Helena and Hermia paired off together, so did Oberon and 
Lysander. And while there were tutus and pointe shoes in Pita’s lush 
choreography, the work fizzed with its own surreal spirit of misrule (and with 
a token appearance from Salvador Dalí).
