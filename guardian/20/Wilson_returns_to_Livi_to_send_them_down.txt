Livingstone's expected relegation was confirmed by their 1-0 home defeat 
againstInverness, with the goal scored by former Livi midfielder Barry Wilson. 
That result was enough to saveFalkirk and Dunfermline, but both sides had the 
satisfaction of celebrating their survival with victories.

There was little prospect of Livingston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston> staying up at kick-off as 
they needed to win their final three matches and have one of their rivals lose 
their remaining games. Even that might not have been enough because of their 
poor goal difference. Wilson ended their hopes with a spectacular free-kick in 
the 56th minute, curling the ball past Roddy McKenzie from 20 yards.

Dunfermline were 3-2 winners in an entertaining encounter at Motherwell. An 
impressive Jim Paterson strike after six minutes gave the home side the lead, 
but a wonderful volley from Iain Campbell and a Mark Burchill penalty gave the 
Fifers the interval advantage. Gary Mason's goal shortly after the break put 
the visitors further ahead and they held on despite Stephen Craigan's strike 
for the home side.

Dundee United lost their fifth consecutive game, as first-half goals from Alan 
Gow and Daniel McBreen gave Falkirk a 2-0 win at Tannadice. The visitors 
survived being reduced to 10 men late on when midfielder Patrick Cregg was 
dismissed.

Aberdeen cut the gap to fourth-placed Hibernian to three points and moved 
above Kilmarnock into fifth with a 4-0 success, their biggest home win of the 
season. Stevie Crawford and Steve Lovell gave them a 2-0 half-time lead, 
doubled by strikes from Lovell and Richard Foster.
