Gillingham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gillingham> have sacked their 
manager, Martin Allen, in order to protect "the long-term interests of the 
club".

Allen, who led the club to promotion into League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> last season, had been 
in charge for 15 months â€“ but had won only two of 11 league games this season.

Paul Scally, Gillingham's chairman, told the club's website 
<http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/news/article/martin-allen-leaves-1112310.aspx>
: "It is always a hugely difficult time when a managerial change occurs and 
this moment is no exception. Whilst the decision taken was made unanimously by 
the board, it was an exceptionally difficult one but one which after long 
deliberation was felt absolutely necessary.

"I would like to wish Martin every success in his future career. I have no 
doubt he will be back managing very shortly and I have very much enjoyed the 
experience of working with him, on both a business and personal level over the 
past 16 months."
