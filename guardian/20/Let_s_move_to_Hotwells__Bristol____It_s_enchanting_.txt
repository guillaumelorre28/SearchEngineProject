What’s going for it? The multicoloured terraces of Hotwells, as lurid as 
M&M’s, cling to the hillside like a hipster favela. They have become a symbol 
of the city, reproduced on promotional material and Instagram accounts 
celebrating nu-look Bristol. I hadn’t been to the city for a couple of years 
and, yes, maybe it’s time to believe the hype. Bristol has an energy I’ve never 
seen in the place before, alive with creativity, waistbands bursting with its 
proliferating food and drink scene. Mercifully, it has yet to fall in love with 
itself, the old Bristol of radical politics, Rastafarian culture, rusting boats 
or 60s concrete beside Tudor beams still lurking beneath the fresh paint. In 
enchanting Hotwells, which in a 17th-century form of urban regeneration was 
once a spa to rival Bath, you’ll still find community playgrounds, quiet, 
crumbling lanes tumbling down the slope, proper boozers and snatches of weedy 
space un-built-upon-by-property-developers. Long may it last (but, miseryguts, 
I doubt it will).

The case against I hope you have good brakes/a good clutch and are deft at 
reversing backwards up a hill and round corners; narrow lanes and ratruns. 
Hotwell Road is busier than the M5.

Well connected? A half-hour walk from Bristol Temple Meads, 15 minutes from 
the centre, five minutes from the Avon. Driving: only if you have to. Bring 
stout thighs and titanium calves.

Schools Primaries: Hotwells <http://www.hotwells.bristol.sch.uk/> is 
“outstanding”, says Ofsted, with nearbySt George C of E 
<http://www.st-george-pri.bristol.sch.uk/> and Christ Church C of E 
<http://www.christchurch.bristol.sch.uk/website> “good”. Secondaries: 
independents like Clifton College and Bristol Grammar dominate locally, so it’s 
a walk to the “outstanding”Bristol Cathedral Choir School 
<http://bccs.bristol.sch.uk/>, the “outstanding” Cotham School 
<http://www.cotham.bristol.sch.uk/> or across the Avon to the “good” Ashton Park

Pete Dalby “Ten-minute ferry ride into the city; 15-minute walk to fabulous 
countryside; colourful dockside pubs like the Nova Scotia; Brunel’s Bridge and 
a ship on the doorstep. ”

Ann-Marie James “The army surplus-style store Marcruss Outdoor – everything 
you need for serious camping trips. Pet hate: the ugly flyover.”
