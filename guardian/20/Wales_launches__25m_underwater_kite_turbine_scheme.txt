A unique renewable energy scheme involving underwater “kite-turbines” is being 
launched off the coast of northWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>.

As part of the £25m project <http://minesto.com/holyhead-deep-10mw/>, 20 
turbines will be anchored off Anglesey and when fully operational should 
generate enough electricity to power 8,000 homes.

Initially 30 jobs will be created but if the system works well, the Swedish 
company behind it, Minesto, believes hundreds more could follow.

The Welsh government is keen to promote wave and tidal energy and find ways of 
bringing skilled jobs to places like Anglesey.

Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said: “This will not only help create 
greener and more efficient sources of energy, but will also create jobs and 
vital opportunities for growth in north Wales.”

Minesto has been testing the kite turbine system in Strangford Loch in 
Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/02/underwater-kite-turbine-green-electricity>
. It has chosen for the permanent Welsh site a southern corner of a stretch of 
water called Holyhead Deep.

Weighing seven tonnes and operating at least 15 metres below the water 
surface, each kite carries a turbine below it. The kite is tethered by a cable 
to the sea floor and then “flies” in the tidal stream. It swoops round in a 
figure-of-eight shape to increase the speed of the water flowing through the 
turbine.

This means the kite can generate renewable electricity in tidal streams that 
would be too slow to drive the first-generation tidal devices, the company said.

The site has been chosen to maintain separation from shipping lanes and to 
minimise impact on other sea users.
