Real have now announced the 27-year-old will undergo surgery in London next 
Tuesday. The European champions have not said how long they expect Bale to be 
sidelined, but reports in Spain suggest he could be out for up to three months.

A Madrid statement read: “Real Madrid’s medical services have decided that 
Gareth Bale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gareth-bale> will undergo 
surgery as a result of the peroneal tendon injury in his right ankle.

“This operation will take place at the King Edward VII Hospital in London on 
Tuesday 29 November by Dr James Calder, under the supervision of the club 
doctors Jesus Olmo and Mikel Aramberri.”

Bale now seems certain to be sidelined for the remainder of 2016 at the very 
least, meaning he will miss El Clásico against Barcelona on 3 December and the 
Champions League showdown against Borussia Dortmund four days later, which Real 
need to win to finish top of Group F ahead of the German side.

Bale, who has struggled with various injuries during his time in Spain, is 
also set to sit out the Fifa Club World Cup, which takes place in Japan on 
8-18 December.

Wales’s next scheduled match is the World Cup qualifier against the Republic 
of Ireland on 24 March. Real are four points clear at the top of La Liga and 
host Sporting Gijon this weekend.
