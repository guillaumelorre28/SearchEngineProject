Thanks for your questions guys. Leave your desks. Run out into the sun! Defy 
your bosses. And remember. England is never this sunny. Ever. So enjoy it, 
cats. Go and listen to some Oasis in a park and think of me.

Matt.

And, as promised, here’s that face illustration he mentioned earlier on

Wear bright socks. True. Although I am sockless today. Be bold, man, be bold 
this day. Don't give up ever. And don't let the bastards grind you down.

How important is your collaboration with the playwright? From my 
understanding, Anthony Neilson has let the actors have a lot of input into 
Unreachable. How has this experience differed from your previous 
roles/interactions with playwrights?

Really important. It's the nexus of the play. And I was always a fan of 
Anthony's work. So was intrigued to experience his process and I hope together 
with the rest of the cast and Anthony we've created something unique and unlike 
anything else.

After the craziness of last football season and all the changes leading into 
the new season (José at United, etc), who is your pick to win the league?

Good question. It's so tough. At this stage who knows? Because Leicester won 
it last year. So it truly means anyone can have a go. BUT United will be 
stronger for sure. So will Chelsea. So will City. I'd probably go for one of 
those three. But I hope it's someone other than then. I think it's good for 
football and the Premier League when it's outside the top four. Go Leicester!

"I think a Lady Doctor could be close"

Well, she has a chance. I think a Lady Doctor could be close. And would be 
fun. So practise, practise, practise. And talk really fast. And think really 
fast. And be really brave. And mad. And silly. And good luck maybe it will be 
you!

I don't! They seep out of my ears. And you have to just take a leap of faith, 
a risk of madness... there's failure and you have got to say, screw you 
failure, I'm here for the truth not for success!

Which play that you have either seen/read/taken part in has influenced you the 
most and why?

Great question Cerys. I love Noises Off when I was young. That Face was really 
important for me. American Pyscho was pretty groovy. Unreachable cos it's 
mental and I'm in it at the moment. And Simon Stephens. On the Shore of the 
Wide World ... just because the rhythm and tone of his writing is so 
attractive. And he took a risk on me. The Royal Court generally because that's 
where I started. I think it's really important to support new writing and new 
writers.

Having no script. Not knowing what was happening. But by the same token those

No, absolutely not. I'm very grateful for everything Doctor Who has done for 
me. It's opened more doors than it's closed. Like everything it's a process of 
time. In ten years, hopefully, I'll be known for something else.

Sadly not. At least none that I know about. Maybe they will reveal themselves 
to me and I will secretly turn out to be the best trapeze artist in North 
London. Or secretly I'll turn out to be able to eat the most sausages in a day. 
Or secretly I'll be the new Keith Jarrett.

Thanks for your questions guys. Leave your desks. Run out into the sun! Defy 
your bosses. And remember. England is never this sunny. Ever. So enjoy it, 
cats. Go and listen to some Oasis in a park and think of me.

Matt.

How important is your collaboration with the playwright? From my 
understanding, Anthony Neilson has let the actors have a lot of input into 
Unreachable. How has this experience differed from your previous 
roles/interactions with playwrights?

Really important. It's the nexus of the play. And I was always a fan of 
Anthony's work. So was intrigued to experience his process and I hope together 
with the rest of the cast and Anthony we've created something unique and unlike 
anything else.

After the craziness of last football season and all the changes leading into 
the new season (José at United, etc), who is your pick to win the league?

Good question. It's so tough. At this stage who knows? Because Leicester won 
it last year. So it truly means anyone can have a go. BUT United will be 
stronger for sure. So will Chelsea. So will City. I'd probably go for one of 
those three. But I hope it's someone other than then. I think it's good for 
football and the Premier League when it's outside the top four. Go Leicester!

Well, she has a chance. I think a Lady Doctor could be close. And would be

Great question Cerys. I love Noises Off when I was young. That Face was really 
important for me. American Pyscho was pretty groovy. Unreachable cos it's 
mental and I'm in it at the moment. And Simon Stephens. On the Shore of the 
Wide World ... just because the rhythm and tone of his writing is so 
attractive. And he took a risk on me. The Royal Court generally because that's 
where I started. I think it's really important to support new writing and new 
writers.

Having no script. Not knowing what was happening. But by the same token those 
challenges are what define the tone and nature of the piece. So it's a catch 
22. But somehow a good one I hope.

No, absolutely not. I'm very grateful for everything Doctor Who has done for
