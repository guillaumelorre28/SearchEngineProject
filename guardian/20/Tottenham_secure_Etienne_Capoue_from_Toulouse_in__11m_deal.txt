Tottenham Hotspur <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> 
have agreed an €11m deal for the holding midfielder Etienne Capoue of Toulouse 
subject to a medical, with the fee standing to rise to €13m on 
performance-related targets.

The 25-year-old, who has been capped six times by France, will encounter 
strong competition for a starting place in midfield from Sandro and Paulinho, 
the £17m summer signing from Corinthians, but he is certain that he will play a 
satisfactory number of games.

Sandro, who suffered a serious knee injury in January that end his season 
early, has not yet featured in pre-season. The club are taking no chances with 
his comeback programme. Sandro has trained with the first-team squad but it is 
unclear whether he will be ready for the opening match of the season at Crystal 
Palace on Sunday week. There is no inclination to rush him for fear of him 
picking up a muscle strain.

Capoue will provide the manager André Villas-Boas with another option and the 
midfielder has chosen Tottenham in preference to Cardiff City and Atlético 
Madrid. He has previously been followed by Arsenal and he is determined to 
impress at Tottenham to advance his claim for inclusion in Didier Deschamps' 
France squad at the World Cup finals.

Capoue is expected to be in the crowd at White Hart Lane on Saturday for 
Tottenham's final pre-season fixture against Espanyol. Paulinho is in line to 
play his first football for the club, as is the striker Roberto Soldado, who 
has joined from Valencia for £26m.
