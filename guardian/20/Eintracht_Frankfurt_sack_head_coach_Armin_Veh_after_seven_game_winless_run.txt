Eintracht Frankfurt <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eintrachtfrankfurt> 
have sacked their head coach, Armin Veh, after less than a season in charge 
following a seven-match winless run which saw them slip into the relegation 
zone.

Veh, who led Stuttgart to the 2007 Bundesliga title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/21/europeanfootball.schalke>, 
had taken over in July on a two-year contract. A 1-1 draw against mid-table 
Ingolstadt on Saturday compounded Frankfurt’s woes. “Parting ways was very 
difficult for us because Armin Veh had our faith until now,” said the club CEO, 
Heribert Bruchhagen, in a brief statement. “But we wanted to give the team with 
this change of coach an important impulse because we want to be successful in 
our relegation battle.”

The assistant coach, Reiner Geyer, will take over on an interim basis, with 
the club determined to find a successor quickly.

Frankfurt have managed only two wins in their past 15 league games after a 
promising start and are now in the relegation play-off spot, three points ahead 
of 17th-placed Hoffenheim.
