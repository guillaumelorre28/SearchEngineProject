Martin Thorpe, who worked on the Guardian sports desk from 1986 until 2002, 
has died after a brief illness. He was rediagnosed with cancer earlier this 
year and passed away at home in Rottingdean, Sussex, on Tuesday. He was 62.

Thorpe, a Scunthorpe United fan who maintained links with the supporters’ club 
in London, began his career with National RockStar in the mid-70s and found his 
way to The Times as a casual sub-editor and then Eddy Shah’s Today, where he 
worked on the launch until moving on to the Guardian soon after. He began as a 
casual sub, finished up as chief sub and ended his Guardian days as a football 
reporter, his high-water mark being providing the match coverage ofManchester 
United’s injury-time European Cup win against Bayern Munich at Camp Nou in 1999

Thorpe took redundancy in 2002 and went into the property-development business 
but returned briefly 10 years later before moving on to the Independent and 
Independent on Sunday, where he worked until their closures in March.

He leaves three sons: James, Sam and Luka.
