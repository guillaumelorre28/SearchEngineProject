Defeat to Bolton in a match overshadowed by Fabrice Muamba's heart scare and 
then to Manchester United on a night when the champions took a big step toward 
holding on to their crown has somewhat masked Blackburn's loss of form in 
recent weeks. Steve Kean's side are now back in the relegation zone on goal 
difference and need their creative talents, most notably top-scorer Yakubu, to 
turn good displays into points.West Bromwich Albion

four games, could well prove to be pushovers.Sachin Nakrani
