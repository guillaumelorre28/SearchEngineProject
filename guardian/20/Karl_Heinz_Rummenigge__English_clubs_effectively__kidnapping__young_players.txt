Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has accused English clubs of effectively “kidnapping” 
young players from overseas. Bayern are due to open the doors on a new youth 
academy in the north of Munich next summer, and the club chairman has declared 
he would have “moral reservations” about filling it with preteens from other 
countries.

“We don’t want to bring some 10 or 11-year-old to Munich like the English do,” 
he said in comments published in the club’s magazine. “You could almost speak 
of kidnapping with them and I would have moral reservations about that.”

If English football is short of coaches, why are badges cheaper in Germany?

Rummenigge still hopes to lure the best local talent to the record champions, 
from the age of 14 upwards, with the focus on youngsters in and around Bavaria. 
“Our priority will certainly be Germany and Bavaria,” he said. “Our future 
talented players will much rather come from Rosenheim than Rio.”

Bayern have enjoyed a great deal of success in recent years with a blend of 
big-name signings and homegrown talent. Philipp Lahm, Thomas Müller and Bastian 
Schweinsteiger all hail from Bavaria and have graduated into key first-team 
players.

Rummenigge hopes the new academy will ensure that local talent continues to 
prosper after suggesting Bayern had “lost a bit of ground, nationally and 
internationally” in that area.
