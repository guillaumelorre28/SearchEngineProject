Button, 36, is out of contract with McLaren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mclaren> at the end of the season, but the 
British team have already announced they will not make a decision on their 
driver pairing for 2017 until September at the earliest.

Fernando Alonso has one more year to run on his current deal, while the 
reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne is waiting in the wings should McLaren end 
their seven-season relationship with Button.

It is understood that Williams would be prepared to prolong Button’s career 
into an 18th successive campaign withthe 2009 world champion

 returning to the team with whom he started his grand prix career.

Williams’ deputy team principal, Claire Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/williams>, said: “We will own our driver 
lineup decision, and I am not sat here waiting for [McLaren chairman] Ron 
Dennis to make his decision or for Jenson to make his decision.

“It it is not about what other people are doing. I am not going to be waiting 
around because that is just not the right mentality for a team like ours to 
have.

“It would be a great story, but he has to make the right choice for him, and 
we have to make the right choice for the team.”

Felipe Massa’s expected departure from Williams at the end of the season will 
free up some money, but doubts remain as to whether they will be able to afford 
Button who earns around £12m a year.

Button’s commercial appeal however, will also be seen as a huge attraction to 
Williams as they pursue sponsorship for 2017. “He started his career here, but 
more importantly Jenson is a great driver, and he has still got a lot of fight 
left in him,” Williams added.

“He is a great talent in the car, but also outside of the car and we need a 
driver like him. That is not to say our focus is purely on Jenson.

“When I talk about the criteria that we are looking at, it is the talent in 
the cockpit, the intelligence to feed back to the engineers, and for us, as an 
independent team, the commercial factors are going to play a part in the 
decision-making process too. You can’t have an unknown driver in your car. It 
is just not going to work.”

A move back to Williams could see Button link up with Valtteri Bottas, who 
they want to retain for a fifth successive season.

But another driver mooted to join is Force India’s Sergio Pérez. The Mexican, 
who has delivered a number of impressive displays this season, is also backed 
by Carlos Slim, one of the world’s richest men, and would bring a wealth of 
money to the British team.

“Sergio has done a great job this year, he is an intelligent driver, and of 
course he is going to be someone we are looking at,” Williams, who added that 
an announcement on their lineup for 2017 will not be made until the latter part 
of the campaign, said.

“I have only met him briefly on the odd occasion. He is very charming. He is 
very eloquent, so commercially he would be strong for any team. Of course he is 
going to be someone you’d consider if he is available.”
