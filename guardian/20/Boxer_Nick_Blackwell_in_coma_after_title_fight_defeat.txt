The British boxer Nick Blackwell is in an induced coma after suffering a bleed 
on the brain following a domestic title fight defeat on Saturday night.

The referee stopped the largely one-sided fight against Chris Eubank Jr in the 
10th round after Blackwell, who had taken heavy punishment in most rounds, was 
deemed unable to continue by a doctor, due to swelling over his left eye.

Shortly after the bout, for Blackwell’s British middleweight title, which was 
televised live on Channel 5, the 25-year-old, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, 
collapsed and had to be taken out of the ring on a stretcher with oxygen.

The British Boxing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Board of Control 
(BBBC) general secretary, Robert Smith, said: “I spoke to one of the doctors 
this morning and he said there is a bleeding of the brain.

“He’s in intensive care, he’s in an induced coma and he is resting and being 
looked after by the experts.

“It’s a very normal procedure. They put you in a coma to get the swelling to 
go down. There’s no timescale. Now it’s just a matter of waiting and seeing.”

Press Association Sport quoted a source close to the Blackwell team as saying 
the boxer was stable and there was no swelling overnight.

Peter Fury, the trainer and uncle of the world heavyweight champion Tyson 
Fury, tweeted <https://twitter.com/peterfury/status/714039152942129152> that he 
had spoken to Blackwell’s promoter Mick Hennessy and that the prospects of 
recovery were encouraging. A tweet from Hennessy Sports said:

The BBC said on Sunday that surgeons were not planning to operate on Blackwell.

After the fight, Eubank said: “I was hitting him with some big shots and the 
referee saw fit to let the fight go on. Looking back now, maybe he should have 
stopped it earlier.”


On Sunday, he paid tribute to his opponent’s courage and wished him a speedy 
recovery. He tweeted:

Eubank’s father, Chris Eubank Sr, who was in his son’s corner for the bout, 
said the incident brought back painful memories of his world title fightwith 
Michael Watson in 1991 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/sep/22/boxing.comment1>, which left his 
opponent with severe brain injuries.

Watson nearly died as a result of injuries sustained in the fight and the 
incident forced the BBBC to boost safety at bouts to ensure that boxers who 
suffer such injuries get speedy assistance, including oxygen. Eubank Sr said he 
was banging on the canvas during the Blackwell fight urging the referee to stop 
it. At one point, he could be heard on television telling his son in the corner 
in between rounds: “If he [the referee] doesn’t stop it, and you keep beating 
him like this … he’s getting hurt.”


A number of British boxers, past and present, have tweeted their support for 
Blackwell, including Fury, who accompanied Blackwell into the ring on Saturday 
night.

I hope he comes out of this ok. We've been in the gym sparring together the 
past month and he's a truly one of the sports great guys.
