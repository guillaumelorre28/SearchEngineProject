This year’s Shakespeare celebrations continue with the 2016 Globe On Screen 
<http://onscreen.shakespearesglobe.com/> series, which gets underway on 6 May. 

The series opens with Measure for Measure, directed by Dominic Dromgoole, 
which played to sell-out crowds at Shakespeare’s Globe in 2015.

Measure for Measure 
<http://onscreen.shakespearesglobe.com/productions/measure-for-measure/> is 
Shakespeare’s most searching exploration of sexual politics and social 
injustice. This production stars Mariah Gale and Dominic Rowan.

The Globe On Screen series continues with The Merchant of Venice from the 10 
June and Richard II from the 24 June.

We have five pairs of tickets to Measure for Measure to give away. Our draw 
closes on 10 May. You can see the full list of participating cinemashere
