The Köln striker Lukas Podolski is "very interested" in moving to Arsenal, 
according to his international team-mate Per Mertesacker. Podolski has been 
strongly linked with a move to Arsenal,who have been heavily reliant on Robin 
van Persie for goals this season

The 26-year-old, who can operate as a lone striker or on the wing, has scored 
16 goals in the Bundesliga this season and has been a part of the Germany 
national squad for the past eight years.

Now Mertesacker, whom Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
signed from Werder Bremen last summer, has revealed his friend has contacted 
him regarding a move and claims the striker is keen on joining Arsène Wenger's 
squad.

"He has been very interested in the past few weeks and has sent me a number of 
text messages," Mertesacker told Sky. "I've told him that this is a great place 
to work and that Arsenal are an amazing club. Nothing has been agreed on yet, 
though, and Lukas hasn't given me a ring yet."

Podolski, who was born in Poland, recently refused to comment on speculation 
linking him with Arsenal, but theKöln 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cologne> manager Stale Solbakken admitted 
last month that he may lose his star striker this summer.
