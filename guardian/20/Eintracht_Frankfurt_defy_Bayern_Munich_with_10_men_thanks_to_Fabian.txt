Bayern Munich twice surrendered the lead in a 2-2 Bundesliga draw at 10-man 
Eintracht Frankfurt <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eintrachtfrankfurt> 
on Saturday.

Arjen Robben gave the Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> leaders an 
11th-minute lead at Eintracht but the hosts levelled two minutes before 
half-time when Szabolcs Huszti fired past Manuel Neuer for his team’s first 
goal against the Bavarians since 2011.

Joshua Kimmich put Bayern back in front from a corner in the 62nd minute and 
the hosts were in more trouble when Huszti was sent off for a second yellow 
card. But Frankfurt levelled in the 78th minute when Marco Fabian turned in 
Timothy Chandler’s cross shot with his chest as a frustrated Bayern, who won 
their first five games of the season, drew for the second match in a row.

Anthony Modeste, the league’s leading marksman, scored two more goals to give 
Köln a 2-1 win over basement side Ingolstadt, taking his tally to seven and 
lifting his team into to second place, two points behind Bayern.
