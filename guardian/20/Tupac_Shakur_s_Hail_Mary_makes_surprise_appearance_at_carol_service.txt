A Christmas carol service in Sri Lanka surprised churchgoers by mistakenly 
supplying the lyrics to theTupac Shakur <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2pac>
 song, Hail Mary, instead of those of the traditional Christian prayer.

Pictures of the programme from Joy to the World 2016, one of Sri Lanka’s 
largest carol services, were shared widely across social media over theChristmas
 <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> weekend.

It lists the opening lyrics to the Hail Mary, a 1,000-year old prayer based on 
passages from the Gospel of Luke, as: “Makaveli in this … Killuminati, all 
through your body. The blows like a twelve-gauge shotty.”

The lyrics are in fact those of a 1997 track 
<http://genius.com/2pac-hail-mary-lyrics> by the rapper Tupac Shakur.

Both renditions ask Mary, venerated as the mother of Jesus, to intercede on 
behalf of sinners, though Tupac’s version is more exhaustive in detailing the 
exact sins in question, including murder and drug-dealing.

The pictures were taken by Andrew Choksy, a Colombo man who attended the 
service. “A lot of people around us were in shock as to whether it was a joke, 
or if someone would actually rap the song,” he said.

“A few of the older ladies in front of us could not stop looking at the 
printed booklet.” He said he sent the pictures of the programme to friends, 
from where they spread and eventually found their way online.

“No explanation was given [by organisers] at all,” he said. “They didn’t 
acknowledge it at the venue. To be honest, I don’t think many people saw the 
booklet at all. The people that realised were shocked at first but then took it 
in good humour around me,” he said.

“To be honest, I was bursting inside.”
