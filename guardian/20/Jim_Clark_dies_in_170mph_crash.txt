Hockenheim, West Germany, April 7

Jim Clark, the former world motor racing champion was killed when his 
Lotus-Cosworth skidded off the track and somersaulted into a wood at about 
170mph during a Formula Two race here today. The car had emerged form the 
Shrimps Head curve and was racing down the straight when the accident happened.

"Suddenly Jim's car broke out," said Chris Irwin, another British entry, who 
was driving about 250 yards behind. "It looked like something mechanical."

Clark's two sponsors, Ford and Lotus, both wanted him for today's races. Lotus 
decreed that he should start in the Formula Two event in Hockenheim; Ford 
wanted him to drive its new sports car at Brands Hatch. Lotus won.

First race

It was Clarke's first race on the Hockenheim circuit which still showed wet 
patches from a morning shower when the race started. Just before the crash 
Clark had been lying eighth and was evidently unhappy, according to a race 
official.

The rear wheels failed to hold the road as he came out of the bend on the 
sixth lap. Clark fought to keep the car on the road as it weaved 500 yards 
along the track and grass safety strip. A policeman said the car somersaulted 
three or four times before smashing broadside into the trees.

Clark's body is being flown home to Scotland today. It is expected the funeral 
will take place on Wednesday.

Clark, a Scottish farmer of 32, was world champion in 1963 and 1965 and winner 
of a record 25 Grand Prix races.

Jean-Pierre Belloise of France driving a Malra, won today's race, judged on 
two heats of 20 laps over the 4.1 miles circuit.
