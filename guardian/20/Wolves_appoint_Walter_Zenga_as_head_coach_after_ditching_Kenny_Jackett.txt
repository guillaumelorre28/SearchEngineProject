“Walter is a hugely passionate personality who lives for football and is 
fiercely determined to succeed in everything that he does. We are looking 
forward to working with him, and supporting him in the shared aim of trying to 
help Wolves achieve promotion back to the Premier League.”

Zenga, who has previously managed Steaua Bucharest, Red Star Belgrade and 
Palermo, takes his first coaching role in England. His most recent managerial 
post was in the United Arab Emirates with Al Shaab but he left by mutual 
consent in February.

The 56-year-old former Italy goalkeeper, capped 58 times by his country, will 
be in attendance at Wolves’ pre-season friendly on Saturday against Swansea 
City but will formally take charge of his new side on Monday. As a player Zenga 
spent 13 seasons at Internazionale before joining Sampdoria in 1994.

A statement released at 11pm BST on Friday night said that Shi had made the 
decisionto relieve Jackett of his duties

sincerely thank Kenny for everything he’s done for Wolves over the last three 
years. He’s shown true professionalism during his tenure and over the course of 
the transition to new ownership. I would like to wish him all the very best for 
the future.”

The takeover of Wanderers by the group fronted by Shi, Fosun International, 
was completed last week and Jackett’s firing came four days after the club said 
that his position was not under threat. At a press conference on Monday, Shi 
said that Jackett would have “an opportunity to bring success” to the club, who 
finished 14th in the Championship last season.

“We share the same opinions. I think the squad is too small but I’m trying to 
give him all the support I can,” said the new Wolves director, who also said 
that he and Jackett were in discussions over bolstering the first-team squad.

Helder Costa, the Benfica winger, agreed to join the club on a season-long 
loan deal on Friday and the Wolves owners Fosun have promised more investment 
in the squad. The goalkeeper Andy Lonergan is the club’s only permanent signing 
so far this summer.

“We have said we will invest between £20m and £30m over the next two years,” 
said Shi. “That is a necessity and if necessary we can put more money in.

“The most important thing is getting the right players in the right position 
to help the club. I do not think money is a problem for us.”
