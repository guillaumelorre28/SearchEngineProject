Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> showed no signs of letting 
up at the top of the Bundesliga in swatting aside Werder Bremen in a 
bad-tempered match that threatened to get out of hand.

Werder were undone by three goals from counterattacks and a David Alaba 
free-kick but did enough to rile the visitors to the point that defender Jérôme 
Boateng, one of six players booked, became involved in an argument with a ball 
boy. The runaway leaders, who have 64 points from 25 games, are now 14 clear of 
second-placed Wolfsburg who host Freiburg on Sunday afternoon.

Bayern, who have scored 34 goals in their last eight games in all competitions 
and thumped Werder 6-0 earlier in the season, went ahead in the 24th minute 
when Thomas Müller curled the ball in from the edge of the area following a 
break. Despite missing Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben through injury, the 
leaders were as clinical as ever and Alaba chipped in a free-kick in the last 
minute of the first half to make it 2-0.

Werder had a goal disallowed for handball in the second half and the game 
turned ugly with several late tackles and heated exchanges between the players. 
Almost inevitably Werder were caught on the break when Lewandowski grabbed two 
goals in the final quarter of an hour, both set up by Müller after lightning 
attacks.

two tracksuited staff members filled up the tank, but managed to arrive on time 
for the match.
