Post-match thoughts

That was an exercise in existentialism that has robbed me of any thoughts. 
Thanks for sticking with me, if you did stick with me. I hope your day gets 
better. I really do. There’ll be a match report here shortly. I feel for 
whoever had to write it. In the meantime see if there’s anything more exciting 
on offer in the 3pm games.

Full-time: Middlesbrough 0-0 Leicester

Nope. Gray floats it in and, after a loose clearance, Ulloa heads at Guzan. 
And that is that. Ninety-five minutes of nothingness is over.

Still 90+5 min: Ulloa wallops a shot at goal that is blocked and the ball 
breaks to Musa, who is fouled by Ramirez. A free-kick 25 yards out on the left. 
Can Leicester salvage anything from this dog’s dinner of a game?

90+2 min: In the buildup to that effort by Ulloa, Clayton was booked for what 
must have been his 112th foul. Bobby Madley spotted one at last.

90+1 min: A decent break by Leicester results in Albrighton finding Ulloa’s

88 min: A series of about 72 sterile Boro passes ends when Fabio hoiks the 
ball across the Riverside towards Friend on the left and out for a goal-kick. 
Yup. Leadbitter is on for Forshaw.

85 min: Boro have had 63% possession but created next to nothing. They look 
solid, of course, but they’ll need to start scoring soon to make sure they 
avoid being dragged into the filthy business of a relegation scrap.

81 min: Fabio plays a lazy cross into the box that kicks up in front of Morgan 
forcing him to head poorly into the path of Ramirez. He’s eight yards out and 
should score but drags his left-footed shot a foot wide of the right-hand post. 
That, like this game, was abysmal. Ramirez is such a classy player too. Maybe 
it was the lactic acid.

79 min: Traore and his lack of an end product are replaced by Stewart Downing,

Traore to cling to as he skulks off to the bench.

74 min: A corner for Boro. A clearance by Leicester. Boro are completely in 
control but Leicester’s defence has hardly been ruffled all game. And I’m not 
sure Rudy Gestede is what this Boro team needs. They need someone who can run.

70 min: And then Forshaw has an equally fine chance to score for Boro 
following a beautiful arcing cross from the left from Friend that bends in 
invitingly and begs the Boro player to nod it home. Instead he reels in his 
neck and lets it skim off him and fall harmlessly down to Schmeichel.

69 min: Leicester go close to taking the lead after winning a corner after a 
rare break. The ball is whipped into Ulloa, who can only connect with his 
shoulder from six yards to send the ball dribbling into Guzan’s arms.

67 min: Friend bundles his way in from the left flank and then drops his 
shoulder beautifully to send Simpson the wrong way. He sees a sight of goal and 
tries to bend it into the top corner but can’t get his foot round it. His shot, 
like this game, is an unlovely sight.

65 min: Boro are still very much on top here but with Negredo misreading the 
few crosses that have come his way the home side just don’t look like scoring. 
Leicester are choosing to do nothing.

64 min: There’s a huge roar as Friend and Ulloa clatter into one another in 
the kind of hefty 50-50 tackle not seen in the top-flight since Lee 
Cattermole’s hip injury some months ago. That’s how good this game is.

62 min: Friend rolls a lovely ball into the corridor of uncertainty but 
Negredo, never one to look like he’s in much of a hurry, does a fine impression 
of Ulloa a minute or two earlier and watches it drift across goal.

57 min: Fabio decides to inject a bit of dangerous fun into the game and chips 
over an approaching Leicester player to Traore not far outside his own box. 
Traore makes a meal of controlling it and Leicester win the ball back much to 
Karanka’s chagrin.

54 min: Mahrez slides the ball down the left-channel to King who, on the 
overlap, pings a dangerous ball across the six-yard box that Guzan can’t reach. 
It needs a poacher to gamble on it. But Leicester don’t have one of those on 
the pitch today. Both Ulloa and Okazaki hang back and pass up the chance to put 
their team 1-0 up.

52 min: Leicester are absorbing Boro’s pressure comfortably but when they look 
primed to break they are sorely lacking Vardy’s pace in attack. When Mahrez 
gathers the ball he has no one who can break out of a enthusiastic jog ahead of 
him.

50 min: Traore does a dance and fools no one before hitting the ball against 
Fuchs. He’s attracting two players over to him now, though. It could be that a 
switch of play over to the left could undo Leicester if Ranieri’s side become 
too fixated on Traore’s threatening pace.

into the box is cleared at the near post.

47 min: Boro enjoy a good spell of possession and Friend and Ramirez combine 
well to work the ball down the left flank and then into midfield, where the 
ball is popped out to Traore. He beats Fuchs for pace (of course) and drifts a 
better ball into the box. Leicester head it clear and Friend clatters a low 
shot at goal that Schmeichel gathers into his chest.

45 min: It’s the second half. Leicester win a throw-in on the left. Fuchs  
Rory Delapshurls it into the box but Boro clear.

If anything good is going to happen in this game it will be as a consequence 
of something Traore or Mahrez does. For all the lactic acid-affected huff and 
puff on display among many of the players, those two are the brightest by far.

They’re showing a collection of Adama Traore highlights and lowlights. When he 
beats a man he is so jaw-droppingly quick he gives himself almost too much time 
to consider his cross. If he had just half a yard he’d have a marker to bend 
the ball around. He’s actually too fast. If he ever slows down, he’ll be very, 
very good.
Henrik Asbjørnsen (@henrik2a) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Adama really is one of 
those rare breed one trick ponies. Strength, speed and 1v1 👍. Everything else 
is👖

38 min: Leicester hoik a long ball forwards. Okazaki takes a wonderful touch 
and slips Mahrez in down the right channel. He looks primed to strike at goal 
but Fabio, who has been very impressive so far, slides in brilliantly and hooks 
the ball away from the Algerian. That was a fantastic tackle.

That was an exercise in existentialism that has robbed me of any thoughts. 
Thanks for sticking with me, if you did stick with me. I hope your day gets 
better. I really do. There’ll be a match report here shortly. I feel for 
whoever had to write it. In the meantime see if there’s anything more exciting 
on offer in the 3pm games.

Nope. Gray floats it in and, after a loose clearance, Ulloa heads at Guzan. 
And that is that. Ninety-five minutes of nothingness is over.
 
Still 90+5 min: Ulloa wallops a shot at goal that is blocked and the ball 
breaks to Musa, who is fouled by Ramirez. A free-kick 25 yards out on the left. 
Can Leicester salvage anything from this dog’s dinner of a game?
 
90+5 min: Fabio whips a ball in to Downing. You guess whether anything 
happened next.
 
90+4 min: I agree with this.

90+2 min: In the buildup to that effort by Ulloa, Clayton was booked for what 
must have been his 112th foul. Bobby Madley spotted one at last.
 
90+1 min: A decent break by Leicester results in Albrighton finding Ulloa’s 
forehead and the ball finding the roof of the net.
 
90 min: Some wicked deviant has decided that there will be five more minutes 
of this.
 
88 min: A series of about 72 sterile Boro passes ends when Fabio hoiks the 
ball across the Riverside towards Friend on the left and out for a goal-kick. 
Yup. Leadbitter is on for Forshaw.
 
85 min: Boro have had 63% possession but created next to nothing. They look 
solid, of course, but they’ll need to start scoring soon to make sure they 
avoid being dragged into the filthy business of a relegation scrap.
 
84 min: Mendy’s day is over. I remember him fouling someone but doing little 
else. He’s replaced by Albrighton.
 
81 min: Fabio plays a lazy cross into the box that kicks up in front of Morgan 
forcing him to head poorly into the path of Ramirez. He’s eight yards out and 
should score but drags his left-footed shot a foot wide of the right-hand post. 
That, like this game, was abysmal. Ramirez is such a classy player too. Maybe 
it was the lactic acid.
 
80 min: Leicester have a rare attack. It comes to nowt but that’s the first 
they have had in a long while.
 
79 min: Traore and his lack of an end product are replaced by Stewart Downing, 
who has made a career out of lacking an end product. That’s something for 
Traore to cling to as he skulks off to the bench.
 
78 min: Musa has been clipped by Clayton and left on the deck holding his 
ankle. No foul was given. Clayton has got away with a lot in this game.
 
74 min: A corner for Boro. A clearance by Leicester. Boro are completely in 
control but Leicester’s defence has hardly been ruffled all game. And I’m not 
sure Rudy Gestede is what this Boro team needs. They need someone who can run.
 
72 min: Mahrez and Okazaki have been hauled off by Ranieri and replaced by 
Gray and Musa. In the meantime, this is by far the most exciting thing that has 
happened in the past 72 minutes.

70 min: And then Forshaw has an equally fine chance to score for Boro 
following a beautiful arcing cross from the left from Friend that bends in 
invitingly and begs the Boro player to nod it home. Instead he reels in his 
neck and lets it skim off him and fall harmlessly down to Schmeichel.
 
69 min: Leicester go close to taking the lead after winning a corner after a 
rare break. The ball is whipped into Ulloa, who can only connect with his 
shoulder from six yards to send the ball dribbling into Guzan’s arms.
 
67 min: Friend bundles his way in from the left flank and then drops his 
shoulder beautifully to send Simpson the wrong way. He sees a sight of goal and 
tries to bend it into the top corner but can’t get his foot round it. His shot, 
like this game, is an unlovely sight.
 
65 min: Boro are still very much on top here but with Negredo misreading the 
few crosses that have come his way the home side just don’t look like scoring. 
Leicester are choosing to do nothing.
 
64 min: There’s a huge roar as Friend and Ulloa clatter into one another in 
the kind of hefty 50-50 tackle not seen in the top-flight since Lee 
Cattermole’s hip injury some months ago. That’s how good this game is.
 
62 min: Friend rolls a lovely ball into the corridor of uncertainty but 
Negredo, never one to look like he’s in much of a hurry, does a fine impression 
of Ulloa a minute or two earlier and watches it drift across goal.
 
60 min: The first 60 minutes of this game has been a visually convincing 
argument for those in favour of a winter break.

57 min: Fabio decides to inject a bit of dangerous fun into the game and chips 
over an approaching Leicester player to Traore not far outside his own box. 
Traore makes a meal of controlling it and Leicester win the ball back much to 
Karanka’s chagrin.
 
54 min: Mahrez slides the ball down the left-channel to King who, on the 
overlap, pings a dangerous ball across the six-yard box that Guzan can’t reach. 
It needs a poacher to gamble on it. But Leicester don’t have one of those on 
the pitch today. Both Ulloa and Okazaki hang back and pass up the chance to put 
their team 1-0 up.
 
52 min: Leicester are absorbing Boro’s pressure comfortably but when they look 
primed to break they are sorely lacking Vardy’s pace in attack. When Mahrez 
gathers the ball he has no one who can break out of a enthusiastic jog ahead of 
him.
 
50 min: Traore does a dance and fools no one before hitting the ball against 
Fuchs. He’s attracting two players over to him now, though. It could be that a 
switch of play over to the left could undo Leicester if Ranieri’s side become 
too fixated on Traore’s threatening pace.
 
49 min: A bright start here from Boro. They win a corner but Ramirez’s ball 
into the box is cleared at the near post.
 
47 min: Boro enjoy a good spell of possession and Friend and Ramirez combine 
well to work the ball down the left flank and then into midfield, where the 
ball is popped out to Traore. He beats Fuchs for pace (of course) and drifts a 
better ball into the box. Leicester head it clear and Friend clatters a low 
shot at goal that Schmeichel gathers into his chest.
 
45 min: It’s the second half. Leicester win a throw-in on the left. Fuchs  
Rory Delapshurls it into the box but Boro clear. 
 
If anything good is going to happen in this game it will be as a consequence 
of something Traore or Mahrez does. For all the lactic acid-affected huff and 
puff on display among many of the players, those two are the brightest by far.
 
They’re showing a collection of Adama Traore highlights and lowlights. When he 
beats a man he is so jaw-droppingly quick he gives himself almost too much time 
to consider his cross. If he had just half a yard he’d have a marker to bend 
the ball around. He’s actually too fast. If he ever slows down, he’ll be very, 
very good.

@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Adama really is one of 
those rare breed one trick ponies. Strength, speed and 1v1 👍. Everything else

He does have a touch of the Tony Daley about him.

45 min: Ulloa levers Friend out of the way and then trundles off into a 
thicket of Boro defenders, soon finding himself lost and without the ball.
 
44 min: If this first half is a sign of what is to come in 2017, we can expect 
nothing to happen. Nothing.
 
42 min: Mahrez starts to flicker to life with a douple-lollipop spritely run 
at goal that comes to nothing … and then a long-range shot that Guzan saves 
comfortably. A moment later, he bursts away from Clayton in midfield and 
Gibson, knowing that Boro’s defence has been left light, cynically clips 
Mahrez’s feet and takes a booking.
 
40 min: “Hi Gregg,” writes Kevin Ryan. “Re the 34th minute, I think you’re 
being a bit hard on Traore, I mean, any clown can pick out one of three of your 
own blokes in the box but picking out the programme seller. Well …”
 
38 min: Leicester hoik a long ball forwards. Okazaki takes a wonderful touch 
and slips Mahrez in down the right channel. He looks primed to strike at goal 
but Fabio, who has been very impressive so far, slides in brilliantly and hooks 
the ball away from the Algerian. That was a fantastic tackle.
