Jankto spent last season on loan at Ascoli in Serie B but is back with Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> for this campaign, with the 
manager Giuseppe Iachini ready to give the 20-year-old a chance in the first 
team.

Jankto signed for Udinese in 2014 after playing youth football for Slavia 
Prague in the Czech Republic. He played 34 league games for Ascoli last season, 
scoring five goals, impressing with his tireless running. His preferred 
position is on the left in a 4-3-3 formation but he can operate in a variety of 
positions on the left-hand side.

Udinese would prefer to keep the player but his contract runs out after this 
season and they are fearful of losing him on a free transfer next summer. The 
club would accept bids of £8m or more for the 20-year-old.
