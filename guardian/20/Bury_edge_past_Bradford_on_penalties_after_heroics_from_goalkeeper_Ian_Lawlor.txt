After Nathan Cameron was sent off, Bury did superbly to hold off a dominant 
Bradford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford> side for more than 50 
minutes plus extra time, as a goalless game went to penalties.

Lawlor, already a saviour during the match, then kept out spot-kicks from 
Steven Davies and Devante Cole to secureBury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bury> a meeting with Championship side 
Hull in the next round.

In a slow start, Cole’s far-post slip had robbed him of a tap-in chance early 
on, while Bury’s occasional counterattacking yielded a 25-yard shot from Tom 
Soares after 32 minutes, with the Bradford goalkeeper Ben Williams saving low.

However, there was trouble shortly before the break when Cameron was sent off 
for two quick-fire bookings, first for a shove on Luke James before the Shakers 
captain inexplicably handled the ball deliberately when jumping to meet it.

The visitors were under immense pressure after the restart, and the Bradford 
substitute Josh Morris hit the post after 72 minutes. Bury came close as a 
deflected cross from Danny Mayor went just wide, and moving towards extra time, 
Steven Davies headed onto the bar for Bradford from a Lee Evans free-kick.

The home side continued to press in extra time, Davies shooting just wide from 
distance, as Bury’s best chance of the match came when Danny Pugh struck the 
post with a skilful effort on the turn.

In the end, Davies failed with Bradford’s second penalty, and Cole with their 
fourth, and Jacob Mellis’ effort sealed things for Bury.
