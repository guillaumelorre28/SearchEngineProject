Cristiano Ronaldo made up for a missed penalty by scoring in injury time in 
Real Madrid’s home win over Málaga that kept them two points behind Barcelona 
in second place inLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>.

However, both Gareth Bale and Luka Modric were injured four days before Real 
host their city rivals Atlético Madrid in the second leg of their Champions 
League quarter-final.

Bale limped off with an apparent calf strain early on in the game and could be 
a doubt for Wednesday’s Champions League clash.

The Welshman went down clutching his left calf with no opposition players 
near, and he was replaced by Javier Hernández after just two minutes.

Bale was rested for Real’s match with Eibar last weekend due to muscle fatigue 
but played in Tuesday’s first leg at Atlético, which finished 0-0.

Sergio Ramos gave Real the lead against Málaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/malaga> after 26 minutes when he tapped 
in Ronaldo’s cross. Ronaldo had the chance to make it two in the second half 
but his penalty came back off the post after James Rodríguez had been brought 
down.

Modric went off just before the hour after a knock to his knee. James 
Rodríguez did double the European champions’ lead on 68 minutes with a shot 
into the top corner but Juanmi quickly headed one back for the visitors, 
leaving Ronaldo to tap in from close range for his 50th goal of the season with 
seconds left.
