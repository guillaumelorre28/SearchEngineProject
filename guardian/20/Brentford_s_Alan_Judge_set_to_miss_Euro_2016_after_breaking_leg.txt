Judge fractured his lower leg in Saturday’s 3-1 win at Ipswich, the Sky Bet 
Championship club have announced.

Judge, who started for the Republic of Ireland

against Switzerland last month, was carried off after two minutes following a 
strong tackle by Luke Hyam, who was only booked for the challenge but later saw

The Bees have now confirmed that Judge, 27, faces a lengthy spell on the 
sidelines and looks likely to miss this summer’s European Championship.

A statement read: “During today’s Sky Bet Championship game against Ipswich 
Town, Alan Judge sustained a fracture injury to his lower leg.

“The injury was assessed and immobilised locally and Alan has now been 
transferred to a London hospital where he will be managed by the leading 
lower-limb consultant in the country.

“The nature of his management and long-term prognosis cannot be speculated on 
at this time, however it should be stated that a full recovery is not in 
question.

“Alan and his family will receive our fullest support and further comment will 
be provided as we’re able to over the coming days.”
