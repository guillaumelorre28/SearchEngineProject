So that’s it. After a thrilling and tenacious drive, Lewis Hamilton has his 
first win of the season and will be looking to build on this victory at the 
Canadian Grand Prix (10-12 June). PoorDaniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo>, undone by poor pit-stop 
strategy in Barcelona, is once again the victim of abject incompetence by Red 
Bull, and the inquest into that fluffed tyre change will surely rage long and 
hard. As for Justin Bieber, the less said the better. Thanks for reading and 
enjoy the rest of your Sunday.

Let’s look at the points situation, not least for the benefit of Scott Adare, 
who is watching from an RV park in rural Montana. Having started the day 43 
points adrift ofNico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>, 
Hamilton now stands a much healthier 24 points behind his team-mate. Rosberg 
has 106 points, Hamilton 82, while Ricciardo stands third on 66 points. Kimi 
Raikkonen is five points further adrift in fourth, Vettel is fifth with 60 
points, and Max Verstappen is sixth on 38 points.

So Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> ends his 
losing streak at eight.What a drive that was. Throughout, the Briton had the 
courage of his convictions: he continued on the wet weather tyres for longer 
than seemed possible, then repeated the feat in spades on ultra-soft ones. As 
Hamilton put it: “That was the longest run, it was crazy how long it was. 
Probably the last lap was the time they were about to drop off.” Alternatively, 
as Barbara writes: “Hoorah for Hamilton! Fabulous win. Thrilled with the 
result!”

Helmut Marko, Red Bull’s motorsport consultant, is in sullen mood at trackside.
 “We presented it to Mercedes,” reflects the Austrian, alluding darkly to “a 
lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication.”

“It was a human mistake. We’ll make an investigation and tell you more. I feel 
really sorry [for Daniel Ricciardo], and we will apologise to him,” says Marko.

British fans are more upbeat, however, and none more so than Inga and Keith 
Davis-Rutter. “Husband and I are sitting in San Sebastian in Spain on holiday 
watching the Grand Prix from a distance outside a bar. Your live feed has made 
the race for us! Brilliant commentary. Many thanks! (And hurrah for 
Hamilton!).” You’re welcome, Inga!

“The message from today, for everyone, is to never give up,” says Hamilton, 
who says he hasn’t even considered the broader ramifications of the result as 
yet.Don’t you believe it. He may not know the exact numbers, but he’ll 
appreciate better than anyone that his season has just taken a major upward 
turn.

“Two weekends in a row of being screwed and it sucks … It hurts, it hurts … I 
don’t have anything else to say, to be honest.” So saysDaniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo>, who nonetheless adds that 
his team called him in and should have been ready with those tyres. Ouch.

Hamilton, who received the silverware from Prince Albert of Monaco and almost 
let it slip from his gleeful grasp, sprays the champers over all and sundry.
Ricciardo, though, is a study in contrasting emotions. He looks utterly crushed.

pride of place for the first time in 2016.Bizarrely, he was congratulated by

Lap 76: As Hamilton storms past the moored super yachts, Ricciardo cuts the 
Briton’s lead to 3.5 seconds. But hold on, what’s this? Rain? It is, you know.

Lap 72: “Thanks for the updates today!” writes Nick West. “I’m sunning myself 
in a nice park in Chippenham along with a couple of cold ones, enjoying your 
updates, sounds like a great race.” Thanks, Nick, it is indeed. And if you’re a
Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> fan, it could

Lap 71: Hamilton records the fastest lap of the race; he’s 2.65 seconds of

has been more accustomed to dealing with technical problems than defending a 
lead this season, and this is by no means a done deal.

Lap 68: Something has flown off a balcony near the finish line, and the 
virtual safety car briefly comes into play. It doesn’t last long, but Perez 
seems to lose about four and a half seconds on Ricciardo in second. The Aussie 
is about two and a half seconds behind Hamilton.

Lap 64: For all Rosberg’s unaccustomed struggles here – he’s still languishing 
in sixth – it’s looking as though Mercedes could prevail again. Not quite the 
shot in the arm that neutral observers might have wanted but, for all 
Hamilton’s enterprise, Ricciardo and his Red Bull are still very much in 
contention.

Lap 63: What an exciting race, with the leaders still pushing each other hard, 
rain on the way and just 15 laps remaining. Will Hamilton be able to nurse 
those tyres over the line? Can Ricciardo find a way through? The top two are 
pulling away, and the slightest lapse of concentration could be decisive now.

Lap 60: With another shower apparently looming as we head for the business end 
of the race it’s, um, a race against time. Hamilton is 1.404 seconds ahead of 
Ricciardo, with Perez’s Force India still going great guns in third. From there 
it’s Vettel, Alonso and Rosberg who make up the top six.

Lap 59: With 27 laps on the ultra-soft tyres behind him, Hamilton continues to

Laps 46-50: Hamilton is in the clear after that Ricciardo incident, with no 
further action to be taken. Wehrlein is slapped with a 10-second penalty, 
however, after a time infringement during an earlier virtual safety car period. 
Speaking of virtual safety cars, we’re at that point again after Marcus 
Ericsson and Felipe Nasr collide, the latter having paid no heed to an order to 
let his team-mate pass. Oh dear.

Lap 45: Sergio Perez is going strong in third, but this is still all about 
Hamilton-Ricciardo for now. Victory would leave the Briton 26 points adrift of 
Rosberg, who must be getting deeply frustrated back in sixth.

Lap 44: You sense that the Hamilton-Ricciardo incident, which is now under 
investigation, is likely to be a big talking point come the end of this race. 
For the time being, though, Hamilton remains the man to beat. But how long can 
he continue on those ultra-soft tyres?

Lap 42: Hamilton continues to go well on the ultra-soft tyres, and remains 
about two seconds ahead of Ricciardo. After a damp squib of a start, this is 
really hotting up.

Lap 38: Miscommunication was apparently behind Ricciardo’s bungled and 
potentially costly pit stop. It cost the Australian the lead, and there are 
signs that his temper is fraying as he battles to get past Hamilton. A timely 
message from Ricciardo’s team tells him to keep his head together and remember 
that he’s quicker. Sound advice.

Lap 37: Ricciardo attempts to get past Hamilton, but the world champion is 
having none of it. That was close: the Australian’s front wing was level with 
Hamilton’s rear tyre, the Briton having momentarily veered off the road. 
Meanwhile, Perez is up to third. From there, it’s Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, 
Hulkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutierrez.

Lap 35: Verstappen is out! And so is the virtual safety car. The Dutchman 
locks a brake and goes careering into the barrier. He’s certainly conscious, 
because he spoke just after the incident, but he’s still sat in his car. Let’s 
hope he’s OK.

Laps 29-32: Finally, on lap 32, Hamilton pits. It sparks something of a 
scramble for the pits, not least from Ricciardo. But, sensationally, the 
Aussie’s tyres aren’t ready! Cue a frantic scramble among the Red Bull team. He 
re-emerges quicker than might have been expected, but Ricciardo is not a happy 
man, and rightly so. Hamilton assumes the lead and that’s a big blow for Red 
Bull man.

Lap 27: For all Hamilton’s boldness, Ricciardo is eating into his lead with 
each passing lap. Word is that Rosberg was having brake issues earlier on, 
which perhaps goes some way to explaining the Briton’s struggles to pass his 
team-mate. Still, the world champion will have to make a move for the pits 
soon, surely?

close  
So that’s it. After a thrilling and tenacious drive, Lewis Hamilton has his 
first win of the season and will be looking to build on this victory at the 
Canadian Grand Prix (10-12 June). PoorDaniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo>, undone by poor pit-stop 
strategy in Barcelona, is once again the victim of abject incompetence by Red 
Bull, and the inquest into that fluffed tyre change will surely rage long and 
hard. As for Justin Bieber, the less said the better. Thanks for reading and 
enjoy the rest of your Sunday.
 
Here’s a full report on the race.

Lewis Hamilton gets his first F1 victory of season at Monaco Grand Prix

Let’s look at the points situation, not least for the benefit of Scott Adare, 
who is watching from an RV park in rural Montana. Having started the day 43 
points adrift ofNico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>, 
Hamilton now stands a much healthier 24 points behind his team-mate. Rosberg 
has 106 points, Hamilton 82, while Ricciardo stands third on 66 points. Kimi 
Raikkonen is five points further adrift in fourth, Vettel is fifth with 60 
points, and Max Verstappen is sixth on 38 points.
 
So Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> ends his 
losing streak at eight.What a drive that was. Throughout, the Briton had the 
courage of his convictions: he continued on the wet weather tyres for longer 
than seemed possible, then repeated the feat in spades on ultra-soft ones. As 
Hamilton put it: “That was the longest run, it was crazy how long it was. 
Probably the last lap was the time they were about to drop off.” Alternatively, 
as Barbara writes: “Hoorah for Hamilton! Fabulous win. Thrilled with the 
result!”
 
Helmut Marko, Red Bull’s motorsport consultant, is in sullen mood at trackside.
 “We presented it to Mercedes,” reflects the Austrian, alluding darkly to “a 
lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication.”

“It was a human mistake. We’ll make an investigation and tell you more. I feel 
really sorry [for Daniel Ricciardo], and we will apologise to him,” says Marko.

British fans are more upbeat, however, and none more so than Inga and Keith 
Davis-Rutter. “Husband and I are sitting in San Sebastian in Spain on holiday 
watching the Grand Prix from a distance outside a bar. Your live feed has made 
the race for us! Brilliant commentary. Many thanks! (And hurrah for 
Hamilton!).” You’re welcome, Inga!
 
“The message from today, for everyone, is to never give up,” says Hamilton, 
who says he hasn’t even considered the broader ramifications of the result as 
yet.Don’t you believe it. He may not know the exact numbers, but he’ll 
appreciate better than anyone that his season has just taken a major upward 
turn.
 
“It was an amazing race and I’m extremely happy,” says Perez.
 
“Two weekends in a row of being screwed and it sucks … It hurts, it hurts … I 
don’t have anything else to say, to be honest.” So saysDaniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo>, who nonetheless adds that 
his team called him in and should have been ready with those tyres. Ouch.
 
Hamilton speaks: “Thank God that today went as I hoped … A big thank you to my 
team for providing me with a car that helped me see it through to the end; I 
feel truly blessed … It was crazy how long that run was [on the soft tyres] … 
Big congratulations to Daniel, he raced phenomenally all weekend.”
 
Hamilton, who received the silverware from Prince Albert of Monaco and almost 
let it slip from his gleeful grasp, sprays the champers over all and sundry.
Ricciardo, though, is a study in contrasting emotions. He looks utterly crushed.
 
All smiles from Hamilton as the anthems are played with the union flag in 
pride of place for the first time in 2016.Bizarrely, he was congratulated by 
Justin Bieber as he left his car. Seriously, that guy gets everywhere.

Ricciardo looks rueful, and well he might. That catastrophic pit stop cost him 
the race; oh, to be a fly on the wall at the Red Bull debrief.
 
Top five placings: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Perez, Vettel, Alonso.
 
Just as in 2008, Hamilton starts in third and prevails in wet conditions. And 
so history repeats itself. That’s the Briton’s first win of the season and it 
was richly deserved.
 
Lap 78: Lewis Hamilton wins the Monaco grand prix! Daniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo> is second, ahead of Sergio 
Perez in third.

Lap 77: In tricky conditions, Hamilton is a lap away from his second victory 
in Monaco. Ricciardo, meanwhile, is comfortable in second, with Perez third.
 
Lap 76: As Hamilton storms past the moored super yachts, Ricciardo cuts the 
Briton’s lead to 3.5 seconds. But hold on, what’s this? Rain? It is, you know. 
Could there be a late twist?
 
Lap 75: With three laps to go, Hamilton’s lead now stands at just under four 
seconds. Perez and Vettel continue to dispute third spot on the podium.
 
Lap 72: “Thanks for the updates today!” writes Nick West. “I’m sunning myself 
in a nice park in Chippenham along with a couple of cold ones, enjoying your 
updates, sounds like a great race.” Thanks, Nick, it is indeed. And if you’re a
Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> fan, it could 
soon get even better …
 
Lap 71: Hamilton records the fastest lap of the race; he’s 2.65 seconds of 
Ricciardo, who – for now, at least – can only bide his time. Still, Hamilton 
has been more accustomed to dealing with technical problems than defending a 
lead this season, and this is by no means a done deal.

Lap 70: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Perez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg …
 
Lap 69: The man from Pirelli is apparently surprised Hamilton has got this far 
on those soft tyres. Watch this space …
 
Lap 68: Something has flown off a balcony near the finish line, and the 
virtual safety car briefly comes into play. It doesn’t last long, but Perez 
seems to lose about four and a half seconds on Ricciardo in second. The Aussie 
is about two and a half seconds behind Hamilton.
 
Lap 65: As the storm clouds gather, Vettel almost comes a cropper. Massenet, 
in front of him, will be mighty relieved.
 
Lap 64: For all Rosberg’s unaccustomed struggles here – he’s still languishing 
in sixth – it’s looking as though Mercedes could prevail again. Not quite the 
shot in the arm that neutral observers might have wanted but, for all 
Hamilton’s enterprise, Ricciardo and his Red Bull are still very much in 
contention.
 
Lap 63: What an exciting race, with the leaders still pushing each other hard, 
rain on the way and just 15 laps remaining. Will Hamilton be able to nurse 
those tyres over the line? Can Ricciardo find a way through? The top two are 
pulling away, and the slightest lapse of concentration could be decisive now.

Lap 60: With another shower apparently looming as we head for the business end 
of the race it’s, um, a race against time. Hamilton is 1.404 seconds ahead of 
Ricciardo, with Perez’s Force India still going great guns in third. From there 
it’s Vettel, Alonso and Rosberg who make up the top six.
 
Lap 59: With 27 laps on the ultra-soft tyres behind him, Hamilton continues to 
lead. Ricciardo remains unable to find a way through, and it’s a masterclass in 
controlled driving from the Briton.
 
Lap 54: Looks like Ericsson is out too. Comedy of errors. 
 
Lap 53: Nasr is out. Moral of the story? Don’t ignore team orders. Meanwhile, 
Ricciardo tries to edge past Hamilton again, but the Briton keeps him at bay.

Lap 52: With smoke emerging from his car, Nasr pits again.
 
Lap 51: Having sustained damage, both Saubers pit. Meanwhile, Hamilton keeps 
it steady at the front.
 
Laps 46-50: Hamilton is in the clear after that Ricciardo incident, with no 
further action to be taken. Wehrlein is slapped with a 10-second penalty, 
however, after a time infringement during an earlier virtual safety car period. 
Speaking of virtual safety cars, we’re at that point again after Marcus 
Ericsson and Felipe Nasr collide, the latter having paid no heed to an order to 
let his team-mate pass. Oh dear.
 
Lap 45: Sergio Perez is going strong in third, but this is still all about 
Hamilton-Ricciardo for now. Victory would leave the Briton 26 points adrift of 
Rosberg, who must be getting deeply frustrated back in sixth.

Lap 44: You sense that the Hamilton-Ricciardo incident, which is now under 
investigation, is likely to be a big talking point come the end of this race. 
For the time being, though, Hamilton remains the man to beat. But how long can 
he continue on those ultra-soft tyres?
 
Lap 43: With the top four of Hamilton, Ricciardo, Perez and Vettel pulling 
away, there’s a gap opening up going back to Alonso in fifth.
 
Lap 42: Hamilton continues to go well on the ultra-soft tyres, and remains 
about two seconds ahead of Ricciardo. After a damp squib of a start, this is 
really hotting up.
 
Lap 38: Miscommunication was apparently behind Ricciardo’s bungled and 
potentially costly pit stop. It cost the Australian the lead, and there are 
signs that his temper is fraying as he battles to get past Hamilton. A timely 
message from Ricciardo’s team tells him to keep his head together and remember 
that he’s quicker. Sound advice.

Lap 37: Ricciardo attempts to get past Hamilton, but the world champion is 
having none of it. That was close: the Australian’s front wing was level with 
Hamilton’s rear tyre, the Briton having momentarily veered off the road. 
Meanwhile, Perez is up to third. From there, it’s Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, 
Hulkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutierrez.
 
Lap 36: Rosberg is down to sixth, having lost out to Vettel when they pitted 
earlier. Alonso is up into fifth.
 
Lap 35: Verstappen is out! And so is the virtual safety car. The Dutchman 
locks a brake and goes careering into the barrier. He’s certainly conscious, 
because he spoke just after the incident, but he’s still sat in his car. Let’s 
hope he’s OK.
 
Lap 34: Ricciardo makes a move to regain the lead, but Hamilton sees him 
coming and blocks off the line. Close.
 
Lap 33: Sergio Perez is going brilliantly in third, but it’s Hamilton who 
leads despite almost coming a cropper as he locks up going into a bend.
 
Laps 29-32: Finally, on lap 32, Hamilton pits. It sparks something of a 
scramble for the pits, not least from Ricciardo. But, sensationally, the 
Aussie’s tyres aren’t ready! Cue a frantic scramble among the Red Bull team. He 
re-emerges quicker than might have been expected, but Ricciardo is not a happy 
man, and rightly so. Hamilton assumes the lead and that’s a big blow for Red 
Bull man.
 
Lap 28: Ricciardo is about half a second behind Hamilton. Rosberg third. Perez 
fourth from Vettel in fifth.
 
Lap 27: For all Hamilton’s boldness, Ricciardo is eating into his lead with 
each passing lap. Word is that Rosberg was having brake issues earlier on, 
which perhaps goes some way to explaining the Briton’s struggles to pass his 
team-mate. Still, the world champion will have to make a move for the pits 
soon, surely?
 
Lap 26: Hamilton continues to forge ahead, with Ricciardo right on his tail. 
The track looks ever drier. Rosberg remains third.
