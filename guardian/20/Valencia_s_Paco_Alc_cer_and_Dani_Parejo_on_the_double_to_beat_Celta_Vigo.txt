Valencia’s Paco Alcácer and Dani Parejo scored twice each in a surprise away 
thrashing of high-flyingCelta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> in La Liga on Saturday.

Third-placed Celta had lots of the ball and missed several chances while 
Valencia’s finishing was ruthless as they picked up a win that eases the 
pressure on their coach, Nuno Espírito Santo.

Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have not lived up to 
expectations so far this season following heavy investment in players but the 
victory lifts them up to sixth place on 18 points.

Valencia took the lead when a defence-splitting Parejo pass set up Alcácer to 
finish clinically after 12 minutes before Celta came back strongly.

Augusto Fernández headed the equaliser from close range following a corner in 
the 24th minute and the Valencia defence was stretched by the rhythm and 
movement of the Celta forwards.

The home side always looked sloppy at the back and against the run of play 
Parejo struck a sweet free-kick into the top corner just before half-time.

Straight after the break a back pass from Jonny Castro was intercepted by 
Alcácer who slotted home expertly.

Celta laid siege to the Valencia goal and Iago Aspas hit a post but on another 
breakaway Alcácer set up Parejo to score inside the area after 64 minutes.

With Celta’s heads down, Shkodran Mustafi piled on the misery to make it 5-1 
having been given a free header after 79 minutes.

The league leaders Real Madrid and Barcelona have 24 points and face Sevilla 
and Villarreal respectively on Sunday. Celta are three points behind with 
Atlético Madrid and Villarreal on 20.
