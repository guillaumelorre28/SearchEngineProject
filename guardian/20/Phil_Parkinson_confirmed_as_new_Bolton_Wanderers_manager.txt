Bolton Wanderers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/boltonwanderers> have 
announced Phil Parkinson as the club’s new manager after agreeing a 
compensation package with Bradford City.

The 48-year-old has signed a two-year contract and will be joined at the 
Macron Stadium by assistant manager Steve Parkin.

Bolton had been searching for a new manager since March after Neil Lennon left 
the club by mutual consent, five days after Dean Holdsworth’s Sport Shield 
consortium had completed its takeover.
