Cardiff have been placed under a Football League transfer embargo for a breach 
of financial fair play rules.

The embargo will be in place for the rest of the January transfer window and 
will see them lose out on a permanent deal for £1m target Tony Watt, although 
the Charlton striker’s loan deal could be extended after Cardiff’s visit to 
Wolves on Saturday.

Cardiff, who were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2013-14 
season, say they “have complied with the FFP requirements for season 2014-15 – 
contrary to the League’s position”.

Russell Slade has significantly reduced playing costs since being appointed 
manager in October 2014, with the club’s biggest earners having been moved on.

“Whilst extremely disappointed that the Football League has decided to take 
this action, we will remain co-operative and compliant with the League’s 
position in respect of financial fair play,” said a Cardiff statement.

“Having fully disclosed all matters in respect of our FFP position for 2014-15 
and having taken independent expert advice, it is our firmly held view that
Cardiff City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cardiffcity> has indeed 
complied with the FFP requirements for season 2014-15 – contrary to the 
League’s position.

“As such, further advice will be sought, prior to a decision being made 
internally as to whether or not an appeal will be lodged.

“The embargo, now in place (albeit subject to possible appeal), will stay in 
effect for the remainder of the January 2016 transfer window.

“Cardiff City again expects to trade within the set FFP limits for 2015-16 and 
therefore anticipates full participation in the summer 2016 transfer window.”
