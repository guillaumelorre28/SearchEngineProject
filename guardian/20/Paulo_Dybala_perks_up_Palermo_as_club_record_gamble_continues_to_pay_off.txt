Paulo Dybala can probably leave his wallet at home when he pops to the cafe 
these days. Reflecting on the ways his life had changed in the two-and-a-bit 
years since he joinedPalermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo>, 
the Argentinian striker told Sportweek magazine in November: “Up to last year 
it was rare for anyone to offer me a coffee. From the start of this season, I 
have had one or two for free.”

And that was before he really started giving the locals something to talk 
about over their morning cappuccinos. At the time of his interview, Dybala was 
only just beginning to show his potential for the Sicilian club – scoring five 
goals in his first 12 league appearances of the season. He would add another 
four goals, and four assists, over his next five games, leading into Saturday’s 
match against Roma.

Nobody had foreseen such production before the season began. Nobody except the 
Palermo owner, Maurizio Zamparini, perhaps. He was the one who allowed both of 
his club’s top two most prolific strikers to depart after theRosanero were 
promoted back into the Italian top-flight last summer. Abel Hernández and Kyle 
Lafferty had scored a combined 26 goals in Serie B, but left to join Hull and 
Norwich respectively. Dybala, who had found the net five times in 28 matches, 
remained.

Zamparini was doubling down on the investment he had made in the summer of 
2012, when he paid a club-record fee of €12m [£9.2m] to acquire Dybala from 
Instituto de Córdoba. It was some gamble to make on an 18-year-old whose only 
season of senior football had been played in Argentina’s second division.

Palermo had discovered the player almost by accident. Their then sporting 
director, Luca Cattani, visited Argentina in 2011 to negotiate the purchase of 
another promising young forward, Franco Vázquez, from Belgrano, but Dybala’s 
name was mentioned to him over dinner one night by the Instituto president, 
Juan Carlos Barrera. Scouting visits were arranged. Cattani liked what he saw.

Dybala would go on to score 17 goals in 38 games for Instituto, drawing the 
attention of richer clubs than Palermo. Interest from the likes of Inter, 
Napoli and Porto caused the transfer fee to soar. Zamparini dug deep to get his 
man, yet when Dybala finally arrived in Sicily, fans were bemused to see that 
he looked more like a child than a superstar. His slender frame and 
stubble-free chin led them to nickname him ‘U Picciriddu’ – ‘The Kid’.

Behind such juvenile features, however, was a young man who had grown up 
faster than most. Dybala had been 15 years old when his father passed away at 
the end of a long battle with cancer. It was an event that almost ended the 
striker’s career before began. Not only had Dybala lost a parent, but also the 
man who used to drive him back and forth on the hour-long journey to train with 
Instituto’s academy squad every day.

For six months Dybala returned to play for the local team in his small 
hometown of Laguna Larga. But then he took the bold step of leaving home so he 
could resume training with Instituto. He moved into a boarding house at the 
team’s training facility, and would remain there until his transfer to Palermo.

By contrast, his first home in Sicily would be a picturesque hotel by the 
beach at Mondello. “I saw the sea 10 metres away,” he recalled during his 
interview with Sportweek. “And I said to myself, ‘this is paradise’.”

But if Dybala thought he had arrived, then he was in for a rude awakening. The 
step up from Argentina’s second division to the Italian top-flight was 
significant. “It was tough to adapt,” he confessed. “The football here is much 
faster, more physical and tactical. Even the referees are different.”

He scored just three times in his first Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> season, although his 
progress cannot have been helped by Zamparini’s habit of constantly changing 
managers. Palermo began and ended the season with Beppe Sannino on the 
touchline, but went through three separate regimes in-between. Gian Piero 
Gasperini took over in September, lost his job to Alberto Malesani in February, 
returned before the end of that month and finally ceded the role back to 
Sannino in March.

Relegation, predictably, followed. Dybala fared little better in Serie B. By 
the time Palermo returned to the top-flight a year later, some supporters were 
quietly beginning to give up on their record signing.

Even Dybala was setting modest targets for the season ahead. With Hernández 
and Lafferty departed, it was clear that the onus to score goals was about to 
fall on his shoulders, but he told Gazzetta dello Sport in August that his 
ambition was simply to reach double figures.

On Saturday, he achieved that objective with half a season left to spare.

There were not yet three minutes on the clock when Roma’s Davide Astori 
delivered a sloppy pass straight to Vázquez (whose signature Cattani also 
secured at the start of 2012). He took a single touch before threading the ball 
through to Dybala, who side-footed it past Morgan De Sanctis and into the 
bottom corner of the net.

Manchester United transfer target Paulo Dybala gives Palermo the lead against 
Roma with his 10th goal of the season.https://t.co/i7ojsbfvkC

 <https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/556542166990729216> January 17, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/556542166990729216> 
It was a ruthlessly efficient combination from two players who are thriving in 
each other’s company. Vázquez himself was a fringe player in Serie B last 
season, but has started almost every match in this campaign. Playing as the 
second-striker in Beppe Iachini’s 3-5-2, he has relished the responsibility of 
providing support to his compatriot. Between them, he and Dybala have either 
scored or set up 21 of Palermo’s 31 goals this season.

Their efforts were not enough to seal a victory Saturday. Roma equalised early 
in the second half through Mattia Destro, and Palermo blew their opportunities 
to take the lead again thereafter. Dybala should have done better when played 
through on goal by Edgar Barreto in the 61st minute, shooting straight at De 
Sanctis this time around.

But there was no shame for the Sicilians in drawing against a title contender. 
Palermo’s target at the start of this season was simply to avoid relegation. 
With half a season gone, they are instead all the way up in eighth. Iachini has 
already achieved one remarkable feat by surviving a full calendar year without 
being sacked by Zamparini. Taking this team into the Europa League places would 
be an even greater success.

Another 10 goals from Dybala over the next 19 games would not hurt his cause. 
And nor would they harm Zamparini’s efforts tosell the player on for a handsome 
profit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/14/palermo-manchester-united-paulo-dybala>
. As unromantic as this reality might be, fans can rest assured that the owner 
will sell Dybala as soon as the right suitor comes along. Palermo’s business 
model relies on the money that the club can make by developing young players in 
this way.

In Dybala’s case, the club’s greatest concern will be that his contract is set 
to expire in 2016. Zamparini has been trying to sign the player to an 
extension, but so far no deal has been done.

None of which stopped the owner from declaring at the start of November that 
Dybala was worth “exactly the same as [Javier] Pastore,” whom Palermo sold to 
Paris Saint-Germain for €42m in the summer of 2011. Dybala himself rejected 
that suggestion, describing Zamparini’s figure as “a lie”.

But that back-and-forth, too, took place in November – before the striker’s 
rainbow flick against Torino 
<https://amp.twimg.com/v/aed1ad0d-8df6-40a6-ba58-9cea63183c5d> or his brace 
against Cagliari. Before Dybala truly began to fulfil the immense potential 
that Cattani first witnessed back in 2011. And to really earn those free 
coffees.

Talking points

• Roma’s draw gave Juventus the opportunity to open up a five-point lead at 
the top of Serie A, and theBianconeri duly obliged, hammering Verona 4-0. 
Having already lost 6-1 to them in the Coppa Italia three nights earlier, 
Andrea Mandorlini’s team will be glad to see the back of Turin.

• Paul Pogba scored his third goal in as many games, although perhaps even 
more impressive than his recent form is the calm manner in which he is handling 
the endless speculation about his long-term future. “Zero Euros,” replied the 
midfielder when one journalist asked how much he thought he was worth in the 
transfer market. “I’m just thinking about working on the pitch and giving 
everything.”

• Another rough weekend for the Milan clubs, as Inter drew 0-0 away to Empoli, 
and Milan lost 1-0 at home to Atalanta.I wrote about the difficult seasons they 
are each having on Saturday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/17/milan-internazionale-serie-a-italian-football-city-rivals>
, but must confess that I had expected them both to win this time out. The lone 
bright spot for Inter is that Xherdan Shaqiri has now finally made his debut, 
even if his impact as a late substitute on this occasion was fairly negligible.

• Full marks to linesman Gianluca Cariolato, who took a tumble while tracking 
one Inter attack during that draw against Empoli on Sunday night,but still 
correctly signalled for offside while seated on his backside 
<https://vine.co/v/OjrabJwdpMV>.

• News that Milan had hired set-piece guru Gianni Vio away from Fiorentina 
last summer was received as something of a coup, but so far his tangible impact 
has been minimal. TheRossoneri have scored just two goals from dead-ball 
situations this season (excluding penalties) but perhaps we caught a glimpse of 
his work in one bizarre free-kick routine attempted against Atalanta. As Jérémy 
Ménez stood over the ball, Milan deployed several lines of their own players 
directly in front of the opposition’s wall. These decoys then scattered in 
different directions, causing some confusion among the defenders, but Ménez 
missed the target anyway.

• Napoli won their head-to-head with Lazio, leapfrogging their opponents into 
third thanks to a single goal from Gonzalo Higuaín. This was a tough time for 
Lazio to face a direct rival, with Felipe Anderson, Stefano Mauri, Senad Lulic 
and Stefan De Vrij all missing. Unsurprisingly, given his recent form, it was 
the dynamism of the Brazilian that they seemed to miss the most.

• A six-goal thriller at the Marassi, where Sassuolo three times took the lead 
and three times were pegged back by Genoa. Gian Piero Gasperini’s side will be 
grateful for the point after trailing in the 90th minute, but their hopes of 
gatecrashing the European places have taken a hammering over the last few 
weeks. This was just their second point in the last five games.

• Samuel Eto’o is expected to complete his transfer from Everton to Sampdoria 
in the coming days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/16/samuel-etoo-everton-sampdoria>
, joining a team that currently sits level with Napoli in joint-third. It is 
tempting to suggest that Samp have hardly missed a beat since selling Manolo 
Gabbiadini to thePartenopei, but given that their last two wins have come 
against opponents sat 16th and joint-bottom of the table, we should probably 
hold judgement for now.

Results: Cesena 2-3 Torino, Chievo 1-2 Fiorentina, Empoli 0-0 Inter, Genoa 3-3 
Sassuolo, Juventus 4-0 Verona, Lazio 0-1 Napoli, Milan 0-1 Atalanta, Palermo 
1-1 Roma, Parma 0-2 Sampdoria, Udinese 2-2 Cagliari.
