“For the moment four major foreign clubs, including Dortmund and Liverpool, 
have made an offer,” Hayestold the French newspaper Ouest France 
<http://www.ouest-france.fr/sport/football/fc-lorient/fc-lorient-les-merlus-veulent-boucler-rapidement-leur-mercato-4248513>
.

“No one wants to see Raphaël leave, especially the president. He will only be 
transferred if a club makes an offer that we can’t refuse.

“The fourth one shouldn’t take too long to be made [officially] but for the 
moment none of them satisfy us. We’re calm. We don’t need to sell to balance 
the books.”

Guerreiro was signed from Caen in 2013 and has only one year left on his 
contract. It is likely that it will take a bid of around £10m to persuadeLorient
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> to sell.
