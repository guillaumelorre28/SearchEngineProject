PSG sealed their fourth straight title with eight matches to spare last 
weekend but looked out of sorts in defence asMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> scored twice in quick succession 
midway through the second half to strengthen their hold on second and an 
automatic place in next season’s Champions League.

It was PSG’s first home defeat in the league since May 2014, as the Brazilian 
striker Vagner Love put Monaco ahead in the 65th minute and his compatriot 
Fabinho scored from the penalty spot three minutes later.

The PSG forward Cavani missed a good chance and then went close with a 
spectacular scissor kick as PSG controlled the first half.

But Monaco stepped up the pace after the break and Love punished some slack 
defending to turn in a cross from the left. Then Monaco were awarded a penalty 
after David Luiz pulled back Fabinho in the penalty area and the defender 
coolly sent the goalkeeper, Kevin Trapp, the wrong way.

The only other side to beat PSG in the league this season were Lyon last month 
and, to sum up PSG’s bad night, Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed an open goal near the 
end.

PSG’s huge lead over Monaco was trimmed to 22 points with seven games 
remaining.

Monaco moved five points ahead of third-placed Nice, who beat struggling 
Gazélec Ajaccio 3-0 earlier with Hatem Ben Arfa scoring a brilliant solo goal.
