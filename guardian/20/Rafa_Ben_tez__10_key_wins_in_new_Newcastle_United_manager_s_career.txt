Leganés 0-1 Tenerife

17 June 2001, Spanish Segunda División Having achieved promotion with 
Extremadura, Benítez was hired by the Segunda side Tenerife with the same 
objective. Level on points with an Atlético Madrid side containing a young 
Fernando Torres on the final day, a Hugo Morales winner fired the island club, 
and Benítez, into the big time.

Espanyol 2-3 Valencia

15 December 2001, Spanish Primera División The inexperienced coach had taken 
the reigns at Valencia and suffered an indifferent start to life at a top club. 
Under fire and with his side 2-0 down at Espanyol, the end looked near for 
Benítez. Not for the last time, a second-half resurgence rescued him.

Málaga 0-2 Valencia

5 May 2002, Spanish Primera División The momentum from that Espanyol game led 
Valencia all the way to the summit of La Liga. Heading into the penultimate 
round of matches with a four-point cushion over the defending champions, Real 
Madrid, goals from Roberto Ayala and the future Liverpool defender Fábio 
Aurélio secured Valencia’s first league title in 31 years.

Valencia 2-0 Marseille

19 May 2004, Uefa Cup final “There was a very good mentality, a winning team.” 
That was Benítez’s description of his 2004 Valencia side. A second La Liga 
title in three years, secured with three games to spare, was followed by a 2-0 
victory over a Didier Drogba-inspired Marseille in the Uefa Cup final, goals 
from Vicente and Mista giving Benítez his first European trophy – in what 
proved his last game with Valencia as he had fallen out with the board.

Liverpool 3-1 Olympiakos

8 December 2004, Champions League group stage Having succeeded Gérard Houllier 
at Liverpool in the summer, Benítez needed to cancel out a 1-0 defeat in the 
away game with the Greek side to secure a place in the Champions League 
knockout stages. Things looked bleak when Rivaldo put the visitors in front but 
goals from the second-half substitutes Neil Mellor and Florent Sinama-Pongolle 
put Liverpool ahead on the night though behind on away goals. Steven Gerrard’s 
stunning late strike saw them through.

Liverpool 1-0 Chelsea

3 May 2005, Champions League semi-final second leg “You can say the linesman’s 
scored. It was a goal coming from the moon or from the Anfield Road stands” – 
this was José Mourinho’s verdict on the goal that caused the birth of a bitter 
rivalry. Luis García’s controversial “ghost goal” put Liverpool through to a 
first European Cup final for 20 years, though the referee said that had the 
linesman not signalled that the ball had crossed the line then Petr Cech would 
have been sent off for taking out Milan Baros.

Milan 3-3 Liverpool (aet, Liverpool win 3-2 on penalties)

25 May 2005, Champions League final Arguably the defining moment in Benítez’s 
career. Liverpool were trailing 3-0 at half-time to a superb Milan side but 
goals from Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso in a six-minute spell drew 
them level. Jerzy Dudek’s penalty shootout heroics won Liverpool the famous 
trophy for a fifth time.

Liverpool fought back through Djibril Cissé and Gerrard. Paul Konchesky put the

trophy.

18 December 2010, Club World Cup final Replacing Mourinho is no easy task, 
least of all after a treble season. Benítez’s spell in Italy proved difficult 
as he struggled to get the most from an ageing Inter side. The highlight was a 
Club World Cup trophy secured in Abu Dhabi, to add to a SuperCoppa Italiana.

Benfica 1-2 Chelsea 

15 March 2013, Europa League final “Chelsea is a big club with fantastic 
players, every manager wants to coach such a big team. But I would never take 
that job, in respect for my former team at Liverpool.” So said Benítez in 2007. 
Five years later he was at Chelsea, as interim coach after Roberto Di Matteo’s 
dismissal. Never a popular appointment, he did however win a trophy, Branislav 
Ivanovic’s stoppage-time header securing a second success in Europe’s second 
competition.

Fiorentina 1-3 Napoli 

13 May 2014, Coppa Italia A second stint in Italy delivered more trophies for 
Benítez. A brace from Lorenzo Insigne and a Dries Mertens effort sealing 
Italian cup success. A Supercoppa Italiana victory over Juventus followed 
before his dismissal in 2015.
