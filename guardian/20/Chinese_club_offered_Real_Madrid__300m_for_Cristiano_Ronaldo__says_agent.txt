Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has claimed that his client has 
rejected a deal from an un-named Chinese club that would have involved offering
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> €300m to sign the 
Portuguese forward and paying him more than €100m a year in wages.

“Money is not everything; the Spanish club is his life,” Mendes told Sky 
Sports Italia. “The Chinese market is a new market. They can buy a lot of 
players, but then again it is impossible to go for Ronaldo. Cristiano is the 
best player in the world and best ever. It is normal to have some offers.

“He won the European Championship with Portugal, it’s like winning the Italian 
league with Genoa: they were not the favourite.”

The transfer offer, if genuine, would eclipse the world record £93.2m
