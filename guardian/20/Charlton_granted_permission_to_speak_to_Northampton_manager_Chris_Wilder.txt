“Northampton Town Football Club can confirm that this morning the club 
received an official approach from Charlton Athletic Football Club for the 
services of manager Chris Wilder and assistant manager Alan Knill,”read a 
statement on the club’s website

 on Monday.

“Due to release clauses in their existing contracts, the club have regrettably 
given permission for talks to take place.

Kelvin Thomas, the chairman, added: “As is common knowledge I have an 
excellent relationship with both Chris and Alan, and we as a club and myself 
personally would obviously be very sorry to see them go.

“We had already begun discussions about much-improved new deals, but I think 
it is fair to say we would not be able to match both the salary and the playing 
budget for next season that a club the size of Charlton could offer.

“We have known for a while that Chris and Alan would be targets due to the 
fantastic success they have achieved, and together we have already turned down 
some interest from other clubs, but after discussions this morning I respect 
their decision to meet Charlton.”

However, Wilder, the former Sheffield United defender who has also managed 
Oxford, admitted that he faced a tough decision. “My relationship with the 
chairman and the fans is going to make this a very difficult decision, but I do 
feel at this stage of my career it is one I need to explore,” he said.
