The news at 10!

Well, 9.42pm. And these games are now all over! Here are your headlines in 
full:

 * Portugal were thumped 2-0 by Switzerland! But they didn’t have Ronaldo, and 
Group B looks pretty straightforward, so it’s probably non-disastrous. 
 * France, facing a scrap with Sweden and Holland for a single automatic 
qualifying berth in a nasty-looking Group A, couldn’t score against Belarus! 
But didn’t concede either! 
 * Luckily for Les Bleus neither Sweden nor Holland took advantage, drawing as 
they did 1-1. 
 * Belgium won a game despite having Roberto Martínez in charge! But it was 
against Cyprus!

 * Two goals in the space of 70 stoppage time seconds threatened to give, and 
then denied, Luxembourg a point in Bulgaria! (I’ve just seen Tonev’s winner, 
and it was asweet strike).

 * Bosnia & Herzegovina smashed Estonia 5-0, Emir Spahic grabbing the last in 
stoppage time. 
 * Belarus have an eye-catching new kit that looks like your grandma helped to 
knit it  No joy for Nani and Portugal in Basel. Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA

GOAL! And another GOAL! Bulgaria 4-3 Luxembourg!

Luxembourg have somehow contrived to equalise in the last minute against 
Bulgaria, and still lose – Aleksandar Tonev with the even laster minute winner!

the right, but the referee decides he fouledVictor Lindelöf in doing so! A

GOAL! Cyprus 0-3 Belgium (Carrasco, 81 mins)

You’ve got to feel for Kostas Panayi. He keeps pulling off decent saves, and 
Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> keep scoring from them. 
The latest keeps out De Bruyne’s low effort from just outside the penalty area, 
but the ball is immediately thumped back across goal and Carrasco turns in!

GOAL! Bosnia & Herzegovina 3-0 Estonia (Medunjanin, 71 mins)

I do love the post-corner volley-thump. It’s among my very favourite goal

Joachim is the first Luxembourg player to score two goals in a competitive 
away game, apparently. And it only took him three minutes.

GOALS! Three of them! And now it's Bulgaria 2-2 Luxembourg

Aurelien Joachim scored twice in three minutes to put Luxembourg 2-1 up in 
Bulgaria, but then they conceded three minutes later and the score is thus 2-2.

GOAL! Sweden 1-1 Holland (Sneijder, 67 mins)

The captain grabs the equaliser! Yet another rebound. Janmaat cuts in from the 
right and shoots low across goal with his left foot, and the keeper does well 
to push it clear, only for Sneijder to latch onto the ball and stroke it into 
the opposite corner.

GOAL! Cyprus 0-2 Belgium (Lukaku, 61 mins)

Um, not so ragged then. Lukaku feasts on scraps again, heading in the loose 
ball after the keeper pushes Yannick Carrasco’s fierce shot away from goal. He 
did look suspiciously – but narrowly – offside when the shot came in, mind.

Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> are looking ragged in 
Cyprus, though they still lead 1-0. Fellaini has a little nibble at Pieros 
Sotiriou’s ankles and is booked, and the Cypriots have a shooting chance from 
25 yards.

GOAL! Andorra 0-1 Latvia (Sabala, 48 mins)

Bit late on this one as well, but I’ve only just seen this. It’s a long cross 
from the right wing, and the goalkeeper edges forwards to prepare for a 
possible save only to be stuck in no man’s land as Valerijs Sabala sends his 
header looping over him and into an empty net.

“Dzeko actually celebrated the goal by saying ‘I love deaf people’ in sign 
language to the camera, which is related to some of the charity work he did in

writes Mak Imamovic. “As for what Ledley King has to do with any of that, I’m 
as baffled as you.”

Some linguistic clarification from Andreas Broman, who tells me that 
“’Brytning’ could be ‘mining’ but here it means ‘clearance’”. So there you go.

“You can really tell that assistant referee Lorenzo Manganelli (currently 
working the touchline in theSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden>
 v Netherlands game) wants to be a professional footballer by the state of his 
hair,” writes JR. “His hairdo is even more ridiculous than any of the players. 
He looks like he went to the barber and said “Give me a cross between the 
‘Chamakh’ and the ‘Flock of Seagulls’.” You should make an effort to get a 
glimpse of his head. I find it fascinating.” I will make that effort, JR.

GOAL! Gibraltar 1-4 Greece (Torosidis, 45 mins)

I’m afraid that in all the excitement I’ve missed not one, or even two, or for 
that matter three, but four whole goals in Gibraltar. In my defence, three of 
them came in the space of 120 seconds. Liam Walker equalised for the home side 
in the 26th minute, and with one minute of the first half remaining it remained 
1-1. But then Scott Wiseman scored an own goal in the 44th minute, Konstantinos 
Fortounis put Greece 3-1 up in the 45th, and Vasilios Torosidis has added a 
fourth in stoppage time.

You can now see the moment the Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belarus> kit was unveiled for the first 
time.Damn right they applauded. I encourage you to stay tuned for the 
performance of some loud music (16:53), and whatever you do don’t miss the shot 
of audience members clapping along after 18 minutes and 58 seconds, which sums 
up the enthusiasm in the room at this historic moment. If you want some 
close-ups of the home kit, fast forward to precisely 20 minutes in.

GOAL! Sweden 1-0 Holland (Berg, 43 mins)

Oh my! That is just insane defending from Strootman. He’s not under much 
pressure, with only Marcus Berg standing behind him, but instead of booting 
clear, or passing to anyone else, he turns into trouble, Berg steals the ball, 
and then the Panathinaikos player scores with a fabulous chip from the edge of 
the area.

Bulgaria are a goal up against Luxembourg, Dimitar Rangelov scoring with what 
I’m hearing was a pretty special strike.

And that is very much your lot! It’s been a blast, truly it has. Thanks for 
being there. Bye!
 
Well, 9.42pm. And these games are now all over! Here are your headlines in 
full:

 * Portugal were thumped 2-0 by Switzerland! But they didn’t have Ronaldo, and 
Group B looks pretty straightforward, so it’s probably non-disastrous. 
 * France, facing a scrap with Sweden and Holland for a single automatic 
qualifying berth in a nasty-looking Group A, couldn’t score against Belarus! 
But didn’t concede either! 
 * Luckily for Les Bleus neither Sweden nor Holland took advantage, drawing as 
they did 1-1. 
 * Belgium won a game despite having Roberto Martínez in charge! But it was 
against Cyprus!

 * Two goals in the space of 70 stoppage time seconds threatened to give, and 
then denied, Luxembourg a point in Bulgaria! (I’ve just seen Tonev’s winner, 
and it was asweet strike).

 * Bosnia & Herzegovina smashed Estonia 5-0, Emir Spahic grabbing the last in 
stoppage time. 
 * Belarus have an eye-catching new kit that looks like your grandma helped to 
knit it  No joy for Nani and Portugal in Basel. Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA  
Luxembourg have somehow contrived to equalise in the last minute against 
Bulgaria, and still lose – Aleksandar Tonev with the even laster minute winner!
 
And Michy Batshuayi has missed a penalty for Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>, seeing his weak sidefooter kept 
out by Cyprus’s Kostas Panayi – and for once nobody scores from the rebound!
 
More drama to report: Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland> remain 2-0 up against Portugal 
but Granit Xhaka has been sent off for a second bookable offence.

Disallowed goal! In the last minute of the game Bas Dost heads in a cross from 
the right, but the referee decides he fouledVictor Lindelöf in doing so! A 
very soft decision, that.
 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> have one more minute of 
stoppage time in which to score a goal.
 
The night’s most emphatic victory – further Greek goals in Gibraltar 
notwithstanding – will be Bosnia’s, after Ibisevic thumped in the fourth 
against Estonia.
 
“Hey! Leave Charalambides alone!” yells Luke Pulfer. “Sure, they’re a tad 
pretentious, and ‘difficult’ listening, but I’ll not have that condescension 
from this organ’s football writers that as recently as four years ago were
extolling the merits of Shakira’s Waka Waka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/06/football-songs-championship>.” I 
had nothing to do with that.When it comes to football songs I did quite like 
this one, though:
 
The Bulgarians have turned matters around, Ivelin Popov putting them back in 
front with a fine 20-odd-yard free-kick.
 
You’ve got to feel for Kostas Panayi. He keeps pulling off decent saves, and 
Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> keep scoring from them. 
The latest keeps out De Bruyne’s low effort from just outside the penalty area, 
but the ball is immediately thumped back across goal and Carrasco turns in!
 
“I’m afraid I’ve not been paying attention,” writes Charles Antaki. “Are 
France playing tonight, and is anyone scoring or doing anything notable in that 
match?” They are playing, but unconvincingly: still in search of a breakthrough 
inBelarus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belarus>, they’ve just taken 
off Giroud and replaced him with Kévin Gameiro.

“Just watched the video of that King tackle,” writes Tony Waters. “Superb 
tackle, but one thing mystifies me: Why didn’t Robben dive? Quite 
extraordinary. Did he ever consider the effect on his reputation?”
 
I do love the post-corner volley-thump. It’s among my very favourite goal 
categories. And this is a fine addition to the canon:

Well, kind of, but also not really.
 
Joachim is the first Luxembourg player to score two goals in a competitive 
away game, apparently. And it only took him three minutes.
 
Aurelien Joachim scored twice in three minutes to put Luxembourg 2-1 up in 
Bulgaria, but then they conceded three minutes later and the score is thus 2-2.
 
The captain grabs the equaliser! Yet another rebound. Janmaat cuts in from the 
right and shoots low across goal with his left foot, and the keeper does well 
to push it clear, only for Sneijder to latch onto the ball and stroke it into 
the opposite corner.

“As you said earlier that song by a Texan group called Charalambide, the 
namesake of the captain ofCyprus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cyprus>, 
starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and ends up at the same place,” writes Michael 
Cosgrove. “Now that really takes some doing and I am at a complete loss to 
think of any piece of music that is as quaintly and amusingly boring as that. 
Can anybody help?” I for one can think of nothing that betters it.
 
Um, not so ragged then. Lukaku feasts on scraps again, heading in the loose 
ball after the keeper pushes Yannick Carrasco’s fierce shot away from goal. He 
did look suspiciously – but narrowly – offside when the shot came in, mind.
 
Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> are looking ragged in 
Cyprus, though they still lead 1-0. Fellaini has a little nibble at Pieros 
Sotiriou’s ankles and is booked, and the Cypriots have a shooting chance from 
25 yards.
 
Bit late on this one as well, but I’ve only just seen this. It’s a long cross 
from the right wing, and the goalkeeper edges forwards to prepare for a 
possible save only to be stuck in no man’s land as Valerijs Sabala sends his 
header looping over him and into an empty net.
 
And now Sissoko passes inside to Griezmann, who swings his left foot and 
completely misses the ball. Still, chances aplenty.

Borisov. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images  
And from the corner – this one is taken by Payet – Giroud heads against the 
bar!
 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> have just brought Dimitri 
Payet on in place of Martial, and within seconds Andrei Gorbunov makes an 
excellent save from a fine free kick, though it was Griezmann who struck it.
 
In Bern, João Mário gets into the penalty area and flings himself to the 
floor, somehow getting away without a booking.
 
France are still labouring in Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belarus>, where Giroud has just shot 
wide. According to Uefa statistics, they have had all three of the night’s 
shots on target, though.
 
If you’re not in St Jakob-Park tonight, you’ve missed out:

2016 <https://twitter.com/brianhomewood/status/773244763499888640>  
The games have restarted after half-time, and Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> have made two changes at the 
break, bringing on João Mário and André Silva and taking off William Carvalho 
and Eder.
 
Max tells me that rather than being about a clearance, “the Ledley King 
reference goes back to that tackle on Arjen Robben a couple of years ago”. And 
what a tackle it was.
 
“Dzeko actually celebrated the goal by saying ‘I love deaf people’ in sign 
language to the camera, which is related to some of the charity work he did in 
the last couple of days and his promise to do something for them if he scores,” 
writes Mak Imamovic. “As for what Ledley King has to do with any of that, I’m 
as baffled as you.”
 
Some linguistic clarification from Andreas Broman, who tells me that 
“’Brytning’ could be ‘mining’ but here it means ‘clearance’”. So there you go.
 
“You can really tell that assistant referee Lorenzo Manganelli (currently 
working the touchline in theSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sweden>
 v Netherlands game) wants to be a professional footballer by the state of his 
hair,” writes JR. “His hairdo is even more ridiculous than any of the players. 
He looks like he went to the barber and said “Give me a cross between the 
‘Chamakh’ and the ‘Flock of Seagulls’.” You should make an effort to get a 
glimpse of his head. I find it fascinating.” I will make that effort, JR.

I’m afraid that in all the excitement I’ve missed not one, or even two, or for 
that matter three, but four whole goals in Gibraltar. In my defence, three of 
them came in the space of 120 seconds. Liam Walker equalised for the home side 
in the 26th minute, and with one minute of the first half remaining it remained 
1-1. But then Scott Wiseman scored an own goal in the 44th minute, Konstantinos 
Fortounis put Greece 3-1 up in the 45th, and Vasilios Torosidis has added a 
fourth in stoppage time.
 
You can now see the moment the Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belarus> kit was unveiled for the first 
time.Damn right they applauded. I encourage you to stay tuned for the 
performance of some loud music (16:53), and whatever you do don’t miss the shot 
of audience members clapping along after 18 minutes and 58 seconds, which sums 
up the enthusiasm in the room at this historic moment. If you want some 
close-ups of the home kit, fast forward to precisely 20 minutes in.
 
Oh my! That is just insane defending from Strootman. He’s not under much 
pressure, with only Marcus Berg standing behind him, but instead of booting 
clear, or passing to anyone else, he turns into trouble, Berg steals the ball, 
and then the Panathinaikos player scores with a fabulous chip from the edge of 
the area.
 
It was a pretty decent hit from Rangelov – no curl involved, just pure speed. 
Blammo!
 
The Swiss extend their lead on the counter-attack, Admir Mehmedi taking a 
touch before sidefooting into the top corner from 16 yards.
 
Bulgaria are a goal up against Luxembourg, Dimitar Rangelov scoring with what 
I’m hearing was a pretty special strike.
