 on Saturday, a ninth-minute lead at the Camp Nou but Messi hit back four 
minutes later. He put Barça ahead with a free-kick just before half-time and 
set up Gerard Piqué to make it 3-1 soon after the interval.

Messi set up Neymar for the fourth goal after Espanyol’s Hernán Pérez and 
Papakouly Diop had been sent off, and Caicedo and Marco Asensio went off 
injured.

Arda Turan, who joined from Atlético Madrid in the summer but has only just 
been registered due to the Spanish champions’ transfer ban, made his first 
start for Barça, while Aleix Vidal, who moved from Sevilla in June, also made 
his first appearance when he came off the bench.
