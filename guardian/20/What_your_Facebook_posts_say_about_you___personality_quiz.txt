How much does your Facebook activity say about you? Try answering the 
following:

How often do you post about each of these topics on Facebook (or your social 
media of choice)? Answer never, rarely, sometimes or often

 *  Your social activities (eg nights out)

 *  Your everyday life 
 *  Intellectual topics (eg science articles) 
 *  Your partner 
 *  Your children 
 *  Your achievements, diets and exercise 
A 2015 study of 555 brave volunteers (at London’s Brunel University) explored 
the relationship between people’s Facebook updates and various personality 
measures.

The results, predictably, found people who often post about their social 
activities and everyday life tend to be extroverts. However, people who often 
post about intellectual topics do not, as you might expect, show a tendency for 
introversion. What they do show is “openness to experience”, reflecting an 
interest in exploration generally (eg travel, new experiences, even risky 
behaviour), not just that of the intellectual kind.

People who frequently post about their partner tend to report low self-esteem, 
while those who often post about their children tend to score high on 
conscientiousness (ie they’re people who get things done). Those who post a lot 
about their achievements, diets and exercise show, unsurprisingly, a tendency 
towards narcissism, but these types of posts also get the most likes – at least 
according to the posters themselves.
