The Scottish Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup> holders 
Celtic will face Peterhead in the fourth round following Tuesday's draw at 
Hampden.

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, currently second behind 
Rangers in the SPL, will meet the Aberdeenshire side, who are currently second 
bottom of the Scottish Football League in the tie, which will take place on the 
weekend of 7-8 January.

Rangers also face an away match on the east coast, with Second Division 
Arbroath hosting the SPL champions. The Old Firm rivals were drawn together in 
the rehearsal, but there was only one all-SPL tie between the 36 clubs involved 
in the draw when it took place for real.

Inverness will host Dunfermline, while Hearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> were drawn to play the junior 
side Auchinleck Talbot and their city rivals Hibernian face a trip across the 
Forth to the Second Division leaders Cowdenbeath.

St Johnstone will host Brechin, Dundee United will travel to Airdrie, 
Kilmarnock will visit Dundee and St Mirren will play Hamilton, who were 
relegated from the top flight last term.

Aberdeen and Motherwell must wait until this weekend's replays are completed 
to discover their opponents. Aberdeen will face a trip to either Stranraer or 
Forfar, while Motherwell will host Elgin or Queen's Park.

The First Division leaders Ross County will play Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers 
will meet Morton, Falkirk will take on East Fife and Livingston will play 
either Ayr or Montrose. The reward for the junior side Culter should they win 
their replay with Partick is a fourth-round tie at home to Queen of the South.
