Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> United have 
sacked Russ Wilcox after a poor run of results.

The League One side have lost six of their last seven matches in all 
competitions, culminating in a 2-1 home defeat to Notts County in the 
Johnstone’s Paint Trophy

Wilcox, who took over last December following a spell as caretaker manager, 
led the club to promotion last season, finishing runners-up to Chesterfield in 
League Two.He also enjoyed a record-breaking 28-game unbeaten run

 for a manager’s first spell in charge, surpassing a feat set 125 years ago.

However, he had come under increasing pressure in recent weeks with the club 
winning just two of their 11 league games to sit second-bottom.

A statement on the club’s website 
<http://www.scunthorpe-united.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-october-2014-2004746.aspx>
 read: “Scunthorpe United have today terminated the contracts of manager Russ 
Wilcox and assistant manager John Schofield with immediate effect.

“The club would like to place on record their thanks to Russ and John for 
their efforts, but in particular to Russ for leading the Iron into League One. 
Andy Dawson will take charge of Saturday’s game at Gillingham, assisted by Tony 
Daws.”
