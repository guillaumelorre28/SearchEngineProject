With Valencia 1-0 down, Orban sent-off and Eibar being awarded a penalty, the 
visitors were staring down the barrel of a gun. But then Domenech saved the 
spot-kick and Valencia were transformed. Negredo came on to good effect, he was 
instrumental in the equaliser – you have to say that was a good substitution 
fromGary Neville <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville>. But for 
70 minutes they were awful: failing to register a shot on target all game: 
Andre Gomes’ goal was more of a tackle into the net.

This point takes Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> up 
to eighth – they are still seven points off the Champions League places. Eibar 
are also on 21 points, but they remain 10th.

Thanks for reading. See you!

Valencia manager Gary Neville lucky to draw 1-1 at Eibar in La Liga debut

Full-time: Eibar 1-1 Valencia

Considering how poor Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> 
were today, a point is not that bad a result for GNev.

close though, the ball flying just wide of Riesgo’s right-hand post.

RED CARD FOR RAMIS! Eibar are down to ten men!

Eibar press forward but overcommit, and Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> hit the home side on the 
counter-attack. Alcacer is left one-on-one with Ramis, and he simply can’t live 
with the Spanish striker, who sprints beyond the former Wigan defender, but is 
brought down right on the edge of the area. That’s a clear red card, Ramis was 
last man.

87 min: That’s a suckerpunch for Eibar: they pour forward looking for the 
winner. Corner. But Negredo is back there, working hard to clear the ball out 
of Valencia’s area. He’s made an impression since coming on from the bench.

GOAL! Eibar 1-1 Valencia (André Gomes 85)

This is one of the scrappiest goals you will see all season, but Neville won’t 
care one little bit. Negredo holds off three defenders and slips Andre Gomes 
in. The pass is too strong and Junca gets across the front of theValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> man, but Andre Gomes sticks a 
boot through the legs of the Eibar left back and somehow, from 12 yards out, 
tackles the ball into the net. Riesgo slips and is helpless to watch as the 
ball trickles over the line.

83 min: How many times has Piatti been kicked this second half? I can count 
half a dozen times he’s been chopped down. Javi Fuego is not happy and he let’s 
the referee just what he thinks, and sees yellow for kicking off. He’ll now 
miss Valencia’s next match at home to Getafe next Saturday.Eibar

80 min: Piatti is brought to the turf, can Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> conjure a decent set-piece 
delivery? Nope, Cancelo whacks his cross straight over the bar. That’s his 
third successive poor free-kick, the other two have failed to beat the first 
man.

PENALTY MISS! Domenech saves the penalty kick by Berjon!

Domenech dives to his left to claw out the shot, and then Baston misses the 
rebound, which bounced high but really should have been put away, skying his 
effort over the bar.

RED CARD! Valencia's Orban is sent off!

63 min: He’s had a shocker all day, and now he’s heading for an early bath! 
But this is never a red card, simply going shoulder to shoulder with Dani 
Garcia inside the area. The Eibar man wins the header, and there is contact 
afterwards, but Orban had his eyes on the ball all the way. There was no 
swinging arm, no elbow, maybe just a slight clash of heads. The referee sees it 
differently and awards Eibar a penalty! That is a terrible decision.Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> are incensed, especially 
Mustafi, who picks up a yellow card for dissent. Orban berates the fourth 
official as he marches off.

59 min: Eibar seem content to put 10 players behind the ball, and hit Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> on the counter-attack. The home 
side are making the pitch look very small at the moment, they are full of 
running.

56 min: Ramis, the Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> 
centre-back (formerly of Wigan), is very nearly charged down by Cancelo. He 
tries to play it out from the back, but eventually just resorts to hoofing it 
clear. Probably the right decision. Good pressing by Cancelo.

53 min: Piatti has definitely made a differences since he has come on at 
half-time. He is linking nicely with Valencia’s midfield three now. Andre Gomes 
shows some quick feet on the edge and is chopped down by Dani Garcia in a 
dangerous area, but Alcacer blasts the resulting free-kick into theEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> wall.

49 min: Negredo is going through his paces on the sidelines. His warm-up area 
just highlights how small this stadium is: just 5,500 at capacity. Just to put 
that into perspective: there are only three stadiums (Accrington Stanley, AFC 
Wimbledon, Fleetwood Town) that are smaller than Eibar’s in England’s 
professional leagues.

47 min: Keko goes to work on Orban again, bamboozling the left-back with a 
step-over. Orban scissor-tackles him down, an awful challenge, right on the 
edge of Valencia’s penalty box. Yellow card for Orban, he’s picked up where he 
left off in the first half. In Keko’s pocket. Berjon drives a low cross into 
the box, but it’s easily cleared.

Peeeeeep! We’re underway again. Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have indeed made a change: 
Piatti is on for De Paul, who picked up that silly yellow card in the first 
half.

Half-time: Eibar 1-0 Valencia

That was the last kick of the half. I would expect Neville to make changes at 
the break. Orban and Danilo in particular have been awful.

GOAL! Eibar 1-0 Valencia (Enrich 45)

Neville will be furious with Orban, his left back. He’s been all at sea all 
half, and is completely outpaced by Cana, who gets to the byline and rolls the 
ball across the six-yard box for Enrich to prod it on the slide. He was denied 
earlier this half in a similar position by that fantastic save by Domenech, but 
the goalkeeper could do nothing about it this time!

43 min: Eibar definitely finishing the half the stronger. The hold up play 
from their front two, Baston and Enrich, has been fantastic. Only some 
last-ditch defending has kept the score at 0-0.

He really doesn’t look the most comfortable on the ball.

36 min: Gary Neville is not a happy bunny, shouting and swearing on the 
touchline. The referee comes across and gives him a telling off. Not sure that 
Gary understood any of that.

32 min: De Paul is awarded a cheap free-kick on the left and as he dusts 
himself down to take the free-kick, starts berating the referee for not moving 
the wall back. And so the referee gives De Paul a yellow card. Stupid.

initially beat Dan Garcia to the ball and suddenlyValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> were three on two going foward, 
but Andre Gomes over-hit his through ball to Alcacer and Riesgo is able to come 
out and collect the ball.

whips in an early cross. Baston dummies it at the near post, and Enrich is 
nearly able to reach it, but Barragan gets across to nod it behind.

19 min: Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have found 
absolutely no fluency so far. They are struggling to string any kind of passes 
together. Occasionally Alcacer latches onto a long ball, but he’s too isolated 
at present, and Eibar are always able to get numbers behind the ball and break 
up play.

14 min: WHAT. A. SAVE. I am not kidding you, this is a contender for save of 
the season. Another outstanding cross comes in from the right from Keko, 
flashing across Valencia’s six-yard box. Valencia’s defenders don’t want to 
touch it, for fear of scoring an own goal, and Enrich is there at the back 
post, two yards out, to stab the ball i… no! Domenech somehow reacts and pushes 
the ball onto the post. Point-blank save! The ball rebounds out and Barragan 
hoofs it clear. Wow.
Michael [Valencia] (@VCF_Nordic) 
Valencia goalkeeper Jaume with a miracle save. Just another day at the office.

13 min: Outstanding wing play from Keko! The ponytailed winger nutmegs Orban 
drives to the byline and whips a wonderful cross to the near post. Baston dives 
in with his head, but Mustafi gets there just before theEibar

his hand?!) just six inches wide of Valencia’s left-hand post.

10 min: Domenech has made a very nervy start. He is nearly caught out with a 
clearance, and just manages to slice his kick away from the onrushing Baston, 
and then comes flapping for a cross. He gets nowhere near it, but luckily 
Mustafi heads clear. Domenech has played well of late, against Barcelona and 
Lyon, but this is still his rookie season withValencia

8 min: First glimpse of Nevilla on the sidelines: he’s rocking a Wenger-esque 
padded jacket. A surprise that, I expected Neville to be firmly in the 
suit-wearing manager camp, as he was in the Champions League on Wednesday.

6 min: One touch on the chest, one flick over the shoulder and suddenly 
Alcacer is away from his marker. He’s a class act, the Spanish international, 
but Cancelo’s cross is poor.

2 min: Junca, the Eibar left-back, gallops forward to latch onto an excellent 
ball down the line. Barragan, formerly of Liverpool, is caught way out of 
position at right-back and only a covering tackle from Mustafi halts Junca’s 
path to goal.Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> win a corner, 
with the ball breaking to Escalante, but the midfielder’s volley is well 
blocked by Orban.

Former Manchester City man Alvaro Negredo is on the bench for Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. He made a big-money move in 
the summer, but was ostracised by former manager Nuno after the striker 
criticised the tactics of the team. Against Lyon in mid-week, Neville handed 
him his first appearance in two months and had this to say about Negredo. He’s 
on the bench again today, but expect him to have more of an influence as the 
season progresses.

“Alvaro had a great impact in the Premier League, at [Manchester] City he was 
the perfect striker and I don’t see any reason why he can’t regain that level.”
 Gary Neville gives Alvaro Negredo some instructions before the striker came 
on against Lyon. Photograph: Alex Caparros/Getty Images

Neville has injury problems to contend with: Sofiane Feghouli, Enzo Perez, 
Antonio Barragan, Diego Alves and Rodrigo are all sidelined. His captain, Dani 
Parejo, is suspended although both Joao Cancelo and Javi Fuego return from 
their own respective bans. Javi Fuego is Neville’s stand-in captain for the day.

Eibar: Riesgo, Capa, Dos Santos, Ramis, Juncà, Escalante, Dani García, Borja, 
Berjón, Enrich, Keko
Subs: Irureta, Pantic, Inui, Arruabarrena, Hajrovic, Luna, Adrian

The absences of Goalkeeper Jaime Jimenez and Eddy Pascual (arguably the team’s 
most creative player) will hitEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>
 hard. They have lost two on the bounce.

Neville is learning Spanish – he has a lesson at 6am every morning – it will 
be interesting to see how long it takes for him to start using it in press 
conferences. But he’s doing his best to embed into Spanish culture …

“I’ve had paella every day. On Friday I had one in the centre of Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> with rabbit! For me, having a 
paella with rabbit is a bit weird. I’ve eaten octopus too, which is also weird 
for me but the food is really good.”

Other non-paella news: 

“I’ve watched a lot of video. [Eibar have] a typical British stadium and this 
type of ground is a physical and mental test.

“We have three analysts and we have three coaches. The analysts that were 
working with me towards Lyon moved ontoEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> [on Tuesday] so we’ve started 
preparation for that now.

“We’re playing catch-up from that point of view. The amount of preparation 
that I would do normally would be three or four weeks in advance. I’d be 
thinking about the games [in January] against Villarreal and Real Madrid right 
now, but we aren’t. That’s not what we’ve inherited here. I think things are 
different in Spain.”

Preamble

When Gary Neville <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville> delivers 
his first pre-match team-talk, in about half an hour from now, he will have to 
do so through the blare of the Alpha factory siren, which loudly sounds out 
across Eibar 30 minutes before each home game.

The siren was previously used to wake up Eibar’s inhabitants at 7.30am, to let 
them know it was time to go to work, but after the decline of industry in the 
town, it has been re-appropriated by the football club. Only 27,000 people live 
in the entire Basque town – less than half the amount that can fit into 
Valencia’s Mestalla stadium – which is nestled into the mountains between San 
Sebastián and Bilbao. It gives you some idea of the size of the place that one 
siren can be heard all across town. It is a rallying call that symbolises the 
interdependence between club and fan, and how the sport is deeply linked to the 
working-class roots of the people.
Guardian Football passport: the Eibar model 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/sep/03/eibar-model-another-kind-of-football-is-possible-passport-video>
It is a connection that Neville will desperately try to recreate at Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in the coming months. Under 
their former manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, the divide was rarely wider between 
the fans and the team. Peter Lim’s billions are yet to make any serious impact 
on Valencia’s league position.

Eibar currently sit in 10th position in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>, one place behind 
Valencia and level on points with Neville’s new club. Eibar’s budget last 
season was just £16m – transfers, wages, maintenance – roughly the amount of 
money that Valencia spent over the summer on their Aymen Abdennour, the 
centre-back bought from Monaco. The skewed TV revenues in Spain do nothing to 
help the minnows, and but this season Eibar are thriving, against all the odds.

Neville could have had an easier place to have his first league game in 
charge. Eibar have lost just two matches at home this season – to Real and 
Atlético Madrid – and whilst the task will not be as large as Phil faced last 
weekend against Barcelona (in which they came awaywith an excellent 1-1 draw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/05/valencia-barcelona-gary-neville-la-liga-match-report>
), this has the feeling of an upset waiting to happen. Valencia were awful in 
their 2-0 home defeat to Lyon in mid-week – Neville’s first match in charge
which saw them exit the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/09/valencia-lyon-champions-league-match-report-gary-neville>
. The Manchester man will have been busy with his whiteboard since then. Let’s 
see how much of an impact he has.

Kick off: 3pm GMT, 4pm in Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>.

With Valencia 1-0 down, Orban sent-off and Eibar being awarded a penalty, the 
visitors were staring down the barrel of a gun. But then Domenech saved the 
spot-kick and Valencia were transformed. Negredo came on to good effect, he was 
instrumental in the equaliser – you have to say that was a good substitution 
fromGary Neville <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville>. But for 
70 minutes they were awful: failing to register a shot on target all game: 
Andre Gomes’ goal was more of a tackle into the net.

This point takes Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> up 
to eighth – they are still seven points off the Champions League places. Eibar 
are also on 21 points, but they remain 10th.

Thanks for reading. See you!

Considering how poor Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> 
were today, a point is not that bad a result for GNev.
 
90+3 min: Can Alcacer snatch all three points for Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> from the free-kick? No! It was 
close though, the ball flying just wide of Riesgo’s right-hand post.
 
Eibar press forward but overcommit, and Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> hit the home side on the 
counter-attack. Alcacer is left one-on-one with Ramis, and he simply can’t live 
with the Spanish striker, who sprints beyond the former Wigan defender, but is 
brought down right on the edge of the area. That’s a clear red card, Ramis was 
last man.
 
90 min: Three minutes added on here. Can Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> hold on?
 
89 min: Eibar make their final change and it’s a surprising one: Hajrovic 
replaces Keko. Keko has been Eibar’s best player.
 
87 min: That’s a suckerpunch for Eibar: they pour forward looking for the 
winner. Corner. But Negredo is back there, working hard to clear the ball out 
of Valencia’s area. He’s made an impression since coming on from the bench.
 
This is one of the scrappiest goals you will see all season, but Neville won’t 
care one little bit. Negredo holds off three defenders and slips Andre Gomes 
in. The pass is too strong and Junca gets across the front of theValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> man, but Andre Gomes sticks a 
boot through the legs of the Eibar left back and somehow, from 12 yards out, 
tackles the ball into the net. Riesgo slips and is helpless to watch as the 
ball trickles over the line.
 
83 min: How many times has Piatti been kicked this second half? I can count 
half a dozen times he’s been chopped down. Javi Fuego is not happy and he let’s 
the referee just what he thinks, and sees yellow for kicking off. He’ll now 
miss Valencia’s next match at home to Getafe next Saturday.Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> make a change: Inui on for Berjon.
 
80 min: Piatti is brought to the turf, can Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> conjure a decent set-piece 
delivery? Nope, Cancelo whacks his cross straight over the bar. That’s his 
third successive poor free-kick, the other two have failed to beat the first 
man.
 
78 min: It’s been a game low on quality to be honest. That has suited Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>, who make their final change: 
Baston off, Adrian on.
 
75 min: Cana shows excellent pace to start and finish an Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> counter-attack, sprinting clear of 
Abdennour and forcing Domenech into a smart save. Meanwhile, Negredo is on! 
Neville is rolling the dice: Barragan, the right-back, is off.
 
73 min: Cracks are starting to form in Eibar’s defence. They are visibly 
nervous out there. Dani Garcia is forced to bring down Cancelo and he picks up 
a thirdEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> yellow card in four 
minutes.
 
71 min: Junca is the next Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> 
player to go into the book, this time for a handball.
 
70 min: Valencia appear galvanised by that penalty save. Piatti shows Capa a 
clean set of heels but is cynically brought down by theEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> right-back. Yellow card.
 
68 min: Neville makes a change straight away: Danilo off, Gaya on.

67 min: A reprieve for Neville and co then, but can they get something from 
this game? They’re down to 10 men.
 
Domenech dives to his left to claw out the shot, and then Baston misses the 
rebound, which bounced high but really should have been put away, skying his 
effort over the bar.
OptaJose (@OptaJose) 
100% - Jaume Domènech has saved all two of the penalties that he has faced in 
La Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> (2/2). Hero.
 <https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/676076964843814912> December 13, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/676076964843814912>  
63 min: He’s had a shocker all day, and now he’s heading for an early bath! 
But this is never a red card, simply going shoulder to shoulder with Dani 
Garcia inside the area. The Eibar man wins the header, and there is contact 
afterwards, but Orban had his eyes on the ball all the way. There was no 
swinging arm, no elbow, maybe just a slight clash of heads. The referee sees it 
differently and awards Eibar a penalty! That is a terrible decision.Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> are incensed, especially 
Mustafi, who picks up a yellow card for dissent. Orban berates the fourth 
official as he marches off.
 
61 min: Keko again sets down the right, and does well to win himself a corner 
off Abdennour. He swings another cross in. This time it’s cleared.
OptaJose (@OptaJose) 
23 - Eibar attempted 23 crosses against Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> (including corners), more than 
in any other first half of a La Liga game. Blizzard.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/676069271190024192>  
59 min: Eibar seem content to put 10 players behind the ball, and hit Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> on the counter-attack. The home 
side are making the pitch look very small at the moment, they are full of 
running.
 
56 min: Ramis, the Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> 
centre-back (formerly of Wigan), is very nearly charged down by Cancelo. He 
tries to play it out from the back, but eventually just resorts to hoofing it 
clear. Probably the right decision. Good pressing by Cancelo.
 
53 min: Piatti has definitely made a differences since he has come on at 
half-time. He is linking nicely with Valencia’s midfield three now. Andre Gomes 
shows some quick feet on the edge and is chopped down by Dani Garcia in a 
dangerous area, but Alcacer blasts the resulting free-kick into theEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> wall.
 
49 min: Negredo is going through his paces on the sidelines. His warm-up area 
just highlights how small this stadium is: just 5,500 at capacity. Just to put 
that into perspective: there are only three stadiums (Accrington Stanley, AFC 
Wimbledon, Fleetwood Town) that are smaller than Eibar’s in England’s 
professional leagues.

<https://twitter.com/sdeibar/status/676076133549502465>  
47 min: Keko goes to work on Orban again, bamboozling the left-back with a 
step-over. Orban scissor-tackles him down, an awful challenge, right on the 
edge of Valencia’s penalty box. Yellow card for Orban, he’s picked up where he 
left off in the first half. In Keko’s pocket. Berjon drives a low cross into 
the box, but it’s easily cleared.
 
Peeeeeep! We’re underway again. Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have indeed made a change: 
Piatti is on for De Paul, who picked up that silly yellow card in the first 
half.
 
Half-time advert entertainment: watch Gary and Phil (and a few other famous 
faces) have a kickabout on the roof of their new hotel.
 
That was the last kick of the half. I would expect Neville to make changes at 
the break. Orban and Danilo in particular have been awful.

Neville will be furious with Orban, his left back. He’s been all at sea all 
half, and is completely outpaced by Cana, who gets to the byline and rolls the 
ball across the six-yard box for Enrich to prod it on the slide. He was denied 
earlier this half in a similar position by that fantastic save by Domenech, but 
the goalkeeper could do nothing about it this time!

 <https://twitter.com/sdeibar/status/676065141084024832> December 13, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/sdeibar/status/676065141084024832>  
43 min: Eibar definitely finishing the half the stronger. The hold up play 
from their front two, Baston and Enrich, has been fantastic. Only some 
last-ditch defending has kept the score at 0-0.
 
40 min: Domenech scuffs another clearance straight to a Escalante in midfield. 
He really doesn’t look the most comfortable on the ball.
 
38 min: “Rapido, rapido!” shouts Neville. 
 
36 min: Gary Neville is not a happy bunny, shouting and swearing on the 
touchline. The referee comes across and gives him a telling off. Not sure that 
Gary understood any of that.
 
34 min: Valencia are struggling to create any chances, but they have begun to 
dominate possession. Eibar’s intensity has dropped a little.
 
32 min: De Paul is awarded a cheap free-kick on the left and as he dusts 
himself down to take the free-kick, starts berating the referee for not moving 
the wall back. And so the referee gives De Paul a yellow card. Stupid.
 
30 min: Eibar have the lowest average passing percentage in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> – 39% – but they are 
dominating the ball in this match. Concerning scenes for Neville.
 
28 min: Chance for Valencia! Oh, but it’s a terrible pass from Andre Gomes. He 
initially beat Dan Garcia to the ball and suddenlyValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> were three on two going foward, 
but Andre Gomes over-hit his through ball to Alcacer and Riesgo is able to come 
out and collect the ball.
 
25 min: Everything is coming down the right for Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>. This time, though, it’s Capa that 
whips in an early cross. Baston dummies it at the near post, and Enrich is 
nearly able to reach it, but Barragan gets across to nod it behind.
 
22 min: Player of the match so far is definitely Keko. He has Orban on toast 
at present. I’m struggling to comprehend how he thinks this haircut is a good 
idea, though.

<https://twitter.com/Keko_gontan/status/665591846404554752>  
19 min: Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have found 
absolutely no fluency so far. They are struggling to string any kind of passes 
together. Occasionally Alcacer latches onto a long ball, but he’s too isolated 
at present, and Eibar are always able to get numbers behind the ball and break 
up play.
 
16 min: Yellow card for Dos Santos, lunging in and catching De Paul late. 
Ouch. Deserved.
 
14 min: WHAT. A. SAVE. I am not kidding you, this is a contender for save of 
the season. Another outstanding cross comes in from the right from Keko, 
flashing across Valencia’s six-yard box. Valencia’s defenders don’t want to 
touch it, for fear of scoring an own goal, and Enrich is there at the back 
post, two yards out, to stab the ball i… no! Domenech somehow reacts and pushes 
the ball onto the post. Point-blank save! The ball rebounds out and Barragan 
hoofs it clear. Wow.

13 min: Outstanding wing play from Keko! The ponytailed winger nutmegs Orban 
drives to the byline and whips a wonderful cross to the near post. Baston dives 
in with his head, but Mustafi gets there just before theEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> man and deflects the ball (with 
his hand?!) just six inches wide of Valencia’s left-hand post.

12 min: The last five minutes have been all Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>. Their intensity is relentless at 
present. Let’s see how long they can keep this up.
 
10 min: Domenech has made a very nervy start. He is nearly caught out with a 
clearance, and just manages to slice his kick away from the onrushing Baston, 
and then comes flapping for a cross. He gets nowhere near it, but luckily 
Mustafi heads clear. Domenech has played well of late, against Barcelona and 
Lyon, but this is still his rookie season withValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>.
 
8 min: First glimpse of Nevilla on the sidelines: he’s rocking a Wenger-esque 
padded jacket. A surprise that, I expected Neville to be firmly in the 
suit-wearing manager camp, as he was in the Champions League on Wednesday.
 
6 min: One touch on the chest, one flick over the shoulder and suddenly 
Alcacer is away from his marker. He’s a class act, the Spanish international, 
but Cancelo’s cross is poor.
 
4 min: Abdennnour sticks an elbow in the back of Enrich. Ouch, that was nasty. 
Free-kick toEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>.
 
2 min: Junca, the Eibar left-back, gallops forward to latch onto an excellent 
ball down the line. Barragan, formerly of Liverpool, is caught way out of 
position at right-back and only a covering tackle from Mustafi halts Junca’s 
path to goal.Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> win a corner, 
with the ball breaking to Escalante, but the midfielder’s volley is well 
blocked by Orban.
 
Peeeeeep! And we’re off!
 
The teams are out! Eibar in their home blue and red stripes, Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in their white ensemble.
 
Former Manchester City man Alvaro Negredo is on the bench for Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. He made a big-money move in 
the summer, but was ostracised by former manager Nuno after the striker 
criticised the tactics of the team. Against Lyon in mid-week, Neville handed 
him his first appearance in two months and had this to say about Negredo. He’s 
on the bench again today, but expect him to have more of an influence as the 
season progresses.

“Alvaro had a great impact in the Premier League, at [Manchester] City he was 
the perfect striker and I don’t see any reason why he can’t regain that level.”

Neville has injury problems to contend with: Sofiane Feghouli, Enzo Perez, 
Antonio Barragan, Diego Alves and Rodrigo are all sidelined. His captain, Dani 
Parejo, is suspended although both Joao Cancelo and Javi Fuego return from 
their own respective bans. Javi Fuego is Neville’s stand-in captain for the day.

Berjón, Enrich, Keko
Subs: Irureta, Pantic, Inui, Arruabarrena, Hajrovic, Luna, Adrian

The absences of Goalkeeper Jaime Jimenez and Eddy Pascual (arguably the team’s 
most creative player) will hitEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>

Neville is learning Spanish – he has a lesson at 6am every morning – it will 
be interesting to see how long it takes for him to start using it in press 
conferences. But he’s doing his best to embed into Spanish culture …

“I’ve had paella every day. On Friday I had one in the centre of Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> with rabbit! For me, having a 
paella with rabbit is a bit weird. I’ve eaten octopus too, which is also weird 
for me but the food is really good.”

Other non-paella news: 

“I’ve watched a lot of video. [Eibar have] a typical British stadium and this 
type of ground is a physical and mental test.

“We have three analysts and we have three coaches. The analysts that were 
working with me towards Lyon moved ontoEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> [on Tuesday] so we’ve started 
preparation for that now.

“We’re playing catch-up from that point of view. The amount of preparation 
that I would do normally would be three or four weeks in advance. I’d be 
thinking about the games [in January] against Villarreal and Real Madrid right 
now, but we aren’t. That’s not what we’ve inherited here. I think things are 
different in Spain.”
 
When Gary Neville <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville> delivers 
his first pre-match team-talk, in about half an hour from now, he will have to 
do so through the blare of the Alpha factory siren, which loudly sounds out 
across Eibar 30 minutes before each home game.

The siren was previously used to wake up Eibar’s inhabitants at 7.30am, to let 
them know it was time to go to work, but after the decline of industry in the 
town, it has been re-appropriated by the football club. Only 27,000 people live 
in the entire Basque town – less than half the amount that can fit into 
Valencia’s Mestalla stadium – which is nestled into the mountains between San 
Sebastián and Bilbao. It gives you some idea of the size of the place that one 
siren can be heard all across town. It is a rallying call that symbolises the 
interdependence between club and fan, and how the sport is deeply linked to the 
working-class roots of the people.
Guardian Football passport: the Eibar model 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/sep/03/eibar-model-another-kind-of-football-is-possible-passport-video>
It is a connection that Neville will desperately try to recreate at Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in the coming months. Under 
their former manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, the divide was rarely wider between 
the fans and the team. Peter Lim’s billions are yet to make any serious impact 
on Valencia’s league position.

Eibar currently sit in 10th position in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>, one place behind 
Valencia and level on points with Neville’s new club. Eibar’s budget last 
season was just £16m – transfers, wages, maintenance – roughly the amount of 
money that Valencia spent over the summer on their Aymen Abdennour, the 
centre-back bought from Monaco. The skewed TV revenues in Spain do nothing to 
help the minnows, and but this season Eibar are thriving, against all the odds.

Neville could have had an easier place to have his first league game in 
charge. Eibar have lost just two matches at home this season – to Real and 
Atlético Madrid – and whilst the task will not be as large as Phil faced last 
weekend against Barcelona (in which they came awaywith an excellent 1-1 draw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/05/valencia-barcelona-gary-neville-la-liga-match-report>
), this has the feeling of an upset waiting to happen. Valencia were awful in 
their 2-0 home defeat to Lyon in mid-week – Neville’s first match in charge
which saw them exit the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/09/valencia-lyon-champions-league-match-report-gary-neville>
. The Manchester man will have been busy with his whiteboard since then. Let’s 
see how much of an impact he has.

Kick off: 3pm GMT, 4pm in Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>.
