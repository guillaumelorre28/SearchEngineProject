League Two's Fleetwood Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fleetwood-town> have signed the former 
Scotland captain Barry Ferguson on loan from their near-neighbours Blackpool.

The 34-year-old, who has won 45 caps for his country and played in the Premier 
League for Blackburn and Birmingham, will go straight into the squad for their 
FA Cup clash with Bromley at the Highbury Stadium.

"Barry is fantastic coup for the football club and a massive signing," 
Fleetwood Town's chairman Andy Pilley said. "His footballing credentials are 
second to none and this is a huge, huge day for Fleetwood Town

"Discussions have been held this week and Barry has really bought into the 
Highbury project, so much so he has taken a pay cut to drop into League Two.

"We are a hugely successful and progressive club and signing someone who has 
achieved so much in the game speaks volumes for our footballing aspirations."

Ferguson's first-team appearances have been limited this season under Ian 
Holloway. Having played 45 times last season, the midfielder has made just 
seven appearances so far in 2012-13.
