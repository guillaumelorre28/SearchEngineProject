Danny Boyle’s celebrated picture is rereleased in advance of its sequel, due 
in cinemas in two weeks. What’s interesting, viewing the film now, is how it 
manages to be both inarguably of its time, the mid 90s, but also has not dated 
nearly as badly as most youth culture movies tend to. This is at least partly 
due to Boyle’s canny music choices – Iggy Pop and Lou Reed already had their 
cool credentials established, while Underworld have maintained a credibility 
that owes something to their association with this film. What remains to be 
seen is how much Sick Boy’s unifying theory of life applies to theTrainspotting 
gang: “At one point, you’ve got it, then you lose it. Then it’s gone for ever.”
