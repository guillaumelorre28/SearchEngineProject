responded with Hernán Santana’s 38th-minute header from a corner, but Jesé 
closed the scoring before half-time with a well-struck right-footed shot from 
inside the area in the 43rd.

it was the third consecutive league victory for Real Madrid despite a host of 
injuries including the goalkeeper Keylor Navas, plus Sergio Ramos, James 
Rodríguez, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale.

Rafa Benítez’s team got off to a quick start on Saturday, with Isco firing 
into the far corner after a well-timed pass by the Brazilian defensive 
midfielder Casemiro. The Real captain Marcelo set up Ronaldo’s firm header from 
near the penalty spot, while Rodríguez cleared a defender inside the area 
before striking a low shot into the back of the net.

It was Ronaldo’s eighth league goal, tying him with Barcelona’s Neymar at the 
top of the league scoring chart. The Portuguese striker has scored 13 times in 
as many matches this season.

He had a great chance to add another in second-half injury time, but his shot 
from just in front of the goal was blocked by Las Palmas’ goalkeeper Javi Varas.

The Canary Islands side are left with only one victory this season and they 
have now lost four of their last five games.

The win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium keeps Madrid in the lead at the top 
of the league table with 24 points from 10 rounds. Barcelona can reach the same 
amount of points when they plays at Getafe on Sunday but the Catalan club have 
an significantly inferior goal difference.

Real now turn their focus to the Champions League Group A match against Paris 
Saint-Germain on Tuesday.
