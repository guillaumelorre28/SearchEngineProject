What are your hopes? Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
need to go further than the last 16. It’s been a long time since we’ve done it 
but if we want players such as Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez to sign new deals 
we’re going to have to show we’re making progress. A win in Paris would also 
send out a message against a PSG side who, on paper, look slightly weaker than 
they did last season.

What do you need to succeed? The key to a successful campaign is to keep the 
likes of Özil and Sanchez fit. We must also stop conceding sloppy goals and 
losing to teams we’re expected to beat – like we did last season. We’ve made 
two really good defensive signings in Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi. I’m 
hoping they both step up when it matters. We have goals in us but really need 
to shore up at the back.Marc Nellis

How far will you go? Winners


What are your hopes? Having come so close to winning the competition in two of 
the last three seasons, my hope is to win it this time. We’ve made a slow start 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/29/noisy-neighours-leganes-atletico-madrid-real>
 to the Primera this season, but the Champions League is a competition that 
suits Atlético, and Diego Simeone can play a very canny tactical game in the 
knockout stages. I think the team can go all the way this season. A repeat of 
last season’s final but with the opposite result would go down well!

What do you need to succeed? The defence has been rock solid for some time, so 
the key will be at the other end of the pitch. Will the likes of Kévin Gameiro 
and Antoine Griezmann be able to nick enough goals to allow Atleti to progress? 
I suspect they will, especially as I expect Gameiro to show better form in 
front of goal than Jackson Martínez managed in his spell at the club. 
Additionally, I really hope that progress in this season’s competition won’t be 
decided by Juanfran’s penalty-taking abilities.Will

How far will you go? Winners

What are your hopes? The key will be winning Group C. After that, we should 
have no problem in the round of 16 and quarter-finals. Semi-finals should be 
our minimal goal, with an added expectation of getting to the final and win the 
title again. Hopes are high.

What do you need to succeed? Having Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar fit 
and healthy is going to play a crucial part. I also think the club have 
invested well in the squad over the summer. This should increase our chances of 
success both domestically and in Europe.Jordi Brunet Espuela

How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? We usually do well against English clubs in the Champions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>, so while 
matching PSG will be a stretch, we can cause a nervy-looking Arsenal problems. 
There’s no real pressure on us to do well and that will work in Basel’s favour.

What do you need to succeed? For us to have a successful campaign we need to 
work hard as a team and be compact at the back. We can’t afford to concede any 
sloppy goals.Botteron

How far will you go? Quarter-finals

What are your hopes? We should be aiming to top Group E, with Tottenham the 
only real serious challengers for the top spot. Monaco andCSKA Moscow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cskamoscow> look beatable, although 
travelling to Russia is always tough. I would possibly take a draw there as 
long as we get all three points in our home game. I’m looking forward to the 
trip to London.

What do you need to succeed? If we do well in the group stage, there’s nothing 
to suggest we won’t be able to reach the quarter-finals at the very least. Our 
attack of Javier Hernández and Kevin Volland is as good a strikeforce as any on 
their day. And our Slovenian midfield genius Kevin Kampl will do a great job as 
always. I have high hopes for the team this year.Albert Röpke

How far will you go? Final

What are your hopes? Carlo Ancelotti is here to do what Pep Guardiola couldn’t 
manage – win the Champions League. Naturally injuries will play a major factor 
but our squad looks better and Ancelotti’s laid back approach seems better 
suited to the team. In fairness, I would be satisfied with a final appearance 
but anything less would have to be seen as a failure.

What do you need to succeed? Injuries have been key for us in recent 
campaigns, but it’s particularly crucial to keep Jérôme Boateng fit. Without 
him our defence looks worryingly slow. A little bit of me is hoping to see Javi 
Martínez pushed back into midfield as I have fond memories of him playing there 
in 2013 persist. Arturo Vidal is looking like he has become central to our 
side. I am very much looking forward to his performances this season.Jonny

How far will you go? Quarter-finals

What are your hopes? After a year’s absence it would be nice to re-establish 
ourselves on the main European stage. That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy our 
Europa League campaign last season, until thepainful defeat against Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report>
 in the quarter-final. Every professional sports team is constantly changing. 
Dortmund are no exception from that rule. We had a terrific domestic season 
last year and have signed very well since the departure of Mats Hummels.

What do you need to succeed? Thomas Tuchel is one of the best coaches in 
Europe and, with experienced international players such as Marco Reus and Andrè 
Schürrle, the BvB should surely pass the group stage. The players will need to 
stay hungry for each of the group games though; there’s no room for 
complacency. If all goes to plan, anything less than the quarter-finals this 
season will be a disappointment.Jens

Borussia Mönchengladbach

How far will you go? Group stage

What are your hopes? I expect us to fall well short of the knockout stage. 
Getting the better of both Barcelona andManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> will be too tough a 
challenge for us. We should be able to leave Celtic behind us and reach the 
Europa League though, which would be a fantastic achievement.

What do you need to succeed? Our team cannot only play possession football but 
our pacey wingers mean we’re also extremely dangerous on the counter-attack. In 
recent yearsBorussia Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> have been a bit 
naive when playing against the big teams. If they’re able to play a bit smarter 
and keep their concentration throughout the full 90 minutes this time around, 
they might even be able to exceed expectations. For now though I’m keeping my 
feet on the ground.Dominik Marcel van Treel

Benfica


How far will you go? Quarter-finals

What are your hopes? I expect Benfica to make it through a group featuring 
Besiktas,Dynamo Kyiv <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dynamokyiv> and 
Napoli. Last year we managed to beat finalists Atletico Madrid, who were in our 
group, so this year it may be easier navigating our way out of Group B.

What do you need to succeed? As the most expensive signing from one Portuguese 
club to another, Rafa Silva comes from Braga with a big reputation and a 
rightfully earned one. His acceleration and overall intelligence is something 
that we will be needing following Renato Sanches’s departure. We managed to 
keep defender Victor Lindelöf, who will only get better following his great 
performances last year. Truth be toldBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are a club that constantly have 
a huge turnout of players year in and year out,so every year it seems we start 
from scratch. This time around our most potent attackers Konstantinos Mitroglou 
and Jonas have also stayed.Miguel

Besiktas


How far will you go? Round of 16


What are your hopes? While Group B looks very competitive, Besiktas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/besiktas> have a well structured and 
balanced team that can get through it. We are constantly improving and have a 
good mix of talented young players who are capable of exciting the crowd and 
internationally experienced players who can keep the team grounded when 
concentration and discipline is needed.

What do you need to succeed? The performance of our defenders is key. Also, if 
midfielder Oğuzhan Özyakup and promising Brazilian Anderson Talisca find the 
right tune, Besiktas could surprise football fans across Europe with their 
displays. The group is also tricky and balanced group. Benfica, Dynamo Kiev and 
Napoli are also well organised and tough teams. However, in a group with no 
clear favourites Besiktas could progress.Devin Bahceci

Celtic

How far will you go? Group stage 

What are your hopes? Having experienced three years out of the competition, 
the fact thatCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have made it 
is an achievement in itself. Not only does this bring some serious financial 
gain to the coffers, it will bring a rocking atmosphere back to Parkhead. This 
was missing during the dreary and highly unproductive years of Norwegian head 
coach Ronny Deila.

Despite all his flaws, Brendan Rodgers has seemed to reinvigorate our team 
with smart signings such as Kolo Touré and hot prospect Moussa Dembélé, along 
with re-establishing a swagger to our attacking displays which was desperately 
lacking under Deila. Ten goals in the first three games of the new season 
demonstrates the excitement that he has brought back to our football. With some 
nervy and stuttering performances against minnows in the playoffs (losing the 
first leg to Gibraltar’s Lincoln Red Imps was not a highlight!), Celtic will 
find it extremely difficult to compete with the highly talented Borussia 
Monchengladbach, the financial might of Manchester City and the little team 
from Catalonia calledBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>.

Our defensive ineptitude will be sorely tested against teams of this calibre, 
especially in our away performances which in the playoffs were meek and timid. 
Rodgers also has a poor record on the European stage, with Liverpool’s dreadful 
exit in the 2014 Champions League highlighting his team’s lack of coherent 
defensive structure and plan. So although I think that it will be highly 
unlikely that we get out of the group, I am just thrilled to have high-quality 
football back at Parkhead with a quality manager. You never know, we could pull 
a surprise against one of the big boys!

What do you need to succeed? In order to have any chance at getting out of the 
group, Leigh Griffiths needs to replicate the form that he has demonstrated 
both for Hibernian and Celtic. His goals will be sorely needed for us to be 
competitive against this horrendously tough group. Tom Rogic has been terrific 
for us since his return from injury and his creative spark in the centre of the 
pitch will be very important.Adam Winters

CSKA Moscow


How far will you go? Quarter-finals

What are your hopes? Our head coach Leonid Slutsky had a dreadful summer with 
Russia at Euro 2016, but we’re delighted he chose to return to CSKA. With him 
in charge we could aim for the quarter-finals, like we did during his first 
epic campaign in 2009.

What do you need to succeed? We need to be strong at the back, and the 
defensive belt of goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev and central defenders Vasili 
Berezutskiy and Sergei Ignashevich need to be much more solid than it was for 
the national team in France. We have a strong midfield containing Bibras 
Natcho, a fit again Alan Dzagoev, Roman Eremenko, Pontus Wernbloom and Zoran 
Tosic. Aleksei Ionov’s season-long loan from poor relegated Dynamo Moscow can 
also be a game changer.L dos Santos

Club Brugge


How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? Club Brugge are in the Champions League group stage for 
the first time in 11 years. We’re happy with the draw too; there are no 
superpowers in Group G and it looks like anyone could beat anyone. While we 
want to make the most of our chance, I’d be happy with keeping one of the other 
teams behind us and qualify for the Europa League. But I imagine that, aside 
fromPorto <https://www.theguardian.com/football/porto>, fans from the other 
teams all think their team have done well to get so far and are happy to bow 
out in the group stage. But someone has to progress and I don’t see why it 
can’t be us.

What do you need to succeed? Head coach Michel Preud’homme was a legend as a 
player and is held in high regard after getting us into this year’s 
competition. The only real worry for Brugge fans is that we’ve struggled 
domestically this season. Three defeats in six league games is well below par 
and nowhere near the level that earned us the Belgian Pro League title last 
season. Keep an eye out for our impressive Colombian winger Jose Izquierdo who 
has recently returned from injury. He has the ability to cause our opponents 
lots of defensive headaches. I’m going to stay optimistic and say we’ll sneak 
through, before falling down to earth with a bump at the Nou Camp in the 
earliest knock-out stage.Louis

FC Copenhagen


How far will you go? Group stage

What are your hopes? Our main objective has to be maintaining the brilliant 
home record in the club’s fourth Champions League appearance. In the nine games 
played at Parken we have won five of them – defeating Manchester United, 
Celtic, Rubin Kazan, Panathinaikos and Galatasaray – drawn three – against 
Benfica, Barcelona and Juventus – and only lost once – againstReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>. The flipside of this must be 
to rectify our awful away record, where we have come away with just the one 
victory and eight miserable defeats.

What do you need to succeed? Keeping Parken a fortress will require maximum 
concentration at the back, with some individual brilliance in attack. We have a 
multinational group of younger players, and almost everyone is playing for 
their national sides. Coach Stale Solbakken has steadied the ship after coming 
back from his unsuccessful spells at Cologne and Wolverhampton. He has the 
Champions League experience the younger players lacks. If Copenhagen can win 
one of the home matches and avoid defeat in the two others it should be 
possible to see European football at Parken next spring in the Europa League – 
but my hopes are not much higher than that. Having said that, I’m very happy 
with being teamed up withLeicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity>, Porto and Brugge. The 
draw could not have been more favourable for us and we’ll have a chance against 
all of them.Lars Bøgegaard

Dinamo Zagreb


How far will you go? Group stage

What are your hopes? Last season’s Champions League campaign was extremely 
disappointing. A 2-1 home victory against Arsenal 2-1 was as good as it got as 
we finished fourth in the group. Having scraped through to a tough looking 
Group H by narrowly overcoming Red Bull Salzburg, my hopes of reaching the 
knockout stage is zero.

What do you need to succeed? The form of our attacking midfielder Ante Coric 
will be absolutely key if we’re to get any goals, but it will take a miracle to 
avoid another group stage debacle. Our team is that weak.Igor

Dynamo Kyiv 


How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? Last year was a fantastic campaign for Dynamo as they 
reached the knockout stages for the first time since 1998-99. The renaissance 
under Serhiy Rebrov has been brilliant, with two titles and the European run. 
So the hope is that they will once again make it out of the group, although 
this time it may be more difficult given the level of the opposition.

What do you need to succeed? The key to Champions League success is winning at 
home. The group is really difficult with four evenly balanced sides. Ukraine is 
traditionally a difficult place for opposition sides to visit and Dynamo will 
need to make the NSC Olympiyskyi a fortress if they want to qualify. Dynamo 
earned five of their 11 points at home in the previous campaign and will need 
to improve on this to qualify this time around. The form of Andriy Yarmolenko 
will also be crucial. Dynamo have held on to their key man despite him 
signalling his desire to leave.Peter Chymera

Juventus


How far will you go? Semi-finals

What are your hopes? Winning the competition would be perfect but I’d settle 
for a semi-final spot. With the shrewd acquisitions the club have made this 
summer, we’re in prime position to launch a decent Champions League campaign. 
Over the years we’ve lost key players in Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Paul 
Pogba, but replacements such as Miralem Pjanic, Gonzalo Higuaín, Dani Alves and 
Juan Cuadrado have settled in nicely. The return of Kwadwo Asamoah could 
essentially be looked upon as a new signing.

What do you need to succeed? The consistency of Higuaín up front will be 
vital. He didn’t impress in his previous European spells at Real Madrid and 
Napoli. He needs to establish a goalscoring partnership with Paulo Dybala. I’m 
not convinced this is the man to lead the club to Champions League glory. The 
midfield of Pjanic, Sami Khedira and Claudio Marchisio looks excellent though, 
and has softened the loss of Pogba considerably. Dani Alves has bags of 
experience and Mario Manduzkic, Mario Lemina and Stefano Sturaro give the squad 
sufficient depth for a long campaign. We’ll do well in the competition this 
year.Hamza

Legia Warsaw


How far will you go? Group stage

What are your hopes? Legia have qualified for the Champions League group stage 
for the first time since the club’s tournament debut back in 1995. They are the 
first Polish club to do so since 1996, so it’s a great success for Legia and 
for Polish football. We’re in a very demanding group – Real Madrid,Borussia 
Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> and Sporting 
will all fancy maximum points against us – so it’s going to be extremely hard.

It won’t come as a shock if Legia lose most of their matches, but I hope we’ll 
see some good competitive games. It’s also hard to be optimistic considering 
Legia’s domestic results this season so far. After eight games in the league, 
we’re closer to the bottom of the table than the top. We had a lot of luck in 
the Champions League qualifying rounds too.

What do you need to succeed? We do have some great players. Our Hungarian 
centre forward Nemanja Nikolics scored 28 goals in the league last season, 
Michal Pazdan was one of Poland’s best defenders at Euro 2016 and our veteran 
goalkeeper Arkadiusz Malarz is the heart of the team. Even if the club finishes 
bottom of the group, the six group matches will be a great opportunity for our 
devoted (and loud!) fans to show off their amazing choreographies, flags and 
other elements that earned them notoriety in their national league. We are in 
for some epic spectacles that will be remembered for years to come.Lukasz

How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? Some journalists and pundits have pitying our draw for 
the lack of a “big team” but I’m with the majority of fans, who couldn’t be 
happier. Three fun cities that are relatively close and, more importantly, 
Leicester have a real chance of progressing. My hopes are to have the same 
level of excitement as last season, even if it all ends in Group G.


What do you need to succeed? The key to us performing well will be other teams 
underestimating us and allowing us to play on the break. We have ridiculous 
pace and have added depth to the squad, which will allow us to do well in 
Europe as well as in the league. I’ve just had a my first child so I’m waiting 
for a good moment to tell my girlfriend that I’m going to all six group games.

How far will you go? Group stage

What are your hopes? It’s been three years since our memorable run into the 
last 16 of the Champions League, when the team produced memorable wins over PSV 
andDinamo Zagreb <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dinamozagreb> in the 
group stages, and eliminated Lazio in the first knock-out round. Valencia 
consequently proved too strong over two legs.

Since then we have been very disappointing in the Champions League, finishing 
bottom of our group two seasons ago while not even making it past the second 
qualifying round last year. So it’s good to be back in the Champions League, 
although hopes and expectations are paper thin.

Our only realistic hope is finishing third and qualifying for the Europa 
League. That might sound a bit defeatist but realistically Arsenal and PSG are 
much too strong for us. We’ll need to have a “cup final mentality” every other 
week and it just isn’t possible. We’ll aim to draw our home games against PSG 
and Arsenal, while beatingBasel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> at 
least once. Whatever happens I’ll be at all three homes games in Sofia cheering 
the team on.Teodor Stoynov

Lyon


How far will you go? Round of 16


What are your hopes? Group H looks highly competitive. Juventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> and Sevilla will surely be 
favourites to progress as they both have a good recent history in European 
tournaments. We’ll be looking to upset the odds a little bit though, but my 
expectations before the tournament are low. We should focus on winning our 
three homes games and try to put on three good away performances in the hope 
that will get us a few bonus points. Then we’ll see where we can go from there.

What do you need to succeed? We may have kept hold of Alexandre Lacazette, but 
he has rejected a contract extension at Lyon so will be on the move sooner 
rather than later. It’s important this doesn’t overshadow any performances on 
the pitch and that Nabil Fekir and Lacazette can find the required rhythm. 
Defensively we need to stay solid and alert if we are to have any chance. It’s 
a tall order butLyon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> will do their 
best to progress from the group stages.Aditya

How far will you go? Winners

What are your hopes? Anything but semi-finals will be a failure. My hopes this 
season are to win the thing. We have the squad and now, after years of 
searching, we have the manager. I could take a semi-final exit if we have 
played well and battled hard, a massive improvement on our damp-squib exit last 
year. Winning Group C is our first priority. It all depends on our 
head-to-heads with Barcelona.

What do you need to succeed? Keeping Sergio Agüero fit is essential. Every 
year he has his injury-laden few months. This normally coincides with the heavy 
fixture list around early Christmas and it takes time for him to find form 
again. Hopefully now with Leroy Sané in the team, the burden can be passed 
occasionally to keep Sergio fresh for those important away days in Europe. Just 
as important is making sure we find a solid defensive partnership. Whether that 
be John Stones and Vincent Kompany or Stones and Nicolás Otamendi, they need 
have a good understanding by the business end of the season.Ben Anthony

How far will you go? Winners

What are your hopes? Ideally I’d like us to win the competition. Our squad 
isn’t as talented as the “golden generation” of 1986-87, but it’s decent enough 
to progress deep into the tournament.

What do you need to succeed? I have faith in head coach Leonardo Jardim and 
players like goalkeeper Danijel Subašić will be key to our success. The good 
times in European football might well be coming back to Stade Loius II this 
season.Ahmed al-Mansour

Napoli 


How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? This will be Napoli’s third time in the Champions League 
in the last five seasons. The last time, under Rafa Benítez, Napoli went out 
despite picking 12 points from their group stage matches – the only time that 
ever happened in the tournament’s history. This season expectations are 
slightly higher, and we expect to progress through Group B relatively easily. 
But the team is very young so anything can happen.


What do you need to succeed? Our ability to defend when under pressure will be 
the major factor in deciding how far Napoli will go.Giannivo

How far will you go? Semi-finals
What are your hopes? Many supporters suggest we are weaker than last season 
after the loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a stuttering start to the season. We 
scraped unconvincing wins against Bastia and Metz before deservedly losing to
Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> before the international 
break. The latest league game, a 1-1 draw against Saint-Etienne, was hardly 
convincing either. But with Edinson Cavani and Ángel Di María returning for the 
Arsenal game, we should be stronger than our recent league form suggests. Hatem 
Ben Arfa is frustratingly inconsistent, but this is nothing new.

What do you need to succeed? If we can get off to a good start against 
Arsenal, I think we’ll top Group A easily. Particularly as I fancy Arsenal to 
do one of their specials and drop points away to either Basel orLudogorets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ludogorets> – or both! In the knockout 
stages I’d like to see some real progress and only a run into the last four of 
the competition would leave me completely satisfied.Robert

How far will you go? Round of 16


What are your hopes? Realistically I hope we get out of the group and do not 
meet a European giant until the quarters. The team has improved from last 
season but it lacks the aggression and discipline required to grind out 
results. Our defence is slightly improved compared to last year. Brazilian 
attacking midfielder Otávio and striker Andre Silva can link well, and Yacine 
Brahimi deciding to stay was positive one. Loan signing Óliver Torres looks 
exciting and we have enough quality to get out of Group G. We’re still unlikely 
to trouble any of the big teams though.Daniu

Real Madrid 


How far will you go? Semi-finals

What are your hopes? Real Madrid are going to perform well in this 
competition, but might struggle to hold on to the trophy next May. Zidane knows 
how to cope with a squad that is very similar to that of the previous season 
and his early days as first-team coach have been excellent. There’s no reason 
he can’t inspire the side to at least have an honest attempt at retaining the 
trophy.

What do you need to succeed? The key will be in the progress of Marco Asensio 
and Mariano Diaz, who have stepped up from the youth team in a year in which 
Real Madrid haven’t been allowed to sign anybody. It doesn’t bother me that we 
have hungry young players challenging the more experienced players though. Both 
those young players can become extremely useful.Alberto

FC Rostov


How far will you go? Group stage 

What are your hopes? I was lucky enough to witness FC Rostov’s incredible run 
in the Russian Premier League last season. It was nothing short of sensational 
considering their resources. I hope we can make a good showing of ourselves, 
but both Bayern and Atlético Madrid will be of a different calibre to any team 
Rostov have ever faced before. Qualifying for the knockout round is out of the 
question. But I don’t think it’s impossible to think we can get the edge over 
PSV and take third spot and a Europa League place.

What do you need to succeed? The key to everything at Rostov is team spirit. 
There’s a great camaraderie among the players and staff; they all seem so happy 
just to be there. We’re a disciplined unit and strong on the counter-attack. 
Good performances will be needed, not just from star players Ecuadorian 
midfielder Christian Noboa, Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun and Dmitry Poloz, but 
from absolutely everyone.

My worry is that, while Rostov have kept many players over the summer, they’ve 
lost three of their defenders. Bastos went to Serie A side Lazio, Ivan 
Novoseltsev left for Zenit Saint Petersburg and Boris Rotenberg departed for 
Lokomotiv Moscow. How a team which relied so much on their defence will cope

How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> 
will find it tough to go through from Group H. Tough, but not impossible. 
Despite a good start in La Liga this season and some promising signings in the 
summer, the club is not used to playing against first-class European teams 
every week. I hope they can face whoever they have to with dignity and 
professionalism.

What do you need to succeed? The key point will be to stick with a 
self-confident starting XI. Experienced footballers such as Samir Nasri and 
Vitolo can have a huge influence on the rest of the team if they feel inspired 
on the night. In our home games we need to control the game from start to 
finish because it will be tough to pick up the required points in Turin and 
Zagreb on our travels.Rober

How far will you go? Round of 16

What are your hopes? If Sporting can win the third match against Dortmund at 
home, we have a good chance of getting to the last 16. The worst case scenario 
should be third place and a spot in the Europa League.

What do you need to succeed? The club was able to do some good business in the 
last few days of the summer transfer window, bringing in Joel Campbell from 
Arsenal, Dutch forward Bas Dost from Wolfsburg, Elias from Corinthians and 
Lazar Markovic on loan from Liverpool. If these players settle well, together 
with the three Portuguese European Champions, Rui Patricio, Adrien Silva and 
William Carvalho, Sporting have a good chance of causing a slight upset and 
qualifying for the last 16. The first two games at home againstLegia Warsaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/legiawarsaw> and Dortmund will be key.

How far will you go? Quarter-finals

What are your hopes? I’m very positive for once. In the group draw I either 
wanted some European heavyweights to test ourselves properly or what we’ve got 
– a couple of the weakest opponents from pots one and two. The away games will 
be testing. Moscow is never an easy place to visit but CSKA aren’t such a 
European force these days. Let’s just hope the recent Euros fan fighting is not 
repeated. We’ve a good recent record against Monaco, drawing away and hammering 
them at home in last season’s Europa League, while Bayer Leverkusen gave us 
Dimitar Berbatov 10 years ago. Let’s hope they remain as generous.

I’ll be very disappointed not to qualify from the group. I have no delusions 
of actually winning the thing but think we should be aiming for a quarter-final 
spot and ideally a big scalp along the way. If you’re going to be in it, then 
it’s only really interesting if you can test yourself against the best.

What do you need to succeed? Organisation and workrate are key and these are 
Potch’s magic ingredients that has allowed the undoubted talent to bloom so 
far. Having in-form key players will also help enormously. Oh, and the small 
matter of whether we can adapt to the Wembley pitch.Frazek
