 by moving to Real Madrid. The Spain Under-21 playmaker has joined from Málaga 
on a five-year deal.

Isco, 21, has long been linked with Madrid and the arrival of new coach Carlo 
Ancelotti,who was unveiled as the successor to José Mourinho on Wednesday, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/26/carlo-ancelotti-unveiled-real-madrid-pressure>
 has accelerated the transfer.

"Real Madrid incorporates a new project with one of the best Spanish football 
players," the club said in a statement.

"Francisco Román Alarcón – Isco – plays at the Bernabéu for the next five 
seasons."

Reports in Spain suggest the fee will be in the region of €27m (£23m).

The Spanish club's president Florentino Pérez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/florentino-perez> had earlier said: "He 
will be presented next week after the medical."

Isco recently starred as Spain's Under-21 team retained the European 
Championship, scoring three times in their successful campaign in Israel. 
Ancelotti was asked about the former Valencia man on Wednesday at his press 
conference.

The Italian said: "From what I have seen of him, it's clear he has a lot of 
quality. Spain's Under-21 side has a lot of great players and he is one of the 
best. He could get into any team in the world, so he could also play for 
Madrid."

Isco would be Madrid's second summer sigining after they re-signed the 
full-back Dani Carvajal on a buy-back deal from Bayer Leverkusen.
