Porto <https://www.theguardian.com/football/porto>, who completed a league 
double over their arch-rivals, are now within three points of Sporting and 
Benfica who are level at the top of the table.

Midfielder Renato Sanches, 18, the revelation of the season, set up the 
opening goal for the hosts with a delightful dinked pass to Mitroglou who beat 
Casillas with a scuffed shot.

Herrera replied 10 minutes later when he was given too much space on the edge 
of the area and the Mexican midfielder drilled a low diagonal shot wide of 
Júlio César.

Casillas then sprang into action as he prevented Benfica taking a half-time 
lead by tipping a powerful Jonas drive over the bar.

The former Real Madrid goalkeeper again came to the rescue early in the second 
period when he brilliantly stopped Nicolas Gaitan who had a clear run on goal.

Aboubakar then burst past a defender and buried an angled shot past Júlio 
César in the 65th minute.

Casillas twice denied Benfica an equaliser, saving from Bruno Martins Indi 
after the Porto defender deflected a cross towards his own goal and making a 
point-blank stop with his feet from Mitroglou.
