Thanks for all the questions, sorry if I didn't get to you. But imagine the 
answer was just what you wanted - that is what I would have said.

As a kid, what scared you more: Dracula, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, 
or Davros from Doctor Who?

I think of those three, I would say the Creature from the Black Lagoon. 
Dracula only frightened me afterwards, having watched one of the Hammers, it 
was in the night in the dark that I would then consider him trying to get in at 
the window. The Creature was a proper monster - those dead eyes swimming 
through the weeds were a horrible sight.

There was a character that Mark and Jeremy wrote that was a horror author, and 
we tried to get him in the third series, but it never quite worked out. He was 
a very particular vein of comedy that they were pursuing, the bad horror 
author. One of his books was called Snails, and it was about snails taking over 
the world. It was actually very funny, but we could never make him fit in the 
world of Royston Vasey.

"It should be difficult to get a television programme made. It certainly makes

I've always been of the mind that it should be difficult to get a television 
programme made. It certainly makes you more rigorous and stops you being lazy, 
but I hope it's always recognised that there's always room for all types of 
comedy, with it being such a subjective medium, and so much of it down to taste.

It was great fun to be asked by Vic and Bob to join them in their insanity. I 
was a huge fan of their work, and it felt a real honour to be working with 
them. I love the comedy of the mundane that they present so brilliantly, its 
sloppiness and its seeming artlessness is actually very carefully considered 
and precise. I think that's what makes them true geniuses.

I haven't played a woman for a long time, but from what I remember of doing

I was in a sofa.

Inside Number 9 series 2 podcast/commentary was a wonderful thing. Glad to see

did you come about the idea of doing it?

It was planned from the start - we wanted to do the commentaries because we've 
always done them for our shows. But with DVD apparently dying out, as far as 
sales of our things went, we were told we couldn't afford to do them 
officially. So the podcast seemed a nice way of giving fans of the show some 
extra content.

It became its own little story, if you followed our characters - our 
characters had an argument that spilled over into Steve killing me, it was very 
metatextual. So we used it as another way of entertaining people, hopefully.

Steve and I write together in a room, line by line, one taking turns in typing 
while the other one sits and looks at their iPhone in secret. We talk a lot 
before we begin writing so we're sure of where we want to go. Some days are 
hard, other days it flows onto the page.

We never really have arguments, it's more long silences when the other person 
won't back down. And then we'll leave it, and return to it with fresh eyes.

I have worked with most of the people I admire. I had great fun working with 
Steve Coogan on his latest Alan Partridge Mid Morning Matters - it felt a real 
honour to be on the receiving end of Alan.

I don't think that we're ever thinking of children watching our programmes - 
they're all too nasty and peppered with adult themes for me to be comfortable 
with showing even my own children. My own children don't know what I do - 
they've never seen any of it. But I am quite a puritanical father. I've only 
just let then watch In The Night Garden. Which I still think of as 
inappropriate and nightmare-inducing.

All I can think it there's something inherently cartoonish about the level of 
grotesquery that our characters are sometimes played at, that transcends them 
being sinister and makes them funny. Like a man in a suit playing a clown. I've 
played a lot of clowns, and children don't find them as terrifying as adults.

Our influences were more drama and documentary that comedy. We were always big 
fans of actors who could do comedy like Leonard Rossiter, Peter Sellers, Ronnie 
Barker, but equally very fond of Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood.

In the 90s there were very few documentaries about extraordinary things - 
nowadays, every two minutes there's My Face Has Got A Foot On It, or something. 
It was slim pickings back then, but we would mine what there was for 
extraordinary detail. A lot of the Barbara character came from the documentary 
- it's all very un PC now because it's transgender-phobic - but the 
George/Julia documentaries about sex changes. We would watch a lot of First 
Tuesdays and Dispatches, these old TV shows that would have a subject or 
character that might have legs.

We're big fans of anthology shows like Tales of the Unexpected, Hammer House 
of Horror, and Play for Todays. Where you tell a story and have characters that 
you care about, and I think that informed our writing style, because we would 
try to give our sketch show characters a third dimension you might not normally 
expect in a comedy show.

As a kid, what scared you more: Dracula, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, 
or Davros from Doctor Who?

I think of those three, I would say the Creature from the Black Lagoon. 
Dracula only frightened me afterwards, having watched one of the Hammers, it 
was in the night in the dark that I would then consider him trying to get in at 
the window. The Creature was a proper monster - those dead eyes swimming 
through the weeds were a horrible sight.

There was a character that Mark and Jeremy wrote that was a horror author, and 
we tried to get him in the third series, but it never quite worked out. He was 
a very particular vein of comedy that they were pursuing, the bad horror 
author. One of his books was called Snails, and it was about snails taking over 
the world. It was actually very funny, but we could never make him fit in the 
world of Royston Vasey.

I've always been of the mind that it should be difficult to get a television 
programme made. It certainly makes you more rigorous and stops you being lazy, 
but I hope it's always recognised that there's always room for all types of 
comedy, with it being such a subjective medium, and so much of it down to taste.

It was great fun to be asked by Vic and Bob to join them in their insanity. I 
was a huge fan of their work, and it felt a real honour to be working with 
them. I love the comedy of the mundane that they present so brilliantly, its 
sloppiness and its seeming artlessness is actually very carefully considered 
and precise. I think that's what makes them true geniuses.

I haven't played a woman for a long time, but from what I remember of doing 
it, I was very comfortable. Some of them were completely padded - it felt like 
I was in a sofa.

It was planned from the start - we wanted to do the commentaries because we've 
always done them for our shows. But with DVD apparently dying out, as far as 
sales of our things went, we were told we couldn't afford to do them 
officially. So the podcast seemed a nice way of giving fans of the show some 
extra content.

It became its own little story, if you followed our characters - our 
characters had an argument that spilled over into Steve killing me, it was very 
metatextual. So we used it as another way of entertaining people, hopefully.

Steve and I write together in a room, line by line, one taking turns in typing 
while the other one sits and looks at their iPhone in secret. We talk a lot 
before we begin writing so we're sure of where we want to go. Some days are 
hard, other days it flows onto the page.

We never really have arguments, it's more long silences when the other person 
won't back down. And then we'll leave it, and return to it with fresh eyes.

I don't think that we're ever thinking of children watching our programmes - 
they're all too nasty and peppered with adult themes for me to be comfortable 
with showing even my own children. My own children don't know what I do - 
they've never seen any of it. But I am quite a puritanical father. I've only 
just let then watch In The Night Garden. Which I still think of as 
inappropriate and nightmare-inducing.

All I can think it there's something inherently cartoonish about the level of 
grotesquery that our characters are sometimes played at, that transcends them 
being sinister and makes them funny. Like a man in a suit playing a clown. I've 
played a lot of clowns, and children don't find them as terrifying as adults.

What were the main comedic influences that led to the League of Gentlemen?

Our influences were more drama and documentary that comedy. We were always big 
fans of actors who could do comedy like Leonard Rossiter, Peter Sellers, Ronnie 
Barker, but equally very fond of Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood.

In the 90s there were very few documentaries about extraordinary things - 
nowadays, every two minutes there's My Face Has Got A Foot On It, or something. 
It was slim pickings back then, but we would mine what there was for 
extraordinary detail. A lot of the Barbara character came from the documentary 
- it's all very un PC now because it's transgender-phobic - but the 
George/Julia documentaries about sex changes. We would watch a lot of First 
Tuesdays and Dispatches, these old TV shows that would have a subject or 
character that might have legs.

We're big fans of anthology shows like Tales of the Unexpected, Hammer House 
of Horror, and Play for Todays. Where you tell a story and have characters that 
you care about, and I think that informed our writing style, because we would 
try to give our sketch show characters a third dimension you might not normally 
expect in a comedy show.
