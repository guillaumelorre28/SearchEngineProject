Danny Huston is to make his UK theatre debut in The Kid Stays in the Picture 
<https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/kid-stays-picture/> at the Royal Court 
in London. The show, directed by Simon McBurney, is an adaptation of the
bracingly candid memoir <http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7868-6059-3> by 
actor turned movie mogul Robert Evans.

Huston comes from Hollywood royalty: his half-sister is the actor Anjelica and 
his father, John, directedThe Treasure of the Sierre Madre  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGpvO8JabEc>which starred Danny’s grandfather, 
Walter. Huston hailed Evans as a maverick who “produced some of the most iconic 
American films including The Godfather andChinatown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/best-film-ever-chinatown-season>, 
in which my father played one of the greatest movie villains of all time”.


In the 1960s and 70s, Evans turned around the fortunes of the ailing Paramount 
Pictures with other hits such as Rosemary’s Baby and Love Story but his career 
declined and he had personal problems including cocaine addiction. His 1994 
memoir, which also details his multiple marriages, was turned into an acclaimed 
2002documentary film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/07/artsfeatures5>. 

Huston met with Evans in Los Angeles to discuss the project before arriving in 
London this week for rehearsals. Huston is chiefly known as a film and 
television actor and is no stranger to projects about Hollywood, having played 
Orson Welles in Fade to Black (2006) and appeared in the biopic Hitchcock 
(2012). The Kid Stays in the Picture reunites him with McBurney, his co-star in 
the 2009 film Boogie-Woogie, a satire about the London art world.

The predominantly American cast for The Kid Stays in the Picture includes 
Heather Burns, Max Casella, Ajay Naidu and Madeleine Potter. British actors 
Clint Dyer and Thomas Arnold also star. The show is a co-production by the 
Royal Court, McBurney’sComplicite <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/complicite>
 company and Bond producer Barbara Broccoli. It runs at the Royal Court from 7 
March to 8 April.
