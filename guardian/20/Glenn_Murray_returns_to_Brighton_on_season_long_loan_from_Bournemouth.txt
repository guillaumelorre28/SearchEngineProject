He made 10 Premier League appearances, scoring three goals as Bournemouth

status but has now opted to join Chris Hughton at the Amex Stadium.

Hughton said: “Everyone at the club, and the supporters, know what Glenn will 
offer us. He is a real attacking presence who can lead the line, he’s powerful 
in the air, and his goalscoring record speaks for itself.

“He is a different type of striker to those we have got at the club already 
and will give us an extra option going forward. Most importantly he knows the
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> well, he knows 
how to score goals at this level and what it takes to get out of this division.

“The move has been a long time in the making and the recruitment department 
has done an excellent job to finally get the deal over the line. He is a proven 
goalscorer and an excellent addition to the squad.”

Brighton avoided defeat in their opening 21 league games last season but by 
May they had failed to beat Middlesbrough or Burnley to a top-two spot in the 
Championship. They werebeaten by Sheffield Wednesday in the play-offs
