FULL TIME: England 1-2 Holland

Alli tries to magic something up with a burst into the Dutch box down the 
right, but runs the ball out of play. And that’s that. Or is it? A farcical end 
as Hodgson and Danny Blind shake hands on the touchline, only to realise the 
referee has added on another minute! But England can’t do anything with it. 
Holland have earned themselves the win with a fine comeback performance. A 
slight whiff of controversy about both of their goals, perhaps, but it’s only a 
friendly, and England can take comfort in their attacking play at least. Having 
said that, the high of Berlin only lasted approximately 70 hours. Ah well. Euro 
2016, here they come! Something poor oldHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> can’t say.

84 min: Kane bustles down the right channel, turns the occasionally hapless 
Blind, and lashes a fierce shot inches wide of the right-hand post. Zoet might 
have had that covered, but you wouldn’t put large amounts of cash on it. Kane 
really is a force of nature. A superstar in the making. One already, perhaps?

81 min: Wembley is in a hot funk. A quiet seethe, rather than a rolling boil. 
It is only a friendly, after all.

79 min: That was Bazoer’s last act of the evening. He’s replaced by Van Ginkel.
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> are livid about that 
second Dutch goal, suggesting Jagielka was unfairly sent crashing to the 
ground. It was a fierce shoulder charge all right, and you’ve seen fouls given 
for that. But the bottom line was, Jagielka was passive, while Janssenreally 
wanted it. You can see why fortune favoured the brave.

GOAL! England 1-2 Holland (Narsingh 77)

Bazoer slides a ball down the inside-left channel for Janssen, who strongly 
shoulder-charges Jagielka off the ball and reaches the byline. He’s got time to 
look up and think. He pulls the ball back to Narsingh, coming in from the 
right. Narsingh batters the ball into the net, no fuss.

74 min: This Zoet doesn’t mind coming off his line. He’s fond of making brave 
decisions. Walker makes good down the right and looks to be dropping a cross on 
Vardy’s head, 12 yards out. But the keeper races out to fingertip clear. A 
great last-ditch save. Vardy would have been powering that goalwards had the

73 min: It nearly gets it, thanks to that man Kane, who is released down the 
right by a clever slipped pass from Milner, and earns a corner. The set piece 
drops to his feet, ten yards out, just to the left of goal, but he can’t sort 
himself out quickly enough to get a shot off.

72 min: Afellay is penalised for contesting a 50-50 with Barkley in the 
high-kickin’ style. A chance to load the box, but Milner’s free kick isn’t all 
that. This game needs a boost.

69 min: Walcott chases after a long hoof down the middle. He enters the area, 
and falls to ground, having been gently clipped by Willems. He wants a penalty 
for that, but he’s not getting one. It would have been a generous decision.

67 min: A brilliant solo effort by Walcott who, tight on the right, spins 
suddenly and turns Willems with ease. He scampers off towards the box, then 
sends a rising effort inches over the bar. Zoet probably had that covered, and 
Lallana was offering himself in the middle, but Walcott was entitled to take 
that on himself, having carved the chance out of nothing. It wasn’t a bad 
effort at all.

63 min: Stones has been fairly hapless in defence tonight, but he certainly 
looks the business coming forward. He Beckenbauers his way upfield and slips a 
pass down the inside-right channel to release Walcott into the area. Walcott 
gets a shot away, though it’s blocked out for a corner by a last-ditch Blind 
challenge. Once again. Zoet plucks that from the sky.England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> look exciting going forward, not 
so clever at the back. Are we sure this is a Roy Hodgson side?

61 min: Vardy has the ball, the best part of 30 yards from goal. He’s got 
nothing on, so decides to send a rising heatseeker towards the top right. It’s 
flying in, but fingertipped over the bar by Zoet, who then claims the resulting 
corner with ease. What a shot by Vardy, though, and a marvellous save to boot.

59 min: England load the box. Milner floats the free kick in from the right, 
looking for Smalling just to the left of goal. But the delivery is a nonsense.
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> come again, though, with 
Lallana and Walcott causing bother down the left. The ball breaks inside for 
Clyne, who crashes a woeful volley several miles over the bar. That’ll have the 
roundel outside Wembley Park spinning on its pole.

58 min: Bruma is rightly booked for bringing down Vardy as the striker looks 
to break down the right. Before the free kick can be taken, Sturridge and Rose 
are substituted in favour of Walcott and Clyne.

56 min: England’s best form of defence is attack. They instigate a bit of head 
tennis in the Dutch area. Bruma eventually clears. Then Barkley glides down the 
left before whipping a deep cross in for Sturridge. Zoet is well off his line 
to claim.

54 min: England are beginning to look ropey at the back again. Forster is 
hounded by Memphis as he tries to kick clear. He only just about manages it. 
Soon after, Memphis is coming down the left wing and nearly finds Janssen ten 
yards out with a fine cross, but Drinkwater heads clear. Only to Bazoer, 
though, who shoots hard through a thicket of players from the edge of the box. 
Forster struggles to claim, the ball having taken a deflection off Drinkwater’s 
arm - no penalty for that one - but he smothers it eventually.

Penalty for Holland!

50 min: Stones faffs around once too often, slips, and he’s robbed by Janssen, 
who is one on one. He shoots towards the bottom right. Forster parries 
brilliantly. But much good the keeper’s heroics do forEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>. Narsingh picks up possession on 
the right, and crosses. Rose’s hand is dangling, and the ball strikes it. 
Penalty. Not all refs would give it, but you can see why this one has.

49 min: A Gazza-esque power dribble from the centre circle to the edge of the 
Dutch D by Barkley. He lays off to Lallana to his left. Lallana tries to curl 
one into the top right, but it’s high and wide.

47 min: Holland have come out on the front foot. Wijnaldum and Narsingh 
combine crisply down the right, but Rose and Stone combine to snuff them out. 
And thenEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> respond through 
Sturridge, who takes possession of a throw from the right, spins Blind in the 
box, and fires towards the bottom-right corner. There’s no heat on the shot, 
which suits Zoet.

for the second half. No changes. Yet. “If we win tonight I’ll be Breaking into 
Heaven, tomorrow Driving South to work it’ll be a Ten Storey Love Song before 
Daybreak and England, your Star Will Shine. But Vardy, please don’t shoot 
Straight To The Man, I’m Begging You to hit the net, we’re walking a Tightrope

HALF TIME: England 1-0 Holland

The free kick comes to nothing, headed clear with ease by Walker, and that’s 
that for the opening 45. Jamie Vardy’s second international goal is the 
difference. Make sure you stay for the second half. No flipping, asanother 
recently departed legend <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc6jqO_o7Yk> once 
said.

bother in the one minute that’ll be added onto the end of this half.

England frustrated as Luciano Narsingh goal seals Holland’s comeback

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/29/england-holland-international-friendly-match-report> 
Alli tries to magic something up with a burst into the Dutch box down the 
right, but runs the ball out of play. And that’s that. Or is it? A farcical end 
as Hodgson and Danny Blind shake hands on the touchline, only to realise the 
referee has added on another minute! But England can’t do anything with it. 
Holland have earned themselves the win with a fine comeback performance. A 
slight whiff of controversy about both of their goals, perhaps, but it’s only a 
friendly, and England can take comfort in their attacking play at least. Having 
said that, the high of Berlin only lasted approximately 70 hours. Ah well. Euro 
2016, here they come! Something poor oldHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> can’t say.

90 min +2: Barkley dribbles down the right, but his cross into the England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> box is too long. A final 
substitution by Holland: the excellent Janssen is replaced by Clasie.
 
90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Jagielka hoofs long for Vardy, 
but there’s no accuracy on the ball.
 
90 min: Van Aanholt robs a dithering Alli in the midfield. He makes it all the 
way to the England area, thinks about shooting, then turns back.Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> happy to keep the ball 
themselves for a bit. The clock is their friend.
 
88 min: England are seeing a lot of the ball, but in their own half. Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are happy to let them have it, 
sitting deep and keeping their shape.
 
86 min: The attack-minded Van Aanholt’s cross from the left is deflected out 
by Jagielka for a Dutch corner. Memphis sends it straight down Forster’s throat.
 
85 min: Drinkwater’s debut is over. He’s replaced by Dier.
 
84 min: Kane bustles down the right channel, turns the occasionally hapless 
Blind, and lashes a fierce shot inches wide of the right-hand post. Zoet might 
have had that covered, but you wouldn’t put large amounts of cash on it. Kane 
really is a force of nature. A superstar in the making. One already, perhaps?

82 min: To great cheers, the new golden boy Alli is sent on. The captain 
Milner departs, giving his armband to Jagielka. Perhaps it’ll help him with 
issues of balance.Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> make a 
change too, switching Willems for Van Aanholt.
 
81 min: Wembley is in a hot funk. A quiet seethe, rather than a rolling boil. 
It is only a friendly, after all.
 
79 min: That was Bazoer’s last act of the evening. He’s replaced by Van Ginkel.
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> are livid about that 
second Dutch goal, suggesting Jagielka was unfairly sent crashing to the 
ground. It was a fierce shoulder charge all right, and you’ve seen fouls given 
for that. But the bottom line was, Jagielka was passive, while Janssenreally 
wanted it. You can see why fortune favoured the brave.
 
Bazoer slides a ball down the inside-left channel for Janssen, who strongly 
shoulder-charges Jagielka off the ball and reaches the byline. He’s got time to 
look up and think. He pulls the ball back to Narsingh, coming in from the 
right. Narsingh batters the ball into the net, no fuss.

76 min: Walker pulls Memphis back by the shoulder as the Manchester United 
winger threatens to break into a lot of space down the left. A free kick, which 
is looped into theEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> box to 
no effect.
 
74 min: This Zoet doesn’t mind coming off his line. He’s fond of making brave 
decisions. Walker makes good down the right and looks to be dropping a cross on 
Vardy’s head, 12 yards out. But the keeper races out to fingertip clear. A 
great last-ditch save. Vardy would have been powering that goalwards had the 
keeper not intervened.
 
73 min: It nearly gets it, thanks to that man Kane, who is released down the 
right by a clever slipped pass from Milner, and earns a corner. The set piece 
drops to his feet, ten yards out, just to the left of goal, but he can’t sort 
himself out quickly enough to get a shot off.

72 min: Afellay is penalised for contesting a 50-50 with Barkley in the 
high-kickin’ style. A chance to load the box, but Milner’s free kick isn’t all 
that. This game needs a boost.
 
70 min: Another couple of changes by England: Kane and Jagielka come on for 
Lallana and Smalling.
 
69 min: Walcott chases after a long hoof down the middle. He enters the area, 
and falls to ground, having been gently clipped by Willems. He wants a penalty 
for that, but he’s not getting one. It would have been a generous decision.
 
67 min: A brilliant solo effort by Walcott who, tight on the right, spins 
suddenly and turns Willems with ease. He scampers off towards the box, then 
sends a rising effort inches over the bar. Zoet probably had that covered, and 
Lallana was offering himself in the middle, but Walcott was entitled to take 
that on himself, having carved the chance out of nothing. It wasn’t a bad 
effort at all.

65 min: Holland calm it down a bit, passing it around the back for a while. 
That’s understandable enough, asEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> had worked up a small head of 
steam there.
 
63 min: Stones has been fairly hapless in defence tonight, but he certainly 
looks the business coming forward. He Beckenbauers his way upfield and slips a 
pass down the inside-right channel to release Walcott into the area. Walcott 
gets a shot away, though it’s blocked out for a corner by a last-ditch Blind 
challenge. Once again. Zoet plucks that from the sky.England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> look exciting going forward, not 
so clever at the back. Are we sure this is a Roy Hodgson side?
 Walcott has a go. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters  
61 min: Vardy has the ball, the best part of 30 yards from goal. He’s got 
nothing on, so decides to send a rising heatseeker towards the top right. It’s 
flying in, but fingertipped over the bar by Zoet, who then claims the resulting 
corner with ease. What a shot by Vardy, though, and a marvellous save to boot.

59 min: England load the box. Milner floats the free kick in from the right, 
looking for Smalling just to the left of goal. But the delivery is a nonsense.
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> come again, though, with 
Lallana and Walcott causing bother down the left. The ball breaks inside for 
Clyne, who crashes a woeful volley several miles over the bar. That’ll have the 
roundel outside Wembley Park spinning on its pole.
 
58 min: Bruma is rightly booked for bringing down Vardy as the striker looks 
to break down the right. Before the free kick can be taken, Sturridge and Rose 
are substituted in favour of Walcott and Clyne.
 
56 min: England’s best form of defence is attack. They instigate a bit of head 
tennis in the Dutch area. Bruma eventually clears. Then Barkley glides down the 
left before whipping a deep cross in for Sturridge. Zoet is well off his line 
to claim.
 
54 min: England are beginning to look ropey at the back again. Forster is 
hounded by Memphis as he tries to kick clear. He only just about manages it. 
Soon after, Memphis is coming down the left wing and nearly finds Janssen ten 
yards out with a fine cross, but Drinkwater heads clear. Only to Bazoer, 
though, who shoots hard through a thicket of players from the edge of the box. 
Forster struggles to claim, the ball having taken a deflection off Drinkwater’s 
arm - no penalty for that one - but he smothers it eventually.

53 min: Sturridge again troubles Blind down the right. He feeds Milner, who 
reaches the byline and stands one up towards Vardy at the far post. Vardy is 
preparing to but home, but Veltman rises to eyebrow it away from danger.

Janssen clips it confidently into the top left, sending Forster the wrong way. 
A perfect penalty. On theEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> 
bench, Roy Hodgson is ranting like an alfresco beverage consumer. He is not 
happy.

50 min: Stones faffs around once too often, slips, and he’s robbed by Janssen, 
who is one on one. He shoots towards the bottom right. Forster parries 
brilliantly. But much good the keeper’s heroics do forEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>. Narsingh picks up possession on 
the right, and crosses. Rose’s hand is dangling, and the ball strikes it. 
Penalty. Not all refs would give it, but you can see why this one has.
 
49 min: A Gazza-esque power dribble from the centre circle to the edge of the 
Dutch D by Barkley. He lays off to Lallana to his left. Lallana tries to curl 
one into the top right, but it’s high and wide.
 
47 min: Holland have come out on the front foot. Wijnaldum and Narsingh 
combine crisply down the right, but Rose and Stone combine to snuff them out. 
And thenEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> respond through 
Sturridge, who takes possession of a throw from the right, spins Blind in the 
box, and fires towards the bottom-right corner. There’s no heat on the shot, 
which suits Zoet.
 
Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> get the ball rolling 
for the second half. No changes. Yet. “If we win tonight I’ll be Breaking into 
Heaven, tomorrow Driving South to work it’ll be a Ten Storey Love Song before 
Daybreak and England, your Star Will Shine. But Vardy, please don’t shoot 
Straight To The Man, I’m Begging You to hit the net, we’re walking a Tightrope 
here. Gimme some Good Times and fewer Tears. Oh How Do You Sleep knowing you 
could make so many people happy and watch how Love Spreads.” Howard Appleby 
there, track by track and in the right order. Led Zeppelin III has an awful lot 
to answer for.
 
Half-time entertainment of an international flavour: Just in case you missed 
it over Easter weekend, here’s the story of the great Bjarni Fel, the man who 
introduced top-quality football to generations of Icelandic fans. If Iceland do 
a Denmark or Greece this summer, you’ll know who to thank.

The free kick comes to nothing, headed clear with ease by Walker, and that’s 
that for the opening 45. Jamie Vardy’s second international goal is the 
difference. Make sure you stay for the second half. No flipping, asanother 
recently departed legend <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc6jqO_o7Yk> once 
said.
 
45 min: Milner needlessly controls the ball with his arm in the midfield. 
That’s a free kick, and a chance forHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> to pack the box and cause some 
bother in the one minute that’ll be added onto the end of this half.
