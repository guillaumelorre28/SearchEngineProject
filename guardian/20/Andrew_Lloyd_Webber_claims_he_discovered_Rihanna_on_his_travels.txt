King of musicals Andrew Lloyd Webber

has said that he discovered Rihanna while on holiday but chose not to “bring 
her back” to the UK.

In an interview on Good Morning Britain this week, Lloyd Webber explained how 
he had stumbled upon the global star while she was singing karaoke at the Sandy 
Lane resort in Barbados 12 years ago, but he and his creative partner, Nigel 
Wright, decided not to follow their impulses although she sounded “very, very 
good”.

“I said to Nigel, ‘If we bring her back, you know it’s like when you see a 
picture when you’re away and you take it home and you think, why did I buy 
that?’” said Webber. “I thought: we’ll get her back, it’ll be fine, but then 
what do we do with her?”

When asked if he had any regrets, he said his missed opportunity was “not 
something he was proud of”.

Instead, Rihanna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna> was discovered by 
American producer Evan Rogers in 2003, who saw the singer performing with a 
girl group while he was on holiday.

“The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls 
didn’t exist,” helater said

Rihanna’s first track,Pon de Replay 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEauWw9ZGrA>, was recorded and sent off to 
several record labels. When the demo reached Def Jam and Jay Z, she was flown 
to meet the team and famously signed that day.
