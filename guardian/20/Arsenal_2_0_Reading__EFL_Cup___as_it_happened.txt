A solid performance from Arsenal, and they overcame Reading with relatively 
little fuss. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a good first goal and a lucky 
second, but the hosts had too much quality, and could have won by more, but for 
a series of good stops from Ali al-Habsi.Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> did OK, but the gulf in class 
was marked.

Thanks for reading! Goodnight.

84 min Willock nearly gets on the end of a cross from the right, but 
Gravenberch does enough to cover the danger.

73 min That should have been two. Lovely flowing move from Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> down the right, and Elneny’s run 
allowed Oxlade-Chamberlain to receive it in space. Al-Habsi saved his first 
shot, but could only parry it to Iwobi, who completely fluffed the rebound.

Good fun, and Arsenal lead, deservedly, thanks to Oxlade-Chamberlain’s fine 
goal. Reading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> have had their 
moments, but the home side are well on top. See you in 15.

Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the double against Reading
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/arsenal-reading-efl-cup-match-report> 
A solid performance from Arsenal, and they overcame Reading with relatively 
little fuss. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a good first goal and a lucky 
second, but the hosts had too much quality, and could have won by more, but for 
a series of good stops from Ali al-Habsi.Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> did OK, but the gulf in class 
was marked.

Thanks for reading! Goodnight.
 
And that’s the whistle. Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
safely into the quarter-finals.
 
90 min +1 Elneny skies one miles too high from 25 yards.
 
90 min Three minutes of stoppage time.
 
88 min Kermorgant’s free kick … and Martinez saves really well! He got down 
very quickly to his left. Excellent stop.
 
87 min Samuel is tripped right on the edge of the box by Gabriel. A goal here 
could make for an interesting final three minutes.
 
84 min Willock nearly gets on the end of a cross from the right, but 
Gravenberch does enough to cover the danger.
 
82 min Not much happening in attack for Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading>.
 
79 min Liam Moore goes into the book for a crude lunge on Giroud.
 
Bad luck for Reading. Oxlade-Chamberlain hit one from the edge of the box, and 
it looped up off aReading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> foot 
with al-Habsi beaten. Regardless, that is probably that.

Martinez/Reuters  Which al-Habsi can’t stop and Arsenal are 2-0 up. Photograph: 
Dylan Martinez/Reuters  
77 min Another great save from al-Habsi. Iwobi thrashes one from the edge of 
the box and the keeper turns it over the bar.
 
76 min Instead, Elneny chips it in, and Giroud wins the first header, but the 
whistle goes for a foul.
  Arsenal’s Kieran Gibbs goes on the charge. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images  
75 min McCleary is booked for fouling Oxlade-Chamberlain 30 yards from goal. 
Chance for a shot.
 
73 min That should have been two. Lovely flowing move from Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> down the right, and Elneny’s run 
allowed Oxlade-Chamberlain to receive it in space. Al-Habsi saved his first 
shot, but could only parry it to Iwobi, who completely fluffed the rebound.
 
72 min Chris Willock replaces Lucas Perez. It’s not quite been Lucas’s night.
 
71 min What a save from al-Habsi. The ball was whipped in from the left, and 
Giroud flicked a header goalwards, but al-Habsi plunged to keep it out! Then 
from the follow-up, Moore headed it off the line!Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> stay alive.
 Reading’s Ali Al Habsi makes a save from Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud ... 
Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  Then Liam Moore heads the follow-up off the 
line. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images  
70 min Gravenberch is really late on Perez, but escapes a booking. That should 
have been yellow.
 
69 min Twenty minutes or so for Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> to find a goal. Despite some 
promising moments, they haven’t really tested Emiliano Martinez.
 
68 min Danzell Gravenberch is on for Tennai Watson.
 
66 min A round of applause as Olivier Giroud replaces Reine-Adelaide.
 
65 min Reading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> force another 
corner, and it’s headed clear. On the follow-up, Kelly spanks it into orbit.
 
64 min McCleary goes clear on the right, and his cross is headed behind by 
Jenkinson.Reading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> take it short, 
but Obita’s cross is missed by everyone.
 
62 min Kermorgant gets up well from Obita’s cross, but Martinez catches well.
 Arsenal’s Emiliano Martinez saves. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  
61 min William Hargreaves makes a salient point: “Is that possession stat 
right, Tim? HaveReading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> had 71% 
of the ball?”

No. Nowehere near! I think there’s a glitch in the matrix. I imagine it’s more 
like 60-40Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>.
 
60 min And Oxlade-Chamberlain dribbles it into the wall. That was hilariously 
bad.
 
59 min Evans escapes a booking after dragging back Elneny following al-Habsi’s 
bum clearance.Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> free kick, 
40 yards from goal.
 
56 min Jaap’s changing things, and Yann Kermorgant replaces Callum Harriott.
  Jeff Reine-Adelaide, centre, is put under pressure from Reading’s Tennai 
Watson, left, and Dominic Samuel. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images  
52 min Already there’s plenty of space, which could give Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> a sniff: they’ve got pace up 
front. But here comes Lucas, and he feeds Maitlin-Niles, whose cross is dross.
 
50 min Perez goes beyond the defence in the inside-left channel, but the angle 
is tight, and his shot is blocked. Again,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> can’t make the corner count.
 
49 min Chamberlain goes through again with Reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading> committed in attack, but 
Blackett does very well to get back and block. Corner to Arsenal, but it’s 
cleared.
 
48 min Arsène Wenger and Bouldy on the Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> bench look reasonably happy. 
That was pretty good from the hosts in the first half, and Iwobi in particular 
looked good.
 
46 min We’re back. No changes for either side.
 
Liverpool lead Tottenham at the break. Paul Doyle has more:
