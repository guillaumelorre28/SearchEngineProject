Chris Sutton climbed off his sick bed to score the winning penalty for Celtic 
againstLivingston <https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston> yesterday 
afternoon, a win which took them three points clear of Rangers at the top of 
the Premierleague.

Sutton wrapped up the points after a contentious second-half decision from the 
referee and then returned to his bed to resume his convalescence for a mystery 
virus, although the manager Martin O'Neill is confident he will be ready for 
next Sunday's Scottish Cup tie with Rangers.

"He did great, especially as he has been pretty ill the last couple of days 
and he was really out on his feet at the end," O'Neill said. "But he is a big 
player for us and he wanted to stay on. He might have been needed had they got 
an equaliser.

"Last night [Saturday] he wasn't good but he wanted to play. He doesn't feel 
great at this minute but he has got a week to recover and we don't want him 
passing it on."

John Hartson fired in his 18th goal of the season to open the scoring and he 
looks likely to sign a new contract this week. "We are pretty pleased with the 
way things have gone and we are hoping things will be resolved," added O'Neill.

Jim Hamilton levelled the scores and several fine saves from Colin Meldrum 
always kept Livingston in it, although their manager Richard Gough was incensed 
with the decision to penalise the scorer for hand-ball. "It's hard enough here 
without losing debatable penalties," he said. "The referee gave it even though 
the linesman, who was closer, never signalled. Jim says the ball hit him and 
it's not intentional."

 Man of the match: Colin Meldrum (Livingston)
