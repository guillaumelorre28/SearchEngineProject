The New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> premier, Mike 
Baird, appears to have regained some approval after a topsy-turvy few months of 
backflips and key staff movements.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> leads 
Labor 53% to 47% in a Fairfax/ReachTEL poll of more than 1600 people reported 
in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday.

The result, just weeks after Troy Grant stood down from the Nationals 
leadership and deputy premiership, is an improvement for the state government 
following a 50-50 result in the same poll in August.

 Baird has also regained the status of preferred premier, taking 50.6% of the 
vote compared with Luke Foley’s 49.4 per cent.

In August, Foley led Baird 51.3% to 48.7%.

The premier admitted the government had “got it wrong” when he backtracked on 
a decision to ban greyhound racing

 in NSW in October.

Almost half (49.3%) of those polled supported the reversal of the ban, while 
32 per cent opposed it, according to the reports.

Grant stood down from his key roles after the Nationals suffered a significant 
swing at theOrange byelection 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/21/shooters-party-wins-orange-byelection-by-50-votes-from-nationals>
, which resulted in the party’s former safe seat going to the Shooters Fishers 
and Farmers party.
