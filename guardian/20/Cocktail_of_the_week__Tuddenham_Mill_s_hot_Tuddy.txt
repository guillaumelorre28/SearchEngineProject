Well, we all need a winter warmer on Bonfire night, don’t we? Serves one.

25ml vodka (we use Wild Knight <http://www.wildknightvodka.co.uk>, an English 
brand made with Norfolk barley)
25ml calvados
½ tsp demerara sugar
100ml apple juice

Put everything in a small saucepan and warm gently, stirring, until the sugar 
dissolves. Serve in a rocks glass.
