The job will be Stam’s first in charge of a senior team, after spells as

Dutchman also becomes Reading’s first non-British manager.

“As a player I wanted to win as many trophies as I could and as a manager I 
have the same ambition,” said Stam. “I am going to do that with Reading and I 
am very happy to do that with this club. Hopefully we can get to the Premier 
League withReading <https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading>.”

Stam won 67 caps for Holland during a 15-year playing career which finished in 
his native homeland with Ajax.

, said: “I am delighted to welcome Jaap to Reading. He was the first choice 
amongst a vast number of applicants interested in the position and we are 
thrilled that we have managed to secure the signature of a manager with such an 
abundance of experience.”

Fellow Dutch duo Andries Ulderink and Said Bakkati are set to join Stam at 
Madejski Stadium as part of his new-look coaching team – having both worked 
with Stam as coaches at Ajax. First-team coaches Steven Reid and Dave Beasant 
will both remain in their positions at the club and will form part of Stam’s 
first-team coaching staff.
