team-mates such as Vidal, Xabi, Tiago and Kimmich. I dedicate the Golden Boy to 
my family. The Champions League? Bayern will win, there is no debate: we are

The France and Bayern winger Kingsley Coman finished third, with Milan’s 
teenage goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma also in the top 10.

Alex Iwobi of Arsenal and Dele Alli of Tottenham Hotspur were among the other 
Premier League players to make the shortlist.
