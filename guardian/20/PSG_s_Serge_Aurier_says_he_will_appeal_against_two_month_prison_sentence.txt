Aurier has appealed against the ruling by a French court concerning the 
incident on 30 May – in which the 23-year-old allegedly elbowed a policeman in 
the throat after being asked to take a breathalyser test as he got into his car 
outside a nightclub on the Champs Elysées, according to reports.

Aurier was also ordered to pay a further €1,500 to cover court costs. “We’re 
appealing. Mr Aurier contests the findings. He’s not guilty and must be 
acquitted,” the player’s lawyer, Claire Boutard de la Combe, said.

The police officers’ witness statements described Aurier as “contemptuous” and 
“belligerent” but the right-back denied the charges and accused the police of 
unnecessary roughness. There is nothing in place to prevent him playing for PSG 
in the foreseeable future and he could travel with the team to Ludogorets for 
Wednesday’s Champions League tie.

This is the latest off-the-field controversy for Aurier: he was suspended by 
PSG for six weeks in February after a video emerged on social media showing the 
23-year-oldmaking derogatory comments

 about the then head coach, Laurent Blanc.

Last season, he was banned for three games by Uefa

 after a Champions League game against Chelsea following a video posted on 
Facebook in which he labelled the referee Bjorn Kuipers a “dirty son of a 
bitch” over the sending-off of his then team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
