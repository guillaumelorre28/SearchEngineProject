<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> third-round draw.

The Hawks looked to be heading out of the competition at Dagenham and Redbridge
, where they had trailed since the fifth minute when the 40-year-old striker 
Jamie Cureton put the League Two side ahead, swivelling before firing low past 
the Whitehawk goalkeeper Craig Ross.

But with the Whitehawk putting pressure on the hosts’ goal, the centre-half 
Rose got his head onto Sam Deering’s cross in the closing seconds to secure a 
1-1 draw and a replay.

A fixture against Premier League opposition in the next round remains a 
possibility for Brighton-based Whitehawk after Rose forced a replay at the 
death in a 1-1 draw.

Non-league Altrincham were on the wrong end of some late drama, though, as the 
League One sideColchester United claimed a 3-2 success at home.

The captain Jake Moult’s measured chip from 30 yards caught Jamie Jones out as 
the U’s fell behind and although Callum Harriott levelled, Michael Rankine put 
Altrincham ahead once more in the second half.

That strike was cancelled out by Tom Lapslie before Harriott fired home from 
just inside the box to ensure Colchester’s progress.

while Antony Sweeney and Danny Grainger were also among the goals.

The National League high-fliers Forest Green Rovers were unable to knock out 
Oxford United as Kemar Roofe’s strike 14 minutes from time earned the League 
Two leaders a 1-0 victory at the Kassam Stadium.

Paul Tisdale’s Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> 
were the only club to eliminate a side from a higher division as they consigned
Port Vale to a 2-0 defeat at St James Park. Jordan Tillson opened the scoring 
and Ollie Watkins added a second late on to secure the Grecians’ passage to 
round three for the first time in 11 years.
