Zlatan Ibrahimovic bid farewell to Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> in style by scoring twice 
and setting up another as the French league champions completed a second 
successive domestic treble by beating Marseille 4-2 in the French Cup final on 
Saturday.

Marseille’s Florian Thauvin cancelled out Blaise Matuidi’s early goal in the 
first half, but Ibrahimovic, playing his final game for the club, took the game 
away from PSG’s bitter rivals after the break.

The Sweden striker scored from the spot before teeing up Edinson Cavani and 
then adding another late goal to wrap up PSG’s 10th French Cup title. Theyhad 
already won Ligue 1

and the League Cup this season.

Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille>, who scored a 
second goal through Michy Batshuayi, were looking to salvage a mediocre season 
after finishing 13th in Ligue 1, but PSG were simply a cut above. PSG went 
ahead after just two minutes when Matuidi latched on to Ángel di María’s cross.

Marseille hit back 10 minutes later when Thauvin fired a low shot past 
Salvatore Sirigu to equalise. PSG upped the pace in the second half and after 
just two minutes, Nicolas N’Koulou brought down Matuidi and Ibrahimovic 
converted the resulting penalty.

In the 57th minute, Cavani wrapped it up with a powerful shot after being 
perfectly set up by Ibrahimovic, who completed the rout after collecting 
Matuidi’s through-ball to slot past Steve Mandanda. Batshuayi reduced the 
arrears three minutes from time but that was scant consolation.
