<http://www.shuttleworths.co.uk/pages/tour.html>, beginning in Swindon on 11 
January and ending up in Sheffield on 30 March.

Thank you so much for sending your questions in. It's been an absolute 
delight. I feel a little bit sad about the questions I couldn't answer due to 
time constraints. I must go now as I have some pressing DIY duties. Ta-ta! Hope 
you can make it to one of my shows in the near future.

Wondering if you have been back to the Shetlands to see if they’re still ‘nice 
up north’. Also wondering if the disaffected youth are still there as my 
husband thinks they’ve moved into our street?

I did return a few years ago. Elma Johnson - the lovely lady in my film, It's 
Nice Up North, has sadly passed away. And Teg Stagg is no longer there. He was 
the nicest Shetlander I met, and he messed up my theory, hailing as he did from 
Devon!

I see he's doing the idents on BBC1 - very flashy! He was a bit posh for me, 
and couldn't hold the video camera steady. Apart from that, a smashing chap. 
And a joy to work with.

'Clare Grogan told me off for criticising her backing vocals'

Who is the most polite celebrity you’ve had in your lounge (and how did they 
take their tea?)

Well, it wasn't Claire Grogan, who told me off for criticising her backing 
vocals. Though we did make it up in the end. I would say Leee John from 
Imagination. What a lovely chap. And the finest rendition of my classic 
Disaffected Youth (apart from my own) that I've ever heard!

I have to say the east, because that's where Ladybower reservoir is, where I 
regularly check the level of. And I suggest you do the same.

No, you're not. And what's happened to the silver foil around a KitKat? And 
are we really happy with the plastic coated Penguin? As for the increased gaps 
in the Toblerone, it's an outrage, and I will be discussing it in the Tasty 
Mint show.

Ooh, that's a hot topic! Yes of course local trees need protecting. Having

Appleton. Is he still working or has he had to get a proper job?

Perhaps Brian has himself died. But I sincerely hope not and that he will 
return at some point in the future. Celebrity deaths is a key topic in my new 
show, My Last Will and Tasty Mint, coming soon to a theatre near you! You see, 
I'm a little worried about my own mortality.

Could you advise a good place to purchase a fawn fleece? Most of my local 
shops don’t seem to stock said apparel.

Obtaining fawn or beige clothing is increasingly a bit of a problem. But it's 
such a lovely shade. Why is this? Try Sue Ryder Remembrance Shop. All items £1 
for a limited period only!

I remember that show - there was a lunatic woman laughing inanely at 
everything, including all the sad bits. She asked me to sign her t-shirt at the 
end. I told her where the bus stop was.

You're referring to a lyric from my obscure but exceptionally good, in my 
humble view, rock ballad Scenes From South Yorkshire. No, I didn't know his 
name, but Shane rhymes with Elaine, which was in the previous line. So, yes.

Thank you so much for sending your questions in. It's been an absolute 
delight. I feel a little bit sad about the questions I couldn't answer due to 
time constraints. I must go now as I have some pressing DIY duties. Ta-ta! Hope 
you can make it to one of my shows in the near future.

I did return a few years ago. Elma Johnson - the lovely lady in my film, It's 
Nice Up North, has sadly passed away. And Teg Stagg is no longer there. He was 
the nicest Shetlander I met, and he messed up my theory, hailing as he did from 
Devon!

I see he's doing the idents on BBC1 - very flashy! He was a bit posh for me,

And a joy to work with.

Well, it wasn't Claire Grogan, who told me off for criticising her backing

I have to say the east, because that's where Ladybower reservoir is, where I

Perhaps Brian has himself died. But I sincerely hope not and that he will 
return at some point in the future. Celebrity deaths is a key topic in my new

I'm a little worried about my own mortality.
