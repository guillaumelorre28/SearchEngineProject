A man who made antisemitic death threats to a Labour MP has admitted further 
charges after sending abusive messages on Twitter.

John Nimmo, 28, from South Shields, sent two emails to Luciana Berger in which 
he said she would “get it like Jo Cox” and “watch your back Jewish scum”. The 
second message to the MP for Liverpool Wavertree included a picture of a large 
knife and came just three weeks after MP Jo Cox was killed.

In a separate incident he also admitted sending offensive emails to an 
anti-hate crime organisation including threatening to blow up a mosque.

Newcastle crown court heard the three further charges related to tweets he 
sent that included messaging someone saying, “watch your back you Jewish inbred 
you’re dead meat, National Action”.

Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health, said the messages had 
caused her “great fear and anguish”. She said the incident had left her in a 
state of “huge distress” and “it caused me to feel physically sick being 
threatened in such a way”.

“I was extremely concerned for my safety and I felt completely under threat. I 
had previously received antisemitic messages and threats but the reference to 
Jo Cox was terrifying,” she said. “The biggest concern was not knowing who this 
was, for all I knew the offender could have resided next door to me.”

Nimmo was jailed in 2014 for eight weeks for sending abusive messages on 
Twitter to feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy. It 
came after Criado-Perez led a campaign using social media for a female figure 
to appear on a Bank of England note.

It included Nimmo telling Criado-Perez to “shut up” and made references to 
rape followed by: “I will find you (smiley face)”.

Nimmo was remanded in custody and told he would be sentenced for all three 
cases on 10 February.
