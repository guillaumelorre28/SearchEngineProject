Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> showed no signs of 
slowing up after Sami Khedira’s second-half goal gave them a 1-0 win at Lazio, 
their second straight win of the season.

Both teams struggled to get going at the Stadio Olimpico and the match was 
halted for a water break in the 28th minute.

Khedira struck in the 66th minute when Paulo Dybala chipped the ball into the 
area and the Germany midfielder held off his marker and cleverly scored with a 
shot on the turn into the far corner.

Lazio <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio>, who lost four times to 
Juventus in all competitions last season and have not beaten the Turin club 
since 2003, nearly took the lead minutes earlier when Marco Parolo failed to 
make contact with Ciro Immobile’s ball across the face of the goal.

Juventus, champions for the last five season, have won 28 out of their last 30 
games inSerie A <https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> and 
Massimiliano Allegri even allowed himself the luxury of starting with new 
signings Gonzalo Higuaín and Miralem Pjanic on the bench.

Higuaín, who scored a record 36 goals for Napoli last season, came on just 
before Juve scored.
