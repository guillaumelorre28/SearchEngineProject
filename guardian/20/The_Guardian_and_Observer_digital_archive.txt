Welcome to the Guardian and Observer Digital Archive

Since 1791, the world's major events have been documented in the pages of the 
Guardian and the Observer. Today, that record of history is available online in 
the shape of theGuardian and Observer Digital Archive 
<http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/guardian/advancedsearch.html>.

Access to the archive is flexible. You can sign up for just 24 hours or for a 
year and the fees are adjusted accordingly. Your money will give you access to:

• 1.2 million replica pages of the Guardian and Observer dating back to 1791
• Almost 13 million articles
• 1000s of photographs

From the battlefields of the Napoleonic Wars to the packed squares of the Arab 
spring; from the first Wimbledon final to London 2012; from JFK to the present 
day, for centuries the Guardian and Observer have been reporting on events that 
have shaped lives around the globe in their individual and distinctive voices.

The new archive was relaunched on 15 November 2012, and houses almost 13 
million articles dating from 1791 up to 2003. It provides researchers, schools, 
universities and other institutions with an invaluable resource across many 
areas of interest, including world affairs, politics, sport, business, culture 
and science. But as well as the big moments in history, the records also mark 
milestones in people's personal lives; the archive includes birth and wedding 
announcements and obituaries. It also stores some classified ads, comics, 
pictures and graphics.

Schools and libraries with a valid subscription can access the professional 
version of the archivehere <http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/>.
