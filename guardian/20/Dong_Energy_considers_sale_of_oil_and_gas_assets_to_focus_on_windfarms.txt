The biggest windfarm operator in the UK is considering selling its oil and gas 
business, four decades after it was set up to manage Denmark’s North Sea 
oilfields.

Dong Energy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy>, which is 
majority owned by the Danish government, said it had appointed JP Morgan to 
perform a strategy review that could result in the sale of the oil and gas 
business.

Offloading oil assets would result in the company, whose initials stand for 
Danish Oil and Natural Gas, focus on wind power instead, completing its 
transformation from fossil fuels to renewables.

Dong did not say whether selling its oil and gas operations would result in a 
change of name and added that it had yet to decide on the division’s future.

The company floated on the Copenhagen stock exchange this year, saying it 
would use the flow of cash from oil sales to fund ongoing investment in 
renewable energy projects.

But on Wednesday, Dong said it might now look to raise funds more quickly by 
selling the division.

Any sale could help it cement its position as the UK’s leading exponent of 
wind power <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower>.

Dong has stakes in windfarms that can produce more than 2.2GW in total, 
equivalent to about 4% of the UK’spredicted peak demand of 52.7GW during cold 
weather

.

It has plans to add a further 1.5GW of wind power capacity, including the 
Hornsea 1 project

 55 miles off the coast of Grimsby, which would be the world’s largest offshore 
windfarm.
