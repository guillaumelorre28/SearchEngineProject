preserved their title hopes with a 1-0 home victory over Málaga thanks to a 
deflected goal by the substitute Ángel Correa in the 62nd minute.

However, the Atlético coach, Diego Simeone, could be facing a three-game ban 
from the touchline after being sent off at half-time when a ball was thrown on 
to the pitch from the technical area.

 and went top on their head-to-head record.

Correa settled a difficult game against Málaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/malaga> five minutes after coming off the 
bench, as his shot from the edge of the penalty area was deflected into the far 
corner.

Simeone watched the second half from the stands. Moments before the interval, 
a ball was thrown on the pitch from the Atlético technical area while Málaga 
set off on a counterattack.

The referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz asked Simeone who had lobbed the ball on and 
sent him off after reportedly not getting an answer.

“It was a very hard match, but we are happy to get another win,” Correa said.
