The Football Association has asked Preston North End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/preston> for their observations following 
Sunday’s pitch invasion at Deepdale where the Chesterfield captain, Ian Evatt, 
claimed he was assaulted by some home fans.

A Lancashire police investigation is ongoing, the constabulary having arrested 
a 20-year-old man on Monday on suspicion of assault. While the force may bring 
criminal proceedings, the FA wants to know what preparations Preston made for 
the League One semi-final second-leg play-off with regard to stewarding and 
other safety procedures.

If Preston, who won the game 3-0  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/10/preston-north-end-chesterfield-league-one-play-off-match-report>
and the tie 4-0 to reach the final, have a case to answer and are subsequently 
found to have been negligent, they will face sanction.

Evatt was apparently targeted as he is a former player for Blackpool, 
Preston’s local rivals. The captain claimed he had been punched, kicked and 
spat at following the final whistle and called for more protection for players.

“To be honest, it’s so disappointing. How long will this go on for until 
there’s a real serious incident? It’s too easy for fans nowadays to invade 
football pitches. Something needs to be done about it,” the 33-year-old said.
