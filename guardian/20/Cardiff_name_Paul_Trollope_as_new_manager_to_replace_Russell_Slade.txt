 at the end of the season and has taken up a new role as head of football. 
Trollope, 43, had been part of Slade’s coaching team since February 2015 and 
has also been a member of Chris Coleman’s Wales backroom staff.

The former Bristol Rovers manager said it was a “no-brainer” to accept the 
offer from Vincent Tan, the owner, to manage a club that have just finished 
eighth in the Championship.

Tan, a Malaysian businessman, has often been accused of interference in team 
affairs, but Trollope promised he would do the job his way.

“I’m honoured to get this position, it’s a good challenge and one I’m looking 
forward to getting started with,” Trollope said. “It’s a good club with a good 
fan base and nice facilities and stadium – and it was an absolute no-brainer to 
do the job.

“Every coach and manager has got their own philosophies, their own way of 
playing, handling players and preparation.

“I’ll bring my own style to that, and anyone who knows me knows that I’ve got 
clear ideas of the way things should be on and off the pitch at a football 
club.”
