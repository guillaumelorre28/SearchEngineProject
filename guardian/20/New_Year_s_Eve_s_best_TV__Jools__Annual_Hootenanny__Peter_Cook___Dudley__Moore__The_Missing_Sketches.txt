Jools’ Annual Hootenanny
 11.20pm, BBC2

Veteran entertainer and all-round groovy fella Jools Holland returns to 
provide his regular aural epilogue to the year. Guest performers joining him to 
usher 2016 politely out of the door include Chaka Khan, Seasick Steve and 
gender-fluid French hitmaker Christine and the Queens. John Cooper Clarke is on 
hand with a poetic postscript to the year, while the Pipes and Drums of the 1st 
Battalion Scots Guards appear to beckon 2017 on board.Mark Gibbings-Jones

Peter Pan Goes Wrong
 6.20pm, BBC1 

Mischief Theatre’s superb play within a play receives a welcome transplant to 
TV. The conceit: a hapless community theatre group stages JM Barrie’s classic, 
only for things to go… well, you can probably guess. The gags – fluffed lines, 
broken props – come thick and fast, all meticulously crafted and very funny. 
Ludicrously good fourth wall-breaking fun, much unlike actual panto. Thesp 
luminary David Suchet puts in a game stint as narrator.Luke Holland

Peter Cook & Dudley Moore: The Missing Sketches
 8pm, Channel 4

With most of Not Only But Also wiped back in the 1970s (“Good housekeeping,” 
sighs BFI rchivist Dick Fiddy, wistfully), here are some recovered Dagenham 
Dialogues and other sketches (including a camp skit with Barry Humphries) that 
haven’t seen the light of day for 50 years. Introduced by Rob Brydon and 
celebrated by the likes of Richard Ayoade, Ronnie Wood and the duo’s producer, 
Dick Clement, they’re a rare treat.Ali Catterall

Alan Carr’s New Year Specstacular 2016
 9pm, Channel 4

Carr warms up the stay-at-home NYE crowd with two hours of chat with 
good-humoured celebrity guests. If the idea of party games with Danny Dyer and 
Sinitta isn’t enough to lure you in, Will Mellor, Gemma Collins, Greg 
Rutherford and Laura Whitmore are also in attendance. Keith Lemon will likely 
joust for centre stage, while Professor Green heads the musical guestlist. 
Guaranteed to be more entertaining than queuing to get into your local.Hannah 
Verdier

Dawn French Live: 30 Million Minutes
 9pm, BBC4

The title here refers to the amount of time Dawn French had spent on the 
planet before she attempted her first solo show in her mid-50s. It was worth 
the wait: French’s standup contains the sort of searing honesty and 
laugh-out-loud moments that come with no longer particularly giving a fig what 
people think. Expect riffs on life lessons and things French “knows to be 
true”. Recorded during its final West End run back in October.Jonathan Wright

CBeebies Bedtime Story
6.50pm, CBeebies

The nightly ritual for parents and pre-schoolers usually has a readily 
recognisable face doing their bit in the soft chair. However, on special 
occasions it goes properly A-list, as it does this evening for the 
award-winning You Must Bring A Hat by Simon Philip and Kate Hindley. Reading it 
aloud, flanked by his sleepy dog Woodstock, is none other than Tom Hardy. They 
return for more tales in the New Year.Jack Seale

André Rieu Double Bill
 7.30pm, Sky Arts

Rieu’s populist take on the classics has lost none of its power to polarise 
so, depending on one’s views of the unabashedly mulletted violinist, this could 
be the New Year’s Eve of your dreams or a brutalisation you will confess 
anything to escape. Up first is a concert in Hanover, including a guest turn by 
Russell Watson, followed by a performance in Vienna, featuring selections by 
Strauss, Lehár and Stolz, among others.Andrew Mueller

Iron Man 2 (Jon Favreau, 2010) 6.35pm, Film4
Uniquely among the horde of Marvel/DC comic-book adaptations, Iron Man is more 
exciting when the superhero is in his civvies. The titanic battles between the 
metal-clad hero and his Russian foe (Mickey Rourke’s twisted giant Ivan Venko) 
are all very well, but Robert Downey Jr is inspired as the eccentric 
billionaire Tony Stark, who confounds the Pentagon top brass. He blasts the 
Iron Man movies towards the heights of the genre.Paul Howlett

The Eagle Has Landed (John Sturges, 1976) 3.20pm, BBC2
Adapted from a Jack Higgins novel, Sturges’s last film focuses on a German 
attempt to kidnap Churchill from a Norfolk village during the second world war. 
Robert Duvall’s Colonel Radl conceives the plan; Michael Caine’s Steiner leads 
it; and Irish nationalist Donald Sutherland helps out (his Oirish accent, and 
Caine’s cockney German, are incidental joys).PH

The Witches of Eastwick (George Miller, 1987) 11.40pm, W
Jack Nicholson is Daryl Van Horne, “a horny little devil” dreamed up by sultry 
trio Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer to banish their Eastwick ennui; 
but he proves rather too stimulating. A spellbinding, sexy comedy, retaining 
the latent threat of John Updike’s clever novel, though the overheated finale 
is disappointing.PH
