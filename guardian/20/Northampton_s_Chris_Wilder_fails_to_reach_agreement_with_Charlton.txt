 to talk to Charlton on Monday following an approach for him and assistant Alan 
Knill.

 read: “Charlton Athletic can confirm that, following discussions with

“The club will now continue its search for a candidate to take the club 
forward. Any further announcements will be made in due course.”

The Cobblers chairman, Kelvin Thomas, said on his side’s official website: “We 
understand there is further interest in Chris and Alan, however we have had no 
official approach at this point but I will be sitting down with Chris to 
discuss further.

“As we said on Monday and in the best interests of the club, we are keen for 
this matter to be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.”

José Riga resigned from his second spell as Addicks manager on Saturday after 
they were beaten 3-0 by Championship winners Burnley. Charlton’s relegation was 
already confirmed and they will join Northampton in League One next season.

The Valley is experiencing turbulent times, with six managers in just over two 
years and widespread supporter unrest.
