 Australia’s two richest people, Gina Rinehart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/scott-morrison-approves-sale-kidman-rinehart-chinese-joint-venture>
 and Harry Triguboff, own more than the poorest 20% of the country’s 
population, research has found.

Worth an estimated combined $21.5bn ($US16.1bn), the nation’s richest woman 
and the Meriton property boss are among the wealthiest 1% of Australians, who 
together own more than the bottom 70%, the report from Oxfam found.

The statistics, published in a global report, An Economy for the 99%, come as 
the world’s political and business leaders gathered for the annual World 
Economic Forum in Switzerland.

Oxfam Australia’s chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said the margin between the 
nation’s rich and poor mirrored a worldwide trend.

“The scale of the global wealth inequality crisis is much, much greater than 
we had feared,” Szoke said on Monday.

Globally, the richest eight people – including the founder of Microsoft, Bill 
Gates, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg –own as much as the poorest half of the 
world’s population 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50>
, or about 3.6bn people.

“Collectively, the world’s richest eight men have a net wealth of $US426bn 
[$A568bn],” Szoke said. “Such an extreme divide between the rich and the rest 
risks plunging future generations into political instability, undermining our 
democratic institutions and creating economic upheaval.”

Despite the world’s wealthiest often being the most generous, Szoke said, 
having so much wealth in the hands of just eight people “highlights how broken 
our economic system really is”.

She called for the federal government to introduce tougher laws that force 
large Australia-based multinational companies to publicly report incomes, 
employees, profits earned and taxes paid in every country of operation.

Szoke said ending the “extreme concentration of wealth” in Australia was 
particularly important given theCentrelink debt recovery crackdown

 affecting some of the most vulnerable people in the country.

Oxfam’s analysis is based on new Credit Suisse data, which reveals that the 
bottom half of the world’s population is significantly worse off than 
previously thought, with far more debt and fewer assets.

The research shows the people in the poorest half of the Australian population 
have little or no combined net wealth, with about 6% of national wealth between 
them. The richest 10% had more income growth – more than 28% – than the poorest 
half of Australians combined.

Szoke said the federal government needed to introduce tougher laws that forced 
large multinationals based in Australia to publicly report incomes, employees, 
profits earned and taxes paid for every country in which they operate.

Previous research by Oxfam estimates that tax dodging by Australian-based 
multinationals is costing nearly $6bn a year in tax revenue in Australia and 
depriving developing countries of nearly $3bn annually.
