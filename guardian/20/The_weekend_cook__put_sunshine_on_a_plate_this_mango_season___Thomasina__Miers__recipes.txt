The sight of boxes of alphonso and sindhri mangoes piled up outside my local 
Lebanese grocer is a sure sign that summer is at last arriving. Unlike those 
hard, green mangoes you find in supermarkets all year round, these ones are 
sweet, fragrant and so irresistibly juicy that they need to be cut open and 
devoured in close proximity to a tap (or stream), for cleaning sticky hands and 
chin afterwards. Although these mangoes are wonderful for breakfast or in 
salads, they also make a glorious and simple chutney for eating over the summer 
with onion bhajis, barbecued chicken or grilled fish. Pudding-wise, I look to 
Mexico for inspiration (well, of course I do), where rice pudding is not the 
hot, cold-weather dish we know here, but a light, chilled pudding scented with 
vanilla and citrus. It’s the perfect pudding for a sunny day.

Flattened tandoori chicken thighs with mango relish

The relish is quick to make and is lovely with this spiced chicken, which can 
be cooked under the grill or on the barbecue, depending on the weather. Serves 
four.

8 skinless and boneless chicken thighs
3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
½ small thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1 small red chilli, roughly chopped
½ tsp turmeric powder
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp paprika
150g natural yoghurt

For the mango relish
150g soft brown sugar
150ml white-wine vinegar
1 star anise
½ red onion, peeled and very finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped
1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 tsp black mustard seeds
1 red chilli, finely chopped
3-4 ripe, sweet mangoes, stoned, peeled and roughly chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

First prepare the chicken. Put each thigh between two sheets of clingfilm and 
flatten by bashing with a rolling pin until it’s roughly 1cm thick. Put the 
flattened, tenderised chicken in a bowl. In a pestle and mortar, bash the 
garlic, ginger and chilli to a rough paste, then add to the bowl with the 
remaining chicken ingredients, rubbing in the marinade so the meat is coated. 
Refrigerate while while you make the relish.

Put the sugar and vinegar in a saucepan on a medium-low heat, bring to a boil 
and, once the sugar has dissolved, stir in all the other ingredients and add a 
good pinch each of salt and pepper. Leave to simmer for 25-30 minutes, until 
the liquid has reduced, then take off the heat, adjust the seasoning to taste, 
then set aside to cool.

Heat the grill (or barbecue). Season the chicken all over, then lay on a rack 
set over an oven tray. Grill for 10-12 minutes, turning it halfway through. 
When the chicken is brown at the edges and cooked though (check by cutting into 
a thigh: if the juices run clear, it’s done), transfer to plates and serve with 
the relish alongside. To bulk it up into a full meal, add a light cucumber 
salad and/or a cardamom rice salad with flaked almonds and dried apricots.

Wholegrain jasmine rice has a gorgeous nuttiness, but use white jasmine if 
need be. Coconut sugar is now widely available in delis, healthfood shops and 
online, and has wonderful butterscotch notes, but soft brown sugar will work if 
you can’t find any. Serves four to six.

150g Thai jasmine wholegrain rice
25g coconut sugar
30g caster sugar
400g tin coconut milk, plus one tin’s worth of cold water
½ tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp orange blossom water (optional)
Juice and zest of 2 limes
1-2 handfuls unsweetened flaked coconut
2 alphonso mangoes
100-150ml coconut (or Greek) yoghurt

Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. In a 500ml ovenproof dish, mix the 
rice, sugars, coconut milk, water, vanilla, orange blossom water (if using) and 
lime zest. Stir in a tablespoon of lime juice, then bake for about 90 minutes, 
until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid but is still moist; give it a 
stir every half-hour or so. Check the grains: they should be plump and tender. 
If they are not, bake for 15 minutes longer, or until cooked. Meanwhile, spread 
the flaked coconut in a baking tray and toast in the same oven until pale gold 
all over.

Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven, leave to cool, then 
cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least two hours.

When you’re ready to eat, peel, stone and dice the mango (it really doesn’t 
matter if the pieces aren’t all a perfect, uniform size), then toss with the 
remaining lime juice. Stir the yoghurt through the pudding (you’re aiming for a 
lovely, loose consistency that drops easily from the spoon, a bit like a wet 
risotto), then serve topped with the mangoes and toasted coconut.

And for the rest of the week…

Indian and Pakistani mangoes have a relatively short season, so make the most 
of them while you can. They make fantastic sorbets, ice-creams and lassis, or 
eat them as they do in Mexico, in a simple fruit salad mixed with fresh lime 
juice and a sprinkling of blitzed dried chilli, lemon zest, sugar and salt. One 
of my favouite ways to serve the mango relish is to stuff a pitta with a 
simple, last-minute pea and potato curry and some crisp baby gem, all topped 
with a big spoonful of the chutney. With the rice pudding, you could cut down 
the sugar a little and add a few tablespoons of chia seeds – that would also 
make a beautiful, nutritious and unusual breakfast. Leftover coconut flakes can 
be toasted and added to muesli for a sweet, nutty touch.
