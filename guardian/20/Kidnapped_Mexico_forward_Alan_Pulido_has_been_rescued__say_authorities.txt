Mexican authorities say Alan Pulido has been rescued after an hours-long 
kidnapping in the north-east border state of Tamaulipas.

According to the Tamaulipas security coordination group for Mexico’s security 
forces, the rescue occurred shortly before midnight, and the 25-year-old was 
taken to be medically assessed.

Pulido plays for the Greek club Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> and has been capped six 
times. The club wrote on Twitter: “Alan is safe and healthy with his family. We 
thank each and every one of you for your concern and prayers in these difficult 
times.”

Six masked men reportedly took the striker away on Saturday night while his 
girlfriend was left unharmed in a car park after they left a party outside his 
hometown of Ciudad Victoria, the state capital of Tamaulipas

Pulido joined Olympiakos last July and scored six goals in 15 games last 
season. He had been part of Mexico’s squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil but 
was not called up for this summer’s Copa America.
