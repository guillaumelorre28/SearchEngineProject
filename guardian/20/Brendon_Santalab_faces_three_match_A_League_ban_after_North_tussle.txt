Substitute Santalab was red carded for a swinging arm to the head of Brisbane 
Roar defender Jade North as they tussled for the ball in their 1-1 draw at 
Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Friday.

With the youngster Lachlan Scott preferred to the veteran, Santalab came on as 
a second half substitute and picked up a yellow card shortly thereafter.

His fracas with North earned the former Sydney FC player a straight red card 
however – the first of hisA-League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> career.

The panel consisting of Simon Micallef, Alan Davidson and Adam D’Apuzzo found 
him guilty on Tuesday and proposed a two-match sanction for the incident that 
felled North.

The yellow card received in the 66th minute then triggered a mandatory 
one-match ban as he had accumulated five yellow cards for the season.

Santalab has to serve this sanction in addition to the latest ban proposed by 
the panel.

The striker has until midday on Wednesday to appeal against the 
violent-conduct finding and faces missing the sixth-placed Wanderers’ next 
three matches against Perth Glory (home), Melbourne City (away) and the derby 
against Sydney FC.

In 2014 his former club lodged a complaint with the FFA claiming the striker 
had racially abused his opponent Iraqi Ali Abbas, allegations which the 
disciplinary committee dismissed citing a lack of evidence.
