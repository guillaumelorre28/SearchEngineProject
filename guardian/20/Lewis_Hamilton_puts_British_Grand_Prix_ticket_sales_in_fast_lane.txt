Lewis Hamilton's storming start to the Formula One world championship has 
boosted ticket sales for theBritish Grand Prix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-grand-prix> on 6 July.

There has been much criticism of F1 following the first two races in Australia 
and Malaysia. The Australian GP race chairman Ron Walker threatened to sue 
because of the quieter engines and the lack of entertainment. Other promoters 
and F1's chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, have also been critical of the 
engines.

"Ticket sales are on a par with what we saw last year, which is good news," 
said Silverstone's managing director, Richard Phillips, who is attending the 
Bahrain Grand Prix. "We actually saw a spike after Lewis Hamilton's victory in 
Malaysia, which is a real positive. From what we have discovered, the fans are 
really intrigued as to the sights and sounds of this newFormula One

"Yes, the engines are quieter but we do not feel it will have any impact on 
our event, quite the opposite, and we believe by the time we stage our race, 
the cars will be a lot quicker as the teams understand more about the new power 
units and the regulations."

Hamilton took pole in both races so far and won the second, and is second in 
the world championship to his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Three-day ticket holders will be able to visit the Silverstone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/silverstone> pits on the Thursday of the 
British Grand Prix after Ecclestone gave his approval.

Phillips said: "We've spoken to Bernie and he has confirmed it's OK. We have 
considered doing something like this before, so we are delighted it is going to 
happen this year."
