The midfielder said he was delighted with the move, which gives him a better 
chance of first-team football than he might expect in Manchester.

“I’m delighted to join Huddersfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/huddersfield> Town Football Club, ahead 
of what I’m sure will be a really exciting season,” he said. “Huddersfield are 
a progressive club and are an ideal fit for me to achieve my goals for the 
coming year.”

Mooy will have plenty of chances to impress at Huddersfield. Unlike the 
A-League, which has just 27 league fixtures, Mooy will be thrown into the 
rigours of theChampionship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>.

In addition to the 46 home-and-away fixtures and any cup ties, Mooy will also 
be required for Socceroos duty as Ange Postecoglou’s squad attempt to qualify 
for the 2018 World Cup.

Mooy’s agent, Paddy Dominguez, said the West Yorkshire club would be a “great 
next step” under coach David Wagner, a former colleague of Liverpool 
coach Jürgen Klopp.

“Every decision Aaron has made has been strategically planned with a view to 
him having a good opportunity to get a lot of games and work with the right 
coach,” he said.

“David Wagner has done brilliant work with Jürgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund 
and is exactly the kind of coach that will help Aaron progress his game to the 
next level.”

Mooy will also have a Socceroos team-mate for company at Huddersfield – left 
back Jason Davidson joined the Terriers last year.
