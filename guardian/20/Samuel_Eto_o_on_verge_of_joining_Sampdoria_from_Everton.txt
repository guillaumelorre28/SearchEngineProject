 on Tuesday.

The Genoa club has been in talks with Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> and Eto’o’s representatives in 
recent weeks with a view to completing the move for the 33-year-old.

“Eto’o should be here in Genoa on Tuesday,” their sporting director Carlo Osti 
told the Italian TV station Telenord.

Eto’o, who joined Everton only five months ago from Chelsea, is set to sign an 
18-month contract.

The 33-year-old has reportedly reduced his wages by 40% in order to return to 
Serie A.

The former Cameroon striker spent two seasons at Internazionale and was a 
member of the Nerazzurri’s 2010 treble-winning side that won the Serie A title, 
Coppa Italia and Champions League under José Mourinho.

Osti, whose side sold their top scorer Manolo Gabbiadini to Napoli earlier 
this month, also said that the Colombia striker Luis Muriel and Italian 
defender Andrea Coda will be joiningSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> later this week from Udinese.

Both players had agreed terms last week and Osti said: “The signings of Muriel 
and Coda will become official shortly.”

Sampdoria, who are coached by Sinisa Mihajlovic, are flying high in Serie A 
this season and are currently fourth in the standings, level on 33 points with 
third-placed Napoli.
