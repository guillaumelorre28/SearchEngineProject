FULL TIME: Manchester United 1-0 Sheffield United

And that’s that! Manchester United make it through, right at the end, thanks 
to a determined run by Memphis and a preposterous sliding tackle by Hammond. 
The home side weren’t very good, but theywere the side doing all the attacking 
in that second half, so you could certainly make a case - albeit not a 
particularly strong or convincing one - that they just about deserved that. 
Just about. Maybe. Though whatever your position there, you have to feel sorry 
for a very brave and impressive Sheffield United. Louis van Gaal waves to the 
fans as he disappears down the tunnel, but one bloke gives him a very 
conspicuous double thumbs down. Still, that’s a misfiringManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> in the hat for the 
fourth round. Louis van Gaal’s Mark Robins moment?

90 min +6: Flynn shapes to shoot from 25 yards, but finds his effort blocked. 
From the breakdown, Basham goes clattering into Memphis in the frustrated 
style, and he’s in the book.

90 min +5: Hammond looks to make amends by scooping a long ball down the 
right, allowing Flynn to cause a bit of bother down that wing. But Rooney 
snuffs out the danger.

Penalty to Manchester United!

90 min +2: Memphis has been Manchester United’s best player since coming on. 
He dribbles at pace down the left, and enters the area. Hammond slides across 
and clips him on the shin. Memphis doesn’t need asking twice. He goes down, and 
Rooney will have the chance to seal the win from the spot!

The first two are used up by a substitution farce.Sheffield United

Done, but Sammon goes down injured as the board goes up, and so he eventually

89 min: Manchester United are pressing, pressing, pressing. If only they’d 
played like this from the get-go. Memphis cuts in from the left again, and 
sends a fierce drive inches wide left from 25 yards. Again. And up go the 
ironic cheers. This is getting old. “This, this right here is peak Van Gaal,” 
argues David Flynn. “And the worst part about it is he’ll probably be 
delighted. A dour 0-0 with a massive amount of possession is basically a win in 
his mind.”

87 min: Martial is fairly cynically knocked off the ball by Basham. Free kick 
for United, 30 yards out on the right. The ball’s hooked into the area. Edgar’s 
clearing header is awful, dropping to the feet of Martial, eight yards out. He 
must score! But his snapped shot is blocked by an absurdly good dive from 
Brayford, who has spread himself bravely - and legitimately - in front of the 
striker. The ball breaks right to Smalling, who should still slam home, but he 
executes a perfect fresh-air kick. Oops.Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> survive, somehow.

83 min: Schweinsteiger was waving his arm in panic and agony as he went down, 
never a pleasant thing to see. But it does look as though he’s just momentarily 
jarred something, and after a couple of minutes is back on, albeit not running 
in the full and free style. But that’s good to see.

81 min: Pereira, deep on the left, swings a long diagonal pass to Lingard, 
coming into theSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> area from the right. He 
heads down for Martial, whose attempt to sweep home is immediately blocked. The 
ball breaks to Schweinsteiger on the edge of the area. He has a crack at the 
ball, but only succeeds in jarring his knee as he clatters into Basham, who was 
attempting to clear. A fair and innocent challenge, but Schweinsteiger looks in 
a bit of trouble here.

79 min: It is slightly difficult to parse the exact mood of the Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> crowd, though. 
Pereira is sent on for Fellaini, whose exit is cheered fairly lustily. 
Sheffield United make a change too, swapping the injured McEveley for Reed.

77 min: Sarcasm and gallows humour is one thing. But Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> fans aren’t having 
their opposite number singing “You’re getting sacked in the morning” at their 
manager. They drown that one out with a blast of “Glory, Glory Man United”.

75 min: Darmian, down the right, cuts the ball back for Fellaini, who shuttles 
it further back for Schweinsteiger. The German World Cup winner takes a swing 
at the ball, carving it miles to the left of the goal. He has the good grace to 
look thoroughly miserable at what he’s just done.

73 min: Fellaini channels his inner Garrincha and embarks on a tricky meander 
down the right. He earns a corner, which Smalling flicks goalwards. Collins 
clears the danger. Finally, the home side are beginning to impose themselves on 
this match.

70 min: Memphis is certainly in the mood for this. He dribbles with extreme 
prejudice into the Sheffield United box down the left. And very nearly breaks 
through a bank of four white shirts. Not quite, but this is much, much better 
fromManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. 
They’ve looked decent since the double substitution.

69 min: A United effort on target! Darmian picks up a loose Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> clearance, cuts into the 
area, and toe-pokes a weak shot towards the bottom right. The home faithful 
whistle, then give it the big cheer again. Plenty of smiles in the stand, 
though; they’re seeing the gallows humour in this. Moaning’s half the fun of 
football anyway. The most enjoyable bit, some would say.

67 min: Basham has a bash from 25 yards himself. It’s straight at De Gea, and 
not particularly well hit. The keeper gathers with a yawn. But that’s the first 
effort on target by either side, which is an astonishing statistic, and kind of 
backs up what the Old Trafford crowd have just been arguing via the medium of 
frustrated bellow.

66 min: Manchester United are beginning to apply a little pressure, with 
Sheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> sitting 
very deep. And suddenly Memphis cuts in from the left, and sends a screamer 
wide left from 25 yards. It’s not miles away. Old Trafford erupts in ironic 
cheering at that sudden injection of pace and attacking intent. That’s a shot 
across Van Gaal’s bows all right.

64 min: Sheffield United make their first change. Sharp looks utterly 
miserable as he’s hooked, disappointed to be making way for Flynn. A bit of 
anger and irritation, but just the right side of open dissent. It’ll be Sammon 
ploughing a lone furrow up front.

62 min: Lingard’s first contribution is a purposeful run down the right. His 
ball inside doesn’t find a man, and the move breaks down, but there’s a sign 
thatManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
are looking to up the tempo now. The Old Trafford faithful have found their

58 min: Martial, from a position deep on the left, curls a deep cross to the 
far post. McEveley takes no chances and heads behind for a corner, though there 
was nobody near him. The set piece is worked backwards to Herrera, who sends an 
aimless ball into the box from the right wing. It’s smothered by Long.

55 min: Mata gifts the ball to Basham in the centre circle. He sends Sharp 
romping into space down the right, but the striker has neither the pace nor 
support to do any real damage. But there’s a second wave of attack, and Coutts 
bursts into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> box down the right. He 
reaches the byline, swans past Schweinsteiger and looks for Sammon in the 
middle. Mata steps in to brilliantly block, intercept and clear. He owed his 
team-mates that after starting the whole affair with that loose pass.

54 min: Manchester United are enjoying the lion’s share of possession, though, 
attempting to grindSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> down. Mata and Darmian 
take turns to glide crosses into the Sheffield Untied box from the right. 
Collins and Edgar are battering every centre away, however, meat and drink for

51 min: There’s definitely a strange atmosphere at Old Trafford right now, 
with the home team failing to click. It would be melodramatic to describe it as 
mutinous, but there’s a little something in the air. When Fellaini allows a 
simple pass to clank between his legs and sail backwards behind him, there’s a 
loud mix of resigned laughter and irritation. Bleak humour the top note right 
now, but it might turn if this performance gets much worse.

49 min: Mata’s in a little space down the right. His looping cross is gathered 
by Long at the near post without much fuss.

48 min: Nothing whatsoever going on right now. The Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> fans are informed that 
the late trains back to Yorkshire are buggered, and if they could take earlier 
trains home, i.e. when the match is still on, the privatised firm running this 
shambles would be most grateful. They borrow a ditty from the home supporters, 
and belt out a rendition of “We do what we want.”

And we're off again!

No changes to either side. Sheffield United get the ball rolling for the 
second half.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> will be kicking 
towards the Stretford End, and hoping for an injection of Wonderfuel Gas.

HALF TIME: Manchester United 0-0 Sheffield United

And that’s that for the first half. The home team walk off to a smattering of 
boos, which are quickly drowned out by a blast of Glory, Glory Man United from 
the Old Trafford PA. Again, a little Saturday night satire. It’s like TW3 was 
never taken off air.

45 min +3: Coutts needlessly brings down Martial with the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> man going nowhere down 
the left. It’s effectively a corner. Rooney pulls the ball back to Blind, on 
the edge of the area. A beautiful conversion in the rugby-union style.

And that’s that! Manchester United make it through, right at the end, thanks 
to a determined run by Memphis and a preposterous sliding tackle by Hammond. 
The home side weren’t very good, but theywere the side doing all the attacking 
in that second half, so you could certainly make a case - albeit not a 
particularly strong or convincing one - that they just about deserved that. 
Just about. Maybe. Though whatever your position there, you have to feel sorry 
for a very brave and impressive Sheffield United. Louis van Gaal waves to the 
fans as he disappears down the tunnel, but one bloke gives him a very 
conspicuous double thumbs down. Still, that’s a misfiringManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> in the hat for the 
fourth round. Louis van Gaal’s Mark Robins moment?

From the breakdown, Basham goes clattering into Memphis in the frustrated

90 min +5: Hammond looks to make amends by scooping a long ball down the 
right, allowing Flynn to cause a bit of bother down that wing. But Rooney 
snuffs out the danger.
 
90 min +4: But what a stupid challenge by Hammond, who looks utterly 
distraught.

90 min +2: Memphis has been Manchester United’s best player since coming on. 
He dribbles at pace down the left, and enters the area. Hammond slides across 
and clips him on the shin. Memphis doesn’t need asking twice. He goes down, and 
Rooney will have the chance to seal the win from the spot!

90 min: It’s far from over yet, of course. There will be six added minutes. 
The first two are used up by a substitution farce.Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> look to swap Coutts for 
Done, but Sammon goes down injured as the board goes up, and so he eventually 
makes way instead. We might be seeing more than six added minutes.

89 min: Manchester United are pressing, pressing, pressing. If only they’d 
played like this from the get-go. Memphis cuts in from the left again, and 
sends a fierce drive inches wide left from 25 yards. Again. And up go the 
ironic cheers. This is getting old. “This, this right here is peak Van Gaal,” 
argues David Flynn. “And the worst part about it is he’ll probably be 
delighted. A dour 0-0 with a massive amount of possession is basically a win in 
his mind.”

87 min: Martial is fairly cynically knocked off the ball by Basham. Free kick 
for United, 30 yards out on the right. The ball’s hooked into the area. Edgar’s 
clearing header is awful, dropping to the feet of Martial, eight yards out. He 
must score! But his snapped shot is blocked by an absurdly good dive from 
Brayford, who has spread himself bravely - and legitimately - in front of the 
striker. The ball breaks right to Smalling, who should still slam home, but he 
executes a perfect fresh-air kick. Oops.Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> survive, somehow.
 
85 min: This game is a proper shapeless mess right now. It’s very open, which 
will probably suitManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. But no passes are 
sticking.
 
83 min: Schweinsteiger was waving his arm in panic and agony as he went down, 
never a pleasant thing to see. But it does look as though he’s just momentarily 
jarred something, and after a couple of minutes is back on, albeit not running 
in the full and free style. But that’s good to see.
 
81 min: Pereira, deep on the left, swings a long diagonal pass to Lingard, 
coming into theSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> area from the right. He 
heads down for Martial, whose attempt to sweep home is immediately blocked. The 
ball breaks to Schweinsteiger on the edge of the area. He has a crack at the 
ball, but only succeeds in jarring his knee as he clatters into Basham, who was 
attempting to clear. A fair and innocent challenge, but Schweinsteiger looks in 
a bit of trouble here.
 
79 min: It is slightly difficult to parse the exact mood of the Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> crowd, though. 
Pereira is sent on for Fellaini, whose exit is cheered fairly lustily. 
Sheffield United make a change too, swapping the injured McEveley for Reed.
 
77 min: Sarcasm and gallows humour is one thing. But Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> fans aren’t having 
their opposite number singing “You’re getting sacked in the morning” at their 
manager. They drown that one out with a blast of “Glory, Glory Man United”.

75 min: Darmian, down the right, cuts the ball back for Fellaini, who shuttles 
it further back for Schweinsteiger. The German World Cup winner takes a swing 
at the ball, carving it miles to the left of the goal. He has the good grace to 
look thoroughly miserable at what he’s just done.
 
74 min: Martial tries to break down the inside-right channel, but his run is 
tracked by Coutts, who steps in front of his man, then plays the ball off 
Lingard to win a goal kick forSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited>.
 
73 min: Fellaini channels his inner Garrincha and embarks on a tricky meander 
down the right. He earns a corner, which Smalling flicks goalwards. Collins 
clears the danger. Finally, the home side are beginning to impose themselves on 
this match.
 
70 min: Memphis is certainly in the mood for this. He dribbles with extreme 
prejudice into the Sheffield United box down the left. And very nearly breaks 
through a bank of four white shirts. Not quite, but this is much, much better 
fromManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. 
They’ve looked decent since the double substitution.
 
69 min: A United effort on target! Darmian picks up a loose Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> clearance, cuts into the 
area, and toe-pokes a weak shot towards the bottom right. The home faithful 
whistle, then give it the big cheer again. Plenty of smiles in the stand, 
though; they’re seeing the gallows humour in this. Moaning’s half the fun of 
football anyway. The most enjoyable bit, some would say.
 
67 min: Basham has a bash from 25 yards himself. It’s straight at De Gea, and 
not particularly well hit. The keeper gathers with a yawn. But that’s the first 
effort on target by either side, which is an astonishing statistic, and kind of 
backs up what the Old Trafford crowd have just been arguing via the medium of 
frustrated bellow.
 
66 min: Manchester United are beginning to apply a little pressure, with 
Sheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> sitting 
very deep. And suddenly Memphis cuts in from the left, and sends a screamer 
wide left from 25 yards. It’s not miles away. Old Trafford erupts in ironic 
cheering at that sudden injection of pace and attacking intent. That’s a shot 
across Van Gaal’s bows all right.
 
64 min: Sheffield United make their first change. Sharp looks utterly 
miserable as he’s hooked, disappointed to be making way for Flynn. A bit of 
anger and irritation, but just the right side of open dissent. It’ll be Sammon 
ploughing a lone furrow up front.

62 min: Lingard’s first contribution is a purposeful run down the right. His 
ball inside doesn’t find a man, and the move breaks down, but there’s a sign 
thatManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
are looking to up the tempo now. The Old Trafford faithful have found their 
voice, too, urging their lads to pick it up a bit.
 
60 min: Borthwick-Jackson bursts down the left and earns a throw deep in 
Sheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> 
territory. Before that can be taken, Mata and Herrera are sacrificed for 
Memphis and Lingard. And then the throw comes to nowt.
 
58 min: Martial, from a position deep on the left, curls a deep cross to the 
far post. McEveley takes no chances and heads behind for a corner, though there 
was nobody near him. The set piece is worked backwards to Herrera, who sends an 
aimless ball into the box from the right wing. It’s smothered by Long.
 
55 min: Mata gifts the ball to Basham in the centre circle. He sends Sharp 
romping into space down the right, but the striker has neither the pace nor 
support to do any real damage. But there’s a second wave of attack, and Coutts 
bursts into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> box down the right. He 
reaches the byline, swans past Schweinsteiger and looks for Sammon in the 
middle. Mata steps in to brilliantly block, intercept and clear. He owed his 
team-mates that after starting the whole affair with that loose pass.
 
54 min: Manchester United are enjoying the lion’s share of possession, though, 
attempting to grindSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> down. Mata and Darmian 
take turns to glide crosses into the Sheffield Untied box from the right. 
Collins and Edgar are battering every centre away, however, meat and drink for 
the big lads.
 
52 min: Schweinsteiger lumps a long, long ball straight into the arms of Long. 
That’ll be testing a few folk’s patience.
 
51 min: There’s definitely a strange atmosphere at Old Trafford right now, 
with the home team failing to click. It would be melodramatic to describe it as 
mutinous, but there’s a little something in the air. When Fellaini allows a 
simple pass to clank between his legs and sail backwards behind him, there’s a 
loud mix of resigned laughter and irritation. Bleak humour the top note right 
now, but it might turn if this performance gets much worse.
 
49 min: Mata’s in a little space down the right. His looping cross is gathered 
by Long at the near post without much fuss.
 
48 min: Nothing whatsoever going on right now. The Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> fans are informed that 
the late trains back to Yorkshire are buggered, and if they could take earlier 
trains home, i.e. when the match is still on, the privatised firm running this 
shambles would be most grateful. They borrow a ditty from the home supporters, 
and belt out a rendition of “We do what we want.”
 
No changes to either side. Sheffield United get the ball rolling for the 
second half.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> will be kicking 
towards the Stretford End, and hoping for an injection of Wonderfuel Gas.
 
Half-time entertainment. In lieu of third-round shocks this year ...

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/07/fa-cup-third-round-field-notes> 
And that’s that for the first half. The home team walk off to a smattering of 
boos, which are quickly drowned out by a blast of Glory, Glory Man United from 
the Old Trafford PA. Again, a little Saturday night satire. It’s like TW3 was 
never taken off air.
 
45 min +3: Coutts needlessly brings down Martial with the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> man going nowhere down 
the left. It’s effectively a corner. Rooney pulls the ball back to Blind, on 
the edge of the area. A beautiful conversion in the rugby-union style.
 
45 min +2: Brayford finds himself near the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> right-hand corner 
flag. He whips a cross towards the near post. De Gea claims a tricky ball with 
graceful ease.
 
45 min +1: Borthwick-Jackson has a dig from distance. Nope.
 
45 min: There will be three added minutes of this first half.
 
44 min: ... and welts a witless free kick straight in the Sheffield United 
wall. His frustration mounts whenSheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> are awarded a cheap 
pressure-relieving free kick when Fellaini lightly brushes Basham, winning the 
ball fairly in the process. Rooney gets right up in referee Jon Moss’s grille; 
he’ll need to be careful.

43 min: The set piece is played short for Mata, who fires a low pass down the 
middle. Herrera can’t control. ButManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> come again, with Mata 
attempting to flick the ball past Basham. The Sheffield United man sticks out a 
hand, and that’s a free kick 25 yards from goal. A very dangerous position. 
Rooney steps up ...
 
42 min: Coutts tugs Mata in the middle of the Sheffield United half. That’ll 
be a free kick, out on the left, and a chance forManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> to load the box. 
Before it can be taken, Coutts needs a bit of treatment.
