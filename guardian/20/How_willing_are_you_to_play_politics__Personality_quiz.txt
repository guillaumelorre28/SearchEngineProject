Many careers involve a good deal of political gamesmanship – characterised as 
‘sucking up’ and ‘slapping down’. But how willing and able are you to do this? 
A recent study conducted at Stanford University suggests that the answer 
depends (among other things) on social class. Measuring class is never 
straightforward, but one of the most widely used measures is this question:

Does at least one of your parents have a university degree? If you answered 
“yes” then – for the purposes of this exercise, at least – you’re middle class.

If you answered “no”, you’re working class (unless you plan to live off 
inherited wealth instead; in which case you are probably upper class).

In the same study, participants were told about a fictional company where what 
you needed most to rise up the ranks was “pragmatic political skill”. They were 
then asked: “Keeping in mind the things you need to do to get to the top, at 
which level do you most want to be in this organisation?”

1 Assistant consultant (lowest position)
2 Associate consultant
3 Consultant
4 Senior consultant
5 Managing consultant
6 Principal consultant (highest position)

Working-class participants were less likely to aspire to the highest 
positions. This wasn’t because they felt that they lacked competence, but 
playing politics simply wasn’t them. This is bad news for social mobility, 
which seems to require working-class people to engage in some behaviours that, 
according to follow-up questions in the study, they found distasteful (but that 
are second nature to the “sharp-elbowed middle class”).
