The nominations for the 15th National Dance awards 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Dance_Awards> have just been announced – 
whittled down from a long list of nearly 400 names, and from a year’s worth of 
performances that took place between 1 September 2013 and 31 August 2014.

A new category, the emerging artist award, was added this year to ensure 
younger and less established dancers and choreographers made the final cut. 
Ever since the awards were established, there has been a debate among voting 
critics about how to keep the number of categories within manageable and 
affordable limits while still representing as wide a spectrum of talent as 
possible.

In this round of awards, it is noticeable how fluid the boundaries of each 
category can be.Arthur Pita <http://www.arthurpita.com/>, for instance, has 
been nominated in both contemporary and classical choreographer categories, 
whileAkram Khan <http://www.akramkhancompany.net/>’s two nominations as dancer 
and choreographer of Dust both appear in the contemporary categories, even 
though the work itself was commissioned and performed byEnglish National Ballet 
<http://www.ballet.org.uk/>.

That blurring of the contemporary/classical divide is a measure of how fluid 
the dance scene has become, just as the nomination of 22-year-oldFrancesca 
Hayward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/19/francesca-hayward-next-great-ballerina>
 as both emerging and outstanding dancer is a measure of her fast-blooming 
talent.

Given that 50 dance writers from across the UK have nominated up to five names 
per category, it is inevitable that each of us will have issues with the list. 
I may be breakingCritics’ Circle <http://www.criticscircle.org.uk/> protocol by 
wishing publicly thatHetain Patel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/22/hetain-patel-american-boy-review>
 andAkane Takada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/28/royal-ballet-sleeping-beauty-review>
 had appeared among the outstanding dancer nominations; that Mark Morris’s 
maverick little masterpiece,A Wooden Tree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/29/mark-morris-dance-group-sadlers-wells-review>
, had appeared in the contemporary choreography list; and that somewhere in all 
these nominations would be a reflection of the fact that, for me, the 
Mariinsky’s performance ofAlexei Ratmansky 
<http://www.abt.org/education/archive/choreographers/ratmansky_a.html>’s 
Concerto DSCH was one ofthe great dance events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/14/mariinksy-ballet-mixed-programme-review-firebird>
 of the year.

Even so, when the winners of each category are announced on 26 January 2015, 
it promises to be a vintage list.
