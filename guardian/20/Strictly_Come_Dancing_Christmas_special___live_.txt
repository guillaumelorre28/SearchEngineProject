Evening all, and I hope you’re having a wonderful Christmas Day. It’s time to 
add a little extra sparkle to your celebrations, with a Christmas movie-themed 
Strictly special. Frankie Bridge, Denise Lewis, Ainsley Harriott, Pamela 
Stephenson Connolly, Gethin Jones and Melvin Odoom will be taking a turn around 
the dancefloor this evening, paying tribute to all our festive family film 
favourites.

My money’s on Frankie for the win – she’s dressing up as Elsa from Frozen, so 
definitely time to gather the children around the TV like they used to in days 
of yore. Talking of which, Matt Goss is singing White Christmas, because 
Strictly is the 80s gift that keeps on giving.

There’s no official liveblog for tonight’s Strictly Come Dancing Christmas 
special <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m8dq>, but we’d still love you to 
spread a little wit, wisdom and sparkle in the comment box below. It’s Len’s 
final hurrah, so make room for a final pickled walnut and a Christmas ten from 
Len.
