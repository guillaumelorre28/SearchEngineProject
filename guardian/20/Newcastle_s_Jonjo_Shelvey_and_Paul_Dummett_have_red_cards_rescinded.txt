Shelvey was sent off by referee Steven Martin in the 33rd minute for violent 
conduct for apparently kicking out at Henri Lansbury’s face when both men were 
prone on the turf in the penalty area after challenging for the ball.

Lansbury was also inadvertently involved in Dummett’s dismissal on the stroke 
of half-time when the midfielder was through on goal, only to appear to be 
brought down by the defender.

“Both Jonjo Shelvey and Paul Dummett have had their suspensions withdrawn with 
immediate effect after their wrongful dismissal claims were successful 
following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing,” read an FA statement. 
“TheNewcastle United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> 
pair were dismissed for violent conduct and denying an obvious goal scoring 
opportunity respectively during the game against Nottingham Forest on 2 
December 2016.”
