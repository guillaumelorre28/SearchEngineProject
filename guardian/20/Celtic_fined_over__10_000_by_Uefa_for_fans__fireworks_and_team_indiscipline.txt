Molde, Fenerbahce and Ajax.

Uefa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa> announced the €13,000 
punishment on Tuesday following a meeting of its control, ethics and

individual fans.

defeat by Internazionale in Italy earlier in 2015 and the latest case was the 
eighth time in five seasons that Celtic have been punished by the European 
governing body for supporter misconduct.
