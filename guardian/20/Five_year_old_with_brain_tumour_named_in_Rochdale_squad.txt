Joshua McCormack has been named by manager Keith Hill as one of Dale’s seven 
substitutes for the match at Victoria Park.

The boy is too poorly to attend the game but his shirt will hang in the 
dressing room before the match and will take pride of place on the substitutes’ 
bench. His name will also appear on the teamsheet.

Joshua is currently being cared for in a local hospice and Hill, his backroom 
staff and the players will visit the young Dale fan at the hospice on Thursday. 
They will present Joshua and his family with his matchday shirt and an official 
teamsheet, as well as a shirt which has been signed by all of the players.

Hill commented: “It is a real honour to name Joshua McCormack as a substitute 
for tonight’s game. He has touched the hearts of everyone atRochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> Football Club since we met him 
for the first time back in February.

“No child should have to go through what Joshua is going through and we, as a 
club and a group of players, will continue to do whatever we can to support him 
and his family. We hope this one small gesture can bring some light to his 
family during this difficult time.

Joshua, who is from Rochdale, was diagnosed with a brain tumour last year and 
his family were given the news at the end of September that his illness is now 
terminal.

The youngster, who has been given squad number 55, was mascot for the day in 
August.
