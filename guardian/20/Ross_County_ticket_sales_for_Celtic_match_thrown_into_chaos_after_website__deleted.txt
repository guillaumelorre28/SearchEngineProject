Ross County’s website has been accidentally deleted, throwing into chaos 
ticket sales for the club’sScottish Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership> match against 
Celtic on Sunday.

The Scottish League Cup winners discovered that the club website had 
disappeared on Saturday owing to an error by the web-hosting firm it uses, 
123-reg.

The company, which hosts 1.7m sites in the UK, told the Ross-shire Journal 
<http://www.ross-shirejournal.co.uk/News/Ross-County-left-counting-the-cost-as-club-website-wiped-after-blunder-19042016.htm>
 that an error it made during maintenance had “effectively deleted” the content 
on some of its servers.

Ross County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rosscounty> do not yet know 
when the site can be restored and meanwhile the club’s ticketing operation has 
been badly affected.

David O’Connor, Ross County’s operations manager, said: “The site went offline 
on Saturday. We discovered when users trying to get in alerted us.

“There’s an awful lot of information on that website including tickets, 
information about how to book places on buses and, of course, merchandise.

“It’s not always easy for people to make it in to Dingwall during the working 
day to get tickets so that alone is a real inconvenience.”

Away tickets for the Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> game 
must be purchased in advance.
