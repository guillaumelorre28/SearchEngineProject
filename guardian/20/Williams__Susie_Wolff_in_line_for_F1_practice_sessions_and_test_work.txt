Susie Wolff is to gain further Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> experience during the 
forthcoming season.

Wolff was appointed Williams’ official test driver at the end of November last 
year and now the team have confirmed her duties for 2015. The 32-year-old Scot 
will take part in the first practice sessions for the Spanish and British 
Grands Prix in May and July respectively.

Following an outing on the first day of the second pre-season test in 
Barcelona last month, Wolff will also test for a day of the in-season programme 
scheduled following the Austrian Grand Prix in June.

The on-track experience will be supplemented with an extensive programme of 
work in the team’s simulator to help with the ongoing development of the 
current car, the FW37.

Wolff said: “Our focus this year is to build on the success of 2014. I’ve been 
training hard all winter and I am physically in the best shape I’ve ever been, 
so I am ready for the season ahead.

“As official test driver I will have additional time in the FW37 and by 
correlating this with my work in the simulator, the team can ensure we are 
getting the best from the car and check how updates are performing.

“All of us drivers on the Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/williams>
 roster have been working closely together on this and we are ready to give 
everything we can to the 2015 season.”

Explaining the thinking behind Wolff’s duties, the deputy team principal, 
Claire Williams, said: “Last season Susie impressed with her performances 
during FP1 at Silverstone and Hockenheim and we were keen to give her another 
chance to test in 2015.

“She knew the FW36 well and with the FW37 being a gradual evolution we were 
keen to utilise this knowledge and get her in the car to help assess and 
validate the approaches we have taken.”
