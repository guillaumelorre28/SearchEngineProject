Full time: Real Madrid 2-1 Celta Vigo

Real Madrid win their 14th straight La Liga match courtesy of goals from 
Alvaro Morata and Toni Kroos. Celta Vigo pulled one back through Fabian 
Orellano, but it wasn’t enough.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> take the three points, but 
Celta Vigo can take heart from a decent performance against opposition who, 
admittedly, did just enough to win. Zinedine Zidane is unlikely to be too 
pleased with that rather lacklustre performance.

90+2 min: Good play from Sisto down by the corner flag, deep in Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> territory. He turns this way 
and that before winning a throw-in for his team. It’s taken, but Real hack the 
ball down the field in a decidedly agricultural fashion.

90 min: Lucas Vazquez tries a shot on goal under pressure just inside the 
Celta penalty area. He loses his balance and his scuffed effort goes out for a 
corner. Kroos plays it down the field for Marcelo as Real attempt to play down 
the clock.

GOAL! Real Madrid 2-1 Celta Vigo (Kroos 81)

Toni Kroos restores Real’s lead with a fine goal from outside the penalty 
area. He was galloping through from midfield when Lucas Vazquez teed him up 
with a perfectly weighted ball across the face of the Celta penalty area, then 
curled his low daisy-cutter around the outstretched fingertips of Alvarez and 
in off the upright.

79 min: Looking at a replay of the Real goal, there was definitely a hint of 
offside about it. Alvaro Morato was standing in an offside position in the 
build-up to the goal, but was not in an offside position when he scored it. 
Does that make him offside? In my opinion, yes, because he was affecting play 
in the build-up. It’s open to interpretation, though.

GOAL! Real Madrid 1-1 Celta Vigo (Orellana 67)

Unmarked on the edge of the Real penalty area, Fabian Orellana steps on to a 
pass from John Guidetti, spots Kiko Casilla a mit off his line and fires the 
ball to the goalkeeper’s right. That was a fine strike from the Chilean.

Kamikaze defending from Sergio Alvarez, whose feeble clearance falls kindly 
for Luca Modric, who picks out Marco Asensio in the Celta penalty area. He 
attempts to scoop the ball over the Celta goalkeeper, who blocks his effort. It 
bounces nicely for Alvaro Morata, who lashes home from about 10 yards.

53 min: Jonny is booked for a foul that yields a free-kick on the right side 
of the pitch just outside the Celta penalty area. He joins his fellow full-back 
Hugo Mallo, who was booked a couple of minutes previously for his foul on 
Marata, in the book. Gareth Bale’s free-kick is a good one, tipped on to the

52 min: Real Madrid win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Celta goal for a 
foul on Morata. With no Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch, there’s a chance they 
might score from it, but Gareth Bale sends his effort sailing high and wide.

46 min: Great play from Celta, who ping the ball around the edge of the Real 
penalty area and carve their hosts open. John Guidetti squares the ball for the 
incoming Theo Bongonda, but the midfielder doesn’t have the legs to get on the 
end of the cross. A let-off for Real, who were caught napping.

it, although Real Madrid have made it fairly easy for them to do so.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> have come closest to scoring, 
with Luca Modric rattling the crossbar with one fine effort from the edge of 
the penalty area.

36 min: Celta Vigo are enjoying a decent spell and certainly not letting Real 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> have it all their own

33 min: Real midfielder Casemiro is lucky to avoid a booking after getting 
involved in some handbags with Pablo Hernandez. He shoves the big man in the 
chest and Hernandez keeled over like a tree that had just been felled by 
lumberjacks. It was something and nothing, all because Celta felt aggrieved that
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> didn’t put the 
ball out of play when John Guidetti went to ground with some minor injury.

Bongonda takes the selfish option, electing to shoot from a narrow angle after 
getting up the left flank when he should have crossed for John Guidetti. The 
former Manchester City striker makes no secret of his displeasure at this

20 min: Daniel Wass breaks forward up the left, drills in a cross and John 
Guidetti pounces on a poor clearance from Raphael Varane. He shoots for the 
Real goal and his shot is deflected for a corner. Nothing comes of it. They’re 
doing OK here, keeping their shape well and defending stoutly.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> don’t look duly troubled 
after 20 minutes of a match that is being played at a fairly pedestrian pace so 
far.

15 min: Playing the ball out from the right side of his penalty area, Celta 
Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez 
scuffs a poor clearance straight to Luca Modric about 40 yards from goal. The 
Real midfielder shoots goalwards, but Alvarez is able to scramble back to keep 
the shot out before sheepishly raising an arm in apology to his team-mates.

9 min: Roncaglio slides in to cut off Morata as he attempts to latch on to a 
pass from deep in the channel between the touchline and the left side of the 
Celta penalty area. He doesn’t get the ball and Morata appeals for a free-kick, 
but none is forthcoming.

A Spanish Olympian is introduced to the crowd ...

Wearing the two gold medals she won in the swimming pool at Rio, Mireia 
Belmonte is introduced to the crowd and receives a warm ovation. A minute of 
silence - of sorts, it’s soundtracked by some haunting music - follows for the 
victims of the earthquake in Italy during the week.

whatever the Spanish is for “C’mon boys!” as they march out on to the Bernabeu

Hola sports fans ...

Having lost their opening La Liga match of the season against newly promoted 
Leganés, Celta Vigo face a far sterner test tonight. They travel to the 
Bernabeu to take on Real Madrid, whoswatted Real Sociedad aside with a minimum 
of fuss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/gareth-bale-real-madrid-sociedad-la-liga-match-report>
 last weekend despite missing a key number of personnel including Cristiano 
Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Pepe and Luca Modric.

Having lost Nolito to Manchester City, Celta were very poor in defeat at home 
against Leganés and it they play as badly again could find themselves on the 
wrong end of a hiding here.

Real Madrid win their 14th straight La Liga match courtesy of goals from 
Alvaro Morata and Toni Kroos. Celta Vigo pulled one back through Fabian 
Orellano, but it wasn’t enough.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> take the three points, but 
Celta Vigo can take heart from a decent performance against opposition who, 
admittedly, did just enough to win. Zinedine Zidane is unlikely to be too 
pleased with that rather lacklustre performance.
 
90+3 min: Gareth Bale tries to lob Sergio Alvarez from distance, but his 
audacious effort - the last action of the game - goes over the bar.
 
90+2 min: Good play from Sisto down by the corner flag, deep in Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> territory. He turns this way 
and that before winning a throw-in for his team. It’s taken, but Real hack the 
ball down the field in a decidedly agricultural fashion.
 
90 min: Lucas Vazquez tries a shot on goal under pressure just inside the 
Celta penalty area. He loses his balance and his scuffed effort goes out for a 
corner. Kroos plays it down the field for Marcelo as Real attempt to play down 
the clock.
 
89 min: Raphael Varane sends James darting downfield on the counter-attack 
with a meaty headed clearance from a Mallo cross from the right touchline.
 
87 min: Pablo Hernandez bundles Vazquez to the ground as the Real Madrid 
substitute is franticvally trying to scramble the ball clear from near his own 
goal. It’s a a silly foul that gives theReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> man an easy get-out when he 
looked in a bit of bother and Real were defending desperately.
 
84 min: Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> win a 
corner, which Fabian Orellana swings into the mixer. Kiko Casillas comes a long 
way off his line for the ball and doesn’t get it, but Celta can’t capitalise 
despite Bongonda’s effort to send a looping header goalwards. Celta 
substitution: Sisto on for Radoja.
 
Toni Kroos restores Real’s lead with a fine goal from outside the penalty 
area. He was galloping through from midfield when Lucas Vazquez teed him up 
with a perfectly weighted ball across the face of the Celta penalty area, then 
curled his low daisy-cutter around the outstretched fingertips of Alvarez and 
in off the upright.
 
80 min: Gareth Bale goes close with a header, which is saved unconvincingly by 
Sergio Alvarez.
 
79 min: Looking at a replay of the Real goal, there was definitely a hint of 
offside about it. Alvaro Morato was standing in an offside position in the 
build-up to the goal, but was not in an offside position when he scored it. 
Does that make him offside? In my opinion, yes, because he was affecting play 
in the build-up. It’s open to interpretation, though.
 
76 min: Celta Vigo substitution: Pape Cheikh on for Daniel Wass. Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> substitution: Mariano Diaz on 
for Alvaro Morato.
 
76 min: Raphael Varane picks out Lucas Vazquez in the inside right channel, 
but the right winger’s subsequent cross into the penalty area is woeful.
 
72 min: Celta Vigo substitution: Iago Aspas on for John Guidetti. 
 
70 min: Gareth Bale sends in an inch-perfect cross from the left, towards the 
meaty forehead of Alvaro Morata at the near post. The Spaniard leaps, but 
doesn’t manage to make contact with the ball.
 
69 min: Another Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
substitution: James Rodriguez comes on for Luca Modric, who has run his little 
legs into stumps.
 
Unmarked on the edge of the Real penalty area, Fabian Orellana steps on to a 
pass from John Guidetti, spots Kiko Casilla a mit off his line and fires the 
ball to the goalkeeper’s right. That was a fine strike from the Chilean.
 
65 min: Gareth Bale tries his luck with a flying header. No joy. 
 
64 min: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
substitution: Lucas Vazquez on for Marco Asensio.
 
63 min: Casemiro wins the ball just outside the Celta penalty area and 
attempts to curl the ball inside of the right upright. It sails wide.

Kamikaze defending from Sergio Alvarez, whose feeble clearance falls kindly 
for Luca Modric, who picks out Marco Asensio in the Celta penalty area. He 
attempts to scoop the ball over the Celta goalkeeper, who blocks his effort. It 
bounces nicely for Alvaro Morata, who lashes home from about 10 yards.
 
53 min: Jonny is booked for a foul that yields a free-kick on the right side 
of the pitch just outside the Celta penalty area. He joins his fellow full-back 
Hugo Mallo, who was booked a couple of minutes previously for his foul on 
Marata, in the book. Gareth Bale’s free-kick is a good one, tipped on to the 
bar by Sergio Alvarez.
 
52 min: Real Madrid win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Celta goal for a 
foul on Morata. With no Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch, there’s a chance they 
might score from it, but Gareth Bale sends his effort sailing high and wide.
 
51 min: Marco Asensio brings a save out of Sargio Alvarez in the Celta goal 
with a long range effort.
 
50 min: Now Modric wins a corner for Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>. Toni Kroos takes it quickly, 
playing it to Modric on the right side of the Celta penalty area, but it’s 
cleared.
 
49 min: Bale gets forward forcing Jonny to concede a corner. The ball’s swung 
into the Celta penalty area, but is headed clear by Radoja.
 
48 min: Celta Vigo left-back Jonny shoots high over the Real bar from distance 
after being teed up by Bongonda. Celta are growing in confidence here.
 
46 min: Great play from Celta, who ping the ball around the edge of the Real 
penalty area and carve their hosts open. John Guidetti squares the ball for the 
incoming Theo Bongonda, but the midfielder doesn’t have the legs to get on the 
end of the cross. A let-off for Real, who were caught napping.
 
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> get the ball 
rolling for the second half with the deadlock yet to be broken. The ball’s 
played forward to Marco Asensio, who is dispossessed by Celta Vigo right-back 
Hugo Mallo.
 
Half-time chat: “Pressing your red button will take you to the Canary 
Islands,” says man on Sky Sports, while discussing tomorrow’s televisedLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> action or trying to pack 
as many euphemisms into one short sentence as is humanly possible.
 
It’s all square at the interval. Celta Vigo have come with a plan and stuck to 
it, although Real Madrid have made it fairly easy for them to do so.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> have come closest to scoring, 
with Luca Modric rattling the crossbar with one fine effort from the edge of 
the penalty area.
 
45 min: Toni Kroos gets on the ball and immediately loses it. He’s had a very 
quiet match.
 
43 min: Nemanja Radoja pounces on a half-clearance from Sergio Ramos and 
shoots from well outside theReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> penalty area. the ball 
bounces three times on its way into the clutches of Kiko Casilla.
 
39 min: Gareth Bale picks up the ball in space on the right flank, gets 
forward and pulls the trigger. His long range effort is saved by Sergio 
Alvarez, but looked like it was going wide of the right upright anyway.
 
36 min: Celta Vigo are enjoying a decent spell and certainly not letting Real 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> have it all their own 
way. As first halves of football go, this one is unlikely to live too long in 
the memory, but Celta Vigo manager Eduardo Berizzo won’t mind that if his side 
can make it to the interval without conceding a goal.
 
33 min: Real midfielder Casemiro is lucky to avoid a booking after getting 
involved in some handbags with Pablo Hernandez. He shoves the big man in the 
chest and Hernandez keeled over like a tree that had just been felled by 
lumberjacks. It was something and nothing, all because Celta felt aggrieved that
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> didn’t put the 
ball out of play when John Guidetti went to ground with some minor injury.
 
32 min: From the ensuing corner, Bale leaps to attack the ball and heads it 
narrowly wide.Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are 
getting closer.
 
31 min: Another good effort from Modric, who brings a goods save out of 
Alvarez with a shot from just outside the Celta penalty area after being teed 
up by Gareth Bale.
 
29 min: Chance! Luca Modric takes the ball around Pablo Hernandez in midfield, 
powers forwards towards the edge of the Celta penalty area and unleashes a shot 
that whacks the cross-bar.
 
27 min: Nemanja Radoja plays the ball back to Alvarez from the left touchline 
under pressure from Gareth Bale. I say pressure, but the level of urgency here 
from Real’s players is minimal.
 
26 min: Alvaro Morata gets a telling-off from the referee for trying to hamper 
Sergio Alvarez as the goalkeeper tried to kick the ball out.
 
24 min: For Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo>, Theo 
Bongonda takes the selfish option, electing to shoot from a narrow angle after 
getting up the left flank when he should have crossed for John Guidetti. The 
former Manchester City striker makes no secret of his displeasure at this 
wasted opportunity.
 
20 min: Daniel Wass breaks forward up the left, drills in a cross and John 
Guidetti pounces on a poor clearance from Raphael Varane. He shoots for the 
Real goal and his shot is deflected for a corner. Nothing comes of it. They’re 
doing OK here, keeping their shape well and defending stoutly.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> don’t look duly troubled 
after 20 minutes of a match that is being played at a fairly pedestrian pace so 
far.
 
17 min: Marcelo gallops down the inside left channel before losing the ball on 
the edge of the Celta penalty area. Luca Modric has picked up a knock, but is 
trying to run it off after consulting with the Real bench.

15 min: Playing the ball out from the right side of his penalty area, Celta 
Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez 
scuffs a poor clearance straight to Luca Modric about 40 yards from goal. The 
Real midfielder shoots goalwards, but Alvarez is able to scramble back to keep 
the shot out before sheepishly raising an arm in apology to his team-mates.
 
13 min: Alvaro Morata curls an effort wide of the left upright from the edge 
of the penalty area after good work through the centre by Marco Asensio. The 
striker picked out Bale on the edge of the penalty area, he was tackled and the 
ball broke to Morata, who shot.
 
10 min: Pablo Hernandez wins the ball in midfield and plays out wide to 
Orellana on the right wing. He attempts to switch wing with a crossfield ball 
to John Guidetti but his pass is wayward.
 
9 min: Roncaglio slides in to cut off Morata as he attempts to latch on to a 
pass from deep in the channel between the touchline and the left side of the 
Celta penalty area. He doesn’t get the ball and Morata appeals for a free-kick, 
but none is forthcoming.
 
7 min: Real goalkeeper Kiko Casilla plays the ball out from the back and it’s 
pinged back and forth from flank to flank asReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> patiently probe for an 
opening. Nothing of much interest to report so far.
 
6 min: Fabian Orellana gets in behind Marcelo in the Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> left-back area but is 
penalised for offside. He castigates Daniel Wass for not releasing the ball a 
mite earlier.
 
4 min: Interesting fact: Celta Vigo have conceded 17 goals in their past four 
matches againstReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>.
 
2 min: Gareth Bale plays a lovely ball up the right flank towards Alvaero 
Morata, who takes it around Facunda Ronchaglio and cuts inside. Gustavo Cabral 
clears forCelta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo>.
 
1 min: Play is under way at the Bernabeu. 
 
Wearing the two gold medals she won in the swimming pool at Rio, Mireia 
Belmonte is introduced to the crowd and receives a warm ovation. A minute of 
silence - of sorts, it’s soundtracked by some haunting music - follows for the 
victims of the earthquake in Italy during the week.

kick-off. Photograph: Ruben Albarran/REX/Shutterstock  
Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel with various players shouting 
whatever the Spanish is for “C’mon boys!” as they march out on to the Bernabeu 
sward and line up either side of the of match officials. There’s no hanging 
about as handshakes are exchanged and they prepare for action. Real’s players 
line up in their usual all white home kit, while their opponents wear blue 
shirts, blue shorts and blue socks.

Having lost their opening La Liga match of the season against newly promoted 
Leganés, Celta Vigo face a far sterner test tonight. They travel to the 
Bernabeu to take on Real Madrid, whoswatted Real Sociedad aside with a minimum 
of fuss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/gareth-bale-real-madrid-sociedad-la-liga-match-report>
 last weekend despite missing a key number of personnel including Cristiano 
Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Pepe and Luca Modric.

Having lost Nolito to Manchester City, Celta were very poor in defeat at home 
against Leganés and it they play as badly again could find themselves on the 
wrong end of a hiding here.
