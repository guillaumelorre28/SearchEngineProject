“We want to place on record our sincere thanks to Richard, who has been 
instrumental in the club’s progress over the last three years.

“He led the team to success in the FA Trophy, promotion back to the Football 
League and a memorable run in the FA Cup last season which culminated in two 
games against Manchester United. Richard has achieved a special place in the 
history of Cambridge United and will always be warmly welcomed at the Abbey 
Stadium.

“Assistant manager, Joe Dunne, assisted by the other first team coaching 
staff, will take training this week as the team prepares for our FA Cup tie 
against Basingstoke at the Abbey Stadium on Saturday.”
