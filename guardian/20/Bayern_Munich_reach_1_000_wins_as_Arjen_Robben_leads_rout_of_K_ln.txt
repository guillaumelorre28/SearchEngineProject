Arjen Robben sparkled on his comeback from injury after almost two months, 
scoring Bayern Munich’s first goal in a 4-0 demolition of Köln for the club’s 
1,000th victory in theBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball>, which put the 
champions 10 points clear at the top.

Robben, out since 3 September when he was injured in Holland’s 1-0 loss to 
Iceland in a Euro 2016 qualifier, slotted in from close range after a back heel 
from Robert Lewandowski as they looked to bounce backfrom Tuesday’s Champions 
League defeat at Arsenal

The Chile international Arturo Vidal drilled in from Kingsley Coman’s darting 
run and cutback as the Bavarians extended their record-breaking start to the 
season to 10 wins in 10 games.

Lewandowski, the Bundesliga’s top scorer, then got on to the score sheet 
himself with a glancing header in the 62nd minute, after Douglas Costa whipped 
in a free-kick, the Pole taking his league tally to 13 goals in 10 games.

Thomas Müller added their fourth goal with a well-taken penalty as Bayern 
moved to 30 points, with second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are on 20, in 
action at home to Augsburg on Sunday.
