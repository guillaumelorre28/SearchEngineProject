The recipe

Wipe a couple of large sweet potatoes and put them in the oven to bake. They 
should take between 45-60 minutes at 200C/gas mark 6.

Trim 250g of brussels sprouts, discarding any discoloured leaves and removing 
any dry stalks. Cut each sprout into four. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil and a thin 
slice of butter in a shallow pan, add the sprouts then cook them over a 
moderate heat for about 10-15 minutes until they have softened and are light 
gold in colour. Pour in 200ml double cream, then stir in 1 tbsp each of smooth 
Dijon and whole grain mustard. Finish with a generous grinding of salt and 
pepper.

Let the cream simmer for 3 or 4 minutes until it starts to thicken. When the 
potatoes are done, split them in half and spoon the Brussels and mustard cream 
sauce over them.

The trick

Nothing complicated here, but when you have poured the cream into the hot pan 
then watch carefully as it reduces. Let the cream bubble gently over a moderate 
heat, stir occasionally, regularly checking its consistency. When the sauce is 
thick enough to coat the back of a spoon it is ready.

The twist

A large celeriac, in place of the sweet potato, will bake sweetly enough if 
wrapped in buttered foil and cooked at a low temperature. Any of the brassicas 
will be happy in the cream and mustard sauce. Shredded cavolo nero, black 
cabbage, could be substituted for the spouts, as could dark green savoy and 
chopped long-stemmed broccoli.
