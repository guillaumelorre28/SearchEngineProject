The striker was hoping to resurrect his ailing career at Chelsea this season 
but halfway through his loan with the Premier League champions he has scored 
only one goal. Falcao has not played forChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> since the end of October because 
of the injury and is expected to be out for at least another week.

Having travelled to Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>, the 
Colombian returned to Chelsea’s training ground on Wednesday and was at the 
complex in Cobham on Thursday too. But he is understood to be considering an 
attempt to cut his loan short and return to his parent club.

With Diego Costa and Loïc Rémy ahead of him in the Chelsea pecking order, 
Falcao appears unlikely to get much playing time for the rest of the season, 
which is of concern to the former Atlético Madrid forward. If Chelsea cannot 
offer him regular first-team football for the rest of the campaign, it is 
understood he would prefer to return to Monaco where his contract expires in 
2018.

Monaco signed Falco from Atlético in 2013 for £52m but he spent only one 
season in Ligue 1, suffering a major knee injury midway through, before 
embarking on a disappointing loan spell at Manchester United in which he scored 
four goals in 29 appearances.
