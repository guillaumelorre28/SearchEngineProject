Walsall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/walsall> have apologised to 
Wolves after a "frankly disgusting" message appeared on the club's official 
Twitter account following their 1-0 win at Molineux on Tuesday.

The League One club said their account had been hacked before the message – 
which included a reference to "six fingered, inbred" Wolves fans – was sent. It 
was widely re-tweeted before being deleted.

Walsall said in a statement 
<https://www.facebook.com/officialwalsallfc/posts/566033446767173>: "Our 
official account was hacked at 22:36 last night … As soon as the club's 
communications team, who were at Molineux for the fixture, were made aware of 
the tweet, it was deleted and an apology issued."

Walsall said a full investigation would be carried out, and the "strongest 
action" taken against the culprit.

In response, Wolves said: "We completely accept [Walsall's] explanation and 
this issue should not take shine off their victory last night. As far as we are 
concerned, the matter is done and dusted."

Before being hacked, Walsall's Twitter feed had reacted to the victory 
<https://twitter.com/WFCOfficial/status/380069235721924608> with the message: 
"Robert Plant, Noddy Holder, Suzi Perry, Rachel Heyhoe-Flint, Mark from Sam & 
Mark… Your boys took one 'ell of a beating."
