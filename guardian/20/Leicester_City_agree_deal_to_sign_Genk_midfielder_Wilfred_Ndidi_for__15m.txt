Leicester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> have 
agreed a deal to sign Wilfred Ndidi from Genk in a deal worth £15m plus £3m in 
potential add-ons. The midfielder had the first part of his medical in December 
and is looking to conclude the final part of the tests to join on 1 January.

Leicester have applied for a work permit for the 20-year-old and will be able 
to announce the deal once that has come through. The Premier League champions 
have beaten off interest from several other top European clubs to sign the 
Nigeria international. Their manager, Claudio Ranieri, sees him as the perfect 
replacement for N’Golo Kanté, who joined Chelsea in the summer.

Leicester have struggled without the French international and Ranieri hopes 
Ndidi will adapt to the Premier League quickly as the club aim to move away 
from the relegation zone. Leicester also face Sevilla in the last 16 of the 
Champions League in February.

After Genk’s 2-0 victory over Gent on Tuesday night, Ndidi confirmed he had 
played his last game for the club and paid tribute to coach Peter Maes.

“I really want to thank Peter Maes,” he said. “It is true that this was my 
last game forGenk <https://www.theguardian.com/football/krc-genk>. Whether I am 
now emotional? Quite a bit, yes. Especially because of the situation 
surrounding Maes. He has made me the player I am today. I owe my transfer to 
him.”

Born in Lagos, Ndidi was discovered by Manchester United’s Belgium scout 
Roland Janssen at a youth tournament in 2013. He joined Genk in 2015 and has 
made 62 league appearances for the Belgian club and scored four goals.
