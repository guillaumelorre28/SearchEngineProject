The former Everton, Portsmouth and Middlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> striker Yakubu Aiyegbeni 
played 60 minutes for the National League club Boreham Wood in a pre-season 
friendly against Reading on Saturday.

Yakubu, who also counts Reading among his former clubs, last played 
professionally for the Turkish team Kayserispor. He is thought to live in the 
Boreham Wood area, and featured in the match at Meadow Park, although he was 
unable to get on the scoresheet as the hosts lost 5-0.

Luke Garrard, the Boreham Wood manager, told the Boreham Wood and Elstree Times
 
<http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/sport/14609365.Wood_boss_Garrard_realistic_about_chances_of_signing_Yakubu/?ref=mr&lp=2>
 that he thought the club’s chances of pulling off a permanent deal for the 
striker were slim.

“Realistically I think he has offers and ambitions to play at the highest 
level available,” Garrard said. “I’ll never say never.

“In terms of today it was just nice to get him involved. He is of a certain 
level and he is a model pro.”
