The ubiquitous chopped salad of the Middle East – as Yotam Ottolenghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yotamottolenghi> and Sami Tamimi write in 
their book Jerusalem 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008XX0PKG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1>
, there’s no escaping it: “It’s a local affliction, quite seriously.” Eaten at 
almost every meal, fattoush, with its cool cucumber and crunchy radish, feels 
more like a “proper salad” than the equally famous tabbouleh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jul/17/how-to-make-perfect-tabbouleh>
, according toSabrina Ghayour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sabrina-ghayour>. It also happens to be an 
excellent way of using up stale pitta – if, indeed, you happen tohave any 
knocking around after last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/jul/13/how-to-cook-the-perfect-pitta-bread>
. Infinitely adaptable and wonderfully refreshing, fattoush is a useful little 
number to have in your culinary armoury.

The lettuce dilemma

Most of the recipes I try contain lettuce in varying quantities, either little 
gem, or the larger version, cos – but the recipe in Jerusalem (passed down from 
Tamimi’s mum) omits it, as doesClaudia Roden 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nr2Dna7hx1EC&pg=PA430&lpg=PA430&dq=CLAUDIA+RODEN+FATTOUSH+PURSLANE&source=bl&ots=5v8JfOWDfW&sig=IeGqRNOz7dookCSYGmtMy89fWlI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPkIeMyPrNAhWlAcAKHROzBscQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=CLAUDIA%20RODEN%20FATTOUSH%20PURSLANE&f=false>
. Fattoush is, I believe, rather a moveable feast –Anissa Helou 
<http://www.anissas.com/fattush-a-lebanesesyrian-ramadan-staple/> writes in her 
book Lebanese Cuisine that “you can make it with whatever salad ingredients you 
have available as long as you use sumac” (and, presumably, bread).


In that spirit, I’ll admit I find lettuce adds crunch, but little else – it’s 
hard not to pick through it to get to the good stuff, making it feel as if it’s 
there to add bulk, rather than flavour. But, withGhayour’s Persiana 
<http://quotes-for-the-soul.tumblr.com/post/131071033081/fattoush-salad-from-persiana-recipes-from-the>
, the restaurant chain Comptoir Libanais’ 
<http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/recipes/recipe-fattoush-with-pomegranate-molasses-dressing>
 eponymous book, Jane Baxter and John Vincent’s recently publishedLeon Happy 
Salads 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tarBCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=jane+baxter+fattoush+happy+salads&source=bl&ots=0djFl76PYi&sig=2q4acMQrwzIqjqixEXyreBNM3NU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjpvfV6P3NAhVEJ8AKHa1NAWgQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&q=fattoush&f=false>
 and theHoney & Co cookbook 
<http://www.eater.com/2015/8/1/9067489/tomato-recipe-honey-and-co-yotam-ottolenghi>
 all ranged against me, leaving it out entirely makes me nervous. I seek 
reassurance online, and Helou tells me her mother also made it without, as did 
she for a long time, which is all I need in the way of validation. Anyone who 
objects to a lettuce-free fattoush on principle should take it up with Roden or 
Helou. If you’d simply prefer a bigger salad, however, feel free to add two 
heads of little gem, chopped into wide strips.

The rest

I’m keener on ingredients that add more in the way of texture and flavour, 
with cucumber falling firmly into the first camp (unless you thinly slice it 
and salt it for an hour, as Roden’s recipe inJane Grigson’s Vegetable Book 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jane-Grigsons-Vegetable-Book-Grigson/dp/0140273239> 
suggests, when it tastes pretty good, but feels distinctly limp). Try, as 
Ottolenghi and Tamimi write, “to get small cucumbers for this … they are worlds 
apart from the large ones we normally get in most UK supermarkets” – less 
watery, and with more bite. If you can’t find them, then scoop out the seeds, 
as Baxter suggests.


Radishes are also popular, although less ubiquitous; if you follow Ghayour in 
quartering rather than slicing them, they add a satisfying extra crunch, as 
well as a mild pepperiness (Is it me or have radishes become less peppery in 
the past 20 years?).

They also look very pretty, as do Comptoir Libanais and Honey & Co’s 
pomegranate seeds, which should supply a lovely burst of sweetness – but 
pomegranates at this time of year tend to be disappointingly dry, so I wouldn’t 
bother.


By the time the pomegranates are in season, tomatoes won’t be, and tomatoes 
are( in my opinion, at least) key here. I like the idea of using a variety of 
colours and sizes, chopped “two or three different ways … to give the salad 
some texture”, as Honey & Co recommends, but go with whatever looks best if you 
don’t have a big choice; cherry tomatoes are usually the safest bet, but 
everything should be decent in midsummer. There’s no need to peel them as Roden 
does but, if they seem watery, rather than solid, you might be advised to core 
them, as in Baxter’s recipe.


Ghayour uses red and green peppers, which, of course, work brilliantly with 
the other ingredients, but I think have a tendency to overpower them – if you 
have some, put them in, but they’re by no means essential.

Onions and garlic

All the recipes I try (with the exception of Honey & Co’s) use onion – mostly 
the spring variety, though Roden suggests a mild medium onion as a substitute, 
which, given most onions in this country tend to be eye-wateringly pungent, I 
wouldn’t recommend. Spring onions, finely chopped, offer a grassier, fresher 
kind of heat.


If you’re a fan of strong flavours you might, like Ottolenghi, Tamimi and 
Roden, decide to add garlic to the salad itself – but, for a subtler kick, 
allow it to infuse the dressing. If you’d prefer a milder kick, take it out 
before serving, as Honey & Co does, or crush it right in for a bit more fire.

Extras

Honey & Co adds feta to its salad, which is delicious, and makes it feel more 
like a standalone dish, rather than part of a mezze selection; it’s not 
traditional, but it is very good.

The bread

Fattoush is not fattoush without bread – that’s the whole point. Any kind of 
Middle Eastern flatbread will do (or, in fact, most kinds of flatbread); the 
important thing is it must be crisp. There are various ways to achieve this, 
from Baxter’s frying to Honey & Co’s grilling, but the most reliable, if you 
can bear to turn the oven on, is to bake it, which gives a dryer, crunchier 
result; the dressing should supply all the oil the dish needs. If it’s too hot 
for the oven, toast the pitta as Roden does. Some recipes season it with sumac, 
but as this intensely lemony spice is a key ingredient in the salad itself, the 
bread is, I think, better left plain as a contrast.


Roden moistens the pitta with lemon juice, and Ottolenghi and Tamimi add the 
dressing and salad on top, giving a soggier, morepanzanella 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/aug/15/how-make-perfect-panzanella-recipe>
-like result. My testers overwhelmingly prefer the pieces added at the last 
minute, so they stay crisp for as long as possible.

The herbs

Like tabbouleh, this is a dish that requires a generous hand with the herbs, 
as Helou reminds us. The usual suspects, parsley and mint, are the most popular 
choices, although Honey & Co go for the rather intriguing oregano, which I 
love, but which tastes dangerously uncanonical. Roden’s coriander is similarly 
daring – I think it works, but others aren’t convinced. In any case, parsley 
and mint just taste right; and if it ain’t broke …

Some recipes also use dried mint, too, but its more aniseedy flavour spoils 
the fresh flavour of the other kind as far as most testers are concerned, with 
one likening it to their grandma’s mint sauce in a not entirely complimentary 
way.


Summer purslane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portulaca_oleracea>, a tangy 
succulent with fleshy leaves and something of the lamb’s lettuce about it, is 
commonly found in fattoush in its homelands, and is well worth adding for its 
lovely lemony flavour – if you can track some down at the farmers’ market, 
greengrocer, or Middle Eastern grocer, that is.

Honey & Co also tosses in a couple of teaspoons of za’atar, a Middle Eastern 
spice mix that generally also contains dried oregano as well as thyme, marjoram 
and sesame seeds. Good, but not as refreshingly sour as the sumac I’m going to 
use.

The dressing

At its simplest, fattoush is dressed with olive oil and lemon juice, à la 
Roden, but a little vinegar, whether cider or wine, gives a more interesting 
flavour, while Comptoir Libanais’s pomegranate molasses adds a sweet and sour 
note that I really like; it feels like an optional extra rather than an 
absolute must, but if you find my dressing too tart, add this to taste.

Tamimi’s mother used a homemade yoghurt dressing that the pair believe was 
probably her own creation. “Sami can’t recall anyone else in the neighbourhood 
making it.” It is indeed “terribly comforting”, and both richer and more 
cooling than your average fattoush – it’s a dish for when you want something a 
little more substantial.


You can add spice, too – Baxter suggests allspice and cinnamon, as well as the 
more usual sumac, and I’d also recommend the latter sprinkled over the top of 
the dish itself, as in Ghayour, Ottolenghi and Tamimi’s recipes, for a final 
acid hit. This is a dish that’s all about refreshment – so be bold with the 
flavours. It may not be designed for the British climate but, right now, for 
most of us at least, it’s perfect.

The perfect fattoush

Serves 4
2 stale pitta or other flatbreads
1 garlic clove
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/2 tbsp cider vinegar
3 tbsp good olive oil, plus extra to grease
1 tsp sumac, plus extra to sprinkle
500g ripe mixed tomatoes
3 small cucumbers or 1 large one
2 spring onions
25g flat-leaf parsley
15g mint
100g purslane (optional)
100g radishes

Heat the oven to 200C. Toss the pitta with a little olive oil, then bake for 
about 15 minutes until crisp. Allow to cool slightly, then break into shards.


Meanwhile, crush the garlic clove and put in a jar with the lemon juice, 
vinegar, oil and sumac. Season and shake well then leave to infuse until the 
salad is finished.

Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes into irregular chunks and the cucumber (deseeded 
if the large variety) into rough 1.5cm dice. Finely slice the spring onions and 
pick the leaves of the herbs and roughly chop. Pick the leaves of the purslane 
but leave whole. Combine in a large bowl.

Toss the dressing with the salad, then, just before serving, cut the radishes 
into quarters and use to top the salad, along with the bread and a final 
flourish of sumac.

Is fattoush the king of Middle Eastern salads, or are there fancier rivals to 
its crown? Is crisp lettuce a must? And what other lovely stuff do you make 
with stale bread?
