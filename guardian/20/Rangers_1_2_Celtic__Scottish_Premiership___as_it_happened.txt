Celtic celebrate in front of their supporters. The pouring rain can’t dampen 
the spirits of all those wearing green and white in Ibrox as Celtic’s player 
take the applause of their fans. They were slow out of the gate and went behind 
to a Kenny Miller strike in the first half. But from the half-hour mark they 
were definitely superior and turned things around courtesy of a fine volley 
from Moussa Dembele and a second-half tap-in from Scott Sinclair that was 
practically identical to Miller’s opener. ForRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, it’s a dispiriting defeat, but 
they contributed plenty to a very entertaining game they could have drawn if 
Kenny Miller hadn’t missed a sitter with 10 minutes to go.

90+1 min: We’re in the first of four minutes of added time and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are closing this one out nicely 
... so far. They win another corner and again it’s taken short. They keep it in 
the corner and Dembele uses his strength to help win another set piece for his 
side.

88 min: Celtic win a corner, which Scott Sinclair is no great hurry to take. 
He and Dembele take it short and try to keep the ball in the corner until 
Dembele spots a gap, attempts to hare through it and is brought down by 
Tavernier. Celtic win the free-kick and theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> midfielder is booked.

84 min: Sviatchenko robs Forrester with a fine last-ditch tackle in the Celtic 
penalty area as the substitute tried to wriggle towards goal. Forrester had the 
option to pick out Dodoo with a pass, but decided to be greedy. A corner for
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, but nothing much comes 
of it. The ball’s headed goalwards, but it’s meat and drink to Craig Gordon.

81 min: If Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> lose this, 
I’m guessing Kenny Miller will be having a low key and very unhappy Hogmanay 
this evening. He didn’t catch that shot at all well, scuffing a poor effort off 
the upright when the goal was at his mercy. Soon after, Danny Wilson blocked 
superbly at the other end of the pitch to prevent Stuart Armstrong from 
extending Celtic’s lead.

80 min: CHANCE! Kenny Miller somehow contrives to hit the foot of the upright 
after getting on the end of a wonderful low arcing cross from Andrew Halliday. 
That’s an incredible miss.

76 min: Another fine slide-rule pass from Patrick Roberts, who tees up Stuart 
Armstrong. His low drive from 12 or 13 yards brings a smartish save out of 
Foderingham. Armstrong should have done better - he didn’t quite put his laces 
through that one.

of sorts from Clint Hill. The referee is having none of it and replays suggest 
he was correct.

71 min: Well, I say a tap-in, but it was a tap-in from a fairly tight angle, 
so let’s give Sinclair a little more credit. He converted a low, hard Stuart 
Armstrong cross from the right after the substitute Patrick Roberts had played 
a beautiful through ball down the inside right flank. It was a spookily similar 
goal to that scored byRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
earlier in the game, truth be told.

And here’s Ewan Murray’s match report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report>
.
 
Celtic celebrate in front of their supporters. The pouring rain can’t dampen 
the spirits of all those wearing green and white in Ibrox as Celtic’s player 
take the applause of their fans. They were slow out of the gate and went behind 
to a Kenny Miller strike in the first half. But from the half-hour mark they 
were definitely superior and turned things around courtesy of a fine volley 
from Moussa Dembele and a second-half tap-in from Scott Sinclair that was 
practically identical to Miller’s opener. ForRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, it’s a dispiriting defeat, but 
they contributed plenty to a very entertaining game they could have drawn if 
Kenny Miller hadn’t missed a sitter with 10 minutes to go.
 
Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
make it 15 Premiership wins in a row, coming from behind to beat their city 
neighbours. They go 19 points clear at the top of the table.
 
90+4 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> win a corner, 
which Tavernier sends into the miser. The ball skims out of play off the 
shoulders of Kenny Miller.
 
90+3 min: Celtic win themselves another corner, further frustrating Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> as they run the clock down. The 
home side finally manage to dig the ball out of the corner and get it up the 
field, where Andrew Halliday shoots from long range. Gordon saves comfortably.
 
90+2 min: Callum Wilson is booked for a foul on Dembele and Celtic win a 
free-kick just outside theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>
 penalty area, on the right hand side.
 
90+1 min: We’re in the first of four minutes of added time and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are closing this one out nicely 
... so far. They win another corner and again it’s taken short. They keep it in 
the corner and Dembele uses his strength to help win another set piece for his 
side.
 
88 min: Celtic win a corner, which Scott Sinclair is no great hurry to take. 
He and Dembele take it short and try to keep the ball in the corner until 
Dembele spots a gap, attempts to hare through it and is brought down by 
Tavernier. Celtic win the free-kick and theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> midfielder is booked.
 
85 min: Celtic substitution: Nir Bitton comes on for Callum McGregor. Bitton 
immediately tries his luck with a shot from distance that takes a deflection. 
Foderingham to the rescue forRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> once again.
 
85 min: Moments before that Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> chance, Foderingham had once 
again kept his side in the game with a good save from Scott Sinclair.
 
84 min: Sviatchenko robs Forrester with a fine last-ditch tackle in the Celtic 
penalty area as the substitute tried to wriggle towards goal. Forrester had the 
option to pick out Dodoo with a pass, but decided to be greedy. A corner for
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, but nothing much comes 
of it. The ball’s headed goalwards, but it’s meat and drink to Craig Gordon.
 
82 min: Rangers substitution: Harry Forrester replaces Jason Holt. 
 
81 min: If Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> lose this, 
I’m guessing Kenny Miller will be having a low key and very unhappy Hogmanay 
this evening. He didn’t catch that shot at all well, scuffing a poor effort off 
the upright when the goal was at his mercy. Soon after, Danny Wilson blocked 
superbly at the other end of the pitch to prevent Stuart Armstrong from 
extending Celtic’s lead.
 
80 min: CHANCE! Kenny Miller somehow contrives to hit the foot of the upright 
after getting on the end of a wonderful low arcing cross from Andrew Halliday. 
That’s an incredible miss.
 
79 min: Celtic win a corner, with Roberts putting the ball out of play off 
Barrie McKay. The Celtic fans behind theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> goal are in fine voice. Stuart 
Armstrong sends the ball into the penalty area, where Danny Wilson heads clear.
 
78 min: There’s a mini-drinks break on the touchline as Andrew Halliday 
receives attention for a knock. Play resumes with aRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> throw-in.
 
76 min: Another fine slide-rule pass from Patrick Roberts, who tees up Stuart 
Armstrong. His low drive from 12 or 13 yards brings a smartish save out of 
Foderingham. Armstrong should have done better - he didn’t quite put his laces 
through that one.
 
75 min: Dembele appeals for a penalty after going to ground under a challenge 
of sorts from Clint Hill. The referee is having none of it and replays suggest 
he was correct.
 
73 min: Celtic’s supporters turn their back on the action to engage in a mass 
“Poznan”, jumping up and down with their arms around each other’s shoulders.
 
71 min: Well, I say a tap-in, but it was a tap-in from a fairly tight angle, 
so let’s give Sinclair a little more credit. He converted a low, hard Stuart 
Armstrong cross from the right after the substitute Patrick Roberts had played 
a beautiful through ball down the inside right flank. It was a spookily similar 
goal to that scored byRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
earlier in the game, truth be told.
 
70 min: Scott Sinclair puts Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> ahead with a tap-in at the 
far-post.

69 min: The ball’s floated into the penalty area, where Danny Wilson gets a 
free diving header. His meaty downwards effort is straight at Craig Gordon, who 
saves with his knee.
 
68 min: Scott Brown puts the ball out for a Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> corner.
 
67 min: Lustig attempts to pick out Scott Sinclair with a crossfield ball that 
sails out of play for a throw-in.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> substitution: Patrick Roberts on 
for James Forrest.
 
66 min: Mikael Lustig is booked for hanging out of Barrie McKay’s shirt and 
he’s bang to rights. TheRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
winger has been a serious handful this afternoon.
 
65 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> substitution: 
Josh Windass off, Joe Dodoo on.
 
65 min: Kenny Miller shoots low and hard from distance, but Craig Gordon saves 
comfortably.
 
64 min: Sinclair and Dembele combine to force another good save from 
Foderingham.Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> are 
seriously under the cosh in this second half.
 
63 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> embark on a 
counter-attack and the ball’s played forward to Waghorn. He can’t quite shake 
off Simunovic and Scott Brown gets back to help the defender clear his lines. 
It was poor from Waghorn, who went for glory when he should have squared to the

scramble asRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> desperately
