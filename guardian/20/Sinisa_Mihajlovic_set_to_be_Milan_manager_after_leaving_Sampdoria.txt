Sinisa Mihajlovic is reportedly close to becoming the manager of Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> who sacked Filippo Inzaghi on 
Thursday.

Gazzetta dello Sport said the Serb met the Milan president, Silvio Berlusconi, 
late on Wednesday and that an announcement could come by the end of the week.

Mihajlovic stepped down at Sampdoria on Monday after guiding the Genoa club to 
seventh. The 46-year-old took charge at Sampdoria in November 2013. He has 
managed Bologna, Catania, Fiorentina and Serbia and played at full-back for
Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, Lazio and 
Internazionale.

Milan said that they informed Inzaghi of the movewith “great displeasure”. In 
his first season in charge, Inzaghi led Milan to a dismal 10th-place finish.

The former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti, who was recently sacked by Real 
Madrid

, has rejected offers to return to the Rossoneri.

Struggling financially and with Berlusconi no longer buying the world’s top 
players, Milan have struggled for several seasons. Since winningSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> in 2011, they have 
finished second, third, eighth, and now 10th, failing to qualify for Europe for 
a second consecutive season.
