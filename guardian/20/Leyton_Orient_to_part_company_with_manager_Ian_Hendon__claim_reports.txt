A report in the Waltham Forest Guardian said Hendon was called into a meeting 
after the Exeter defeat and informed his tenure was at an end. No formal 
announcement has yet been made by Orient but a statement is expected this week.

News of Hendon’s dismissal came a day after the club’s owner and president, 
Francesco Becchetti, was handed a six-match stadium ban and fined £40,000 by 
the Football Association after being found guilty of violent conduct following 
an incident at the end of last month’s3-2 win over Portsmouth

. The ban has been stayed pending an appeal.
