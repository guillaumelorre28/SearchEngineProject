Beetroot is a divisive vegetable, I know. Those who don’t like it say it 
tastes like earth, but to my mind it’s easily as sweet as it is earthy. The 
difference between today’s three recipes is proof of beetroot’s enormous 
versatility: if it’s those sweet characteristics you want to focus on, use 
smaller bulbs (the older and larger the beetroot, the less sweet) and draw out 
that sweetness through roasting. If, on the other hand, you’re happy with the 
earthiness, use the bulb raw and thinly sliced, and mix everything together 
just before serving: that way, the vivid colour won’t bleed and end up staining 
everything.

If it’s been a while since you last ate beetroot, give it another go: you may 
well be tickled pink.

Beetroot and horseradish salad with apple, dill and almonds

I love the amount of horseradish in this – it gives the salad a real kick – 
but use less if you prefer. The salad works by itself or with smoked or oily 
fish or seared beef. Serves four.

75g peeled fresh horseradish
4 medium beetroot, peeled and halved
15g dill leaves, roughly chopped
1 granny smith apple, quartered, cored and cut into 3- to 4mm-thick slices
70g flaked almonds, toasted
1 tbsp poppy seeds
Salt and black pepper

For the dressing
200ml apple juice
1½ tbsp cider vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil

For the dressing, put the apple juice in a small saucepan on a high heat and 
leave to bubble for seven or eight minutes, until you are left with about two 
tablespoons of syrup. Pour into a small bowl and leave to cool, then whisk in 
the vinegar, oil, two-thirds of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black 
pepper.

Cut the peeled horseradish into fine julienne strips, either by hand, with a 
mandoline or in a food processor, and put in a large bowl. Cut the beetroot 
into similar strips and add to the bowl with the dill, apple, half the almonds, 
half the poppy seeds and all of the dressing. Mix well (I use my hands), season 
to taste, then transfer to a platter or bowl, or to individual plates. Sprinkle 
on the remaining almonds and poppy seeds, and serve.

Black quinoa, fried kale and beetroot with smoked garlic

Use black quinoa, if you can: it looks very dramatic in this richly dark 
salad. (If you use white quinoa, reduce the cooking time by about three 
minutes.) Serves six.

4 medium beetroot, trimmed but unpeeled
200g rice (any type will do)
2 large heads garlic, cloves separated and peeled, but skins retained for the 
smoking
15g whole thyme sprigs, plus 1 tsp picked thyme leaves
75g black quinoa
300g curly purple and green kale (or just green), tough stems removed, leaves 
torn into 5cm pieces
75ml olive oil, plus 2 tsp extra to serve
Salt and black pepper
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
60g soft goat’s cheese, broken into 2cm pieces

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the beetroot in a small, high-sided 
baking tray, pour in enough boiling water to come 1cm up the sides of the pan 
(150ml or so), cover tightly with tin foil and bake for 45 minutes, until the 
beetroot is soft. Remove from the oven and, once cool enough to handle, peel 
and discard the skins. Cut the peeled beetroot into 1cm-wide wedges.

While the beets are roasting, line a large saute pan for which you have a lid 
with two large sheets of foil, leaving plenty of overhang. Scatter in the rice 
and reserved garlic skins, then lay the thyme on top – you’re essentially 
making the garlic a nest. Put the peeled garlic cloves on top of the thyme and 
flick the rice all over with two teaspoons of water. Cover the pan, then bring 
up the overhanging foil around the edges of the lid, to seal the pan.

Ventilate the kitchen, then put the pan on a high heat. After a few minutes, 
you should see a little smoke trying to escape: leave to smoke for 10 minutes 
from this point, then take off the heat and leave to sit, still covered, for 
five minutes. Remove the lid: the garlic should be soft and light golden-brown. 
Remove the cloves, cutting the large ones in half, and discard the rice, garlic 
skins and thyme.

Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, and cook the quinoa for 12-13 
minutes, until cooked but still retaining a bite. Drain, rinse and set aside.

Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and blanch the kale for just a 
minute, then drain and squeeze out as much water as possible (I find putting it 
in a clean tea towel is the easiest way to do this).

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick saute pan on a high flame. Add 
half the kale, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and some pepper, and stir-fry for 
five minutes, until the leaves are cooked and crisp. Transfer to a large bowl 
and repeat with the remaining kale, two tablespoons of oil and more seasoning.

Put the final tablespoon of oil into the pan and return to a medium heat. Add 
the smoked garlic, the thyme leaves and a pinch of salt, and stir-fry for two 
minutes, then pour in the balsamic vinegar. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds, 
then tip everything into the kale bowl.

Add the quinoa and beetroot wedges to the bowl, mix well and transfer to a 
large platter or six small plates. Dot with the goat’s cheese, drizzle with oil 
and serve.

This makes quite a statement on the visual front but hold your nerve: it’s one 
to feel confident about. It’s lovely with sticky rice and a fresh, crunchy 
salad – a thinly sliced fennel bulb mixed with freshly chopped tarragon, 
coriander and mint with a fresh citrus dressing, works well. Serves six.

2kg pork belly, ribs attached and skin on, cut into 4 equal pieces
1 litre chicken stock
9cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced 3mm thick
1 tsp chilli flakes
1 large onion, peeled and quartered
10 whole star anise
1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder, plus 1 tsp extra to finish
45g dark brown sugar
Shaved peel of 1 large orange, plus all its juice (approximately 100ml)
3 tbsp red-wine vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
150ml red wine
2 medium beetroot, peeled, trimmed and chopped into roughly 1cm pieces
Salt

Put the pork in a very large saucepan for which you have a lid. Add all the 
remaining ingredients apart from the beetroot, along with a litre of water and 
a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to 
medium-low, put a lid on the pan so it’s partially covered, and leave to cook 
for an hour and a half, until the pork is tender.

Transfer the pork to a plate. Strain the liquid into a large bowl. Once the 
pork is cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the skin, and slice each 
piece of meat into three smaller pieces about 8cm long.

Return the stock to a high heat, add the beetroot and boil for 20 minutes, 
until the beetroot is soft. Use a stick blender to blitz the stock and beetroot 
until smooth (or whiz it in a food processor). Pass through a fine-mesh sieve 
or through muslin into a bowl, squeezing out as much of the liquid as possible: 
you should have about a litre.

Heat the grill to its highest setting. Return the strained beetroot liquor to 
the pan and reduce on a high heat for 30-45 minutes, until thickened and you’re 
left with about 250ml. Drop in the pork slices and continue to reduce for two 
minutes, turning the meat halfway, so it’s well coated and hot. Cover a wire 
rack with foil and sit it in a baking tray, then lift out the pork and place on 
the rack. Brush the meat all over with the glaze (about eight tablespoons in 
total) then grill for six minutes, turning it halfway, until crisp on both 
sides. Remove from the grill and keep warm.

To serve, place two pieces of pork on each plate, spoon a little sauce on top 
and sprinkle with five-spice.
