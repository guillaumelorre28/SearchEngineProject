Woman in her 20s meets man in his 40s at an airport. They reconnect in Berlin 
in the post-flight taxi queue, spend time in an expensive hotel and start a 
relationship. With its cute dialogue, this early play from Fiona Doyle – author 
of the award-winingCoolatully 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/31/coolatully-review-rural-ireland> 
– starts out a little like a romcom but becomes as fractured as a smashed 
bottle as it charts the breakdown of a relationship that turns increasingly 
violent.

It might be read as a fable about the baggage brought into every relationship 
and the way the damage of the past affects the present. It could be perceived 
as a particularly twisted revenge drama. Or it might simply be a reminder that 
something that appears beautiful can turn out to be poisonous, even fatal.


 The trouble is that telling a story in non-chronological order, so that the 
audience must piece together the narrative and every scene becomes like a clue 
at a crime scene, doesn’t necessarily make the story any more compelling than 
if it had been told in more traditional fashion.

 The terse, often enigmatic exchanges in Abigail are baffling as often as they 
are illuminating, and Doyle neglects to flesh out her characters (played by Tia 
Bannon and Mark Rose). The Man is particularly sketchily drawn, and you wonder 
why he doesn’t just cut and run much earlier. Joshua McTaggart’s production, 
the final play in the Bunker’s inaugural season, never makes us warm to either 
of them.
