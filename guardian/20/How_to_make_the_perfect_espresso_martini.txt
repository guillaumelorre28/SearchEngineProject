One of the few ersatz martinis to be worthy of the name, the espresso variety 
is perfection in a glass; simple, stimulating and utterly delicious, it’s as 
good after dinner as it is as a short, sharp pick-me-up before heading out for 
the evening. Perfect if you want to make it to midnight on New Year’s Eve.

As the name suggests, an espresso martini is designed to be made with espresso 
coffee, though I have high hopes for the recipe from a blog calledI Need Coffee 
<https://ineedcoffee.com/>, which proclaims “instant coffee a great choice if 
you are in a hurry, or want to save some time”. But even “espresso powder” 
can’t compare to the real thing – like the cold-brew coffee suggested by New 
York bartender Meaghan Dorman, it just tastes insipid in comparison. If you 
don’t have a machine or a coffee bar within non-spill distance then I’d 
recommend using a stovetop Moka pot, or loading up your cafetiere within an 
inch of its life instead.

The recipe in Difford’s Guide’s 365 Days of Cocktails 
<https://www.octopusbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781784720629> specifies 
the espresso must be “freshly made and hot” while Nigella Lawson cautions 
readers of her Christmas book that it should be prepared the night before “so 
it’s properly cold, chilled if possible, before you start”. I always think 
coffee tastes better fresh – and in any case, when shaken with enough ice, 
there’s no need to chill it first, though as Samuel and Samantha Clark advise 
in their bookMorito 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/03/morito-sam-clark-tapas-mezze-cookbook-review>
, “it’s important that you add the coffee last when mixing the drink because if 
you add it first, it will melt the ice and dilute the drink”.

The liqueur

Many recipes use a coffee liqueur as a sweetener, though this isn’t mandatory; 
Chris Arnold, the author of the recipe on the I Need Coffee blog, eschews it 
altogether on the basis that he “prefers to let the real coffee provide that 
flavour element”, but without it the drink is a tad austere.

Kahlua is the most popular choice here, but testers prefer the less sweet 
flavour of Tia Maria, though feel free to substitute your favourite coffee 
liqueur.

The sugar

Diffords are the only ones to add extra sweetener in the form of sugar syrup 
to the shaker. It does make for a richer, more well-rounded drink than the very 
serious version in Dale DeGroff’s The Craft of the Cocktail book, but I think 
I’d prefer to adjust the flavour with liqueur rather than complicating things 
with yet another ingredient.

 Nigella Lawson style ... Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian 
The Clarks add Pedro Ximénez sherry to their espresso martini to give it a 
sweet, raisiny quality testers prefer to Dorman’s rather sickly vanilla liqueur 
or Darren West’s Baileys and sambuca, though it’s definitely gilding the lily 
in a classic version. The same goes for Dorman’s double cream, unless you’re 
serving this as pudding – if you’d like it to be a little richer, may I suggest 
a slug of Lawson’s toffee vodka.




The method

Lawson, who makes up a large jug for a brunch party, and Arnold, who prefers 
stirring “mainly because it involves less work” both eschew the shaker, but if 
you want a decently chilled drink, and that all important crema on the top, 
then you’ll need to smash your cocktail with plenty of ice for at least 20 
seconds.

The garnish

Coffee beans are the most -popular choice, though Arnold prefers lemon peel 
and Dorman cocoa -powder, -neither of which provides the -necessary extra 
caffeine hit. If you’re going to do this, do it properly.
