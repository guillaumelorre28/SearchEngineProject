This is a new cocktail to mark the Cinnamon Club <http://cinnamonclub.com>’s 
15th anniversary this month. It’s just the thing for a chilly evening. Serves 
one.

50ml gin (we use Tanqueray)
20ml Grand Marnier
½ tsp spiced sugar (mix ground cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and star anise into 
brown sugar)
100ml hot water

Fill a punch glass with boiling water, leave for a minute, then tip out. Put 
the gin, Grand Marnier and sugar in the hot glass, stir to dissolve the sugar, 
then add the hot water, stir again and serve; if you like, garnish with 
a cinnamon stick.
