Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are interested 
in the Espanyol goalkeeper Kiko Casilla, according to the Catalan club’s 
president Joan Collet.

Real are in the market for a keeper after their long-term captain Iker 
Casillas moved to Porto, leaving their new new coach Rafa Benítez with the 
Costa Rica international Keylor Navas and the inexperienced Fernando Pacheco.

The record 10-times European champions have also been linked with Manchester 
United’s keeper David de Gea.

“I told Real Madrid that Kiko is worth more than €4m [£2.8m],” Collet said. 
“We are at €4m and for the time being we cannot accept it,” he added.

Casilla, 28, came through Real’s youth academy before moving to Barcelona-based
Espanyol <https://www.theguardian.com/football/espanyol> in 2007.

He has made one appearance for Spain, in November last year when he came on as 
a second-half substitute in a 1-0 defeat by the world champions Germany

, but was not included in the coach Vicente del Bosque’s latest squad.
