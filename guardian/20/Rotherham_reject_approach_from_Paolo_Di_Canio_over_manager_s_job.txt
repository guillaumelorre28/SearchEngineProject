Rotherham have rejected an approach from Paolo Di Canio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/paolo-di-canio> over their vacant 
managerial position, according to the Press Association.

The Italian has been out of work since being sacked by Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/22/paolo-di-canio-sunderland-sacked>
 in September 2013 and his representatives sounded out the Championship club 
over the possibility of becoming Steve Evans’ successor.

However, the Millers have indicated they have no interest in the 47-year-old, 
who has a promotion on his CV during his time at Swindon.

Di Canio left Sunderland after 13 games at the Stadium of Light where, after 
initially keeping them in the Premier League, things turned sour in the 2012-13 
season with reports of a player revolt. He left after taking just one point 
from the opening five games of the season.

Rotherham are on the look-out for a new manager after Evans surprisingly left 
his post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/28/rotherham-united-part-company-manager-steve-evans>
 on Monday after three and a half years at the club.

The Scot led Rotherham from League Two to Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> safety and left after 
overseeing back-to-back wins over Cardiff and Birmingham.

His exit was put down to the two parties wanting to go in “different 
directions”, though there were reports of a falling-out with the board.

The former Leeds head coach Neil Redfearn has expressed his interest in the 
role while the former Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray is also believed 
to be a frontrunner for the role.

Rotherham’s first-team coach Eric Black has been placed in caretaker charge of 
the side and is preparing for Friday’s televised visit of Burnley.
