The draw left Inter second on 18 points, the same as Fiorentina who have a 
game in hand.Palermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> are 11th on 
11 points.

The visitors struck after 60 minutes when a magnificent chip from Stevan 
Jovetic found Jonathan Biabiany advancing into the box. The substitute brought 
the ball down before crossing to Perisic who finished calmly at the far post.

Gilardino equalised six minutes later after reacting quickest in a goalmouth 
melee to tap the ball past Samir Handanovic from close range.

Mancini made four changes following the 0-0 draw with Juventus last weekend 
and his side lacked cohesion early on.

Handanovic made two saves from Franco Vázquez while the Palermo forward also 
sent a header just over the bar after outmuscling Joao Miranda.

Inter’s Jeison Murillo was shown a second yellow card in the 79th minute for 
bringing down Vázquez with a poorly-timed challenge.
