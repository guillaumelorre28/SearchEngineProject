Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> has said the 
odds are firmly stacked against him as he bids to make the impossible dream 
come true and win the Formula One championship on Sunday.

Hamilton, the winner of the last three races, including a spectacular display 
at therain-hit Brazilian Grand Prix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/13/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-brazilian-grand-prix-nico-rosberg-rain>
, will head to Abu Dhabi for the so-called Duel in the Desert 12 points adrift 
of Nico Rosberg.

The 31-year-old Briton knows that even if he wins, his Mercedes team-mate 
needs only a top-three finish to clinch his maiden championship and stop 
Hamilton from becoming the first British driver in grand prix history to win 
four titles.

Hamilton has been in scintillating form, crushing Rosberg in the United States 
and Mexico before delivering a wet-weather masterclass at Interlagos, but is 
well aware the German holds the aces.

“It’s not been a perfect season and I’m faced with pretty impossible odds no 
matter what I do this weekend,” said Hamilton, who will end the year with more 
victories and pole positions than Rosberg should he triumph in Abu Dhabi.

“I can’t and won’t give up. You never know what might happen – however 
unlikely it may seem. I’ll be proud of myself and what I’ve achieved as long as 
I feel I’ve given my all and performed at my best.

“Whatever happens, I’m proud of everyone who’s been a part of the success 
we’ve shared over the past few years. I’m approaching this race the same as I 
do every race. I want to win and I’ll give it everything to finish the season 
on a high.”

Rosberg, whose father Keke won the Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> title 34 years ago, is poised to 
become only the second son of a champion after Damon Hill to win motor racing’s 
biggest prize.

The German, who won in Abu Dhabi last year, has raised his game this season, 
but following a run of three second-place finishes, is keen to clinch the title 
with a victory.

“I will give it everything to end the season with a win,” Rosberg said. “I’ve 
had a great week, relaxing and catching up with my family and friends, so I 
feel like I’m in a good place.

“In Brazil, after the race, I was joking that I would still be taking things 
one race at a time but the more I think about it, the more that’s actually not 
as crazy as it sounds. I have to treat this like any other race.

“Nothing in this sport is easy, so this won’t be any different and I still 
have to go all out for a good result. I have great memories from winning at 
this track last year and it’s somewhere I’ve usually been strong in the past, 
so I have every reason to feel confident.”
