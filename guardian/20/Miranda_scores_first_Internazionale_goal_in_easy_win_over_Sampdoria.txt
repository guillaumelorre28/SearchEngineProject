Mauro Icardi scored against his former club as Internazionale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale> moved up to fourth in 
Serie A with a 3-1 victory over Sampdoria at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.

The victory, watched by former coach José Mourinho, meant Internazionale 
leapfrogged Roma, who host Palermo on Sunday, to move within a point of 
third-placed Fiorentina who visit Atalanta.

Inter are 10 points adrift of leaders Juventus, who drew 0-0 at Bologna on 
Friday, and eight points behind second-placed Napoli who entertain Milan on 
Monday.

Danilo D’Ambrosio slotted home his first goal since October 2014 which opened 
the scoring for the hosts midway through the first half.

Miranda then claimed his first goal for Inter on 57 minutes by heading from 
close range after Felipe Melo rose highest to meet a left-wing delivery.

Former Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> forward 
Icardi added a third 17 minutes from time with a cool left-footed finish before 
Fabio Quagliarella scored his sixth goal of the season in the closing stages 
for the away side.
