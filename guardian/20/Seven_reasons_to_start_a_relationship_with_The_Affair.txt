After a tantalising seven-month wait since its US transmission, acclaimed and 
angsty relationship dramaThe Affair <http://www.sky.com/tv/show/the-affair> 
finally arrives on Sky Atlantic this week, launching with a double bill 
(Wednesday at 9pm). Here are seven reasons to tune in…

1. It’s big on British talent
Craggy Yorkshireman Dominic West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west> (AKA McNulty from The Wire) 
and Lamda alumnus Ruth Wilson (mad Alice fromLuther) star in the compelling 
10-part series, which is taglined: “Danger lies in losing control”. ThinkGone 
Girlmeets True Detective.

2. It’s gobbled up awards
It was a double winner at this year’s Golden Globes, crowned best drama series 
above the likes ofDownton Abbey and Game of Thrones, while Wilson scooped the 
best actress gong, beating such heavyweights as Claire Danes, Viola Davis, 
Julianna Margulies and Robin Wright.

3. It’s got a good pedigree
The Affair is the brainchild of Sarah Treem and Hagai Levi, who co-created 
lauded HBO psychiatry dramaIn Treatment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/11/in-treatment-true-blood-flett>
. Treem is also an Emmy-nominated writer on Netflix hitHouse of Cards. In front 
of the camera, leading pair West and Wilson are strongly supported by Joshua 
Jackson (Pacey fromDawson’s Creek) and Maura Tierney (Dr Abby Lockhart from ER).

 The Affair - Season 1 trailer. 
4. It’s highly addictive
The titular fling starts when Brooklyn schoolteacher-cum-novelist Noah (West), 
wife Helen (Tierney) and their four kids escape the city for a beach break in 
Montauk, Long Island. A chance encounter with enigmatic waitress Alison 
(Wilson) at local diner the Lobster Roll sets in motion an extramarital affair, 
with its emotional and psychological effects fascinatingly explored.

5. It’s a tale of two narrators
The story is told from both Noah’s and Alison’s perspectives – not always 
reliably, as their memories of the same events often differ wildly. 
Misdirection and mystery result. But who to believe? Stakes are further raised 
when a cop starts sniffing around, while we learn that Alison is coping with 
the aftermath of a personal tragedy.

6. The soundtrack and setting are stylish
An atmospheric, largely a capella track, Container by alt-rocker Fiona Apple, 
plays over the hauntingopening credits 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6muh9kTlr88>. The soundtrack also includes 
Johnny Cash, Devendra Banhart, Dolly Parton, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Yo La Tengo 
and Elbow. You’ll end up coveting the Hamptons houses, surfer-esque lifestyle 
and outdoor showers, too.

7. It’ll be back
It’s provocative, unpredictable, passionate – and US network Showtime has 
already renewed it for a second series.
