In a Playfair word square the codeword (in which no letter recurs) is followed 
by the remaining letters of the alphabet, I doing double duty for I and J (see 
right). To encode a word it must first be split into pairs of letters e.g. CR 
IT IC AL. Each pair is then seen as forming the diagonally opposite corners of 
a rectangle within the word square, the other two corner letters being the 
encoded form. Thus, in the example shown, CR gives SG (not GS, which RC would 
give). Where a pair of letters appears in the same row or column in the word 
square, its encoded form is produced from the letters immediately to the right 
of or below each respectively. For the last letters in a row or column the 
first letters in the same row or column become the encoded forms. Thus IC is 
encoded as CE. When all the pairs are encoded, the word is joined up again, 
thus CRITICAL is encoded as SGCICEOP. Answers to the four clues in italics,
which are linked semantically to the codeword, must be encoded thus in the 
diagram. The codeword must then be deduced with the help of the answers to 
normal clues, so that the diagram may be completed.

Competitors should submit a normal cryptic clue to the codeword with their 
solutions.
