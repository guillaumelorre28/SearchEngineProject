1 Dreamgirls

It’s been a long time getting here. Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen’s musical about 
a 60s girl band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/01/dreamgirls-savoy-observer-review>
, clearly inspired bythe Supremes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/08/diana-ross-the-supremes-10-of-the-best>
, was first seen on Broadway in 1981. It’s not subtle, but it has a gaudy 
gaiety and is full of panache as it follows the fortunes of the group, 
including their rise, fall and rise again. The cast give it their all with 
powerhouse vocals, andAmber Riley <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxZevYx6vcw> 
(of Glee fame) is electrifying as Effie, the singer ousted from the band, and 
the manager’s bed, who is not going to take it lying down.
Savoy Theatre, WC2, to Saturday 21 Oct

2 Smashed

The opening show in this year’s 40th London international mime festival is a 
return visit from the miraculous Gandini Juggling, with a special edition of 
their cult show Smashed. It’s a Pina Bausch-inspired piece featuring a large 
amount of crockery, some apples and 17 male and female jugglers: if you don’t 
think that juggling is art, this is the show to change your mind.
Peacock Theatre, WC2, Monday 9 Jan and Tuesday 10 Jan

3 Wish List

Later this year, the Royal Court is reviving Road, Jim Cartwright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/04/jim-cartwright-ancient-secret-of-youth-and-the-five-tibetans-little-voice>
’s 1986 theatrical cry of despair about young people with no hope for the 
future except in low-paid, unfulfilling jobs. Here’s its 2017 equivalent: 
Katherine Soper’s debut play looking at the lives of Dean and Tamsin, a brother 
and sister struggling to survive in a world of zero-hours contracts and 
benefits bureaucracy. She’s 19, he’s 17 and housebound by his OCD, which 
follows them as they reach breaking point. Devastating.
Jerwood Theatres at the Royal Court, SW1, Tuesday 10 Jan to Saturday 11 Feb

4 The Snow Queen

There are two great Snow Queens on offer this January. Vivienne Franzmann’s 
version (Bristol Old Vic, to Monday 16 Jan 
<http://www.bristololdvic.org.uk/snowqueen.html>) is dark, with an icy witch 
who gorges on children’s tantrums. Things are a little warmer at the New Vic, 
where Theresa Heskins draws on the fashionableDanish idea of hygge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/18/hygge-a-soothing-balm-for-the-traumas-of-2016>
 to tell a story of friendship, self-sacrifice and adventure. If you’re in need 
of a pick-me-up, this exquisitely atmospheric staging is a real winter-warmer.
New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, to Saturday 28 Jan

5 The Little Match Girl And Other Happier Tales

Emma Rice departs the Globe in 2018 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/25/emma-rice-step-down-artistic-director-shakespeares-globe>
, and this retelling of four tales byHans Christian Andersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hans-christian-andersen> is evidence of what 
a terrific director she is. There are cheeky references to Rice’s dispute with 
the venue over lighting, but they never get in the way of an evening stuffed 
with theatrical invention and wonder. Utterly enchanting.
Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to Sunday 22 Jan
