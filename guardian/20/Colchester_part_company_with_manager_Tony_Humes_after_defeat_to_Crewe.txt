With one win in their past nine league matches, Colchester are 19th in the 
table – with the 3-2 defeat to Crewe proving the final straw.

A club statement 
<http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/colchester-united-2820672.aspx> read: 
“Following Tuesday night’s game against Crewe Alexandra, Tony and chairman 
Robbie Cowling met and the decision was taken that Humes and the club would go 
their separate ways.

“Humes felt that his presence was becoming detrimental to the club and the 
young players that he had nurtured in his time at the U’s and it would be best 
to remove himself from the equation.

“Robbie would like to place on record his thanks to Tony for his hard work, 
not only over the past 14 months but throughout the years he has been at 
Colchester United.”

The club’s assistant manager Richard Hall and Under-21s manager John McGreal 
will take charge of Saturday’s game at Burton Albion.
