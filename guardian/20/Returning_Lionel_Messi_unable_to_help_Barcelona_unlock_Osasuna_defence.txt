Barcelona's 0-0 draw at Osasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> 
left the Spanish champions one win short of matching the league record for the 
number of consecutive victories at the start of the season.

Atlético Madrid could go top of La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> with a win in Saturday's 
late game at Espanyol that would equal the record of nine wins in the first 
nine games.

Lionel Messi came on as a substitute in the 68th minute, after recovering from 
a right leg injury this week, but not even Barcelona's all-time leading scorer 
could unlock Osasuna's defence.

The draw left Barcelona three points ahead of Real Madrid after their laboured 
2-0 win against Málaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/19/real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
.

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> host Real next 
weekend in the firstclásico of the season, after both play Italian opposition, 
AC Milan and Juventus, respectively, in the Champions League next week.
