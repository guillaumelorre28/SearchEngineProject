In percentage terms, how likely do you think you are to be diagnosed with 
cancer at some point in the future?
The average rate is 50%. Would you like to move your guess up or down?

Now, how likely do you think you are to suffer a domestic burglary over the 
next 12 months?
The average rate is 3%.

The extent to which you changed (or didn’t change) your answers in response to 
the facts is a measure of your optimism. Most people are optimistic, and change 
their answers to give a more favourable outcome. For example, suppose you 
estimated your risk of cancer at 20%. On hearing that the population risk is 
50%, most people up their guess a bit, but not by much (and rarely as high as 
50%).


And suppose you estimated your risk of burglary at 10%. On hearing that the 
population risk is just 3%, most people lower their guess, often to 3% or 
lower. If you changed your answers unfavourably (or not at all) then you’re a 
pessimist or a realist.

Many psychologists argue that the reason behind this optimism bias is that, in 
many cases, dwelling on the true odds of life’s various misfortunes would be 
just too awful to enable us to go about our business.

NB: Although the Independent reported that this claim was debunked in a recent 
study, another study debunked this debunking. It will be interesting to see 
whether the authors of the former study issue a re-debunking that debunks the 
debunking of their own debunking.
