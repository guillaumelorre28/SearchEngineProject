Ángel Di María slotted home the winner as Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> beat Lille 2-1 to capture 
the French League Cup trophy for the third year in succession, and for a record 
sixth time, on Saturday.

The Argentina winger latched on to a poor clearance by Adama Soumaoro in the 
final at the Stade de France and rounded goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama to score 
despite Marko Basa’s lunging effort to try and cut out his 74th-minute shot.

PSG, who have already retained the Ligue 1 title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/13/psg-troyes-9-0-ligue-1-title>
, were reduced to 10 men three minutes earlier when midfielder Adrien Rabiot 
received a second yellow card for a foul on Lille playmaker Soufiane Boufal.

Javier Pastore had put PSG ahead with a disputed goal late in the first half, 
volleying home a punched clearance from Enyeama with Layvin Kurzawa in an 
apparent offside position in the goalkeeper’s line of vision.

Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>, playing in their first 
final, equalised five minutes into the second half when left-back Djibril 
Sidibé hit a free-kick from 22 metres through the wall and past a static 
Salvatore Sirigu in goal.
