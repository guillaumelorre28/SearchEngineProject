Brechin City battled to a 2-2 draw with St Johnstone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stjohnstone> in a highly entertaining 
Scottish Cup quarter-final at Glebe Park.

Brechin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brechin>, second in Division 
Two, survived a scare after five minutes when Liam Craig's shot came back off 
the underside of the bar. However, the home side looked far from overawed 
against top-flight opponents and went close to breaking the deadlock when a low 
drive from Kevin Byers hit a post a minute later.

Brechin had the opportunity to open the scoring just before the break when 
Murray Davidson tripped Neil Janczyk and referee Steve Conroy awarded a 
penalty. Craig Molloy's cool conversion first time around was ruled out for 
encroachment before McAllister stepped up to send Peter Enckelman the wrong way 
with the retaken kick.

The visitors made a change at the break with Jamie Adams making way for Chris 
Millar, and the substitute made an immediate impact. A deflected cross from 
Liam Craig was headed away by Ewan Moyes into the path of Millar, who drilled 
the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.

St Johnstone took the lead after 62 minutes when an in-swinging corner Danny 
Grainger was powerfully headed home by Danny Invincibile.

With 12 minutes remaining, however, the tireless McAllister brought Brechin 
level with a fantastic finish across Enckelman from an acute angle to the 
delight of the home support.

Saints' Stephen Reynolds missed the chance for a late winner when blasted over 
with the goal gaping.
