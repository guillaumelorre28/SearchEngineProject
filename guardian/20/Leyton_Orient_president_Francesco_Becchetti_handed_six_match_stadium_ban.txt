Francesco Becchetti has been handed a six-match stadium ban and fined 40,000 by 
the Football Association after being found guilty of violent conduct.

The 49-year-old Italian’s punishment is in relation to an incident which 
occurred immediately after Orient’s 3-2 home win against Portsmouth on Boxing 
Day when television pictures showed him taking a kick at the club’s assistant 
boss Andy Hessenthaler on the pitch after the final whistle.

Orient claimed afterwards the incident had been “part of an ongoing 
good-natured exchange between the two over the past few weeks”.

But an FA statement read: “Francesco Becchetti will serve a six-match stadium 
ban after a charge of violent conduct against him was found proven, following 
an independent regulatory commission hearing.

“The suspension has been stayed pending any decision regarding an appeal.

“The Leyton Orient president and club owner admitted his behaviour at the end 
of the game against Portsmouth on December 26, 2015 amounted to improper 
conduct, however, he denied it was violent.

“Along with his match-day ban from six first-team matches in approved 
competitions, Mr Becchetti was also fined 40,000 and warned as to his future 
conduct.”

Orient were unavailable for comment when contacted by Press Association Sport, 
but said in an earlier statement on 6 January: “In response to the misconduct 
charge brought by the Football Association, we can confirm that Mr Becchetti, 
Leyton Orient’s president, has admitted improper conduct, but strongly denies 
violent conduct. Mr Becchetti has requested a personal hearing.”
