Southend United have confirmed Phil Brown's appointment as manager after it was
revealed on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/24/southend-paul-sturrock> that 
Paul Sturrock would be leaving the club. The former Derby County, Hull City and 
Preston North End manager has joined the Shrimpers with the club six points off 
the play-off places in League Two with seven games to play. Southend earlier 
confirmed Sturrock will return to lead the side out at Wembley for their 
Johnstone's Paint Trophy final against Crewe on 7 April. Brown said: "I'm 
delighted to have been given the opportunity here and it's a challenge I'm 
really looking forward to. We've got seven league games between now and the end 
of the season, hopefully we can put a winning run together and give ourselves a 
chance of reaching the play-offs.

"We've got a few days of training between now and the game against Bradford 
that will give me a chance to take a look at the players." Brown achieved 
promotion to the Premier League with Hull in 2008 but has been out of work 
since December 2011 following relegations with the Tigers in 2010 and Preston 
the following year.
