Pierogi are a staple of Polish cuisine. Photograph: Alamy 
Seek out domowe (homemade) behind the deli counter or robione ręcznie (made by 
hand) in the refrigerators. If you can’t find any, go for frozen ones over 
machine-made, chilled offerings.

Although commonly served boiled, pierogi can also be baked or fried (ideally 
in rapeseed oil) after parboiling. Serve them drizzled with fried onions,smalec 
(pork fat with pork pieces) or both, and accompany with your choice ofsurówki 
(salads of raw or pickled vegetables) – such as sauerkraut, cucumber or yoghurt 
and dill – and pickles, for balance.

Similar to gnocchi, kopytka (little hooves) are tiny, potato-based dumplings 
that suit shallow frying, but can also be deep-fried as a moreish snack.

If you’re avoiding wheat, try golumpki or gołąbki (dumplings encased in 
cabbage leaf).

The Polish have been obsessing over sourdough for centuries. Any Polski sklep 
worth frequenting will have a daily delivery of rye, wheat and other breads, if 
not an in-house bakery. Freshpączki (doughnuts) are huge and glorious. There’s 
a longstanding tradition of elaborate, French-style cream creations, too.Sernik 
(baked cheesecake) is also a thing of wonder.

Beyond the standard pork kabanos, there are expertly cured meats, including 
chicken and turkey. These come delicately or heavily smoked or cured – and can 
be hung further at home if they are not punchy enough. For those not disposed 
to sausage, there are myriadwędliny (cold, cooked, sometimes-smoked meats), as 
well aspasztety (patés) such as pasztet z gęsi ze śliwką (goose and plum paté) 
andpasztet cielęcy (veal paté).

Karkówka (pork shoulder) is fattier, and therefore more moist, than loin. Have 
your butcher prepare thin steaks for griddling or slow-braise the entire cut. 
Poles adoregolonka (pork knuckle), the fine skin of which makes for light, 
crispy scratchings.

Many delis will have home-pickled ogórki (cucumbers), whether soaked for a 
couple of days with dill, garlic and other herbs (ogórki małosolne) or left to 
ferment and soften (ogórki kiszone). Pickled mushrooms, beetroots, tomatoes and 
cabbage concoctions, such as sauerkraut, are also widely available; seek out 
the Krakus brand.

 Amber is one of Poland’s leading craft breweries. 
Kvass, a Baltic and Slavic staple, is a fermented bread drink that is gaining 
plaudits as a health food due to its purported probiotic powers. As well as 
being the key ingredient inżurek, a rye-bread soup, it can also be used to add 
a refreshing sour note to stews.

Kefir, milk fermented with bacteria and yeast, is apparently brilliant for 
your microbiome.

Kasza and piwa (grains and beers)

Kasza is an umbrella term for grains. The most widely used is kasza gryczana 
(roasted buckwheat), served hot with fried lardons, onions and mushrooms as a 
simple supper or added to cooled salads to bring a welcome nuttiness.Kasza 
jaglana (millet groats) is usually served as a breakfast dish, but also makes 
for a comforting, sauce-absorbing side for meaty mains.

Brits have already taken to Polish lagers such as Tyskie and Żywiec, and 
boutique brewing is on the rise inPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland>. The Gdańsk-based Amber brewery is 
well regarded and makes natural and low-intervention brews. Ales such as Lwówek 
Jankes and porters are also beginning to arrive in the UK. Żywiec’s fine porter 
and wheat beer are rumoured to be on their way here, too.
