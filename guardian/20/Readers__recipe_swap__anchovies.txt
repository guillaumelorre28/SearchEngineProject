How big is an anchovy? It’s a question I’ve asked myself several times this 
week. More often than not those 30g tins of fillets in oil are the smallest 
things in my shopping basket and yet for something so small, they loom large in 
my kitchen. Fully grown, they measure about 30cm longer than the tiny fillets I 
melt in a pan each time I’ve a soup to make or some pasta that needs an extra 
oomph flavour-wise.

Much like the salt they’ve historically been used to substitute, anchovies 
have that quality of being equally at home in the limelight – the flourish on a 
pissaladière – or milling around in the background, in say, a nasi goreng. They 
can add depth of flavour without the slightest whiff of anything fishy. 
Anchovies may be fish, but that’s not all they are. “They’re magic,” a friend 
said, with her first spoonful of these winning tomatoes.

Slow-roasted tomatoes with anchovy and seaweed butter

Sometimes, it’s the little things. The toasted nori flecks and speckles of 
lemon zest in an anchovy butter is such a good idea,DetoutcoeurLimousin 
<http://detoutcoeurlimousin.blogspot.co.uk/>, I’m struggling to think of 
something savoury that would not welcome a dollop of this.


Serves 4
500g tomatoes – sliced in half if large, or left whole if small

For the butter
125g butter
5g nori sheets, roasted 
4 whole tinned anchovies in oil
1 dried red chilli or 1 tsp red chilli flakes
Zest of 1 lemon
1 large garlic clove

1 Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Add all the anchovy and seaweed butter 
ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth and well mixed.

2 Put the tomatoes in a roasting dish. Add 2-3 tsp of the butter and roast in 
the preheated oven for 30-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened.

3 Serve the tomatoes and their juices hot, stirred through pasta, dolloped on 
to bowls of rice or grains, or spread on slices of toast. And do pretty much 
the same with the remaining butter – spread on hot toast, mix into hot pasta, 
dot over roasted veg or baked potatoes.

Anchovy cream

Midwintersnow <https://witness.theguardian.com/user/midwintersnow> sent in a 
Swedish childhood fave – a fishy cream to spread on toast or fill a jacket 
potato. Swedish tinned anchovies (which you can buyonline 
<https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/AnchovyStyle-Sprats-Fillets/78286011?from=search&tags&param=sprats&parentContainer=SEARCHsprats_SHELFVIEW>
) come pickled and spiced, with cinnamon, ginger and sandalwood. They’re as 
sweet-salty as their Mediterranean counterparts but they’re not anchovies, 
despite what it says on the very pretty pink tin. They’re sprats. And with 
cream, they’re also wonderful.


Makes a big bowlful 
300ml whipping cream
125g tin of Swedish anchovies
A sprig of dill, finely chopped (optional)

1 Whip the cream and set aside.

2 Mash up the anchovies with a fork, then mix into the cream with all the 
juices from the tin and the dill.

3 Either use on toast or jacket potatoes, or as a dip with roast veg, or 
freeze in portions for future baked-potato emergencies.

Anchovy and mozzarella baguette

Another mum special, which Arianz <https://witness.theguardian.com/user/arianz>
 and his family ate on lazy Sunday nights, in front of Happy Days. I made these 
for several consecutive breakfasts, which were just as happy – everyone loved 
them.

Serves 4
2 x day-old baguettes 
50g tin of anchovies, drained of their oil
Milk
2 mozzarella balls, thickly sliced

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Cut the baguettes in half, then 
slice at regular intervals on the diagonal, taking care not to cut all the way 
through the loaf – as you would when making garlic bread.

2 Put the half loaves in rectangles of tin foil on a baking tray, and drizzle 
with milk. Set aside for 8-10 minutes, or until the milk has been absorbed.

3 Stuff each cut with an anchovy and a mozzarella slice. Wrap in the foil.

4 Bake for 15 minutes, or until the bread is golden and the mozzarella has 
melted, then serve.

Pissaladière Siciliano

Faye Cooke AKA @borrowedbread’s tart is a mash-up of two anchovy staples: the 
puttanesca pasta sauce and the niçois pizza-lookalike. An inspired combination.

Serves 6
3 tbsp olive oil
4 medium onions, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
1 sprig thyme, leaves picked
5 sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped
2 tsp capers
¼ tsp chilli flakes
375g puff pastry
Flour, for dusting
12 anchovies, halved lengthways
17 pitted black olives
Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve

1 Put the oil, onions, garlic and thyme in a pan, then simmer very slowly for 
about 30 minutes, or until the onions are sweet and soft enough to crush with a 
wooden spoon. Stir frequently.

2 Add the sun-dried tomatoes, capers and chilli flakes to the pan and leave to 
cool slightly while you prepare the pastry. Preheat your oven to 190C/375F/gas 
mark 5.

3 Roll out 375g of puff pastry and place it on a lightly floured baking sheet. 
Prick the base all over with a fork.

4 Spread the onion mixture over the pastry. Arrange the anchovies on top in a 
lattice effect and place a black olive in the centre of each diamond.

5 Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked and the onions are 
golden. Divide into six slices and serve with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive 
oil.

Chilli and anchovy kale

Anchovy in a dressing works with almost any veg and every texture, but kale is 
especially accommodating of its saltiness. This piquant sauce byJustine Wall is 
sublime.

Serves 4 
1 red onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, shaved 
2 anchovy fillets
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp olive oil
30g butter 
Salt and black pepper
Juice of 1 lemon
200g kale, chopped

1 In a small frying pan, fry the onion, garlic, anchovies and chilli flakes in 
the oil and butter until the onion is soft and translucent (this should take 
about 10 minutes). Remove from the heat, and stir through the seasoning and 
lemon juice. Set aside.

2 Steam the kale for about 3-4 minutes only. Remove from the heat and mix well 
with the sauce.

Nasi goreng teri jengki

Bobby Ananta <https://bobbyananta.com/> has a knack for combining several 
instances of the star ingredient in one dish and this is a prime example: the 
paste base uses melting tinned anchovy fillets, while the final dish sports the 
tiny fish whole, dried, fried and crunchy. It’s a powerfully spiced dish – you 
might want to tone down the chilli and pepper. The dried anchovies are 
available from Asian grocers – wonderful for making Japanese and Korean fish 
stock.

Serves 4-6
500g basmati rice
40g dry anchovies
10-15cm piece of cucumber
1 tsp rice wine vinegar
5 shallots, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2cm ginger, finely chopped
3 red chillies, finely sliced
3 bird’s eye chillies, sliced
½ tsp ground white pepper
½ tsp ground Szechuan pepper
½ tsp ground cumin seeds
½ tsp ground nutmeg
50g tin of anchovies in oil
2 tbsp vegetable oil, for frying
2 spring onions, finely sliced
3 makrut lime leaves, finely sliced
A handful of coriander leaves, chopped

 1 Wash and cook the basmati rice. Meanwhile, fry the dry anchovies in some 
oil over a medium heat until browned and crunchy. Set aside.

2 Peel the cucumber, then slice in half. Remove the seeds and discard. Dice 
the rest and mix in a small bowl with the rice wine vinegar and set aside.

3 In a food processor, blitz the shallots, garlic, ginger, chillies, white 
pepper, Szechuan pepper, cumin, nutmeg and soft anchovies into smooth paste.

4 Heat the oil in the wok, then fry the spring onions for about 1 minute. Add 
the paste and fry for 2-3 minutes.

5 Drain the basmati rice, then add it to the wok and stir well. Cook for about 
3 minutes. Add the fried anchovies and makrut lime leaves, then stir well.

6 To serve, top with chopped coriander leaves and diced cucumber.
