“The chairman, Lee Power, thought it was time to make a change and informed 
Mark of his decision on Saturday night after the defeat at Millwall,” the club 
said in a statement. “Lee will take temporary charge of the team but will 
definitely not be the club’s next permanent manager.

“The club have already started drawing up a shortlist and plan to have a 
manager in place by the end of the month.”

Cooper worked with a limited budget since being appointed in 2013 following a 
brief spell as assistant manager and steeredSwindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> to the League One play-off final 
last season. Following the departure of key players such as Ben Gladwin and 
Massimo Luongo in the summer and a spate of injuries, the Wiltshire club are 
now only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.

“The football club would like to place on record their thanks to Mark for his 
outstanding work ethic and commitment to the job during his two-and-a-half-year 
tenure,” the statement added. “Mark did a fantastic job which culminated in the 
club reaching the League One play-off final last season.

“Unfortunately, performances and results this term have not been as good as 
the club had hoped for with the current squad.”
