Full-time: Arsenal 2-2 PSG

It’s all over! PSG are delighted, Arsenal are deflated. The French champions 
go top of Group A based on their superior head-to-head record and all they need 
to do to win it is beat Ludogorets at home in their final match.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are looking at another tough 
last-16 draw unless Ludogorets can do them a favour. Still, look on the bright 
side, at least they won’t be playing Bayern Munich. Thanks for reading and 
emailing. Bye.

82 min: Edinson Cavani should win it again for PSG, but, y’now. With Arsenal 
desperately chasing a third goal, there are wide open spaces for PSG to exploit 
on the break. Forward they go again, threatening to overwhelm Arsenal. Lucas 
curls a devilish ball into the middle and Cavani flings himself at it, only to 
plant his header past the right post. Dearie me. He could have had double 
figures againstArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> this

79 min: Arsenal do their usual, press forward and leave no one back to defend 
the PSG counterattack. Lucas plays Cavani through and he can’t be offside 
seeing as he’s started his run from inside his own half. Luckily forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, it’s Cavani and he’s always got 
the potential to do something absolutely absurd. Through on goal, he reckons 
that he might as well try to go for an elegant chip over Ospina from 20 yards, 
because he is Leo Messi. He’s not Leo Messi. He gets barely any purchase on his 
effort and it’s probably going wide. Ospina saves it, just to make the buffoon 
feel better.

GOAL! Arsenal 2-2 PSG (Lucas, 77 min)

From the right, Hatem Ben Arfa lifts a high corner towards the far post. 
Arsenal decide to leave Lucas Moura unmarked, because why not, what’s he going 
to do anyway? Peeling away from the dozing Jenkinson, Lucas heads it towards 
the right post. Alex Iwobi is standing by it but the ball flicks off his head 
and past Ospina, who might have had it covered. This is a sickener forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. As it stands, PSG are going top.

72 min: Ben Arfa’s first contribution is an extravagant piece of skill to get 
away from two players in the middle of Arsenal’s half. His attempted through 
ball is cut out, butArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
contrive to lose the ball near their own area. Lucas finds Meunier, who whips a 
fine cross into the middle. With Matuidi lurking, Jenkinson does extremely well 
to steer the ball away with his thigh.

63 min: Lucas slips a canny pass through to Cavani, who’s peeled away from 
Koscielny. Or has he? TheArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
centre-back clambers all over Cavani, nipping away at him, making his presence 
felt at the very least. PSG claim he’s tugging Cavani back. They might have a 
point. Cavani tumbles, Ospina smothers. Cavani screams for a penalty; so does 
Unai Emery; the away end is up in arms. Play continues.

GOAL! Arsenal 2-1 PSG (Verratti own goal, 60 min)

This is pure farce from PSG’s perspective and wonderful from Arsenal’s! 
Jenkinson, an increasing influence on the right, slides a low cross into the 
middle. It ricochets around the area and falls to Ramsey. His shot is poor but 
Marquinhos’s attempted clearance clatters against the unwitting Verratti’s 
shins and rebounds past the helpless Areola. Outplayed in the first half,Arsenal
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> lead and are on their way to 
winning the group.

59 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> win a couple of 
corners. Ozil trots across to the right to take a second. It’s a deep one, but 
it’s not a particularly good one.

57 min: This is really opening up now and when an Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> move breaks down, Matuidi leads 
a PSG counterattack down the left. He finds Cavani, who beats one, two, three 
players. But not a fourth. His 25-yard drive is smothered and it’s Arsenal’s 
turn to attack. They steam down the right and the ball’s hoicked into the area 
by Jenkinson. It’s headed away from Sanchez but comes to Giroud, who brings the 
ball down and shoots. It’s heading towards the far corner but it hits a PSG 
defender.

55 min: PSG attempt to turn the screw after that Lucas effort, but Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> deal with their efforts easily 
enough. Then they break. Ozil ambles down the right and Verratti pulls him 
back, picking up a booking that will rule him out of the next game.

54 min: It almost wasn’t worth it. The free-kick’s 25 yards from goal. Cavani 
runs over it and leaves it to Lucas, who wallops it goalwards, the ball 
wobbling and dipping viciously through the air, leaving Ospina rooted to the 
spot and mightily relieved to see it bounce off the bar and over. What an 
effort!

52 min: Koscielny does a Krychowiack and overruns the ball in a dangerous 
area, inviting Lucas to press and nip in. The Brazilian hurtles towards the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> area and Koscielny 
desperately brings him down. The referee waits to see if the ball’s going to 
run to Cavani. When it doesn’t, he awards a free-kick and books Koscielny, 
who’ll reason it was worth it if the free-kick comes to nothing.

49 min: Ospina decides to liven things up with a sharp pass to Koscielny, who 
manages to get the ball under control. While I and other neutrals appreciated 
the sentiment from Ospina, it’s unlikely his team-mates did.

48 min: It’s been a slow start to the second half, with neither side able to 
string that many passes together yet.

46 min: PSG get the second half underway. As it stands, the head-to-head 
record won’t matter if this game finishes 1-1, it will be all about goal 
difference. Arsenal’s is superior by three goals. The potential problem for
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> is that PSG play 
Ludogorets.

“Whether or not the defender made contact (and I say this as a Gooner) Sanchez 
did that thing where he stretched his leg out as if he had actually been 
caught,” says Allan Castle. “The contact was totally irrelevant to what Sanchez 
elected to do. That’s a thing these days, isn’t it?”

On second viewing, maybe it wasn’t a “clear penalty”. My first reaction on 
watching a replay was that it was a preposterous dive from Sanchez, but there 
may well have been a touch from Krychowiack. On BT Sport, Ian Wright reckons 
there was enough contact. So does Michael Owen. I’m inclined to agree.

There’s a suggestion that PSG were actually furious with Alexis Sanchez for 
diving.We’ll have another look in a minute. It was certainly a moronic decision 
from Krychowiack to go to ground.

Half-time: Arsenal 1-1 PSG

Somehow, Arsenal are level. They’ve been awful, PSG have been brilliant. The 
French side deservedly led through Edinson Cavani, only to get a bit too cocky 
right at the end of the half, allowingArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> to equalise through Olivier 
Giroud. The ball’s back in Arsenal’s court now.

PENALTY TO ARSENAL!

45 min: Just as we all start to coo over PSG’s confidence on the ball, 
Krychowiack faffs around near his own area and loses it to Giroud.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> spring into life at last and 
Ozil works the ball to Sanchez on the right of the area. Looking to make 
amends, Krychowiack steams in with a preposterous challenge just as Sanchez

PSG draw the sting of Arsenal and seize initiative in Group A

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/23/arsenal-psg-champions-league-match-report> 
It’s all over! PSG are delighted, Arsenal are deflated. The French champions 
go top of Group A based on their superior head-to-head record and all they need 
to do to win it is beat Ludogorets at home in their final match.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are looking at another tough 
last-16 draw unless Ludogorets can do them a favour. Still, look on the bright 
side, at least they won’t be playing Bayern Munich. Thanks for reading and 
emailing. Bye.
 Olivier Giroud after the game Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters  
90 min+1: Verratti slips a smart pass through to Jese. Koscielny blocks his 
fierce drive. PSG have a corner.
 
90 min: There will be three added minutes.
 
89 min: Jese replaces the outstanding Lucas Moura.
 
88 min: Xhaka ruins a promising Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> break with a pathetic pass that 
flies straight out of play. Wenger isn’t happy.
 
86 min: Meunier has gone down with an injury of some sort. Not for long, 
though. He’s up again to take the throw.
 
82 min: Edinson Cavani should win it again for PSG, but, y’now. With Arsenal 
desperately chasing a third goal, there are wide open spaces for PSG to exploit 
on the break. Forward they go again, threatening to overwhelm Arsenal. Lucas 
curls a devilish ball into the middle and Cavani flings himself at it, only to 
plant his header past the right post. Dearie me. He could have had double 
figures againstArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> this 
season.
 
81 min: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Carl Jenkinson. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are going for broke.
 
80 min: Theo Walcott is on for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. Francis Coquelin is off. PSG 
are menacing again, though, Cavani breaking down the left and scuffing at 
Ospina from a tight angle.
 
79 min: Arsenal do their usual, press forward and leave no one back to defend 
the PSG counterattack. Lucas plays Cavani through and he can’t be offside 
seeing as he’s started his run from inside his own half. Luckily forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, it’s Cavani and he’s always got 
the potential to do something absolutely absurd. Through on goal, he reckons 
that he might as well try to go for an elegant chip over Ospina from 20 yards, 
because he is Leo Messi. He’s not Leo Messi. He gets barely any purchase on his 
effort and it’s probably going wide. Ospina saves it, just to make the buffoon 
feel better.
 
78 min: Granit Xhaka replaces the luckless Alex Iwobi. 
 
From the right, Hatem Ben Arfa lifts a high corner towards the far post. 
Arsenal decide to leave Lucas Moura unmarked, because why not, what’s he going 
to do anyway? Peeling away from the dozing Jenkinson, Lucas heads it towards 
the right post. Alex Iwobi is standing by it but the ball flicks off his head 
and past Ospina, who might have had it covered. This is a sickener forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. As it stands, PSG are going top.

Finney/Getty Images  
76 min: Gibbs heads behind for a corner on the right. And...
 
75 min: The impressive Meunier guides a teasing low cross into the area, 
looking for Cavani, but Ospina plunges down to claim the ball in front of the 
Uruguayan.
 
72 min: Ben Arfa’s first contribution is an extravagant piece of skill to get 
away from two players in the middle of Arsenal’s half. His attempted through 
ball is cut out, butArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
contrive to lose the ball near their own area. Lucas finds Meunier, who whips a 
fine cross into the middle. With Matuidi lurking, Jenkinson does extremely well 
to steer the ball away with his thigh.
 
71 min: Motta decides that he’s Cristiano Ronaldo and shoots from 40 yards. 
He’s not Cristiano Ronaldo.
 
69 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> appear to have 
realised that they’ll have a better chance of holding on to their lead if they 
stop panicking.
 
67 min: Kyrchowiack, who’s had a nightmarish game, is hauled off and replaced 
by Hatem Ben Arfa as PSG look for an equaliser that would swing the group in 
their favour.
 
65 min: PSG have upped the intensity since going behind. Verratti skedaddles 
through the middle but can’t produce a telling final ball. Then Lucas falls on 
the edge of the area. No free-kick.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> need to steady themselves. 
They’re looking shaky again. Meanwhile, Hull City legend Hatem Ben Arfa is 
about to come on for PSG.
 
63 min: Lucas slips a canny pass through to Cavani, who’s peeled away from 
Koscielny. Or has he? TheArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
centre-back clambers all over Cavani, nipping away at him, making his presence 
felt at the very least. PSG claim he’s tugging Cavani back. They might have a 
point. Cavani tumbles, Ospina smothers. Cavani screams for a penalty; so does 
Unai Emery; the away end is up in arms. Play continues.
 
62 min: Looking for an instant riposte, Cavani decides to have a shot from 25 
yards out. He almost hits the corner flag.
 
This is pure farce from PSG’s perspective and wonderful from Arsenal’s! 
Jenkinson, an increasing influence on the right, slides a low cross into the 
middle. It ricochets around the area and falls to Ramsey. His shot is poor but 
Marquinhos’s attempted clearance clatters against the unwitting Verratti’s 
shins and rebounds past the helpless Areola. Outplayed in the first half,Arsenal
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> lead and are on their way to 
winning the group.
 Marco Verratti scores an own goal and the second goal for Arsenal Photograph: 
Eddie Keogh/Reuters  
59 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> win a couple of 
corners. Ozil trots across to the right to take a second. It’s a deep one, but 
it’s not a particularly good one.
 
57 min: This is really opening up now and when an Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> move breaks down, Matuidi leads 
a PSG counterattack down the left. He finds Cavani, who beats one, two, three 
players. But not a fourth. His 25-yard drive is smothered and it’s Arsenal’s 
turn to attack. They steam down the right and the ball’s hoicked into the area 
by Jenkinson. It’s headed away from Sanchez but comes to Giroud, who brings the 
ball down and shoots. It’s heading towards the far corner but it hits a PSG 
defender.
 
55 min: PSG attempt to turn the screw after that Lucas effort, but Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> deal with their efforts easily 
enough. Then they break. Ozil ambles down the right and Verratti pulls him 
back, picking up a booking that will rule him out of the next game.
 
54 min: It almost wasn’t worth it. The free-kick’s 25 yards from goal. Cavani 
runs over it and leaves it to Lucas, who wallops it goalwards, the ball 
wobbling and dipping viciously through the air, leaving Ospina rooted to the 
spot and mightily relieved to see it bounce off the bar and over. What an 
effort!
 
52 min: Koscielny does a Krychowiack and overruns the ball in a dangerous 
area, inviting Lucas to press and nip in. The Brazilian hurtles towards the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> area and Koscielny 
desperately brings him down. The referee waits to see if the ball’s going to 
run to Cavani. When it doesn’t, he awards a free-kick and books Koscielny, 
who’ll reason it was worth it if the free-kick comes to nothing.
 
49 min: Ospina decides to liven things up with a sharp pass to Koscielny, who 
manages to get the ball under control. While I and other neutrals appreciated 
the sentiment from Ospina, it’s unlikely his team-mates did.
 
48 min: It’s been a slow start to the second half, with neither side able to 
string that many passes together yet.
 
46 min: PSG get the second half underway. As it stands, the head-to-head 
record won’t matter if this game finishes 1-1, it will be all about goal 
difference. Arsenal’s is superior by three goals. The potential problem for
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> is that PSG play 
Ludogorets.
 
“Whether or not the defender made contact (and I say this as a Gooner) Sanchez 
did that thing where he stretched his leg out as if he had actually been 
caught,” says Allan Castle. “The contact was totally irrelevant to what Sanchez 
elected to do. That’s a thing these days, isn’t it?”
 
On second viewing, maybe it wasn’t a “clear penalty”. My first reaction on 
watching a replay was that it was a preposterous dive from Sanchez, but there 
may well have been a touch from Krychowiack. On BT Sport, Ian Wright reckons 
there was enough contact. So does Michael Owen. I’m inclined to agree.
 
There’s a suggestion that PSG were actually furious with Alexis Sanchez for 
diving.We’ll have another look in a minute. It was certainly a moronic decision 
from Krychowiack to go to ground.
 
Somehow, Arsenal are level. They’ve been awful, PSG have been brilliant. The 
French side deservedly led through Edinson Cavani, only to get a bit too cocky 
right at the end of the half, allowingArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> to equalise through Olivier 
Giroud. The ball’s back in Arsenal’s court now.
 
With the final kick off the half and Arsenal’s first shot on target, Giroud 
strokes the ball into the bottom right corner with his left foot. Areola dives 
the wrong way andArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are 
level!
