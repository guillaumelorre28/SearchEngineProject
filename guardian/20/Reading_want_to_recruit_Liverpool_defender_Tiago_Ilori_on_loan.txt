The Liverpool central defender Tiago Ilori has been offered a route out of 
Anfield by the Championship club Reading. The Portugal under-23 international, 
who has been unable to make an impact atLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> since arriving from Sporting 
Lisbon in 2013, is wanted by Jaap Stam on loan this month with a view to a 
permanent transfer in the summer.

Liverpool are open to a deal with Ilori not featuring in Jürgen Klopp’s 
first-team plans and spending the season with the under-23s.

Ilori joined Liverpool in a deal worth up to £7m but has made three senior 
appearances – all in the FA Cup last season having been recalled by Klopp from 
a loan spell at Aston Villa due to an injury crisis.

The Hampstead-born defender has also had loan spells with Granada and Bordeaux 
during his time at Liverpool having failed to make a first-team breakthrough 
under the previous manager, Brendan Rodgers.
