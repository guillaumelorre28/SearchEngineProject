The Southend <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southend> chairman, Ron 
Martin, has announced that the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, will be relieved 
of his duties yet expects the Scot to lead the club out at Wembley for the 
Johnstone's Paint Trophy final in two weeks' time.

In a lengthy statement on the club's official website, Martin confirmed the 
Shrimpers would not be renewing Sturrock's contract, which is due to expire 
during the summer, and will appoint a new manager tomorrow as they look to 
reach theLeague Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> 
play-offs.

However, with Southend just 14 days away from a Wembley showpiece against 
Crewe, Martin revealed he had asked Sturrock to take charge in the Johnstone's 
Paint Trophy final â€“ and that he had agreed.

Reports suggest that the former Hull City manager, Phil Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/phil-brown>, is the favourite to replace 
the 56-year-old, who has been in charge since July 2010.
