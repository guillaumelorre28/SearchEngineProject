Gillingham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gillingham> and their 
chairman, Paul Scally, have been charged by the Football Association in 
relation to the dismissal of the striker Mark McCammon following an alleged 
“act of race victimisation”.

McCammon, 36, left the Kent club in 2011, having spent three years with 
Gillingham, and an employment tribunal in Ashford ruled his departure was 
because of racial discrimination. McCammon claimed the club refused him 
treatment for an injury and docked his wages.

The FA has charged Scally and Gillingham with a breach of FA Rule E3. A 
statement read: “In both instances it is alleged that they failed to act in the 
best interests of the game, and/or brought the game into disrepute by 
committing an act of race victimisation by dismissing Mark McCammon.”

Gillingham appealed against the decision by the employment tribunal in 2012, 
but the verdict was upheld by a judge in September 2013 and McCammon, who has 
previously played for a number of Football League clubs including Brentford, 
Millwall, Brighton and Doncaster, was awarded £68,000.

Scally and the club have until 14 November to respond to the FA charge.
