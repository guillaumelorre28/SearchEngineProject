What?

The John Lewis pasta machine 
<http://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-pasta-machine/p201117> costs £32 and 
features steel rollers mounted to clamped base. The rollers are 
width-adjustable by gradation and used to sequentially flatten flour and egg 
mixture.

Why?

You can get fasta pasta, but can you boast about it, dough?

Well?

OK, I’m going to try to write about making pasta without resorting to 
Dolmio-advert stereotypes that make every Italian person sound like the Super 
Mario Bros. (“We make-a da pasta, but first we make-a da love! Mamma mia!” That 
sort of thing.) Although the recipe has only two ingredients, this process 
contains high levels of smuggery, more than any other food handshaped from 
dough. To paraphrase Louis Armstrong, “I see friends at dinner parties, saying 
‘I make my own pasta’/ They’re really saying: ‘So screw you.’”

Like other pasta machines, this John Lewis number is basically a lasagne 
mangle. You feed egg and flour dough through eight narrowing settings, each 
pass yielding a more delicate sheet. You can then send it through the 
tagliatelle or fettuccine roller-blades, slicing it in long strands. You will 
need: one hand to feed the pasta from above, one hand to draw it out so it 
doesn’t clump beneath the rollers, and one hand to turn the handle. My 
prehensile tail came in useful here, but other upright tetrapods may struggle.

A bigger problem is the dough itself, which grows immense and translucent, 
while remaining stickier than Winnie the Pooh’s credit rating. It’s like doing 
origami with fly paper. Any unattended sheets of dough quickly harden, until 
they resemble a pair of Nora Batty’s tights left out on the line. It’s 
maddening. How can this work? Unbelievably, hours of persistence are eventually 
rewarded with some beauteous, non-disintegrating pasta. Seeing that perfect 
sheet streaming into ribbons of yellow, all improbability is redeemed; as if 
I’m handling Faith itself, built on fragile dreams. But let’s not stretch the 
metaphor thinner than the pasta. My resulting bowl of fresh fettuccine, 
parmesan, pepper and olive oil is world-beatingly good. Worth the absurd number 
of hours invested? Well, in for a penne, in for a pound; I had to pasta time 
somehow. I spent it mainly thinking up puns, which you may not thank me for. As 
the Italians might say: “Basta pasta.”

Redeeming features?

It’s nice pretending to be an Italian grandmother. There’s nothing weird about 
that. Maybe it’s you that’s weird.

Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?

Counter. It cannoli get easier. 3/5
