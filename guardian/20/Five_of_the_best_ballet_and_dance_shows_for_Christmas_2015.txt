The Nutcrackers

It’s pointless trying to pretend that Christmas dance isn’t all about The 
Nutcracker. Among the many productions that will be crisscrossing the UK, the 
classiest and most traditional is still that by Peter Wright for the Royal, a 
coming of age love story framed by magical effects. But there’s fine dancing 
and fabulous stage imagery also to be seen in versions byBRB

Sleeping Beauty

Matthew Bourne’s adaptation of the classic Tchaikovsky ballet is as deft an 
overturning of tradition as any of his previous works.First staged in 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/08/matthew-bourne-sleeping-beauty-review>
, it starts out in the not-too-radical world of a Victorian royal court but it 
time-travels its way via vampires and fairies to a fierce denouement, with wild 
child Aurora torn between her gentle New Age boyfriend and the son of the 
wicked fairy Carabosse.
