Thanks for all your emails and tweets tonight. And also for correctly noticing 
that there are SIX teams (Aberdeen, Dundee, Dundee United, Greenock Morton, 
Queen of the South and Queen’s Park) with a double ‘e’ in their name.

“What about Queen’s Celtic?” suggests Philip Cornwall, and 1,056 others. Bye!

GOAL! Nottingham Forest 0-4 Arsenal (Oxlade-Chamberlain)

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> seal their win with 
another fine goal: Oxlade-Chamberlain dummies the ball, and then receives a 
fine through ball from Lucas Perez – what a game the Spaniard has had – before 
the England international hits a left-footed finish into the bottom corner.

GOAL! Leeds 1-0 Blackburn (Woods)

Blackburn concede another late goal, just as they did at Elland Road last 
week! Woods bundles one of the worst finishes of all time just over the line.

stab it in. All hands on deck now for 10-man Reading, who have five minutes to

GOAL! Everton 0-2 Norwich (Murphy)

What a goal! Goodison Park falls silent, as Jacob Murphy turns nicely on the 
edge of the area, gets some space on his left foot and curls his effort into 
the top corner, glancing on the underside of the bar, leaving Stekelenburg 
completely helpless. The Dutchman could only watch as it sailed past him. Shock 
result on the cards.

Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> haven’t had a goal 
threat tonight, and started without a striker, although Arouna Koné is on the 
bench. Strange decision from Koeman. No sign of Oumar Niasse, who joined the 
club for £13.5m in January. He scored in midweek for the club’s U23s, but not 
even on the bench tonight.

GOAL! Nottingham Forest 0-3 Arsenal (Perez)

Great goal from the Spaniard, holding off the considerable figure of Matt 
Mills, rounding theNottingham Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest> keeper and slotting in. 
There’s a few afters with Mills but he’s up on his feet and off to celebrate 
with the jubilant Gooners in the stands. Lovely stuff.

GOAL! Brighton 0-2 Reading (Swift)

Despite Reading being a man down, Jaap Stam’s side have extended their lead 
through the excellent John Swift, who curls a beauty into the top corner, a 
near-identical strike of the goal he scored against Barnsley at the weekend.

Firmino and Coutinho play a one-two on the edge of Derby’s box, and despite

GOAL! Wolfsburg 1-5 Dortmund (Piszczek)

Piszczek’s first Bundesliga goal in two years. This is a quite remarkable 
performance from Dortmund, who apart from a 10 minute period at the start of 
the second half, have obliterated one of the best sides in the division, away 
from home. This is a Dortmund side that sold Gundogan and Mkhitaryan in the 
summer, and is missing Reus, Sahin, Schurrle, Durm, and Kagawa tonight. 
Frightening.

GOAL! Wolfsburg 2-4 Dortmund (Aubameyang)

Against the run of play, but Dortmund twice hit the home side on the 
counter-attack. Devastating play from Castro, who slices through the middle of 
Wolfsburg’s defence and cooly squares the ball across the six yard box for an 
easy finish at the back post for the Gabon striker. Not five minutes earlier, 
the obscenely talented Ousmane Dembélé scored a near identical goal, although 
the French teenager did look a tad offside when Castro provided another assist.

Red card for Reading! Score: Brighton 0-1 Reading

Former Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett given his marching orders for 
a late slide tackle on Oliver Norwood, although replays show that he tried to 
pull out. Two minutes later Glenn Murray hits the bar for Brighton, Reading are 
going to have to hold on – they won on Saturday with 10 men, away at Barnsley.

GOAL! Wolfsburg 1-2 Dortmund (Didavi 53)

Having piled on the pressure since half-time, Wolfsburg deservedly pull one 
back, after Didavi steals in at the near post to prod a neat finish after a 
wondrous cross from their new signing Blaszczykowski. Wolfsburg had an effort 
cleared off the line, they are making a game of it.

GOAL! Nottingham Forest 0-1 Arsenal (Xhaka 23)

A near carbon copy of the Swiss midfielder’s goal at the weekend! Xhaka hits 
in from all of 40 yards, it takes a slight deflection, but continues to fly 
towards the top corner Stojkovic, in Forest’s goal, should do better, but can 
only get a weak hand to it, and the ball drops into the net. No ‘hush’ 
celebration this time.

death. It’s a great atmosphere in Nottingham, “You’ve only come to see the 
Arsenal” sing the visiting fans. “Champions of Europe - you’ll never sing that” 
reply the Forest faithful.

GOAL! Bournemouth 0-1 Preston (Makienok 10)

The first EFL Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/efl-cup> goal of the 
night – the Danish striker Simon Makienok, on a one-year loan deal from Italian 
Serie A side Palermo, finds some space at the back post and makes no mistake.

Very strong Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> team 
out tonight: Coutinho, Origi and Firmino forming a potent front three against a 
Derby side that has struggled so far this season in the Championship. With no 
European football this season, it’s obvious that Klopp are targeting Cup glory, 
with the carrot of a Europa League spot at stake for the EFL Cup winners, 
that’s no surprise.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
1 - Liverpool have been eliminated from just one of their last 13 League Cup 
ties against lower league opposition. Bullies.

Michael will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Daniel Taylor on 
Nottingham Forest’s impressive youth policy:

It is probably a reflection of Nottingham Forest’s difficulties in the modern 
era that when they renew acquaintances withArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> on Tuesday it will be the first 
time in the 21st century they have encountered the club who wear the same 
colours because it was Forest, 130 years ago, who donated a red strip to help 
set them up.

The last occasion the two sides met was in January 1999 when Ron Atkinson had 
just been appointed as Forest’s manager and infamously began his short, 
undistinguished spell more like Rowan Atkinson by climbing into the wrong 
dugout. Forest, with the fingers of relegation closing round their necks, lost 
1-0 and it was their next home game when they played in a nine-goal thriller 
against Manchester United that is still talked about on the banks of the Trent. 
Unfortunately for Forest, they scored only one of the goals.

Today, the club are 13th in English football’s second tier, exactly the 
position whereBrian Clough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brian-clough> 
inherited them in 1975. It is the 12th anniversary of Clough’s death and in the 
12th minute of their EFL Cup tie against Arsenal a tribute is planned for the 
man who led Forest – “the most unprogressive club in the country” as one of 
their own committee members described them – to promotion, a league title, two 
European Cups, four League Cups and a place in football where they could beat 
Barcelona in the European Super Cup yet be clapped out of Camp Nou by the 
Catalan supporters.

Thanks for all your emails and tweets tonight. And also for correctly noticing 
that there are SIX teams (Aberdeen, Dundee, Dundee United, Greenock Morton, 
Queen of the South and Queen’s Park) with a double ‘e’ in their name.

“What about Queen’s Celtic?” suggests Philip Cornwall, and 1,056 others. Bye!

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> seal their win with 
another fine goal: Oxlade-Chamberlain dummies the ball, and then receives a 
fine through ball from Lucas Perez – what a game the Spaniard has had – before 
the England international hits a left-footed finish into the bottom corner.

In Europe, Milan have extended their lead over Lazio to 2-0 thanks to a Niang 
penalty. PSG, meanwhile are 3-0 up over Dijon, with Cavani and Lucas Moura 
adding to the French champions’ tally. Rangers’ match with Queen of the South 
has finished 5-0, with Waghorn bagging a hat-trick, that’s his 37th goal in 43 
appearances for the Glasgow club. They are through to the semi-finals of the 
League Cup in Scotland.

Glenn Murray hooks the ball across the six yard box, and Hemed is there to 
stab it in. All hands on deck now for 10-man Reading, who have five minutes to 
cling on for.
 
After Dan Gosling had given Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> the lead, Danish striker 
Makienok again pops up with five minutes to go. It looks as though we’re 
heading into extra-time in this one!
 
What a goal! Goodison Park falls silent, as Jacob Murphy turns nicely on the 
edge of the area, gets some space on his left foot and curls his effort into 
the top corner, glancing on the underside of the bar, leaving Stekelenburg 
completely helpless. The Dutchman could only watch as it sailed past him. Shock 
result on the cards.

Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> haven’t had a goal 
threat tonight, and started without a striker, although Arouna Koné is on the 
bench. Strange decision from Koeman. No sign of Oumar Niasse, who joined the 
club for £13.5m in January. He scored in midweek for the club’s U23s, but not 
even on the bench tonight.

There’s a few afters with Mills but he’s up on his feet and off to celebrate

, one goal conceded. Wow.
 
Piszczek’s first Bundesliga goal in two years. This is a quite remarkable 
performance from Dortmund, who apart from a 10 minute period at the start of 
the second half, have obliterated one of the best sides in the division, away 
from home. This is a Dortmund side that sold Gundogan and Mkhitaryan in the 
summer, and is missing Reus, Sahin, Schurrle, Durm, and Kagawa tonight. 
Frightening.
 
“Strangely innocuous, in fact invisible, display by Lucas Pérez for Arsenal

Against the run of play, but Dortmund twice hit the home side on the 
counter-attack. Devastating play from Castro, who slices through the middle of 
Wolfsburg’s defence and cooly squares the ball across the six yard box for an 
easy finish at the back post for the Gabon striker. Not five minutes earlier, 
the obscenely talented Ousmane Dembélé scored a near identical goal, although 
the French teenager did look a tad offside when Castro provided another assist.

Half-time scores in the women’s Euro 2017 qualifiers, involving some of the 
home nations. England and Scotland have already qualified for the finals in 
Holland next year, and England will cement top spot in Group 7 if they draw 
with their nearest rivals Belgium. 0-0 in that one at the moment. Scotland are 
guaranteed one of the six best runners-up spots, they are second in Group 1, 
behind Iceland. 1-1 currently in Reykjavik.

Michael will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Daniel Taylor on 
Nottingham Forest’s impressive youth policy:

It is probably a reflection of Nottingham Forest’s difficulties in the modern 
era that when they renew acquaintances withArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> on Tuesday it will be the first 
time in the 21st century they have encountered the club who wear the same 
colours because it was Forest, 130 years ago, who donated a red strip to help 
set them up.

The last occasion the two sides met was in January 1999 when Ron Atkinson had 
just been appointed as Forest’s manager and infamously began his short, 
undistinguished spell more like Rowan Atkinson by climbing into the wrong 
dugout. Forest, with the fingers of relegation closing round their necks, lost 
1-0 and it was their next home game when they played in a nine-goal thriller 
against Manchester United that is still talked about on the banks of the Trent. 
Unfortunately for Forest, they scored only one of the goals.

Today, the club are 13th in English football’s second tier, exactly the 
position whereBrian Clough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brian-clough> 
inherited them in 1975. It is the 12th anniversary of Clough’s death and in the 
12th minute of their EFL Cup tie against Arsenal a tribute is planned for the 
man who led Forest – “the most unprogressive club in the country” as one of 
their own committee members described them – to promotion, a league title, two 
European Cups, four League Cups and a place in football where they could beat 
Barcelona in the European Super Cup yet be clapped out of Camp Nou by the 
Catalan supporters.
