Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> are set to 
complete the signing of the Bordeaux midfielder Wahbi Khazri after agreeing a 
deal with the French Ligue 1 club.

A statement on Bordeaux’s official website 
<http://www.girondins.com/page-accueil> confirmed the departure of the player. 
Reports in France claim he has signed a four-and-a-half year deal with the 
Premier League side for what Sky Sports reported was a £9m fee.

The statement read: “The club has reached an agreement with Sunderland AFC for 
the transfer of Wahbi Khazri.

“The playmaker has a great opportunity with the English club, and he was 
therefore allowed to go to England to negotiate with them.”

The Sunderland manager, Sam Allardyce, turned his attention to Khazri after 
admitting defeat in his battle to sign André Ayew from Swansea.
