Full-time: Ireland 1-1 Holland

A heartening night for Ireland, all things considered. Harry Arter was the 
biggest plus, as he used his full debut to justify the hopes invested in him 
and should certainly be included in the final squad and, indeed, in the 
starting lineup against Sweden. Another deadly finish from Long, a commanding 
display by O’Shea and endless dangerous set-pieces by Brady were also among the 
positives. Duffy did very well at centreback until one lapse in concentration 
enabled De Jong to equalise forHolland

GOAL! Ireland 1-1 Holland (De Jong 85)

Arggh! That’s an ugly blemish on an otherwise encouraging performance by 
Duffy. The centreback was caught out by a cross from the left by Willems, 
leaving De Jong unattended seven yards out. The striker leant backwards before 
demonstrating rare neck flexibility to steer a header into the net. That’s the 
concern with the Irish central defence: no matter who plays, a lapse in 
concentration always seems likely.

84 min: O’Shea clips a decent ball over the top, and McClean scampers after 
it, doing a fine impression of Long, whom he has replace up front. But Veltman 
shows impressive strength to shunt McClean off the ball.

80 min: Duffy meets the corner ahead of Bruma ... and glances the ball just

79 min: Gibson flights an aimless freekick from half-way into the Dutch box. 
There isn’t a single Irish player anywhere near it ... but Bruma panics and

the Dutch have been by Ireland’s setpieces.

Holland substitution: Dost on for Janssen. Meanwhile the crowd are doing 
Mexican waves, which tells you how much the intensity has dropped on the pitch.

71 min: Brady does well to dispossess Berghuis - but then lets the ball run 
out of play. That will giveHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> a chance to recycle possession 
and reapply the pressure that they’ve been applying for the last few minutes. 
They’re got the upperhand in midfield since the changes.

64 min: McGoldrick plays his first loose pass of the night ... but Long nearly 
turns it into a good one anyway, partially because Bruma dawdled so much. But 
just as Long seemed set to race past him on clear on goal, Bruma stretches out 
a leg to tip the ball to safety.

61 min: This diamond formation is looking very handy for Ireland. It’s giving 
them real dynamism in midfield while allowing McGoldrick to display surprising 
guile at the tip, as Hoolahan normally would. Whelan has been decent at the 
base, though James McCarthy would surely be first choice there. Brady and 
Coleman provide the width with regular breaks from the back.

Holland substitution: Watford’s Berghuis comes on for his international debut, 
at the expense of Memphis, who put in one brilliant cross in the first half but 
was otherwise dreadful.

56 min: As Conor Washington gives Northern Ireland a 2-0 lead over Belarus, 
Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> rumble forward for the 
first time in the second half in Dublin. They work Willems into space on the 
right - but the winger’s ensuing cross isabysmal. Danny Blind will need to be 
the Dutch Roberto Martinez to find any positives for his team in this 
performance so far.

53 min: Another Brady freekick causes chaos in the Dutch box! The visitors are 
a shambles, in truth, and Ireland are intent on taking advantage. Three home 
players won headers in the Dutch box after Brady’s delivery, Long eventually 
nutting over from seven yards.

51 min: Another freekick to Ireland in prime crossing territory for Brady. 
Long won it this time, pestering Bruma into a lubberly foul. Brady duly 
provides a wicked cross. It flashes past several players before bouncing off 
Bruma and out for a corner. Brady delivers that too, of course. Duffy soars 
above Bruma but nods the bar over the bar.

48 min: Brady’s freekick is indeed menacing! Bruma beats Duffy to it but heads 
it only as far as Walters, who reacts quickly to nod it back towards goals, but 
not without enough power to get past Cillessen.

47 min: Nice move by Ireland, started by McGoldrick, who’s quietly pulling a 
long of string in midfield. Brady and Arter also got involved before Quinn was 
fouled on the left, giving Brady an opportunity to deliver another menacing 
freekick.

46 min: No substitutions so far, which is a little surprising. Long, for one, 
should have been taken off and sent straight to bed: it is essential that he is 
kept far from harm’s way for the next three weeks.

“Conclusions from the first-half: Ireland will be channelling the spirit of 
Greece at the tournament, it will be another generation beforeHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> qualify foranything, and 
Mourinho will need some serious jedi mind tricks if he’s going to turn Memphis 
Depay into a footballer again.” - Masha Bonfire, who adds: “And why does 
everyone think Virgil van Dijk is good?” Are you suggesting he’s bad just 
because he let John O’Shea get away from him once? OK, I admit that’s alarming, 
but I suggest it would be better to judge Van Dijk on matches that really 
matter to him, rather than an early-summer friendly. And he was superb 
throughout the recent Premier League season: dominant in the air, strong in the 
tackle, smart in his reading of the game, accomplished in the way he moves 
forward and, what’s more, a threat from setpieces, including the freekicks he 
sometimes takes himself.

Half-time: Ireland 1-0 Holland

After a sketchy opening, it’s been a fine half for Ireland. Long, who is being 
watched by Mauricio Pochettino, underlined his importance to his country by 
stabbing into the net after an excellent header by John O’Shea from a corner by 
Robbie Brady, whose set-pieces will also be crucial to Ireland. More 
interestingly, all of the fringe players given an opportunity to enhance their 
claims for a place in the final squad have done so, especially Arter and 
McGoldrick. Duffy has also been commanding in central defence. randolph hasn’t 
had a save to make.

42 min: Tidy play by McGoldrick, who chests down the ball deep in Dutch 
territory and then surveys his options before playing a simple but smart ball 
to Quinn. McGoldrick has done well enough behind the front two to suggest he 
would not disgrace himself if called on to deputise for Wes Hoolahan.

40 min: Arter flies into Memphis as if he’s been shot from a cannon: that’s 
one wild foul too many for the ref, who shows a yellow card. Arter’s 
determination to make an impact is admirable but if he doesn’t control it 
better he could be heading for expulsion, which would be a real blow for him 
and Ireland.

38 min: Memphis tries to beat Coleman down the left, then turns inside and 
pings in a vicious cross towards Promes. If the forward had got a touch, that 
would have been trouble for Randolph, but Promes missed it by inches.

35 min: There’s an actual swagger to Ireland now: they’re making the Dutch 
scamper about as they ping the ball around nicely, Arter very much involved and 
finally showing there’s much more to his game than the exuberant fouls he was 
committing in the first few minutes.

32 min: Willems throws some shapes on the left wing and then fires a cross 
into the box. Duffy sends it away. The Blackburn defender has been dominant so 
far and may even be edging his way into a starting spot in France, though 
Ciaran Clark and Richard Keogh have been better for their countries than for 
their clubs.

GOAL! Ireland 1-0 Holland (Long 30)

Brady delivers a wonderful in-swinger. O’Shea darts away from Van Dijk (yes, 
the world-class Van Dijk) and bangs a magnificent downward header towards goals 
from 10 yards. It’s stopped on the line by a combination of the goalkeeper and 
Janssen, but Long reacts swiftly to stab the rebound into the net!

23 min: Ireland have got a stronger foothold in the game now and starting to 
ask question of the visitors. But it’s more Family Fortunes than University 
Challenge. “This is the first time in living memory the Dutch don’t have a 
world class player in their starting XI,” reckons John McEnerney, who obviously 
needs to watch Van Dijk more.

21 min: Lovely from Long! He peels into space on the let and collects a pass, 
then turns and sprints past Bruma, who takes him down with a crude chop. The 
striker is left with a little gash on his knee but no cause for alarm.

19 min: The ball breaks to Arter at the edge of the area. Always quick to spot 
a scoring chance, he lets fly straight away. But his shot takes a nick off a 
defender, leaving Cillessen with an easy save.

18 min: Quinn intercepts a pass in midfield and lopes down the right. That’s 
exactly the sort of burst that could lead to Irish chances tonight. Long dashes 
into the box and calls for a cross ... but Quinn overhits it, and the 
opportunity fades.

16 min: The camera picks out Mauricio Pochettino in the crowd. Who’s he here 
to watch? Wijnaldum? Long? It’s O’Shea, isn’t it?

14 min: Brady shunts Promes off the ball as the young winger tries to skin him 
down the right. The freekick is curled in towards Van Dijk, but Duffy rises and 
head well clear. The defence has looked solid so far.

12 min: Got to feel sorry so far for McGoldrick, Arter and Quinn. All three 
are scurrying around desperate to impress but the Dutch passing is so crisp 
that the Irish can barely get a touch. The visitors have created no chances yet 
but certainly irritating their hosts.

8 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are popping the 
ball about with increasing zip and Ireland have spent most of the early stages 
chasing. Which makes it a useful warm-up for the Euros, to be fair.

6 min: Ireland’s formation was not easy to predict from the lineups: the 
evidence on the pitch so far is that it’s a 4-4-2 with a midfield diamond - Mc 
Goldrick is at the top, with Long and Walters the front duo.

4 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> stroke the ball 
around in familiar fashion. The old steady build-up as preached recently by 
Louis Van Gaal. It comes to an end when Memphis fails to control a clipped pass 
to him. That, too, is something we’re used to seeing recently.

2 min: Arter’s first involvement sees him crunch into Strootman around 
mid-way. Not the sort of tackle a player wants to cop just before heading off 
on his holidays, and a sign of over-eagerness from Arter. He’d be booked for 
that in a proper match.

1 min: Off we go amid a low-key atmosphere. Lansdowne Road - as it must still 
be called - looks about 60% full. Maybe that’s because Bruce Springsteen is 
playing at Croke Park tonight, or because people are savouring some pints 
elsewhere.

OK, so it turns out the Dutch are sticklers for tradition even if they can’t 
play football like they used to: their jerseys are orange, albeit with a blue 
satin trim.

The teams take to the pitch. Ireland are modelling their white away jersey and 
it’s rather natty, with the four green rings on each arm an elegant touch.
Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are still wearing their 
orange tracksuit tops to generate suspense before the big reveal of their 
jerseys: or perhaps they’re not wearing any jerseys, playing bare-top to 
highlight their fall from grace. These will be the first Euros since 1984 
without the former champions.

Martin O’Neill has just been interviewed about the inclusion of Harry Arter, 
who’s making only his second appearance for Ireland tonight. It was a most 
illuminating conversation:

Q: What are you expecting from Harry Arter?

MON: I”d like him to play well. 

Q: Will he start wide?

MON: I didn’t say he’ll start wide.

Q: Will he?

MON: No.

Q: WHere will he start?

MON: In the middle of the field..

Preamble:

How humbling for the Dutch to be reduced to the role of sparring partners for 
the big boys. Holland are in Dublin solely to help theRepublic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> limber up for Euro 
2016 and to vent a little frustration, for all the good that’ll do them. Mostly 
this evening is about helping Martin O’Neill to make up his mind on a few close 
calls before he cuts his squad on Tuesday night from 35 players to the final 
23. If he has not already decided to take Harry Arter, then hopefully he will 
be convinced over the next few days that the Bournemouth man needs to be cast 
not only into the travelling party but the starting XI for the match against 
Sweden at the Stade de France on June 13, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be 
subdued by a central defensive duo consisting of … er … well, that’s some food 
for thought that may be giving O’Neill indigestion at the moment: perhaps we’ll 
see something from Shane Duffy tonight to make that match-up seem more 
palatable. And will David McGoldrick seize his chance to take one of the 
forward berths? Will Dundalk goalkeeper Gary Rogers be given a cap an 
opportunity to become the first domestic-based player to go with Ireland to a 
major tournament?


Point of order: It is unlawful to mention Holland being in Dublin without 
referring to that day in 2001 when Jason McAteer sent Lansdowne Road into 
delirium (and Louis Van Gaal, desperately seeking an equaliser, showcased a 
philosophy that involved smashing long balls up to a premonition of Marouane 
Fellaini). But Ireland-Holland clashes have also produced other classic 
moments, includingTommy Coyne’s finest night in green

4-0, fittingly – and gave persuasive evidence, if it were needed, that Steve 
Staunton was not the manager to inspire glory. Tonight we’ll be looking for 
more encouraging lessons. And, most of all, no injuries.

A heartening night for Ireland, all things considered. Harry Arter was the 
biggest plus, as he used his full debut to justify the hopes invested in him 
and should certainly be included in the final squad and, indeed, in the 
starting lineup against Sweden. Another deadly finish from Long, a commanding 
display by O’Shea and endless dangerous set-pieces by Brady were also among the 
positives. Duffy did very well at centreback until one lapse in concentration 
enabled De Jong to equalise forHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, who were weak overall.
 
90+1 min: Promes wins a corner off Coleman and then goes to take it himself. 
Randolph punches it well clear.
 
89 min: Northern Ireland are now 3-0 up against Belarus, Grigg the scorer this 
time.
 
88 min: Ireland attempt to regain their lead. It’s an earnest but scruffy 
build-up, but McClean eventually digs out a cross from the left.Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> clear but Ireland work it back 
to O’Kane, who shoots on the spin from 16 yards. Easy stop for Cillessen.
 
Arggh! That’s an ugly blemish on an otherwise encouraging performance by 
Duffy. The centreback was caught out by a cross from the left by Willems, 
leaving De Jong unattended seven yards out. The striker leant backwards before 
demonstrating rare neck flexibility to steer a header into the net. That’s the 
concern with the Irish central defence: no matter who plays, a lapse in 
concentration always seems likely.
 
84 min: O’Shea clips a decent ball over the top, and McClean scampers after 
it, doing a fine impression of Long, whom he has replace up front. But Veltman 
shows impressive strength to shunt McClean off the ball.
 
Holland substitution: De Jong on for Wijnaldum, who made no impact. 

Ireland substitution: O’Kane on for Arter, who has surely booked his ticket to 
France.
 
80 min: Duffy meets the corner ahead of Bruma ... and glances the ball just 
wide of the far post!
 
79 min: Gibson flights an aimless freekick from half-way into the Dutch box. 
There isn’t a single Irish player anywhere near it ... but Bruma panics and 
heads the ball out for a corner anyway. That’s an indication of how frazzled 
the Dutch have been by Ireland’s setpieces.
 
77 min: Willems sends a long diagonal ball into the box. Dost gets above 
O’Shea but fails to direct his header anywhere other than wide.
 
Ireland substitution: Hoolahan on for McGoldrick.
 
Holland substitution: Dost on for Janssen. Meanwhile the crowd are doing 
Mexican waves, which tells you how much the intensity has dropped on the pitch.
 
71 min: Brady does well to dispossess Berghuis - but then lets the ball run 
out of play. That will giveHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> a chance to recycle possession 
and reapply the pressure that they’ve been applying for the last few minutes. 
They’re got the upperhand in midfield since the changes.
 
Holland substitution: Van Ginkel on for Strootman.
 
69 min: Willens curls in a cross from the let. Janssen meets it at the far 
post and tries to head it across the face of goal. Randolph intervenes.
 
Ireland substitutions: McClean, Hendrick and Gibson and for Long, Quinn and 
Whelan.
 
64 min: McGoldrick plays his first loose pass of the night ... but Long nearly 
turns it into a good one anyway, partially because Bruma dawdled so much. But 
just as Long seemed set to race past him on clear on goal, Bruma stretches out 
a leg to tip the ball to safety.
 
61 min: This diamond formation is looking very handy for Ireland. It’s giving 
them real dynamism in midfield while allowing McGoldrick to display surprising 
guile at the tip, as Hoolahan normally would. Whelan has been decent at the 
base, though James McCarthy would surely be first choice there. Brady and 
Coleman provide the width with regular breaks from the back.
 
Holland substitution: Watford’s Berghuis comes on for his international debut, 
at the expense of Memphis, who put in one brilliant cross in the first half but 
was otherwise dreadful.
 
56 min: As Conor Washington gives Northern Ireland a 2-0 lead over Belarus, 
Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> rumble forward for the 
first time in the second half in Dublin. They work Willems into space on the 
right - but the winger’s ensuing cross isabysmal. Danny Blind will need to be 
the Dutch Roberto Martinez to find any positives for his team in this 
performance so far.
 
53 min: Another Brady freekick causes chaos in the Dutch box! The visitors are 
a shambles, in truth, and Ireland are intent on taking advantage. Three home 
players won headers in the Dutch box after Brady’s delivery, Long eventually 
nutting over from seven yards.
 
51 min: Another freekick to Ireland in prime crossing territory for Brady. 
Long won it this time, pestering Bruma into a lubberly foul. Brady duly 
provides a wicked cross. It flashes past several players before bouncing off 
Bruma and out for a corner. Brady delivers that too, of course. Duffy soars 
above Bruma but nods the bar over the bar.
 
48 min: Brady’s freekick is indeed menacing! Bruma beats Duffy to it but heads 
it only as far as Walters, who reacts quickly to nod it back towards goals, but 
not without enough power to get past Cillessen.
 
47 min: Nice move by Ireland, started by McGoldrick, who’s quietly pulling a 
long of string in midfield. Brady and Arter also got involved before Quinn was 
fouled on the left, giving Brady an opportunity to deliver another menacing 
freekick.
 
46 min: No substitutions so far, which is a little surprising. Long, for one, 
should have been taken off and sent straight to bed: it is essential that he is 
kept far from harm’s way for the next three weeks.
 
“Conclusions from the first-half: Ireland will be channelling the spirit of 
Greece at the tournament, it will be another generation beforeHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> qualify foranything, and 
Mourinho will need some serious jedi mind tricks if he’s going to turn Memphis 
Depay into a footballer again.” - Masha Bonfire, who adds: “And why does 
everyone think Virgil van Dijk is good?” Are you suggesting he’s bad just 
because he let John O’Shea get away from him once? OK, I admit that’s alarming, 
but I suggest it would be better to judge Van Dijk on matches that really 
matter to him, rather than an early-summer friendly. And he was superb 
throughout the recent Premier League season: dominant in the air, strong in the 
tackle, smart in his reading of the game, accomplished in the way he moves 
forward and, what’s more, a threat from setpieces, including the freekicks he 
sometimes takes himself.
 
After a sketchy opening, it’s been a fine half for Ireland. Long, who is being 
watched by Mauricio Pochettino, underlined his importance to his country by 
stabbing into the net after an excellent header by John O’Shea from a corner by 
Robbie Brady, whose set-pieces will also be crucial to Ireland. More 
interestingly, all of the fringe players given an opportunity to enhance their 
claims for a place in the final squad have done so, especially Arter and 
McGoldrick. Duffy has also been commanding in central defence. randolph hasn’t 
had a save to make.
 
45+1 min: Memphis miscontrols, allowing Arter to nip in and play a dainty 
offload to Walters. The Dutch are in disarray at the back - but Walters fails 
to beat the first defender.
 
45 min: There’ll be one more minute in a half that has been full of 
encouragement for Ireland.
 
42 min: Tidy play by McGoldrick, who chests down the ball deep in Dutch 
territory and then surveys his options before playing a simple but smart ball 
to Quinn. McGoldrick has done well enough behind the front two to suggest he 
would not disgrace himself if called on to deputise for Wes Hoolahan.
 
40 min: Arter flies into Memphis as if he’s been shot from a cannon: that’s 
one wild foul too many for the ref, who shows a yellow card. Arter’s 
determination to make an impact is admirable but if he doesn’t control it 
better he could be heading for expulsion, which would be a real blow for him 
and Ireland.
 
38 min: Memphis tries to beat Coleman down the left, then turns inside and 
pings in a vicious cross towards Promes. If the forward had got a touch, that 
would have been trouble for Randolph, but Promes missed it by inches.
 
35 min: There’s an actual swagger to Ireland now: they’re making the Dutch 
scamper about as they ping the ball around nicely, Arter very much involved and 
finally showing there’s much more to his game than the exuberant fouls he was 
committing in the first few minutes.
 
32 min: Willems throws some shapes on the left wing and then fires a cross 
into the box. Duffy sends it away. The Blackburn defender has been dominant so 
far and may even be edging his way into a starting spot in France, though 
Ciaran Clark and Richard Keogh have been better for their countries than for 
their clubs.
 
Brady delivers a wonderful in-swinger. O’Shea darts away from Van Dijk (yes, 
the world-class Van Dijk) and bangs a magnificent downward header towards goals 
from 10 yards. It’s stopped on the line by a combination of the goalkeeper and 
Janssen, but Long reacts swiftly to stab the rebound into the net!
 
28 min: McGoldrick flights a delicate pass from the centre circle to Coleman 
near the right-hand corner flag. The cross is put behind for a corner, and 
Duffy and O’Shea strides up from the back ...
 
25 min: Pochettino, you may be interested to know, is sitting beside Pat 
Dolan, whose various occupations include being the agent of Shane Long...
 
23 min: Ireland have got a stronger foothold in the game now and starting to 
ask question of the visitors. But it’s more Family Fortunes than University 
Challenge. “This is the first time in living memory the Dutch don’t have a 
world class player in their starting XI,” reckons John McEnerney, who obviously 
needs to watch Van Dijk more.
 
21 min: Lovely from Long! He peels into space on the let and collects a pass, 
then turns and sprints past Bruma, who takes him down with a crude chop. The 
striker is left with a little gash on his knee but no cause for alarm.
 
19 min: The ball breaks to Arter at the edge of the area. Always quick to spot 
a scoring chance, he lets fly straight away. But his shot takes a nick off a 
defender, leaving Cillessen with an easy save.
 
18 min: Quinn intercepts a pass in midfield and lopes down the right. That’s 
exactly the sort of burst that could lead to Irish chances tonight. Long dashes 
into the box and calls for a cross ... but Quinn overhits it, and the 
opportunity fades.
 
16 min: The camera picks out Mauricio Pochettino in the crowd. Who’s he here 
to watch? Wijnaldum? Long? It’s O’Shea, isn’t it?
 
14 min: Brady shunts Promes off the ball as the young winger tries to skin him 
down the right. The freekick is curled in towards Van Dijk, but Duffy rises and 
head well clear. The defence has looked solid so far.
 
12 min: Got to feel sorry so far for McGoldrick, Arter and Quinn. All three 
are scurrying around desperate to impress but the Dutch passing is so crisp 
that the Irish can barely get a touch. The visitors have created no chances yet 
but certainly irritating their hosts.
 
10 min: Promes fires in a testing out-swinging corner. O’Shea heads clear with 
encouraging authority.
 
8 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are popping the 
ball about with increasing zip and Ireland have spent most of the early stages 
chasing. Which makes it a useful warm-up for the Euros, to be fair.
 
6 min: Ireland’s formation was not easy to predict from the lineups: the 
evidence on the pitch so far is that it’s a 4-4-2 with a midfield diamond - Mc 
Goldrick is at the top, with Long and Walters the front duo.
 
4 min: Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> stroke the ball 
around in familiar fashion. The old steady build-up as preached recently by 
Louis Van Gaal. It comes to an end when Memphis fails to control a clipped pass 
to him. That, too, is something we’re used to seeing recently.
 
2 min: Arter’s first involvement sees him crunch into Strootman around 
mid-way. Not the sort of tackle a player wants to cop just before heading off 
on his holidays, and a sign of over-eagerness from Arter. He’d be booked for 
that in a proper match.
 
1 min: Off we go amid a low-key atmosphere. Lansdowne Road - as it must still 
be called - looks about 60% full. Maybe that’s because Bruce Springsteen is 
playing at Croke Park tonight, or because people are savouring some pints 
elsewhere.
 
OK, so it turns out the Dutch are sticklers for tradition even if they can’t 
play football like they used to: their jerseys are orange, albeit with a blue 
satin trim.
 
The teams take to the pitch. Ireland are modelling their white away jersey and 
it’s rather natty, with the four green rings on each arm an elegant touch.
Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> are still wearing their 
orange tracksuit tops to generate suspense before the big reveal of their 
jerseys: or perhaps they’re not wearing any jerseys, playing bare-top to 
highlight their fall from grace. These will be the first Euros since 1984 
without the former champions.
 
Martin O’Neill has just been interviewed about the inclusion of Harry Arter, 
who’s making only his second appearance for Ireland tonight. It was a most 
illuminating conversation:

Q: What are you expecting from Harry Arter?

MON: I”d like him to play well. 

Q: Will he start wide?

MON: I didn’t say he’ll start wide.

Q: Will he?

MON: No.

Q: WHere will he start?

MON: In the middle of the field..

How humbling for the Dutch to be reduced to the role of sparring partners for 
the big boys. Holland are in Dublin solely to help theRepublic of Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> limber up for Euro 
2016 and to vent a little frustration, for all the good that’ll do them. Mostly 
this evening is about helping Martin O’Neill to make up his mind on a few close 
calls before he cuts his squad on Tuesday night from 35 players to the final 
23. If he has not already decided to take Harry Arter, then hopefully he will 
be convinced over the next few days that the Bournemouth man needs to be cast 
not only into the travelling party but the starting XI for the match against 
Sweden at the Stade de France on June 13, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be 
subdued by a central defensive duo consisting of … er … well, that’s some food 
for thought that may be giving O’Neill indigestion at the moment: perhaps we’ll 
see something from Shane Duffy tonight to make that match-up seem more 
palatable. And will David McGoldrick seize his chance to take one of the 
forward berths? Will Dundalk goalkeeper Gary Rogers be given a cap an 
opportunity to become the first domestic-based player to go with Ireland to a 
major tournament?


Point of order: It is unlawful to mention Holland being in Dublin without 
referring to that day in 2001 when Jason McAteer sent Lansdowne Road into 
delirium (and Louis Van Gaal, desperately seeking an equaliser, showcased a 
philosophy that involved smashing long balls up to a premonition of Marouane 
Fellaini). But Ireland-Holland clashes have also produced other classic 
moments, includingTommy Coyne’s finest night in green 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk0GU_bZCfY> and Mark Lawrenson’s 
transformation into a right-winger capable of skinning Ruud Krol, no less, 
before teeing up Frank Stapleton for possibly the greatest Irish header not 
scored against England (go to3mins15sec here <http:// 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kry2IX7dQZE>). And the last time Holland went 
to Dublin, in 2006, they inflicted Ireland’s heaviest home defeat in 40 years – 
4-0, fittingly – and gave persuasive evidence, if it were needed, that Steve 
Staunton was not the manager to inspire glory. Tonight we’ll be looking for 
more encouraging lessons. And, most of all, no injuries.
