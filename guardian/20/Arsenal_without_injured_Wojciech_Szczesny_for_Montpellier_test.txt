Arsenal will be without their first-choice goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny 
because of an ankle problem for their trip to Montpellier in their opening
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> match 
on Tuesday.

Vito Mannone will again deputise for the Polish goalkeeper, who conceded a 
sloppy goal in Arsenal's 6-1 win over Southampton on Saturday, with 21-year-old 
James Shea on the bench.

Mannone has started two matches already for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> this season and the Italian kept 
clean sheets against Stoke City and Liverpool.

Abou Diaby, who has had a hip injury, is in the 18-man squad but Andrey 
Arshavin missed out.
