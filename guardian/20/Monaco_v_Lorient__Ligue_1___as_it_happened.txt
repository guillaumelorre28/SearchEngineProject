With PSG dropping points on Friday, this was a golden chance for Monaco to 
steal a march on theirLigue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> rivals, but a poorly 
defended high line, a Ricardo Carvalho red-card and excellent counter-attacking 
football from Lorient, resulted in a shock result, their first ever win in 
Monaco!


Falcao came off the bench and scored a penalty but looked fairly rusty, which 
is understandable. Berbatov had his chances, alas we didn’t get that MOMENT. 
Another night perhaps.

Lewis Dalgarno (@lewisdalgarno) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> why did Monaco have to 
go and make things so complicated?

I don’t know Lewis, I just don’t know. 


Thanks for reading, enjoy what’s left of your weekend. Bye!

90 mins: Falcao twists and turns in the box but that is an excellent tackle 
from Kone. He had to get that one right, otherwise it would have been another 
penalty! Hands on hips time for Monaco! Two added minutes to come.

Abdennour is caught in possession and and Moutinho fails to track his marker, 
Lavigne, who is acres of space. Aboudakar makes a simple pass into space, and 
the substitute winger has all the time in the world to pick his spot as he 
bears down on Subasic. He opts for a low finish to the near post and it’s the 
right decision. 2-1!

85 min: Free-kick to Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> wide

83 min: Monaco have actually played better with 10 men rather than 11, 
although they haven’t carved out any more openings as yet.Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> still post a threat on the 
break, another very tight offside call! Aboudakar was a yard too keen, 
otherwise he’d have been clean through!

Subasic will compete with Maarten Stekelenburg for the No1 jersey this season, 
after the Dutchman signed on loan from Fulham yesterday. Just look at that 
balcony!

The deal also kills any chance of a deal for Victor Valdes, who I assume is 
still struggling with that knee injury. Does anyone know how he is getting on?

80 min: Aboudakar sets off on another bustling run, powering his way to goal 
unchallenged. He is forced wide and the last minute and Subasic narrows the 
angle further still. He looks very pleased with himself after putting that 
behind for a corner.

Falcao is off the mark for the season, and lifts this penalty into the top 
left hand corner. Lecomte wasn’t far away there but it’s 1-1.

77 min: Penalty for Monaco! Oh that was soft! Falcao scuffs a volley goalwards 
but it ends up as a useful pass to Berbatov’s feet. He feels Kone at his back 
and hits the ground. That’s never a pen but the referee points to the spot!

75 min: Martial comes on for Carrasco. This 18-year-old is definitely one to 
watch. He’s been tracked by a number of clubs and many have compared him to 
Thierry Henry, he’s even from the same Parisian suburb!Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> make a sub: Lavigne on for 
Jouffre.

72 min: Lorient are beginning to keep the ball a bit better. This would be a 
huge result for them and their manager Sylvain Ripoll. Ripoll is aLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> legend, having captained the 
club as a player, and having made over 200 appearances.

3 - Lorient have only won three of their 16 oppositions against Monaco in 
Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> (D5, L8). Complex.

69 min: So close for 10-man Monaco! A straight-forward corner lands at the 
back post and Berbatov is completely unmarked, heading back across goal. Falcao 
tries to get a nick on it to deceive Lecomte but he just misses and the keeper 
makes a fine tip around the post! Another great save!

Almost exactly the same challenge as he made for his first caution – Coutadeur 
pushed the ball beyond Carvalho, who just doesn’t have the pace to keep up 
these days. Instead of tracking the man, he just takes Coutadeur out. It’s an 
easy decision, although Monaco’s bench are quick to get up and tell theLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> player what they think!

RED CARD! Ricardo Carvalho (Monaco)

Could that be the nail in Monaco’s coffin? A second yellow for the Portuguese.

64 min: Aboubakar chases a lost cause down the right channel and hassles 
Abdennour all the way to the byline, before eventually bundling him to the 
deck. He’s been given a yellow card, and I have absolutely no idea why. That

57 min: Kurzawa makes his first break of the half down the left and cuts it 
back to Germain on the edge of the box, but he slices it wide – it actually 
could have turned into a pass for Berbatov but the 33 year old couldn’t react 
quickly enough.

53 min: Two big saves from Lecomte in under a minute, both from Carrasco 
efforts. The first is a scrambling save, making himself big to deny the winger 
after a nice lay-off from Berbatov. The second was pure reactions, a powerful 
shot pushed wide.

51 min: Carrasco needlessly runs the ball out of play with Sunu and Aboudakar 
playing a nice one-two. Sunu is then unceremoniously fouled by Carvalho – that 
was cynical and the veteran defender knew exactly what he was doing. Takes the 
yellow, and a good foul to give away, with Sunu in the clear.

49 min: Close for Berbatov. A Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> corner is flicked on at the near 
post, but it’s more of a looped flick and again the Bulgarian has to climb to 
get any purchase on the header. The loop also allows Lecomte to scramble across 
goal and turn Berbatov’s header behind for another corner, which is wasted.

46 min: Berbatov gets a lovely slide-rule pass from Moutinho but his first 
touch lets him down (!) and a poor pass forces Germain wide. That was a golden 
opportunity for Berbs, if he’s taken it on, he’d have been in on goal.

James Rodriguez is far, far away from this mess in Monaco

showing off his new golden boots, designed for him after winning the Golden

close  
With PSG dropping points on Friday, this was a golden chance for Monaco to 
steal a march on theirLigue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> rivals, but a poorly 
defended high line, a Ricardo Carvalho red-card and excellent counter-attacking 
football from Lorient, resulted in a shock result, their first ever win in 
Monaco!


Falcao came off the bench and scored a penalty but looked fairly rusty, which 
is understandable. Berbatov had his chances, alas we didn’t get that MOMENT. 
Another night perhaps.

Thanks for reading, enjoy what’s left of your weekend. Bye!

 
A famous win for the visitors! What an upset!

 
90+2 mins: Kurzawa mis-controls an easy pass and it goes out for a Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> throw. In the stands, Prince 
Albert II walks out in his executive box in disgust. You can see him swearing. 
Go on Al.

 
90 mins: Falcao twists and turns in the box but that is an excellent tackle 
from Kone. He had to get that one right, otherwise it would have been another 
penalty! Hands on hips time for Monaco! Two added minutes to come.

 
Abdennour is caught in possession and and Moutinho fails to track his marker, 
Lavigne, who is acres of space. Aboudakar makes a simple pass into space, and 
the substitute winger has all the time in the world to pick his spot as he 
bears down on Subasic. He opts for a low finish to the near post and it’s the 
right decision. 2-1!

 
Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> have paid the price for 
that high defensive line!

 
85 min: Free-kick to Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> wide 
of the box, you’d have to say that set-pieces represent the best chance of 
scoring. It’s a poor delivery from Moutinho, that’s a waste!

 
83 min: Monaco have actually played better with 10 men rather than 11, 
although they haven’t carved out any more openings as yet.Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> still post a threat on the 
break, another very tight offside call! Aboudakar was a yard too keen, 
otherwise he’d have been clean through!

 
Subasic will compete with Maarten Stekelenburg for the No1 jersey this season, 
after the Dutchman signed on loan from Fulham yesterday. Just look at that 
balcony!

<https://twitter.com/AS_Monaco/statuses/498153666936045568> 
The deal also kills any chance of a deal for Victor Valdes, who I assume is 
still struggling with that knee injury. Does anyone know how he is getting on?

 
80 min: Aboudakar sets off on another bustling run, powering his way to goal 
unchallenged. He is forced wide and the last minute and Subasic narrows the 
angle further still. He looks very pleased with himself after putting that 
behind for a corner.

 
Falcao is off the mark for the season, and lifts this penalty into the top 
left hand corner. Lecomte wasn’t far away there but it’s 1-1.

 
The 10 men have done it!

 
77 min: Penalty for Monaco! Oh that was soft! Falcao scuffs a volley goalwards 
but it ends up as a useful pass to Berbatov’s feet. He feels Kone at his back 
and hits the ground. That’s never a pen but the referee points to the spot!

 
75 min: Martial comes on for Carrasco. This 18-year-old is definitely one to 
watch. He’s been tracked by a number of clubs and many have compared him to 
Thierry Henry, he’s even from the same Parisian suburb!Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> make a sub: Lavigne on for 
Jouffre.

 
72 min: Lorient are beginning to keep the ball a bit better. This would be a 
huge result for them and their manager Sylvain Ripoll. Ripoll is aLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> legend, having captained the 
club as a player, and having made over 200 appearances.

3 - Lorient have only won three of their 16 oppositions against Monaco in 
Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> (D5, L8). Complex.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJean/statuses/498533170560917504>  
69 min: So close for 10-man Monaco! A straight-forward corner lands at the 
back post and Berbatov is completely unmarked, heading back across goal. Falcao 
tries to get a nick on it to deceive Lecomte but he just misses and the keeper 
makes a fine tip around the post! Another great save!

 
Almost exactly the same challenge as he made for his first caution – Coutadeur 
pushed the ball beyond Carvalho, who just doesn’t have the pace to keep up 
these days. Instead of tracking the man, he just takes Coutadeur out. It’s an 
easy decision, although Monaco’s bench are quick to get up and tell theLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> player what they think!

 
Could that be the nail in Monaco’s coffin? A second yellow for the Portuguese.

 
Wooo!

64 min: Aboubakar chases a lost cause down the right channel and hassles 
Abdennour all the way to the byline, before eventually bundling him to the 
deck. He’s been given a yellow card, and I have absolutely no idea why. That 
was tame.

 
62 min: First Lorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> sub – 
Mesloub, signed from Le Havre in the summer, comes on for Diallo.

 
58 min: Falcao is on! Ocampos comes off, and the Stade de Louis II goes as 
nuts as a half-empty stadium can go.

 
57 min: Kurzawa makes his first break of the half down the left and cuts it 
back to Germain on the edge of the box, but he slices it wide – it actually 
could have turned into a pass for Berbatov but the 33 year old couldn’t react 
quickly enough.

 
56 min: Falcao and Jardim having a chat, he’s coming on! Moutinho is beginning 
to dictate the play now, from deep.

 
53 min: Two big saves from Lecomte in under a minute, both from Carrasco 
efforts. The first is a scrambling save, making himself big to deny the winger 
after a nice lay-off from Berbatov. The second was pure reactions, a powerful 
shot pushed wide.

 
51 min: Carrasco needlessly runs the ball out of play with Sunu and Aboudakar 
playing a nice one-two. Sunu is then unceremoniously fouled by Carvalho – that 
was cynical and the veteran defender knew exactly what he was doing. Takes the 
yellow, and a good foul to give away, with Sunu in the clear.

 
49 min: Close for Berbatov. A Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> corner is flicked on at the near 
post, but it’s more of a looped flick and again the Bulgarian has to climb to 
get any purchase on the header. The loop also allows Lecomte to scramble across 
goal and turn Berbatov’s header behind for another corner, which is wasted.

 
48 min: To compound Berbatov’s misery, now he’s booked, for what looks like an 
innocuous challenge on Coutadeur, who used to play forMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>, incidentally. 

 
46 min: Berbatov gets a lovely slide-rule pass from Moutinho but his first 
touch lets him down (!) and a poor pass forces Germain wide. That was a golden 
opportunity for Berbs, if he’s taken it on, he’d have been in on goal.

 
The teams are back out, Falcao is doing a few stretches. Peep peep, we’re off 
again.

 
James Rodriguez is far, far away from this mess in Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>. And as though to rub it in, he’s 
showing off his new golden boots, designed for him after winning the Golden 
Boot at the World Cup. Urgh.

You have to take your hat off to Lorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient>, they’ve executed their game 
plan perfectly here. How long until Falcao comes on? If Monaco are to maintain 
their impressive home record, you’d have to say soon!
