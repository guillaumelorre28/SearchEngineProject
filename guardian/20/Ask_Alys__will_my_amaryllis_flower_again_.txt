My amaryllis was in bloom when I brought it in from the garden, where it had 
spent the summer. The four beautiful flowers have since died. How do I manage 
the bulb now, and will it flower again in December?

I doubt it will flower again at Christmas – and if it does, nip it in the bud, 
so to speak, because it will exhaust itself. I imagine that after you put the 
bulb out, it got wet in late spring (when we had lots of rain), grew healthy 
leaves over the summer and in midsummer decided to go dormant, which has to 
happen before it flowers. It was cool and dry for much of midsummer. In its 
natural habitat, amaryllis (aka hippeastrum) needs a cool, dry winter between 
4-13C – which sort of describes July and early August. Then our late warm 
summer will have confused it into thinking it had gone through winter.

Ask Alys Fowler: how do I raise the canopy of my mature holly tree?

Treat it as you would if it had flowered in later winter, by letting the 
leaves die back and reducing watering until it goes dormant. The dormant period 
needs to last about two months, during which the plant should receive no water; 
it also helps if it’s dark. When new leaves appear, start a steady programme of 
feeding: flowers are the result of large, healthy leaves.
