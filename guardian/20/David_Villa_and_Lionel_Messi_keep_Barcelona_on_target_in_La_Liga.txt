Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> beat Osasuna to 
remain on course for a third straight Spanish league title. The home side 
failed to sparkle but did enough to stretch their unbeaten league run to 31 
games thanks to goals in either half from David Villa and Lionel Messi.

The Spain striker Villa scored his 18th of the season and first in 12 games in 
the 24th minute, stabbing home Jeffrén Suárez's curled cross at the far post. 
Messi, who replaced Villa in the 58th minute, rolled home his 31st league goal 
with three minutes to play.

Barcelona remain eight points clear of Real Madrid, who thrashed Valencia 6-3 
earlier in the day

, with five games to play.

Like Madrid, Barcelona opted to field a less-than-full-strength team after 
Wednesday's Copa del Rey final. The Spanish rivals are playing four times in 18 
days and meet again on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League 
semi-final.

The Barcelona coach, Pep Guardiola, retained four players who started in 
midweek – Dani Alves, Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets and Villa. Andrés 
Iniesta and Xavi also entered in the second half but, until Messi sealed the 
victory, the three made little impact.
