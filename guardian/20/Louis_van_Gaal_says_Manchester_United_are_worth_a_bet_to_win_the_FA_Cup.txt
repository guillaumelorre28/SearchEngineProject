Louis van Gaal declared he was not a “casino man” but said Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> were worth betting on 
to win the FA Cup for a 12th time after beating Cambridge United 3-0 in the 
fourth-round replay at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

Goals from Juan Mata, Marcos Rojo – his first for the club – and James Wilson 
– his second of the season – put United through to meet Preston North End on 16 
February at Deepdale in the next round.

United last won the trophy 11 years ago but Van Gaal said: “We have a real 
chance now. Why? We are the highest-qualified team in theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> so our status is the highest 
clubso the possibility [is there]. People are maybe betting on us. I am not 
allowed to. I give you a tip.”

Asked if he would bet on United if he could, the manager said: “I am not a 
casino man. But of course I think the highest-qualified teams have more 
possibilities to win than lower-qualified teams that is why everyone is in 
favour of Cambridge tonight. But Arsenal is still in the Cup and also a very 
high competitor. Liverpool is also there and will fight [at] Bolton Wanderers 
tomorrow.”

Of Preston, whom United last played 43 years ago, the Dutchman said: “Preston 
beat a great cup fighter in Sheffied United. I heard from Ryan [Giggs] they are 
very good cup fighters and they beat them 3-1. So Preston is not a piece of 
cake.”
