February is a bitter month in Lewis in the Western Isles, and nowhere more so 
than on the moors which cover the centre of the island. The sleet is driven 
horizontally by the relentless wind which sweeps in from the Atlantic and 
across the low-lying ground of the north-west coast at Ghabhsainn (Galson).

For generations, these winter winds have been a trial for the crofting and 
fishing communities which are strung along the coastline. But now, the 
islanders increasingly recognise that the wind looks set to become their 
biggest asset, as a source of energy and money.

Ghabhsainn’s first turbine is now operational and next month work starts on 
two more which will be up and running by the summer after more than eight years 
of planning. “Last year, we made £380,000 gross from just the one turbine,” 
says Carola Bell, chair of the company set up by the community-owned Galson 
Estate Trust,Urras Energy Society <http://urrasenergy.moonfruit.com/>.

All the profits will be recycled back into the community of 2,000, and once 
all three turbines are in operation, it could amount to an income of nearly a 
million pounds a year. More than half of the Hebrides are now owned by the 
communities themselves after a wave of buy outs triggered by Scotland’s 2003 
land reform act. For islands which have historically been very poor with low 
wages, a high cost of living and the highest fuel poverty rate in the country 
(currently 73%) , this new income will be transformational.


Over on the east coast of Lewis at the village of Point, work is about to 
start onthe biggest community owned wind farm in the UK 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-29210947>. The Western 
Isles are one of the best places in Europe for wind power with turbines 
producing energy well above the average of 25% of the time. Islands such as 
Lewis, South Uist and Barra are poised on the verge of a dramatic turn of 
fortune, and it’s not just wind power. The potential for offshore wind and 
marine power is even bigger, with major research projects underway to identify 
the technology which can reap the power of the fierce Atlantic seas off these 
island coasts.

The islanders weren’t always so enthusiastic about wind power, admits Agnes 
Rennie, chair of the Galson Estate Trust.

Ten years ago, this was the area proposed for the biggest wind farm in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/04/windpower.renewableenergy>
. It would have involved 181 huge turbines each requiring concrete bases 20 ft 
deep, roads and cables, and would have destroyed a swathe of this rare peat 
moorland. It divided the island, winning the backing of the council but 11,000 
registered their objections beforeEdinburgh refused planning permission in 2008 
on environmental grounds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/21/windpower.renewableenergy>.

“It was a very difficult time in a small community like ours in which people 
held very strong and sometimes opposing views,” Agnes explains as we sit at her 
kitchen table and the wind whistles around her croft perched on the island’s 
north-west coast.


 It left a bitter aftertaste and the new project has had to work hard to 
rebuild people’s trust that windpower could serve the needs of the community 
rather than major commercial developers.

The three turbines will have a capacity of 2.7 megawatts, a tiny fraction of 
what had been planned in the big project, but the crucial difference for the 
community is that they will receive all the benefits.

“We didn’t want turbines between houses, or between houses and the sea or the 
moor. We wanted to use existing peat tracks so that we weren’t digging up 
virgin peat,” explained Carola. This sensitive approach has paid off, and when 
a community share ownership scheme was launched at the end of last year to 
finance the new turbines, it exceeded its target and raised over £600,000 from 
hundreds of investors on the island and beyond.


But there are two key factors which are slowing down the crucial progress of 
renewable energy in the Western Isles. The first is revealed by the story Agnes 
and Carola tell at the kitchen table: nearly nine years of a few community 
volunteers doggedly making their way through the complexity of grid 
negotiations, planning, environmental assessments and financing deals. There 
was support along the way from organisations such asCommunity Energy Scotland 
<http://www.communityenergyscotland.org.uk/> but the drive had to come from 
volunteers prepared to devote huge amounts of time to learning about very 
technical issues.


 It seems remarkable that despite the national commitments to renewables and 
despite the abundance of opportunity here, it all comes down to the tenacity of 
such community activists.

However, there is an even bigger constraint on the growth of renewables in the 
Western Isles.

The electricity grid was built on a system of power generation near major 
cities which branched out to supply peripheries such as the Hebrides. That 
system now needs to be reversed so that the peripheries can feed renewable 
energy back to the urban centres, explains John Cunningham, head of renewables 
at the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the Western Isles council in Stornoway.

The cost of the subsea interconnector cable needed from Lewis back to 
Inverness has been put at £7.8bn. Late last yearthe utility company GDF Suez 
pulled out <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-29456832> 
in yet another blow to the long running negotiations with the local energy 
company SSE, Edinburgh and London. It has repeatedly been set back and now 
looks unlikely before 2019.

Dozens of wind projects on Lewis which have received planning are now in 
limbo, waiting until the interconnector is confirmed, says Joe Macphee, head of 
economic development at the council. Other community projects in the pipeline 
will struggle to get wind power projects off the ground.

Existing projects have to effectively take turns to export to the grid; 
turbines are forced to shut down to avoid overloading the system. “It’s deeply 
frustrating. We’re at an impasse.”
