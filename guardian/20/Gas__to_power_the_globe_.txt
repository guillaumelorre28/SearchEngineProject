Global gas reserves are so great that it will be the fuel of the next century, 
replacing coal and oil as the main source of power, the conference heard.

 Peter Odell, professor emeritus of international energy studies at Erasmus 
university, Rotterdam, said the belief that fossil fuels would run out or be 
replaced by renewable energy was wrong.

In a paper for the International Atomic Energy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Agency, which saw no hope of a 
nuclear power revival for 50 years, he said reserves of gas had been 
underestimated.

 Worldwide consumption of gas is 1 billion tonnes a year. There are already 
proven reserves of 140 billion tonnes, with 200 to 300 billion tonnes still to 
be discovered.

 Gas supply will expand until 2090, when output will be 5.5 times current 
levels. Although UK reserves will run out, said Mr Odell, elsewhere gas is only 
just being exploited. Pipelines from Norway, Russia and North Africa could 
supply Europe.

 Within a few years gas will overtake coal as a major energy supplier, and 
overhaul oil by 2020. Oil would be left in the ground like coal is now.

 He rejected the argument that fears of global warming would make much 
difference to his estimates. Although renewable energies would become more 
important, the big users - the USA, China, Russia, India and Brazil - were 
expected to increase demand for fossil fuels.

 "Small countries like Denmark and the UK have made substantial cuts to try 
and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But in one day China creates as much 
carbon dioxide as dear little Denmark saves in a year," he said.
