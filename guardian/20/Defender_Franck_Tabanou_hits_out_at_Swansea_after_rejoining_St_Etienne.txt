The former France Under-21 international has made only three appearances – all 
in cup competitions – and told the French newspaper L’Equipe of his 
frustrations as he headed home.

“I had gone to Swansea to get to the next level, to get my foot in the Premier 
League and to then go higher,” Tabanou said. “Unfortunately it didn’t happen 
the way I wanted. They did not give me my chance. I do not understand.

“And I think, if I had stayed, my situation wouldn’t have changed. The club is 
in a terrible situation and, despite that, they never let me play.

“Tactically they are not at the top. They have their players, they will fight 
until the last minute. This is not the way I play. I might have been able to 
make more effort but I also expect an effort from them.”
