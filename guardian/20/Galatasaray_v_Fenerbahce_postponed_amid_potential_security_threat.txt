, and wounded dozens more, in an attack on Istanbul’s most popular shopping

Two Israelis with dual US nationality and an Iranian were killed in the blast

governor’s office on Istiklal Street, a pedestrian boulevard lined with 
international stores and restaurants.

Turkey’s health minister, Mehmet Müezzinoglu, said 12 of the 36 injured were 
foreigners. Six were Israelis, two were Irish and the four others were from 
Germany, Iceland, Iran and Dubai.
