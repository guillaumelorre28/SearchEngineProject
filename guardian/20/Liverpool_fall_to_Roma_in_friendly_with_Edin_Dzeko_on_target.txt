There was a further blow to Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> when they lost Alberto Moreno 
late on to an injury though their manager Jürgen Klopp allayed fears of a 
lengthy lay-off.

He told the club’s official website: “He is OK, it’s a dead leg in the 
hamstring. He couldn’t activate the muscle so you cannot play. That’s how it 
is.”

Klopp had named a strong side, with starts for Sadio Mané, Georginio Wijnaldum 
and Daniel Sturridge, but it was Roma who started the International Champions 
Cup match better.

The former Manchester City striker Dzeko had already missed two good chances 
when he fired into the bottom corner after a fine turn just before the 
half-hour mark. The Reds were level before the break, though, when Ojo headed 
home from James Milner’s corner.

The decisive moment came just after the hour when Salah restored Roma’s lead 
as he poked home after Simon Mignolet had saved Dzeko’s header.

Klopp told the Liverpool website 
<http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/2016-tour/230073-klopp-on-roma-defeat-moreno-injury-and-us-tour>
: “It was obviously not our best game but games like this can happen. We 
weren’t compact in the first half and had too big spaces between the positions, 
so nearly every offensive action of Roma was a chance. It makes no sense.

“On the other hand, we had a lot of good chances too so it could have been 6-5 
to either side at half-time. That may be exciting but is of course not what I 
want.”

Liverpool now return home to play Barcelona at Wembley on Saturday.
