So it’s off to Austin, Texas for the US Grand Prix on 23 October with Rosberg 
pulling away towards the title. It would take a miracle for Hamilton from here, 
but in the zany world of F1 you never know.

We’re not expecting any touring Australians to drop their pants in pit lane 
this week, so that’s it for us. Thanks for your time today, especially if you 
were tuning in from a pre-breakfast Europe. Keep an eye on The Guardian’sF1 
coverage <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> in the lead-up to 
Austin and in two weeks we’ll know more about the future destination of the 
title.

For the second year in a row all the starters have finished 
<https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/features/2016/4/the-rare-occasions-every-car-was-a-finisher.html>
 at Japan. For a track that has had its fair share of drama over the years 
Suzuka has been a mechanic’s dream.

It’s also the first season in history where more than one race has seen all 
cars finish.

Rosberg WINS!

Lap 53 - Nico Rosberg wins the 2016 Japanese F1 Grand Prix. He led from the 
start and was never headed. He’s now got one hand on the championship.

Still, Lewis isn’t vanquished just yet. After that horror start he fought back 
to third and minimised the damage in the points race. For the third year in a 
row Mercedes are the Constructors’ champions.

Lap 52 - Hamilton goes for it! But when he can’t pass Verstappen he has to go 
straight down the exit road and rejoin the track.

The penultimate lap is complete and Rosberg has got this race won unless 
something odd happens. Not sure my claims that we we were set for a weird and 
wonderful GP have entirely come true, but there’s certainly been some 
interesting moments.

doesn’t happen to the leader. It’s nearly six seconds for Rosberg now, while 
Verstappen continues to defend solidly to retain second.

Lap 48 - Rosberg’s lead is safe, while Hamilton gets a little bit closer to 
Verstappen but still can’t get close enough to have a go. They’re both reaching 
traffic, so the way this race has gone that will probably end in controversy.

Lap 47 - As it stands Mercedes have got the Constructors’ title won. Why not 
ask Lewis for his thoughts in the press conference and see what happens?

The gap between Rosberg and Verstappen is 4.9 seconds, and a further 0.5 to 
Hamilton in third. Vettel has over seven seconds on either side of him in 
fourth.

Lap 46 - Raikkonen joins in the great backmarker debate. I guess that’s why 
they call it the blues etc...

Hamilton has another look at Verstappen on the straight but can’t get close 
enough to have a go. The gap to the leader down to 4.8 seconds as Max pushes to 
stay in front of Lewis.

Lap 43 - Now it’s Hamilton’s turn to have trouble passing, being held up

Lap 42 - Hamilton is within two seconds of Verstappen now, while Max continues 
to be aggrieved by a perceived lack of blue flag etiquette. He better start 
looking behind him instead, Lewis is on the charge.

Lap 41 - Now Verstappen is joining in the anti-backmarker sentiment, 
describing the blue flag situation as a “joke”. He’s dropped to 6.4 seconds 
behind Rosberg now.

Bottas currently the last man in the points, 0.9 in front of Grosjean.

dismissed as he’s added 1.3 seconds to his lead on that lap. Hamilton continues 
to lead Vettel by 1.5 seconds, and Lewis is now within four seconds of

Lap 36 - Vettel is having a look at Hamilton with the soft tyres. He’s less 
than half a second behind but isn’t close enough to pass Lewis on the straight. 
Rosberg is still 5.5 seconds in front of Verstappen.

Lap 34 - Hamilton comes out 1.8 seconds in front of Raikkonen, and by the end 
of the lap he’s almost 2.5 up on him. I wouldn’t want to be the first person to 
ask him a question at the press conference, but his championship hopes are 
still alive. Vettel puts on soft tyres but loses position to Hamilton.

Lap 33 - Pit disaster for Daniel Ricciardo, who loses three seconds as the 
wheel wouldn’t come off. He exits in sixth while Vettel continues to hold the 
lead, and Hamilton ducks into the pit for hard tyres.

Lap 32 - Rosberg is five seconds in front of Verstappen in the proxy battle 
for the lead.

Meanwhile it’s disappointing that the Ferrari Twitterist didn’t go with an 
additional #redrage headline here.

Lap 31 - The Vettel vs Hamilton battle at the front will most likely turn into 
the race for 3rd or 4th, and Lewis is doing a much better job of it at the 
moment as he cuts the gap to just over four seconds.

seconds to Hamilton and 10.5 to Rosberg.

Lap 22 - Ricciardo and Raikkonen are battling for 5th, the Aussie is 1.3 
seconds in front. With Rosberg pulling away to more than four seconds in the 
lead our only hope for drama might be the battles in the lower half of the 
points positions.

Hamilton's troubles continue as Rosberg wins Japanese F1 Grand Prix
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/hamiltons-troubles-continue-as-rosberg-wins-japanese-f1-grand-prix> 
So it’s off to Austin, Texas for the US Grand Prix on 23 October with Rosberg 
pulling away towards the title. It would take a miracle for Hamilton from here, 
but in the zany world of F1 you never know.

We’re not expecting any touring Australians to drop their pants in pit lane 
this week, so that’s it for us. Thanks for your time today, especially if you 
were tuning in from a pre-breakfast Europe. Keep an eye on The Guardian’sF1 
coverage <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> in the lead-up to 
Austin and in two weeks we’ll know more about the future destination of the 
title.
 
Happy then?

For the second year in a row all the starters have finished 
<https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/features/2016/4/the-rare-occasions-every-car-was-a-finisher.html>
 at Japan. For a track that has had its fair share of drama over the years 
Suzuka has been a mechanic’s dream.

It’s also the first season in history where more than one race has seen all 
cars finish.
 
Lap 53 - Nico Rosberg wins the 2016 Japanese F1 Grand Prix. He led from the 
start and was never headed. He’s now got one hand on the championship.

Still, Lewis isn’t vanquished just yet. After that horror start he fought back 
to third and minimised the damage in the points race. For the third year in a 
row Mercedes are the Constructors’ champions.
 
Lap 52 - Hamilton goes for it! But when he can’t pass Verstappen he has to go 
straight down the exit road and rejoin the track.

The penultimate lap is complete and Rosberg has got this race won unless 
something odd happens. Not sure my claims that we we were set for a weird and 
wonderful GP have entirely come true, but there’s certainly been some 
interesting moments.
 
Lap 51 - Mercedes are hopeful of late drama. Let’s hope for their sake it 
doesn’t happen to the leader. It’s nearly six seconds for Rosberg now, while 
Verstappen continues to defend solidly to retain second.

<https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/785003507724259328>  
Lap 50 - Late drama notwithstanding Rosberg has got this won. He’s nearly six 
seconds in front, while Hamilton is sitting almost a second behind third.

Bottas is holding onto the last points position, 0.6 seconds in front of 
Grosjean as the last two men on the lead lap.
 
Lap 49 - Verstappen and Hamilton both get past Jolyon Palmer, who helped by 
locking up when he saw them in his mirrors. The gap at the front of is six 
seconds, and 0.8 between second and third.
 
Lap 48 - Rosberg’s lead is safe, while Hamilton gets a little bit closer to 
Verstappen but still can’t get close enough to have a go. They’re both reaching 
traffic, so the way this race has gone that will probably end in controversy.
 
Lap 47 - As it stands Mercedes have got the Constructors’ title won. Why not 
ask Lewis for his thoughts in the press conference and see what happens?

The gap between Rosberg and Verstappen is 4.9 seconds, and a further 0.5 to 
Hamilton in third. Vettel has over seven seconds on either side of him in 
fourth.
 
Lap 46 - Raikkonen joins in the great backmarker debate. I guess that’s why 
they call it the blues etc...

Hamilton has another look at Verstappen on the straight but can’t get close 
enough to have a go. The gap to the leader down to 4.8 seconds as Max pushes to 
stay in front of Lewis.
 
Lap 45 - Rosberg holds a 5.2 second lead at the top, while Hamilton continues 
to attack Verstappen for second place.
 
Lap 44 - Is that a genuine thanks or a veiled threat? It might be on between 
the social media teams. The gap between Verstappen and Hamilton is now one 
second. Here comes Lewis.
MERCEDES AMG F1 (@MercedesAMGF1) 
Thanks for shifting Mr @RenaultSportF1 <https://twitter.com/RenaultSportF1>..

<https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/785000477117280257>  
Lap 43 - Now it’s Hamilton’s turn to have trouble passing, being held up 
behind Palmer’s Renault. He’s 2.1 seconds behind Verstappen but with a clear 
track between them now.
 
Lap 42 - Hamilton is within two seconds of Verstappen now, while Max continues 
to be aggrieved by a perceived lack of blue flag etiquette. He better start 
looking behind him instead, Lewis is on the charge.
 
Lap 41 - Now Verstappen is joining in the anti-backmarker sentiment, 
describing the blue flag situation as a “joke”. He’s dropped to 6.4 seconds 
behind Rosberg now.

Bottas currently the last man in the points, 0.9 in front of Grosjean.
 
Lap 40 - Any suggestion that Rosberg could be caught has seemingly been 
dismissed as he’s added 1.3 seconds to his lead on that lap. Hamilton continues 
to lead Vettel by 1.5 seconds, and Lewis is now within four seconds of 
Verstappen.
 
Lap 39 - The lead is narrowing at the front, Verstappen is now just 4.2 
seconds behind Rosberg. Hamilton has pulled away to 1.6 seconds in front of 
Vettel.
 
Lap 38 - The gap at the front is 4.5, while in the battle for third Hamilton 
has started to pull away from Vettel as they each contend with the backmarkers. 
Seb has managed to keep calm this time.
 
Lap 37 - Hamilton’s going about a second a lap better than Rosberg. He and 
Vettel are gaining on Verstappen.

We’ve still got all our starters. Wehrlein remains the last man on track.
 
Lap 36 - Vettel is having a look at Hamilton with the soft tyres. He’s less 
than half a second behind but isn’t close enough to pass Lewis on the straight. 
Rosberg is still 5.5 seconds in front of Verstappen.
 
Lap 35 - Our top 10:

1 - Rosberg
2 - Verstappen
3 - Hamilton
4 - Vettel
5 - Raikkonen
6 - Ricciardo
7 - Perez
8 - Hulkenberg
9 - Massa
10 - Bottas
 
Lap 34 - Hamilton comes out 1.8 seconds in front of Raikkonen, and by the end 
of the lap he’s almost 2.5 up on him. I wouldn’t want to be the first person to 
ask him a question at the press conference, but his championship hopes are 
still alive. Vettel puts on soft tyres but loses position to Hamilton.
 
Lap 33 - Pit disaster for Daniel Ricciardo, who loses three seconds as the 
wheel wouldn’t come off. He exits in sixth while Vettel continues to hold the 
lead, and Hamilton ducks into the pit for hard tyres.
 
Lap 32 - Rosberg is five seconds in front of Verstappen in the proxy battle 
for the lead.

Meanwhile it’s disappointing that the Ferrari Twitterist didn’t go with an 
additional #redrage headline here.

Lap 31 - The Vettel vs Hamilton battle at the front will most likely turn into 
the race for 3rd or 4th, and Lewis is doing a much better job of it at the 
moment as he cuts the gap to just over four seconds.
 
Lap 30 - Vettel is having bad times with the back of the field, losing a 
second trying to overtake and waving his arm around in anger. The gap is 5.3 
seconds to Hamilton and 10.5 to Rosberg.
 
Lap 29 - Rosberg is into the pits, allowing Vettel to grab the lead. We still 
haven’t lost any runners, but not for want of trying by the numerous drivers 
who have had lock-ups or taken off-road excursions.
 
Lap 28 - Rosberg extends his lead to 6.5 seconds as Verstappen has trouble 
getting through traffic. Max is in to the pits now, just as Vettel was starting 
to get close.
 
Lap 27 - Carlos Sainz runs off the track in a battle for 10th with Alonso but 
survives unscathed. Bottas finally pitted only for a delayed stop to leave him 
in 13th.
 
Lap 26 - Not a great deal of change at the front, with Verstappen now 4.6 
seconds behind. Bottas remains the only man in the points who hasn’t pitted in 
ninth. Raikkonen comes into the pits for hard tyres.
 
Lap 25 - Rosberg’s gap is approaching five seconds now, while Ricciardo vs 
Raikkonen is now within half a second in the race for fifth place.
 
Lap 24 - Vettel is slowing gaining on Verstappen, and he’s running roughly the 
same times as Rosberg. Hamilton’s still 11 seconds behind them in fourth.
 
Lap 23 - Vettel’s now 2.5 seconds behind Verstappen and looming in the Red 
Bull’s mirrors. It’s now 4.4 seconds in the battle for first.
 
Lap 22 - Ricciardo and Raikkonen are battling for 5th, the Aussie is 1.3 
seconds in front. With Rosberg pulling away to more than four seconds in the 
lead our only hope for drama might be the battles in the lower half of the 
points positions.
 
Lap 21 - The Williams cars are the only top 10 runners who haven’t pitted yet. 
Bottas is ninth and Massa 10th. Hamilton remains in fourth, 12.2 seconds behind 
Vettel for third.
 
Lap 20 - The gap is four seconds, and down the other end of the field 
Gutierrez is almost the first man to leave the race after spinning but he’s 
recovered and sits 19th.
