were forced to park the bus for once – after it appeared to run out of fuel.

A local resident tweeted a photograph of the team coach parked up in Bremen 
this morning – with two tracksuited staff members filling up the tank.

Bayern were on their way to the Weserstadion, just a five-minute drive away 
from where the bus had stopped on Neuerlander Strasse, to play mid-tableWerder 
Bremen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen>.

In response to the tweet, Bayern’s official account responded somewhat 
ambiguously, claiming “our tank was full” but that they lacked the “special 
mixture” needed for the match.

The runaway Bundesliga leaders arrived on time for the match, which saw Manuel 
Neuer restedafter the midweek victory over Shakhtar Donetsk

, with Jose Reina starting his first league game in his place.

Bayern’s social media team had coincidentally posted a picture of the team bus 
two hours before, saying “the FC Bayern bus will be waiting ... good morning, 
Bremen!”
