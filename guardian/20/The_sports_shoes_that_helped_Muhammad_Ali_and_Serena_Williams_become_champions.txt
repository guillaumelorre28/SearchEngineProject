The renown of sports shoes long outlives that of the sports stars who made 
them famous. Sneakers – the ones that stick – become legendary in their own 
right and leave their first adopters far behind. Who really thinks ofFred Perry 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMcV9EoHeqU> when they see a pair of Dunlop 
Green Flashes – which, incidentally, were much less green when Perry first wore 
them? Or of Chuck Taylor when they see a pair of Converse All Stars, ubiquitous 
47 years after the basketball player’s death?

Surprisingly, this disassociation holds even when a shoe carries a star’s name,
such as Stan Smiths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2014/jan/12/stan-smith-tennis-adidas-trainer>
, which have sold more than 40m pairs since their launch and are infinitely 
more recognisable than the American tennis player. (Now 69, Smith says that 
many people don’t realise he is a person, not a shoe.)

<http://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jason-coles> provides a correction to this 
uncoupling of sneakers from the stars who gave them life. Along with potted

pictures of the very models worn by their first owners.

 Nottinghamshire shoemakers JW Foster & Sons pioneered the use of spikes, 
initially on the cricket pitch. By 1898, these soft leather shoes had 
transferred to the running track. Harold Abrahams wore a pair to win gold at

’s Specials, handmade for him by Adidas’s Adi Dassler at a time when his 
high-jump flop technique was still frowned upon by the athletics establishment. 
You can see the stitches between the upper and the sole, the pressure points 
where the shoe had to give, the impressions of his toes in the puckered suede.

Some of these shoes have helped to shape style, some have revolutionised sport 
and some have done both. Stan Smiths, which thrive now precisely because they 
look so untechnical, were innovative when they first appeared in 1963, being 
made of leather when most tennis shoes were canvas.

’s gold Nike running spikes might communicate the sort of swagger for which the 
sprinter was known, but photographed here it is their suppleness that really 
strikes; each shoe weighs only 85g (3oz) and the soft wrinkles of the leather 
cave inwards, as if searching for Johnson’s feet. They really did help him to 
gold in the 1996 Olympics, but only after Nike’s technicians studied hours of 
footage of him running, as a result of which the left and right shoes differed 
to accommodate the distinct movement of each foot. Then, as now, sports design 
was all about the margins.

In this context, the odd lo-fi shoe, such as the Asics slip of suede worn by 
US gymnast Kerri Strug 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/23/its-been-20-years-since-kerri-strug-landed-her-gold-medal-winning-olympic-vault/>
 the same year Johnson wore his gold Zytels, seems anachronistic.

paid a standard company salary. And Fosbury was so touched that Dassler had 
troubled to make him a pair of his own shoes that he declined payment.
