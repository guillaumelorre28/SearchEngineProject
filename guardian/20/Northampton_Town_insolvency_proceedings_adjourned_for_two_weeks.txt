The authority, which loaned money for a stadium development, says the club 
owes more than £10m.

Its counsel, James Morgan, said that HM Revenue & Customs, which was owed more 
than £160,000 and was due in court on Monday to apply for the club to be wound 
up

, had confirmed that its petition would be dismissed as payment was made in 
full on Thursday.

The former Oxford United chairman Kelvin Thomas took over the club from David 
Cardoza on the same day.

Morgan added that agreement with the council, which was the only remaining 
substantial creditor, would be the next stage in an ongoing process to save the 
club.

Thomas Talbot-Ponsonby, for the club, said that it fully supported the 
adjournment in the hope that the rescue package would go ahead.

The judge approved the adjournment as “very sensible”.
