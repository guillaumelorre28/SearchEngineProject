Middlesbrough’s push for promotion from the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> stuttered as Rotherham beat 
them 1-0 with a late goal to do their survival hopes the world of good.

Boro, who had won three of their last four games, wasted several chances in 
the first half, with David Nugent and Gastón Ramírez the guilty parties, and 
were left to rue them when the midfielder Lee Frecklington scored an unlikely 
winner two minutes from time.

The victory was Rotherham’s third in a row and leaves them still in the 
relegation places, a point behind MK Dons in 21st place, having held on for the 
final few minutes with 10 men after Greg Halford was dismissed.

Neil Warnock believes keeping Rotherham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rotherham> up would be his biggest 
achievement in football by “an absolute mile”.

“Only when you look at the squad and where we were when I came in,” Warnock 
said. “We are still in the bottom three after three wins, that shows how far 
away we were.

“Everybody knows we were dead and gone, we might still be dead and gone but at 
least we’ve got a chance.

“It’s a great win for us, we have to scrap for everything, the extra two 
points are a bonus but we kept fighting until the end.”.

Aitor Karanka was also sure where this game was lost for his Middlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> side as they failed to put 
Rotherham to the sword in the first half.

“We should have won by 4-0 or 5-0 and we have lost three points,” Karanka 
said. “Had we scored the game would have been completely different.

“But we didn’t score and we lost the game because we didn’t play in the second 
half the way we needed to play. We are second in the table, we have a really 
good squad, so I am not concerned.”
