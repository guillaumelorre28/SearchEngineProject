Dynamo Kyiv’s Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> match with Guingamp 
had to be halted 15 minutes from the end because of crowd trouble.

The home side were 2-0 up and heading into the last 16 3-2 on aggregate when a 
group of masked fans fought their way past stewards in a bid to attack 
supporters of the tiny French club.

The referee suspended the match and the away fans were forced to leave the 
stadium, before a number of Kyiv supporters began fighting among themselves.

The Kyiv goalkeeper, Oleksandr Shovkovskiy, went into the crowd to try to 
persuade them to halt the violence, but ended up trying to separate brawling 
fans and protect a steward who had been knocked to the floor.

The match was eventually restarted 15 minutes later and ended 3-1, Dynamo 
progressing 4-3 on aggregate.

The Guingamp president, Bernard Desplat, reportedly told RMC: “I saw a stadium 
at war with rabid dogs that wanted to fight. There were 11 heroes inGuingamp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/guingamp> colours on the field because 
organising a match in these security conditions, when the safety of a certain 
group is not assured, is catastrophic for football.

“These are not fans, they are militiamen. Restarting play? How do you expect 
the players to focus on their game? It was extremely dangerous. This match 
could only have happened in Ukraine under these conditions.”
