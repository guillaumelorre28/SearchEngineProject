Di María put the hosts ahead five minutes before the break, Lucas made it 2-0 
in the second half and Cavani’s last-gasp penalty rounded it off to put PSG on 
seven points after three games, second in the group on goal difference behind

. Basel, who struck the woodwork three times at the Parc des Princes, are third 
on one point ahead of Ludogorets on goal difference.

The reverse games will be played on 1 November when PSG, who were under-par 
for much of the game on Wednesday, will need to raise their performance level 
if they want to stay in contention for top spot.

Adrien Rabiot stood out for PSG but most of the midfielder’s team-mates failed 
to impress and things could have turned sour for Unai Emery’s side hadBasel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> been more clinical.

The French side got off to a shaky start and the visitors came close to 
opening the scoring in the fifth minute when Michael Lang’s header struck the 
bar.

Basel hit the woodwork again in the 36th minute, this time through Seydou 
Doumbia, whose header crashed against Alphonse Areola’s left-hand post.

PSG did improve, however, and five minutes before the interval Blaise 
Matuidi’s low cross was poked by Cavani into the path of Di María, who fired a 
right-footed shot into the net from close range. It was then PSG’s turn to hit 
the woodwork as Cavani’s header struck the post three minutes into the second 
half.

The Uruguay striker had a huge opportunity to double the advantage shortly 
after the hour but he was denied by Tomas Vaclik. The Basel keeper, however, 
could do nothing to prevent Lucas pouncing on a poor clearance to find the back 
of the net in the 62nd minute.

Marek Suchy’s header then struck Areola’s right-hand post as the Swiss side 
continued to be plagued by bad luck and their misery was completed when Cavani 
was brought down by Lang and converted the resulting penalty three minutes into 
stoppage time.

Elsewhere, Vincent Aboubakar scored twice, including an 86th-minute winner, to 
giveBesiktas a shock 3-2 victory at Napoli in Group B after the hosts had twice 
come from behind and missed a penalty along the way. Napoli’s defence was at 
fault for all threeBesiktas <https://www.theguardian.com/football/besiktas> 
goals as the Serie A side slumped to a third successive defeat in all 
competitions and lost an 18-match unbeaten home record in Europe.

Napoli would have become the first team in Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> history to qualify from 
the group stage with three matches to spare if they had won and the other 
match, betweenDynamo Kyiv and Benfica, had been drawn. Instead, they remained 
on six points and are now just one ahead of Benfica and Besiktas with half the 
group still to play.

In Group D, Bayern Munich crushed the Dutch side PSV Eindhoven 4-1 to bounce 
back after three games without a win in all competitions and take a big step 
towards the last 16.

What had started as a walk in the park with Bayern riding roughshod over the 
Dutch side with goals from Thomas Müller and Joshua Kimmich turned into a 
nervous affair after PSV pulled a goal back through Luciano Narsingh before 
half-time.

The German champions, however, kept their cool and Robert Lewandowski headed 
in the third goal on the hour. Arjen Robben made sure of the three points, 
converting an 84th-minute header against his former team.

Atlético Madrid laboured to a 1-0 win over Rostov to maintain their 100% 
record. The impressive Yannick Carrasco scored the only goal in the second half 
to hand Rostov their first home defeat in 26 games.
