Full-time! Malaga 1-1 Real Madrid

That’s your lot. Malaga will probably be more disappointed with that result. 
They were the better team, had more chances and Real were quite awful. Zidane’s 
team climb above Atletico before their game later this evening into second but 
are nine points behind Barcelona with 13 games to play. Malaga sit in 10th. I 
will be back for Villarreal v Atletico in a couple of hours. Until then, enjoy 
life and thanks for reading!

84 min: Modric is furious. He feels he should have a penalty after being taken 
down in the area by Torres but the referee motions for play to continue. It 
should have been a penalty. There was certain contact. One of those “anywhere 
else on the pitch and it’s a free-kick” moments.

Weligton recovers well to put the striker off and put him off sufficiently. The

76 min: Another glorious opportunity for Malaga! Rosares crosses from the 
right, Charles gets in front of Nacho but the striker’s header is brilliantly 
saved by Navas. The subsequent corner is put out for another one by Ramos. The 
second corner results in a goal-kick, but Malaga should have this game put

Goal! Malaga 1-1 Real Madrid (Albentosa)

67 min: After their strikers wasted so many chances, the centre-half strikes 
home! Weligton crossed it from the left and the least likely of goalscorers 
arrived at the back-post, evading Marcelo’s radar, to hit a right-footed 
half-volley past Navas. It is well deserved.

55 min: Camacho is the latest to be shown a yellow card, which means he will 
miss the game against Sociedad next weekend. He planted his studs on Marcelo’s 
achilles. It was a needless challenge but a deserved booking.

53 min: Juanpi has been wonderful. He rapidly dribbles past Kovacic, who 
cynically hauls the Malaga player down on the right. Juanpi takes the set play 
himself but Kroos clears.

52 min: Albentosa hits the deck after a tiny shove from Ronaldo. What an 
embarrassment from the Malaga defender, who sinks to the ground as if he had 
been mortally wounded.

50 min: Malaga are almost level. Horta crosses from the left, Nacho deflects 
it awkwardly but Navas saves it from being an own goal. The hosts have a 
corner, but it amounts to nothing.

49 min: Anyway, there has been a prosaic start to the second half here. It 
will be interesting to see if Malaga grow tired as the game progresses. Their 
intensity was something to behold in that opening period.

There has been drama in the Bundesliga, in case you were interested. Dortmund 
scored a contentious goal against Leverkusen, whose players protested angrily. 
The referee has stormed off down the tunnel!

An email from JR in Illinois

We’ve got Ray Hudson announcing this one. He’s saying all of his usual silly 
stuff which often makes me laugh but he’s got one particular thing he often 
says which is really weird even by his standards. He repeatedly calls Cristiano 
Ronaldo “the dark invader”. I have no idea where or why he came up with that 
but it gives me the creeps.

I might just refer to him as that for the second half.

Dacre ponders the omission of a certain Colombian

Why does James Rodriguez not play so much anymore? Last season he was one of 
Real Madrid’s best players and he still is. However, Zidane does not use him 
very much.Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are 
missing his creative ability.

He was also out of favour during Benitez’s latter days in charge.

And Nick Parmenter adds

Do you reckon Zidane’s tactics are pretty much, just go out and play?? Seems a 
little pointless trying to over complicate the game?

It’s probably more down to his team being individuals rather than a team.

Half-time: Malaga 0-1 Real Madrid

And that’s the break. Malaga have had the best chances but find themselves a 
goal down due to Ronaldo’s 33rd minute header, which should have been 
disallowed for offside. He also had a penalty saved two minutes later. Stay 
tuned, it’s a belter.

45 min: Ronaldo is played in by a scrumptious through ball from Carvajal but 
is flagged for offside. This time the call is correct.

43 min: It’s cleared, but only as far as Kroos, who sends in another cross. 
Weligton gets rid this time, allowing Malaga to break. Juanpi is in a good 
position again but is incorrectly flagged for offside. Marcelo was playing him 
onside.

39 min: Yes, they can. Juanpi cuts the Real defence apart again. He feeds Cop, 
whose scuffed effort is denied by a right-foot stop from Navas, the ball 
looping up for Ramos to then head over the bar for a corner, which amounts to 
nothing.

That’s your lot. Malaga will probably be more disappointed with that result. 
They were the better team, had more chances and Real were quite awful. Zidane’s 
team climb above Atletico before their game later this evening into second but 
are nine points behind Barcelona with 13 games to play. Malaga sit in 10th. I 
will be back for Villarreal v Atletico in a couple of hours. Until then, enjoy 
life and thanks for reading!
 Zidane, not impressed. Photograph: Jorge Zapata/EPA  
90 min +4: Real come again, but Ramos is penalised for a foul of Albentosa 
when attempting to head goalswards.
 
90 min +3: Marcelo sends in another cross. It’s mis-hit but reaches Rodriguez 
who volleys straight at Kameni.
 
90 min +1: Marcelo, one of Real’s best players today, needlessly fouls Camacho 
in a dangerous position. Navas claims the free-kick. Real break through Ronaldo 
and then Marcelo but his cross towards Vazquez is cut out.
 
90 min: There will be four minutes added on! Marcelo crosses from the left. 
Kameni is out to catch.
 
90 min: Kameni is booked for time wasting. On Sky, meanwhile, David Phillips 
wonders why Duda is on. “Does he have something in his contract that means he 
has to play?” Err …
 
89 min: Rodriguez is whistled for offside. Malaga make their final change. 
Juanpi is off to a standing ovation – what a talent this 22-year-old is! – and 
Duda is on in his place.
 
87 min: Rodriguez wins a corner, his cross knocked out by the head of Torres. 
The Real player takes it, but it’s headed away by Charles. These final minutes 
could be a siege.
 
86 min: Another break in play as Weligton needs attention for a head injury 
after colliding with his defensive colleague and Malaga’s unlikely goalscorer 
Albentosa.
 
84 min: Modric is furious. He feels he should have a penalty after being taken 
down in the area by Torres but the referee motions for play to continue. It 
should have been a penalty. There was certain contact. One of those “anywhere 
else on the pitch and it’s a free-kick” moments.
 
83 min: A break in play as Juanpi receives some attention after a tough but 
fair challenge from Kroos.
 
80 min: Malaga’s second switch sees Cop hauled off for Santa Cruz. Cop worked 
hard and was impressive in general play but his finishing was poor.
 
79 min: Ronaldo gets a sight of goal after a sweet Modric through ball but 
Weligton recovers well to put the striker off and put him off sufficiently. The 
shot zips harmlessly wide.
 
78 min: Rodriguez tries to find Ronaldo with a diagonal pass from the left but 
Kameni comes out to save.
 
76 min: Another glorious opportunity for Malaga! Rosares crosses from the 
right, Charles gets in front of Nacho but the striker’s header is brilliantly 
saved by Navas. The subsequent corner is put out for another one by Ramos. The 
second corner results in a goal-kick, but Malaga should have this game put 
beyond doubt by now.
 
75 min: It’s Rodriguez time! He is on for Isco, who departs to a standing 
ovation from the Malaga support, being a former player and all.
 
74 min: Real are putting the squeeze on now but that could then leave them 
culpable on the break. Malaga still look to have plenty of energy.
 
72 min: Marcelo flashes a cross-cum-shot across goal towards Isco, who cannot 
reach it. Malaga have a goal-kick.
 
71 min: Modric is booked for entering a challenge with Camacho with his right 
boot four foot off the ground.
 
70 min: Isco is played in by Kovacic and finds the net but he is flagged off 
after Rosales cleverly steps up.
 
68 min: How can Real respond to being pulled back level? They have been so 
poor.
 
67 min: After their strikers wasted so many chances, the centre-half strikes 
home! Weligton crossed it from the left and the least likely of goalscorers 
arrived at the back-post, evading Marcelo’s radar, to hit a right-footed 
half-volley past Navas. It is well deserved.
 
66 min: And Fornals’ first involvement is a right-footed effort that heads for 
goal but Ramos is there to stretch a leg out and deflect away for a corner.
 
63 min: Real are trying to kill Malaga’s momentum now, passing the ball calmly 
around the back. When they finally attack, Isco heads wide. And that sees 
Malaga make their first change, Fornals comes on for Horta.
 
62 min: Juanpi after a neat interchange with Charles tries an audacious chip 
but Navas saves.
 
61 min: Zidane think it is time to freshen things up. Jese is replaced by 
Vazquez.
 
59 min: Another glorious chance spurned by Malaga. Cop chops over with a 
rebounded effort after Juanmi’s initial attempt was blocked by Nacho.
 
57 min: Rosales gets the better of Ronaldo, who loses control after a stepover 
too many, allowing Malaga to break. Juanpi – he is everywhere – picks out Cop 
but he is crowded out.
 
56 min: Ronaldo gets round Weligton without much bother but Kameni saves his 
long-range attempt convincingly.
 
55 min: Camacho is the latest to be shown a yellow card, which means he will 
miss the game against Sociedad next weekend. He planted his studs on Marcelo’s 
achilles. It was a needless challenge but a deserved booking.
 
53 min: Juanpi has been wonderful. He rapidly dribbles past Kovacic, who 
cynically hauls the Malaga player down on the right. Juanpi takes the set play 
himself but Kroos clears.
 
52 min: Albentosa hits the deck after a tiny shove from Ronaldo. What an 
embarrassment from the Malaga defender, who sinks to the ground as if he had 
been mortally wounded.

50 min: Malaga are almost level. Horta crosses from the left, Nacho deflects 
it awkwardly but Navas saves it from being an own goal. The hosts have a 
corner, but it amounts to nothing.
 
49 min: Anyway, there has been a prosaic start to the second half here. It 
will be interesting to see if Malaga grow tired as the game progresses. Their 
intensity was something to behold in that opening period.
 
There has been drama in the Bundesliga, in case you were interested. Dortmund

An email from JR in Illinois

We’ve got Ray Hudson announcing this one. He’s saying all of his usual silly 
stuff which often makes me laugh but he’s got one particular thing he often 
says which is really weird even by his standards. He repeatedly calls Cristiano 
Ronaldo “the dark invader”. I have no idea where or why he came up with that 
but it gives me the creeps.

I might just refer to him as that for the second half.

Dacre ponders the omission of a certain Colombian

Why does James Rodriguez not play so much anymore? Last season he was one of 
Real Madrid’s best players and he still is. However, Zidane does not use him 
very much.Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are 
missing his creative ability.

He was also out of favour during Benitez’s latter days in charge.

And Nick Parmenter adds

Do you reckon Zidane’s tactics are pretty much, just go out and play?? Seems a 
little pointless trying to over complicate the game?

It’s probably more down to his team being individuals rather than a team.
 
And that’s the break. Malaga have had the best chances but find themselves a 
goal down due to Ronaldo’s 33rd minute header, which should have been 
disallowed for offside. He also had a penalty saved two minutes later. Stay 
tuned, it’s a belter.
 
45 min: Ronaldo is played in by a scrumptious through ball from Carvajal but 
is flagged for offside. This time the call is correct.
 
43 min: It’s cleared, but only as far as Kroos, who sends in another cross. 
Weligton gets rid this time, allowing Malaga to break. Juanpi is in a good 
position again but is incorrectly flagged for offside. Marcelo was playing him 
onside.
 
43 min: Carvajal wins a corner on the right off Torres.
 
39 min: Yes, they can. Juanpi cuts the Real defence apart again. He feeds Cop, 
whose scuffed effort is denied by a right-foot stop from Navas, the ball 
looping up for Ramos to then head over the bar for a corner, which amounts to 
nothing.
