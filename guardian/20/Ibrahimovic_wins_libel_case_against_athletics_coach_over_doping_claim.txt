footballer used performance-enhancing substances.

The district court in Karlstad ordered Ulf Karlsson to pay a fine of SKr24,000 
(£2,170) for comments he made at a panel discussion at a sports conference in

The judge said: “The court’s opinion is that in the context of what was said 
Ulf Karlsson gave the impression that Zlatan was doping during his time at 
Juventus.”

Karlsson was the head coach of Sweden’s national athletics team from 2001–04. 
Ibrahimovic played for Juve from 2004–06 after leaving Ajax.
