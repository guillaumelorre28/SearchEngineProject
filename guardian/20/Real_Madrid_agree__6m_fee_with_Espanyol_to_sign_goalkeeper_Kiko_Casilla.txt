Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> have agreed a 
fee with Espanyol to sign the Spain goalkeeper Kiko Casilla.

The 28-year-old arrives following the departure of Iker Casillas to Porto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/12/iker-casillas-real-madrid-porto-confirmed>
, and will provide competition for Keylor Navas and the inexperienced Fernando 
Pacheco in the first team.

Espanyol <https://www.theguardian.com/football/espanyol> said in a statement: 
“Espanyol and Real Madrid have reached an agreement in the last few hours for 
the transfer of Kiko Casilla.”

The deal is reported to involve a payment of around €6m by Real, who retained 
a 50% ownership of Casilla – a product of their youth academy – after he moved 
to Espanyol in 2007.

Casilla has made one appearance for Spain, in November last year when he came 
on as a second-half substitute in a 1-0 defeat to Germany, the world champions, 
but was not included by Vicente del Bosque, the national coach, in his latest 
squad.
