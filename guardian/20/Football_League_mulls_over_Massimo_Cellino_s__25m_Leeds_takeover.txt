The Football League has confirmed it is still in talks with Leeds over a 
proposed £25m takeover by Massimo Cellino.

The Italian businessman's company, Eleonora Sport Ltd, exchanged contracts 
with Leeds' owner, Gulf Finance House Capital,

 on 7 February for 75% of the club's shares and Cellino – who also owns 
Cagliari – has since been waiting for the League's approval.

The League said on Tuesday that while "a significant amount" of the 
information it had requested has been supplied, "there are still a number of 
outstanding matters that will require further submissions from the two 
parties". The League's board is due to meet on 13 March when it will receive an 
update unless all the remaining issues can be resolved in advance.

Cellino, who is based in Miami, has twice been convicted of fraud and is 
contesting a charge of embezzlement, but he remains confident of passing the 
League's owners and directors' test.

GFH Capital, a Bahrain-based investment firm, bought the club from Ken Bates 
in December 2012 and plans to retain a 10% stake. If Cellino's takeover is 
approved, the Leeds' chairman Salah Nooruddin will remain in post and the 
managing director, David Haigh, will become the chief executive.

International Investment Bank and Nooruddin (3.3%) will still own the 
remaining 15% of shares.

Cellino, who made his fortune in agriculture, received a 15-month suspended 
prison sentence in 2001 after being convicted of false accounting atCagliari

A conviction in 1996 for fraudulently claiming EU agricultural subsidies was 
overturned in 2012, while in February 2013 he spent 16 days in jail after being 
arrested for embezzlement – a charge he denies – in relation to the 
redevelopment of Cagliari's stadium.

Cellino's two convictions, nearly 13 and 18 years old, are considered "spent" 
in English law and it is understood they cannot be taken into consideration 
under the League's owners and directors' test. Although he has an outstanding 
charge against him, Cellino is assumed innocent until it can be proved 
otherwise.

Long considered one of the most charismatic owners in Italian football, 
Cellino was shown around Leeds' Thorp Arch training ground for the first time 
in October. He verbally agreed to a 75% takeover with GFH at the end of January 
andthen tried to sack the manager Brian McDermott

 in favour of installing his friend and former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca 
Festa.

That bid outraged many Leeds fans, some of whom attempted to barricade Cellino 
into Elland Road on the eve of the club's home game against Huddersfield on 1 
February.

McDermott stayed away 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/01/leeds-united-brian-mcdermott-owners>
 from the match, which Leeds won 5-1 under the stewardship of his assistant 
Nigel Gibbs, while GFH released a statement during the game overruling Cellino 
and stating that McDermott was still manager.

McDermott returned to work as normal the following Monday and Cellino 
attempted to distance himself from the controversy, claiming it was the current 
owner who wanted to sack the manager.

Cellino has since said he is willing to work with McDermott if his takeover is 
approved and the two men have met twice to discuss the way forward.
