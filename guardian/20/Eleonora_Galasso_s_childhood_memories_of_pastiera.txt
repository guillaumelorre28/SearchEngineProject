“At Christmas time, the kitchen rejoices with reassuring smells. While a 
festivecotechino cooks quietly in the oven, I sometimes take a break from the 
boiling and chopping to sit down by the fire and peel some wrinkly, often 
gigantic, oranges.

As I throw the peel on to the fire, the scent of orange oil brings back 
memories of the cakes I made as a child. Many Italian cakes celebrate citrus, 
but the most splendidly citrussy of them all ispastiera, a glorious pastry pie 
stuffed with a symphony of soft ricotta, cooked wheat, eggs, orange-blossom 
water, spices and candied fruits. It’s actually an Easter recipe traditionally, 
but its ingredients sing of Christmas, and you can find it on Italian tables 
all year round.

I spent my childhood in a convent school. I was an unruly kid and was often 
put in the corner to “reflect”, so to speak. On a good day, my favourite nun, 
Suor Fortunata, would take me to the kitchen to help her cook. She was not only 
a teacher but took charge of the school refectory, overseeing what was served 
to the pupils. On Thursdays, the day before the traditionalmagro – a day of 
abstinence from all animal products and sweet indulgences – we would regularly 
be servedpastiera. We were a rowdy lot, but just the sight of the pastiera had 
us goggle-eyed and orderly with anticipation.

Oranges are the essence of this cake. When eating it, I can’t help but be 
taken back to those childhood days when their bittersweet fragrance wafted 
through the air. The smell, the taste and the ritual of makingpastiera makes me 
feel at home.

For the pastry
1 egg
250g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
100g caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder
80g unsalted butter
30ml limoncello liqueur
Zest of 1 lemon

1 Grease and line a 23cm non-stick springform cake tin with baking paper.

2 Put the raisins in water and soak for 30 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry.

3 Meanwhile, make the pastry. Put the egg, flour, sugar, baking powder, 
butter, liqueur and lemon zest into a food processor and mix together to form a 
dough. Roll into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the 
refrigerator for 30 minutes.

4 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add 
the milk, wheat and lemon rind. Simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes.

5 Beat the ricotta with half the sugar in a bowl. In a second bowl, whisk the 
yolks with the remaining sugar until fluffy.

6 In a third bowl, beat the egg whites together with the orange blossom water 
and cinnamon until stiff.

7 Using a wooden spoon, gently mix together the ingredients from all three 
bowls. Add the wheat mixture and fold in the orange peel, raisins and walnuts.

8 Unwrap the pastry and cut off two thirds. Sandwich the larger piece between 
two sheets of baking paper and roll it out into a 29cm disc. Place in the base 
of the cake tin, carefully pushing the pastry 3cm up the sides of the tin. 
Chill for 10 minutes.

9 Roll out the remaining pastry third between sheets of baking paper as before 
and cut into 10 strips measuring 23cm x 2cm. Arrange the strips on a sheet of 
lightly floured greaseproof paper and chill for 5 minutes.

10 Remove the base from the fridge and pour over the wheat cream. Gently place 
the strips on top in a lattice pattern and bake for 1 hour, until slightly 
browned and a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. 
Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes to allow the filling to become firm 
before serving.
