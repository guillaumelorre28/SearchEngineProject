Murray Walker, the voice of Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> on TV, said his decision to 
retire from ITV's motor-racing commentary team came from a gut feeling that 
"the time had come".

Mr Walker said today of his decision to stop commentating on Formula One at 
the end of the 2001 season: "I just woke up one morning recently and thought 
'that's it, the time has come'.

"I will be 78 years old at the end of the 2001 season. I will have been 
commentating on Formula One and other motor sport for 52 years. I just felt now 
is the time to stop."

Mr Walker said the decision had nothing to do with his health, although he has 
had both hips replaced.

He said: "I like to think I'm always ahead of the game mentally, though I know 
a lot of people think I'm not."

Brian Barwick, ITV controller of sport, said Mr Walker's Formula One 
commentary colleague James Allen would be given the "first opportunity" to fill 
the veteran broadcaster's boots.

Mr Allen, who does pit lane reports for ITV on Grand Prix days, stood in for 
Mr Walker as the main race commentator during the French Grand Prix earlier 
this year.

Mr Barwick said: "James Allen picked up the baton at short notice and did a 
great job. He will get his opportunity next year ahead of, and above and 
beyond, any other candidate we may wish to consider."

He also hinted that Mr Walker may continue to be part of the ITV F1 
presentation team after next year.

"I hope not to lose Murray totally from our coverage. I hope his wealth of 
knowledge will pop up elsewhere, outside the commentary box," he added.

Mr Barwick also paid tribute to Mr Walker, saying: "We are losing a unique 
character, someone who has been synonymous with his sport. ITV Sport owes a 
debt of gratitude to Murray."

Mr Walker said that after he retired from the ITV commentary team he hoped to 
write a book about his experiences.
