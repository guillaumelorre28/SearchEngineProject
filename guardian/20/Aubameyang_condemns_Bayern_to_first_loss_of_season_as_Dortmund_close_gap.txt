Borussia Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> 
ended Bayern Munich’s unbeaten run, edging a 1-0 win on Saturday thanks to 
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 12th goal of the season, cutting the gap between 
the champions and their biggest title rivals to three points.

Gabon international Aubameyang made the most of Dortmund’s frantic start, 
tapping in an 11th-minute assist from Mario Götze, who was facing his former 
club for the first time since his move in the offseason.

More than a quarter of the game had gone before Bayern, who drop to second in 
theBundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball>, three 
points behind new leaders RB Leipzig, landed a shot on goal, but they were in 
command for the rest of the half, although they failed to beat Dortmund keeper 
Roman Bürki.

They did put the ball in the net 10 minutes after the restart but Franck 
Ribéry’s clever flick was ruled offside.

Xabi Alonso then hammered his shot against the crossbar as Bayern upped the 
pressure, laying siege in the Dortmund half.

Aubameyang should have made it two for the hosts in the 71st when he pounced 
on an Alonso mistake and charged into the box, but Manuel Neuer stood his 
ground and palmed his shot wide.

Dortmund, whose win was only their second in the last nine Bundesliga 
encounters against Bayern, move up to third on 21 points, six behind Leipzig, 
who won 3-2 at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday night.
