Gianluigi Buffon is three minutes away from equalling a 22-year record after 
Juventus beatSassuolo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sassuolo> 1-0 to 
move six points clear at the top of Serie A on Friday.

Paulo Dybala scored the only goal of an entertaining match as Juventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> kept a 10th successive clean 
sheet in the league. Buffon has now not been beaten in Serie A in 926 minutes, 
the second-longest stretch in league history.

The unbeaten record in Serie A is held by Sebastiano Rossi, who kept a clean 
sheet for 929 consecutive minutes for AC Milan from 12 December 1993 to 27 
February 1994, beating the previous mark set by the formerJuventus

 goalkeeper Dino Zoff in 1972-73 by 26 minutes. Buffon can match Rossi’s record 
in next weekend’s derby match at Torino.

Sassuolo were the last team to beat Juventus in the league back on 28 October 
and the leaders, who have admitted that that defeat shook them out of their 
complacency, have won 18 and drawn one of 19 games since.

Dybala nearly got Juve off to a flying start with a vicious, dipping shot 
which Andrea Consigli tipped over the bar. Consigli also saved Alex Sandro’s 
header with his feet but Sassuolo, who are seventh on 44 points, missed the 
chance to go ahead when Alfred Duncan shot wide after 20 minutes.

Dybala showed him how it was done in the 36th minute when he curled the ball 
into the net off the inside of the post from 20 metres after Juan Cuadrado 
raced down the flank and laid the ball back to the Argentinian.

Juventus attacked relentlessly for the first hour but Sassuolo refused to lie 
down and put them under pressure in a tense finale.

Sansone was always dangerous, first testing Buffon with a snapshot and then 
breaking forward and nearly catching him out with a shot which the veteran 
struggled to parry.
