The game was halted in the 68th minute following repeated booing from pockets 
of fans whenever the Senegal international touched the ball. The referee, 
Massimiliano Irrati, only decided to continue proceedings after consulting with 
coaches and officials andNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> 
secured a 2-0 win with goals from Gonzalo Higuaín and José Callejón to stay top 
of the standings.

“I would not have stopped the match as that only lends importance to a 
minority of fans,” theLazio <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> 
manager, Stefano Pioli, said afterwards. “If I had been the referee I would not 
have stopped it. We also have players of colour and they are treated well.”

Koulibaly, however, described the chanting as “ugly” and praised the referee 
in a post on his Instagram account.


“I want to thank the Lazio players, but especially the referee Irrati for his 
courage,” he wrote. “I thank my team mates, the public and our fans, who have 
been a great support against these ugly chants. I want to thank everyone for 
the messages of solidarity which I have received.”

The Napoli coach, Maurizio Sarri, said he was sorry about the chanting. “Bravo 
to Irrati for stopping the match,” he said on Twitter.


Italian football has been plagued by racist incidents recently, notably in 
2013 when the Milan players Kevin-Prince Boateng and Mario Balotelli were the 
victims of offensive chanting in two separate matches.
