Mainz drew 0-0 with Hoffenheim on Friday as both sides missed the chance to go 
top of theBundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball>. 
With leaders Bayern Munich in action on Saturday at Cologne, the goalless draw 
left both teams on 10 points, one behind the leaders, with Mainz in second and 
Hoffenheim in third place on goal difference.

“The draw is in order. We’d have liked to have won but the result is fair,” 
the Mainz sporting director, Christian Heidel, said.

Hoffenheim’s Anthony Modeste had the best early chance for the visitors but 
shot straight at Loris Karius. Roberto Firmino drew a good save from the Mainz 
goalkeeper in the 33rd minute, and Niklas Süle headed just over from the 
resulting corner.

Missing Bundesliga top scorer Shinji Okazaki through injury, Mainz had their 
best chance when Filip Djuricic charged through in the 36th minute but his weak 
chip was easily caught by Oliver Baumann.

Firmino headed against the post from a narrow angle on the hour, in what was a 
hectic but error-strewn second half. “It was very hard-fought from both sides,” 
said the Hoffenheim striker Adam Szalai, who came on as a substitute against 
his former side.
