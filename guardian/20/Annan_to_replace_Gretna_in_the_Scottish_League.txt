Annan Athletic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/annan-athletic> have 
replaced Gretna in the Scottish League after the 29 SFL clubs voted in favour 
of the East of Scotland League team joining the Third Division. Spartans, 
Edinburgh City, Preston Athletic and Cove Rangers also applied to take the 
place left vacant by Gretna, who went out of business after being relegated 
from the Clydesdale Bank Premier League.

"It's just sunk in but it's been a long time coming," said Annan's chairman 
Henry McLelland. "We've not been working towards this for only a few months - 
we've been working for this since we played Stranraer in 1979. We have been 
rewarded for all our work since then," he added, referring to the club's 3-1 
defeat in the 1979 Scottish Cup.

Annan required a minimum of 15 votes to gain entry into the SFL but polled 17, 
five more than their closest rivals Cove Rangers, in the final round of voting. 
Spartans, due to move to a new stadium next year, were thought to be the early 
favourites but were beaten by Annan despite finishing 19 points above the club 
in the East of Scotland League.

Annan failed in their last attempt to join the SFL when they lost out to 
Peterhead and Elgin City in 2000.

"On behalf of the working party, I would like to say how impressed we were by 
all five clubs," said SFL chief executive David Longmuir. "We welcome Annan to 
the Scottish Football League, where they will play a Challenge Cup game on July 
26 and then their first league game on August 2."
