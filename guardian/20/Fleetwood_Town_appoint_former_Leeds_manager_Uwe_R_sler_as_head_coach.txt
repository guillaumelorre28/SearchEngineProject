have grown the club and the facilities, as well as winning so many promotions 
to now be playing inLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball>. I had several options 
in the UK and abroad but I was waiting for an opportunity and challenge like

Gretar Steinsson really impressed me and I feel I can put my stamp on Fleetwood 
Town. I am very ambitious and I know the owner is too, we all want to be 
successful here together.”
