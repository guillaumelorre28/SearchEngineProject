Summary

Had Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
lost this, it would surely have been the end for Van Gaal. But after a very 
professional performance from his players, he lives to fight another day. Three 
more days, actually, as that is when Midtjylland arrive at Old Trafford with a 
2-1 advantage. With an away goal, you would still back to United to progress. 
Six points off fourth, winning the Europa League may well be United’s best 
chance of securing Champions League football.

Winning the FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> may well be a 
bit harder. West Ham await for United in the quarter-finals, whilst Chelsea and 
Arsenal are potential semi-final/final opponents.

For Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury>, this was a 
poor showing. They had a chance to pose United some problems tonight, but 
defended way too deep and never threatened on the counter-attack. On Saturday, 
they travel to Colchester – who are bottom of League One – which will go a long 
way to deciding whether they can beat the drop this season. They currently sit 
in the relegation zone.

Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets, particularly the ones 
regarding lookalikes. See you next time. Bye!

90+2 min: “Isn’t Zak the son of Altrincham legend Barry Whitbread?” asks Simon 
Rose. “Barry had a fewFA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
giant killing adventures himself back in the day.....”

Indeed he is. And the internet tells me that Barry scored a hat-trick on his 
debut for Lancaster City, and scored their early goal in what became a 2–1 
defeat to Football League opponents Notts County in the first round proper of 
the 1972–73 FA Cup. He later became head of recruitment at Liverpool.

on forShrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury>, fires a 
shot from range towards Romero’s top corner. The Argentinian scrambles across

89 min: Good save from Leutwiler! Pereira releases Depay, who is one-on-one 
with Shrewsbury’s keeper, but the Swiss gets down well. He’s played OK today 
but Depay is obviously absolutely devoid of confidence in front of goal. 
Probably not helped by the home (and away) fans that jeer his every shot.

88 min: Shrewsbury have been much better this half, although that is in part 
now due to the fact that they are playing against 10 men. United are now happy 
to see this one out, and are playing keep-ball. They have had over 75% 
possession this game.

86 min: Ooooohhhhh, Shrewsbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> should have themselves a 
consolation goal. Grimmer had plenty of time to measure his cross, delivering 
the ball to the back post. Ogogo ghosts in completely unmarked but jumps for it 
too early and manages to head it wide from five yards out. It was easier to 
score. Awful, awful defending from United.

84 min: Ogogo drops the shoulder, and sells Smalling a delightful dummy, 
before squaring the ball. Mangan stabs the ball at goal from six yards out and 
for a moment Romero looks helpless, but Varela hacks the ball off the line.

79 min: 3-0 up and LVG’s supporters have started to surface!

“I really would love for Van Gaal to stay,” writes Prashanth Avireddi. “I 
admire his philosophy. It is quite simple to understand, every player has a 
pre-assigned position and they move the ball around and attack when the time is 
right. In EPL all the teams held deep against united and counter attacked. This 
was possible due to collapse in mid-field and defense. How much can we blame 
Van Gaal for this, With little bit of creativity the team could have 
flourished. He signed the best player of netherlands, upcoming young midfielder 
from spain (was then compared to scholes), brought in leadership of bastian. It 
is the team who is not repaying van gaal’s trust. I feel for him.”

76 min: Chance for Shrewsbury! Grimmer gets well forward on the right and is 
chopped down by Depay to give the home side a dangerous free kick. Brown whips 
in an excellent inswinger and Whitbread challenges Romero in an aerial 
challenge, but can’t direct his header goalwards! He only had to nod it into an 
empty net!

74 min: Yep, Keane is going to have to come off, he looks as though he’s 
pulled his groin. He can’t go on and signals to the bench. That’s very 
disappointing, he’s really earned his chance here, but United are going to have 
to continue with 10 men!

Meanwhile, footage has emerged of LVG nearly poking himself in the eye in the 
first half.

A near miss for LVG! ✏ #EmiratesFACup

71 min: Another lovely flowing move ends with Depay backheeling the ball to 
Keane, and the young striker wraps his foot around the ball and clatters the 
ball against the outside of the post. Close! Keane stays down after the shot, 
has he pulled something?

69 min: Van Gaal makes his final change: Will Keane coming on for Martial. 
Another sensible change, but as soon as the Frenchman is off the pitch, Lingard 
goes down in crumpled heap after a heavy challenge from Whalley. United have 
made all of their changes, so Lingard is going to have to soldier on. Keane 
scored five goals for the club’s U-21 side recently …

67 min: I mentioned Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> chants at the top of 
this MBM, and the away fans have just broken into song:

“We’ll support you, We’ll support you, We’ll support ever more.”

United have been excellent today, in all fairness. LVG can be pleased with his 
players.

63 min: Riley has looked lively since coming on at right-back, but a couple of 
you have asked what is wrong with Darmian. He sustained a dislocated shoulder 
at Sunderland earlier this month. LVG confirmed last week that the Italian is 
still a few weeks away from regaining fitness.

GOAL! Shrewsbury Town 0-3 Manchester United (Lingard 61)

Great counter-attacking move from United! Shrewsbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> going more attacking this 
half was always going to leave them lighter at the back and they are made to 
pay. Romero throws the ball out to the left. Mata holds the ball up well, lays 
the ball back to Herrera and the Spaniard floats a beautifully weighted pass to 
Lingard at the back post. Lingard doesn’t have to break stride and calmly 
side-foots the ball through Leutwiler’s legs into the net. Cue the Dab 
celebration. Urgh.

Mangan are doing well to win set-pieces and get their team up the pitch.

52 min: Martial should have made it 3-0. Blind takes a clever short corner, 
passing it along the byline to Mata, who neatly flicks the ball to the back 
post, and Martial comes stealing in but can only head the ball wide. He 
mistimed his header, but should have buried that from three yards out.

48 min: “Even at 2-0 Van Gaal doesn’t want to give a game to Keane and 
Perreira and rest Martial or Mata ahead of Thursday game,” emails Tomislav 
Klauski. “Instead he changes a left back. That alone is a cause for dismissal.”

46 min: Manchester United start the second half just as they started the 
first: strongly. First Martial nearly pounces on an error from Grandison inside 
theShrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> box, and then 
Mata swings a pinpoint cross to Lingard at the back post, but the Englishman’s 
shot is well blocked by Brown.

Manchester United and Shrewsbury both make one change at the break:

Shrewsbury send midfielder Cole on for their captain Knight-Percival. Looks 
like they are reshuffling to a 4-4-2. Cole is a formerManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> youth team player, but 
left the club in 2014.

Manchester United bring Riley on for his debut. He’s on for Borthwick-Jackson.

This is a good email, from David Wall. Shrewsbury defended bravely but showed 
absolutely no attacking intent in that half.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> enjoyed 79% possession.

“The manager of the lower division side in this kind of draw is usually immune 
to criticism seeing as little is expected of their side. But unless he has some 
ingenious rope-a-dope ploy to spring in the second half this reflects pretty 
poorly on Micky Mellon. He could at least send his team out to try to make a 
contest of it, and if they were to manage that it might even provide a boost to 
confidence and help their form in the league.”

GOAL! Shrewsbury Town 0-2 Manchester United (Mata 45+1 min)

… and the Spaniard curls it over the wall and into the corner. Luetwiler 
didn’t move in the Shrewsbury goal. There was a group ofManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> players blocking the 
keeper’s view of the set-piece, and they were offside when Mata struck it, but 
the linesman does not flag! 2-0. Game over?

42 min: “Re: Kev O’Rourke’s comment “…expect LVG to start wearing flares, high 
heels and a mullet” …that would be an improvement on the entertainment front, 
at least”, writes John Willoug.

In this game at least, United haven’t been bad going forward. It’s just that 
Depay keeps shooting.

Manchester United find their swagger at last to blow Shrewsbury away
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/22/shrewsbury-town-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report> 
Had Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
lost this, it would surely have been the end for Van Gaal. But after a very 
professional performance from his players, he lives to fight another day. Three 
more days, actually, as that is when Midtjylland arrive at Old Trafford with a 
2-1 advantage. With an away goal, you would still back to United to progress. 
Six points off fourth, winning the Europa League may well be United’s best 
chance of securing Champions League football.

Winning the FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> may well be a 
bit harder. West Ham await for United in the quarter-finals, whilst Chelsea and 
Arsenal are potential semi-final/final opponents.

For Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury>, this was a 
poor showing. They had a chance to pose United some problems tonight, but 
defended way too deep and never threatened on the counter-attack. On Saturday, 
they travel to Colchester – who are bottom of League One – which will go a long 
way to deciding whether they can beat the drop this season. They currently sit 
in the relegation zone.

Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets, particularly the ones 
regarding lookalikes. See you next time. Bye!

90+2 min: “Isn’t Zak the son of Altrincham legend Barry Whitbread?” asks Simon 
Rose. “Barry had a fewFA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
giant killing adventures himself back in the day.....”

Indeed he is. And the internet tells me that Barry scored a hat-trick on his 
debut for Lancaster City, and scored their early goal in what became a 2–1 
defeat to Football League opponents Notts County in the first round proper of 
the 1972–73 FA Cup. He later became head of recruitment at Liverpool.
 
90 min: Three minutes added on here. Clark, who has been quiet since he came 
on forShrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury>, fires a 
shot from range towards Romero’s top corner. The Argentinian scrambles across 
but the shot dips just over.
 
89 min: Good save from Leutwiler! Pereira releases Depay, who is one-on-one 
with Shrewsbury’s keeper, but the Swiss gets down well. He’s played OK today 
but Depay is obviously absolutely devoid of confidence in front of goal. 
Probably not helped by the home (and away) fans that jeer his every shot.
 
88 min: Shrewsbury have been much better this half, although that is in part 
now due to the fact that they are playing against 10 men. United are now happy 
to see this one out, and are playing keep-ball. They have had over 75% 
possession this game.
 
86 min: Ooooohhhhh, Shrewsbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> should have themselves a 
consolation goal. Grimmer had plenty of time to measure his cross, delivering 
the ball to the back post. Ogogo ghosts in completely unmarked but jumps for it 
too early and manages to head it wide from five yards out. It was easier to 
score. Awful, awful defending from United.

84 min: Ogogo drops the shoulder, and sells Smalling a delightful dummy, 
before squaring the ball. Mangan stabs the ball at goal from six yards out and 
for a moment Romero looks helpless, but Varela hacks the ball off the line.
 
83 min: Pereira skips round Grimmer and fizzes a good low cross across the 
six-yard box but neither Depay or Lingard can get themselves on the end of it.

Griffiths/Getty Images  
81 min: Shrewsbury make another change: Clark on for Akpa Akpro, who hasn’t 
really had the opportunity to impress.
 
79 min: 3-0 up and LVG’s supporters have started to surface!

“I really would love for Van Gaal to stay,” writes Prashanth Avireddi. “I 
admire his philosophy. It is quite simple to understand, every player has a 
pre-assigned position and they move the ball around and attack when the time is 
right. In EPL all the teams held deep against united and counter attacked. This 
was possible due to collapse in mid-field and defense. How much can we blame 
Van Gaal for this, With little bit of creativity the team could have 
flourished. He signed the best player of netherlands, upcoming young midfielder 
from spain (was then compared to scholes), brought in leadership of bastian. It 
is the team who is not repaying van gaal’s trust. I feel for him.”
 A better night for Louis van Gaal. Photograph: Magi Haroun/Rex/Shutterstock  
76 min: Chance for Shrewsbury! Grimmer gets well forward on the right and is 
chopped down by Depay to give the home side a dangerous free kick. Brown whips 
in an excellent inswinger and Whitbread challenges Romero in an aerial 
challenge, but can’t direct his header goalwards! He only had to nod it into an 
empty net!
 
74 min: Yep, Keane is going to have to come off, he looks as though he’s 
pulled his groin. He can’t go on and signals to the bench. That’s very 
disappointing, he’s really earned his chance here, but United are going to have 
to continue with 10 men!

Meanwhile, footage has emerged of LVG nearly poking himself in the eye in the 
first half.
BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) 
A near miss for LVG! ✏ #EmiratesFACup 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmiratesFACup?src=hash> https://t.co/WSCpYGaMCj

71 min: Another lovely flowing move ends with Depay backheeling the ball to 
Keane, and the young striker wraps his foot around the ball and clatters the 
ball against the outside of the post. Close! Keane stays down after the shot, 
has he pulled something?
 
69 min: Van Gaal makes his final change: Will Keane coming on for Martial. 
Another sensible change, but as soon as the Frenchman is off the pitch, Lingard 
goes down in crumpled heap after a heavy challenge from Whalley. United have 
made all of their changes, so Lingard is going to have to soldier on. Keane 
scored five goals for the club’s U-21 side recently …
 
67 min: I mentioned Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> chants at the top of 
this MBM, and the away fans have just broken into song:

“We’ll support you, We’ll support you, We’ll support ever more.”

United have been excellent today, in all fairness. LVG can be pleased with his 
players.
 
65 min: Manchester United make their second change, and with Midtjylland on 
Thursday, it’s a sensible one. Mata comes off for Andreas Pereira, straight 
swap.
 
63 min: Riley has looked lively since coming on at right-back, but a couple of 
you have asked what is wrong with Darmian. He sustained a dislocated shoulder 
at Sunderland earlier this month. LVG confirmed last week that the Italian is 
still a few weeks away from regaining fitness.
 
Great counter-attacking move from United! Shrewsbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> going more attacking this 
half was always going to leave them lighter at the back and they are made to 
pay. Romero throws the ball out to the left. Mata holds the ball up well, lays 
the ball back to Herrera and the Spaniard floats a beautifully weighted pass to 
Lingard at the back post. Lingard doesn’t have to break stride and calmly 
side-foots the ball through Leutwiler’s legs into the net. Cue the Dab 
celebration. Urgh.

60 min: Grimmer and Whalley are beginning to pose some problems for Riley. 
Grimmer whips a ball into United’s box, but Romero comes and claims it cleanly.
 
57 min: Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> are going 
direct, and it’s working. Akpa Akpro is a handful up top and both himself and 
Mangan are doing well to win set-pieces and get their team up the pitch.
 
55 min: “Louis van Gaal is an absolute dead ringer for Dolores Avery from 
Netflix’s Making a Murderer,” suggests Joel Baldwin. He’s not the only one 
that’s spotted that one.
Harrison (@HarrisonLewis94)

2016 <https://twitter.com/HarrisonLewis94/status/701860900303724545>  
52 min: Martial should have made it 3-0. Blind takes a clever short corner, 
passing it along the byline to Mata, who neatly flicks the ball to the back 
post, and Martial comes stealing in but can only head the ball wide. He 
mistimed his header, but should have buried that from three yards out.
 
51 min: Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> changing 
to 4-4-2 means Depay has a lot more space to function. He cuts inside again 
from the left, this time flashing a shot just wide. There was a deflection on 
that. Corner.
 
48 min: “Even at 2-0 Van Gaal doesn’t want to give a game to Keane and 
Perreira and rest Martial or Mata ahead of Thursday game,” emails Tomislav 
Klauski. “Instead he changes a left back. That alone is a cause for dismissal.”
 
46 min: Manchester United start the second half just as they started the 
first: strongly. First Martial nearly pounces on an error from Grandison inside 
theShrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> box, and then 
Mata swings a pinpoint cross to Lingard at the back post, but the Englishman’s 
shot is well blocked by Brown.
 
Peeep! And we’re off again.
 
Manchester United and Shrewsbury both make one change at the break:

Shrewsbury send midfielder Cole on for their captain Knight-Percival. Looks 
like they are reshuffling to a 4-4-2. Cole is a formerManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> youth team player, but 
left the club in 2014.

Manchester United bring Riley on for his debut. He’s on for Borthwick-Jackson. 
 
This is a good email, from David Wall. Shrewsbury defended bravely but showed 
absolutely no attacking intent in that half.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> enjoyed 79% possession.

“The manager of the lower division side in this kind of draw is usually immune 
to criticism seeing as little is expected of their side. But unless he has some 
ingenious rope-a-dope ploy to spring in the second half this reflects pretty 
poorly on Micky Mellon. He could at least send his team out to try to make a 
contest of it, and if they were to manage that it might even provide a boost to 
confidence and help their form in the league.”

“Anyone who watches Fargo will tell you that Anthony Martial is the spitting 
image of literate criminal Mike Milligan,” suggests Ezra Finkelstein.

Not a bad shout, that. How about Zak Whitbread as a bearded Garry Monk?

Whitbread, formerly of Liverpool and Norwich (among others), was actually a 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> fan 
growing up, and was a mascot at Old Trafford when he was 10 years old.
 
After a solid start, Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> are in complete 
control here. Shrewsbury need a miracle.

… and the Spaniard curls it over the wall and into the corner. Luetwiler 
didn’t move in the Shrewsbury goal. There was a group ofManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> players blocking the 
keeper’s view of the set-piece, and they were offside when Mata struck it, but 
the linesman does not flag! 2-0. Game over?

45 min: Penalty for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>?! No, Whitbread brings 
Martial down just outside the box, and it’s a free-kick right on the edge after 
a nice backheel from Mata released the Frenchman. It’s Mata over the ball …
 
42 min: “Re: Kev O’Rourke’s comment “…expect LVG to start wearing flares, high 
heels and a mullet” …that would be an improvement on the entertainment front, 
at least”, writes John Willoug.

In this game at least, United haven’t been bad going forward. It’s just that 
Depay keeps shooting.
