As late as the 1980s, it was not unusual to come across older people bemused 
by the idea of rectilinear breaded seafood. “Who ever saw a fish with fingers?” 
your grandad might scoff. Not because he was a foodie (no one was in 1986) but 
simply because he could remember a time when food did not come pre-packed, 
frozen and reshaped so that it bore no visual resemblance to its animal origin.

Grandad was fighting a losing battle. Thirty years on, in this supposed nation 
of food lovers, fish fingers remain wildly popular. Sales have wobbled in 
recent years, but we eat more than 1.5m fish fingers a day and, according to 
market behemoth Birds Eye, 75% of us first taste fish in the form of fish 
fingers.

Fish <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fish> fingers were once things 
you grew out of but that is no longer true. This 4am fallback for drunk 
students is now a staple on pub menus – gussied-up with handmade goujons and 
tartare sauce, perhaps, but nonetheless testament to the fact that for all 
their relative blandness (“No bones, no waste, no smell, no fuss,” was Birds 
Eye’s launch strapline), these crispy cod pieces are – particularly when 
slapped between two slices of bread – an enduring balm for the soul.

Not that making a good fish-finger butty at home is easy. You may think that 
industrial production (introduced to the UK in the 1950s by US frozen-foods 
pioneer Clarence Birdseye) would produce a uniform fish finger. But no. At 
every stage, from the fish itself (usually cut from huge frozen blocks of whole 
fillets) to the “enrobing” (the technical term for covering fish in batter and 
breadcrumbs), numerous tiny details have an impact on quality.

Which of the supermarket brands are a catch? Which should you throw back? And 
where does Birds Eye rank these days?

 Birds Eye … ‘meagre cod within’ Photograph: PR 
Birds Eye, 12 cod fish fingers, 336g, £2.50 
<http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=268201507&amp>

Has Captain Birdseye been hammering the rum? Because for all the packaging’s 
rhetorical zeal (“Happy families guaranteed”) and its trumpeting of cod’s 
health benefits, these rather withered-looking fingers fail to dazzle. A mere 
8.5cm by 2.5cm – ie basic, primary-school size – their crumb packs a decent, 
satisfyingly dry crunch, but the meagre cod within (58% of the contents, where 
most contain 60%) lacks any real solidity and heft. Mostly, it melts away 
toothlessly; a sweet, slippery, shy presence. On a sandwich, these become an 
anonymous mush.

Like Birds Eye’s, these standard-size fingers are made from Marine Stewardship 
Council (MSC) approved sustainable cod, which is one of the few positives to 
report. The fish filling looks apologetically thin (58% of the whole, roughly 
7mm thick), and the orange crumb is uneven. Intermittently, it offers an 
adequate crispiness; elsewhere the texture of worn carpet. Beneath that, you 
will find a gloopy underlay of undercooked batter, coating that sliver of 
squishy, textureless fish. The dominant flavours are breadcrumbs and tired 
cooking oil.

Fatter fingers, these (12.5cm by 3.5cm), they are as attractively tanned as a 
Costa expat. The notably peppery shells are audibly crisp and they (albeit, not 
as comprehensively as they could be) are filled with a creditably thick layer 
of robustly textured fillet fish. The problem, however, is gunk: in many places 
lie millimetres of wet batter, sitting like grey putty under the breadcrumbs, 
which fundamentally undermines that crunch. You would eat these without 
complaint, but with no great enthusiasm.

“Like eating bland jelly”, “so mushy it’s like they’re filled with wet 
tissue”, “eerily insubstantial” read my tasting notes. While big (13cm by 3cm), 
these fingers fail on virtually all fronts. You get the occasional meatier, 
tastier mouthful (and there is some haphazard crunch in the crumb) but 
generally these pale fingers are a trudge of damp, woolly fish swaddled in 
sticky batter, the crumb only loosely adhered to the fish; more blanket than 
tight coating. A casual two fingers to the consumer.

But for their notable 2cm thickness, these look like kids’ stuff: standard 
length, golden orange in colour, the coating offering little resistance as you 
put your fork through it. Chew on, however, and you will find the well-seasoned 
breadcrumb offers a light, brief residual crunch and a reasonable flavour 
(albeit one more “fried” than savoury). The (in parts, slightly waterlogged) 
fish delivers a toothsome, meaty texture and a clear sweetness. Crucially, 
there is little if any batter residue under the crumb. Overall, not bad.

Co-Op, Ultimate fish fingers 6, 380g, £3.29

A curiosity, these 4cm-wide, MSC-approved fingers are sold fresh not frozen 
for oven-baking not grilling. The first batch tasted worthy and bland (they 
need more of the listed salt and cider vinegar), and they required a blast 
under the grill to strengthen the eventually impressively crackling, crunchy 
crumb. A significant layer of moist, floury batter under that (still 
flavourless) crumb undermines it, however. The two combine to produce an overly 
thick coating for fish that, while sporadically sound, was often mealy and 
lacking muscular density.

Asda, 30 cod fillet fish fingers, 900g, £4

Boasting the fish finger’s classic fake tan-orange hue, Asda’s (toothless, 
gummy) offering will sate ravenous kids, but that is all they are good for. The 
coating (more a baggy jacket) is gritty if not unpleasantly so, but offers no 
crisp definition at first bite and, yet again, hides an almost gelatinous 
substratum of icky batter. The 64% cod content seems generous, until you taste 
it. It is classic frozen cod: mushy, flavourless, fibrous, chewy. Make a 
sandwich with these and it would be claggy chore.

Sainsbury’s, Taste the Difference 8 chunky cod fish fingers, 480g, £3

These swollen fingers (9cm by 4cm) are not immune to the problems outlined 
above. There is some glop under the crumb (giving them a slight gluey edge) and 
the MSC-approved fish, while persuasively meaty for once, could hardly be said 
to taste vibrantly of cod. However, with their stand-out 70% cod content and 
their remarkably flavoursome, stridently crunchy crumb (nicely browned, deeply 
savoury, sparky with vinegar and pepper), these are, by far, the best in this 
test. These fingers get a thumbs-up.
