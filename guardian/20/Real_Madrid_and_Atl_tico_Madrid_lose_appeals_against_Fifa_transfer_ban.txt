Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> have lost their appeals 
against transfer bans which were imposed on them for breaching rules on signing 
non-Spanish under-18 players, Fifa announced on Thursday.

The decision by Fifa’s appeal committee means that neither club can register 
players during the next two transfer windows and will have to wait until 
January 2018 to make any new signings.

The bans were initially imposed by Fifa’s disciplinary committee in January, 
but were temporarily lifted pending appeals, allowing them to sign any players 
in the transfer window that ended last month.

A statement said the appeal committee had decided to “confirm in their 
entirety the decisions rendered by the Fifa disciplinary committee in the 
respective cases relating to the protection of minors.” Fifa also maintained 
fines of 900,000 Swiss francs (£696,000) on Atlético and CHF 360,000 onReal

Both clubs, who have denied wrongdoing, have also been issued with a reprimand 
and a warning and given 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all 
minor players concerned.

Real and Atlético met in the final of this year’s Champions League with Real 
winning on penalties

 after a 1-1 draw.

Fifa said that its rules, which ban international transfers of under-18 
players except in certain circumstances, existed to “protect minors who move to 
other countries and prevent soccer clubs from exploiting them”.Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> says that, in the past, trafficking 
of young players has led to some minors being virtually abandoned on the 
streets of foreign countries.

“Although Fifa’s approach may appear harsh in an individual case, it is only 
by enforcing the rules consistently and strictly that the abuses of the past 
can be avoided and a proper and safe development of minor players secured,” 
Fifa said.

Fifa received 2,716 applications for the transfer of minors in 2015, of which 
393 were rejected, it said.
