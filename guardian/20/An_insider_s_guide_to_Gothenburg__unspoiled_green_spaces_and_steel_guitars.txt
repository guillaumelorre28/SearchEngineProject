An unspoiled west coast pearl.

Sound of the city

The cry of a steel guitar – Gothenburg is bustling with talented musicians. 
This is the sound ofMovienite <https://soundcloud.com/movieniteband>, just one 
of the amazing up-and-coming local bands.

 Masthuggskyrkan church is symbolic of Gothenburg architecture. Photograph: 
Mikael Andersson 


Masthuggskyrkan is a church in the district of Masthugget Majorna, one of the 
most charismatic and creatively progressive areas of the city. The church 
occupies a prominent position in the city – both physically, as it sits high on 
a hill, and in terms of its design, which represents the national romantic 
style of Nordic architecture.

Designed by Sigfrid Ericson in 1914 – who also had a hand in creating the 
city’s art hall – its tower stands 200ft high. Looking out from this hilltop 
over the traditionally working class areas that stretch along the harbourside 
is a true Gothenburg experience.

 One of the rugs by Jonathan ‘Ollio’ Josefsson 
The town hero is street artist Jonathan “Ollio” Josefsson 
<http://ollio.tumblr.com/>, who makes astonishingly beautiful tufted rugs from 
his graffiti art and is one of a handful of hardworking artists jazzing up the 
city’s reputation. Despite gallery exhibitions and art shows, you will still 
find Ollio’s work where it began, on the city’s streets and down its back 
alleys.

The look on the street

How green is your city?

Gothenburg is a bike-friendly city 
<http://www.wired.com/2015/06/copenhagenize-worlds-most-bike-friendly-cities/>. 
Last year, for instance,the urban transport administration introduced a pilot 
project involving electric bikes 
<http://forlivochrorelse.se/gothenburg-city-introduces-electric-bike-partnership/>
, and most people jump on their bicycles even when it’s raining horizontally. 
There’s also a lot of interest in ecological grocery shopping, with dedicated 
organic and holistic stores popping up across the city. The shops are filled 
with locally produced greens and brown paper bags to reduce unnecessary plastic 
packaging.

 Gothenburg’s green spaces … ideal for taking your shoes off. Photograph: Per 
Nadén 
West of Slottskogen park, an enchanting mountain ridge of green parkland, you 
will find the Azalea valley. While Slottskogen is popular with families and 
friends from the city who gather to have barbecues and play sports, deeper into 
the valley you will find far fewer people, especially if you get there early. 
It’s a little tricky to find but well worth the search – a lonely bench among 
the blossom trees is a perfect spot for serene meditation.

Moment in history

“Här ska staden ligga!” (“Here! The city should be placed here!”), King Gustav 
II Adolf hollered in 1621, and so Gothenburg was built on a mud pile. Located 
on both sides of the Göta river, with civilisation and woodland spreading along 
each wing, it’s now the second largest city inSweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden>. In the central square stands a 
bronze statue commemorating the moment King Gustav founded the city – his hand 
points down to the ground, but he gazes dreamily into the horizon.

 Seafood, dancing and black sheep in the west coast archipelago. Photograph:

You will seldom have such easy access to something as stunning as the west 
coast archipelago. Take the number nine or eleven tram out to Saltholmen (the 
salt islet), step out, and it’s all there. Even the tram ride itself is a 
pleasure.

Once you arrive, walk down to the little booth by the water, get yourself a 
fika with a traditional cinnamon role 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/dec/18/gothenburg-cosy-coffee-shops> 
and a Trocadero – a Swedish apple and orange-flavoured soft drink. From there, 
take the ferry boat to one of the beautiful islands and try the local seafood 
taverns, get to know the local black sheep and experience some traditional 
dancing.
