’s house is well disguised. It lies behind a high stone wall in the centre of 
Grantchester, the little village outside Cambridge that has long been a 
favourite with students on a pre-pub stroll. Visitors enter through a little 
gate into a sprawling, slightly overgrown garden that surrounds the whole 
house. Blumenfeld’s sculptures stand in leafy corners. On a hot August day it 
feels as if an ancient temple is being disturbed.

Blumenfeld is one of the most respected sculptors of her generation, regarded 
by some as the heir to Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Her marbles and 
bronzes are more abstracted than those of her artistic forebears, and they 
stand in prominent locations around the UK. A new exhibition will see a large 
piece unveiled in Canary Wharf, London, later this month.

For someone with such burnished credentials, however, the artist in person is 
welcoming and friendly. “Welcome to the only 15-bedroom one-bedroom house I 
know,” she says. “Originally it had six. But we have knocked some through and 
most of the rest have become studies.” The hallway is double height and 
beautifully lit by a large window above the front door. Underfoot is a 
monochrome tiled floor. “We pulled up two layers of linoleum and found this 
original floor, which had been there for hundreds of years” she says. “It’s 
amazing what people do.”

Born and raised in New York, Blumenfeld moved to the house in Grantchester in 
1970 with her husband Yorick, a writer, and their two then-young sons, Remy and 
Jared. Remy is now a TV producer, Jared an environmentalist.

“We bought it from King’s College [Cambridge],” she adds. “We wanted the boys 
to go to school here.” There is no mistaking the accumulated clutter of decades 
arranged on the walls and shelves – thousands of books, artefacts from trips to 
Mexico and New Guinea.

“I don’t really believe in possessions,” she says. “But my husband’s family 
were driven out by the Holocaust, so he has a different relationship to things. 
He can’t leave the house without 10 suitcases.”

Much of her work is concerned with the Holocaust, with root-like shapes 
seeming to vanish into smoke or blossoming into flower, depending on your 
perspective. In contrast to her husband’s hoarding she says she prefers a 
minimalist aesthetic, and the studio in Italy where she works for several 
months of the year is refreshingly uncluttered.

 Take a seat: the comfortable sitting room with its view over the garden.

To the left of the hallway is the dining room, painted in shades of deep red 
to match an oil painting that hangs in one corner – a self-portrait of Yorick’s 
father, Erwin, a famous photographer who was once accused of being a sell-out, 
hence the red-light-district hues. It’s the oldest part of the house, dating 
from 1490 – the rest of the house is 18th century – although in the far corner 
is a modern enhancement: a discreet lift, which Yorick and Helaine use to 
transport sculptures and books upstairs. On the other side of the hallway is a 
sitting room, with one of Blumenfeld’s pieces on display in the window. “Even 
on a dark day you get a wonderful sense of translucency,” she says.

An airy conservatory running alongside Blumenfeld’s kitchen serves as her 
studio. It is reminiscent of Hepworth’s space in St Ives, now a museum. 
Completed pieces vie with works-in-progress for shelf space. A lock on the door 
allowed her to work while her children were banging on the door. “I’m afraid I 
wasn’t a very good mother at times,” she says, recounting a time when one of 
her sons ran in and attacked a work in progress like a jealous lover.

Back in the garden she points out things that the casual observer might not 
notice: a sculpture that was stolen in 2005 before being recovered by police 
two years later. A treehouse where Yorick wrote his first novel. The huge 
Lebanon cedar tree from which the house gets its name. The front lawn, which is 
said to be stalked at Christmas by the ghost of a young woman, a former owner’s 
mistress who was thrown out into the snow.

“I wouldn’t mind having a little place in London when we get older, but we 
could never sell this place,” Blumenfeld says. “It has been a wonderful family 
home. Even with the ghost.”
