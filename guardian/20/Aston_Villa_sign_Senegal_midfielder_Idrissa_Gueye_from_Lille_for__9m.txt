Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> will sign 
Idrissa Gueye from Lille in a deal worth about £9m after the Senegal 
international, a defensive midfielder, completed a medical and agreed personal 
terms with the Midlands club.

Marseille made a late attempt to hijack the transfer but the 25-year-old was 
keen to come to the Premier League and Tim Sherwood convinced him that Villa 
was the right place for his development.

The deal is subject to Gueye being granted a work permit but it is not 
anticipated that there will be any problems. Gueye, who joinedLille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> at the age of 13 and played more 
than 130 games for the club in Ligue 1, flew into Birmingham for talks on 
Thursday and it is understood that any doubts he had about moving to Villa were 
allayed after he spoke to Sherwood.

Villa’s manager has already signed Micah Richards on a free transfer from 
Manchester City this summer and remains keen to strengthen other areas in his 
squad.
