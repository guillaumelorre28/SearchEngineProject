Wolverhampton Wanderers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolves> have 
made a complaint to Walsall and the Football Association after Carl Ikeme and 
George Elokobi reported racial abuse from home fans at Saturday's League One 
match at Banks's Stadium, which Wolves won 3-0.

The goalkeeper Ikeme and the defender Elokobi reported the abuse, which 
allegedly occurred in two separate incidents, to Wolves' management staff.

A statement from Wolves read: "The complaint relates to a small number of 
individuals in the crowd and will not sour the good relationship that exists 
between the two clubs.

"Both Wolves and Walsall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/walsall> are 
fiercely committed to stamping out all types of discrimination within football 
and will vigorously investigate all allegations of racist abuse.

"Wolves will always strongly support its players who are the victims of 
discrimination, and Carl Ikeme and George Elokobi both displayed admirable 
restraint in the face of receiving the abuse on Saturday."
