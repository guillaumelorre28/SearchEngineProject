February

 on a deal until the end of the season and after guiding them to Championship 
safety, the two parties discussed an extension over the last couple of weeks.

However, they have been unable to agree a new contract and Warnock will now 
leave the club along with first-team coaches Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson.

A club statement read: “Following lengthy and protracted discussions over the 
past two weeks,Rotherham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rotherham> 
United can confirm that Neil Warnock will not be the manager of the club going 
forward.

“We would like to place on record our thanks to Neil and his support staff for 
the 16 games that they led the team at the end of the 2015-16 campaign, and 
wish Neil, Kevin and Ronnie health and happiness for the future.

“We will be looking to release details of a new managerial appointment in due 
course.”

Warnock has written himself into Millers folklore for the job he performed in 
his 16-game stint, which sees him become the shortest serving manager in the 
club’s history.

After three games of his reign, his side were six points adrift from safety 
and staring relegation in the face until he masterminded a 10-game unbeaten 
run, which saw them move 10 points clear of the drop zone and secure their 
place in the second tier.

The former QPR and Crystal Palace manager enjoyed his return to the game and 
recently confirmed he would have one more year of management.

However, that will not be at the New York Stadium, despite Millers chairman 
Tony Stewart offering him a healthy contract.

The Millers will now look for a third manager in seven months.
