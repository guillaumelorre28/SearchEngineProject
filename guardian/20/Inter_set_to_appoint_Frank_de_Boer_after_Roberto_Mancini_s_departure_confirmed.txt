“FC Internazionale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale> 
Milano announces that it has reached an agreement for the termination of the 
contract with the coach Roberto Mancini,” a club statement read.

“The club would like to thank Roberto for his work since he accepted the post 
in November 2014. Last season the team was leading theSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> until the winter break, 
finishing the season in fourth place and qualifying directly for the group 
stage of the Uefa Europa League. We wish to thank Roberto for his commitment 
and professionalism demonstrated against the club in the last 20 months of 
work.”

De Boer, who guided Ajax to four Eredivisie titles in six seasons as manager, 
is likely to be unveiled this week. It will be his first job outside of the 
Netherlands. He had been linked with moves to Everton and Southampton this 
summer but Ronald Koeman moved from St Mary’s to Goodison Park and Claude Puel 
took over at St Mary’s.
