Bayern Munich re-established a 17-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> but were made to work 
hard for the points at strugglingHoffenheim.

A solitary goal from Mario Gomez late in the first half was enough for Bayern 
to take the spoils and leave Hoffenheim five points adrift of a relegation 
play-off berth and 11 away from safety with 10 games remaining.

Bayern had to wait until the 38th minute before making the breakthrough. Igor 
de Camargo gave away possession cheaply and Jerome Boateng's cross was headed 
back by Franck Ribéry to Gomez, who beat Heurelho Gomes with his first real 
attempt on goal of the afternoon.

Ivan Klasnic scored his first Bundesliga goal in almost five years as Mainz 
earned a 1-1 draw from their trip toFortuna Düsseldorf. The former Bolton 
forward, who was included in the Mainz starting XI for the first time this 
season, brought Thomas Tuchel's side level before half-time after a Bo Svensson 
own-goal had put the hosts in front early on.

Fortuna arguably enjoyed the better chances of the game but they were unable 
to find a way through as they picked up a rare draw to edge seven points clear 
of the relegation zone.

The draw moves Mainz to within two points of the top six and goes some way 
towards making up for their midweek defeat by Freiburg in the DFB-Pokal.
