Thursday

I loved Simon Stone’s version of The Wild Duck at the Barbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/27/the-wild-duck-review-ibsen-simon-stone>
 in London in 2014. Now he turns his attention to Federico García Lorca’sYerma 
<http://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/yerma>, which is at the Young Vic from 
tonight and relocates the story to contemporary London. It stars Billie Piper. 
The Watermill’s Watership Down was lovely, so let’s hope the Newbury venue can 
deliver again with the Gershwin musicalCrazy for You 
<https://www.watermill.org.uk/crazy_for_you>. The future of British politics is 
the timely subject of Powder Keg’s Morale Is High (Since We Gave Up Hope), 
which predicts the future between now and the 2020 UK election – it’s atthe 
Bureau Centre for the Arts <http://bureaublackburn.co.uk/event/609/> in 
Blackburn tonight andFuel Café <http://fuelcafebar.tumblr.com/> in Withington 
on Saturday. Diary of a Madman previews atthe Gate 
<http://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/events/all-productions/diary_of_a_madman> before 
heading tothe Traverse in Edinburgh 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/diary-of-a-madman>.

Friday and the weekend

The National Theatre’s outdoor programme of free events is sorely missed, but 
today sees the return of its river stage in the first offive weekends of dance, 
music and performance 
<https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/river-stage-weekends> in partnership 
with Latitude, Mayfest and others – this weekend east London alternative 
cabaret the Glory fills the stage. The Rivals joins the rep at theTheatre by 
the Lake in Keswick 
<http://www.theatrebythelake.com/production/14599/The-Rivals>, which also 
includes Rona Munro’s excellent Iron and Anne Carson’s version of Elektra.
