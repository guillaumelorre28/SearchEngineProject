The 31-year-old also drove Los Blancos towards success in the Champions 
League, netting 16 goals en route to the final as well as slotting in the 
winning penalty from the shoot-out.

Ronaldo has previously won the Ballon d’Or three times, the last in 2014 when 
it had been merged with theFifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> 
world player of the year accolade.

Messi will be looking to repeat last year’s success when he again beat Ronaldo 
to the individual title, which was his fourth win since 2010 and fifth overall.

The Argentinian playmaker, 29, helped guide Barcelona to another domestic 
league and cup double in 2015-2016, scoring 41 goals in all competitions.

The 23-strong list was trimmed down following votes by captains and coaches of 
national teams, select members of the media and fans voting on Fifa.com.

The winner will be announced in Zurich on 9 January.

Ranieri is joined in the best men’s coach shortlist by the Portugal manager, 
Fernando Santos, and Real Madrid’s Zinedine Zidane.

The 65-year-old Italian guided Leicester to a shock Premier League triumph 
last season, having been 5,000-1 outsiders for the title.

Santos steered Portugal to success at Euro 2017 with a 1-0 victory over hosts 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, while former player 
Zidane guided Los Blancos to 2016 Champions League glory after stepping up from 
his role as reserve-team coach.

The nominees for the best women’s player award are Germany’s Melanie 
Behringer, who helped her country win gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Carli 
Lloyd of the US, the women’s world player of the year for 2015, along with 
Brazil captain Marta.
