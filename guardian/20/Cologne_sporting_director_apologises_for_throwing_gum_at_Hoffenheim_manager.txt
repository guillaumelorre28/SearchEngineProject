The incident happened after Hoffenheim equalised in the 90th minute through 
Kevin Volland while Cologne’s Lukas Klünter was lying injured on the pitch. 
Schmadtke and the coach, Peter Stöger, jumped up in fury before the former took 
a chewing gum out of his mouth and threw it in the direction of the 28-year-old 
Nagelsmann.

The chewing gum missed but Schmadtke still apologised afterwards. “Yes, I 
threw it. It was a reaction. I have already phoned up the Hoffenheim sporting 
director, Alexander Rosen, and apologised. I am sorry.”

The point took Hoffenheim out of the bottom three of the Bundesliga. Cologne 
are currently 11th, six points ahead.
