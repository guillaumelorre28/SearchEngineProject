The first half wasn’t up to much, if truth be told. But from the moment the 
referee blew his whistle and handed Southampton a penalty everything got 
significantly more interesting. The second half was excellently entertaining. 
Van Dijk was excellent once again, Tadic took some fine set pieces, and
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> for all their 
changes dominated the game and deserved to win it.

Anyway, enough about me. Virgin Val Dijk has just had a quick chat to BT Sport:

The most important thing is it is well deserved. I think we played some good 
football. Same story as in Milan, but there we didn’t reward ourselves with a 
win. Today we did. Every corner kick we had, I got pulled a lot. These days 
it’s part of the game. I told the ref every time, he needs to watch him. 
Unlucky we didn’t get a penalty, but we won the game so it doesn’t matter any 
more.

And so did Sam McQueen:

I saw him, some players do it these days, digging up the penalty spot. I went 
over to try and stop him and he gave me an elbow in the jaw. I felt we were 
unlucky they didn’t get a red card. It’s fantastic that it’s in our hands. If 
we win the next two games we’re through.

90 mins: That looked close. Redmond rolls his man, spins and plays in Austin, 
who tries to go round the goalkeeper, fails to score and is anyway offside.

85 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> keep

take on Nagatomo, fails, falls over, and is very generously given a free kick.

83 mins: Inter bring on Felipe Melo for Gnoukouri, and then give the ball to 
Redmond, who runs from his own half to the edge of the area and still manages

73 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> want a 
third. Ward-Prowse’s shot from the edge of the area is blocked, and Ranocchia 
will have another chance to foul Van Dijk. Before the corner, though, Eder 
comes on and Medel goes off.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
4:23 - There were just four minutes and 23 seconds between both Southampton 
goals. Turnaround.

GOAL! Southampton 2-1 Inter!

Tadic crosses from the left, low and hard, and it’s deflected by one defender 
into the knee of another – Nagatomo – and ends up in the net!

68 mins: Inter are reeling, but Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> need to make sure they don’t 
get carried away by their current dominance. The Italians have a good chance to 
break, but Perisic curls his pass beyond his team-mates and into Forster’s arms.

GOAL! Southampton 1-1 Inter!

Van Dijk equalises! It’s another corner, which is headed into the air, touched 
back into the centre, loopily half-volleyed by Romeu over Handanovic and into 
the bar, and rebounds to Van Dijk, whose task is straightforward.

Before the spot kick Candreva slyly, deliberatly and repeatedly scuffed the 
penalty spot before the kick was taken, and McQueen ran into the area to stop 
him. Candreva then elbowed him in the face, and should have been booked for 
ungentlemanly conduct – or whatever you call spot-scuffage – and then sent off 
for violent conduct.

A very ordinary half of football is crowned with some extraordinary stoppage 
time. Inter have done very little but lead;Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have had plenty of 
possession but created little. The penalty award seemed very generous – though 
they should have had one sooner – but the home side couldn’t make the most of 
the gift.

Tadic's penalty is saved!

With the last kick of the half, Tadic shoots low to his right – it’s a rubbish 
penalty, impossible for Handanovic to miss if he goes the right way – and the 
ball is kicked away!

And now the players are fighting! There’s all sorts of pushing going on. 
Hojberg has a hand around his throat. Sam McQueen, having run into the area for 
little obvious reason, is rewarded with an elbow in the face. The referee takes 
his time, and then eventually books Candreva.

Southampton have a penalty!

45+1 mins: Tadic takes it, it’s half-cleared, and as the ball bounces around 
Perisic accidentally elbows it into the ground. The referee points to the spot!

Here’s our match report from St Mary’s. Bye!

Yuto Nagatomo own goal gives Southampton win against Internazionale

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/southampton-internazionale-europa-league-match-report> 
The first half wasn’t up to much, if truth be told. But from the moment the 
referee blew his whistle and handed Southampton a penalty everything got 
significantly more interesting. The second half was excellently entertaining. 
Van Dijk was excellent once again, Tadic took some fine set pieces, and
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> for all their 
changes dominated the game and deserved to win it.

Anyway, enough about me. Virgin Val Dijk has just had a quick chat to BT Sport:

The most important thing is it is well deserved. I think we played some good 
football. Same story as in Milan, but there we didn’t reward ourselves with a 
win. Today we did. Every corner kick we had, I got pulled a lot. These days 
it’s part of the game. I told the ref every time, he needs to watch him. 
Unlucky we didn’t get a penalty, but we won the game so it doesn’t matter any 
more.

And so did Sam McQueen:

I saw him, some players do it these days, digging up the penalty spot. I went 
over to try and stop him and he gave me an elbow in the jaw. I felt we were 
unlucky they didn’t get a red card. It’s fantastic that it’s in our hands. If 
we win the next two games we’re through.

They don’t have time to take it! Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have turned this around in 
the second half, and they’ve only gone and won!
 
90+5 mins: Into stoppage time at the end of stoppage time, and Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have a corner.
 
90+4 mins: Less than a minute to play, and Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have another free kick, on 
the edge of their own half, after D’Ambrosio is punished for pushing Redmond 
over.
 
90+2 mins: Halfway through stoppage time, and Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have a free kick on the 
half-way line.
 
90+1 mins: We’ll have four minutes of stoppage time, and it starts with 
Miranda and Ward-Prowse being booked for some off-the-ball high-jinks.
 
90 mins: That looked close. Redmond rolls his man, spins and plays in Austin, 
who tries to go round the goalkeeper, fails to score and is anyway offside.

88 mins: A final roll of the dice for Inter, who take Candreva off and bring 
on Biabiany.
 
85 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> keep 
the ball well on the right. Davis wins a throw-in, and then Hjobjerg tries to 
take on Nagatomo, fails, falls over, and is very generously given a free kick.
 
83 mins: Inter bring on Felipe Melo for Gnoukouri, and then give the ball to 
Redmond, who runs from his own half to the edge of the area and still manages 
to produce a fine shot.
 
82 mins: Eder’s cross from the left is all but gift-wrapped and bow-topped for 
a big striker to head in, but somehow nobody does.
 
79 mins: Hmm, dangerous. The ball is carelessly presented to Icardi, in the 
middle of theSouthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> 
half, and his ferocious low drive is beaten away by Forster.
 
78 mins: It seems Puel wants to Italy this, playing now with five men in 
midfield and switching them to protection mode.
 
77 mins: A substitution for the home side, who take off Tadic and bring on 
Steven Davis.
 
74 mins: From the short corner, Tadic swings in a lovely right-footed cross 
and Redmond’s flicked header flies wide.
 
73 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> want a 
third. Ward-Prowse’s shot from the edge of the area is blocked, and Ranocchia 
will have another chance to foul Van Dijk. Before the corner, though, Eder 
comes on and Medel goes off.

4:23 - There were just four minutes and 23 seconds between both Southampton 
goals. Turnaround.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/794292614216511488>  
71 mins: The Saints are very much marching in again, the St Mary’s crowd 
informs me.
 
Tadic crosses from the left, low and hard, and it’s deflected by one defender 
into the knee of another – Nagatomo – and ends up in the net!

Nagatomo. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters  
68 mins: Inter are reeling, but Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> need to make sure they don’t 
get carried away by their current dominance. The Italians have a good chance to 
break, but Perisic curls his pass beyond his team-mates and into Forster’s arms.
 
Van Dijk equalises! It’s another corner, which is headed into the air, touched 
back into the centre, loopily half-volleyed by Romeu over Handanovic and into 
the bar, and rebounds to Van Dijk, whose task is straightforward.

Keogh/Reuters  
64 mins: Double oooh! Tadic takes the corner, Van Dijk for once isn’t 
violently impeded, and his thumping header is well saved.
 
63 mins: Ooh! Hojbjerg runs from the right, infield and towards the area, cuts 
back onto his right foot, and then shoots into a defender’s foot.
 
62 mins: Replays show that post-corner penalty-shout was another nailed-on 
certainty – the only penalty the referee has so far given is the least 
penaltyish of them all. Ranocchia, incidentally, is Italian for frog.
 
59 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> make 
their first change, bringing on Charlie Austin and taking off Jay Rodriguez.
 
56 mins: Southampton have a corner, Tadic sends it in, and Ranocchia and Van 
Dijk clash again. TheSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> defender goes over, the 
crowd howl once more, but the referee does nothing.
 
55 mins: Inter win a corner, from which Martina manages to clear the ball and 
take out two opponents simultaneously.
 
52 mins: Hojbjerg sets himself under a high ball, preparing to bring it down 
on his chest. Medel stops him, by leaping into his back and flattening him 
completely. The referee waves his yellow card.

Walton/Getty Images  
50 mins: And another! Again from outside the area, again from Ward-Prowse, but 
this is on target, and forces a fine save from Handanovic.
 
49 mins: Another shooting chance for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>, but Hojbjerg rushes his 
shot from 25 yards, which flies well over.
 
48 mins: Rodriguez has the ball, at least until Medel catches his ankle, and 
then Ranocchia takes out his legs. The referee waves play on.
 
47 mins: BT Sport report that Candreva was booked for unsportsmanlike 
behaviour, rather than violent conduct. It seems odd to have spotted the 
scuffage, but not the elbow.
 
46 mins: … and have their first shot on target 25 seconds later, a half-volley 
from Ward-Prowse that was struck with venom, but right down the middle and into 
Handanovic’s arms.
 
46 mins: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> get 
half two under way.
 
The players are coming back out. Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> can still win this, but must 
improve to do so.
 
None of them would have been more saveable than this one.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
3 - Samir Handanovic has saved all three penalties he has faced in the Europa 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> for Inter 
Milan. Unstoppable.
 <https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/794283622438146048> November 3, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/794283622438146048>  
Before the spot kick Candreva slyly, deliberatly and repeatedly scuffed the 
penalty spot before the kick was taken, and McQueen ran into the area to stop 
him. Candreva then elbowed him in the face, and should have been booked for 
ungentlemanly conduct – or whatever you call spot-scuffage – and then sent off 
for violent conduct.
 
A very ordinary half of football is crowned with some extraordinary stoppage 
time. Inter have done very little but lead;Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have had plenty of 
possession but created little. The penalty award seemed very generous – though 
they should have had one sooner – but the home side couldn’t make the most of 
the gift.
 
And that’s half time! 
 
With the last kick of the half, Tadic shoots low to his right – it’s a rubbish 
penalty, impossible for Handanovic to miss if he goes the right way – and the 
ball is kicked away!

And now the players are fighting! There’s all sorts of pushing going on. 
Hojberg has a hand around his throat. Sam McQueen, having run into the area for 
little obvious reason, is rewarded with an elbow in the face. The referee takes 
his time, and then eventually books Candreva.
