 Despite steadily increasing sales of television receiving apparatus, 
manufacturers are not happy. They are having a large number of complaints about 
the programmes sent out by the BBC. Criticism on the technical side is seldom 
adverse. Both transmitters and receivers are doing well and the pictures give 
pleasure when the material sent out is of good quality and suitable to the 
medium.
No one expected that the BBC would learn all its production lessons at once, 
but what was not anticipated was that there would be so large a proportion of 
films and so much repetition. Those who have already bought receivers say that 
a film is interesting once and tolerable twice, but when they have to look at 
it six times in succession, it becomes boring.

There are some associated with the industry who are already voicing the 
opinion that the future of television lies not in the home but as an adjunct to 
the cinema in big theatres. Their opinion has been strengthened by Mr JL Baird 
producing apparatus giving a picture 8ft by 6ft 6 in.
