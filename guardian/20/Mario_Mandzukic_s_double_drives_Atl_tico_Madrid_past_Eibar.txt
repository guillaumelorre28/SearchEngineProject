 with a 3-1 victory at Eibar.

Atlético’s Antoine Griezmann maintained his strong form to fire home the 
opener from a Raúl García pass after seven minutes.

The pitch looked like a quagmire in parts as a result of heavy rain but the 
champions adapted well and the combative Mandzukic knocked in a Griezmann cross 
from the left wing to make it 2-0 in the 23rd minute.

Two minutes later he seized on a loose ball in the area and drove it past the 
Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> goalkeeper Xabi Irureta.

The visitors were rarely threatened in the second half although Federico 
Piovaccari headed in an 89th-minute consolation goal.

Atlético are level on 47 points with second-placed Barcelona, who face 
Villarreal on Sunday. Real have 51 points.
