Barcelona have punished the club official who caused a stir with remarks about 
Lionel Messi <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lionel-messi> by sacking him.

Pere Gratacós, a former Barcelona B player, said following the Copa del Rey 
draw on Friday that it was Barcelona’s fellow big names who made Messi the 
player he is.

“Messi would not be as good without Iniesta, Neymar and co,” Gratacós said, 
according to the Spanish website Sport. “He’s the best, this is true.”

At a time when Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 
looking to keep Messi at the club on an extended contract, the comments 
apparently did not go down well. By the end of the day he had lost his job as 
the club’s head of sporting relations to the Spanish federation.

Barcelona said Gratacós would still have an undefined position with the club 
academy.

The club said in a statement: “FC Barcelona have dismissed Pere Gratacós as 
head of institutional sporting relations with the Royal Spanish Football 
Federation for having publicly expressed a personal opinion that does not match 
that of the club after the draw for the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey held 
today in Madrid.

“The decision has been taken by Albert Soler, director of professional sports, 
who will assume these functions directly from now on.”
