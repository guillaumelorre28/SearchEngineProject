Paris St-Germain came from behind to beat Toulouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/toulouse> 3-1 and make up ground in 
France on Sunday.

Toulouse took the lead when the midfielder Etienne Capoue headed home a corner 
in the 39th minute. PSG equalised in the 56th when France striker Kevin Gameiro 
outpaced the Toulouse defence to take a pass from Javier Pastore and chip 
goalkeeper Ali Ahamada.

Pastore then fed substitute Mevlüt Erding, who slipped the ball past Ahamada 
to give PSG the lead in the 90th minute. PSG winger Jérémy Ménez sealed the win 
by adding the third goal in the third minute of injury time.

"We played in the second half like a team that can win the French league 
title," Pastore said.

Big-spending PSG now trail leaders Montpellier by two points after four 
matches. "My team showed it has some guts," the PSG coach, Antoine Kombouaré, 
added. "I shook them up a bit at half-time, telling them we were not worthy in 
that first half to have big ambitions."

Sochaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sochaux> edged past Saint 
Etienne 2-1 as the Algeria midfielder Ryad Boudebouz put the hosts ahead with a 
low strike in the sixth minute.

Saint Etienne forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised in the 35th minute 
with a drive into the top corner.

Sochaux took the lead again in the 42nd minute when Boudebouz converted a 
penalty after full-back Sébastien Corchia had been fouled inside the area.

Saint Etienne went down to 10 men in the 65th when defender Paulão received a 
red card for fouling Sochaux forward Modibo Maiga, who was clean through on 
goal.

Rennes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes> beat Caen 3-2 where 
forward Razak Boukari opened the scoring for the hosts with a header after four 
minutes.

Caen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/caen> had a chance to level in the 
12th minute but Rennes goalkeeper Benoît Costil saved a penalty from M'Baye 
Niang after Jirès Kembo-Ekoko had fouled Alexandre Raineau.

Jonathan Pitroipa led a counterattack in the 41st minute, cutting the ball 
back for Kembo-Ekoko who doubled the lead for Rennes.

Rennes defender Kader Mangane made it 3-0 by flicking in from a corner from 
Julien Féret in the 45th.

Caen cut Rennes' lead to a goal in the second half as defender Thomas Heurtaux 
netted with a close-range header and Frédéric Bulot converted a cross from 
Jerry Vandam in the 61st minute.
