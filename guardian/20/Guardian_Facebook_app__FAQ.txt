What is the Guardian Facebook app?

The Guardian Facebook app <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/> is a great 
way of reading and sharing Guardian content within Facebook. Once you allow the 
app, whenever you follow Guardian links you'll be shown the content on a 
Facebook page. This lets you see what your friends are reading and watching, 
and what is popular amongst Facebook users. You will also be able to comment on 
and discuss articles with your friends, or with the whole Guardian community.

How can I try the Guardian Facebook app?

You can try the Guardian Facebook app <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian> 
directly by visitinghttp://apps.facebook.com/theguardian 
<http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian> and choosing the "Try the app now" 
option. You'll also come across it if you follow links to Guardian content 
posted by your Facebook friends.

Back to questions <>



Do I have to use the Guardian Facebook app in order to read Guardian articles?

No. You can still visit the Guardian site as normal and view, share and 
comment on articles the way you always have. Additionally, on any article 
within theGuardian Facebook app <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian>, there's 
a link at the top of the page to "View this story on the Guardian" which will 
take you to the main site.

Back to questions <>


Can I control who sees what I "Read"?

The Guardian Facebook app <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/> is a "social 
reading" environment. Within the app people will be able to see links to 
articles you have read and you will be able to see what they have been reading. 
We think this will help people discover content that they might be interested 
in. You can edit who can see your activity on your Facebook apps settings page.

 

When you start using the app, you'll also be asked who you want to share what 
you read with. You can change this at any time.

 

Sharing what you read only applies to articles within the Guardian Facebook 
app. Anything you read on the Guardian site itself willnot be shared with your 
Facebook friends unless you choose to do so through the normal "Recommend" or 
"Share" functionality.

Can I hide a "Read"?

You may not want to share the fact that you have read a particular article 
with your friends. When you first visit an article, video, gallery or audio 
clip within the app, you can simply click the "Remove from timeline" link.

This will remove the fact that you have read an article from the activity 
stream.

How do I remove the app?

There are two easy ways that you can stop using the application:

1) Click "Your app settings" at the top of any article. On this page you can 
deauthorise any Facebook application, including the Guardian's.

2) Visit the application homepage at http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian

I removed the app, how do I stop getting invited to use it again?

If you are asked to use the app again, just click 'Cancel', and we will set a 
cookie so that we try not to invite you again.

I removed the app, but now I'd like to try it again. Can I?

Yes. When you remove the app we set a cookie so that we try not to invite you 
again. To re-install the application, visit the homepage at
http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/>, 
and click the "Try the app now" button.

If I read a Guardian article within Facebook, can I still comment on the 
Guardian site?

If commenting is available on the Guardian website, you will see a link on the 
right-hand side of articles inviting you to join in the comment thread. 
Clicking this link will take you to the version of the same article on the 
Guardian website, where, provided you have a Guardian account and are signed 
in, you can comment as normal. If you haven't got a Guardian account, you can 
register and then comment. Registration is quick and free.

Back to questions <>



Do the Guardian's community guidelines apply to comments within Facebook?

No. The Guardian doesn't moderate comments on the Guardian application on 
Facebook <http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/> because it's a social 
experience governed by Facebook'scommunity standards 
<http://www.facebook.com/communitystandards>. If you spot something you think 
is problematic, you can report it. Find out more from Facebook's guide to
commenting on content <http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=201087386601310>. 

Back to questions <>



How is "Most popular" decided within the app?

The stories and content listed as most popular are the articles that have been 
viewed by a significant number of people within theGuardian Facebook app 
<http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/> environment within the last 24 hours.

How do I share the app with friends?

By sharing Guardian content on Facebook, you are automatically sharing the 
application with your friends. If they click a link to the Guardian website 
whilst within Facebook, they will be given the opportunity to opt-in to the 
application. Alternatively, you can share the address of the application 
homepage:http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/ 
<http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/>, or use the "Invite your friends" 
button within the app.

Back to questions <>



I'm not using the app, but my friends are. Can I hide what they are reading 
from my Facebook feeds?

Yes. Hover over one of the entries in the Facebook ticker showing what your 
friend has read, and it will reveal a "Hide all by The Guardian" option.

Does this application work on my phone?

Sorry, but at the present time, the Facebook Canvas App framework only works 
for desktop browsers.

Back to questions <>



Why can I only agree or disagree with some articles?

One of the features of the Guardian application on Facebook is that you can 
post to your timeline whether you agree or disagree with one of our articles.

At the present time this option is only available on a selection of comment 
pieces from the Comment is free and Sport sections of the website.

Back to questions <>



Does the app require that I use Facebook Timeline?

Yes. Adding the Guardian application will update your Facebook account to use 
the new Timeline feature.
