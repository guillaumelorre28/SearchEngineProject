Stoke City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stokecity>, now among the top 
30 richest clubs in the world, travel to the home of Rochdale, who have never 
been higher than English football’s third tier, although they have recently 
crept up to fifth place in League One. Keith Hill’s side knocked out Nottingham 
Forest in the last round so Mark Hughes will tell his Stoke team to be wary on 
what should be an invigorating Monday night of FA Cup football. Ryan Shawcross, 
who missed Stoke’s win at Leicester last week, could be back in the squad.
