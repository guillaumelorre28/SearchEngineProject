December 25
To all of us the familiar robin has been intimately associated with Christmas 
since childhood, and certainly when we scatter the fragments of Christmas fare 
for the birds to have their share the fearless, friendly robin is sure to get 
the first pick. It does not wait, like the sparrows and starlings, until the 
door is closed, but comes down trustfully before the scraps have left our 
hands. But the association with Christmas dates back long-before the days of 
holly-wreathedChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> 
cards in the centre of which an abnormally scarlet robin stood on snow. With 
another ruddy bird, the crossbill, the robin shares a legend of the Cross. The 
crossbill twisted its beak when striving to extract the nails, the robin worked 
at the thorns which pierced Christâ€™s brow; both birds were stained with blood 
and blessed for their merciful efforts, carrying the red breasts for ever as 
memorials of the deed. The good actions are not all legendary, for there are 
robins with our men in the trenches, bringing a home-touch where it is needed. 
Several of my friends have mentioned them, telling me how they come asking for 
a crumb or a bit of bully-beef, just as they beg with their bright eyes in the 
garden. The perky robin means more to the soldier than the sparrows, wagtails, 
chaffinches, or the kingfishers busy in the streams less than two miles behind 
the firing line; it comes as a confiding friend.
