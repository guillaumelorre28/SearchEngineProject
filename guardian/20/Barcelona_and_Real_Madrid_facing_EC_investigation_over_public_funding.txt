Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> and Barcelona 
are among seven Spanish clubs which are being investigated by the European 
Commission over public funding, it was confirmed on Wednesday.

Along with Real and Barcelona, who are the two most successful clubs in 
Spanish football, the Commission has also opened an inquiry into their fellow 
top-flight sides Valencia,Athletic Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao>, Osasuna and Elche. The 
Segunda División side Hercules are also under investigation as the Commission 
seeks to determine if state aid received by those clubs is in line with 
European Union regulations.

A Commission statement read: "The European Commission has opened three 
distinct in-depth investigations to verify whether various public support 
measures in favour of certain Spanish professional football clubs are in line 
with EU state aid rules." The Commission said it had concerns that the funding 
provided significant advantages to those sides to the detriment of other clubs 
which have to operate without such support.

Explaining what each of the seven clubs is being investigated for, the 
statement continued: "The Commission will firstly investigate possible tax 
privileges for Real Madrid,Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna. 
In another inquiry it will assess whether a widely reported land transfer 
between the city of Madrid and the club Real Madrid involved any state aid in 
favour of the club.

"Finally, it will examine the compliance with EU state aid rules of guarantees 
given by the State-owned Valencia Institute of Finance for loans that were used 
to finance the three Valencia clubs Valencia,Hercules 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hercules> and Elche, while those clubs 
were seemingly undergoing financial difficulties."

Joaquín Almunia, the Commission vice-president in charge of competition 
policy, said: "Professional football clubs should finance their running costs 
and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of 
the taxpayer. Member states and public authorities must comply with EU rules on 
state aid in this sector as in all economic sectors."
