, with the Algerian’s exploits earning him the PFA players’ player of the year 
award in April 2016.

beat last year’s winner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund into 
second place, while the Liverpool midfielder Sadio Mané came third.

Arsenal’s 20-year-old Nigeria winger Alex Iwobi was crowned the youth player 
of the year after enjoying a breakout season for club and country.

The striker Kelechi Iheanacho, who has scored 20 goals in 52 appearances for 
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, was 
named the most promising talent, an honour the 20-year-old received three years 
ago.
