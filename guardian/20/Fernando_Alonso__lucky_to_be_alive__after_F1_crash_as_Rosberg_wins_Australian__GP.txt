Fernando Alonso <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fernando-alonso> admitted 
he was lucky to be alive after the spectacular collision with Esteban 
Gutiérrez’s Haas which was the abiding image of the season’s opening grand prix 
here in Melbourne. As Alonso’s McLaren ploughed into a wall, then through a 
gravel trap and rolled through the air, spectators feared the worst.

Amid concern about Alonso’s wellbeing it went unnoticed initially that the 
accident would be the pivotal moment of the race, for it led to the red flag 
and safety car that prompted Ferrari’s tactical blunder that cost them their 
good chance of winning. Mercedes secured a one-two finish, Nico Rosberg winning 
from Lewis Hamilton.

Alonso walked away unscathed from his pulverized car with something 
approaching nonchalance, though that was not the way the Spaniard was thinking 
at the time.

“I am lucky to be here and thankful to be here,” said Alonso. “I am aware that 
today I spent some of the luck remaining in life. I want to thank McLaren and 
the FIA for the safety of this car. I am alive thanks to the job of the last 
10-15 years inFormula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone>.

“I was flying, so you see the sky then the ground, then the sky, then the 
ground. You want to stop but it doesn’t stop. It keeps going and going and 
going. It was quite scary, but at the last moment the car stopped and I had a 
little space to go out and I said: ‘I will go out quickly because my mother 
will be watching at home.”’

Alonso had clipped the rear of Gutiérrez at full speed while trying to pass 
around the outside. Both drivers were taken to the medical centre for 
assessment and given the all-clear. “I’m sure his marbles are rattled a little 
bit,” McLaren’s chairman, Ron Dennis, said of Alonso on Sky Sports. The 
stewards investigated the crash but found neither driver to be at fault.

The incident on the 17th lap brought a red flag and a delay of 20 minutes 
before the race restarted behind a safety car. It was only then that it became 
clear the damage was not only to the McLaren car but to the grand prix itself.

The Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen had burst past Hamilton 
and Rosberg at the start like a couple of drag racers. Hamilton, the world 
champion, failed to make the most of his 50th pole position. His was a slow and 
pensive start, in which was not only overtaken by the Ferrari pair but also by 
Rosberg, Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. He was suddenly sixth and did not 
improve on that until he went past Massa on the fourth lap.

When the race was red-flagged Mercedes went on to medium tyres but Ferrari 
continued to run supersoft rubber, which meant they would have to stop again 
before the end of the race.

Vettel was leading and to surrender his track position in a race such as this, 
where it is difficult to get past, was foolish. Mercedes, meanwhile, continued 
to plough on with their medium tyres, just as they had done so relentlessly 
during testing in Barcelona last month; they knew they could trust them.

Vettel said afterwards: “We went for the aggressive route. Maybe with 
hindsight we could have done something else, but I don’t want to blame anyone. 
It’s a shame the other car didn’t make it but it is positive.

“The team is in good shape, we know we can up our game and put pressure on 
these guys. You can argue the red flag didn’t help us.”

The Ferrari team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, said he had felt confident of 
victory before the red flag. “On the [pit]wall we were confident in all 
honesty. We were looking at our strategy prediction and we were quite 
comfortable.”

But then it all went wrong for the Scuderia. Raikkonen retired, his car in 
flames, while Vettel was unable to pull clear of Rosberg as he strived for the 
24-second lead that would have allowed him to come in and retain his advantage. 
Instead, he pitted on lap 35 of the 57 and Rosberg took the lead.

So Rosberg has started the new F1 season much as he finished the last, when he 
won the last three races. This was his 15th victory, and his second here in 
three years.

Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said: “Overall it’s a very happy moment. 
I’m very happy for Nico. I don’t think it’s a blow for Lewis because the pace 
was there and it was the start that compromised him. It will not be a big blow 
for him.”

Rosberg had had an indifferent weekend. He crashed his car in practice and was 
outclassed by Hamilton in qualifying. This race was handed to him, but it is 
difficult to argue with four straight wins.

He said: “It’s early days but it’s the perfect start. We have to keep an eye 
on the red guys. I was a bit worried when we restarted because I thought the 
tyres might be a bit cold.”

Hamilton took it rather well. “It was a great race and I loved the fact I had 
to come from far behind. This time last year I was 25 points behind, so seven 
behind feels good.”
