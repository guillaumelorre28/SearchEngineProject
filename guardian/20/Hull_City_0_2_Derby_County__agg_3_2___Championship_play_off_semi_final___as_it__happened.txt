The pitch floods with celebrating Hull fans. A few orange smoke bombs go off. 
Hey, no pyro, no party. The Hull players scamper down the tunnel, more in 
relief than joy. They weren’t very good tonight. Derby by contrast were 
relentless in attack. But the hosts dug in during the second half when they had 
to, and of course they were the better team in the first leg. Deserved winners, 
then, of a semi-final which had a very similar rhythm and narrative to the 
Sheffield Wednesday-Brighton affair. Commiserations toDerby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>, who like Brighton last 
night failed to complete a comeback but nevertheless did themselves proud. They 
too would have been a mighty fine addition to the Premier League. But it’s not 
to be. Meanwhile congratulations to Hull City, who are one day of Wembley 
wonder away from a place in next season’s Premier League. The final should be a 
blast! Hull or Wednesday? It’s too tough to call!
 Hull City fans invade the pitch after winning through to the final.

FULL TIME: Hull City 0-2 Derby County (agg 3-2)

And that’s that! Now it’s the turn of the Hull supporters to sing the 
“Sheffield Wednesday we’re coming for you” song! They’ve made the play-off 
final on Saturday week after a very nervous performance. But the tie was won in 
the first leg. Derby were magnificent tonight. But not quite magnificent enough.

90 min +4: Carson is nearly caught upfield as Hughes can’t get his shot away 
on the edge of the box. Clucas breaks up the right, but loses control with the 
goal unguarded.

90 min +3: A simple ball looped down the middle into the Hull box. Dawson, in 
a panic, heads backwards and out of play for a corner. That was unnecessary. 
Carson comes up for the set piece.

90 min: Derby move into the Hull half, but can’t get anything going in the 
final third. Hull holding their shape. The last throw of the dice for Derby, as 
Olsson is replaced by Camara. There will be four added minutes.

88 min: Hendrick rather clumsily bowls Meyler to the floor as the Hull man 
chases down the right. A free kick. The ball lands at the feet of Snodrass, who 
bowls down the inside-right channel and goes over in the environs of Hughes. A 
claim for a penalty, which the referee isn’t interested in. A clear dive.

82 min: Derby haven’t seen much of the ball in the last five minutes, so a 
period of possession in the middle of the park gives them a much-needed 
foothold back in the game. They also replace a knackered looking Russell with 
Darren Bent.

80 min: “Come on City! Come on City!” Another corner for the hosts down the 
right. Snodgrass takes. Davies bends down but flicks his header high over the 
bar from 12 yards. It’s been a decent spell for Hull, who despite it all are 
ten minutes (plus stoppages) away from Wembley.

79 min: Derby are beginning to look tired, having put in so much effort. 
Shackell takes down a long ball, and has a simple clearance to make, but 
fresh-airs the kick and lets the ball run out of play for a corner. Thankfully, 
from the big defender’s perspective, the set piece comes to nothing.

77 min: This is a bit better from the home team. Snodgrass skitters down the 
left, reaches the byline, and sees his low cross whistle back past his lugs by 
Shackell. A throw deep in Derby territory the only reward, and it leads to 
nothing. But they’re still leading this semi-final on aggregate, and time’s 
running out forDerby County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>.

73 min: Martin, on the edge of the D, takes a pass from Ince, out on the left. 
Ince cuts inside and picks up a flicked return, and is about to shoot when 
Davies clatters him in the legal style. What a challenge! Hull looked to have 
been opened up there.

71 min: Keogh strides forward and plays a fine ball down the inside-left 
channel for Ince, who would have got a shot away had he made for the box in a 
straight line. But he chooses to cut inside, and has to make do with a corner 
instead. No matter, because it very nearly leads to a goal, Martin picking up 
the ball with his back to goal on the left-hand corner of the box, turning and 
curling one towards the top right. It’s heading in, brilliantly, but it’s met 
by a strong fist from Jakupovic. Marvellous save!

69 min: Derby knock it around the middle of the park awhile. Eventually Hughes 
takes up possession, drops a shoulder, and has a look from 25 yards. It’s high 
and wide. But Derby are pressing, and pressing hard. They don’t appear to be in 
the mood to spend the summer wondering.

67 min: Martin strokes a ball down the inside-left channel. Ince takes it 
down, and looks to make good towards the box. He’s crowded out by Dawson. He 
should have laid the ball off to his right, where Russell was in space. Hull 
don’t look comfortable at all. The KC is bubbling and boiling with nervous 
tension. This is superlative entertainment. It could go either way. You can’t 
take your eye off it for a second. And other clichés.

66 min: Derby are doing their best to stretch Hull this way and that. Christie 
bombs down the right and crosses deep. So deep that Olsson has to stretch to 
keep it in on the left. Olsson then curls high to the far post. Jakupovic rises 
to claim.

64 min: Derby are on the front foot again. Hughes probes with baroque intent 
down the right. He can’t quite prise Hull open. Then Ince has a crack from 25

63 min: Hull are going direct. Now Diame takes the ball down and powers with 
extreme prejudice down the middle. He shoots from long range, the ball bobbling 
harmlessly wide right of Carson’s goal.

61 min: A long hoof down the middle of the park by Hull. Hernandez dummies and 
very nearly releases Snodgrass on goal. It would have been that simple. But 
Shackell extends a leg and pokes the ball back to the keeper, just when 
Snodgrass’s eyes were widening.

60 min: Weimann has jarred his knee. A shame, because he’s played very well 
tonight. He’s replaced by Tom Ince who, having been dropped, has spent most of 
the evening sitting on the bench with a face on. Now’s his chance to walk it 
like he’s sulked it.

59 min: Hughes and Hendrick combine well down the right. Some intricate 
dribbling. Hull afraid to put the foot in. Hendrick then loops towards the far 
post for Martin, but there’s a little too much juice on the cross. Derby are 
desperate for the equalising goal in this tie, but they’re not playing 
desperate football. They’ve been very easy on the eye tonight.

57 min: Hernandez, on the left-hand corner of the Derby box, chests down a 
long throw, turns, and lashes a fine dipping effort towards the top right. Not 
quite, but full marks for ambition.

55 min: Another lull in proceedings, which once again should do Hull a favour. 
Derby still look the sharper side. “I’ll see your Hull city centre in 1969 and 
raise youBury town centre in 1965 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyyDsHHYW8k>
,” writes Phil Thorp. “A far better production if I may be so bold. Oh, and if 
you’re looking for a link, Hull knocked the mighty Shakers out of the FA Cup 
this season and we beat Derby County 6-0 in the highest scoring FA Cup final in 
1903.”

53 min: Hernandez tries a snapshot from 20 yards. It smacks Keogh in the face. 
Odubajo picks up the rebound, and takes the opportunity to go over a leg hung 
out by Hughes. Street smart, and a free kick in a dangerous position. Snodgrass 
makes a play straight out of Martin’s big book, smashing the set piece straight 
into the wall. What a waste.

50 min: Hughes comes straight at Hull down the centre, yet again. Odubajo has 
no option but to tug him back, on the edge of the D. He’s booked, and it’s a 
free kick in a very, very dangerous position.

48 min: Derby should be level! Martin dribbles down the left, then slides 
Weimann further along the flank. Weimann enters the box and centres low and 
hard towards Bryson, six yards out. Bryson must score! But he can’t get his 
legs working properly, allowing the ball to smack him in the troosers. Weimann 
tries to recycle the rebound, shooting form a tight angle. But it’s wide, and 
he’s offside. What a chance for Bryson!

47 min: Elmohamady powers down the right, the most direct Hull dribble of the 
evening so far. He ends up crossing deep towards Diame, but Keogh heads clear 
without fuss. Then Odubajo has a go from the same flank, but Carson snaffles 
that one. Much better from the Tigers already.

And we're off again!

Two down, then, just the one to go. Can Derby really pull this off? Remember: 
no team has ever come back from three goals down in a two-legged play-off 
rubber. If they keep playing like they did in the first half, anything’s 
possible. Especially if Hull don’t raise their own game. The home side will 
have received some beneficial advice from Steve Bruce during the break, I’ll be 
bound, and in the trenchant style to boot. So they should come out with renewed 
purpose. Derby get the ball rolling again.

HALF TIME: Hull City 0-2 Derby County (agg 3-2)

A free kick for Hull out on the right. Snodgrass sends it straight through the 
Derby box. And that’s that for the first half. Well, well, well. “Sheffield 
Wednesday, we’re coming for you,” sing the away support. Derby still need one 
more goal to level things up, of course. Probably worth mentioning now that 
away goals matter not in this tournament. For some reason it didn’t seem that 
important earlier. It certainly does now! It’s going to be some second half. No 
flipping!
 A great half for Derby and Darren Wassall. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters

opts to float his cross into the area, allowing Jakupovic to gently pluck the 
ball from the sky.

43 min: A break in play with Olsson down, the Derby left back having taken a 
knee in the back from Elmohamady. Entirely accidental. It looks as if he’ll be 
OK; there are smiles. Hull happy to see the clock tick round towards the 
45-minute mark.

41 min: Hughes embarks on another trademark dribble, this time down the left. 
He eventually runs out of space, and it’s a goal kick, but once again Hull were 
in a defensive panic. This is a collective breakdown. They need to find their 
equilibrium. Half time can’t come soon enough.

relief than joy. They weren’t very good tonight. Derby by contrast were 
relentless in attack. But the hosts dug in during the second half when they had 
to, and of course they were the better team in the first leg. Deserved winners, 
then, of a semi-final which had a very similar rhythm and narrative to the 
Sheffield Wednesday-Brighton affair. Commiserations toDerby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>, who like Brighton last 
night failed to complete a comeback but nevertheless did themselves proud. They 
too would have been a mighty fine addition to the Premier League. But it’s not 
to be. Meanwhile congratulations to Hull City, who are one day of Wembley 
wonder away from a place in next season’s Premier League. The final should be a 
blast! Hull or Wednesday? It’s too tough to call!

And that’s that! Now it’s the turn of the Hull supporters to sing the 
“Sheffield Wednesday we’re coming for you” song! They’ve made the play-off 
final on Saturday week after a very nervous performance. But the tie was won in 
the first leg. Derby were magnificent tonight. But not quite magnificent enough.
 
90 min +5: Snodgrass is replaced by Maguire, clock management at its finest.
 
90 min +4: Carson is nearly caught upfield as Hughes can’t get his shot away 
on the edge of the box. Clucas breaks up the right, but loses control with the 
goal unguarded.
 
90 min +3: A simple ball looped down the middle into the Hull box. Dawson, in 
a panic, heads backwards and out of play for a corner. That was unnecessary. 
Carson comes up for the set piece.
 
90 min +2: Diame is replaced by Clucas. 
 
90 min +1: Martin loops in a cross from the left, but there are no blue shirts 
in the box. Quite understandably, Martin wants to know where the hell everyone 
is at this late stage.
 
90 min: Derby move into the Hull half, but can’t get anything going in the 
final third. Hull holding their shape. The last throw of the dice for Derby, as 
Olsson is replaced by Camara. There will be four added minutes.
 
88 min: Hendrick rather clumsily bowls Meyler to the floor as the Hull man 
chases down the right. A free kick. The ball lands at the feet of Snodrass, who 
bowls down the inside-right channel and goes over in the environs of Hughes. A 
claim for a penalty, which the referee isn’t interested in. A clear dive.
 
87 min: Ince curls one in from the right. It’s not a million miles away from 
Bent, but the ball sails through to Jakupovic.
 
86 min: Bryson rolls a ball down the middle and nearly gets on the end of 
Martin’s return flick, but Dawson reads the danger, intercepts and clears.
 
85 min: Meyler tries to release Odubajo into space down the right, but the 
ball drifts out of play. Derby need the ball, and quick, but Hull are refusing 
to gift them anything here.
 
84 min: Hull play Derby at their own midfield possession game. The clock ticks 
on. Time is not Derby’s pal.

82 min: Derby haven’t seen much of the ball in the last five minutes, so a 
period of possession in the middle of the park gives them a much-needed 
foothold back in the game. They also replace a knackered looking Russell with 
Darren Bent.
 
80 min: “Come on City! Come on City!” Another corner for the hosts down the 
right. Snodgrass takes. Davies bends down but flicks his header high over the 
bar from 12 yards. It’s been a decent spell for Hull, who despite it all are 
ten minutes (plus stoppages) away from Wembley.
 
79 min: Derby are beginning to look tired, having put in so much effort. 
Shackell takes down a long ball, and has a simple clearance to make, but 
fresh-airs the kick and lets the ball run out of play for a corner. Thankfully, 
from the big defender’s perspective, the set piece comes to nothing.
 
77 min: This is a bit better from the home team. Snodgrass skitters down the 
left, reaches the byline, and sees his low cross whistle back past his lugs by 
Shackell. A throw deep in Derby territory the only reward, and it leads to 
nothing. But they’re still leading this semi-final on aggregate, and time’s 
running out forDerby County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>.
 
76 min: Elmohamady chases down the right, with Derby looking light at the 
back, but overruns the ball. No space. Goal kick. Hull are doing nothing in 
attack.
 
74 min: Ince has a blast from 25 yards. The ball sails on a reckless arc over 
the left-hand corner flag. The home crowd enjoyed that, a release from the 
tension.
 
73 min: Martin, on the edge of the D, takes a pass from Ince, out on the left. 
Ince cuts inside and picks up a flicked return, and is about to shoot when 
Davies clatters him in the legal style. What a challenge! Hull looked to have 
been opened up there.
 
71 min: Keogh strides forward and plays a fine ball down the inside-left 
channel for Ince, who would have got a shot away had he made for the box in a 
straight line. But he chooses to cut inside, and has to make do with a corner 
instead. No matter, because it very nearly leads to a goal, Martin picking up 
the ball with his back to goal on the left-hand corner of the box, turning and 
curling one towards the top right. It’s heading in, brilliantly, but it’s met 
by a strong fist from Jakupovic. Marvellous save!
 
69 min: Derby knock it around the middle of the park awhile. Eventually Hughes 
takes up possession, drops a shoulder, and has a look from 25 yards. It’s high 
and wide. But Derby are pressing, and pressing hard. They don’t appear to be in 
the mood to spend the summer wondering.
 
67 min: Martin strokes a ball down the inside-left channel. Ince takes it 
down, and looks to make good towards the box. He’s crowded out by Dawson. He 
should have laid the ball off to his right, where Russell was in space. Hull 
don’t look comfortable at all. The KC is bubbling and boiling with nervous 
tension. This is superlative entertainment. It could go either way. You can’t 
take your eye off it for a second. And other clichés.
 
66 min: Derby are doing their best to stretch Hull this way and that. Christie 
bombs down the right and crosses deep. So deep that Olsson has to stretch to 
keep it in on the left. Olsson then curls high to the far post. Jakupovic rises 
to claim.
 
64 min: Derby are on the front foot again. Hughes probes with baroque intent 
down the right. He can’t quite prise Hull open. Then Ince has a crack from 25 
yards. It’s straight at Odubajo.
 
63 min: Hull are going direct. Now Diame takes the ball down and powers with 
extreme prejudice down the middle. He shoots from long range, the ball bobbling 
harmlessly wide right of Carson’s goal.
 
61 min: A long hoof down the middle of the park by Hull. Hernandez dummies and 
very nearly releases Snodgrass on goal. It would have been that simple. But 
Shackell extends a leg and pokes the ball back to the keeper, just when 
Snodgrass’s eyes were widening.
 
60 min: Weimann has jarred his knee. A shame, because he’s played very well 
tonight. He’s replaced by Tom Ince who, having been dropped, has spent most of 
the evening sitting on the bench with a face on. Now’s his chance to walk it 
like he’s sulked it.
 
59 min: Hughes and Hendrick combine well down the right. Some intricate 
dribbling. Hull afraid to put the foot in. Hendrick then loops towards the far 
post for Martin, but there’s a little too much juice on the cross. Derby are 
desperate for the equalising goal in this tie, but they’re not playing 
desperate football. They’ve been very easy on the eye tonight.

57 min: Hernandez, on the left-hand corner of the Derby box, chests down a 
long throw, turns, and lashes a fine dipping effort towards the top right. Not 
quite, but full marks for ambition.
 
56 min: Shackell is booked for a cynical trip on Odubajo as the Hull man 
considers breaking into some space in the midfield. He can have no complaints.

55 min: Another lull in proceedings, which once again should do Hull a favour. 
Derby still look the sharper side. “I’ll see your Hull city centre in 1969 and 
raise youBury town centre in 1965 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyyDsHHYW8k>
,” writes Phil Thorp. “A far better production if I may be so bold. Oh, and if 
you’re looking for a link, Hull knocked the mighty Shakers out of the FA Cup 
this season and we beat Derby County 6-0 in the highest scoring FA Cup final in 
1903.”
 
53 min: Hernandez tries a snapshot from 20 yards. It smacks Keogh in the face. 
Odubajo picks up the rebound, and takes the opportunity to go over a leg hung 
out by Hughes. Street smart, and a free kick in a dangerous position. Snodgrass 
makes a play straight out of Martin’s big book, smashing the set piece straight 
into the wall. What a waste.
 
51 min: Martin blooters the free kick straight at the wall. Hull, let off the 
hook, clear. Steve Bruce has seen enough. He replaces Huddlestone with David 
Meyler.
 
50 min: Hughes comes straight at Hull down the centre, yet again. Odubajo has 
no option but to tug him back, on the edge of the D. He’s booked, and it’s a 
free kick in a very, very dangerous position.
 
48 min: Derby should be level! Martin dribbles down the left, then slides 
Weimann further along the flank. Weimann enters the box and centres low and 
hard towards Bryson, six yards out. Bryson must score! But he can’t get his 
legs working properly, allowing the ball to smack him in the troosers. Weimann 
tries to recycle the rebound, shooting form a tight angle. But it’s wide, and 
he’s offside. What a chance for Bryson!
 
47 min: Elmohamady powers down the right, the most direct Hull dribble of the 
evening so far. He ends up crossing deep towards Diame, but Keogh heads clear 
without fuss. Then Odubajo has a go from the same flank, but Carson snaffles 
that one. Much better from the Tigers already.
 
Two down, then, just the one to go. Can Derby really pull this off? Remember: 
no team has ever come back from three goals down in a two-legged play-off 
rubber. If they keep playing like they did in the first half, anything’s 
possible. Especially if Hull don’t raise their own game. The home side will 
have received some beneficial advice from Steve Bruce during the break, I’ll be 
bound, and in the trenchant style to boot. So they should come out with renewed 
purpose. Derby get the ball rolling again.
 
Half-time entertainment: A drive around Hull in 1969. Well, why not? Peckinpah 
on at the cinema, Littlewoods and Ratners still open for business.
 
A free kick for Hull out on the right. Snodgrass sends it straight through the 
Derby box. And that’s that for the first half. Well, well, well. “Sheffield 
Wednesday, we’re coming for you,” sing the away support. Derby still need one 
more goal to level things up, of course. Probably worth mentioning now that 
away goals matter not in this tournament. For some reason it didn’t seem that 
important earlier. It certainly does now! It’s going to be some second half. No 
flipping!

45 min: Space for Christie down the right. He’s got men in the middle, but 
opts to float his cross into the area, allowing Jakupovic to gently pluck the 
ball from the sky.
 
43 min: A break in play with Olsson down, the Derby left back having taken a 
knee in the back from Elmohamady. Entirely accidental. It looks as if he’ll be 
OK; there are smiles. Hull happy to see the clock tick round towards the 
45-minute mark.
 
41 min: Hughes embarks on another trademark dribble, this time down the left. 
He eventually runs out of space, and it’s a goal kick, but once again Hull were 
in a defensive panic. This is a collective breakdown. They need to find their 
equilibrium. Half time can’t come soon enough.
