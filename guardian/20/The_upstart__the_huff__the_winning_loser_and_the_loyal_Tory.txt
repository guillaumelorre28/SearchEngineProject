a new natural history. The imaginary menagerie includes the spitting image, the 
dead ringer, the huff, the white lie and the bare-faced lie, the quandary, and 
an upstart rising from a clump of Johnny-come-lately. They all appear in The 
Beast in Me and Other Animals (1948).

• In his interview with Bristol’s newly elected mayor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/23/bristol-mayor-marvin-rees-racism-inequality>
 (G2, 23 May), John Harris mentions a statue in the city of Edward Colston, 
“the 17th- and 18th- century slave trader and philanthropist”. Doesn’t the 
first occupation render the second hobby meaningless? Such “philanthropy” was 
merely diverting money stolen from the unpaid labour of slaves; it wasn’t 
Colston’s to give.

• Alas, I could not get through the opinion piece by Turkey’s President Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan (The world must share Turkey’s refugee burden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/erdogan-calls-on-europe-to-take-in-more-syrian-refugees>
, 23 May), as one thought obsessed me: did he have to write it himself, since 
all the Turkish journalists are already in his jails?

• I know that the prestige of the FA Cup has declined in recent years, but 
surely it has not sunk so low that winning it is now an instantly sackable 
offence (Van Gaal on the up – and down and out, Sport, 23 May)?

• On Radio 4’s The Week in Westminister, I heard Tory Eurosceptic Bernard 
Jenkin say of theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> “loyalty is our secret 
weapon”. It’s clearly a very secret weapon at the moment.
