Uefa are hopeful that Manchester United’s Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> game against Zorya 
Luhansk can go ahead as scheduled on Thursday following concerns regarding the 
frozen pitch at the Chornomorets Stadium in Odessa.

A pitch inspection took place at 10am local time, with one Uefa official 
confident the closing Group A match will be played. “The pitch is at its 
coldest now, it’s only going to become warmer as the day goes on,” he said.

A Zorya media officer reiterated the view, voicing optimism the match, which 
kicks off at 8pm local time, will be staged.Another club official, speaking 
after the pitch inspection, said: “Everything depends on the weather and the 
pitch is not brilliant at moment – we’re expecting temperatures of 2-3 degrees 
and everything should be OK.”

José Mourinho had been unimpressed

with the surface on Wednesday evening when he saw it on arrival at the stadium 
before training. The manager questioned why Uefa had allowed a final match to 
be played in Odessa in December when temperatures were bound to plummet.

United require a point to ensure qualification to the knockout stage.
