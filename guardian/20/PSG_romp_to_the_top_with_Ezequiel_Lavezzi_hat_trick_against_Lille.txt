Ezequiel Lavezzi rediscovered his scoring touch, notching a hat-trick as Paris 
Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> went to the 
top of Ligue 1 with a 6-1 demolition of Lille at the Parc des Princes.

The Argentina forward, who had previously managed four league goals this 
season, struck twice in the first half and once after the break. Edinson 
Cavani, with a double, and Maxwell completed the rout.

Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>, who grabbed a consolation 
goal through Marko Basa in the 59th minute, finished with 10 men after 
Sébastien Corchia was sent off in the 72nd minute.

PSG have 68 points with five matches left, three ahead of second-placed Lyon, 
who have played the same number of games and travel to Reims on Sunday.

Laurent Blanc’s PSG, knocked out by Barcelona in the Champions League 
quarter-finals in midweek, were 2-0 up after four minutes. Thiago Motta was 
back after a long injury layoff and he made his presence count, marshalling the 
midfield.

In the first minute full-back Maxwell latched on to Serge Aurier’s cross to 
open the scoring and three minutes later Cavani netted with a fine lob after 
being set up by Javier Pastore’s defence-splitting pass.

Motta then played in Cavani in the 28th minute and the Uruguay striker crossed 
for Lavezzi to fire the ball under Vincent Enyeama’s bar.

One minute before the interval Lavezzi was at it again, tapping in from close 
range after Blaise Matuidi’s centre.

The defender Basa headed in a Lille corner in the 59th minute but the northern 
side, who are eighth on 50 points, had long given up hope.

Things got even worse for the visitors when Corchia held Lavezzi’s shirt in 
the box and was shown a second yellow card. Cavani converted the resulting 
penalty.

Lavezzi wrapped it up in the 77th minute with a low cross-shot after being set 
up by Pastore.
