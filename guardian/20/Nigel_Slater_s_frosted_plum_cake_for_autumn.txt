Now, for the crimson and golden plums – the ‘Czar’ and ‘Marjorie’s Seedling’, 
the ‘Opal’ and then ‘Victoria’ (she’s at her best when fully ripened, so beads 
of nectar gather at the tip).

Even for breakfast, cooked till they have softened enough to crush 
effortlessly between finger and thumb, their syrup shot with glowing ruby, 
plums appreciate a dusting of spice: ground ginger perhaps, cinnamon 
definitely. I give them cardamom, too – the black seeds tweaked out of their 
green pods and ground to a grey dust.

Plums will cook to a golden jelly in a cake, but are best in one made with the 
darker sugars, such as light or dark muscovado, and to which you have added 
ground ginger or mixed spice. The sugar’s butterscotch notes serve the fruit 
well.

With a plum cake baking, there was an excuse to roast onions while the oven 
was warm. A bit early perhaps, but I am eager to get to autumn food. I cooked 
them with butter, thyme and olive oil, leaving them soft and gold, their flesh 
translucent. (Left for long enough they will caramelise a little, too.) The 
smell of them roasting put me into autumn gear, piling them on top of a silky 
pool of polenta into whose golden depths I let cheese soften and melt.

Soft cheese polenta with roast onions

A soft, almost soupy polenta to eat with roasted onions. I sometimes add 100ml 
of double cream, warmed in a small saucepan, to the polenta. I use Tunworth or 
other soft cheese to finish. Camembert will do.

Serves 4
For the onions:
onions 4, medium-sized
olive oil 50g
butter 60g
thyme sprigs 10

For the polenta:
water 500ml
full-cream milk 500ml
fine polenta 150g
butter 50g
parmesan 100g, finely grated
soft cheese to finish 200g

Directions

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Peel the onions, halve them then cut each 
half in two. Put them in a roasting tin, trickle the oil over them, dot with 
butter and a few sprigs of thyme then bake for 20-30 minutes till golden and 
soft, basting from time to time.

Make the polenta. Pour the water and milk into a large, deep pan and place 
over a moderate heat. Bring the mixture to the boil, then salt generously. Rain 
the polenta into the liquid in a steady stream, stirring continuously. Take 
great care that the mixture doesn’t bubble and spit at you (it can be like a 
volcano). Lower the heat as necessary.

Keep stirring over the heat for a good 20 minutes until the mixture is smooth, 
creamy but not too thick. Beat the butter into the polenta.

Stir the grated parmesan into the polenta. (At this point you could add a 
little warmed cream.) Add salt and black pepper to taste. Spoon the polenta 
into warm dishes and top with the baked onions. Place the cheese on top of the 
onions and let it soften.

Wholemeal plum cake, spiced frosting


Serves 8
For the cake:
butter 200g
light muscovado sugar 75g
golden caster 75g
hazelnuts 100g, skinned
plums 500g, medium-sized
eggs 4
self-raising wholemeal flour 150g
baking powder 1 tsp
ground cinnamon ½ tsp
salt a pinch

For the icing:
icing sugar 150g
lemon juice 3 tsp
ground cinnamon a pinch
cardamom pods 6
sesame seeds 2 tsp
poppy seeds 2 tsp
dried rose petals 2 tsp

Directions

Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 3. Line the base of a 22cm spring-form baking 
tin. Dice the butter and put it in a food mixer with the sugars and beat for 5 
minutes, till light and fluffy – the colour of latte. Regularly push the 
mixture down from the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure even 
creaming.

While the butter and sugar cream, toast the hazelnuts in a dry pan, watching 
carefully and moving them round the pan so they colour evenly. Grind to a fine 
powder in a food processor. Cut the plums in half and discard their stones.

Beat the eggs lightly with a fork then add, slowly, with the paddle turning, 
to the butter and sugar. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and 
the ground hazlenuts, then add to the batter, mixing it together thoroughly. 
Scrape the batter into the lined cake tin and gently smooth the surface.

Place the plums evenly on the surface of the cake. You want them to sink into 
the body of the cake as it bakes. Bake for 50–60 minutes till the cake is 
spongy to the touch. (Test for doneness after 50 minutes with a metal skewer: 
it should come out without any uncooked cake mixture sticking to it.)

Remove the cake from the oven and leave to settle for 20 minutes. Run a 
palette knife around the inside of the tin to the loosen the cake, then undo 
the tin and place on a plate.

Make the icing: sieve the icing sugar into a bowl, stir in the lemon juice, 
adding a little water if required to bring it to a thick, pouring consistency. 
Stir in the ground cinnamon. Crack open the cardamom pods, remove the seeds and 
grind them to a fine powder. Stir into the icing. Lightly toast the sesame 
seeds in a dry pan till golden, then mix them with the poppy seeds and rose 
petals.

Transfer the cake to a plate, then trickle the spiced icing over the surface. 
Scatter with the poppy seeds and rose petals.
