Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> and Toto 
Wolff have declared their partnership will be stronger than ever next year at 
Mercedes.

The former world champion and Mercedes’ head of motorsport seemed to be at 
odds at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as Hamiltondefied team orders in 
his attempt to snatch the Formula One drivers’ title off team-mate Nico Rosberg

.

However, following Rosberg’s retirement

, Mercedes have been forced into focusing on ironing out any issues with 
Hamilton as they continue their search for the world champion’s replacement.

Valtteri Bottas is Mercedes’ No1 choice to replace the German but Williams

release the Finn from his 2017 contract.

In two short videos posted by Hamilton on Instagram on Sunday night, the 
31-year-old revealed he had held a meeting in Wolff’s kitchen, where the pair 
are seen sitting alongside each other.

“We just had an amazing meeting,” Hamilton said. “I just wanted to send on a 
message to let you know that we are going to be the strongest partnership next 
year and we look forward to fighting for this championship again.”

Wolff, who said on Friday that in hindsight Mercedes should have let the two 
drivers race

 “in the way they deemed to be appropriate” in Abu Dhabi, also wants to put the 
controversy behind them.

“We spent a good couple of hours together,” Wolff said. “We had a really 
fantastic meeting and we will be coming back so strong in 2017.”

Mercedes could, however, be without their technical director, Paddy Lowe, for 
next season after the 54-year-old was linked with a return to Williams.
