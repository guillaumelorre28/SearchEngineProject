The former Brighton and Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> manager will take over a 
Betis side currently 14th in La Liga with only one game remaining in the 
season. He was recently linked with Nottingham Forest.

A statement from the club read: “Real Betis have signed Uruguayan coach 
Gustavo Poyet as new Betis coach for the next two seasons. Poyet will be one of 
the cornerstones of the new sports project headed by Miguel Torrecilla.

“Real Betis want to especially thank the work done by Juan Merino and his 
coaching staff this season, who has managed to ward off the team from the lower 
part of the division.”

Merino will lead the side for the final time in the season-ending clash with 
Getafe on Sunday, with Poyet due to be unveiled on Wednesday.
