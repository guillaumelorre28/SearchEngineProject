One of the easiest ways of measuring your personality is simply to ask which 
kinds of TV, films, and books and magazines do you enjoy. Do you prefer:

a) Daytime talk shows, romance, cooking and religion
b) Arts and humanities, classics, foreign films and poetry
c) Horror, cult films and erotic novels
d) Action and adventure, thrillers, sci-fi films and spy stories
e) News, documentaries and nonfiction

Your answer reveals which of the five personality types you are. If you tended 
to prefer a) you are communal; b) aesthetic; c) dark; d) thrilling; or e) 
cerebral

A recent study of more than 3,000 people, conducted by psychologists at the 
University of Texas, found numerous correlations between these preferences and 
measures of personality and education.

Communal types tend to have received less education and are poor at abstract 
reasoning, but are tender, warm and understanding. Fans of “aesthetic” and 
“dark” entertainment are both well-educated and good at abstract reasoning. But 
while the former are calm and introspective, the latter are provocative, 
outgoing and incautious.

Cerebral types tend to be well organised, enterprising and selfassured (to the 
point that they dislike co-operation). But “thrilling” types of personality are 
a law unto themselves, showing no consistent characteristics (other than being 
male) – an inconsistency that is perhaps thrilling in its own right.
