The more sticky the weather, the more I want cool, sharp flavours; food that 
is light, refreshing and, above all, has a snap of acidity to it. All of which 
has lead me to a succession of vibrant fish dishes – sweet, oily fleshed 
mackerel and salmon – marinated with citrus juice and golden vinegar, a little 
ginger, lime perhaps, and served with wholegrain sourdough with a dark and 
chewy crust.

Dishes such as soused mackerel, or salmon that has been browned in a pan then 
left to mingle with fruit juices, vinegars and aromatics make a teasingly 
piquant start to a meal. But they work in high summer as principal dishes in 
their own right with little more than a robust, rough-edged potato salad to 
push them towards the role of main course.

The acid nature of the dressing “cooks” the fish lightly, but also removes the 
natural richness of its oil-dense flesh, producing something light and 
fresh-tasting, a dish with a spring in its step.

Bread, something dark and sticky, feels appropriate, not purely because of 
tradition, but as a sweet, doughy contrast to the sharp, bracing flavours going 
on in the main dishes.

Mackerel with juniper, coriander seeds and bay

Serves 4
mackerel 2, filleted

For the marinade:
red onion 1, medium
white wine vinegar 200ml
water 200ml
bay leaves 2
garlic 1 medium-sized clove
sugar 1 level tbsp
coriander seeds 1 tsp
juniper berries 15
white peppercorns 5
black peppercorns 5
salt 1 tsp
fresh dill a little, lightly chopped

Peel the red onion and slice it thinly. Pour the vinegar into a 
stainless-steel saucepan and add the water, sliced onions and the bay leaves. 
Peel and flatten the garlic, then add it to the pan, together with the sugar, 
coriander seeds and juniper berries.

Bring the lot to the boil, then add the salt and peppercorns. Turn off the 
heat. Place the mackerel in a shallow dish in a single layer. Pour the marinade 
over them and set aside in a cool place for at least four hours, until the fish 
is opaque. Chill thoroughly and eat within a day or two. Add the dill as a 
garnish.

The salmon is lightly browned first, then marinated briefly in a sharp 
dressing warmed with coriander seeds and a little palm sugar.

Serves 2
white wine vinegar 50ml
lemon juice 120ml
carrot 1, small
red onion 1, small
garlic 1 clove
red chilli 1
olive oil 2 tbsp
star anise 2
coriander seeds 1 tsp
peppercorns 10
salt for seasoning
palm sugar 1 tsp
salmon tail 500g
ginger a thumb-sized knob

Directions

Pour the wine vinegar and lemon juice into a stainless-steel saucepan. Slice 
the carrot thinly, peel and thinly slice the onion, then add them to the pan 
with the garlic clove, crushed flat. Finely chop the chilli, removing the seeds 
if you wish, and stir in.

Place the pan over a moderate heat and bring to the boil, then add the star 
anise, the coriander seeds and peppercorns. Add the sugar and a generous 
seasoning of salt then, once the onion has softened a little, remove from the 
heat.

In a shallow pan, warm the oil and lightly brown the salmon tail on both 
sides. Transfer the fish to a serving dish then dress it with the warm vinegar 
and spice dressing. Set the plate aside somewhere cool, then, just before you 
serve it, grate some of the ginger very finely over the surface.

Salad of new potatoes, watercress and frisee

This recipe makes about twice as much mayonnaise as you need. Save half for 
later. Scrub the potatoes or peel them as you wish.

Serves 2-3
new potatoes 400g

For the dressing:
egg yolks 2
groundnut oil 100ml
olive oil 200ml
lemon juice a good squeeze
honey 1 tbsp
grain mustard 1 tbsp
cornichons 15, halved lengthways
capers 3 tsp, rinsed
watercress a handful
frisée or other crisp salad leaves a good handful per person

Wipe or rinse the potatoes, then boil them for 12-20 minutes, depending on 
size, in generously salted water until tender to the point of a knife.

Make the dressing by putting the egg yolks in a bowl, adding a pinch of salt 
and then slowly adding the oil, the briefest trickle at first, beating all the 
time until you have a thick mayonnaise. Add the lemon juice and a little finely 
ground black pepper.

Stir the honey and mustard into half of the mayonnaise, putting the other half 
away for another day. Slice the cornichons in half, then stir, together with 
the rinsed capers, into the mayonnaise, and season to taste.

Remove and discard the toughest of the watercress stems, then pick over the 
leaves, keeping the freshest. Snap or cut the frisée into large pieces. Drain 
the potatoes, then, using the back of a spoon, press down lightly on each 
potato to crack it open.

Drop the potatoes into the dressing and fold them into it, so that they soak 
up as much of it as possible, then add the torn frisée leaves and the 
watercress.
