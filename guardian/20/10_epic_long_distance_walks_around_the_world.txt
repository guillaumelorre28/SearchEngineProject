Makalu Base Camp, Nepal 

The trek to the base of the fifth highest mountain in the world 
<http://www.makalutrekking.com/makalu-base-camp-trekking.html> leads from dense 
rain forests over steep passes, to high pastures below glacier-clad peaks. 
Although only 125 miles long, the trek is tough as it involves an ascent of 
more than 7,000 metres and remote and rugged terrain. Once over the 4,100-metre 
Shipton La (pass), the route descends into the spectacular Barun river valley 
and climbs to the tongue of the Barun glacier, below the great dark wedge of 
Makalu.As the only way to get back is over the Shipton La, there is a degree of 
commitment not required on many treks. There are few villages and teahouses, 
making this even more of a wilderness trek. It passes through every climatic 
zone, from tropical forest to tundra and is a wonderful way to experience the 
huge range of environments found in Nepal.

The Grand Randonnée 20 <http://corsica.forhikers.com/gr20> (GR20) is a walk 
for those with a good head for heights who are happy scrambling over steep 
rocks for hours and days at a time. This spectacular route runs along the spine 
of Corsica, following the crest of the mountains. The crux of the route is the 
descent into – and climb out of – the great rock bowl of the Cirque de la 
Solitude. Here, chains and a ladder are bolted to the rock in places to aid 
progress.It’s not a place to slip. The GR20 is 112 miles long but takes most 
walkers at least two weeks, because of the steep, rocky terrain.

In Lapland, in the far north of Sweden, a 280-mile footpath crosses the Arctic 
Circle and runs through four national parks and the largest nature reserve in 
Europe. This is theKungsleden – the King’s Way 
<http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/Things-to-do/Adventure--Sports/Hiking/> – 
and it is magnificent. Starting at Hemavan in the south, the route runs through 
pristine pine and birch forests and Arctic tundra before finishing at Abisko, 
on the shores of Torneträsk lake. There are lodges along the way, run by the
Swedish Tourist Association 
<https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/about-stf/>, although camping is 
necessary on some nights – which I recommend anyway. Long lakes are crossed by 
ferries run by local people, or by rowing boat. Glacier-clad mountains line the 
route, including the highest in Sweden: 2,097-metre Kebnekaise. The latter can 
be climbed on an extra trip. It’s an interesting ascent and the views from the 
summit are tremendous.

Running for 745 miles from Peel Fell in the Cheviot Hills, to the north-east 
tip of Scotland at Duncansby Head, the Scottish Watershed (between the Atlantic 
Ocean and the North Sea) is a twisting, tortuous route. It averages 450 metres 
in height and crosses many summits, including 44 munros (hills above 914 
metres) and 24 corbetts (between 762 and 914 metres). There’s no path and the 
way is not always as obvious as you’d expect, so good navigation skills are 
essential. The Watershed doesn’t run in anything like a straight line and, at 
times, you can be heading south even though you are following it northwards.The 
terrain is also a challenge, often rough and boggy, sometimes dense with trees, 
sometimes steep and rocky.There are few buildings on or near the Watershed. 
It’s surprisingly remote and lonely but also a superb walk.

Several trails run along the mountains from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. 
Of these, theHaute Randonnée Pyrénéenne 
<http://www.balade-rando-pyrenees.com/dossiers/haute-randonnee-pyreneenne.html> 
(HRP) is the most remote and challenging as it stays high in the mountains, 
crossing many passes and climbing several summits. The border between France 
and Spain runs along the crest of the Pyrenees and the HRP crosses it many 
times. It is about 500 miles long and takes around six weeks to complete. T as 
the route isn’t fixed and many variations are possible. There is a path much of 
the way but the route isn’t often waymarked and the terrain is steep and rocky. 
Mountain huts are sometimes several days apart, so camping is a necessity – and 
a boon as there are many lovely spots to pitch in. The HRP passes through many 
landscapes: some lush and green, some alpine, some almost desert.

Far less well known, and much newer than the Appalachian or Pacific Crest 
Trails, thePacific Northwest Trail <http://www.pnt.org/> (PNT) runs 1,200 miles 
from the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean. Starting in the Rocky 
Mountains in Montana, it crosses the remote, little-visited Purcell and Selkirk 
mountains and the Kettle River range, before traversing the arid sagebrush 
country of the Okanogan and climbing into the North Cascades. Then comes a 
coastal and island section around Puget Sound before the final mountains of the 
Olympic range and a finish along the spectacular Pacific coast to Cape Alava, 
the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states. Three national parks are 
crossed – Glacier, North Cascades and Olympic – plus several designated 
wilderness areas, including the vast and beautiful Pasayten Wilderness. The PNT 
is a challenging route with few waymarks and often no clear trail.

 The Grand Canyon from the Arizona Trail. Photograph: Ed Freeman/Getty Images 
The desert terrain of the US south-west is a tough but rewarding place for 
walkers. One glorious trail runs some 810 miles, through the heart of Arizona 
from Mexico to Utah. En route, theArizona Trail  <http://www.aztrail.org/>
passes through deserts, canyons, forests and mountains. In the southern part of 
the state are the “sky islands”: small, steep forested mountain ranges that 
soar above the desert. These then fade into the flat, hot Sonoran desert (take 
plenty of water) before the trail climbs into two more extensive mountain 
ranges – the Mazatzals and the Superstitions. These mountains all have a touch 
of the desert about them.This changes in the northern part of Arizona as the 
vast Ponderosa pine forests of the Colorado Plateau are crossed, but before 
that, there is the highlight of the trail, the awe-inspiring Grand Canyon.

Running some 745 miles through the southern half of the Canadian Rockies, from 
Waterton Lakes near the US border to Kakwa provincial park in northern Alberta, 
theGreat Divide Trail <http://www.greatdividetrail.com/> (GDT) is a wilderness 
mountain route that closely parallels the watershed between the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans. It takes in five national parks – Waterton Lakes, Banff, 
Kootenay, Yoho and Jasper – along with four designated wilderness areas and 
seven provincial parks. The scenery is spectacular and wildlife includes 
grizzly bears, wolves, moose and mountain goats. The trail isn’t waymarked and 
there are some sections with no trail at all – much of the route is in remote 
country and there are few settlements. There are steep ascents and descents and 
streams that have to be forded. This is not a trail for novices, but the 
rewards for the effort required are great.

Walking from the south-west corner of Britain to the north-east is a wonderful 
way to see the huge variety of scenery found in our small island. The many 
people walking and cycling it for charity every year mostly stick to the roads 
though. To really experience the splendour of this walk you need to follow 
footpaths and tracks. Many long-distance paths can be linked to create a 
splendid walk. TheSouth-West Coast Path <https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/>
 (with a diversion to Dartmoor if you tire of the coast), theQuantock Way 
<https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Quantock+Way>, 
Offa’s Dyke <http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/offas-dyke-path>, the Pennine Way

<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/west-highland-way.shtml>, the Great Glen Way 
<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/great-glen-way.shtml>, and the Cape Wrath Trail 
<http://www.capewrathtrail.org.uk/> can all be followed in full or in part. 
There’s no set route, so you can vary it as much as you like. The total 
distance is around 1,250 miles but maybe you want to take in the Lake District 
or the Cairngorms and add to that.

Stretching 3,000-plus miles from Canada to Mexico, this trail follows the 
watershed of the US along the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming it reaches the 
Parting of the Waters, where Two Ocean Creek splits, one branch starting a 
3,500-mile journey to the Atlantic, the other a 1,350-mile journey to the 
Pacific. The CDT runs through much remote mountain and desert wilderness and is 
a challenging walk. It’s not fully complete yet and there are cross-country 
sections as well as old trails and dirt roads. Signposts are rare. The trail 
runs through many varied landscapes – the imposing peaks of the Northern 
Rockies in Montana and Idaho, the thermal geysers and hot springs of 
Yellowstone national park, the flat desert of the Great Divide Basin in 
Wyoming, splendid peaks again on the highest section of the walk in the 
Colorado Rockies, and finally the deserts and semi-deserts of New Mexico.
