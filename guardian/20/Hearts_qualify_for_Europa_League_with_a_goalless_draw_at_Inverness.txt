Robbie Neilson was delighted to see his Hearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> side secure European football for 
next season despite a turgid 0-0 draw with Inverness.

The point was good enough to seal Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> qualification for the 
Edinburgh club, who are now 16 points clear of fourth-placed Motherwell.

The best chances in a dreary affair went Hearts’ way, with Abiola Dauda having 
the best of them blocked by the Welsh goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams.

But ultimately neither side did enough to earn the win, and Neilson was 
disappointed in his side’s display.

He said: “Obviously it is good to get the point and secure that European 
place, but the disappointment is we didn’t take three. I was hoping to come up 
here and take three points but we didn’t do enough to win the game.

“But European football is great for the club. Obviously top-six was the aim 
this year so to be able to secure European football before the split is great 
for us.

“We’ve taken two huge strides over the course of the last two seasons – one, 
getting out of the Championship and the next one getting into Europe. It’s 
important to try and build on that over the summer and keep that positive 
momentum going.”

His Inverness counterpart, John Hughes, praised his side for looking more like 
a team than they have throughout the season, given the injury problems they 
have encountered.

Hughes was able to name an unchanged XI – a rare feat these days – and had the 
luxury of leaving players out of the matchday squad.

For the majority of the season he has struggled to field a full bench and he 
said: “We’ve had to leave a couple in the stand and it’s a good problem to 
have. We’re getting that experience back. We look more like a team.”
