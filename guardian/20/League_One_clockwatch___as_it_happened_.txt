As it stands

After that Colchester goal, MK Dons are all but promoted while at the bottom 
it is Crawley,Leyton Orient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient> 
and Crewe joining Yeovil in League One. Goals for Gillingham or Preston would 
change all that though.

Swindon 1-2 Leyton Orient: Swindon have a goal back and this one is worth a 
watch. A free-kick just on the edge of the Orient area is knocked to Anton 
Rodgers who flicks the ball up before smashing a right-footed volley into the 
top corner. Tasty.

Colchester missed penalty

Colchester 0-0 Preston: Sam Johnstone obviously paid no attention to Grayson’s 
rocket and after shooting off his line he brings down George Moncur. It’s Chris 
Porter who steps up and it’s an awful penalty, at least five yards over the 
bar! That’s the third missed penalty of the day and it’s a let-off for Crewe 
who would have slipped into the bottom four in place ofColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> had Porter found the net.

Doncaster 3-0 Scunthorpe: This one is still going – maybe their not going to 
bother with half-time. Rob Jones has made it 3-0 to Rovers. It’s half-time 
there now. Not so exciting.

Let-off for Preston: Jacob Murphy’s audacious lob from wide on the left, over 
the onrushing Sam Johnstone, who can expect a rocket from Larry Grayson at 
half-time, drifts just wide. It’s still 0-0 and it’s now half-time.

Coventry missed penalty!

Crawley 0-0 Coventry: That is massive. Nick Proschwitz has been anything but 
prolific for the Sky Blues and his spot-kick is superbly saved by Brian ‘the 
Beast’ Jensen low down to his right. That is a missed chance for Cov to pull 
clear of danger.

Colchester’s win over Preston has kept the U’s up as Crawley, Orient and Notts 
County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottscounty> are condemned to 
League Two next season.
 
A 5-1 win coupled with Preston’s defeat at Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> sees MK Dons promoted to the 
Championship.
 
Doncaster 5-2 Scunthorpe: And Hakeeb Adelakun has scored an equally 
meaningless goal for the Iron.
 
Port Vale 1-2 Fleetwood: Michael O’Connor pulls a thoroughly irrelevant goal 
back for Port Vale.
 
Barnsley 5-0 Rochdale: Sam Winnall has scored.
 
FT! Colchester 1-0 Preston: Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> have saved themselves. George

play-offs.

Gillingham 3-1 Notts County: Oh dear, oh dear. Desperately pushing for an 
equaliser, County are hit on the counter and Luke Morris hammers in the final 
nail.
 
Bristol City 8-2 Walsall: Not Aden Flint this time but Kieran Agard with his 
second in the Robins’ promotion party.
 
Barnsley 4-0 Rochdale: Conor Hourihane has scored.

Gillingham 2-1 Notts County: That appears to be curtains for County unless 
Preston can find an equaliser – Brennan Dickenson puts Gillingham ahead at 
Prestfield.
 
Swindon 2-2 Leyton Orient: And that’s pretty much it for Orient as well. Andy 
Williams levels from the penalty spot for 10-man Swindon and the O’s are all 
but done.
 
Crawley 1-2 Coventry: That’s Crawley’s fate effectively sealed. James Maddison 
slots home after some mindless defending from the Red Devils, Coventry fans can 
breathe easy.

Bristol City 7-2 Walsall: That’s a hat-trick for Bristol City’s centre-half 
Aden Flint, who now has 14 goals this season. Wowsers.
 
Barnsley 3-0 Rochdale: Mason Holgate has scored.

Gillingham 1-1 Notts County: All change again! John Egan’s leveller for 
Gillingham puts the Magpies back in the bottom four and Crewe are now out of 
the drop-zone again. Blimey! Who’d be a Crewe fan today?
 
Doncaster 5-1 Scunthorpe: Nathan Tyson completes his hat-trick with another 
penalty against Scunthorpe, smashing it down the middle.
 
After that Colchester goal, MK Dons are all but promoted while at the bottom 
it is Crawley,Leyton Orient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient> 
and Crewe joining Yeovil in League One. Goals for Gillingham or Preston would 
change all that though.
 
Oldham 1-1 Peterborough: Michael Bostwick has equalised for Peterborough in a 
match that matter little.

Colchester 1-0 Preston: George Moncur’s ninth goal of the season has all but 
ended Preston’s hopes of automatic promotion whileColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> may have just saved 
themselves. It’s tidy slotted finish from Moncur after good hold-up play from 
Chris Porter. Crewe are back in trouble at the foot of the table.
 
Barnsley 2-0 Rochdale: Josh Scowen now has a double at Oakwell. That is all.

MK Dons 5-1 Yeovil: Goal 101 of the season for MK Dons, Dean Lewington with 
his second of the match. This one has long been in the bag for the Dons but 
Preston can still deny them.
 
Colchester 0-0 Preston: What a miss! A superb cross from Preston’s Daniel 
Johnson finds Joe Garner, the league’s top scorer, unmarked at the far post but 
he heads just wide.
 
Crawley 1-1 Coventry: Another towering header at the Broadfield Stadium from 
Coventry’s Marcus Tudgay has put the cat among the relegation pigeons. Crawley 
are back down to 22nd and Crewe are just above the line.

Barnsley 1-0 Rochdale: Josh Scowen has put Barnsley ahead in a match that 
we’ve not touched on yet. Rochdale are down to 10 by the by. Joe Rafferty has 
picked up two yellow cards to bring an early end to his season.

Bristol City 6-2 Walsall: Start the car! That’s another for Aden Flint, No13 
of the season, and the Robins are rocking!
 
Swindon 1-2 Leyton Orient: Swindon have a goal back and this one is worth a 
watch. A free-kick just on the edge of the Orient area is knocked to Anton 
Rodgers who flicks the ball up before smashing a right-footed volley into the 
top corner. Tasty.

Colchester 0-0 Preston: Preston have stepped it up a notch. An almighty 
scramble in theColchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> box 
is swiftly followed by Jermaine Beckford just failing to meet a flashing cross 
across the face.
 
Bristol City 5-2 Walsall: Yep, Walsall are done for. That’s two in two minutes 
for the champions, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas with his second of the game, powering 
into the area before lashing home.
 
Bristol City 4-2 Walsall: Marlon Pack has given Bristol City their fourth goal 
of the match and you get the feeling Walsall are done for now.
 
Gillingham 0-1 Notts County: This is a massive goal from Graham Burke. Crewe 
were let off the hook by Colchester butNotts County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottscounty> have heaped the pressure on 
the Alex with Burke lashing home. Coventry also looking precarious but safe at 
present on goal difference.

As it stands then, the bottom four are Crewe, Leyton Orient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient>, Colchester and Yeovil.

thriller, Kieran Agard on target on 57 minutes. The Robins faithful are 
enjoying themselves again.

Doncaster 3-1 Scunthorpe: More own goal news. This time Andy Butler beating 
his own goalkeeper to pull one back for the Iron at the Keepmoat.
 
MK Dons 4-1 Yeovil: Now that’s surprise. Yeovil have one back, Jordan Spence 
putting through his own net at stadium:mk.
 
Colchester 0-0 Preston: Sam Johnstone obviously paid no attention to Grayson’s 
rocket and after shooting off his line he brings down George Moncur. It’s Chris 
Porter who steps up and it’s an awful penalty, at least five yards over the 
bar! That’s the third missed penalty of the day and it’s a let-off for Crewe 
who would have slipped into the bottom four in place ofColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> had Porter found the net.
 
Sheffield United 1-1 Chesterfield: The race for fifth is back on! Ian Evatt 
levels for the Spireites. Another for the visitors and they will leapfrog their 
hosts into fifth place.
 
Swindon 0-2 Leyton Orient: The O’s are doing everything they can to stay in 
League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> – Chris 
Dagnall has doubled their advantage at the County Ground but they remain in 
trouble with Crawley in front against Coventry.
 
Colchester 0-0 Preston: A shocking attempt from North End’s Paul Gallagher. 
The ball bobbled after a pull-back to the edge of the area but that one is a 
mile over the bar and still travelling
 
Crawley 1-0 Coventry: A towering header from Mathias Pogba means it’s all 
change at the bottom. Crawley are now safe as things stand, withLeyton Orient

drop-zone despite leading at Swindon.

Colchester 0-0 Preston: That is poor from Jermaine Beckford. He was closing in 
on goal but a heavy touch allowed Tom Eastman to come across and make the 
tackle.
 
We’re back underway at Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester>. Both sides need to win but 
at the moment it’s 0-0. Something must give …
 
Doncaster 3-0 Scunthorpe: This one is still going – maybe their not going to 
bother with half-time. Rob Jones has made it 3-0 to Rovers. It’s half-time 
there now. Not so exciting.

As it stands, MK Dons are 4-0 to the good against Yeovil and are on their way 
to the Championship with Preston still goalless at Colchester.Leyton Orient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient>, 23rd at the start of the 
day, are the only side in the bottom six in front and as a result it is Notts 
County who are currently joining Crawley, Colchester and Yeovil in League Two.
 
Let-off for Preston: Jacob Murphy’s audacious lob from wide on the left, over 
the onrushing Sam Johnstone, who can expect a rocket from Larry Grayson at 
half-time, drifts just wide. It’s still 0-0 and it’s now half-time.
 
Crawley 0-0 Coventry: That is massive. Nick Proschwitz has been anything but 
prolific for the Sky Blues and his spot-kick is superbly saved by Brian ‘the 
Beast’ Jensen low down to his right. That is a missed chance for Cov to pull 
clear of danger.
