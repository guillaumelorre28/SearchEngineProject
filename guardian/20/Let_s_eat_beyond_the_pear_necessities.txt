Your celebrity cooks are missing wonderful opportunities to improve 
our appreciation of fruit. Claire Ptak (Pear necessities

, Cook, 8 October) is incorrect that Williams pears are now “at their peak”, as 
this acme was earlier in September, and the only other alternative variety she 
suggests, Comice, will be at their best next month. There are dozens of other 
varieties of pear that can be grown in Britain, with some, like Winter Nelis, 
having their season after Christmas. We have alas lost most of the many 
hundreds of varieties which nurserymen could offer in the 19th century, but if 
cooks encouraged us to look beyond the scandalously few we can expect from 
supermarkets, we could be not only informed, but might be able to ask for the 
sorts that are in danger of being killed off by the easy varieties like 
Conference pears which keep so well. We could also learn that some varieties 
cook much better than others – who could expect to make a pie of Bramley apples 
and Cox’s orange pippins and get the same result?
