Crawley Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crawley-town> have hired 
the former Chelsea and Arsenal coach Dermot Drummy as their new head coach on a 
two-year contract.

The 55-year-old will replace Mark Yates, who was sacked by the League Two club 
this week

 following six successive defeats.

Drummy, who will have the former Aldershot coach Matt Gray as his assistant, 
told the club’s website: “I’m delighted to be at Crawley and I am really 
looking forward to taking the club forward.

“Hopefully I can produce a team that plays attractive football that excites 
our fans and brings the whole club together – players, supporters and the 
people who work for the club. I can’t wait to get started.”

Drummy moved to Chelsea from Arsenal in 2007, taking charge of the under-21s 
before becoming international head coach. He left in January 2015.

Crawley’s owner, Zaya Erin, said: “Dermot will bring top-level experience and 
vital recruitment knowledge to Crawley Town. We wish him all the best for a 
long and successful tenure at the club.”

Yates had replaced John Gregory on a two-year deal in May 2015, but won only 
13 of his 47 games, leaving them 18th in the table. Crawley have, though, 
already secured their Football League status for next season.
