Among those killed was Adrian Evans, 49, who worked for Sandwell council in 
the West Midlands as a manager in the gas services department. His father, 
Patrick, 78, and his nephew, Joel Richards, 19, are also thought to have died 
in the attack. Joel’s brother, Owen Richards, believed to be 16, was reported 
to have survived.

Sandwell council’s leader, Darren Cooper, said: “Adrian Evans was a very 
popular and long-serving employee who was the manager of our gas services team. 
We are absolutely devastated for Adrian’s family, friends and colleagues, and 
our thoughts are with them and all those affected by this tragedy.”

Mahoob Hussain, another colleague of Evans, told the BBC: “I had a number of 
phone calls from the staff who worked for him. My understanding is it was his 
first day – and suddenly the colleagues found out what happened inTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/tunisia> and they were all in tears.”

Birmingham <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham> County Football 
Association said Richards was an active member of its youth council: “A young, 
talented referee with the world at his feet, he was highly thought of and will 
be sadly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at 
this tragic time.”

Dozens of supporters of various football clubs gathered at Walsall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/walsall> FC’s Banks’s stadium to pay 
their respects to Joel and Adrian, season ticket holders, laying down a 
makeshift shrine of club scarves in their memory.

Tributes to Richards were also placed at the main entrance to the University 
of Worcester, where he had recently completed the second year of a physical 
education and sports coaching science degree.

Chad Ehlertsen, chief executive of Birmingham County Football Association, said
 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-33312430>: “He was a leader of young 
people, a good organiser, a good communicator and an extremely talented young 
referee.”

The University of Worcester’s vice-chancellor and chief executive, Prof David 
Green, said: “At Worcester, Joel has shown himself to be a highly intelligent, 
talented young man and an all-round outstanding person with a truly bright 
future ahead. Since joining the university, he has become very popular with his 
fellow students, team mates and with the many staff that have taught him 
throughout his time with us.”

Carly Lovett from Lincolnshire, England


A photographer and beauty blogger, Lovett had recently got engaged to her 
boyfriend, Liam Moore.

The 24-year-old from Gainsborough had studied at the University of Lincoln, 
from where she graduated in 2013. The school of film and media tweeted 
condolences late on Friday night.

Saddened to hear news reports of Carly Lovett in Tunisia - Graduate of our 
University 2013

<https://twitter.com/LincolnMedia/status/614567279028781056> 
Relatives paid tribute to Lovett as a “shining light” who radiated happiness 
to those around her. In a statement issued through Lincolnshire police, 
Lovett’s fiance and immediate family said they were praying that the evil seen 
in Tunisia would end to spare others the heartbreak they have experienced.

They said: “Carly was and always will be our beautiful shining light. She was 
funny, clever, artistic and radiated love and happiness around her. Carly 
recently got engaged to Liam, her childhood sweetheart of 10 years. Both were 
excited and looking forward to a bright future together filled with love and 
happiness. This has now been cruelly taken away.

“Carly, may you soar with the angels and we pray with all our hearts that this 
evil, and such disregard for human life, will end so no other family will feel 
the pain that we do today and always will.”

Kyle Leeman, a childhood friend, told the Mirror 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tunisia-hotel-attack-carly-lovett-5958133>
 that Lovett was a “kind and outgoing person”. He said: “She got me into a lot 
of the music I am into. We had really great times together. She was always one 
to express herself. I am really so sorry for all of her family.”

On her beauty blog, CEE JAY ELL <http://ceejayell.blogspot.co.uk/>, Lovett 
described herself as a “beauty junkie/closet hoarder/design lover”.

“I’m not remotely a beauty expert and probably don’t have much beauty 
knowledge at all, but so what! I like beauty a lot, love trying new things and 
experimenting – I may not blend to perfection, and more often than not I apply 
eyeshadow with my fingers – but beauty doesn’t have to mean conformity!”

Several prominent beauty bloggers have paid tribute to Lovett on Twitter. DJ 
Zoe London, a popular YouTuber,wrote 
<https://twitter.com/zoelondondj/status/614557830423707648?lang=en>: 
“Heartbroken to learn tonight that blogger @ceejayell_ was caught up in the 
attack in tunisia. she was always so lovely. RIP. so, so sad. I hope soon there 
is an end to this terror. all my thoughts are with Carly’s family right now.”

Lovett’s MP, Sir Edward Leigh, described his “shock and sorrow” at the news.

sort of bloke who wouldn’t hurt anyone.”

hear Denis and Elaine Thwaites from Blackpool among those killed in the 
terrorist attack in Sousse and condolences to their family.”

everyone else before herself,” her family said in a statement released through

in terrible shock. She paid tribute to “a very popular member of the team”, who 
“was like a bottle of pop, very lively and always smiling”.

John Welch, 74, from Corstone, and Eileen Swannack, 73, from Biddlestone, are 
said to have loved Tunisia, and were regular visitors to the beach resort of 
Sousse, a place they are said to have “adored”. It is reported they had stayed 
at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel on a previous occasion.

The pair had arrived on the Tuesday before the attacks and had planned to stay 
for a week. They had previously been reported missing before confirmation of 
their deaths.


The pair’s families said they are “devastated” by the loss of their loved ones 
in such a “terrible manner”. Swannack’s granddaughter Lucie said in a Facebook 
post: “I’m heartbroken she’s been taken from us in such a cruel way.”

Welch, a former plumber, is said to have been in a relationship with Swannack 
for eight years. Messages of condolence have been left outside her home and the 
flag of the local football club has been flying at half mast, the Western Daily 
Press reported.

 The family of John and Janet Stocker, who took to social media to seek 
information about the couple, released a statement via the Foreign Office 
confirming their death.

 They were, the statement said, “the happiest, most loving couple who enjoyed 
life’s simple pleasures, as well as the pleasures and love of their extensive 
family and many friends. But most of all they were still very much in love with 
each other.”

 It added: “They were both young at heart and enjoyed all that life could 
offer, and especially enjoyed travelling to new places, exploring and 
appreciating local cultures. They died together doing what they enjoyed most, 
sunbathing side by side.”

 John Stocker, 74, was a retired printer. He and his 63-year-old wife had five 
children and 10 grandchildren, the statement added.

The couple’s family confirmed on Wednesday that the married couple, who lived 
in the Killingbeck area of Leeds, were among the victims. The couple are 
reported to have had three children and a number of grandchildren.

In a statement issued through West Yorkshire police, the family said: “We are 
deeply saddened by the loss of both mum Sharon and dad Christopher who were 
taken from us during the terrorist attacks in Tunisia. As a family we are 
grieving and we would ask that our privacy be respected at this difficult time.”


Christopher is believed to have worked in the ticket office at Leeds railway 
station, while Sharon was a domiciliary care manager for a healthcare company. 
Colleagues told the Yorkshire Evening Post that she would be sadly missed. 
Craig Roberts said: “What’s really sad is that she spent her life looking after 
other people. She was a very caring, loving woman and all our thoughts and 
prayers are with her family at this difficult time.” He told the paper that 
Christopher had attended Christmas parties with his wife and was a “lovely man”.

Neighbours of the pair paid tribute to a nice couple who “kept themselves to 
themselves”. “I’ve watched their kids growing up. I’ve watched their grandkids 
growing up. It’s devastating, absolutely devastating,” Mark Brady told ITV 
Calendar.

and has been described as a keen walker who enjoyed keeping fit after 
undergoing heart surgery. He is said to have been on holiday with his partner, 
Anne, the Newbury Weekly News reported.


Neighbour Claire Chambers told the paper that he was “quite a character”. “He 
was a very vibrant man and someone who was very fit and active,” she said.

shocking news of the shootings in Tunisia, and to hear that one of the victims 
is David Thompson, one of my constituents from Tadley.


“His family, indeed every family and loved one going through this terrible 
time, are in my thoughts. They have my deepest sympathies.”

Lorna Carty, an Irish national, was on holiday with her husband, Declan, a 
dairy farmer, who was recovering from heart surgery. Family and friends said 
the break in Tunisia was a gift to the couple following Declan’s operation.

Carty, a mother of two in her mid-50s, was believed to have been on the beach 
alone when the gunman struck. Declan Carty, who was inside the hotel at the 
time, was uninjured and is said to be absolutely distraught.

“Lorna rushed her husband to hospital about a fortnight ago after he was 
getting pains in his heart. He had to get stents in,” a family friend said. 
“They went to Tunisia to have a bit of a holiday after the operation.”

Carty was a nurse in a GP surgery in Navan. She had a son and a daughter and 
the family are keen supporters of the local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). 
Their son, Simon, 21, is on the Meath Senior GAA football team and was looking 
after their small farm while his parents were away, according to Associated 
Press. Their daughter, Hazel, 18, is understood to have been on holiday in 
Turkey after finishing her exams.

Simon Carty has flown to Tunisia to be with his father , while Hazel has 
returned to Ireland from Turkey as the Robinstown community prepare for her 
mother’s funeral, which might take place this week.

She had an adult son and worked in the kitchens at the Saint-Luc medical 
clinic in the Bouge area of the city, reports say.

A spokesman for the municipal authority told local media her husband was a 
well-known figure on the local basketball scene, where he had been a volunteer 
for decades. “Police have been mobilised to provide psychological support and 
appropriate assistance to Mr Lemaire and his family,”a spokesman told La Libre

Emile Lemaire, who was on holiday with his wife and two friends, related their 
ordeal on Friday in aninterview with L’Avenir 
<http://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20150627_00670256>. He described them taking 
refuge under chairs as the gunman opened fire on the beach, hitting him in the 
arm.

When he spoke to the media, his wife had been taken to hospital unconscious, 
but he had not known where. He was desperately trying to make contact with the 
Belgian and Tunisian authorities. He was told on Saturday that she had died.
