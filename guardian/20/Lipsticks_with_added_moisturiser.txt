A hat, a scarf, a coat buttoned up to here, and the only spotlight of colour 
in a landscape of dark wool and mulched leaves – your perfectly painted lips.

formulations means lipstick can be worn sheer and rosy or matte and dark, both 
offering the kind of soft care and relief you need this winter.
