successive league games, including the 1-0 defeat at home against Carlisle on 
Saturday, and have won only four of 20 matches in 2016.

Crawley also have the third-worst goal difference in the fourth tier, behind 
the already relegated Dagenham & Redbridge and York City.

A statement on the club website 
<http://www.crawleytownfc.com/news/article/crawley-town-3079765.aspx> said: 
“Firstly, we would like to thank Mark and Jimmy for the job they have done this 
season. Mark and Jimmy have worked hard for the club. However, the recent form 
and performance of the team suggests change is needed.

“We wish Mark and Jimmy the best of luck in their future challenges.

“The board will be interviewing candidates in the next few days to make the 
right appointment to move the club forward. The days and weeks ahead will 
determine the right path for the club. There will be no further comment from 
the club at this time.”
