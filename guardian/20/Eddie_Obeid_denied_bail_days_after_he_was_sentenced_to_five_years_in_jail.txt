Former NSW minister Eddie Obeid <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eddie-obeid>
 won’t be home for Christmas after losing his bid for bail pending his 
conviction appeal which may be heard in March.

The NSW court of criminal appeal on Tuesday found that his proposed grounds 
and other matters did not amount to “special or exceptional” circumstances to 
warrant bail being granted.

The 73-year-old former Labor powerbroker was jailed for a maximum of five 
years on Thursday after being found guilty of misconduct in public office in 
2007.


Obeid’s spectacular fall

comes after lobbying a senior public servant in a 2007 phone call about a 
series of lucrative Circular Quay leases without revealing his family’s 
interests.

Judge sentences Eddie Obeid to jail for misconduct

His offence was not a failure to disclose those interests but in communicating 
with the public servant for the purpose of advancing his or his family’s 
pecuniary interests, Justice Robert Beech-Jones said in handing down the 
maximum five-year sentence.

The appeal court would be able to hear the challenge on 15 March, said Chief 
Justice Tom Bathurst, sitting with Justice Clifton Hoeben and Robert Allan 
Hulme.

“So far as matters raised in the grounds of appeal, they could have been 
raised before the trial judge and no direct explanation has been given as to 
the reason why that did not happen,” he said.

But he said the proposed grounds were arguable, although not sufficiently 
strong to warrant bail being granted before the hearing.

Obeid, who was wearing prison greens during his appearance from Silverwater 
jail via videolink, showed no outward response to the decision.
