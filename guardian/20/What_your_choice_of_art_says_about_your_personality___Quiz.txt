A study carried out at the University of Amsterdam found that participants who 
prefer abstract over figurative (ie “traditional”) paintings generally score 
higher on measures of sensation seeking. Those who prefer figurative paintings 
(who also tend to dislike open-ended plays) score higher on tests that measure 
“need for cognitive closure”. That is, they show a strong preference for order 
(eg for rules and hierarchies in the workplace), predictability (eg daily or 
weekly routines), and decisiveness (“I don’t care which, but please pick one 
now!”) and are uncomfortable with ambiguity (eg they tend to see arguments in 
terms of who’s right and who’s wrong, rather than as mere differences of 
opinion).
