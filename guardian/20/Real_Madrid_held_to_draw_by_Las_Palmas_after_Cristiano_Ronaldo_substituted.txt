Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> dropped points 
for the second game in a row as a 2-2 draw away to Las Palmas allowed Barcelona 
to cut their lead at the top of La Liga to a single point.

Zinedine Zidane’s men suffered the disappointment of missing out on a 
top-flight record 17 consecutive wins when they were held level by Villarreal 
at the Bernabéu on Wednesday night and they twice let leads slip in Gran 
Canaria on Saturday.

Marco Asensio headed them in front but Tana equalised to leave the scores 
level at the break. Substitute Karim Benzema restored Real’s lead when he 
followed up to score after a Cristiano Ronaldo shot was blocked.

The Portuguese looked deeply unimpressed to be substituted with 18 minutes to 
go, and his mood would not have been improved whenLas Palmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laspalmas> equalised with five minutes 
left through Sergio Araujo.

“We lost two points that are needed to win the league,” the Madrid striker 
Álvaro Morata said. “We had to win this game.”

Zidane took Ronaldo off after 72 minutes with the Portugal captain, who had 
failed to score on Wednesday, having endured another disappointing performance.

“He always wants to be on the pitch but we have a game on Tuesday and I felt 
he needed to rest,” Zidane said, referring to their Champions league match at 
Borussia Dortmund.
