Robert Lewandowski scored both goals as the runaway leaders, Bayern Munich, 
coasted to a 2-0 win at home to relegation-threatenedHoffenheim.

The win maintained Bayern’s 100% Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> home record after 10 
games at the Allianz Arena and kept them eight points ahead ofBorussia Dortmund
, who beatIngolstadt 2-0 on Saturday.

The Bavarians have won 17, drawn one and lost once in 19 Bundesliga games, 
scored 50 goals and conceded only nine in an almost embarrassing dominance of 
the Bundesliga as they close in on a fourth successive title.

Hoffenheim, who have won only twice, stayed one place off the bottom with 14 
points.

Last season’s runners-up, VfL Wolfsburg, extended their winless run to six 
matches when they were held 1-1 at home byCologne in Sunday’s other game.

Bayern created plenty of early chances in driving rain and Lewandowski put 
them ahead in the 32nd minute from close range from a chance set up by Douglas 
Costa’s trickery on the left.

Bayern occasionally looked vulnerable and Andrej Kramaric, on loan from 
Leicester City, wasted two precious chances to equalise.

The Croat shot weakly at Manuel Neuer just before halftime and missed an even 
better chance after the break when he broke clear on the right and slipped his 
marker, only to fire wide with only Neuer to beat.

Lewandowski made Hoffenheim pay in the 64th minute when he ran on to Philipp 
Lahm’s defence-splitting pass and dinked the ball over Oliver Baumann. It was 
the Poland forward’s 19th league goal of the season.

Seventh-placed Wolfsburg appeared set to win for the first time this year when 
Julian Draxler volleyed home from Vierinha’s cross in the 67th minute.

However, Cologne replied eight minutes later when Anthony Modeste curled the 
ball in from 15 metres for his ninth goal of the season.
