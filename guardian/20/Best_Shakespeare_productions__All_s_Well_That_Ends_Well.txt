This supposedly unloved comedy often comes up trumps in the theatre. The basic 
idea of a poor physician's daughter curing a sick king and claiming a husband 
as reward may stem fromBoccaccio 
<http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio>. But the 
fairytale world reveals a heroine whom Shaw admired for her "sovereign charm" 
and sits well with modern gender politics.

I've seen a host of fine productions, starting with one by the late, great 
Tyrone Guthrie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/24/g-for-tyrone-guthrie> at 
Stratford in 1959. Guthrie made no attempt to impose unity on the play, but 
acknowledged its different genres.Edith Evans 
<http://www.biography.com/people/edith-evans-9289641#awesm=~oCsiojgnc1laKv> as 
the Countess presided over a Chekhovian Rousillon. The military episodes had 
the farcical flavour of a popular TV series,The Army Game 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Army_Game>. And the French court had echoes of
Franz Lehar operetta 
<http://www.classicalarchives.com/composer/7144.html#tvf=tracks&tv=about>: I've 
never forgotten the sight ofRobert Hardy 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21584842> as the miraculously 
restored king waltzing into the court withZoe Caldwell 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEqjr2Y74MM>'s Helena.

Since then, I've enjoyed countless productions: by John Barton 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barton_%28director%29> (1967), Trevor Nunn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/trevor-nunn> (1982), Peter Hall (1992), Greg 
Doran (2003) all for the RSC as well as aJonathan Miller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/10/jonathan-miller-interview> 
revival at Greenwich (1975) and one byMarianne Elliott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/20/national-theatre-50-marianne-elliott>
 for the National in 2009. Performances that stand out includeBarbara Jefford 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/dd893ec6> and
Judi Dench 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/04/judi-dench-five-best-moments> as 
the Countess in, respectively, the Hall and Doran productions.

But it was a recent Nancy Meckler 
<http://www.scottishballet.co.uk/a-streetcar-named-desire/about.html> revival 
at Stratford in 2013 that tops even those. It offered a distinctly feminist 
reading withJoanna Horton's shy Helena 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CusYwXyugwc> finding supportive aid from 
Charlotte Cornwell's sardonically gracious Countess 
<http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/theatre/charlotte-cornwell--returns-rsc-6171248>
.

The braggart Parollles was also brilliantly played by Jonathan Slinger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/11/jonathan-slinger-hamlet> as a 
closeted gay with a fake military accent. I still cherish memories of the 
Guthrie version, but Meckler's was the best of modern times.
