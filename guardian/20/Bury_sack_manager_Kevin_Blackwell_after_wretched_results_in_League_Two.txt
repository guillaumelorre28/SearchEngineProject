Bury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bury> have parted company with 
manager Kevin Blackwell following a run of poor results.

The Shakers are without a win in their last six league matches and languish in 
21st inLeague Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball>.

A statement on the club's official website confirmed Blackwell's contract has 
been terminated with immediate effect.

Blackwell took over from Peter Shirtliff at Gigg Lane last September after the 
club – then in League One – had failed to register a win in their opening nine 
games of the season.

They were rooted to the foot of the table and it took another seven matches 
before they finally gained a victory. Blackwell, who had been out of the game 
for two years prior to his appointment, was unable to prevent relegation and 
their poor form has continued into the current campaign.

They are only one point above the relegation area and lost 2-0 at home to 
Morecambe at the weekend.
