Ronny Deila said Leigh Griffiths could end up among the Celtic greats after he 
went through the half-century mark of goals for the club with a double in the 
4-1 win at the bottom sideDundee United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited>.

The striker took 21 minutes to take his tally to 50 in 60 starts – the fastest 
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> player to reach that 
landmark since Charlie Nicholas in the early 1980s – before the defender Jozo 
Simunovic doubled the visitors’ lead with his first goal for the club.

The United striker Simon Murray reduced the deficit just after the half-hour 
but Griffiths grabbed his second three minutes after the restart. Kris Commons 
added a fourth to take Celtic six points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the 
table.

Griffiths reached the 50-goal mark quicker than other Parkhead heroes such as 
Henrik Larsson and John Hartson and, asked if the former Wolves striker, who 
has scored 24 goals this season, could become a club legend, Deila, the 
manager, said: “It is a very good performance to get to 50 so early. I am 
delighted with the way he plays.

“He has a five-year deal here so there is a good chance if he keeps scoring 
like this, that he can be a legend.

“When you say those names and say he has scored more goals than them in the 
same period, then he has a big opportunity to really make a mark in Celtic’s 
history.”

Griffiths struggled at first under Deila but the Norwegian praised the 
25-year-old’s application in the past year.

Deila, who will talk to the striker Anthony Stokes on Saturday about a 
possible loan move to Hibernian, said: “It is a message to everybody in life: 
if you want to change and you want to sacrifice to become the player you can be 
then everything is possible and he has done that. Now he is kicking on and 
scoring because he is prepared for every match.”

Griffith was booked by the referee, Bobby Madden, for taking his top off after 
scoring his first goal to reveal a T-shirt with the number 50 emblazoned on the 
front but he claimed it was “a million per cent” worth it.

He said: “It was an added incentive to go and get that goal and I knew when 
the chance came as long as I put it on target I would score.

“I texted Stevie [the kit man] this morning to get a T-shirt made up for me 
and Broony [Scott Brown, the captain] said I should have had 51 under it. Two 
T-shirts, but I might have looked a little bit chunky.

“To get 50 goals for any club is a special achievement but to get 50 at a 
massive club like this is a joy.

“But I can’t score goals without my team-mates and the most important thing 
was three points.”
