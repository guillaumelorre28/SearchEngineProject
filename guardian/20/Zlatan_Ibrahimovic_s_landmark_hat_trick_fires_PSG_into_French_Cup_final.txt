Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> thrashed Saint-Etienne 
4-1 to reach the French Cup final.

Ibrahimovic took his PSG tally to 102 goals since joining three years ago, and 
Ezequiel Lavezzi added the other as the Ligue 1 leaders advanced to meet 
Auxerre in the final.

PSG took the lead from the penalty spot after the Saint-Etienne right-back, 
François Clerc, brought down Lavezzi and Ibrahimovic sent Stéphane Ruffier the 
wrong way.

Romain Hamouma equalised four minutes later, heading in a left-wing cross from 
his fellow winger Yohan Mollo, but PSG cut loose in the final 30 minutes.

Lavezzi headed in Javier Pastore’s superb cross from the right to put PSG back 
in the lead on the hour before Ibrahimovic scored his second in the 81st minute 
and struck again in injury time.
