Stand Comedy Club, Edinburgh

We’re coming to the end of the most tumultuous political year many of us can 
remember. And only one comedy show has risen to the challenge it’s posed. 
Bridget Christie’s Brexit standup show Because You Demanded It was the funniest 
and most proportionate response I’ve seen to this summer’s vote to leave the 
EU. It was also the first: what made Christie’s response to these fast-moving 
political events especially impressive was that it wasknocked up in just six 
weeks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/11/bridget-christie-five-star-review-edinburgh-furious-brexit>
 between the referendum and her opening gigs on the Edinburgh fringe.

The urgency was inseparable from the hilarity. Comedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> is all about timing, they say, and 
Christie’s was perfect, as she launched a furious, impotent, playful tirade 
just as the initial shock of Brexit was fading. What made the show (a 
last-minute replacement for a planned set about mortality) so bracing was 
Christie’s gibbering attack on the very idea that a spike in racist violence, 
the rejection of expertise and the betrayal of Britain’s tradition of openness 
should ever be allowed to become our new normal.

None of this landed like a harangue. Christie is too skilful and has too keen 
a sense of her own ridiculousness for that. So the pro-remain arguments came 
couched in daft set pieces about horticulture and detours via her husband’s 
thoughts on labiaplasty. There was full-throttle expressivity, too, as 
Christie’s body threatened to burst and her eyes to pop with outrage at what’s 
happening to us and our country. If you felt the same, her show was the most 
vigorous tonic. And even if you didn’t, you’d surely still enjoy a masterclass 
in tub-thumping political clown comedy.

 Jaw-dropping trickery … Nick Mohammed, centre, as Mr Swallow. Photograph: 
Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian 
Judging by his repeated snubs by awards panels, some comedy-watchers must be 
allergic to Nick Mohammed’s Mr Swallow. You can see why: this camp, solipsistic 
chatterbox is irritating – deliberately so. But put him at the centre of a 
musical-theatre show (as Mohammed does for the second time with this
comedy/escapology hybrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/16/mr-swallow-houdini-edinburgh-festival-review-nick-mohammed>
) and he can be joyously ridiculous. I found Houdini’s mix of old-school gags, 
meta-comedy and jaw-dropping trickery irresistible.

 Darkly funny … Richard Gadd. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian 
This year’s Edinburgh fringe was distinguished by the volume and quality of 
comedians putting their personal trauma front and centre stage. So it was apt 
that the 2016 Comedy award was won by the Scottish shlock comicRichard Gadd for 
his most intimate show yet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/richard-gadd-review-banshee-labyrinth-edinburgh>
 – a scorching confessional about masculinity and abuse dredged from the pit of 
Gadd’s neurosis and delivered while pounding a treadmill. Comedy as therapy? 
Yes, but brilliantly constructed and darkly funny.

The theatre-cabaret-comedy hybrid Triple Threat was one of the buzziest shows 
on the fringe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/01/lucy-mccormick-triple-threat-comedy-autumn-arts-preview>
, not only because it sexed up of the life of Christ with gleeful irreverence, 
nor for its satire of pop culture’s messianic pretensions – but because Lucy 
McCormick’s trash-diva, all-dancing, all-posing performance was so hilariously 
entertaining.

Lee’s new set 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/17/stewart-lee-content-provider-comedy-review-leicester-square-theatre-london>
 found the éminence grise of contemporary comedy in unusually loose and playful 
form – visibly enjoying himself, of all things. Yes, you could see the joins 
between the Brexit material and the critique of 21st-century digi-narcissism 
that Lee had originally intended to deliver. But Content Provider remained a 
blissfully funny and skilful show.

Returning to Britain with a reputation for incendiary brilliance after his 
first UK stint in the late noughties, Dutchman Hans Teeuwen might easily have 
failed to live up to the notoriety. His2016 show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/09/hans-teeuwen-real-rancour-review-soho-theatre-london>
 did signal a change – from demented variety act to something closer to 
standup. But his aggressive oddity and zeal for provocation remained intact, 
and delivered another extraordinary show.

performed byMarco Chenevier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/21/theatre-comedy-best-of-be-festival-quintetto-tida-marco-chenevier>
 for the Italian company TIDA. Chenevier’s performance as pissed-off ringmaster 
of the inept volunteers helping stage his cash-strapped show is a miniature 
masterpiece of timing, expressivity and audience management – and made me laugh 
lots.

<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/18/norris-and-parker-see-you-at-the-gallows-edinburgh-review>
. But the show was more silly than sepulchral, as details of the duo’s fraught 
relationship (Norris wants to quit comedy and get married; Parker is depressed 
and unloved) were pencilled in among the sketches. A memorably uproarious hour.
