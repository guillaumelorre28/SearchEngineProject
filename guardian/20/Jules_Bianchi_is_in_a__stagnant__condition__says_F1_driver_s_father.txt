The father of the injured Formula One driver Jules Bianchi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jules-bianchi> said his son’s medical 
condition is “stagnant” as he continues to fight for his life in a French 
hospital.

Speaking in an interview with Canal Plus television, Philippe Bianchi 
struggled to contain his emotions as he said: “The situation is stagnant, 
Jules’ neurological progress is not what we would like.”

The 25-year-old Marussia driver sustained severe head injuries when his car 
crashed into a crane that was removing a stranded car at the Japanese Grand 
Prix in Octoberand has been in a coma ever since

. “The first thing is that Jules is alive – that’s the most important thing for 
us,” Philippe Bianchi said. “He’s fighting with the weapons that he has. In 
neurological terms, I’m not sure he is able to do much now. The situation is 
stagnant. Jules’ neurological progress is not what we would like it to be.

“Seeing him fighting gives a lot of hope to his loved ones, and it’s important 
for us. While there is life, there is hope, even though after a while you are 
hoping for a miracle. Every day is difficult. Every day, when we get up, the 
telephone is by our side. When we get up every morning, we think of Jules’ 
life. We think also of his death, because we have to think about death.

“We have to think about death because we are in a situation where we know a 
lot of things can happen. It’s terrible. I think we all stopped living that 
day, the fifth of October. It’s something you can never expect. It’s not what 
Jules wants, being in a hospital bed. It’s not his life – it’s not what we want 
either. But we have to keep hope.”
