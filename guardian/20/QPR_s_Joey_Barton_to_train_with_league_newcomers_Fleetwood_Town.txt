Joey Barton is to train with the Football League newcomers, Fleetwood Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fleetwood-town>, to prepare for his late 
entry to the new season.

The QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> midfielder was handed a 
12-game suspension following his red card and violent reaction during the 
club's 3-2 defeat by Manchester City on the final day of the Premier League 
season. Barton elbowed Carlos Tevez and kicked Sergio Ag√ºero before attempting 
to headbutt Vincent Kompany.

As his QPR team-mates continue their preparations for the 2012-13 Premier 
League campaign, Barton will work on his fitness with the Lancashire club, who 
won the Blue Square Premier last season.

The 29-year-old said, via Twitter: "Looking forward to training with Fleetwood 
Town for the week. Will get a much needed sweat on...

"Still have 3 years left at QPR. Exciting times for the club, which I intended 
to be a part of. Need to get some fitness in the meantime...

"Fleetwood are a young club going places. 5 promotions already in the last few 
years. If I help some of their young players, great.

"Training with them will certainly help me with my short-term fitness and my 
plan on being as fit as possible during my 12-game ban."
