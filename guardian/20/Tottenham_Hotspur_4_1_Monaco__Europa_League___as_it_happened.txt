This game was over by the 38th minute, when Eric Lamela swept in his third 
goal, butMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> were on the ropes 
long before that. They looked cumbersome at the back, their full-backs were 
pushed far too forward, their midfield lacked bite and gave the ball away too 
many times in key areas, which lead directly to two of the four goals. 
Tottenham never had to get out of second gear, but Pochettino will be pleased: 
Onomah made his first start for the Spurs, Carroll got his first goal, and 
Lamela continued his excellent form in the Europa League: I make that six goals 
in five games this season. He’s beginning to show a good level of consistency 
in all competitions, but obviously thrives best when the game is more tactical 
in Europe, rather than the pinball nature of the Premier League.

Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. I’m off for another walnut. 
Here’s some final thoughts from MisterKevin.
MisterKevin (@MrKAK27) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> All this angst from the 
EPL teams about the Europa League smacks of a fear that maybe they're just not 
good enough for it.

this much about Thursday Night football.

Full-time: Tottenham 4-1 Monaco

Tottenham top Group J. Anderlecht are second. Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> are out. Qarabag are bottom.

I wonder how long Moutinho will hang about at Monaco. He’s simply too good to 
hang about at that level, although I’m sure he’s being amply compensated for 
his troubles.

89 min: Monaco are tiring and the game is opening up for the fresh legs of 
Alli and co. The substitute has time to turn in the centre circle and plays a 
nice through ball to Son, but it’s juuuuuuuust too strong for the forward and 
Subasic is able to come out and clear.

87 min: The game is cantering to a close. The Spurs fans have started cheering 
every pass, of which there are many. Snack update: I have just cracked my first 
ever walnut, someone from the subs desk has just given me one. I mean I’veeaten 
them before, I never knew how big they were uncracked. It’s reassuring to know 
that they are about the same size of a Walnut Whip.

84 min: Hello from Istanbul!”, writes Philip West. “I think that what we all 
need is for the other teams in Europe – maybe 8192 of them – to play a purely 
knockout competition with no seeding over 28 weeks (let’s say on Fridays just 
to be extreme) with games over two legs. We could call it “The Euromarathon 
Cup” and the winners would get automatic entry into a CL group similar to 
Eurovase. If Uefa suits are reading this then I claim 2% intellectual property 
rights.”

Fiver-esque cynicism there. I like it.

80 min: Bit of an update on Dier, by the way. He’s back in the stands and 
looking like he’s not too upset about anything, laughing and joking with his 
team-mates. Apparently when he walked off, he told Pochettino, “I’m fine 
gaffer, I’m fine.”

GOAL! Tottenham 4-1 Monaco (Carroll 77)
 Tottenham’s Tom Carroll scores his first goal for the club, sealing the win 
with their fourth of the match. Photograph: JMP/REX Shutterstock 
Carroll’s first ever Tottenham goal! He’s only had to wait five years. I could 
go on about the terribleMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> 
defending, About Dirar’s poor clearance after Clinton’s shot, about how 
Toulalan and Elderson got in each other’s way, about Subasic’s woeful 
positioning. But I won’t. Tom Carroll wins the ball in Monaco’s penalty box, 
waltzes to the byline and squeezes the ball under the goalkeeper from an 
impossible angle. Game. Set. Match.

73 min: This is getting silly. Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> again commit far too many forward 
at the corner, and although Wallace squanders a good chance, they are caught 
short at the back. Clinton breaks at lightning pace away and suddenly he’s 
one-on-one with the creaky Toulalan. As Clinton kicks and rushes beyond the 
grey-haired veteran, Toulalan commits one of the most cynical fouls you are 
likely to see all season. He didn’t even pretend like he was going for the 
ball. Yellow card, Toulalan is a picture of innocence with his hands on his 
hips. He couldn’t look more French. Wallace is also booked for dissent.

70 min: Tottenham are showing a degree of maturity here. They recognised that, 
for five minutes at least, they were coming under a bit of pressure. So they’ve 
simply settled into a nice period of possession, just to calm everything down a 
bit.

Yep, nobody wants to compete for the Plate Plate. London Live might show it on

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>. Diarra is a defender, Silva was 
an attacking midfielder. Not sure what part of gung-ho Leonardo Jardim fails to 
understand here. Surely they’ve just got to go for it?

GOAL! Tottenham 3-1 Monaco (El Shaarawy 60)

The substitute Mbappe makes an instant impact! Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> just Pochettinoed Tottenham, with 
the sub nicking the ball off Tripper. From there, El Shaarawy picks the ball up 
in space outside the area, gets his head up, and bends a delicious shot just 
inside Lloris’ far post. Great finish. Boy has still got skills.
 Monaco’s talented Stephan El Shaarawy pulls one back for the visitors.

56 min: Onomah so close to his first Tottenham goal! Trippier gets forward 
down this right-hand side and whips a low cross into Son’s feet. Again the 
South Korean has time to turn inside the penalty box and he slips in Onomah, 
who breaks the first tackle from Dirar and shoots, with Subasic just about to 
get a boot on it, with the ball rebounding behind.

life a little easier for everybody.

“In answer to your question this evening, I think the parachute from the 
Champions League is a bad idea because:
A) The teams already in the Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> hate it


B) The teams from the Champions League who never wanted to be in the Europa 
League hate it


C) The fans of all clubs involved hate it


D) I hate it


E) Justin Bieber hates it


F) The Queen hates it


G) Dr Who hates it


H) The Duke of Earl hates it. And nothing can stop him.
I) and most importantly, Michel Platini likes it.”

48 min: Just as we’ve seen the best of Bentaleb, now we see the worst. This 
time, he tries to be too clever and has his pocket picked by Lemar, who drives 
towards goal and shoots wide when he might have played in a team-mate. Bentaleb 
is booked, he tried (unsuccessfully) to impede Lemar when he lost the ball.

Michael Aston has some more thoughts on Champions League teams dropping into 
theEuropa League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league>.

“The failing CL teams getting another shot at a CL spot and another trophy is 
ridiculous. just absurd and so unfair. It’s as if Uefa want to ensure their 
money teams get yet another chance to fill the coffers and trophy bank. Has to 
stop.”

Mats Anderson, meanwhile is still banging the drum.

“Unfair? Being unjustly treated? Protest Make a lot of noise. Demand justice. 
I’ll join the demo. Fight the power!”

Half-time entertainment: it’s Emmanuel Adebayor dancing. He doesn’t seem to be 
missing football too much. According to some reports, Spurs are still paying 
him £100,000-a-week. Which seems to be working out alright for him.

He’s also just dropped over £300,000 on a new Rolls-Royce …

This game was over by the 38th minute, when Eric Lamela swept in his third 
goal, butMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> were on the ropes 
long before that. They looked cumbersome at the back, their full-backs were 
pushed far too forward, their midfield lacked bite and gave the ball away too 
many times in key areas, which lead directly to two of the four goals. 
Tottenham never had to get out of second gear, but Pochettino will be pleased: 
Onomah made his first start for the Spurs, Carroll got his first goal, and 
Lamela continued his excellent form in the Europa League: I make that six goals 
in five games this season. He’s beginning to show a good level of consistency 
in all competitions, but obviously thrives best when the game is more tactical 
in Europe, rather than the pinball nature of the Premier League.

Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. I’m off for another walnut.

MisterKevin (@MrKAK27) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> All this angst from the 
EPL teams about the Europa League smacks of a fear that maybe they're just not 
good enough for it.

Erik Lamela hat-trick puts Tottenham in cruise control against Monaco

Tottenham top Group J. Anderlecht are second. Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> are out. Qarabag are bottom.

ensured Monaco go out. Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty Images 
I wonder how long Moutinho will hang about at Monaco. He’s simply too good to 
hang about at that level, although I’m sure he’s being amply compensated for 
his troubles.
 
90 min: Two minutes added on here. The Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> fans are still in good voice, 
swinging their scarves around.
 
89 min: Monaco are tiring and the game is opening up for the fresh legs of 
Alli and co. The substitute has time to turn in the centre circle and plays a 
nice through ball to Son, but it’s juuuuuuuust too strong for the forward and 
Subasic is able to come out and clear.
 
87 min: The game is cantering to a close. The Spurs fans have started cheering 
every pass, of which there are many. Snack update: I have just cracked my first 
ever walnut, someone from the subs desk has just given me one. I mean I’veeaten 
them before, I never knew how big they were uncracked. It’s reassuring to know 
that they are about the same size of a Walnut Whip.
 
84 min: Hello from Istanbul!”, writes Philip West. “I think that what we all 
need is for the other teams in Europe – maybe 8192 of them – to play a purely 
knockout competition with no seeding over 28 weeks (let’s say on Fridays just 
to be extreme) with games over two legs. We could call it “The Euromarathon 
Cup” and the winners would get automatic entry into a CL group similar to 
Eurovase. If Uefa suits are reading this then I claim 2% intellectual property 
rights.”

Fiver-esque cynicism there. I like it.
 
82 min: Bit of a naughty challenge from Alli on Mbappe. The England 
international is lucky not to see yellow there.
 
80 min: Bit of an update on Dier, by the way. He’s back in the stands and 
looking like he’s not too upset about anything, laughing and joking with his 
team-mates. Apparently when he walked off, he told Pochettino, “I’m fine 
gaffer, I’m fine.”
 
79 min: Just what Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> want to 
see: Dele Alli. He’s on for Clinton.
  Tottenham’s Tom Carroll scores his first goal for the club, sealing the win 
with their fourth of the match. Photograph: JMP/REX Shutterstock 
Carroll’s first ever Tottenham goal! He’s only had to wait five years. I could 
go on about the terribleMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> 
defending, About Dirar’s poor clearance after Clinton’s shot, about how 
Toulalan and Elderson got in each other’s way, about Subasic’s woeful 
positioning. But I won’t. Tom Carroll wins the ball in Monaco’s penalty box, 
waltzes to the byline and squeezes the ball under the goalkeeper from an 
impossible angle. Game. Set. Match.
 
73 min: This is getting silly. Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> again commit far too many forward 
at the corner, and although Wallace squanders a good chance, they are caught 
short at the back. Clinton breaks at lightning pace away and suddenly he’s 
one-on-one with the creaky Toulalan. As Clinton kicks and rushes beyond the 
grey-haired veteran, Toulalan commits one of the most cynical fouls you are 
likely to see all season. He didn’t even pretend like he was going for the 
ball. Yellow card, Toulalan is a picture of innocence with his hands on his 
hips. He couldn’t look more French. Wallace is also booked for dissent.
 
70 min: Tottenham are showing a degree of maturity here. They recognised that, 
for five minutes at least, they were coming under a bit of pressure. So they’ve 
simply settled into a nice period of possession, just to calm everything down a 
bit.
 
67 min: “What about a new 3rd tier competition for 4th place Champions League 
teams and 3rd placedEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> teams. Too much?” 
asks Matthew Drake.

Yep, nobody wants to compete for the Plate Plate. London Live might show it on 
TV, though.
 
64 min: More changes: Diarra on, Bernardo Silva off for Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>. Diarra is a defender, Silva was 
an attacking midfielder. Not sure what part of gung-ho Leonardo Jardim fails to 
understand here. Surely they’ve just got to go for it?
 
62 min: Another chance for Monaco! Ohhhhh! It’s a golden one! Dirar has a 
simple header at the back post from aMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> corner but he get’s it all wrong 
and it bounces just over.
 
61 min: Tottenham are next to make a change: Chadli marking his return to 
injury, coming on for the hat-trick hero Lamela.

3 - Erik Lamela has scored the first hat-trick for an English club v Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> since Tony Yeboah for Leeds in 
September 1995. Trois.

The substitute Mbappe makes an instant impact! Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> just Pochettinoed Tottenham, with 
the sub nicking the ball off Tripper. From there, El Shaarawy picks the ball up 
in space outside the area, gets his head up, and bends a delicious shot just 
inside Lloris’ far post. Great finish. Boy has still got skills.

59 min: Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> have made a 
change: Mbappe on, Traore off.
 
58 min: It might be too little, too late (S/O JoJo) but Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> are showing signs of life. Lemar 
has made a difference since he came on.
 
56 min: Onomah so close to his first Tottenham goal! Trippier gets forward 
down this right-hand side and whips a low cross into Son’s feet. Again the 
South Korean has time to turn inside the penalty box and he slips in Onomah, 
who breaks the first tackle from Dirar and shoots, with Subasic just about to 
get a boot on it, with the ball rebounding behind.

52 min: If I have to listen to Clive Allen try and say ‘Ligue 1’ one more 
time, I’m packing this in.
 
50 min: Tim Whelan has kindly dissected his email into bulletpoints to make 
life a little easier for everybody.

“In answer to your question this evening, I think the parachute from the 
Champions League is a bad idea because:
A) The teams already in the Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> hate it


B) The teams from the Champions League who never wanted to be in the Europa 
League hate it


C) The fans of all clubs involved hate it


D) I hate it


E) Justin Bieber hates it


F) The Queen hates it


G) Dr Who hates it


H) The Duke of Earl hates it. And nothing can stop him.
I) and most importantly, Michel Platini likes it.”

 
48 min: Just as we’ve seen the best of Bentaleb, now we see the worst. This 
time, he tries to be too clever and has his pocket picked by Lemar, who drives 
towards goal and shoots wide when he might have played in a team-mate. Bentaleb 
is booked, he tried (unsuccessfully) to impede Lemar when he lost the ball.
 
46 min: Bentaleb gets the second half underway with a sublime bit of skill, 
lifting the ball over his marker with a Berbatov-esque touch.
 
Peeeep peeep! We’re underway again. Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> have made a change: Lemar on for 
Moutinho, who took a knock at the end of the first half.
 
Michael Aston has some more thoughts on Champions League teams dropping into 
theEuropa League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league>.

“The failing CL teams getting another shot at a CL spot and another trophy is 
ridiculous. just absurd and so unfair. It’s as if Uefa want to ensure their 
money teams get yet another chance to fill the coffers and trophy bank. Has to 
stop.”

Mats Anderson, meanwhile is still banging the drum.

“Unfair? Being unjustly treated? Protest Make a lot of noise. Demand justice. 
I’ll join the demo. Fight the power!”
 
Half-time entertainment: it’s Emmanuel Adebayor dancing. He doesn’t seem to be 
missing football too much. According to some reports, Spurs are still paying 
him £100,000-a-week. Which seems to be working out alright for him.

He’s also just dropped over £300,000 on a new Rolls-Royce …
 
Phew. That Dier injury aside, a near-perfect half for Pochettino.

45 min: One minute added on here. The break can’t come quickly enough for 
Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>. Just put them out of 
their misery, please.
 
42 min: Dier is withdrawn for Bentaleb as a precaution. Sensible move, the 
game feels already won.
 
40 min: Another Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> corner, 
another Tottenham counter-attack. They stream forward in numbers – it’s four on 
two – but both Son and Clinton choose the wrong pass and the move fizzles out.
