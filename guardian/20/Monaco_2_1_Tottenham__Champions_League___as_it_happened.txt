Full-time: Monaco 2-1 Spurs

Spurs are out of the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> and deservedly so. They 
have performed pitifully throughout the tournament, including tonight, when 
only Lloris prevented them from being beaten more severely. This was an 
inexplicably lame display from a team of dubious character. Monaco were great 
and will be a menace to whoever they meet in the next round.

90+3 min: Mendy trips Kane, conceding a freekick at the right-hand corner of 
the box. Eriksen stands over it, primed to create a final chance for Spurs. But 
he fails to beat the first man, Sidibé heading it out for a corner. So we try 
again: Eriksen stands over it, primed to create a final chance for Spurs.

90 min: Janssen takes down a long punt from the back and swivels, abouyt 28 
yards out. Is this his moment? Is this when he makes his belated introduction 
to the hearts of Spurs’ fans? Is this ... oh. A steward sets off to retrieve 
the ball from the stands.

88 min: I’d like to say Spurs are going out with a bong. But given the 
slackness of their performance, it would almost be more appropriate to say 
going out with a bong. But let’s not.

86 min: Eriksen curls a corner to the far post. Alli leaps to high so as to 
get well over the ball and turn a low volley towards goal. But he’s off-balance 
and skews the shot wide from six yards.

84 min: Trippier booked for tripping Bakayoko. An accumulation of frustrations 
from the full-back, who spent most of the evening running helplessly after

73 min: Ouch! Rose catches Sidibé’s knee flush in the face after sliding in to 
block a cross. That would have knocked out many men, but this Rose is made of 
steel, apparently.

71 min: Spurs’ two subs combine: Janssen picks out Eriksen in the box. The 
Dane controls, then makes space for a shot, trying to curl it around into the 
far corner. It takes a nick off Glik and whizzes wide.

67 min: Lemar curls over a freekick from deep on the left. Glik charges in 
from the right and gets his toe to it on the volley, sending the ball goalwards 
at a tremendous clatter. Lloris has nanoseconds to react ... and that’s all he 
needs, as he throws up has hands and tips the ball over the bar! A wonderful 
save that keeps Spurs alive in the game!

Spurs substitution: Janssen and Eriksen on for Son and Dembélé. Son was 
terrible, in fairness. Be nice: don’t say Janssen is a like-for-like 
replacement.

63 min: Silva sets off on a run from midfield, gliding in from the right and 
jinking past a couple of Spurs stragglers before letting fly with a left-footer 
from 20 yards. Lloris gets down to save well.

59 min: Trippier curls in a fine freekick. Alli hurls himself at it but can’t 
connect properly, though he at least puts it backwards into the mixer. Wanyama 
has a swipe from 10 yards and it goes through several bodies before arriving at 
Son, who tries to turn it towards goal from six yards. But the keeper saves. 
And it was offside anyway.

56 min: Wanyama spoons the ball wide to Trippier, who volleys over a decent 
cross. Glik hoof it away but Wanyama gets it back. Falcao slides in to 
dispossess him but it’s a cack-footed tackle. Yellow card, and a freekick in a 
decent crossing position for Spurs.

GOAL! Monaco 2-1 Spurs (Lemar 53)

That is the most Spursy thing ever! 38 seconds after equalising, Spurs concede 
again. Sidibé cantered down the right and floated over a cross that ran all the 
way to Lemar, coming in on the far side. He took a touch and then cracked a low 
shot into the far corner!

GOAL! Monaco 1-0 Spurs (Sidibé 48)

Mendy makes inroads down the left yet again, cuts easily past Winks and 
crosses to the other full-back, Sidibé, who is unattended eight yards from goal 
and plants a perfect header into the net. Woeful defending by Spurs. Sexit 
looms.

47 min: The camera pans to Pochettino, exhaling on the sideline like a man 
trying not to erupt. Spurs still look sluggish.

Pochettino gamble falls flat in Monaco and Spurs crash out after five games

Spurs are out of the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> and deservedly so. They 
have performed pitifully throughout the tournament, including tonight, when 
only Lloris prevented them from being beaten more severely. This was an 
inexplicably lame display from a team of dubious character. Monaco were great 
and will be a menace to whoever they meet in the next round.

90+3 min: Mendy trips Kane, conceding a freekick at the right-hand corner of 
the box. Eriksen stands over it, primed to create a final chance for Spurs. But 
he fails to beat the first man, Sidibé heading it out for a corner. So we try 
again: Eriksen stands over it, primed to create a final chance for Spurs.
 
90+2 min: Two more minutes left for Spurs to turn up.
 
90 min: Janssen takes down a long punt from the back and swivels, abouyt 28 
yards out. Is this his moment? Is this when he makes his belated introduction 
to the hearts of Spurs’ fans? Is this ... oh. A steward sets off to retrieve 
the ball from the stands.
 
88 min: I’d like to say Spurs are going out with a bong. But given the 
slackness of their performance, it would almost be more appropriate to say 
going out with a bong. But let’s not.
 
86 min: Eriksen curls a corner to the far post. Alli leaps to high so as to 
get well over the ball and turn a low volley towards goal. But he’s off-balance 
and skews the shot wide from six yards.

84 min: Trippier booked for tripping Bakayoko. An accumulation of frustrations 
from the full-back, who spent most of the evening running helplessly after 
Mendy.
 
82 min: Mendy rolls his way past Eriksen and Trippier, then wins a corner off 
Dier. All throughout the game Spurs have had no idea how to contain the 
leftback.
 
Monaco substitution: Moutinho on, Lemar off. 
 
79 min: Glik cuts out an attempted pass by Eriksen to Kane. The Pole has been 
in the way so often tonight that Kane should have been issued with a restricted 
view ticket.
 
Spurs substitution: Sissoko on, Winks off
 
Monaco substitution: Carrillo on, Germain off. 
 
76 min: A rubbish corner by Eriksen. 
 
74 min: Lloris to the rescue again, beating away a 15-yard shot by Falcao 
after Dier had gone a-wandering.
 
73 min: Ouch! Rose catches Sidibé’s knee flush in the face after sliding in to 
block a cross. That would have knocked out many men, but this Rose is made of 
steel, apparently.
 
71 min: Spurs’ two subs combine: Janssen picks out Eriksen in the box. The 
Dane controls, then makes space for a shot, trying to curl it around into the 
far corner. It takes a nick off Glik and whizzes wide.
 
70 min: Mendy - yet again totally free on the flank - receives the ball, looks 
up and measures a nice cross. Tottenham scramble clear.
 
67 min: Lemar curls over a freekick from deep on the left. Glik charges in 
from the right and gets his toe to it on the volley, sending the ball goalwards 
at a tremendous clatter. Lloris has nanoseconds to react ... and that’s all he 
needs, as he throws up has hands and tips the ball over the bar! A wonderful 
save that keeps Spurs alive in the game!
 
Spurs substitution: Janssen and Eriksen on for Son and Dembélé. Son was 
terrible, in fairness. Be nice: don’t say Janssen is a like-for-like 
replacement.
 
63 min: Silva sets off on a run from midfield, gliding in from the right and 
jinking past a couple of Spurs stragglers before letting fly with a left-footer 
from 20 yards. Lloris gets down to save well.

61 min: The last five minutes or so have probably been Spurs’ best of the 
match. They’ve got some crispness into their play and started to penMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> back a bit...
 
59 min: Trippier curls in a fine freekick. Alli hurls himself at it but can’t 
connect properly, though he at least puts it backwards into the mixer. Wanyama 
has a swipe from 10 yards and it goes through several bodies before arriving at 
Son, who tries to turn it towards goal from six yards. But the keeper saves. 
And it was offside anyway.
 
56 min: Wanyama spoons the ball wide to Trippier, who volleys over a decent 
cross. Glik hoof it away but Wanyama gets it back. Falcao slides in to 
dispossess him but it’s a cack-footed tackle. Yellow card, and a freekick in a 
decent crossing position for Spurs.
 
That is the most Spursy thing ever! 38 seconds after equalising, Spurs concede 
again. Sidibé cantered down the right and floated over a cross that ran all the 
way to Lemar, coming in on the far side. He took a touch and then cracked a low 
shot into the far corner!

net. Spurs are back in it.

Alli gets his foot on a long pass and is dragged down by Glik.
 
50 min: Rose’s cross is headed behind for a corner. Glik heads Son’s delivery 
away.
 
Mendy makes inroads down the left yet again, cuts easily past Winks and 
crosses to the other full-back, Sidibé, who is unattended eight yards from goal 
and plants a perfect header into the net. Woeful defending by Spurs. Sexit 
looms.
