GOAL! Villa 2-0 Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> (Gana 
90)That’s it! Villa clinch victory with an excellent goal! Gestede received a 
cross from the left before laying it back to Gana, who rifled a shot into the 
net from 15 yards to crown Villa’s second-half improvement and extend their 
unbeaten run. For their reward, they get to host Manchester City in the next 
round.

Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> get an 
opportunity to launch the ball into the box, with five minutes to go, as 
Gardner takes down Reid. Baker leaps well to meet the freekick, but his header 
flies way off target.

GOAL! Yeovil 1-1 Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> 
(Sweeny 71) After an almighty scramble in the box, Sweeney does a pogo jump to 
gain enough height to power a header downward into the net! There follows a 
huge melee.
 Antony Sweeney, he’s in there somewhere, heads Carlisle back on level terms.

GOAL! Bolton 3-2 Eastleigh (Pratley 72) Bolton know all about harsh realities 
and they’re chucking Eastleigh out of dream world at the moment. It’s fantasy 
stuff from Ameobi, though, as his cute pass sets up Pratley for what could 
prove the decisive goal for the Championship side over the non-leaguers.

Villa are well on top now, but they still can’t make the breakthrough against 
Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe>. Gana has just spanked a 
shot wide from 16 yards.

Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> are starting to 
find their mojo against Wycombe. Grealish created a chance for Sinclair, who 
missed the target. One minute later Sinclair seemed to have scored, only for 
his shot to be cleared off the line in spectacular fashion! Then Gestede went 
close, too.

Bolton’s are so skint that they cannot afford to keep Shola Ameobi. The 
striker will leave the club after tonight - and he now has a chance to offer 
them a farewell present, as he has been introduced in place of Madine as Bolton 
try to finally put away Eastleigh.

Bolton still can’t shake off those pesky non-leaguers. They cut through 
Eastleigh just now with a decent move, but Feeney then blasted into the 
sidenetting.

Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> are becoming 
increasingly confident of springing an upset at Villa Park. They’re the more 
fluent team and creating more chances. But you fancy they’ll need take one soon 
if they’re avoid being sickened later. Thompson has just gone close with 
another header after the latest cutting move from the League Two side. Villa, 
meanwhile, are looking chronically short of confidence and quality.

GOAL! Bolton 2-2 Eastleigh (Mohamed 45) Aye, aye, what’s happening here! I 
could give you all the details if TV wonks had chosen to screen this match 
live, but they didn’t, so suffice to say that the non-leaguers have equalised 
before half-time, Kaid Mohamed converting smartly after being sent clear 
through in stoppage time.

As the legion of Baggies watching TV in Illinois can confirm, the Bristol 
City-WBA match has been dire so far. Like watching frost form. Meanwhile, 
non-league Eastleigh are on course for victory over the four-times Cup winners,
Bolton Wanderers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/boltonwanderers>. And 
that’s not on TV anywhere.

90)That’s it! Villa clinch victory with an excellent goal! Gestede received a 
cross from the left before laying it back to Gana, who rifled a shot into the 
net from 15 yards to crown Villa’s second-half improvement and extend their 
unbeaten run. For their reward, they get to host Manchester City in the next 
round.

Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> get an 
opportunity to launch the ball into the box, with five minutes to go, as 
Gardner takes down Reid. Baker leaps well to meet the freekick, but his header 
flies way off target.

huge melee.

GOAL! Villa 1-0 Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> (Clark 
75) Relief at least for Villa! Gil, introduced a moment ago by Garde, clipped a 
sumptuous cross into the area, where Clark was left unchallenged as he planted 
a header into the corner! You can feel the tension flow out of the hosts!

GOAL! Bolton 3-2 Eastleigh (Pratley 72) Bolton know all about harsh realities 
and they’re chucking Eastleigh out of dream world at the moment. It’s fantasy 
stuff from Ameobi, though, as his cute pass sets up Pratley for what could 
prove the decisive goal for the Championship side over the non-leaguers.

Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> are starting to 
find their mojo against Wycombe. Grealish created a chance for Sinclair, who 
missed the target. One minute later Sinclair seemed to have scored, only for 
his shot to be cleared off the line in spectacular fashion! Then Gestede went 
close, too.

Bolton’s are so skint that they cannot afford to keep Shola Ameobi. The 
striker will leave the club after tonight - and he now has a chance to offer 
them a farewell present, as he has been introduced in place of Madine as Bolton 
try to finally put away Eastleigh.
 
Bolton still can’t shake off those pesky non-leaguers. They cut through 
Eastleigh just now with a decent move, but Feeney then blasted into the 
sidenetting.
 
GOAL! Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> 2-1 Ipswich 
(Maitland-Niles 60) The Championship side aren’t out of it yet, thanks to a 
splendid shot from the edge of the box.

Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> are becoming 
increasingly confident of springing an upset at Villa Park. They’re the more 
fluent team and creating more chances. But you fancy they’ll need take one soon 
if they’re avoid being sickened later. Thompson has just gone close with 
another header after the latest cutting move from the League Two side. Villa, 
meanwhile, are looking chronically short of confidence and quality.
 
GOAL! MK Dons 1-0 Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> (Reeves pen 53) Ben Reeves 
smashes the spotkick into the roof of the net after a foul on Bowditch.

GOAL! Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> 0-1 WBA

right perfectly on his chest to leave himself with a calm tap in past the 
keeper from five yards.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity>. Meanwhile in Glasgow, 
Griffiths has put Celtic 7-0 up on Hamilton, with nearly 40 minutes to go. Are 
you watching, Bon Accord?
 
At Villa Park, where last season’s finalists still can’t get ahead of Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe>, Rémi Garde has mad his first 
substitution, replacing Sanchez with Gana.
 
GOAL! Bolton 2-2 Eastleigh (Mohamed 45) Aye, aye, what’s happening here! I 
could give you all the details if TV wonks had chosen to screen this match 
live, but they didn’t, so suffice to say that the non-leaguers have equalised 
before half-time, Kaid Mohamed converting smartly after being sent clear 
through in stoppage time.

well to save from Wellington, but Moxey lashed in the rebound.
 
GOAL! Bolton 1-1 Eastleigh (Madine 39) Shades of David Bone Nightingale Jack 
as Gary Madine chests down a cross from the right and sweeps a low shot into 
the net from 12 yards. Bolton have a shred of dignity back!

GOAL! Reading 1-2 Huddersfield (Piazon) Reading are starting to make 
Huddersfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/huddersfield> pay for Hogg’s 
red card. They’ve pulled a goal back with a lovely freekick from Piazon.

As the legion of Baggies watching TV in Illinois can confirm, the Bristol 
City-WBA match has been dire so far. Like watching frost form. Meanwhile, 
non-league Eastleigh are on course for victory over the four-times Cup winners,
Bolton Wanderers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/boltonwanderers>. And 
that’s not on TV anywhere.
