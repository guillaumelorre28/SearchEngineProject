It doesn’t feel like a brilliant performance, yet perhaps that is just the 
standards Barça set these days. After all they’ve just gone away to the side 
eighth inLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> and 
thumped them 4-0. They extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 36 
games, move 11 points clear of Atlético at the summit, and a sixth league title 
in eight seasons now seems inevitable.

That’s all from me, thanks for reading.

Suárez collects a pass from the substitute Sergi Roberto on the right of the 
box and faces up to two defenders, nutmegging one and shrugging off the other 
before firing a low, angled drive into the far corner. A century of goals now 
between Messi, Neymar and Suárez this season. How ridiculous.

Brilliant solo effort, and that is MSN’s 100th goal of the season. It’s barely

Messi dribbled into the box and sold a couple of dummies before getting to the 
byline and attempting to cross low into the box. Ramis slid to block and it 
struck his arm but he was no more than a yard away from the ball and it seemed 
a little harsh.Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> barely have 
the energy to argue however and Messi steps up, dinking the ball cheekily down 
the middle.

73 mins: Eibar’s challenge is petering out a little here. 

Dac Hewison emails: “What is it about modern football and short corners? Most 
modern teams, especially the quality teams, such and Real Madrid,Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Manchester United all use 
corners. And as you say – generally they are unsuccessful. So why are they used 
so often?”

There is a book called The Numbers Game which claims to statistically prove 
that it is not profitable to cross corners into the box and that they should 
always be taken short (or words to that effect). Perhaps everyone’s read it and 
agrees, but I enjoy a proper swing into the mixer personally.

70 mins: Messi goes on a little weave through the middle and he’s tripped to 
the floor. Chance from the free-kick, 30 yards out... but his effort is easy 
enough for Riesgo to get behind and catch at chest height.

67 mins: Berjon replaces top-scorer Baston in Eibar’s attack.

Mark Turner emails with some love for Eibar: “...compact, well-drilled, tells 
of smart use of the training ground and a good manager. The only ‘error’ was to 
push for an equalizer and get mown down for leaving the gaps, but getting 
beaten by an on-form Messi applies to the world’s biggest teams, not just La

I tend to agree. They are eighth in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> and are competing with 
Barça better than most – and not for the first time this season.

65 mins: Barcelona play the ball out from the back with supreme control but 
Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> win it back and break. 
Enrich stretches the defence before turning and setting up Adrian for a blast 
from the edge of the box but it sails another full goal’s height over the bar.

61 mins: It’s difficult to make this performance sound more exciting than it 
is.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have worked hard 
and had lots of control of the ball but have had to rely almost entirely on 
Messi to create anything in the final third – Neymar and Iniesta are missed 
creatively.

58 mins: Radosevic’s latest clattering is dished out to fellow countryman 
Rakitic. Still no second yellow card but just by virtue of accumulation he is 
walking the disciplinary tightrope.

56 mins: Corner to Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, 
which is delayed while Rakitic moves a selection of bags and drinks bottles and 
other sideline items, Sunday-League style. The corner is played short and like 
all short corners throughout the history of time, it’s unsuccessful.

51 mins: Alves and Rakitic work a nice one-two down the right but the latter’s 
cross is weak and easily intercepted.

Charles Antaki also gets in touch with Spanish insight: “I’ve just clocked 
that Eibar’s keeper is called Riesgo - which is ‘risk’ in Spanish. Jokes are 
superfluous, of course, since Bravo at the other end could be rendered as 
‘wild’.”

49 mins: It’s a scrappy start to the half, a few fouls in succession breaking 
the game up. Eventually Barça get hold of the ball but Munir’s pass to Alba on 
the overlap is poor and the move breaks down.

47 mins: Radosevic, on a yellow card, bundles over Rakitic in midfield a 
little clumsily but gets away with only a foul. No changes at the break for 
either side, by the way.

“Ray Hudson is on good form,” emails Charles Antaki. “On the precision of the 
pass to Suárez that led to the goal: ‘Messi gets a pint measure into a shot

44 mins: Jordi Alba pokes a little pass for Rakitic arriving in the six-yard 
box who can’t quite add the toe the ball needed to add a third.

Barça go on the counterattack and Munir slips the ball to Messi 40 yards out 
facing three defenders. The little master comes forward as they gulp and 
retreat, and the rest is classic Messi, shuffling quickly to the left before 
firing a low shot into the bottom-right from 12 yards.

GOAL! Eibar 0-2 Barcelona (Messi, 41 mins)

And when a team has the temerity to attack Barça, Messi tends to punish them.

40 mins: Brilliant from Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> who 
are really going at Barça right now. They win the ball high up the pitch and a 
couple of quick passes open up the champions’ defence until Busquets slides 
across to deflect the shot wide.

38 mins: Dani Garcia delivers another dangerous ball to the back post, where 
Ramis is lurking. He’s a good few inches higher than Alves and Rakitic around 
him and has the time to angle a headed pass across the six-yard box – but no 
one is there to convert.

35 mins: At the other end a deep, dipping cross from the left finds Escalante 
arriving to volley across goal and just past the far post with Bravo totally 
planted. Difficult technique, admittedly, but he probably should have hit the 
target and the crowd seem to have let him know just that.

33 mins: Another lovely pass by Mr Messi and Munir misses a bit of a sitter 
one-on-one when he could have handed Suárez an open goal with a square pass, 
returning the favour for the first goal. Luis is not too happy.

31 mins: The relentless workrate of both these sides high in their opponent’s 
third is keeping the tempo high, but also denying much goalmouth action. Barça 
are 1-0 up and look in good control of this one, without displaying their 
magical best so far.

26 mins: Eibar are starting to put together a little bit of pressure, Bravo 
punching away the initial cross and Capa’s follow-up a little overhit. In the 
centre Escalante wanted a penalty for a tug by Alves but it would have been 
very soft.

24 mins: Messi is dropping deep and dictating with some very inventive passing 
– perhaps it’s a glimpse ten years into the future. The latest chip forward 
tries to find Munir but the winger is offside.

21 mins: The ball drops out of sky invitingly for Junca but the Eibar 
left-back makes a bit of a hash of an ambitious right-foot volley.Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> continue to hunt for the ball deep 
in Barça territory and seem to have pinned Mascherano into a corner until his 
chip to Rakitic is wonderfully controlled and the visitors escape again.

15 mins: Eibar again try to press high but Barça pick off the pressure 
masterfully and work the ball wide for Messi. He bends a delicious ball for 
Turan sprinting into the box but the midfielder’s crafty backheel can’t quite 
pick out Suárez.

13 mins: It could so easily be level – Radosevic battles down the right and 
bends in a dangerous cross but Ramis can only head over from eight yards.

11 mins: Jordi Albi runs a low one through the cavernous gap between 
right-back and centre-half for Suárez to chase but, under some pressure, the 
forward fires over the bar from 20 yards.

9 mins: Replays show Luis Suárez was right on the line of the last defender 
when he made his dart towards the byline, but I make him just about level.

With his first touches Messi sniffs out a lovely high throughball down the 
right for Suárez in behind, who takes a touch before squaring to Munir to tap 
in at the back post. It was all made to look very, very easy.

4 mins: Radosevic slides to block Munir’s cross down the left but gets done by 
some quick feet and inadvertently handles the ball on the floor. He gets a 
yellow card which seems a little harsh, but Barça can’t make anything of the 
set piece.

2 mins: Barça quickly settle on the ball but Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> have started with a very high 
press and the visitors are being forced back into their own half, meaning no 
sniff of the ball at the sharp end just yet.

Kick-off

Peeeeep! And Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> get 
things going, decked out in deckchair-style yellow with orange stripes. Still 
awful. Will always be awful.

Last time out

Back in October, La Liga’s smallest club by most metrics stunned the Camp Nou 
through Borja Bastón’s eighth minute goal and led for nearly 20 minutes until 
Luis Suárez kicked into gear – his hat-trick eventually settled matters.

Preamble

Should there one day be a Spanish equivalent of the documentary Keane and 
Vieira: the best of enemies featuring Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, it 
would make pretty compelling watching. In case you missed it, the original 
programme paired the former Manchester United and Arsenal captains in a cosy 
underground bunker setting where they retold old stories and picked a combined 
best XI of former team-mates, all of which was given a special edge by the 
murky passive-aggression in Roy Keane’s eyes.

The point of all this is that Messi’s current Barça band have just set a new 
Spanish record for games unbeaten in all competitions (35), and they are the 
current Spanish, European and world champions. So are they the best Messi-era
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> team yet?

Perhaps one day, in an underground bunker alongside a 45-year-old overly 
competitive Cristiano, we will find out whether Leo prefers Ronaldinho or 
Neymar, Suárez or Villa. Feel free to send me your opinion, but for now we will 
have to make do with watching Barcelona’s Messi Mark III (ish) team, one of the 
greatest creations in modern European football who have already racked up 121 
goals this season – and are probably about to score a few more.

Kick-off: 1500 GMT

close  
It doesn’t feel like a brilliant performance, yet perhaps that is just the 
standards Barça set these days. After all they’ve just gone away to the side 
eighth inLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> and 
thumped them 4-0. They extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 36 
games, move 11 points clear of Atlético at the summit, and a sixth league title 
in eight seasons now seems inevitable.

That’s all from me, thanks for reading.

100 - Messi, Neymar and Suárez have scored 100 goals combined in all 
competitions this season forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. MSN.
 <https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/706521812147048449> March 6, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/706521812147048449>  
Sergi Roberto finishes the game with a flashed shot into Riesgo’s midriff and 
beforeEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> can respond the 
whistle blows.
 
90 mins: Japanese striker Takashi Inui comes off the bench and immediately 
feeds Capa on the overlap, but Barcelona’s defending is committed as ever and 
they eventually force a goal-kick.
 
88 mins: Alba lofts a teasing cross into the box but Riesgo plucks the balls 
out of the air with Messi and Suárez lurking.
 
Suárez collects a pass from the substitute Sergi Roberto on the right of the 
box and faces up to two defenders, nutmegging one and shrugging off the other 
before firing a low, angled drive into the far corner. A century of goals now 
between Messi, Neymar and Suárez this season. How ridiculous.
 
Brilliant solo effort, and that is MSN’s 100th goal of the season. It’s barely 
March.
 
83 mins: Suárez misses a golden chance to add his name to the scoreboard, 
flicking a free header into Riesgo’s gloves when Messi’s delivery was there to 
be buried.
 
81 mins: Luis Enrique rings the changes with Pique, Turan and Busquets coming 
off, and Sergi Roberto, Bartra and Vermaelen coming on.
 
79 mins: Pantic whips another dangerous cross in from the left but with Baston 
off the field there’s no target man to finish the chance.
 
Messi dribbled into the box and sold a couple of dummies before getting to the 
byline and attempting to cross low into the box. Ramis slid to block and it 
struck his arm but he was no more than a yard away from the ball and it seemed 
a little harsh.Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> barely have 
the energy to argue however and Messi steps up, dinking the ball cheekily down 
the middle.
 
And that little chip down the middle should finish this one off.
 
Penalty to Barcelona!
 
73 mins: Eibar’s challenge is petering out a little here. 

Dac Hewison emails: “What is it about modern football and short corners? Most 
modern teams, especially the quality teams, such and Real Madrid,Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Manchester United all use 
corners. And as you say – generally they are unsuccessful. So why are they used 
so often?”

There is a book called The Numbers Game which claims to statistically prove 
that it is not profitable to cross corners into the box and that they should 
always be taken short (or words to that effect). Perhaps everyone’s read it and 
agrees, but I enjoy a proper swing into the mixer personally.
 
70 mins: Messi goes on a little weave through the middle and he’s tripped to 
the floor. Chance from the free-kick, 30 yards out... but his effort is easy 
enough for Riesgo to get behind and catch at chest height.
 
67 mins: Berjon replaces top-scorer Baston in Eibar’s attack.

Mark Turner emails with some love for Eibar: “...compact, well-drilled, tells 
of smart use of the training ground and a good manager. The only ‘error’ was to 
push for an equalizer and get mown down for leaving the gaps, but getting 
beaten by an on-form Messi applies to the world’s biggest teams, not just La 
Liga’s smallest. More power toEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>
.”

I tend to agree. They are eighth in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> and are competing with 
Barça better than most – and not for the first time this season.
 
65 mins: Barcelona play the ball out from the back with supreme control but 
Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> win it back and break. 
Enrich stretches the defence before turning and setting up Adrian for a blast 
from the edge of the box but it sails another full goal’s height over the bar.
 
63 mins: Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> work well down the 
right until Capa’s misplaced pass goes straight off the pitch for a Barça throw.
 
61 mins: It’s difficult to make this performance sound more exciting than it 
is.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have worked hard 
and had lots of control of the ball but have had to rely almost entirely on 
Messi to create anything in the final third – Neymar and Iniesta are missed 
creatively.
 
58 mins: Radosevic’s latest clattering is dished out to fellow countryman 
Rakitic. Still no second yellow card but just by virtue of accumulation he is 
walking the disciplinary tightrope.
 
56 mins: Corner to Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, 
which is delayed while Rakitic moves a selection of bags and drinks bottles and 
other sideline items, Sunday-League style. The corner is played short and like 
all short corners throughout the history of time, it’s unsuccessful.
 
54 mins: Messi should be through on goal but instead takes a life-affirmingly 
poor first touch andEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> escape.

If this series of lines, dots and arrows doesn’t bring Barça’s opener to life 
for you, nothing will.

<https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona/status/706509736997421057>  
51 mins: Alves and Rakitic work a nice one-two down the right but the latter’s 
cross is weak and easily intercepted.

Charles Antaki also gets in touch with Spanish insight: “I’ve just clocked 
that Eibar’s keeper is called Riesgo - which is ‘risk’ in Spanish. Jokes are 
superfluous, of course, since Bravo at the other end could be rendered as 
‘wild’.”
 
49 mins: It’s a scrappy start to the half, a few fouls in succession breaking 
the game up. Eventually Barça get hold of the ball but Munir’s pass to Alba on 
the overlap is poor and the move breaks down.
 
47 mins: Radosevic, on a yellow card, bundles over Rakitic in midfield a 
little clumsily but gets away with only a foul. No changes at the break for 
either side, by the way.
 
Kick-off

Peeeeeep! We are back in business.

Half-time correspondence 

“Ray Hudson is on good form,” emails Charles Antaki. “On the precision of the 
pass to Suárez that led to the goal: ‘Messi gets a pint measure into a shot 
glass two villages away from here.’ Why don’t 5-live snap him up?”

Ray Hudson, for anyone who doesn’t know, is a revered British commentator who 
has a spectacular way with words that this blog can only aspire to achieve:
 
Munir’s tap-in and Messi’s dribble and finish hand the league leaders the 
advantage at the break.
 
44 mins: Jordi Alba pokes a little pass for Rakitic arriving in the six-yard 
box who can’t quite add the toe the ball needed to add a third.
 
Barça go on the counterattack and Munir slips the ball to Messi 40 yards out 
facing three defenders. The little master comes forward as they gulp and 
retreat, and the rest is classic Messi, shuffling quickly to the left before 
firing a low shot into the bottom-right from 12 yards.
 
And when a team has the temerity to attack Barça, Messi tends to punish them. 
 
40 mins: Brilliant from Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> who 
are really going at Barça right now. They win the ball high up the pitch and a 
couple of quick passes open up the champions’ defence until Busquets slides 
across to deflect the shot wide.
 
38 mins: Dani Garcia delivers another dangerous ball to the back post, where 
Ramis is lurking. He’s a good few inches higher than Alves and Rakitic around 
him and has the time to angle a headed pass across the six-yard box – but no 
one is there to convert.
 
35 mins: At the other end a deep, dipping cross from the left finds Escalante 
arriving to volley across goal and just past the far post with Bravo totally 
planted. Difficult technique, admittedly, but he probably should have hit the 
target and the crowd seem to have let him know just that.
 
33 mins: Another lovely pass by Mr Messi and Munir misses a bit of a sitter 
one-on-one when he could have handed Suárez an open goal with a square pass, 
returning the favour for the first goal. Luis is not too happy.
 
31 mins: The relentless workrate of both these sides high in their opponent’s 
third is keeping the tempo high, but also denying much goalmouth action. Barça 
are 1-0 up and look in good control of this one, without displaying their 
magical best so far.
 
28 mins: Rakitic swings in a corner but it’s punched a long way clear by 
Riesgo. John McEnerney isn’t holding out much hope for plucky Eibar:
John McEnerney (@MackerOnTheMed) 
@LawrenceOstlere <https://twitter.com/LawrenceOstlere> Eibar who've punched

<https://twitter.com/MackerOnTheMed/status/706500996386693120>  
26 mins: Eibar are starting to put together a little bit of pressure, Bravo 
punching away the initial cross and Capa’s follow-up a little overhit. In the 
centre Escalante wanted a penalty for a tug by Alves but it would have been 
very soft.
 
24 mins: Messi is dropping deep and dictating with some very inventive passing 
– perhaps it’s a glimpse ten years into the future. The latest chip forward 
tries to find Munir but the winger is offside.
 
21 mins: The ball drops out of sky invitingly for Junca but the Eibar 
left-back makes a bit of a hash of an ambitious right-foot volley.Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> continue to hunt for the ball deep 
in Barça territory and seem to have pinned Mascherano into a corner until his 
chip to Rakitic is wonderfully controlled and the visitors escape again.
 
19 mins: Messi tries to thread Munir in on goal but his pass is just a little 
overhit and it runs through safely for Riesgo.
 
17 mins: Pass, pass, pass, pass – Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> are struggling to get a touch 
right now.
 
15 mins: Eibar again try to press high but Barça pick off the pressure 
masterfully and work the ball wide for Messi. He bends a delicious ball for 
Turan sprinting into the box but the midfielder’s crafty backheel can’t quite 
pick out Suárez.
 
13 mins: It could so easily be level – Radosevic battles down the right and 
bends in a dangerous cross but Ramis can only head over from eight yards.
 
11 mins: Jordi Albi runs a low one through the cavernous gap between 
right-back and centre-half for Suárez to chase but, under some pressure, the 
forward fires over the bar from 20 yards.
 
9 mins: Replays show Luis Suárez was right on the line of the last defender 
when he made his dart towards the byline, but I make him just about level.
 
With his first touches Messi sniffs out a lovely high throughball down the 
right for Suárez in behind, who takes a touch before squaring to Munir to tap 
in at the back post. It was all made to look very, very easy.

Messi and Suárez combine and the deadlock is broken.
 
4 mins: Radosevic slides to block Munir’s cross down the left but gets done by 
some quick feet and inadvertently handles the ball on the floor. He gets a 
yellow card which seems a little harsh, but Barça can’t make anything of the 
set piece.
 
2 mins: Barça quickly settle on the ball but Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> have started with a very high 
press and the visitors are being forced back into their own half, meaning no 
sniff of the ball at the sharp end just yet.
 
Kick-off

Peeeeep! And Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> get 
things going, decked out in deckchair-style yellow with orange stripes. Still 
awful. Will always be awful.
 
The players are out and hands are being shaken in the middle of Eibar’s tiny 
Ipurua Stadium (capacity 6,300). Kick-off imminent.
 
Last time out

Back in October, La Liga’s smallest club by most metrics stunned the Camp Nou 
through Borja Bastón’s eighth minute goal and led for nearly 20 minutes until 
Luis Suárez kicked into gear – his hat-trick eventually settled matters.

Preamble

Should there one day be a Spanish equivalent of the documentary Keane and 
Vieira: the best of enemies featuring Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, it 
would make pretty compelling watching. In case you missed it, the original 
programme paired the former Manchester United and Arsenal captains in a cosy 
underground bunker setting where they retold old stories and picked a combined 
best XI of former team-mates, all of which was given a special edge by the 
murky passive-aggression in Roy Keane’s eyes.

The point of all this is that Messi’s current Barça band have just set a new 
Spanish record for games unbeaten in all competitions (35), and they are the 
current Spanish, European and world champions. So are they the best Messi-era
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> team yet?

Perhaps one day, in an underground bunker alongside a 45-year-old overly 
competitive Cristiano, we will find out whether Leo prefers Ronaldinho or 
Neymar, Suárez or Villa. Feel free to send me your opinion, but for now we will 
have to make do with watching Barcelona’s Messi Mark III (ish) team, one of the 
greatest creations in modern European football who have already racked up 121 
goals this season – and are probably about to score a few more.

Kick-off: 1500 GMT
 Keane and Vieira: the best of enemies
