If you’re gearing up for the weekend’s tennis-boxing-racing-football 
quadrathlon, you’re going to need a frozen treat to cool you down when things 
heat up. And if you’re planning an escape to a delightfully empty park, you’re 
also going to need an ice-cream, too – if only to keep you company. Whichever 
you choose, it’s a win-win.

Strawberry sorbet and vanilla ice-cream lollies

Shop-bought ice-cream is a great timesaver here; if you have the time, by all 
means make your own. If you are starting with firm ice-cream, let it sit at 
room temperature until it’s soft enough to spoon into the moulds. The sorbet is 
set by whisking it as it sits in the freezer. If you have an ice-cream machine 
and want to use that instead, churn the sorbet just until soft waves form. 
Makes six lollies.

260g hulled strawberries
40g liquid glucose
50g caster sugar
2½ tbsp lime juice
About 120g vanilla ice-cream 

Put the strawberries in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth. 
Put the glucose, sugar and lime juice in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. 
Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then add the strawberry puree. Bring to a 
boil, cook for a minute, then take off the heat and set aside to cool.

Once cool, pour into an air-tight container and freeze for three to four 
hours, whisking it every 30 minutes, until almost set.

Spoon 20-25g sorbet into each ice-lolly holder, and tap the base against a 
work surface to disperse any air bubbles. Spoon 15-20g ice-cream on top of the 
sorbet, compressing it as you do. Finish with a second layer of sorbet, until 
almost full to the top, tap again and put a lolly stick in each one. Set in the 
freezer for at least five hours before serving.

 Yotam Ottolenghi’s (no-churn) raspberry ice-cream 
This has the clean, fresh flavour of sorbet, but the rich, smooth depth of 
ice-cream. It’s delicious with the puree suggested, but it’s also mighty fine 
with some white chocolate sauce, roast peaches or even just whipped cream; it’s 
also worth trying it with a few mixed berries macerated in sugar syrup, 
vanilla, orange skin and bay leaves. Makes eight portions.

700g fresh raspberries (or frozen ones, defrosted) 
20g icing sugar
200ml double cream
2 egg yolks
1 egg
180g caster sugar
1 tsp lemon juice
Salt

Put the raspberries in a food processor, blitz to a puree, then pass through a 
large sieve (set over a bowl) to remove the seeds. Use a spatula to help push 
through as much puree as possible: you should end up with about 450ml.

Pour 150ml of the puree into a small bowl and mix with the icing sugar, until 
combined. Put the remaining 300ml of puree into a second bowl, and refrigerate 
both until needed.

Pour the cream into a medium bowl, whisk to soft peaks and put in the fridge.

Fill a small saucepan with enough water to come 2cm up the sides, bring to a 
boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low, so the water simmers gently. Put 
the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of 
salt in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whisk 
briefly, just to combine, then place the bowl on top of the pan of simmering 
water, making sure the base does not touch the water.

Whisk continuously by hand for five to six minutes, until the sugar has 
dissolved and the mixture is warm. Return the bowl to the mixer and whisk on a 
medium-high speed for five minutes, until thick and cool. Turn down the speed 
to low and slowly incorporate the 300ml bowl of raspberry puree. Fold in the 
whipped cream, then spoon the mixture into a large freezer container and freeze 
for at least 12 hours.

Ten minutes before serving, remove the ice-cream from the freezer, so it 
softens slightly. Scoop into eight bowls and serve with the remaining 150ml 
sweetened raspberry puree poured on top.

 Yotam Ottolenghi’s saffron ice-cream sandwiches 
Don’t be put off by the stages involved in making these: it may look like a 
lot of work, but the joy of an ice-cream machine (which is a must here, I’m 
afraid) is that a lot of that work is done for you. Dutch process cocoa has a 
smoother, more mellow flavour than natural cocoa; it’s widely available, so 
just check the label – Green & Black’s cocoa powder is just one brand that’s 
“Dutched”. Also, the biscuits and nuts can be made in advance, if that helps 
with getting organised. If you don’t fancy making biscuits, the ice-cream is 
mighty fine on its own. Makes 12 sandwiches.

120g whole almonds, skin on
200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
55g cocoa powder (Dutch process)
½ tsp baking powder
Salt
100g unsalted butter 
160g soft light brown sugar
½ tsp vanilla extract
60ml whole milk

For the ice-cream
4 egg yolks
100g caster sugar
320ml whole milk
300g double cream
½ vanilla pod, slit open and seeds scraped out
¼ tsp saffron threads

Heat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2½. Spread out the almonds on an oven 
tray, bake for eight minutes, then set aside to cool and roughly blitz in a 
food processor. Set aside until serving (if making ahead, store in an airtight 
container).

Turn up the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sift together the flour, cocoa, 
baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt.

Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a food mixer with the paddle 
attachment in place. Beat on a high speed for about three minutes, until pale, 
then add the vanilla and mix to incorporate. Turn the speed to low, add a third 
of the flour mix, and mix to incorporate. Add half the milk, mix to combine, 
then repeat with first another third of the flour mix, then the remaining milk 
and finally the rest of the flour. Mix until just combined: the dough will be 
soft, but not sticky.

Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured work surface and knead until smooth. 
Divide in two and set half to one side. Roll the remaining piece of dough to 
3mm thick, then cut out discs with an 8cm round cookie cutter. Arrange these 
inside a plastic container, keeping them apart from each other with baking 
parchment, otherwise they’ll stick. Repeat with the remaining dough. Re-roll 
any offcuts, so that you can make 24 biscuits in total, then freeze the discs 
for at least 15 minutes.

To bake, arrange the discs on two oven trays lined with greaseproof paper, and 
bake for six minutes, until firm on the outside but still a little soft in the 
centre. Remove the tray from the oven and set aside for five minutes, then 
transfer the biscuits to a rack to cool completely. Transfer the biscuits to an 
airtight container freeze until ready to use.

For the ice-cream, put the egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk to 
combine. Put the milk, cream, vanilla (seeds and pod) and saffron in a medium 
saucepan on a medium heat. Warm through for three to four minutes, until little 
bubbles start forming on the surface, then slowly pour half the hot milk into 
the eg yolk mixture, whisking constantly, until smooth. Pour the contents of 
the bowl into the saucepan with the remaining milk, return to a medium-low heat 
and cook for eight to 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture 
thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove from the heat, discard 
the vanilla pod, transfer the mix to a bowl and set aside to cool. Once cool, 
churn in an ice-cream machine until soft waves appear.

Keep the ice-cream churning (to prevent it melting), then take two frozen 
biscuits at a time and spoon about 50g ice-cream on one biscuit and place the 
other biscuit on top, smooth side up. Gently squeeze together the biscuits, 
just so the ice-cream comes out to the edges of the biscuits, then run the tip 
of a teaspoon between the two biscuits, to smooth off and remove any excess 
ice-cream. Give the biscuits one final squeeze, so the ice-cream sits evenly 
inside them, then transfer to a container and freeze. Repeat with the remaining 
biscuits and ice-cream. Let the filled sandwiches freeze for at least six hours 
before serving (and for up to a month).

Just before serving, remove the sandwiches from the freezer, so the edges of 
the ice-cream soften a little. Spread out the blitzed almonds on a flat plate, 
roll the exposed ice-cream in the nuts and serve.

 Yotam Ottolenghi’s rose and pistachio semifreddo with chocolate sauce 
You’ll need a sugar thermometer for this, because the temperature of the sugar 
syrup is crucial for a soft and creamy consistency. They cost about a fiver 
(which I rationalise by viewing it as about the same, or cheaper, than two 
half-litre tubs of good-quality shop-bought ice-cream). You don’t have to make 
the chocolate sauce, but it does go fantastically well with the semi-freddo. 
Serves eight.

Oil, to grease
5 cardamom pods
240g double cream 
1½ tsp good-quality Lebanese rose water (such as Cortas 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Cortas+rose+water&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=L-5nV9GNEMeGgAaBubjYDw>
; if you can’t get that, use just ½ tsp of a supermarket own-brand)
50g shelled pistachio kernels, finely blitzed, plus another 30g, roughly 
chopped, to garnish
2 egg whites (65g) 
40g runny honey 
40g caster sugar 
30g liquid glucose 
Salt

For the chocolate sauce
85g dark cooking chocolate (70% cocoa solids), finely chopped
120g double cream

Brush the inside of a 24cm x 11cm loaf tin with oil and line the base and 
sides with baking paper, leaving an overhang of about 2cm.

Crush the cardamom pods with the flat of a large knife, remove the little 
black seeds, then crush them using a pestle and mortar; discard the husks.

Pour the cream into a bowl, whisk for about two minutes, until soft peaks 
form, then fold in the cardamom seeds, rosewater and blitzed pistachios. 
Transfer to a medium bowl and refrigerate.

Put the egg whites and a small pinch of salt in the clean bowl of an electric 
mixer with the whisk attachment in place.

Put the honey, sugar and glucose in a small saucepan, put on a medium-low heat 
and stir until the sugar has melted. Increase the heat to medium, bring to a 
boil and leave to bubble for about two minutes, resisting the urge to stir, 
until the sugar thermometer registers 110C. Immediately begin whisking the egg 
whites on a high speed until soft peaks form. When the syrup reaches 116C, 
remove from the heat and turn down the mixer speed to medium. With the machine 
running, slowly and continuously pour the syrup into the egg whites, whisking 
all the time, until it is all is incorporated, then continue to whip for eight 
minutes more, until the mix is cool.

Fold in the whipped cream until completely mixed through, then pour the 
mixture into the prepared tin and smooth down the top. Gently tap the tin on 
the bench, to disperse any air bubbles, then fold over the greaseproof paper 
overhang, so the semifreddo mix is completely enclosed. Wrap tightly in 
cling-film and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight.

Five to 10 minutes before serving, remove the semifreddo from the freezer and 
start on the sauce. Put the chocolate in a small bowl. Warm the cream in a 
small saucepan over a medium heat, until just starting to simmer, then take off 
the heat and pour over the chocolate. Stir gently until all the chocolate has 
melted.

Dip a large metal serving spoon in a bowl of boiling water and use it to scoop 
out the semifreddo. Drizzle chocolate sauce over each portion, sprinkle the 
chopped pistachios on top and serve at once.
