“Asked … whether he thought there should be a gay history month along 
the lines of black history month, Corbyn said: ‘There could be that…’ ” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/jeremy-corbyn-labour-would-add-lgbt-history-to-school-curriculum>
, theguardian.com, 27 October). Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans History Month has 
existed in the UK since 2005 and has a major impact on schools throughout the 
country. We still celebrate it every February. I should know because I am the 
CEO of the charity that runs it.

• I am grateful to Mr Fox for explaining that the EU is putting politics over 
prosperity (Fox warns on tariffs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/eus-tough-post-brexit-stance-puts-politics-over-prosperity-says-liam-fox>
, 27 October) as I was assuming that they were putting principles over profit.

• Surely, with the active use of stents and microchip implants, the medical 
profession can invent some non-invasive valve procedure that can switch on and 
off the effect of a vasectomy (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/26/we-need-to-talk-about-vasectomy-drawbacks>
, 27 October)? I freely offer this idea to the world as long as it is for ever 
known as a stop-cock.

• With Bake Off the nation’s favourite programme, and 10 million watching 
the final episode (Royal picnic wins Bake Off crown for teacher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/great-british-bake-off-final-bbc-channel-4-mary-berry-paul-hollywood>
, 27 October), is it just a coincidence that, in the same week, Public Health 
England issue dire warnings about a major increase in Type 2 diabetes?

• Bob Dylan did not “change rock from teenage to adult music” (Notes & queries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/19/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-singers>, 
27 October). His fans simply got older.

• You picture Christ’s tomb (Jesus Christ’s tomb uncovered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/jesus-tomb-jerusalem-restoration-church-of-the-holy-sepulchre-christ-christianity>
, Eyewitness, 28 October). No mention of any bones. That would be an atheist’s 
dream, surely!
