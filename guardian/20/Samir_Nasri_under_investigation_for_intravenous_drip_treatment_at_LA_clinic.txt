According to the Drip Doctors clinic, Nasri received its “Immunity IV Drip”, 
which involves one litre of hydration and is designed to “combat superbugs and 
common viruses”.

However World Anti-Doping Agency rules state that there is a 50 millilitre 
limit for active athletes.

Gómez Bastida said in an interview on the Spanish radio network Cadena SER: 
“It is necessary to know in what frame and in what situations it [the IV drip] 
occurred. We will verify the facts to know where we are. You have to be careful 
with the rumours.

“In the Nasri case there is no sanctioning procedure at the moment, so there 
could be no interim injunction.”

Wada’s prohibited list includes: “Intravenous infusions and/or injections of 
more than 50ml per six-hour period except for those legitimately received in 
the course of hospital admissions, surgical procedures or clinical 
investigations.”

Nasri is due to return to Spain this week after spending part of La Liga’s 
winter break in the United States.

Drip Doctors refused to comment when contacted by Press Association Sport and 
Manchester City referred enquires on the situation regarding their player to
Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla>.

A spokesman for the Spanish club said Sevilla had no information beyond what 
had been reported in the media.

News of Nasri’s treatment emerged on Tuesday evening. Drip Doctors posted a 
message and photograph of Nasri alongside the organisation’s co-founder Jamila 
Sozahdah on the Twitter feed DripDoctors, which read: “We provided SamNasri19 a 
concierge Immunity IV Drip to keep him hydrated & in top health during his busy 
soccer season with SevillaFC.”

Nasri’s official account subsequently quoted the DripDoctors Twitter posts, 
which were then followed by a series of bizarre and sexually explicit messages.

The string of posts was later deleted, and Nasri stated: “My account got 
hacked sorry about what happen earlier.”

Wada and the Spanish authorities had been alerted to the claim about the 
clinic visit by a Twitter post from Richard Ings, the former head of 
anti-doping at the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), who also worked 
as chair and chief executive of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency.

He quoted the post from DripDoctors, adding on his Twitter account ringsau: 
“Which should be of great interest to wada-ama and AEPSAD IV50mlbanned”.
