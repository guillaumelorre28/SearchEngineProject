Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> side Nice’s 
troubled season took a turn for the worse on Thursday when their coach Claude 
Puel and some of his players were attacked by a group of up to 70 supporters at 
their training base.

After a 5-0 defeat to Saint-Etienne on Sunday left the club in 15th position 
in the table, members of supporters’ group La Populaire Sud turned up at the 
Charles-Ehrmann training base to vent their frustrations.

According to organisers, the protest was meant in “joy and good humour” but 
the scene quickly descended into turmoil as some fans threw firecrackers and 
homemade smoke bombs as the players attempted to train.

 Nice training 
Following a similar attack earlier in the season, Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> officials had arranged for police 
high-ranking stewards to be present but that did not stop fans pushing and 
shoving Puel and his assistant Guy Mengual as they attempted to reach the 
changing room.

The former Middlesbrough midfielder and Nice captain Didier Digard was also 
targeted, while young goalkeeper Mouez Hassen needed protection to reach his 
car.

“I think that we are operating in a particular environment,” Puel said 
afterwards. “But what interests me is to stay focused on our next two 
deadlines. We will tackle it. Is it suitable for football? It’s something else.”

Nice face Lens on Saturday, knowing victory would secure their top-flight 
status for another season.
