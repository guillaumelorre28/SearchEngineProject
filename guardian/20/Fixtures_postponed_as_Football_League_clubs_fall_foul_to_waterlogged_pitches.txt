The first casualties of the Christmas weather have fallen with matches 
postponed due to waterlogged pitches in theChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>, League One and League Two.

Blackburn's game at home to Brighton was called off after a pitch inspection 
around midday deemed it too dangerous for play. The decision may come as a 
welcome one to Henning Berg, who is yet to secure a win at home since becoming 
the Rovers manager in October.

With Tranmere given a 5-0 thrashing at Swindon on Friday night, second-placed 
Brentford had hoped to leapfrog them into League One's top spot, only to see 
their game at home to Stevenage called off. Bottom-placedHartlepool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hartlepool> had been scheduled to host 
Portsmouth, who also sit in League One's relegation zone, but were unable to 
clear a waterlogged pitch in time for Saturday's 3pm kick-off.

Only two grounds in League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> are fit for purpose, 
with Accrington v Plymouth and Northampton v Aldershot the only fixtures 
holding up.

Bradford's match at Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> was 
one of the first to be cancelled and they will be hoping that any re-scheduled 
game will not further congest an already busy January â€“ the Yorkshire club play 
seven games in the space of three weeks, including a two-legged League Cup 
semi-final against Aston Villa.

Only one game looks set to be played in the Conference, with Kidderminster v 
Dartford the only game to withstand the rain. All of the below fixtures have 
yet to be re-arranged.
