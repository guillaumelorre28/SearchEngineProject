.

The Spaniard Merhi, 23, has won at Formula Renault 3.5 level and has driven at 
F1 level in three practice sessions.

He said: “Today, finally, I can announce something that I have dreamed of many 
times – not just free practice but a full grand prix. It’s time to thank many 
people who spent years helping me learn, and of course theManor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manor> team – old friends who have trusted 
me to start this new phase, which I hope will bring them success.

“We will not have the means to fight the other teams on equal terms, using a 
2014 car and power unit

, but we will give our best.”

It was also announced by the Manor team that the son of their investor Justin 
King, Jordan, had become the team’s development driver.

Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso’s manager, Flavio Briatore, has described the 
driver’s crash in testing as “very strange”. Briatore also told Italian 
television that the McLaren driver’s concussion was his only injury from the 
accident.

“He crashes without any reason,” he added. “We have to see if there was a 
steering problem. All the examinations and tests made on the driver were 
negative.” Alonso was detained in hospital for three days and willmiss the 
Australian Grand Prix
