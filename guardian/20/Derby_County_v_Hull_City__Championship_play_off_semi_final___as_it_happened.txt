So that's that, then ...

Derby started reasonably well and were certainly dominating when Abel 
Hernandez scored forHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> 
against the run of play. With half-time approaching and Derby on the ropes, 
Hull were rather fortuitous to go two up to a freakish own goal, the ball 
taking two deflections on its way past the helpless Scott Carson. At the scrag 
end of an extremely scrappy second half in which Derby offered nothing, Hull 
scored their third courtesy of Andrew Robertson to take a 3-0 lead back to the 
KC Stadium next Tuesday.

More on that Robertson goal: Tom Ince took a corner for Derby, which failed to 
clear the first defender.Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> lost every battle as Hull 
broke out of their own penalty area in droves. The ball was played to Robertson 
on the edge of the box and with defenders being pulled out of position by decoy 
runners, he picked his spot and drove the ball past Caron from the edge of the 
penalty area. It was a fine finish which has almost certainly put this play-off 
semi-final beyond Derby.

Full time: Derby County 0-3 Hull City

It’s all over! Boos ring out around the iPro stadium as Hull City celebrate a 
fine win over opposition who were little short of abject this afternoon. It’s 
half-time in the tie, but the jig is almost certainly up forDerby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>. They must travel to the KC 
Stadium on Tuesday in an attempt to overcome a three-goal deficit. It’s never 
been done before in the play-offs and if they perform like they did today, 
they’ll get another hiding.

GOAL! Derby County 0-3 Hull City (Robertson 90)

From that pathetic effort at a corner, Hull break down the field in numbers. 
The ball finds its way to Robertson who fires into the bottom corner from the 
edge of the penalty area. Woeful stuff from Derby, but a fine counter-attacking 
goal fromHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity>.

90+2 min: Eldin Jakupovic goes down holding his face and looking badly hurt 
after a heavy collision with his own right-back Moses Odubajo. The pair 
collided as they scrambled to clear a loose ball in the penalty area. Darren 
Bent, recently on for Will Hughes, had headed the ball into the path of Tom 
Ince and goalkeeper and defender collided as they attempted to prevent him 
scoring.

88 min: A chorus of “We are going up!” strikes up in the stands. I’m guessing 
that’s from the away end. Derby will be dreadfully disappointed with their 
showing today - they’ve failed to do themselves any sort of justice.

80 min: This second half has been remarkably moribund and scrappy. I haven’t

77 min: There’s a pause a play as Bryson receives treatment after receiving an 
accidental arm in the face from Snodgrass. Bryson gets patched up and is now 
sporting a black bandage around his head. That’s an interesting deaprture in 
the field of field dressings.

76 min: Derby swing the free-kick into the Hull penalty area, where Martin 
gets the flick-on and Christie heads over at the far post. That was a 
half-decent chance.

74 min: Moses Odubajo gets a long overdue yellow card for time-wasting on a 
throw-in and is lucky to avoid getting a second one soon after for a blatant 
trip on ... I think, Tom Ince. Poor refereeing from Neil Swarbrick, who has 
bottled a big decision there. Hull should be down to 10 men.

60 min: We approach the hour mark, with Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> two goals down, without a 
shot on goal and struggling to create anything in the way of a scoring 
opportunity. Shackell is penalised for a foul on Abel Hernandez after scything 
through the back of the Hull striker. Free-kick for Hull City, about 35 yards 
from the Derby goal.

58 min: Hull City must be loving this - Derby are playing at a very slow

a potential tie-killer on the break.

55 min: Andrew Robertson gallops down the wing after poking the ball ahead of 
him and attempts to get in a cross. Richard Keogh appears to put the ball out 
for a corner, but none is forthcoming. Replays show that Keogh didn’t actually 
touch the ball, which was put out by Robertson. Good decision.

53 min: Snodgrass attempts to latch on to a Livermore ball in behind the Derby 
defence, but it bounces unkindly for him and he’s forced wide. Tom Ince takes 
advantage of a break in play to change his boots.

50 min: Derby enjoy a period of sustained possession but do nothing with it. 
Hull City’s reserve goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic has yet to be tested in this 
game, which is a fairly damning indictment on the home side’s attacking 
prowess. On Sky Sports, co-comms man Don Goodman stresses the need forDerby 
County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> to “up the tempo”.

48 min: Good work from Diame, who holds the ball up well in the corner, before 
winning a corner off Will Hughes. Robert Snodgrass swings the ball into the 
penalty area, where Curtis Davies out-jumps Richard Keogh and sends a thumping 
header over the bar.

Derby County v Hull City - second half is go ...

46 min: Derby get the second half started with no changes in personnel on 
either side. They’re two goals down at home and in deep, deep trouble. They 
lost their composure towards the end of the first half, but a goal will see 
them right back in this tie.

Half-time: Derby County 0-2 Hull City

Half-time: Neil Swarbrick blows for the interval and Derby’s shell-shocked 
players troop off looking down the barrel of a hideous home defeat. They 
dominated before Hull opened the scoring courtesy of Abel Hernandez. With Hull 
on top and threatening to double their lead, the second goal duly came courtesy 
of a double-deflection that cannoned into the net off the back of Jason 
Shackell. Stat time: no teasm has ever qualified for the final of the play-offs 
after going into the second leg of their semi-final with a deficit of two goals 
or more.

42 min: An absolute sickener for Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>, who find themselves two 
goals down after an extremely lucky goal for Hull City. Moses Odubajo shot 
speculatively from the edge of the penalty area, the ball took a deflection off 
Marcus Olsson, before takinganother even more horrible deflection off the back 
of Jason Shackell and finding it’s way into past a hopelessly wrong-footed 
Scott Carson. You can’t really legislate for misfortune like that.

39 min: Having been in the ascendency until Hull opened the scoring, Derby 
look really rattled and in grave danger of conceding a second goal. Half-time 
can’t come quickly enough for them. They’ll do well to get back to the dressing 
room without conceding a second.

38 min: Mo Diame drifts into space on the edge of the Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> penalty area, picks up an 
Andrew Robertson through ball and sends a diagonal effort trundling across the 
face of goal andthis wide of the far post. That was a great chance to pile the 
hurt on Derby.

36 min: Moses Odubajo goes rampaging run down the right wing and rides a 
tackle from Marcus Olsson (who is already on a yellow card) and continues his 
gallop. He takes one touch too many, which allows Tom Ince to relieve him of 
possession. Brilliant covering by Ince. I suspect if Odubajo had gone down 
under that Olsson tackle,Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> might have found themselves 
down to 10 men.

Derby started reasonably well and were certainly dominating when Abel 
Hernandez scored forHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> 
against the run of play. With half-time approaching and Derby on the ropes, 
Hull were rather fortuitous to go two up to a freakish own goal, the ball 
taking two deflections on its way past the helpless Scott Carson. At the scrag 
end of an extremely scrappy second half in which Derby offered nothing, Hull 
scored their third courtesy of Andrew Robertson to take a 3-0 lead back to the 
KC Stadium next Tuesday.
 
More on that Robertson goal: Tom Ince took a corner for Derby, which failed to 
clear the first defender.Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> lost every battle as Hull 
broke out of their own penalty area in droves. The ball was played to Robertson 
on the edge of the box and with defenders being pulled out of position by decoy 
runners, he picked his spot and drove the ball past Caron from the edge of the 
penalty area. It was a fine finish which has almost certainly put this play-off 
semi-final beyond Derby.
 
It’s all over! Boos ring out around the iPro stadium as Hull City celebrate a 
fine win over opposition who were little short of abject this afternoon. It’s 
half-time in the tie, but the jig is almost certainly up forDerby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>. They must travel to the KC 
Stadium on Tuesday in an attempt to overcome a three-goal deficit. It’s never 
been done before in the play-offs and if they perform like they did today, 
they’ll get another hiding.
 
From that pathetic effort at a corner, Hull break down the field in numbers. 
The ball finds its way to Robertson who fires into the bottom corner from the 
edge of the penalty area. Woeful stuff from Derby, but a fine counter-attacking 
goal fromHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity>.

90+6 min: Derby win a corner and Paul Ince fails to clear the first man. 
 
90+4 min: Jakupovic and Odubajo are both fit to continue after a lengthy spell 
receiving treatment. Hull substitution: Alex Bruce on for Mo Diame. Derby 
substitution I didn’t notice earlier: Sam Clucas on for Robert Snodgrass.
 
90+2 min: Eldin Jakupovic goes down holding his face and looking badly hurt 
after a heavy collision with his own right-back Moses Odubajo. The pair 
collided as they scrambled to clear a loose ball in the penalty area. Darren 
Bent, recently on for Will Hughes, had headed the ball into the path of Tom 
Ince and goalkeeper and defender collided as they attempted to prevent him 
scoring.

88 min: A chorus of “We are going up!” strikes up in the stands. I’m guessing 
that’s from the away end. Derby will be dreadfully disappointed with their 
showing today - they’ve failed to do themselves any sort of justice.

85 min: Derby win a free-kick wide on the left, which Paul Ince sends into the 
mixer. It’s headed clear by Curtis Davies.
 
84 min: Hull City substitution: Hernandez off, Chuba Akpom on. Hernandez gets 
a big bear-hug from Steve Bruce as he leaves the field.
 
82 min: Tom Ince advances on the Hull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> penalty area and unleashes a 
low diagonal drive. It’s going well wide of the far post, but Jakupovic dives 
to put it out for a corner anyway.
 
80 min: This second half has been remarkably moribund and scrappy. I haven’t 
seen much ofDerby County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> 
this season, but they’re surely better than this. After a promising opening 20 
minutes, their players have really retreated into their shells since Hull City 
opened the scoring. There’s no sense of urgency about them at all.
 
78 min: Derby go forward, attacking down the right wing. Christie plays a 
cross-field pass towards Paul Ince, who is hunted down by Odubajo.
 
77 min: There’s a pause a play as Bryson receives treatment after receiving an 
accidental arm in the face from Snodgrass. Bryson gets patched up and is now 
sporting a black bandage around his head. That’s an interesting deaprture in 
the field of field dressings.
 
76 min: Derby swing the free-kick into the Hull penalty area, where Martin 
gets the flick-on and Christie heads over at the far post. That was a 
half-decent chance.

74 min: Moses Odubajo gets a long overdue yellow card for time-wasting on a 
throw-in and is lucky to avoid getting a second one soon after for a blatant 
trip on ... I think, Tom Ince. Poor refereeing from Neil Swarbrick, who has 
bottled a big decision there. Hull should be down to 10 men.
 
70 min: Derby County substitution: Nick Blackman on for Johnny Russell. 
Moments before the change, Eldin Jakupovic was pressed into action for the 
first time in theHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> 
goal, coming off his line to leap and paw away a cross from Cyrus Christie. The 
ball dropped for Craig Bryson, who fired well wide.

68 min: Odubajo and Huddlestone attempt to combine down the right for Hull 
City, but a misplaced pass gifts a throw-in toDerby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>. This is dreadful football 
fare, which Hull City fans will happily sit through for the remaining 20 
minutes or so.
 
67 min: Hull clear the ensuing inswinger and win a throw-in in Derby territory 
which Moses Odubajo takes.
 
65 min: Derby win a corner after good work down the right from Chris Martin. A 
corner!
 
64 min: Livermore is fouled by Hughes on the edge of his own penalty area, 
earning Hull an opportunity to clear their lines. This is very, very scrappy 
... which will suit Hull just fine.

63 min: Livermore and Snodgrass take a short corner for reasons best known to 
themselves. Will Hughes wins the ball back for Derby.
 
61 min: Robert Snodgrass shoots for goal, but his effort is headed out for a 
corner by Shackell. The goalkeeper had that covered, but didn’t appear to call 
for it.
 
60 min: We approach the hour mark, with Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> two goals down, without a 
shot on goal and struggling to create anything in the way of a scoring 
opportunity. Shackell is penalised for a foul on Abel Hernandez after scything 
through the back of the Hull striker. Free-kick for Hull City, about 35 yards 
from the Derby goal.
 
59 min: Derby substitution: Bradley Johnson off, Jacob Butterfield on. 
 
58 min: Hull City must be loving this - Derby are playing at a very slow 
tempo, which makes it easy for them to soak up the pressure and hopefully grab 
a potential tie-killer on the break.
 
56 min: Snodgrass picks out Hernandez between the lines, but the Hull striker 
is crowded off the ball.
 
55 min: Andrew Robertson gallops down the wing after poking the ball ahead of 
him and attempts to get in a cross. Richard Keogh appears to put the ball out 
for a corner, but none is forthcoming. Replays show that Keogh didn’t actually 
touch the ball, which was put out by Robertson. Good decision.
 
53 min: Snodgrass attempts to latch on to a Livermore ball in behind the Derby 
defence, but it bounces unkindly for him and he’s forced wide. Tom Ince takes 
advantage of a break in play to change his boots.
 
50 min: Derby enjoy a period of sustained possession but do nothing with it. 
Hull City’s reserve goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic has yet to be tested in this 
game, which is a fairly damning indictment on the home side’s attacking 
prowess. On Sky Sports, co-comms man Don Goodman stresses the need forDerby 
County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> to “up the tempo”.
 
49 min: Bradley Johnson is penalised for a foul on Moses Odubajo halfway 
inside theHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> half.

48 min: Good work from Diame, who holds the ball up well in the corner, before 
winning a corner off Will Hughes. Robert Snodgrass swings the ball into the 
penalty area, where Curtis Davies out-jumps Richard Keogh and sends a thumping 
header over the bar.
 
47 min: Derby win a throw-in halfway inside the Hull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> half, play it backwards and 
attempt to build from the back. Tom Ince loses possession to Mo Diame in the 
corner and Hull move forward.
 
46 min: Derby get the second half started with no changes in personnel on 
either side. They’re two goals down at home and in deep, deep trouble. They 
lost their composure towards the end of the first half, but a goal will see 
them right back in this tie.
 
Half-time: Neil Swarbrick blows for the interval and Derby’s shell-shocked 
players troop off looking down the barrel of a hideous home defeat. They 
dominated before Hull opened the scoring courtesy of Abel Hernandez. With Hull 
on top and threatening to double their lead, the second goal duly came courtesy 
of a double-deflection that cannoned into the net off the back of Jason 
Shackell. Stat time: no teasm has ever qualified for the final of the play-offs 
after going into the second leg of their semi-final with a deficit of two goals 
or more.

 45+3 min: Robert Snodgrass attempts to play Abel Hernandez through on goal 
with a neat through-ball, but in his attempts to stay onside, theHull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> striker allows Derby County’s 
defenders to regroup.

 
45 min: We’re into time added on at the end of a first half Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> will be eager to forget. 
Jake Livermore gets booked for a nasty challenge on Richard Keogh.
 
42 min: An absolute sickener for Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty>, who find themselves two 
goals down after an extremely lucky goal for Hull City. Moses Odubajo shot 
speculatively from the edge of the penalty area, the ball took a deflection off 
Marcus Olsson, before takinganother even more horrible deflection off the back 
of Jason Shackell and finding it’s way into past a hopelessly wrong-footed 
Scott Carson. You can’t really legislate for misfortune like that.

Just call me Mystic Baz, eh? Hull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> double their lead courtesy of a 
complete fluke!

39 min: Having been in the ascendency until Hull opened the scoring, Derby 
look really rattled and in grave danger of conceding a second goal. Half-time 
can’t come quickly enough for them. They’ll do well to get back to the dressing 
room without conceding a second.
 
38 min: Mo Diame drifts into space on the edge of the Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> penalty area, picks up an 
Andrew Robertson through ball and sends a diagonal effort trundling across the 
face of goal andthis wide of the far post. That was a great chance to pile the 
hurt on Derby.
 
36 min: Moses Odubajo goes rampaging run down the right wing and rides a 
tackle from Marcus Olsson (who is already on a yellow card) and continues his 
gallop. He takes one touch too many, which allows Tom Ince to relieve him of 
possession. Brilliant covering by Ince. I suspect if Odubajo had gone down 
under that Olsson tackle,Derby County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty> might have found themselves 
down to 10 men.
 
35 min: Michael Dawson is penalised for wrestling Chris Martin to the ground 
and then booked for kicking the ball away in an act of petulance.
