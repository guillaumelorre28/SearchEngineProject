Many of us may already be struggling with our New Year’s resolutions, but at 
least we can take comfort in modern neuroscience. Forty years ago, we’d have 
been less hopeful.

Back then neuroscience would say that the brain was fixed after early 
childhood. One famous experiment in the 1960s showed that if kittens were 
placed in a visually deprived environment in the days and weeks after birth, 
their sight as older cats would be impaired.

Similar experiences later in life did not have this effect, which fitted with 
the idea that what happens in early childhood changes our brains fundamentally, 
but they’re fixed after that point.

However, since then, more evidence has been found for the growth of new nerve 
cells in adult brains. Knowing this may help us to break bad habits and make 
new ones. So neuroscience has caught up with common sense and accepts the idea 
that new brain circuits can form as a result of experience. And if you take one 
thing away from this column, it’s because something in the structure of your 
brain has changed.
