Reports in France on Tuesday stated that Marseille are looking to sign the 
left-back as part of new owner Frank McCourt’s recruitment drive, with La 
Provence claiming sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta is in talks with the 
player’s representatives over a potential move.

Liverpool and Everton have also been linked with a move for the 22-year-old, 
who has made 17 appearances for Villa in the Championship this season after 
recovering from a serious knee injury sustained on international duty in 
November 2015that ruled him out for the rest of the season

But responding on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/Dr_TonyXia/status/813719449610035201> to the reported €10m 
(£8.5m) bid from Marseille, Xia was adamant Amavi will not be leaving Villa 
Park.

“Don’t bother reading this,” he wrote. “I can tell we have rejected an offer 
of £25m for @JordanAmavi. He will grow bigger at @AVFCOfficial!”

Villa paid around £9m to sign Amavi from Nice last summer and his current deal 
expires in 2020.

Xia also responded to speculation that Jordan Veretout could be on his way to 
Juventus. The French midfielder is on loan at St Etienne but has been offered 
to the Italian champions, according to reports. Xia said: “We will accept this 
Jordan leaving as he didn’t feel happy at Villa.”

The Villa manager Steve Bruce is in the market for several new recruits as 
they chase an instant return to the Premier League, with Brentford’s Alan Judge 
among those being considered. The Republic of Ireland international has yet to 
return from a broken leg but could be available for a cut-price fee as his 
contract expires in the summer.
