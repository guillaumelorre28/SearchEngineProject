The BHS <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs> building sits on Victoria 
Square, where one assistant would keep an eye on the town hall clock and an ear 
on the roar from what was then the Wanderers’ home ground at Burnden Park. Ten 
minutes after the final whistle, the cry of “batten down the hatches” would 
spread along the L-shaped shop floor. Home fans took great glee in running in 
at the town hall entrance with both arms out, aeroplane style, running their 
hands along the tops of the waist-high counters and throwing whatever they 
could grab high into the air, out of the other exit. I used to dread being on 
the knickers counter.
