Edinson Cavani opened the scoring in the 35th minute from Ibrahimovic’s cross 
before the Sweden striker doubled the tally on the stroke of half-time from the 
penalty spot following the sending-off of Niklas Hult.

Ibrahimovic made it 3-0 after the break with his 12th league goal of the 
season, taking him to 86 league goals for the club to surpass Mustapha Dahleb’s 
previous record.

Three days after PSG were held to a 0-0 draw by promoted Angers, normal 
service resumed for the capital side who crushed Nice seemingly effortlessly at 
the Allianz Riviera.

After a fine one-two with Blaise Matuidi, Ibrahimovic set up Cavani, who beat 
Yoan Cardinale from close range.

In the 42nd minute Hult brought down Ibrahimovic in the box and PSG’s talisman 
striker converted the spot kick.

Hatem Ben Arfa, who has had an impressive start to the season at Nice, was 
kept at bay by a solid PSG defence.

Shortly after the hour, Ibrahimovic put the result beyond doubt with a low 
angled cross shot.
