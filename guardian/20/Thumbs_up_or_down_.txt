The main argument last month was provoked by a batch of Quick crosswords where 
the setter put in clues that involved anagrams of other solutions. Sometimes 
these also had a second defintions, as in ‘Sign on – 13 (anag) (6)’ for ENLIST, 
where the solution to 13 across was TINSEL; sometimes they did not, as in ‘6 
(anag) (9)’ for BACTERIAL, where the solution to 6 down was CALIBRATE. The 
reaction, though not as feral as the current exchanges between Conservative 
Members of Parliament over last week’s budget, pulled no punches. It ranged 
from saying that it was fun to work on anagrams to saying that anagrams were a 
cheap, petty, lazy and intensely annoying way of producing Quick puzzles. The 
problem for the editor is that the engaging exchanges in the comment columns 
are dominated by a very small proportion of our large solvership and, by 
definition, may not reflect the views of the silent majority of solvers. So it 
would be very helpful to have a wider range of views for or against (or 
expressing indifference either way to) clues based on anagrams, either as a 
comment under this blog or in an email to me atcrossword.editor@theguardian.com 
<mailto:crossword.editor@theguardian.com>.

Speaking of anagrams, from time to time the Crytpic crossword clues used to 
contain extremely long ones. Some will remember Araucaria’s ‘surprisingly 
chaste Lord Archer’ for THE OLD VICARAGE, GRANCHESTER, or Paul’s even longer 
classic that produced four lines from a Spike Milligan poem: THERE ARE HOLES IN 
THE SKY/WHERE THE RAIN GETS IN,/BUT THEY’RE EVER SO SMALL,/THAT’S WHY RAIN IS 
THIN.
The downside of their brilliance is that, if you can crack the clue, at one 
stroke you have got a large part of the puzzle. However, here is a long anagram 
right up in that class, which has been passed to me and which I offer to you as 
an early Easter holiday activity.
‘In one of the Bard’s best-thought-of tragedies our insistent hero, Hamlet, 
queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten (anag) 
(2,2,2,3,2,2,4,2,3,8,7,3,6,2,3,4,2,6,3,5,3,6,2,10,6)’
The clue is not fully complete and I should be pleased if, having solved what 
is there, someone was able to take it further.

And, speaking of the Quicks, the debate rumbles on inconclusively about 
whether they are dumbing down or getting harder. But, for those who find that 
any particular Quick is completed too quickly and need some way of filling a 
gap for family or other group, here is a suggestion that was sent to me by 
Felicity in the Isle of Man. You ask all those who want to play to write a 
story of 100 words or less, within whatever time limit you choose, that 
includes all the solution words of that day’s Quick puzzle. Felicity tookQuick 
No 14,211

for 25 November last year and produced:
‘Electra, after one of the ambassador’s dances in Rotterdam, slumbered deeply. 
Her sycophant sister Tosca, always on the cadge, stole the signet ring, a 
shiningexhibit on Electra’s finger, and, in a fit of peevishness , hid it in the
urn of nutmeg … ’ (there was more, but you get the principle of this new game).

You seem to have found the February Genius (No 152 by Enigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/feb/01/genius-crossword-no-152>) 
quite tough. First in, by a distance was M1F, but not until 04:13. The next 
pair were Price at 07:45 and PSC in Australia at 07:58. After that there was no 
entry until 10:30. There were 20 entries on the first day and 237 by the 
deadline. Congratulations to Tim Francis from Bathampton, who is the winner of 
the February competition.
