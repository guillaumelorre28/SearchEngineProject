Turkish authorities called off the Galatasaray-Fenerbahçe derby in Istanbul 
about two hours before kickoff on Sunday, citing an unspecified threat, and 
said the match would be played at a later date.

A brief statement from the Istanbul governor’s office said the match was 
cancelled following “the assessment of serious intelligence”, but didn’t 
provide details. It said the decision was made following “the request and the 
agreement” of the two bitter rivals.

Unconfirmed media reports said there was a bomb threat at the stadium.

The decision came a day after an Islamic State-linked suicide bomber killed 
himself and four foreign tourists on Istanbul’s main pedestrian street. The 
attack was the sixth suicide bombing inTurkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> since July that have either been 
blamed on Isis or claimed by Kurdish militants.

It came amid heightened alert in Turkey in the run-up to the Kurdish spring 
festival of Newroz, which has led to violent confrontations between Kurdish 
protesters and Turkish security forces in the past.

Earlier, fans were told that the game would be played without spectators, the 
state-run Anatole agency reported, leading to protests by fans who were already 
inside the stadium. But authorities later decided to delay the game.

Also on Sunday, Turkey’s national team cancelled training scheduled for Monday 
in Istanbul ahead of international games against Sweden and Austria, Hurried 
newspaper reported, adding that training would take place in the city of 
Antalya.
