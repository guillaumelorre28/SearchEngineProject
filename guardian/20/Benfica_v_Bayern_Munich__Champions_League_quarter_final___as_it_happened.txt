Full-time: Benfica 2-2 Bayern (agg: 2-3)

Benfica’s efforts are applauded by the home fans and rightly so. But Bayern 
are the team heading to the semi-final, and that is also right, although 
Martinez should have been sent off. The Germans are a formidable side because 
they keep and move the ball so well but they are a little flakey defensively. 
Ergo they are beatable. It would be interesting to see them against Atletico 
Madrid in the semi-final. That would leave Manchester City to face Real Madrid, 
the only remaining team that Manuel Pellegrini’s side look capable of bettering 
over two legs.

90+1 min: Ribéry lifts the ball over Almeida’s slide tackle but gets caught by 
the defender himself. Booking for Almeida. Ribéry gets up and walks off to be 
replaced by Gotze.

89 min: A miss, an actual miss by Lewandowski! And a very bad one, at that. He 
as sent running clear on goal and went for a neat sidefooter into the far 
corner but totally fluffed it and ended up just rolling the ball into the 
waiting keeper’s arms.

85 min: Martinez chops down Talisca about six yards outside the area. The rf 
decides not to issue the defender with a second yellow card. Can Talisca exact 
retribution from the freekick again? Very nearly! He curls a fine effort inches 
past the far post.

Bayern substitution: Lewandowski on, Muller off. Reports in Germany are 
suggesting that the reason the Pole did not start tonight is that he was 
involved in a minor car accident on Sunday.

82 min: Alonso - always him - clips a pass over the out-rushing Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> defence. Muller takes it down 
and shapes to shoot from 12 yards, but Jardel rushes over to hoof the ball 
behind for a corner.

74 min: A long ball from the back catches out Martinez, who allows Guedes to 
get on the wrong side of him and start running towards the box. Martinez, in 
desperation, stretches out a leg and takes him down at the end of the area. It 
seems a certain red card ... but the ref only shows a yellow!Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> fans and staff are outraged. But 
all they’ve got to show for it is a freekick at the edge of the box, a little 
to the right. Justice not done there. Refs should be allowed to give a penalty 
for that sort of offence no matter where it occurred.

72 min: Muller collects a throughball and then lays it back to Vidal, who 
sends a soft sidefooter towards Ederson from 18 yards. And the keeper nearly 
fumbles it into the net! Luckily for him, the ball went just wide so he escaped

70 min: An extravagant flick takes Costa past Carcela, who responds by 
whacking the winger to the ground. Understandable but not strictly part of the 
game. The ref feels obliged to book him.

66 min: Renato Sanches has impressed tonight at the age of 18. You can see why 
he’s so coveted. A powerful runner, impossible to knock off the ball and clever 
and adroit in the way he uses it, he looks like he’d fit in to nearly any 
midfield in the world.
 Renato Sanches scampers away from the challenge of Thiago Alcantara.

64 min: Chance for Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> as 
Vidal clunks into Carcela about 20 yards from Bayern’s goal. The Chilean 
immediately starts pleading with the ref not to book him. The ref chooses 
leniency, sparing Vidal a suspension from the first leg of the semi-final. To 
top it off, the freekick is wasted.

GOAL! Benfica 1-2 Bayern (Muller 52) (agg: 1-3)

Nothing fancy about that goal. Alonso floats a corner way over to the far post.
Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> defenders run away from 
it, leaving Martinez to leap high and nut the ball back across goal. Muller 
sticks out a leg and pokes it into the net from close range. Game over.

47 min: A long clearance from back drops behind Bayern’s last defender, and 
suddenly Jimenez looks like he might sprint on to it. But Neuer, the 
sweeper-keeper supreme, strides forth from his box and snuffs out the danger.

46 min: Reanto Sanches tips the ball to Pizzi to set the second half in motion 
Benfica need to score two ore goals without conceding. It doesn’t look likely 
but hey, Leicester are top of the Premier League so who knows what could 
happen? “As a City fan, I actually would love to be drawn against Bayern in the 
semi-final,” confesses Matt Collins. “The Guardiola-Pellegrini narrative would 
make for great entertainment. Better than that, Pep clearly has the same 
semis-but-no-further block that Jose had at Real Madrid. Plus an unlikely 
finalist is long overdue.” It’s not very logical, nor particularly accurate 
(Pep’s semi-final-and-no-further block has brought him twoChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> titles), but at least 
it’s not defeatist thinking.

splendid counter-attacking goal and some rickety Bayern defending. But 
ultimately class looks like telling. Or doBenfica

43 min: Vidal’s goal has fallen like an anvil on Benfica’s belief. Bayern are 
coasting now. They’re looking for a second goal to make sure. Vidal is not too 
far from getting one, chesting down a pass over the top from Alonso and then 
smashing a half-volley just over from 18 yards.

GOAL! Benfica 1-1 Bayern (Vidal 38) (agg: 1-2)

OK, Bayern were dangerous there! A cute disguised pass down the right by Costa 
found Lahm, who fired the ball across the face of goal. Ederson dived at it 
superman style and punched it one-handed to the edge of the area. Vidal arrived 
and lashed a well-controlled half-volley with his left foot and into the 
unguarded goal! A lovely strike that should settle this tie. There’ll certainly 
be no extra-time, anyway.

37 min: This has been a tremendous display by Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> so far. They’re played with huge 
commitment and poise and they look the more dangerous team going forward, even 
if they get to go forward a lot less frequently than Bayern.

35 min: Another chance for Bayern, again courtesy of a crossfield ball. Lahm 
is the recipient this time but his first touch is not deft enough, allowing 
Ederson to rush off his line and snaffle the ball.

33 min: Bayern steady themselves and get back on the front foot again. Ribéry 
hoiks a cross in from the left. Vidal, arriving at speed from deep, failed to 
trouble the keeper with a header. At what point can we start describing the 
omission of Robert Lewandowski as unacceptable smart-arsery?

30 min: It should have been 2-0! Terrible defending by Bayern as two players 
failed to intercept a cut-back from Salvio. That allows Jimenez to collect it 
eight yards out but he rushes his shot as more defenders converge on him and 
winds up scuffing his shot. Comfortable save by Neuer.

match,Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have absorbed all 
the pressure Bayern could put on them and then gave the Germans a lesson in 
finishing. We’re level on aggregate and there’s no telling what’ll happen now!

GOAL! Benfica 1-0 Bayern (Jimenez 27) (agg: 1-1)

A beautiful counter-attacking goal, totally against the run of play! A superb 
curling cross from the left by Eliseu is met by Jimenez, who jumped between two 
defenders and left Neuer clawing at thin air as he headed into the net from 12 
yards!

22 min: I don’t have stats to hand, but a rough estimate is that Bayern have 
had a million touches so far, andBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> five. The hosts are having to 
run and concentrate hard not to succumb to the monotonous pressure. Vidal is 
the latest to threaten, this time with a header from another dinked pass by 
Thiago. It’s another straightforward save for Ederson, though. For all their 
dominance, Bayern have not yet alarmed the keeper.

19 min: Alonso sweeps a ball out wide right. Lahm collects it and fires in a 
low cross, It’s slightly behind Muller but he still manages to make (almost) 
like the Isley Borthers and twist and shoot. But he’s under pressure from two 
Portuguese defenders, something the Isley Brothers never had to put up with it, 
and the ball trickles wide.

17 min: Costa takes down another long crossfield ball, then darts towards the 
Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> box. He threads a nice 
ball between two defenders and into the path of Lahm, who had raided from deep. 
Lahm has a clear sight of goal! But he decides to pass, and fails to pick out 
Muller in the middle. A great chance is wasted.

15 min: Bayern still can’t find a way through the centre of Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>. They are finding space way out 
wide, though, but have not been able to make productive use of it yet. Alaba 
has just skittered down the left and pinged in a low cross that the keeper 
gathered with no ado.

13 min: Bayern have taken ownership of the ball now, leaving Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> to chase after them like serfs. 
But these serfs are organised, their resistance strong. No openings for Bayern 
to exploit yet.

10 min: Thaigo makes a nice jinking run in-field from the left and then clips 
a searching pass forward towards Vidal. Lindelof strains his neck and heads the 
ball away. Good thing that, otherwise Would have had a free run at goal from 25 
yards.

with sufficient power to trouble the keeper, who easily stops the shot from 14

6 min: Jimenez does well to hold off a defender and take down a long punt from 
the back. He then knocks the ball wide, spins and darts forward in anticipation 
of a return pass. But Alaba wins it back for Bayern. It’s pretty even 
possession-wise so far.

outside the D of Bayern’s box. The young defender jumped with Jimenez and 
caught him in the must with a flailing arm. Not deliberate, but not legal.

Right on cue, the players amble out on the pitch. It’s a bright evening in 
Lisbon, and the Stadium of Light sounds superb, with home fans belting out 
ominous sounding chants. They could be saying “welcome dear German friends” for 
all I know, but itsounds brilliantly threatening.

something, this bird merely means the players are about to enter the arena,

Two names conspicuous by their absence from the Bayern line-up: Benatia, who 
remained in Germany because he (a) is injured or (b) pithed up at Munich 
airport without his passport (delete depending on whether you believe the 
player or German newspapers); and Lewandowski, whom Guardiola has decided to 
leave on the bench. That’s wealth, folks.

Preamble

Hello and thanks for coming. Let’s see what we can do here. Previously in this 
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> 
quarter-final Bayern Munich spluttered to a 1-0 home win and Professor Pep 
Guardiola swotted away suggestions that his advanced football beings had looked 
rather ordinary by claiming that Benfica have the best defence in Europe. It 
was tough to square that with the knowledge that Benfica had lost 2-1 in 
Galatasaray earlier in the competition, and drawn 2-2 at Astana of Kazakhstan, 
but that was before the 21-year-old Swede Victor Linderof was introduced to 
Benfica’s defence and, besides, you shouldn’t expect to understand things 
Guardiola says because he talks from a higher plane.

As if dealing with a superior mind is not hard enough, Benfica are tonight 
also making their latest attempt to banish a supernatural force, namely the 
curse of Bela Guttman. That, as you know, was a heroic Up Yours delivered by 
the Hungarian manager before walking out on his employers in protest at being 
denied a wage rise following victory in the 1962 European Cup final. Benfica 
have failed to win a continental title since then, losing no less than eight 
finals. And in what Guttman might consider as an equally delicious pay-off, the 
financial system is also now aligned againstBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>, which helps explain why this is 
their first quarter-final in Europe’s top competition since 2012 and they have 
not made it to the last four since 1990, when typing abuse at passers-by online 
was the stuff of science fiction and Pluto was a planet. Bayern, by contrast, 
are in their fourth Champions League quarter-final in a row. But they have yet 
to win the competition under their current manager, which does not quite bring 
us into The Curse of Guardiola territory but is a dark mark against the 
Catalan, all the same. Elimination tonight would be unbearable for him, 
particularly with Manuel Pellegrini swilling metaphorical semi-final cocktails 
with Manchester City.

 Almost everything is in Guardiola’s favour tonight, especially as Benfica are 
deprived of their top scorer, with Jonas suspended. But Benfica’s manager, Rui 
Vitoria, who is not the sort to make excuses. He has already proven his ability 
to adapt to adversity by thrusting Renato Sanches into the fray earlier this 
season (the 18-year-old has since established himself as one of the brightest 
young midfielder in Europe) and shrugging off an injury to goalkeeper Julio 
Cesar by giving a debut to Ederson in the quarter-final win over Zenit St 
Petersburg. Vitoria has said his team will play on the counter-attack here, as 
if they have a choice. It’s going to be fun seeing what happens.

Benfica’s efforts are applauded by the home fans and rightly so. But Bayern 
are the team heading to the semi-final, and that is also right, although 
Martinez should have been sent off. The Germans are a formidable side because 
they keep and move the ball so well but they are a little flakey defensively. 
Ergo they are beatable. It would be interesting to see them against Atletico 
Madrid in the semi-final. That would leave Manchester City to face Real Madrid, 
the only remaining team that Manuel Pellegrini’s side look capable of bettering 
over two legs.

Thomas Müller seals semi-final place as Bayern Munich see off Benfica

Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images  
90+1 min: Ribéry lifts the ball over Almeida’s slide tackle but gets caught by 
the defender himself. Booking for Almeida. Ribéry gets up and walks off to be 
replaced by Gotze.
 
Bayern substitution: Bernat on, Alonso off. 
 
89 min: A miss, an actual miss by Lewandowski! And a very bad one, at that. He 
as sent running clear on goal and went for a neat sidefooter into the far 
corner but totally fluffed it and ended up just rolling the ball into the 
waiting keeper’s arms.
 
Benfica substitution: Josic on, Eliseu off 
 
87 min: Costa, a constantly foraging menace down the left, goes to work again. 
But once he offloads to MullerBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> win it back and resume their 
rather forlorn chase for the two goals they need.
 
85 min: Martinez chops down Talisca about six yards outside the area. The rf 
decides not to issue the defender with a second yellow card. Can Talisca exact 
retribution from the freekick again? Very nearly! He curls a fine effort inches 
past the far post.
 
Bayern substitution: Lewandowski on, Muller off. Reports in Germany are 
suggesting that the reason the Pole did not start tonight is that he was 
involved in a minor car accident on Sunday.
 
82 min: Alonso - always him - clips a pass over the out-rushing Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> defence. Muller takes it down 
and shapes to shoot from 12 yards, but Jardel rushes over to hoof the ball 
behind for a corner.
 
81 min: Renato Sanches shoves Ribéry to the ground. Again, understandable but 
not strictly part of the game.
 
79 min: Bayern resume trying to asphyxiate their hosts. They circulate the 
ball methodically, forcingBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>
 to scamper desperately after it.
 
Justice done! And with great panache, too! What a freekick by Talisco! He 
curled the ball over the wall with power and precision, leaving Neuer clutching 
air as the ball hurtled into the top corner. Game on? Probably not, butBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are not going to go down without 
a fight.

74 min: A long ball from the back catches out Martinez, who allows Guedes to 
get on the wrong side of him and start running towards the box. Martinez, in 
desperation, stretches out a leg and takes him down at the end of the area. It 
seems a certain red card ... but the ref only shows a yellow!Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> fans and staff are outraged. But 
all they’ve got to show for it is a freekick at the edge of the box, a little 
to the right. Justice not done there. Refs should be allowed to give a penalty 
for that sort of offence no matter where it occurred.
 
72 min: Muller collects a throughball and then lays it back to Vidal, who 
sends a soft sidefooter towards Ederson from 18 yards. And the keeper nearly 
fumbles it into the net! Luckily for him, the ball went just wide so he escaped 
with just conceding a corner.
 
70 min: An extravagant flick takes Costa past Carcela, who responds by 
whacking the winger to the ground. Understandable but not strictly part of the 
game. The ref feels obliged to book him.
 
Benfica substitution: Talisca on, Salvio off. 
 
66 min: Renato Sanches has impressed tonight at the age of 18. You can see why 
he’s so coveted. A powerful runner, impossible to knock off the ball and clever 
and adroit in the way he uses it, he looks like he’d fit in to nearly any 
midfield in the world.

Photograph: Octavio Passos/Getty Images  
64 min: Chance for Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> as 
Vidal clunks into Carcela about 20 yards from Bayern’s goal. The Chilean 
immediately starts pleading with the ref not to book him. The ref chooses 
leniency, sparing Vidal a suspension from the first leg of the semi-final. To 
top it off, the freekick is wasted.
 
62 min: The ball breaks to Almeida about 28 yards from goal. What the hell, he 
has a shot. And Neuer takes no chances, palming it over for a corner, which 
Bayern defend well.
 
61 min: Bayern split the Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>
 defence again. Costa elects to take his shot early from 20 yards. It catches 
the keeper slightly by surprise and fizzes past him along the ground ... but 
out off the post!
 
60 min: Alaba slips after Alonso dissects the home defence again. The Austrian 
has a little chuckle, because it doesn’t really matter now.
 
Benfica substitution: Guedes on, Pizzi off. 
 
56 min: Eliseu, a graduate from the Rory Delap School of Mighty Flings, hurls 
a throw-in into the six-yard box. Kimmich clears.
 
54 min: Superb break by Bayern, who are in danger of running amok now. Costa 
lets them off the hook this time by miscontrolling and allowing Ederson to 
charge off his line and clasp the ball. But you get the feeling Bayern will be 
back in theBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> box real soon.

Costa. Photograph: Armando Franca/AP  
Nothing fancy about that goal. Alonso floats a corner way over to the far post.
Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> defenders run away from 
it, leaving Martinez to leap high and nut the ball back across goal. Muller 
sticks out a leg and pokes it into the net from close range. Game over.
 Thomas Müller, 2nd right, sticks out a leg to score Bayern’s second goal.

Marchante/Reuters  
51 min: Rentao Sanches barges Ribéry aside and tries to play a one-two at the 
edge of the Bayern box. But Kimmich reads his intention and puts paid to his 
meddling. Moments later Bayern are back down the other end, winning a corner.
 
49 min: Wicked cross with the outside of his boot by Costa. Jardel makes a 
well-timed headed intervention to stop Muller connecting with it in front of 
goal.
 
47 min: A long clearance from back drops behind Bayern’s last defender, and 
suddenly Jimenez looks like he might sprint on to it. But Neuer, the 
sweeper-keeper supreme, strides forth from his box and snuffs out the danger.
 
46 min: Reanto Sanches tips the ball to Pizzi to set the second half in motion 
Benfica need to score two ore goals without conceding. It doesn’t look likely 
but hey, Leicester are top of the Premier League so who knows what could 
happen? “As a City fan, I actually would love to be drawn against Bayern in the 
semi-final,” confesses Matt Collins. “The Guardiola-Pellegrini narrative would 
make for great entertainment. Better than that, Pep clearly has the same 
semis-but-no-further block that Jose had at Real Madrid. Plus an unlikely 
finalist is long overdue.” It’s not very logical, nor particularly accurate 
(Pep’s semi-final-and-no-further block has brought him twoChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> titles), but at least 
it’s not defeatist thinking.
 
Manchester City fans, fancy being drawn against Guardiola’s team in the 
semi-final?
 
For a while Benfica looked like pulling off mission improbable, thanks to a 
splendid counter-attacking goal and some rickety Bayern defending. But 
ultimately class looks like telling. Or doBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have a real shock up their 
sleeves?
 
43 min: Vidal’s goal has fallen like an anvil on Benfica’s belief. Bayern are 
coasting now. They’re looking for a second goal to make sure. Vidal is not too 
far from getting one, chesting down a pass over the top from Alonso and then 
smashing a half-volley just over from 18 yards.
 
41 min: Bayern work Lahm into space down the right again. He spoons in another 
cross, and Renato Sanches whacks it clear in a panic.
 
OK, Bayern were dangerous there! A cute disguised pass down the right by Costa 
found Lahm, who fired the ball across the face of goal. Ederson dived at it 
superman style and punched it one-handed to the edge of the area. Vidal arrived 
and lashed a well-controlled half-volley with his left foot and into the 
unguarded goal! A lovely strike that should settle this tie. There’ll certainly 
be no extra-time, anyway.

37 min: This has been a tremendous display by Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> so far. They’re played with huge 
commitment and poise and they look the more dangerous team going forward, even 
if they get to go forward a lot less frequently than Bayern.
 
35 min: Another chance for Bayern, again courtesy of a crossfield ball. Lahm 
is the recipient this time but his first touch is not deft enough, allowing 
Ederson to rush off his line and snaffle the ball.
 
33 min: Bayern steady themselves and get back on the front foot again. Ribéry 
hoiks a cross in from the left. Vidal, arriving at speed from deep, failed to 
trouble the keeper with a header. At what point can we start describing the 
omission of Robert Lewandowski as unacceptable smart-arsery?
 
30 min: It should have been 2-0! Terrible defending by Bayern as two players 
failed to intercept a cut-back from Salvio. That allows Jimenez to collect it 
eight yards out but he rushes his shot as more defenders converge on him and 
winds up scuffing his shot. Comfortable save by Neuer.
 
28 min: Rui Vitoria’s masterplan is working so far, then. Despite being 
deprived of several first-choice players, and also of the ball for most of the 
match,Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have absorbed all 
the pressure Bayern could put on them and then gave the Germans a lesson in 
finishing. We’re level on aggregate and there’s no telling what’ll happen now!
 
A beautiful counter-attacking goal, totally against the run of play! A superb 
curling cross from the left by Eliseu is met by Jimenez, who jumped between two 
defenders and left Neuer clawing at thin air as he headed into the net from 12 
yards!

 Then celebrates his fine header. Photograph: Rafael Marchante/Reuters  
22 min: I don’t have stats to hand, but a rough estimate is that Bayern have 
had a million touches so far, andBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> five. The hosts are having to 
run and concentrate hard not to succumb to the monotonous pressure. Vidal is 
the latest to threaten, this time with a header from another dinked pass by 
Thiago. It’s another straightforward save for Ederson, though. For all their 
dominance, Bayern have not yet alarmed the keeper.
 
19 min: Alonso sweeps a ball out wide right. Lahm collects it and fires in a 
low cross, It’s slightly behind Muller but he still manages to make (almost) 
like the Isley Borthers and twist and shoot. But he’s under pressure from two 
Portuguese defenders, something the Isley Brothers never had to put up with it, 
and the ball trickles wide.
 
17 min: Costa takes down another long crossfield ball, then darts towards the 
Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> box. He threads a nice 
ball between two defenders and into the path of Lahm, who had raided from deep. 
Lahm has a clear sight of goal! But he decides to pass, and fails to pick out 
Muller in the middle. A great chance is wasted.
 
15 min: Bayern still can’t find a way through the centre of Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>. They are finding space way out 
wide, though, but have not been able to make productive use of it yet. Alaba 
has just skittered down the left and pinged in a low cross that the keeper 
gathered with no ado.

Marchante/Reuters  
13 min: Bayern have taken ownership of the ball now, leaving Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> to chase after them like serfs. 
But these serfs are organised, their resistance strong. No openings for Bayern 
to exploit yet.
 
10 min: Thaigo makes a nice jinking run in-field from the left and then clips 
a searching pass forward towards Vidal. Lindelof strains his neck and heads the 
ball away. Good thing that, otherwise Would have had a free run at goal from 25 
yards.
 
8 min: Alonso wafts over a long corner. Martinez gets his head to it but not 
with sufficient power to trouble the keeper, who easily stops the shot from 14 
yards.
 
6 min: Jimenez does well to hold off a defender and take down a long punt from 
the back. He then knocks the ball wide, spins and darts forward in anticipation 
of a return pass. But Alaba wins it back for Bayern. It’s pretty even 
possession-wise so far.
 
4 min: Alonso spanks a long diagonal ball from deep towards Costa. But he 
overhits it and the ball runs out of play, to the audible glee of the locals.
 
3 min: Eliseu takes the freekick, hammering it low to the side of the wall. It 
was heading straight for Neueur until Vidal diverted it behind for a corner.

2 min: Now this is promising for Benfica: Kimmich has conceded a freekick just 
outside the D of Bayern’s box. The young defender jumped with Jimenez and 
caught him in the must with a flailing arm. Not deliberate, but not legal.
 
1 min: We have kick-off! Bayern do the honours, and the home crowd whistle 
furiously until they give away possession.
 
Right on cue, the players amble out on the pitch. It’s a bright evening in 
Lisbon, and the Stadium of Light sounds superb, with home fans belting out 
ominous sounding chants. They could be saying “welcome dear German friends” for 
all I know, but itsounds brilliantly threatening. 
 
The Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> eagle swoops across 
the pitch. Whereas ravens herald the arrival of death and pestilence or 
something, this bird merely means the players are about to enter the arena, 
which is a good thing, all told.

In addition to being shorn of their top scorer, Jonas, Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are also without their 
first-choice keeper, Julio Cesar, the excellent midfielder Nicolas Gaitan, and 
the injured Fulham legend Kostas Mitroglou.
 
Two names conspicuous by their absence from the Bayern line-up: Benatia, who 
remained in Germany because he (a) is injured or (b) pithed up at Munich 
airport without his passport (delete depending on whether you believe the 
player or German newspapers); and Lewandowski, whom Guardiola has decided to 
leave on the bench. That’s wealth, folks.

Hello and thanks for coming. Let’s see what we can do here. Previously in this 
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> 
quarter-final Bayern Munich spluttered to a 1-0 home win and Professor Pep 
Guardiola swotted away suggestions that his advanced football beings had looked 
rather ordinary by claiming that Benfica have the best defence in Europe. It 
was tough to square that with the knowledge that Benfica had lost 2-1 in 
Galatasaray earlier in the competition, and drawn 2-2 at Astana of Kazakhstan, 
but that was before the 21-year-old Swede Victor Linderof was introduced to 
Benfica’s defence and, besides, you shouldn’t expect to understand things 
Guardiola says because he talks from a higher plane.


Bayern Munich beat Benfica after Arturo Vidal’s second-minute winner

As if dealing with a superior mind is not hard enough, Benfica are tonight 
also making their latest attempt to banish a supernatural force, namely the 
curse of Bela Guttman. That, as you know, was a heroic Up Yours delivered by 
the Hungarian manager before walking out on his employers in protest at being 
denied a wage rise following victory in the 1962 European Cup final. Benfica 
have failed to win a continental title since then, losing no less than eight 
finals. And in what Guttman might consider as an equally delicious pay-off, the 
financial system is also now aligned againstBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>, which helps explain why this is 
their first quarter-final in Europe’s top competition since 2012 and they have 
not made it to the last four since 1990, when typing abuse at passers-by online 
was the stuff of science fiction and Pluto was a planet. Bayern, by contrast, 
are in their fourth Champions League quarter-final in a row. But they have yet 
to win the competition under their current manager, which does not quite bring 
us into The Curse of Guardiola territory but is a dark mark against the 
Catalan, all the same. Elimination tonight would be unbearable for him, 
particularly with Manuel Pellegrini swilling metaphorical semi-final cocktails 
with Manchester City.

 Almost everything is in Guardiola’s favour tonight, especially as Benfica are 
deprived of their top scorer, with Jonas suspended. But Benfica’s manager, Rui 
Vitoria, who is not the sort to make excuses. He has already proven his ability 
to adapt to adversity by thrusting Renato Sanches into the fray earlier this 
season (the 18-year-old has since established himself as one of the brightest 
young midfielder in Europe) and shrugging off an injury to goalkeeper Julio 
Cesar by giving a debut to Ederson in the quarter-final win over Zenit St 
Petersburg. Vitoria has said his team will play on the counter-attack here, as 
if they have a choice. It’s going to be fun seeing what happens.
