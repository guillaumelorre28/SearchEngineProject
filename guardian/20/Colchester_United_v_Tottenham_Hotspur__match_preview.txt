This tie, pitting Colchester United who are seven points adrift of safety in 
League One against aTottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> side that find 
themselves five from the Premier League summit, is certainly the stuff shocks 
are made of. Colchester can call on experienced heads such as Darren Ambrose, 
Nicky Shorey and Owen Garvan to aid their cause in the clubs’ first competitive 
meeting and a capacity crowd at the Weston Homes Community Stadium will hope 
they can relive past glories.Nick Ames
