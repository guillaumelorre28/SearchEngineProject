Five years ago, the idea that investments in fossil fuel companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/a-beginners-guide-to-fossil-fuel-divestment>
 were morally or financially problematic was all but unheard of. But an 
argument started to take shape on US university campuses — that with more coal, 
oil and gas in existing reserves than can ever be burned while keeping climate 
change under control, it is ethical and economic madness to spend billions 
looking for more.

Fast forward to today and the argument has rocketed into mainstream financial 
thinking. It was revealed on Monday thatinvestors worth more than $5tn have now 
committed to dump their fossil fuel stocks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year>
, and more than 80% of that is professional funds run for profit. Furthermore, 
this risk of a “carbon bubble” is now being taken seriously at the highest 
level, including by the Bank of England, World Bank and the G20’s financial 
stability board.

As Lou Allstadt, a former senior executive at Mobil Oil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil>, puts it: “Divestment is speeding 
up the clock on the final accounting that will show fossil fuels are out and 
clean energy is in.”
