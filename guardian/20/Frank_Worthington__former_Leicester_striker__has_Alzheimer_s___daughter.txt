On her Facebook page, Kim-Malou Worthington wrote: “There have been a few 
wondering about my dad’s health recently and so I thought I should let you all 
know Frank Worthington has Alzheimer’s. He was diagnosed several years ago and 
has been holding it off with positive thinking and football.

“As time goes by, there are moments when you see the effects of Alzheimer’s 
and this is hard sometimes for all those involved with a loved one who has this 
disease. It’s a funny thing that the one big lesson my Dad always taught me was 
‘mind over matter’ … No matter how hard life gets, being positive will pull you 
through, Every adversity is a opportunity for change and growth … Thanks Dad, 
that is the biggest gift you ever gave me!”

Worthington spoke of his pleasure at watching Leicester succeed this season 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season>
. “I still love watching it. That love of the game doesn’t evaporate,” he said. 
“I think romance is a good word for what has happened. They have that ‘oomph’ 
about them and it’s fantastic. It’s brilliant to see them getting one over the 
big clubs.”
