Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> will face Everton in 
the fourth round of the FA Cup after their thrilling penalty shootout win over 
Yeovil.

Mark Ellis stepped up to slot home the winning penalty after Matt Dolan had 
his spot-kick pushed on to the post by the visiting goalkeeper Mark Gillespie.

Yeovil were left to rue a missed penalty by Francois Zoko in added time when 
he fired wide having sent Gillespie the wrong way – the Glovers having 
surrendered the lead when Antony Sweeney cancelled out Jack Compton’s opener.

After a quiet opening 30 minutes Shaun Jeffers played a pass into Liam Walsh, 
who neatly stepped over the ball, leaving it to fall into the path of Compton, 
who rifled past Gillespie.

Carlisle drew level on 77 minutes after Yeovil failed to clear a corner and 
Sweeney scrambled home a header.

A mass brawl then ensued in the aftermath of the goal. Jabo Ibehre joined the 
mêlée and struck Artur Krysiak on the neck but the referee, Tim Robinson, 
showed him only a yellow card.

After 90 minutes extra-time was notable for two dismissals. First the Yeovil 
defender Alex Lacey was shown a straight red card for a lunge on Charlie Wyke, 
then Luke Joyce’s foul on Jeffers earned him a second booking six minutes later.

After Gillespie kept out Jakub Sokolik’s header in the last moments it was 
left to penalties to decide a pulsating tie and, when Dolan, Yeovil’s fifth 
taker, missed, Ellis made no mistake, slamming the winning kick home.
