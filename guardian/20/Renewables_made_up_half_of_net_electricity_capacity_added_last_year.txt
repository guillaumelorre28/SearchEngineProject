Green energy accounted for more than half of net electricity generation 
capacity added around the world last year for the first time, leading energy 
experts have found.


The International Energy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> 
Agency (IEA) said the milestone was evidence of a rapid transformation in 
energy taking place, and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow 
faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years.

But the analysts said the outlook in the UK has deteriorated since the 
Conservative government took power last year andcut support for wind and solar

 power. The agency’s chief said Britain had huge renewable energy potential and 
ministers needed to design stronger policies to exploit it.

“What I see is we are witnessing the transformation of energy system markets 
led by renewables and this is happening very quickly,” said Dr Fatih Birol, 
executive director of the IEA. “This transformation and the growth of 
renewables is led by the emerging countries in the years to come, rather than 
the industrialised countries.”

China will lead the world for growth in renewable power, followed by the US 
and Europe, a new report by the agency found. The IEA said the EU was 
relinquishing its position as a renewable energy pioneer due to weak 
electricity demand and policy uncertainty, which Birol warned could see 
European renewable energy manufacturers lose out to international rivals.

“If you think of running a marathon, Europe started with a big advance, more 
than half of the marathon they are leading by far. They are now getting a bit 
tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely,” he told the 
Guardian.

The IEA said Asia will be the “engine of growth”, led by China and India. 
“China is a completely separate chapter,” said Birol. “China alone is 
responsible for about 40% of growth in the next five years. When people talk 
about China, they think about coal, but it is changing.”

A total of 153GW of net renewable electricity capacity was installed globally 
in 2015, a record high, equivalent to Canada’s capacity and up 15% on the year 
before. Net capacity is new capacity minus retired capacity, such as old hydro 
being taken offline. China is expected to add a further 305GW over the next 
five years, followed by India with 76GW.

Onshore windfarms and solar power led the charge last year, with 63GW and 49GW 
of new global capacity respectively. The two technologies are also forecast to 
take the lion’s share of growth, with electricity generation from solar 
tripling and wind doubling.

Their costs are expected to continue the dramatic and unprecedented reductions 
in recent years, with onshore wind coming down a further 15% and big solar 25% 
by 2021.

“The cost of wind dropped by about one third in the last five to six years, 
and that of solar dropped by 80%,” said Birol, adding that while the cost of 
gas had also fallen recently, it was not at the same speed that green energy 
had become cheaper. “The decline in renewables [cost] was very sharp and in a 
very short period of time. This is unprecedented.”

While renewables now account for more than 50% of net capacity additions and 
are expected by the IEA to reach around 60% by 2021, they still provide a 
relatively small share of the world’s electricity. Green sources are only 
expected to provide 28% of electricity generation by 2021, up from 23% in 2015, 
and much of that will be from existing hydropower dams.

Renewable energy is seen by scores of countries as a key way to meet climate 
targets that they pledged underthe Paris agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points>
, which comes into force in November.

But even with the huge growth expected in coming years, the IEA said it will 
not be sufficient to meet the Paris deal’s target of keeping temperatures below 
2C, the threshold for dangerous warming. “No, it’s by far not enough [the 
trajectory of growth],” said Birol.

The agency painted a gloomy picture of solar and onshore wind’s prospects in 
the UK, echoingrecent warnings from other respected energy authorities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/11/uk-loses-top-10-spot-in-global-energy-ranking-for-the-first-time>
. “The policy landscape for renewables has become more challenging since the 
2015 general election,” the report said.

Since coming to power, the Conservatives have drastically cut or ended 
subsidies for wind and solar power

,begun the privatisation of the green bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/mp-calls-for-green-investment-bank-safeguards-before-privatisation>
 which supports clean energy, and enthusiastically backed fracking for shale 
gas and new nuclear. “While government support for new gas and nuclear capacity 
is evident, recent policy changes indicate that the role envisioned for 
renewables is uncertain,” the IEA said.

“There is need in the UK to invest in stronger renewable policies,” said 
Birol. “The potential is huge compared to what we are expecting.”

The agency’s chief said that contrary to what renewable energy critics argued, 
the biggest threat to the technologies was not their intermittent nature but 
the intermittency of governments’ support.


“The issue is not the predictability of solar and wind, it is the 
predictability of government policies because investors need to see what their 
prospects are. This is the main challenge I see in the renewable energy sector.”

Imke Lübbeke, head of climate and energy at WWF’s European policy office, 
said: “The IEA report clearly shows that president [Jean-Claude] Juncker’s 
promise to make the EU ‘the world leader in renewables’ remains empty rhetoric. 
Instead, the European Union is losing its leadership role to the US and China.”
