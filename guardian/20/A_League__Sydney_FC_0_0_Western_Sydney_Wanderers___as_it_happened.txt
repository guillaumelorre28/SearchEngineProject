Final thoughts

A fair result? Probably. And when the dust settles, neither team will be 
especially unhappy with the way things panned out. Nor will Melbourne Victory 
for that matter.

For the Wanderers, they’ve held the league’s runaway leaders in their own 
backyard and got some measure of respect back for that 4-0 drubbing earlier in 
the season. Can it be a catalyst for a charge up the table into the finals? 
Only if they start finding the back of the net some time in the very near 
future.

For the Sky Blues, they maintain their unbeaten run (both in the league and in 
the derby) and will get a quality new defender in time for next week. It might 
be a little bit concerning for Graham Arnold that they’ve not been quite at 
their best for successive weekends now, but by the same token they’ve still 
managed to pick up four points from six - and as the cliche goes, to be 
champions, you have to pick up points even when you play badly.


Thanks for joining me tonight, I’ll catch you next time.

Full time: Sydney FC 0-0 Western Sydney Wanderers

That’s all she wrote! Honours even. The Wanderers could have edged it in the 
second half but they’ll be happy enough with a point.

now, surely. Ibini whips a ball in but Janjetovic is there, solid as ever, much 
to the Cove’s chagrin.

88 mins: Simon picks up a booking for a late challenge. It’s not a proper 
derby until Matt Simon has seen yellow. Arnold only gave him five minutes but 
he’s still found a way to get in the book. It’s quite a knack.

86 mins: Wanderers create some danger in the Sydney box but there’s far too 
much blue and not enough red in there for it to turn into anything more. They 
end up with a corner, but nothing comes of it. Hamill comes on for Cornthwaite.

85 mins: Parp! Ibini tees up a half volley that sails harmlessly over. Bobo 
comes off for Simon. At least he should make the last five minutes interesting.

83 mins: Sydney now with a free-kick on the left side of the box, about 25 
yards out. Carney whips one in but it’s poor and cleared. Not convincingly 
though and there’s a few nerves as Wanderers throw bodies on the line to keep 
the hosts at bay.

81 mins: No sooner have I said that than the Wanderers create three quick 
half-chances that leave Sydney reeling. Brilliant bit of keeping from Vukovic 
to smother the danger. Both keepers have been fantastic tonight.

80 mins: Who’s got the skill to pinch a winner then? Someone? No one? 
Wanderers have arguably shaded it this half, but I’ve still got that nagging 
feeling thatSydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> might pop 
up with a late winner from somewhere. They’re having that kind of season.

78 mins: Great cut-out tackle from Dimas from a low-cross into the box. I 
think it was Bobo waiting to pounce if he’d missed. Brosque comes off for 
Carney.

76 mins: Aspro cuts out a charge down the right from Ibini after a slightly 
skewed pass makes him check his run. It’s been that kind of night for the Sky 
Blues, the final ball just hasn’t been there.

74 mins: Good work from Vukovic to come rushing out of his area and clear a 
dangerous ball over the top before it can reach Nichols. I’ve said it before 
and I’ll say it again - there’s been nothing between the teams tonight, which 
is a compliment to Wanderers rather thanSydney FC

70 mins: Looks like Ibini is warming up for Sydney. Will he be the difference? 
He’s definitely got the talent to win a game. Interesting images of rubber 
snakes being thrown onto the net behind Janjetovic.He’s getting the full Taylor 
Swift treatment

. The keeper has seen the funny side though. Ibini on, Holosko off.

69 mins: They’re getting closer though! Neville with a screamer under pressure 
from 20 yards, but Vukovic is equal to it - tipping it over for a corner.

68 mins: Clisby with a (let’s be generous) “shot” that flies high and wide

61 mins: Bobo with an attempted scissor kick. It would have looked spectacular 
if it had come off. But it doesn’t. Instead he just sits there on the turf as 
the ball trundles out off his ankle.

59 mins: Against expectation, the Wanderers seem to be getting better this 
half. In fact they’ve been the better team. Sydney still seem to be waiting for 
that forced mistake to present itself further up the pitch.

53 mins: Is anyone else starting to get the feeling that neither side would be 
particularly upset if this one finished all square? There’s not much in the way 
of urgency from either team so far, unless you count the standard “high

50 mins: Well that’s Arnold’s pre-match prediction gone. Nichols with a 
glancing header that forces a sharp stop from Vukovic - his first proper save 
of the game. That’s as dangerous as the Wanderers have looked. They’ve started 
the half well.

48 mins: There’s been a similar feel to the start of the second half as there 
was to the whole of the first - a tussle in the middle as both teams try to 
force an error from the other side. The Wanderers have probed and probed and 
probed but they still can’t find an opening and the attack falls apart as they 
try to play a killer ball and fail.

Second half

46 mins: Away we go. Can the Wanderers keep up the pressure against the 
famously fast-finishing Sydney? We’ll see soon enough. Janjetovic playing just 
in front of the Cove now. Should be interesting....

Looks like I’m on my own with saying that wasn’t a penalty against Zullo in 
the first half. But like all good belligerent pundits, I’m sticking to my guns. 
Did it hit his hand? Yes. Could he have done anything about it? No. It had 
already hit him before he knew what was happening. IMO. It looks worse in 
slow-mo because he’s trying to shield his face as he gets out of the way. Then 
again, as a former defender, I’m bound to say that.

Half-time: Sydney FC 0-0 Western Sydney Wanderers

And there we have it. A couple of good saves have kept Wanderers in it, but 
thenSydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> have had a couple 
of scares themselves. Nothing in it at the minute. Catch you in 15 mins.

44 mins: Well it’s not exactly been fireworks on the pitch (or flares for that 
matter) but the fans are still in fine voice as we approach the break. Can 
Martinez create something with a jinking run? No. No he can’t. Sydney win the 
ball back then get a free-kick close to the halfway line. That could be all she 
wrote.

A fair result? Probably. And when the dust settles, neither team will be 
especially unhappy with the way things panned out. Nor will Melbourne Victory 
for that matter.

For the Wanderers, they’ve held the league’s runaway leaders in their own 
backyard and got some measure of respect back for that 4-0 drubbing earlier in 
the season. Can it be a catalyst for a charge up the table into the finals? 
Only if they start finding the back of the net some time in the very near 
future.

For the Sky Blues, they maintain their unbeaten run (both in the league and in 
the derby) and will get a quality new defender in time for next week. It might 
be a little bit concerning for Graham Arnold that they’ve not been quite at 
their best for successive weekends now, but by the same token they’ve still 
managed to pick up four points from six - and as the cliche goes, to be 
champions, you have to pick up points even when you play badly.


Thanks for joining me tonight, I’ll catch you next time.
 
That’s all she wrote! Honours even. The Wanderers could have edged it in the 
second half but they’ll be happy enough with a point.
 
92 mins: Clisby closes out Ibini for a throw. We must be close to the whistle 
now, surely. Ibini whips a ball in but Janjetovic is there, solid as ever, much 
to the Cove’s chagrin.
 
90 mins: Attendance of 40,143. Not too shabby, just a shame there haven’t been 
any goals... (that’s me deliberately tempting fate by the way)
 
89 mins: Janjetovic dives at the feet of Carney to shut out a Simon pass. The 
keeper just earned himself a few more snakes.
 
88 mins: Simon picks up a booking for a late challenge. It’s not a proper 
derby until Matt Simon has seen yellow. Arnold only gave him five minutes but 
he’s still found a way to get in the book. It’s quite a knack.
 
86 mins: Wanderers create some danger in the Sydney box but there’s far too 
much blue and not enough red in there for it to turn into anything more. They 
end up with a corner, but nothing comes of it. Hamill comes on for Cornthwaite.
 Matt Simon gets into yet another verbal exchange. Photograph: Cameron 
Spencer/Getty Images  
85 mins: Parp! Ibini tees up a half volley that sails harmlessly over. Bobo 
comes off for Simon. At least he should make the last five minutes interesting.
 
83 mins: Sydney now with a free-kick on the left side of the box, about 25 
yards out. Carney whips one in but it’s poor and cleared. Not convincingly 
though and there’s a few nerves as Wanderers throw bodies on the line to keep 
the hosts at bay.
 
81 mins: No sooner have I said that than the Wanderers create three quick 
half-chances that leave Sydney reeling. Brilliant bit of keeping from Vukovic 
to smother the danger. Both keepers have been fantastic tonight.
 
80 mins: Who’s got the skill to pinch a winner then? Someone? No one? 
Wanderers have arguably shaded it this half, but I’ve still got that nagging 
feeling thatSydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> might pop 
up with a late winner from somewhere. They’re having that kind of season.
 
78 mins: Great cut-out tackle from Dimas from a low-cross into the box. I 
think it was Bobo waiting to pounce if he’d missed. Brosque comes off for 
Carney.
 
76 mins: Aspro cuts out a charge down the right from Ibini after a slightly 
skewed pass makes him check his run. It’s been that kind of night for the Sky 
Blues, the final ball just hasn’t been there.
 
74 mins: Good work from Vukovic to come rushing out of his area and clear a 
dangerous ball over the top before it can reach Nichols. I’ve said it before 
and I’ll say it again - there’s been nothing between the teams tonight, which 
is a compliment to Wanderers rather thanSydney FC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc>.
  
70 mins: Looks like Ibini is warming up for Sydney. Will he be the difference? 
He’s definitely got the talent to win a game. Interesting images of rubber 
snakes being thrown onto the net behind Janjetovic.He’s getting the full Taylor 
Swift treatment

. The keeper has seen the funny side though. Ibini on, Holosko off.

69 mins: They’re getting closer though! Neville with a screamer under pressure 
from 20 yards, but Vukovic is equal to it - tipping it over for a corner.
 
68 mins: Clisby with a (let’s be generous) “shot” that flies high and wide 
over the bar. It’s not hard to see why the Wanderers have struggled to find the 
back of the net.
 
66 mins: Bobo takes a first-time shot but he can’t get it past Janjetovic. The 
goalkeeper has kept the boo boys quiet tonight. Well... quieter.
 
64 mins: First sub of the evening - Jumpei on for Scott. Can the Wanderers 
force the issue?

62 mins: Ironic cheers ahoy as Janjetovic slices one out of play. The Cove 
have been waiting for that all night.
 
61 mins: Bobo with an attempted scissor kick. It would have looked spectacular 
if it had come off. But it doesn’t. Instead he just sits there on the turf as 
the ball trundles out off his ankle.
 
59 mins: Against expectation, the Wanderers seem to be getting better this 
half. In fact they’ve been the better team. Sydney still seem to be waiting for 
that forced mistake to present itself further up the pitch.
  
55 mins: Oooo! Sotirio blasts one over the bar from about 20 yards. It never 
really threatened Vukovic but it was still a warning shot for Sydney.
 
53 mins: Is anyone else starting to get the feeling that neither side would be 
particularly upset if this one finished all square? There’s not much in the way 
of urgency from either team so far, unless you count the standard “high 
pressing” game ofSydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc>.
 
50 mins: Well that’s Arnold’s pre-match prediction gone. Nichols with a 
glancing header that forces a sharp stop from Vukovic - his first proper save 
of the game. That’s as dangerous as the Wanderers have looked. They’ve started 
the half well.
 
48 mins: There’s been a similar feel to the start of the second half as there 
was to the whole of the first - a tussle in the middle as both teams try to 
force an error from the other side. The Wanderers have probed and probed and 
probed but they still can’t find an opening and the attack falls apart as they 
try to play a killer ball and fail.
 
46 mins: Away we go. Can the Wanderers keep up the pressure against the 
famously fast-finishing Sydney? We’ll see soon enough. Janjetovic playing just 
in front of the Cove now. Should be interesting....
 
Looks like I’m on my own with saying that wasn’t a penalty against Zullo in 
the first half. But like all good belligerent pundits, I’m sticking to my guns. 
Did it hit his hand? Yes. Could he have done anything about it? No. It had 
already hit him before he knew what was happening. IMO. It looks worse in 
slow-mo because he’s trying to shield his face as he gets out of the way. Then 
again, as a former defender, I’m bound to say that.
 
And there we have it. A couple of good saves have kept Wanderers in it, but 
thenSydney FC <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> have had a couple 
of scares themselves. Nothing in it at the minute. Catch you in 15 mins.
 
44 mins: Well it’s not exactly been fireworks on the pitch (or flares for that 
matter) but the fans are still in fine voice as we approach the break. Can 
Martinez create something with a jinking run? No. No he can’t. Sydney win the 
ball back then get a free-kick close to the halfway line. That could be all she 
wrote.
