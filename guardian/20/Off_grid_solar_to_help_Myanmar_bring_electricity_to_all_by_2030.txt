Four feet in length, of aggressive disposition, and deadly poisonous: you 
don’t want to stand on a Russell’s viper in the dark. Especially if there’s no 
antivenom for miles around. Yet that’s the daily predicament facing millions of 
villagers in Myanmar, where snakebites cause about500 deaths every year 
<http://www.burmasnakeproject.org/pages/significance.php>. 

In Yin Ma Chaung, a rural settlement about nine hours by car from Yangon, 
villagers can rest easier knowing there are doses of antivenom chilling 
securely in a new refrigerator in the village’s community centre, powered by 
solar.

“Antivenom can now be supplied quickly if people in neighbouring villages need 
it,” says Konosuke Kawahara from Japanese electronics giant Panasonic, which 
recently installed a 2.82kW photovoltaic (PV) system for the off-grid village.

The example is just one of thousands of off-grid projects being rolled out 
across Myanmar as part of a huge government-led scheme, which involves private 
companies too, to bring electricity to the entire country by 2030. As of 2014, 
only16% 
<http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/09/16/electricity-to-transform-rural-myanmar>
 of rural households had an electricity connection.

Myanmar Eco Solutions <http://myanmarecosolutions.com/>, a for-profit 
renewable energy firm, is part of a burgeoning industry looking to contribute 
to the development of off-grid solutions. It recently set up a solar-powered 
irrigation system for rice farmers near Pathein, a remote agricultural region 
in the Ayeyarwady delta in southern Myanmar. The submersible pump is mounted on 
a raft, meaning it can travel up and down the river supporting multiple 
villages.

Sunlabob <http://www.sunlabob.com/>, a Laos-based solar developer, has just 
installed solar mini-grids in 11 villages in the remote provinces of Shan and 
Chin. The PV-based systems enable householders to power low-voltage electrical 
items such as lights, mobile phones and small televisions.

Can off-grid make profits?

At present, almost all Myanmar’s off-grid projects are either 
government-funded or donor-backed. Panasonic’s fridge-powering power system is 
financed through charity money from Mitsui & Co;Myanmar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar> Eco Solutions’ raft is seed-funded 
by the non-profit World View International; and Sunlabob has a grant from the 
Japanese government for its mini-grid project.

Poverty levels are the most immediate hurdle to off-grid commercialisation. 
Despite enviablegrowth rates over recent years 
<http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/myanmar/overview>, Myanmar is starting 
from a very low base. It still ranks 148th of 188 countries on the UN’s 
benchmark development index, with the highest levels of poverty concentrated in 
rural areas.

“Our original idea was to supply solar home systems because they are 
relatively affordable,” says Ben Frederick, head of operations for Myanmar Eco 
Solutions. “But it quickly became apparent that this business model wouldn’t 
work … Even though the systems we were selling were about $100 [£80], they were 
still far too expensive for a single farmer to buy.”

Myanmar Eco Solutions’s strategy has been twofold. In the case of the raft 
project, it operates a revolving fund, with participating farmers making small 
payments on a seasonal basis. The capital costs of the raft, around $6,000 
(£4,800), should be paid back after two years or so, enabling the company to 
set up a similar project elsewhere.

Commercial Opportunities

Myanmar’s lack of electrification presents a puzzling dilemma for commercial 
operators. With so many of the rural population having no electricity at all, 
it is difficult to judge future demand patterns, feasible price points and the 
reliability of billing systems.

“It’s tricky from a commercial perspective because you can’t go to a lender or 
a financier and say, ‘Yes, we can prove this is the level of demand and this is 
the price point people are able to meet,” says Philip Napier-Moore, programme 
director for solar power in Asia Pacific for the engineering consultancy Mott 
MacDonald.

The real money for Myanmar’s solar firms lies in providing PV-systems for 
factories, hotels and other large-scale industrial users in urban areas. 
Myanmar Eco Solutions, for example, is about to integrate a 1MW solar plant 
into an existing diesel power station on an island in the country’s Tanintharyi 
region. Sunlabob, meanwhile, is installing a 117kW solar system in Junction 
City, a mall and office complex in Yangon. The project is set to be thefirst 
grid-connected 
<http://www.sunlabob.com/news-2016/junction-city-to-feature-myanmars-first-grid-connected-solar-pv-system.html>
 solar project in Myanmar.

“Businesses and larger energy users are beginning to see the benefit of 
investing in solar-based electricity given the rising prices of grid-based 
electricity paired with the high cost of back-up diesel generators,” says Evan 
Scandling, Sunlabob’s managing director in Myanmar.

Given the demand hurdles, Napier-Moore anticipates Myanmar’s off-grid solar 
roll-out remaining largely government-led over the coming years. But a 
commercial model may provide a better guarantee of it working in the long-term, 
for example with a corresponding growth in a support network of suppliers and 
engineers.

“Ideally, government-backed initiatives could harness private-sector models so 
that it helps to demonstrate to financiers that these models are viable rather 
than being just purely grant-funded,” he adds.
