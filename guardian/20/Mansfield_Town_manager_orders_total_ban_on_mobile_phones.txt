 at Manchester City’s training centre but Murray has gone a step further by 
confiscating any devices while players are at the club.

Murray told BBC Radio Nottingham mobile phones were a menace in all walks of 
life. “It’s a society thing,” he said. “I don’t like the amount of time people 
spend on their phones around the club.”

Murray has already gained media interest after he issued an edict to ensure 
his players learned how to wash their hands to cut down on illness.

He is convinced improving communication off the pitch will help the players on 
it. “They don’t talk and then they expect to go into an environment where you 
have to talk and it will just happen,” he said. “I think all of us, we’re all 
guilty. We get lost in this technology world now and we forget the actual core 
values of human beings.

“We had a ban on phones in certain times anyway – players weren’t allowed to 
be on their phones because they have to talk to each other. Instead of it just 
being in certain times, now we’ve put a complete stop on it.”
