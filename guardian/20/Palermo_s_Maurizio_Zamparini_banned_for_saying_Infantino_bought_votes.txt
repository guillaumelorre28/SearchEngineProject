Palermo’s president, Maurizio Zamparini, has been fined the equivalent of 
£14,000 and suspended for suggesting the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, 
bought the votes that led to his election in February.

The outspoken Zamparini, who took charge of Palermo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> in 2002, alleged that the 
Swiss-born Infantino had only been victorious “because he bought more votes 
than the Sheikh”, adding: “I hope they suspend me for having said that. It 
would be an honour for me.”

The 75-year-old was granted his wish on Friday, with an Italian Football 
Federation statement saying: “The national federal tribunal, chaired by the 
lawyer Sergio Artico, sanctioned the Palermo president, Maurizio Zamparini, 
with a 20-day suspension and a fine of €18,000,” read a statement.

“The Sicilian club was also fined €18,000. Zamparini had already been banned 
for some remarks that were offensive to Fifa president Gianni Infantino.”
