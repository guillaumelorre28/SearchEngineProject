A row has blown up over plans for a motor racing circuit in Wales, with 
Silverstone <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/silverstone> claiming it could 
be being funded by illegal state aid.

Silverstone Circuits Limited has written to the Prime Minister asking for 
clarification of financial support for the Ebbw Vale Circuit of Wales project.

There have been reports that public money could be put into the circuit, 
possibly via the Welsh Assembly. However, a statement from Silverstone said its 
bid for financial support to secure the future of Formula One'sBritish Grand 
Prix <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-grand-prix> was denied on the 
basis that this would be classed as illegal state aid.

"Silverstone has been advised that an injection of funds by the Welsh and/or 
UK governments to the Circuit of Wales project could also amount to illegal 
state aid, as a transfer of state resources would give Circuit of Wales an 
economic and selective advantage over other circuits [and developments]," said 
the statement.

"There are currently a number of well established, privately funded circuits 
in the UK, including Wales, that feel that the British motor sport industry 
would be threatened by the addition of a government-funded circuit.

"Silverstone has no objection to competition between UK circuits, but it has 
to be a level playing field.

"Silverstone reiterates that it is sympathetic to the economic situation in 
Ebbw Vale, but motor sport at circuit level is not particularly profitable and 
is often loss making. Many UK circuits are under-utilised and struggle for 
revenue. It is unrealistic to suggest Circuit of Wales will be the exception."
