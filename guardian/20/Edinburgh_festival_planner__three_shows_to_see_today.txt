Eurohouse

10.05am Summerhall <https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/eurohouse> (until 26 
August)

One of those quirky and rewarding shows that the fringe sometimes throws up, 
this collaboration between Nasi Voutsas and Bertrand Lesca investigates how the 
dream of the EU and the reality – particularly for austerity hit Greece – don’t 
match up. Childlike but never childish, it’s enacted a bit like a playground 
scrap in which packets of sweets are given then demanded back, and the Greek 
Voutsas gets reduced to his underpants. It’s a playful and thoughtful work that 
makes light work of the ongoing Greek tragedy but proves enormously moving, too.

 Subversive cabaret … Hot Brown Honey. 
“Fighting the power has never tasted so sweet,” is the call-out in this show, 
which is creating a real buzz with its raucous but oddly effective mix of 
hip-hop and variety acts, laced with a strong political message calling out 
sexism, racism and colonialism. Part of a new wave of politically aware and 
subversive cabaret, it has such a naughty satiric edge and infectious energy 
that the message just slips down. Surprising and wildly entertaining.LG

 Wall of silly … the Pretend Men’s Police Cops. Photograph: Will Hazel 
Last year, the Pretend Men’s award-winning Police Cops appeared on the fringe 
listed under theatre, and made a justifiable splash for its high-octane, lo-fi, 
wall-of-silly spoof of US police drama conventions. After a sell-out run at the 
Soho theatre, London, it’s now back branded as comedy, and will delight anyone 
looking for big, consistent laughs. As the trio (Nathan Parkinson, Zachary 
Hunt, Tom Turner) flit hyperactively between their vast cast of naive rookies, 
Mexican drug lords and jaded cops coaxed back from retirement, it’s not just 
funny, it’s exhilarating.BL
