Doncaster Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/doncaster> have 
appointed Darren Ferguson as their manager in succession to Paul Dickov.

A statement on the club’s website read 
<http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/news/article/-welcome-darren-ferguson-2745705.aspx>
: “Doncaster Rovers football club are delighted to announce the appointment of 
Darren Ferguson as first-team manager.

“Ferguson has previously managed Preston North End and Peterborough United 
where he achieved back-to-back promotions from League Two to the Championship 
including an automatic promotion in 2009.

“Ferguson joins Rovers with an outstanding win ratio of 42% which is sure to 
excite the home faithful.”

Rovers, who play their fellow League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> strugglers Bradford on 
Saturday, had been searching for a manager since Dickov was sacked in early 
September, with Rob Jones having stepped in as caretaker.

Fergsuon said of Jones: “I had a good chat with him last night. He’s a top pro 
and I’ll expect that to stay the same – he’ll remain Under-21s coach.”

The 43-year-old added: “I’m delighted to be here, it’s an exciting challenge. 
It’s a sound football club and my aims match those of the board. Being out for 
six months gives you time to reflect, learn and take that in to your next job. 
League One is anyone’s.”

Doncaster won just once in six games under Jones, leaving Ferguson tasked with 
steering the club up from 20th in the table. He has been out of worksince 
parting company with Peterborough
