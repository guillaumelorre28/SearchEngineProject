Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> missed 
the chance to go top of La Liga on Saturday after they slumped to a 2-0 defeat 
at Real Sociedad, with Carlos Vela scoring one penalty and winning another.

The defeat left Atlético third on 21 points from 11 games, three adrift of the 
leaders Real Madrid and one behind the champions Barcelona, who both have a 
game in hand.

Sociedad, who celebrated their first La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> win against Atlético 
since November 2014, are sixth with 19 points from 11 matches.

The home side dominated from the start but Atlético missed the best chance of 
the first half when Kevin Gameiro raced clear and hit the post with a dinked 
shot over the Sociedad goalkeeper, Geronimo Rulli.

The former Arsenal forward Vela was lively on the right flank and fired 
Sociedad ahead when he calmly slotted home a 54th-minute penalty after 
Atlético’s captain, Gabi, tripped Sociedad’s left-back Yuri Berchiche.

Vela’s jinking run produced a second spot kick in the 75th minute after he was 
brought down by Atlético substitute Angel Correa, with the Brazilian striker 
Willian Jose blasting his shot past Atlético’s goalkeeper, Jan Oblak.

Antoine Griezmann, who scored Atlético’s stoppage-time winner in a 2-1 defeat 
of Rostov in Tuesday’s Champions League game, saw his close-range shot cleared 
off the line in the closing stages as the weary-looking visitors went down 
tamely.
