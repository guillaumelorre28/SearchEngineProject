Kyle Lafferty has also been talking about Northern Ireland’s big win:

We knew it was going to be difficult. They’re a team that sits in and lets us 
have plenty of the ball, but we got an early goal and forced them to come out 
and play. I think it was a proper Northern Ireland performance. Six, seven 
years ago this was a game we’d struggle in, but the last four, five years we’ve 
been winning these games. I think everyone wants to play for Michael O’Neill 
and that’s important, and it’s good for him that he’s got 16, 17 players that 
want to sweat blood for him.

We’ve worked on set pieces all week. We knew Josh had a long throw-in and I 
finally got in there and got the goal, and what we’ve worked on all week has 
paid off.

Chris Brunt has had a quick chat about Northern Ireland’s evening:

It was a good performance. We knew we were going to have to work pretty hard. 
For periods in the second half they had a lot of the ball, but we were 
dangerous when we got the ball forwards, and got what we deserved. It wasn’t a 
great start for me, getting smashed in the head, but I enjoyed the game 
tonight. It was a good win, I was delighted to be a part of it and hopefully 
we’ll kick on.

Northern Ireland have a 4-0 lead over Azerbaijan! And it’s Chris Brunt who, 
from just outside the left-hand corner of the penalty area sends the ball low 
and hard across goal and in at the far post! A goal from open play, of all 
things!

Northern Ireland 3-0 Azerbaijan! That’s game, set and match for the Northern 
Irish, and semi-inevitably it’s from another set piece. A corner from the right 
this time, and McLaughlin meets it at the near post, and from following his 
eyes after he makes contact I don’t think it went where he wanted it to go at 
all – I think he was trying to angle it across goal – but that doesn’t matter 
much, as it flew absolutely perfectly into the top corner at the near post!

Goal for France! And their nightmare night is looking sunnier now! It should 
have been disallowed, mind. It’s a cross from the right towards Griezmann, who 
was half a yard offside. The keeper comes, runs into Griezmann, fumbles the 
ball and Payet turns it in!

Another good chance for Azerbaijan in Northern Ireland and it falls to 
Dashderimov, who takes a touch on the edge of the area, opening up space for 
the shot, but then spoons it over the bar with his unfavoured right peg!

And France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> equalise within two 
minutes! It’s another free kick, this time from the left wing, and it’s crossed 
by Payet and comes I think off Pogba on its way into the net! 1-1!
 France’s Paul Pogba heads in to score the equaliser against Sweden.

Goal in France! And Sweden have it! They won a free kick, 25 yards out or so, 
Forsberg takes it and the ball flies straight to the spot that Lloris should 
really have been occupying if he hadn’t headed off in the other direction for 
little obvious reason!

Great save from McGovern! Azerbaijan’s first proper chance of the game ends in 
frustration as Yilmaz’s effort is saved.

An email from Phil Withall. “Kyle Lafferty has scored 9 goals for Northern 
Ireland as a Norwich player,” he notes. “He’s scored once for Norwich in the 
same period. I may not be the only one to find this statistic slightly odd.” It 
is indeed unusual, though at this rate Daniel Sturridge will soon be a 
specialist international striker as well.

Goal for Northern Ireland! Again it comes from a set piece: Chris Brunt’s 
delivery from the right-wing free kick was superb, and McAuley heads in at the 
far post!

Northern Ireland are absolutely dominating their game. There haven’t been a

Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> have been made to wait 
for goal No3, but the wait is over, as Jonas Hector’s run from deep isn’t 
tracked, he’s picked out by a short pass and pokes into the corner from 15

Kyle Lafferty has also been talking about Northern Ireland’s big win:

We knew it was going to be difficult. They’re a team that sits in and lets us 
have plenty of the ball, but we got an early goal and forced them to come out 
and play. I think it was a proper Northern Ireland performance. Six, seven 
years ago this was a game we’d struggle in, but the last four, five years we’ve 
been winning these games. I think everyone wants to play for Michael O’Neill 
and that’s important, and it’s good for him that he’s got 16, 17 players that 
want to sweat blood for him.

We’ve worked on set pieces all week. We knew Josh had a long throw-in and I 
finally got in there and got the goal, and what we’ve worked on all week has 
paid off.

Chris Brunt has had a quick chat about Northern Ireland’s evening:

It was a good performance. We knew we were going to have to work pretty hard. 
For periods in the second half they had a lot of the ball, but we were 
dangerous when we got the ball forwards, and got what we deserved. It wasn’t a 
great start for me, getting smashed in the head, but I enjoyed the game 
tonight. It was a good win, I was delighted to be a part of it and hopefully 
we’ll kick on.
 
And it’s all over in Belfast, where Northern Ireland have beaten Azerbaijan 4-0
 to record a sixth successive home win for the first time in all of history!

this time, and McLaughlin meets it at the near post, and from following his 
eyes after he makes contact I don’t think it went where he wanted it to go at 
all – I think he was trying to angle it across goal – but that doesn’t matter 
much, as it flew absolutely perfectly into the top corner at the near post!
 
And Jonas Hector has put Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>
 5-0 up. I’m not sure San Marino are going to come back from this.

Goal for France! And their nightmare night is looking sunnier now! It should 
have been disallowed, mind. It’s a cross from the right towards Griezmann, who 
was half a yard offside. The keeper comes, runs into Griezmann, fumbles the 
ball and Payet turns it in!

Another good chance for Azerbaijan in Northern Ireland and it falls to 
Dashderimov, who takes a touch on the edge of the area, opening up space for 
the shot, but then spoons it over the bar with his unfavoured right peg!
 
Goal! England lead Scotland 3-0, Gary Cahill heading in Rooney’s corner, and 
Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> are 4-0 up in San 
Marino, Gnabry scoring from a Kimmich cross.
 
The Romania v Poland game was stopped for a while as fans threw flares onto

Game back on. Almost 10 minutes of interruption in Romania's best moment of 
the game...

And France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> equalise within two 
minutes! It’s another free kick, this time from the left wing, and it’s crossed 
by Payet and comes I think off Pogba on its way into the net! 1-1!

Goal in France! And Sweden have it! They won a free kick, 25 yards out or so, 
Forsberg takes it and the ball flies straight to the spot that Lloris should 
really have been occupying if he hadn’t headed off in the other direction for 
little obvious reason!
 
Great save from McGovern! Azerbaijan’s first proper chance of the game ends in 
frustration as Yilmaz’s effort is saved.
 
Two more second-half goals: Benjamin Verbic has given Slovenia a 1-0 lead in 
Malta, and Jaromir Zmrhal has put the Czechs 2-0 up at home to Norway.
 
And England run down the other end and score! Sterling runs down the left and 
tees up an overlapping Rose, whose cross is headed in by an unmarked Lallana!
 
Scotland miss a fabulous chance moments into the second half, James Forrest 
shooting wide, and then moments later a Snodgrass shot from an excellent 
position is blocked by Stones.
 
The players are back out (except in Belfast). More action on its way!
 
An email from Phil Withall. “Kyle Lafferty has scored 9 goals for Northern 
Ireland as a Norwich player,” he notes. “He’s scored once for Norwich in the 
same period. I may not be the only one to find this statistic slightly odd.” It 
is indeed unusual, though at this rate Daniel Sturridge will soon be a 
specialist international striker as well.
 
And the half-time whistle has now gone in Belfast, thanks to that Chris Brunt 
injury the last of the games to end. I’ll be back shortly for half two.
 
Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> have another goal 
disallowed for offside, Mario Gomez the disappointed goalscorer this time, but 
there was no doubt about that one. It’s now half time in San Marino.
 
“Giroud is running about with all the poise of a Guardsman who’s lost his 
horse but I don’t think he’s actually touched a ball yet,” reports Charles 
Antaki, who’s watching the action at the Stade deFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, where the score remains goalless.

Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> have put the ball in 
the back of the net again, but this time Müller’s strike was disallowed for 
offside, which he seemed pretty unhappy about.
 
Goal for Northern Ireland! Again it comes from a set piece: Chris Brunt’s 
delivery from the right-wing free kick was superb, and McAuley heads in at the 
far post!
 
Double goalflash! The 36th minute have broad goals in Denmark, where Christian 
Eriksen’s penalty has put the home side 2-1 up against Kazakhstan, and in 
Slovakia, where Martin Skrtel has given the hosts a 3-0 lead.
 
Northern Ireland are absolutely dominating their game. There haven’t been a 
lot of clear chances, but they’re attacking pretty remorselessly.
 
Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> have been made to wait 
for goal No3, but the wait is over, as Jonas Hector’s run from deep isn’t 
tracked, he’s picked out by a short pass and pokes into the corner from 15 
yards.
