High summer, and the point in the cook’s year when the kitchen can relax a 
little. There is a need for dishes that are better eaten warm than hot; a 
dessert that can be made the day before, and drinks just as suited to Sunday 
breakfast as they are to Sunday lunch, all using the summer’s best ingredients.

So here we have it, a shellfish tart just as good whether it is eaten warm or 
cool; the weekend roast turned into a big, cherry-flecked salad; a jelly 
shimmering with ripe peaches and a fruit drink to which you can add gin or 
vodka as the mood takes you. Easy, good-natured food for the dog days of summer.

Asparagus and prawn tart

It is worth taking time to line the tart tin carefully, pushing the pastry 
firmly into the edges of the tin and up the sides, then chilling thoroughly so 
your pastry case doesn’t shrink in the tin as it cooks. You could risk doing 
the initial baking without, but I prefer to line the tart case with paper and 
baking beans, which will reduce the possibility of the edges collapsing. (I 
used a batch of old coffee beans I didn’t like, but rice or dried beans will do 
the trick.) If the edges shrink or collapse you are pretty much sunk.


For the pastry
butter 90g
plain flour 175g
egg yolk 1

For the filling
asparagus 250g
spring onions 2
olive oil 2 tbsp
eggs 2
double cream 250ml
creme fraiche 125g
chives 2 tbsp, snipped
tarragon leaves 1 tbsp
cooked prawns 180g, shelled

You will need a 24cm tart tin with a removable base.

Make the pastry: put the butter and flour in a food processor and blitz to the 
texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Blend in the egg yolk and 2-3 tablespoons of 
water until you have a soft dough, then scrape out onto a heavily floured 
board. Knead the pastry for a minute, no longer, then form it into a ball and 
roll out to fit the tart case.

Lift the pastry, with the help of the rolling pin, into the tart case, pushing 
the dough into the corners and up the sides of the tin. Chill in the fridge for 
30 minutes. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 and place a baking sheet inside.

Put a saucepan of water on to boil. Trim the asparagus of any tough stalk ends 
then cut each spear into short pieces, 2-3cm in length. I like to leave the 
points a little longer. When the water is boiling, add the asparagus and cook 
for 3 or 4 minutes until approaching tendrness. Drain and set aside. Thinly 
slice the spring onions, then fry them in the olive oil for two or three 
minutes until they soften.

In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, cream and creme fraiche then stir in the 
softened onions, the chives and tarragon leaves. Season with salt and pepper.

Fill the pastry case with baking parchment weighed down with baking beans or 
rice pushing well into the corners. Bake the pastry case on the heated baking 
sheet, for 25-30 minutes till pale gold, carefully remove the paper and beans 
then return to the oven for five minutes until dry to the touch. Remove the 
tart case from the oven and lower the heat to 180C/gas mark 4.

Put the asparagus and prawns into the pastry case then pour in the herb 
custard. Carefully carry to the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the filling 
has set but still quivers when gently shaken. Serve warm, not hot.

 The hot dressing made with the roasting juices and tiny cornichons softens 
the salad leaves as you toss everything together. Little gem lettuces, spinach 
and watercress will work well here.

chicken 1 whole, about 2.4kg
olive oil
thyme 12 sprigs
cherries 400g
cornichons 20
salad leaves 200g
lemon juice of 1
parsley 2 tbsp, chopped

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Spatchcock the chicken or ask your butcher to 
do it for you. (Using a very sharp, heavy cook’s knife cut the chicken through 
the backbone, and open it flat, like a book.) Place the bird skin-side up in a 
roasting tin and rub all over with olive oil, salt and black pepper.


Scatter and tuck the thyme sprigs over the chicken and roast for one hour in 
the preheated oven till golden.

Halve and stone the cherries. Halve the cornichons lengthways. While the 
chicken is warm, tear the flesh apart into large pieces and place on a serving 
dish. Wash and dry the salad leaves and toss them with the chicken pieces and 
cherries.

Pour most of the fat from the roasting tin, holding back the darker meat 
juices underneath. Place the roasting tin over a moderate heat, pour in the 
lemon juice then add the chopped parsley and cornichons. Scrape away at any 
crusty golden bits in the tin with a wooden spoon and stir them into the 
bubbling juices. Pour over the salad and toss gently together. Serve 
immediately. Once dressed, it will not wait.

The rosemary butter brushed between the layers of filo is what makes this 
worth the trouble. Brush it on generously between each leaf of pastry. The 
crisp beans are there as a contrast to the soft, sweet-sharp tomato.

butter 80g
rosemary needles 1 tbsp
garlic 1 clove
tomatoes 1kg, mixed sizes and varieties
filo pastry sheets 200g
black stoned olives about 14
olive oil 2 tbsp
French beans 100g

Melt the butter in a small pan. Finely chop the rosemary and finely crush the 
garlic and stir in to the melted butter then set aside. Set the oven at 
220C/gas mark 7.


Thinly slice the larger tomatoes. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Line a baking 
sheet with parchment. Place a sheet of the pastry on the baking sheet and brush 
it with some of the rosemary and garlic butter, then place another on top and 
brush it likewise. Be generous. Continue until you have used every sheet, 
finishing with a layer of butter.

Place the tomatoes over the pastry in a single layer. Then dot with the 
olives, trickle with olive oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, checking regularly 
and removing when the pastry is crisp. While the tart is cooking, boil the 
beans, topped and tailed, for 4 minutes in deep, lightly salted water, then 
drain.

As soon as the tart is ready, remove it from the oven, place the crisp, cooked 
French beans on top and cut it into large squares.

I have used frozen orange slices to cool the drink down. Ice cubes will do 
fine if you haven’t time to let the fruit freeze. You may fancy a splash of 
vodka in these, if that’s your thing.

oranges 3
raspberries 125g
watermelon 1kg, skin -on weight
mint leaves 12

Slice one of the oranges in half and then cut each half into 3 segments, place 
on a frost-proof tray or in a plastic container and then in the deep freeze. 
Leave for a couple of hours.

Put the raspberries in the jug of an electric blender. Remove the skin from 
the watermelon, discard, then slice the flesh into large chunks picking out the 
seeds as you go. Add the watermelon to the raspberries together with the juice 
of the remaining oranges.

Process until smooth, adding chilled mineral water if the consistency seems 
too thick. Pour into glasses, add a frozen orange slice to each and a mint leaf 
or two.

 Part of the beauty of these softly set jellies lies in the rose pink colour 
created by the juice that seeps from the cherries. I suggest you make the most 
of this by setting the jellies in white or glass dishes, or long-stemmed wine 
glasses.

leaf gelatine 12g (6 sheets)
water 350ml
elderflower cordial 150ml
white peaches 350g
cherries 150g
dried rose petals a pinch

Soak the leaves of gelatine in a bowl of cold water for a few minutes until 
they become soft and spongy. Warm (don’t boil) the water and elderflower 
cordial in a small saucepan, remove from the heat then stir in the softened 
gelatine until it has dissolved.

Cut the peaches in half and remove their stones, then thinly slice the fruit. 
Halve and stone the cherries. Divide the fruit between six small bowls then add 
a small pinch of dried rose petals to each.

Pour the liquid over the fruit then refrigerate for four or five hours till 
just set.
