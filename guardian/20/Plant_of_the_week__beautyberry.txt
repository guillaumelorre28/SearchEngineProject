What is it? Outside its peak season, the beautyberry (aka callicarpa) is an 
unremarkable – OK, boring – hardy deciduous shrub. But in late autumn and 
winter it puts on a show of what Monty Don has called “the most astonishing 
berries in the whole of the plant world”. They persist long after the leaves 
have fallen, shining like clusters of amethysts throughout winter until the 
birds eat them.

Any good varieties? Callicarpa bodinieri var. giraldii ‘Profusion’ is widely 
available in UK nurseries. If you’re anti-purple,C. japonica ‘Leucocarpa’ 
sports ivory berries. Both reach roughly 3m x 2.5m.

Plant it with? Inject some drama by pairing with red or purple dogwood stems, 
or even red or orange pyracantha berries. The white and purple callicarpas look 
good planted together, too.

And where? Sun or partial shade, most soils. It’s not fussy.

Any drawbacks? The aforementioned lack of interest in spring and summer.

What else can it do? The berried branches can be cut and brought indoors for a 
jolt of colour.
