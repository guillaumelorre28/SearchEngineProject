1. Woolf Works: Royal Ballet
Royal Opera House, London

The exquisitely verbal art and life of Virginia Woolf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf> was an unlikely source for a 
new ballet by Wayne McGregor. As a choreographer, his sensibility is so speedy, 
so physical, so entirely 21st-century, that he and Woolf might have come from 
different planets. Yet some chemistry sparked between them and made Woolf Works 
the most surprising, exhilarating piece of dance I saw all year.


Who’s afraid of Virginia Woolf? Not the Royal Ballet

It was more of a triptych than a written-through ballet, each of its three acts
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/12/royal-ballet-woolf-works-five-star-review-wayne-mcgregor>
 freely inspired by a different novel and each taking a different stylistic 
route into the writing. The first Mrs Dalloway act was the most 
narrative-based, shifting between the novel’s parallel stories of Clarissa 
Dalloway, the uncertain, middle-aged hostess, and Septimus Smith, the 
shell-shocked war veteran. McGregor’s own choreography was exemplary in its 
tender humanity and simplicity – implying but never forcing its themes of love, 
memory and madness.

By contrast, the Orlando act was a blast of hi-tech, time-bending fantasy. 
Laser beams dissected the stage as 12 hyperkinetic dancers embodied the 
stylistic rush of the novel’s prose, and its narrative conceit of a 
time-travelling love affair. The Waves act was both simpler and more daring, 
with life and death evoked in a flood of movement that imagined the moment in 
which Woolf’s own life flashed through her mind when she drowned herself in the 
River Ouse in 1941.

Dancing the role of Woolf was the 52-year-old ballerina Alessandra Ferri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/28/alessandra-ferri-52-out-dance-woolf-works>
, luminously expressive, and the work’s essential centre of gravity. The other 
star was lighting designer Lucy Carter, whose shifts of atmosphere and colour 
perfectly mirrored Woolf’s own obsession with capturing the ways in which light 
falls on people, objects and places.

Woolf Works divided its audience. For some it was too disjointed, too odd, too 
egregiously McGregor-like. But for me it was a pure head rush – a work that 
inspired me to rethink and reread Woolf (whose writing I’ve loved for decades) 
and left me elated all over again by what ballet as an art form can do.Read the

It was typical of Guillem’s integrity that, when she danced her farewell tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/22/sylvie-guillem-interview-dance-nureyev>
 this year, the 50-year-old ballerina opted for a programme of new and 
contemporary works rather than a showcase of nostalgic career highlights. Even 
if the two contributions from Akram Khan and Russell Maliphant were of patchy 
quality, Guillem’s dancing, and her ferocity of concentration, were as 
revelatory as always. One of the world’s truly great performers bowed out at 
the peak of her astonishing powers.Read the full review

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian 
Within the globalised culture of ballet, the Danes 
<https://kglteater.dk/en/about-us/arts/the-royal-danish-ballet/> have been 
remarkable in keeping faith with the style that was laid down for them by the 
great 19th-century ballet master August Bournonville. We don’t see the company 
often enough in Britain, but this programme of short classical extracts was a 
masterclass in buoyant, beautiful dancing: the dancers’ fine feathered 
footwork, effortless jumps, delicateépaulement and joyfully democratic stage 
manners presenting style as the beating heart of their art form.Read the full

Kally Lloyd-Jones’s impeccably researched and hauntingly performed life of 
Vaslav Nijinksy was one of the gems of this year’s Edinburgh fringe. The story 
of ballet’s crazed, broken genius has been re-enacted many times and in many 
forms, but Lloyd-Jones made a marvellous virtue of her own modest resources, 
using dancer Darren Brownlie and actor James Bryce to stage a tender, humane 
meditation on age and youth, madness and reality, genius and delusion.Read the

 Ben Duke in Paradise Lost. Photograph: Zoe Manders 
Ben Duke might have been accused of hubris in his attempt to reduce Paradise 
Lost to 80 minutes of solo dance theatre, but the result was far more subtle 
and funny than a simple romp through Milton. Duke turned the epic poem into 
series of contemporary dialogues between God, Lucifer, Adam and Eve, and by 
interweaving them with stories of his own struggles as both dance artist and 
parent, he constructed a ridiculous, incisive and wonderfully entertaining 
meditation on the battles and joys of creation.Read the full review

Stories of war were unusually current on the dance stage in the months 
following the centenary of the first world war. ButRosie Kay 
<http://rosiekay.co.uk/work/5-soldiers-the-body-is-the-frontline/>’s 5 Soldiers 
was in a class of its own, a work that aimed to get inside the minds and bodies 
of soldiers fighting now, and to understand what it means to train every day to 
kill or be killed. This piece flew on the strength of its meticulous research, 
on the fierce physical accuracy of its performances, and on Kay’s remarkable 
ability to square up to a difficult subject without polemic or sentimentality.

Matthew Bourne’s update of Bizet’s Carmen to a drama of love, lust, and 
revenge in small-town America got a well-deserved revival this year. As with 
all Bourne’s productions, the material had been tinkered with, and the dancing 
looked bigger and brassier than it had the first time around. But the powerful, 
emotive story and the big, vivid characters were all intact, and wonderfully 
performed by a new generation of dancers including Liam Mower as the 
vulnerable, volatile Angelo and Chris Trenfield as the charismatic Luca. 
Tragically, though, this revival was also marked by the loss of another of its 
leads,Jonathan Ollivier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/10/jonathan-ollivier>, a superb 
dance actor who was killed in a hideous road accident.Read the full review

 May B by Compagnie Maguy Marin at Enniskillen’s Happy Days festival. 
Photograph: Hervee Deroo 
Maguy Marin was a young and unknown choreographer when she wrote to Samuel 
Beckett <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett> in 1981 asking for 
permission to adapt his work for the dance stage. The result was May B, a work 
that paid scrupulous, painful and oddly uplifting homage to Beckett’s absurdist 
world. Evolving from minimalist abstraction to blackly comic vignettes of human 
tenderness and survival, the work was revived at the BeckettHappy Days festival
