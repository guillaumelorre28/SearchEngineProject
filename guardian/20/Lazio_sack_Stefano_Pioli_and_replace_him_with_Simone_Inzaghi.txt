Lazio announced the move late on Sunday after the defeat to their bitter city 
rivals left them in eighth place inSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> and unlikely to qualify 
for European competition.

Pioli led Lazio to third place last season but this campaign began poorly with 
defeat to Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/27/champions-league-riundup-bayer-leverkusen>
 in the Champions League play-offs.

The 39-year-old Inzaghi, a former Lazio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> player, had been coaching the 
club’s youth squad. His older brother, Filippo Inzaghi, played for Juventus and 
Milan, who he managed last season. It is Simone Inzaghi’s first managerial 
position in Serie A.

Lazio are the eighth Serie A club to change managers this season.
