The ground will carry the name “Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Böllenfalltor” 
after technology company Merck gave up its naming rights. Heimes died in March 
at 26.

The idea came from Heimes’ father, a Merck employee. Darmstadt’s mayor, Jochen 
Partsch, called it a “unique action that we can only support”.

The Darmstadt <https://www.theguardian.com/football/darmstadt> captain, Aytac 
Sulu, says the move is extra motivation for the team, who are seeking to remain 
in the top flight for the second straight season. Sulu says the “link to Johnny 
will give us an extra push”.

Darmstadt surprised most people last season by avoiding relegation despite 
limited means.
