Federal and state governments must make power security a priority after South 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> suffered 
another widespread blackout, the boss of mining company BHP Billiton has warned.

Andrew Mackenzie said problems which cut power to 200,000 properties on 
Wednesday night showed that investment and jobs were being placed in peril by 
the failure of policy to both reduce emissions and secure affordable and 
uninterrupted power.

“The challenge to reduce emissions and grow the economy cannot fall to 
renewables alone,” Mackenzie said.

“This is a wake-up call ahead of the Coag meeting and power supply and 
security must be top of the agenda and urgently addressed.”

The latest outage, which was caused by a fault in Victoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria>, saw homes lose power for 
about an hour while BHP’s Olympic Dam operation was off the grid for four hours.

It follows a statewide outage in September caused by high winds which tore 
down transmission lines. This in turn triggeredsix “voltage disturbances” in 
the network

when the safety settings on nine of the state’s 13 wind turbines automatically 
caused them to disconnect from the grid.

The state energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, said work was under way to 
improve the national electricity market but that South Australia’s system 
worked well while on its own.


The blackout started because of an issue in the Victorian transmission network 
which impacted the flow through the Heywood interconnector,the Australian 
Energy Market Operator said in a statement on Thursday 
<http://www.aemo.com.au/Media-Centre/Media-statement---South-Australia>.

To balance the SA network, it had to shed 220MW of power, causing local power 
outages for up to an hour from 1.30am.

SA Power Networks confirmed about 30 suburbs were affected in various regions, 
with power restored to some within 15 minutes.

Koutsantonis said the SA system worked effectively while it was an “island” 
and gradually returned power to those who lost it from local rescources.

“This wasn’t something that began and spread in South Australia. This was a 
consequence of an event in Victoria,” he told reporters.

The SA system was reconnected to the national grid by 5.41am AEDT.

Koutsantonis said BHP’s lack of backup power was an issue for the company.

“They are the largest company in the world and they build generation 
redundancy almost in all of their mines. Why they haven’t done so in Olympic 
Dam is a matter for them,” he said.
