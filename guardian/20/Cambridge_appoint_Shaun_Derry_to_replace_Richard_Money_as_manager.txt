, announced on Thursday that the former Notts County manager Derry had been 
appointed on a contract until the end of the 2017-18 season.

Derry, the former Queens Park Rangers, Crystal Palace and Leeds midfielder,

March this year with the team a place above the drop zone. They were relegated 
in May.

Derry, 37, is expected to take charge of his first game at Oxford United on 
Saturday as Cambridge look to recover from a lacklustre start to the season 
that has seen them slip to 18th inLeague Two
