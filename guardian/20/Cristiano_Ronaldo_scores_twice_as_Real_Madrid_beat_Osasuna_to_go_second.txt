Cristiano Ronaldo scored two long-range goals to help Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> beat Osasuna 4-0 and stay in 
the Spanish league title chase while resting several first-choice players for 
Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at Bayern Munich.

With Gareth Bale recovering from the flu and Karim Benzema on the bench, all 
of Madrid's attack went through Ronaldo on the left flank.

And the Ballon d'Or winner didn't disappoint, unleashing two similar shots 
after cutting inside on to his right foot. Ronaldo is now La Liga's top scorer, 
with 30 goals, from 35 games.

Madrid are now three points behind Atlético Madrid, who visit Valencia on 
Sunday, when Barcelona, one point behind Real, host Villarreal.

Osasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> lined up to provide 
Real a guard of honour before the match as the hosts paraded their recently won 
Copa del Rey trophy at the Bernabéu.

Ronaldo scored his 29th league goal in the sixth minute when his shot from 
outside the area took a slight deflection off defender Damià Abella. He then 
set up scoring chances for Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Álvaro Morata.

The Portuguese started the second half as he had the first, with Osasuna's 
outclassed defence again allowing him to dribble to the corner of the area 
before launching a shot into the top corner of the net, in the 52nd minute.

Sergio Ramos headed in the third goal eight minutes later, just before 
Ronaldo's substitution was greeted by an ovation from the crowd. Dani Carvajal 
headed home Isco's lobbed pass to cap the win seven minutes from time.

Elsewhere, Getafe's 1-0 win against Malaga condemned last-place Real Betis to 
relegation, and Rayo Vallecano scored three times in the second half in a 3-0 
win at 10-man Granada.
