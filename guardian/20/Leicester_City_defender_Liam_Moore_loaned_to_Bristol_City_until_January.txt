The Leicester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> 
defender Liam Moore has joined Bristol City on loan until January. Moore played 
a major role in Leicester’s 2013-14 Championship-winning campaign, and Bristol 
have turned to the 22-year-old to reinforce defensively after a stuttering 
return to England’s second tier.

The England Under-21 international made 12 appearances in the Premier League 
last season under Nigel Pearson but has not been selected by Claudio Ranieri in 
a successful opening four games this term which have propelled Leicester to 
third in the table, although Moore did feature in the4-1 Capital One Cup win

 at Bury last week.

Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> have lost 
three of their opening five games after winning League One last season. Steve 
Cotterill has started the season playing three at the back, made up of Luke 
Ayling, Derrick Williams and Aden Flint; Moore is expected to challenge for one 
of the roles.
