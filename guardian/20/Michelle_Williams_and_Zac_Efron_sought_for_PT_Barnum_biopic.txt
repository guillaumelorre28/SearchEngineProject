The PT Barnum biopic The Greatest Showman on Earth, which will star Hugh 
Jackman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hugh-jackman> as the celebrated 
American circus owner, is looking to cast Michelle Williams and Zac Efron in 
its remaining major roles.

According to Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2016/07/michelle-williams-in-talks-to-join-hugh-jackman-p-t-barnum-in-the-greatest-showman-on-earth-1201783215/>
, Williams is in talks for a role in the film, which is thought to be that of 
opera singerJenny Lind <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lind>, AKA the 
Swedish Nightingale, who toured with Barnum in the early 1850s with 
considerable success. Efron is also being sought, but there is no suggestion as 
yet as to who he might play.

The Greatest Showman on Earth is being billed as Hollywood’s first original 
live-action film musical in two decades (since 1992’s Newsies), and is due to 
be directed by commercials director Michael Gracey (best known for the Evian
Roller Babies ad <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQcVllWpwGs>) with a script 
from Star Wars: The Force Awakens writer Michael Arndt.
