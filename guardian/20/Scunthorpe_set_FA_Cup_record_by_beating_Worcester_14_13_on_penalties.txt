Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> United beat 
Worcester City 14-13 on penalties in their FA Cup second-round replay at 
Aggborough on Wednesday after a 1-1 draw at the end of extra time.

Miguel Ángel Llera tucked home the winning shot at 10.45pm after Wayne Thomas 
had Worcester’s 16th effort saved by Sam Slocombe. There were 32 penalties in 
all.

The scoreline was a record for a penalty shootout in the FA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> proper, beating the 11-10 win by 
Macclesfield over Forest Green in November 2001.

It also equalled the record in English professional football, which was set in 
a 2011 Football League Trophy first-round tie between Dagenham & Redbridge and 
Leyton Orient and was then matched in September 2014,when Liverpool beat 
Middlesbrough 14-13 on penalties

 in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup.

Scunthorpe’s reward for their marathon effort will be a home tie in the third 
round against Chesterfield or MK Dons. They took the lead on 45 minutes through 
Paddy Madden, but Worcester, of the Conference North, equalised on 69 minutes 
with a goal from Sean Geddes.

The world record for the longest penalty shootout was in the Namibian Cup in 
2005, which went to 48 spot-kicks before KK Palace and Civics could be 
separated. KK Palace won 17-16.
