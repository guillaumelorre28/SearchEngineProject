Paris St-Germain prepared for their Champions League quarter-final against 
Chelsea with an industrious 1-0 win at Nice that sent them 13 points clear at 
the top ofLigue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> on 
Friday.

Timothee Kolodziejczak scored an own-goal after the break to hand PSG their 
seventh league win in a row.

Laurent Blanc's side, who host the Premier League leaders in the first leg of 
their Champions League quarter-final in Paris on Wednesday, were in control 
throughout at the Allianz Riviera but they failed to impress.

Blanc rested four of his usual starters as he left the centre-back Alex, the 
full-back Maxwell and the midfielders Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti on the 
bench.

The attacking trio of Ezequiel Lavezzi, Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 
however, all started.

The Argentinian forward Lavezzi missed a couple of chances in a dull first 
half during which Thiago Silva came close with a downward header andNice

for offside.

Eight minutes into the second half Kolodziejczak deflected a cross from 
Ibrahimovic into his own net.

Nice had their best chance one minute from time when Salvatore Sirigu punched 
away Christian Bruls' long-range effort.
