Antonio Conte was dismissive of Arsène Wenger’s suggestion that the title is 
already Chelsea’s to lose, but will face Stoke seeking a 13th successive league 
win and conscious that his team are favourites. “I’m pleased if people are 
changing their opinions (of us),” he said. “But that means you must pay even 
more attention.” Standards must not slip here. Stoke drew at Stamford Bridge 
and twice triumphed at home against the Londoners last term. They represent 
distinctly awkward opposition.Dominic Fifield
