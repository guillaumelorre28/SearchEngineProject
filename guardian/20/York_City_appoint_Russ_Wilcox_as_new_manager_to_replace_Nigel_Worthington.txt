.

The chairman Jason McGill told the club’s official website: “We believe Russ 
is the right person to take this club forward. He has excellent managerial 
experience and a track record of success in League Two. He is a hard-working 
individual and an excellent motivator and someone who shares our vision for the 
club now and in the future.”

Wilcox, 50, who was sacked by Scunthorpe

 earlier this month after a poor run of results in League One, said: “I’m 
looking forward to the challenge ahead of me. The club has great potential, 
with a new stadium on the horizon, and I feel I have the experience to help 
York City achieve success.”

Worthington left the club

 following a 3-1 defeat to Newport County, which left them in 22nd position in 
League Two and with only one league victory all season after 12 matches. He had 
joined York in March 2013 having spent more than two years out of the game 
following his resignation as Northern Ireland manager in 2011.
