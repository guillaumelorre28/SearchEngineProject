Permanent Secretary Female, 50s, from the Cabinet Office 

Dale Special adviser, 30s

Erica Special adviser, 30s


Whitehall, London, 2016. Night-time.


The offices of the hastily established Ministry for Brexit. A large map of 
Europe on the back wall. A screen showing global market activity.

The newly appointed Minister for Brexit is greeting his team of young-ish 
Spads,Erica and Dale, alongside the department’s new Permanent Secretary. 

Minister (looking around) Christ, why are we in this mess? 

Dale It’s what people voted for.

Minister No, I mean these offices. What a dump.


Permanent Secretary  The civil service thought a “staggered” approach to 
establishing this new ministry was the best course of action, Minister. Hence 
finding you some makeshift rooms here underneath the Cabinet Office.

Minister  Under the watchful eyes of mother, is it? Right. Okey-dokey, well, 
the White House may have the Situation Room. But this little bunker of ours 
will be our new Situation Command. And this “Sit-com” is going to – ah, right, 
no, that won’t work, we’ll have to–

Dale  It’s all right, I’m on it (typing on his Blackberry).

Erica  Can I introduce the Permanent Secretary assigned here by the Cabinet 
Office.

Permanent Secretary (shaking his hand) Congratulations on your appointment. 

Minister Said through slightly gritted teeth, I expect. 

Permanent Secretary  Not at all, my role is to be impartial. I’m not a 
political appointment.

Minister  But you were the civil servant who helped draft that whole “This 
government believes in remaining” booklet thing, right? Hardly impartial.


Permanent Secretary  If by that you mean it laid out the expert analysis of 
the independent institutions that run and service the British economy, its 
national security, international relations and other historic functions, then 
yes.

Minister  Well, let’s not go into all that again, it’s been three torturous 
and bruising months. Some of the most difficult in our history. But we must put 
it all behind us, and deliver the will of the people. Most of the people. At 
least, what their will was a couple of weeks ago, whatever it may be now. Some 
of them. (Claps his hands) Anyway. 

Permanent Secretary To that end, Minister … 

She gestures to a box on a desk in the centre of the room. 

Some other official looking Civil Servants enter. They insert their keys into 
the locks in the desk. ThePermanent Secretary does likewise. On her nod, they 
turn their keys simultaneously.

The box opens with a hiss, revealing a small Red Button. The Minister 
approaches it, uncertainly …

Minister What is this thing before me …? 

Permanent Secretary In order to invoke Article 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50>, Minister, all 28 member 
states of the … apologies, force of habit, all27 member states of the European 
Council must be simultaneously informed of the decision by the British 
government to leave. This mechanism, as designed by the civil service, alerts 
all necessary domestic and foreign bodies of that decision so that the article 
may be immediately invoked.

Once triggered … a clock begins its countdown, impossible to stop once it 
starts. Two years precisely to gather up our things and get out.

Parliament has no say. The decision alone rests with the royal prerogative of 
the government. It’s up toyou to decide if, and when, to press the trigger. Sir.

Minister (looks at the button. It almost seems to glow. His hand, half drawn 
to it.)Many a man and woman were called upon to push it … and all were found 
wanting. Now those players have all departed the stage. And so it falls to me …

Well, I will push. And push hard. When the time is right. For as soon as we 
do, we reveal our hand and the tables are turned against us. I will to Europe 
go! And negotiate the best terms while we still have our trump card to play.

Erica Maybe don’t call it a Trump card.

Minister No, good call.


Dale We have to get you over to Newsnight in 25, sir. 

Minister All right. Blue tie, cufflinks? I have a travel toothbrush somewhere– 

A general sorting of the Minister as he gets ready. 

Erica Shall we prep a little? 

Minister Yes, what am I saying – uh, “very honoured, weight of responsibility” 
blah blah. Er, “The new Prime Minister, in her first day behind the controls–”

Erica May day! May day! 

Minister Erica, don’t. “I am aware that” – oh, I just got it – “I’m aware that 
I am the first ever minister appointed to this position, and hopefully the 
last” – mmm, I’ll work on that bit – “I’ve been given the job of drafting the 
future of a nation, in the biggest decision ever undertaken by a free people 
within our lifetimes.” Er, what else – ah, the new ministry. Well, “Yes, we may 
be a small unit. And not everyone gives us much hope of success. But – I know a 
plucky little country in not that dissimilar a position.”

Dale Nice.

Minister Thank you – er, “one that also just extricated itself from a, a 
difficult marriage. Something I happen to have some experience of.”

Erica Good – personal experience, human, in touch.

Minister (brushing his teeth while he rehearses) And, yes, it can be scary. As 
the one leaving the nest, the other side gets to keep the home and the car and 
the kids – sure. But there are new homes to find, new kids to, to – have. And 
yeah it can be scary to hit the dating scene again – you’re a little longer in 
the tooth, a little thinner in the wallet. And, yes, there’s an awful moment 
you realise everyone else is already in a relationship with someone else. But 
that’s OK. Solitude is underrated. And there are other ways to get what you 
need, to find satisfaction, enjoyment. I’ve lost my train of thought.

Dale Doesn’t matter, let’s move on.

Minister Exactly. “Moving on” – I like that actually. That’s one of the 
problems with “exit”, as a term. Arriving is, is triumphant. Exiting is failure.

Erica The inevitable day we’re called upon to quit, headlines write 
themselves. “Fire Brexits.”

Dale “Brexiting under a cloud.”


Erica “Where are the signs for the nearest Brexit?” 

Dale “Be warned, the nearest Brexit may be behind you.” 

Permanent Secretary That one’s almost certainly true. 

Dale (on his Blackberry) Car’s on its way. Two minutes. 

Erica Role-play a few interview questions? 

Minister Mm, good idea. 

An interview setup arranged, the Minister still brushing his teeth, sorting 
his tie and so on. Erica acting as the interviewer. 

Erica Minister, as a vocal Brexiteer, you must be pleased to be playing your 
part.

Minister Mmm, yes, certainly, I – I may not be as, as colourful a character as 
some of the others. And I can’t say that I was a leading part of all campaign 
areas, but unlike others it’s fair to say I, like, led some.

Dale Don’t say “I like Leadsom.”

Minister What? Oh right, yes. Good spot, Dale.

Erica And you are going to trigger Article 50?

Minister That’s the will of the people.

Erica The winning side only won by a margin of 3.8%. 

Minister Brexit is going to happen. And that requires Article 50. 

Erica But when, minister? This uncertainty has wiped billions off Britain’s 
shares, billions off GDP, equivalent to the cost of many years of EU membership 
that leaving was intended to save. A bull stock market has quickly become abear 
market, tanking at the rate of–

Minister Ah, yes, you see, but you know the thing about bears, is that, is 
that, when you see one, the advice is not to run, but to make yourself as big 
and as loud as possible, to scare it away. Or at least, that’s the case with 
one type of bear, there’s a difference between black and brown, I think, the 
other one you’re meant to shrivel up into a ball and cower, but, but I forget 
which–

(looking at Dale) Can we Google that, check which one’s which, if I’m going to 
say it–

Dale I don’t think you should say it–

 Minister No, but if I am I don’t want to be giving bad bear advice on live 
TV. That could come back and bite me on the arse. Quite literally. Anyway–

Erica Time is at a premium, Minister, the Council of Europe is meeting right 
now in Brussels. They’re losing patience. There’s even talk of them triggering 
their Article 7, kicking us out immediately without any terms whatsoever.

Minister That’s scaremongering. It’ll never happen. To justify that, a 
majority of member states have to believe that we pose a real threat to the 
values and existence of the union, and I don’t think any reasonable person 
thinks that.

Erica You can’t be certain. No one has ever triggered Article 50 before. 

Minister Exactly, and the fact that no one knows how to do it is actually 
quite helpful.

Erica You’re saying no one knows what they’re doing? 

Minister No, it isn’t that no one knows what they’re doing, it’s just that – 
no one knows quite what to do. There’s a difference between those two 
positions. Not huge, admittedly–

Erica Like 3.8%?

Minister Exactly, not huge, but it, it makes all the difference, entirely, to 
everyone, and everything, for ever … Look, a lot of people keep saying we 
should sleep on this. Well, my message to them, to quote a former colleague, 
is, “You kip if you want to–”

Dale Not “Ukip”.

Minister Right, you – hmm, go back on that one.

Erica You agree with the new PM when she says, “Brexit means Brexit.” 

Minister Absolutely, yes, yes, though of course for “Brexit to mean Brexit”, 
and rightly so, no question, we first have to work out what … what Brexit 
means. Don’t we? In order for Brexit to mean, to mean “that”.

Erica Shouldn’t you have worked out what it meant before people voted for it? 

Minister Oh, no, you misunderstand me. We knew what it meant then. When people 
voted. Obviously. But ever since people voted to Brexit, everything’s just got 
thrown up in the air, hasn’t it? You know, including … Brexit … (turning around 
to his team) Hard this, isn’t it?

Dale and Erica Nooo, you’ll be fine. 

Erica Car’s downstairs. 

Minister OK, wish me luck. 

Dale Remember, just end on a zinger. 

Minister You don’t have to tell me that: it’s been my political maxim all my 
life. (Putting on his jacket) No one will remember how you got there. But 
they’ll sure as hell remember the manner in which you leave.

He winks, and exits. 

Permanent Secretary Right, if you’ll excuse me, I have about a hundred 
thousand new positions to fill. (Taking her files) You have to find some humour 
in the irony, I suppose. Extricating ourselves over the next two years will 
require the civil service to expand exponentially to fill the legislative tasks 
currently administered and financed by Brussels. A vote to “return democracy to 
the people” is about to trigger the largest and most expensive surrender of 
decision-making capabilities from elected representatives to an unelected 
bureaucratic elite in modern times. Que sera sera. If I’m still able to use 
casual French.

Dale Look, I know we were on different sides of the war, but we must both be 
on the winning side of the peace.

Permanent Secretary There’s a winning side?

Dale I get it. You’re angry –

Permanent Secretary (turning on him) I’m not angry. I’ve … I spent my life, 
here, working, here, yearning, fucking praying, for the return of “ideas”, 
telling young people, my daughter’s age, that politics doesn’t just have to be 
the preservation of the status quo, it can be a place of ideas, the potential 
for change. Well honestly, honestly, I miss the old days. When the worst you 
could accuse politics of being was boring. I miss boring. And I hate that 
that’s what this has done to me. That all I want for my children is a return to 
boring. For them. That I might find a way, somehow, to make life boring again. 
And I hate that that’s what this has done to me …

… that’s all.

A phone in the office starts to ring. And then another. And then all of them …

Dale That … that doesn’t sound good. Has something happened?

Erica (checking her phone). Oh Jesus. The Council. They’re voting! Voting on 
Article 7.

Dale No, bollocks, what?

Permanent Secretary (checking her phone) Belgium called a vote.

Erica Shit, get the Minister back, get him back.

Dale I’m trying, I’m trying – it’s engaged!

Permanent Secretary France has voted yes.

Erica What do we do? 

Permanent Secretary Now Germany.


Dale How many do they need to push their trigger?! 

Permanent Secretary A majority, 17. 

Erica Spain … Italy …

Dale We have to trigger ours before they trigger theirs, it’s our only hope – 
push it!


Permanent Secretary What? We’re not authorised to do that. 

Dale No one is! It’s our only hope. 

Erica Greece! Portugal! 

Dale Erica, push it! 

Erica No way, I’m not having my fingerprints on that! 

Permanent Secretary Denmark! 

Dale Someone do it! Someone do it! Trigger, trigger! 

The noise of the phones, alarms, and screaming becomes deafening. 

Erica and Dale can’t take it and make a run for it – leaving the Permanent 
Secretary alone by the button. They shoot one guilty look back at her before 
exiting.

Blackout.
