How generous are you? And does it matter whether or not your giving is 
anonymous? The answer may depend on your social class

Suppose that, as a thank you for taking part in a survey, you have been given 
10 raffle tickets, for a chance to win £100. You now have the option of 
donating some or all of your tickets to a fellow survey participant. How many 
(if any) would you choose to give? And does it make a difference whether this 
donation is entirely anonymous, or whether the recipient is told your name and 
the town where you live?

When this hypothetical scenario was played out for real, the researchers found 
something pretty surprising: participants who were categorised as “lower class” 
(based on their income, education and self-reported ranking) donated more 
tickets when the donation was anonymous (a mean of 2.5 tickets per person) than 
public (a mean of 1.5 tickets per person). For participants characterised as 
“upper class”, whether the donation was public or private made no difference, 
with a mean of around 1.7 tickets donated either way.

The precise reasons for this difference remain unclear but, when quizzed by 
the researchers, lower-class participants were less concerned than upper-class 
participants with feeling pride after their donation. One possibility, then, is 
that the less well-off find the showy giving of some rich celebrities so 
distasteful that they actually give less when the donation is public.
