Elise on Oliver

What were you hoping for? 
To meet someone I could get along with without having to force the 
conversation.


First impressions? 
Friendly and talkative: I could tell we would get along straight away.

What did you talk about? 
Mutual friends we realised we had, where we go out, what we do at college and 
where we work.

Any awkward moments? 
I tried to get through the wrong door multiple times.

Best thing about Oliver? 
His ability to keep a conversation going, and his warm vibe.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yes, they have a similar sense of humour.

Describe him in three words 
Charismatic, funny, genuine.

What do you think he made of you? 
Probably that I was easy-going and down to earth.

Did you go on somewhere? 
No, we had college commitments.

And... did you kiss? 
We had a goodbye hug.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? 
It could have lasted longer.

Marks out of 10? 
9.

Would you meet again? 
Yes, we got on very well, so I don’t see a reason not to.

Would you follow him on social media? 
We’ve already followed each other on Instagram.
