Unai Emery has informed Sevilla of his wish to leave the club amid interest 
fromParis Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain>, 
with the La Liga club confirming they have lined up the Argentinian Jorge 
Sampaoli as his replacement.

Emery, who led Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> to three 
Europa League titles in a row, is understood to be the favoured choice of the 
PSG president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, who earlier this month promised “big changes 
will happen” and publicly criticised the incumbent manager, Laurent Blanc.

While Blanc has not officially departed Parc des Princes, Khelaifi called 
PSG’s season, in which they won a domestic treble but were knocked out of the 
Champions League in the quarter-finals by Manchester City, a “failure” and said 
the club “must start a new cycle.”

Impressed by Emery’s accomplishments in continental competition, Khelaifi is 
now expected to begin formal contract discussions with the 44-year-old, 
although reports in France say there has already been contact between the 
parties. A deal may be confirmed this week.

Emery was also recently linked with the position at Everton but they are still 
expected to announce Ronald Koeman’s move from Southampton to Goodison Park in 
the coming days as Roberto Martínez’s successor.

Sampaoli, out of work since resigning from his position as head coach of Chile 
in January, will fly to Seville on Monday to discuss taking over at the Ramón 
Sánchez Pizjuán. The 56-year-old has enjoyed considerable success in South 
America but has not managed in Europe before. Sampaoli has previously said he 
missed out on the Chelsea job because his English was not good enough. Instead, 
that job went to the departing Italy coach, Antonio Conte.
