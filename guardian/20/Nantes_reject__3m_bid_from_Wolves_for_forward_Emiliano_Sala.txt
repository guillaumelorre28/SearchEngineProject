Nantes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nantes> have turned down a €4m 
bid (£3m) from Wolves for Emiliano Sala, with the French club insisting they do 
not want to sell.

The Argentina-born Sala, who joined the club from Bordeaux last summer, has 
scored two goals in 10 Ligue 1 starts this season. Wolves are in the market for 
a striker,having sold Benik Afobe to Bournemouth

 this month for £9m.

But Nantes, who are currently 11th in the standings are adamant that Sala will 
not be allowed to leave. “This is not about money,” said the club president, 
Waldemar Kita. “He’s only been there six months. We need him.”

Wolves have also expressed an interest in signing the goalkeeper Mamadou 
Samassa from Guingamp but are likely to wait until the summer to make a move 
for him.
