Arsenal expect to have Wojciech Szczesny back on their books in the summer, 
before they decide on their next move with him, as negotiations with Roma over 
another deal for the goalkeeper encounter problems.

Szczesny spent the past season on loan at Roma

, where he was the No1 choice of first Rudi García, who was sacked in January, 
and his managerial successor, Luciano Spalletti.

Szczesny particularly enjoyed working for Spalletti, under whom Roma

Roma would like to take Szczesny back for next season but they have so far 
struggled to put forward an acceptable offer to Arsenal, who paid a percentage 
of the Poland international’s wages last season. The goalkeeper has two years 
to run on hisArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> contract 
and he is expected to be offered a new one, even if the London club were to 
loan him again next season.

At present, Szczesny is focused on Poland’s campaign at Euro 2016 and 
recovering his fitness after he suffered a thigh injury in theopening game 
against Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jun/12/poland-v-northern-ireland-euro-2016-live>
. It was the result of an innocuous kick but the swelling was so severe 
afterwards that it ruled him out of Poland’s second Group C match against 
Germany. They face Ukraine in the final one on Tuesday.

“Arsenal and Roma are talking but I don’t want to worry about it now,” 
Szczesny said. “Whether I’m an Arsenal player or a Roma player right now, it 
makes no difference to me. I want to focus on this tournament.”
