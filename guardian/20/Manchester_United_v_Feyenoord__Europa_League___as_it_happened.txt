Full-time: United 4-0 Feyenoord

That could barely have gone better for United. An emphatic win lifts them to 
second in their group, meaning they only need to draw in their last match 
against Zorya Luhansk to progress. More than that, it was a fine attacking 
performance - at times sparkling. Their passing was snappy and their movement 
cunning. Rooney broke a record and Mkhitaryan made his big Old Trafford 
breakthrough. Everything looks a little rosier for Jose Mourinho. And I’m going 
to the pub, so everyone’s happy. Thanks for coming. Bye.

GOAL! United 4-0 Feyenoord (Lingard 90+2)

They only needed two more minutes. And what a beautiful goal it was. Lingard 
curled a low shot into the net from the edge of the area - via the keeper’s 
outstretched hand and the inside of the right-hand post - and all after a 
marvellous one-touch passing move by United .

88 min: Shaw and Bacasikoglu clash as they jump for a header. Both go down 
looking sore, but bot get back up quickly. Brave Shaw.

United substitution: Lingard on, Mkhitaryan off after an excellent 
performance, his breakthrough at United you could say. And, indeed, that is 
pretty much what the cheers from the crowd say.

83 min: Another mistakes by Jones eventually leads to another chance to

United substitution: Memphis on, Rooney off. So Rooney won’t be equalling 
Bobby Charlton’s record tonight - he’s still one behind But he did beat Ruud 
Van Nistelrooy’s European record for Untied today.

78 min: Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have become

75 min: Just before that third goal, Robbie Savage was eulogising about 
Rooney’s role in the second. It was classic Savage punditry: “That pass from 
Rooney [to Mata], not many people in the world could have made that pass. 
Scholes could, Pirlo could, lots of people could but, em, er....”

GOAL! United 3-0 Feyenoord (Jones og, 74)

GOAL! United 2-0 Feyenoord (Mata 68)

The Spaniard was about to be substituted but decided he needed a goal before 
leaving! It came courtesy of a brilliantly incisive exchanges of passes after 
Carrick had won the ball 30 yards from Feyenoord’s goal. He played it quickly 
to Ibrahimovic, who threaded it through to Rooney, who helped it into the path 
of Mata with a wicked reverse pass. And all Mata had to do was roll it into the 
net from nine yards. Quality.

a shot from 25 yards. Like his previous efforts it is a powerful swirler. And 
the keeper makes another save.

63 min: “I’m really liking this Mkhitaryan fellow!” cheers Thebo Mokaleng. 
“Where’d we pick him up? Seriously, he’s making it seem as if Mourinho’s the 
one with a problem for not playing him more. He is giving United a fresh new 
dimension. Hard to see how he’s ignored from here on in.” Maybe he wasn’t being 
ignored, he was being readied? And rather than exposing Moutinho’s folly, this 
performance is showing how well timed his introduction by the manager has been? 
Just a thought.

58 min: Mkhitaryan drives straight at the Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> defence from midfield. He 
flips the ball off to Ibrahimovic as he approaches the box and then continues 
his dash and receives the return ball, only to be thwarted by a last-gasp 
tackle. It would be nice to see him score today, he’s brought real verve and 
directness to United’s attacking.

56 min: More bright play from United. They’ve been encouragingly lively for 
most of this match, full of movement, swift passing and good ideas. It’s 
exactly vintage stuff but it’s an improvement on a lot of what has gone on this 
season and even more so on the Van Gaal and Moyes staples.

50 min: What!?! Mkhitaryan made a brilliant run from midfield, past two 
players thanks to his own deft footwork and shimmying and a clever decoy run by 
Ibrahimovic. He beats the last defender Toomstra, and is clear on goal! Then h 
goes down, it looked like a blatant shove by Toomstra, but the ref thinks 
otherwise. Mkhitaryan was off-balance, it’s true, but it looked like a foul to 
me.

48 min: Pogba aims a clever pass towards Rooney, lifting it over the last 
defender for the striker to chase. But he can’t chase as fast as he used to do, 
so can’t get to it before the keeper. “What do you mean the United glass is 
more than half full,” storms Bharat Tiwari. “Don’t pull the doilies from below 
our glasses, Paul! Agreed this isn’t quite the champagne yet, but we’re quite 
happy with what the Unlucky one is brewing for us. Agreed, there’s the 
occasional piece of grape stick in it, but we sure are salivating.” I can think 
of at least one United striker who heartily endorse that approach.

Here’s Matt Richman, whose glass is more than half full. “This may simply be a 
case of perception, but for a United fan now finally used to being flayed by 
the hopeless performances under Moyes followed by the merciless (though 
improved) doldrums under LVG, nights like this represent glimmering attacking 
football of the sort we had with Sir Alex. Those teams didn’t score every game, 
but the open play was wildly entertaining. What you call ‘stodgy spells’ I call 
relatively (operative word) rare lulls. This formation and a gloriously absent 
Fellaini are doing wonders for me.”

Half-time: United 1-0 Feyenoord

United deserved their lead, no question, and can be happy with the way it was 
taken - a cute finish by Rooney -, butFeyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have hinted at enough quality 
to suggest that a comeback is not out of the question. But if United retain 
their focus and keep their tempo high, they should complete the win.

45 min: Karsdorp miscues an intended pass to the keeper, sending it towards 
Ibrahimovic instead! He’s lucky that the Swede was taken by surprise and 
another defender was on hand to tidy up.

39 min: I’ve now seen a replay and can confirm that Rooney was onside for the 
goal. Or, er, maybe a millimetre offside. It’s hard to be sure. So benefit of 
the doubt to attacker, that’s how it should be.

38 min: Isn’t it funny how words or phrases that mean something completely 
innocent in one language can be very rude in another? A smattering of the Dutch 
visitors to Old Trafford have been singing “Fuck off Mourinho”, utterly 
oblivious to what that means in English.

36 min: There are suggestions that Rooney was offside for that goal and that 
there may have been a foul in the buildup. I’ve not seen a conclusive replay 
but will get back you on that when I do.

GOAL! United 1-0 Feyenoord (Rooney 35)

Lovely move started by Rooney on the left wing and daintily finished by the 
same man in the box. He took a clever return pass from Ibrahimovic and dinked 
it over the advancing keeper from 10 yards. That was excellent and should be 
celebrated accordingly.

30 min: That’s better from United! When they pass fast they make progress. A 
series of one-touch passes culminated in Pogba chipping a nice ball over the 
top to Mkhitaryan, who had again made a sly dash into the box. Oh, the flag’s 
up. Still, a positive move for United.

25 min: Elia dances past Phil Jones on the left-hand side of the box and then 
pulls the ball back to Jorgensen, whose powerful shot from 14 yards is saved 
well by Romero. The rebound eventually comes to Kuyt, who hits it with his left 
foot first time on the swivel, whereupon Romero makes a quick-thinking save 
with his right foot, kicking the ball away as if shaking dog droppings off his 
boot. If either of those great chances had gone in, there’d have been a hell of 
a stink around Old Trafford.

23 min: Pogba spanks a long ball rom inside his own half towards Mata, who is 
pushed to the ground by Nelom just outside the area. It’s a freekick alright 
but not to Mata, because he was offside.

20 min: A couple of panicky moments in the box for Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> as United pile on the 
pressure. On both occasions a Dutch defender scrambled the ball away in the 
nick of time, once after Jones had saved a shot from Carrick. Mkhitaryan was 
instrumental in both alerts: he’s started very brightly.

18 min: Shaw attacks down the left, then threads a little pass towards 
Mkhitaryan in the box. The latter knocks it back out to Pogba, who tries a 
blaster from 25 yards. It wobbles through the air at tremendous speed. The 
keeper gets both hands on it but doesn’t fancy trying to catch so pushes it 
over.

almost reached the United box. An indication, then, that they may be getting up 
to the speed that United have set. Let’s see how long they can sustain it.

9 min: Lovely interplay between Mkhitaryan and Rooney, who had taken up a 
central position, as United’s show no respect for static formations. The pair 
exchanged quick passes and clever passes to pick their way through the defence. 
It was a pity that the last pass from Rooney was inches too long, otherwise the 
Armenian could have crowned a nice move with a goalscoring return to the 
starting lineup.

6 min: Rooney has been operating mainly on the right so far. He’s only 
sporting a dense beard. Hope he’s got permission for that from The Sun and 
those other protectors of Team England’s good image.

4 min: Pogba opens fire from just outside the area. He’s a little off-balance, 
and the ball swerves way off target. But United have been totally on top in the 
opening minutes.

2 min: United are eager to apply maximum early pressure. They’re pouring 
forward. Valencia chips a cross into the danger zone, and Pogba outjumps the 
defender and tries to power a header goalward from seven yards. But he doesn’t 
catch it quite right and it loops over.

1 min: United kick off and show their attacking ambition straight away. Rooney 
floats a cross from the right towards the back post, where Ibrahimovic heads it 
across goal. It was fractionally too long or Mkhitaryan.

Christmas just around the corner United are wearing Santa Claus colours - red 
shirt, white shorts and white stockings – whileFeyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have plumped for all blue, a 
knowing nod to United’s city rivals, no doubt.

Mourinho, under interrogation by a man on the telly, has coughed up the 
following pre-match thoughts when asked whether this match could represent a 
new beginning for Mkhitaryan:

“I hope so. He’s woking really hard. It’s a bit difficult for him to adapt 
especially to the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League. Some 
players have qualities that allow them to adapt more quickly than others but, 
especially mixed with an injury, it has been more difficult for him. But it’s a 
player that we know has a lot of talent. And playing in a very offensive team 
like today, with Michael Carrick as the only positional player, should be good 
for him.”

Preamble

Hello. The story so far: blue chip football operation Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have got themselves 
into a mighty pickle. If there is one thing worse for the brand than fluthering 
around in the Europa League, it’s going full clobber to win the darn thing but 
flunking out at the group stages. That is the ignominy that will hit United 
like a custard pie if Feyenoord beat them again today, the Dutch having already 
done so in Rotterdam earlier in the group. Such an outcome does not seem 
likely, though: Feyenoord have some key enforced absences, especially in 
central defence, and United, for all their recent travails, including against 
Fenerbahce in their last outing in this tournament, have not lost any of their 
13 European matches at Old Trafford since the retirement of Alex Ferguson. What 
is more, United showed encouraging signs of improvement in their last match, 
against Arsenal on Saturday, although, on the other hand, the fact that they 
failed to win that game could be seen as evidence that they remain saddled with 
a haplessness that is doing nothing for the rectitude of Jose Mourinho’s melon.

The manager said this week that restoring United to full power is a three-year 
job and, without ignoring his failings, you can see where he is coming from – 
the squad plainly needs work - but even he suggested there could be no excuse 
for defeat today (indeed, but chances are he could find one if necessary). A 
draw today could ultimately prove enough to get United into the next round, 
provided they beat Zorya Luhansk in their final game andFeyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> do not beat Fenerbahce, but a 
victory, preferably thanks to a rousing performance, is what they really need 
to avoid a severe accumulation of stress and hot air over the days ahead. Let’s 
see how they go.

Wayne Rooney rolls back years to help Manchester United hit right note

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/24/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-feyenoord> 
That could barely have gone better for United. An emphatic win lifts them to 
second in their group, meaning they only need to draw in their last match 
against Zorya Luhansk to progress. More than that, it was a fine attacking 
performance - at times sparkling. Their passing was snappy and their movement 
cunning. Rooney broke a record and Mkhitaryan made his big Old Trafford 
breakthrough. Everything looks a little rosier for Jose Mourinho. And I’m going 
to the pub, so everyone’s happy. Thanks for coming. Bye.
 
They only needed two more minutes. And what a beautiful goal it was. Lingard 
curled a low shot into the net from the edge of the area - via the keeper’s 
outstretched hand and the inside of the right-hand post - and all after a 
marvellous one-touch passing move by United .

Images  
90 min: United have at least three more minutes to get a fourth goal. 
 
88 min: Shaw and Bacasikoglu clash as they jump for a header. Both go down 
looking sore, but bot get back up quickly. Brave Shaw.
 
86 min: Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> are gamely 
seeking a consolation, but not getting close.
 
United substitution: Lingard on, Mkhitaryan off after an excellent 
performance, his breakthrough at United you could say. And, indeed, that is 
pretty much what the cheers from the crowd say.
 
83 min: Another mistakes by Jones eventually leads to another chance to 
United. But the keeper redeems himself by catching Rashford’s 18-yard shot. It 
wasn’t difficult, mind.
 
United substitution: Memphis on, Rooney off. So Rooney won’t be equalling 
Bobby Charlton’s record tonight - he’s still one behind But he did beat Ruud 
Van Nistelrooy’s European record for Untied today.
 
78 min: Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have become 
very disheveled. There could be more goals here for United. Ibrahimovic is 
visibly yearning for one, and Mkhitaryan is earning one.
 
Feyenoord substitution: Basacikoglu on, Toomstra off.
 
75 min: Just before that third goal, Robbie Savage was eulogising about 
Rooney’s role in the second. It was classic Savage punditry: “That pass from 
Rooney [to Mata], not many people in the world could have made that pass. 
Scholes could, Pirlo could, lots of people could but, em, er....”
 
Rashford threads a pass through to Ibrahimovic, who takes it to the byline and 
then tries to send a low pass towards Mkhitaryan. But it’s too close to the 
keeper. Not to worry, Jones unintentionally diverts it into his goal via the 
inside of this left foot.

Feyenoord substitution: Kramer on, Jorgensen off. 
 
United substitution: Rashford on, Mata off, having completed his goalscoring 
celebration.
 
The Spaniard was about to be substituted but decided he needed a goal before 
leaving! It came courtesy of a brilliantly incisive exchanges of passes after 
Carrick had won the ball 30 yards from Feyenoord’s goal. He played it quickly 
to Ibrahimovic, who threaded it through to Rooney, who helped it into the path 
of Mata with a wicked reverse pass. And all Mata had to do was roll it into the 
net from nine yards. Quality.

66 min: Pogba lopes 40 yards down the left, then turns in-field and unleashes 
a shot from 25 yards. Like his previous efforts it is a powerful swirler. And 
the keeper makes another save.
 
63 min: “I’m really liking this Mkhitaryan fellow!” cheers Thebo Mokaleng. 
“Where’d we pick him up? Seriously, he’s making it seem as if Mourinho’s the 
one with a problem for not playing him more. He is giving United a fresh new 
dimension. Hard to see how he’s ignored from here on in.” Maybe he wasn’t being 
ignored, he was being readied? And rather than exposing Moutinho’s folly, this 
performance is showing how well timed his introduction by the manager has been? 
Just a thought.

Gareth Copley/Getty Images  
61 min: Kuyt exists, replaced by Berghuis and booed by Unite fans, who haven’t 
forgotten that hat-trick he scored against them for Liverpool.
 
61 min: Ibrahimovic has a go from the edge of the area but his shot is blocked.
 
58 min: Mkhitaryan drives straight at the Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> defence from midfield. He 
flips the ball off to Ibrahimovic as he approaches the box and then continues 
his dash and receives the return ball, only to be thwarted by a last-gasp 
tackle. It would be nice to see him score today, he’s brought real verve and 
directness to United’s attacking.
 
56 min: More bright play from United. They’ve been encouragingly lively for 
most of this match, full of movement, swift passing and good ideas. It’s 
exactly vintage stuff but it’s an improvement on a lot of what has gone on this 
season and even more so on the Van Gaal and Moyes staples.
 
54 min: Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> reassert 
their attacking credentials ... and nearly get a shot on target, but Vilhema 
didn’t catch his volley right from the edge of the area, screwing it way wide.
 
52 min: Mata essays a beautiful lob from just outside the box and it very 
nearly comes off! Jones has to backpedal hastily to reach up and tip it over 
the bar.
 
50 min: What!?! Mkhitaryan made a brilliant run from midfield, past two 
players thanks to his own deft footwork and shimmying and a clever decoy run by 
Ibrahimovic. He beats the last defender Toomstra, and is clear on goal! Then h 
goes down, it looked like a blatant shove by Toomstra, but the ref thinks 
otherwise. Mkhitaryan was off-balance, it’s true, but it looked like a foul to 
me.
 
49 min: Dammers blocks a shot from Ibrahimovic. Mkhitaryan pounces on the 
breaking ball at the edge of the area and skips past one defender before his 
shot is also blocked.
 
48 min: Pogba aims a clever pass towards Rooney, lifting it over the last 
defender for the striker to chase. But he can’t chase as fast as he used to do, 
so can’t get to it before the keeper. “What do you mean the United glass is 
more than half full,” storms Bharat Tiwari. “Don’t pull the doilies from below 
our glasses, Paul! Agreed this isn’t quite the champagne yet, but we’re quite 
happy with what the Unlucky one is brewing for us. Agreed, there’s the 
occasional piece of grape stick in it, but we sure are salivating.” I can think 
of at least one United striker who heartily endorse that approach.
 
46 min: Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> start the 
second half because United started the first. Fair is fair.
 
Here’s Matt Richman, whose glass is more than half full. “This may simply be a 
case of perception, but for a United fan now finally used to being flayed by 
the hopeless performances under Moyes followed by the merciless (though 
improved) doldrums under LVG, nights like this represent glimmering attacking 
football of the sort we had with Sir Alex. Those teams didn’t score every game, 
but the open play was wildly entertaining. What you call ‘stodgy spells’ I call 
relatively (operative word) rare lulls. This formation and a gloriously absent 
Fellaini are doing wonders for me.”
 
United deserved their lead, no question, and can be happy with the way it was 
taken - a cute finish by Rooney -, butFeyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have hinted at enough quality 
to suggest that a comeback is not out of the question. But if United retain 
their focus and keep their tempo high, they should complete the win.
 
45 min: Karsdorp miscues an intended pass to the keeper, sending it towards 
Ibrahimovic instead! He’s lucky that the Swede was taken by surprise and 
another defender was on hand to tidy up.
 
42 min: Kuyt pushes over Carrick on halfway, for old time’s sake. Freekick to 
United.
 
39 min: I’ve now seen a replay and can confirm that Rooney was onside for the 
goal. Or, er, maybe a millimetre offside. It’s hard to be sure. So benefit of 
the doubt to attacker, that’s how it should be.
 
38 min: Isn’t it funny how words or phrases that mean something completely 
innocent in one language can be very rude in another? A smattering of the Dutch 
visitors to Old Trafford have been singing “Fuck off Mourinho”, utterly 
oblivious to what that means in English.

 
36 min: There are suggestions that Rooney was offside for that goal and that 
there may have been a foul in the buildup. I’ve not seen a conclusive replay 
but will get back you on that when I do.
 
Lovely move started by Rooney on the left wing and daintily finished by the 
same man in the box. He took a clever return pass from Ibrahimovic and dinked 
it over the advancing keeper from 10 yards. That was excellent and should be 
celebrated accordingly.

30 min: That’s better from United! When they pass fast they make progress. A 
series of one-touch passes culminated in Pogba chipping a nice ball over the 
top to Mkhitaryan, who had again made a sly dash into the box. Oh, the flag’s 
up. Still, a positive move for United.
 
28 min: United have lapsed into one of those stodgy spells that have afflicted 
them too often this season.
 
25 min: Elia dances past Phil Jones on the left-hand side of the box and then 
pulls the ball back to Jorgensen, whose powerful shot from 14 yards is saved 
well by Romero. The rebound eventually comes to Kuyt, who hits it with his left 
foot first time on the swivel, whereupon Romero makes a quick-thinking save 
with his right foot, kicking the ball away as if shaking dog droppings off his 
boot. If either of those great chances had gone in, there’d have been a hell of 
a stink around Old Trafford.

Recine/Reuters  
23 min: Pogba spanks a long ball rom inside his own half towards Mata, who is 
pushed to the ground by Nelom just outside the area. It’s a freekick alright 
but not to Mata, because he was offside.
 
20 min: A couple of panicky moments in the box for Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> as United pile on the 
pressure. On both occasions a Dutch defender scrambled the ball away in the 
nick of time, once after Jones had saved a shot from Carrick. Mkhitaryan was 
instrumental in both alerts: he’s started very brightly.
 
18 min: Shaw attacks down the left, then threads a little pass towards 
Mkhitaryan in the box. The latter knocks it back out to Pogba, who tries a 
blaster from 25 yards. It wobbles through the air at tremendous speed. The 
keeper gets both hands on it but doesn’t fancy trying to catch so pushes it 
over.
 
17 min: Their early vim having subsided, United are starting to meander a 
little.Feyenoord <https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> are looking 
increasingly confident, though not yet dangerous.
 
14 min: Blind tugs back Elia as Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> try to launch a 
counter-attack. The freekick is given but no yellow card.
 
13 min: Pogba’s cross from the left is headed behind for a corner. Mata 
delivers an outswinger towards Carrick, but it’s headed clear.
 
11 min: For the first time in the match Feyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> put a move together. They 
almost reached the United box. An indication, then, that they may be getting up 
to the speed that United have set. Let’s see how long they can sustain it.
 
9 min: Lovely interplay between Mkhitaryan and Rooney, who had taken up a 
central position, as United’s show no respect for static formations. The pair 
exchanged quick passes and clever passes to pick their way through the defence. 
It was a pity that the last pass from Rooney was inches too long, otherwise the 
Armenian could have crowned a nice move with a goalscoring return to the 
starting lineup.
 
6 min: Rooney has been operating mainly on the right so far. He’s only 
sporting a dense beard. Hope he’s got permission for that from The Sun and 
those other protectors of Team England’s good image.
 
4 min: Pogba opens fire from just outside the area. He’s a little off-balance, 
and the ball swerves way off target. But United have been totally on top in the 
opening minutes.
 
2 min: United are eager to apply maximum early pressure. They’re pouring 
forward. Valencia chips a cross into the danger zone, and Pogba outjumps the 
defender and tries to power a header goalward from seven yards. But he doesn’t 
catch it quite right and it loops over.
 
1 min: United kick off and show their attacking ambition straight away. Rooney 
floats a cross from the right towards the back post, where Ibrahimovic heads it 
across goal. It was fractionally too long or Mkhitaryan.
 
The teams present themselves for the pre-match formalities on the pitch. With 
Christmas just around the corner United are wearing Santa Claus colours - red 
shirt, white shorts and white stockings – whileFeyenoord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord> have plumped for all blue, a 
knowing nod to United’s city rivals, no doubt.

 
Mourinho, under interrogation by a man on the telly, has coughed up the 
following pre-match thoughts when asked whether this match could represent a 
new beginning for Mkhitaryan:

“I hope so. He’s woking really hard. It’s a bit difficult for him to adapt 
especially to the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League. Some 
players have qualities that allow them to adapt more quickly than others but, 
especially mixed with an injury, it has been more difficult for him. But it’s a 
player that we know has a lot of talent. And playing in a very offensive team 
like today, with Michael Carrick as the only positional player, should be good 
for him.”
 
Look! Henrikh Mkhitaryan must have been a good boy in training: he’s about to 
make only the second start of hisManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> career, and his first 
since the Manchester derby more than two months ago.

Mkhitaryan; Ibrahimovic.
