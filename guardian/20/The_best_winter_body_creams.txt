You are not alone in feeling as though winter has sucked every drop of 
moisture from your body, leaving you less human and more dehydrated iguana in 
need of ChapStick. In summer, body creams are a lovely indulgence, a way of 
maintaining tans and layering perfumes. In winter, less so. A decent body cream 
will prevent your legs scaling and your elbows falling off. At this time of 
year, a body cream is a necessity.
