“Signing with Paris Saint-Germain

proud moment,” said Ben Arfa on Friday.

“Paris Saint-Germain has always been a very special team for me, so to wear 
this jersey at the Parc des Princes is a childhood dream. It is an honour that 
the club is giving me this opportunity, making this dream come true.

“I will do my utmost to represent my new team to the best of my abilities and 
to make our supporters proud. Finally, I would like to thank OGCNice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice>, who helped me get back to enjoying 
my football again and gave me another chance to show French fans what I am 
capable of on the pitch.”
