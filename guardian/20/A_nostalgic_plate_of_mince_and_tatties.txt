My home is not, and never has been, in the UK, but working on my latest book, 
The British Table <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/british-table.html>, and 
cooking a lot of the traditional British recipes in it, I realised that the 
most evocative thing for me was mince and tatties. It’s something I’ve eaten, 
and cooked, in various ways, my whole life.

My first trip to the UK was in 1966/ 1967. I was living in LA and went to 
Manchester to meet my English girlfriend’s parents. That was my first taste of 
England. I broke up with that girlfriend, but made other friends, and kept 
going back. A lot of the food I encountered around that time was pretty grim, 
but at some point I came across mince and tatties and it appealed to me. From 
the time I was a kid, if you’d given me the choice between mince or steak, I’d 
always have gone for the former.

My mother was a terrible cook. I feel awful saying it, but it’s true. My first 
memory of ground beef would be her spaghetti bolognese: cooked without much 
flavouring – she was radically opposed to onions or garlic – a can of corn 
dumped in, followed by some overcooked spaghetti. It wasn’t bad; it was 
certainly better than other things she tried to cook. I was 15 years old when I 
realised that a hunk of roast beef didn’t have to be grey inside – that’s just 
how she’d always cooked it.

Since I started cooking for myself at 18, some version of this has gone with 
me from home to home. If you have a few leftover veg, you chop it up very 
finely and throw it in. The last time I was in London, I had a particularly 
good mince at theQuality Chop House <http://thequalitychophouse.com/>. I would 
happily go back there exclusively for that one dish. I wish I could have it for 
lunch today.

Despite her limitations in the kitchen my mother had three beautiful cast-iron 
skillets that nested neatly into one other. I inherited them, and I use them 
still. They were not new when I was a child, and I’m 71 now, so they’re at 
least 75 years old. They’re flaking away and I wonder if I might not wear right 
through the bottoms of them.. I use them in the oven, on the hob, the barbecue, 
the grill. If I’m at home, I use one, if not all three, every day. And one of 
my daughters will no doubt be using them for the next 50 years. Without 
question, they are the one thing I would grab if there were a fire. They are 
perfect to make mince in.

Mince and tatties

There’s a famous poem 
<http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/mince-and-tatties> about 
this definitive Scottish comfort dish byJK Annand 
<http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/j-k-annand> that promises 
that if you: “mash and mix the tatties / Wi mince into the mashin / And sic a 
tasty denner / Will aye be voted ‘Smashin!’” I like a Scottish street rhyme, 
collected onelectricscotland.com 
<http://www.electricscotland.com/history/literat/spoetry1.htm>, even better: It 
warns “You canna shove your granny off a bus (x2) / You canna shove your 
granny,/ Cause she makes your mince ‘n’ tatties ...” In her bookBroths to 
Bannocks <http://www.foodinscotland.co.uk/books.html>, Catherine Brown notes 
that: “The best steak, cut from the rump and minced by the butcher, is how many 
Scottish housewives buy mince.” This is an adaptation of her recipe.

Scottish comfort food: mince and tatties. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian
Serves 4
1 tbsp stoneground Scottish oats
2 tbsp corn or rapeseed oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
450g ground beef
1 large carrot, thinly sliced
115g black pudding, skin removed (optional)
Salt and black pepper

1 Toast the oats in a small dry frying pan over medium-high heat, shaking the 
pan often, until they turn golden brown – about 5 minutes. Set aside.

2 Put the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and 
cook, stirring frequently, until it browns – 10‑12 minutes. Push it to one side 
of the pan, then add the ground beef.

3 Cook the beef, breaking it into small pieces and stirring with a wooden 
spoon, until it is well browned – 12-15 minutes. Mix in the onions.

4 Add the carrot and the toasted oats, stirring them in well, then add the 
black pudding (if using), breaking it up so that it mixes in well. Add enough 
water to just cover the ingredients, then season generously, reduce the heat to 
low, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the carrots are soft. The 
finished mince should have the consistency of a thick stew. Serve with the 
mashed potatoes on the side.

Tatties (mashed potatoes)

“Mash” is a common accompaniment around Great Britain for simply cooked meats, 
sausages (as in the iconic bangers and mash), and sometimes sauced dishes. Some 
cooks peel and halve or quarter their potatoes, then boil them in salted water 
before mashing, but in my experience, the potatoes have better flavour and are 
less watery if you steam them in their jackets.

Serves 4-6
900g (5 or 6 medium) russet potatoes, unpeeled, scrubbed
240ml double cream
115g butter, softened
Salt and pepper

1 Put the potatoes into a pot large enough to hold them in a single layer and 
fill the pot halfway with cold water. Cover the pot and bring the water to a 
boil over high heat. When the water begins to boil, carefully drain off all but 
about 1cm of it, then return the pot to the heat, cover, reduce the heat to 
low, and let the potatoes steam until tender, about 40 minutes. Add a little 
more water if the pot begins to go dry. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the cooking 
water, then transfer the potatoes to a bowl, cover them with a clean dish 
cloth, and set them aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly.

2 Meanwhile, put the cream, butter and reserved cooking water into a small pot 
and bring the mixture to a simmer over a medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to 
low and simmer until the potatoes have cooled.

3 Drain and carefully slip the peel off the potatoes, then return them to the 
large pot and mash them well while slowly pouring in the cream mixture. 
Generously season the potatoes with salt and pepper, then whisk them vigorously 
with a large whisk to dissolve any large lumps – the potatoes will not be 
completely smooth.
