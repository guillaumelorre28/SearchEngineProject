To be honest, it wasn’t really on from the moment Kone scored for Everton 
inside 100 seconds. Lennon doubled the lead soon afterwards and, while Carlisle 
certainly kept going and created a smattering of half-chances, this one only 
looked likely to go one way. Barkley scored a deflected third and Everton were 
in full control throughout; the bigger picture, of course, is what this meant 
to Carlisle United and the people of an area that has had it very tough indeed 
of late. Everton go through to the next round and if you want a shock of any 
note you’ll have to hope that MK Dons v Chelsea,curated here by Lawrence Ostlere

89 min: A couple of nice triangles from Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> inside their own half elicit 
cheers, and their best move of the match continues with Gilliead, who gets down 
to the right byline with some good skill and cuts back to Ibehre ... who has 
their best chance of the match, beating Robles but seeing Jagielka stretch to 
block inside the six-yard box! That could, maybe should, have been a nice 
postscript.

84 min: Miller hurls a long throw into the box for Carlisle; it’s flicked on 
but not in the vicinity of a home head. He gets another go from the opposite 
side and this time Raynes heads on into the path of Sweeney, who breaks through 
at an angle and Robles has to block for a corner. He flaps at the flag kick but 
the danger is cleared.

82 min: Everton just tapping the ball around now, having to evade a frustrated 
lunch or two. A long move ends with Lennon finding Coleman, whose centre is 
blocked.

75 min: So does Kone, who twangs the bar! A shot doesn’t seem on as he chases 
the ball towards the byline but he has a go and it flicks off the frame and

ovation from the home support.

71 min: Dangerous Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> 
free-kick outside the box as Cleverley fouls Hope. Can they throw themselves a 
lifeline? It’s worked to Atkinson but, by the time that’s happened, Osman has 
got out of the wall to smother the shooting chance. A shout or two for 
handball, but nothing given – a little generously to Osman.

70 min: Barkley seems to fancy more but this time he opts to feed Lennon, 
after due consideration. A corner is won, but two Everton players get in the 
way of one another when it is played in. Gilliead counters forCarlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> and, if nothing else, manages 
to get the ball 70 yards up the pitch and relieve some pressure.

67 min: Slightly surprised the commentary team didn’t realise first time that 
the shot had taken a deflection. Barkley deserved the goal though.

Goal! Carlisle 0-3 Everton (Barkley 65)

Doesn’t take long for Barkley to go one better. Osman finds him on the left 
hand corner of the box, he takes the ball inside and, via a deflection off the 
head of Ellis, finds the top corner. Good hit, and game over.

61 min: Oh, that would have been another solo goal to add to the Ross Barkley 
collection. He somehow gets through three players before, just as he seems to 
have done the hard work, touching the ball slightly too far and allowing 
Atkinson to block. In the meantime, Pienaar – who hasn’t looked sharp – is 
replaced by Leon Osman.

60 min: Lennon cutely plays Coleman in, and he shapes up a left-footed shot 
from just outside the six-yard box. Raynes dives in brilliantly to block a 
certain goal, and Gillespie catches the corner.

51 min: Asamoah twists and turns outside the box but Oviedo is wise to all 
that. No early assault fromCarlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> yet, although they do seem to 
have stepped a few yards up the pitch.

49 min: Some lengthy treatment from the physio for McCarthy, who is now helped 
up. Looks as if he’s ok but I wonder if he’ll be risked for much longer. 
There’s no need to flog him in the current situation, and he has just come back 
from injury.

47 min: Comfortable enough start to the half from Everton but Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> definitely have a few more 
threats on the park now. McCarthy is felled nastily by Kennedy, though, and the 
home player is booked.

Changes for Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle>. Looks 
like they’ll switch from a back three to a back four. “Plan B”, says Curle, 
“We’re going to try and attack. We gave them a head start so what we need now 
is a goal to try and make them uncomfortable.”

Half-time: Carlisle 0-2 Everton

So far, so straightforward. Keith Curle’s plan to contain and spoil went out 
of the window within two minutes when Kone scored. Asamoah then had a shot 
saved by Robles for the hosts but Lennon made it two soon enough and, to be 
honest, the occasion has all been a bit flat since then. Can the home side come 
out all guns blazing, maybe with another attacker or two introduced? Find out 
shortly...

45+1 min: Comley has an ambitious slash from 30 yards – it’s scuffed but 
almost serves as the perfect assist for Kennedy, who seems to have a sight of 
goal for a split second but can’t quite get the ball out from under his feet. 
That could have made things interesting...

44 min: Comley then wins the ball superbly from Pienaar, breaks forwards and 
is hauled down by McCarthy. Yellow card, and no complaints.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> as, following patient play by 
Dicker, Gillespie arrows in a dangerous delivery from the left that Miller nods 
down into space ... but there’s nobody there to attack the ball.

41 min: Oviedo crosses from the left and Kone, on his left foot, is probably a 
bit too careful with his volley. Gillespie gathers with ease.

squeeze into Carlisle's ludicrously tiny concrete bench hovels. Brilliant! So 
FA Cup!

Yep – just a shame about the score. Lukaku in particular isn’t doing a lot for

39 min: Asamoah is, generally, pretty short of support here for Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle>. Just picked the ball up in the 
centre circle but had no options really. Is it worth Curle getting Ibehre on at 
the break?

37 min: Robles claims a Gillesphey free-kick and releases Lennon with a 
gargantuan throw. A scamper to the byline later and it’s a throw-in – Miller

26 min: Dicker shows some nice skill to start a move in midfield but it breaks 
down and Kone gets away in a dangerous position only to pass beyond Pienaar. 
The home team have at least got a foot or two on the ball in the last couple of 
minutes ... and Asamoah then wins a corner down the right...

To be honest, it wasn’t really on from the moment Kone scored for Everton 
inside 100 seconds. Lennon doubled the lead soon afterwards and, while Carlisle 
certainly kept going and created a smattering of half-chances, this one only 
looked likely to go one way. Barkley scored a deflected third and Everton were 
in full control throughout; the bigger picture, of course, is what this meant 
to Carlisle United and the people of an area that has had it very tough indeed 
of late. Everton go through to the next round and if you want a shock of any 
note you’ll have to hope that MK Dons v Chelsea,curated here by Lawrence Ostlere

That is that.
 
90+2 min: Gibson tries a trademark effort from range but it’s down the throat 
of Gillespie.
 
90+1 min: Three added minutes to be played.
 
89 min: A couple of nice triangles from Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> inside their own half elicit 
cheers, and their best move of the match continues with Gilliead, who gets down 
to the right byline with some good skill and cuts back to Ibehre ... who has 
their best chance of the match, beating Robles but seeing Jagielka stretch to 
block inside the six-yard box! That could, maybe should, have been a nice 
postscript.
 
87 min: It’s training game stuff now, and apart from that little flurry just 
then it has been for some time.
 
84 min: Miller hurls a long throw into the box for Carlisle; it’s flicked on 
but not in the vicinity of a home head. He gets another go from the opposite 
side and this time Raynes heads on into the path of Sweeney, who breaks through 
at an angle and Robles has to block for a corner. He flaps at the flag kick but 
the danger is cleared.
 
83 min: Brendan Galloway now comes on for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, replacing Coleman.
 
82 min: Everton just tapping the ball around now, having to evade a frustrated 
lunch or two. A long move ends with Lennon finding Coleman, whose centre is 
blocked.
 
80 min: Osman tries to score from a left-sided position. It goes wide. Carlisle
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> might not mind full-time now.
 
78 min: Carlisle still attempting a foray or two but they’ve been firmly at 
arm’s length throughout. It’sEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> who are pressing, even at 3-0 up.
 
75 min: So does Kone, who twangs the bar! A shot doesn’t seem on as he chases 
the ball towards the byline but he has a go and it flicks off the frame and 
out! Then Barkley is replaced by Darron Gibson and, very sportingly, gets an 
ovation from the home support.
 
74 min: Cleverley does, whipping one not too far wide from 25 yards.
 
73 min: Definitely another goal or two in this for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> if they fancy it.
 
71 min: Dangerous Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> 
free-kick outside the box as Cleverley fouls Hope. Can they throw themselves a 
lifeline? It’s worked to Atkinson but, by the time that’s happened, Osman has 
got out of the wall to smother the shooting chance. A shout or two for 
handball, but nothing given – a little generously to Osman.
 
70 min: Barkley seems to fancy more but this time he opts to feed Lennon, 
after due consideration. A corner is won, but two Everton players get in the 
way of one another when it is played in. Gilliead counters forCarlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> and, if nothing else, manages 
to get the ball 70 yards up the pitch and relieve some pressure.
 
67 min: Slightly surprised the commentary team didn’t realise first time that 
the shot had taken a deflection. Barkley deserved the goal though.
 
Doesn’t take long for Barkley to go one better. Osman finds him on the left 
hand corner of the box, he takes the ball inside and, via a deflection off the 
head of Ellis, finds the top corner. Good hit, and game over.

63 min: Yes, here is Ibehre. He replaces Comley, who has played well. Can he 
fire them to a comeback?
 
63 min: Ibehre is being readied and that has certainly sparked the crowd.
 
61 min: Oh, that would have been another solo goal to add to the Ross Barkley 
collection. He somehow gets through three players before, just as he seems to 
have done the hard work, touching the ball slightly too far and allowing 
Atkinson to block. In the meantime, Pienaar – who hasn’t looked sharp – is 
replaced by Leon Osman.
 
60 min: Lennon cutely plays Coleman in, and he shapes up a left-footed shot 
from just outside the six-yard box. Raynes dives in brilliantly to block a 
certain goal, and Gillespie catches the corner.
 
58 min: I said that about Comley, but he’s now been caught in possession twice 
in a couple of minutes.
 
57 min: Chance for Asamoah! An Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> move breaks down and Hope 
springs Asamoah clear with a sharp ball down the inside left. The striker cuts 
inside, make space, and his shot is deflected not far off target for a corner, 
which is overhit and the danger is cleared.
 
55 min: Barkley tees up Cleverley who has time to line up a shot from range, 
but he skews it and it’s mishit well wide. This half is yet to get going. 
Perhaps it just won’t, andEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>
 will lock things down.
 
54 min: Curle is definitely happy to take risks. He sent Raynes, the 
centre-back, up just now for a free kick that was taken just outside their own 
area.Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> then squandered a 
good chance to counter.
 
52 min: Comley, the midfielder on loan from QPR, definitely has something. 
Snappy in the challenge, likes to drive forward, efficient on the ball. 
Remember The Name.

51 min: Asamoah twists and turns outside the box but Oviedo is wise to all 
that. No early assault fromCarlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> yet, although they do seem to 
have stepped a few yards up the pitch.
 
49 min: Some lengthy treatment from the physio for McCarthy, who is now helped 
up. Looks as if he’s ok but I wonder if he’ll be risked for much longer. 
There’s no need to flog him in the current situation, and he has just come back 
from injury.
 
47 min: Comfortable enough start to the half from Everton but Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> definitely have a few more 
threats on the park now. McCarthy is felled nastily by Kennedy, though, and the 
home player is booked.
 
Hallam Hope, a former Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
scholar, has come on for Gillesphey. Dicker has been replaced by another 
attacker, Alex Gilliead.
 
Changes for Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle>. Looks 
like they’ll switch from a back three to a back four. “Plan B”, says Curle, 
“We’re going to try and attack. We gave them a head start so what we need now 
is a goal to try and make them uncomfortable.”
 
Do you remember Carlisle’s 1974/75 season in the top flight? Whether or not 
you do, here’s a Joy of Six from the archives, penned by Scott Murray, 
detailing that and five other single seasons in the sun:

In other news, the fox is called Olga (thanks for the emails/tweets on that) – 
andHarry Pearson in fact told us the whole story five years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/29/carlisle-olga-the-fox-harry-pearson>
.
 
So far, so straightforward. Keith Curle’s plan to contain and spoil went out 
of the window within two minutes when Kone scored. Asamoah then had a shot 
saved by Robles for the hosts but Lennon made it two soon enough and, to be 
honest, the occasion has all been a bit flat since then. Can the home side come 
out all guns blazing, maybe with another attacker or two introduced? Find out 
shortly...
 
45+1 min: Comley has an ambitious slash from 30 yards – it’s scuffed but 
almost serves as the perfect assist for Kennedy, who seems to have a sight of 
goal for a split second but can’t quite get the ball out from under his feet. 
That could have made things interesting...
 
44 min: Comley then wins the ball superbly from Pienaar, breaks forwards and 
is hauled down by McCarthy. Yellow card, and no complaints.
 
43 min: A sniff there for Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> as, following patient play by 
Dicker, Gillespie arrows in a dangerous delivery from the left that Miller nods 
down into space ... but there’s nobody there to attack the ball.
 
41 min: Oviedo crosses from the left and Kone, on his left foot, is probably a 
bit too careful with his volley. Gillespie gathers with ease.

Yep – just a shame about the score. Lukaku in particular isn’t doing a lot for 
his posture in there.
 
39 min: Asamoah is, generally, pretty short of support here for Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle>. Just picked the ball up in the 
centre circle but had no options really. Is it worth Curle getting Ibehre on at 
the break?
 
37 min: Robles claims a Gillesphey free-kick and releases Lennon with a 
gargantuan throw. A scamper to the byline later and it’s a throw-in – Miller 
gets back very well to defend.
 
36 min: In truth, though, there’s no dressing this up – Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> aren’t bossing possession quite 
as much as earlier but they’re in no real trouble at all.
 
34 min: James McCarthy covers well for Funes Mori, stopping Miller from 
reaching a clip down the right.Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> take a long through but it 
pings off Asamoah’s head and well out.
 
32 min: Now Barkley wins a corner after being stopped in his tracks by the 
increasingly involved Comley. It’s headed away at the near post by Gillesphey.
 
30 min: Comley delivers from the right and Jagielka gets up well to clear. 
Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> have, for the moment, 
dug themselves a bit of a foothold.

29 min: Dicker goes deep to the back post and Ellis wins the header but can’t 
get enough on it to nod back across goal.
 
28 min: Much better from Carlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> at the moment as Asamoah goes 
on another run and feeds Kennedy, who wins a left-sided corner...
 
27 min: The ball is played into the area and drops to Miller, facing away from 
goal 15 yards out, and he panics rather – lofting well over.
 
26 min: Dicker shows some nice skill to start a move in midfield but it breaks 
down and Kone gets away in a dangerous position only to pass beyond Pienaar. 
The home team have at least got a foot or two on the ball in the last couple of 
minutes ... and Asamoah then wins a corner down the right...
 
25 min: Carlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> try and put 
something together, Sweeney holding the ball up on the left, but Gillesphey 
then chips the ball down the line and out of play. Curle picked a 
defensive-looking lineup here but might as well bring an attacker or two 
soonish.

Copestake.
