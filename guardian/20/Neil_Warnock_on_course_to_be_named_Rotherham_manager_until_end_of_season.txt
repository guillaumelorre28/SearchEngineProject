Warnock, who played for the Millers between 1969 and 1971, has been working as 
an adviser atQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, but Press 
Association Sport understands an appointment in South Yorkshire is on course.

The short-term nature of the job is understood to appeal to the 67-year-old, 
who lives in Cornwall.

He will be charged with ensuring Rotherham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rotherham> survive in the second tier, a 
tough task with 16 games of the season remaining.

The Millers are in the relegation zone, three points from safety after 
back-to-back defeats to fellow strugglers Charlton and Bolton.

Those losses cost Redfearn his job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/08/rotherham-sack-manager-neil-redfearn>
 just four months and 21 games into a two-and-a-half year deal, with the 
Millers board acting decisively in a bid to stave off relegation.

Nicky Eaden is currently in caretaker charge of the Millers, less than a week 
after joining the club as Redfearn’s assistant manager.

An appointment could happen before Saturday’s visit of Birmingham, which opens 
a gruelling run of fixtures, where they must play sides currently in the top 
eight in six of their next eight matches.
