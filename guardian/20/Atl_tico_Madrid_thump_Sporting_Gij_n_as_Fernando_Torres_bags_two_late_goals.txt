Griezmann then cut inside to fire in the third goal after 31 minutes before 
being replaced by Torres. The homegrown Atlético hero further delighted the 
Vicente Calderón crowd by rounding off the victory with two late strikes, 
including an injury-time penalty.

“We knew we were doing the right things to score goals,” Torres said. “It’s 
good that all the forwards contributed with the goals and that I could do that 
from the bench. It’s never a good time to visit Barcelona but now we can go 
there feeling confident.”
