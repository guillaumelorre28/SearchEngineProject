Karl, it’s time to delete Choupette’s Instagram account 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2014/sep/01/choupette-private-life-very-public-cat-karl-lagerfeld>
. If cats have ruled social media, YouTube videos and the fronts of jumpers for 
most of the decade, they are finally on their ninth life. And, in a logic that 
could only come from the fashion industry, they are being replaced by 
dinosaurs, creatures that have been extinct for around 65m years. That really 
is retro.

Dinosaurs are on jumpers at Coach, they are on earrings at Céline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/celine> – a sure sign that they really do 
have the fashion pack’s approval (designer Phoebe Philo isn’t the kind for an 
easy lol). At Paul Smith, they cover a jumper and shirt, and there’s even an 
80s-style dino-themedcomputer game 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/paul-smith-dino-jumper/id1127395371?mt=8> that 
you can download. They are also making a play for the plasticflamingo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/jun/24/pretty-in-pink-why-designers-fell-in-love-with-the-flamingo>
’s spot on Instagram – much loved by Taylor Swift and friends. Two balloon 
dinosaurs formed the backdrop to a recent post byAlexa Chung 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung>, a present from fellow 
Instagram it-girl Harley Viera-Newton. And so, 65m yearsLTTP 
<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LTTP>, the dinosaur’s fashion 
moment is finally here.

 Dinosaur jewellery from Céline 
What is it about dinosaurs that works for fashion right now? They are 
nostalgic, in a childhood-day-out-to-the-museum sort of way. They have a 
flawless – instantly recognisable – profile, giving selfie queens such as Kylie 
Jenner a run for her money. And they are that other thing that fashion likes – 
rare or, in fact, nonexistent in this case.

@HVN surprised me with some Dino dream balloons! :-))) xxx

Of course, as with everything in fashion, there are favourites. It’s all about 
Tyrannasaurus rex 
<http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dinosaurs/images/0/00/Outrun-t-rex-orig.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150213222749>
 – possibly the creature with the strongest bite of any animal ever, and so 
definitely alpha – as seen on the Coach sweater worn by Winona Ryder and 
friends, those earrings at Céline, and the shirt at Paul Smith. The more 
loveable – and even bigger –diplodocus 
<http://cornucopia3d.e-oncontent.com/storeItems/Objects/Animals/Prehistoric/Diplodocus_Vue_3_1_img.jpg>
 is also on the fashion-approved list, as seen in Alexa’s balloons.

 Dinosaur jeans by Kuccia at Topshop 
Now they are in fashion, dinosaurs look set to go forth and multiply. At 
Topshop, there is the whole gang – the pterodactyl, stegosaurus and 
triceratops, with added sequins – ona pair of mom jeans designed by Kuccia 
<http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/sequin-dinosaur-mom-jeans-by-kuccia-5937726?geoip=noredirect&cmpid=ppc_pla_UK_ip&utm_medium=cpc&tsrc=vdna&istCompanyId=38aa0d7f-6514-4cb3-bbdc-df0d32d48b7f&istItemId=xxalrpmlll&istBid=tztx&gclid=CO_F-cPQqtACFYdAGwod-FMFmA&gclsrc=aw.ds>
. You can’t imagine that theaverage paleontologist 
<http://www.rationalitynow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/08_Paleontologist.jpg>
 would approve, but still. T-rex emojis complete with hearts for eyes are only 
a matter of time.
