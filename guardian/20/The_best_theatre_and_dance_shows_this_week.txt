Five of the best theatre shows this week

1 Trouble In Mind
Tanya Moodie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/16/rsc-tanya-moodie-hamlet-gertrude-royal-shakespeare-theatre>
 turns in another wonderful performance in this rare revival of Alice 
Childress’s 1955 off-Broadway satirical play-within-a-play. It’s fascinating 
for the way it glancingly juxtaposes the McCarthy witch-hunts – with their 
skewered take on truth-telling – with the attitudes of white liberals who say 
one thing about race but think something different. Every performance is a 
pleasure in Laurence Boswell’s subtle production.
Theatre Royal: Ustinov Studio, Bath, to Saturday 17 Dec

2 Beasty Baby
Can a show for three- to six-year-olds deliver an experience that is as 
satisfying for adults as it is for the tinies? You bet it can, asTheatre-Rites 
<http://www.theatre-rites.co.uk/> revives one of the best shows of the year, 
about a baby who turns from bundle of joy to tyrannous tantrum-thrower in the 
space of two years. The puppetry is a total delight in an insightful, 
multilayered show that’s beady-eyed about small children’s disruptive nature.
Lakeside Arts Centre, Nottingham, Tue to Saturday 31 Dec

3 Shakespeare Trilogy
The Donmar’s all-female productions of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The 
Tempest, set in a women’s prison, are a startling achievement bydirector 
Phyllida Lloyd <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/phyllida-lloyd> and actor 
Harriet Walter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/18/harriet-walter-guy-paul-boa-interview>
, who is a troubled Brutus, a Henry IV who finds the crown really is heavy and 
a Prospero who knows that there are many kinds of imprisonment. But these are 
very much ensemble productions boasting a genuinely diverse cast; great 
individually, cumulatively astonishing.
Donmar At King’s Cross, N1, to Saturday 17 Dec 
<https://www.donmaratkingscross.com/get-tickets/trilogy-days>

4 School Of Rock
Who would have thought that the 2003 movie starring Jack Black 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/23/features.review> as a phony 
substitute teacher helping results-focused kids find their creativity would 
provideAndrew Lloyd Webber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/andrew-lloyd-webber> with a fresh hit, and 
one that might be remembered as one of his best? It’s a real belter, 
benefitting from an electric young cast, a winning performance from David Flynn 
as would-be rock star Mr Finn, and an exuberant score.
New London Theatre, WC2, to Sunday 9 Apr 
<http://reallyuseful.seetickets.com/WEBPAGES/EntaWebShow/ShowPerformance.aspx>

5 The Tempest


Simon Russell Beale <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/simon-russell-beale> 
played Ariel in 1993, and now – more than 20 years on – he is a heart-breaking 
Prospero consumed by guilt. It adds an emotional undertow in an evening that 
uses special effects and digital technology to create Prospero’s magic with 
varying degrees of success, but without detracting from Beale’s central 
performance as a flawed human trying to do the right thing but knowing that he 
has failed in the past.LG
Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, to Saturday 21 Jan
