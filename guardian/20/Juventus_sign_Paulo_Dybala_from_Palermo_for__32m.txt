Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> have completed the 
signing of Palermo’s Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala for a fee of €32m, 
potentially rising to €40m, on a five-year contract.

Dybala, who moved to Palermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> in 
2012 from his home club Instituto, scored 13 times in 34 Serie A appearances 
this season, and the club had been keen to cash in on the 21-year-old, who 
turned down a contract extension in January.

“A fee of €32m, payable over four years, has been agreed, with a potential 
extra €8m to be added on if certain performance-related targets are met,” read 
a club statement.
