The Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> manager, Mark 
Cooper, has left the club following Saturday’s defeat at Millwall.

Cooper, 46, steered Swindon to the League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> play-offs last season, 
but a 2-0 loss at the New Den has left them without a league win in six matches 
and one point above the relegation zone.

The club said via Twitter: “Swindon Town Football Club have [on Saturday] 
evening parted company with manager, Mark Cooper. A full statement from the 
football club will be made on Monday.”

Cooper, whose squad have been hit by injuries to key players this season, 
chose not to take charge at Sheffield Wednesday in the summer and is understood 
to have also turned down Barnsley.

He has worked with a limited budget since being appointed as Kevin McDonald’s 
successor at the County Ground in the summer of 2013 following a brief spell as 
assistant manager.

Cooper steered Swindon to fourth place in League One last season and after 
beating Sheffield United in the play-off semi-finals they lost out to Preston 
in the final.

But the sale of key players such as Ben Gladwin and Massimo Luongo in the 
summer and a spate of injuries have seen the Robins win only three of their 12 
league games this season.

Cooper, son of former Leeds and England defender Terry, started out in 
management at Tamworth and has had spells in charge of Kettering (twice), 
Peterborough, Darlington and Telford.
