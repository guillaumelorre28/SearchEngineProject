Mathieu Debuchy has joined Bordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> on loan for the remainder of 
the season. Arsène Wenger has long made it plain that he would let the 
right-back out in January to seek regular football, to fire his case for 
inclusion in the France squad for Euro 2016.

Earlier on Monday, the Arsenal manager suggested that the 30-year-old would 
make the temporary switch to a Premier League club, with Aston Villa and 
Sunderland keen. But, after training withArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> in the morning, he has ended up 
at Bordeaux.

Debuchy joined Arsenal from Newcastle United in July 2014 for £12m but his 
first season at the club was undermined by serious injuries, first to his ankle 
and then to his shoulder – both of which required surgery.

He lost his place in the team to Héctor Bellerín and this season he has been 
on the periphery, making only seven appearances and often looking off the pace 
when selected. He is desperate to rediscover his pre-injury form and rhythm in 
order to make Didier Deschamps’ squad for the Euro finals this summer.

Wenger has also loaned the striker Yaya Sanogo to Charlton Athletic for the 
rest of the season. The 23-year-old had spent the first half of the campaign on 
loan at Ajax but he made only four appearances.

Arsenal profited last season when the midfielder Francis Coquelin spent a 
period on loan at Charlton. When he was recalled, Coquelin went straight into 
the Arsenal team and he has not looked back since.
