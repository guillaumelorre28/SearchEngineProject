People, in general, would rather not eat whole fish. This may sound like a 
sweeping statement, but anyone in the restaurant business will tell you that 
customers are vastly less likely to order a whole fried bream than two seared 
fillets. You hear two common explanations: “I don’t like looking my food in the 
eye,” and, “Eating a whole fish is just too messy.” In short, it’s all too 
fishy.

While I respect people’s preferences, I am afraid we don’t see eye to eye 
here. For me, losing the head and the tail means also losing out on some 
extraordinary flavours and super-crisp textures; in fact, with many fish, fried 
heads, tails and even bones, drizzled with a drop of lemon juice, are heavenly.

If, however, you are completely set on avoiding all the visceral stuff, the 
solution is simple: a fishcake.

The beauty of a fishcake, by which I mean any dish made of chopped-up fish 
(squidgy Thai tod mun pla, Turkish balik koftesi, Jewish gefilte fish, British 
flaky potato-based cakes, South American ceviche) is that it allows the fish to 
mix with all sorts of other ingredients and absorb their flavours, resulting in 
some wonderfully surprising combinations. In many cases, the fish turns into 
something far more textural, while its flavour stays in the background, gently 
holding everything together.

I had a great example of this on a tiny fishing boat off the coast of 
Essaouira in Morocco, when a couple of local fisherman minced whole freshly 
caught sardines, mixed them with local bread, shaped them into balls and 
quickly cooked them with tomatoes, cumin and preserved lemon. The sardines, 
with all their natural intensity, just bowed down to the acidity of the 
tomatoes and the lemon, creating a memorable yet subtle experience, not fishy 
at all.

Polenta-crusted fishcakes with spicy tomato and tarragon sauce


Serves four as a starter (12 cakes).

350g skinless and boneless firm white fish, cut into 3cm chunks
1 egg, beaten
1½ tsp ground cumin
¼ tsp chilli flakes
3 garlic cloves, crushed
150g cooked potato, roughly mashed (1 medium potato) 
10g parsley, roughly chopped
10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus a few small leaves to garnish
40g quick-cook polenta
About 150ml sunflower oil, for frying
Salt
For the sauce
60ml olive oil
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 red chilli, de-seeded, finely chopped
4 ripe tomatoes, blanched, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tsp caster sugar
5g tarragon, roughly chopped

First make the sauce. Pour the oil into a small saucepan and place on a medium 
heat. Add the garlic and chilli and fry for one or two minutes, until the 
garlic turns golden. Add the tomatoes, sugar and a third of a teaspoon of salt 
and cook on a low heat for about 15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Set 
aside until ready to serve, stirring in the tarragon at the last minute.

To make the fishcakes, place the fish in the bowl of a food processor and add 
the egg, cumin, chilli, garlic and a half-teaspoon of salt. Pulse several times 
to break the fish into small pieces. Don’t overdo it, though: you don’t want it 
to turn to mush.

Transfer everything to a large mixing bowl, add the potato and herbs and 
gently stir everything together. Use your hands to form 12 balls, about 45g 
each. Place the polenta in a shallow bowl and roll the balls in it to coat them.

Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pour enough oil into a medium saute 
pan that it rises 1cm up the sides. Place on a medium heat and, when hot, add 
half the fishcakes. Fry for about four minutes, turning so they become 
golden-brown on all sides. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and repeat 
with the remaining cakes. Place in the oven for five minutes, to cook through. 
Serve warm with the sauce, heated up if needed, spooned on top or alongside. 
Garnish with coriander leaves, if you like.

Smoked fish and parsnip cakes


I love these for breakfast, but they’re good at any time. If you don’t want to 
make the cream, serve with a wedge of lemon instead. Serves four.

4-5 parsnips (550g) 
260g smoked cod or haddock fillets, skinless and boneless, chopped into 4cm 
pieces
25g fresh white breadcrumbs (about 1 thin slice of bread, crust removed)
5g dill, roughly chopped
5g chives, roughly chopped
10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
4 spring onions, finely chopped
Finely grated zest of ½ lemon
1 egg, lightly whisked
1 tsp caraway seeds, toasted and roughly crushed
20g unsalted butter
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper
For the horseradish cream
2 tbsp finely grated fresh horseradish (or 1 tbsp horseradish sauce)
150g soured cream
2 tsp lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Mix together the ingredients for the 
horseradish cream with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of 
black pepper. Keep in the fridge until needed.

Place the parsnips on a small baking tray and roast for 30-35 minutes, until 
cooked through and soft. Once cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the 
skin. Place the flesh in a large bowl (you should have 270g cooked parsnip) 
roughly mash and set aside to cool.

Place the fish in a food processor and pulse a few times (you want it roughly 
chopped rather than minced) then add to the parsnip, with a half-teaspoon of 
salt, plenty of pepper and the remaining ingredients apart from the oil and 
butter. Mix well and form into eight patties: they should be about 8cm wide and 
2-3cm thick. At this stage you could cover the patties and refrigerate until 
ready to cook, up to 24 hours ahead of time.

Add the butter and oil to a large frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. 
Once the butter starts to foam, add the patties and fry for six to eight 
minutes, turning over halfway through, until the fish is cooked and the patties 
are golden-brown. Serve warm, with a spoonful of the horseradish cream 
alongside. 

Mediterranean ceviche


Pictured overleaf. The perfect summer starter, needing little more than bread 
alongside. Serves four.

3 small sea bass fillets, skinless and boneless, cut widthways into 2mm-wide 
slivers (240g)
2 tbsp olive oil
Finely grated zest of ½ small lemon, plus 2 tsp juice
1 small garlic clove, crushed
1 small preserved lemon, skin and flesh roughly chopped
20g pine nuts
½ plum tomato, cut into ½cm dice
25g pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped
15g small nonpareille capers, or larger ones, chopped
2 spring onions, finely sliced 
1 red chilli, finely diced
5g parsley leaves, finely chopped
10g basil leaves, finely shredded
Sea salt flakes and black pepper

Place the fish in a medium bowl with two teaspoons of oil, the lemon zest, 
garlic and a half-teaspoon of salt. Mix well and set aside for 10 minutes while 
you make the salad; at this stage you can also refrigerate the fish for up to 
two hours.

Mash together the preserved lemon skin and flesh using a pestle and mortar and 
set aside.

Place the pine nuts in a small frying pan with a teaspoon of oil. Fry on a 
medium heat for three to four minutes, stirring frequently, until golden-brown. 
Add to the preserved lemon and briefly grind so some are left whole and some 
are roughly crushed. Spoon into a medium bowl and mix with the tomato, olives, 
capers, spring onions, chilli, parsley, basil, two teaspoons of oil, a teaspoon 
of lemon juice, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and plenty of black pepper.

Divide the fish between four plates, spreading it out in a circle about 12cm 
wide. Spoon over the salad, making sure that some of the fish can still be seen 
around the edges. Drizzle each portion with a quarter-teaspoon of oil and a 
quarter-teaspoon of lemon juice and serve, with a final sprinkle of salt.
