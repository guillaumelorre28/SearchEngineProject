<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> United manager with two

He was nominated for the League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> manager of the month 
award in March after a run of just two losses in six matches.

However, too much work was left to be done and he leaves the club second from 
bottom in the table and with relegation to League Two confirmed following last 
weekend’s 3-0 home defeat to Burton.

A statement on the club’s website 
<http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/colchester-united-kevin-keen-leaves-us-3081309.aspx>
 read: “After a meeting with the owner, Robbie Cowling, over the future 
direction of the club, Kevin Keen has decided to leave Colchester United with 
immediate effect.

“Kevin has worked tirelessly to try and turn around the fortunes of the club 
this season. We wish Kevin all the best in his future career.

“David Wright has agreed to take the team for the remaining two games of the 
current season.”
