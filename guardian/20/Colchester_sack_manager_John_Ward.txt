Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> United have 
sacked their manager John Ward following their poor start to the season.

The Us are winless so far this season and have picked up only four points from 
their opening eightLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> games, with Saturday's 
1-0 defeat at fellow strugglers Scunthorpe United proving the final straw.

Ward has been managing the club since May 2010 and has taken Colchester to 
back-to-back top-10 finishes in the division.

Joe Dunne has been appointed as the caretaker manager ahead of this weekend's 
match at home to Hartlepool.

The club's chairman, Robbie Cowling, said in a statement: "In so many areas 
John Ward will leave Colchester United in a better position than when he first 
took over as first-team manager.

"So much of Colchester United is better than it has ever been, but sadly that 
is not being reflected in first-team results and the board has decided that 
this action is required to stop the negativity of the on-field results 
impacting on the other areas of the club that have also been drastically 
improved.

"I would like to thank John Ward for his time in charge. He has done more for 
Colchester United than many people realise, and the board of Colchester United 
and especially myself would like to wish him all of the very best for the 
future.

"Joe Dunne has agreed to take over in the short term and I am sure that 
everyone will give Joe their full support."

Ward leaves the Essex club having won 33 of his 111 games in charge and with 
the team 22nd in League One.
