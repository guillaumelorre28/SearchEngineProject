Goal! Manchester City 3-2 Watford (Kolarov)

What's the first rule of goalkeeping? Keep your legs closed, right? Well try 
telling that to Watford's Bond who has just let one squirm through his stalks 
after a Alex Kolarov effort from a decent way out.

Goal! Port Vale 1-3 Brighton

Obika's right footed shot from the centre of the box finds the the top left 
corner of the goal.


4.39pm GMT 

Goal! Manchester City 2-2 Watford (Aguero)

The fairytale has turned into a nightmare with Sergio Aguero playing the role 
of the wicked witch. He ends a flowing move with flowing move with a most 
perfect finish. Can Watford hang on for a replay?


4.37pm GMT 

Goal! Wigan 1-1 Crystal Palace (Wilbraham)

A corner, a bit of a goalmouth scramble and a scrappy piece of play ends with 
a goal for Palace. Wilbraham won't care and neither will Tony Pulis.


4.35pm GMT 

City have thrown on a shed load of subs but they are still losing to Watford. 
There is about 15 or so minutes left and by all accounts, it is all City, it is 
all pressure on Watford and it is all backs to the wall.


4.32pm GMT 

"Blimey," writes Richard Rae, "cowering in the stand at Stevenage. Hail, heavy 
rain, wind, lightning - it seems safe to say Everton will attempt to dispose of 
lower league opposition in conditions somewhat different to the balmy sunshine

do with the presence of Andy Gray myself

Goal! Rochdale 1-2 Sheffield Wednesday (Rose)

There is hope for Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> and 
there is hope because Rose has absolutely hammered one home from a good 25 
yards out after the ball was blown out to him by a rather strong gust of wind.

currently The Rangers 1-2 Arbroath." Oh my.

A clinical finish just inside the area means that the fightback is on.

Goal! Rochdale 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday (Mattock)
 Wednesday are unbeaten in seven and that might well be eight now that Mattock 
has put them into the lead at Spotland. 
4.09pm GMT 

Phil was ready to grab the M-I-C and serenade the crowd when he saw Timlin 
lift back his leg and strike the ball from all of 25-yards, only for the 
woodwork to get in the way. Still goalless at Southend then.


4.06pm GMT 

"Simon McMahon surely underestimates the memorability of the East Fife v 
Forfar result, which is surelythe greatest memorable classified check result of 
all time!" reckons Robin Hazlehurst. "In a field of one, admittedly, but even 
so, don't belittle it."

Can Watford hang on?

Goal! Wigan 1-0 Crystal Palace (Watson)

Another shock(ish) is on the cards. A lovely move down the left-hand side is 
finished by Watson, who, of course, is playing against his former club. 
Remember, Wigan have lost 10 and won none of their last 11FA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> games against teams from a higher 
division.

Where you wondering  what chief MBM correspondent Gary Naylor is up to this 
Saturday afternoon? Well wonder no more. He emails: "﻿﻿﻿The FA Cup may have 
lost much of its romance, but it still has considerably more of it than IKEA 
Croydon where I am drinking keenly priced, if hideous, coffee and catching the 
free Wifi. I'm not sure I'd be here if I were living every day as if it were my

Goal! Manchester City 0-2 Watford (Deeney)

Oh my. Troy Deeney will never have to buy a pint or pay for a meal in the

Big interview

There were supporters getting tattoos of my name. Every home game, 50,000 
people, on their feet, shouting 'Super Guidetti'. Everyone doing this 
[mimicking a two-handed bowing-down gesture]. They made a rap song and put me 
in it. 'Look at Messi, we have Guidetti.'

There are many accusations you could (probably) level at John Guidetti but 
false modesty is certainly not one of them. Daniel Taylor has had a chin wag

Well, well here we are again

Once upon a time not long ago, people wore pyjamas and lived life slow, laws 
were stern and justice stood and people were behaving like they ought ta good.
Ah those were the days. Kids could play out on the street, music wasn't a big 
load of trashy old noise and the FA Cup – oh, the FA Cup! – was a competition. "
I was there in '66 when Everton came from behind 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEztFITXdxU> and that fella ran across the 
pitch and he being chased by the copper," nostalgias the old codger in the bar, 
butting in on an A and B conversation that he should really C his way out of. 
"That was when it was a competition. Not like that now, of course. There's too 
much money elsewhere. Players and managers don't care no more." He's right – 
he's been right for years – but maybe this year he won't be. Maybe this year 
will be different. Maybe this year, there'll be a team that grabs the Cup by 
the ears and shakes it back into life. Maybe there'll be a team that performs 
the footballing equivalent of the Mighty Ducks and we are all left with salty 
tears in our eyes and a new found optimism in our hearts. Maybe it'll be 
Southend. Or maybe it'll be Rochdale? Or Port Vale? Or Kidderminster? Or maybe 
Manchester City will win it?

Birmingham v Swansea
