Reuters, the news and information group, is to sponsor the BMW Williams 
formula one team over the next three years to reach a mass audience.

Financial details of the deal, which Reuters hopes will boost its global brand 
image, have been kept under wraps.

Explaining the decision to undertake the group's biggest sports sponsorship, 
Jean-Claude Marchand, chief executive of Reuters' global sales and operations, 
said: "With the advent of the internet we want to communicate the strength of 
the Reuters brand with more impact; formula one sponsorship is a good means of 
achieving this goal."

The agreement was unveiled in Munich yesterday - as was the new BMW Williams 
car with Ralf Schumacher at the wheel.

Under the agreement the Reuters name will appear on the cars, the drivers' and 
mechanics' overalls, and on the wall of the pit garage.

BMW is the main partner of the team from 2000 onwards, returning to formula 
one after 13 years. Williams has a successful track record in formula one 
racing. It has won nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' 
championships.
