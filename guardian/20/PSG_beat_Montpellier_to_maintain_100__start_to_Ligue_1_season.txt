.

Blaise Matuidi scored the only goal just after the hour to make it three wins 
out of three for PSG, who moved three points ahead of Reims and Caen. PSG also 
had two goals disallowed for offside.

Montpellier <https://www.theguardian.com/football/montpellier-football-team> 
had their own chances but could not find their first goal of the season, so 
remain bottom of the table with no points.

The only sour note of the night for PSG involved Javier Pastore limping off 
with a calf injury. PSG were already without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, √Ångel Di Maria 
and Marco Verratti.
