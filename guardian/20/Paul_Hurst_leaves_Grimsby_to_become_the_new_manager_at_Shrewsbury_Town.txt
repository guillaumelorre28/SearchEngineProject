Club since his appointment in March 2011. He will forever be remembered as the 
manager who successfully saw the return of this club to the Football League. He 
leaves the club in a strong position and we wish him well for the future.

“Assistant manager Chris Doig will be joining Paul at Shrewsbury and again we 
thank Chris for his work for the club. Our attention now turns to the
