Best known for his film work with Mike Leigh (All or Nothing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/oct/20/philipfrench>, Vera Drake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jan/09/features.review7>) and TV 
roles inRed Riding and Ashes to Ashes, Daniel Mays, 37, stars in Patrick 
Marber’s new playThe Red Lion 
<http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-red-lion> – a three-hander about 
the world of non-league football – at the National Theatre.

This is Patrick Marber’s first new play in nine years, isn’t it?
Yes. I’ve had opportunities to work at the National in the past but the timing 
wasn’t right. Then out of the blue, the director,Ian Rickson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/25/ian-rickson-director>, whom I 
worked with in the West End onMojo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/13/mojo-review>, phoned me and 
said: “We’ve got a project, take a look.” I just thought it was an unbelievable 
read, one of the best new plays I’ve read for a long time.

Tells us about your character, football manager Jimmy Kidd.
He thinks he’s the José Mourinho of the non-league. He finds a young, 
brilliant player and it’s a titanic battle between him and the ageing kit man, 
played by Peter Wight, who has a more romantic view of the game, for the soul 
of this young player. Jimmy embodies the backstabbing greed and the malicious 
side of the game, which is in the papers all the time now about Fifa. He’s a 
monstrous creation and yet through the brilliance of the writing we’re able to 
open the character up and see he has redeeming qualities. A huge factor in this 
play is the absence of father figures. Outside the world of the club, Jimmy’s 
life is in turmoil. He had a very abusive and difficult relationship with his 
dad, he’s going through a divorce, he’s at the lowest ebb you could possibly 
find someone, he’s kipping on friends’ carpets, and yet if he can win a game of 
football, that’s really what he was put on this earth to do.

In real life, Marber helped to rescue the semi-pro club Lewes FC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/22/patrick-marber-boardroom-lewes>
 from liquidation. Did you get to meet the players?
We spent time at both Lewes FC and my local club, Wingate and Finchley FC. 
It’s been great going around these non-league teams. They’re on the breadline 
with minuscule budgets. They’re not the Chelseas and Liverpools, yet they have 
absolute passion.

Will non-football fans relate to the play?
Absolutely. I can’t stress that enough. Football is just the gateway. When you 
get into the second act, it really becomes about these three individual men and 
the very universal themes of betrayal, loss and ambition. We see how 
co-dependent they are and how much vulnerability they have. Patrick is a master 
at shining a light on certain aspects of ourselves that we probably wouldn’t 
share. It’s about how men can wound or heal each other – I find it a profoundly 
moving and poignant piece.
