The end of the summer is an occasion that surely deserves to be marked with a 
celebratory drink. And what could be more redolent of summer sunshine than that 
stone-cold tropical classic, the planter’s punch? As with many old recipes, 
there is no definitive version – the planter’s is a pleasingly laid-back affair 
that goes by many names, depending on where you are in the Caribbean … but, 
however horizontal things get, there are a few non-negotiables.

For a start, it is always rum-based; this is a drink that apparently had its 
origins in Jamaica, at a time when rum was both cheap and in need of a little 
help in the flavour department in the form of two other local crops: lime juice 
and sugar. The results were so refreshing – and delicious – that it’s still 
popular, even though its main ingredient is now smooth enough to be sipped 
solo. From these simple beginnings, the planter’s punch has evolved into a tiki 
bar fantasy, bright with fruit and bristling with umbrellas. Is less more in 
this instance – or is more always merrier?

Originally, this would have generally been made with dark Jamaica rum, and 
most modern recipes still call for this. Cocktail guru Dale DeGroff, though, 
uses a mixture of dark and light in his book The Craft of the Cocktail, and the 
17th-century recipe quoted in Larousse Cocktails suggests an amber variety. 
Meanwhile, Difford’s Guide: 365 Days of Cocktails recommends the lethal 
overproof kind that I can find only in a white incarnation.

Although golden rum is my usual drink of choice, here I think the dark sort 
makes more sense; its treacly, molasses quality stands up well to the other 
ingredients. Clean-cut white rum drowns in the welter of sweet and sour, and 
even the more emphatic demerara-like qualities of golden are wasted; a rum 
punch demands a blunderbuss in the form of the dark stuff.


DeGroff also uses orange curaçao, another quintessentially Caribbean drink, 
but one that seems like gilding the lily. The only boozy note required in a 
planter’s punch is rum, and lots of it.

In the fine tradition of thirst-quenching tropical pours, it also has a hefty 
acidic element, which is traditionally provided by lime juice.A recipe in the 
September 1878 issue of the British magazine Fun 
<http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00078627/00033/93j> calls for lemon, but I assume that 
is because they were more easily available in Victorian Britain (although I’m 
willing to stand corrected). Gary Regan’s The Joy of Mixology and Trader Vic’s 
use both, but I can’t see the point, when the keener, greener sharpness of the 
lime plays off so well against the sweeter elements.


The bitters

A popular addition, although not mentioned in the oldest recipes. Most modern 
versions call for the iconic Angostura bitters, but Regan also adds a dash of 
the sweeter, lighter New Orleans classic, Peychaud’s. Perhaps more delicate 
palates than ours would be able to pick this detail up, but as long as you 
include some sort of bitter element, the exact kind isn’t too important.

Although he deploys two kinds of bitters, Regan is unusual in choosing not to 
balance them with sugar, preferring to stick with fruit juices (of which more 
later). Stephen Remsberg, a rum collectorwhose recipe is published on the 
Serious Eats website 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/planters-punch-cocktail-recipe.html>
, uses sugar syrup, that bartending staple also favoured by DeGroff and 
Difford’s Guide. Trader Vic’s and Fun magazine prefer straight sugar, but 
making a sugar solution doesn’t take more than five minutes, and it mixes far 
more easily into the drink. Eschew sugar altogether and you’ll end up with a 
mouth-puckeringly acidic result.


DeGroff, Larousse and Trader Vic’s use grenadine syrup to give what David 
Wondrich, writing in Esquire, calls a “crazy colour” and a red-berry sweetness. 
It feels appropriately gaudy, but the fruity flavour changes the character of 
the drink, robbing it of its simplicity.

The oldest recipes are watered down by the simplest means available – water. 
DeGroff prefers sparkling soda water, and also adds both orange and pineapple 
juice for good measure, while Regan goes for orange and grapefruit, which, 
while they point up the bitter notes in his recipe, again distract from the key 
flavours of rum, lime and sugar. If you want a long, sweet, fruity drink, then 
DeGroff’s is the one to go for, but water makes for a more refreshing 
experience.

 Trader Vic’s rum punch: stir over crushed ice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for 
the Guardian 
The recipes I try are fairly evenly split between those that stir the drink 
over crushed ice, such as Remsberg, Larousse and Trader Vic’s, and those that 
shake it and then serve it on the rocks (Regan and DeGroff), with Fun making no 
mention of ice at all, again perhaps because it wasn’t likely to be widely 
available to its readers. I want to minimise dilution here, to keep the punch 
as cold, but as punchy as possible, so I suggest stirring it over ice cubes, 
and then serving it over the same.


The garnish

For a drink so popular in venues, including beach bars and tiki 
establishments, not normally known for their decorative restraint, I’m 
surprised to find that so few of the recipes suggest a garnish – Regan keeps 
things disappointingly simple with a sprig of mint, while DeGroff and Difford’s 
Guide make more of an effort with a classic orange and maraschino combo, which 
always looks unapologetically cheerful.

My favourite extra, however, is Regan’s final grating of nutmeg, which reminds 
me of the killer punches served in Barbados – the peppery spice is the perfect 
match with the dark rum, picking up its heat and sweetness.

Ratios

The oldest recipes seem to come in the form of easily memorisable rhymes – one 
quoted in the New York Times in 1908 calls for: “Two [measures] of sour, one 
and a half of sweet, three of strong and four of weak”, while Fun directs the 
reader to

A wine-glass with lemon juice fill,
Of sugar the same glass fill twice
Then rub them together until
The mixture looks smooth, soft and nice.
Of rum then three wine glasses add,
And four of cold water please take. A
Drink then you’ll have that’s not bad –
At least, so they say in Jamaica. 

Larousse follows the same sort of ratios, which give an easy-drinking, but 
still defiantly poky punch.

More modern punches, with the exception of DeGroff’s juice-heavy version, tend 
to be somewhat stronger, with Remsberg and Trader Vic’s both calling for three 
parts rum to one part sugar and 0.75 parts lime juice. Testers find the rum 
slightly overpowering in both; this should be a drink to be sipped slowly in a 
hammock, not gulped down in shock. Take it easy, and enjoy.

Perfect rum punch

(makes one drink)

75ml dark rum
50ml sugar syrup
25ml lime juice (about 1.5 limes)
100ml cold water
Couple of dashes of bitters
Nutmeg, to garnish
Gaudy garnish of choice, eg pineapple slice, glace cherry, lime wedge

Put the rum, sugar syrup, lime juice and cold water into a tall glass with ice 
and the bitters (or jug, if making multiple drinks) and stir to combine.

Strain into a smaller cold glass half-full of ice, top with a grating of 
nutmeg and gaudy garnish to taste.

Planter’s punch, rum punch, creole punch – whatever you call it, how do you 
make yours? And if you’re not a rum punch fan, what is your summer drink of 
choice?
