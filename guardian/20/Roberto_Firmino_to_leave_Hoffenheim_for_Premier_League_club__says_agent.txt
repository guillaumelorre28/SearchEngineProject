“All I can say is that he’s moving to England,” Wittmann told Germany’s Bild 
newspaper. It may take a while before a deal is announced, though, since the
Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> international is current 
representing his country at the Copa América.

However, all of the formalities – including a medical – are likely to be 
completed while Firmino is in South America to enable him to complete what is 
likely to be a club record transfer for the Bundesliga side.

Their most expensive transfer to date was the sale of Carlos Eduardo to Rubin 
Kazan for €20m (£14.5m).

Firmino, who scored seven Bundesliga goals last season, is valued between 
€25-30m.
