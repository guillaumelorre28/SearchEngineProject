Borussia Mönchengladbach have drawn 1-1 with Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/23/borussia-monchengladbach-v-manchester-city-champions-league-live>
. That result propels the German side into the Europa League with a third-place 
finish in Group C and leaves Celtic on the outside of European football looking 
in.

Full time: Celtic 0-2 Barcelona

There is the final whistle and Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are your official Group C 
winners, sealing passage to the knockout stage ahead of Manchester City, who 
finish second. It was a fairly pedestrian victory for the Spanish champions 
tonight despite a brave challenge from the hosts.

83 min: Messi with a mazy run through a gaggle of Celtic defenders before 
slipping a pass to Suarez, whose shot from point-blank range surely should have 
been a thirdBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> goal.

79 min: Rakutic wins a corner and takes it for Barca, but nothing comes of it.

the area and Ter Stegen makes the save. Best attempt of the day for the hosts 
so far.

GOAL! Celtic 0-1 Barcelona (Messi, 24 min)

A typically beautiful goal as the ball is played across the area to Neymar at 
the corner of the area, who picks out an onrushing Messi and lobs the ball into 
the perfect spot for the Argentine striker to deliver it inside the near post 
past the keeper from short range. Simply sublime.

22 min: Gomes has a go on goal but it’s out for a Barca corner. Neymar plays 
it short to the near post, not entirely intentionally it seems, but it causes 
confusion and a scary moment forCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> before it goes out for another 
corner. Neymar plays it short again but this time it’s cleared past the halfway 
line.

19 min: Jordi Alba makes a well-timed run onto a through ball into the area 
near the left side of the goal and plays it to the far post, where Rakitic 
tries to head it on goal but misses the target. Probably the best chance of the 
match for either side so far.

14 min: A poor pass by Ter Stegen goes straight to Sinclair, who’s been 
excellent today, but he fails to make Barca immediately pay. Celtic manage to 
keep it in the final third for another half minute, but there’s nowhere to go 
for Armstrong and he’s ultimately dispossessed and the Spanish champions go to 
work again. Meanwhile, tens of thousands ofCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> supporters are singing The Fields 
of Athenry in full throat.

8 min: A note from Jim Lines, via email:

Yes, FCB have a sponsorship deal with Replay Jeans, resulting in the South 
American triumvirate and the La Masia production line arriving at games clothed 
in denim. As someone who was once so enchanted by themas que un club culture, 
this sartorial sacrifice saddens me.

7 min: More from Sinclair, who plays it into the Barca area toward Dembele 
before it’s headed beyond the goal line for a corner. Sinclair takes it but 
it’s quickly cleared out of danger.

6 min: Sinclair takes on two Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defenders and slaloms around 
them into the area before he’s dispossessed. A moment of inspiration from the 
Celtic winger! They’ll need more of those.

4 min: Celtic pressing high up early on, but Barca have kept possession in the 
minutes since and are probing the hosts from the middle third. A momentary 
threat as Neymar carries the ball into the area and centers it to Messi, but he 
leaves it andCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> clear it 
safely out of danger.

Hello and welcome to today’s group-stage match between Celtic and Barcelona at 
Parkhead. It wasn’t a particularly pretty scene when these teams met earlier in 
the competition and the Spanish championscruised in a 7-0 laugher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/barcelona-celtic-champions-league-match-report>
 at the Camp Nou, but Brendan Rodgers has told Celticthey must forget the past 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/22/brendan-rodgers-celtic-barcelona-champions-league>
 and create new memories today:

We can’t live in the past. In order to get a result against a team at this 
level you need to bring your A-game. You need to play the game of your life and 
hope you get that bit of luck.

...

They are arguably the best team that’s ever played, with the great players 
they have and the level they can play at. I was bitterly disappointed how 
easily we conceded the goals inBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. We gave away disappointing 
goals at the end which put a shine on the scoreline.

I think two months down the line we’re a better team, we’re a stronger team 
mentally, we had to grow mentally and we’ve shown we’ve done that.

The game itself, what will it be? It’s probably going to be they’ll have more 
possession but as individuals and collectively I’d like to think we’ll be much 
harder and more robust to play against this time.

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will need a win either 
today or in the group-stage finale against Manchester City for a chance of a 
compensatory place in the Europa League after Christmas.

Plenty more to come with kickoff roughly a half hour from now.

Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Ewan Murray on a Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> talent who didn’t quite make it:

Tony Watt lasted 80 minutes of the game between Hamilton Academical and Heart 
of Midlothian on Monday. The only surprise for the 2,339 in attendance was that 
theHearts <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> forward featured for 
that long. Watt could barely have been less effective, just as he could not 
have looked any less interested.

Watt’s struggle had sadly poetic timing. With Barcelona back in Scotland for a 
meeting with Celtic, memories are inevitably conjured of7 November 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/07/celtic-barcelona-champions-league-report>
. It was then Watt, as an 18-year-old substitute, burst through before blasting 
home the crucial second goal as Neil Lennon’s team defeated Barça 2-1. Even for 
a club so immersed in big occasions, this stood out asone of the finest in 
Celtic’s history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/07/celtic-barcelona-neil-lennon-vilanova>
.

Watt left Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> Park that night 
with a message from Lennon: “Don’t let this be all you are remembered for.” 
Lennon wanted the goal to be a springboard. Watt had pace, power and the 
uncanny ability to keep the ball attached to his boot that separated him from 
other Scots.

That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us. Here’s Ewan 
Murray’s full match report.

Lionel Messi scores twice as Barcelona send Celtic crashing out of Europe
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/23/celtic-barcelona-champions-league-match-report> 
Borussia Mönchengladbach have drawn 1-1 with Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/23/borussia-monchengladbach-v-manchester-city-champions-league-live>
. That result propels the German side into the Europa League with a third-place 
finish in Group C and leaves Celtic on the outside of European football looking 
in.
 
There is the final whistle and Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are your official Group C 
winners, sealing passage to the knockout stage ahead of Manchester City, who 
finish second. It was a fairly pedestrian victory for the Spanish champions 
tonight despite a brave challenge from the hosts.
 
90 min+2: Barca simply cruising to the finish line here. An uninterrupted 
sequence of passes leavesCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
mere spectators.
 
90 min: The fourth official signals for four minutes of added time.
 
89 min: Rakitic shown yellow for a foul as Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> charge forward.
 
88 min: Armstrong shown yellow for a foul that upturns Messi near the 
touchline. Frustrations boiling over forCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
85 min: Barca keeping possession with maddening efficiency as time runs short 
on the hosts.
 
83 min: Messi with a mazy run through a gaggle of Celtic defenders before 
slipping a pass to Suarez, whose shot from point-blank range surely should have 
been a thirdBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> goal. 
Instead, he misses the target.
 
79 min: Rakutic wins a corner and takes it for Barca, but nothing comes of it. 
The Spanish champions seem to have warded off Celtic’s best offerings and are 
simply in mop-up mode with just over 10 minutes remaining.
 
76 min: Now the final sub of the match as Neymar walks off for the Turkish 
star Arda Turan. A fantastic day for the Brazilian, whose assist to Neymar in 
the 24th minute helped Barca break the deadlock.
 
73 min: Barca answer with their second switch as Marlon enters for Pique.
 
72 min: Rodgers makes his third and final substitution as Roberts enters for 
McGregor.
 
71 min: Both Lustic and Neymar are shown yellow after a flare-up near the 
touchline. Neymar will miss the next match, but it’s doubtful he’ll mind too 
much with Barca already through to the next stage.
 
69 min: These fans have not budged one inch as Celtic continue, scoreline 
notwithstanding, to put on one of their bestChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> performances of the 
year. Celtic win a corner and play it short but now Barca have dispossessed 
them and are on the counter-attack.
 
66 min: Now Barca will make their first substitution as Digne enters for Jordi 
Alba.
 
65 min: Free kick is played to Dembele, who can’t put it on target and manages 
to bang heads with Pique in the process.
 
63 min: Another switch for Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>
 as Bitton enters for Rogic. Free kick coming up for the hosts.
 
58 min: The slim margins of the game were on clear display there. Dembele was 
so close to leveling the score for the hosts, then moments later Barca struck 
to, it would seem, put it out of reach.
 
Messi calmly beats the keeper from the spot and Barcelona’s lead is double, 
putting Celtic’s chances at three points tonight in serious jeopardy.

54 min: Izaguirre is whistled holding onto Suarez in the area and a penalty is 
awarded to Barcelona!
 
53 min: Another golden chance as Forrest plays a ball into the area for 
Dembele, surrounded by a gaggle of frozen Barca defenders. But he heads the 
ball directly into the hands of Ter Stegen.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will scarcely get a better chance 
than that!
 
49 min: McGregor with an attempt on goal for the hosts but a relatively 
drama-free save for Ter Stegen.
 
48 min: Barca concede a free kick on a Neymar foul and Dembele has a shot 
parried away after the restart. Can’t say enough about the cauldron-like 
atmosphere here.
 
46 min: And the second half is under way at Parkhead with one change: James 
Forrest in for the injured Scott Sinclair.
 
There’s the whistle and time is called on the opening half. Yet another superb 
finish from Messi is all that separates the sides after an inspired showing 
from Brendan Rodgers’ men.
 
45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of stoppage time.
 
42 min: Sinclair is hacked down by Jordi Alba, who’s shown yellow for the 
foul. Medical staff trot out to treat him, but he will stay in the match for 
now. That would be a crucial loss forCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
40 min: Messi plays it into Suarez, whose header is turned away by the keeper. 
How near Barca were to doubling their advantage there!
 
37 min: Animated gestures from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> coach Luis Enrique along the 
touchline for Rakitic and Sergi Roberto to play higher up and wider on the 
pitch, thus opening more space for Messi in the center.
 
36 min: Moments later Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are 
back on the attack and Dembele lets rip a right-footed shot from just inside 
the area and Ter Stegen makes the save. Best attempt of the day for the hosts 
so far.
 
35 min: Simunovic is dispossessed by Messi in Celtic’s own final third and 
Barca move into attack quickly, but the hosts clamp down and snuff out the 
attack.
 
32 min: Sinclair a touch early on a run yet again and ruled offside by the 
linesman.
 
30 min: A half hour down and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have shown far better than in the 
first meeting but still no serious chances on the Barca goal.
 
27 min: Celtic will have a free kick after Brown is sent airborne on a Gomes 
foul, but nothing comes of it.
 
A typically beautiful goal as the ball is played across the area to Neymar at 
the corner of the area, who picks out an onrushing Messi and lobs the ball into 
the perfect spot for the Argentine striker to deliver it inside the near post 
past the keeper from short range. Simply sublime.

Russell Cheyne/Reuters  
23 min: Messi is hacked down and Sviatchenko is shown yellow for the foul. 
Free kick to Barca.
 
22 min: Gomes has a go on goal but it’s out for a Barca corner. Neymar plays 
it short to the near post, not entirely intentionally it seems, but it causes 
confusion and a scary moment forCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> before it goes out for another 
corner. Neymar plays it short again but this time it’s cleared past the halfway 
line.
 
19 min: Jordi Alba makes a well-timed run onto a through ball into the area 
near the left side of the goal and plays it to the far post, where Rakitic 
tries to head it on goal but misses the target. Probably the best chance of the 
match for either side so far.
 
17 min: A good spell of possession for the visitors here as they keep it in 
the middle third and make Barca chase. But they’re unable to penetrate theCeltic
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> defense and are ultimately 
dispossessed.
 
14 min: A poor pass by Ter Stegen goes straight to Sinclair, who’s been 
excellent today, but he fails to make Barca immediately pay. Celtic manage to 
keep it in the final third for another half minute, but there’s nowhere to go 
for Armstrong and he’s ultimately dispossessed and the Spanish champions go to 
work again. Meanwhile, tens of thousands ofCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> supporters are singing The Fields 
of Athenry in full throat.
 
11 min: The ball is through to Sinclair and a golden opportunity here for 
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> ... but the flag goes up 
as he’s ruled offside.
 
10 min: Messi has a shot blocked. Lots of two-way action so far with the ball 
going up and down the pitch.
 
8 min: A note from Jim Lines, via email:

Yes, FCB have a sponsorship deal with Replay Jeans, resulting in the South 
American triumvirate and the La Masia production line arriving at games clothed 
in denim. As someone who was once so enchanted by themas que un club culture, 
this sartorial sacrifice saddens me.
 
7 min: More from Sinclair, who plays it into the Barca area toward Dembele 
before it’s headed beyond the goal line for a corner. Sinclair takes it but 
it’s quickly cleared out of danger.
 
6 min: Sinclair takes on two Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defenders and slaloms around 
them into the area before he’s dispossessed. A moment of inspiration from the 
Celtic winger! They’ll need more of those.
 
4 min: Celtic pressing high up early on, but Barca have kept possession in the 
minutes since and are probing the hosts from the middle third. A momentary 
threat as Neymar carries the ball into the area and centers it to Messi, but he 
leaves it andCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> clear it 
safely out of danger.
 
1 min: Celtic kick off and will attack from left to right in traditional home 
kits with Barca going from right to left. A deafening sound from the crowd at 
Parkhead. What atmosphere!
 
The players are emerging from the tunnel. We should be under way in the next 
few minutes and will pick it up with minute-by-minute coverage from there.
 
You’ll Never Walk Alone rings through the stands at Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> Park. Here’s a look at today’s 
teams.
