France lived up to their billing as favourites in World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> qualifying Group A by 
beating Holland 1-0 on Monday, thanks to a long-range shot by the Manchester 
United midfielder Paul Pogba and a late save by Hugo Lloris.

And there was a blow for Liverpool when the Dutch midfielder Georginio 
Wijnaldum injured a hamstring, making the midfielder a major doubt for their 
Premier League game against Manchester United at Anfield on Monday.

France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> looked dangerous 
throughout the match at the Amsterdam Arena, with the world-record signing 
Pogba orchestrating the midfield, and the pace of the right-back Djibril Sidibe 
and powerful runs of Moussa Sissoko and Kevin Gameiro proving to be a menace.

While the Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> goalkeeper 
Maarten Stekelenburg looked like he could have kept out Pogba’s goal, however, 
he still kept the score down with dome decent saves in the second half.

Both teams were coming off 4-1 victories on Friday, Holland’s attack making up 
for the team’s continuing defensive frailties against Belarus while France, 
Euro 2016 runners-up, had easily overcome Bulgaria as Gameiro scored his first 
international goals in more than five years.

But the Dutch, already missing the experienced Wesley Sneijder and Arjen 
Robben through injury, endured an early setback when Quincy Promes, who scored 
twice on Friday, limped off and was replaced by Memphis Depay 16 minutes in. 
Midway through the second half Holland endured a further injury blow when 
Wijnaldum went to ground clutching his right hamstring.

Without Promes’s pace, the Dutch rarely looked likely to break down the 
experienced France defence and already looks to be struggling to reach the 
World Cup with only one team automatically qualifying from each group.
