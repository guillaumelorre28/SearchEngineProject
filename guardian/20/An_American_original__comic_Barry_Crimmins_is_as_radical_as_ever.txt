Frustratingly, I missed veteran US standup Barry Crimmins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/29/barry-crimmins-comedy-london-three-show-run>
 when he performed his debut UK tour this September. Happily, Louis CK has 
produced and distributed Crimmins’s first special,Whatever Threatens You, via 
his website <https://louisck.net/> – so I get to see why there’s a fuss about 
this rediscovered “legendary” political comic. For a piffling four quid, you 
too can check out the set, which – sure enough – showcases a wholly 
uncompromising act, trenchant in his criticism of the American way of life, 
without stinting on mordant humour. What’s most striking is the moral authority 
Crimmins brings to bear, of the type that only age, experience and, perhaps, 
suffering (Crimmins was raped as a child, and has been aprominent campaigner 
against child abuse 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/stand-up-survivor-the-story-behind-bobcat-goldthwaits-new-doc-20150805>
 ) can confer.

I can think of no analogous UK act; if we spliced Billy Connolly, Alexei Sayle 
and Mark Thomas, we might get close. What’s clear from the get-go is that 
Crimmins isn’t here to ingratiate himself. There’s no puppyish pitch for 
audience approval, nor even any pretence (as per standup convention) that the 
comedy is spontaneous: Crimmins refers to a crib sheet throughout. What we get 
instead is an old lag easing himself into – or girding himself for? – a 
sustained exposure of the assumptions, hypocrisies and lacunae that sustain 
American life.

So what does Crimmins bring to leftwing political comedy? One answer might be: 
he helped establish it. He’s been doing this for 44 years; there are jokes in 
the set about living under Nixon’s presidency, which gives the show a 
remarkable breadth of perspective. When Crimmins started doing standup, “you 
had to be a real iconoclast. Now you’re like a lemming,” he says – before a gag 
comparing Manhattan’s supposed 35,000 comedians to a refugee crisis. The 
iconoclastic clearly survives intact. What distinguishes Crimmins from most 
modern political comedy is the refusal to soft-soap his anger, or to filter the 
politics through a personal lens, far less to try and appear even-handed. He 
jokes about his lack of commercial appeal, but does nothing whatsoever to 
offset it.

 Refusal to soft-soap his anger … Barry Crimmins. Photograph: Shane Seibel 
Of course, many will dismiss this kind of comedy as “preaching to the 
converted”. They always do. My politics aren’t miles from Crimmins’s, but I 
didn’t feel pandered to. For a start, the jokes are good, which by definition 
means they contain surprises and new angles. I’m thinking of his dry response 
to southerners boasting about the quality of their college football (“it’s as 
if your great-grandparents had a real eye for wide receivers!”), or when he 
endorses the proposition that the death of a little-known archduke justified 
two world wars.

Then there’s the material that’s provocative even to soft lefties like me, 
like his blanket cynicism towards politicians (“never trust anyone who wants to 
be in charge”) or his attack on Hillary Clinton’s feminist credentials, which 
(its legitimacy aside) an old white guy probably shouldn’t make without a mite 
more humility.

But that’s what we’re here for, right? Someone who – alongside the jokes – 
thinks, believes and cares fervently, and isn’t bound by the pieties and 
qualifications of everyday conversation. Crimmins’s outspokenness is bracing, 
particularly because it’s never (as with some comics) an attention-seeking 
affectation. You can feel the moral disgust behind his attack on fellow 
standups, say,who moan about political correctness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/09/politically-correct-jerry-seinfeld-comedy-marginalised-voices>
, on how America treats its veterans and its criminals – and all the more so 
(given his personal history) on the Catholic church.

There’s the occasional fine non-political gag here, like the one about 
securing the Nebraska and Kansas franchise for runaway lorry ramps – 
effortlessly dispatched (how still and watchful he is when delivering this 
stuff), as if merely to prove he can do it. But what’s exciting about the show 
is the coherent political consciousness it brings to bear: radical, pissed-off, 
stoical but not usually cynical, drily amused despite everything, and insistent 
on the need for love. It’s a potent brew and if, like me, you missed Crimmins’ 
UK visit, his show is well worth a download.
