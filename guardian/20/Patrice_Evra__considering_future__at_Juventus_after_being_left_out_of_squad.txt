 last week. He has played only 247 minutes in Serie A this season having signed 
a one-year contract extension last summer with the option for another year.

Speaking before the match against Bologna, Marotta said that he is preparing 
for his possible departure.

“Evra is still with us. He was not called up by mutual agreement, as he is 
considering his future,” Marotta told Mediaset Premium.

“It’s only right he’s taking a moment to reflect, as his contract will expire 
in June, he is 35 years old going towards 36. We’ll see next week. I don’t 
think we need to find a replacement, as we have internal options like Kwadwo 
Asamoah and Federico Mattiello.”

But the player’s agent, Federico Pastorello, has insisted Evra could stay in 
Turin.

“It’s not certain he will leave Juventus,” Pastorello told Juvenews.eu. “We’ll 
see what happens over the next few days.”

After a series of stories in the Spanish media last week claimed Real Madrid 
and Barcelona have made offers for Paulo Dybala, the Argentina forward scored a 
penalty on his return from injury against Bologna. But Marotta denied the 
23-year-old is interested in leaving Italy, with the club hoping to extend his 
current contract which is due to expire in 2020.

“[We’ve had] no calls,” he said. “I want to point out that we have a 
multi-year contract with Dybala and approached his entourage a few months ago 
to improve his wages, which is only fair.

“Our rapport is idyllic, there are no fears he could leave. Juve are one of 
the best teams in the world and this is a place where you arrive, not pass 
through. Where could he be happier?”
