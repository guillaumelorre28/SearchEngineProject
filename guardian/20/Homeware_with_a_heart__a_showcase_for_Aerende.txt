It began with a wicker laundry basket. “That was my eureka moment,” recalls 
Emily Mathieson. “Last summer, at a local craft market, I bought this beautiful 
basket made by adults with learning disabilities. From then on, the idea for
Aerende <http://www.aerende.co.uk/> started to percolate.”

A former travel writer, Mathieson used her journalistic skills – “telling 
everyone, asking everyone, Googling endlessly” – to work out if her idea for an 
online shop selling “life-improving” homeware was viable. Her criteria were 
strict yet simple, she tells me over tea and doughnuts at her kitchen table. 
“The products have to be made by people who don’t have a normal route to 
selling their goods, and they have to be items I’d want in my own home.” In 
September, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, Aerende (pronounced 
a-ren-day) was launched.

Mathieson lives with her husband and two young children, Lola (seven), and 
Otis (four), in a terraced house in St Albans. The house was completely 
renovated when they moved from south London two years ago. The children’s rooms 
are in the newly converted loft, and Mathieson runs the shop from the spacious 
kitchen extension at the back of the house.

“Nearly everything in the house is secondhand,” says Mathieson. “I’ve always 
liked really simple things that have a legacy of use. And I like natural items 
because I don’t want to feel like my house is full of plastic. I’m interested 
in the greater goals of beauty – the impact your surroundings and day-to-day 
objects have on your wellbeing. That’s something I try to embrace in my house 
as well as the business.”

Mathieson quickly got a sense that there were going to be enough suppliers to 
launch her first collection, which includes wooden spoons carved by adults 
recovering from mental illnesses, natural linens hand-finished by female 
refugees from Syria and soya wax candles made in Wales by people with learning 
disabilities. “Most of the makers I approached had only ever sold their 
products at local craft fairs, so the suggestion of supplying to an online shop 
was a novel idea,” recalls Mathieson. “Many of the makers simply didn’t realise 
either the level of skill they have, or the market that’s available to them.”

 Pretty present: elm chopping board, £26 
Items in the shop range in price from £7 for a block of black poppy and wild 
fig soap to £185 for an ecru-striped duvet cover made from natural linen. 
“Because I am paying people properly, and because these objects take time to 
make, of course they are going to cost more than Ikea or John Lewis,” Mathieson 
explains. “Our wooden spoons cost £24 for a reason: they take two days to make!”

There’s a disclaimer on all products because they are all handmade from 
natural raw materials. “No two items will be exactly the same, and some items 
may or may not be available again once they have sold out. I’m hoping to build 
this in as a selling point, rather than a challenge.”

 Sleep of the just: natural striped linen duvet cover, £185 
“It’s really interesting hearing some commercial makers talk about their 
‘art’,” says Mathieson of the modern craft movement, and the trend – 
particularly in homeware – for the handmade. “It’s made me reflect on how the 
value of something is often determined by the confidence of the person who 
makes it. I’m hoping that Aerende becomes a way for the makers to see that 
there is a huge amount of skill involved in what they are producing. And that 
by calling the spoon maker and telling him his spoons have sold out in two 
weeks, he’ll gain more confidence about his work.”
