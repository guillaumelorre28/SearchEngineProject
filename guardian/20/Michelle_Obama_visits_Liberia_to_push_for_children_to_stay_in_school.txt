The country was founded as part of an effort to resettle freed American slaves 
and has deep ties to the United States.

The country’s oldest vocational high school, located in Kakata, is named for 
African-American civil rights activist Booker T Washington.

 The school suspended mid-term exams scheduled to start Monday “to allow the 
students to give Mrs Obama a rousing welcome to appreciate what the United 
States has done for us”, principal Harris Tarnue said.

“She will be a real inspiration to the young girls around here,” he said. 

Obama’s previous Africa visits as first lady included Ghana, South Africa
