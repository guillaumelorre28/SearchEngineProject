The hit show made headlines earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off>
 after Love Productions, the company that makes it, announced it wasswitching 
channels in a deal

 with Channel 4 in a three-year deal worth a reported £75m.

 left after the move, told the Jonathan Ross Show that he had been given little 
warning over the move. “It was between the production company and the BBC and 
they then moved to Channel 4 and obviously it came down to ... my job was still 
there and I didn’t want to lose my job,” he said. “I love doing what I do.”

He said he had been involved in “long talks” with Channel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> and was “excited” about the show’s 
return. “The Bake Off won’t change in the sense that the format will stay 
exactly the same, the tent will stay the same, the challenges and really the 
bakers [will not change].

“Ultimately, it comes down to when the bakers get in the tent next year, then 
it will be a special thing. I’m really excited about it and I think it will do 
a great job; I’m going to make sure that we keep it the same.”

Last week, Hollywood said he was surprised by the vitriolic reaction his 
decision had elicited, saying the Yorkshire Ripper had received less negative 
press coverage.
