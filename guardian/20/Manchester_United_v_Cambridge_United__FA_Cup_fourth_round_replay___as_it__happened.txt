FULL TIME: Manchester United 3-0 Cambridge United

And that’s that. The result was pretty much what everyone expected. Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> were 
professional and pretty, while Cambridge were resilient and determined, as they 
had to be to limit the biggest club in the country to three goals. But they’ll 
always wonder what might have happened had Tom Elliott found the net on 51 
seconds. Ah well, they’ll always have that 0-0 draw at the Abbey.

90 min +3: And the game finishes as it started, with Cambridge nearly scoring! 
Elliott cuts in from the right, one-twoing with Champion, and eating up much of 
theManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
half. He slides a diagonal pass towards McGeehan, who for a second is clear 
down the inside-left channel! McGeehan is about to get closed down, though, so 
he’s forced to shoot from the edge of the box, and nearly curls a powerful 
sidefoot into the bottom left! Not quite. Brave Cambridge, though.

87 min: A final change for Cambridge, as Miller comes on for Nelson. Miller 
nearly gets on the end of a free kick, hoofed into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> box from a deep 
position down the left. In fact Elliott gets in ahead of his team-mate, to 
little effect, the ball sailing serenely towards De Gea.

86 min: Rooney, the best part of 30 yards out, just to the left of the goal, 
attempts another curler into the top right. It’s flying along a perfect arc, 
but not travelling at any pace, and Dunn can calmly pluck the ball from the sky.

84 min: A lull, with both United taking turns to pass the ball around the 
middle of the park awhile. Donaldson attempts to break off down the left, but 
that scheme comes to a swift end.

areas tonight - it was erratic at best - but will be extremely pleased with his 
first goal forManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. He’s in credit. And 
he’s replaced by Young.

80 min: Rojo is in a lot of green space down the left. With team-mates 
screaming for the ball in the middle, his cross should be better, and he’ll 
have to settle for a corner, Nelson bundling out well. From the set piece, 
Rooney tries to curl one into the top right from the left-hand corner of the 
box. Nope.

77 min: McNair makes good down the right and hoicks a low ball into the 
centre. Rooney tries to help it on into the bottom left, but doesn’t get enough 
on the ball, and it squirts off wide left of goal. Meanwhile the other results 
are in. It’s 3-1 wins for Preston and Sunderland, over Sheffield United and 
Fulham respectively. So it’s going to be Bradford-Sunderland, and 
Preston-Manchester United. That latter fixture, between two local rivals, 
hasn’t been played since 1972.

GOAL! Manchester United 3-0 Cambridge United (Wilson 73)

A Rooney-esque finish, this. Wilson takes up possession 30 yards from goal, in 
a central position. He edges to the left, shoulders wide and head down, then 
lashes an unstoppable shot across Dunn and into the bottom right from the edge 
of the box. The keeper had no chance. A superlative goal.
 United’s Van Persie goes off and his replacement, James Wilson, scores within 
minutes. What does this mean? Photograph: Matthew Peters/Man Utd via Getty

68 min: Shots at either end. First Kaikai scores three rugby points, then Di 
Maria forces Dunn into tipping the ball over the bar from a position 25 yards 
out down the left. From the set piece, Fellaini is foiled at the right-hand 
post, his shot deflected out for another corner that’s wasted.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> haven’t taken their 
foot off the gas at all, and neither have they played badly. They’re just being 
held to two goals by a staunch Cambridge United side.

66 min: The frustrated van Persie is replaced by Wilson. No big tantrum is 
thrown, and he doesn’t look injured, but instead of sitting on the bench with 
his team-mates, he’s straight off down the tunnel. Let’s see this turned into 
something it isn’t.

65 min: A little bit of space for Morrissey, who has the chance of a shot from 
a central position, 20 yards out. But there’s little time for a backlift, and 
he drags it well wide of the right-hand post.

64 min: More anguish for van Persie. Di Maria chips a delightful ball down the 
inside-left channel for the striker, who powers into the box and, on the turn, 
hammers a low shot goalwards. But Dunn, despite being wrongfooted, twists in 
mid-air and parries clear. A brilliant save! Nelson does the decent thing by 
his keeper, hacking clear.

62 min: Tait powers down the right and diddles his way past a lumbering 
Fellaini. His low cross would have been met in the middle by Donaldson, but 
Rojo’s diving header concedes a corner instead. From that set piece, another 
corner. And from that one, Elliot can’t get on the end of an elaborate McGeehan 
backheeled flick-on.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> clear, and weren’t 
seriously threatened in truth, but that’s a decent passage of play from the 
fourth-division side.

59 min: Di Maria, on the right-hand edge of the Cambridge box, takes a touch 
inside and looks to curl an exquisite shot into the top left. That might have 
beaten Dunn’s desperate dive, but the excellent Coulson stepped in front of the 
keeper to batter a header clear. Magnificent play all round.

58 min: Manchester United are being given corners for nowt right now. And 
again van Persie is involved, the ball clanking off his arm as he challenges 
Coulson for a high ball. Nothing comes of it. But the Dutch striker seems hell 
bent on getting on the scoresheet tonight. He’s been a whirling dervish since 
the restart, a supreme irritant buzzing around this Cambridge back line.

53 min: Rooney belts a shot straight at Dunn from 25 yards. The keeper 
parries, but only into the path of van Persie, who is now officially livid with 
himself after ballooning over from close range, from a position just to the 
left of goal.

50 min: A couple of chances for a increasingly irritated van Persie within the 
space of 120 seconds. First he heads wide left and high from close range, after 
meeting McNair’s excellent right-wing cross. Then he’s bursting into the area 
down the inside-right channel, but shoots straight into Dunn’s chest. The ball 
clanks back off the striker for a goal kick, butManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> are gifted a corner. 
Another corner comes from that, and then ... nothing.

48 min: Rojo is found in acres of space down the left, in the Cambridge area. 
His cross sails into the Stretford End. Very poor, but he’s got the good grace 
to look appalled at his own effort. “If you were looking for Dion Dublin 
highlights, might I suggest the show he played his homemade percussion 
instrument (‘the Dube’) with Ocean Colour Scene?” writes Tom Adams. “Google it 
and thank me later. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbbN8geZyWM>” Nobody’s 
going to thank you for reminding them of Ocean Colour Scene, though, are they. 
And whatever next? Robert Rosario playing tea-chest bass with Spacemen 3?

And we’re off again! Cambridge knock it around for 50 seconds or so. And if 
Donaldson hadn’t hogged the ball, and slid a ball down the inside-right 
channel, McGeehan would have been clear on goal! On another day,Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> could easily 
have conceded a goal within a minute of each half starting. Is someone 
rohypnol-ing the oranges?

HALF TIME: Manchester United 2-0 Cambridge United

The ball’s at van Persie’s feet, in the Cambridge box down the left. He tries 
a few Chadwickesque spins and turns of his own, embarking on a route that, if 
mapped, would be not dissimilar to a treble clef. He nearly opens up the 
defence for a shot, but it’s blocked by Coulson. And that’s that for a half, 
which started with the fourth-division side (0p) hitting the post within a 
minute, and ended with the home side (£233.6m) rather understandably in full 
control. It’s been a blast, though, with both teams bringing plenty to the 
table. Don’t miss the second 45!

45 min: McNair clumsily bundles Chadwick over down the left, in the midfield. 
The free kick’s worked into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> area, where Chadwick 
is again involved, attempting a dainty dragback and turn, in the hope of making 
space for a shot, ten yards out to the left of goal. But Smalling is on hand to

close  
And that’s that. The result was pretty much what everyone expected. Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> were 
professional and pretty, while Cambridge were resilient and determined, as they 
had to be to limit the biggest club in the country to three goals. But they’ll 
always wonder what might have happened had Tom Elliott found the net on 51 
seconds. Ah well, they’ll always have that 0-0 draw at the Abbey.
 
90 min +3: And the game finishes as it started, with Cambridge nearly scoring! 
Elliott cuts in from the right, one-twoing with Champion, and eating up much of 
theManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
half. He slides a diagonal pass towards McGeehan, who for a second is clear 
down the inside-left channel! McGeehan is about to get closed down, though, so 
he’s forced to shoot from the edge of the box, and nearly curls a powerful 
sidefoot into the bottom left! Not quite. Brave Cambridge, though.
 
90 min +2: They’re still doing it, albeit to little effect.
 
90 min +1: Manchester United pass it around quite a lot.
 
90 min: There will be three added minutes.
 
87 min: A final change for Cambridge, as Miller comes on for Nelson. Miller 
nearly gets on the end of a free kick, hoofed into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> box from a deep 
position down the left. In fact Elliott gets in ahead of his team-mate, to 
little effect, the ball sailing serenely towards De Gea.
 
86 min: Rooney, the best part of 30 yards out, just to the left of the goal, 
attempts another curler into the top right. It’s flying along a perfect arc, 
but not travelling at any pace, and Dunn can calmly pluck the ball from the sky.
 
84 min: A lull, with both United taking turns to pass the ball around the 
middle of the park awhile. Donaldson attempts to break off down the left, but 
that scheme comes to a swift end.

81 min: That’s it for Rojo, who won’t be too happy with his delivery from wide 
areas tonight - it was erratic at best - but will be extremely pleased with his 
first goal forManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. He’s in credit. And 
he’s replaced by Young.
 
80 min: Rojo is in a lot of green space down the left. With team-mates 
screaming for the ball in the middle, his cross should be better, and he’ll 
have to settle for a corner, Nelson bundling out well. From the set piece, 
Rooney tries to curl one into the top right from the left-hand corner of the 
box. Nope.
 
77 min: McNair makes good down the right and hoicks a low ball into the 
centre. Rooney tries to help it on into the bottom left, but doesn’t get enough 
on the ball, and it squirts off wide left of goal. Meanwhile the other results 
are in. It’s 3-1 wins for Preston and Sunderland, over Sheffield United and 
Fulham respectively. So it’s going to be Bradford-Sunderland, and 
Preston-Manchester United. That latter fixture, between two local rivals, 
hasn’t been played since 1972.
 
75 min: Rooney is playing emergency left back as a high ball is launched into 
theManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
box from the left. Tait outjumps him but Rooney does enough to put the 
Cambridge full back off. He bundles the ball well wide right of the target.
 
A Rooney-esque finish, this. Wilson takes up possession 30 yards from goal, in 
a central position. He edges to the left, shoulders wide and head down, then 
lashes an unstoppable shot across Dunn and into the bottom right from the edge 
of the box. The keeper had no chance. A superlative goal.

71 min: Di Maria is replaced by Herrera.
 
69 min: Elliott is sprung clear down the left! But the flag goes up for a 
non-existent offside. Hmm. Cambridge have carvedManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> open once or twice in 
this match, despite the home team’s almost total dominance.
 
68 min: Shots at either end. First Kaikai scores three rugby points, then Di 
Maria forces Dunn into tipping the ball over the bar from a position 25 yards 
out down the left. From the set piece, Fellaini is foiled at the right-hand 
post, his shot deflected out for another corner that’s wasted.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> haven’t taken their 
foot off the gas at all, and neither have they played badly. They’re just being 
held to two goals by a staunch Cambridge United side.
 
66 min: The frustrated van Persie is replaced by Wilson. No big tantrum is 
thrown, and he doesn’t look injured, but instead of sitting on the bench with 
his team-mates, he’s straight off down the tunnel. Let’s see this turned into 
something it isn’t.
 
65 min: A little bit of space for Morrissey, who has the chance of a shot from 
a central position, 20 yards out. But there’s little time for a backlift, and 
he drags it well wide of the right-hand post.
 
64 min: More anguish for van Persie. Di Maria chips a delightful ball down the 
inside-left channel for the striker, who powers into the box and, on the turn, 
hammers a low shot goalwards. But Dunn, despite being wrongfooted, twists in 
mid-air and parries clear. A brilliant save! Nelson does the decent thing by 
his keeper, hacking clear.
 
62 min: Tait powers down the right and diddles his way past a lumbering 
Fellaini. His low cross would have been met in the middle by Donaldson, but 
Rojo’s diving header concedes a corner instead. From that set piece, another 
corner. And from that one, Elliot can’t get on the end of an elaborate McGeehan 
backheeled flick-on.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> clear, and weren’t 
seriously threatened in truth, but that’s a decent passage of play from the 
fourth-division side.
 
61 min: A second change by Richard Money: Simpson is replaced by Kaikai.
 
59 min: Di Maria, on the right-hand edge of the Cambridge box, takes a touch 
inside and looks to curl an exquisite shot into the top left. That might have 
beaten Dunn’s desperate dive, but the excellent Coulson stepped in front of the 
keeper to batter a header clear. Magnificent play all round.

58 min: Manchester United are being given corners for nowt right now. And 
again van Persie is involved, the ball clanking off his arm as he challenges 
Coulson for a high ball. Nothing comes of it. But the Dutch striker seems hell 
bent on getting on the scoresheet tonight. He’s been a whirling dervish since 
the restart, a supreme irritant buzzing around this Cambridge back line.
 
55 min: In the other ties, the goals have been flying in, and both matches 
have turned around. Preston now lead Sheffield United 3-1, while Sunderland are 
2-1 up on Fulham. As things stand, it’s going to be Bradford City versus 
Sunderland and Preston North End versusManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>.
 
53 min: Rooney belts a shot straight at Dunn from 25 yards. The keeper 
parries, but only into the path of van Persie, who is now officially livid with 
himself after ballooning over from close range, from a position just to the 
left of goal.
 
52 min: Incidentally, between those van Persie chances, Chadwick was replaced 
by Morrissey.
 
50 min: A couple of chances for a increasingly irritated van Persie within the 
space of 120 seconds. First he heads wide left and high from close range, after 
meeting McNair’s excellent right-wing cross. Then he’s bursting into the area 
down the inside-right channel, but shoots straight into Dunn’s chest. The ball 
clanks back off the striker for a goal kick, butManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> are gifted a corner. 
Another corner comes from that, and then ... nothing.

Persie. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images  
48 min: Rojo is found in acres of space down the left, in the Cambridge area. 
His cross sails into the Stretford End. Very poor, but he’s got the good grace 
to look appalled at his own effort. “If you were looking for Dion Dublin 
highlights, might I suggest the show he played his homemade percussion 
instrument (‘the Dube’) with Ocean Colour Scene?” writes Tom Adams. “Google it 
and thank me later. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbbN8geZyWM>” Nobody’s 
going to thank you for reminding them of Ocean Colour Scene, though, are they. 
And whatever next? Robert Rosario playing tea-chest bass with Spacemen 3?
 
And we’re off again! Cambridge knock it around for 50 seconds or so. And if 
Donaldson hadn’t hogged the ball, and slid a ball down the inside-right 
channel, McGeehan would have been clear on goal! On another day,Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> could easily 
have conceded a goal within a minute of each half starting. Is someone 
rohypnol-ing the oranges?
 
Half-time entertainment. Here’s Dion Dublin scoring a late winner for 
Cambridge United against Chesterfield 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzfb_GHDi4#t=01m24s> in the 1990 Fourth 
Division play-off final. Andhere he is sealing Manchester United’s first-ever 
Premier League win 
<http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2012/Aug/video-of-southampton-v-manchester-united-in-august-1992.aspx>
, four games into the 1992/93 season, against Southampton at the Dell.
 
The ball’s at van Persie’s feet, in the Cambridge box down the left. He tries 
a few Chadwickesque spins and turns of his own, embarking on a route that, if 
mapped, would be not dissimilar to a treble clef. He nearly opens up the 
defence for a shot, but it’s blocked by Coulson. And that’s that for a half, 
which started with the fourth-division side (0p) hitting the post within a 
minute, and ended with the home side (£233.6m) rather understandably in full 
control. It’s been a blast, though, with both teams bringing plenty to the 
table. Don’t miss the second 45!

team had scored in the first minute. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images  
45 min: McNair clumsily bundles Chadwick over down the left, in the midfield. 
The free kick’s worked into theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> area, where Chadwick 
is again involved, attempting a dainty dragback and turn, in the hope of making 
space for a shot, ten yards out to the left of goal. But Smalling is on hand to 
put a stop to his notions.
