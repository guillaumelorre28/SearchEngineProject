Copenhagen 


At a glance The revolution launched by the restaurant Noma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/14/noma-chef-rene-redzepi-noma-on-copenhagen>
 over a decade ago forged a distinctly Nordic cuisine and, in the process, 
turned Copenhagen into a foodie destination. Now that revolution is entering a 
second phase. No longer confined to the kind of high-end places that do 
innovative things with sea urchins and foraged sorrel, these days and the list 
of the city’s most exciting restaurants and bars includes spots that aren’t 
expensive, or even all that Nordic. What they share are the big flavours and 
attention to quality that many of their owners learned at Noma.

Eat Christian Puglisi broke with the Nordic doctrine when, as one of the first 
of Noma’s chefs to venture out on his own, he openedRelæ 
<http://www.restaurant-relae.dk/en> six years ago. Last summer, he decided to 
explore his Sicilian roots withBæst <http://baest.dk/en/>, a pizzeria where the 
charcuterie is from organic pigs, the mozzarella is made by hand from Danish 
milk, and the pies are baked in a wood-burning oven in the centre of the 
restaurant (pizzas from £12).Hija de Sánchez <http://www.hijadesanchez.dk/> 
brings the same attention to detail to tacos (three tacos for £10). Founded by 
Noma’s former pastry chef, Rosio Sanchez, it’s a markettaqueria that grinds its 
own corn and makes its own tortillas. And Tuesdays to Saturdays in summer, 
former Noma head chef Matt Orlando complements his seasonal menu atAmass 
<http://amassrestaurant.com/> with takeout fried chicken and coleslaw (£19). On 
a warm night, a box of crisp chicken and a glass of wine in its waterfront 
garden may be the city’s best picnic.

Drink Copenhagen has one of the world’s highest concentrations of natural wine 
bars – another legacy, at least in part, of Noma. One worthy recent arrival is
Gaarden og Gaden <http://gaaga.dk/>, a lively spot with a list heavy on French 
and Austrian bottles (£7 a glass), and a mean croque monsieur. For something a 
little stronger,Balderdash <http://www.balderdash.dk/> serves delicious, 
inventive cocktails (a recent concoction included an extract of beaver gland) 
in a cosily renovated building that dates from the 18th century (£10 a 
cocktail).

Stay Urban House <https://urbanhouse.me/> (dorm beds from £20, doubles from 
£100) opened last year in the trendyneighbourhood of Vesterbro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/19/copenhagen-city-guide-day-in-vesterbro>
, and is clearly aimed at a young crowd. Part hotel, part hostel, it is 
stylishly, if simply, designed, with a wide variety of onsite extras, including 
a bar and a tattoo shop.

If you see one thing Do it from a bike. Copenhagen is routinely ranked as the 
mostbike-friendly city in the world 
<http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/copenhagen/activities/copenhagens-bicycle-life>
 and has around 450km of dedicated routes. A cycle hire programme,City Bike 
<http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/copenhagen-city-bike-gdk495345>, 
launched in 2014 (look for the stands of big white bikes that operate with the 
swipe of a credit card, £2.75), but there’s also a rental shop on nearly every 
corner (about £10 a day).

chefs. Try gourmet hotdogs by Michelin-starred Magnus Nilsson of Fäviken, 
exquisite 100% ecological vegan dishes from Maximillian Lundin’s The Plant, 
truffle ravioli and slow-cooked 63C eggs at CAOS, run by Operakällaren’s chef 
Stefano Catenacci, and many more (prices from £3 to £13). To “fika” like a 
local – which means a coffee break with delicious pastries – head toMuggen 
<http://muggen.se/> on Södermalm, with its 1970s-style decor and large windows, 
perfect for people-watching. Grab Fairtrade coffee or eco-friendly teas with

Oslo 


At a glance Europe’s fastest-growing capital (there’s been a 22% population 
hike in the past 10 years) has recently seen its downtown and industrial 
sectors undergo a massive transformation, with warehouse conversions and 
rebuilding projects, such as the area around thenew Opera House 
<http://www.oslooperahouse.com/> or the vibrant, village-like Vulkan complex. 
This has given rise to bars, bistros and coffee joints run or inspired by young 
innovators: 2015 Bocuse d’Or winner Ørjan Johannessen from the restaurant
Bekkjarvik Gjestgiveri <http://www.bekkjarvikgjestgiveri.no/en/>, 2004 barista 
world champion Tim Wendelboe of theeponymous coffee bar 
<https://www.timwendelboe.no/>, and 2000 winner Robert Thoresen of Mocca and 
Java. There are starred chefs – Even Ramsvik atSentralen 
<http://www.sentralen.no/en/food-and-drinks/brasseriet> and Esben Holmboe Bang 
ofMaaemo <http://maaemo.no/> – and all this comes with the fresh air, mountains 
and a fjord packed with islands. Despite Norway’s reputation as an expensive 
place, local chefs take pride in making excellent food and drinks at reasonable 
prices.

 Bon Lio, Oslo, Norway. Photograph: Fotograf Stian Broch 
Nearby Fredensborgveien has also been transformed, with vibrant cafes, bars 
and quirky shops (Chez Colin <http://chezcolin.no/>, Fredens café and Den Gode 
Café <http://www.dengode.no/>, for example). The cheap and cheerful Bon Lió 
<http://www.bonlio.no/> gastrobar (dishes £11-£16) is a hot spot in a small 
1814 house, using Norwegian ingredients to make Spanish-style tapas. A sample 
dish is tartar of tuna, tomatoes, dates and sesame seeds. But the great thing 
about Oslo is its majestic surroundings, so take a picnic, jump aboard a ferry 
and go island-hopping around the Oslo fjord to enjoy the views. Buy cooked 
shrimps from the fishermen at the City Hall pier and wine at theVinmonopolet  
<https://www.vinmonopolet.no/>(the off-licence with a state monopoly on selling 
alcoholic drinks above 4.5% in Norway), which is two minutes’ walk away in the 
Aker Brygge area. Some islands, such asNakholmen 
<http://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=673097> and Lindøya 
<http://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=181571>, do have grocery shops that 
open in summer. Ferries go from the City Hall and tickets cost £2.80, the same 
as for the tram.

 Blå, Oslo 
Drink Cosy up with a cairpirinha and enjoy live bands at Café Brasil 
<https://www.facebook.com/CAFE-BRASIL-340888296542/> on Youngstorget, a plaza 
with numerous bars and eateries. The best place for dance music isBlå 
<http://blaaoslo.no/>, a graffiti-adorned warehouse-style club (it used to 
store gold and diamonds) with big-name DJs and bands supplying the beats and an 
terrace to cool down on. Prices are pretty good for Oslo, with beer at £8 and 
burgers about £10. Finish off at Bar Boca (no website), at 36 Thorvald Meyers 
gate, a tiny 1950s-style cocktail bar that serves excellent drinks for about 
£15 and “the biggest Cuban-style tuna sandwich in Oslo”, for under £10. Or grab 
a cheaper beer and watch the world go by on the busy main street in Grünerløkka.

Stay City Box <https://citybox.no/> at 6 Prinsens gate (doubles from £50) has 
a self-service reception and neat but small rooms. It’s a few minutes’ walk to 
Oslo’s main shopping street, Karl Johans gate, which stretches from the station 
to the castle. But for more offbeat shops and coffee bars, head to the side 
streets.

 Oslo Opera House. Photograph: Jaro Hollan Statsbygg 
If you see one thing Take a walk on the roof of Oslo Opera House 
<http://operaen.no/> (free), which has become the capital’s main attraction, 
thanks to its unusual, sloping architecture, designed by Snøhetta. From here, 
take in views of Oslo, the mountains and the fjord islands. There are usually 
rooftop events, from pop-up art shows to concerts, and world-class ballet and 
opera inside.

Reykjavik


At a glance Reykjavik is known for colourful houses, offbeat charm – and high 
prices. With gastropubs and boutique hotels opening on every corner,, to cater 
for the ever growing number of visitors, it may seem like the city is beyond 
the means of many. But, as the Icelandic national football team has just 
proved, nothing is impossible.

 Brauð & Co, Reykjavik, Iceland. Photograph: Hörður Ásbjörnsson 
Eat Brauð & Co <http://www.braudogco.is/#bakari> is a new artisan and organic 
bakery in downtown Reykjavik, selling sourdough bread baked to co-owner Ágúst 
Einþórsson’s own recipe, croissants and cinnamon buns (£3) that are worth every 
calorie. If the delicious smell doesn’t lead you in the right direction, the 
whole building is covered with a mural by local street artist Youze, making it 
hard to miss. In Skerjafjörður, theBike Cave <http://www.bikecave.is/en/home/> 
is a combined bike shop and burger joint, where you’ll find burgers at fair 
prices with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (luxury burger with 
bearnaise sauce or lamb steak sandwich £7, veggie burgers £5). And if you’re 
all sweaty, coming straight from a bicycle tour, the Bike Cave even offers 
shower facilities for a small fee.

 A burger at the Bike Cave 
In one of Reykjavík’s historic downtown buildings, designed by the former 
state architect of Iceland, Guðjón Samúlesson, isApótek Restaurant 
<http://apotekrestaurant.is/> . Although the only thing you’ll get for a tenner 
is the soup of the day, its £18 lunch offer (sea trout and rack of lamb, for 
example) is fine dining for the budget-conscious.


Drink Petersen Svítan <https://www.facebook.com/petersensvitan> is a new 
rooftop bar in one of Reykjavik’s historic buildings: Gamla Bíó. Once a cinema 
and later the home of the Icelandic Opera, Gamla Bíó is now a popular music 
venue, and Petersen Svítan is the perfect place for a few cold ones and snacks 
before a show.It offers one of the best views in the city from the outdoor 
area, and happy hour runs from 11.30am to 8pm (beer £3.60, wine £4.50).Public 
House <http://www.publichouse.is/> on Reykjavik’s main drag offers a reasonable 
selection of craft beers and yummy snacks – duck chopsticks (£8), scallop 
ceviche (£8.95). Albeit short (3pm-6pm), its happy hour is especially 
budget-friendly, with a pint starting at under £3. If cocktails are your 
poison, you can’t go wrong withSlippbarinn <http://www.slippbarinn.is/> at the 
Reykjavík Marina Hotel by the up-and-coming Old Harbour. It has an awesome 
drinks selection and impressive happy-hour offerings – its most popular 
cocktails are a lime-leaf gimlet and the classic margarita (both £7.20).

 Downtown hostel in Reykjavik. Photograph: Bragi Þór Jósefsson 
Stay Although the Reykjavik Downtown Hostel <http://www.hostel.is/> (dorm 
rooms from £35, doubles £150) is not flashy, the location is central – in a 
residential street a stone’s throw from the harbour – and the staff friendly. 
If dorms don’t appeal, there are private rooms with en suites. For a nearby 
watering hole, try the flight of Icelandic craft beers atMicrobar 
<https://www.facebook.com/MicroBarIceland> (five beers for £17).

If you see one thing Pay attention to the charming little details as you walk 
around the city. Picturesque, toy-town, corrugated houses, beautiful murals, 
fascinating sculptures and friendly cats give Reykjavik a special quality that 
makes you fall in love with it.
