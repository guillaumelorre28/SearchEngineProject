Are you a natural worrier? To find out, simply take the following vocabulary 
test. Please define: (a) abrade, (b) abrogate, (c) ret, (d) pintle and (e) 
quaternary. The answers are at the bottom of the page

These are some of the rarer words in English, turning up – on average – just 
once in every 50m words of speech. So if you get even just one or two right, 
your vocabulary is well above average. If you got them all right, it is 
absolutely stellar. Now for the bad news…

Vocabulary size is a measure of what psychologists call your verbal 
intelligence. But psychologistAlexander Penney 
<http://www.macewan.ca/wcm/SchoolsFaculties/ArtsScience/Programs/BachelorofArts/Disciplines/Psychology/PENNEYA3>
’s study, of more than 100 Canadian students, found links between verbal 
intelligence and rumination – as you’ll know if you did well on the vocabulary 
test – is the tendency to chew over upsetting events continually, long after 
they have happened.

These findings suggest that the higher your vocabulary (the more words you can 
define), the more likely that you will be a worrier and the fewer words, the 
less likely. But why? The authors of the study suggest that people with high 
verbal intelligence are better able to bring to mind the details of past 
events, and think them through in detail; a blessing for happy events, but a 
curse for unhappy ones.

Answers: (a) to wear away, (b) to revoke or repeal, eg a law, (c) to soak flax 
or hemp in water, (d) the pin of a hinge or rudder, (e) fourth.
