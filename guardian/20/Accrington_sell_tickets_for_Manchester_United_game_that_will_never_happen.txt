Accrington Stanley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/accringtonstanley>, 
who would have faced Manchester United in the FA Cup third round had they 
beaten Yeovil in the previous round, are selling commemorative tickets for the 
game that will never happen for £20.

John Coleman’s League Two side were beaten 2-0 by Yeovil in a second-round 
replay last month after the initial meeting had ended 1-1. And as Gary 
Johnson’s team were preparing to welcome United to Huish Park on Sunday 
afternoon, Stanley released news that they were planning to sell tickets for 
the made-up game against United.

“To mark the club’s FA Cup run 250 special edition commemorative tickets for 
the third round tie with Manchester United that would have followed a 
second-round replay win at Yeovil are being issued and available to buy for 
just £20 each,” the club saidon their website

. “Those who purchase the commemorative tickets will have their name on a Roll 
of Honour in the club programme and on the website to recognise their 
contribution in future.” The money generated will be put towards strengthening 
the Stanley squad this month.
