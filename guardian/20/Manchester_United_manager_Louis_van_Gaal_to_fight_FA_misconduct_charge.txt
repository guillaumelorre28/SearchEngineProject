Louis van Gaal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/louis-van-gaal> has 
denied a charge of misconduct in relation to media comments and requested a 
personal hearing on a date to be confirmed.

The Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
manager said, following the fourth-round goalless draw at Cambridge last month, 
that “every aspect of the match” had been against his team, including the 
referee, Chris Foy.

The Football Association charged Van Gaal last week, saying his comments 
“allege and/or imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the 
game into disrepute”.

Van Gaal said he would contest the charge so the FA’s announcement on Tuesday 
comes as no surprise. “Louis Van Gaal denies FA misconduct charge in relation 
to media comments and requests personal hearing, date to be confirmed,” said 
the FA on Twitter.

“The Man Utd manager was charged following The FA Cup tie against Cambridge 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united> on 23 Jan 2015. It 
is alleged his comments constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or 
imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the game into 
disrepute.”

Having seen United held at Abbey Stadium on 23 January, Van Gaal said: “Every 
aspect of the match is against us – the pitch, the referee, everything that you 
can think about is against you.”

United won the replay 3-0 at Old Trafford.
