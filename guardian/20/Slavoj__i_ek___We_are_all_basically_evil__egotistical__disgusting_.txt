We are all basically evil, egotistical, disgusting. Take torture, for 
instance. I am a realist. If I had a daughter and someone kidnapped her, and I 
found a friend of the kidnapper, I cannot say I wouldn’t torture that guy.

I have become more aggressive over time. Some say I am more right wing, which 
I am absolutely not. On the refugee crisis, we should drop the patronising 
“They are warm people.” No, there are murderers among them in the same way 
there are among us. The liberal left prohibit writing anything bad about 
refugees, which results in the anti-immigrant right monopolising.

I’m not a good father. There is something ridiculous in asserting my dignity 
which I resist automatically. My teenage son identifies with this undermining 
of my own authority. When he was 14, I was mad at him and used a vulgar 
expression in Slovenian: “Let the dog fuck your mother.” He replied: “That 
already happened 15 years ago. That’s how I was born.”

My friends call me Fidel. Not because of politics, but because I talk too 
much. I visited Cuba once and on TV, Fidel Castro was shown entering a meeting 
saying: “Comrades, five minutes to make some remarks.” I went to sleep, woke up 
five hours later, and he was still talking.

I hate politically correct arrogance. With black friends, in contrast to 
politically correct white guys, I establish real contact. How? Through dirty 
stories, dirty jokes. When you visit a foreign country, you play PC games about 
your interesting food or music, but how do you become really friendly? You 
exchange a small obscenity.

I’m unable to have one-night stands. In my city, Ljubljana, you can tell 
exactly which women I’ve slept with, because I married them.

It would be horror to say I love Isis. But look at its organisation with its 
postmodern fluid identity. There is an emancipatory underground tendency in 
Islam; a wonderful Muslim historian of philosophy developed a claim thatAquinas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/jan/30/thomas-aquinas-modernity>
 misread Aristotle under the influence of Islamic poets likeAvicenna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/11/top10s.philosophers.deaths>, 
which opened up the way for modernity, gay rights and so on.

My parents weren’t strict, but they were patronising. I didn’t like them. They 
both died in hospital during the night, and when I found out over the phone the 
next morning I was already behind my computer working. I said: “Is everything 
taken care of? OK, thanks,” and carried on. I felt totally cold – something 
didn’t work there. I am not celebrating myself for that.

Hollywood knows everything. It’s obsessed with dystopias, like in Elysium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/elysium-review> or The Hunger 
Games <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/22/the-hunger-games-review>. I 
really think this is one of our quite possible futures. Young people today 
should prepare for a big catastrophe, but engage in well thought out, local 
everyday struggles, and not escape into moralism.

Writing saved my life. Years ago, because of some private love troubles, I was 
in a suicidal mood for a couple of weeks. I told myself: “I could kill myself, 
but I have a text to finish. First I will finish it, then I will kill myself.” 
Then there was another text, and so on and so on, and here I still am.
