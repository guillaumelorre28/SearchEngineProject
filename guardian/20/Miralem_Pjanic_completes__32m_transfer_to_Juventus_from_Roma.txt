Italy manager Antonio Conte will take over before the new Premier League 
season. However he has instead opted to join the Serie A champions.

said: “Juventus Football Club can today confirm that Miralem Pjanic has 
completed a permanent switch from Roma for a fee of €32m. The 26-year-old has 
signed a five-year contract with the club.”

Pjanic handed in an official transfer request

 on Saturday. The player informed Roma that he wished to activate a release 
clause in his contract that allowed him to leave for a pre-agreed amount, 
adding that he would pay 20% of the fee himself, with Juventus making up the 
balance.

The player joined Roma from Lyon in 2011 for €11m and last season scored 10 
goals in 33 league appearances, while also providing 12 assists. After spending 
most of his youth in Luxembourg, he established himself as one of the best 
players in Serie A with a knack for scoringspectacular goals
