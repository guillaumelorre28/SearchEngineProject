With the usual no-easy-game provisos ... That’s a decent draw for Chelsea. It 
could have been a lot worse for Liverpool. But Arsenal andManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have been handed the 
trickiest tests. More on the draw in your super soaraway Guardian anon, but for 
now the last word goes to the supporters of 1979 and 1980 champions Nottingham 
Forest. “We Forest fans are feeling great!” reports Simon Frank. “We are top of 
division two, you know.”

“The gent with the red (or more likely purple) nose looks a lot like my 
granddad did in 1967,” writes David Godman. “He had acne rosacea, a skin 
complaint that makes the nose go bright purple. People thought he was an 
alcoholic and would take my grandmother aside to discreetly enquire about his 
drinking. He was actually a teetotal Methodist lay preacher who had to live 
with the fact that he looked permanently sozzled.”

Right, here we go! Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino, Iker Casillas and 
Karl -Heinz Riedle are about to pull out the first pot of balls. “I’m sure 
wasn’t the only Manchester United fan to get a little surge of excitement at 
the draw being today before realising it had nothing to do with me,” sighs 
David Flynn. “Ah well, at least there’s Burnley to look forward to. Or dread, 
depending on how you see the performance going.”

The trophy has been plonked on stage. We’ll be underway in a minute. For the 
record, when Uefa practiced heating up the balls earlier this afternoon, 
Liverpool were drawn with Real Madrid, Juventus and Monaco. No word on who 
Arsenal, Chelsea andManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> were landed with, but 
let’s not lose too much sleep over it, the real thing will be happening very 
soon. “I cannot agree enough with your comment at 16:30 regarding dream draws,” 
writes Richard Baker, who sounds like a very nice man to me. “There is nothing 
more annoying than pundits go on about teams hoping for the easiest draw 
possible. I’ve spent half my life watching City lose to crap teams, losing to 
Real Madrid and Bayern Munich makes a nice change.”

There’s some introductory jazz going on in Monaco right now. No music as such, 
just some Uefa suit droning on and on and on in the free style, while the likes 
of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jerzy Dudek and Luis Figo try their hardest not to yawn 
and look bored. This Uefa dude is in the middle of the mother of all 
soliloquies! He must have a set of lungs like Miles Davis and the capacious 
cheeks of Dizzy Gillespie. Nothing to report yet, is the short end. Nature of 
live blogs for you. “Could we perhaps swap Juve for PSG in that dream draw 
please?” asks Chris Baynes. “Completely agree about wanting to play the big 
boys but Turin ’05 wasn’t much fun for us travelling supporters. And while I’m 
here Munich over Barca, been there – done that. And Monaco is a nightmare for 
away allocations, so any chance ofAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> That said, I realise you 
don’t fix the draw, and won’t pass comment on whether Uefa ever do.”

A 5.45pm CET start, my eye. “Like everyone else, I should be working,” writes 
Charles Antaki, roughly 15 minutes before being asked to clear his desk, “but 
the FA photo draws me strangely. Two questions come to mind - was it really 
taken in 1967? You know, the Beatles, the Apollo space missions, the Six-Day 
War? Take four decades off and 1927 looks about right. The other question is 
less easy to resolve - namely, why is the gent on the right wearing an 
obviously false nose? Or was the ‘cold refreshment’ particularly potent that 
year? I suspect we’ll never know.” Oh I think we know.

The hall at the Grimaldi Forum is filling up. The finger food must have run 
out. And the big stars are arriving, one by one. Cristiano Ronaldo has turned 
up with his hair slicked back and Ray-Bans on, a sharp suit straight outta 
Goodfellas. He’d have lasted about ten frames. Too thin. More Spider than Jimmy 
the Gent. Arjen Robben is also dolled up like a movie star, specifically Dick 
van Dyke out of Mary Poppins. It’s an informal look. I wonder what his cockney 
accent is like? He won’t have picked one up on the Fulham Broadway. I’ll level 
with you, we should have started this at 4.45pm.

Dream draws for the English sides. How about these? Any of these would be 
pretty good:

Chelsea: PSG, Ajax, Roma (featuring Ashley Cole).
Arsenal: Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray, Roma (featuring Ashley Cole).
Manchester City: Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>, Anderlecht.
Liverpool: Barcelona (featuring Luis Suarez), Juventus, Monaco.

The point of football is to test yourself against the best and have a bit of 
fun while doing it, right?

That’s the qualifiers out of the way, then. Arsenal made it through by the 
skin of their teeth. Celtic, meanwhile, were knocked out of Europe twice before 
the end of August. Trailing Caley Thistle and the Accies in the Scottish 
Premiership, the only way is up, Ronny Deila. And so we’ve reached theChampions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> proper: 32 clubs, 
one cup. It sounds like a particularly violent reimagining of a popular 
romantic viral hit, doesn’t it. But it’s not.

The tournament starts to take shape today at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, 
where the most powerful folk in European football meet up to learn about tax 
avoidance schemes find out who’ll be playing who in the group stages of the 
2014-15 Champions League.For the first time since the days of the old European 
Cup, this year’s competition will be a free draw, reducing the chances of the 
same old names reaching the latter stages yet again, while giving a boost to 
some of the lesser names, lending the tournament a more exotic air … no, of 
course it won’t be. But we can dream, it’s free and they can’t take that away 
from us. The seeded pots, then:
 Some of your runners and riders 
Pot 1: Real Madrid (Spain), Barcelona (Spain), Bayern Munich (Germany), 
Chelsea (England), Benfica (Portugal),Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> (Spain), Arsenal 
(England), Porto (Portugal).

Pot 2: Schalke (Germany), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Juventus (Italy), Paris 
Saint-Germain (France), Shakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine), Basel (Switzerland),Zenit 
St Petersburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg> 
(Russia), Manchester City (England).

Pot 3: Bayer Leverkusen (Germany), Olympiakos (Greece), CSKA Moscow (Russia), 
Ajax (Netherlands), Liverpool (England), Sporting Lisbon (Portugal), 
Galatasaray (Turkey),Athletic Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> (Spain).

Pot 4: Anderlecht (Belgium), Roma (Italy), Ludogorets Razgrad (Bulgaria), 
Apoel Nicosia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/apoel-nicosia> (Cyprus), 
Bate Borisov (Belarus), Maribor (Slovenia), Monaco (France), Malmo (Sweden).

The usual rules apply. Each of the eight groups, A through to H, will contain 
one team from each seeding pot. No club can play a side from their own 
association. And there are some other restrictions, but quite frankly life is 
too short. The whole interminable shebang - which will include the vote for, 
and presentation of, the 2013/14 Uefa Best Player in Europe Award, for which 
Manuel Neuer, Arjen Robben and Cristiano Ronaldo are nominated - begins at 
5.45pm CET, which is 4.45pm in £sd.
 Another old-school draw: Jules Rimet holds the urn for his grandson Yves at 
the 1938 World Cup draw in Paris. In the middle, uninterested, or perhaps of a 
mind that he has more important things to be getting on with, is Francois de 
Tessan, France’s under-secretary of state for foreign affairs.

close   It’s all over, 1981 style: the FA fish around for balls in an empty velvet 
sack.  
With the usual no-easy-game provisos ... That’s a decent draw for Chelsea. It 
could have been a lot worse for Liverpool. But Arsenal andManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have been handed the 
trickiest tests. More on the draw in your super soaraway Guardian anon, but for 
now the last word goes to the supporters of 1979 and 1980 champions Nottingham 
Forest. “We Forest fans are feeling great!” reports Simon Frank. “We are top of 
division two, you know.”
 
And so here’s the full draw for the 2014/15 Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> group stage:

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Olympiacos, Malmo
Group B: Real Madrid, Basel, Liverpool, Ludogorets
Group C:  Benfica, Zenit, Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco
Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund>, Galatasaray, Anderlecht
Group E: Bayern Munich, Manchester City, CSKA Moscow, Roma
Group F: Barcelona, PSG, Ajax, Apoel
Group G: Chelsea, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon, Maribor
Group H: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Athletic Bilbao, Bate Borisov

Will poor old Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> ever catch a break in the 
European Cup, do you think?
 
Roma, the 1984 runners-up. Where’s Ashley Cole going? Manchester, that’s 
where! And what a group this is ...

Group E: Bayern Munich, Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, CSKA Moscow, Roma
 
Bate Borisov. They miss out on a glamour group.

Group H: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shakhtardonetsk>, Athletic Bilbao, Bate 
Borisov
 
Celtic fans, look at what you could have won. Maribor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/maribor> are in with ...

Group G: Chelsea, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon>, Maribor

Again, nothing’s a given at this level, but Jose will be happy enough with 
that. Poor old Ronny Deila.
 
Anderlecht next. And they’re in with Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, a very tough proposition for 
Arsene Wenger’s side.

Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund>, Galatasaray, Anderlecht

Again, I wonder how Nottingham Forest fans are feeling right now?
 
Malmo, the 1979 finalists, are in a glamour group with ...

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus>, Olympiacos, Malmo

I wonder how Nottingham Forest fans are feeling right now?
 
Apoel go in here...

Group F: Barcelona, PSG, Ajax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax>, 
Apoel
 
Monaco next. And this happens ...

Group C:  Benfica, Zenit, Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>, Monaco
 
A true legend on the stage now: Francisco Gento, who lifted this prize six 
times. Six times!He’ll be pulling out the Pot 4 chappies. And the first out are 
the Bulgarian championsLudogorets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ludogorets>. They’re in with Liverpool. 
Nothing’s easy, but Brendan Rodgers would have taken this ...

Group B: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, Basel, 
Liverpool, Ludogorets
 
After pot C, then. Or was it pot 3? I can’t recall. Let’s not worry too much.

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Olympiacos
Group B: Real Madrid, Basel, Liverpool
Group C:  Benfica, Zenit, Bayer Leverkusen
Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund>, Galatasaray
Group E: Bayern Munich, Manchester City, CSKA Moscow
Group F: Barcelona, PSG, Ajax
Group G: Chelsea, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon
Group H: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Athletic Bilbao
 
Sporting of Lisbon. They’re in with the 2012 winners Chelsea. Which means 
Bayer Leverkusen are in with Benfica and Zenit, and Galatasaray join Arsenal and
Borussia Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> in 
what looks like a tough group.

Group G: Chelsea, Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke>, 
Sporting Lisbon
Group C:  Benfica, Zenit, Bayer Leverkusen
Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray
 
Olympiacos are up next. They go in with ...

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus>, Olympiacos
 
Ajax of Amsterdam, the four-time winners. They go into a fairly exciting group 
alongside ...

Group F: Barcelona, PSG, Ajax
 
CSKA Moscow next. They’re plopped into a group with the champions of England!

Group E: Bayern Munich, Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, CSKA Moscow
 
It’s Liverpool! And they’re in with the champions! A rerun of the 1981 final, 
then.

Group B: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, Basel, 
Liverpool
 
Manuel Sanchis, formerly of Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, is the very man for Pot 3 
action. His first act is to pluck Athletic of Bilbao out of the pot. They’ll be 
in with ...

Group H: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shakhtardonetsk>, Athletic Bilbao
 
After pot 2, this is how the groups are looking ...

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus
Group B: Real Madrid, Basel
Group C:  Benfica, Zenit
Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund
Group E: Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich>, 
Manchester City
Group F: Barcelona, PSG
Group G: Chelsea, Schalke
Group H: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk
 
Juventus. They go in with last season’s runners up. Which means Schalke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> are in with Chelsea.

Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus
Group G: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, Schalke
 
Basel. And they’re in with the holders.

Group B: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, Basel
 
Borussia Dortmund are the next club out. Their 1997 hero pairs them with ...

Group D: Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund
 
The first proper English action of the evening! Manchester City are out, and 
they’ve got to go in withBayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> for some reason.

Group E: Bayern Munich, Manchester City
 
Shakhtar Donetsk now. Riedle puts them in with ...

Group H: Porto <https://www.theguardian.com/football/porto>, Shakhtar Donetsk
 
PSG are out next. And they’re in with ...

Group F: Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, PSG
 
Bolton Wanderers legend Fernando Hierro, who also captained Real Madrid to 
victoryin the 2002 Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/15/minutebyminute.sport>, is the 
next chap out with a remit to pluck balls from pots. Pot 2, then. Here we go 
... Zenit are out first, and they go in with ... hold on, Riedle has knocked 
the pot of balls onto the floor. Oop! Perhaps they were too hot. Anyway, 
eventually there’s a new set, and he does this:

Group C: Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>, Zenit
 
After Pot 1 ...

Group A: Atletico Madrid
Group B: Real Madrid
Group C:  Benfica
Group D: Arsenal
Group E: Bayern Munich
Group F: Barcelona
Group G: Chelsea
Group H: Porto

“The gent with the red (or more likely purple) nose looks a lot like my 
granddad did in 1967,” writes David Godman. “He had acne rosacea, a skin 
complaint that makes the nose go bright purple. People thought he was an 
alcoholic and would take my grandmother aside to discreetly enquire about his 
drinking. He was actually a teetotal Methodist lay preacher who had to live 
with the fact that he looked permanently sozzled.”
 
Right, here we go! Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino, Iker Casillas and 
Karl -Heinz Riedle are about to pull out the first pot of balls. “I’m sure 
wasn’t the only Manchester United fan to get a little surge of excitement at 
the draw being today before realising it had nothing to do with me,” sighs 
David Flynn. “Ah well, at least there’s Burnley to look forward to. Or dread, 
depending on how you see the performance going.”
 
The trophy has been plonked on stage. We’ll be underway in a minute. For the 
record, when Uefa practiced heating up the balls earlier this afternoon, 
Liverpool were drawn with Real Madrid, Juventus and Monaco. No word on who 
Arsenal, Chelsea andManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> were landed with, but 
let’s not lose too much sleep over it, the real thing will be happening very 
soon. “I cannot agree enough with your comment at 16:30 regarding dream draws,” 
writes Richard Baker, who sounds like a very nice man to me. “There is nothing 
more annoying than pundits go on about teams hoping for the easiest draw 
possible. I’ve spent half my life watching City lose to crap teams, losing to 
Real Madrid and Bayern Munich makes a nice change.”
 
There’s some introductory jazz going on in Monaco right now. No music as such, 
just some Uefa suit droning on and on and on in the free style, while the likes 
of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jerzy Dudek and Luis Figo try their hardest not to yawn 
and look bored. This Uefa dude is in the middle of the mother of all 
soliloquies! He must have a set of lungs like Miles Davis and the capacious 
cheeks of Dizzy Gillespie. Nothing to report yet, is the short end. Nature of 
live blogs for you. “Could we perhaps swap Juve for PSG in that dream draw 
please?” asks Chris Baynes. “Completely agree about wanting to play the big 
boys but Turin ’05 wasn’t much fun for us travelling supporters. And while I’m 
here Munich over Barca, been there – done that. And Monaco is a nightmare for 
away allocations, so any chance ofAnderlecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht> That said, I realise you 
don’t fix the draw, and won’t pass comment on whether Uefa ever do.”
 
A 5.45pm CET start, my eye. “Like everyone else, I should be working,” writes 
Charles Antaki, roughly 15 minutes before being asked to clear his desk, “but 
the FA photo draws me strangely. Two questions come to mind - was it really 
taken in 1967? You know, the Beatles, the Apollo space missions, the Six-Day 
War? Take four decades off and 1927 looks about right. The other question is 
less easy to resolve - namely, why is the gent on the right wearing an 
obviously false nose? Or was the ‘cold refreshment’ particularly potent that 
year? I suspect we’ll never know.” Oh I think we know.
 
The hall at the Grimaldi Forum is filling up. The finger food must have run 
out. And the big stars are arriving, one by one. Cristiano Ronaldo has turned 
up with his hair slicked back and Ray-Bans on, a sharp suit straight outta 
Goodfellas. He’d have lasted about ten frames. Too thin. More Spider than Jimmy 
the Gent. Arjen Robben is also dolled up like a movie star, specifically Dick 
van Dyke out of Mary Poppins. It’s an informal look. I wonder what his cockney 
accent is like? He won’t have picked one up on the Fulham Broadway. I’ll level 
with you, we should have started this at 4.45pm.
 
Dream draws for the English sides. How about these? Any of these would be 
pretty good:

Chelsea: PSG, Ajax, Roma (featuring Ashley Cole).
Arsenal: Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray, Roma (featuring Ashley Cole).
Manchester City: Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>, Anderlecht.
Liverpool: Barcelona (featuring Luis Suarez), Juventus, Monaco.

The point of football is to test yourself against the best and have a bit of 
fun while doing it, right?
 
For the record, the Grimaldi Forum has staged: The ballet ...
 Les Ballets de Monte Carlo 
... the old music ...
 The Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra (not pictured) at the Grimaldi Forum

The usual rules apply. Each of the eight groups, A through to H, will contain 
one team from each seeding pot. No club can play a side from their own 
association. And there are some other restrictions, but quite frankly life is 
too short. The whole interminable shebang - which will include the vote for, 
and presentation of, the 2013/14 Uefa Best Player in Europe Award, for which 
Manuel Neuer, Arjen Robben and Cristiano Ronaldo are nominated - begins at 
5.45pm CET, which is 4.45pm in £sd.
 Another old-school draw: Jules Rimet holds the urn for his grandson Yves at 
the 1938 World Cup draw in Paris. In the middle, uninterested, or perhaps of a 
mind that he has more important things to be getting on with, is Francois de 
Tessan, France’s under-secretary of state for foreign affairs.
