The Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> winger Serge 
Gnabry, who scored a hat-trick on his debut in the 8-0 victory over San Marino 
on Friday, initially thought his call-up to the national team by coach Joachim 
Löw was a hoax.

Gnabry became the first German to score three goals on his international debut 
for 40 years during the World Cup qualifier.

“The coach called me up but I had to think about it for a bit whether it was 
true or not,” he told German media company RND. “There are so many hoax calls 
from radio shows and I really did not want to be a victim of that.“

The speedy 21-year-old, joint top scorer and silver medallist at this year’s 
Olympic Games, has enjoyed a meteoric rise this season after joining Werder 
Bremen from Arsenal.

He failed to win a regular first-team place following his move to the Premier 
League club in 2012.

“I would not be the player I am today without England,” Gnabry said. “For 
example Arsenal’s quick game which I learned. If you train as a young man with 
top players for three years then it is clear you will improve.”
