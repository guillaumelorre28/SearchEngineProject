Hatem Ben Arfa is set to depart Newcastle United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> after Nice announced a 
deal had been agreed in principle to bring him back to France.

The forward has been left in limbo after the failure of a loan spell with 
Hull, with the Tigers manager Steve Bruce cutting short his stay at the KC 
Stadium but Newcastle unwilling to reintegrate him into their squad.

However, he has been offered a lifeline after a Nice statement announced: “OGC 
Nice <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> have reached an agreement in 
principle with Hatem Ben Arfa. The France international will have a medical on 
Monday prior to signing with Le Gym.”

According to the French club, Ben Arfa – who is still to complete a medical – 
has been persuaded to join after discussions with the coach Claude Puel and by 
the club’s ambitions.
