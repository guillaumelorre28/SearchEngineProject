The former Ivory Coast coach Hervé Renard will take over at Lille from René 
Girard who is leaving by mutual consent after two seasons in charge of the 
Ligue 1 side. “It’s an honour to arrive at a club as prestigious as Lille,”
Renard told the French team’s website <http://www.losc.fr)>.

Renard, who resigned as Ivory Coast coach three days ago, is to sign a 
three-year deal on Tuesday.

The Frenchman led Zambia and Ivory Coast to African Nations Cup titles in 2012 
and 2015 respectively. He had a short spell in charge of Cambridge United in 
2004.

Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> finished a disappointing 
eighth this season.
