The Vatican’s culture minister has acknowledged that his office must expand 
its horizons aftera promotional video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2CRO7B-HOY> for a Vatican women’s conference 
featuring a sexy Italian actor was ridiculed in North America.

Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi said the criticism that compelled him to remove the 
English version of the video came from both liberal and conservative wings of 
the church, including from bishops. Some complained it was not feminist enough 
and others said it was so liberal it was “unworthy of a church initiative”.

 Vatican’s promotional video 
The video features actor Nancy Brilli asking women to contribute clips of 
their lives for broadcast at a meeting of Ravasi’s Pontifical Council for 
Culture this week.

At a news conference on Monday, Brilli defended the video and also the choice 
of women to undergo cosmetic surgery.
