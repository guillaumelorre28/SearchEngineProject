The funniest person I know


John Sizzle. He’s a drag queen I gig with and he owns a pub called The Glory 
in Dalston. He’s more than a drag queen. He’s a comedian, but like one who is 
undercover. He’s also on Netflix in a movie about east London drag queens 
called Dressed As A Girl.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen

Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The Captain alone is very funny. And Ab Fab: it hasn’t 
aged at all.

The funniest book I’ve ever read

Yellow Pages. Why are they still printing it?

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen

The Hobbyist. It was made by a couple of Welsh blokes in 2008 and it won a 
Virgin Media Shorts award back then.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

I find this YouTube generation stuff quite funny: these young people vlogging 
and making millions of pounds from something that essentially doesn’t exist and 
then flaunting their wealth from that “job” on their channels and thus making 
this generation of children believe that’s how it’s all meant to be. When I was 
their age I worked hard at menial jobs and earned no money at all and was 
treated badly by managers who hated me because I was young. Young people aren’t 
meant to be millionaires.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had

I dyed it rainbow for my Sky horror short Bloody Tracy and then crimped it. 
I’m 32.

The funniest word

Ffa Pob. It’s Welsh for baked beans. I’m not Welsh but I lived there for a 
while. I met Charlotte Church the other day at Sink The Pink in east London and 
it was like meeting Michael Jackson.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned

My old Asda uniform that I like to wear in posh private members bars to make 
the management worry that working-class people have accidentally bought 
memberships.
