How funny do you think you are? To find out, complete the following zingers - 
ideally with a willing friend or partner - and compare your witticisms. 
Possible answers are shown at the bottom of the page.

(a) The angler told me he hadn’t had a bite in days. So…
(b) The good-looking anaesthetist was nicknamed “Appendix” because…
(c) Carrots are definitely good for your eyesight. I’ve never seen…
(d) Give him an inch and he…
(e) Do you know your house is on fire?

If the jokes sound corny, well, they were devised in 1983 (by Harvard 
psychologist Alan Feingold), but they still do a pretty good job of tapping 
into our ability to detect and play around with incongruity. Incongruity isn’t 
enough for a decent joke on its own (Q: Why did the chicken cross the road? A: 
Five), but it is present in most types of humour, from aPeter Kay

 standing onstage listing crisp flavours.

If you came up with a funny answer for each of the above, the good news is 
that Feingold’s study found a modest link between performance on this test and 
intelligence. Crucially, the scores were not correlated with self-reported 
“sense of humour”. Just because you think you have a GSOH, there’s no reason to 
believe others will agree – your friend or partner has to feel the same way, 
too.
