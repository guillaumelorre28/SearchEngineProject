Both you and your partner rate the following statements on a scale of 1 
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):

a) Anyone who works hard usually succeeds
b) Going to war is often necessary and unavoidable
c) University should be free for students
d) I believe in love at first sight
e) It is wrong to eat veal

So is the cliché true: did your answers tend to opposite ends of the scale? 
Probably not. Many psychological studies have found that – for both friendships 
and romantic relationships – we tend to choose people who have similar 
attitudes to ourselves. The study this quiz was based on found that we suss out 
other people within minutes of meeting them and don’t pursue friendships with 
those whose attitudes are very different from ours.

Researchers gave participants a wide range of questionnaires on their 
personality/attitudes/behaviour then paired them up, later returning to see 
which pairs pursued a friendship beyond the study.

Weirdly, a follow-up study found that covering people’s torsos with a black 
bag (but not a clear bag) impaired participants’ ability to pick out others 
with similar attitudes and personalities. No one’s sure what people gleaned 
from each other’s torsos – body size, waist-to-hip ratio, a subtle shimmy 
radiating confidence – but we seem to use this information subconsciously to 
identify others with a similar take on life. Maybe one to consider when 
dressing…
