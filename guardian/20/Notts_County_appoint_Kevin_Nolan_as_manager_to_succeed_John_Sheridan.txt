The League Two club announced Kevin Nolan as their manager on Thursday at the 
same time as Alan Hardy was introduced as the club’s new owner and chairman.

Nolan, 34, succeeds John Sheridan who was sacked at the start of the month 
following a run of nine straight league defeats. The former Bolton, Newcastle 
and West Ham midfielder became the youngest manager in the Football League last 
January when he took over as the player-manager of Leyton Orient but he left 
towards the end of the season despite winning seven of his 15 games in charge.

He has been out of football since and his appointment is something of a 
surprise given Notts County’s predicament – they are one place and one point 
above the relegation zone – as it was expected Hardy would opt for a manager 
with more experience.

Hardy said: “I have spoken to five managers in the last five days and Kevin 
Nolan is outstanding, and that’s what this club needs. I will provide the 
leadership off the pitch and he will provide it on the pitch.

“Not only is he still a good footballer but at Leyton Orient he had immediate 
success and that is important for us because we need to start winning games and 
climbing the table and get away from relegation zone.”

Local businessman Hardy announced on Wednesday that he had completed his 
takeover of the club from Ray Trew.

Sheridan has taken charge of Oldham for the fifth time, moving to Boundary 
Park following the sacking of Stephen Robinson.

The Oldham chairman, Simon Corney, said: “John is someone we know well and we 
hope he can have an immediate effect on our situation.”
