Here we are again, another year, another chance to change some things and 
preserve others. Well, for a start, I should not be leaving the writing of this 
piece until the last minute. And I will send the payment for water and 
telephone and so on within a day or two, and not have to worry about being cut 
off – not that I ever have been… not yet.

I will continue drinking only wine, having realised after a year without them 
that spirits aren’t actually essential

I will continue drinking only wine, having finally realised, after a year 
without them, that spirits aren’t actually essential. I will put everything I 
mean to do in the shared house calendar, not just the ones which concern 
whoever is staying here – which includes my companion from theShare and Care 
<http://www.shareandcare.co.uk/> people, the charity that matches a young 
person who needs somewhere to live with an older person who needs… well what? 
It varies, but company and a bit of assistance, and, in my case, help with the 
irritating computer.

So how should things go in 2017? It may be debated.

I tend to think of things being forbidden or compulsory, but it may be a 
question of permitting something once, but not as a habit, or some things we’ve 
always done which is why we’re so sick of them. New Year is where we are glad 
to face another year in some ways but not others: yes, bring your guitar in but 
not when we’ve got my talkative cousins; and nobody shall be allowed to do 
things in the garden but the lass who takes care of it.

One way or another January is the time for assessment and sorting things out 
in several ways and with good intentions, so I wish you all the best.
