The Brighton & Hove Albion manager, Chris Hughton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chris-hughton>, has signed a new 
four-year contract days after the club missed out on promotion to the Premier 
League.

A draw at Middlesbrough

 on the final day of the regular league season left Brighton in third place in 
the Championship, when automatic promotion was tantalisingly close.

A painful play-off semi-final defeat followed at the hands of Sheffield 
Wednesday

, meaning Brighton must try again next season to earn a place in the top flight.

And the ambitious Brighton board members trust Hughton to lead the challenge, 
handing him a new deal that runs until 2020.

Brighton’s chairman, Tony Bloom, told the club’s official website: “Chris 
thoroughly deserves this new contract after such an outstanding season.

“There is no doubt he is one of the best and most skilful managers in the 
country and we are delighted to be going into next season with Chris at the 
helm and leading our club, as we aim to go one step further and realise our 
ultimate aim of reaching the Premier League.”
