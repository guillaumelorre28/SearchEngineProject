The end-of-year list is one of music journalism’s more peculiar traditions. 
For writers, the process of ranking 12 months’ worth of releases is generally a 
thankless task; for readers the result simply serves as an opportunity to leave 
outraged comments lamenting every overlooked Elysia Crampton album and Future 
mixtape that got lost in the post. You can’t please everyone, so with that in 
mind it’s unsurprising that a few publications should let off steam by 
declaring the worst things they’ve heard this year as well as the best.

Last week Time magazine did just that, revealing its least favourite songs of 
2016 <http://time.com/4577404/the-top-10-worst-songs/>, including entries from 
Meghan Trainor <https://www.theguardian.com/music/meghan-trainor>, Mike Posner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/28/mike-posner-review-xoyo-london> 
andIggy Azalea <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/iggy-azalea>, with Justin 
Timberlake <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/justin-timberlake>’s Can’t Stop 
The Feeling coming in as their definitive worst offender. The list’s target is 
chart music, and is comprised entirely of mainstream, radio-friendly hits. The 
trouble is, in an era whenJustin Bieber  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber>has been recast as a credible, 
hipster prince, the previously assumed lines between good and bad taste have 
become blurred, if not eradicated.

 Is this really the worst song of 2016? 
Lists such as Time’s rely on an outmoded critical hierarchy that positions 
some types of music above others. It’s the snobbery you’ll find lurking in the 
YouTube comments under everyPink Floyd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd> video, where confused blokes 
grapple with the concept thatZayn Malik 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik> exists, or that rappers can win 
awards. Yet in 2016 – the yearBeyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> is likely to top many critics’ 
album of the year polls – dismissing pop music smacks not just of elitism but 
of laziness. In this new epoch, when all music is created equal, sweeping ideas 
of merit that place Timberlake belowThom Yorke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/thom-yorke> are increasingly redundant.

The blessings of this post-taste age haven’t just been felt by the pop stars 
of today. Reissues ofAbba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> albums can 
now enjoylengthy appraisals on Pitchfork <http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/>
, while trendy online radio stations such as NTS feature entire shows dedicated 
to “yacht rock”, giving schmaltzy MOR crooners such as Kenny Loggins a second 
life among the roll-up smokers of east London. Sales don’t mean everything, of 
course, but it’s no coincidence that this is also the yearRick Astley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/rick-astley-i-made-tea-for-bananarama-dead-or-alive-mel-and-kim>
 andCraig David <https://www.theguardian.com/music/craig-david> have enjoyed No 
1 albums in the UK, both off the back of critical revaluations.

That isn’t to say there’s no such thing as bad music any more – no amount of 
blue-sky thinking can redeem the sanctimonious dirge that isLukas Graham

’s 7 Years – but picking on chart-toppers feels like a relic of a bygone age. 
Now that music criticism has shed its superiority complex, there’s little place 
for worst-in-show lists that seek to lambast the mainstream. All pleasures are 
innocent until found guilty.
