 to play for Nice.

Ben Arfa signed an 18-month deal with the French club after Newcastle 
terminated his contract 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/04/hatem-ben-arfa-newcastle-nice-released>
 but was denied clearance having already appeared in competitive games for two 
teams – Newcastle and Hull – this season.

Nice <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> contested the ruling on the 
basis that Ben Arfa had only represented Newcastle’s reserve team – but Fifa 
regulations regard “under-21 professional development league” matches as 
competitive fixtures.

As a result, Ben Arfa’s deal with Nice has been terminated – but he remains 
hopeful of finding a way forward. “Today I’m finished with Nice,” he said, “but 
maybe that won’t be for ever. I want to thank everyone here – it’s a real 
regret that I can’t continue, but sometimes you have to accept it and move on.

“Today I’ll try to be positive and see what I can do. On Monday I was on the 
floor but coming in to training today has made me feel better. Now I just have 
to do the best I can for the future. The solution may be to go abroad. Would I 
go to Russia? I’m ready to go to the north pole just to play football again. 
But for now I can’t really speculate – I just have to think.

“I won’t say I’m sick of French football, because there are good people here – 
I’m just disappointed and sad.”
