A game short on quality, high on passion (and fouls). In truth it was much 
more interesting what was going on in the stands than on the pitch. The fans 
were magnificent, if only everySerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> ground was like the 
Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Thanks for reading – bye!

90 min: Viviano comes out to collect another cross – Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> have resorted to pumping it long, 
probably not the worst idea with Matri and Pinilla up there. Three minutes 
added on for injury time.

88 min: Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, and Okaka 
is particular, are doing a good job of strangling this game. The Italian 
striker has held the ball up well, and tempts Genoa into conceding yet another 
free kick. More time to be wasted here, as Obiang comes off for Krsticic.

86 min: Matri is not getting the right service up top, so he drops deep to get 
the ball and immediately gets his head up to send an early ball into the box. 
Pinilla has no right to win the header but comes steaming in late, and is first 
to the ball, planting his header towards the near post. Viviano can’t be sure 
if it was creeping in or not, so tips it round for a corner. Viviano is wearing 
No2 on his back tonight by the way …

84 min: Chance for Genoa! Falcao gets his head on a cross and despite being 
completely unmarked sends it flying well over the bar. Should have done a lot 
better. Gabbiadini is off for Sansone.

82 min: Okaka hustles and bustles down the right with his back to goal, and 
shows great strength to shrug De Maio off before hitting a cross/shot that goes 
wide of the far post.There was nobody arriving late forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, Okaka was on his own.

78 min: Genoa have definitely now picked up the pace. There’s an urgency now 
that there wasn’t before. Obiang is booked, Genoa now have a free-kick from a 
very similar position thatSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> scored from, but it is a 
outswinging cross, headed away by Silvestre.

Sampdoria win a free-kick on the right touchline and Gabbidini sends an 
inswinger in with his left, which misses everyone and creeps inside the far 
post! Definite suspicions of offside there, nobody got a touch, but they 
definitely were active in play. Perin was helpless. Pandemonium in the away 
stands.

62 min: Sampdoria are kicking toward their considerable ‘away’ support now – 
Gabbiadini breaks foward from midfield, but just as he releases Obiang, the 
referee sounds his whistle. Antonelli has gone down with a head injury after a 
headed duel with Palombo, although replays show there was absolutely nothing 
wrong with the challenge.Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> fans go mad, obviously.

59 min: Perotti collects a diagonal and takes an early shot that fizzes wide 
of the near post.Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> need to get 
him in the game a bit more, he’s been isolated on the right in this second 
half. Perhaps he’ll move inside now, as Matri comes on to replace Kucka.

57 min: Just as I say that, Perin skews a back-pass that ends up going 
straight out for a corner! It is worth noting that it hit a bobble in the 
pitch. Matri getting ready to come on.

55 min: Perin is again quickly off his line to collect a bouncing 
through-pass. I’ve been impressed with the keeper’s presence, and he’s been 
excellent all season. He’s currently in the Italy U-21 side, but would not be 
surprised if Conte is here to cast his eye over Perin.Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have a corner, but again Perin 
makes the right decision to come off his line and punches away.

dangerously across the six-yard box, but Perotti can’t quite meet it at the

Sinisa Mihajlovic has got a big team-talk for Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> – he’s been quoting Che 
Guevara and Winston Churchill of late, no joke – his team have largely only 
threatened from set-pieces in the first half. Which wasn’t a problem when he 
was playing of course …


He holds the all-time Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> free-kick record with 27 
goals scored from free-kicks during his fourteen seasons in the top Italian 
league.

44 min: After a bright start, this half is coming to a scrappy end. Genoa are 
sitting back a bit and a little under the cosh. Sturaro bundles Gabbiadini off 
the ball, and it’s another set-piece opportunity forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, but it is blasted into the 
wall. The ball is lumped back in, and Silvestre takes a speculative volley from 
range, dragged well wide.

40 min: Eder wins the ball back off Perotti and eludes the challenge of 
Sturaro to win a free-kick. Palombo takes is short to and the ball is whipped 
in low from the left by Antonelli. It’s a wonderful delivery and a clearance 
from Pinilla is sliced just over the bar. That’s the closestSampdoria

38 min: Obiang gets his head up and floats a lovely diagonal toward Okaka who 
is clean through if he can beat the onrushing Perin to the ball … nope the 
goalkeeper just gets there first, that’s good anticipation from the mopp-haired 
21-year-old keeper, very quick off his line.

32 min: Mesbah makes another mess of it, and Perotti steals the ball. He 
dribbles straight at Romagnoli but the defender doesn’t go to ground (!) and 
wins the ball cleanly. As Perotti falls to the deck, his heel catches Romagnoli 
square in the face. Ouch!

27 min: Okaka is getting some rough treatment from De Maio. The striker could 
maybe be guilty of trying to do a little too much on his own, and he’s lost the 
ball a couple of times.


If one of the criticisms of Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> is how detached the fans 
are from the pitch, this is certainly not the case at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, 
the fans are closer than at most Premier League grounds, which is only adding 
to the atmosphere. Not sure if the way it was built was down to Genoa’s British 
heritage?

21 min: The challenges are flying in! The atmosphere and the referee’s 
leniency here encouraging the players to go in all studs flying. Okaka is the 
latest to be on the receiving end of one from Antonelli. After a quiet initial 
period,Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> have grown into this 
game, and most of their threat is coming from Perotti on this right-hand side.


For those of you tweeting to me in Italian, I’m afraid I haven’t the foggiest 
what you are saying. Apologies …

crossbar in the last minute against Brazil, and later went on to miss a penalty 
in the shootout.

9 min: Excellent counter-attack from Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>, they are sitting deep and spring 
out down the right through Eder and Perotti. Edenilson is lightning quick and 
sends a low cross in, but Kucka mis-controls it. Promising from the home side.

6 min: Sampdoria have definitely made the better start: Soriano gets free on 
the right and drills a cross into the penalty box, but it deflects behind. 
Palombo goes across to take it, he’s aSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> legend making his 361st 
appearance tonight, and predictably gets absolute pelters from the Genoa fans 
in that corner. The delivery is cleared and Gabbiadini flashes a long-range 
shot high and wide.

4 min: Okoka chases the ball down the right channel but can’t stop the ball 
from going out for a goal-kick. However, his momentum takes him into the 
advertising hoardings and he takes a hefty blow to the back of the head. Oooo 
that’s nasty. He’s up on his feet though.

If Genoa’s past is unusual, Sampdoria’s future could well be on the up: club 
president Massimo Ferrero announced earlier this month that he wanted to build
“the biggest stadium in Europe” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/12/sampdoria-shirts-billboards-films-massimo-ferrero>
.


“We’ll build a stadium by the sea, where everyone can take their boats in and 
watch the game, taste the pesto and see the other attractions ofGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>.” Lovely stuff.


The club have also made the unusual step of signing a short-term deal with a 
film distribution company: different films will appear on their shirts for 
different matches. Tonight: Sin City 3D.

If you want to read up a little bit more on Genoa, have a go on our Serie A 
alternative club guide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2014/apr/10/genoa-serie-a-alternative-club-guide>
, written by Richard Hall. It’s quite excellent, and explains, among other 
things the club’s British heritage and how the team was initially set up as a 
cricket club.

The teams:


Genoa (3-4-3): Perin; Roncaglia, De Maio, Burdisso; Edenilson, Rincon, 
Sturaro, Antonelli; Perotti, Pinilla, Kucka

Sampdoria (4-3-3): Viviano; De Silvestri, Silvestre, Romagnoli, Regini; 
Soriano, Palombo, Obiang; Gabbiadini, Okaka, Eder

Whilst I’ve given Pirlo’s book some airtime, it is worth noting how he talks 
about about Alessandro Matri, who only makes theGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> bench tonight despite netting 
twice in midweek against Verona.

“All he needs is a single touch and he’s get you a goal. Let him have another 
touch and he’ll score again. If I was a club president, a guy like Matri would 
be right at the top of my wish list. He comes with a billion-year guarantee.”

Big lyrics there from Andrea – it certainly seems a litle strange that Matri 
is not starting.

Other Italian things I have enjoyed this weekend. Andrea Pirlo’s book ‘I Think 
Therefore I Play’ <http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoSaifTIAAABHPz.jpg:medium>, 
Antonio Carluccio’s Desert Island Discs 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/60f233c8#b00cd5vz>
 and Mattia Destro’s outrageous 40-yard goal for Roma against Verona. All three 
made me go a little bit weak at the knees.

KICKTV (@KICKTV) 
Mattia Destro just scored this for Roma. Um. OK. https://t.co/s9sobGYlCp

Preamble

When Genoa and Sampdoria met this time last season in the derby della lanterna 
– literally the ‘derby of the lighthouse’ after the landmark that sits over the 
city’s port –, much of the build-up to the derby involved a Genoa coachbeing 
caught and subsequently suspended for spying on Sampdoria’s training sessions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/genoa-coach-spying-sampdoria-rambo>
. But the response from Sampdoria to these claims was typically magical.

“Like Rambo hidden among the branches on the hill, Luca De Pra, Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> goalkeeping coach and man of noble 
footballing ancestry, failed to overcome Sampdoria’s intelligence and counter 
intelligence operations.

“However, no prisoners were taken, and no blood was shed. Once tracked down 
and caught red-handed, the opposing side’s soldier was let free to return to 
base. You should always forgive your enemies, as nothing annoys them more.”

Can you imagine a Premier League club’s press office putting out a statement 
like that? Nope. Pure poetry, and the story is just a taster as to how unique 
the relationship between the two clubs can be.


Tonight’s derby is technically a home game for Genoa, but with the Stadio 
Luigi Ferraris belonging to both Genoa and Sampdoria, it is not seen in the 
same light.Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have made 
an excellent start to the season and will be looking to keep their unbeaten 
record intact, they could climb to third with a win. Genoa have made an 
unspectacular start to their campaign and sit in 10th, but are indebted to 
their young goalkeeper Mattia Perin for their five points thus far.

But don’t pay too much attention to the form-book, as with most derby games, 
it has sailed out of the proverbial window. And anyway, if the last few 
encounters between these two teams are anything to go by, the best bits are 
often away from the match action: I’m particularly looking forward to 
Sampdorian manager Sinisa Mihajlovic going postal in his technical area, huge 
incendiary banners in the stands, and wild, wide-eye goal celebrations. That’s 
if it’s not a boring 0-0.

Kick-off: 7.45pm BST

close  
A game short on quality, high on passion (and fouls). In truth it was much 
more interesting what was going on in the stands than on the pitch. The fans 
were magnificent, if only everySerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> ground was like the 
Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Thanks for reading – bye!

 
Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have won the derby 
della Lanterna.Sampdoria up to third!

 
90+2 min: Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> keeping 
the ball well. Genoa can’t get it!

 
90 min: Viviano comes out to collect another cross – Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> have resorted to pumping it long, 
probably not the worst idea with Matri and Pinilla up there. Three minutes 
added on for injury time.

 
88 min: Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, and Okaka 
is particular, are doing a good job of strangling this game. The Italian 
striker has held the ball up well, and tempts Genoa into conceding yet another 
free kick. More time to be wasted here, as Obiang comes off for Krsticic.

 
86 min: Matri is not getting the right service up top, so he drops deep to get 
the ball and immediately gets his head up to send an early ball into the box. 
Pinilla has no right to win the header but comes steaming in late, and is first 
to the ball, planting his header towards the near post. Viviano can’t be sure 
if it was creeping in or not, so tips it round for a corner. Viviano is wearing 
No2 on his back tonight by the way …

 
84 min: Chance for Genoa! Falcao gets his head on a cross and despite being 
completely unmarked sends it flying well over the bar. Should have done a lot 
better. Gabbiadini is off for Sansone.

 
82 min: Okaka hustles and bustles down the right with his back to goal, and 
shows great strength to shrug De Maio off before hitting a cross/shot that goes 
wide of the far post.There was nobody arriving late forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, Okaka was on his own. 

 
78 min: Genoa have definitely now picked up the pace. There’s an urgency now 
that there wasn’t before. Obiang is booked, Genoa now have a free-kick from a 
very similar position thatSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> scored from, but it is a 
outswinging cross, headed away by Silvestre.

 
Sampdoria win a free-kick on the right touchline and Gabbidini sends an 
inswinger in with his left, which misses everyone and creeps inside the far 
post! Definite suspicions of offside there, nobody got a touch, but they 
definitely were active in play. Perin was helpless. Pandemonium in the away 
stands.
 
Set-piece from Sampdoria! Sinisa Mihajlovic obviously had a word!

 
72 min: NORTH LONDON ALERT. A hopeful cross from Edenilson is collected by 
Viviano, who was of course on loan at Arsenal last season. Falque, previously 
of Tottenham, is about to come on forGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>.

 
70 min: Burdisso is limping, he’s replaced by Bertolacci. Straight swap.

 
67 min: Foul after foul after foul after foul. Can we go back to the first ten 
minutes when the referee was lenient? Hats off to the fans though, they haven’t 
stopped singing despite a dearth in quality.

 
65 min: Perotti has now moved to the left. Nothing is happening. In light of 
that, here’s David Platt scoring some goals forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> in the 1990s.
 
62 min: Sampdoria are kicking toward their considerable ‘away’ support now – 
Gabbiadini breaks foward from midfield, but just as he releases Obiang, the 
referee sounds his whistle. Antonelli has gone down with a head injury after a 
headed duel with Palombo, although replays show there was absolutely nothing 
wrong with the challenge.Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> fans go mad, obviously.

 
59 min: Perotti collects a diagonal and takes an early shot that fizzes wide 
of the near post.Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> need to get 
him in the game a bit more, he’s been isolated on the right in this second 
half. Perhaps he’ll move inside now, as Matri comes on to replace Kucka.

 
57 min: Just as I say that, Perin skews a back-pass that ends up going 
straight out for a corner! It is worth noting that it hit a bobble in the 
pitch. Matri getting ready to come on.

 
55 min: Perin is again quickly off his line to collect a bouncing 
through-pass. I’ve been impressed with the keeper’s presence, and he’s been 
excellent all season. He’s currently in the Italy U-21 side, but would not be 
surprised if Conte is here to cast his eye over Perin.Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have a corner, but again Perin 
makes the right decision to come off his line and punches away.

 
52 min: Pinilla is the latest to go into the book, tripping De Silvestri. How 
long will it be until Matri comes on?

 
49 min: Couple of bookings to report. Burdisso has had his coming for a while, 
while Eder has also been cautioned for a blatant tug asGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> were counter-attacking.

 
48 min: Sturaro gets behind De Silvestri on Genoa’s left and crosses 
dangerously across the six-yard box, but Perotti can’t quite meet it at the 
back post. The pitch is engulfed in thick smoke, with severalGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> flares making it very difficult to 
see what is going on.
 Genoa flares Photograph: Screenshot  
45 min: Free-kick conceded by Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> inside four seconds of the 
second-half… as you were then.

 
And we’re off again. Italian manager Antonio Conte lurking in the crowd.

 
Sinisa Mihajlovic has got a big team-talk for Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> – he’s been quoting Che 
Guevara and Winston Churchill of late, no joke – his team have largely only 
threatened from set-pieces in the first half. Which wasn’t a problem when he 
was playing of course …


He holds the all-time Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> free-kick record with 27 
goals scored from free-kicks during his fourteen seasons in the top Italian 
league.

 
Half-time entertainment: Furio does not like Genoa!


Don’t worry Furio, Napoli beat Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> on the opening day. Columbus Day 
is only a couple of weeks away for our American brothers/sisters, incidentally.

 
We’re all square.

 
44 min: After a bright start, this half is coming to a scrappy end. Genoa are 
sitting back a bit and a little under the cosh. Sturaro bundles Gabbiadini off 
the ball, and it’s another set-piece opportunity forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>, but it is blasted into the 
wall. The ball is lumped back in, and Silvestre takes a speculative volley from 
range, dragged well wide.

 
40 min: Eder wins the ball back off Perotti and eludes the challenge of 
Sturaro to win a free-kick. Palombo takes is short to and the ball is whipped 
in low from the left by Antonelli. It’s a wonderful delivery and a clearance 
from Pinilla is sliced just over the bar. That’s the closestSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have come!

 
38 min: Obiang gets his head up and floats a lovely diagonal toward Okaka who 
is clean through if he can beat the onrushing Perin to the ball … nope the 
goalkeeper just gets there first, that’s good anticipation from the mopp-haired 
21-year-old keeper, very quick off his line.

 
36 min: The referee has finally got his cards out – Silvestre is booked for a 
clumsy challenge though the back of Pinilla. Lots ofSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> protests fall on deaf ears, 
and rightly so.

 
32 min: Mesbah makes another mess of it, and Perotti steals the ball. He 
dribbles straight at Romagnoli but the defender doesn’t go to ground (!) and 
wins the ball cleanly. As Perotti falls to the deck, his heel catches Romagnoli 
square in the face. Ouch!

 
30 min: A deft flick releases Gabbiadini on the counter-attack but the Italian 
doesn’t have the pace to shake his marker and an intended pass to Okaka falls 
short. Okaka aside,Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> 
look as though they are struggling for pace generally.

 
27 min: Okaka is getting some rough treatment from De Maio. The striker could 
maybe be guilty of trying to do a little too much on his own, and he’s lost the 
ball a couple of times.


If one of the criticisms of Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> is how detached the fans 
are from the pitch, this is certainly not the case at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, 
the fans are closer than at most Premier League grounds, which is only adding 
to the atmosphere. Not sure if the way it was built was down to Genoa’s British 
heritage?

Tano Pecoraro/AP  
24 min: It’s been breathless but there is finally a lull in the pace of this 
game. TheSampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> back-four 
taking their foot off the gas and pinging it around.
FootballConnoisseur (@MalmoRook)

Samp is currently being played at the speed of light!#SerieA

<https://twitter.com/MalmoRook/status/516304160573390848>  
21 min: The challenges are flying in! The atmosphere and the referee’s 
leniency here encouraging the players to go in all studs flying. Okaka is the 
latest to be on the receiving end of one from Antonelli. After a quiet initial 
period,Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> have grown into this 
game, and most of their threat is coming from Perotti on this right-hand side.


For those of you tweeting to me in Italian, I’m afraid I haven’t the foggiest 
what you are saying. Apologies …

 
18 min: Mesbah hasn’t got up to speed yet, his miscontrol allows Kucka to nip 
in and steal the ball, but he can’t turn his marker. Well shepherded.

 
16 min: Genoa take a quick corner and catch the Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> defence sleeping. It’s an 
excellent cross from Edenilson but Silvestre heads clear. He’s furious with his 
teammates.

 
14 min: Pinilla drives inside from the left-flank and is chopped down just as 
he was winding up for a shot. Again no booking, much to the displeasure of the 
crowd. The free-kick crashes into the wall.

 
12 min: Pinilla crashes into De Silvestri with a very late challenge, he 
definitely should have been given a yellow there. Pinilla is a menace of a 
centre-forward and was signed forGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> to replace Gilardino. He was also 
at the World Cup if you remember with Chile, and crashed a shot against the 
crossbar in the last minute against Brazil, and later went on to miss a penalty 
in the shootout.
 
10 min: Regini appears to have picked up a knock and is replaced by Mesbah. 
That’s a like-for-like change at on the left side of defence forSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>. 

 
9 min: Excellent counter-attack from Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>, they are sitting deep and spring 
out down the right through Eder and Perotti. Edenilson is lightning quick and 
sends a low cross in, but Kucka mis-controls it. Promising from the home side.

 
6 min: Sampdoria have definitely made the better start: Soriano gets free on 
the right and drills a cross into the penalty box, but it deflects behind. 
Palombo goes across to take it, he’s aSampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> legend making his 361st 
appearance tonight, and predictably gets absolute pelters from the Genoa fans 
in that corner. The delivery is cleared and Gabbiadini flashes a long-range 
shot high and wide.

 
4 min: Okoka chases the ball down the right channel but can’t stop the ball 
from going out for a goal-kick. However, his momentum takes him into the 
advertising hoardings and he takes a hefty blow to the back of the head. Oooo 
that’s nasty. He’s up on his feet though.

 
2 min: Genoa get an early free-kick and waste no time in flooding the box. 
Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> clear, push further 
up the pitch and win one of their own. Well cleared. It is absolutely defeaning!

 
Peep peeeeeeep! We’re underway!

 
The teams are out. The fans are going nuts. Let’s do this!

If Genoa’s past is unusual, Sampdoria’s future could well be on the up: club 
president Massimo Ferrero announced earlier this month that he wanted to build
“the biggest stadium in Europe” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/12/sampdoria-shirts-billboards-films-massimo-ferrero>
.


“We’ll build a stadium by the sea, where everyone can take their boats in and 
watch the game, taste the pesto and see the other attractions ofGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>.” Lovely stuff.


The club have also made the unusual step of signing a short-term deal with a 
film distribution company: different films will appear on their shirts for 
different matches. Tonight: Sin City 3D.

If you want to read up a little bit more on Genoa, have a go on our Serie A 
alternative club guide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2014/apr/10/genoa-serie-a-alternative-club-guide>
, written by Richard Hall. It’s quite excellent, and explains, among other 
things the club’s British heritage and how the team was initially set up as a 
cricket club.

 
The teams:


Genoa (3-4-3): Perin; Roncaglia, De Maio, Burdisso; Edenilson, Rincon, 
Sturaro, Antonelli; Perotti, Pinilla, Kucka

Sampdoria (4-3-3): Viviano; De Silvestri, Silvestre, Romagnoli, Regini; 
Soriano, Palombo, Obiang; Gabbiadini, Okaka, Eder

Whilst I’ve given Pirlo’s book some airtime, it is worth noting how he talks 
about about Alessandro Matri, who only makes theGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> bench tonight despite netting 
twice in midweek against Verona.

“All he needs is a single touch and he’s get you a goal. Let him have another 
touch and he’ll score again. If I was a club president, a guy like Matri would 
be right at the top of my wish list. He comes with a billion-year guarantee.”

Big lyrics there from Andrea – it certainly seems a litle strange that Matri 
is not starting.

 
Other Italian things I have enjoyed this weekend. Andrea Pirlo’s book ‘I Think 
Therefore I Play’ <http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoSaifTIAAABHPz.jpg:medium>, 
Antonio Carluccio’s Desert Island Discs 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/60f233c8#b00cd5vz>
 and Mattia Destro’s outrageous 40-yard goal for Roma against Verona. All three 
made me go a little bit weak at the knees.

– literally the ‘derby of the lighthouse’ after the landmark that sits over the

caught and subsequently suspended for spying on Sampdoria’s training sessions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/genoa-coach-spying-sampdoria-rambo>

“Like Rambo hidden among the branches on the hill, Luca De Pra, Genoa

“However, no prisoners were taken, and no blood was shed. Once tracked down

Can you imagine a Premier League club’s press office putting out a statement 
like that? Nope. Pure poetry, and the story is just a taster as to how unique 
the relationship between the two clubs can be.


Tonight’s derby is technically a home game for Genoa, but with the Stadio 
Luigi Ferraris belonging to both Genoa and Sampdoria, it is not seen in the 
same light.Sampdoria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> have made 
an excellent start to the season and will be looking to keep their unbeaten 
record intact, they could climb to third with a win. Genoa have made an 
unspectacular start to their campaign and sit in 10th, but are indebted to 
their young goalkeeper Mattia Perin for their five points thus far.

But don’t pay too much attention to the form-book, as with most derby games, 
it has sailed out of the proverbial window. And anyway, if the last few 
encounters between these two teams are anything to go by, the best bits are 
often away from the match action: I’m particularly looking forward to 
Sampdorian manager Sinisa Mihajlovic going postal in his technical area, huge 
incendiary banners in the stands, and wild, wide-eye goal celebrations. That’s 
if it’s not a boring 0-0.

Kick-off: 7.45pm BST
