Today sees the launch of the debut collection for Kent & Curwen under the 
creative direction of Daniel Kearns and in partnership with David Beckham. It’s 
a heritage brand – and has been for 90 years – but with athleisure dominating 
menswear, it’s nice to have something a little more … real. Here is our 
standout piece – a vintage-look sports jersey (which happens to be Beckham’s 
choice piece).
