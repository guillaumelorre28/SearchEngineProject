Dennis, chairman and chief executive of the McLaren Group, owns 25% of the 
business, with another 25% owned by his business partner Mansour Ojjeh, with 
the remaining 50% owned by a Bahraini sovereign wealth fund.

According to Sky News, Dennis presented the offer for McLaren last week, with 
fellow shareholders launching a plot to remove him as chief executive. 
According to Sky sources, Dennis appeared in the high court on Thursday and 
Friday in an attempt to get an injunction against a move to place him on 
gardening leave until the end of his contract in mid-January.

McLaren were thought to be holding an emergency board meeting on Friday to 
deal with the situation.

Dennis, 69, who has a 35-year association with the company, built McLaren’s F1 
team up to be the strongest in the world, with former champions including 
Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, James Hunt, Niki Lauda and Lewis Hamilton. But with 
other major figures, including the sport’s CEO, Bernie Ecclestone, and Frank 
Williams thought to be approaching the last phase of their involvement with the 
sport, F1 could be entering a new epoch under its new owners, Liberty Media.

When contacted by The Guardian on Friday night McLaren would not comment.
