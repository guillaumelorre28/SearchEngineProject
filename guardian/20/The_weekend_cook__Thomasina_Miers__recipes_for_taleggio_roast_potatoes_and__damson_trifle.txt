Our bay tree is one of the best buys we’ve ever made. Bays grow happily in a 
pot or in the ground and, once they take to their new home, have to be 
regularly pruned to keep them under control, which has obvious benefits for the 
cook of the house. Even so, bay has a very underrated scent. Sure, it’s the 
solid stalwart of the stock pot, but beyond that it tends to get overlooked. 
Not in our house, though, because bay is delicious in all kinds of dishes, from 
poached pears (or plums or damsons, as in today’s second recipe) to simple 
creams and savoury rubs. I also regularly blitz a handful of bay leaves with 
other herbs and salt, and smear the result over a joint of meat or fish, or 
tuck it into the cavities.

Our plum tree is another source of regular pleasure and every year around this 
time, we are awash with its fruit. Being at the front of the house, our tree 
also provides passers-by with free treats.

Balsamic-baked new potatoes with taleggio cheese and bay

This is a brilliantly satisfying dinner in its own right, but if you need 
something more, serve alongside roast pork or a Barnsley chop. Serves four as a 
main course, more as a side.

1 large white onion, peeled and halved 
1kg new potatoes
Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
5 bay leaves (fresh, ideally)
150g taleggio, sliced
100g rocket leaves
A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked
20g finely shaved parmesan
1 lemon, juiced
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Cut the onion into thick pieces across 
the halves; leave the potatoes whole or, if they are on the large side, cut 
them into bite-sized pieces. Toss the potatoes and onion in half a teaspoon of 
flaky sea salt (less if using fine sea salt), lay them in an oven tray and 
roast for 30-40 minutes, until golden and tender.

Tip the cooked veg into an oven dish and pour the vinegar over the top. Toss 
to coat, then tuck in the bay leaves and cover with the slices of taleggio. 
Season with a touch more salt and lots of pepper, and bake for 10 minutes, 
until the cheese is bubbling and golden.

Meanwhile, put the rocket, thyme leaves and parmesan in a bowl, dress with the 
lemon juice and oil, season generously and toss gently. Serve with the hot, 
cheesy potatoes.

We are rich with damsons and plums in this country, so use any variety you 
like. Serves four.

20 ripe damsons or 10 plums
20g dark brown sugar 
1 cinnamon stick 
3 cloves 
2 star anise 
1 lemon, zest peeled off in long strips (use a vegetable peeler)
100ml damson (or plum) vodka (or brandy if you have neither)

For the sponge 
100g caster sugar 
4 large free-range eggs 
100g self-raising flour

For the custard 
300ml double cream
1 tbsp damson vodka (optional)
1 vanilla pod
3 egg yolks
50g caster sugar 

To finish
600ml double cream, whipped to soft peaks
25g flaked almonds 
25g pecans, slightly crushed
5 biscotti, crushed

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Grease and line a 33cm x 23cm roll tin 
with baking paper.

First, make the sponge. In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until light 
and frothy, then sift in the flour and gently fold in to combine. Pour into the 
prepared tin and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden, bouncy and a 
skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool.

Halve and stone the damsons or plums, then put in a wide pan with the sugar, 
spices, lemon rind and a splash of water. Cook on a high heat for a minute or 
two, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the 
fruit is very tender.

While the fruit is cooking, make the custard. Heat the cream, vodka (if using) 
and vanilla pod until just below boiling point. Remove the vanilla pod, split 
it lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream mix; leave to cool and 
infuse. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar until thick and pale, then whisk in 
the cream mix. Tip back into the pan, and stir for 10-15 minutes over a medium 
heat, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon.

Now build the trifle. Put the sponge in the base of a transparent, two-litre 
bowl, pressing it firmly into the base. Spoon over the vodka and some of the 
cooking juices from the fruit, then spoon the damsons over the sponge, making 
sure they go right to the edges of the bowl (make sure there are no errant 
stones). Top the fruit with the custard.

Whip the cream to soft peaks and spoon in large dollops on top of the custard. 
Sprinkle with the crushed pecans, toasted almonds, biscotti and a little extra 
plum syrup (if you want to gild the lily, grate over 20g of very dark 
chocolate, too).

And for the rest of the week…

The taleggio bake can very easily be turned into a richer, meatier dish. Dice 
the cheese into 1cm cubes, then mix with a chopped onion, a crushed clove of 
garlic and some lardons, then sprinkle over the potatoes before baking. If, 
like me, you’re looking to use up excess plums or damsons, turn them into a 
ripple ice-cream. Just double the quantities in the trifle custard, then 
stir-freeze or churn in an ice-cream machine; purée the fruit and, as the 
custard thickens, pour it in bit by bit and stir so it ripples through the ice. 
Bay leaves make a delicious ice-cream, too: infuse them in the cream with the 
vanilla pod, or poach with the plums (add a vanilla pod or essence for a more 
classic flavouring). If you have a glut of plums, turn them into jam; vanilla 
and star anise is just one excellent pairing.
