 from St-Etienne for an undisclosed fee.

Aubameyang, a 24-year-old Gabon international, has agreed a contract with the 
Champions League finalists until summer 2018.

"We are very pleased that in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang we were able to sign a 
player we really wanted," said the Dortmund sporting director, Michael Zorc. 
"He is offensively very versatile, has a lot of pace in his game, is a threat 
in front of goal and will provide us with more options."

Aubameyang had been tracked by Newcastle for at least the past year and had 
spoken of them as "a good club" with a "monumental stadium".
