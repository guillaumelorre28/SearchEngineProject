French referees will refuse to officiate at a replay of a French league first 
division match between Racing Strasbourg andMetz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/metz> after violence during recent games, 
their union said yesterday.

In the most serious incident, a match between Strasbourg and Metz in December 
was abandoned after the female assistant referee Nelly Viennot was hit by a 
firecracker.

The French National League disciplinary committee has ordered the match to be 
replayed behind closed doors but referees said they would not take part. "This 
match was a much too bitter pill to swallow and we won't swallow it," Bernard 
Saules, the head of the referees' union, said. "We won't referee it."

Last weekend, referees staged a protest against the recent violence with 
officials holding up the kick-off at one match and handing out leaflets to 
players at another. The French Football Federation yesterday met referees to 
discuss the problem.

 The Coventry City chairman Bryan Richardson is to impose life bans on 
supporters found responsible for the violence at Maine Road on Saturday. Shaun 
Goater's injury-time winner for Manchester City in the FA Cup led to fighting 
in the main stand.
