Atalanta <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atalanta> players broke off a 
training session for 10 minutes on Saturday to be lectured by fans who are 
furious at the team’s poor recent performances.

The players were taking part in an open training session at their Stadio 
Azzurri d’Italia when around 1,500 fans, who were watching from one of the 
stands, began protesting. The session was interruptedand a video posted on 
Gazzetta dello Sport’s website 
<http://www.gazzetta.it/include_hp/VideoWall.shtml?pos=2> showed the players 
standing in line in front of the stand, listening to an angry rant by one of 
the fans’ leaders, named by the newspaper as Claudio Galimberti. Other fans 
applauded as Galimberti vented his wrath at the players, who remained in front 
of the stand without flinching.

“We’re fed up with losing face,” Galimberti was reported to have said. “We do 
not want to see the opposition controlling the game on our pitch, we have 
become a home for other teams.”

Galimberti also told the players to act as professionals and that he did not 
want to see them in nightclubs.

The Bergamo-based team, who host Sassuolo in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> on Sunday, have dropped 
to 17th in the 20-team table, four points and one place clear of the relegation 
zone.
