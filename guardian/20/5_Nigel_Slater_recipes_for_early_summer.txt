The summer brings with it a change of step in the kitchen. Suddenly our 
cooking is heady with the scent of mint and basil, of ripe melons and warm, 
sweet cherries. The mood is lighter and there is a vibrancy and freshness to 
the food on our plates. Green is the predominant colour. Herbs come into the 
kitchen in generous bunches, and many meals are eaten outdoors. This month’s 
recipes are the very essence of the early summer kitchen.

Roast chicken, mango and ginger salad

A refreshing salad made all the better with the inclusion of the chicken’s 
roasting juices. A little sugar will balance any dressing in which there is 
lime juice and fish sauce. If you are using caster rather than the palm sugar I 
suggest then you will need much less. Start with a teaspoon then taste and 
adjust as you go.


Serves 2-3
chicken breasts 2
olive oil
salt and black pepper
ginger a thumb-sized piece
cucumber 1
limes juice of 2, about 100ml
mangoes 3 medium-sized, ripe
fish sauce 40ml
palm sugar 2-3 level tbsp
parsley 15g

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Put the chicken in a roasting tin, brush with 
a little olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Bake for 30-35 
minutes till the skin is crisp and golden and the juices are clear when the 
flesh is pierced with a skewer. Set aside, reserving the roasting juices.


Peel the ginger. Peel the cucumber, slice in half lengthways then scrape out 
the seeds and pulp from the centre with a teaspoon. Cut the flesh into pencil 
thin slices and put them in a mixing bowl. Remove the chicken from the oven 
when it is ready, leave to rest for 10-15 minutes, then slice each breast into 
three thick pieces and add to the cucumber.

Cut the limes in half and squeeze them into a bowl (you need about 100ml of 
juice). Peel the mangoes and thickly slice the flesh, keeping the cut pieces 
brushed or dipped in a little of the lime juice to stop them browning. Finely 
grate the ginger into the lime juice, then stir in the fish sauce and palm 
sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Pull the parsley leaves from their 
stems and add to the dressing, together with the reserved roasting juices. Toss 
the mango and chicken with the dressing. Pile onto a large dish or into a bowl 
and serve while the chicken is still warm.

There is a moment, when you stir the hot juices from the roast into the dill- 
and bean-flecked grain, that make this one of my favourite ways to eat lamb. 
Its success will depend mostly on whether the meat is cooked to your liking and 
my timing is for a rare-ish finish. Tweak the timings to suit your own taste. 
If you have any left over, the meat can be torn into short pieces and folded 
through the freekeh for lunch.


Serves 4
garlic 3 cloves
salt
olive oil 2 tbsp
za’atar 3 tbsp
lemon juice of 3
small leg of lamb 1.5kg

For the freekeh
freekeh 75g
broad beans 400g
olive oil 4 tbsp
radishes 100g, sliced into rounds
dill a handful

Peel the garlic and crush the cloves in a blender or a mortar with a little 
salt and the olive oil and za’atar, then blend in the lemon juice. Place the 
lamb in a roasting tin then pierce it all over with a stainless steel skewer. 
Spoon half of marinade over the lamb then set aside for an hour or two. Set the 
oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Roast the lamb in the oven for about 1 hour 25 minutes 
to 1 hour and 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your meat. Baste three 
or four times during cooking. Half way through the cooking time pour over the 
remaining marinade.

Boil the freekeh in lightly salted water for 20 minutes then drain. Boil the 
broad beans in salted water for 8-10 minutes depending on their size, then 
drain them and briefly refresh under cold running water. Pop the beans from 
their papery skins with your thumb and forefinger. Fold the beans and olive oil 
through the freekeh. Thinly slice the radishes, chop the dill then fold into 
the salad.

Remove the lamb from the oven and leave to rest for 20 minutes before carving 
and serving with the broad bean salad.

Courgettes, baked in olive oil and herbs, crop up throughout the summer in 
this kitchen. We eat them straight from the oven with garlic-rubbed toast or 
cool (not chilled) with mozzarella and tufts of vivid green watercress. This 
week I ate them with yogurt that I had strained over muslin till it was as 
thick as cream cheese, then trickled it with herb oil and toasted sesame.


Serves 4
yogurt 500g
courgette 1 large
garlic 2 cloves
lemon thyme leaves 2 tsp
olive oil 4 tbsp
golden sesame seeds 1 tsp
black sesame seeds 1 tsp
parsley, chives, tarragon 3tbsp, mixed and chopped

Line a sieve or colander with muslin or a new J cloth and place it over a deep 
mixing bowl. Scrape the yogurt into the sieve and leave for a good 3 or 4 
hours, in a very cool place, to drain.


Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Wipe the courgette and cut into diagonal 
slices approximately ½cm thick. Line a grill pan or baking sheet with foil, 
place the courgette slices in a single layer, their edges not quite touching.

Peel and slice the garlic, or crush it if you prefer, then mix it with the 
lemon thyme leaves and olive oil. Brush the courgette with the herb oil then 
bake for 20-25 minutes, turning once, until they are golden. Remove the 
courgette slices from the pan to a large serving plate, reserving their cooking 
juices.

Toast all the sesame seeds in a dry, non-stick pan and set aside. Stir the 
finely chopped parsley leaves, chives and tarragon into the courgette cooking 
juices together with the toasted sesame seeds.

Spoon the strained labneh on the plate with the courgettes then spoon over the 
herb and sesame oil.

Pistachio and lemon thyme biscuits

Baked, initially, to offer with a platter of blood-red cherries, I find these 
crisp yet chewy biscuits are even more suited to contrast the softness of a 
fool or to crumble over the surface of a summer ice. Let the biscuits settle 
for 10 minutes before lifting them from their baking sheet, then eat a few of 
them warm, before they have time to crisp.


Makes 8-10
shelled pistachios 45g
ground almonds 30g
butter 125g
icing sugar 50g
lemon thyme leaves 1 tbsp
plain flour 75g

To finish
dried rose petals 2 tsp
roughly chopped pistachios 2 tbsp

Grind the pistachios coarsely – they should not be quite as fine as 
ready-ground almonds – then mix them with the almonds. Put the butter in the 
bowl of a food mixer fitted with a flat paddle attachment, add the icing sugar 
and beat to a soft cream. Chop the lemon thyme leaves and add to the creamed 
butter and sugar. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.


Mix the ground nuts and the plain flour with the creamed butter, sugar and 
thyme and roll into a soft dough. Chill in the fridge for a good 30 minutes. 
Set the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.

Lightly flour a work surface, divide the mixture into 8 to 10 equal lumps then 
roll each into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and flatten them 
slightly with a fork. (They will spread as they bake.)

Bake for 8-12 minutes until the biscuits are pale gold in colour, remove from 
the oven and scatter with the rose petals and the roughly chopped pistachios. 
Leave the biscuits in place for a few minutes until cool enough to move 
carefully to a cooling rack with the aid of a palette knife.

Chilled rice, apricot compote and sesame

 The compote gets silkier as it cools. Chilled overnight, it can be spooned 
over breakfast yogurt or porridge. At first sight, the rice will appear a 
little on the thin side, but will thicken once thoroughly chilled. If too thick 
to start with, the rice tends to set in the fridge. You can adjust the texture 
with a splash of cream or a few spoonfuls of yogurt. I have been known to eat 
chilled creamy rice and apricot compote by the bowlful for breakfast.

Serves 6
For the rice
pudding or Arborio rice 150g
water 500ml
full cream milk 500ml
caster sugar 4 tbsp
sesame seeds 3 tbsp

For the compote
apricots 350g
cherries 200g
caster sugar 75g
water 100ml

Put the rice in a saucepan with the water and milk and bring to the boil. 
Lower the heat and leave the rice simmering gently for about 20 minutes till 
tender. I don’t think “al dente” is appropriate here. Stir in the sugar then 
set aside. When the rice is cool, leave it in the fridge for a good couple of 
hours to chill and thicken.


Slice the apricots in half and discard the stones, then halve and stone the 
cherries. Put the fruit in a saucepan with the sugar and water and bring to the 
boil. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for about 15 minutes till the fruit is 
soft. Scoop the fruit out with a draining spoon and transfer to a bowl, then 
turn up the heat and boil the syrup for five minutes or so, until it has 
reduced by half. Pour the syrup over the fruit, cool and refrigerate.

Toast the sesame seeds in a dry, non-stick pan till golden then tip half into 
a mortar and grind to a coarse powder.

Serve the chilled rice with the apricot and cherry compote, and a scattering 
of sesame powder and whole toasted seeds.
