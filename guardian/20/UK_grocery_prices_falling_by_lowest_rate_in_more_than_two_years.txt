Grocery prices are falling by just 0.1%, the lowest rate in more than two 
years, as increases in the cost of fresh fish, beer and chilled ready meals 
offset falls in basics, including vegetables, eggs and pork.

In the three months to 4 December, deflation in the grocery market fell to its 
lowest level since September 2014, according to industry data from Kantar 
Worldpanel, narrowing from a 0.5% drop reported last month.

Despite near flat prices overall, Tesco was the only one of the big four 
supermarkets to record sales growth, according to Kantar, up 1.6% but stilla 
slowdown from the 2.2% reported last month

Sales fell at Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, by 0.6%, 4.7% and 1.4% 
respectively, but all three improved their performance compared with last month 
as shoppers snapped up their premium own-label ranges ahead of Christmas.

Fraser McKevitt, of Kantar Worldpanel, said Morrisons’ The Best and Asda’s 
Extra Special put on particularly impressive performances, with sales 
increasing by 35% and 15% respectively.

In contrast, there was a further slowdown in sales growth at discounters Aldi 
and Lidl. Although Aldi is still the fastest-growing chain in the market, with 
sales up 10%, Lidl’s pace of growth slipped to 5.7%, from 6.1% last month. For 
the second month in a row it was outpaced by the British discounter Iceland, 
where sales rose 8.6%.

The discounters are coming under pressure after the big four cut prices on key 
lines in a bid to fight back more effectively. Meanwhile, as inflation has 
begun to kick in as a result of the falling value of the pound against the euro 
and the dollar since the Brexit vote, the discounters have beenforced to put up 
the price of basics, including milk and bananas

Data from another market research agency, Nielsen, suggested grocery market 
sales in the four weeks to 3 December had fallen by 0.4% as the volume of goods 
slid 0.3% – the first time sales and volumes had dropped since July.

Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer and business insight, put this 
down to the distraction of Black Friday, the US-inspired discount day in late 
November, which he said had encouraged shoppers to buy non-food items elsewhere.


Watkins said he expected momentum to build in the runup to Christmas, helped 
by Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday.
 Nielsen estimates shoppers will spend around £4bn at supermarkets in the 
final week, with 22 December expected to be the biggest day of the year. “This 
year should end on a bit of a high note, with more visits that week, and sales 
up versus last year despite the ongoing price deflation,” he said.
