 to stay seven points behind with three games left.

A deflected first-half effort by Arturo Vidal and a 79th-minute goal from 
Douglas Costa were enough to give treble-chasing Bayern the three points in a 
lacklustre game, the result of which left Hertha in fourth place.

Bayern, who take on Atlético Madrid in the Champions League last four next 
week, are on 81 points and will seal the title with victory over Borussia 
Mönchengladbach next week.
