When I was a young law student I went for my first pap smear at a local GP. As 
he was removing the speculum he commented casually, “You know, you have a 
really nice pussy”.

It took me five years to go for another test. I was 19 and I didn’t think 
about complaining to anyone. I just took a very long shower.

I also did something else that day. I got out a mirror and had a proper look. 
The whole shebang – outer lips, inner lips, clitoris and urethra. And my vagina 
– the opening that my beautiful babies eventually came out of.

More young girls asking GPs about genital cosmetic surgery, study finds

Like many young women, I’d never acquainted myself with the features of what 
my GP had taken a way too interested look at. Male genitalia is out there. It’s 
dangly. Boys joke and talk about it all the time.

But female genitals are still in the closet – despite some fabulous feminist 
attempts to get them out of our undies and proudly on display.The Guardian has 
recently posted a fabulous series on our VGs.

isn’t technically a catch-all term but it’s the best one we have for now, which 
shows us whatmany of us don’t know about our downstairs bits.

A disturbing new study 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/06/more-young-girls-asking-gp-genital-cosmetic-surgery-study-finds>
 by Dr Magdalena Simonis from the University of Melbourne’s department of 
general practice, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that there has been 
a threefold increase in women requesting labiaplasty – cosmetic surgery to 
their vaginas.

She interviewed more than 400 GPs, most of them specialising women’s health. 
They reported an alarming rise in the number of women requesting advice on 
labiaplasty.

So what are we to make of this? Vaginas come in all sizes, shapes and colours. 
Like all good things. But do most women, particularly young women, know that?

Simonis is concerned that fashion, online pornography and beauty ideals are 
playing into this new trend. And she’s probably right. The reality is we don’t 
really know. We need more interdisciplinary research across medical science and 
the humanities to understand this trend.

Many young women in my study told me how shamed they felt about their bodies

As someone who has done recent large-scale research into young people and 
online media, I’m aware that most young people are not watching the Barbie 
Doll-style porn older generations associate with porn. You know – the 90s 
Hollywood porn where women called Bambi, Mandi and Candi pretend to be lesbians 
with fake breasts and nails? You can take the Fifth Amendment if you want but 
you do know.

That’s not the kind of sexually explicit material that most younger people 
look at. A lot of it they create themselves. Old people call it “sexting”.Young 
people <https://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople> don’t. They call it 
sharing images of their bodies, which suggest there are many kinds of vaginas 
involved.

Young women don’t go looking for online porn. On the other hand, they are 
drowning in a culture where perfecting their bodies is seen as paramount.

Many young women in my study told me how shamed they felt about their bodies – 
if they flaunted their conventional attractiveness too much they were shamed 
for that. If they didn’t stack up to male ideals of beauty they were shamed for 
that.

And when I asked young women, in an age-appropriate way, about whether they 
had access to information about how to have sexual pleasure, many of them 
averted their gaze. The young guys laughed it up when I asked the same question.

There’s a core issue here – we don’t talk about vaginas. We don’t talk about 
how they can be a source of pleasure for women. We don’t talk about how they 
are all different. And we don’t tell young women and men that there’s no 
“normal” vagina.

I understand that young men are increasingly coming under pressure about their 
bodies and their genitalia too. But a good start in changing the relationship 
young women have to their bodies – and young men do too – might be to start 
talking more openly about women’s vaginas.

Female genital mutilation is alive in Australia. It's just called labiaplasty

I’d like to see sex education classes where someone explains the role of the 
clitoris. Then we could move on to talking about how fabulously multitasking 
vaginas are – a bit like breasts. Western society obsessively sexualises 
breasts and vaginas but ignores the wonderful work they also do in bringing 
children into this world and feeding them.

In the meantime, we should applaud Simonis for her study. We need to know a 
lot more about young women and why they are so anxious about their bodies.

Her research confirms a large study conducted in the UK in 2012, which found 
there is agrowing trend for women to request cosmetic surgery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/30/girls-aged-five-worried-about-body-image?newsfeed=true>
 – for all areas of the body. Figures havecontinued to increase since then 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/03/cosmetic-surgery-operations-top-50000>
 and the vast majority are still women.

As a feminist I was hoping things would have changed by now. Time, perhaps, 
for all us girls to get out that mirror and say, “Looks fab to me.”
