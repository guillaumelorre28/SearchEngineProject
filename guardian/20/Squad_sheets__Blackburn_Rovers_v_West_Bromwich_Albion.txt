Beckham and Ronaldinho saying no and a move for Juan Román Riquelme likely to 
be delayed until the summer, Ewood Park is still awaiting the marquee signing 
promised by Blackburn's new owners. Nevertheless, some of the fruits of Venky's 
investment should be on display against a West Brom side that halted a run of 
five straight defeats last weekend. Both Roque Santa Cruz and Jermaine Jones, 
brought in from Manchester City and Schalke respectively, are possible starters 
against the visitors, who have not won at Ewood in nearly 20 years.Tim Rich
