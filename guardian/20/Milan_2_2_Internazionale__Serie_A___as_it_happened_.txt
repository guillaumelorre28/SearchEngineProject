Full-time! Milan 2-2 Inter

And that is the last piece of action. Ivan Perisic’s injury time equaliser 
ensures the 165th derby ends 2-2.Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> were second best for long spells 
but led twice and were denied a victory that would have sent them second on 
their own. Instead they are tired with Roma, while Inter climb to ninth thanks 
to this point. What a game. Thanks for reading. Bye!

74 min: Bonaventura rolls the ball to Kucka, He blasts about 10m over the bar. 
Dismal, but they have killed a fair chunk of time.

72 min: Bonaventura dribbles in from the left and is dragged down by 
Kondogbia, who is already on a yellow, about 30 yards from goal. That will 
waste another minute.

71 min: Brosovic’s delivery from the corner meets Murillo’s head, but he 
cannot find the target. The ball drifts wide to the left of Donnarumma’s net. 
The keeper is then given a warning for taking his time over the goal-kick.

67 min: Perisic goes close again. It’s far more difficult than the three first 
half chances he missed but this is the closest of all. Candreva finds him with 
a no-backlift pass, the Croatian controls and turns. From a tight angle his 
shot looks to have Donnarumma beaten but it flashes across goal and narrowly 
wide.

66 min: Inter now look a tad frustrated and you get the sense Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> could punish them again on the 
break. Nagatomo has replaced Ansaldi, which is a clever decision.

64 min: Ansaldi fouls Suso again and the Inter players are quick to rush over 
and ask for a second yellow. The referee ignores their calls, though. This must 
be the Inter left-back’s final chance.

60 min: Suso is now clumsily fouled by Ansaldi, who has already been booked. 
It’s a free-kick and if the Inter defender commits another like that he will be 
off.

Goal! Milan 2-1 Inter (Suso)

58 min: And Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are back in 
front once more! Wow. Suso skips past an embarrassingly bad challenge from 
Miranda after good build up from Bonaventura and Bacca, before sliding a tidy 
left-footed finish low to Handanovic’s right.

57 min: Brozovic feeds Mario down the right. He throws a good dummy to get

56 min: This game had started tentatively and if you had not watched a Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> derby you would have been right 
to ponder what the fuss was about but the start of this second half has been 
wonderful.

Goal! Milan 1-1 Inter (Candreva)

53 min: What a hit from Antonio Candreva, the man that accused Piolo of 
kicking him out of Lazio! A simple throw in on the left is worked to Candreva 
in a central position withMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> 
arguing that the decision should have gone their way. In any case he takes a 
touch before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top right corner. 
Donnarumma gets a touch but no keeper in the world would be able to keep out 
such a thumping strike. This is suddenly looking like a great game.

51 min: Candreva unleashes a right-footed drive from 25 yards. Donnarumma 
parries it but has time to smother at the second time of asking. The game is 
opening up quite a bit now.

Goal! Milan 1-0 Inter (Suso)

43 min: But whatever, seconds later Suso has scored having been set up by 
Bacca! At the opposite end Candreva had shot straight at Donnamurra, who set 
Milan on the counter rapidly. Bacca danced forward centrally before finding 
Suso to his right. The midfielder cut in past Ansaldi and curled past 
Handanovic with a magnificent finish. They have been dreadful for most of this 
game butMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> lead!

And that is the last piece of action. Ivan Perisic’s injury time equaliser 
ensures the 165th derby ends 2-2.Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> were second best for long spells 
but led twice and were denied a victory that would have sent them second on 
their own. Instead they are tired with Roma, while Inter climb to ninth thanks 
to this point. What a game. Thanks for reading. Bye!
 
90 min +3: Immediately from the restart Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> attack and Pasalic drives wide.
 
90 min +2: Oh wow! They’ve done it. The corner is flicked on by Murillo 
towards Perisic at the backpost and he bundles home from a couple of yards.
 
90 min +1: Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> have everybody 
back and are clinging on. D’Ambrosio finds Jovetic with a cross from the right 
but Abate is on hand to deflect the sub’s header out for a corner. Handanovic 
is on his way up …
 
90 min: There will be a minimum of three minutes added time.
 
89 min: Another minute passes by without any bother for Donnarumma.
 
88 min: Inter are dominant but Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are shutting the game down well. 
Their final sub sees Pasalic, on loan from Chelsea, trot on for Bonaventura.
 
86 min: Jovetic hits a hopeless through ball forward that ends up rolling out 
for a goal-kick, ruining the momentum built up by Inter.
 
85 min: Inter are turning up the heat, Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are sitting deep. Will there be 
a leveller?
 
84 min: Big chance for Icardi. He runs towards the front stick and meets a 
Perisic cross from the left. Donnarumma saves.
 
82 min: The game is becoming quite fragmented now, there are lots of cynical 
fouls and the referee’s whistle is permanently attached to his mouth.
 
79 min: Milan’s second switch: Lapadula replaces Niang.
 
78 min: Jovetic’s first act is to be booked for putting an arm across 
Bonaventura as theMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> 
midfielder broke. That was silly – Jovetic is quick and has fresh legs.
 
76 min: Perisic has a deflected shot that’s heading out for a corner until 
Donnarumma riskily makes his way out to save. The ball spills from underneath 
him but he keeps hold of it with a second attempt.
 
75 min: Inter’s second sub sees Jovetic (remember him?) enter in place of 
Brozovic.
 
74 min: Bonaventura rolls the ball to Kucka, He blasts about 10m over the bar. 
Dismal, but they have killed a fair chunk of time.
 
72 min: Bonaventura dribbles in from the left and is dragged down by 
Kondogbia, who is already on a yellow, about 30 yards from goal. That will 
waste another minute.
 
71 min: Brosovic’s delivery from the corner meets Murillo’s head, but he 
cannot find the target. The ball drifts wide to the left of Donnarumma’s net. 
The keeper is then given a warning for taking his time over the goal-kick.
 
70 min: Perisic wins a corner off Locatelli. Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> make their first sub: Fernandez 
replaces Bacca.
 
69 min: Icardi misses another glorious chance. He escapes Gomez with ease but 
snatches at Brozovic’s through ball and Donnarumma makes an easy stop.
 
67 min: Perisic goes close again. It’s far more difficult than the three first 
half chances he missed but this is the closest of all. Candreva finds him with 
a no-backlift pass, the Croatian controls and turns. From a tight angle his 
shot looks to have Donnarumma beaten but it flashes across goal and narrowly 
wide.
 
66 min: Inter now look a tad frustrated and you get the sense Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> could punish them again on the 
break. Nagatomo has replaced Ansaldi, which is a clever decision.
 
64 min: Ansaldi fouls Suso again and the Inter players are quick to rush over 
and ask for a second yellow. The referee ignores their calls, though. This must 
be the Inter left-back’s final chance.
 
63 min: Mario sends in a cross from the left that is too deep and Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> have a goal-kick.
 
61 min: Kucka finds Suso again. He tries to be a tad too clever this time and 
is dispossessed by Miranda.
 
60 min: Suso is now clumsily fouled by Ansaldi, who has already been booked. 
It’s a free-kick and if the Inter defender commits another like that he will be 
off.
 
58 min: And Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are back in 
front once more! Wow. Suso skips past an embarrassingly bad challenge from 
Miranda after good build up from Bonaventura and Bacca, before sliding a tidy 
left-footed finish low to Handanovic’s right.
 
57 min: Brozovic feeds Mario down the right. He throws a good dummy to get 
past De Sciglio but his shot is tame and Donnarumma saves.
 
56 min: This game had started tentatively and if you had not watched a Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> derby you would have been right 
to ponder what the fuss was about but the start of this second half has been 
wonderful.
 
53 min: What a hit from Antonio Candreva, the man that accused Piolo of 
kicking him out of Lazio! A simple throw in on the left is worked to Candreva 
in a central position withMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> 
arguing that the decision should have gone their way. In any case he takes a 
touch before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top right corner. 
Donnarumma gets a touch but no keeper in the world would be able to keep out 
such a thumping strike. This is suddenly looking like a great game.
 
52 min: Suso tries his luck, this time on his left after cutting in again from 
the right. It fizzes well wide.
 
51 min: Candreva unleashes a right-footed drive from 25 yards. Donnarumma 
parries it but has time to smother at the second time of asking. The game is 
opening up quite a bit now.
 
49 min: Ansaldi is booked for fouling Suso, who then takes the free-kick. From 
it Kondogbia concedes a corner and Handanovic does what Donnarumma did moment 
earlier to claim.
 
47 min: Inter win a corner. Brozovic’s inswinger is confidently picked from 
the air by Donnarumma, who then releases the ball immediately to Bacca. The 
Colombian is unable to control.
 
46 min: Inter get the game going again. Can they convert their dominance of 
possession into an equalising goal?
 
An email from Kabir Sethi: “As an Inter fan I was hoping for the exact 
opposite – get dominated, sneak a counter attack goal from random moment of 
Icardi genius. Oh well.”
 
An email from JR in Illinois: “In the new world we live in where the Chicago

elects an insane maniac to be President the truth is that the biggest game of

for a brace and/or a red card.” McClean has been in top form …
