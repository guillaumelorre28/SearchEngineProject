The jet carrying the Chapecoense team, along with club officials and 
journalists, to Medellín for the final against the Colombian side Atlético 
Nacional came down on Monday last week,killing 71 people

 including 19 players.

And the South American Football Confederation (Conmebol) has declared them 
Copa Sudamericana champions 2016.

The gesture comes after Nacional asked Conmebol to award the title to 
Chapecoense in tribute to the victims of the crash.

The governing body also announced it has awarded Nacional the Centennial 
Conmebol Fair Play award of $1m (£785,000).

It said in a statement: “For Conmebol there is no greater example of the 
‘spirit of peace, understanding and fair play’ set forth as an objective of our 
institution than the solidarity, consideration and respect shown by Atlético 
National towards its brothers from Chapecoense.”

Brazil’s leading football clubs have also pledged to loan players to 
Chapecoense for free and asked for them to be safeguarded from relegation from 
the top flight for the next three seasons.

The former Brazil forward Ronaldinho and ex-Argentina international Juan Roman 
Riquelme have reportedly offered to play for the club while anotherBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> old boy, Eidur Gudjohnsen, has 
offered his services.

“Out of respect I would play for ChapecoenseReal if they have a place for me! 
If not just to play with 10Ronaldinho again ForcaChape,” the 38-year-old 
Gudjohnsen, whose last club was FC Pune City, posted on Twitter.

Chapecoense’s acting president, Ivan Tozzo, has said the club – which came up 
through the lower divisions after being founded in 1973 – is determined to 
build again, but that can only be done with the support of the wider football 
community.

Just three of the team – defender Alan Luciano Ruschel, reserve goalkeeper 
Jackson Ragnar Follmann and centre-back Helio Hermito Zampier Neto – were named 
among only six survivors of the crash.

A minute’s silence will be held before all of this week’s Champions League and 
Europa League matches as a mark of respect to those who died.
