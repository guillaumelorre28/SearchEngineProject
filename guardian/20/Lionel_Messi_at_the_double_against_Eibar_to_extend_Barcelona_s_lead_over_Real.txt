Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> ensured they will 
be at least a point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga when they host 
their arch rivals in next weekend’s clásico after Lionel Messi struck twice in 
a comfortable win at Eibar on Saturday.

Barça leapfrogged stuttering Real, who host Levante on Sunday, into first 
place last weekend and produced another dominant performance inspired by Messi 
to move on to 65 points with 11 games left.

With Xavi and Andrés Iniesta on the bench, Messi captained the side and put 
the Catalan giants ahead in the 31st minute when he scored a penalty after 
Borja Ekiza handled the Argentinian’s shot.

Messi added a second effort 10 minutes into the second half when he nodded in 
an Ivan Rakitic corner, his 32ndLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> goal of the campaign and 
his 43rd in all competitions; two more than he managed in the whole of an 
injury-disrupted 2013-14.

To their credit, Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar>, playing 
in La Liga for the first time this season, refused to capitulate to their 
illustrious visitors and the forward Federico Piovaccari struck a shot against 
the crossbar late on.

“It was a very good, solid performance against a team that caused us a lot of 
problems,” Barça’s coach, Luis Enrique, said. “We will go into the game 
[against Real] as leaders and in perfect shape.”

Messi’s scintillating recent form bodes well for Wednesday’s Champions League 
last-16 return match at home to Manchester City, when Barça will defend a 2-1 
lead from last month’s first leg.
