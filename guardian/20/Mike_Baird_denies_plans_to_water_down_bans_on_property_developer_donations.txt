NSW premier Mike Baird <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/mike-baird> 
has denied any intention to water down bans on property developer donations.

The NSW government is reviewing the effectiveness of bans on donations from 
prohibited donors, including property developers and the alcohol, tobacco and 
gambling industries.

The government is intending to change electoral laws at least 12 months before 
the 2019 election, and confirmed it was reviewing theeffectiveness of the bans

Asked to rule out removing the ban, Baird said: “That’s my expectation, it 
will stay as it is,” he said. “Obviously we want to get to a position where 
there is as little influence as possible. That’s been my position all along.”

Baird said he did not expect the laws to be weakened. 

In June, the NSW joint standing committee on electoral matters recommended the 
government consider the effectiveness of prohibited donor provisions as part of 
a more comprehensive review of the Election Funding, Expenditure and 
Disclosures Act.

The committee’s recommendation followed the findings of an expert panel, led 
by former Sydney Water chief executive Kerry Schott, which said the donor bans 
should be kept in place, pending a highcourt challenge

 to their validity, and the introduction of caps on political donations for 
local government.

The high court challenge failed, and a bill capping political donations for 
local government was introduced in June.

The government’s formal response to the committee’s recommendation said: “The 
government will consider whether the policy objectives of the prohibited donor 
provisions are still valid in light of these developments.”
