I am feeling stupidly nostalgic this week, because it’s 10 years since I 
started writingmy Weekend column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes>, and 
next week will be my 500th in total. It began life asThe New Vegetarian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/thenewvegetarian>, and one 
ingredient that has been at the heart of so many of my favourite dishes, then 
and now, is the aubergine – in my bookPlenty 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/plenty.html>, my first collection of Guardian 
recipes, I even had one chapter called The Mighty Aubergine. (Looking back, I 
feel sorry for the other vegetables, whose chapters just took their name – 
Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Green Beans and so forth.) It seems fitting, then, that 
both this week’s and next week’s recipes are full of aubergines.

Over the years, I have grilled, roasted, burned, steamed, stuffed and fried 
them, and used them in everything fromcroquettes

; the aubergine’s ability to reassure and surprise me knows no end. This week’s 
recipes are a case in point. The paneer-stuffed aubergine reminds me of an 
early favourite dish in which I wrapped little balls of ricotta in long, thin 
strips of roast aubergine, but I am also amazed at how brilliantly the very 
savoury combination of aubergines and anchovies works when the vegetable is 
roasted. In fact, I’m now getting excited just thinking about where my 
aubergine adventures will take me next.

Paneer-stuffed aubergine in red lentil and coconut sauce

There are two types of paneer available: the slightly rubbery kind, which is 
great for making tikka kebabs, and the softer kind, which has a texture more 
like compressed ricotta. The latter is the one you want here; I found it at 
Sainsbury’s, but if you can’t get hold of it, the rubbery kind will do – just 
coarsely grate it first. Both the aubergine slices and lentil sauce can be 
prepared the day before if you want to get ahead. That way, you can just roll 
up the paneer and bake the dish on the day. Serves six.

3 large aubergines, stalks removed, cut lengthways into 0.5cm-thick slices 
100ml groundnut oil 
Salt and black pepper
6 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
5cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely diced
40 fresh curry leaves (about 4-5 stems) 
1 tsp black mustard seeds 
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
½ tsp ground turmeric
2 tsp medium curry powder 
2 tsp tomato paste
3 strips lime peel, plus the juice of 1 lime
100g red lentils
400ml coconut milk 
100g large (not baby) spinach leaves, stems removed 
220g paneer, broken into 2cm chunks
5g coriander, roughly chopped, to serve

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Lay out the aubergine slices on two 
large (30cm x 40cm) oven trays lined with baking paper. Brush with two 
tablespoons of oil and sprinkle with a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good 
grind of black pepper. Turn over the aubergine slices and repeat, then roast 
for 20 minutes, until cooked through and golden brown. Leave to cool.

Put two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once 
hot, add the shallots and fry for eight minutes, until golden brown. Add the 
ginger, chilli and half the curry leaves, cook for two minutes, then add the 
spices, tomato paste, strips of lime peel and lentils. Stir for a minute, then 
add the coconut milk, 600ml water and half a teaspoon of salt. Turn down the 
heat to medium and leave to simmer for 20 minutes, stirring once in a while, 
until the lentils are soft and the sauce is thick. Pour into a medium (20cm x 
30cm) baking dish and set aside.

Put one spinach leaf on top of each slice of aubergine. Put a piece or two of 
paneer in the middle, then roll up the aubergine, from the thinner end at the 
top down to the thicker bottom end, so the paneer is encased. Put the aubergine 
rolls seam-side down in the lentil sauce, and repeat with the remaining 
aubergine, spinach and paneer. You should end up with about 20 rolls, all sat 
snugly in the sauce. Press the rolls gently into the sauce, but not so far that 
they are submerged, then bake for 15-20 minutes, until the aubergine is golden 
brown on top and the sauce is bubbling. Remove from the oven and leave to rest 
for five minutes.

Heat the remaining two teaspoons of oil in a small pan on medium high flame. 
Add the remaining curry leaves and fry for a minute, until crisp and fragrant. 
Spoon over the aubergine rolls, drizzle over the lime juice and serve with 
coriander sprinkled on top.

Roast aubergine and tomato bake with rocket and walnut

A great side dish, or a lovely light lunch with some salad. Serves six.

40g walnut halves, lightly toasted and roughly chopped
40g rocket
25g basil leaves, plus a few extra, torn at the last minute, to garnish
40g parmesan, coarsely grated
About 100ml olive oil
Salt and black pepper
4 large aubergines, cut into 0.5cm-thick rounds
8 vine tomatoes, cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
1 large ball buffalo mozzarella, cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
100ml passata

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the walnuts, rocket, 15g basil 
leaves, parmesan, three tablespoons of oil, two tablespoons of water and a 
quarter-teaspoon of salt in the bowl of a food processor, and blitz to form a 
coarse pesto.

Spread out the aubergine slices on two or three baking trays lined with baking 
paper. Put 60ml olive oil in a small bowl and brush evenly over both sides of 
the aubergines. Sprinkle over half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of ground 
pepper, then roast for 25-30 minutes, until dark golden brown all over. Remove 
from the oven and spread the pesto evenly over each slice. Turn down the oven 
to 200C/390F/gas mark 6.

Arrange half the aubergine and pesto slices in a 20cm x 26cm baking dish, so 
they sit snugly in a single layer. Lay half the tomatoes on top, sprinkle with 
salt and a generous grind of pepper, then follow this with the slices of 
mozzarella and the remaining basil leaves. Lay the rest of the aubergine on 
top, then the remaining tomatoes. Pour over the passata, spreading it out with 
the back of a spoon, and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Bake for 45 
minutes, until the tomatoes on top have taken on a lot of colour, leave to rest 
for 10 minutes and serve sprinkled with basil.

Serves two to four.

4 medium aubergines, cut into 2cm-thick discs
Salt and black pepper
145ml olive oil
1½ tbsp oregano leaves
20g anchovy fillets, finely chopped
1 tbsp white-wine vinegar
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
5g parsley, roughly chopped

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. In a large bowl, mix the aubergine with 
half a teaspoon of salt. Transfer to two large oven trays lined with baking 
paper and brush with 70ml oil: you want to coat both sides of the aubergine 
discs. Bake for 35 minutes, until dark golden brown and cooked through, then 
remove and set aside to cool.

Heat 45ml oil in a very small saucepan or frying pan on a high flame. Test the 
oil is hot enough by dropping in an oregano leaf: if it sizzles, goes crisp 
straight away and turns a brighter shade of green, the oil is ready (if the oil 
is too hot, the oregano will go dark green). When the oil is at the right 
temperature, add a tablespoon of oregano leaves and cook for 10 seconds, just 
until crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate lined 
with kitchen paper to drain. Take the pan off the heat.

In a small bowl, whisk the anchovies, vinegar, garlic, an eighth of a teaspoon 
of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of pepper. Slowly pour in the remaining oil, 
whisking continuously, until well combined.

Finely chop the remaining oregano and put it in a large bowl with the 
aubergine and parsley. Pour over the anchovy dressing, gently toss, then 
transfer the salad to a platter. Sprinkle over the fried oregano and serve.
