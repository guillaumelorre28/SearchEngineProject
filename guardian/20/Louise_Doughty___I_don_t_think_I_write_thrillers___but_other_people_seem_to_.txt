Louise Doughty was born in the East Midlands in 1963. She took an MA in 
creative writing at the University of East Anglia and has written eight novels, 
including her latest, Black Water, which is published by Faber on 2 June.

Black Water is your eighth novel, and is set in Bali, a place you’d never been 
to until a few years ago. Why are your books always changing direction?
I’ve realised over the years that I’m just no good at thinking strategically 
as a novelist. I never think, oh this did really well, I’ll do it again. I’m 
much more likely to think, oh this did really well, let’s do something 
completely different now.

And it is very different from the two novels that preceded it, Whatever You 
Love

andApple Tree Yard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review>…
They were both female first-person narratives, with a lot in the present 
tense, so they were very immediate. They were also very much about women’s 
preoccupations at certain stages in life: soWhatever You Love, having children, 
Apple Tree Yard, being a middle-aged woman having knee tremblers in parliament. 
I think I just really needed to do something in a different tone of voice.

So, how did Black Water take shape?
I was at the Ubud literary festival on Bali in 2012, and I had terrible jet 
lag. And also I was probably drinking one too many cocktails at the festival 
parties. I was lying awake every night, and the night-time in rural Indonesia 
is very noisy – geckoes on the roof, monkeys, cicadas, insects, monsoon rain. 
So I was awake a lot, listening to the noises, and a really strong image came 
to me of a man lying awake at night in a hut in Indonesia, mortally afraid.

Why is he so afraid?
In the opening pages, he decides that men with machetes are going to come and 
kill him. But I didn’t actually know who he was, I didn’t know how old he was, 
I didn’t know why he was there. But what I did know about him was that what he 
was afraid of wasn’t what was going to happen; he was afraid of something that 
he himself had done.

The novel goes into the history of Indonesia, and in particular the massacres 
of communists and suspected communists in 1965. And your character, Harper, is 
deeply implicated, isn’t he?
Of course, he’s a metaphor for Indonesia itself. Because a military dictator 
came to power in 1965, there was never any truth and reconciliation, there was 
never any coming to terms with this massacre.

It’s still very difficult to talk about 1965. Nobody would say, for many 
years, if their father had been killed in ’65, because any family association 
with a communist, you would lose your job, it was dangerous. And also, in a lot 
of places, it was whole families that were killed.

I thought Apple Tree Yard was a feminist indictment of criminal justice

Your earliest novels, Crazy Paving and Dance With Me, got mixed in with 
“chicklit”. How did that feel?
Crazy Paving is about urban terrorism and chaos theory – but it had single 
women running around London as its heroines.Dance With Me was about mental 
illness and sexual betrayal and ghosts, but it had a single woman, who was 
promiscuous, as the main character. So there was this awful phase – and thank 
heavens it’s gone – where no young woman could write about what it was like to 
be a young woman in any style whatsoever without being lumped in that bracket.

Your novel Fires in the Dark was, again, very different.
I was always going to write that book. That was my Holocaust novel, and that 
was about a group of nomadic Kalderash Roma in central Europe in 1927; they go 
through the great depression, the rise of Nazism, the second world war – and 
then it ends with the Prague uprising, May 1945.

My family left central Europe in the mid-19th century, possibly earlier, so 
that wasn’t what had happened to our family, but it was what might have 
happened if we had stayed.

Apple Tree Yard really caught people’s imagination – and now it’s becoming a 
TV series, with Emily Watson in the lead

. Did you intend to write a thriller?
Well, the weird thing is, I don’t think I’m writing thrillers, but quite a lot 
of other people seem to. I thoughtApple Tree Yard was a feminist indictment of 
criminal justice, and an explanation of a middle-aged woman who [whispers] has 
sex.

So, the big question is – will the next book be yet another dramatic change?
I don’t know how to do it any other way. I’m just not capable of it. I can 
only write whatever idea grips my by the throat and holds me against the wall, 
and that’s what I’ve done so far, and that’s what I’ve got to keep doing. I 
don’t think I can write cynically.
