This summer’s transfer window promises to be one of the busiest yet with new 
managers already poised to take over atManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> and Chelsea and increased 
television prize money giving Premier League clubs more spending power than 
ever before.

But with the race already on to find the next Kingsley Coman or Dele Alli, 
which players in Europe under the age of 23 look destined to follow in their 
footsteps over the coming months?

The 18-year-old has broken through to devastating effect in his debut season 
as a professional, scoring 12 goals in Ligue 1 to propel Rennes into contention 
for European qualification for next season. That has made Dembélé themost 
sought-after 18-year-old in world football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/23/ousmane-dembele-football-hottest-property-rennes-bayern-munich-ligue-1>
, with Borussia Dortmund leading the race but Bayern Munich, Barcelona and most 
of the Premier League not far behind them. Despite his representative and the 
club denying rumours that a release clause of €5m is contained in his contract, 
Rennes are keen to cash in this summer on a player who has an outside chance of 
being called up by France coach Didier Deschamps for Euro 2016, but still 
harbour hopes of taking him back on loan next season. Given his remarkable 
rise, it is unlikely Dembélé will be there for long.

 Renato Sanches has been a driving force in Benfica’s midfield this season.

Tipped as the latest superstar to emerge from the stable of super-agent Jorge 
Mendes, it has been a whirlwind 12 months for the teenager who was born in 
Lisbon to parents from Cape Verde. Having made his league debut only at the end 
of October, Sanches was rewarded with a new contract containing a release 
clause of €45m a few weeks later to ward off any potential suitors. That didn’t 
stopManchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
reportedly making a failed move for him in January, with the scouts from Old 
Trafford thought to have watched on numerous occasions since. Representatives 
from Arsenal were also in the stands to see him play in Benfica’s Champions 
League quarter-final second leg against Bayern last week when the 18-year-old 
went toe to toe with Xabi Alonso and Arturo Vidal, although United are thought 
to be the frontrunners to sign him. Porto’s teenage midfielder Rúben Neves – 
who became the youngest ever Champions League captain in October – may be a 
less expensive target for English clubs.

Anyone who watched Liverpool’s remarkable comeback against Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> in the Europa League 
last week cannot fail to have been impressed with the performance of the 
visiting No33. Signed from 1860 Munich last summer for just €2.5m, Weigl is 
worth at least 10 times that now. The 20-year-old is a tall and elegant 
midfielder who has become the fulcrum of the Dortmund revival under Thomas 
Tuchel, capable of dictating play thanks to his impressive range of passing. 
Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and most recently Manchester City are the sides 
who have registered an interest in him, although Weigl has insisted he is not 
interested in leaving Dortmund just yet. That will make it difficult to lure 
him away this summer, especially given they will be desperate to hang on to 
striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as well.

The astonishing rearguard action which ended Barcelona’s hopes of consecutive 
Champions League titles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/13/atletico-madrid-barcelona-champions-league-match-report>
 was all the more remarkable given the absence of the 21-year-old from Uruguay. 
A hamstring injury ruled Giménez out of both legs against Barça but he should 
be back in time to face Bayern Munich in the semi-finals despite the 
performance of another promising young defender in his place, 20-year-old 
Frenchman Lucas Hernández. Now in his second full season at the Vicente 
Calderón, Giménez has formed a watertight partnership with compatriot Diego 
Godín in central defence that has conceded less than a goal every two matches 
in La Liga. Real Madrid and Manchester City are believed to be among those 
clubs who has expressed an interest in signing him, although a new contract 
signed in January with a €60m release clause will make things complicated.

When Marseille persuaded their prized asset to sign a new contract in January, 
they must have breathed a sigh of relief. Back then, the Belgium international 
was the subject of constant transfer speculation having already scored 11 times 
in Ligue 1 despite his club’s struggles. Fast forward three months and the 
22-year-old had to wait until the 71st minute to come off the bench as 
supporters at the Stade Vélodrome mocked their team byplaying the Benny Hill 
theme tune 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/11/marseille-fans-mock-players-benny-hill-theme-tune>
 during their 0-0 draw at home to Bordeaux. Despite scoring just three times in 
the intervening period before taking his season’s tally to 15 against Monaco at 
the weekend, Batshuayi’s likely appearance in the Belgium squad at Euro 2016 and
Marseille being put up for sale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/marseille-for-sale-margarita-louis-dreyfus>
 last week by chairwoman Margarita Louis-Dreyfus should hasten his departure 
this summer, along with his highly-rated team-mate Georges-Kévin N’Koudou.

Dahoud was only 10 months old when his family fled the largely Kurdish town of 
Amuda on Syria’s northern border with Turkey. Less than 20 years later and 
having escaped President Bashar al-Assad’s regime for a new life in Germany, 
the Gladbach midfielder is a contender for a place in Joachim Löw’s squad for 
Euro 2016 despite only making his Bundesliga debut in October. Liverpool and 
Borussia Dortmund have alreadyindicated their determination 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/11/liverpool-dortmund-mahmoud-dahoud-bundesliga-borussia-monchengladbach>
 to sign Dahoud this summer on the back of some impressive performances 
alongside Arsenal target Granit Xhaka in the engine room and it seems unlikely 
Gladbach will be able to hold on to him should offers of around €30m be 
forthcoming. “It’s getting turbulent,” said the club’s director of sport, Max 
Eberl, last week when asked if any bids had been received. Expect more clubs to 
enter the fray once the race for his signature gets serious.

A few months ago, Sané could do no wrong. Having scored on his Champions 
League debut last season against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu, four Bundesliga 
goals for Schalke before the end of October brought the son of former German 
rhythmic gymnast champion Regina Weber and former Senegalese international 
Souleyman Sanéto the attention of the powers that be at Barcelona and 
Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/31/manchester-city-schalke-leroy-sane>
. A pricetag of £40m was immediately placed on his head before the forward made 
his senior Germany debut against France in November. Since then, though, it’s 
not been such plain sailing as Schalke have struggled, with the equaliser 
against Borussia Dortmund last week his first goal since the end of January. “I 
make no secret of this. Some time in the future I want to play abroad and at an 
even bigger club than Schalke,” Sané said last week. The club insist that will 
not happen this summer yet it will be hard for them to hold on to their prized 
asset if they fail to qualify for the Champions League.

When Gabriel left to join Arsenal last January, Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> supporters may have feared 
the worst. But the purchase of Ivory Coast defender Bailly from Espanyol for 
just €5.7m has proved a more than adequate replacement as the Yellow Submarine 
have mounted an unlikely push for Champions League qualification this season. A 
regular alongside another Espanyol old boy, Víctor Ruiz, at the heart of their 
defence, Bailly – who moved to Spain at the age of 17 after being spotted at a 
youth tournament in Burkina Faso – has impressed with his speed and power. The 
22-year-old is thought to be on the wishlist of the incoming Manchester City 
manager Pep Guardiola but he could face competition in a market where top-class 
defenders are hard to find.

Anyone planning to head to Paris on Eurostar this weekend for a little 
springtime break may end up disappointed. France’s Coupe de la Ligue final 
between Paris Saint-Germain and Lille takes place at the Stade de France on 
Saturday night and, if you believe his representatives, half of the Premier 
League’s clubs will be there to watch Morocco international Boufal. Linked with 
Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenhamin January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/06/lille-soufiane-boufal-arsenal-manchester-united-tottenham>
, the 22-year-old’s breakout season has gone from strength to strength since 
then, with a hat-tick against Ajaccio last week taking his tally of goals to 
11, plus five assists. Lille’s coach, Frédéric Antonetti, has already indicated 
he will be sold in the summer, with a pricetag of around £15m mooted. Boufal’s 
decision to pledge his international future to Morocco was perhaps wise given 
the abundance of emerging talent available to France coach Didier Deschamps at 
the moment, although, like Paris-born Riyad Mahrez, the skilful playmaker could 
make them regret missing out on him in the future.

In a season that has gone from bad to worse for the seven-times European Cup 
winners, the emergence of the teenage goalkeeper from Castellammare di Stabia 
on the Amalfi Coast has been one of the few bright spots. Already 6ft 5in, 
Donnarumma is rated so highly at San Siro that he became the club’s first 
choice at the end of October aged just 16, displacing formerReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> goalkeeper Diego López. That 
prompted his agent, Mino Raiola, to declare that he would not be sold for less 
than €150m, while Silvio Berlusconi has promised supporters he will follow club 
legend Paolo Maldini and be at Milan for the next 20 years. That may not stop 
Manchester United and Chelsea from trying to sign him, however, with the former 
reportedly having already offered £30m as a potential long-term replacement for 
David de Gea.
