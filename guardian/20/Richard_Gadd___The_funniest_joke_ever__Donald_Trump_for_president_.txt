The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 

I have to go with Spencer Jones as his alter-ego the Herbert, an oddball 
prop-comic who takes household items and turns them into characters in his 
little world. It is seriously clever stuff.

The funniest book I’ve ever read

Patrick deWitt’s The Sisters Brothers, which is a black comedy about two 
hitmen. It has such a dry, discernible wit in among the guns and violence.

The funniest dream I’ve ever had

I was in the audience watching myself totally smashing it on stage. It’s a 
shame I was only doing material by other comics.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen

Laurel and Hardy’s The Music Box influenced me so much as a child. It is 
essentially the story of two bumbling idiots trying to get a piano up a very 
steep staircase. You could never get comedy so pure today; there would have to 
be some sort of narrative about how Laurel’s drug problems had led him to store 
400 kilos of crack inside the piano.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 

I saw someone walking around Camden Town in cowboy boots and thought they 
looked pretty cool, so I decided to buy a pair. In retrospect, the reason the 
bloke pulled them off so well is because he had the full cowboy attire on; they 
didn’t quite work so well with a North Face jacket and chinos.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had 

I seem to have a bowlcut in every photo from my childhood. This one time I 
dyed it red as well; at the time, I probably thought I was turning heads 
wherever I went like Richard Gere in An Officer And A Gentleman. I mean, I was 
turning heads – mainly for the fact that I resembled a magic mushroom.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard 

Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. It doesn’t make me 
laugh quite like it used to…
