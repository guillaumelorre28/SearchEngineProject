2012 started unhappily on the crossword front, at least for those of you who 
buy the paper to do the daily Cryptic, rather than do it online. The torrent of 
complaints (it has to be said mostly more in anger than in sorrow) about the 
way in which the January redesign of the paper resulted in the Cryptic puzzle 
being printed across the centre of the inside back page, so that it could not 
be folded conveniently for solving on a bus, train, or other confined space, or 
outdoors, led to a quick rethink and the puzzle's original positioning below 
the fold was duly restored.
It also started badly on the Guardian crossword front for the Labour leader, 
Ed Miliband. On the very day that he was to re-launch his allegedly stalled 
leadership of Her Majesty's Opposition Gordius undermined him. His puzzle No 
25,528 (10 January) had a clue (8 down) "Miliband upset in cut vacillation 
(10)" for INDECISION [ED (reversed) in INCISION]. It must have put Miliband off 
his stride, because he arrived late to deliver the great speech at the Oxo 
Tower on London's South Bank.

I have always believed that solving crosswords should be as much about 
bringing people together as about competing against each other, or against the 
clock. So my heart was warmed by the following information out of the blue from 
Charles Dodgson, an expatriate now living in the United Sates. He belongs to a 
small group of volunteers experimenting with ways in which the resources of the 
internet can be used to improve the quality of life of retired persons, who may 
for whatever reason be leading solitary lives and whose computer literacy may 
be limited.
The group has about a dozen regular members, spread between California, New 
York and Maryland, who meet regularly via Skype for a programme of 
participatory events. He tells me that their current favourite is doing the
Guardian Quick crossword <http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/series/quick> 
together, though two of the group are blind and they are all crossword novices. 
The procedure is simple: they choose a particular crossword and circulate its 
URL web identification number. They then set up a Skype telephone conference 
call and bring up the chosen crossword from the Guardian website on their 
computers. One person acts as the "puzzle master", inviting participants to 
choose and read out a clue, which they then discuss and solve collectively. He 
says that, though each is sitting alone and they are all miles apart, they get 
a real feeling that they are together with a group of congenial friends taking 
part in a pleasurable joint activity. He reports that the public library in the 
New York borough of Queens has adopted the idea and will shortly start its own 
such event. Let us hope that solving theGuardian Quick crossword 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/series/quick> soon becomes a cult among 
New York's senior citizens, though some spellings and the more arcane points of 
British geography may cause hiccups.

In case you have missed the publicity the Guardian is to hold a huge Open 
Weekend <http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend> event at its London offices 
near Kings Cross in London on Saturday and Sunday 24 and 25 March. The whole 
programme for the two days is to be found atwww.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend> but you may like particularly to know 
that two of your favourite crossword setters will be there on the Saturday to 
talk and answer questions: Paul (John Halpern) at 12.30pm and Araucaria (John 
Graham) at 1.45pm (details at
www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend/the-art-of-crosswords 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend/the-art-of-crosswords> and 
www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend/araucaria 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-weekend/araucaria> respectively)

There were only two correct entries on the first morning for the January 
Genius puzzle (No 103 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/crossword/java/new/0,,-27692,00.html> set by 
Lavatch): Tony from London W5 at 01:01 and Peter from Montville, Queensland at 
03:57. And only 10 in total for the whole of the first day. Perhaps the fact 
that it was the day after New Year's Day had something to do with it. But the 
numbers built up over the month, with 221 correct entries arriving by the 
deadline.

Congratulations to Nigel Parish from Surrey, who is January's winner.
