Full-time: Atletico 1-0 Deportivo

Well, they weren’t at their best but this was deserved – Atletico created 
plenty of chances, especially in the second half against 10 men, and the 
breakthrough had to come at some point. Griezmann provided it against a tough, 
resilient Depor side that really made them work for the win. But they’ve 
cleared a banana skin here, and gained two points on Real! Thanks a lot for 
reading and enjoy the rest of your day.

90+1 min: Late chance for Depor! My word. Emre gets onto a cross that isn’t 
cleared very well, thunders an 18-yard shot towards goal ... and I think that’s 
beating Oblak before Godin, standing in front of goal, gets his head onto it! 
I’m not sure he knew much about that.

89 min: Griezmann releases Gaitan, who can’t do likewise for Gameiro quickly 
enough. Should have got rid of the ball far sooner – Gameiro would have been 
clear. A moment later, Griezmann does find Gameiro, who cuts inside and has a 
shot superbly blocked by Arribas.

87 min: Atletico possession, and plenty of it, but not much in the way of 
penetration. They just need to see this out sensibly.

85 min: Babel makes his mark, leaving a late foot in on Lucas and deservedly 
seeing the yellow card. Simeone looks very upset – can’t afford to lose another 
to injury, and fortunately Lucas has recovered.

82 min: Corner to Atleti after some good work from Correa. Taken quickly but 
there’s no appetite to get it into the box straightaway. Atletico play the ball 
about patiently and then, when it does reach the area, Filipe Luis is offside.

As long as they don’t do anything really daft now, they might want to keep

Goal! Atletico 1-0 Deportivo (Griezmann 70)

Had to happen, and had to be him. Gameiro does well, taking a cute Juanfran 
pass down by the right byline, zipping the ball across sharply and setting up 
Griezmann, who jabs home from in front of goal and that is surely now that.

not missed a beat at the back for the away side.

66 min: Depor facing a barrage of crosses, switched angles, dinks and lofts at 
the moment – and somehow getting there heads or limbs on everything. Can this 
really last though? It’s desperate stuff now.

63 min: Correa wriggles into the box in the inside-right, and his low cross is 
cut out. Atleti win a corner and Simeone gees up the crowd with windmill 
motions. The flag kick is worked down the left and it’s chipped into the middle 
where nobody can quite head it home.

58 min: It’s mainly Atletico though and Lux saves well again ... twice! First 
from an angle as Carrasco gets free and then, moments later, he flings himself 
to his left to deny, I think, Gabi. Then Filipe Luis, his first touch 
manufacturing a clear sight of goal, drag wide! So many chances.

56 min: Depor exert some mild pressure, with a free-kick that wins a throw by 
the corner flag. Colak is booked for, I think, making to take it and then 
timewasting. They work it nicely down the right though, and the ball’s crossed 
in and nodded back ... and it’s Lucas who has to make a last-ditch intervention 
to prevent a surprise Depor opener!

53 min: Woodwork! That’s very, very close from Carrasco, who runs the ball 
across the edge of the box from left to right, thuds one inside the near post 
... and in fact it’s an absolutely marvellous save from Lux, who somehow gets a 
finger to the ball and tips it onto the bar! This is becoming a siege.

52 min: And Juanfran, again, has a baffling amount of room after a superb ball 
by – I think – Gabi but he skies his attempted volley across goal.

52 min: Juanfran has a surprising amount of room to turn and cross inside the 
box but it’s a bit high to give Griezmann much chance. He loops his header in 
the vague direction of goal nonetheless, but Lux grabs it.

47 min: Atletico nearly sort it out nice and early, Juanfran drilling in a 
shot that Lux cannot hold and Griezmann, who snaffles up the rebound, is 
correctly given offside.

Peeeeep! Second half underway

It is, needlessly, 11 v 10 – so how long can Depor hold out? They kept Depor 
waiting for a couple of minutes before coming out. I’m sure that was accidental.

Half-time: Atletico 0-0 Deportivo

Well, a perfect away performance from Depor until they started to get carried 
away in the last few minutes. A couple of rushes of blood later and off went 
Fajr. A generally insipid Atletico, who should have scored through Griezmann 
but haven’t created loads more, now face 10 men for the second period, although 
they’ve lost two of their own to injury. Be right back.

Red card! Fajr (Deportivo, 45+1)

Now that’s a gamechanger and that’s really stupid. Fajr barges Gaitan, it’s a 
second booking, and what was all going so well for the visitors now becomes an 
uphill battle for the second half.

45 min: But, ooooh, that’s naughty from Andone and Atletico are irate. He goes 
up for a header with Lucas, but doesn’t actually go for the header at all. On 
the replay it’s clear that he’s looking purely at the man, not the ball. How on 
earth was he not booked for that?

41 min: Not bad from Depor there, with Fajr swinging in a right-sided cross 
that Borja, running in from the left, jumps and only just misses. Then Atletico 
counter and Gaitan threads in Carrasco down the middle, but the ball is cleared 
for a corner that is wildly overhit.

40 min: Godin storms forward in open play and hopes to get on the end of a 
Gaitan raid, but the first defender clears. He does make it onto a second 
delivery, and is wrongly given offside, but the header wasn’t causing Lux any 
trouble anyway.

Well, they weren’t at their best but this was deserved – Atletico created 
plenty of chances, especially in the second half against 10 men, and the 
breakthrough had to come at some point. Griezmann provided it against a tough, 
resilient Depor side that really made them work for the win. But they’ve 
cleared a banana skin here, and gained two points on Real! Thanks a lot for 
reading and enjoy the rest of your day.
 
90+1 min: Late chance for Depor! My word. Emre gets onto a cross that isn’t 
cleared very well, thunders an 18-yard shot towards goal ... and I think that’s 
beating Oblak before Godin, standing in front of goal, gets his head onto it! 
I’m not sure he knew much about that.
 
89 min: Griezmann releases Gaitan, who can’t do likewise for Gameiro quickly 
enough. Should have got rid of the ball far sooner – Gameiro would have been 
clear. A moment later, Griezmann does find Gameiro, who cuts inside and has a 
shot superbly blocked by Arribas.
 
87 min: Atletico possession, and plenty of it, but not much in the way of 
penetration. They just need to see this out sensibly.
 
85 min: Babel makes his mark, leaving a late foot in on Lucas and deservedly 
seeing the yellow card. Simeone looks very upset – can’t afford to lose another 
to injury, and fortunately Lucas has recovered.
 
83 min: Depor have a shot. It’s a long-range sighter from Borja, but it’s well 
wide.
 
82 min: Corner to Atleti after some good work from Correa. Taken quickly but 
there’s no appetite to get it into the box straightaway. Atletico play the ball 
about patiently and then, when it does reach the area, Filipe Luis is offside.
 
80 min: Colak’s delivery is wasteful and cleared at the near post. They 
haven’t had, and won’t have, many of those.
 
80 min: Dangerous free-kick for Depor on the left now, as Luisinho outfoxes 
Gabi and draws the foul...
 
78 min: Not a lot happening at the moment. A bit of a fizz has left Atletico. 
As long as they don’t do anything really daft now, they might want to keep 
something in hand for Bayern.
 
75 min: But hello. The visitors have an ace up their sleeve and it’s one Ryan 
Babel. He replaces Navarro....
 
73 min: Will Atletico go for more now? Now that the elastic has snapped on 
Depor’s resistance, you’d think there might be more up for grabs if they want 
them.
 
Had to happen, and had to be him. Gameiro does well, taking a cute Juanfran 
pass down by the right byline, zipping the ball across sharply and setting up 
Griezmann, who jabs home from in front of goal and that is surely now that.
 
68 min: Defensive midfielder Mosquera replaces Guilherme now for Depor, who 
need all the fresh legs they can get.
 
67 min: All this said, my man of the match currently would be Albentosa – has 
not missed a beat at the back for the away side.
 
66 min: Depor facing a barrage of crosses, switched angles, dinks and lofts at 
the moment – and somehow getting there heads or limbs on everything. Can this 
really last though? It’s desperate stuff now.
 
63 min: Correa wriggles into the box in the inside-right, and his low cross is 
cut out. Atleti win a corner and Simeone gees up the crowd with windmill 
motions. The flag kick is worked down the left and it’s chipped into the middle 
where nobody can quite head it home.
 
62 min: This is very much going to be attack vs defence now. Even more than it 
was already.
 
61 min: A Depor change now. The bustling striker Andone has got through a lot 
of work and Luisinho, a left-back (!) replaces him.
 
59 min: Carrasco, who’d really livened up, is surprisingly replaced by Kevin 
Gameiro.
 
58 min: It’s mainly Atletico though and Lux saves well again ... twice! First 
from an angle as Carrasco gets free and then, moments later, he flings himself 
to his left to deny, I think, Gabi. Then Filipe Luis, his first touch 
manufacturing a clear sight of goal, drag wide! So many chances.
 
56 min: Depor exert some mild pressure, with a free-kick that wins a throw by 
the corner flag. Colak is booked for, I think, making to take it and then 
timewasting. They work it nicely down the right though, and the ball’s crossed 
in and nodded back ... and it’s Lucas who has to make a last-ditch intervention 
to prevent a surprise Depor opener!
 
53 min: Woodwork! That’s very, very close from Carrasco, who runs the ball 
across the edge of the box from left to right, thuds one inside the near post 
... and in fact it’s an absolutely marvellous save from Lux, who somehow gets a 
finger to the ball and tips it onto the bar! This is becoming a siege.
 
52 min: And Juanfran, again, has a baffling amount of room after a superb ball 
by – I think – Gabi but he skies his attempted volley across goal.
 
52 min: Juanfran has a surprising amount of room to turn and cross inside the 
box but it’s a bit high to give Griezmann much chance. He loops his header in 
the vague direction of goal nonetheless, but Lux grabs it.
 
50 min: Gaitan gets an early shot away at the other end but drags wide. 
Fernando Torres is warming up...
 
49 min: Dangerous moment from Deportivo as Albentosa retrieves a half-cleared 
free kick and crosses really well from the right, but Lucas heads away with two 
men lurking.
 
47 min: Atletico nearly sort it out nice and early, Juanfran drilling in a 
shot that Lux cannot hold and Griezmann, who snaffles up the rebound, is 
correctly given offside.
 
It is, needlessly, 11 v 10 – so how long can Depor hold out? They kept Depor 
waiting for a couple of minutes before coming out. I’m sure that was accidental.
 
Well, a perfect away performance from Depor until they started to get carried 
away in the last few minutes. A couple of rushes of blood later and off went 
Fajr. A generally insipid Atletico, who should have scored through Griezmann 
but haven’t created loads more, now face 10 men for the second period, although 
they’ve lost two of their own to injury. Be right back.
 
Now that’s a gamechanger and that’s really stupid. Fajr barges Gaitan, it’s a 
second booking, and what was all going so well for the visitors now becomes an 
uphill battle for the second half.
 
45 min: But, ooooh, that’s naughty from Andone and Atletico are irate. He goes 
up for a header with Lucas, but doesn’t actually go for the header at all. On 
the replay it’s clear that he’s looking purely at the man, not the ball. How on 
earth was he not booked for that?
 
44 min: All very midfieldy in this last couple of minutes. Atletico, so far, 
will be delighted with this. It’s very easy to see how they’ve drawn their 
other two away games 0-0.
 
43 min: Yellow card now for the new boy Hernandez, whose first action is to 
clean out Borja, who was on the charge midway inside the home half.
 
41 min: Not bad from Depor there, with Fajr swinging in a right-sided cross 
that Borja, running in from the left, jumps and only just misses. Then Atletico 
counter and Gaitan threads in Carrasco down the middle, but the ball is cleared 
for a corner that is wildly overhit.
 
40 min: Godin storms forward in open play and hopes to get on the end of a 
Gaitan raid, but the first defender clears. He does make it onto a second 
delivery, and is wrongly given offside, but the header wasn’t causing Lux any 
trouble anyway.
 
39 min: Koke is flattened by Faycal Fajr deep inside his own half. Yellow 
card; his studs were showing. No hat-trick of injuries here, thank goodness.
 
38 min: Griezmann gets his head onto a Luis cross, and so does Arribas. Goal 
kick, much to the crowd’s annoyance.
 
36 min: So 20-year-old defender Lucas Hernandez enters the fray. Not been a 
good half for Atletico so far, in sum.
