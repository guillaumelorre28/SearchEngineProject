 Professor Steven Pinker, who has lectured recently at the Royal Institution.

There are about 70 of these lectures a year at Albemarle Street. I went there 
the other night to introduceSteven Pinker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/23/on-my-radar-steven-pinker-psychologist-author>
 onthe Sense of Style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/03/the-sense-of-style-the-thinking-persons-guide-to-writing-in-the-21st-century-steven-pinker-review>
: it was brilliant and it was packed. This lecture theatre isa beautiful 
amphitheatre <http://venue.rigb.org/rooms/first-floor/faraday-theatre/gallery>, 
perhaps the most handsome and loveliest in London. It’s whereHumphry 
<http://www.rigb.org/our-history/humphry-davy> Davy and Michael Faraday 
<http://www.rigb.org/our-history/michael-faraday> showed off some of the 
greatest experiments of 19th-century science – the people who went to watch 
talks there included Dickens and Darwin and HG Wells. There are quite a few 
lectures coming up: Richard Dawkins, one on nanotechnology, John Gribbin on the 
theory of everything. It’s the most amazing thing, and hardly anyone knows 
about it, apart from theChristmas lectures

 Festival-goers enjoy Edinburgh’s Charlotte Square gardens. 
We all rather envy the Victorian literary and philosophical societies; it was 
a time of great autodidacts,Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomashardy> perhaps the greatest of them 
all. And that has been almost replaced by literary festivals, and universities, 
of course. No other country in the world has anything like the density and 
range of literary festivals in the British Isles: there must be approaching 400 
now. When I first went to the Edinburgh festival in the 60s, about 4,000 people 
turned up; now there’s something like 220,000. There are European poets, 
American writers, people from South America. The tents are full hour after hour 
after hour, from nine in the morning until 10 at night. It’s a quiet, 
self-educational process that shows no signs of diminishing.

Ballet. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian 
This was at Sadler’s Wells but is now going to Milton Keynes and Manchester. 
There are 23 nationalities dancing in the English National Ballet, which is 
extraordinary. If you wanted to prove London was a global city, and that arts 
were now a global experience, you have it in the English (I like the lovely 
irony there) National Ballet. And these Spanish and Indian dancers were 
depicting English soldiers in the Great War, lest we forget. It was a wonderful 
evening. NowTamara Rojo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/17/the-tamara-rojo-revolution-english-national-ballet>
 is director, she has turned that company round. It still does the bread and 
butter, like Swan Lake, but also brings in modern choreographers.

Celts exhibition. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images 
This is the first time any exhibition has tried to tell the story of the Celts 
from 500BC to the present day. The objects that they’re showing are almost 
beyond description. There are beautiful torcs in gold, armour, brooches that 
could be paraded up and down New Bond Street these days, chariots, crowns. They 
are almost unparalleled in their craftsmanship – anyone doing that today would 
be quite rightly acclaimed. There’s one sword that has 23 different metals in 
it: it’s a horrible-looking sword, but the stuff that has gone into it… what we 
realise is how European Europe was for so long: the materials they use come 
from all over the continent and the trade in rare materials was going on all 
the time.

This is a play about an actor – a friend and rival of David Garrick, part of 
Dr Johnson’s circle – who lost a leg and went on performing in his theatre. He 
was also a rogue and a reprobate, pursued by the press. (It’s intercut with 
discussions about the science of music and the effects of electricity on the 
brain.) Curiously, the music theme goes together withFarinelli and the King 
<http://www.atgtickets.com/shows/farinelli-and-the-king/duke-of-yorks/>, 
starring Mark Rylance, which deals with the healing power of music. Farinelli, 
the great eunuch tenor, had to sing at the court of the ailing Philip V every 
night from midnight till five in the morning. His singing alleviated the king’s 
depression for years.

 The trailing hounds of Cumbria strut their stuff round Grasmere. Photograph: 
Hound Trailing Association 
I was born and bred in the Lake District. Going there for walks is wonderful, 
but there’s a deeper, almost immemorial Lake District, made up of shepherds and 
hill farmers and sheepdog trials. There’s a thing called hound trailing: hounds 
bred for speed from foxhounds, which run these 10-mile circuits around the 
hills following an aniseed trail. It’s wonderful. If this were somewhere in 
Brittany or Provence, people would flock to see it, but here it’s just the 
local people who do it. It’s a great co-operative effort: all the farmers in a 
huge area have to agree the dogs will go over a certain area and move their 
sheep away from the fields; the timings are very precise, rules are stiff. It’s 
amazing it’s still going on.
