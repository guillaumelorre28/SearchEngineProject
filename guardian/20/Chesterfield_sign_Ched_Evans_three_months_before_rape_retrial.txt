Former Wales and Sheffield United striker Ched Evans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ched-evans> has signed to play for 
Chesterfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chesterfield>, three months 
before he faces a retrial for rape.

Evans said he was “very excited and privileged to be resuming my career” at 
the League One side, who have signed him on a one-year contract from 1 July.

In 2012, the 27-year-old was convicted of the 2011 rape of a 19-year-old woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/20/ched-evans-found-guilty-rape> 
and sentenced to five years in prison. He served half his term before being 
released in October 2014.

Evans has always insisted he is innocent and succeeded in having his 
conviction quashed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/ched-evans-wins-appeal-against-conviction>
 at the court of appeal earlier this year. The court has ordered a retrial, due 
to begin on 4 October. Evans pleaded not guilty at Cardiff crown court earlier 
this month.

Chesterfield’s current manager, Danny Wilson, was previously manager at 
Sheffield United, where Evans was a £20,000-a-week star before his conviction. 
The club released him from his contract at the end of the 2011-12 season.

Reports suggest his salary at Chesterfield will be a more modest £2,000 a 
week, for which, the player said in a statement released by the club, “I hope 
to make a valuable contribution both on and off the pitch for the football 
club, the fans and the community.”

Chesterfield’s chairman, Dave Allen, said the club was “delighted to have 
secured the services of an outstanding footballer, who is now keen to get back 
to work and score goals”.

Allen said that both Wilson and Chris Morgan – the first team coach, who also 
came from Sheffield United – “speak highly of him [Evans] from their time 
together at Bramall Lane”.

“Chesterfield Football Club have given a great deal of thought to this signing 
and, following the court’s decision, we are in no doubt that Ched Evans should 
be welcomed back into his profession as a professional footballer,” Allen added.


Evans, who has 13 international caps for Wales, had hoped to resume his 
professional career after his release from prison, but despite being linked 
with a number of clubs he was unable to secure a contract while his conviction 
stood.

Oldham Athletic pulled the plug

 on a possible deal in 2015 after coming under pressure from their sponsors, 
while an offer from Sheffield United to use their facilities to trainwas also 
rescinded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/20/ched-evans-training-offer-withdrawn-sheffield-united>
 following a backlash from fans and patrons.

Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill had said that she wanted her name removed 
from a stand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/13/jessica-ennis-hill-name-stand-ched-evans-contract-sheffield-united>
 at Sheffield United’s ground if Evans was re-signed.

The player’s conviction was overturned after fresh evidence emerged, details 
of which cannot be reported for legal reasons. After hearing the evidence,three 
appeal court judges concluded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/ched-evans-wins-appeal-against-conviction>
 “that we must allow the appeal and that it is in the interests of justice to 
order a retrial”.

Chesterfield’s statement makes clear it considers there to be no impediment to 
Evans resuming his career after the quashing of his conviction.

“There will be no further comments or statements relating to this matter and 
Chesterfield Football Club respectfully requests that the media allow Ched and 
his team-mates to concentrate on a very busy pre-season schedule,” the clubsaid 
in a statement
