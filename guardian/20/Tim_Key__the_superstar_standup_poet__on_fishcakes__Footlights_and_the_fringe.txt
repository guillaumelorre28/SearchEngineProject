No sooner have I arrived at Tim Key’s house than he’s gone. The actor, 
comedian and poet has to pop out to get milk and Jaffa Cakes, leaving me alone 
amid all his clutter. There’s a backscratcher on his kitchen counter, tangled 
up with headphones; a discarded script, partially burnt, on a windowsill; and a 
gym hula-hoop hanging in his office, among Post-its scrawled with words like 
“fusspot”, “barbara” and “35 friends babysitting”. Then there’s theAthena 
Tennis Girl <http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-KBzdu8bL._SY300_.jpg> 
poster in his living room, and the reindeer rug splayed across his bedroom 
floor. Most evocative, however, is the bathtub full of untouched water. The 
sign of a busy man. Or one who needs a wash.

Ten minutes later, he returns, and we sit on the balcony of his north London 
home, where he lives alone. Key explains that he was up till 3am, after 
previewing the show – Work in Slutgress – he is taking to Edinburgh. He spent 
the early hours eating fishcakes and watchingTaskmaster 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/28/dave-game-show-taskmaster>
, the new panel show on Dave in which Key, Frank Skinner, Roisin Conaty, Romesh 
Ranganathan and Josh Widdicombe perform such tasks as drawing a horse while 
riding one. “It was a lot of fun,” he says.

Key’s solo shows feel more like theatre than comedy these days, often 
featuring oddly evocative installations: 2009’sMasterslut

around a bath; 2014’sSingle White Slut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/14/tim-key-single-white-slut-review-standup>
 was delivered in front of a Tracey Emin-esque bed. It is amateur poetry 
reading gone awry: his brief verses range from the whimsical to the sinister, 
narrating stories about golfers, Gary Glitter, and adultery at its most askew. 
His passive aggression and occasional perviness are not the kind of thing panel 
shows are generally looking for – but, even so, the 38-year-old boasts a Bafta 
nomination and an Edinburgh Comedy award, while his creations include the 
sketch show Cowards andTim Key’s Late Night Poetry Programme

. How did he get here? The answer is as unconventional as his comedy.

In 2001, after graduating from Sheffield University with a degree in Russian, 
Key – bereft of a plan and living with his parents near Cambridge – decided to 
audition for a production of Treasure Island. Since the show was being put on 
by Footlights, Cambridge University’s notorious drama society, he pretended he 
was a student there, doing a PhD on the complete works of theRussian writer 
Nikolai Gogol 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/aug/18/nikolai-gogol-fiction>
.

He nearly came unstuck several times. “Once,” he says, “someone who had just 
got cast in Gogol’sThe Government Inspector 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/stage/2011/jun/10/government-inspector-review> 
came up to me in a bar and said, ‘You know about Gogol, don’t you? I wonder if 
I could ask you a couple of questions.’ And I said, ‘I’m not really an 
authority on his plays. My area is more his short stories.’ And I scuttled off 
very quickly.”

Eventually he came clean and was still allowed into Footlights. However, his 
poetic style was yet to emerge and Key ended up doing conventional standup. “It 
was incredibly unimaginative and un-innovative. It was observations. I talked 
about tuna, I talked about David Beckham. I did 10 gigs and I’d say about seven 
were maybe fine.”

Then one day, while sitting on the tube without a book or newspaper, Key 
opened a notepad and the following words spilled out: “The man walked / Or 
wandered (I should say) / up the hill / he met someone he vaguely knew / They 
curtseyed.”Tim Key <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tim-key> the poet was 
born.

In one of the (seven) introductions to The Incomplete Tim Key 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_3wbYy3LDw>, his new collection of poems 
(with often lengthy footnotes), the author jokingly professes his disdain for 
people questioning his poetry credentials: “I doubt the other great poets ever 
had to put up with that kind of bullshit question,” he writes. Does he ever 
want to be taken seriously? “I don’t want to be studied! If I write a poem and 
smile, that’s enough. It gives me the confidence to think other people might as 
well.”

How does the poetry community feel about him? Do they feel he sullies their 
art? “Poets love me,” he smiles. “They embrace me. Actually, I don’t really 
know many poets. But I used to go to a lot of poetry gigs and they were 
remarkably tolerant of me.”

Tim Key’s Late Night Poetry Programme review: ‘The atmosphere he creates is 
spellbinding’

Aside from his abilities as an actor and writer, there is little surprise why 
the likes ofSteve Coogan <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/coogan>, who cast 
him as Sidekick Simon inAlpha Papa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/08/alpha-papa-review>, would want 
Key around. He is quick and mischievous, rarely earnest, though a touch 
absent-minded. At one point, he gives me his laptop to look over some poems, 
unaware he has handed over a Word document listing his entire login details. By 
contrast, in quite a British boyish way, he’s a closed book when it comes to 
emotions.

What I do discover is that he was never the class clown and that his mum 
disapproves of his swearing, but is “fine” with his regular references to 
sluttiness. Also, he remains overwhelmed by Coogan, despite working with him 
for years. “It’s like you’re being pulled into your telly,” he says, “and 
you’re sitting there with actual Alan Partridge. I don’t think it will ever 
stop being weird.”

Significantly more prosaic is Key’s daily routine: “Get up. Bath. Scrambled 
eggs. Or poached if I’m feeling confident. Into the study. Stare at desk. Back 
out. Biscuits. Coffee. Back in. Nothing. Cafe. More coffee. Notepad. Scribbling 
ideas. Lunch. Potentially fish. Another go at writing. Doom descending. Try and 
stay focused until seven. Write down some aims for tomorrow. Leave desk. Cry.”

His 11th stint at Edinburgh kicks off on 15 August. The sense of expectancy, 
rising each year, must get to him. “Yes it does. In 2011, I was on the front of 
some magazine. The List, I think. Which meant I was on those billboard things 
outside newsagents. First night was a disaster. Walked back through Edinburgh 
past approximately five of my faces. Those moments are tricky. Once your show’s 
up and running and you’re enjoying it, those things fall away though. It’s a 
real motivation for getting your show in order.”

Sitting there with the actual Alan Partridge – I don’t think it will ever stop 
being weird

Will he ever attempt something more personal on stage? “I don’t know. Maybe. I 
do think the idea of just going to Edinburgh and being really honest would be 
interesting. But I have no interest in it at all. Maybe one day. I sort of 
feel, purely by accident, I have settled somewhere that’s quite nice for me.”

In the hope of teasing out something more honest, I ask about the new book, 
which ponders whether he has sacrificed his happiness by spending years writing 
poems about things like cricket andKriss Akabusi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/feb/17/sebastian-coe-olympics-film>
, the former sprinter and celebrity motivational speaker. “Everything in there 
is tongue-in-cheek,” he laughs. “No, I don’t think it has been a sacrifice. The 
thing about the poetry is that, because of the way it started, it was always 
something on the side. There’s nobody more surprised than me that I make money 
out of it.”

We go back into his house, where Key hands me a stack of poems, some 
laminated, some written on the back of porn playing cards. There are 2,096 in 
total. The grubbiest, most well-worn one reads: “Tanya Googled herself – still 
nothing.” The words “fuck” and “cunt” are scribbled underneath. Before I can 
ask about Tanya, he’s off out again. Running late for a physio appointment, 
leaving me alone once more, surrounded by Post-its and burnt scripts, the 
mundane and the poetic.

Key notes: four poems by Tim Key

Batesy’s Banter
“While you’re down there …”
Mike Bates said to Candy.
He’d vaguely thought people would laugh at this.
Unfortunately, the reason Candy was crouching
near his groin was precisely to pick up a glass
which Mike had broken.
And also she was his daughter-in-law. So it didn’t get a laugh at all.

Shackles
Harold didn’t go to work one day.
“Sod work!” he thought.
He got up late, checked his emails, checked
 his MySpace and checked to see if there was
 anything new on Google.
Then he drank coffee and sent a group text,
 bragging, and calling his friends suckers.
In the end he went in just before lunch and
 got an official warning.
But, boy, did he feel alive!

Untitled
I counted my wife’s hands.
“One, two.” I said. “Two hands.”
She rolled over and faced the other way.
I think she knew I was avoiding the subject.

Too much all at once
For some reason everyone texted* John.
There was no rhyme or reason to it.
Just everyone John had ever exchanged cellphone
 numbers with all thought of John at the same
 time, and all texted him.
So John got 440 texts:
“Hey man – you’ve got my Fargo DVD still”; “Me
and Jen just realised we haven’t seen you for
 fucking ages – let’s do something about that!”;
 “John, do you have Ron Welch’s number?”
John went through so many emotions that
 morning he lost twenty pounds in weight.
That’s about nine kilos.

* I tend to send about half a dozen SMS texts per day, and I maybe draft two 
or three others. It’s usually a fairly even split between texting people I know 
and entering competitions/using services designed to allow single people to 
flirt with one another. The company that I use charges £1.50 a pop, which, when 
you consider what the girls I’m flirting with look like, represents pretty good 
value.
