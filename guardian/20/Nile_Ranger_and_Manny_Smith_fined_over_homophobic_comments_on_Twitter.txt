Newcastle United's Nile Ranger and Walsall's Manny Smith have been fined 
£6,000 and £1,200 respectively and warned as to their future conduct after 
admitting making homophobic comments on Twitter.

The pair were charged by the Football Association on Monday along with the 
Manchester United striker Federico Macheda. All three were accused of acting in 
a way which was "improper and/or brought the game into disrepute", including "a 
reference to a person's or persons' sexual orientation".

An FA statement on Thursday read: "Newcastle United's Nile Ranger and 
Walsall's Manny Smith have been fined £6,000 and £1,200 respectively and both 
warned as to their future conduct after each admitting a charge of using 
abusive and/or insulting words including a reference to a person's sexual 
orientation.

"The charges relate to Twitter comments and both players requested a paper 
hearing."

No details of the case involving Macheda, currently on loan at QPR, were 
confirmed.

The West Ham United midfielder Ravel Morrison was last week fined £7,000 by 
the FA in response to a homophobic remark made on Twitter. Morrison, who joined 
the club from Manchester United at the end of January for an undisclosed fee, 
is reported to have made the comment in response to another Twitter user.

The 19-year-old was also warned as to his future conduct by the FA.
