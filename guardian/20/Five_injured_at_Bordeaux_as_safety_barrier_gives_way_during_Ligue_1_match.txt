Five people were injured when a safety barrier gave way during Bordeaux’s 
Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> game at home to 
Nantes, French media reported on Sunday.

The barrier, which is supposed to prevent fans from going on to the pitch, 
gave way after Milan Gajic scored the second goal in the hosts’ 2-0 win.

“There are five people injured, including two aged 12 and 14 who were picked 
up by their parents,” aBordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> 
security official said.

A similar incident occurred last May during the Euro 2016 venue’s inaugural 
game at the Nouveau Stade Bordeaux.
