Liverpool’s Divock Origi, the Belgium striker on loan at Lille, has had the 
dubious honour of being named in L’Equipe’sLigue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> worst team of the season.

Liverpool paid £10m for Origi last summer

 after a breakthrough season in Ligue 1 and a series of impressive performances 
at the World Cup but allowed him to stay at Lille in order to further his 
development.

Origi has scored only eight goals in 33 Ligue 1 appearances, which included a 
20-game goal drought between October and March.

The 20-year-old will move to Anfield on a permanent basis this summer and will 
be looking to make an impression in a side who have struggled to score. Brendan 
Rodgers’s team managed 52 goals in the Premier League compared with 101 goals 
during 2013-14, which has partly been blamed on the departure of Luis Suárez to 
Barcelona and injuries to Daniel Sturridge.
