Imanol Agirretxe put Real Sociedad ahead but keeper Gerónimo Rulli conceded a 
penalty and was sent off before half-time. Gerard Moreno Balagueró scored from 
the spot-kick and Enzo Roco headedEspanyol

With four minutes to go Jonathas appeared to have earned Sociedad a draw with 
a clinical finish but there was still time for Pérez to head in from a corner.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>, out of the relegation
