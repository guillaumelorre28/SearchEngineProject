A Happy New Year and satisfied crosswording in 2013 to you all. I hope that 
you have avoided (or by now managed to throw off) the colds, coughs, and 
attacks of flu and of winter vomiting disease that have brought down most of my 
nearest and dearest.

It is an axiom of cryptic crosswords that, however clever or tortured the 
route may be, the answer to a clue, when you finally get it, must clearly be 
the 'right' one. So it is with some professional reluctance that I pass on two 
clues that I let slip through in 2012 where this was not 100% the case, both 
published in November.

First, a clue in Genius No 113 for November by Crucible. In this puzzle 17 
clues led to a word in a well-known pairing, but it was the 'other' word that 
had to be entered in the grid. The clue for 27 across was 'Charlie's place is 
abandoned' and the crosschecking letters were: B*L* . If Charlie is CHAPLIN and 
PL for 'place' is removed, you are left with CHAIN and then the partner to be 
entered in the grid is obviously BALL. But, if Charlie's place is N. UIST, from 
where Flora rowed the Bonnie Prince to Sky and if IS is removed, you are left 
with NUT and then BOLT would fit the bill. I am indebted to Derek Bolton for 
this thought. On balance, though, I still think that Crucible's solution is 
more obviously correct.

Second, Cryptic No 25,783 for 2 November by Paul had the clue (25 across): 
Misshapen genitals, funny things? (3,5). Anne Turner says that, knowing Paul, 
she laughed aloud and confidently entered ODD BALLS in the grid. Unhappily her 
confidence was not rewarded, because those letters in the grid made it 
impossible to get any further with that corner of the puzzle. Paul's intention 
was an anagram of GENITALS to produce TAG LINES. On balance, though, I think 
that Anne was on to a winner, even if it did not fit. What, though, should I do 
if Paul recycles her thought in a future puzzle?

We promised that the solution to Araucaria's special Christmas offering (No 
25,831 would be published on Friday 4 January. It did appear (as an annotated 
solution) on the website that day, together with the names of the winners, but 
a production glitch meant that is was not in the paper.

It is there today (7 January) on. p. 35 and for those who cannot easily access 
www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords the winners were: K Fry, Peterborough; Niall 
Campbell, Beckenham; Stuart & Gwen Fletcher, Chester; Rosalind Glover, London; 
Nik Ruskuc, St Andrews; Niels Polden, Rhyl; Ms L Matthews, Shipley; Jean Hume, 
Saltburn-by-the-Sea; Cliff Lovelock, Aberdeen; and Mr & Mrs S Zetie, Birmingham.

We seem to have been having regular trouble recently in getting the new Genius 
puzzle up and running properly and promptly on the first Monday of each month. 
(The puzzle for January also fell foul of the gremlins again.) This is, I know, 
a great frustration for our insomniac Genius fans and for those living in 
distant time zones. My apologies.

Despite this, December's Genius puzzle (No 114 set by Paul) got no fewer than 
23 correct entries on the first day and a substantial 319 by the deadline. The 
first in would have been Ian at 00:45, except for an error in the entered 
answer to the last down clue. The line honours went instead to Dave at 01:08. 
The first outlander was PSC in Australia at 03:41.

Congratulations to Nick Inglis from Cambridge, who is December's winner.
