“The team travelled on Saturday morning at around 8 o’clock and I woke up and 
wasn’t feeling too well so I decided I wasn’t well enough to travel,” the 
23-year-old said.

“I was staying in bed all day and that’s when the bad weather started to hit. 
The water was literally at the door and I thought: ‘Something serious is going 
to happen here’.

“I phoned the police and there were more priority cases than me so from 9am 
until 6pm I was upstairs watching it unfold. Eventually they came for me and I 
was lifted out of the upstairs window.”

While club officials await permission to return to Brunton Park, the squad 
hope to be able to train as normal at their weekday practice base which appears 
to have escaped the worst of the weather.
