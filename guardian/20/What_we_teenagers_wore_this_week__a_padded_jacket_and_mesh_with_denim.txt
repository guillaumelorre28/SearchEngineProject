Not so long ago, padded jackets were considered a fashion faux pas – a 
shapeless mass of material that shouts, “I was made to choose between elegance 
and the elements, and the elements won”.

Now they have been resurrected on the catwalk, by Fendi, Balenciaga, Stella 
McCartney and Vetements, among others, who swapped drab shapes and shades for 
sharp cuts and fun colours. If you look back at paparazzi shots of Victoria 
Beckham in 2000, wearing a bright silver, super-puffy cropped number, she is 
bang on trend.

If you haven’t got a Beckham budget, or the bravery to wear a jacket that 
could have you looking like the Tin Man, then the high street has plenty of 
options (not to mention a cheeky student discount).

I normally wear my jacket with a tighter bottom half: skinny jeans or a mini 
skirt, to balance the silhouette. Another favourite outfit is the Bershka 
jacket I’m wearing here, with a simple dress underneath, a choker and my Vans 
(this also works in the evening). I bought it in black, because it goes with so 
much, but I’ve got my eye on a gorgeous tomato red one.

Of course, the trusty padded jacket is not just about looking cool: as the 
temperature drops, it’s the perfect thing to grab as I rush to college – 
something I’m sure my mum is very thankful for.

I started wearing mesh clothing about three or four years ago. You can layer 
it, wear it long or short, in all sorts of colours and sizes; these days, mesh 
is just my thing.

This isn’t a look for church. It’s influenced by clubwear: the mix of fishnet, 
mesh and denim is a bit 80s Madonna, a bit 90s Take That. Now, evenKim 
Kardashian 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BK6i_xFja-g/?taken-by=kimkardashian&hl=en> is 
posing in fishnets under denim, so it’s officially back.

My style inspirations are female rapper Brooke Candy 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Candy>, Lady Gaga (and her stylist Nicola 
Formichetti <http://www.nicolaformichetti.com/>), makeup artist Jeffree Star 
<https://www.instagram.com/jeffreestar/?hl=en>. They are all bold and fearless, 
qualities I really admire. I wouldn’t leave the house without a touch of 
makeup. It started as a way to cover my acne, but now it’s just fun.

For this photograph I’m wearing grey mesh with grey denim and sparkly 
fishnets; by having the top and the jeans in the same shade, you notice the 
different textures, and it makes the teal trainers really pop out. It can look 
like sportswear, but I would never step foot in a gym; the fishnets, choker and 
belt add an edge.

My rules for making this look work? The larger the fishnet, the better. And, 
as ever, confidence is key.
