Louis van Gaal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/louis-van-gaal> claimed 
“everything was against us” following Manchester United’s goalless draw against 
Cambridge in the FA Cup, a result that earned the League Two side a lucrative 
replay at Old Trafford following a remarkably courageous performance.

United dominated the second half but were undone by their slow start to the 
fourth-round tie, with Van Gaal ruing his side’s early malaise. The Dutchman 
blamed the pitch and the referee although he praised Cambridge’s organised 
display.

“Every aspect of a match is against us,” said Van Gaal, who rested Wayne 
Rooney and Juan Mata for the tie. “We have to come here, the pitch isn’t so 
good, that can influence that you can play in another style. The opponents 
always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier 
than attacking. Then you have seen the referee – it’s always the same. 
Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other 
clubs, it’s always the same.

“It was a pity we had to wait until half-time. In the second half I was 
pleased but we didn’t score. I have to give the credit to this club.Cambridge 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united> played very well, 
they were very well organised. They fought till the end. We could have scored I 
think but we are still in the Cup and that’s the most important thing. I have 
seen big clubs lose against such opponents.”

 The Cambridge United coach, Richard Money, says he finds it difficult to put 
into words how proud he is after his side drew with Manchester United in the FA 
Cup 
The Cambridge manager, Richard Money, described the prospect of a replay as 
“mind-blowing” in terms of the long-term financial boost it could have. Money 
also confirmed that no Cambridge player asked to swap shirts with an opponent 
at full-time.

“It’s difficult to put into words really,” he said. “This club has been in the 
doldrums for so many years and here we are taking Man United back to Old 
Trafford. It’s going to mean an incredible amount. Mind-blowing. I’m sure the 
chairman wouldn’t have been too happy if we had scored in the second half. 
We’re going to Old Trafford. Who cares what happens? Just enjoy it and soak it 
in. Whatever happens happens.”
