The Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Jordan Archer was attacked by a fan in 
stoppage time of his side's 1-0League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> win over Gillingham at 
the Priestfield Stadium on Monday night.

The 19-year-old – who is on loan from Tottenham Hotspur – was placing the ball 
before taking a goal-kick when the supporter ran on to the field from behind 
the goal and knocked him over by jumping into his back.

The fan was quickly apprehended by stewards and led away. Archer got up 
immediately and was able to continue uninjured.

"Some people give the rest of the Gillingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gillingham> fans a bad name," Wycombe's 
manager, Gareth Ainsworth, told Sky Sports 1. "I don't want to comment too 
much, but everyone is OK in there."

The Football Association can be expected to open an investigation into the 
incident.
