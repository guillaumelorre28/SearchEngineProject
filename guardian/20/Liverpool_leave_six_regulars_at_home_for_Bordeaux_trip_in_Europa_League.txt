Brendan Rodgers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brendan-rodgers> has 
omitted several first-team regulars from Liverpool’s Europa League trip to 
Bordeaux as he seeks to limit its impact on Sunday’s pressured Premier League 
game against Norwich City.

Six of the team that started Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/12/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report>
 have not travelled for Liverpool’s opening Group B fixture in France. 
Christian Benteke, Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren, James Milner, Lucas Leiva and 
Nathaniel Clyne have stayed on Merseyside, andJordan Henderson remains absent

 with a heel injury that has required treatment in the United States this week.

Philippe Coutinho, who was suspended for the Old Trafford loss, and Adam 
Lallana, who has missed the past three games with a thigh problem, have been 
included.

The absence of Rodgers’ first-choice centre-backs is likely to see Mamadou 
Sakho make his first appearance of the season alongside Kolo Touré at Stade de 
Bordeaux with Alberto Moreno at left-back. Benteke’s omission creates an 
opportunity for the former Lille striker Divock Origi or Danny Ings to lead the 
Liverpool attack withDaniel Sturridge still working his way back

 from a hip operation.

The academy graduates Jordan Rossiter, Connor Randall, Cameron Brannagan and 
Dan Cleary are also in a Liverpool squad that reflects the importance of 
Norwich’s visit to Anfield this weekend. Successive league defeatsby West Ham  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/29/liverpool-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report>
and Manchester United plus several underwhelming performances have increased 
scrutiny on Rodgers before the Norwich game, although the Liverpool manager 
also needs to convince in Europe following last season’s disappointments.

Liverpool won only two of eight European fixtures last term – at home to 
Ludogorets in the Champions League and Besiktas in theEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> – as they exited both 
tournaments at the first hurdle.
