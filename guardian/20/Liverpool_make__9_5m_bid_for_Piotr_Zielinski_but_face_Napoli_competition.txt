Liverpool made the bid on Saturday with Jürgen Klopp also speaking to the 
22-year-old midfielder on the phone to reassure the player he would have an 
important role to play at Anfield next season and beyond.

Udinese want £12m for the player, who has spent the past two seasons out on 
loan at Empoli. Napoli have offered £8.7m plus add-ons with the club’s 
president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, saying on Sunday: “Liverpool have made a bid 
for him and Zielinski wants to join them but we are trying to convince the 
player to join us, because we have an agreement withUdinese

Zielinski played for the incumbent Napoli manager, Maurizio Sarri, at Empoli 
and the latter is keen to work with the player again. The Polish midfielder had 
struggled in Italy before Sarri took over at Empoli and transformed the young 
player into a complete box-to-box midfielder.

The Polish international would become Klopp’s fourth summer signing after the 
arrivals of the Serbian midfielder Marko Grujic, the Cameroonian defender Joël 
Matip and the German goalkeeper Loris Karius.
