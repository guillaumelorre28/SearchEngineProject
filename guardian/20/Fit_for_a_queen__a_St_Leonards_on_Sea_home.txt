I spent less time on deciding to buy my apartment than I would a pair of 
shoes. I’d seen the 12ft floor-to-ceiling windows and 30 seconds later had said 
yes. But that’s how the place affected me: it was gut instinct.

William IV’s widow, Queen Adelaide, moved here in 1837 and the living room was 
her bedroom

The windows are quite something – they’re the only original element that 
survive from when the house was built in 1835. Like many large homes, Adelaide 
House has been tweaked and chopped and tinkered with over the years, removing 
all character.

 Keep it simple: the kitchen with its white tiles and movable island.

But that meant I could start afresh, reinventing the space. Being slavish over 
the refurbishment was pointless – too much had been lost. I’d nod to the 
building’s history instead through egg-and-dart cornicing and the campest 
ceiling rose I could get. Finding a chandelier was a problem. I fell in love 
with an expensive Murano glass design. So I found a factory in China to hand 
blow something similar for a fraction of the cost.

Rather than employ a designer I trusted my own judgment. Scale, colour and 
simplicity were key. Wide engineered-oak planks are used throughout the flat, 
knitting the space together and creating free-flowing living areas that focus 
on the spectacular view of the sea. Bannisters went out in favour of plate 
glass, ensuring a sea view even from the back of the kitchen.

 Up the honey pears: the use of glass at the back ensures that there is plenty

To my mind, the kitchen is the single most important room. I dislike wall 
cupboards and kitchens that are too fitted. So I created a movable island with 
storage for crockery and drawers for utensils. Stainless-steel countertops give 
it a semi-industrial feel, and a Bertazzoni range cooker adds to that flavour.

I kept furnishings simple and bold. The sofa, Eames-style armchair and 
midcentury wing chair are complemented by oak armchairs reupholstered in 
cowhide and a large kilim. Local artistRoberto Landin 
<http://robertolandin.com/> created the two dark blue paintings and the 
coloured skull installation.

 Ahead of the curve: the grey and white exterior of Adelaide House. Photograph: 
Caroline Arber 
It was important to me that the shelving beside the stairs was sculptural, so 
I designed it to house objects rather than the practicalities of books. And 
it’s from that mezzanine level that I think are the best sea views. I never 
tire of walking out from my bedroom each morning to see what the day is doing.

Both bedrooms have antique beds. In the guest room is a William IV half tester 
– a reference to his widow, Queen Adelaide. She moved to the house in 1837 
after leaving Buckingham Palace, and my living room was her bedroom. If the 
place was good enough for that old queen, then it’s good enough for me.
