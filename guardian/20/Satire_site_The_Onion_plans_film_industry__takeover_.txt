Originally set up in 1988 by students at the University of Wisconsin, the 
Onion has grown in stature to become a multimedia digital brand without losing 
its impressive comic edge. It closed its print edition in 2013 but a rumoured 
$200m investment by company Univision in 2015 valued the company at around 
$500m.

The Onion is following other digital media brands into the film business: most 
notably BuzzFeed, which is collaborating with Warner Bros and Ellen DeGeneres on
Brother Orange

 by BuzzFeed editor Matt Stopera about his lost mobile phone.

There are no details yet as to the content of the Onion movies, but Kyle Ryan, 
vice president of Onion Studios, put out a suitably witty statement, saying: 
“We’ve plotted our takeover of the film industry for some time … We’ll make 
room on our award shelf for some Oscars. To the basement you go, Pulitzers.”
