When the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was over, and the shouting and screaming and 
crying and fireworks began, it had the air of a painting by Caravaggio: 
everybody and everything appeared hidden in shadows as the bright lights were 
beamed on the hero of the moment.

The race at the Yas Marina Circuit ends in twilight, a desert dusk, and for 
Hamilton there would have been an even more profound sense of darkness, an 
abyss, a gloom that might have entered his very spirit and soul, if he had not 
won the championship after dominating most of the season.

He led the race from the start and controlled it from the front, which 
suggests anticlimax, especially when his arch rival and Mercedes team-mate,Nico 
Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>, had difficulties with 
his car. However, at least the dreadful contrivance of double points for this 
race kept everything alive, for Rosberg knew that, even if he could hobble home 
in fifth, it would be enough to steal the title if Hamilton had a mishap and 
failed to finish.

The best part was the start. When the lights went out Hamilton resembled a 
drag racer and within 40-50 metres, it seemed, he was ahead of Rosberg with a 
blistering launch from second spot. By the end of the second lap he was already 
leading by 1.4 seconds.

As early as lap nine Hamilton was told to be ready to come in for fresh rubber 
and when he did it was a clean pit stop, allowing him to rejoin the race in 
third place. There was more good news for Hamilton when on lap 25, shortly 
before the halfway stage, Rosberg reported problems with his engine recovery 
system and he started to lose about a second a lap. It was at the same time 
that the sun started to go down on Yas Marina – and on Rosberg’s title hopes.

“It feels like more than the ERS,” he told his race engineer, Tony Ross. “I’m 
literally holding back. Please investigate now please. It’s more than the ERS.”

As Rosberg fell back he was drawn into the clutches of the Williams driver 
Felipe Massa, who went past on lap 27, with the German looking helpless to 
resist. By lap 28 Hamilton was 13.8 seconds ahead of Massa, with Rosberg a 
further 2.6 seconds adrift. By lap 30 there was some concern from Hamilton’s 
supporters because he started to drop back towards Massa, his lead slipping 
from 11 seconds to nine. It then emerged, however, that Mercedes had turned 
down the British driver’s engine.

When Hamilton pitted again, Massa took the lead and by lap 33 the Brazilian 
had an advantage of more than 15 seconds and was even thinking of his first win 
since the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2008, when Hamilton won his first title. It 
was a forlorn-sounding Rosberg who said to his team: “Just get me in the top 
five or six!”

Hamilton was thinking only of winning the race, as well as the championship. 
“Tell me what I have to do,” he asked his race engineer, Peter Bonnington. 
Meanwhile, when Rosberg pitted again on lap 35 he rejoined the field back in 
seventh place. He asked his team: “How am I looking for that position [fifth] I 
need in case Lewis drops out?” He was told: “It’s not good at the moment,” to 
which a frustrated sounding Rosberg said: “What the hell does that mean?” He 
was then told: “Just drive flat out, Nico.”

As Hamilton pleaded with his garage to “turn up the car” his team-mate asked: 
“Hey guys what’s going on? The car’s switched off and now the throttle’s all 
over the place. Get my brake pedal back now, please!”

Hamilton started to close on Massa but regained the lead only when the 
Williams driver pitted again after 43 laps. By lap 44 Hamilton was leading by 
almost 11 seconds but was told to keep up the pace because Massa was now on 
super-soft tyres and was cutting into his lead. In the end, however, there was 
no threat from Massa as Hamilton controlled his leadand won by 2.5 seconds

. It was then time for fireworks and a frenzy of celebration.

Williams took the other two podium places, with Massa finishing ahead of 
Valtteri Bottas. There was yet another impressive drive from Red Bull’s Daniel 
Ricciardo, who came fourth, despite starting from the pit lane because of a 
penalty.

His team-mate, Sebastian Vettel, who appears to have lost his focus this year, 
finished eighth as heprepares for his move to Ferrari
