Bacca put Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> ahead in the 
21st minute when he scored with the outside of his foot after Giacomo 
Bonaventura had backheeled the ball into his path, but Sweden international 
Hiljemark levelled with a free- kick 11 minutes later.

Bonaventura put Milan back in front five minutes before half-time when he 
curled in a free-kick of his own, before Palermo coach Giuseppe Iachini was 
sent off for dissent.

Palermo took control early in the second half and deservedly equalised in the 
72nd minute when Hiljemark ran on to Alberto Gilardino’s pass and placed the 
ball beyond Diego López.

But Bacca struck again three minutes later, heading in Juraj Kucka’s cross 
from the right to take Milan up to joint-ninth in the table with six points, 
one behind seventh-placed Palermo.
