My most unsettling heckle wasn’t verbal. I was struggling on stage. My 
material wasn’t funny. My face wasn’t funny. I’d forgotten the meaning of 
funny. I tried some banter and asked a bloke in the front row what his name 
was. He answered by lifting his kilt, showing me he was a true Scotsman. He 
kept eye contact throughout, enjoying silencing me by the power of his penis. 
Afterwards, I huddled in the bar with the others having a postmortem pint. Kilt 
man walked past and gave me a predatory wink. It made me vow to improve my 
improv skills.

 Aatif Nawaz deals with a heckler. Warning: strong language. 
Aatif Nawaz

When I mentioned in my Edinburgh show that I don’t drink, a chap took 
exception and kept asking me why. My short answer was that I would end up being 
as annoying as he was. While that moved things on for the audience, it didn’t 
for me. Afterwards, I watchedDarren Walsh’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/25/darren-walsh-dave-award-for-joke-of-the-edinburgh-fringe>
s show Punderbolt. Who did I find sitting next to me? Yep. That was an 
uncomfortable 60 minutes.

Before I even got to the mic, someone made a joke about me having small 
genitals. It’s probably a testament to how dislikable I am on first appearance 
that the audience took his side so quickly. The more he heckled, the more they 
egged him on. It was horrific. I waited outside at the end with flights of 
fancy about flaying him on the skewer in the kebab shop next door. When he 
emerged, five of his burly mates followed him. My response? “Thanks for coming 
to the show! Great banter!” He sneered and walked off. It bothered me for about 
two weeks afterwards. OK, three weeks. One month. Fine, it still bothers me.

 Viv Groskop: ‘By the time the heckler had thought up a response, another act 
was on.’ 
Viv Groskop

The pricelessly retro heckle “£20 to see your titties”, which I got at Gits 
and Shiggles in Edinburgh, was caused by a feminist joke I used to tell. “How 
many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb? None. Don’t change the 
lightbulb – because in the dark, no one can judge a woman by her appearance.” 
It was 1am, the whole room was wasted. By the time the heckler had thought up a 
response, another act was on. Because that act was also a woman, he thought I 
was still on stage. Later, I found him sitting between his mother and his 
sister, who were hitting him. The £20 was used to buy me, his mother and his 
sister a drink.

Abi Roberts

I did a series of shows in Russia, performing in Russian and English. One 
night in Moscow, I noticed three men in leather with bulges in their jacket 
pockets – they were almost certainly gangsters. One of them stood up, raised 
his fist and shouted: “English? Finished. America? Finished. Russia? Victory!” 
The whole audience went silent. I said: “Where are you from, my friend?” He 
said: “Ukraine.” I said: “You’re very noisy and you’re Ukrainian. Are you sure 
you feel safe here? There’s an emergency exit right there, and I know a taxi 
driver who can get you out.” The audience burst out in laughter. At the bar, he 
bought me a bottle of vodka.

It was Friday night at a Portsmouth rock venue where the floor gets so sticky 
you have to be peeled off it. I got heckled, another audience member got wound 
up by it and, before I knew it, they were squaring up to each other and were 
thrown out. I found Heckler 2 – the one who’d defended me – smoking a cigarette 
outside. He said it was “only the second time” he’d engaged in physical combat 
as an audience member. He was an ex-squaddie, he said. I imagined him on the 
frontline; now he was policing standup gigs in Hampshire.

 Sarah Kendall: ‘I spotted my heckler later, drinking alone in a crowded bar’ 
Sarah Kendall

During the most emotionally charged point in my show – a very personal one, 
with some swearing – a woman stomped across the stage to the exit. “You don’t 
have to use this type of language,” she said. “It’s just lazy.” I spotted her 
afterwards. She was drinking alone, in a noisy, crowded bar on a Saturday 
night. I knew I’d be a total dick getting into an argument. “Hello,” I said. “I 
was going to have a go at you, but it feels weird now.” She smiled. “Don’t 
worry about it. I got a refund.”

Dominic Frisby

One freezing night in November, there was a bloke in a vest and shorts who 
looked a bit like Dolph Lundgren. The first half of the show I was doing a load 
of German material and Dolph was in stitches. In the second half he stood up 
and was waving his arms about, threatening me. He was so big and ripped and 
angry the bouncers didn’t go anywhere near him. I ran upstairs, found a 
cupboard and hid in it. Later, I crept outside and saw him crying his eyes out. 
It turned out his dad was German, so he loved that part of the act, and then 
something I said later reminded him of his stepdad, who he hated. I ended up 
feeling sorry for him, despite having been as frightened as I’ve ever been.

An old colleague got in touch to let me know she was coming to one of my 
shows. I was pretty excited until it started. She was absolutely rat-arsed. 
Fact corrections and uproarious disagreement were part of the live feedback I 
endured as she created that perfect blend of discomfort and volatility that 
puts strangers in a small, dark room at ease. Afterwards she was delighted at 
her performance. She was too drunk for me to disagree.

Alexei Sayle

On my first big tour in 1982, I played the seafront theatre in Southend. In 
Essex, my audience was always very mixed: college lecturers, factory workers, 
soldiers, police. The front row was taken up by a gang of skinheads who I think 
were National Front. The skinheads got quite rowdy. I told them they’d got the 
wrong show, what with me being a communist Jew. They didn’t seem to care. They 
had as much right to be there as anybody else, and they weren’t really a 
problem. From time to time, I’d wind them up about being Nazis and they’d shout 
back. Afterwards, they came backstage and seemed very nice … though they did 
drink all of the beer.

Alex Kealy

During one gig in [provincial English town name redacted], my comedic combo of 
awkward self-hatred and leftist politics was not prospering. A man doing his 
best impression of a Viking gone to seed loudly asked, in a tone bored but 
furious, whether my act ever went down well. A gig I thought was already at 
rock bottom was being fracked towards hitherto unimaginable depths. I didn’t 
recover. As I left the stage, he forced my hand into his and shook it, as if to 
say: “That was all a bit of a laugh, wasn’t it?” I hate hecklers who accost you 
afterwards and force you to agree that they weren’t being an arsehole, that 
we’re all friends, even if they’ve just made you miserable before a late-night, 
four-hour drive home. Don’t come and shake my hand. Let me hate you in peace.

Carl Donnelly

The best heckle I’ve received was during a show about my tearaway youth as a 
shoplifter. I mentioned a childhood friend I’d not seen in 15 years. There was 
mumbling in the audience, so I stopped and heard: “It’s me, Carl!” I asked for 
the lights to go up and there was my old friend Louie, who was watching me 
perform for the first time. We hugged on stage. The crowd applauded like it was 
an episode of Surprise Surprise.

I do a character called Sanitary Bag Lady, based on the woman in the 
illustration on those disposable paper bags you get in toilets. She’s in black 
and white, wearing a bonnet, and has an air of Scarlett O’Hara about her – 
which is odd for a woman whose job is to eat tampons. When I play her, I sniff 
out periods and shout: “We bleed motherfuckers! We bleed!” One night, a drunk 
lady thought I was telling her off and started heckling. I was wearing an A3 
cardboard hat and employing a deep southern accent, so dropped all that to deal 
with her. A man stood up and said: “No one wants to hear this!” I was trying to 
reason with everyone, but he went to grab my microphone. I told him off and 
started handing out tampons. After the show, he waited outside. He stood close 
by, listening and watching as I spoke to my friend. I paused, we looked at each 
other. I felt bad. He didn’t know what to say, and I didn’t know how to explain 
why I dress up as a southern belle to try and confront people’s fears about 
menstruation. I got in my friend’s car and he watched us as we drove off.

I don’t meet many hecklers. They normally leave at the break, due to me and 
the audience making a fool of them. I had one nightmare guy, shouting 
“Toblerone”. He was so drunk he wouldn’t stop. Afterwards, he came right up to 
me and said: “I made that gig for you. If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have 
had such a good gig.” I told him I was heading into the shop to buy a Toblerone 
to shove up his arse. His girlfriend started on me and I ended the night by 
telling her to get “Crunchie face” into a cab. I never saw them again.

Pierre Novellie

At the end of one gig, I foolishly joked about taking questions from the 
audience. A hand shot up and a plaintive voice announced: “I didn’t 
understand.” The voice was so sincere it got a huge laugh. The woman had found 
everything I said utterly baffling, and I ended up explaining the thinking 
behind every joke. It got a lot of laughs purely from the weirdness. She wasn’t 
angry or upset, just confused and disappointed. The next day, she emailed and 
asked me out on a date. I agreed for three reasons. Firstly, the story. 
Secondly, I am an idiot. Thirdly, I reasoned that being murdered and eaten by 
this woman would be one of the few guaranteed ways to get my name out there. We 
went for a drink and it became clear that her motive for seeing me was a 
zoo-like curiosity. Things fell apart when I proved to be mundane. This is the 
danger of dating audience members: their disappointment when you fail to be a 
freewheeling clown-genius all day long. She asked me if I practised jokes in 
the bedroom mirror. “Of course!” I replied, explaining I had to hurry home to 
get up early enough to do just that.
