The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 

I’ll never forget Kevin McAleer’s Edinburgh warmup at the King’s Head in 
Crouch End in July 2006. I had to sit on the floor at the back of the room, 
cover my ears and try not to think about him for a bit. I couldn’t really cope 
with how funny it was.

The funniest book I’ve ever read 

Steve Aylett’s Lint. It’s absurdly brilliant. There was one sentence about a 
baffled chef I must’ve read over and over about 100 times it made me laugh so 
much. I was ill with laughing.

The funniest person I know 

My friend Helen Minsky. She can’t not be funny.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had 

A hairdresser made me look like Oliver Cromwell about three years ago. It 
wasn’t great.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen 

I just watched Best In Show again after first seeing it years ago and was 
struck by how great it is. It’s constantly hilarious, but also deeply, 
profoundly moving. Eugene Levy as Gerry Fleck explaining that he has two left 
feet and can’t dance is masterful.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 

Very hard to pick one sketch, but Amy Schumer’s are brilliant. In particular: 
12 Angry Men, Last Fuckable Day, Football Town Nights and Milk Milk Lemonade.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had

A small dog that was growling from inside a woman’s bag.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 

Strawberry-flavoured edible pants from Ann Summers that had 
chocolate-flavoured straps on the sides. I thought they were pretty funny. This 
was in the 80s and I have absolutely no idea who they came from. I think my 
sister said her friend was a rep or something and we got some funny free stuff. 
I never wore them as they seemed like the devil’s business and that they’d melt 
up into my bum and I’d get some awful infection. So I just ate them instead, 
with baked beans and potato waffles.

The funniest meal I’ve ever had 

See above.
