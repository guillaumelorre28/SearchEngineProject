Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed an agreement  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/09/etienne-capoue-tottenham-snubs-cardiff>
with Toulouse to sign the France midfielder Etienne Capoue. The fee is believed 
to be around €11m (£9.4m).

The 25-year-old, who has seven full caps for France, made his Toulouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/toulouse> debut in 2007 and went on to 
become one of their most important players. He was also named in the Ligue 1 
Team of the Year in 2012 alongside his new Spurs team-mate Hugo Lloris.

A tweet from the club's official Twitter account said: "We are delighted to 
announce that we have reached agreement with Toulouse for the transfer of 
Etienne Capoue. A France international, Etienne has made 174 appearances, 
scoring 13 times in Ligue 1 for Toulouse."

Tottenham had to see off a late bid from Cardiff City who had seen an offer of 
around £9m accepted by Toulouse. Spurs start their new campaign away at 
newly-promoted Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon, but it is unclear whether 
Capoue will be available for selection.

Despite being primarily a midfielder, Capoue can also operate as a centre-back 
which could prove useful for Villas-Boas as he is short in that area of the 
pitch.

Capoue becomes Tottenham's fourth major acquisition of the summer following 
moves for Paulinho, Nacer Chadli and Roberto Soldado as Villas-Boas looks to 
build a squad capable of securing a top-four finish this season.
