Rochdale have been staging their own War of the Roses this winter, and so far 
it's gone pretty well, victories over Rotherham and Leeds taking them into the 
fourth round for only the fourth time in their history, and the first in 11 
years. But Wednesday's form since Stuart Gray was put in caretaker charge, 
following the dismissal of Dave Jones last month, suggests they will present 
the toughest Tyke challenge yet – Leeds were hit for six at Hillsborough the 
week after their shock at Spotland. Having drawn 0-0 on their last visit to
Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> in Jones's first game 
in charge in March 2012, they are aiming to reach the last 32 for only the 
second time since they last played in the Premier League in 1999-2000. They 
will again have to do without their loan signing Connor Wickham, who does not 
have permission from Sunderland to play.Andy Wilson
