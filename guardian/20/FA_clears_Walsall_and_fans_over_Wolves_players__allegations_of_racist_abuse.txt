The Football Association has cleared Walsall and their fans of wrongdoing 
following allegations of racist abuse towards twoWolverhampton Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolves> players.

Carl Ikeme and George Elokobi reported the abuse which allegedly occurred in 
two separate incidents during the Sky BetLeague One

clubs at the Banks's Stadium on 8 March.

In a letter to Walsall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/walsall>, the FA 
said: "Walsall FC immediately started an investigation and we have now received 
the club's full response.

"Walsall have advised the FA that no reports of racist abuse were made to the 
control room on the day by stewards or police and that nothing was reported by 
the match officials.

"Since the game, Walsall have carried out a full review of the CCTV footage 
and advise that there is nothing of evidential use in respect of racist 
behaviour.

"Also that at their subsequent home game on 11 March the club took the 
opportunity to question all stewards working in the relevant areas of the 
ground and none of them reported hearing any racist abuse at the Wolves game.

"In the circumstances, we can confirm that the FA is not in a position to take 
any further action in this matter."

A statement released by Walsall read: "Walsall Football Club have taken the 
allegation very seriously and have fully co-operated with the FA and 
Wolverhampton Wanderers.

"We promote an inclusive philosophy. We are proud of the work we undertake 
within the local community and beyond and are committed to social inclusion.

"Walsall is a multicultural town and we do not tolerate discrimination of any 
kind."
