“I can confirm it’s true,” he said. “We have spoken with the club and made the 
best decisions for the club and the team; we’ve taken this decision in 
conjunction with the club’s directors and it doesn’t alter the possibility of 
renewing terms again once the new arrangement ends. It’s us showing what we 
feel for the club by our deeds. Everyone can relax, we’re fine.”

Asked for details over why the change had been implemented, Simeone added: “We 
needed to do what we feel is fair; we understand that it’s an important 
situation for all of us but what is written in contracts is private. The only 
thing I ask is that the lads in the team give their heart and soul. In two 
years’ time we can renew and sign a new deal, it doesn’t mean it’s the end.”

Atlético, who have picked up five points from their first three La Liga 
matches this season, face Sporting Gijon on Saturday.
