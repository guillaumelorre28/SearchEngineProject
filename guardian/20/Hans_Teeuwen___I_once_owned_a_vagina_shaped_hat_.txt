The funniest standup I’ve ever seen

Richard Pryor live in concert. He was a fantastic performer and great actor. 
His act was all about telling uncomfortable truths in a very, very funny way.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen

WC Fields playing pool <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEIUW5Rslrc> and 
explaining how he got the nickname Honest John.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 

A vagina-shaped hat.

The funniest person I know

My mother before she started doing coke. Her comedy used to be very physical. 
Now it’s just talking, talking, talking. Sometimes funny, mostly boring.

The funniest word

It.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen 

I cannot decide between Spinal Tap 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STHKFlO-zBw> and The Big Lebowski 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZR58d77a4A>, but probably The Big Lebowski. 
The Cohen brothers managed, with great success, to celebrate the hippy when it 
was completely out of fashion. With each viewing, it becomes more profound.

The funniest book I’ve ever read

The Bonfire Of The Vanities by Tom Wolfe. It was the first attack on political 
correctness I had come across.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen

I can never choose between The Office 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-z4W6dDRw> and I’m Alan Partridge 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUDEUnlg7TQ>.

The funniest number

3.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had

There is nothing funny about hair, it’s just very thin strings on your head.

The funniest dream I’ve ever had

The one where I was licking Vladimir Putin’s face like a popsicle. All this 
time he was trying to make a speech and he got more and more annoyed with me.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

My father’s scrotum. You want your parents to be role models and not an object 
of ridicule, but it’s hard to look at his balls and not burst out laughing.
