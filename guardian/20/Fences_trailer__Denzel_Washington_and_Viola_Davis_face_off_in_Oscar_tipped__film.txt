Washington directs Wilson’s own screen adaptation, about a retired baseball 
player named Troy Maxson (Washington), now working as a Pittsburgh garbage man, 
who’s regretful about how his life turned out. Davis plays Troy’s wife, Rose.


The trailer is powerfully persuasive, opening with a scene of Troy admonishing 
his son that’s intercut with flashes from the rest of the film, before 
concluding with an explosive outburst from Davis.
