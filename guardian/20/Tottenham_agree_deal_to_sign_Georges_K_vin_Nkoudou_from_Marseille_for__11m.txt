 last week, Mauricio Pochettino has been keen to make further additions to his 
squad before the start of the Premier League season. The Spurs head coach had 
considered an offer for the £20m-rated Lille playmaker Sofiane Boufal, who is 
also being monitored by Chelsea and Arsenal as he recovers from a knee injury, 
before settling on a move for Nkoudou instead last week.

The 21-year-old, who moved to the Stade Vélodrome last summer from Nantes for 
£1m, has been scouted by several other clubs including Liverpool, West Ham and 
Manchester United and scored 10 goals in all competitions last season.

But despite offers from Hamburg and interest from Bournemouth and Sevilla, 
Marseille have given Tottenham permission to begin negotiations over personal 
terms with Nkoudou, and the player is likely to travel to London for a medical 
in the next 48 hours. It is believed he will sign a five-year contract after 
speaking to Pochettino on the phone at the end of last week.

The French club are also keen to take the Cameroon forward Clinton Njie on 
loan from Tottenham just a year after he joined from Lyon, although this is not 
understood to be part of the Nkoudou deal. Nkoudou was born in Versailles and 
began his career at Paris Saint-Germain before joining Nantes in 2013.
