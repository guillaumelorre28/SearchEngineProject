Candice wins GBBO 2016!

Oh CANDICE WINS! 

I‘m meant to make a bigger deal of that. But as discussed, I need the toilet 
very badly.

All good things come to an end. And all bad things. Everything dies, that’s 
what I’m saying. I didn’t want that to be the last notable thing I said on 
here. But what the hell.

Anyway, you people have been magnificent. Thanks for being so supportive, and 
welcoming me in. Get yourselves over to the incredible Heidi’sStrictly blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heidistephens>, where she continues to do 
all of this backwards, in heels.

I’ll resume my Inspect A Gadget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rhik-samadder> ‘job’, and will mainly be 
procrastinating on twitter,so come say hi <https://twitter.com/whatsamadder> 
there, or onInstant Gran <https://www.instagram.com/whatsamadder/>, or in real 
life. Unless I’m gesticulating wildly at passing cars, in which case I’m busy.

Goodbye, you soggy bottoms. Miss you

“Candice and Jane are planning a baking road trip together...”

Thelma And Genoise...

MikeMoonlight I’m giving you the last word here because that is unbeatable. 
And sums up how funny and lovely this community is, you BTL heroes. They said 
it couldn’t happen on the internet. We proved it can, as long as you hide the 
destination url, so it’s occasionally difficult to find!

“If at first you don’t succeed, try another two times so that your failure is 
statistically significant”. Aratan this is magnificent, 
nihilistic-statistician’s advice. I like.

I’m gonna miss you people very much. I’ll just chuck that on the GBBO sadness 
pile, which is already towering.

Smart move BBC, hooking us with that Sherlock trailer. Just when you thought 
you could have a little break from TV. Val as Moriarty is inspired, HCollider. 
Also you’ve been to a royal garden party? Did you steal anything?

Jane and Candice are going on a baking road trip! Ahh! Why? What even is that? 
I hope their rooms are on different floors.

I read a Sherlock Holmes story where a dude killed another dude by feeding a 
little snake through the air vent. I’m just saying that, apropos of nothing.

Of course it’s Candice! Look at her apron. It look like it’s stained with the 
blood of her foes!

But well done, CB! She really is an artist, and I consistently wanted to eat 
her creations right off the screen. In fact I invalidated my TV warranty for 
that very reason.

Hmm. So what do we think? Candice’s scone was her only weakness, but they all 
shared that. She was the only one to achieve the pastry bake. Personally I 
preferred Andrew’s presentation. But the good money must be on the PE teacher. 
They’re a very competitive people.

Oh CANDICE WINS! 

I‘m meant to make a bigger deal of that. But as discussed, I need the toilet 
very badly.

All good things come to an end. And all bad things. Everything dies, that’s 
what I’m saying. I didn’t want that to be the last notable thing I said on 
here. But what the hell.

Anyway, you people have been magnificent. Thanks for being so supportive, and 
welcoming me in. Get yourselves over to the incredible Heidi’sStrictly blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heidistephens>, where she continues to do 
all of this backwards, in heels.

I’ll resume my Inspect A Gadget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rhik-samadder> ‘job’, and will mainly be 
procrastinating on twitter,so come say hi <https://twitter.com/whatsamadder> 
there, or onInstant Gran <https://www.instagram.com/whatsamadder/>, or in real 
life. Unless I’m gesticulating wildly at passing cars, in which case I’m busy.

Goodbye, you soggy bottoms. Miss you

“Candice and Jane are planning a baking road trip together...”

Thelma And Genoise...

MikeMoonlight I’m giving you the last word here because that is unbeatable. 
And sums up how funny and lovely this community is, you BTL heroes. They said 
it couldn’t happen on the internet. We proved it can, as long as you hide the 
destination url, so it’s occasionally difficult to find!
 
“If at first you don’t succeed, try another two times so that your failure is 
statistically significant”. Aratan this is magnificent, 
nihilistic-statistician’s advice. I like.

I’m gonna miss you people very much. I’ll just chuck that on the GBBO sadness 
pile, which is already towering.
 
Smart move BBC, hooking us with that Sherlock trailer. Just when you thought 
you could have a little break from TV. Val as Moriarty is inspired, HCollider. 
Also you’ve been to a royal garden party? Did you steal anything?
 
You’re right AngerDiscussed, I would way rather watch Selasi on a motorbike 
than Ewan McGregor, running over salmon in Yemen.
 
Jane and Candice are going on a baking road trip! Ahh! Why? What even is that? 
I hope their rooms are on different floors.

I read a Sherlock Holmes story where a dude killed another dude by feeding a 
little snake through the air vent. I’m just saying that, apropos of nothing.
 
Val in Ayia Napa! I cannot deal.
