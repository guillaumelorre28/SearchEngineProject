Nixon built an underground bowling alley 
<http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/bowling-alley.htm>, Ford added an 
outdoor swimming pool <http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/grounds/pool.htm>, while 
Obamainstalled basketball hoops 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/interactive-tour/basketball-court> on Bush’s tennis 
court. But the White House preservation committee must be trembling with 
trepidation at what real-estate tycoon and voracious builder Donald Trump plans 
to unleash on his new Washington DC home.

Since Thomas Jefferson replaced the outdoor privy with modern flushing loos, 
and commissioned Benjamin Latrobe to smarten up the humble house withrows of 
classical colonnades <http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/residence.htm>, it has 
been the done thing for the incoming first family to make their mark on the 
president’s official residence.


Jackie Kennedy set the tone for the first lady’s role as homemaker to the 
nation,masterminding a comprehensive renovation 
<https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/The-White-House-Restoration.aspx>
 of the White House in 1961. She enlisted famed socialite decorator Sister 
Parish and French designer Stéphane Boudin to fill the house with antique 
wallpaper panels and swagged drapery, wrought with a stage-set theatricality 
that climaxed in her blue silk dressing room, replete with a button-tufted 
chaise longue and leopard skin throw.

From the Kennedys onwards, the White House became a public stage for the first 
family to construct their identity, and on which an ideal domesticity would be 
played out. Nancy Reagan enlisted Beverly Hills interior designerTed Graber 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/12/us/ted-graber-80-decorator-for-reagans-dies.html>
 to deliver a dose of 1980s Hollywood glamour, filling the dressing room with 
peachy floral fabrics, swamping her office in a symphony of pistachio and 
lining the bedroom walls with hand-painted chinoiserie wallpaper.

Laura Bush brought in Ken Blasingame

designer of the Bush’s Texan ranches, to install lavish hand-blocked wallpaper 
and marble chimneypieces, while the Obamas have been ascool and restrained 
<http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/obama-white-house> as you might 
expect. They replaced Bush’s loud sunburst carpet in the Oval Office with a 
simple cream affair and filled the house with an unprecedented array of modern 
and contemporary art, hanging paintings byJosef Albers

So what treats might Donald and Melania have in store? A peek inside their 
three-storey, 53-room penthouse 
<http://www.idesignarch.com/inside-donald-and-melania-trumps-manhattan-apartment-mansion/>
 home at the top of Trump Tower suggests the dial will be turned back a few 
centuries – and that, along withramping up coal extraction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/trumps-economic-policies-protectionism-low-taxes-and-coal-mines>
, they might have to reopen the gold mines.

Ceilings heave with gilded mouldings, chandeliers groan with torrents of 
crystal, a weight of opulence supported by forests of fluted marble columns 
topped with gilded Corinthian capitals. Every surface is embellished and 
encrusted, from ceiling paintings depicting scenes from Greek mythology to the 
velvet cushions emblazoned with the Trump coat of arms. A fountain cascades in 
front of a back-lit wall of onyx, while a bronze Eros and Psyche cavort on the 
coffee table; Greek vases teeter on the mantlepiece, above a miniature 
Mercedes, in which his 10-year-old son Barron can roam around this mini 
Versailles. It makes Liberace look like a minimalist.

It is the gaudy concoction of the late American decorator Angelo Donghia 
<http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/donald-trump-1985-apartment-looks-exactly-how-youd-imagine-it>
 – aka “the Saint Laurent of sofas” – purveyor of gilded fantasies to the 
stars, from Ralph Lauren to Liza Minnelli. With Donghia gone, Trump might do 
well to consult Peter York’s bookDictator’s Homes 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dictators-Homes-Lifestyles-Colourful-Despots/dp/184354430X>
, a manual of oligarch chic.

Or perhaps he will take inspiration from his own Florida palace, Mar-a-Lago 
<http://www.maralagoclub.com/>, the most extravagant of the jazz age mansions 
in Palm Beach, which he bought in 1985. With 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms and a 
15-metre (50ft) dining room with a pietra dura marble table (as well as three 
handy bomb shelters), it reads like an encyclopedia of interior decor, moving 
from perpendicular gothic to American federal to a bedroom with hand-painted 
fairytale scenes. A portrait of Trump in a tennis sweater hangs over the bar, 
his blond hair billowing beneath a fiery red sky.

DC beware. A fantasyland of terracotta turrets and marble toilets will soon be 
on its way to make the White House great again, no doubt accompanied by a 
20ft-high Trump bolted on the roof.
