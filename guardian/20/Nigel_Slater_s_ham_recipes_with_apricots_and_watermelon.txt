My first thought is always to tear rather than cut. This applies to bread, of 
course, unless you are making toast; mozzarella, peaches, lettuce, scones and 
muffins, smoked salmon, roast chicken, cold ham, but not beef, which is far 
more tempting in softly undulating, rose-pink folds. There is a casual 
generosity in large, jagged pieces pulled apart by hand that you don’t get when 
something is thinly sliced or tortured into cubes. Soft edges, gently torn, 
feel easy and relaxed.

And so it was with the ham salad I made this week, the meat torn roughly into 
frayed shards and tossed with ripe fruit. I used watermelon, whose sweet, cool 
juice is so refreshing with the salty quality of cured meat, but I could have 
used slices of cantaloupe or honeydew, nectarines or mango. (Never try to tear 
a mango, by the way.)

I used a yogurt dressing, flecked with shredded basil leaves and stirred 
through with a little olive oil. The herb’s pepperiness is just the thing for 
watermelon. This is a dressing that also works with cold chicken, steamed 
asparagus, potato salad or as an accompaniment for a summer vegetable curry. I 
make it in a screw-top jar by the old-fashioned shaking method, and it will 
keep, refrigerated, for a couple of days.

But hang on, there’s a fat lump of gammon first, simmered with bay, 
peppercorns and aniseed, glazed with apricots and marmalade and passed round 
the table in thick, juicy pieces. The salad is our treat for tomorrow.

Glazed ham with apricots

Serves 6
gammon joint 1.5kg, rolled and tied 
black peppercorns 12
star anise 3
cloves 4
bay leaves 4
onion 1, medium
celery 1 rib


For the glaze:
apricots 500g
water 600ml
lemon 1
caster sugar 60g
marmalade 3 tbsp


Put the joint of meat into a large, deep saucepan. Pour in enough cold water 
to cover the meat by a third, then add the star anise, cloves and peppercorns 
and then the bay, crushing the leaves as you go. Peel the onion and halve it, 
then tuck it in with the meat. Chop the celery rib in two or three short pieces 
and add them to the pot.

Place the pan over a moderate heat and bring the water to the boil. Skim and 
discard any froth that rises to the surface, partially cover the pan with a 
lid, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer, the stock giving a mellow 
blip-blop.

Leave the ham to cook, turning it over occasionally in the quietly bubbling 
stock, for 90 minutes then turn off the heat.

Meanwhile, halve the apricots and discard their stones. Put the fruit in a 
saucepan and pour in the water. Cut two or three long strips of peel from the 
lemon and drop them into the water together with the juice of the lemon and the 
sugar.

Bring the water to the boil then lower the heat and let the apricots simmer 
for about 10 minutes until just soft enough to crush. Remove the pan from the 
heat and set aside. Crush half of the apricots to a coarse purée using a fork 
or the back of a spoon, then stir in the marmalade.

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Carefully remove the meat from the cooking 
liquor and lower it into a roasting tin. Place half of the apricots around the 
joint of meat, together with a few tablespoons of the cooking liquor to keep 
them moist during cooking.

Spread the purée over the top of the ham (some of it will inevitably slide off 
into the roasting tin). Place the ham in the oven until the apricots are 
totally soft and the glaze is starting to brown lightly in places.

Remove the roasting tin from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for 
10 minutes. Carve the meat thinly, then serve it with the apricots that have 
cooked around it.

 Tear it up: Nigel Slater’s salad of ham, watermelon and basil recipe.

The best way to store leftover ham is to wrap the cool meat loosely in 
clingfilm and refrigerate it, remembering to bring it out a good hour before 
serving. Keep the pieces large enough that they need to be cut with a knife and 
fork, they will be juicier that way.

Serves 2-3
cooked ham 350g
watermelon 500ml
watercress a handful


For the basil dressing:
natural yogurt 250g
white wine vinegar 2 tsp
olive oil 100ml
basil leaves 10g


Put the yogurt into a large glass jar, add the white wine vinegar and the 
olive oil. Shred the basil leaves with a knife or by tearing them, then put 
them in the jar with a little salt and black pepper. Tighten the lid and shake 
the jar vigorously for a few seconds until all the ingredients are fully 
combined and you have a smooth, silky dressing.

Tear the ham into large, irregular pieces and put the pieces in a serving 
dish. Peel the watermelon, cut the flesh into large pieces, removing the seeds 
as you go. Add the watermelon to the ham. Wash the watercress, removing any 
tough stalks, then combine with the ham and watermelon. Toss briefly with the 
basil dressing, or spoon it over the salad, as you wish.
