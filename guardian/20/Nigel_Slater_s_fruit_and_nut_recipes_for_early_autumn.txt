The weather has cooled, the garden is turning gold and there are nuts toasting 
in the kitchen. This cook couldn’t be happier. In the last few days alone I 
have made a simple pine kernel and sausage stuffing for roast birds; given deep 
roasted flavours to soft chocolate cookies; added crunch to tender root 
vegetables and made an addictive honey and nut butter for spreading on toast. 
What all these dishes celebrate is our love of seasonal hazelnuts and apples, 
pine kernels and figs, almonds and pistachios. The universal marriage of fruit 
and nut.

Roast quail with pine kernels and figs

I can eat two roast quail at a sitting, but if they are accompanied by crunchy 
sausagemeat balls and softly seedy baked figs then I am happy with just one. I 
suggest you start with a knife and fork, then attack the roasted birds with 
your hands, tearing and gnawing at the bones to your heart’s content. The legs, 
by the way, are delectable.


Serves 6
quail 6, oven ready
olive oil 2-3 tbsp
sausages 400g
pine kernels 50g
shallot 1 large
olive oil a little
butter 75g
sage leaves 6
figs 6
thyme sprigs 8

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Lightly brown the quails in a little olive 
oil in a shallow pan. Turn them regularly with kitchen tongs.


Split the sausages and discard the skins, dropping the meat into a mixing 
bowl. In a shallow pan, toast the pine kernels then chop them roughly and add 
to the sausage meat. Peel and finely chop the shallot, then cook it in a little 
oil, or some of the butter, in the shallow pan till pale and translucent. 
Finely chop the sage leaves. Add the shallot and sage to the sausagemeat, mix 
thoroughly, then roll into 12 small balls.

Warm a little more oil in the pan then brown the balls over a moderate heat. 
Season the quails with salt and pepper and arrange them, with space around 
them, in a roasting tin. Tuck the balls among the quail along with the figs, 
split open and squeezed at the base so they open up and reveal their seeds.

Dot the quail with a little more of the butter and moisten with a trickle of 
oil. Scatter a few thyme sprigs among the birds and roast for 25-30 minutes, 
till the birds are lightly browned and firm to the touch. Serve a quail, a fig 
and a couple of stuffing balls per person.

A simple way to spice up a dish of cheap roast root vegetables. Ras el hanout 
with its gentle, fragrant mix of cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and rose petals is 
available from most supermarkets, in the spice section.


Serves 4 as a side dish
carrots 500g
beetroots 500g, small
large spring onions or banana shallots 6
groundnut oil 3 tbsp
thyme 8 sprigs

For the dressing
flaked almonds 3 tbsp
walnut oil 2 tbsp
ras el hanout 2 tsp
yogurt 200ml

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Scrub the carrots then cook them for 8-10 
minutes in boiling water. Drain and place them in a large roasting dish. Trim 
the beetroots, scrub them, then boil for 10 minutes. Cut the beetroot in half 
or into quarters depending on their size and add them to the carrots. Halve the 
spring onions lengthways then put them in the roasting dish with the oil, thyme 
sprigs and salt and pepper. (If using shallots peel and halve them.) Toss the 
vegetables together gently to coat them in the oil and seasonings.


Roast the vegetables for 25-30 minutes till golden and lightly toasted, then 
remove from the oven and transfer to a serving dish. Pour any excess oil from 
the roasting dish, add the flaked almonds and place over a low heat. Stir in 
the walnut oil and the ras el hanout and cook for a minute or so, till the 
almonds are golden, watching carefully. Turn off the heat, stir in the yogurt 
then trickle over the roast vegetables.

Some wonderful textures going on here. The mixture of toothsome meat and its 
chewy fat, soft ripe plums, crunchy pistachios and soothing rice is thoroughly 
pleasing. A value for money dish too, despite the pistachios.


Serves 4
pork belly 800g, boned and skinned weight
olive oil 3 tbsp
fennel seeds 2 tbsp
smoked garlic a head
plums 400g
pistachios 100g
sesame seeds 2 tbsp, black or white

For the rice
white basmati rice 200g
water 200ml
bay leaves 3
cinnamon stick ½
cumin seeds 1 tsp
cloves 4
black peppercorns 6

Slice the pork belly into 4cm thick strips and put them into a roasting tin. 
Pour over the olive oil, add the fennel seed and a grinding of sea salt and 
pepper and toss everything together. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Tuck the whole head of garlic, unbroken, among the pork and roast for an hour, 
turning the meat once or twice.

Wash the rice in a bowl of cold water, swirling the grains round with your 
fingers. (I repeat this with fresh water, three times, but once is probably 
enough.) Tip the rice into a small saucepan and pour in the 200ml of water. Add 
the bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cumin seeds, cloves and peppercorns. Add half a 
teaspoon of salt and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down, cover tightly with 
a lid and leave to putter away for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat but do not 
remove the lid.

Halve and stone the plums, cut them into quarters and put them in a bowl. Tear 
or slice the pieces of pork into short pieces and add them to the plums. Pop 
the golden cloves of garlic from their papery skins. Add the pistachios, 
chopped if you wish, the whole cloves of sweet roasted garlic and the sesame 
seeds. Run a fork through the rice to separate the grains, discard the cinnamon 
stick then fold into the plums and pork.

Pour most of the fat from the roasting tin, leaving behind just a couple of 
tablespoons and the sticky bits in the roasting tin, then place the tin over a 
moderate heat. Tip the rice and plums into the roasting tin and stir gently, 
turning everything over with a wooden spoon, coating the rice in the cooking 
juices for the tin. Serve on warm plates.

A treat. There are perfectly good cashew butters available in wholefood shops, 
but I like to make my own using roasted, salted nuts and honey. Sweet and 
nuttily salty, it is something for your breakfast toast too. You may find your 
apples sweet enough to allow you to dispense with the sugar.


Enough for 4
blueberries 150g
water 3 tbsp
golden caster sugar 2 tbsp
brioche 4 thick slices

For the nut butter
cashew nuts 130g salted and roasted
liquid honey 1 tbsp
walnut oil 1 tbsp

For the apples
apples 2 medium
butter a thick slice
golden caster sugar 1 tbsp (optional)

Put the blueberries into a small saucepan, add the water and sugar and bring 
to the boil. Lower the heat and leave for 5 minutes or until the berries burst 
and the juice turns deep purple. Set aside.

For the nut butter, put the roasted cashews in the bowl of a food processor 
and blend to very fine crumbs, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula as 
the nuts get nearer to a paste. Add the honey and walnut oil and briefly mix to 
a smooth, spreadable paste.

Halve and quarter the apples, remove their cores then cut into thick segments. 
Warm the butter in a shallow pan, add the apples, then, if you think they need 
it, sprinkle with a thin layer of sugar (very sweet dessert apples will need 
little or none). Let the sugar and butter dissolve into a caramel, turning the 
apple slices with a spatula as they become golden and soft.

Toast the brioche lightly on both sides then spread with the cashew and honey 
butter. Place the apples on top of the brioche, spoon over the caramel then 
trickle the blueberries over the top.

 Cardamom, chocolate and hazelnut cookies. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the 
Observer 
Crunchy chocolate nut cookies, crisp around the edges, soft within. The trick 
is not to over-bake them. They should still be soft and pale when you remove 
them from the oven. Don’t be tempted to smooth the dough as you put them onto 
the baking sheet; no one wants a uniform, characterless cookie.


Makes 12-16 cookies
butter 100g
caster sugar 120g
light muscovado sugar 75g
skinned hazelnuts 100g
cashews 100g, roasted and salted
dark chocolate 200g
green cardamom about 12 pods
egg 1
vanilla extract ½ tsp
salt ½ tsp
plain flour 175g
baking powder ½ tsp

Beat together the butter and sugars till soft and creamy. Set the oven at 
180C/gas mark 4. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment (preferably two 
sheets, if you have them, so you can cook the biscuits in quick succession).

Toast the hazelnuts in a dry, shallow pan till golden, shaking them regularly 
to brown evenly. Reduce half of them to coarse crumbs in a food processor or 
with a large kitchen knife. Cut the remaining nuts in half and set aside. 
Roughly chop the cashews and break the chocolate into small pieces. Crack open 
the cardamom pods and grind the seeds inside to give a full teaspoon of coarse 
powder. I find a pestle and mortar invaluable here, but you could use the end 
of a rolling pin.

Break the egg into a bowl, mix lightly with a fork then, with the beater still 
turning, add to the butter and sugar. Mix in the vanilla extract and salt. 
Combine the flour and baking powder and, lowering the speed of the mixer, fold 
into the batter. Add the chopped chocolate, ground cardamom and chopped 
hazelnuts and half the cashews.

Place heaped tablespoons of the mixture on the baking sheets, giving them room 
to spread. Press the reserved nuts into the surface. Bake for about 17 minutes 
(check after 15), removing them when they are pale gold and still soft. Leave 
for three or four minutes to settle, then transfer to a cooling rack. Best 
eaten warm, but they will keep for several days in a biscuit tin.
