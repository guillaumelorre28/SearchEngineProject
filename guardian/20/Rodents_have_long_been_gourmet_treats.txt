How dare you call coypus “rats” (Waiter, there’s a rat in my burger: rodent on 
the menu in Moscow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/hot-rat-is-so-hot-right-now-moscow-falls-for-the-rodent-burger>
, 19 November). I have fond memories of a scientific conference at London Zoo 
on “introduced mammals”. Coypu was served for lunch in the Fellows’ restaurant 
and was excellent. The Russian delegates could not understand the Brits’ huge 
(and ultimately successful) campaign to eliminate our coypus. Why did we not 
eat more of them?

Rodents (not rats) have long been gourmet items: Romans fattened edible 
dormice, guinea pigs (close coypu relatives) are popular in South America and 
wartime GIs would pay well for a grey squirrel for the pot. I was pleased to 
see that you can now buy grey squirrel meat online in the UK.
