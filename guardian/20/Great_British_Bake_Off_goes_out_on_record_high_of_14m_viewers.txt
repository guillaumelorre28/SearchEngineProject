The Great British Bake Off 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off> ended its 
run on the BBC with 14 million viewers, a record for the show and the 
most-watched programme of the year so far.

More than half of the viewing public tuned in to see Candice Brown win the 
Bake Off crown

 with a series of bakes including a 49-piece royal picnic that judge Mary Berry 
called “an absolute humdinger of a showstopper”. At it’s peak 14.8 million 
viewers tuned in.

Brown’s victory eclipsed last year’s final when an average audience of 13.4 
million tuned in to watch Nadiya Hussain. That episode ended up as the 
most-watched programme of 2015.

This year’s Bake Off final also beat England’s appearances in Euro 2016, which 
peaked with 13.8 million viewers for the goalless draw to Slovakia

.

The final was the last episode of the main Bake Off series to appear on the 
BBC after its makers Love Productions struck a £75m three-year deal to take the 
series to Channel 4. Presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, as well as Berry, 
have said they will not follow the programme to the commercial broadcaster, 
with only Berry’s fellow judge Paul Hollywood committing to the next series.

However, there are still two BBC festive specials to come starring all four, 
as well as Junior Bake Off next month in which Hussain will be a judge.

BBC director of content Charlotte Moore said: “BBC1 brought over half of the 
British viewing public together to watch the final of The Great British Bake 
Off, delivering the highest ever ratings! Congratulations to Candice and the 
Bake Off team, and a big thank you to all the loyal fans over the last seven 
series.”
