Mixu Paatelainen is the new head coach of Dundee United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited>, who are struggling at the 
bottom of the Scottish Premiership. The former United striker is a member of 
the club’s hall of fame, having scored 47 goals in 173 appearances during his 
five-year spell between 1987 and 1992.

The 48-year-old, who has signed a contract until 2018, was in charge of 
Finland for four years and has also managed Kilmarnock, Hibernian and 
Cowdenbeath.

Dundee United’s chairman, Stephen Thompson, told the club’s website: “I am 
delighted to welcome Mixu back to the club as our new head coach. He served 
United with distinction as a player and will do the same as a manager. His 
desire to come back to the club was clear from the first minute we spoke. He 
was the first person we spoke to and also the last.

“His experience combined with his vision and enthusiasm for the club made him 
the standout candidate and we are thrilled to announce his appointment.”

Paatelainen, who succeeds Jackie McNamara
