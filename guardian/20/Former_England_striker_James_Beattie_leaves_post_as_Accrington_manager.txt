Accrington have announced manager James Beattie has left the club.

The former Everton and Southampton striker, who earned five England caps 
during his career, took his first job in management at the Store First Stadium 
in May 2013.

Despite failing to win any of his first 12 league games in charge of Stanley, 
he earned acclaim for keeping the club in the Football League last season and 
was heavily linked with the vacancy at Oxford United towards the end of that 
campaign.

Although they had started the new season in similarly poor fashion, last 
weekend’s 3-2 victory over Tranmere took them out of the bottom two inLeague Two

However, in an announcement on Friday night, Accrington confirmed Beattie’s 
tenure would be ending with immediate effect.

“It is with a hugely heavy heart that I decided to end this journey,” Beattie 
said in a statement. “I can never fully repay the faith and backing I got from 
the players, my staff and of course the fans – who always gave me 100%.

“I thank them from the bottom of my heart for granting me the opportunity and 
privilege to be part of your unique club.”

The job Beattie did in keeping one of the smaller clubs in the Football League 
last year will not have gone unnoticed by other chairmen hoping to fill 
vacancies.

Carlisle, Blackpool and Leeds are currently searching for new managers and the 
fact Beattie’s statement indicated it was his decision to depart suggests he 
may not be out of work for long.

Assistant manager Paul Stephenson will take charge of Accrington’s League Two 
game against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.
