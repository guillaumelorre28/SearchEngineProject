The Atalanta <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atalanta> forward Germán 
Denis has been banned for five matches after he burst into the changing room of 
their opponents, Empoli, after Sunday’s Serie A match and punched defender 
Lorenzo Tonelli.

Serie A’s disciplinary tribunal also gave Tonelli a one-match ban for saying 
he would kill the Argentinian player shortly before the incident.

“After the match, while still on the playing field, Empoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/empoli> player Tonelli directed at Denis 
the seriously intimidating phrase ‘I will kill you and your family’,” the 
tribunal said in a statement.

“A few minutes later Denis, together with a team-mate, went into the Empoli 
dressing-room and, as soon as Tonelli approached, hit him with a violent punch 
in the face.

“After evaluating the severity of such violent conduct, which was totally out 
of order with any competitive context, Germán Denis is suspended for five 
games, effective immediately.”

Denis, nicknamed The Tank, scored an equaliser in the third minute of 
injury-time to give Atalanta a 2-2 draw in a match between two teams who are 
just outside the relegation zone.

The suspension means that Denis, Atalanta’s top scorer with eight goals, will 
not be available until the last game of the season.
