We may not have the proudest culinary history on the planet, but if there’s 
one thing the British Isles does well, it’s potato crisps. No other nation can 
boast such a dazzling kaleidoscope of options 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/british-crisps-chips-flavors-walkers-tayto.html>
. Few of us would turn down a hand-cut heirloom variety, fried in Spanish olive 
oil and seasoned with a pinch of Himalayan pink salt, yet, deep down, we’re all 
partial to a cheese and onion Hula Hoop, too. Roast beef and mustard, stilton 
and port, Marmite, haggis and pepper … you name it, we’ve made crisps out of it 
<http://www.crispnation.com/the-crisp-list.html>. Or, at least, crisps 
pretending to taste a bit like it.

I’m not claiming you can, or indeed should, ever try to recreate such rarefied 
gourmet delights at home – but a freshly fried potato crisp is the one flavour 
you can’t get over the counter. It’s hard to beat a bag of ready salted for 
soaking up a pint, but if you want something to savour, make your own. But, be 
warned, it’s a slippery slope.

There is surprisingly little disagreement on the optimum potato to use for 
crisps. American recipes universally recommend russets, which you don’t see 
much here, while Kerstin Rodgers, AKA Ms Marmite Lover 
<http://www.msmarmitelover.com/2012/01/how-to-make-your-own-crisps.html>, 
suggests “good frying potatoes”. The chef Shaun Rankin 
<http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/homemade-crisps-recipe> calls for 
maris pipers, which is my idea of a good frying potato, being fluffy enough to 
please and sturdy enough to keep its shape in the fryer. Maris pipers it is, 
although king edwards, arran victories, roosters or the purple violetta 
<http://www.lovepotatoes.co.uk/varieties/fluffy-potatoes/> would also do.

Rankin, as befits a man at the helm of a Michelin-starred restaurant, peels 
potatoes to make crisps. This is a waste of both time and flavour, as far as 
I’m concerned, so I’m not going to bother.

Most recipes agree the potatoes should be sliced “as thinly as possible”, as 
Rodgers has it.Martha Stewart <http://www.apple.com> goes for a 1/8” or 6mm 
cut, which looks distinctly chunky beside J Kenji López-Alt 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-food-lab-extra-crunchy-homemade-potato-ch.html>
’s 3mm versions: “thin enough that they [don’t] come off as tough, but thick 
enough to add some real heft and weight to the crunch”. Any slimmer, and they 
shatter too easily in the mouth; any thicker, and they cook too slowly to crisp 
up properly before burning.

bit of a faff. As Vice’s Munchies

So far, so harmonious. Where my recipes differ is in their treatment of the 
potatoes after slicing but before cooking. Most make some attempt to bring down 
the starch content of the spuds so they don’t brown too quickly in the oil and 
burn before they’ve crisped up, as happens with Rankin’s recipe.

To this end, Rodgers simply soaks them for a couple of hours; Munchies washes 
them in three changes of water, “jiggling them around a bit”, then soaks them 
for 30 minutes; and Bon Appetit magazine <http://www.apple.com> rinses them 
until the water runs clear, then steeps them in a mixture of white vinegar and 
water for between 30 minutes and two hours. López-Alt, meanwhile, briefly cooks 
the slices in a pan of boiling, acidulated water instead, on the basis that 
“heating up starch granules in the presence of water causes them to absorb 
water and expand. Eventually, like little water balloons, they burst, expelling 
the starch into the water where it can be safely dumped down the drain.” The 
acid in the vinegar, he says, will slow down the breakdown of pectin in the 
potato, preventing the slices disintegrating in the process.

López-Alt has clearly, as ever, done his homework on this, but to be frank, 
even after eating my weight in crisps, I find it hard to decide which approach 
works best. As long as you get rid of as much starch as possible, you can’t go 
wrong. I do find, however, that López-Alt’s blanched slices, although they cook 
more evenly than the others, seem to take longer to crisp up, possibly because 
they don’t absorb oil as quickly. It’s also slightly less of a faff to soak the 
slices rather than blanch them, which is all I need to be sold on that 
particular idea. I do wonder, however, whether American tastes in crisps may 
differ from mine. I like a little bit of browning, whereas he chases a “thin, 
crisp, pale yellow, super-salty” ideal – “fundamentally, a chip should not be 
any sort of brown, nor the flavors that come with it”. If you like that idea, 
check out his recipe

There are no two ways about it: crisps need to be fried. Stewart bakes hers, 
and they’re nicer than any of my tasters expect, but sturdy rather than light, 
and hard rather than crunchy. The temperature is paramount. Rodgers suggests 
90C/194F, which I find too low; maybe I’m impatient, but turning up the heat 
gives quicker, better results, though Rankin’s 170C/338F seems a little 
excessive. López-Alt’s 160C/320F is a happy compromise: hot enough to cook the 
chips through before they absorb too much oil; cool enough not to turn them 
into burnt offerings. You can use whatever heat-safe oil takes your fancy, 
although I favour something neutral to bring out the flavour of the potato.

Season while they’re still hot, with Stewart’s cayenne, black pepper, smoked 
paprika … or just salt. Save the fancy stuff for the pub.

(Makes 1 big bowl)
1kg maris pipers or similar potatoes
Neutral oil, to fry
Salt or other seasoning

Slice the potatoes about 3mm thick and put in a large bowl. Rinse in cold 
water until the water runs clear, then soak for 30 minutes.


Heat a large, deep pan about a third full with oil to 160C/320F. Meanwhile, 
drain the potatoes and dry very well with kitchen towels.

Fry in batches (they will take longer if you overcrowd the pan), stirring as 
you first add them, until golden and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and season 
lightly. Eat immediately, or allow to cool, then store in an airtight container 
(they should be good for 24 hours or so).

Crisps: does anyone make them better than the British and Irish, and what are 
your favourite varieties from home or abroad? And would you bother to make your 
own?
