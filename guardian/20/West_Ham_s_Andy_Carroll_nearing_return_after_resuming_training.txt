The West Ham United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> 
striker Andy Carroll is closing in on a Premier League return after he trained 
with the club’s first-team squad on Tuesday.

Carroll has been on the sidelines since February  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/13/west-ham-andy-carroll-miss-rest-of-season>
after undergoing knee surgery and has been eased back into training with the 
Hammers’ Under-21 squad in recent weeks.

A statement on West Ham’s official website said: “Andy Carroll trained with 
the first-team squad on Tuesday and he will continue to do so as he continues 
to build up his match fitness ahead of a competitive return to action.”

The 26-year-old could now be in contention to face former clubs Liverpool on 
29 August or Newcastle on 14 September.
