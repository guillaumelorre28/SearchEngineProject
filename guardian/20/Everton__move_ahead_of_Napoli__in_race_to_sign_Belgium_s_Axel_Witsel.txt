Everton are rumoured to have submitted a £28.5m bid to Zenit St Petersburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg> for Witsel, who 
started all of Belgium’s matches at Euro 2016 including the quarter-final 
defeat to Wales. The 27-year-old is also reported to have been offered a 
£120,000 salary in a bid to persuade him to move to Goodison Park and reject an 
approach from the Serie A side Napoli.

“Axel is currently further away from Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli>,” Francesco Marseglia said on 
Radio Crc on Tuesday.

“The offer wasn’t really given a lot of consideration. Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> might even go above €4m net in 
salary.

“If you look at the financial aspect, that’s the right move, but in terms of 
career I’d choose Napoli every time, even putting the Champions League to one 
side.

“Napoli are an ambitious club, they’re growing every year, always taking more 
important players. Everton don’t seem like a great team.

“I don’t know exactly what the situation is, in my opinion he wants to take 
his time because he’s not yet convinced about what to do. He can either accept 
the English club or wait for an even bigger club.”

Koeman has made the signing of Witsel a priority

 since he was confirmed as Everton’s new manager last month.
