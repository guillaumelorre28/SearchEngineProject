Portsmouth have parted company with manager Andy Awford with four games left 
of another disappointing season.Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Morecambe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2015/apr/11/morecambe-v-portsmouth> 
meant Pompey have won just twice in their last 10 matches in League Two.

Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> say the decision 
was made by mutual consent, and that the 42-year-old former Pompey defender 
could yet stay on at the club in another capacity.Awford’s assistant Gary 
Waddock has been placed in caretaker charge until the end of the season.

A club statement read: “Portsmouth Football Club announce that Andy Awford has 
left his role as first-team manager by mutual consent.After a meeting on Monday 
morning with chairman Iain McInnes and chief executive Mark Catlin, the 
decision was taken for him to step down with immediate effect.

“The club would like to place on record their sincere thanks for Andy’s 
efforts – his service to Pompey is immeasurable.All parties have agreed that, 
after a natural break, further conversations will take place about the 
potential of Andy playing a further role within the football club.”

Portsmouth were among the pre-season promotion favourites again but are 
currently 14th and destined to spend a third year in the basement division.

Awford was appointed permanent Pompey manager in May last year after a 
successful spell as caretakerfollowing Richie Barker’s dismissal

 – he won his first five matches in charge to guide the club away from 
relegation trouble.

But this season has not gone to plan and now Waddock is set to take charge for 
the first time when Pompey head to Stevenage on Tuesday night.
