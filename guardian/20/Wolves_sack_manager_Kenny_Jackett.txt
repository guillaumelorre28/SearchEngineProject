Wolves have terminated the contract of their manager, Kenny Jackett, with 
immediate effect, bringing to an end his three-year spell in charge a week 
before the newChampionship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> 
season starts.

A statement released at 11pm on Friday night said that the new “main Wolves 
director”, Jeff Shi, had made the decision to relieve Jackett of his duties 
following discussions over the past few days.

Shi is quoted as saying: “I would like to sincerely thank Kenny for everything 
he’s done for Wolves over the last three years.

“He’s shown true professionalism during his tenure and over the course of the 
transition to new ownership. I would like to wish him all the very best for the 
future.”

The decision comes four days after the club said Jackett’s position was not 
under threat. The takeover of Wolverhampton Wanderers by the group fronted by 
Shi, Fosun International,was completed last week
