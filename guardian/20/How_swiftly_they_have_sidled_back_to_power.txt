An article in Saturday’s Review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/rudyard-kipling-unexpected-revival-150-years-after-birth>
 (26 December) quoted Rudyard Kipling’s lines about those responsible for a 
military disaster in the first world war: “When the storm is ended shall we 
find / How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power / By the 
favour and contrivance of their kind?” I closed my eyes and thought about the 
bankers and then I thought about half the cabinet in attendance at Rupert 
Murdoch’s Christmas party (for a few dozen friends) with Rebekah Brooks holding 
court. Now tell me, oh wise one, who was Sahib Leveson?

• The wonderful All Aboard! The Sleigh Ride (Watch this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/24/christmas-tv-what-to-watch-from-christmas-eve-until-new-years-eve>
, 24 December) left us with many unanswered questions. What was in the brown 
container on the first sleigh? Where did the fisherman live? At the stopover, 
what was the drink? We have been asking each other these questions and others 
from the first viewing, the second viewing instead of answering them caused 
even more. The best programme this Christmas.

• I fear that David Buckley’s memory is playing tricks (Letters, 26 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/24/farewell-to-mens-footballs-annus-horribilis>
). Impressive though it was, it took Northampton 10 seasons to go up and down 
the divisions. Bristol City did the job properly, plunging from the first to 
fourth division in successive seasons in the early eighties. I know these 
things. As a lifelong Luton Town supporter and a member of Gloucestershire 
County Cricket Club I have become the world’s leading authority on relegation.

• In my mid-1970s Scottish comprehensive, we informed our classmates that we 
thought they were talking nonsense by pulling on our imaginary beards and 
murmuring “chin chin, chin chin” (Letters, 26 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/24/farewell-to-mens-footballs-annus-horribilis>
). Nobody mentioned Jimmy Hill, but that was who we meant.
