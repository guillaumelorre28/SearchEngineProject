Shakespeare Trilogy 
King’s Cross theatre, London

Phyllida Lloyd’s wonderfully spare and engagingly rowdy productions of Julius 
Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, set in a women’s prison and performed by an 
all-female cast lead by a magnificent Harriet Walter, were remarkable by any 
standards. The reinvention illuminates the plays in surprising, sometimes 
heartbreaking, ways.

The productions have an extraordinary ability both to completely make you 
forget that you are watching an all-female cast and yet also subtly refocus 
Shakespeare through the framing device, with the prisoners performing the 
dramas and working through their own issues in the process. Children’s toys are 
brought into play throughout, both hinting at the family lives these women have 
lost through incarceration and reminding of the ways that boys love to play 
with the toys when it comes to war.

One production or even a trilogy cannot singlehandedly transform the world, 
particularly a theatre world still so oddly hesitant about fully embracing 
diversity. But Lloyd’s production and the depth and breadth of talent displayed 
– in a cast of different ages, shapes and skin colours – means that never again 
will anyone be able to sneer that the girls aren’t up to the job when it comes 
to Shakespeare. There are no weak links in a cast who play each and every 
character with thrilling distinctiveness and a mix of delicate emotion and 
joyous swagger. It’s a game-changer and should be held up as one of the moments 
when British theatre realised that diversity isn’t a tick-box fad but the 
powerful engine that genuinely drives creativity and invention.Read a full

 Charged … The Hamilton Complex Photograph: Fred Debrock 
Thirteen 13-year-old girls own the stage in a piece devised with director Lies 
Pauwels. They strut, they scream, they dance, they dress up as Little Red 
Riding Hoods, air hostesses and beauty queens as if trying on identities – 
particularly those thrust upon them in a sexualised culture – and discarding 
them. “Are there any paedophiles here today?” one asks, as the others eyeball 
the audience as if waiting to see us flinch. The act of watching becomes 
charged in an hour that is sometimes uncomfortable, often alarming and 
ultimately irresistibly joyous.Read more

 Depths of the mind … Michael Keegan-Dolan’s adaptation Swan Lake / Loch na 
hEala. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP 
Forget Tchaikovsky. Michael Keegan-Dolan draws on Irish and Nordic folk songs 
to create this quite extraordinary piece of dance theatre that relocates the 
dark fairy tale to the Irish Midlands. It’s not just the geographical bogs but 
the depths of the mind that are excavated in a show in which Siegfried becomes 
Jimmy, a depressed loner still living with his mum, and Odette is Finnola, 
whose wings are broken when she is abused by the local priest. Rich, brutal and 
ultimately gloriously redemptive.Read more

 Blistering … Sophie Melville in Iphigenia in Splott. Photograph: National 
Theatre 
I was stupidly late to this party – Gary Owen’s heartbreaking, angry monologue 
was first seen at the Sherman in Cardiff in 2015 – but better late than never. 
Owen cunningly draws us into the story of Effie, challenging our assumptions 
about this hard-drinking, lippy young woman. It’s such a clever, politically 
engaged piece of writing, staged with stylish minimalism by director Rachel 
O’Riordan and boasting one of the most scorching performances of the year. 
Sophie Melville was blistering as the girl who describes herself as a “nasty 
skank” but turns out to know the real price of austerity and personal sacrifice.

 Brave delight … Fevered Sleep’s Men & Girls Dance. Photograph: Karen Robinson 
Fevered Sleep’s almost recklessly brave participatory dance project brings 
together a group of untrained young girls to dance with five trained male 
dancers. The result – which can be seen at the Place in London in April 2017 – 
is an utter delight: sometimes comic, often tender and frequently exuberant. 
But it does something more, asking questions about who trusts who, who holds 
the stage, and who leads and who follows. A show that challenges the idea that 
contact between young girls and adults, particularly adult males, must be 
suspect and which celebrates children and grown-ups playing and dancing 
together with giddy abandon.Read more

 Obsession … Brendan Cowell and Billie Piper in Yerma. Photograph: Johan Persson
This merciless reinvention of Lorca’s 1934 rural tragedy relocated the play to 
contemporary London. As the young journalist and blogger whose apparently 
charmed life turns barren, Billie Piper was mesmerising. Simon Stone’s 
production puts love, vanity and obsession on stage as if within the glass 
walls of a museum showcase, constantly reminding that we all want to leave our 
mark on the world, and that for most of us it’s only through having kids that 
we achieve it.Read a full review

Another show that I missed last year. I arrived with impossibly high 
expectations but every single one was fulfilled in this story of Emma, an actor 
addicted to drink and drugs who is unreliable in every way. Duncan Macmillan’s 
script was intelligent, slippery and very funny, the supporting cast superb, 
and Jeremy Herrin’s production playfully tinkered with our sense of reality. 
Oh, and that performance by Denise Gough It really was as good as everybody 
said – and then some.Read more

 Authentic … Matthew Maher and Jaygann Ayehin The Flick. Photograph: Mark Douet 
Few plays this year were as touching or thoughtful as Annie Baker’s play about 
the low-paid workers in a failing Massachusetts movie house that is being left 
behind by digital. There was an almost Chekhovian quality to a drama that 
utilised the rhythms of daily life with long passages where nothing appeared to 
happen but everything changes. It played with quicksilver lightness on ideas 
about what is real and authentic in both art and personal relationships.Read

 Uncomfortable … Dyfan Dwyfor, Sean Biggerstaff and Maureen Beattie in Right 
Now. Photograph: Simon Annand 
Some evenings at the theatre make an instant impact, others lurk in your 
unconscious and won’t go away. Catherine-Anne Toupin’s disquieting, 
uncomfortable comedy – inspired by the death of a sibling during her childhood 
– falls into the latter category. There is something uncanny about the way it 
plays mind games in an ever shifting scenario about a couple who move into an 
apartment and soon become embroiled with the neighbours. Nothing is quite what 
it seems and Michael Boyd’s production deftly kept you guessing. I still am.
