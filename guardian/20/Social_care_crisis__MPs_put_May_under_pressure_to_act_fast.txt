Theresa May has come under renewed pressure to take urgent action to tackle 
the crisis in social care, amid growing fears in Westminster that the complex 
task of preparing for Brexit talks is crowding out domestic policy.

The chairs of three of the most influential Commons select committees have 
written to the prime minister, urging her to seek a rapid cross-party consensus 
on the “immense challenge” of paying for health and social care in the future.

Coming as the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, prepares to meet union 
leaders in a bid to prevent the latest in a series of rail strikes, and as
health experts warn of a looming winter crisis

 in the NHS, the strongly worded call underlines the sense that May’s honeymoon 
in No 10 is over.

The letter – sent jointly by the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, of the 
health committee 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/health-committee/>
, the Labour MP Meg Hillier, of thepublic accounts committee 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/>
, and Clive Betts, also a Labour MP, of thecommunities and local government 
committee 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/>
 – underscores fears that pressing issues on the home front are being set aside.

“We are calling for a new political consensus to take this forward,” the 
letter reads. “This needs to be done swiftly so that agreement can be reflected 
in the next spending round.”

The MPs say any review should cover both the health and social care systems, 
warning that separation of the two is “creating difficulties for individuals 
and avoidable barriers and inefficiencies”.

May was accused of failing to grasp the scale of the challenge, after the 
chancellor, Philip Hammond, offered no extra money for social care in hisautumn 
statement in November

. No 10 then hastily announced that local authorities would be able tobring 
forward increases in council tax to meet short-term needs

The prime minister suggested at the time that she would seek a longer-term 
answer, to put social care on a sustainable footing, but has so far said 
nothing about how she will do so.

She was widely regarded as a safe pair of hands when she gained the premiership

 in the wake of the EU referendum.

But ministers and civil servants are still waking up to the magnitude of the 
Brexit task.The resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers

, the UK’s representative in Brussels, this week reinforced growing concerns 
about whether the government is fully prepared for what lies ahead.

A damning editorial in the right-leaning Economist news magazine, which dubbed 
the prime minister “Theresa Maybe” and compared her to former PM Gordon Brown, 
set tongues wagging among MPs.

Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: “Brexit is going to 
overwhelm every government department and we won’t be able to get on with 
anything else. The intellectual energy will go into Brexit, the most ambitious 
civil servants will want to be in the Brexit departments; it will just be the 
focus of everything.”

He claimed May was not “philosophically or intellectually” interested in 
social issues such as elderly care.

The letter from the heads of the three select committees urges May to organise 
a review, “which should begin as soon as possible” and involve all major 
parties, saying that the scale of the challenge means social care will be an 
issue for whichever party is in power over the coming decades.

The letter concludes: “In short, the problem is widely recognised – we now 
need political agreement so that a solution for the long term can be found. For 
our part we shall do what we can to contribute to a consensus. We look forward 
to hearing from you.”

Chris Ham, chief executive of health thinktank The King’s Fund, said a new 
plan for health and social care was “long overdue”.

“For too long there has been a lack of political leadership on these issues,” 
he added. “We agree with the committee chairs that a political consensus that 
puts health and social care funding on a sustainable footing is sorely needed. 
Without a consensus, patients and people in need will suffer.”

The letter was also backed by Izzi Seccombe, who leads on the issue for the 
Local Government Association.

“Following last month’s local government finance settlement, we said there 
needed to be an urgent and fundamental review of social care before the spring 
budget, and we are pleased the select committees back this,” she said.


A government spokeswoman said more had been done under May to integrate health 
and social care than ever before.

“We recognise the pressures of an ageing population, which is why we recently 
announced almost £900m of additional funding for adult social care over the 
next two years,” she said.


“But, as the prime minister has made clear, this is not solely about money. 
That is why we are working to find a long-term, sustainable solution which 
helps local authorities learn from each other to raise standards across the 
whole system.”
