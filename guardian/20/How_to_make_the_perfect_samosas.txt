Samosas have been the victims of a grave injustice. Those deflated triangles 
of cardboard pastry sold in supermarket Indian snack selections bear as much 
resemblance to a flaky, freshly fried samosa as a Krispy Kreme does to a proper 
jam doughnut.

The first time I had the real thing, purchased through the bars of a train 
window on route from Delhi to Gorakhpur junction, was such a revelation that I 
scoffed the entire greasy bagful. As Simon Daley writes, “Once you’ve eaten 
homemade samosas, served fresh and crisp from a karai of crackling hot oil with 
a squeeze of lemon, you’ll never want to touch stodgy, greasy store-bought ones 
again.”

That first homemade samosa is plucked straight from Pandora’s box, however; 
with even many restaurants serving up substandard samosas from the freezer, one 
bite condemns you to a lifetime of making your own. Which isn’t the worst thing 
in the world, I suppose.

Samosas are traditionally made from a fairly sturdy pastry, presumably 
because, like the British pasty, this eminently portable snack was designed to 
travel well – they’re thought to have come to India from Central Asia in the 
saddlebags of Muslim merchants. Most people use plain flour, although Simon 
Daley, author of a book calledCooking with My Indian Mother-in-Law 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YCBJgtUM5qAC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=simon+daley+vegetable+samosas&source=bl&ots=-ffXwGQZ-A&sig=3bc3HaBaGfBPtuB99u3_4upUFnE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMI6u3RlMKVyQIVRkQUCh12TgoV#v=onepage&q=simon%20daley%20vegetable%20samosas&f=false>
, makes his even more robust with strong white flour of the kind used for 
baking.

all work fat into the dough – the first two in the form of vegetable oil; the 
last, butter – while Daley relies on water alone to bring his pastry together, 
which makes his chewier than the others, though not unpleasantly so.

The butter version turns out more like a shortcrust than the crisp, flaky 
pastries produced by the oil, though this may also have something to do with 
the method: Iyer makes hers in the food processor, while Jaffrey and Singh 
gently rub the fat in by hand in the traditional way, which coats the proteins 
with fat while minimising gluten formation. It is then kneaded to partially 
develop the gluten, creating an elastic but still tender shell that is strong 
enough to withstand the pressures of stuffing and deep-frying, but soft enough 
to crumble obligingly in the mouth. With this end in mind, plain flour seems 
the better choice.

Despite Daley’s strict instructions to his readers to “Accept no substitutes!”,
Meera Sodha’s book Made in India 
<http://www.cutoutandkeep.net/projects/beetroot-and-feta-samosas> uses two 
layers of filo pastry, brushed with melted butter, for her “magic triangles”. 
This works surprisingly well, and is wonderfully quick though, as she observes, 
the results are lighter and crisper than the classic version.

Singh works nigella seeds into his pastry, which not only looks smart, but 
tastes delicious.

Samosas come in many forms, but, in a country where 20%-40% of the population 
is vegetarian, the meat-free version is the most popular. Potato tends to form 
the bulk of the filling, usually pre-cooked and mashed, thoughDaley sautes raw 
cubes 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ym_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT323&lpg=PT323&dq=simon+daley+vegetable+samosas&source=bl&ots=nVs2UpWLq1&sig=AC9zcVqmx89QnWPdhZfr-vaRjUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI6u3RlMKVyQIVRkQUCh12TgoV#v=onepage&q=simon%20daley%20vegetable%20samosas&f=false>
 until “tender but still retaining some bite”. This keeps all the ingredients 
separate, but I rather like the contrast between the fluffiness of the mash and 
the crisp pastry.

Everyone uses onion in some form (although not always cooked) and Sodha and 
Daley stick in some garlic, too. Peas are also popular, with Simon Hopkinson 
suggesting that if fresh aren’t in season, “I would prefer marrowfat peas” to 
the frozen variety, although they’re too mushily similar to the potato for my 
liking. Smaller peas add sweetness, too, as does Daley’s carrot and Sodha’s 
beetroot, all of which are a great counterpoint to the spice.

Along with carrot, potato, peas and two sorts of onion, Daley sticks in some 
shredded cabbage, which gives his filling a surprising lightness, as well as a 
pleasing variety my testers prefer to the stodginess of Jaffrey’s 
overwhelmingly potatoey one. Feel free to use whatever ingredients you have to 
hand, while aiming for a variety of textures and flavours; something soft, 
something crunchy, something sweet and something savoury – which, in Sodha and 
Singh’s cases, means cheese.

Sodha uses salty, crumbly feta, and Singh the much milder, creamier paneer, 
which feels the more authentic choice, although I’d recommend salting it first 
to add flavour. The chef also adds rich, crunchy cashew nuts, which, though 
rarely unwelcome, feel like overkill with the cheese, although if you’d prefer 
a vegan recipe, they’re an excellent alternative.

Spicing

However simple you choose to keep your filling, a touch of spice is 
non-negotiable. The sweet heat of ginger and chillies, as deployed by Jaffrey, 
Daley and Singh works well, as does the fresh aromatic flavour of the equally 
popular fresh coriander.

Daley employs the most complex spicing, using mustard seeds, fenugreek, 
asafoetida, curry leaves, turmeric and dried red pepper, plus his 
mother-in-law’s “secret ingredient”: a special masala used solely for samosas – 
“It was with some reluctance and a good deal or persuasion on my part that she 
eventually gave me the details.”

It has cinnamon, cloves, cumin and chilli to thank for its “distinctive scent 
and flavour”, which my testers can’t quite put their finger on – what they do 
know is that they like it. As most of the other recipes use garam masala, which 
tends to contain some of the same ingredients, along with extra chilli and 
cumin, I don’t think my recipe requires much else, and certainly not the sugar 
that Daley and Singh also stir in. A finishing squeeze of lemon juice, however, 
rounds things off nicely.

Shaping the samosas is by far the most complicated element of the whole 
procedure, although one that is mastered fairly quickly. Sodha recommends 
cutting trapeziums and Daley devotes a whole page to his method, which involves 
rolling a stack of pastry rounds together and then heating them to dry them out 
before use. Two pages may have been better for slow learners like me, because I 
find it impossible to separate the rounds after rolling them together – and, in 
any case, the whole thing seems needlessly fiddly when Jaffrey and Singh’s 
semi-circles, rolled into a cone shape before stuffing, work so well.

Sodha, ever the maverick, bakes her samosas for a “lighter, less oily” result. 
Again, it works fine (200C/390F for about 15 minutes, until golden brown), but 
a baked samosa will never achieve the same puffy, flaky richness as the 
deep-fried variety. As with the chicken kiev or the scotch egg, there really is 
no substitute for a pan of hot fat and some strong nerves.

Make sure the oil doesn’t get too hot, though; as Singh observes, you need to 
keep the heat medium-low heat otherwise the pastry shell won’t cook through 
before the outside burns.

(Makes 24 mini samosas or 12 larger ones)

For the pastry
130g plain flour
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp nigella seeds (optional)
2 tbsp neutral oil, plus extra to grease

For the masala
10g cinnamon sticks
1 tsp cloves
1½ tsp cumin seeds
3-4 small dried red chillies

For the filling
1 medium potato, about 175g
1 tbsp finely grated ginger
1 small green chilli, finely chopped
1 tbsp neutral oil
½ onion, finely chopped
½ carrot, finely chopped
50g green cabbage, cored and finely shredded
40g peas
50g paneer, cut into small dice
Fine salt
Juice of ½ lemon
Small bunch of coriander, finely chopped
Neutral oil, to deep fry

To make the pastry, put the flour in a large bowl and whisk in the salt and 
nigella seeds, if using. Add the oil and rub in with your fingers, then 
gradually add just enough cold water to bring it together into a stiff dough – 
about 50ml should do it. Knead for about five minutes until smooth, then 
lightly oil, cover and set aside to rest.

Put the potato, skin on, into a small pan, cover with cold, well-salted water, 
bring to the boil, then simmer until tender. Drain and mash.

Meanwhile, toast the ingredients for the masala together in a hot pan until 
fragrant, then allow to cool and grind until you have a smooth powder. Mash the 
ginger and chilli together into a paste.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion until 
soft and golden, then stir in the carrot, turn down the heat a little and cook 
for five minutes, then stir in the cabbage and cook until beginning to soften. 
Turn up the heat to medium-high and salt the paneer well, then add to the pan 
along with the peas. Cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the ginger 
chilli paste and half a teaspoon of the masala and cook for another couple of 
minutes, stirring. Stir in the potato and lemon juice and season to taste.

Divide the pastry into 12 balls of about 18g each for small samosas, or 6 
balls of about 35g for slightly larger ones, and put all but one under a damp 
cloth. Roll the ball out on a lightly greased surface to a circle about 18cm 
(10cm for small) in diameter and cut in half. Pick up one half, wet the round 
edge with water and form into a cone shape, overlapping the wet edge and 
pressing together to seal.

Stir the coriander into the mixture, then fill the cones. Wet the top edge, 
pinch to close and fold over any remaining flap of pastry. Repeat with the 
remaining pastry, making sure each samosa is well sealed.

Heat a deep frying pan with about 4cm of oil to about 175C/347F, or use a 
fryer. When the oil has come to temperature add a batch of samosas (don’t 
overcrowd the pan) and cook until golden brown, turning as necessary. Scoop on 
to paper towels and serve immediately.

Samosas: are these the most moreish of Indian snacks – and if not, what else 
would you recommend with party season fast approaching? What do you like to 
fill them with, and does anywhere sell a decent ready-made version?
