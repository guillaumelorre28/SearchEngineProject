Leeds United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited>’s friendly 
against Eintracht Frankfurt in Austria was marred by serious crowd violence, 
with riot police intervening to separate fighting fans.

Frankfurt supporters are reported to have confronted Leeds fans as the crowd 
entered the pitch following United’s 2-1 defeat, by which time the players had 
left the field.

Local police said 25 arrests had been made, 17 from Frankfurt, while three 
Leeds fans, two police officers and two stewards needed hospital treatment.

: “A few of us went over to applaud the Frankfurt fans. I was going to shake 
their hands. Then their ultras jumped over the [advertising] boards and started 
attacking us. Some were wearing balaclavas and we were outnumbered.”
