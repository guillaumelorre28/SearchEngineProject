Aberdeen’s title challenge suffered a blow as they slumped to a controversial 
defeat at Inverness on Monday night. With the match poised at 1-1, the referee 
Willie Collum awarded a second-half penalty against Aberdeen’s Ash Taylor 
despite little apparent contact with Ross Draper, and Greg Tansey scored from 
the spot to put Inverness ahead.

Collum further angered the travelling Dons fans when he initially disallowed 
Carl Tremarco’s goal which gave Inverness a 3-1 lead, before reversing his 
decision after consulting with linesman Graham McNeillie.

The Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> manager, Derek 
McInnes, said: “Key decisions have gone against us that should have gone for 
us. That’s pivotal in the outcome of the result. At the time I didn’t think 
there was anything in it. The player has bought a penalty. He’s gone down under 
no contact and the referee has assumed there is contact.”

Inverness’ manager John Hughes sympathised with McInnes but was happy to 
receive a bit of luck. “For the second goal, the penalty, if it was against me 
I would have felt hard done by,” he said. “Draper did get a touch and the boy 
clattered him but it is 50-50. We take it. Here was a little bit of luck for 
the third one as well, off an Aberdeen head and then Carl Tremarco is in at the 
back.”

Aberdeen had taken a seventh-minute lead through Adam Rooney before Iain 
Vigurs equalised 11 minutes later.

The defeat ended Aberdeen’s 12-game unbeaten league run and put a dent in 
their title charge. Inverness move up to sixth on goal difference.
