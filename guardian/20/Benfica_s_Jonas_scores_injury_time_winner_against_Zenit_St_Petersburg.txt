The first half had been an unsightly slog with 16 fouls, seven offsides and 
four bookings.Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> came to 
life in the second half but still struggled to create chances against a 
tightly-packed, well-drilled Zenit, who were playing their first competitive 
match since 9 December.

Jonas had the best effort of the first half when the Benfica forward unleashed 
a shot from the edge of the area but Zenit’s Nicolas Lombaerts just got his 
head to the ball and his touch forced it centimetres wide of the post.

Zenit had to wait until the 36th minute for their first shot on goal but Hulk, 
who got little change out of Benfica’s Eliseu, fired a low effort wide from 25 
metres.

The Benfica goalkeeper Julio Cesar finally made a save in the 52nd minute when 
he parried a dangerous shot from Axel Witsel. He also had to stop a header from 
the Belgian midfielder from the resulting corner.

The hosts nearly went ahead in the 69th minute when Gaitán skipped past a 
defender but saw his shot stopped at point-blank range by the goalkeeper Yuri 
Lodygin.

Benfica continued to dominate and Gaitán was foiled again by Lodygin before 
his team-mate Jardel turned the ball wide after Victor Lindelof headed down 
Renato Sanches’s cross.
