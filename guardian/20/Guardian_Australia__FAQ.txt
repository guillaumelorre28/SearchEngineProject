Who owns the Guardian?

The ultimate owner of the Guardian is the Scott Trust, which was originally 
created as a trust in 1936 to safeguard the title's journalistic freedom.

In 2008 it was replaced by a limited company with the same core purpose of the 
original trust: to secure the financial and editorial independence of the 
Guardian in perpetuity, while its subsidiary aims are to champion its 
principles and to promote freedom of the press in the UK and elsewhere.

Other than to cover expense, the Scott Trust takes no dividend from the 
group's businesses, whose profits are instead reinvested to sustain journalism 
that is free from commercial or political interference.

How is Guardian Australia being funded?

Guardian Australia is a commercial operation, working with advertisers and 
other commercial partners.

We also have founding investment from internet entrepreneur and philanthropist 
Graeme Wood. He is the founding investor in Guardian Australia, but will not 
hold shares or become a member of the board.

How are editorial decisions made?

Editorial decisions are made by the editor of Guardian Australia and 
ultimately by the editor-in-chief of Guardian News & Media. In keeping with the 
requirements of The Scott Trust Ltd, commercial management and third parties 
have no involvement in the editorial decisions of Guardian Australia.
