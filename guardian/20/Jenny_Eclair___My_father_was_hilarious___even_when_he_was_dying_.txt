The funniest standup I’ve ever seen

I once seriously worried about myself watching Greg Davies perform Firing 
Cheeseballs At A Dog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/24/greg-davies-review> in a tiny 
room in Edinburgh about six years ago. I felt I might simultaneously wet myself 
and choke to death and everyone would think I was just pissed rather than just 
laughing too much.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen

I don’t think you can beat Frasier 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk4d7JWn4oA> for sheer scalpel-sharp writing 
and performance.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had

Everyone always laughs at the word “perm” so probably when I had a perm, even 
though I thought I looked fantastic.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen

Cal McCrystal’s direction of Stiff, again in Edinburgh, yonks ago, had me 
totally beside myself, which is weird because slapstick doesn’t really do it 
for me; I tend to like my comedy quite wordy. We Are Klang’s debut hour also 
made me honk like a big goose.

The funniest person I know

My mother, sometimes unintentionally, and my daughter. But, until he died a 
couple of years ago, it was my father. He was hilarious and funny even when he 
was meant to be dying. Once, after his kidneys packed in, he came round and 
nicked a bar of chocolate off a nurse.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever heard

In the old days it used to be: “Show us your tits”. It would be hilarious if 
someone shouted that now. In fact I’d be very tempted to get them out.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

Most bodily functions. Yes farting still does it for me and I’m 56; however I 
find burping objectionable.

The funniest number

Eleven or 150 billion gadzillion; I don’t tend to be too cut-and-dried about 
these things.

The funniest word

All words are potentially funny, you’ve just got to get them in the right 
order. That’s the hard bit.
