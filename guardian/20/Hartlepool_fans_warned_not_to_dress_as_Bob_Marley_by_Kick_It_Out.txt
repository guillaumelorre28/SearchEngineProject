Fans of Hartlepool United have been warned by the anti-discrimination body 
Kick It Out <https://www.theguardian.com/football/kick-it-out> over plans to 
dress up as reggae icon Bob Marley for their last match of the season against 
Carlisle United.

Several hundred fans of the fourth tier team are set to travel to Brunton Park 
on 2 May in full fancy dress – something which has become an annual tradition 
in recent yeas at the club.

Kick It Out, however, have called for any supporter who “blacks up” to be 
refused entry to the ground.

“We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hartlepool> United supporters about the 
Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club’s fans for their 
fixture against Carlisle,” Kick It Out said in a statement.

“The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 
‘black up’. We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting 
both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter.

“We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the 
United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have 
received.”

John Pearson, the Hartlepool fan who organised the fancy dress theme, told BBC 
Sport there was “never any intention” for fans to “black up”.

“It’s a bit offensive to suggest we were going to black up,” he said. “I’m not 
sure why anyone would even do that. I think someone has contacted Kick it Out 
and the whole thing has got a bit out of control.”

Carlisle’s Keith Curle, one of a handful of black and ethnic minority managers 
in the top four divisions in England, said he could not see any racial element 
to people dressing up as the late singer.
