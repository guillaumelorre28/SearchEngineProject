With Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> having won four 
consecutive games in their division, the chairman Lee Power announced on 
Wednesday that the arrangement with Williams would become a longer-term one.

“Luke is an integral part of our project at Swindon Town,” Power said in a 
statement on the club’s official website.

“He is a fantastic coach – the best I’ve come across in 25 years of football. 
He has had to do it the hard way and has certainly served his apprenticeship.

“He finished as a player very early on due to injury and has put his whole 
life into coaching and improving players. He’s been an under-14s coach, a 
youth-team manager, an under-21s manager and an assistant manager and is now 
ready to be a head coach. He buys fully into the club’s model and is the ideal 
man to lead the club forward.

“The reason we have taken a bit of time over the appointment is that we both 
wanted to make sure that he was ready and comfortable to take on the other 
parts of the job that he hasn’t had to do up to this point – mainly picking the 
side and dealing with the press.

“If either of these jobs had detracted from the quality of his coaching, we 
would have looked at going down a different route but he has taken to the role 
in his usual calm, controlled manner and been totally unfazed.”
