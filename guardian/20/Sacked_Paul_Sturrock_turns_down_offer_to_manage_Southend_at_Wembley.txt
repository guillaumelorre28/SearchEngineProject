Paul Sturrock has had a change of heart and turned down the chance to manage 
Southend <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southend> in the Johnstone's 
Paint Trophy final at Wembley.

The chairman, Ron Martin, announced on Sunday that Sturrock had been sacked 
but that, bizarrely, he would return to take charge for the final against Crewe 
on 7 April.

Sturrock then said that he would not only be leading the team out but would 
also be taking training next week and picking the team. That presented an 
unusual situationonce Phil Brown was confirmed as the League Two club's new 
manager on Monday

Exactly who would be pulling the strings next weekend remained unclear after 
Brown was unveiled to the press on Tuesday morning, with the former Hull 
manager saying he hoped the Wembley situation would be "resolved in the next 
few days".

Southend on Thursday said on their official Twitter feed: "Paul Sturrock has 
announced he has politely declined the chairman's offer for him to manage the 
team at Wembley. Paul will travel with the supporters to the game and sit in 
amongst the fans. He says he is looking forward to a few beers with you all."

Brown will manage Southend in the final against Crewe as the Essex club play 
in their first Wembley final, where they will be backed by around 30,000 
supporters.
