To be safe and comfortable on a bike at this time of year, you need only two 
things: lights and mudguards. Yet, incredibly, almost no bikes are sold with 
these two essentials. They’re dismissed as ‘extras’. Eh? Do manufacturers think 
we all live in Honolulu? As usual, our European cousins do things rather 
differently. The German company Kalkhoff has been making bikes since 1919. This 
latest model is a svelte city rider with an easy-to-live-with step-thru frame. 
It also comes preloaded with kit: mudguards; a pannier rack; a heavy-duty 
kickstand so you can park the bike when there’s nowhere convenient to lean it; 
and super-bright dynamo lights so you are never caught out in the dark. The 
lights in particular are excellent. The LEDs are bolted to the frame and are 
powered by the front dynohub, so no batteries are required and they are 
unpinchable. There, that wasn’t so hard, was it? (edinburghbicycle.com
