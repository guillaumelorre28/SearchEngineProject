Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> should “see sense” and drop 
disciplinary action against England and Scotland for wearing remembrance 
poppies during their World Cup qualifier on Armistice Day, the culture 
secretary, Karen Bradley, said.


There was a widespread outcry after the football associations of both 
countries were charged by Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/17/england-scotland-fifa-disciplinary-proceedings-poppies-world-cup>
, the sport’s world governing body, for wearing armbands decorated with the 
poignant symbol during their 11 November game at Wembley.

The Conservative MP said she had been at the national stadium for the match 
and been pleased to see players with poppies on to commemorate Britain’s war 
dead.

Bradley told told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: “I urge Fifa to see 
sense in this and withdraw the threat of sanctions. If a player wants to wear a 
poppy, they should be able to do so, as should fans.”

Fifa’s tough stance on the poppy, as part of its rule 4.4 concerning 
political, religious or commercial messages

, caused a furore in the build-up to, and over, remembrance weekend.

England and Scotland defied the governing body in their game, which England 
won 3-0

.

The Football Association of Wales and Irish Football Association (IFA) have 
also been charged

.

The Welsh association revealed it had been charged over supporters wearing 
poppies in the crowd during theWales v Serbia match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/12/wales-serbia-world-cup-qualifier-match-report>
 on 12 November. The IFA is also under investigation for fans wearing poppies at
Northern Ireland’s game against Azerbaijan

 on 11 November.

All four nations now face the possibility of a fine, while in theory even a 
World Cup qualifying points deduction is possible.

Earlier this month, Theresa May launched a blistering attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/02/theresa-may-attacks-fifa-over-utterly-outrageous-poppy-ban-remembrance-day>
 on Fifa for rejecting the request from England and Scotland players to wear 
armbands featuring poppies.

Speaking at prime minister’s questions, she said the stance taken by Fifa was 
“utterly outrageous” and the strength of feeling across the House of Commons 
was clear.

“Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their 
lives for our safety and security,” May said. “I think it is absolutely right 
they should be able to do so.”
