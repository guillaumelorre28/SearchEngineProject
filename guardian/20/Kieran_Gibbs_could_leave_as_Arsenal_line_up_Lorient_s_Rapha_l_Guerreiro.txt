Arsenal are tracking the Lorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient>
 left-back Raphaël Guerreiro before a possible summer bid, as Arsène Wenger 
considers whether to listen to offers for Kieran Gibbs. The club have made 
repeated scouting checks on Guerreiro, the pacy 22-year-old Portugal 
international, who impressed last summer for his country at the European 
Under-21 Championship and can also play further forward on the left wing.

The Arsenal manager has a long-standing relationship with Lorient, having 
signed Laurent Koscielny from them in 2010

. He loaned Francis Coquelin there in 2010-11 and Joel Campbell the following 
season while he sold the forward, Gilles Sunu, to them in the summer of 2011, 
after an initial loan. Sunu is now at Angers.

Gibbs, 26, has fallen behind Nacho Monreal

 in the pecking order for the left-back slot and he has madeonly three Premier 
League starts

 this season. Wenger has developed Gibbs into an 11-cap England international 
but, with Monreal’s form, he has found it difficult to give him the playing 
time that he wants.One player who is fully behind Wenger is Mesut Özil. The 
German tweeted his admiration for his club manager as he prepares to face 
England.

“Arsène Wenger was a big reason for me joining Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> – this hasn’t changed! Respect 
AFC,” tweeted Özil.
