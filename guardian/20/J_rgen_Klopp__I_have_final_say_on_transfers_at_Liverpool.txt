Jürgen Klopp <https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp> said he has 
the final say on all Liverpool transfers after the club’s policy on signings 
came under renewed scrutiny following only two wins in the past eight Premier 
League games.

On Sunday, Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> failed 
to score at home against Manchester United and lost 1-0 with £32.5m signing 
Christian Benteke on the bench until the 81st minute and the on-loan defender 
Steven Caulker coming on as Klopp’s last substitute.

Klopp, when asked whether he has the final say on transfers, replied: “Yes. 
It’s how I am used to work. If I don’t want a player to come to the club he 
will not come. It’s normal.”

Liverpool are at home to Exeter City in the FA Cup on Wednesday – a replay 
after the first leg finished in a 2-2 draw

 – with the manager still unable to call on Daniel Sturridge because the 
striker has not been involved in team training yet. Klopp will again pick an 
inexperienced side against the League Two team.

“Daniel has not been involved in team training since the Newcastle game. He’s 
had some issues. We will play a similar team to the last time [we played 
Exeter]. We have to think about who it makes sense [to play], for whom it’s not 
too difficult, and build a squad for this,” Klopp said.

The defender Jon Flanagan, who has not played a first-team game since May 
2014, is set to be included in the squad. “Jon is in a really good way and we 
are happy. He’s training today – if nothing happens he’s on the bench,” Klopp 
said.
