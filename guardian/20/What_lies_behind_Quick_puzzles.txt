Further to the CATHODE/ANODE issue discussed last month (which is positive and 
which negative?), I have been deluged with explanations clearly offered in a 
genuine spirit of charity. As the saying goes, I am still confused but at a 
very much higher level. Michael C. tells me that there are two types of 
electrochemical cells (galvanic, where the anode has negative polarity, and 
electrolytic, which work quite differently and where the anode is positive). 
His suggestion is that, for the future avoidance of all doubt, the words 
'galvanic' or 'electrolytic' should be added as appropriate to any clue 
intended to lead to the solutions CATHODE or ANODE. John R. points me to
Wikipedia's article on primary cells <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_cell>
, expressing the view that this will quickly make all plain to me, which it 
does for all of 30 seconds.

Perhaps the most practical advice for a person in my position came from Peter 
B. This was to cut entirely from future clues all references to 'positive' or 
'negative' and to stick simply to 'electrode' or 'battery terminal'. The 
indicated letter count would tell the solver whether the solution was ANODE or 
CATHODE – which would not be the case, for example, with "Yellow stuff on your 
plate (7)", where the solution could be either MUSTARD or CUSTARD. A bit of me 
says that accepting Peter B.'s advice would be running away from a problem, 
rather than facing it squarely; but then life is short.

A piece I wrote recently in the paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/21/open-door-crossword-editor>
 about the crosswords explained the reasons why my predecessor, John Perkin, 
gave noms de plume to the previously anonymous cryptic crosswords setters. They 
help solvers to recognise an individual setter's personal foibles and let them 
know who they are up against that day. Why, I have now been asked, should the 
same not apply to the setters of the Quick puzzles?

There are two answers to this question. First, whereas with the Cryptics there 
is a deliberate policy of running puzzles with widely different levels of 
difficulty, the Quicks are supposed to be pretty homogeneous in style and 
standard (though, judging by some of the mail I get, not all of you think that 
this is achieved all of the time). Second, to a degree that might surprise you, 
the clues and/or solutions in the Quicks get altered, mainly in order to avoid 
too much repetition in too short a space of time.

For both these reasons a Quick, when it finally appears, is often 
significantly different from the puzzle that was originally sent in and, 
indeed, the original setter in question might well not like all of what 
eventually appears. Of course, with the Cryptics there is also an editing 
process, but all these changes are in principle cleared with the author to 
ensure that she or he is happy with the substance and style of the edits, since 
the puzzle that appears will bear their nom de plume.

July's Genius (No 85 by Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crossword/java/new/0,,-26011,00.html>) attracted a 
record number of entries – 399 in total. On the face of it, as the "yarborough" 
theme was not a simple one, this seems to be evidence that more of you are 
having a go at this monthly offering. Incidentally, the solution to the July 
puzzle, together with explanatory notes, can be reached via theLast month's 
Genius solution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crossword/java/new/complete/0,,-26011,00.html> 
link under thelatest Genius crossword 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crossword/genius/> to be found half way down the 
left-hand side of thecrossword home page 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords>.

Our old friends Ian of London N16 and Peter of Montville, Queensland were 
again the first pair home with correct solutions (at 02:11 and 03:00 
respectively). The first correct submission from someone who might at least 
have had some sleep before tacking the puzzle was from Nesta of Swansea at 
07:15. There were 28 other correct solutions on that first day.
