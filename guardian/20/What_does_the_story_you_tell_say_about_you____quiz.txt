Look at this picture. Now make up a story in your head involving the woman in 
the laboratory. Feel free to share your story in the comments section (if you 
don’t mind other people analysing you!) To find out what your story reveals 
about you, answer the questions below and give yourself a tick for each ‘yes’…

a) Does the central character see the situation as a challenge, or invest 
herself in some way?

b) Does she undertake an activity she chose so as to move towards a goal?

c) Does she think about her own motives, or obstacles in the world that need 
to be overcome?

d) Does she show evidence of taking personal responsibility?

e) Does she show confidence in herself or satisfaction in her achievements, or 
achieve her goal?

The theory behind this test is that the stories we come up with reflect our 
own personalities – in this case, our need for autonomy: the need to feel that 
we can make our own choices. The more ticks you have, the more you need to feel 
that you are the master of your own destiny.

A study found that people with an average-to-high need for autonomy experience 
greater psychological wellbeing when their boss asks their opinion on how to 
proceed rather than just giving an order. They also experience more “flow”, the 
sense of being totally absorbed in an activity at which you are an expert. 
People with a low need for autonomy don’t show this pattern.
