Dinamo had the upper hand in the opening period but the best chance fell to 
the visitors when a viciously dipping shot by defender Arthur Masuaku forced a 
good save from the home team’s goalkeeper Eduardo.

Dinamo pounded a series of fizzing crosses into the penalty area but to no 
great effect as a packedOlympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> defence held their own.

Both sides missed a sitter each in the space of a minute shortly after the 
break when Dinamo’s Domagoj Antolic hit the post from close range before Ideye 
skewed his shot wide from three yards with the goal at his mercy.

Marko Rog’s trickling shot shaved the Olympiakos woodwork before Ideye raced 
clear of his marker on the left flank and buried the ball past Eduardo with a 
crisp finish.

The substitute Ángelo Henríquez missed Dinamo’s last chance to salvage a 
point, heading inches wide of the far post after a good cross from the right by 
full-back Alexandru Mățel.
