Ronaldo, who had failed to score in either of Madrid’s opening league games, 
needed just seven minutes to open his account against Espanyol, having bagged a 
hat-trick here last season. He promptly scored again from the penalty spot and 
then completed his hat-trick on 20 minutes with the help of a cross from Gareth 
Bale.

Karim Benzema added a fourth before the break and then in the second half Bale 
again laid on the pass for Ronaldo to strike for the fourth time and makeReal

still not done, converting again from inside the area on 80 minutes.

Real’s Portugal defender Pepe told Spanish television.

visit Atlético Madrid later on Saturday in a match between the last two league 
champions.
