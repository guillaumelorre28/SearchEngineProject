Joey Barton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/joey-barton> is back in 
training with Burnley following his contract termination at Rangers.

Barton, 34, played an influential role in earning the Clarets promotion to the 
Premier League last season before an ill-fated spell at Ibrox.

Sean Dyche, the Burnley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> 
manager, offered Barton the chance to maintain his fitness at the club’s 
Barnfield training centre and confirmed the midfielder has accepted the offer.

“Joey has been in with us training, with us, to get himself fit, not with the 
first team,” he told the Burnley Express. “Beyond that, anything else is for 
the future, he’s just getting himself fit.”

Barton would not be eligible to sign for a new club until the January window, 
meaning there is no rush for either party to commit to a reunion.

Whether he feels up to the pace of the Premier League, having turned down the 
chance to stay with Burnley in the summer, is an open question and he is sure 
to have suitors in theChampionship

After enjoying one of the more serene campaigns of his colourful career at 
Turf Moor, Barton endured a brief but turbulent time in Glasgow.

He arrived with the stated ambition of being the best player in Scotland, but 
managed just eight appearances, mostly underwhelming, and was suspended after a 
training ground row that followed a 5-1 defeat by the Old Firm rivals Celtic.

Barton was later handed a one-match suspension for breaching Scottish Football 
Association rules on gambling, having placed 44 bets on games between 1 July, 
when his Ibrox deal started, and 15 September. That suspension will carry over 
whenever he signs for a new club.
