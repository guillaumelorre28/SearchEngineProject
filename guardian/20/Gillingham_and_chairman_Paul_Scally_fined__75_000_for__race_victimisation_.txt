An FA statement said: “The club and Mr Scally, who has also been ordered to 
attend an education programme, were found to be in breach of FA Rule E3(1) for 
failing to act in the best interests of the game and bringing the game into 
disrepute.

“This followed an employment tribunal decision which held that an employee had 
been unfairly dismissed by the club and that the dismissal was an act of race 
victimisation by Mr Scally and the club.”

Gillingham had appealed the decision by the employment tribunal in 2012 but 
the verdict was upheld by a judge in September 2013 and McCammon, who has 
previously played for a number of Football League clubs including Brentford, 
Millwall, Brighton and Doncaster, was awarded £68,000.

“I am shocked, stunned and angered by this decision, as are my staff at the 
club,” said Scally in a statement on Gillingham’s website. “The level of these 
sanctions is manifestly excessive, totally disproportionate and completely 
unjust. We have been given no reasoned explanation for the severity of the 
fines. The club and I will be appealing against this decision and, if 
necessary, we will take the matter beyond the FA.”
