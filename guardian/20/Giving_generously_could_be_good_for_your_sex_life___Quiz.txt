Suppose you are in a raffle with a chance of winning £100. Before making the 
draw, the organisers offer you the option of having some or all of your 
potential winnings go directly to the charity of your choice.

Do you donate? And, if so, how much?

In a recent study, the participants were given the same choice I gave you, but 
in a real-life draw, meaning that real money was potentially at stake. Overall, 
around 58% of men and 70% of women chose to donate. They were also given 
questionnaires about their sexual and relationship history.

You’re probably familiar with the saying that nice guys finish last. But, 
happily, the study suggested that when it comes to the mating game, this isn’t 
necessarily true. Participants who were willing to donate some of their 
potential winnings reported having more sexual partners both overall and in the 
past year, as well as more casual sex partners and – for men – more dating 
partners.

These findings suggest an answer to the long-standing question of why humans 
are (sometimes) altruistic, even though this may seem to have a disadvantage in 
evolutionary terms. Generosity is what biologists call a “costly signal” of 
evolutionary fitness: if you’re so wealthy that you can afford to give money 
away, a potential mate might deduce that your genes are probably pretty good.
