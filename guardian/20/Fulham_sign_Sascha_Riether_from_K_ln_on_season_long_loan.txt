Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have completed the 
signing of the right-back Sascha Riether on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old 
has made two appearances for Germany and joins from Köln, who were recently 
relegated from the Bundesliga.

Riether has signed on loan for the whole season and Fulham have an option to 
make the move permanent at the end of that period.

"I feel very pleased to have signed," Riether said. "It feels like I've had a 
long break from football and for me this is a new experience in a new country. 
Fulham is a good club, a big club with a big tradition and for me it's great to 
be here.

"I played here one time with Wolfsburg and I remember Craven Cottage being a 
great stadium with great fans, and I hope I can go on to have a great season 
here."

Riether, who can also operate in midfield, spent last season at Köln after 
joining from Wolfsburg. The defender began his career 10 years ago at Freiburg, 
with whom he made 139 appearances over five seasons. Riether then went on to 
enjoy four seasons at Wolfsburg, helping them to the Bundesliga title in 
2008-09, before joiningKöln <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cologne>.

Riether's arrival helps shore up the Cottagers' defence as last season's 
regulars at right-back, Stephen Kelly and Zdenek Grygera, are both out of 
contract.
