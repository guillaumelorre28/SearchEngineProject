Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> have rejected a bid 
from Newcastle for their striker Yoan Gouffran, according to reports in France.

Newcastle, who are still searching for a replacement for Demba Ba after his 
move to Chelsea earlier in January, are believed to have offered €750,000 
(£629,000) to the Ligue 1 side for the 26-year-old who has six months remaining 
on his contract in France.

However, Sud Ouest and L'Equipe have both reported that Bordeaux have turned 
down the offer as they have put a price tag of €1m on the former France 
Under-21 international.

Gouffran, who moved to Bordeaux from Caen in 2008, has scored 10 goals in 22 
games for Francis Gillot's side to help them to seventh in the table.
