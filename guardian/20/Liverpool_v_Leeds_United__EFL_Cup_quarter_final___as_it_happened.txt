GOAL! Liverpool 2-0 Leeds (Woodburn, 81 min)

Playing with a swagger now, Liverpool attack down the right, Origi leading the 
charge. He plays it to Mane, who cuts Leeds open with a superb backheel back to 
the Belgian. Origi knocks it inside to Wijnaldum, who unselfishly tees up Ben 
Woodburn, who’s all alone six yards out. The 17-year-old composes himself. 
Then, with the Kop baying, he lashes the ball high into the net to score his 
firstLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goal and put 
his team into the last four. What a moment for the youngster!

GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Leeds (Origi, 76 min)

The highly promising Alexander-Arnold whips a devilish, bouncing, 
Beckham-esque cross in from the right, causing all sorts of problems for the 
Leeds defence. Silvestri hasn’t a clue how to deal with it, so he decides to 
stay on his line and hope for the best. Origi’s isn’t going to stand around and 
watch, though. He gambles, throwing himself at the ball and poking it past the 
unconvincing Leeds goalkeeper with his studs to giveLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> the lead!

72 min: Out of nowhere, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> open Leeds up, Mane flicking a 
glorious pass through to Wijnaldum on the right. He’s eight yards out. He 
slides his shot across Silvestri and towards the far corner and it looks a 
certain goal, only for the ball to hit the base of the post and bounce out. 
Mane tries to force in the rebound, but Leeds throw bodies in the way. The 
scare for the visitors ends with Woodburn slicing a shot out for a throw.

69 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> mount their 
first coherent attack for as long as anyone can remember. Origi’s cross is 
headed behind for a corner by Ayling, but nothing comes from it. Are we heading 
for extra-time?

66 min: Stewart’s injury means that Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are down to 10 men for the 
time being and they’re all over the place at the moment. Vieira pounces on a 
mistake in the middle and finds Roofe in space on the right, but Mignolet saves 
his low drive and holds it at the second attempt. This game is there to be won 
for Leeds.

65 min: The lively Roofe twist and turns and wins a corner off Klavan on the 
right. The visitors look the likelier side at the moment. From Taylor’s corner, 
Bartley rises and heads wide.

53 min: Sacko and Wijnaldum chase after a long ball down the right, the 
Liverpool man getting there first and knocking a shaky backpass to Mignolet, 
who has to scamper quickly to make sure calamity doesn’t ensue.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> try to play their way out of 
trouble and they do so impressively at first, Alexander-Arnold niftily turning 
away from Roofe. But then Stewart carelessly gives it away. The ball’s worked 
to Roofe on the left, 20 yards out. He opens up his body and aims for the far 
corner with a curling effort that beats Mingolet, hits the inside of the post 
and bounces to safety!

41 min: 25 yards from goal, Phillips catches a loose ball well. It hits Lucas

38 min: Ejaria almost combines with Origi in the Leeds area, but Cooper 
intervenes commandingly and Leeds break. Roofe’s found in space on the left. 
The flag goes up for offside. Roofe was in his own half.

90 min+2: Doukara bullies Lucas in the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area, only to wallop miles 
over the bar.
 
90 min+1: Booked for dissent a moment ago, Origi walks off and Marko Grujic 
replaces him.
 
90 min: There will be three added minutes.
 
88 min: In the other quarter-final taking place, by the way, it remains Hull 
0-0 Newcastle.
 
87 min: Taylor crosses from the left, Wood heads straight at Mignolet.
 
84 min: Sacko plays a neat one-two with Doukara and runs through on goal, only 
to blaze high and wide. Leeds have played well, but they’ve lacked composure in 
front of goal.
 
83 min: Wood smashes the ball into the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> net. But his joy is 
shortlived. The flag’s up for offside.

Playing with a swagger now, Liverpool attack down the right, Origi leading the 
charge. He plays it to Mane, who cuts Leeds open with a superb backheel back to 
the Belgian. Origi knocks it inside to Wijnaldum, who unselfishly tees up Ben 
Woodburn, who’s all alone six yards out. The 17-year-old composes himself. 
Then, with the Kop baying, he lashes the ball high into the net to score his 
firstLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goal and put 
his team into the last four. What a moment for the youngster!

80 min: Origi has hobbled back on. James Milner’s services aren’t required yet.
 
78 min: The hero a minute ago, Origi has gone down with an injury. It’s the 
last thingLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> need after 
losing Coutinho on Saturday.
 
The highly promising Alexander-Arnold whips a devilish, bouncing, 
Beckham-esque cross in from the right, causing all sorts of problems for the 
Leeds defence. Silvestri hasn’t a clue how to deal with it, so he decides to 
stay on his line and hope for the best. Origi’s isn’t going to stand around and 
watch, though. He gambles, throwing himself at the ball and poking it past the 
unconvincing Leeds goalkeeper with his studs to giveLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> the lead!

72 min: Out of nowhere, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> open Leeds up, Mane flicking a 
glorious pass through to Wijnaldum on the right. He’s eight yards out. He 
slides his shot across Silvestri and towards the far corner and it looks a 
certain goal, only for the ball to hit the base of the post and bounce out. 
Mane tries to force in the rebound, but Leeds throw bodies in the way. The 
scare for the visitors ends with Woodburn slicing a shot out for a throw.
 
69 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> mount their 
first coherent attack for as long as anyone can remember. Origi’s cross is 
headed behind for a corner by Ayling, but nothing comes from it. Are we heading 
for extra-time?
 
67 min: Ben Woodburn, who’s only 17, replaces the injured Kevin Stewart.
 
66 min: Stewart’s injury means that Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are down to 10 men for the 
time being and they’re all over the place at the moment. Vieira pounces on a 
mistake in the middle and finds Roofe in space on the right, but Mignolet saves 
his low drive and holds it at the second attempt. This game is there to be won 
for Leeds.

65 min: The lively Roofe twist and turns and wins a corner off Klavan on the 
right. The visitors look the likelier side at the moment. From Taylor’s corner, 
Bartley rises and heads wide.
 
63 min: Acclaimed novelist Steve Bruce is in the stands tonight. There’s a 
stoppage in play as Stewart receives treatment for a head injury.
 
62 min: Leeds make their final change, Chris Wood on for Stuart Dallas. Garry 
Monk is going for it.
 
61 min: Can finds Moreno on the overlap. The Spaniard’s cross is pish. Moments 
later, Wijnaldum goes down in the area. Nothing doing.
 
59 min: Lucas steps in assertively to win possession before surging forward. 
He finds Can on the edge of the area. Silvestri easily saves his deflected 
effort.
 
56 min: Doukara picks up a booking after scything down Stewart. “This game 
cries out for a top class striker: if only Leeds legend Robbie Fowler were 
available,” says Paul Griffin.
 
55 min: Liverpool have been asleep since half-time. How long before Klopp 
makes a change?

53 min: Sacko and Wijnaldum chase after a long ball down the right, the 
Liverpool man getting there first and knocking a shaky backpass to Mignolet, 
who has to scamper quickly to make sure calamity doesn’t ensue.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> try to play their way out of 
trouble and they do so impressively at first, Alexander-Arnold niftily turning 
away from Roofe. But then Stewart carelessly gives it away. The ball’s worked 
to Roofe on the left, 20 yards out. He opens up his body and aims for the far 
corner with a curling effort that beats Mingolet, hits the inside of the post 
and bounces to safety!
 
51 min: Moreno decides to show Origi how it’s done, shooting from 25 yards. 
The ball dribbles miserably wide. I’ve always wondered how theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> doctors managed to miss his 
lobotomy when he had his medical.
 
50 min: Can does better this time, sliding a cute pass through to Mane, who 
flicks it quickly to Origi, who wants too long to shoot. Instead of hitting it, 
he tries to walk it in and he’s tackled.
 
48 min: Can bustles down the left and handily chips the ball to no one.
 
46 min: Off we go again. Leeds have made a second change. Luke Ayling has 
replaced Liam Cooper in central defence.
 
In the night’s other quarter-final, it’s Hull 0-0 Newcastle.
 
Leeds will take this. There’s not been much in it.
 
44 min: Sacko brilliantly nutmegs Stewart in the middle. Then he runs into four
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defenders.
 
41 min: 25 yards from goal, Phillips catches a loose ball well. It hits Lucas 
and spins off for a Leeds corner. Taylor’s delivery isn’t great, though.
 
38 min: Ejaria almost combines with Origi in the Leeds area, but Cooper 
intervenes commandingly and Leeds break. Roofe’s found in space on the left. 
The flag goes up for offside. Roofe was in his own half.
