Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> spent time on an 
official trip to Serbia as foreign secretary promoting his latest book about 
Winston Churchill, it has emerged.

Johnson discussed The Churchill Factor, his biography of the wartime prime 
minister, and signed a few copies at a bookstore in Belgrade on the second day 
of his trip earlier this month.

Labour called on the foreign secretary, who was given the senior job by 
Theresa May in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/washington-reaction-boris-johnson-uk-foreign-secretary>
, to explain why he spent time on an official visit talking about his book. He 
was photographed at the shop in front of a cutout of Winston Churchill and 
displays of the book cover.

The Serbian translator of the book was present, and there were a number of 
media reports following the event. His Serbian publisher also tweeted about the 
signing.

Although it was trailed in Serbian media before his arrival 
<http://tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=281410> as an event about The Churchill 
Factor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/03/churchill-factor-review-boris-johnson-winston>
, the Foreign Office said it was “absolutely not a promotional event”.


A source said Johnson and his aides had specifically asked for it not to be 
about the book and that he was embarrassed to find the bookstore had welcomed 
him in such a way.

The source said he had talked about the book and writing to a small group of 
people and signed a few copies to be polite, but that there was no question of 
him trying to further his private interests on an official trip.


A spokesman for Johnson said it would be “completely wrong” to suggest he was 
doing any intentional publicity around the book.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman added: “The foreign secretary was invited to talk 
about freedom of the press at the oldest known bookstore in Belgrade. The store 
chose to welcome him by putting some of his books on display and some local 
people asked him to sign their books.”

However, it is understood that eyebrows were raised in Belgrade about why he 
was talking about his book, the week after theelection of Donald Trump in the US
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/boris-johnson-faces-mps-over-farage-trump-and-climate-change>
 and with the UK engaged in intense international diplomacy over the Brexit 
vote.


It is not the only time The Churchill Factor has cropped up in the course of 
Johnson’s official work as foreign secretary. It is understood Johnson gave his 
own book as a gift to Murray McCully, the New Zealand foreign minister, after 
diplomatic meetings.

Asked whether the book was presented regularly by Johnson to his counterparts, 
a Foreign Office source said it was given only occasionally when information 
suggested the gift would be welcomed by a foreign visitor or host.


Johnson’s appearance at the event was criticised by Andrew Gwynne, a shadow 
Cabinet Office minister, who called for Johnson to “immediately explain” what 
he was doing talking about his book inSerbia

“Boris Johnson’s responsibility is to lead the Foreign Office, not beating the 
drum for his own book sales,” he said. “The Tories should focus on delivering 
for the country, sadly they’re more interested in furthering their own ends.”

Tom Brake, the foreign affairs spokesman for the Lib Dems, said Johnson should 
not be “moonlighting on a taxpayer-funded foreign visit”.

“It is further confirmation that he is wholly unsuited to sit at the cabinet 
table,” he said. “Johnson spent monthslying to us all during the referendum 
campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/boris-johnson-michael-gove-eu-liars>
 and now he can’t even manage to do the hard work of fixing the mess that he 
has put us in.”

Pat McFadden, the former shadow Europe minister, said: “The UK’s reputation is 
on the line at the moment. The post-referendum issues we face are challenging 
and serious. Every minister knows they can’t mix up their public duties with 
their private interests. When the foreign secretary is abroad he should be 
focusing on his job representing the country.”

Since taking on the job, Johnson, the former mayor of London and a leading 
Brexit campaigner, has had a mixed reaction on the international stage, with 
some of his counterparts bemused by the promotion and others reportedly charmed.

He had an uneasy start in the job after he was repeatedly pressed by foreign 
reporters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/boris-johnson-grilled-past-outright-lies-uneasy-press-conference-john-kerry>
 to explain his past “outright lies” andinsults about world leaders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/boris-johnson-life-xenophobic-gaffes>
, including describing the US president as part-Kenyan and hypocritical.

More recently, his approach to Brexit was ridiculed by European ministers 
after he toldItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> it would have to 
offer tariff-free trade in order to sell its prosecco in the UK.


Carlo Calenda, an economics minister, said it was insulting that Johnson had 
told him during a recent meeting that Italy would grant Britain access to the 
EU’s single market “because you don’t want to lose prosecco exports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/european-ministers-boris-johnson-prosecco-claim-brexit>
”.
