Lyon are last in the group with just one point and cannot now qualify for the 
Europa League as they lie five points adrift of third-placed Valencia,who lost 
2-0 at Zenit St Petersburg

 as the Russian side continued their perfect run with one game left. Gent are 
second on seven points, one clear of Valencia, and host Zenit in their final 
group game.

Ferri collected a fine through ball from Rachid Ghezzal before beating Matz 
Sels at the near post in the seventh minute, giving the home fans some hope for 
the club’s last Champions League game at the ground before moving to a new 
59,500-capacity stadium next season.

Sels, however, kept his side afloat 12 minutes later when he denied Alexandre 
Lacazette after the France international had slalomed through the defence.

The visitors equalised when Milicevic curled a superb 20-metre free-kick past 
Anthony Lopes in the 32nd minute, rewarding Gent’s domination.

Lyon had a huge opportunity shortly after the hour but Ghezzal’s strike from 
just inside the box was tipped away by Sels.

Coulibaly wrapped it up for the Belgian side with a header from close range 
from the last corner of the match.
