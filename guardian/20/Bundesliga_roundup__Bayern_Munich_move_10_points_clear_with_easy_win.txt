Bayern Munich went 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> thanks to a routine 
2-0 win over 10-manFreiburg.

The runaway leaders were always in control at the Mage Solar Stadion, with 
Thomas Müller scoring from the spot.

Freiburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/freiburg> then lost Fallou 
Diagne to a red card and, although they battled manfully after that, they were 
eventually finished off by the substitute Anatoliy Tymoshchuk with 11 minutes 
to go.

Bayern's nearest challengers are Bayer Leverkusen, who claimed a fifth victory 
in six games as they won 4-1 atWerder Bremen.

Gonzalo Castro was the star of the show, scoring either side of half-time and, 
even though Nils Petersen pulled one back for the hosts, Simon Rolfes (74) and 
Jens Hegeler (79) put the visitors comfortably out of reach.

Elsewhere, Wolfsburg's recent run of form was ended by Borussia Mönchengladbach
. The Wolves had taken seven points from the last nine, but were beaten 2-0 
thanks to Juan Arango's fine volley and Tony Jantschke's close-range strike.

Augsburg continue to flounder at the bottom, without a win in seven after 
going down 2-1 atStuttgart. Ibrahima Traoré opened the scoring for Stuttgart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stuttgart> early on and, although 
Ja-Cheol Koo levelled on the stroke of half-time, the home side won it through 
Vedad Ibisevic's 69th-minute goal.

Augsburg can look up the table with envy at Nürnburg, who put some distance 
between themselves and the bottom sides with a 4-2 win overHoffenheim.

Hiroshi Kiyotake was impressive, scoring twice, the first in the sixth minute. 
Sven Schipplock equalised but Per Nilsson and Sebastian Polter made it 3-1 by 
the time the clock struck 70 minutes.

Sejad Salihovic converted from the spot to get Hoffenheim back to 3-2, but 
Kiyotake scored his second with four minutes left to wrap things up.
