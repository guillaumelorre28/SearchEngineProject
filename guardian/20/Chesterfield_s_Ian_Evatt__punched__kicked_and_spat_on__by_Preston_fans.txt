The Chesterfield captain, Ian Evatt, has called for more protection for 
players after claiming he was punched, kicked and spat on byPreston North End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/preston> fans after his side’s 3-0 defeat 
in Sunday’s League One play-off semi-final second leg.

Evatt, who played for Preston’s rivals Blackpool between 2006 and 2013, said 
he was attacked after the final whistle at Deepdale as fans invaded the pitch 
to celebratePreston’s 4-0 aggregate victory over Chesterfield

.

“It’s well reported I’m an ex-Blackpool player,” the 33-year-old told BBC 
Radio 5 Live. “After the final whistle the Preston fans invaded the pitch. I 
was gathered around by a couple of hundred fans at least, shouting abuse, 
spitting. I got hit and kicked a couple of times.

“[It was] more than pushing and shoving,” Evatt said. “I’ve reported it to the 
police and Sky Sports have given the police the footage of the two guys who 
threw the punches.

“To be honest, it’s so disappointing. How long will this go on for until 
there’s a real serious incident? It’s too easy for fans nowadays to invade 
football pitches. Something needs to be done about it.

“The more it goes on, the more likely there will be a serious offence and a 
serious injury to a player.”

Evatt also took to Twitter to voice his concerns, calling the scenes at 
Deepdale “a disgrace” while he said he hoped “those responsible are locked up!!”

Crowd-related incidents have become more prevalent in recent months. Aston 
Villa were charged by the FA for failing to prevent spectators encroaching on 
the pitch after beating their Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion in the FA 
Cup sixth round on 7 March.

Following the events at Villa Park, in which 17 men were arrested, West Brom 
expressed their “deep concern” for their players’ safety. Callum McManaman, a 
substitute, had to be restrained by a team-mate from retaliating after being 
provoked by gloating Villa fans.

Reading were also charged for failing to control their fans after a pitch 
invasion in their FA Cup sixth-round win over Bradford in March and riot police 
were deployed at Rotherham in February after Millwall supporters tried to reach 
home fans during their side’s 2-1 defeat. In South Africa on Saturday, a Kaizer 
Chiefs fan was shot dead during a pitch invasion after reportedly trying to 
disarm a police officer.

Preston are yet to comment. They will face Swindon or Sheffield United, who 
play their semi-final second leg on Monday, in theLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> play-off final.

Chesterfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chesterfield> said Evatt 
had given a statement to police over the alleged attack. Inspector Steve 
Bradshaw, of Lancashire Police, said that “while the player was thankfully not 
seriously hurt, police are investigating the assault, including reviewing CCTV 
footage”.

Chesterfield’s assistant manager, Leam Richardson, said Evatt had not been 
hurt in the alleged attack and he also condemned the incident.

“The rivalry, you can’t underestimate that but to lay hands on people as 
supporters and men is a disgrace,” said Richardson. “Ian’s fine. He did not 
react, categorically not. He never reacted. He was surrounded by a few thousand 
but he’s conducted himself very well.

“He’s an emotional kid anyway, Ian, and he’s disappointed with the outcome of 
the two legs. And you are disappointed with the outcome of one or two 
individuals.”
