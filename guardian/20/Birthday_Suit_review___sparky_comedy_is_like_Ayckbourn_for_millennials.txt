Diane (EJ Martin) is nervous when she and her boyfriend Nick (Philip 
Honeywell) arrive at her older colleague Richard’s birthday party in his Canary 
Wharf flat. She has been in her new job in risk management for only a week and 
hasn’t yet figured out the office politics. With no sign of anyone else from 
work, she and Nick are forced to make small talk with Richard, who admits to 
being entirely lacking in passion or charisma. But when Richard’s wife turns 
up, the party gets going with a vengeance.

 Written by David K Barnes, best known for the podcast Wooden Overcoats 
<http://www.woodenovercoats.com/>, about funeral-parlour turf wars, Birthday 
Suit is often very funny. It comes across like Alan Ayckbourn for millennials 
as it investigates ambition, fulfilment and being yourself. Liam Bewley’s 
delightful performance as the nerdish Richard invests a character who could 
just be a cruel figure of fun with an unapologetic, sweet certainty about who 
he is and what he wants while the others get steadily drunker and flail around 
in discontented confusion.

 There is real potential here but, although the laughs keep coming, the play 
runs out of steam and sense of purpose in the second half, and the character of 
Richard’s wife, the posturing Valerie (Emily Stride), is never entirely 
convincing. But it’s a sparky evening, stylishly delivered on a shoestring. The 
Play That Goes Wrong began at this address: who knows what may happen to this?
