There have been few TV shows as divisive as Mrs Brown’s Boys. Some people will 
no doubt say that the BBC has taken leave of its senses in announcing that the 
Irish drag-act sitcom will, later this year, get a chatshow called All Round to 
Mrs Brown’s. But to me, the decision is a reassuring sign that the 
corporation’s entertainment division is in full possession of its faculties 
that seemed in doubt after last week’s launch of the lame Cowell-imitation 
singing contest,Let It Shine

.


Brendan O’Carroll’s Dublin widow has a tradition of polarising people. In 
2011, when it debuted on BBC1, some reviewers were so appalled that they 
predicted the show would be pulled before the end of its first run. In fact, it 
has gone on to regularly attract audiences of 10-12 million, despite having to 
be shown late at night because of frequent words and scenes that breach BBC 
guidelines for prime-time content.

In another stark division between “Wow!” and “How?” reactions, Mrs Brown’s 
Boys was last year votedbest British sitcom of the 21st century

. If a similar survey were conducted among the Guardian audience, it would 
surely struggle to make the top 10,000.

The show’s popularity is as inexplicable to most liberals as the results of 
the EU referendum and the 2016 US election. Agnes Brown is seen – in common with
Nigel Farage

 and Donald Trump – as a throwback to the worst attitudes of the 1970s. In all 
cases, the governing elites can be accused of being out of touch with 
mainstream opinion. There is, however, a crucial distinction within the trio.

Whereas Trump and Farage presumably believe what they say, O’Carroll would 
have no common ground with Agnes Brown in her attitudes to religion and 
sexuality. When Mrs Brown is homophobic or otherwise dim, it is apparent to 
anyone who actually watches the show that her bigotry is being ridiculed rather 
than promoted. Adil Ray’sCitizen Khan, which has been similarly attacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/11/citizen-khan-sadiq-khan-instagram-muslims>
, has an identical defence.

So, if you are running a TV network and you have an act that more than 10 
million people regularly want to see, it makes sense to maximise the 
performer’s visibility. ITV creates various franchises for Ant & Dec, its 
ratings bankers, and BBC1 is trying in the same way to expand the Agnes Brown 
brand.

The type of show chosen is smart too. The chatshow hosted by a fictional 
character has a strong track record. In creating a cross-dressing female who 
says outrageous things, O’Carroll has always acknowledged the great example of 
Barry Humphries, whose Edna Everage is another housewife who became a superstar.

In The Dame Edna Experience, Humphries transformed the talk show by showing 
how an interviewer in disguise has the license to ask questions that would be 
considered impermissibly prurient or rude (ridiculing Jeffrey Archer’s literary 
skills, for instance) if done by an ordinary host. The sight of celebrities 
being required to wear name badges remains one of Humphries’ best jokes about 
the nature of fame, on which Dame Edna has always been a running commentary. In 
their own later talk shows, Mrs Merton and Lily Savage showed that Caroline 
Aherne and Paul O’Grady had also learned from Humphries that a mask gives an 
interviewer armour.

O’Carroll has surely seen such possibilities for his cardiganed avatar. The 
man inside Mrs Brown is a very smart guy with a deep interest in current 
affairs (his mother was a significant figure in Irish politics). Any A or even 
B list star who risks agreeing to tea in Dublin may find that they have a 
surprisingly uncomfortable time. And with All Round to Mrs Brown’s, O’Carroll 
could yet again exceed the expectations of his many detractors.
