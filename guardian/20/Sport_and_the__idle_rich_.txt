 The flying expresses have borne their expectant crowds northwards. Happy folk 
who have given a tone to their system after the fatigues of the London season 
by a fortnight of Cowes and Goodwood, and who, let us hope, by that means have 
become possessed of eyes which are clear as well as 'glad', are awaiting 
impatiently in country mansion and shooting-box the call of tomorrow to the 
moors. Whether the grouse season is about to prove good, average, or bad, no 
one is yet rash enough to prophesy with confidence. Early reports affirmed that 
there was a welcome absence of disease, and the torrential rains and chill of 
the last few weeks came late enough for the young birds to be sufficiently well 
grown to escape the risk of drowning or perishing from cold. So let us hope for 
the best.
Some small proportion of Mr. Lloyd George's 'two million idle rich' will now 
be able to enjoy for five solid months the Briton's alleged favourite pastime 
of 'killing something'. Grouse, deer, partridge, pheasants, wild-duck, to say 
nothing of hares and rabbits, will shake in their shoes over the 'millions of 
acres exclusively devoted to game' which trouble his fervid and poetic soul. We 
wish them 'good hunting'; and good in exact proportion as they are good 
sportsmen...
