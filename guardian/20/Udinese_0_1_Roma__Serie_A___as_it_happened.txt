Well, Roma hang on, but Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> 
can quite rightly feel pretty aggrieved. The decisive goal simply wasn’t all 
the way over the line, while they could quite easily have had two penalties in 
the closing stages. Roma are now level on points with Juventus at the top of 
the table, where they will remain at least until Juve play Inter later tonight.

That was all quite fun, wasn’t it? We could all get used to more football at 
11.30 on Tuesday mornings. Marvellous. Thanks for joining us.

90 mins + 4: Another great chance for Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, as Florenzi finds himself clean 
through, but Karnezis is out quickly and smothers his shot. Should’ve been the 
clincher, there.

90 mins + 2: Close for Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, as 
Florenzi does well to bring the ball down in the area, then feeds Emanuelson, 
but his shot is at the archetypal ‘good height for the keeper’, and Karnezis 
saves.

89 mins: Bodies hit the floor as they wait for the third corner to come over, 
and Torosidis gets a yellow card - although having made that decision, quite 
why a penalty wasn’t given is a mystery. This referee - a Mr Marco Guida - 
might want to make some rather low-key travel plans to get out of here 
unscathed.

88 mins: Close for Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> - 
twice, in fact, in almost identical fashion, as Kone fires a corner into the 
near post, the first is punched out by De Sanctis, the second headed behind by

85 mins: Big, huge shout for a penalty after Kone is felled in the area. 
Emanuelson seemed to get the ball, butUdinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> think he had to go through their 
man’s legs to get there. And you can see their point.

84 mins: Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> come close to 
carving something out again, with Geijo wriggling around to make some space, 
but his backheel isn’t quite good enough and Roma clear.

83 mins: After a decent amount of treatment Ljajic is taken off on a 
stretcher, and goes straight down the tunnel. Former Fulham great Urby 
Emanuelson replaces him.

81 mins: Ach, could be nasty. Ljajic goes to ground with a scream of pain, 
after Pasquale goes through the back of his knee in a fairly big way. He’s not 
happy at all, and doesn’t appear to be faking his pain either. Not even sure 
whether Pasquale was booked for that, and if not that’s scandalous.

78 mins: Some belated purpose from Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>. Pjanic goes close with a shot 
after being teed up on the edge of the area, then Torosidis powers up from 
right-back to shoot from the loose ball, but it’s deflected and loops over the 
bar for a corner.

77 mins: Manolas should be OK to continue. Iturbe gets the ball again and 
drives through the middle, but his low shot is saved rather easily, then Ljajic 
is flagged offside as he goes for the rebound.

75 mins: The TV commentator is sticking to his story that the goal was given 
legitimately. Meanwhile, Iturbe runs a bit then crosses to no-one. Some things 
truly do never change.

72 mins: The penalty area very briefly looks like a minefield as a couple of 
players throw themselves into the air/onto the ground with little apparent 
encouragement. De Rossi comes out laughing by being the one to boot the ball 
clear, though.

70 mins: Ooof, Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> aren’t 
helping themselves. They work a nice chance with some neat passing in the Roma 
area, but with a man in space on the left, Kone decides to spin and volley 
towards goal, a term that I use rather loosely.

66 mins: Double change for Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> - 
Maicon, who has been an entertaining hot mess for most of the game, is hooked, 
with Vasilis Torosidis replacing him, while Totti makes way for the younger 
legs of Alessandro Florenzi.

65 mins: Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> attack again down 
the right, it’s fed inside to Totti and all he needs to do is slip a simple 
pass left for Pjanic, but it’s just too short and Danilo is there to tackle and 
clear.

63 mins: Oh, that would’ve been delightful. Allan dances through a couple of 
challenges outside the Roma box, but just as he’s pulling his foot back to 
shoot Astori dives in with a last-ditch, vital challenge. Nearly something 
rather special fromUdinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese>, 
there.

62 mins: Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> nearly get 
through after Maicon is given a hospital pass and is thus caught out of 
position, but Di Natale can’t quite bring the thing under control to shoot, and 
his attempted cross from the right side of the area is headed clear.

57 mins: Maicon’s idea of a pass seems to be just hammering the thing directly 
at the player in question, which he does this time with little success, at 
Totti. And if he can’t bring the thing under, then one suspects nobody could. 
Perhaps he’s inspired by Patches O’Houlihan...

54 mins: Iturbe buzzes across the pitch from right to left, then feeds Ljajic 
out on the left, who does the tricky stuff well by skipping past a defender 
then just keeping the ball in, but whiffs his next touch, a relatively 
straightforward control, and it dribbles out.

52 mins: Yellow card for Pjanic, who has been pushing his luck for most of the 
game. You’d say he couldn’t complain after booting Kone in the calf, but he’s 
proving that statement wrong, and at some length too.

50 mins: Ha! Absolutely outrageous, flamboyant dive by hardman De Rossi in his 
own area, under the very faintest of brushes on his arm by Geijo, but he still 
wins the free-kick. It’s just Roma’s day, it seems.

49 mins: Nearly a chance for Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> as Astori heads the ball back to 
De Sanctis with Di Natale lurking, but it eventually makes it back to the Roma 
keeper. Still, the last time Astori, the ball not going over the line and this 
ref combined a goal was given, so who knows what might happen.

48 mins: Second-half so far: lots of sideways passing, not much to get excited 
about. It is quite weird that for 80% of the time you can’t see any fans, what 
with two sides of the ground being a building site, but you can hear them 
singing.

Some half-time reading, since you’re in a European football sort of mood. 
Here’s Phillipe Auclair on Marseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/06/marseille-ultras-rule-temptation-never-far-away>
, France’s wildest club...

At any other stadium in the world, is there a stand named after a fan? Take a 
seat in the virage Nord of Stade Vélodrome in Marseille and you’ll find 
yourself in the Tribune Patrice de Péretti. There you’ll be surrounded by the 
3,000 members of Marseille’s most raucous, intimidating Ultras: MTP, for
Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> Trop Puissant 
(“Marseille, all powerful”). De Péretti, or Depé, was their founder, their 
talisman, their bare-chested hero. Olympique de Marseille’s club scarf loosely 
knotted around his neck, megaphone in hand, exploding flares punctuating his 
exhortations to the crowd, he stood as a reminder of his club’s uniqueness in 
the usually placid landscape of French football – mad, bad, and sometimes 
dangerous.

The same could be said of the city itself, as the first-time visitor senses as 
soon as he exits the monumental Saint Charles station, built in 1848 on a 
promontory that oversees a vast carapace of plum-and-custard roofs. Life here 
bubbles and sizzles like in no other city in France. It is a bewitching mess, 
both ancient (the Greek Massalia was founded in the 6th century BC) and 
thrillingly young. Marseille – the age-old door to the Mediterranean populated 
by migrants, refugees, hoods, and fishermen – speaks and sings with a voice not 
everyone finds pleasant. It is strident and speaks out of turn; cacophonous, 
not fugal.

The city is home to France’s craziest club, and it couldn’t be otherwise. The 
Marseillais wouldn’t have it any other way. “Proud to be Marseillais” is a 
popular slogan here. Eric Cantona, who grew up in one of the town’s inner 
villages, was happy to display it on a T-shirt despite his falling out with the 
OM fans when his rebelliousness set him on a collision course with the club’s 
hierarchy in the late 1980s. AMarseillais is a Frenchman, true. But France will 
always come a distant second in the loyalty stakes.

Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> are quite correctly 
rather cross to be going in behind - not that they deserve it, they’ve been 
pretty rubbish, but because the goal simply should not have stood. The whole of 
the ball wasn’t over the line, which should probably be a rather simple concept 
to grasp, but apparently not for some, including the bloke commentating on the 
telly.

45 mins: A minute of added time, which seems a tad stingy given the hi-jinx 
earlier in the half. Maicon goes into the book for a cynical block on the 
halfway line.

43 mins: A shot from Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese>, 
which is something of a rare event. The ball breaks back to Guilherme about 30 
yards out, but he hoys the effort over the bar.

42 mins: James Elliott raises a salient point about Roma’s midfield options: 
‘I don’t understand all the fuss about Strootman, Nainggolan (on the bench 
today) is a much better player. They both have physical defects though, 
Strootman doesn’t seem to have a right foot and Nainggolan has an utterly 
ridiculous haircut.’

De Rossi is lucky to escape a booking after booting Kone in the thigh. Perhaps 
the ref is scared of him.

37 mins: Neither side has really got going since the goal. Udinese again build 
half an attack that breaks down before it reaches the area, Roma counter with 
one that fizzles out somewhere in theUdinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> half.

Well, Roma hang on, but Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> 
can quite rightly feel pretty aggrieved. The decisive goal simply wasn’t all 
the way over the line, while they could quite easily have had two penalties in 
the closing stages. Roma are now level on points with Juventus at the top of 
the table, where they will remain at least until Juve play Inter later tonight.

That was all quite fun, wasn’t it? We could all get used to more football at 
11.30 on Tuesday mornings. Marvellous. Thanks for joining us.

 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.

 
90 mins + 5: One final chance for Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese>, from a corner, which Kone 
swings over from the left...but De Sanctis claims among a phalanx of competing 
heads.

 
90 mins + 4: Another great chance for Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, as Florenzi finds himself clean 
through, but Karnezis is out quickly and smothers his shot. Should’ve been the 
clincher, there.

 
90 mins + 2: Close for Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, as 
Florenzi does well to bring the ball down in the area, then feeds Emanuelson, 
but his shot is at the archetypal ‘good height for the keeper’, and Karnezis 
saves.

 
90 mins: Five minutes of added time. 

 
89 mins: Bodies hit the floor as they wait for the third corner to come over, 
and Torosidis gets a yellow card - although having made that decision, quite 
why a penalty wasn’t given is a mystery. This referee - a Mr Marco Guida - 
might want to make some rather low-key travel plans to get out of here 
unscathed.

 
88 mins: Close for Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> - 
twice, in fact, in almost identical fashion, as Kone fires a corner into the 
near post, the first is punched out by De Sanctis, the second headed behind by 
Astori.

 
85 mins: Big, huge shout for a penalty after Kone is felled in the area. 
Emanuelson seemed to get the ball, butUdinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> think he had to go through their 
man’s legs to get there. And you can see their point.

 
84 mins: Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> come close to 
carving something out again, with Geijo wriggling around to make some space, 
but his backheel isn’t quite good enough and Roma clear.

 
83 mins: After a decent amount of treatment Ljajic is taken off on a 
stretcher, and goes straight down the tunnel. Former Fulham great Urby 
Emanuelson replaces him.

 
81 mins: Ach, could be nasty. Ljajic goes to ground with a scream of pain, 
after Pasquale goes through the back of his knee in a fairly big way. He’s not 
happy at all, and doesn’t appear to be faking his pain either. Not even sure 
whether Pasquale was booked for that, and if not that’s scandalous.

 
80 mins: Sub for Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> - 
Guilherme departs Bruno Fernandes enters.

 
79 mins: Said corner is curled in from the left, but Karnezis ambles off his 
line to catch it, under little challenge.

 
78 mins: Some belated purpose from Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>. Pjanic goes close with a shot 
after being teed up on the edge of the area, then Torosidis powers up from 
right-back to shoot from the loose ball, but it’s deflected and loops over the 
bar for a corner.

 
77 mins: Manolas should be OK to continue. Iturbe gets the ball again and 
drives through the middle, but his low shot is saved rather easily, then Ljajic 
is flagged offside as he goes for the rebound.

 
76 mins: Oooh, nasty that. Manolas and Thereau clash heads in mid-air, the Roma
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> man seemingly coming off worse. If 
this was a cartoon, there would be little birds flying above his head.

 
75 mins: The TV commentator is sticking to his story that the goal was given 
legitimately. Meanwhile, Iturbe runs a bit then crosses to no-one. Some things 
truly do never change.

 
72 mins: The penalty area very briefly looks like a minefield as a couple of 
players throw themselves into the air/onto the ground with little apparent 
encouragement. De Rossi comes out laughing by being the one to boot the ball 
clear, though.

 
71 mins: Astori gets a booking after being thoroughly mugged off by Allan, to 
which he reacts by pulling theUdinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> man down in the corner.

 
70 mins: Ooof, Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> aren’t 
helping themselves. They work a nice chance with some neat passing in the Roma 
area, but with a man in space on the left, Kone decides to spin and volley 
towards goal, a term that I use rather loosely.

 
68 mins: Copycats Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> make 
a double change, too. Di Natale is replaced by Cyril Thereau, while Silva goes 
off and Giovanni Pasquale is on.

 
66 mins: Double change for Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> - 
Maicon, who has been an entertaining hot mess for most of the game, is hooked, 
with Vasilis Torosidis replacing him, while Totti makes way for the younger 
legs of Alessandro Florenzi.

 
65 mins: Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> attack again down 
the right, it’s fed inside to Totti and all he needs to do is slip a simple 
pass left for Pjanic, but it’s just too short and Danilo is there to tackle and 
clear.

 
64 mins: Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> counter and Maicon 
finds himself in a shooting position, but his effort is low and a bit weak and 
is saved.

 
63 mins: Oh, that would’ve been delightful. Allan dances through a couple of 
challenges outside the Roma box, but just as he’s pulling his foot back to 
shoot Astori dives in with a last-ditch, vital challenge. Nearly something 
rather special fromUdinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese>, 
there.

 
62 mins: Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> nearly get 
through after Maicon is given a hospital pass and is thus caught out of 
position, but Di Natale can’t quite bring the thing under control to shoot, and 
his attempted cross from the right side of the area is headed clear.

 
60 mins: Both teams struggling to really create anything here. Resulting in a 
rather frustrating old game thus far.

 
57 mins: Maicon’s idea of a pass seems to be just hammering the thing directly 
at the player in question, which he does this time with little success, at 
Totti. And if he can’t bring the thing under, then one suspects nobody could. 
Perhaps he’s inspired by Patches O’Houlihan...
 
54 mins: Iturbe buzzes across the pitch from right to left, then feeds Ljajic 
out on the left, who does the tricky stuff well by skipping past a defender 
then just keeping the ball in, but whiffs his next touch, a relatively 
straightforward control, and it dribbles out.

 
52 mins: Yellow card for Pjanic, who has been pushing his luck for most of the 
game. You’d say he couldn’t complain after booting Kone in the calf, but he’s 
proving that statement wrong, and at some length too.

 
50 mins: Ha! Absolutely outrageous, flamboyant dive by hardman De Rossi in his 
own area, under the very faintest of brushes on his arm by Geijo, but he still 
wins the free-kick. It’s just Roma’s day, it seems.

 
49 mins: Nearly a chance for Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> as Astori heads the ball back to 
De Sanctis with Di Natale lurking, but it eventually makes it back to the Roma 
keeper. Still, the last time Astori, the ball not going over the line and this 
ref combined a goal was given, so who knows what might happen.

 
48 mins: Second-half so far: lots of sideways passing, not much to get excited 
about. It is quite weird that for 80% of the time you can’t see any fans, what 
with two sides of the ground being a building site, but you can hear them 
singing.

 
46 mins: The teams are out, the sun is shining, the referee is a buffoon and 
we’re playing football again.

 
Some half-time reading, since you’re in a European football sort of mood. 
Here’s Phillipe Auclair on Marseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/06/marseille-ultras-rule-temptation-never-far-away>
, France’s wildest club...

At any other stadium in the world, is there a stand named after a fan? Take a 
seat in the virage Nord of Stade Vélodrome in Marseille and you’ll find 
yourself in the Tribune Patrice de Péretti. There you’ll be surrounded by the 
3,000 members of Marseille’s most raucous, intimidating Ultras: MTP, for
Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> Trop Puissant 
(“Marseille, all powerful”). De Péretti, or Depé, was their founder, their 
talisman, their bare-chested hero. Olympique de Marseille’s club scarf loosely 
knotted around his neck, megaphone in hand, exploding flares punctuating his 
exhortations to the crowd, he stood as a reminder of his club’s uniqueness in 
the usually placid landscape of French football – mad, bad, and sometimes 
dangerous.

The same could be said of the city itself, as the first-time visitor senses as 
soon as he exits the monumental Saint Charles station, built in 1848 on a 
promontory that oversees a vast carapace of plum-and-custard roofs. Life here 
bubbles and sizzles like in no other city in France. It is a bewitching mess, 
both ancient (the Greek Massalia was founded in the 6th century BC) and 
thrillingly young. Marseille – the age-old door to the Mediterranean populated 
by migrants, refugees, hoods, and fishermen – speaks and sings with a voice not 
everyone finds pleasant. It is strident and speaks out of turn; cacophonous, 
not fugal.

The city is home to France’s craziest club, and it couldn’t be otherwise. The 
Marseillais wouldn’t have it any other way. “Proud to be Marseillais” is a 
popular slogan here. Eric Cantona, who grew up in one of the town’s inner 
villages, was happy to display it on a T-shirt despite his falling out with the 
OM fans when his rebelliousness set him on a collision course with the club’s 
hierarchy in the late 1980s. AMarseillais is a Frenchman, true. But France will 
always come a distant second in the loyalty stakes.

Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> are quite correctly 
rather cross to be going in behind - not that they deserve it, they’ve been 
pretty rubbish, but because the goal simply should not have stood. The whole of 
the ball wasn’t over the line, which should probably be a rather simple concept 
to grasp, but apparently not for some, including the bloke commentating on the 
telly.

 
And that’s the break.

 
45 mins: A minute of added time, which seems a tad stingy given the hi-jinx 
earlier in the half. Maicon goes into the book for a cynical block on the 
halfway line.

 
43 mins: A shot from Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese>, 
which is something of a rare event. The ball breaks back to Guilherme about 30 
yards out, but he hoys the effort over the bar.

 
42 mins: James Elliott raises a salient point about Roma’s midfield options: 
‘I don’t understand all the fuss about Strootman, Nainggolan (on the bench 
today) is a much better player. They both have physical defects though, 
Strootman doesn’t seem to have a right foot and Nainggolan has an utterly 
ridiculous haircut.’

De Rossi is lucky to escape a booking after booting Kone in the thigh. Perhaps 
the ref is scared of him.

 
39 mins: The other thing about the goal is, contrary to what I assumed at the 
time, is that it seemed to be given by the referee, somewhere near the edge of 
the penalty area, rather than the extra official who was around five yards 
away. Weird, but that would certainly explain it - from the front it looked in, 
from the side it didn.

 
38 mins: Oh, there’s one that goes a bit further. Iturbe breaks at pace down 
the right, and squares to Totti in the box whose shot is half-blocked by 
Danilo, and it’s easily saved. That block did neither attacker nor defender 
many favours, both down feeling something iffy from the collision.

 
37 mins: Neither side has really got going since the goal. Udinese again build 
half an attack that breaks down before it reaches the area, Roma counter with 
one that fizzles out somewhere in theUdinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> half.
