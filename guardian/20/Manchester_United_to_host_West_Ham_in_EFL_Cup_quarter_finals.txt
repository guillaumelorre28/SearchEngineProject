Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
will host West Ham in the stand-out tie of the EFL Cup quarter-finals, meaning 
that they will face each other twice at Old Trafford in a matter of days.

Slaven Bilic’s side are already scheduled to face United in Manchester on 
Sunday 27 November and, with all last-eight ties to be played in the week 
commencing Monday 28 November, the likelihood is that they will return within 
three days of the first fixture, probably on Wednesday 30 November. It will be 
the first time the sides have met in this competition since the same stage in 
2010, when the Hammers won 4-0 at Upton Park.

 at the same stage.

Liverpool face Leeds United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited> 
at Anfield in another appetising fixture. The last they met at any level was in 
a third-round tie at Elland Road in September 2009, David Ngog scoring the only 
goal for the Premier League side.

The second all-Premier League tie will see Arsenal face Southampton at the 
Emirates Stadium in a rerun of the third-round meeting of September 2014, when 
the Saints won 2-1 in north London. The other quarter-final sends Championship 
leadersNewcastle United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> 
to play at Hull City, who are 18th in the Premier League.
