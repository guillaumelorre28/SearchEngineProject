The French league (LFP) has contacted the Italian authorities to investigate 
the legitimacy of the dual-nationality passports held by Argentinian players in 
Ligue 1, an LFP source told Reuters.

Passports belonging to Bordeaux's Fernando Cavenaghi and Diego Placente, 
Toulouse's Mauro Cetto and Olympique Marseille's Renato Civelli, who all have 
dual Italian nationality, were being looked at, said the source, who declined 
to be named.

"The French League has contacted the Italian consulate in Paris and asked them 
to bring the matter to the Italian authorities," the source explained.

"There are suspicions of false passports in Ligue 1. For us, the passports are 
valid, they were validated by the league, but anticipating possible protests at 
the end of the season, we contacted the Italian authorities."

Toulouse <https://www.theguardian.com/football/toulouse> said that Cetto's 
Italian nationality was fully justified. "His grandparents, on his mother's and 
father's side, are Italian and the player, according to Italian laws, benefits 
from the Italian nationality," a statement from the club said.

The other clubs concerned were not available for comment.

Four non-European Union players are allowed per squad in Ligue 1, while a 
dual-nationality Italian passport would allow an Argentinian to be listed as an 
EU player. The French top flight was hit by a false passports scandal in 2001, 
with St-Etienne being docked seven points because they were found guilty of 
fielding non-European players with European Union passports.
