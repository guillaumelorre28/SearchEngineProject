It is fascinating to see how modern theatre has rescued these once-despised 
plays.Harold Bloom in Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human 
<http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01shapirt.html> dismisses 
them, saying "they do not live now except for the triad of Joan, Jack Cade and 
Richard". A pity Bloom doesn't live in Britain where he could have seen at 
least five productions that made an iron-clad case for the trilogy. Peter Hall 
and John Barton adapted the plays inThe Wars of the Roses 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kriqGGnJ5A> (1963) and Adrian Noble did a 
siimilar trimming for The Plantagenets (1988). ButTerry Hands 
<http://www.alanhoward.org.uk/henry6.htm> (1977) and Michael Bogdanov (1987) 
gave us the complete trilogy.

Best of all, however, was Michael Boyd's much-revived 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/aug/11/theatre.rsc> RSC staging (2000). 
Boyd compared the plays to a mix of War and Peace, The Sopranos and the Bible. 
He gave us a compelling portrait of an England spiralling into chaos, made 
great use of vertical descents on ropes, bridges and steel platforms and ended 
with an unforgettable image: Jonathan Slinger's Richard, Duke of Gloucester, 
cradling his infant nephew in his arms suggesting he might not be the world's 
best babysitter. Great theatre that proved these plays are central to an 
understanding of Shakespeare.
