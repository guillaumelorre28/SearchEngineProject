The club had been searching for Tony Humes’s successor since he left by mutual 
consent last month

and Keen watched the Essex club take on Rochdale with chairman Robbie Cowling 
on Saturday, an away match they lost 3-1.

The appointment sees 48-year-old Keen take on his first full managerial role 
following caretaker positions at West Ham and Macclesfield in recent years. 
Keen has also been first-team coach at Liverpool in 2011-12 and was assistant 
manager to Steve Clarke at Reading, a position he was sacked from earlier this 
month.

The club confirmed on Twitter: “ColU are delighted to welcome Kevin Keen as 
the club’s new manager.”

The caretaker manager Wayne Brown had previously said he would be interested 
in the role permanently but ruled himself out of the process last week after 
speaking with the chairman.

Colchester are currently bottom of League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> and have not won a 
game in the league since 20 October despite getting through to the second round 
of the FA Cup where they will face Championship side Charlton.

Keen’s first game in charge will be the Essex derby against Southend on Boxing 
Day.
