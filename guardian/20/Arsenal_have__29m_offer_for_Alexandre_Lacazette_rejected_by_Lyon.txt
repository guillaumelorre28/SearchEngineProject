“Arsenal made an offer of €35m which Lyon didn’t accept for one reason alone – 
we will keep Alexandre Lacazette,” read a statement released by the club.

Arsenal failed in their attempts to sign another striker, Jamie Vardy

, earlier this summer when the England international opted to stay at Leicester 
City. The Gunners are reportedly ready to spend up to £75m in a double move for 
Lacazette and Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez, but Lyon are determined to keep their 
star player. Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone has scored more goals in Ligue 1 over the 
past three seasons and Lacazette, a converted winger, is thought to be nearing 
his prime.

“Lacazette is one of the main leaders of Bruno Genesio’s squad,” Lyon’s 
statement continued. “We categorically deny having received an offer of €48m 
[£40.2m] from Arsenal for him, as has been reported.”

Lacazette has been linked with a number of big clubs since scoring 27 league 
goals in the 2014-15 season and is thought to be keen on a move to the Emirates 
Stadium, but Lyon’s financial difficulties are behind them and they are not 
compelled to sell.
