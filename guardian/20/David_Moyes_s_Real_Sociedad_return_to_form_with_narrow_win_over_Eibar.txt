Real Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> returned to 
form thanks to Xabi Prieto’s goal in the second half that sealed victory over 
Eibar in La Liga.

The result was a welcome three points for David Moyes after last weekend’s 
late home loss to Rayo Vallecano.

Sociedad started brightly and mustered the better of the early chances. Prieto 
headed Carlos Vela’s free-kick just wide in the seventh minute.

The Sociedad goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli had to be alert in the 32nd minute to 
keep out a Saul blast, but that – along with a comfortable save from Mikel 
Arruabarrena shortly after – was all that was required of him in the first half.

Ten minutes into the second period Prieto headed Rubén Pardo’s corner into the 
top-right corner.
