converting a 57th-minute penalty.

Steve Bruce named an entirely different starting lineup to that which sent 
Hull back to the top of the Championship last week. The League One side gave 
them an early scare as Danny Mayor laid off for Danny Rose, whose low strike 
was saved by Eldin Jakupovic. But Adama Diomandé then played in David Meyler 
and, although his effort was saved by Ian Lawlor, Akpom turned in the rebound.

Meyler then had a header cleared off the line by Rose, while Sone Aluko and 
Ahmed Elmohamady also went close for the visitors.

Bury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bury> replied with Rose and Tom 
Pope heading off target and, just after the break, they made a double 
substitution. Ryan Lowe had a goal disallowed from his first touch and that 
proved a crucial moment as Hull went straight up the other end to win a penalty.

Aluko was tripped by Chris Hussey and sidefooted the spot-kick into the bottom 
corner. Meyler then found Akpom and he cut back on to his right foot to fire 
high past Lawlor for the third.

But Bury salvaged some pride when Jones volleyed in from Mayor’s late cross.
