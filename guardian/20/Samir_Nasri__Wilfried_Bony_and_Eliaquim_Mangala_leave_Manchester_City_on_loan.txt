Nasri, who joined City from Arsenal in the summer of 2011 for around £25m, 
signed forSevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla>. The 
29-year-old Frenchman fell out of favour under Pep Guardiola after the

This came despite Nasri stating he had been keen to impress Guardiola after 
shiningagainst West Bromwich Albion on his comeback 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/09/manchester-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report>
 from a long-term thigh injury in April. “When the pre-season is going to start 
I am going to be fresh, so I hope that will help me and I will try to perform 
because when you have been out for so long you are more hungry when you come 
back,” he said. “You don’t want to waste your time. You want to be back with a 
bang.”

However, on joining Sevilla, Nasri signalled an acceptance his City career may 
be over whentweeting <https://twitter.com/SamNasri19/status/770974510925418496>
: “It’s been a pleasure – thanks to everyone in the club and the fans for the 
amazing five years and wish you best of luck for the season.” Sevilla said the 
deal did not include an option to buy the former Arsenal player.

Mangala, a Premier League record £42m purchase for a defender from Porto two 
years ago, moved toValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, 
despite the Portuguese club’s interest in re-signing the 25-year-old.

Mangala tweeted a picture of himself pointing to the Valencia badge and next 
to the club’s roll of honours, saying: “Amunt Valencia”, meaning “Go Valencia”.

The striker Bony, a £25m buy from Swansea City in January 2015

, has joined Stoke City whileHart completed his move to Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/joe-hart-torino-excited-test-serie-a-transfer-window-manchester-city>
. The 29-year-old England goalkeeper was forced into the move to the Serie A 
club by his sudden demotion to the third in line for a starting place at the 
Etihad Stadium.

Willy Caballero, the Argentinian who succeeded Hart as the first choice before 
Claudio Bravo arrived from Barcelona last week, tweeted: “All the best to my 
friend in this new step in his career.”

Jason Denayer became the seventh City player to go on loan, with the 
21-year-old central defender joining Sunderland. Earlier Shay Facey, a 
21-year-old defender, joined the Dutch club Heerenveen for the season and 
League One Bury recruited Kean Bryan, a 19-year-old midfielder until May.
