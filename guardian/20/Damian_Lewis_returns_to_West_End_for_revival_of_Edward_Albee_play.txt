.

Lewis will play Martin, an esteemed architect whose wife and teenage son 
struggle to come to terms with the news that he is in love with a goat named 
Sylvia. The part was played by Bill Pullman when the show ran on Broadway in 
2002 and byJonathan Pryce at the Almeida in London in 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/feb/04/theatre3>. The play won Albee a 
Tony award, a Drama Desk award and the Pulitzer prize for drama.

Speaking to Interview magazine in 2002 
<http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/new-again-edward-albee/#_>, Albee 
said of the play: “What can I tell you about it? It’s one long act, three 
scenes, four characters and a goat … There’s a real goat and also a person who 
becomes a scapegoat. It is a play that seems to be one thing at the beginning, 
but the chasm opens as we go further into it. And I think it is going to shock 
and disgust a number of people. With any luck, there will be people standing 
up, shaking their fists during the performance and throwing things at the 
stage. I hope so!”

The production, directed by Ian Rickson, has a 12-week run and begins previews 
on 24 March 2017. The official opening night is 5 April.
