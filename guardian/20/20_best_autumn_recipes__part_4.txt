J Sheekey’s cod with braised lentils and prosciutto by Tim Hughes 

Prosciutto or bacon are the perfect accompaniment to pulses.

Serves 4
parma ham 4 thin slices
cod 4 x 180g fillets
sunflower oil for frying
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the lentils
puy lentils 250g
extra virgin olive oil 40ml
prosciutto 100g, thick, diced (ask your deli for the end of the ham)
onion 1, finely diced
carrot 1, finely diced
leek 1, finely diced
celery 1 stick, finely diced
garlic 2 cloves, peeled and crushed
thyme 2 sprigs, leaves removed and chopped
rosemary 2 sprigs, leaves removed and chopped
chicken stock 1 litre
unsalted butter 30g
flat-leaf parsley ½ small bunch, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Spread the parma ham out onto a baking 
dish and cook in the oven until crisp. This should take around 20 minutes, but 
keep a watchful eye so that they don’t dry out too much. Keep to one side.

Soak the puy lentils in cold water for an hour.

Pour 20ml of olive oil into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and gently cook the 
chopped prosciutto, onion, carrot, leek, celery, garlic, thyme and rosemary for 
5 minutes. Add the drained lentils, stir and then add the chicken stock (a good 
quality cube is fine). Bring to the boil and simmer until the lentils are soft 
to taste but not mushy. This should take around 20 minutes but taste to check. 
The consistency should be sauce-like. Retain the cooked lentils to one side.

Heat a non-stick frying pan. Add olive oil. Season the cod and gently cook 
skin side down for 5 minutes. Turn over and cook for a further 3 to 4 minutes.

To serve, reheat the lentils and gently stir in the butter and parsley, and 
season. Spoon the lentils onto warm plates, place the cod on top and garnish 
with the crispy parma ham.

 Braised chicken with chestnuts Photograph: Chris Terry 
Chestnuts are one of China’s native crops and have been cultivated there for 
millennia. They are grown in many parts of the country, but particularly in the 
north, where they are used in soups, stews and stir-fries, or ground into flour 
for breads and sweetmeats. Chicken and chestnuts are a classic Chinese 
combination.

One September morning, I drove out with my friend A Dai into the Zhejiang 
countryside, through a lush greenness of paddy fields, bamboo groves and lotus 
ponds, into the teabushed hills. Up a rough track we left the van and walked 
out into the twittering, humming undergrowth. A little further and there was an 
orchard of chestnut trees, where we plucked the prickly fruits and peeled open 
and ate, raw, some of the crunchy young nuts. Later, back at A Dai’s 
restaurant, we tasted more of them, stir-fried with ginger and the meat of a 
young chicken, a tender dish that can only be enjoyed early in the chestnut 
season. When the nuts are plumper and more mature, they find their way into 
braises such as this, perfect for a winter’s evening. In China, this would be 
made with a whole chicken, chopped up on the bone, but this quick version is 
made with boneless meat. Prepare it in advance if you like and reheat just in 
time for your meal.

Serves 2 with rice
chicken thighs 4, boneless (about 350g)
ginger 20g, unpeeled
spring onions 2, white and green parts separated
cooking oil 3 tbsp
Shaoxing wine 1½ tbsp
chicken stock or water 300ml
brown or caster sugar 1 tbsp
dark soy sauce 1 ½ tsp
chestnuts 200g, cooked and peeled (canned or vacuum-packed)
salt

Cut the chicken thighs evenly into bite-sized chunks. Crush the ginger and 
spring onion whites slightly with the side of a cleaver blade or a rolling pin. 
Cut the spring onion greens into neat 4cm lengths.


Heat the oil in a seasoned wok over a high flame. When it is hot, add the 
ginger and spring onion whites and stir-fry until you can smell their 
fragrance. Then add the chicken pieces and fry over a high heat until they are 
lightly browned: don’t move them around too much, but let them rest against the 
base of the wok so they have the chance to take on a little colour. Drain off 
some of the excess fat at this stage if you wish. Splash in the Shaoxing wine 
and stir well. Then tip in all the stock.

Bring the stock to a boil and add the sugar, soy sauce and chestnuts, with 
salt to taste (¾ tsp should do). Then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 
about 15 minutes to allow the chicken to cook through and the chestnuts to 
absorb some of the flavours of the sauce, stirring from time to time.

Increase the heat to reduce the liquid if you wish and adjust the seasoning if 
necessary. At the last minute, add the spring onion greens, cover for just a 
moment to let them feel the heat, then serve.

To cook and peel your own chestnuts, slice off the bases of the raw chestnuts 
and blanch them in boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain. When cool 
enough to handle, remove their shells and inner skins as far as possible.

 Braised kid with squash, tamarind and chickpeas. Photograph: andy sewell 
Goat is an underused meat with a wonderful rich, almost earthy, flavour. I 
like the legs and shoulders best – slowly braised with spices until meltingly 
tender and falling apart. If kid is difficult to find, you can substitute lamb 
– the flavour is not dissimilar.

Serves 4-6
shoulder of kid 1, about 4kg
olive oil 1-2 tbsp
dry white wine 300ml
garlic 1 bulb, halved horizontally
bay leaves 4-6
dried chilli 1, roughly chopped
cinnamon 2 sticks
star anise 3
chickpeas 250g, cooked jarred or good quality tinned, drained
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the squash
winter squash 1 (onion squash is my favourite)
cumin seeds ½ ts
nigella seeds ½ tsp
mustard seeds ½ tsp
coriander seeds ½ tsp
dried chilli flakes ½ tsp
tamarind paste 2 tbsp
honey 1 tsp
lime juice of ½
olive oil 4 tbsp

To serve
Greek-style yogurt 200g
garlic 2 cloves, peeled and crushed
lime juice of 1
herb leaves sage, marjoram and/or parsley
extra virgin olive oil to trickle

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Place a large frying pan over a medium 
heat. Season the meat well with salt and pepper. When the pan is hot, add the 
olive oil, then the meat and brown well on all sides, turning as necessary.


Transfer the meat to a roasting tin. Pour on the wine, add the garlic and 
scatter over the bay leaves, dried chilli, cinnamon and star anise. Cover the 
tin with foil, sealing well. Cook in the middle of the oven for 3½ hours, 
turning the meat once or twice, until tender and falling from the bone. Uncover 
and leave until cool enough to handle, then lift the meat onto a board and 
remove the bones.

Return the meat to the roasting tin and add the chickpeas. Re-cover with the 
foil and return to the oven for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, to prepare the squash, halve lengthways, scoop out the seeds, then 
slice into wedges and place in a bowl. Toast the spice seeds in a small dry 
frying pan over a medium heat. As soon as they begin to pop, take off the heat. 
Pound the toasted spices finely with the dried chilli flakes, using a pestle 
and mortar.

For the dressing, put the tamarind paste in a bowl, add the ground spices, 
honey, lime juice, olive oil and a good pinch of salt, and stir well to combine.

Spoon the dressing over the squash and toss to coat the wedges. Transfer them 
to a roasting tray, cover with foil and place in the oven alongside the meat 
for the last 35 minutes of its roasting time.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the yogurt with the garlic, lime juice and a 
good pinch of salt.

Check the squash is tender by piercing with a knife. Arrange the meat, squash 
and chickpeas on warm plates and add a spoonful of yogurt. Scatter over the 
herbs and finish with a trickle of extra virgin olive oil.

 Plum crisp: ‘only needs the merest whiff of cinnamon’. Photograph: Jonathan 
Lovekin 
I have made this with apples, plums and damson – all divine. But I insist on 
cream or ice-cream with it. That biting coldness is essential with 
mouth-scalding hot fruit. If you are using damson, I suggest you add a 
tablespoon or so of sugar to the fruit. Oh, and you really do need only the 
merest whiff of cinnamon.

Enough for 6
ripe plums, greengages or damsons 1kg
ground cinnamon a knife point
soft white bread 125g
light muscavado sugar 75g
butter 75g
vanilla ice-cream or double cream to serve

Set the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Cut the plums in half and remove their 
stones. Drop the fruit into a buttered pudding basin or shallow casserole and 
toss very gently with the ground cinnamon.

Whizz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor. You don’t want them to be 
too fine – more of a soft rubble than a fine sand. Mix the breadcrumbs and 
sugar and cover the plums loosely with the mixture. Melt the butter in a small 
pan, then pour it over the crumbs, making certain to soak them all. Bake for 35 
minutes, till the plums are soft and melting and the crumbs on top are golden 
and crisp.

 Rice pudding with honey and bay Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
Bay leaf, the traditional flavouring for junket, is just as good in a 
slow-cooked rice pudding sweetened with honey. Bay leaves also discourage 
insects, so when storing winter woollies, tuck a sprig or two in the folds to 
keep away the moths.

Serves 4
pudding rice 100g
full-cream milk 1 litre
butter 50g, diced small
honey 4 tbsp
bay leaf 1

Preheat the oven to 140C/gas mark 1. Put all the ingredients in a shallow 
ovenproof dish and stir them up. Bake for 3½ hours, stirring every hour, but 
leaving it to form a skin in the final hour.
