Domenico Berardi converted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time on 
Sunday to give Sassuolo a shock 1-0 win at the Serie A leaders,Internazionale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale>, who dominated the match 
but were repeatedly foiled by the visitors’ goalkeeper, Andrea Consigli.

Berardi sent the Inter goalkeeper, Samir Handanovic, the wrong way to complete 
an extraordinary win for Sassuolo, who were beaten 7-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/14/icardi-inter-hat-trick-napoli-lose-serie-a>
 in the same fixture last season, as Inter’s coach Roberto Mancini watched in 
disbelief.

The penalty was awarded after the Inter defender Jeisson Murillo mistimed a 
header, then his team-mate Miranda clumsily bundled over Grégoire Defrel as the 
hosts made a pig’s ear of dealing with a seemingly innocuousSassuolo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sassuolo> attack.

Inter missed a flurry of early chances and when Adem Ljajic finally managed to 
get a curling effort on target, just before half-time, his effort was 
brilliantly tipped away by Consigli.

Consigli again denied the Serb after the break, then did well to parry a low 
drive from Geoffrey Kondogbia as he kept sixth-placed Sassuolo in the game.

In an end-to-end match, the Inter forward Rodrigo Palacio had a shot cleared 
off the line while, at the other end, Handanovic made a superb reflex save at 
close range to stop an acrobatic volley from Antonio Floro Flores.

Consigli again denied Ljajic and turned away a curling effort from the 
substitute Stevan Jovetic before Berardi struck for Sassuolo.

Inter have 39 points from 19 games, one ahead of Napoli, who play at Frosinone 
later on Sunday, and three clear of Juventus, who travel to Sampdoria.
