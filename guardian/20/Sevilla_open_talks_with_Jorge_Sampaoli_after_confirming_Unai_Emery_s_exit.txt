Emery, who is under contract with Sevilla until June 2017 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/12/unai-emery-laurent-blanc-paris-saint-germain-sevilla>
, has been linked with several clubs in Europe, including the French champions 
Paris Saint-Germain and Everton, although the Premier League side are expected 
to appoint Ronald Koeman in the coming days.

“Emery’s intention is to, throughout this week, resolve unilaterally his 
contract with Sevilla because of his wish not to continue as coach of the first 
team for the 2016-17 campaign,” Sevilla said in a statement.

“Following the Basque coach’s irrevocable decision to terminate his contract 
with Sevilla, the club has moved to find his successor. Former Chile coach 
Jorge Sampaoli will arrive in Seville on Monday to begin talks with the club.”

According to Marca, Emery will compensate Sevilla by paying €2m (£1.6m) to be 
released from his contract. The 44-year-old joined Sevilla in January 2013 and 
has steered the club to three straight Europa League titles. Sevilla finished 
seventh in La Liga last season but as Europa League champions, will play in the 
Champions League next season.
