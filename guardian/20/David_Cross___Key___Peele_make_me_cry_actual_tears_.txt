The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 
The first time I saw Daniel Kitson – who I had only just started to hear about 
– at the Kilkenny festival in Ireland. Absolutely inspiring. Masterful.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 
The Night School Hi-Q sketch from early [Canadian TV channel] SCTV never fails 
to make me laugh hard, especially Catherine O’Hara. But I gotta say, Key & 
Peele’s East/West College Bowl sketches make me cry actual tears.

The funniest person I know 
My wife, which is probably a trite thing to say. But it’s true, and I know a 
lotof funny people.

The funniest book I’ve ever read 
Masters Of Atlantis by Charles Portis is my all-time favourite. I even have a 
tattoo of the original cover artwork on my arm.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had 
It’s not so much a heckle directed at me, but someone yelled out something 
recently at a show on this tour that made everyone laugh really hard. I was 
introducing a bit and saying, “Do you think there’s ever a time when Jesus is 
up in heaven and …” I didn’t get the word “and” out before he yelled out “No!”, 
interrupting me so quickly that the entire theatre, myself included, laughed 
for a full minute.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had 
I find this question highly insulting.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny 
Necrophilia.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 
I have a T-shirt that I bought at Spitalfields market years ago that is one 
long essay in small print about how to correctly eat pussy.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard 
Louis CK’s “Why” bit is gold, but for a simple joke, Sarah Silverman’s “I once 
dated a guy who was half-black but he dumped me because I’m such a loser. Wow, 
I shouldn’t say things like that, I’m such a pessimist. He’s actually 
half-white” is pretty great.
