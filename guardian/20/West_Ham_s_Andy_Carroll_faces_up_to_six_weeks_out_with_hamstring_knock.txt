Andy Carroll is anxiously awaiting the results of a scan on the hamstring 
injury he suffered at Bournemouth on Tuesday but the early indication is the
West Ham United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> striker 
will be out for between four and six weeks.

Carroll has been beset by serious injuries to his heel, ankle and knee since 
he joined West Ham from Liverpool in January 2013 for £15m. The club will not 
know what the scan has shown until Thursday.

He was forced off after 15 minutes of the 3-1 win at Bournemouth and the 
27-year-old has been able to start only 31 Premier League matches for West Ham.

He had returned over the Christmas period from a groin injury and there had 
been positive signs, not least the goals in the home winsover Southampton

.

Slaven Bilic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slaven-bilic> said: “It is 
a really bad situation for us. After the Liverpool win, I said he is back, he 
looked sharp, he looked strong and he was covering the whole pitch and 
terrorising the defenders. So it is a blow.” The West Ham manager added: “He is 
disappointed because he knows he is back but if we have to choose between a 
knee and a hamstring injury, it is better to have a hamstring injury.”

Bilic is already without another key striker, Diafra Sakho, who tore his thigh 
muscle against West Bromwich Albion on 29 November. He returned to the training 
ground last week after a period of limited rehabilitation and the club will 
have a better idea of when he will be ready to play again at the end of this 
week. It will certainly not be before February.

West Ham may now cancel plans to listen to offers for Nikica Jelavic or Mauro 
Zárate during the transfer window.
