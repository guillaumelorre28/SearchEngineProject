Apples are like winter coats. By February, we’ll be tired of the very sight of 
them, but right now, after a summer of soft, juicy stone fruit and berries, the 
crunch of a russet or the warming woolliness of a sour cooker is as thrilling 
as the smell of a new pencil case. And, while they are still abundant and 
cheap, and no one can get enough of the things, I’ve added a classic British 
apple cake to the usual repertoire ofpies

 andcrumbles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/14/how-to-make-perfect-crumble>
.

I say British specifically, because when my thoughts first turned to apple 
cake I got excited about custardy French versions and dense,cinnamon-spiked 
American ones <https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/moms-apple-cake/>, before 
regretfully realising that pitting anOttolenghi recipe 
<http://www.dutchessroz.com/2015/04/apple-and-olive-oil-cake.html> with olive 
oil and maple icing against one from a farm kitchen in Victorian Dorset was as 
pointless as comparing a Barbour with a Prada shearling – both great winterwear 
in their own way, but they couldn’t be more different.

As Dorset has adopted the apple cake as its official culinary symbol, I’ve 
plumped for the West Country variety, though those from further north may be 
interested to note that Julie Duff’s truly excellent bookCakes: Regional and 
Traditional 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/feb/08/foodanddrink.shopping> 
contains recipes from Ireland, Wales and Yorkshire, and Sue Lawrence’s Scottish 
Baking boasts one from north of the border, too. Clearly, it would be more than 
my life is worth to compare them.

Duff’s recipe from Somerset and Devon (“each county seeming to have its own 
variation”) calls for wholemeal flour, which gives her cake a slightly heavier, 
coarser texture my testing panel rather likes in this context – this should be 
a rustic affair. That said, if you’re less of a fan of a worthy texture, feel 
free to substitute plain white flour.

Interestingly, Gary Rhodes’ recipe in his book New British Classics, and that 
from a farmer’s wife in North Chideock, Dorset, included in Florence White’s 
wonderful 1932 collection,Good Things in England 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b7b3XsV8-zgC&pg=RA3-PR83&lpg=RA3-PR83&dq=florence+white+good+things+in+england+dorset+apple+cake&source=bl&ots=YePZ_6XQKs&sig=HwxSjDYtRpMs-HEYGO0ANu3155k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8vJbb_c3PAhVH2RoKHW-3CyIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=florence%20white%20good%20things%20in%20england%20dorset%20apple%20cake&f=false>
, both start with a firmish dough rather than a batter, and end up more like 
scones or rock cakes than a fluffy sponge – indeed, Miss Annette Vipan, who 
contributed the latter recipe, suggests it is best eaten warm, spread with 
butter. Though it’s not a cake as we might understand it today, I would highly 
recommend them as an alternative use for excess apples; both are utterly 
delicious.

Cloake for the Guardian 
Butter is the fat of choice in dairy country, with Mary Berry 
<http://www.maryberry.co.uk/recipes/baking/the-very-best-apple-dessert-cake> 
using it melted, which,according to those who know more about the chemistry of 
baking than me 
<http://www.chowhound.com/post/effect-melted-butter-cake-recipe-room-temperature-butter-854842>
, will give it a denser texture – “if you melt the butter first, not only do 
you not have … air bubbles, but there’s water in butter, so you’ll end up 
getting some gluten development when you mix in the flour and create a more 
“chewy” or softer texture.” Karen Burns-Booth, writing on theGreat British 
Chefs website <http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/spiced-apple-cake>, and 
Duff both use the creaming method, where air is beaten into the batter to give 
the cake a lighter texture yet, to my slight surprise, we prefer Berry’s 
closer, chewier consistency in this instance.

Burns-Booth also goes for the traditional pound cake formula of equal parts 
butter, sugar, flour and eggs, while everyone else employs a more parsimonious 
ratio of roughly half the fat to flour. Usually I take the stance of the more 
butter the better, and indeed, Burns-Booth’s cake is rich and delicious, but 
the plainer versions prove more popular on this occasion – they just feel more 
fitting to the spirit of this particular cake.

Duff notes that “older recipes used lard” – she prefers butter, but I can’t 
resist tracking down some decent pig fat for Vipan’s. Free-range stuff proves 
oddly difficult to get hold of, but it’s well worth the effort, giving this 
rock-cake-like creation an addictively crisp texture my testers can’t get 
enough of. For my fluffier version, however, I’ll be sticking with Berry’s 
melted butter.

Sugar

Most recipes don’t specify what kind of sugar to use, which I generally assume 
to imply white caster, but Burns-Booth and Duff both go for the soft light 
brown sort. Having seen a recipe from theWest Dorset Foodie 
<http://www.westdorsetfoodie.co.uk/dorset-apple-cake> that recommends dark 
muscovado, I decide to give that a whirl in Duff’s cake, but testers declare it 
too Christmassy for this time of year. The caramel flavour of the light 
muscovado, however, works as well with the fruit as one might expect, given the 
popularity of toffee apples. A few people, me included, find Burns-Booth’s 
recipe a little sweet for their taste, so I decide to cut the sugar slightly.

Her crunchy demerara topping proves very popular, however, even more so than 
Duff’s deliciously sticky honey glaze – like Berry’s toasted almonds, they 
supply a pleasing textural contrast to the soft fruit and chewy cake beneath.

The apples

Though this is a cake designed to work with whatever windfall you might have 
been landed with, only Berry calls for cooking apples. The problem, I find, is 
that Bramleys in particular break down very quickly when heated, which is what 
makes them such a delight to stew, encase in pastry and so on – but which also 
means that the chunks in Berry’s cake end up marooned in great caverns within 
the batter. Better to go with a firmer-textured eating variety that keeps its 
shape during cooking – Rhodes recommends the Granny Smith for its “tart bite” 
and Burns-Booth the spicy Cox, but use whatever you like or have in abundance, 
though I would recommend something fairly tart to contrast with the sweetness 
of the crumb.

More important, in my opinion, is the way you cut the fruit – grate it, as 
Rhodes suggests, and it will disappear into the batter. Smallish dice are 
preferable, and I also like Burns-Booth’s notion of keeping the skin on; not 
only does it make life easier, but it helps keep the pieces together. Plus, the 
more fibre the better, surely.

 Gary Rhodes’ melted cheddar topping is a clever twist Photograph: Felicity 
Cloake for the Guardian 
Apples have a natural affinity with dried fruit, like Duff’s sultanas, and 
sweet spice – she uses cinnamon, Rhodes nutmeg, and Burns-Booth goes all out 
with the mixed sort, while Berry bucks the trend with almond extract. As usual, 
I’m powerless to resist the peppery charms of nutmeg, finding the sweet perfume 
of cinnamon overpowering, but the taste test is divided – though most agree 
that they find the dried fruit to be gilding the lily.

Rhodes’ melted cheddar topping is a clever twist on the idea of serving cheese 
with fruit cake, but not everyone’s sold on the idea, and I reluctantly concede 
that perhaps it is something better served alongside the cake than baked into 
the batter. Alternatively, some thick ivory cream, or a dollop of tangy yoghurt 
would do very nicely – along with a nice cup of tea, naturally.

Pinch of salt
Grating of nutmeg or 1 tsp mixed spice
175g light muscovado sugar

2 large eggs, beaten
4 medium apples, preferably fairly tangy (I like Cox’s), diced
Demerara sugar, to top
2 tbsp flaked almonds

Heat the oven to 160C and grease a 20cm cake tin. Put the flour, baking 
powder, salt, nutmeg and sugar in a large bowl and stir in the butter and eggs. 
Beat together for a minute or so until well combined.

Stir in the apples until well distributed, then spoon into the tin. Smooth the 
top and then sprinkle with the demerara. Bake for an hour, then add the almonds 
and bake for about 15-25 minutes more until coming away from the tin.

Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the tin then lift onto a rack to cool 
completely.
