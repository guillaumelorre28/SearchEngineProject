What did Shakespeare believe? We can only guess. He left neither a diary nor a 
philosophical treatise. His only surviving letters and public statements are 
either conventionally – if supremely elegantly – phrased pleas for patronage, 
or words devoted to business transactions and legal cases.His will 
<http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/life/retirement/will+1.html> is 
orthodox and Anglican, but that is how wills were written. It doesn’t mean that 
he was orthodox and Anglican.

The only poems written in his own voice are the Sonnets. But can we take them 
at face value?

The only poems written in his own voice are the Sonnets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/11/poem-of-the-week-sonnet-xiii-by-william-shakespeare>
. The man who wrote them clearly believed that love is a powerful and 
complicated thing, that poetry is an effective way of exploring its many 
dimensions, and – if his lines are to be taken at face value – that creative 
art is a way of achieving a kind of immortality for the beloved and perhaps for 
creative artists themselves. But his lines are not necessarily to be taken at 
face value. The “I” who speaks a poem, even an intimate love poem, is not 
synonymous with the person who writes the line. All poets rejoice in creating a 
persona. And if Shakespeare really believed that the purpose of writing sonnets 
was to immortalise the beloved, he might have taken the trouble to tell his 
readers the name of the addressee.

As for immortalising himself, he was lackadaisical about publishing his works. 
The sonnets may well have been published without his permission, and half his 
plays were unpublished at the time of his death. Had it not been for the 
diligence of his fellow actors in seeing into print theFirst Folio 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Folio> of his collected comedies, 
tragedies and histories in 1623, Julius Caesar, Twelfth Night, Measure for 
Measure, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, The Tempest and a dozen more would be 
lost.

What kind of a thinker was Shakespeare? That is a better question. The 
patterns of his mind can be traced in his work and from his education. Here we 
need not guess. We can say many things that are incontestable. He loved words 
and wordplay. He was fascinated by every variety of human character. He thought 
by way of dialogue and debate. He was sceptical of generalisation about the 
ways of the world: almost every time a character in one of the plays gives 
voice to a piece of sententious wisdom, someone else says something that 
contradicts it – or a twist in the plot makes the seeming wisdom look foolish. 
“The Gods are just,” says Edgar in King Lear, but he has hardly closed his 
mouth before the old king comes on bearing the hanged body of his beloved, 
virtuous daughter Cordelia, most unjustly murdered.

The few moments in the plays where a sententious or philosophical discourse is 
vindicated rather than subverted by surrounding events tend to be those when a 
character says that life is like a play. Most famously, there is Jaques’s “All 
the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players” in As You Like 
It. As if to prove he is right, he has hardly closed his mouth when young 
Orlando comes on bearing the frail body of a man approaching the seventh and 
last age of human life. He is pointedly named Adam: he is Everyman. It would be 
hard to controvert the view that Shakespeare believed life is a kind of theatre 
and theatre a mirror of life. But an actor-turned-dramatist would believe that, 
wouldn’t he?

Puritans disapproved of actors, especially when they dressed as girls and 
kissed boys

Did Shakespeare believe in God? Though he could not escape the Christian 
thought that saturated his society, the relationship between the church and the 
theatre was strained. Rival dramatistChristopher Marlowe 
<http://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Marlowe> was specifically 
accused of atheism.Puritans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans> 
disapproved of players, especially when boys dressed as girls started kissing 
adult male actors on stage. At a deeper level, the Puritan abhorrence of 
theatre echoed an ancient quarrel.Plato <http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/> argued 
that poets should be banned from the ideal republic not only because plays 
stirred up unhealthy emotions (he was thinking of Greek tragedy – anyone for 
revenge, rape and incest?), but also because if, philosophically speaking, the 
day-to-day world is a “shadow” (as on the wall of a cave by flickering 
firelight) of the true reality of ideal forms, then plays, imitations of those 
“shadows”, are shadows of shadows, at two removes from Reality with a capital R.

By the same account, extreme Protestantism, taking the biblical second 
commandment literally, regarded all graven images as idolatrous because they 
encouraged worship of the image of God as opposed to his ineffable Reality. 
When the Protestant revolution reached sleepy Stratford-upon-Avon, the 
treasurer of the town council, a certain John Shakespeare, paid for workmen to 
whitewash over the image of the Last Judgment in the Guild Chapel across the 
road from the well-appointed house that his son William would one day purchase.

Across the country, the old biblical mystery plays were banned, and in London 
Puritan pamphleteers railed against the idolatry of everything theatrical. 
Killjoy Malvolio in Twelfth Night is specifically described as a Puritan, while 
hypocritical Angelo in Measure for Measure is said to be “precise” – a 
“precisian” was another term for a Puritan. So one thing we can say for sure 
about Shakespeare’s beliefs is that he was not a Puritan.

 Shakespeare at his most English … The Merry Wives of Windsor. Photograph: 
Donald Cooper/Photostage 
It has sometimes been argued, without any firm evidence, that he died a closet 
Papist. One suspects that throughout his career he had a vestigial love for the 
more theatrical aspects of the old faith – dressing up, ceremony, ritual. But 
the interest in resurrection and redemption that marks his last plays does not 
feel specifically Roman Catholic. His thinking seems to have been much more 
profoundly shaped by ancient Rome than modern, that is to say by the classical 
rather than the Judeo-Christian tradition, by the Renaissance rather than the 
Reformation or counter-Reformation.

Patterns of thought are learned at school. It was Stratford-upon-Avon grammar 
school that formed the mind of young William – to whom he surely nods in the 
scene in The Merry Wives of Windsor (his most English play) where a Welsh 
schoolmaster (he had one himself) gives a Latin lesson to a bright but cheeky 
schoolboy called … William. It was at the grammar school that he learned the 
art of rhetoric – the persuasive use of words, the elaboration of linguistic 
figures, the ability to argue both sides of a case. This art of rhetoric 
provided him with the building blocks of his literary achievement. And it was 
at the grammar school that he was introduced to classical literature.

One thing is certain: he thought women were more than the equal of men

It is reading that makes us into thinkers. So what were the books of which 
Shakespeare thought most highly? Castaways onDesert Island Discs 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr> are allowed to take three books with 
them: the Bible, Shakespeare and one other of their own choice. On the 400th 
anniversary of his death, the ghost of Shakespeare really should be invited on 
to the programme. When it comes to the books, I suspect he will say that he 
doesn’t want to bother with the Bible (he knew it well enough from compulsory 
churchgoing in his youth) and he has all of Shakespeare in his head, so could 
he choose three books, please?

One will be Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians and Romans 
<http://lf-oll.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/1803/0988-01_Bk.pdf>, in the translation 
of Sir Thomas North. This was the book that got him thinking seriously about 
politics. Monarchy versus republicanism versus empire. The choices we make and 
their tragic consequences. The conflict between public duty and private desire. 
He absorbed classical thought, but was not enslaved to it. Shakespeare was a 
thinker who always made it new, adapted his source materials and put his own 
spin on them.

In the case of Plutarch, he feminised the very masculine Roman world. Brutus 
and Caesar are seen through the prism of their wives, Portia and Calpurnia; 
Coriolanus through his mother, Volumnia; Mark Antony through his lover, 
Cleopatra. Timon of Athens is alone and unhappy precisely because his obsession 
with money has cut him off from the love of, and for, women (the only females 
in Timon’s strange play are two prostitutes).

Here is another thing that Shakespeare certainly thought: that women are more 
than the equal of men. Where most “thinkers” among his contemporaries took the 
traditional view of female inferiority, he again and again showed the girls to 
be smarter than the boys – think Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, Rosalind 
in As You Like It, Portia in The Merchant of Venice.

Another of his desert island books will be The Essays of Michel de Montaigne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/10/shakespeares-montaigne-john-florio-review>
, in thetranslation of John Florio 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shakespeare-s-montaigne.html>. The more 
philosophical tenor of the works in the second half of his career can 
attributed to his reading of this book when it was published in 1603 (or maybe 
to a first acquaintance with parts of it in manuscript some time before – there 
is good evidence that he knew translator Florio from his days in the household 
of the Earl of Southampton). When I tried to write an intellectual biography of 
Shakespeare in my bookSoul of the Age 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/soul-of-the-age.html>, I came to the 
conclusion that if we can pin a philosophical pattern upon him, it would be one 
remarkably like that revealed by the progression of thought through the three 
books of Montaigne’s endlessly rereadable meditative essays: a broad movement 
from attention to the Roman Stoical idea that “to philosophise is to learn how 
to die” (which could stand as the set theme of Hamlet) to a severe scepticism 
about the Christian idea of God’s providence being revealed through natural 
justice (the position that Montaigne eviscerated in his lengthy Apology for 
Raymond Sebond, which is echoed very closely in the language of King Lear), to 
a coming to rest in a philosophy of acceptance associated with the Epicurean 
tradition.

 Philosophy tutor … Montaigne. Photograph: Alamy 
Though sometimes parodied as an excuse for bodily self-indulgence (think Sir 
Epicure Mammon in Ben Jonson’s great comedy The Alchemist),Epicureanism 
<http://www.epicurus.net/> was a serious philosophical tradition that proposed 
that the good life may be best achieved through the acceptance of limits: 
limits on our knowledge of God or the gods, and limits on our hopes about the 
afterworld. We should learn to accept, to live in the moment. We should cherish 
friendship. And we should not deny our bodily urges. It is foolish to pretend 
that we can live happily without sex, food and drink, though all should be 
consumed in moderation.

He'd ask Kirsty Young for Ovid in translation since his Latin is probably 
rather rusty by now

Almost the last words that Shakespeare wrote for the theatre were these, 
spoken by Duke Theseus of Athens at the end of his final (co-written) play, The 
Two Noble Kinsmen: “Let us be thankful / For that which is, and with you [the 
gods, if such there be] leave dispute / That are above our question.” That is 
Epicurean acceptance in a nutshell.

Kirsty Young will, however, interrupt desert island Shakespeare to tell him 
that it is cheating to have three books. He must choose just one. “In that 
case,” he will say, “it will be the one that first fired my imagination in 
school and to which I returned throughout my writing career. The Metamorphoses 
of Ovid. I will take it in the translation of Arthur Golding, because my Latin 
is rather rusty after these 400 years.”

 More Metamorphoses … Bernini’s Apollo and Daphne. Photograph: Corbis 
Ovid was where he found the things that made him a poet and a dramatist: 
magic, myth, metamorphosis. He acknowledged as much by bringing a copy of the 
Metamorphoses on stage in his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus; by basing his 
first published poem, Venus and Adonis (the book that made his name), on one of 
Ovid’s tales; and by choosing another of them, Pyramus and Thisbe, for the 
play-within-a-play at the climax of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Ovidian myth, 
magic and wonder form a golden thread that runs all the way through his career 
from these early works to the late visions of The Winter’s Tale, where the 
exquisite animation of Hermione’s statue nods to the story of Pygmalion, and 
The Tempest, which alludes to the sinister magic of the sorceress Medea.

Ovid was the master who taught Shakespeare that what makes great literary art 
is extreme human passion. Ovid showed him how to represent grief: in Hamlet it 
is learned from Hecuba, in Lear from Niobe. And Ovid gave him the theme that is 
the driving force of all his comedies and several of his tragedies: erotic 
desire.

What kinds of question did Shakespeare think most deeply about? The simplest 
but most essential ones. Such as: how do we cope with a father’s death 
(Hamlet)? How do we reconcile the pleasures of our youth with the 
responsibilities of adulthood and authority (Prince Hal’s growth to King Harry 
in the Henry IV plays)? And how do we make sense of the experience of falling 
in love? A Midsummer Night’s Dream is his best answer to this last question, 
and that is one of the several reasons that I increasingly feel it is not only 
his most Ovidian play but also his most Shakespearean.

Shakespeare still lives, and still matters, after four centuries because he 
reminds us of the value of the old answers to the perennial questions. We live 
in an age of increasing biological determinism. The neuroscientist will tell us 
that the experience of falling in love can be explained by brain chemistry – 
the activation of certain proteins and neurotransmitters. Sooner or later – 
probably sooner – in the style of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World some 
laboratory will produce a pill to make us fall in and out of love. But 
Shakespeare’s plays are there before us, as a laboratory – a safe space for 
experimentation – in which we witness the chaos that will be wrought by such a 
drug. He called it love-in-idleness, the juice that mischievous Puck applies to 
human eyes.

Storytelling is his method of making sense of the world. And since poetry as 
opposed to analytical prose is his medium of exploration into the human 
condition, I should end by honouring his way of thinking with a poem:




Titania and the Neuroscientist

Love’s chemistry sings

Crazy for you
Mad about the boy …

Shakespeare calls it love-in-idleness:
The purple flower viola tricolor
Colloquially known as
Wild pansy, heartsease, Johnny jump up,
Jack come up and kiss me, three faces in a hood,
Tickle my fancy, come and cuddle me,
Or heart’s delight.
Crushed by a fairy and placed on your eyelid
It’ll make you fall in love with the next person you see
Be he Adonis or an ass.

Neurophysiologists call it an effect of monoamines and hormones.
The dopamine rush (same as a cocaine high),
The norepinephrine that really gets you going
And makes you notice every tiny detail
(The way he moves his hand, the dimple of her smile).
Then there’s the serotonin that drives you to the edge,
The oxytocin orgasm that binds you close
As mother and baby on breast.
And above all the PEA.
Ah yes, phenylethylamine: it makes you giddy
(We all know the giddiness of love)
And kills your appetite for anything but love.

The lunatic, the lover, the poet
And the neuroscientist
Are of imagination all compact.
They know that cheeks flush, palms sweat,
Heart races and you walk on air,
You cannot sleep, you cannot eat,
Your mind can think of nothing else.

Echo fell in love with Narcissus
But he only loved himself,
So she pined away and died.
Only her voice remained,
The trace of love.

The unreciprocated phenylethylamine release
Led to fatal self-starvation.

I think I prefer the Shakespearean version of the old, old story.
