Guiding Swansea to a 5-4 win in November’s madcap reverse fixture did not make 
much of a difference for the then manager, Bob Bradley – he was sacked only

Defeat at Selhurst Park on Monday will not cost Sam Allardyce his job but it 
would put Palace in danger of slipping into the mire.Rich Flower
