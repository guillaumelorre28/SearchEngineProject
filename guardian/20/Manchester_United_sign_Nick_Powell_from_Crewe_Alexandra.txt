Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
have completed the signing of the England Under-18 international Nick Powell 
from Crewe Alexandra on a four-year deal.

United have been monitoring Powell for some time and have beaten off interest 
from Everton to sign him. The Premier League runners-up have confirmed the 
youngster has passed a medical and will join at the beginning of next month.

"We have scouted Nick for months now," said the United manager, Sir Alex 
Ferguson. "He is an exceptional talent and has been schooled well at Crewe. I'm 
delighted he has chosen to come to United. He has a lot to offer and we are all 
looking forward to working with him."

Powell, an attacking midfielder, is likely to fill the void created by Paul 
Pogba's imminent exit for Juventus.

"It really is a dream come true to be signing for Manchester United," he said. 
"I have had a great time at Crewe and would like to thank them for helping me 
to develop as a player over the past 13 years."

Powell is the second midfielder signed by United this month, following the 
arrival of the Japan international Shinji Kagawa from Borussia Dortmund.
