A spokesman of the general administration of sport told state media in an 
interview the government would “regulate and restrain high-priced signings, and 
make reasonable restrictions on players’ high incomes”.

Chinese clubs broke the Asian transfer record four times last year after 
China’s president, Xi Jinping, said he wanted to transform the country into a 
“football superpower”. The spokesman said the government would “set the upper 
limit” for transfer fees and income, and control “irrational investment”. “We 
must take building 100-year clubs as the goal,” he said, adding that clubs’ 
financial supervision would be strengthened, and their spending on players 
would be controlled. “We will remove the seriously insolvent clubs from the 
professional league.”

The Chinese FA is to reduce the number of overseas players allowed in a team 
from five to four.
