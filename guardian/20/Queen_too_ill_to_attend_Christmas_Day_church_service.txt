The Queen has missed the annual Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> morning church service at 
Sandringham for the first time in almost 30 years as she continues to fight a 
heavy cold.
 Prince Harry arrives for the Christmas Day service at the church of St Mary 
Magdalene. 
Hundreds of people had gathered outside the church for a glimpse of the 
monarch, including some who had arrived before dawn. She had attended the 
traditional service at the church of St Mary Magdalene, near the royal estate, 
every year since 1988.

Buckingham Palace confirmed on Sunday morning that the Queen would not attend 
the service. A brief statement it said: “The Queen continues to recover from a 
heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery.”

It added: “Her Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas 
celebrations during the day.”


The 90-year-old Queen and Prince Philip, 95, were forced to fly to their 
Sandringham estate in Norfolk by helicopter on Thursday aftertheir initial 
Christmas plans to travel by train were cancelled because of ill health

Prince Philip was well enough to attend the service. He was accompanied by 
other senior royals, including Prince Charles and his wife Camilla and Prince 
Edward and his family.

Prince William is spending Christmas at his wife’s family home in Bucklebury, 
Berkshire. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a service in nearby 
Englefield church with their children.
