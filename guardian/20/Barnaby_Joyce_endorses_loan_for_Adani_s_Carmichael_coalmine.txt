The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/barnaby-joyce>, has declared the 
Adani mine needs to proceed, and he’s endorsed giving the project a 
concessional loan in order to “get the thing built and get the money flowing”.


Joyce used Wednesday’s worse-than-expected GDP figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-shrinks-by-05-in-september-quarter>
 to urge Queenslanders to “show the same spunk you had when you developed the 
coalfields in the past, built international airports at Cairns, built the 
Wivenhoe dam, sealed the roads out west, built the Gold Coast”.

His enthusiastic backing for the contentious project contrasted with more 
obvious caution expressed by the treasurer,Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison>, on Wednesday.

Morrison told reporters in Canberra he did not intend to join commentary about 
whether the project should win support from the government’s Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Fund.

He said the independent advisory board of the fund needed to be left alone to 
do its job. “I agree that it was set up to make independent assessments about 
the proposals.

“They are the people to make those calls and I don’t intend to join in in any 
commentary about what they should or shouldn’t do, that would compromise the 
fundamental purpose of those people who have to make those assessments,” the 
treasurer said.

During the federal election, the government’s position on the Adani project 
was that it should proceed, or not, on a commercial basis.

But since the election, senior Nationals have pushed to have the project 
allocated $1bn from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to bankrolla

Joyce used a speech in Brisbane on Wednesday to sing the praises of the 
controversial project, declaringQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> needed to return to its 
pioneering spirit.

The deputy prime minister seized on news that Australia’s economy slipped 
backwards in the September quarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-shrinks-by-05-in-september-quarter>
 by a greater than expected 0.5%, to argue Australia needed development.

“When I hear people standing up against the development of central Queensland 
coalfields, the Adani mine, where is your alternate source of income going to 
come from?” Joyce said.

“We have had in this quarter negative growth. People say that’s terrible. 
Let’s talk about the solution. If you don’t want that wealth, where is your 
alternate form of wealth going to come from? How are you going to do it?

“Will it become manifest on a tree in the botanic gardens? It won’t.

“You have to show the same spunk you had when you developed the coalfields in 
the past, built international airports at Cairns, built the Wivenhoe dam, 
sealed the roads out west, built the Gold Coast.

“That’s the spunk Queenslanders have to show again and they’ve got to have 
that drive and that vision and that enthusiasm to take the next step.”
