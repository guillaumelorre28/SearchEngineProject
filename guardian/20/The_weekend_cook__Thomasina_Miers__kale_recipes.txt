Kale has been hijacked by the clean-eating brigade, much like the poor 
avocado, but while there is no denying that kale is packed with vitamins and 
minerals, I find too much emphasis on healthy eating off-putting. In kale’s 
case, that deliciously verdant flavour is equally important. It is also hugely 
versatile, as well as cheap, which may explain why my mother fed us copious 
amounts as children, and in every which way. One that we came to love was with 
mussels and a lemon butter sauce, and today’s clam recipe is my variation on 
that theme. The salad that follows, on the other hand, brings a touch of 
naughtiness (and bags of taste) to an otherwise totally virtuous vegetable.

Steamed clams with kale, fregola and lemon butter sauce

Fregola, or fregula, is a semolina pasta from Sardinia that’s similar in size 
and shape to the oversized Middle Eastern couscous. Its gloriously nutty taste 
works very well with shellfish. Serves four.

250g fregola
Juice of 3 lemons
75g cold butter, cut into 2cm cubes
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
1 pinch chilli flakes
200ml white wine 
1kg clams, scrubbed clean (discard any with open or damaged shells)
200g kale, leaves pulled of the stems and finely chopped
1 handful parsley leaves, finely chopped

Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the fregola, stirring 
occasionally so it doesn’t stick together, until al dente – about 12-15 
minutes, depending on your packet. Drain once cooked.

While the pasta is cooking, start on the sauce. Put the lemon juice into a 
small saucepan and warm it up gently over a medium-low heat. Once warm, but not 
boiling, turn the heat to low and whisk in the butter, a couple of cubes at a 
time, stirring continuously until all of it has been incorporated. The mixture 
should now be the consistency of single cream. Season to taste and keep warm 
over a very low heat (or over a bain-marie).

Heat a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan on a medium flame, then fry the oil, 
garlic and chilli flakes until the garlic just starts to colour and smell 
fragrant. Pour in the wine, turn up the heat to high and leave to bubble for a 
minute or two, until the alcohol cooks off and the sauce reduces by half. Add 
the clams to the pot, sit the kale on top, cover the pan and cook for two 
minutes. Stir, then put back the lid and cook for another one to two minutes, 
until the clams have opened and the kale has wilted.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the clams and kale to warmed, shallow bowls, 
then return the pan with the cooking liquor to the heat and tip in the fregola. 
Stir it in briefly, just until the fregola has warmed through, then spoon over 
the clams with the cooking liquid. Dress with the warm, buttery lemon sauce, 
sprinkle with parsley and serve (discard any clams that do not open).

It might sound odd, but massaging softens kale leaves, which makes it suitable 
for the salad bowl. Here, it is seasoned with a rosemary-and-honey-scented oil, 
then tossed with fried pecorino and all sorts of other goodies. Serves four.

200g aged pecorino, cut into 1cm-thick and 3-4cm long slices
200g kale, leaves pulled off stems and roughly chopped
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pears, cored and thinly sliced 
1 sprig fresh rosemary
2 tsp honey
Juice and finely grated zest of ½ lemon
50g pine nuts
50g pumpkin seeds

Lay out the pecorino on a tray and leave to dry out for an hour – this will 
help with the frying later on.

Put the kale and half the oil in a large bowl, season and massage well with 
your hands for five minutes, until the kale softens and wilts. In a separate 
bowl, season the pears and toss gently with half a tablespoon of oil until each 
piece of pear is coated.

Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to a small, nonstick frying pan and gently 
fry the rosemary sprig until it begins to colour and smell fragrant – turn it 
few times while it’s frying. Pour over the honey, stir until melted, then add 
the lemon juice. Remove the rosemary sprig, then pour over the kale, tossing it 
well with your hands. Taste, and add a squeeze more lemon juice, if needed.

Wipe clean the frying pan and put it over a medium-high heat. Add the pine 
nuts and toast, tossing them regularly, until golden all over. Tip the pine 
nuts into a small bowl, and repeat with the pumpkin seeds until they begin to 
pop and colour, then add to the pine nut bowl.

Keeping the pan over a high heat, fry the pecorino slices in batches, turning 
them gently with a fish slice, until toasted, crisp and golden on both sides, 
but still keeping their shape. (If you don’t have a nonstick pan, you may need 
a drizzle of oil to stop the cheese sticking.)

Divide the kale between plates, then nestle a few pear and pecorino slices in 
among the leaves. Scatter over the cheese, then sprinkle with the pine nuts and 
pumpkin seeds before serving. Garnish with the lemon zest and serve.

And for the rest of the week…

The lemon butter sauce is a take on beurre blanc, and though it smacks a bit 
of the 1970s, it’s also sensational with mackerel, salmon and even shrimp 
mousse. All the ingredients for the salad, meanwhile, can be blitzed into a 
very healthy (!) pesto: I make mine with whatever I have to hand in the garden 
and whatever my local shops have in stock – parsley, basil, mint, rocket, kale, 
sorrel or chard are all possible contenders. Pecorino makes a welcome change 
from parmesan, as do experiments with different nuts and seeds.
