Mulligatawny is a cornerstone of the classic British Indian restaurant 
repertoire, always there, yet never ordered. Like kedgeree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/24/how-to-cook-perfect-kedgeree>
 and mango chutney, it is part of the culinary legacy of the Raj – an Indian 
dish adapted to suit colonial tastes 
<http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodsoups.html#mulligatawny>, in this case a thin, 
spicy Madrassi broth known as molo tunny, or “pepper water”, intended to be 
served with rice. Unfamiliar with this soup thing their masters seemed to 
require with every meal, Indian cooks served the nearest thing to it that they 
knew, bulking it out with meat and vegetables to suit the extravagant tastes of 
the British.

According to Lizzie Collingham’s excellent Curry: A Tale of Cooks and 
Conquerors <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/curry.html>, “mulligatawny soup 
was one of the earliest dishes to emerge from the new hybrid cuisine which the 
British developed in India, combining British concepts of how food should be 
presented … and Indian recipes”. Madhur Jaffrey describes it as “a classic of 
the mixed-race, Anglo-Indian community in India” and “an essential part of my 
childhood”, while Colonel Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert, author of the 1878 
recipe collection, Culinary Jottings for Madras 
<https://archive.org/stream/culinaryjottings00kenn/culinaryjottings00kenn_djvu.txt>
, recommends it as a “really excellent, and at times, most invigorating soup”.

 and seekh kebabs. Made with care, this unapologetically old-fashioned, gently 
spiced fusion classic is, as Jaffrey puts it, “really a curry, a meal in 
itself”.

The meat

Kenney-Herbert, who wrote under the pen name Wyvern, notes that “a very 
excellent muligatunny [sic] can be made without any assistance from flesh or 
fowl”, but that generally, as Jaffrey puts it in herUltimate Curry Bible 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/madhur-jaffrey-s-ultimate-curry-bible.html>, 
“even though there are some recipes for vegetarian mulligatawny in old 
cookbooks, most often they are made with mutton or poultry”. Rick Stein uses a 
tiny amount of chicken thigh in the version in his book India: In search of the 
perfect curry 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F81nkpsm09MC&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=rick+stein+mulligatawny+chicken+thigh&source=bl&ots=pYMYO86FCF&sig=enL4NQwt8ZZGQxxsHWgmoHyszpc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZhcyooLXRAhUJIMAKHYsiCLgQ6AEIMzAE#v=onepage&q=rick%20stein%20mulligatawny%20chicken%20thigh&f=false>
 and Jaffrey suggests either chicken or boneless lamb, while Atul Kochhar adds 
meat in the form of a lamb stock in the recipe collected in Paul Gayler’sGreat 
Homemade Soups <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-homemade-soups.html>, and
 Julie Sahni’s mulligatawny 
<https://therecipeblogger.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/refined-mulligatawny/> in 
Lindsey Bareham’s A Celebration of Soup deploys rich chicken stock.

From the seven pages given over to the subject by Wyvern, it seems that, 
traditionally, mulligatawny would have contained “the choicest pieces” of the 
meat used to make the stock base, and indeed, chicken in particular works well 
(the breast or neck of mutton or lamb he also suggests take rather longer to 
cook). Experiments with his vegetarian recipe prove interesting both in terms 
of flavour and the method he suggests of preparing the consommé base. After 
frying carrots, onions and celery in a good deal of butter, they are boiled 
with pepper and peas for three hours to produce a thick mush which proves a 
robustly flavoured base for his soup. Vegetarians might be interested to try it 
as an alternative to a more modern vegetable stock.

While preparing a chicken stock from scratch seems likely to discourage most 
from making this particular soup, said stock does make for a more richly 
flavoured base than plain water – Kochhar’s lamb does not prove popular (“too 
lamby” apparently). Substitute a good vegetable alternative if you’d prefer.

The vegetables

Jaffrey 
<http://www.britishfoodinamerica.com/Our-Recipes/Lamb-Recipes/Mulligatawny-Madhur-Jaffrey-s-way/#.WHOcEHecbVo>
 eschews vegetables, but most recipes start with the traditional European 
trinity of onion, carrot and celery, with Sahni also adding parsnips and 
mushrooms, and Stein going for leeks and tomatoes. Though not traditional 
Indian vegetables, the parsnips and leeks give the soups they grace a pleasant 
sweetness which means I will need to add less sugary chutney, which can only be 
a good thing. If you can’t get hold of them, substitute more carrot, or indeed 
any similar sweet root vegetable instead. Kochhar also throws in granny smith 
apples for sharpness, but lemon juice seems a simpler option.

Only Stein’s soup contains whole pieces of vegetable in the finished dish, but 
having already decided to have a little meat in there, I would like to retain a 
few chunks for balance.

Herbs and spices

Most recipes I try, with the exception of Wyvern’s (no garlic please, we’re 
British), are flavoured with root ginger and garlic, both of which seem like a 
must for a well-rounded soup. Sahni and Stein add fresh coriander, which I 
would prefer to save for the garnish, and Stein mint and, like Kochhar, curry 
leaves, which are annoyingly hard to get hold of in Britain (and, no doubt, 
would have been even harder in mulligatawny’s heyday).

My feeling, however, is that this should be a fairly simple recipe, in 
obedience to its origins; Wyvern calls only for “mulligatunny paste” or curry 
powder (“Barrie’s ‘Madras’ if possible” – it’s not these days, sadly), and 
Sahni keeps the spicing similarly basic, adding just black pepper, while 
Kochhar favours dried red chillies. Jaffrey and Stein employ more complex 
mixtures, with the latter making a paste from bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, 
turmeric, coriander, black pepper and cumin, but I am going to stick with 
Madras curry powder, which already contains a fair number of those spices, plus 
some cayenne to add a little heat to proceedings.

Sweet and sour

Wyvern is very keen on the importance of a “pleasant sub-acid” to a 
mulligatawny, by which he seems to mean a combination of mango chutney, 
redcurrant jelly and lime juice, and Jaffrey and Kochhar both add lemon juice – 
whether or not you feel that your soup would benefit from a little more 
sweetness in the form of chutney, a touch of acidity is rarely unwelcome.

The thickener

Wyvern, Stein and Sahni all thicken their soups with flour, Jaffrey whisks in 
a mixture of ground almonds and chickpea flour, and Kochhar uses masoor dal, 
which gives his mulligatawny a heartiness the others lack, though I’m not going 
to bother sieving it, as my testers prefer a more rustic consistency.

Finishing touches

Almond milk may seem like a very 21st-century phenomenon, but Wyvern believes 
a homemade version, produced by soaking flaked almonds in milk and then 
pounding them until smooth, is vital to a good mulligatawny, though he concedes 
“cocoanut milk” may be substituted. Kochhar and Stein both prefer the latter, 
and Sahni rounds things off with double cream, which, like Wyvern’s optional 
egg yolks, is pronounced too rich by the testers. My testers come down in 
favour of the more subtle sweetness of the almonds, but feel free to use the 
same amount of coconut milk if you’d prefer.

Serve with flatbreads, or rice, and a heap of coriander to brighten things up 
– like most of the most delicious foods, mulligatawny is unapologetically brown.

(Serves 4-6)

2 tbsp ghee or coconut oil
1 onion, finely sliced
1 carrot, diced
1 parsnip, diced
1 celery stick, diced
4 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger
2½ tsp Madras curry powder
½ tsp cayenne pepper
1.5l good-quality chicken stock (or vegetable if preferred)
1 boneless, skinless chicken thigh (optional)
150g masoor dal (split orange lentils)
4 tbsp flaked almonds
100ml hot milk or water
1 tbsp lemon juice
1-2 tbsp mango chutney (optional)
Small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped, to serve

Heat the fat in a medium saucepan over a medium heat and add the onion. Cook 
for about five minutes until soft and golden, then add the carrot, parsnip and 
celery and cook for another five minutes then scoop out a spoonful and set 
aside.

Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a minute or so, then add the curry 
powder and cayenne pepper and stir for a minute. Pour in the stock, add the 
chicken and dal, bring to the boil, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer 
for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the almonds in the hot milk or water.

Remove the chicken from the pan. Blitz the soup with a hand blender until 
smooth, then whizz the almonds to a puree and whisk them into the soup. Add 
lemon juice and salt to taste, then stir in the chutney to taste if you would 
prefer it sweeter. Pull apart the chicken into strands and stir into the soup 
along with the reserved vegetables.

Divide between bowls and garnish with coriander.

Mulligatawny: a recipe that deserves relegating along with the Raj, or one of 
the few good things to have come out of Britain’s colonial past? Are you one of 
the few people keeping it on Indian restaurant menus – and which other 
Anglo-Indian favourites would you recommend to other readers?
