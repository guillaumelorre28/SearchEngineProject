Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> have signed 
Peter Odemwingie on loan from Stoke City for the rest of the season.

The head coach, Lee Johnson, told the club website: “I’m delighted we’ve been 
able to bring someone of Peter’s quality in; he’ll provide us with experience 
and hopefully goals in one form or another. I’m looking forward to working with 
him and he’ll be available for us at Fulham tomorrow.”

The forward had seen his career stall at West Bromwich Albion and was 
infamously involved in adeadline-day drive

 to London in January 2013 only for a proposed move to Queens Park Rangers to 
fall through. Despite signing autographs outside Loftus Road the move did not 
happen and he returned to West Bromwich, from where he joined Stoke in 2014.

Helping to keep his new club in the Championship could well revive his career

. City lie two points above the drop zone.
