When Stephen Fry told us that he wanted to interview the US-based author and

we couldn't resist the opportunity to arrange a meeting of these great minds.

Since the American publication of The Tipping Point in 2000, Gladwell's 
influence on literature, popular psychology and beyond has been immense. His
latest book, David and Goliath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/28/blessed-weak-underdogs-malcolm-gladwell>
, on the subject of underdogs and overcoming adversity, is already causing 
quite a stir.

We know that Gladwell was born in the UK and is an avid runner

 to succeed in any given field and has evencome up with theories through having

. But what else would you like to know about the man and his ideas?

Tell us the one question that you want Fry to put to Gladwell, with an 
explanation why, and we will send Fry in with a selection of the best when they 
meet next week.
