I had gone shopping for broad beans, some tissue-thin slices of Spanish ham 
wrapped in waxed paper and a ball or two of mozzarella. Then I spotted a mass 
of tiny fruits in paper punnets, tightly packed into wooden trays, glistening 
like open jewel boxes. There were red and white currants, raspberries and 
blackcurrants, but best of all gooseberries: pale green baubles fit for a pie, 
a crumble, or the softest jam.

Their stunning sourness needs balancing with a little sugar. I exercise 
caution when up-ending the sugar bag into the pan of goosegogs. Too much can 
render the fruit pointless.

Simmered with sugar and a little water, gooseberries make a smashing sauce for 
a fat-rimmed pork chop. Its blissful habit of falling to a silky purée makes it 
an appropriate fruit for a crumble, especially one whose surface is pleasingly 
gritty with Demerara sugar.

This year’s first haul of berries went for chutney: not the brown sticky 
condiment of supermarket cheese sandwiches, but a pale, eau de nil sour jam, 
plump with golden sultanas and orange tomatoes. It was a preserve to lift the 
flatness of a pork pie or slithers of cold pork. A conserve to make your eyes 
sparkle.

To give a silkiness to the chutney I bubbled two-thirds of the berries down to 
a jammy consistency, then threw in a final handful that turned opaque and 
stayed whole – welcome bursts of sourness among the sweet-sharp conserve. And 
to go with it, an unimaginably useful cut-and-come-again terrine, its 
juniper-studded meat flashed with fresh apricots.

Gooseberry chutney

Stir regularly throughout the process as, like jam, chutney has a habit of 
sticking and catching on the base of the pan. Sterilise your preserving jars 
with boiling water from the kettle (the lid, too), to help the chutney keep for 
a few weeks.

Makes at least 2 x 400g jars

golden caster sugar 250g
onion 250g
yellow or orange tomatoes 300g
gooseberries 1 kg
golden raisins 200g
cider vinegar 150ml
white wine vinegar 150ml
cardamom pods 15
black peppercorns 12
coriander seeds 1 tsp

Directions

Peel and roughly chop the onion, then put it into a deep, heavy-based, 
non-reactive saucepan. Cut the tomatoes into quarters then put them in the pan, 
together with the onion, over a moderate heat, adding the raisins and the 
vinegars.

Crack the cardamom pods with a mortar or rolling pin and extract the black 
seeds. Crush them lightly, then stir into the chutney with the peppercorns and 
coriander seeds. Tip three-quarters of the gooseberries into the pan and bring 
to the boil.

As soon as the mixture boils, lower the heat so the chutney simmers slowly, 
then add a generous teaspoon of salt. Leave at a calm bubble, stirring 
regularly, for 30 minutes. Set the oven at 150C/gas mark 2. Tip the sugar into 
a roasting tin or baking dish and warm in the oven for 10 minutes, then add the 
warm sugar to the chutney. Continue cooking for 10 minutes.

Stir in the remaining gooseberries, turning up the heat and letting the 
mixture boil for 2 or 3 minutes until it feels thick on the spoon. Remove from 
the heat. Have ready the sterilised jars. Ladle the chutney into the jars then 
seal tightly.

Observer 
A terrine for dipping into, to serve with the chutney above, will keep in the 
fridge for 4 to 5 days. You’ll need hot toast, and lashings of butter.

Serves 8-10

fresh apricots 250g
onion 1, medium
garlic 2 cloves
butter 30g
tarragon leaves 3 tbsp, chopped
minced pork 500g
smoked streaky bacon 200g
pork cheeks 300g
juniper berries a handful

You will need a 1 litre capacity, high-sided baking dish or terrine

Directions

Peel the onion and roughly chop it. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the 
chopped onion and cook for 5 or 6 minutes until translucent. Peel and crush the 
garlic and stir into the onion and continue cooking for 1-2 minutes.

Halve the apricots, remove and discard the stones, then cut each half into 2 
or 3 pieces. Remove the onion from the heat.

Put the pork mince in a large mixing bowl. Roughly chop three-quarters of the 
bacon, and add to the pork. Remove any white sinew from the pork cheeks with a 
knife then cut each cheek into 4 thin strips (if the pieces are too large they 
will be tough), then add to other meats.

Season the meat with salt and black pepper then combine with the apricot and 
onion mixture. Put the meat into the terrine or baking dish, packing it into 
the corners and lightly smoothing the surface. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.

Arrange the reserved rashers of smoked streaky bacon over the surface, tucking 
them down the side of the meat, leaving gaps of meat showing on top. Add the 
juniper berries, pressing them into the meat. Cover the dish tightly with 
clingfilm and then kitchen foil.

Put the terrine into a roasting tin then pour in enough hot (not boiling) 
water to come half way up the sides of the dish. Transfer the tin to the oven 
and bake for 90 minutes. Remove the pâté from the oven and place a heavy weight 
on top to press it down. As soon as the pâté is cool, transfer it to the 
fridge, still topped with its weight, and chill overnight.

Serve the terrine, together with slices of hot toast.
