of the German Cup.

Green, making his first start for the German champions since December, headed

Itâ€™s been a productive month for Green, who was called up for the US national 
teamâ€™s friendlies against Cuba and New Zealand and scored in both matches. The 
purple patch in form will no doubt catch the eye of JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann as he 
makes his selections for next monthâ€™s crucial World Cup qualifiers against 
Mexico and Costa Rica.

Greenâ€™s previous goals for the club had come in reserve matches and preseason 
friendlies.

Philipp Lahm had opened the scoring for Carlo Ancelottiâ€™s side in the second 
minute. Ji Dong-wonâ€™s goal for Augsburg made it 2-1 in the 68th, but David 
Alaba tightly angled strike in the late stages sealed Bayernâ€™s passage to the 
last 16.
