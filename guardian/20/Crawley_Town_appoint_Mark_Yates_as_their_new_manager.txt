<http://www.crawleytownfc.com/news/article/mark-yates-crawley-town-2462143.aspx>
: “I’m delighted to be here. I have been out of the game for a few months and 
when this opportunity arose it really excited me. There’s a big challenge ahead 
but one I am really looking forward to.”

The chief executive Michael Dunford said: “We’re delighted that Mark has 
agreed to join us. We interviewed some very strong candidates but Mark stood 
out.

“He has a very deep knowledge of the level we find ourselves at next season 
and is a first-rate coach. The board spoke to several people in the game who 
have worked with Mark and they were all very positive about his credentials, 
his knowledge and his enthusiasm, and we are looking forward to Mark taking the 
club forward.”
