 One of America’s oldest circuses, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey, is 
to take down its big top tent

 for the final time, 146 years after it was founded in rural Wisconsin by five 
brothers: Alfred, Albert, Charles, John and Otto.

 The company blamed declining ticket sales, which had fallen further after 
they removed elephants from the act last year.

“This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable 
business for the company,” said Kenneth Feld, chief executive. “The circus and 
its people have continually been a source of inspiration and joy to my family 
and me.”

An estimated 10 million people visit the Ringling Bros shows each year. 
However, the closure of the circus is further proof that entertainment tastes 
have moved away from traditional circuses, often featuring animals, towards 
more theatrical circus entertainment with a focus on acrobatics, such as the 
global phenomenonCirque du Soleil

One of the remaining British circuses that still used animals in its 
perfomances, The Great BritishCircus <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/circus>
, finally closed in 2012.

Ringling Bros have been targeted for years by animal rights groups protesting 
at the use of animals. In 1907, the circus had boasted 35 horses, 26 elephants, 
16 camels and other assorted animals that travelled across the US on 92 train 
carriages.

The number of animals in the circus gradually dwindled, and in 2016 the 
company finally bowed to legal pressure from activists and retired all the 
elephants from its shows, sending them to a conservation centre in Florida.

Ringling Bros still has two touring circuses, which still travel by train, and 
they will perform 30 more shows before finally shutting for good in May. Feld 
said the old-fashioned ways of the circus, such as the rail travel and 
providing a travelling school for the performers’ children, was impossible to 
sustain.

He said: “It’s a different model that we can’t see how it works in today’s 
world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price.”

The news that the circus is to shut was greeted with joy by the animal rights 
campaign groupPeta <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/peta>. They said the 
closure “heralds the end of what has been the saddest show on earth for wild 
animals, and asks all other animal circuses to follow suit, as this is a sign 
of changing times”.

Commenting on the demise of Ringling Bros, the creator of Family Guy, Seth 
MacFarlane, said “good riddance”.

“The closure of Ringling Bros circus ends 146 years of animal humiliation for 
human amusement,” he added.
