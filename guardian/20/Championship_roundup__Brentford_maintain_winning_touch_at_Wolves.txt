Marco Djuricin and Philipp Hofmann were on target as Brentford secured a 
second successiveChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> victory with a convincing 
2-0 win atWolverhampton Wanderers.

Djuricin, who is on a season-long loan from RB Salzburg, struck after 17 
minutes at Molineux, with Hofmann sealing the win two minutes from time to earn 
theBrentford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford> caretaker 
manager, Lee Carsley, his second win in three games following the departure of 
Marinus Dijkhuizen last month.

It was also only Brentford’s fourth win of the season, but a deserved one 
against an out-of-sorts Wolves side who slipped to their second successive 
defeat.

Wolves looked to be suffering a hangover from Sunday’s 4-2 reverse at Derby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/18/derby-county-wolverhampton-wanderers-championship-match-report>
, which brought their four-game unbeaten run in the Championship to an end.

Derby County missed out on the chance to break into the Championship’s top six 
with a 0-0 draw atBlackburn Rovers.

The Rams arrived at Ewood Park on the back of a six-game unbeaten run that 
suggested they were adapting to the philosophy of their new manager, Paul 
Clement, after a shaky start. However, that form was not evident as Rovers 
recorded their fourth consecutive home clean sheet in a row, a fact that bodes 
well ahead of the visit of their east Lancashire neighbours Burnley on Saturday.

The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, was in attendance to see the home side create 
the better openings, but efforts from Markus Olsson, Tom Lawrence and John 
O’Sullivan never truly troubled visiting goalkeeper Scott Carson.

In the other match, Steve Evans’s first game in charge of Leeds United ended 
in a 1-1 draw atFulham
