I see you’re shivering with anticipation. Fox has put together an all-star 
cast including Laverne Cox, Adam Lambert, Victoria Justice, Reeve Carney, 
Christina Milian, Ben Vereen, and the original Dr Frank-N-Furter, Tim Curry, to 
remake this 1975 cult classic about two uptight teens who wander into a sci-fi 
world of decadence. The previously released renditions of the songsSweet 
Transvestite <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=yisD3t9cAQw> and 
Science Fiction Double Feature <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oma0L86pK5Y> 
point to a faithful and competent production but, don’t be fooled, this won’t 
be performed live.Fox, Thursday 20 October at 8pm ET

It almost seems easier to get into a time machine and shake hands with 
Alexander Hamilton than it would be to pay an arm and a leg to get tickets to 
the super popular Broadway musical based on his life. In this episode of Great 
Performances, the long-running PBS show takes a backstage look at the show, 
from its creation in 2014 and its evolution as well as exploring the life of 
Hamilton himself. It might not be the filmed version of the show that so many 
left out in the cold had been hoping for (and itcan be frustrating at times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/17/hamilton-america-review-documentary-lin-manuel-miranda-radicalmedia>
), but those who are in love with the show will be delighted and entertained.

If you are one of the fans of this amazing show, you already know that it’s 
coming back this week. (It seems like all of the musical comedy’s devotees are 
just as obsessive as lead character Rebecca Bunch.) If you aren’t watching 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend already, you’re missing out on the saga of a woman who 
quits her job in New York, moves to a dumpy town in California to chase after 
an ex-boyfriend and searches for her one chance at happiness. It is currently 
the best show on television. Season two moves its time slot to Friday nights 
and kicks off with (spoiler alert!) Rebecca and Josh back together. But will 
she be just as crazy in love as she was about finding it? I’m sure there will 
be a delightfully campy musical number all about it.The CW, Friday 21 October

Who did big scary new villain Negan kill at the end of season six? Was it 
Glenn? It was probably Glenn. I really wish it were Carl, though. Wouldn’t this 
series be so much better without that whiny, one-eyed jerk? Anyway, we’ll find 
out who bit the bullet (or in this case, the bat) when the ratings blockbuster 
brings all of its zombies back for a new season that sees Rick and his clan 
being subservient to a new vicious dictator. Yeah, this is going to goreally 
well.AMC, Sunday 23 October at 9pm ET

What is television without Hugh Laurie playing a doctor? Absolutely nothing. 
He trades in Dr House for Dr Chance, a psychiatrist trying to help a patient 
(Gretchen Mol) in an abusive relationship. His assistance becomes more and more 
extreme and leads him into the San Francisco underworld. Yes, this is nothing 
like House. Alexandra Cunningham (Desperate Housewives) created the show along 
with Kem Nunn, based on his bestselling book of the same name. Hulu ordered two 
seasons right out of the gate, because they know the public service they’re 
doing by keeping Laurie on our screens.Hulu, Wednesday 19 October

The UK import Black Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror> seems like it has 
already anticipated all sorts of dark turns where technology is taking us – and 
its third season, with an expanded six episodes, will continue to take us in 
the right direction. It’s a true anthology show, where each episode is a 
self-contained story, and Netflix has upped its game recruiting writers such as 
Rashida Jones and Mike Schur (The Good Place) and actors such as Bryce Dallas 
Howard and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Just don’t binge this show. No one’s outlook on 
life could survive such an assault of bleak honesty.Netflix, 21 October

There are cartoons for adults and cartoons for kids, but rarely are there 
cartoons for both. Kids will love the adventures of Finn the Human and his 
shape-shifting dog Jake in the Land of Ooo, an alternative world where 
princesses rule everything, all of the residents are talking pieces of candy, 
and Jake is in love with a flying unicorn that only speaks Korean. Adults will 
love the ongoing saga of Finn’s love life, the post-apocalyptic and allegorical 
setting, and the trippy visuals. They might enjoy them even more after enjoying 
a smokeable substance that is currently legal in a few states. The seventh 
season of the show joins Hulu this week, so there are hundreds of episodes to 
keep viewers entertained through a late-night case of the munchies and to keep 
their kids occupied the next morning when they’re sleeping in.Hulu, 19 October
