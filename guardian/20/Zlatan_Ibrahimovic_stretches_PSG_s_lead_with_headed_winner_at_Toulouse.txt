Paris Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> left 
it late to earn their eighth victory in a row when a Zlatan Ibrahimovic header 
took the runaway Ligue 1 leaders to a 1-0 win at Toulouse.

Ibrahimovic headed home 17 minutes from time to advance the French champions 
to 57 points after 21 games and give them a 23-point lead over the 
second-placed side Angerswho lost 2-1

lie third – on Friday.

Laurent Blanc’s team, however, did not have it all their way against a side 
who lie second-bottom of the table on 20 points. They also lost their 
influential midfielder Javier Pastore and defender Marquinhos through injury.

The PSG defender Serge Aurier told Canal Plus: “It was a tough game but we 
were expecting it against a team fighting to stay in the top flight. However, 
we knew that if we stayed true to our principles we would score.”

Toulouse <https://www.theguardian.com/football/toulouse> had the best chances 
in the first half and Wissam Ben Yedder’s header was superbly saved by PSG’s 
German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. The striker also hit the bar shortly before 
half-time.

PSG stepped up a gear after the break and in the 73rd minute, Edinson Cavani 
deflected Lucas’s corner kick into the path of Ibrahimovic, who headed the ball 
past Alban Lafont in the Toulouse goal to register his 16th league goal of the 
season.

The Argentine playmaker Pastore limped off the pitch in the 19th minute with a 
possible calf injury, to be replaced by Cavani, while the Brazilian Marquinhos 
picked up a groin injury just after the hour.
