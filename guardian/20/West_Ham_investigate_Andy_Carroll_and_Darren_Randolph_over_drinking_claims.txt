West Ham are investigating claims the striker Andy Carroll and goalkeeper 
Darren Randolph were drunk on Tuesday afternoon following a club-sanctioned 
night out on Monday. There were conflicting reports on social media but the 
manager,Slaven Bilic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/slaven-bilic>, is 
likely to have questions for the pair.

“The club will be looking into these allegations and will deal with the 
players as we see fit,” aWest Ham United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> spokesman said. The 
Hammers have lost five of their six Premier League games this season, including 
four in a row, and play Middlesbrough on Saturday at the London Stadium.

Carroll, who is currently out with a knee injury, posted a series of posts on 
Twitter, with fans replying asking if he was drunk.

When it was suggested he was, in fact, in a coffee shop, Carroll replied: “I 
seriously need to sort my parties out!! Sorry lads.” He added:“Back in the day 
my parties had the wish I was there effect!”

He then posted an image of his cracked phone screen and re-tweeted a post by a 
West Ham fan, who had the handle @Monkeyboy_WHU.

“@AndyTCarroll brilliant that so many fall for this s**** about u & 
@RandzOfficial!”

One Twitter user and West Ham fan, with the handle @AranNicolWHUFC, had posted 
a photo of the pair. He wrote: “@AndyTCarroll and @RandzOfficial appear to be 
enjoying themselves... P***** out of their nut. Nice one lads. #WHUFC”

But in subsequent replies to other fans @AranNicolWHUFC admitted he had not 
taken the photo. “They’re at a pub and making a scene of themselves 
apparently,” he wrote. “I never witnessed it, probably isn’t even true, could 
be out having a coffee for all we know.”
