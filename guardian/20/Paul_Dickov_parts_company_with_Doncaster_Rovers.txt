Paul Dickov has parted company with Doncaster Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/doncaster> and will be succeeded 
temporarily as manager by the player-coach Rob Jones.

A statement on the club website 
<http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-2676264.aspx> 
said: “The board are ambitious for a top-six finish and that is, and will 
remain our aim.

“The club will now seek applications for the post on a permanent basis. The 
club will not rush into making any decision, the recruitment process will be 
thorough and we will ensure that we appoint the strongest candidate for the 
position.”

Doncaster, who lie 17th in League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball>, play third-place 
Walsall away on Saturday.

Dickov joined the club in May 2013 after three years in charge of Oldham 
Athletic. “The board of directors would like to take this opportunity to thank 
Paul Dickov for his efforts on and off the pitch, and wish him well for the 
future,” the club said.
