What is it?

The name isn’t selling this plant, is it? But Helleborus foetidus smells only 
when you crush the leaves, and some gardeners like its curious scent, which is 
variously likened to roast beef, wet dog or coffee. Its plus points? This 
architectural, easygoing evergreen has dark green foliage and pale clusters of 
nodding, bell-shaped, lime-green flowers rimmed with purple that persist from 
January to April. Height and spread: around 80cm x 50cm.


Any good varieties?

H. ‘Wester Flisk’ has red-purple stems and deeper purple rims to its petals. H.
 ‘Gold Bullion’ has chartreuse-green leaves and lime-gold flowers. If you can’t 
abide the smell of the crushed foliage,H. ‘Miss Jekyll’s Scented’ has sweetly 
scented flowers to mask it.

Plant it with?

Do as Christopher Lloyd <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopherlloyd> 
recommended and tuck around the bases of deciduous shrubs or trees.


And where?

This is a woodlander, so does best in partial shade; once established, it’s 
tolerant of dry conditions. Mulch with copious leaf mould in autumn.


Any drawbacks?

All parts of it are toxic, so avoid if you have dogs, or children who 
indiscriminately grab and eat plants.


What else can it do?

I’ve seen a patch on a verge by the M1, so it’s safe to say it’s 
pollution-resistant.
