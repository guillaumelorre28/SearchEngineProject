The funniest standup I’ve ever seen

Harry Hill at the Pleasance Cabaret Bar in Edinburgh in 1996. It was a 
60-minute show. I was breathless after 30.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen

Any teenage boy in the late 70s exposed to the mind-boggling wonders of Winky 
Wanky Woo by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8u0RaHWz9A>, as Derek & Clive, would have 
been seriously affected. Damaged even. God bless them both.

The funniest book I’ve ever read

Alexei Sayle’s Thatcher Stole My Trousers: laugh-out-loud moments on almost 
every page and a great insight into the beginnings of the UK comedy circuit by 
its venerable godfather, who rather gloriously looks a lot like me.

The funniest word

Twenty-one years ago there was a line in my act that defined my existential 
angst: “I look like a short, fat kebab shop owner’s son but inside me there’s a 
tall, thin, high-cheekboned English ponce screaming to get out.” Ponce is a 
great word to emphasise on stage with visceral faux rage.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen

The season four Curb Your Enthusiasm finale, Opening Night. When it aired in 
2004, I stood on my bed in a New York hotel and applauded. Multiple storylines 
come to stunning conclusions when Larry David is on Broadway doing Max 
Bialystock in The Producers. Thrilling.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned

Underwear with David Hasselhoff on the crotch. I wear them now and again when 
I’m ill or feeling slightly vulnerable.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen

Woody Allen’s Bananas <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXDjfJ5imD4>. It’s such 
a silly film; I’ve only recently realised it’s a political masterpiece. It 
taught me an important showbiz lesson: funny first, politics second.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

The current rise of nationalism and fascism. We’re laughing all the way to the 
1930s.
