Nils Petersen scored late for Freiburg to beat Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> 2-1 and escape the 
relegation zone.

Mitchell Weiser crossed for Bastian Schweinsteiger to put Bayern ahead after 
12 minutes, but Admir Mehmedi equalized with a fine individual effort after 
Schweinsteiger lost the ball in the 33rd minute.

Schweinsteiger hit the crossbar with a free-kick in the second half as Bayern 
Munich had 17 efforts on goal compared with the home side’s nine, only for 
Petersen to claim the late winner.

“Today we had a bit of luck after so many weeks of misfortune,” the Freiburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/freiburg> coach, Christian Streich, said.
