Ling, 49, was appointed in early November on a two-and-a-half year contract 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/03/martin-ling-appointed-manager-swindon-town>
, returning to the County Ground having made nearly 200 appearances in two 
difference spells for Swindon as a player.

Ling won five of his first six matches in charge of Swindon but leaves the 
Robins in 16th place in League One having suffered back-to-back defeats by 
Gillingham and Burton over the Christmas period.

Taking the reins at Swindon following the sacking of Mark Cooper, Ling’s 
appointment was his first since leaving the Torquay job in April 2013, having 
stepped away from the club in January due to his battle with depression. 
Swindon have said they will release a statement in ‘due course’.

Ling was an integral part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League 
in 1992-93 – the Robins’ only season in the top flight. He began his managerial 
career with a five-and-a-half year spell at Leyton Orient before further spells 
at Cambridge and then Torquay.

Ling’s son, Sam, currently on the books of Orient, tweeted: “He wants to thank 
everyone at Swindon for the support he was given but his family and health are 
more important than anything.”
