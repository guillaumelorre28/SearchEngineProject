Werder Bremen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen> are ready to 
sign Miroslav Klose if the opportunity arises, the Bundesliga club said on 
Wednesday.

The Lazio <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> player, who won the 
World Cup with Germany last year and is the tournament’s all-time top scorer, 
played at Werder from 2004-07, scoring 53 goals in 89 matches, before joining 
Bayern Munich and then moving to Italy in 2011.

Werder’s coach, Viktor Skripnik, said: “It would be a dream. If everything 
fits why would we ever say no, that is if Klose is still fit and he also has 
the will to come to Bremen.

“He is a super forward with huge experience. My boys can only profit from 
that.”

The 36-year-old, whose contract at Lazio runs out at the end of the season, 
has dropped down the pecking order at the Italian club in the current campaign, 
mostly coming on as a substitute.

“Should Klose be available on the market it is something that we will look 
into,” Werder’s sports director, Thomas Eichin, told Sport Bild magazine. “He 
has a great Werder past and has a great name in Bremen.”

Werder, champions in 2004, have been struggling this season and are in 16th 
place on the relegation play-off spot with the league resuming on 30 January.
