A message from Michael Carrick, speaking to SkySports, with regard to the 
United crisis talk and the clamour for his inclusion: “The manager knows what I 
can do just like he knows what every player can do, I’m not going to change the 
way I play now. You play some games, you don’t play some games, that’s how it 
goes ... I think everyone needs to calm down a bit.”

Full-time: Northampton 1-3 Manchester United

United end their three-match losing streak and gain some respite before 
Saturday’s clash with the Premier League champions. Mourinho might also have 
gained some clues about his lineup for that match, most obviously thanks to 
Michael Carrick, who ran midfield here with trademark zip, precision and 
intelligence. Herrera put forward a fair case for inclusion, too, as United’s 
had a better balance going forward. They still looked a little ropey at the 
back, however, and it’s unlikely that Blind will be put back into the startling 
lineup against the speedsters of Leicester. Rooney, since you ask, worked hard 
without looking sharp.

79 min: That’s more encouraging for Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton>. Taylor swings in a 
dangerous delivery from the right and Smalling is forced to head it behind for 
a corner. But the corner is dealt with easily.

Northampton 1-3 United (Rashford 75)

How about this for evidence that United’s luck is turning!? Rashford chases a 
long hoof intoNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> 
territory. Smith, the goalkeeper, came to the edge of his box to whack clear 
but apparently became unnerved by the sight of Rashford charging towards him 
... and kicked fresh air before falling over! Rashford resisted any temptation 
to make a smart comment before walking the ball into the net. Game over, 
full-blown United crisis averted.

GOAL! Northampton 1-2 United (Herrera 67)

That’s how to banish anxiety! Schneiderlin wins the ball strongly in midfield 
and strides forward before passing to Rashford, who surveys his options and 
then tees up Herrera, who drills a beautiful low shot into the net from over 20 
yards!

62 min: Young crosses from the right and is then caught by a late sliding

59 min: United ping the ball around about 30 yards from the Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> goal. But the hosts were 
well organised and dynamic and United can’t find a way through. Herrera decides 
to go direct, opening fire from 25 yards. It whizzes wide off the outside of 
the post!

48 min: United, perhaps fuelled by their anger about that tackle (which, 
thankfully, did not injure Memphis), crank up the tempo. Rooney fizzes the ball 
wide to Young, who smashes another teasing low cross into the six-yard area.

46 min: As the teams return to the pitch with the same personnel as ended the 
first half, the camera lingers on Mourinho, sitting sullen-faced in the dugout 
and chewing gum: at least that much is reminiscent of Alex Ferguson.

“I have a question for Dan Lucas,” announces Matt Turner “Did he used to go to 
the cinema at Sixfields, like, sat in the stands watching a film on some big, 
portable screen? Or did there used to be a proper cinema where Sixfields now 
stands? Either way, today we are treated to a tense psychological thriller that 
closely examines the folly of overwrought expectations and human frailty. 
Thumbs up.”

Half-time: Northampton 1-1 Man United

United looked serenely comfortable for most of the half and took a deserved 
lead through the regal Carrick. But as soon as Northampton showed a bit of 
defiance, the jitters crept back and United crumbled, conceding a penalty. Now
Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> sense a shock 
and United must fear entering Stage 4 of the Big Club Crisis. Mourinho said on 
Sunday that some of his players are struggling to cope with negativity, so the 
second half here has become quite a test.

44 min: A mighty boot from the back puts United in more bother. Smalling was 
caught unaware and Taylor darted past him. Romero charged off his line to punch 
clear at the edge of the area, following on into the attacker. Good goalkeeping.

A message from Michael Carrick, speaking to SkySports, with regard to the 
United crisis talk and the clamour for his inclusion: “The manager knows what I 
can do just like he knows what every player can do, I’m not going to change the 
way I play now. You play some games, you don’t play some games, that’s how it 
goes ... I think everyone needs to calm down a bit.”
 
United end their three-match losing streak and gain some respite before 
Saturday’s clash with the Premier League champions. Mourinho might also have 
gained some clues about his lineup for that match, most obviously thanks to 
Michael Carrick, who ran midfield here with trademark zip, precision and 
intelligence. Herrera put forward a fair case for inclusion, too, as United’s 
had a better balance going forward. They still looked a little ropey at the 
back, however, and it’s unlikely that Blind will be put back into the startling 
lineup against the speedsters of Leicester. Rooney, since you ask, worked hard 
without looking sharp.

90 min: United take the freekick shot and begin running down the clock. 
 
89 min: United bungle the freekick but get another one as Potter takes down 
Rooney.

88 min: O’Toole penalised for pushing over Herrera. Freekick to United just to 
the right of theNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> 
box. Rooney and Young loom...
 
85 min: Taylor nicks the ball off a prancing Ibrahimovic. United have gone in 
front since the Swede’s introduction but that’s been a mere coincidence.
 
83 min: Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> are at 
least trying to finish on the front foot. Hoskins has a pop fro the edge of the 
area. But he was off balance and the sends the ball towards the folks on the 
hill.
 
81 min: Hoskins slips the ball wide to Moloney. The fullback crosses. Carrick 
heads it away.
 
79 min: That’s more encouraging for Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton>. Taylor swings in a 
dangerous delivery from the right and Smalling is forced to head it behind for 
a corner. But the corner is dealt with easily.
 
78 min: Smalling wins another header, repelling another aerial attack by 
Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton>. There doesn’t 
appear to be any way back into this game for the home side.
 
How about this for evidence that United’s luck is turning!? Rashford chases a 
long hoof intoNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> 
territory. Smith, the goalkeeper, came to the edge of his box to whack clear 
but apparently became unnerved by the sight of Rashford charging towards him 
... and kicked fresh air before falling over! Rashford resisted any temptation 
to make a smart comment before walking the ball into the net. Game over, 
full-blown United crisis averted.

74 min: Hoskins scurries down the right before being shunted off the ball by 
Blind, who cops a booking.Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> have a freekick in a 
dangerous crossing position.
 
United substitution: Fellaini on, Schneiderlin off.

Northampton substitution: Richards on, McCourt off.
 
71 min: Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> began 
mounting a comeback as soon as they fell behind in the first half, but United 
seem intent on quashing any such notions this time. The hosts can’t get a look 
in.
 
That’s how to banish anxiety! Schneiderlin wins the ball strongly in midfield 
and strides forward before passing to Rashford, who surveys his options and 
then tees up Herrera, who drills a beautiful low shot into the net from over 20 
yards!

67 min: A dreadful attempted pass by Schneiderlin goes straight into touch. 
Mourinho is on his feet, looking anxious.
 
Northampton substitution: Potter on, Gorre off. 
 
65 min: Another punch clear by Smith, this time from a cross by Rooney. 
 
63 min: Carrick spanks the ball wide to Rashford. The teenager takes it down 
nicely and then floats a cross towards the back post. Smith punches it away 
before it reaches Ibrahimovic.
 
62 min: Young crosses from the right and is then caught by a late sliding 
tackle by Gorre. He goes down and calls for treatment. Hard to know how hut he 
is but he’s certainly entitled to be aggrieved.
 
59 min: United ping the ball around about 30 yards from the Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> goal. But the hosts were 
well organised and dynamic and United can’t find a way through. Herrera decides 
to go direct, opening fire from 25 yards. It whizzes wide off the outside of 
the post!
 
57 min: A wrongly awarded freekick (McCourt handled the ball) allows 
Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> to send the ball 
into the United box. Smalling nods it away.
 
56 min: Rashford, playing wide on the left, tries to scamper past Moloney but 
is shepherded out of play by the fullback.
 
United substitutions: Rashford and Ibrahimovic on, Memphis and Fosu-Mensah 
off. Mourinho’s not mucking around.

52 min: Lovely drag-back by Carrick to create an angle for a threaded pass 
through to Memphis, who just fails to collect it on the run. Carrick has been 
United’s best player by far.
 
50 min: Young swings in yet another cross. Smith fumbles it and is grateful 
that Moloney is on hand to tap it out for a corner. “Famous Northamptontonians 
also include Matt Smith and Alan Carr, whose father was manager of the Cobblers 
in the 80s,” informs John Hope.
 
48 min: United, perhaps fuelled by their anger about that tackle (which, 
thankfully, did not injure Memphis), crank up the tempo. Rooney fizzes the ball 
wide to Young, who smashes another teasing low cross into the six-yard area.
Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> defend it well.
 
47 min: McCourt booked for a ridiculous tackle from behind on Memphis. United 
players are furious and they are right: that should have been a red.
 Rooney’s not happy with that decision. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters  
46 min: As the teams return to the pitch with the same personnel as ended the 
first half, the camera lingers on Mourinho, sitting sullen-faced in the dugout 
and chewing gum: at least that much is reminiscent of Alex Ferguson.
 
“I have a question for Dan Lucas,” announces Matt Turner “Did he used to go to 
the cinema at Sixfields, like, sat in the stands watching a film on some big, 
portable screen? Or did there used to be a proper cinema where Sixfields now 
stands? Either way, today we are treated to a tense psychological thriller that 
closely examines the folly of overwrought expectations and human frailty. 
Thumbs up.”
 
Mourinho stomps down the tunnel to mocking chants from the home fans of: 
“You’re getting sacked in the morning!”
 
United looked serenely comfortable for most of the half and took a deserved 
lead through the regal Carrick. But as soon as Northampton showed a bit of 
defiance, the jitters crept back and United crumbled, conceding a penalty. Now
Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton> sense a shock 
and United must fear entering Stage 4 of the Big Club Crisis. Mourinho said on 
Sunday that some of his players are struggling to cope with negativity, so the 
second half here has become quite a test.

44 min: A mighty boot from the back puts United in more bother. Smalling was 
caught unaware and Taylor darted past him. Romero charged off his line to punch 
clear at the edge of the area, following on into the attacker. Good goalkeeping.
