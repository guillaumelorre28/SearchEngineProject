Right then. The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> fifth

ballmen, you ask? Ruud Gullit and Mark Lawrenson. Lovely stuff.

Peterborough United, also in the third tier, will have to get past a 
fourth-round replay with West Brom before they can start dreaming of bigger 
things.

“I’ll be keeping an eye on Leeds United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited>,” emails Ezra Finkelstein. 
“Hopefully we can get a top premier league team, to make it a David vs Goliath 
clash.” Leeds hosting Man Utd is always good fun. There are plenty of potential 
derbies in that list too – Merseyside, Manchester, and most corners of London.

Everton and Chelsea were too good for their respective lower-league opposition 
today, which makes the fifth round draw read like a list of Premier League 
clubs new and old.Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> 
Town, currently 20th in League One, are the obvious outliers looking for a big 
away trip having knocked out Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday with a dramatic 
late winner.
