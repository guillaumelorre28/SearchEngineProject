The Scotland forward Steven Fletcher scored a late goal and made another as 
Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> overcame the amateur 
side Trélissac 2-0 to secure a place in the quarter-finals of the Coupe de 
France.

Fletcher, signed on loan from Sunderland, produced a clever lay-off to set up 
Romain Alessandrini on the edge of the penalty area after 33 minutes to settle 
the Ligue 1 side, who had to rely on a superb early save from Steve Mandanda to 
prevent Ricardo Sophie putting the hosts, from south-west France and who play 
in the fourth divsion, ahead.

After heading over and then shooting just wide in the second half, Fletcher 
made sure there would be no late drama when he poked in a right-wing cross from 
Abdelaziz Barrada.

It could, though, have proved a testing night at a wet Stade Chaban-Delmas in 
Bordeaux if Mandanda had not been alert to make a smart block as Sophie muscled 
into the penalty area inside the opening two minutes.

Marseille – mid-table in Ligue 1, but with only a defeat by the runaway 
leaders Paris Saint-Germain since November – picked up the pace as 
Georges-Kevin Nkoudou hit the post before Alessandrini swept them ahead, 
crashing the ball into the roof of the net.

Mandanda produced another couple of smart saves, before the top-flight side’s 
experience told as they created several good chances. Fletcher’s late second 
sealed a quarter-final place against US Granville of the fifth division.

Abou Diaby was an unused substitute, having been included in Marseille’s 
match-day squad for the first time since his summer move from Arsenal.
