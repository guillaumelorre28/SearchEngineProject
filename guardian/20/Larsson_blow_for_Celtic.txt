Henrik Larsson is likely to miss four crucial matches after suffering a double 
fracture of the jaw yesterday in a 14th-minute collision with Gustave Bahoken.

His manager Martin O'Neill said Larsson would undergo immediate surgery and 
will miss both legs of the Uefa Cup fourth-round tie with Stuttgart plus the 
Old Firm derbies against Rangers in the league and the CIS Cup Final.

O'Neill added: "I'm not sure about the time but I'm hoping he'll be back 
before the end of the season."Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, already missing John Hartson 
after a midweek clash with O'Neill, were lifted to victory by Shaun Maloney, 
Larsson's substitute.

Maloney, 20, made the most of his chance by taking the two free-kicks from 
which Momo Sylla and Chris Sutton scored Celtic's comeback goals.

Livingston <https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston>, with their 
multinational mixture from Spain, France, Trinidad, Ivory Coast, Australia, 
Cameroon and indeed Scotland, had taken the lead after 52 minutes through 
Rolando Zarate.

Celtic equalised when Maloney's 76th-minute free-kick rebounded from a post 
for Sylla to slide home. Eight minutes later another Mahoney free-kick was 
scrambled away by the goalkeeper Alan Main but only as far as Sutton who forced 
in the winner.

 Man of the match:  Shaun Maloney (Celtic)
