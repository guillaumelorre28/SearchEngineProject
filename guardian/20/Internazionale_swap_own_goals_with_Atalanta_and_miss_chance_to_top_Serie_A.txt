The home side took the lead in the 17th minute when Inter’s Colombian defender 
Jeison Murillo scored an own goal, diverting Boukary Dramé’s cross past 
Handanovic. Inter equalised in the 25th minute when the Atalanta defender 
Rafael Tolói repeated the feat. Off-balance, the Brazilian mis-hit Mauro 
Icardi’s cross into the roof of his own net.

In the second half, Atalanta had the better chances but Handanovic kept the 
scores level with a series of outstanding saves, notably from a Luca Cigarini 
effort in the 59th minute.

The draw meant Roberto Mancini’s men missed the opportunity to replace Napoli 
asSerie A <https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> leaders, if 
only briefly. Instead, they are in second place on 40 points, one behind the 
leaders who were meeting Sassuolo later on Saturday.

Atalanta moved into 11th, leapfrogging Udinese who host Juventus on Sunday. 
Inter have now lost two of their last three fixtures, including a surprise 1-0
loss to Sassuolo
