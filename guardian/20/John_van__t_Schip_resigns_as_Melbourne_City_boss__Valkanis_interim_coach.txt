Melbourne City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/melbourne-city> head 
coach John van ‘t Schip has stood down with immediate effect citing a desire to 
return to the Netherlands to care for his seriously ill father.

The club released a brief statement on Tuesday in which they thanked Van ‘t 
Schip for his services to the club.

“John’s reaction to his personal circumstances is testament to the man he is 
and why he has been such an important contributor to the club’s development 
both on and off the field – culminating in guiding our men’s first team to its 
maiden trophy. He has our ongoing gratitude and support as his focus rightly 
turns to his family,” said club chairman, City Football Group’s Khaldoon Al 
Mubarak.

Assistant coach Michael Valkanis has been appointed interim first-team coach 
with immediate effect while the club conducts a search for a permanent 
replacement for Van ’t Schip.

The Dutch former international was the inaugural head coach of the then 
Melbourne Heart, and spent six seasons at the club across two spells in charge, 
overseeing 144A-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> games 
with a win ratio of 36%.

Van ‘t Schip guided Heart/City to three finals series appearances, winning the 
club’s first silverware earlier this season with a 1-0 victory over Sydney FC 
in the FFA Cup final.

Commenting on his decision Van’t Schip said, “I have been faced with a choice 
between my family in Holland and my work here in Australia and there was only 
one right decision.

“I did not want my personal circumstances to impact the club in any way. I am 
part of a strong coaching team that has been carefully nurtured over the last 
three years and that gives me great confidence that this situation will not 
adversely affect the club’s progress.

“I would like to thank everyone at Melbourne City and the City Football Group 
for their support. The club’s development since its creation will always be a 
source of great personal pride to me.”
