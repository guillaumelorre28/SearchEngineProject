Espanyol’s Pape Diop headed in his third goal in as many games to give the 
hosts the lead near the half-hour mark but Fernando Torres expertly controlled 
Koke’s lobbed pass before driving in the equaliser in the 35th minute.

Antoine Griezmann put the visitors in charge by scoring off the upright after 
a brilliant buildup between Koke and Torres in the 58th minute. The France 
forward extended his league scoring streak to seven matches with his 20th goal 
of the competition this season.

Koke and Torres connected again to seal the win with two minutes left, this 
time the striker passing for Koke to head in and cap their superb joint 
performance.
