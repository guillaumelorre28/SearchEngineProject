The chief executive of the Football League, Shaun Harvey, said: “With flood 
recovery work continuing at Brunton Park, we’d like to thankBlackburn Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackburn> for offering the use of Ewood 
Park to ensure that Carlisle United can fulfil their first fixture of the new 
year against Plymouth Argyle. The Football League Board has ratified the venue 
change and we’ll continue to liaise with all three clubs, offering any 
assistance required.”

Preston have already agreed to host Carlisle’s match against Notts County on 
19 December, which leaves only the home game against Hartlepool on 28 December 
presently without a venue while repairs are made to the ground.

“At times like this, it is important that members of the football family stick 
together,” said Blackburn Rovers’ managing director, Derek Shaw. “So we were 
only too happy to help out. The damage sustained at Brunton Park must be truly 
devastating and our deepest sympathies go out to everyone connected to the club 
and to all those affected by the floods in theCarlisle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> community.”
