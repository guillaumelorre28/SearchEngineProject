Ah, Vanilla Ice. Cheeseball rapper, Madonna-fondler and originator of the 
“white boy fade”, the haircut that’s taking over the world right now.

For men who like to appear as if they haven’t thrown money and assorted goo at 
their hair, the fade is perfect. Pompadour-like at the top and army-short at 
the back and sides, it looks as if it has taken no time. An easy win, then, and 
currently worn by those style titans Zayn Malik and Mr Robot’s Rami Malek.

The trick is not to let your number 2 slip too seamlessly into your number 3 
(that’s hair parlance, FYI). There should be a distinct point between the crown 
and the back of the head, but not so much that it looks as if you’re wearing a 
hat.
