Once upon a time, as I have wistfully remarked before, in the Good Old Days 
before the printed word was faced by the slings and arrows of electronic 
publishing, the happy crossword editor could say to setters (and solvers) that 
a word was not legitimate crossword fodder unless it could be found in the 
latest edition of one of the reputable single-volume dictionaries. (Some 
editors were prepared to go even further and insist that it had to be in a 
specified dictionary, often Chambers.)

I am not sure that was ever a very good defensive position to adopt. You will 
find words like floccinaucinihilipilification (which those with a Classical 
education may recognise as meaning 'setting at little or no value') that should 
not, in my view, appear in a family crossword, even when they are there in 
Chambers. On the other hand, there are words or phrases like, iPad or 
extraordinary rendition, that I think most Guardian solvers would regard as 
fair game, even if they cannot yet be found in a published dictionary. But, on 
top of all that, there is a further whole problem area: it is new jargon.

For example, the suggestion was made to me earlier this year by LB that 
'anagrind' should be accepted as a legitimate word for crossword purposes and 
that we should start a campaign for it to be so recognised by the editors of 
the leading English language dictionaries. In case some of you are unfamiliar 
with the term (now in common usage among crossword setters) it means an anagram 
indicator. Its etymology is the contraction of ANAGR(am)/IND(icator). My 
position on this one is still the uncomfortable one of sitting on the fence. I 
accept that crossword setters and most dedicated crossword groupies recognise 
the word. But I am not sure that it has passed the critical test (now less 
clearly definably than it was in the past) of having properly entered into the 
language. I should much value your thoughts on this and related issues, as the 
question of when and how a word becomes fair in crosswords becomes daily less 
easy to answer.

There were widespread protests at the start of the year about the effect on 
the layout of the printed Cryptic and Quick crossword puzzles as a result of 
the decision to abolish a separate Sports section on four days of the week and 
to incorporate sport into the main body of the paper. The resultant redesign of 
the Cryptic so that it lay across the centre fold was quickly put right and it 
is now always in the bottom part of the inside back page, so that the paper can 
be folded in four for those who need to solve the puzzle in a confined space. 
The problem with the Quick was that the type size for the clues had to be 
greatly reduced to fit the space made available, to the point where they were 
very hard to read. As I hope Quick aficionados will have seen, the puzzle has 
been designed again, enabling the type size for the clues to be increased to a 
more comfortable level.

As many of you will have noticed Rufus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rufus> (Roger Squires) celebrated his 80th 
birthday on 22 February. The Editor of the Guardian,Alan Rusbridger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger?INTCMP=SRCH>, gave a party 
in his honour the previous evening at which fulsome tributes were paid to his 
hugely popular, benevolent and scrupulously fair style of clues.Araucaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/araucaria?INTCMP=SRCH> had hoped to be 
there but, in the event could not be, so he sent a poem instead. It was already 
been published inAlan Connor's blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog> on the crossword home 
page. But, for those who did not read it there, here again is the tribute from 
one master setter to another:

Master magician Roger Squires
For eighty years has graced the land,
And still his mental sleight of hand
Perplexes, conjures and inspires.
Not his the strained linguistic mires
That only nerds can understand;
His clues, meticulously planned,
Delight us as they cross our wires.

So, as we toast our honoured guest,
Best wishes, thanks and this behest â€“
Pray relish and don't rue the fuss
We make of you dear Rufus: plus
Remember this, young Master Squires:
No cruciverbalist retires.

the correct ones and the wrong person named as the winner of the crossword. 
This has now been corrected.
