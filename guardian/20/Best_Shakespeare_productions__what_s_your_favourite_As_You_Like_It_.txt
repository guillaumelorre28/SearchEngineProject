I've seen some golden Rosalinds in my time: Vanessa Redgrave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/feb/21/observer-profile-vanessa-redgrave>
 (1961),Susan Fleetwood 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-susan-fleetwood-1575591.html>
 (1980) andPippa Nixon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/25/as-you-like-it-review> (2013) 
all for the Royal Shakespeare Company as well as Maggie Smith at Stratford 
festival, in Ontario (1977), and Janet McTeer at the Royal Exchange Manchester 
(1986). But the production that still haunts me isDeclan Donnellan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/04/theatre>'s all-male Cheek by 
Jowl version <http://www.cheekbyjowl.com/as_you_like_it.php> (1991). It was 
both festive and disturbing and brought out, as no other production I've seen 
has, the play's strange erotic undercurrents.

The sight of Adrian Lester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/09/adrian-lester-acting-profession> 
– a man playing a woman disguised as a man – being courted by Patrick Toomey's 
unabashedly virileOrlando 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/26/arts/review-theater-as-you-like-it-in-its-native-language.html>
 left one questioning the rigid certainties of gender. By beginning the play 
with "all the world's a stage", and the whole cast assembled in black trousers 
and white shirts, Donnellan reminded us of the centrality of role-playing and 
Nick Ormerod's design, unlike those forest sets where you can't see the wooed 
for the trees, had a magical simplicity.
