Asking me for my favourite restaurants is a bit like insisting I choose my 
favourite child: genuinely agonising. It’s a question I get asked on a weekly 
basis (the restaurant one, not the children) and, just as regularly, the answer 
will change. But for every different response, the reasons they’re my 
favourites remain the same. And it’s not because of cheffy showing off or 
experimentation, the perfection of the linen or the opulence of the decor. The 
key determinant is: would I go back? It surprises me how many times – even 
after a technically flawless meal – the answer to my own question is to shake 
my head: nope.

Restaurants <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/restaurants> are about 
far more than the cooking. (I’d never say I was a food critic; my job is 
restaurant reviewer.) In some of the restaurants on this list, the food isn’t 
the main draw by any stretch of the imagination. But would I go back tomorrow, 
and the tomorrow after that? Yes, please.

Even after 15 years of doing this gig (plus 10 years of actually working in 
restaurants), when I wake up in the morning knowing I’m off out to lunch, I 
feel uplifted and excited, and immensely privileged that I get to do this for a 
living. Once upon a time, I used to scour Michelin, especially when travelling, 
enduring many a hushed, clenched room and dishes where red peppers were 
tortured to look like Mondrians. This has caused a bit of an allergy to the 
stressy, tweezered school of cuisine, so I’m afraid you won’t find many 
multi-course tasting menus here. (There are a couple, but they’re the work of 
chefs who understand the term ‘hospitality’, and still see food as a joy, a 
pleasure, rather than an opportunity to waggle their appendages.)

I’m sorry if your favourite isn’t here, and I apologise in advance to Wales, 
Birmingham, Auchenshuggle. These are my favourite restaurants, not the UK’s 
best, or the country’s top, or any other such arbitrary listicle. Yes, my 
choices may be London-heavy, but do bear in mind that a) I do not live there, 
and b) it’s simply where the highest concentration of good restaurants in the 
UK is to be found. (If I’d been allowed out of the UK, you would be reading 
about the likes ofJoe Beef in Montreal <http://www.joebeef.ca>, Cibus in Puglia 
<http://www.ristorantecibus.it/index.php?pg=1&view=contenuto&lang=en> and the 
Swan Oyster Depot in San Francisco <http://www.sfswanoysterdepot.com>.) And 
because I visit incognito, I get the same experience you would: no rolling out 
the red carpet, no special treatment or extra little freebies.

My favourites may not suit your purposes if you want to crunch deals in an 
atmosphere designed for Masters of the Universe. Or to stand in line for hours 
with nothing to show for it but a meat sandwich that takes 30 seconds to eat. 
Or spray yourself orange and dance on tables (yes,STK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/16/stk-london-wc2-restaurant-review>
, I’m looking at you). But the more restaurants I eat in, the more I’m devoted 
to those that send me out into the night thinking not ‘I wonder how the chef 
got the foraged sea asters to do that?’ but ‘That was top fun’.

My favourite places are those where staff look genuinely pleased to see you, 
where there’s a buzz of contented customers, where the menu gives you a little 
thrill because there are so many things on it that you’d like to eat. And where 
you always fancy just the one more glass from an alluring, ungreedy wine list. 
I’m afraid I no longer much care aboutMichelin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/michelin-guide> and The World’s 50 
Best 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/02/worlds-50-best-restaurants-list-spanish-eatery-reclaims-crown>
, nor do I particularly worry about lack of upholstery in the seating (I’m 
furnished with plenty of my own padding). But in each of the restaurants I talk 
about here, I can say – with hand on heart – I’ve had a really, really good 
time.

How odd of stern, handsome Edinburgh to be home to one of Scotland’s most 
rule-breaking and experimental restaurants. Surely Glasgow’s the place for that 
sort of thing? But while the Second City continues to gorge itself on burgers, 
this beautiful, family-run former warehouse and – yes – timberyard continues to 
plough its own merry furrowto haunting and hugely satisfying effect 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/18/timberyard-edinburgh-restaurant-review-oloughlin-marina>
.

The malted sourdough and whipped bone marrow butter that kick off proceedings 
are a ballsy statement of intent, and everything that arrives afterwards – 
“bite”, “small”, “main” and “sweet” – will raise eyebrows and smiles in equal 
measure. I’m particularly impressed with chef Ben Radford’s way with meat, 
taking fine Scottish produce and letting it sing, avoiding water baths and 
other culinary footerings. But he’s a wow with the lighter things in life, too: 
sodas flavoured with wild things, dishes scented with lovage or elderberry, or 
scattered with woodruff, sea buckthorn or fluffy, sharp Crowdie cheese.

Add to that Timberyard’s policy of aiming to achieve zero waste (they grow a 
lot of their own greens and herbs), a wonderful hidden interior courtyard where 
you can sit with tartan rugs over knees and an in-house butchery, and you get 
something very special indeed. And the cocktails – from a list on which charred 
tomato jostles with noble fir, burnt birch bark, even bone marrow – are simply 
not to be missed.

 ‘A long-standing seafood joint that cracks out classics with aplomb.’

11 Exchange Place, Glasgow G1, 0141-248 4055, roganoglasgow.com 
<http://www.roganoglasgow.com/>
There was a period of my life when I basically lived in the Rogano, a walnut 
booth in its beautiful, art-deco interior pressed into service as office, 
living room and occasionally – after a martini or several – very nearly bedroom.

The lobster bristling on the perfectly preserved Vitrolite exterior lets you 
know that seafood is the name of the game here. It was originally an oyster 
bar, and you can still prop up the bar necking the bivalves – plain or 
Rockefeller or, with dangerous modernity, fried in polenta. But the greatest 
treat for me was being able to afford the restaurant proper, for classic fish 
soup with rouille and croutons, and – oh! – lobster thermidor. With chips, of 
course.

On a recent visit, the exterior had sadly sprouted a “terrace” that was 
enthusiastically colonised by smokers. But inside it’s as seductively of 
another time as ever. And the rosy langoustines as yielding and sweet.

I always thought Rogano was one of those vintage entertainment palace names, 
like Alhambra, Locarno, Gaumont, but apparently it’s the elision of the name of 
the original owner, Mr Roger, with “ANOther” silent partner. Love this. Maybe 
one of these days, if I go back often enough, I might even score the legendary 
Table 16.

What a location – this place has the sort of view over loch and castle that 
tourist boards dream of. And in this whitewashed former croft in Argyll, the 
team of chef Pam Brunton and front-of-house Rob Latimer aredelivering cooking 
that’s every bit as dramatic as the panorama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/15/inver-strathlachlan-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
.

You can sit in the little bar and eat crab fished from those Loch Fyne waters 
and served simply with homemade sourdough and hand-churned butter. Or call by 
(unlikely, given its remoteness) for fresh scones, cookies and coffee in the 
afternoon, nabbing one of the outdoor benches to breathe in the cool, clean 
air. But dinner in the pale, Nordic-looking dining room with its wood fire is a 
real event, worth travelling over hill and dale for. Perhaps there might be a 
slab of purest white Gigha halibut served with a tangle of acidulated potato, a 
clever and delicious play on fish and chips; or that old stalwart of scallops 
with black pudding reinvented as a black pudding bun with raw scallop nestling 
at its centre. Isle of Bute lamb will probably be some of the finest you’ve 
ever eaten – swoonworthy. Dishes might be scattered with wild herbs, 
meadowsweet and scurvy grass, pea tendrils, wild garlic, or delicate flowers, 
all collected by the team. A wee beauty.

La Parmigiana <http://www.laparmigiana.co.uk/>

447 Great Western Road, Glasgow G12, 0141-334 0686
Chef and owner Sandro Giovanizzi can’t be said to be one of the world’s great 
kitchen innovators – I’m pretty sure that the menu served when they opened in 
1978 would look pretty much like the one on offer today – but that’s not what 
La Parmigiana is all about. It’s about comfort, familiarity, the knowledge that 
the fine elastic pasta for the trademark lobster ravioli will be homemade with 
free-range eggs and Italian 00 flour, the little parcels stuffed to bursting 
with shellfish, the creamy sauce rich with their shells. And that the beef will 
be finest Scottish, as will the salmon, but the technique will be purest 
Italian.

The snug, red walls have welcomed lots of stars over the years – I love the 
photos of the likes ofLionel Richie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/lionel-richie> and Sex And The City’s Kim 
Cattrall <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kim-cattrall> on the website – 
but the restaurant quietly goes about the business of turning happy customers 
into regulars who’ll come back time and time again. Senior staff treat old and 
young with equal grace. The small restaurant has been the setting for more 
O’Loughlin family parties than any other, the most recent for a 90-year-old 
who’s sadly no longer with us. He had a wonderful time.

 Sticky Walnut: ‘Good simplicity is notoriously difficult to achieve.’

11 Charles Street, Hoole, Chester, 01244 400400
Chef/owner Gary Usher may have stood down from his perch as funniest chef on 
Twitter <https://twitter.com/StickyWalnut> (a shame, because his uncensored 
rants, from lacerating soul-searching to lambasting the “conosurs” on 
TripAdvisor, was one of social media’s top diversions), but his delicious, 
plainly decorated two-storey bistro in Hoole garners new fans daily.

Usher is typically self-deprecating about the food that comes out of his 
kitchen, insisting that it’s simple stuff. But good simplicity is notoriously 
difficult to achieve – there’s no hiding place – andhis team carry it off every 
time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/14/sticky-walnut-chester-restaurant-review>
. Fluffy foccaccia with a seductive, oily crust; fine meat – lesser-loved cuts 
such as shin, maybe, or Jacob’s ladder, or pig’s cheeks, slow-braised into 
spoonable tenderness. The eponymous “sticky walnuts” served with roast baby 
beets, spicy pumpkin seeds and fresh goat’s curd are now poshly named “walnut 
praline”, but they’re still there. Game is a real strength, and I could develop 
a serious habit for their blue-cheese arancini.

Usher successfully crowdfunded a baby Sticky, called Burnt Truffle 
<http://www.burnttruffle.net>, in the Wirral, and rumour has it that he’s 
looking at opening Sticky Mk III in Manchester. If so, lucky Manchester.

Van Zeller <http://www.vanzellerrestaurants.co.uk>

8 Montpellier Street, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 01423 508762,
It was during a riotously greedy trip around God’s Own Country that I first 
came across Tom Van Zeller’s small Harrogate restaurant. Of all the places I 
visited,it’s this one I’m drawn back to 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/19/van-zeller-harrogate-restaurant-review>
 – despite it being far, far away from my own back yard.

In a boutique-lined street in the city’s pretty Montpellier Quarter, it 
doesn’t look like much at first, especially compared with some of Yorkshire’s 
other culinary stars, who go in for cosy tradition and open fires in a big way. 
But the restrained, monochrome interior allows Van Zeller’s creativity to shine 
where it belongs: on the plates.

One of his menu stalwarts – rabbit, marmalade, carrot, soil – is a bucolic 
romp on a plain white dish: endless iterations of the root vegetable, pickled, 
raw, cooked; the most delicate, tender bunny; a “soil” made from dark, fragrant 
mushrooms. It’s a genuine classic, and oneI’m happy to rave about any 
opportunity I get 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/restaurant-plates-beautiful-complicated-marina-oloughlin>
. Newer dishes are delicate and complex – chicken wings with scallops, 
cauliflower and truffle; or the richness of smoked eel given freshness and zing 
by cucumber, chervil, apple and goat’s curd – without losing sight of that 
essential deliciousness. And, yes, they’re beautiful.

I may not give much of a damn about Michelin stars, but with his thoughtful, 
intricate cooking, Tom Van Zeller clearly does. Why he isn’t tripping over the 
things is beyond me.

A supermarket in Manchester’s Chinatown is the unlikely setting for some of 
the most authentic-tasting, vibrant Thai cooking I’ve had in the UK. The 
kitchen’s forte is noodles, lovely, wriggly noodles with plenty of bite in 
broths shimmering with gardens’ worth of herbs. They might brim with pokey Thai 
chillies, pink shallots, even pig’s blood. The owners regularly fly in produce 
from Thailand, fresh peppercorns almost juicy with citrussy fire, lime leaves, 
morning glory, stink beans, pea aubergines, andChef May makes fine use of them

condiments: white pepper, crushed peanuts, tamarind, chilli vinegar. But that’s 
for the hardcore – anyone needing more spicing clearly has a palate of purest 
asbestos.

Even sticky rice is wonderful (I’m not damning with faint praise: it’s tricky 
to get right), perfect for bunching into balls and dabbing into the 
sour-sweet-hot sauces or for soothing the burn from punchy, fermented pork 
sausages. If you’re lucky, there might be red duck curry on the menu, the paste 
heroically Technicolor in flavour. Siam Smiles is family-run, and the care and 
love they pour into each dish makes us customers feel like family, too.

Lunya <http://lunya.co.uk>

18–20 College Lane, Liverpool L1, 0151-706 9770 
This sprawling deli-meets-tapas bar serves some of the best Spanish produce to 
a devoted local crowd. Ceilings sprout first-class hams and sausages, many of 
which can be eaten in the brick-walled restaurant. Owner Peter Kinsella calls 
it “Catalan fusion” (gambas pil pil might come with vanilla; bacalao spring 
rolls; a lush arroz negro; very unSpanishly, they have a vegan menu, too), 
while Catalan scouse, laced with chorizo piccante and morcilla, is surely as 
fusion as it gets.

 Volta: ‘Everything you’d want from a neighbourhood joint.’ Photograph: 
Christopher Thomond for the Guardian 
167 Burton Road, West Didsbury, Manchester M20, 0161-448 8887
Along West Didsbury’s strip, it’s hard to throw a move without hitting a cool 
little hostelry or bistro. Despite being unnaturally drawn to the notorious
Crazy Wendy’s Thai <http://www.crazywendy.co.uk>, Volta is my favourite: 
everything you’d want from a neighborhood joint 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/12/olta-anchester-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
, plus a whole lot of rackety fun besides.

Some of that racketiness is possibly down to the fact that it’s owned by the 
DJ duo known as the Unabombers – Luke Cowdray and Justin Crawford – who serve 
food influenced by their world travels. So the menu could feature the likes of 
purple sprouting broccoli fried with shallot and chilli; monkfish ceviche in a 
coconut-enriched leche de tigre; lamb chops grilled with Lebanese spices; 
juniper-and-orange-smoked duck with giant couscous and pickled mushrooms. 
There’s always a board groaning with good charcuterie, with house pickles and 
fine bread fromTrove in Levenshulme <http://www.trovefoods.co.uk>.

It’s a cute little place, a bit battered around the edges, but in a decorative 
way. There’s a great drinks list and rare-breed roasts on a Sunday. The 
streetside terrace is a year-long party. Staff are lovely, too, and understand 
the concept of hospitality.

The Reliance <http://www.the-reliance.co.uk>

76-78 North Street, Leeds LS2, 0113-295 6060 
They make their own charcuterie at this raw-boned, striking boozer. Top stuff 
it is, too: velvety, scented with fennel, glistening with fat, and so good the 
city’s excellent charcuterie barFriends of Ham <http://www.friendsofham.com> 
stocks it. The rest of the menu isn’t to be sniffed at, either: the kitchen 
turns out food you want to eat, from the simple (Yorkshire pork sausages with 
mash and gravy) to the special (pigeon breast with charred spring onion and 
pomegranate molasses). Much more than a pub,the Reli is a fine eating house 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/18/the-reliance-leeds-restaurant-review>
, one with heart and soul.

 Bell’s Diner: ‘Has settled into a formula of being simply excellent.’

1-3 York Road, Montpelier, Bristol BS6, 0117 924 0357
A Bristol stalwart throughout many incarnations, Bell’s has now settled on 
being, simply, excellent. The corner site, with its vintage furnishings and 
series of little rooms, oozes charm. If it’s on the regularly changing menu –I 
described it as “Modern Brit with touches of Moro” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/29/bells-diner-bristol-restaurant-review>
 – the lamb Sainte Ménehould (fried, breaded breast with a vibrant herb sauce) 
should always be ordered. And an unusually fine wine list rewards enthusiastic 
exploration. An offshoot,Bellita <https://twitter.com/bellitabristol>, opened 
last week.

64 Degrees

53 Meeting House Lane, Brighton, 01273 770115
I like to pull a stool up to the counter at tiny (just 20-odd covers) 64 
Degrees in the Brighton Lanes and work my way through everything on the menu 
between two of us. It’s easy to do: the menu is short and the dishes small, but 
both punch far above their weight. Terse menu descriptions – lobster, wasabi, 
lime; mackerel, gooseberry, elderflower, cucumber; grouse breast, greengage, 
bread sauce – belie the sophistication of technique and the sheer thwack of 
flavour teased into every dish. This isa kitchen working at the top of its 
powers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/07/64-degrees-brighton-restaurant-review>
: the menu changes with dizzying regularity, and there’s something to dazzle 
and thrill each time you go.

Chef Michael Bremner runs his minuscule empire with energy and enthusiasm, and 
a Nutty Professor’s cupboard full of sophisticated kit, used to alluring effect 
to dehydrate kimchi for serving with sticky, addictive chicken wings crowned 
with a blue cheese foam, or to create discs of ethereal, savoury jelly. The 
gummy bear dessert, if it’s on, is a showstopper. I’ve no idea why their second 
outlet in central London didn’t last, but I’m inclined to blame the burghers of 
Pimlico, rather than this electrifyingly entertaining little number.

JoJo’s

2 Herne Bay Road, Tankerton, Kent, 01227 274591
JoJo’s hasn’t missed a beat since moving from a tiny main street restaurant to 
this handsome seafront building with plenty of alfresco tables. Produce is 
Kentish – especially the pristine fish – but flavours are Mediterranean: smoky 
grilled sardines, sharp with lemon and black pepper, excellent salumi and 
embutidos, mutton and feta koftas, mixed meze. Sadly, it’s no longer BYO (they 
used to add extra corkage if wine came from Tesco).

Pump Street Bakery

1 Pump Street, Orford, Suffolk, 01394 459829 
This stripped-back little outfit is justifiably renowned for its baking, but a 
lunch at the cafe – Orford-smoked salmon on home-baked Montreal bagel, maybe, 
or pulled pork and buttermilk coleslaw on a brioche bun – offers sheer pleasure 
(especially on a sunny outdoor table). I once went to a party here and woke up 
the next morning with my bag full of their sausage rolls. I’m happy to report 
they were every bit as glorious a day later.

LONDON

Brawn <http://www.brawn.co> 

49 Columbia Road, London E2, 020-7729 5692
A former small-industrial building – high ceilings, open kitchen, vast windows 
– Brawn is a looker with the sort of bones that mean it doesn’t need to try too 
hard. But both its understated beauty and the apparent simplicity of the menu 
belie the kitchen’s real commitment to deliciousness: punctilious sourcing, a 
passion for ingredients, real technique. Their pannacotta is the finest I’ve 
tasted, and what they do with vegetables, duck, lesser-loved cuts of meat…A 
newly re-found favourite for me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/16/brawn-london-e2-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>

 Rules: ‘The perfect location for pretending you’re landed gentry.’ Photograph: 
Christopher Thomond for the Guardian 
35 Maiden Lane, London WC2, 020-7836 5314 
As we speak, I’ve just booked a table here, for grouse. Rules comes roaring 
into its own in game season, its opulent, red-velvet-and-gilt grandeur the 
perfect location for pretending you’re landed gentry. I couldn’t love this 
restaurant more as the nights grow chill and, at Christmas,it is simply the 
ideal place to avoid any thoughts of shopping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/23/rules-london-wc2-restaurant-review>
 over a gallon or two of claret and perhaps an overstuffed, offal-rich suet 
pudding. Maybe under a tinsel-bedecked portrait of Maggie Thatcher.

As London’s oldest restaurant, Rules gets its fair share of the grown-up, 
wealthier tourist trade (last time I went, I collided with original supermodel 
Janice Dickinson), but it’s still home to real Londoners, many of whom look as 
though they’ve taken a brief hiatus from starring in a Punch cartoon.

Two great Rules secrets: 1) the bar – the martinis are among the best in the 
capital, but I’m not telling you how to find it, because it is mine, I tell 
you; and 2) it’s open all day, right through from midday to midnight. Grouse at 
4pm, then game chips, pâté and port, before rolling home to an early bed, 
preferably tucked in by Nanny. They’re not afraid to have a cocktail that’s 
dedicated to Kate Middleton; Rules is old enough to be above irony. “Game birds 
may contain lead shot,” they say. It’s a risk I’m willing to take.

José <http://www.josepizarro.com/jose-tapas-bar/>

104 Bermondsey Street, London SE1
Probably my favourite seat in the capital is at the window of tapas bar José 
with a glass of something saline and frosty – a manzanilla from Sanlucar de 
Barrameda, maybe – and a plate of purple, glistening, expertly cut Ibérico de 
bellota in front of me. (That it looks out on to another cracker, ultra-bistro
Casse-Croûte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/31/restaurants-casse-croute-london>
, is just a by-the-way.)

This tiny space gets mobbed almost the minute it throws open its doors at 
noon, so scoring the prime spot feels a real privilege. Most people treat José 
as tapas bars should be treated: grab an Estrella Damm or glass of txacoli, a 
plate of croquetas (and, when they taste the wonder that are chef José 
Pizarro’s croquetas, immediately order another), and then move on. Me, though, 
I bed in. As soon as they think they’re getting rid of me, or another punter 
reckons they might be in line for my perch and gives me the hard stare, I’ll 
order something else: a wobbly-centred tortilla, crisp-fried hake with allioli, 
baby chicken with nutty romesco sauce. Anything, really – it’ll all be 
gorgeous. Pizarro’s background in the Spanish importers (and now restaurateurs)
Brindisa <http://www.brindisa.com> means that the quality is always stellar. 
Four o’clock in the afternoon is a great time for nabbing a seat. And then just 
staying there.

40 Maltby Street, London SE1, 020-7237 9247
Believe it or not, I love a starched linen tablecloth and Riedel glassware as 
much as the next restaurant addict. But much of the genuinely interesting 
cooking these days – especially from a younger, more impecunious bunch – comes 
from places like this corrugated iron-clad railway arch. It’s the warehouse of
Gergovie Wines <http://www.gergoviewines.com> (whose natural wines dominate the 
list), so they’ve made a virtue of necessity. The kitchen may be the size of a 
cupboard, but this is über-foodie Maltby Street, so if the food weren’t up to 
snuff, it would rapidly croak its last.It’s more than just good, and frequently 
verges on stellar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/28/40-maltby-street-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
. There’s usually a fine, rough terrine – pork and peppercorn, maybe – and 
wonderful croquettes (celeriac, say, or smoked haddock). A tart: fine pastry 
laden with smoked eel, onion and horseradish. Crayfish cocktail on toast. And 
they’re not afraid to put on a pie: pork and prune, or venison. Dishes may be 
humble – cabbage rolls with pork broth, egg mayonnaise striped with slivers of 
fierce, salty anchovy – but they’re always made with an eye towards the 
consummate pleasure of eating, possibly thanks to chef Stephen Williams’ 
background in the high-end likes ofThe Ledbury <http://www.theledbury.com>. I 
realise that a depressing number of my recommendations say the words, as 40 
Maltby Street does, “We do not take reservations”. I can only apologise.

<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/09/the-manor-london-sw4-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
.

Head chef at this cool, artistically scuffed number is Dean Parker 
<https://twitter.com/deanoparker1>, who seems to be every bit as talented as 
his mentor, teasing vegetables into extraordinary service – charred-edged 
celeriac, smoked aubergine whipped with mint, honey-smoked asparagus (they love 
a good smoking, and fermenting, and pickling) with mead and creme fraiche. I’m 
a huge fan of the likes of their barbecued chicken skins with own-made kimchi. 
The tasting menu – eight courses for £42 – is so worth doing: it’s a true 
showcase of the kitchen’s skills.

Vegetables, herbs, even honey, can come from their own rooftop garden back at 
the mothership down the road, and flavours are notably brighter and sprightlier 
as a result. They make their own sausages and charcuterie. I’d cross oceans for 
their baked Vacherin with chestnuts and doused in that honey: evidence that the 
team is happy with luxurious simplicity as well as with culinary pyrotechnics. 
Those with a sweet tooth will faint with joy at the 
build-your-own-elaborate-sundae dessert bar.

86-90 Lamb’s Conduit Street, London WC1, 020-7242 4119
Nothing about Ciao Bella suggests that it belongs on any list of restaurant 
critics’ “bests”, from the website that appears to have been designed in the 
1990s to a menu where every hoary old Italian trattoria cliche is alive and 
bellowing O Sole Mio. But this 30-year-old trouper packs ’em in night after 
night. The terrace (aka tables on the pavement) is busy no matter what the 
weather. The overwhelming impression – from the vast risottos, bready pizzas 
and dishes you thought didn’t exist any more (vitello alla pizzaiola, pollo 
alla diavola) – is one of generosity.

There’s a resident pianist bashing out Italian “classics”, and over-refreshed 
punters are forever joining in. It’s a wonderful place to come with in-laws, or 
toddlers, or anyone who enjoys the ministrations of jovial, cheesy, 
super-attentive older waiters. The last time I came here, I had lasagne and 
chips. Because I could. I once also sat betweenDavid Bailey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-bailey> on one side and that 
Darius from The X Factor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Campbell> on the 
other. It’s that kind of place: enormous, unselfconscious, old-school fun.Boris 
Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> is a fan – probably 
something to do with the startling hugeness of portions – but don’t hold that 
against it. This is not the greatest Italian restaurant in the capital, but it 
has the biggest heart. And, of course, enormous pepper mills.

Koya Bar  <http://koyabar.co.uk>

50 Frith Street, London W1
I wept hot tears when Koya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/05/koya-london-w1-restaurant-review>
 closed at the start of this summer (I know, I should get a life) when its 
visionary chefJunya Yamasaki <https://twitter.com/junyayamasaki> decided to 
head back to Japan. But Koya Bar next door is holding up remarkably well in his 
absence, and growing to be, if anything, almost every bit as good.

Udon noodles – fat, snowy-white, with the most haunting chew – are the most 
alluring things you can give to your teeth. Legend has it that they’re made the 
traditional way, by foot. (Yes, foot.) They can come in vast bowls of fragrant 
broth, or as cold, decorative nests to be unravelled and dunked in soy dips or 
hot soups. Topped with the frilliest, laciest tempura – vegetables, or prawns 
of improbable enormousness – they become a rare, opulent treat. Koya Bar’s 
breakfast bowl, heaving with marinated mushrooms, fried egg and bacon, is 
bloody gorgeous. But there’s so much more than just noodles, especially on the 
specials blackboard: pristine sashimi, whole deep-fried sole with its crunchy 
bones, curry and tempura prawn donburi. Little wonder this long, simply 
decorated room, for counter dining only, has a constant queue outside, 
something I avoid by going mid-afternoon. The freelance life has to have its 
perks, and Koya Bar is one of them.

 – not because of the unmistakeably brilliant cooking, but because of the set,

uncompromising, I huffed. Then I went back for lunch, when you can choose. And 
went back again. And again. Now that chef James Lowe has relaxed a little, it’s 
some of the most exciting cooking in the capital.

The restaurant at Brunswick House is one of those places that simply shouldn’t 
work.But it does, it really does 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/brunswick-house-cafe-london-review>
, despite its location, marooned in the middle of the ugly Vauxhaull giratory 
system, part of the Georgian mansion shared by architectural salvage 
specialists Lassco. And its decor: Steptoe’s yard crossed with the Marylebone 
pad of a camp set designer (which I love, obviously).

But scratch the surface and the pedigree starts to show: the restaurant is run 
byJackson Boxer 
<https://twitter.com/Jackson_Boxer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
, grandson of food writerArabella Boxer

, brother to Frank ofthe famous Peckham car park rooftop cafe specialising in 
Campari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/25/restaurant-review-franks-cafe-campari-bar>
; his father runsan Italian deli <http://italodeli.co.uk/> not far away. It’s 
fair to say this is one foodie family.

The food is contemporary without being outré: a lot of vegetables, treated 
sympathetically and creatively (a riot of different brassicas on pecan butter; 
fried pattypan squash with a fonduta of Coolea cheese and lovage oil); 
off-piste meat cuts (lamb’s tongue with endive, roast top flank with cabbage 
and nasturtium, spiced sweetbreads with roast corn and grilled onions).

I have fantasies of being found in a corner here, covered in cobwebs, a kind 
of mummified Miss Havisham, having expired after a particularly lavish dinner. 
Just slightly preserved by the ingestion of several of their very excellent 
cocktails.

Gymkhana <http://www.gymkhanalondon.com>

42 Albemarle Street, London W1, 020-3011 5900
By no means your neighbourhood curry house, Gymkhana is a swish, 
special-occasion restaurant – if you can score a table, that is. It shows that 
the food of the subcontinent deserves to be celebrated, not dismissed (as we 
often do in this country) as cheapo beer sponge. Here, it’s raised to a fine 
art: the freshest spices tempered and sizzled, good wine and fine meat (the 
duck dosa and muntjac biryani have become must-haves, with good reason), served 
in an atmosphere of moody, Raj-inspired luxury.

Opera Tavern <http://www.operatavern.co.uk>

23 Catherine Street, London WC2, 020-7836 3680
Asked what I’d eat for my last meal on Earth, there’s every chance it might 
have to include the Ibérico pork burger from Opera Tavern, a far more complex 
dish than its terse description suggests. It is gorgeous, as is the bustling 
restaurant (I like the more informal ground floor best); from the clued-up 
staff, brilliant wine list and fine, expertly cut hams to the more intricate 
dishes, it fires on every cylinder.

Honey & Co <http://honeyandco.co.uk>

25a Warren Street, London W1, 020-7388 6175 
Just thinking about Honey & Co makes me come over all warm and fuzzy: the 
husband-and-wife team who run it (Sarit Packer is Itamar Srulovich’s “honey”); 
the tiny, constantly packed restaurant with its shelves of jewel-coloured 
preserves and lust-inducing cakes and pastries;the cooking, vibrant with Middle 
Eastern spicing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/05/honey-and-co-restaurant-review>
, based on “the food we grew up on… our moms’ and aunties’ food… the things we 
miss from our childhood”. The sticky Fitzrovia bun, fat with pistachios and 
sour cherries, is properly life-enhancing.

Sweetings

39 Queen Victoria Street, London EC4, 020-7248 3062, no website
Born in 1889, wood-panelled fish restaurant Sweetings is supremely masculine, 
its City location dictating a testosterone-blessed clientele. But there’s also 
the menu: from the already-buttered bread, to the Dover sole and oysters, to 
its roster of stodgy, syrupy, custardy, trad-Brit puddings, it’s designed for 
the chap who loved his nanny (an impression intensified by being ministered to 
by firm, uniformed matrons). I should hate the place, but it has a curious hold 
on me: there’s nothing much like it anywhere else.

St John Bread & Wine <https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/spitalfields/>

94-96 Commercial Street, London E1, 020-7251 0848
Many would choose the seminal mothership, St John 
<https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/smithfield/>, but I like the more rackety Bread 
& Wine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jul/19/foodanddrink.shopping1> – 
it has less of a pole up its jacksie. As you’d expect, both bread and wine are 
worth travelling for (as is their celebrated breakfast bacon sandwich): wheels 
of the legendary St John sourdough stacked up by the open kitchen and a wine 
list to tickle the fussiest oenophile. Dishes are suitable for sharing, 
frequently starring creatively spiced vegetables or the perkiest fish. The only 
restaurant I know to feature elevenses. Seed cake and a glass of Madeira, 
anyone?

 Ganapati: ‘The parathas are a must-order: “a carbphile’s life goal.”’ 
Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian 
38 Holly Grove, London SE15, 020-7277 2928 
For a long time, people on Twitter just had to bellow “PARATHA!” to me to send 
me off into a lustful reverie about the flaky, buttery flatbreads at this 
unassuming little South Indian restaurant in Peckham. They are a carbphile’s 
life goal.

The small, vibrantly coloured restaurant with a vaguely urban-hippy vibe was 
an early beacon in Peckham’s burgeoning status as a destination for food-lovers;
those of us who found it raved with a kind of rabid evangelical fervour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/31/ganapati-london-se15-review>
. And it hasn’t stumbled since. Concentrating, they tell us, on the “home 
cooking and street food of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh”, 
the kitchen delivers in spades. Refreshingly, the menu changes frequently, but 
there will usually be a generous vegetarian thali, a slow-cooked meat curry – 
Keralan-style goat, perhaps, pokey with mustard seed; fish might be seabass 
fillet or swordfish with ajwain (carom) and smoked tamarind. Homemade pickles 
are outstandingly vivid, and I’m properly addicted to the crab thoran: masses 
of crabmeat, chunks of coconut, all thrumming with the fragrance of curry 
leaves.

Oddly, it’s not owned by Indians, but by a Brit, Claire Fisher. Apparently, 
she opened the restaurant after falling in love with the food of southern 
India. After a meal here (which must, must, include that paratha), you will, 
too.

of the experience as the food. The menu changes frequently, but expect 12 to 14 
courses of intricate, adventurous dishes made with flawless produce. I’m 
normally allergic to the “chef’s table” kind of lark (who knows whom you might 
end up sitting beside?), but with food this exquisite, an exception has to be 
made.

<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/20/chinese-cuisine-andrew-wong->
, who took over his family’s traditional Chinese restaurant, has achieved 
wonders here, transforming the old warhorse into something chic and 
contemporary (and not a little clattery), with a menu that startles and thrills.

It romps around China, namechecking all corners of the country. The 10-course 
Taste Of China menu assembles dumplings from Shanghai, Shaanxi’s pulled lamb 
“burgers” and Yunnan seared beef with chilli and pomegranate intoa meal that’s 
a delicious travel adventure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/27/a-wong-london-sw1-review>
. Dim sum are exquisite: evolved versions of classics – “Breakfast in Causeway 
Bay” (Wong’s version of zha leung cheung fun) features sticky rice roll, fried 
dough stick and “lava floss”; and just the thought of the pork bun, with its 
snowy frosting of sugar, can cause me to emit a small moan of longing.

The Forbidden City bar in the basement does equally extraordinary things to 
cocktails, using fragrant teas and delicate foams, and pairs them with little 
snacks huge with Asian flavours: Taiwanese popcorn chicken, jellyfish, 
sweet-and-sour ribs.

Barrafina Adelaide Street <http://www.barrafina.co.uk>

I worried that, with the opening of their latest outlet in Theatreland, the 
Hart brothers might be in danger of dimming their tapas bar treasure. I needn’t 
have: each Barrafina is a little belter. This one – larger, airier, beautiful 
in its acres of marble around a bustling central kitchen –is my favourite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/29/barrafina-london-wc2-restaurant-review>
.

The menu is genius: everything from suckling pig to alluring vegetable dishes 
(far more than you’d get in actual Spain). Further excitement comes from the 
daily specials board: mammoth, scarlet carabineros, empanadillas stuffed with 
wild rabbit, razor clams, tiny delicate tellinas (clams), pig’s trotters. If 
the crab croquetas are available, they are an essential order: gooey, crisp, 
thrumming with the rich flavour of the shellfish. The fried squid bocadillo 
with onion is this branch’s signature: these, with a glass of Palo Cortado 
sherry or some crisp, gluggable godello, make an absolute feast. If you can 
stretch toBelondrade y Lurton <http://www.belondrade.com>, you should.

I love the new breed of tapas bars (Copita <http://www.copita.co.uk> nearly 
made it on to this list, too, as didEl Gato Negro 
<http://www.elgatonegrotapas.com>), as dedicated to the quality of the 
ingredients as to the cooking. This, largely thanks to the small group’s 
brilliant chefNieves Barragán Mohacho <https://twitter.com/nievesbarragan1>, is 
the jewel in the crown.

– as then, at the wonderfulWapping Food 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/wapping-food-restaurant-review-london>
 (RIP) – he’s a real talent.

This, to me, has everything it takes to be the perfect neighbourhood restaurant
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/11/8-hoxton-square-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
: big enough to be buzzy, yet also small enough that they properly get to know 
their regulars. The wine list is inspired and accessibly priced. There’s a 
little terrace out front for people-watchers. And the daily-changing menu is a 
joy: Emirali has the Antipodean’s magpie approach, so you might find the likes 
of risotto nero, rabbit, morcilla and chickpeas, or veal chop, sprouting 
broccoli and anchovy. There are creative, unhairshirted vegetarian choices. 
There’s usually a fine steak, too.

Breakfasts are blissful: banana bread with dates, buttermilk waffles with 
bacon and maple syrup, courgette fritters with peas, fried egg and buffalo 
ricotta. And I ate one of my favourite ever puddings here: a sticky, moist 
pistachio cake topped with roast peach, curiously and beautifully scented with 
tarragon.

I also love Emirali’s 10 Greek Street <http://www.10greekstreet.com>, but this 
one is just nudging ahead in my affections due to the fact that it takes 
bookings. In Hoxton! I know.

Street Feast <http://www.streetfeastlondon.com>


I’m using this as shorthand for the extraordinary mushrooming of the 
street-food phenomenon around the UK, something to be celebrated, not only 
because it gives young entrepreneurs the chance to launch their menus without 
massive investment, but also because the best of them inevitably gravitate 
towards bricks and mortar restaurants with, you know, roofs and heating and 
licences. See also the excellentKerb <http://www.kerbfood.com/>, Altrincham

Lardo <http://www.lardo.co.uk>

197-201 Richmond Road, London E8, 020-8985 2683 
Eliza Flanagan’s baby, a hymn to everything Italian filtered through a 
distinctly Hackney lens, continues to delight. Colonising the ground floor of 
the handsome, vast-windowed Arthaus building, it’s a looker in a 
rough-and-ready way, softened by colourful cushions and a bobby dazzler of a 
pizza oven – less utilitarian kitchen equipment and more glitterball.

It’s used to sterling effect on the pizzas and focaccia, but there’s way more 
to the menu: fine pastas – you might find pappardelle with wild boar and 
guanciale, or casarecce with burrata, squash, walnuts and sage –and clever, 
thoughtful, vegetable-only dishes. The oven belches out great meat, too: 
just-charred pork chop with endive and wood-roasted potatoes, say, or duck 
breast with spinach and wild berries.

The home-cured salumi are to be treasured, using free-range mangalitsa porkers 
for the likes of ripe, purple coppa, smoky speck or fennel pollen salami. And 
the arancini, stuffed with still al dente rice and, perhaps, fiery ’nduja, are 
among the nicest fried things you’ll ever shove down your neck. And those 
pizzas – airy and elastic of crust, with deliciously blistered bases – come 
with intriguing toppings: black anise pepperoni; zucchini and anchovy; 
pancetta, provolone and peppers. There’s a terrific brunch, too. Lardo is the 
kind of place I really wish I lived next door to.

Russell Norman’s mini empire of hugely influential restaurants is mostly 
composed of his sorta-VenetianPolpos <http://www.polpo.co.uk/>. But of all of 
them, it is the grungey little Brooklyn-flavoured Spuntino in the still-seamy 
part of Soho that I like best: here it’s permanently dusk, the drinks are 
hardcore, the soundtrack eccentric, the sliders and pizzette addictive, and the 
macaroni cheese the gooiest and cheesiest in town.

nudging right up to The O2 (aka The Dome) will be truly rewarding. A gem in an

 Roti King: ‘Comfort food par excellence.’ Photograph: Sophia Evans for the 
Guardian 
40 Doric Way, London NW1 
I’m calling it: the roti canai with dhal at Roti King in Euston is the best 
four quid you’ll spend on food in the UK. You might get bigger food for the 
money, or dirrrtier or a, er, nice kebab, but this £4 buys you a bowl of richly 
fragrant, spiced pulses with magical depth of flavour and two Malaysian-style 
flatbreads. Sure, these are cheap ingredients, but the Roti King, aka 
“prata-man” (breadmaker) Kalpana Sugendran Sugendran,turns them into things of 
truly transcendent loveliness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/25/roti-king-london-restaurant-review>
. Which is just as well, since his little restaurant is, kindly, no beauty.

Sugendran makes the roti in front of you, flipping and stretching the elastic 
dough in an almost balletic dance until it’s as transparent as chiffon. When 
your hot breads arrive, their crisp surfaces and squidgy folds make a bread 
that is one of the capital’s most gorgeous things to sink your teeth into; when 
a torn-off chunk is dunked through the dhal, we’re talking ambrosial.

The other dishes are worth checking out, too: a vast cauldron of coconutty 
laksa, brimming with noodles, mussels and squid; mutton curry, potent and 
sombre. But it’s the roti I come for, most recently a solitary visit, all the 
better to contemplate their glory uninterrupted. Comfort food par excellence.

 Birch: ‘Apparent simplicity disguises painstaking attention to detail.’ 
47 Raleigh Road, Southville, Bristol BS3 
“We are one half restaurant, one half garden,” says the website for lovely 
little Birch, in foodie Mecca Bristol’s Southville. In addition to the 
restaurant, owners chef Sam Leach and FOH partner Beccy Massey have a patch of 
land – “around 10 full-size allotments” – where they grow the produce that ends 
up on the plate in front of you.

The menu changes, it seems, on the turn of a minute hand – it depends on 
what’s in season and what’s good: turbot, perhaps, with cider butter and summer 
vegetables, kid meat “scrumpets” with hot mustard. Gleeful use is made of 
just-picked herbs and leaves on one hand, and the likes of ox heart or hogget 
on the other. Ice-creams might be brown bread or wortleberry. This is one of 
these restaurants where apparent simplicity disguises painstaking attention to 
detail: gorgeous bread and desserts, a smart, affordable wine list (the owners’ 
background in the estimable likes ofSt John <https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com> and
the Quality Chop House <http://thequalitychophouse.com> shines through).

The first time I visited 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/birch-bristol-restaurant-review>
, I said, “I’d give my eye teeth to have this as my local.” My jealousy of its 
neighbours has not lessened. Leach and Massey built Birch almost from scratch – 
this is the classic labour of love.

1 Upper James Street, London W1, 020-3145 1000
We all needs a good dose of decadence every now and then. And when I’m in the 
mood, this eccentric glamourpuss is the only destination. It’s fair to say that 
when BBR opened, there was a giant chorus of WTF. CriticAA Gill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/aa-gill> gave it an unprecedented no stars, 
calling it “Gloriously Chronically Unfixably Misbegotten”. Me, I loved it: 
everything from the David Collins interior that looked like a luxury steampunk 
railway carriage lined in bookbinding paper to the Farley’s rusk on the menu.

Over the years, its bonkersness has been toned down – the staff no longer have 
to wear salmon-pink waistcoats or lurex-threaded tweed, sadly; the rusks are no 
more – but it’s still a restaurant like no other. The menu is vaguely Russian, 
with endless varieties of vodka, caviar, potato and mushroom vareniki, even 
chicken Kiev. But there are British classics, too: an outrageously handsome 
beef wellington, pies of burnished beauty, a pungentStinking Bishop 
<http://www.teddingtoncheese.co.uk/acatalog/de339.htm> soufflé. It doesn’t make 
a lot of sense, but I don’t need it to. And apart from these marble-lined 
riches, anywhere that has a button at every table saying “press for champagne” 
(“crapulently pointless”: AA Gill) is OK by me.

 The Clove Club: ‘His food thrills even when he does fried chicken.’ 
Shoreditch Town Hall, 380 Old Street, London EC1, 020-7729 6496
As you enter what was Shoreditch Town Hall, there’s a cold room that looks – 
depending on which side of the foodie divide you stand – like either an 
axe-murderer’s playroom or sheerest heaven. It’s the building’s former box 
office, where chef Isaac McHale and his team age homemade rare-breed 
charcuterie (red wine-cured old spot ventreche, mangalitsa lardo), to be 
enjoyed in the austerely handsome bar with freshly baked sourdough. McHale 
paints pictures on the plates with ingredients such as albacore tuna, red 
pepper and sage; or suckling pig with south Indian spices. Buthis food thrills 
even when he does fried chicken 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review>
: nuggets of the buttermilk-brined bird served with pine salt (exactly what it 
sounds like) on a nest of pine needles. My only criticism: I always want about 
three times as much of it. There’s a sophisticated vegetarian menu, too.

The last time I ate at the Clove, I had the finest, most fragile cheese 
tartlets with wild duck and ginger consommé swirled through a decanter of 
100-year-old Boal Madeira. No exaggeration, it was celestial.The Clove made 
waves this year by being the first restaurant here to adopt the Tock system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/08/would-you-pre-pay-dinner-restaurant-tock-ticketing-system>
 (you pay for a meal “ticket” in advance). Controversial, but in an age of 
tight margins and the rudeness of no-shows, I’d say fair enough.

When Jacob Kenedy <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-kenedy> opened 
Bocca di Lupo back in 2009, it was an instant smash. The beauty of a British 
chef paying homage to Italy is the lack of chauvinism: specialities from 
Liguria nudge famous dishes from Lombardy, Piedmont, Puglia… the whole gamut, 
across the 20 regions of Italy.

Pastas are stellar: the fluffiest, cloud-like gnocchi; handmade orecchiette 
sauced with spicy ’nduja sausage; spaghetti to which you can choose to add 
humble mussels or luxurious lobster. But the rest of the menu – roasts of 
suckling pig, game when in season, exciting salads – amply rewards exploration. 
They make their own excellent bread and ice-creams (a trip to their gelateria
Gelupo <http://www.gelupo.com> over the road is a great way to end lunch), even 
salami and glorious, fat sausages. The all-Italian wine list is a corker. too.

“We are a family business, a humble trattoria… at heart,” the website says. 
That “at heart” is significant, because it’s far from humble, one of London’s 
most glamorous restaurants: the buzzing open kitchen and marble dining counter; 
dramatic chandeliers; moody oil paintings of food by Kenedy’s mother, artist
Haidee Becker <http://www.haideebecker.com/haidee_becker.php>. Add the buzz 
from a local crowd of theatre producers, West End stars, flaneurs and foodies 
thrilled to score a reservation, and you have a gem of a joint.

Of every restaurant the length of the country, this is the one you’ll find me 
in most often 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/04/goods-shed-canterbury-restaurant-review>
: a halfway stop-off between the capital and My Seaside, the restaurant itself 
handily positioned a 20-second stomp from the station (well, it is a goods 
shed, after all).

In the long, narrow restaurant perched above the farmer’s market, with its 
brick and soaring windows, chef Rafael Lopez brings his Spanish sensibilities 
to play on the glorious bounty of Kent. Looking out over the banks of 
vegetables and fruit, local cheese, bread baked in-house, it’s easy to see why 
the county’s called the Garden of England. Lopez gets his ingredients from the 
market, so, depending on the season, his short menu might feature crown prince 
squash, roast beets, wilted, vivid chard. There are nearly always roast 
potatoes, fondant in texture with treacly edges. His treatment of fish is 
glorious: Spain’s beloved hake, perhaps, with a bouillabaisse-rich sauce and 
mussels; or scallops with chorizo and tiny, fleshy beans, all served on 
decorative vintage plates. The drinks list stars all sorts of recherché and 
well-priced lovelies, plus local beer and wine. I’ve never once left hungry or 
disappointed. (And these days I go for a pre-lunch sharpener cocktail to the 
Shed’s new little outfit,Wild Goose <http://www.wildgoosefood.com/> – usually 
something potent with a caramelised chilli on top.) This isn’t ground-breaking, 
or cool, or edgy – it’s just the restaurant equivalent of a hug.

I find myself here time and time again – I’m evangelical about the place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/02/quality-chop-house-london-restaurant-review>
. I drag people in, forcing them to eat Galloway beef mince on dripping toast, 
wonderful game served with preternaturally light, luxurious liver parfait, 
thrilling to the inevitable actual moans of pleasure.

Chef Shaun Searley innovates without ever losing sight of deliciousness (or an 
innate sense of Britishness). So you might be lucky enough to encounter his 
croquettes made from kid meat, oozing with Tymsboro cheese. (See? Goat on goat: 
so clever, so good.) There are homemade terrines and roasts, Neal’s Yard 
cheese, excellent charcuterie. The cult dish is Searley’s confit potatoes, a 
fried item of evil deliciousness. The wine list is among London’s best; 
unsurprising, because co-owner Will Lander is the son ofwine maven Jancis 
Robinson <http://www.jancisrobinson.com>.

My tip: book in the bar. The restaurant, with its magnificent, original 
“working men’s restaurant” wooden booths and tiled floor, should be on the 
must-see list of anyone interested in restaurants and their history (it’s been 
around since 1869), but those booths are resistant to the modern person’s 
posterior; the bar has more accommodating bentwood seating and exactly the same 
menu. Their butcher’s and deli next door sells sausage rolls by the inch. How 
can you not love that?

Chef Andy Oliver’s tribute to Thailand was hot stuff, a ramshackle set-up in 
the archway owned by the Climpson’s coffee roastery, home tosome of the finest 
Thai food you’ll get outside Thailand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/10/som-saa-london-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
(and inside, too). The menu is exhilarating: sea bass deep-fried before being 
blanketed by a perfume factory’s-worth of aromatics; jan naem (fermented pork 
sausage vibrant with Thai herbs and grilled into stickiness) is a strong 
contender for my Death Row meal. It’s a bit of a cheat to include Som Saa in 
this list, because it’s not currently open; but they’re about to launch a 
crowdfunded permanent site, and I love it, so it has to be here.

Even if it served up curling ham sarnies, the Ethicurean would be worth a 
visit: it’s set in the enchanting Barley Wood Walled Garden, a perfectly 
restored Victorian kitchen garden, bursting with fertile life. But far from 
your usual garden cafe fare, gardener Mark Cox sends his produce to the 
restaurant in the delightfully scuffed former glasshouse to be made by the team 
(chef siblings Matthew and Iain Pennington, Paula Zarate andJack Adair Bevan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jack-adair-bevan>) into some of the most 
delicious, innovative, vegetable-focused cuisine in the land.

The restaurant, they say, is “founded on a sense of place”, and that place is 
just beautiful. There’s a sense of history, too: they celebrate solstices and 
wassails and ancient British ingredients. But there’s utter modernity 
alongside: items on the daily-changing menu might include 12-hour pork belly, 
glazed carrots and anise, kimchi and kohlrabi, or whole, salt-baked celeriac. 
Their squidgy toffee apple cake served with cinnamon cream is one of the finest 
desserts I’ve ever rammed into my face.

They make an alluring range of tinctures and cordials, among them their own 
vermouth <http://www.thecollectorvermouth.com>, made from English wine and 
herbs from the garden. As the name suggests, there’s a commitment to organic 
tenets, fair trade, the Rainforest Alliance. It could all be a bit hairshirted 
and worthy, but it so isn’t:every visit feels like a celebration

 The Sportsman: ‘The homemade bread is my favourite anywhere on the planet.’

I’ve been going to the Sportsman for years, before any of the current brigade 
of gushing fanboys had ever heard of it, before the Michelin recognition – 
astonishing for what has always been, as they describe themselves, a “grotty 
rundown pub by the sea”. (It’s not really like that: spartan, yes, but 
comfortable and welcoming.) I followed the oysters to Whitstable: it turned out 
to be the gateway drug to what is now a genuine addiction to Stephen Harris’s 
remarkable cooking. But I’ve never written about it.

Until now – and I’ve got only a measly 200-odd words to tell you about the 
beauty of everything Harris puts before you, from the glistening local oysters 
topped with tiny touches of homemade charcuterie that pick up their blissful 
salinity, to the ice-pops dunked in “cake milk” and the fragile, delicate 
tartlets that end the meal. About the homemade bread, my favourite anywhere on 
the planet: especially the magnificent treacly sodabread, with home-churned 
butter, salted from the sea just outside the door. The white fish in rich vin 
jaune, the crisp lamb breast with vibrant, vinegary mint. And the unmissable 
slip sole, delicately meaty in its bath of seaweed butter.

Harris is self-taught, a fervent believer in locality – fortunately Kent is 
blessed with produce – and the ultimate enthusiast. On the rare occasions he’s 
not in his kitchen, he’ll be in the world’s great restaurants, absorbing and 
learning. Gun to head, if you forced me to say which was my favourite of all 
these restaurants, it’s undoubtedly this one.
