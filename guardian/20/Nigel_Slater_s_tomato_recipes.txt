It is now, as the summer dips into autumn, that tomatoes are at their best. 
They are the last few hauls of home-grown fruit before the plants wither to a 
crisp and head off to the compost. A bit of a mixed bag to be honest, but I 
like that. The chance to match up the tiny Sungold, Green Zebra and those fat 
yellow fruits with their flash of carmine. The opportunity to marry the sharp 
with the oversweet, the pear with the cherry, the green with those on the verge 
of collapse. All comers are welcome.

I threw odds and sods from the trays at the greengrocer’s at a vegetable stew 
last week, spicing the rust-coloured slush with chilli, turmeric and garlic, 
then stirring in a spoonful of sticky tamarind paste to give a lift to the 
pervading late-summer sweetness. I griddled courgettes, currently cheap as 
chips, and added them at the last minute so they kept some texture. We passed 
the big bowl along the table, a last meal in the dying sun, everyone dipping 
into rice studded with cloves and cumin seeds, then spooning over the spiced 
tomato stew.

A pinch of sugar will sort out any late fruits that let you down

I like the way bread soaks up the tomato’s juices, be it in an Italian pappa 
al pomodoro, the soft-textured soup-salad; a Provençal pan bagnat (more 
tomatoes than tuna for me, please) or a simple breakfast of grilled tomatoes on 
white toast, the edges of the bread smoked from the grill, then soaked with 
tart juice. I made a plate of sandwiches this week, too, making first a basil, 
olive oil and garlic paste to use in lieu of butter. Better, I think, was the 
one I made later using coriander, chillies and yogurt – a sort of fresh chutney 
really.

A pinch of sugar will sort out any end-of-season fruits that let you down. Add 
it with the salt and black pepper. Even the meanest shake of caster will do 
more than you might imagine. I like to bake a dish of halved fruits of all 
shapes and sizes, their surfaces spread with a loose dressing of garlic, olive 
oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar and a fistful of mixed 
fresh herbs. The trick is to make the paste runny enough to baste the tomatoes 
as they roast, and have something under them to mop up the juices – a raft of 
toast or flatbread, or a slice of focaccia. It’s the tomato’s final fling.

A curry, of sorts. The turmeric adds its characteristic earthy note, the 
tamarind paste a welcome, mellow sourness. There is heat, too, from the 
chillies and mustard seeds, but the overall effect is light, bright and 
sweet-sharp. Rice – steamed with a chopped shallot, a few cloves, a bay leaf or 
two and its snow-white depths freckled with cumin seeds – is a given.

Serves 4
groundnut oil 2 tbsp
cumin seeds 1 tsp
yellow mustard seeds 1 tsp
onion 1, medium
hot green chilli 1, small 
cherry tomatoes 700g
tamarind paste ½ tsp
ground turmeric 1 tsp
chilli powder ½ tsp
courgettes 6, medium
steamed rice to serve

Warm the groundnut oil in a shallow pan, then add the cumin and mustard seeds 
and cook for a minute or two till fragrant. Peel and finely chop the onion then 
add it to the spices, together with the finely chopped green chilli. Stirring 
regularly, let the onion cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until translucent.

Simmer until the tomatoes have collapsed into a rough, scarlet sauce

Halve the tomatoes and drop them into a bowl, then combine with the tamarind 
paste, ground turmeric and chilli powder, mashing it all together with a wooden 
spoon. When the onion has softened but before it starts to change colour, stir 
in the tomatoes and a little salt, partially cover with a lid and simmer for 
about 20 minutes until the tomatoes have collapsed into a rough, scarlet sauce.

Slice the courgettes into short lengths, about 4 or 5 to each fruit, then cook 
on a griddle until lightly browned on the outside. (Alternatively you can fry 
them in a shallow pan with a little olive oil.) Transfer the browned courgettes 
to the spiced tomato and simmer for a further 10 minutes until each piece is 
fully tender.

Serve with the steamed rice.

Tomato sandwich with coriander paste

I often use cucumber or a cool salad leaf as well as the tomato. Avoid rocket 
and watercress which add too much heat, and go instead for cooling leaves, such 
as little gem, iceberg or butterhead lettuce.

Makes 2 large sandwiches.

For the sandwiches:
sourdough, white or rye bread 4 slices
tomatoes 250g, assorted sizes
coriander paste see below

For the paste:
coriander 70g
lime juice 2 tbsp
sugar ½ to 1 tsp
green chillies 1-2, small 
ginger a 70g piece
natural yogurt 6-7 tbsp

Remove the leaves from the coriander. Put the lime juice, sugar, chilli (one 
or both, depending on your heat threshold), ginger (peeled and roughly sliced) 
and the yogurt into the jug of a blender and process to a coarse paste. Add the 
coriander leaves and a little salt and process further. The paste should be 
pungent, slightly citrus, sour and hot. Add sugar, yogurt or more lime juice to 
taste.

Slice the tomatoes thinly. Spread each piece of bread generously with some of 
the coriander paste, then place the tomato slices on top. Place a piece of the 
spread bread on top and press down lightly. Store any leftover paste, covered, 
in the fridge.
