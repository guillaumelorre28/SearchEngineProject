Eleanor on Jonathan

What were you hoping for?
Good conversation and that elusive spark.

First impressions?
On time, friendly, nervous and not my type physically.

What did you talk about?
Long-distance hiking, the threat from Russia, why we should quit our jobs and 
become carpenters.

Any awkward moments?
I went for cheek kisses when we met; he went for a hug.

Good table manners?
We shared everything and made a bit of a mess.

Best thing about Jonathan?
His openness. We didn’t bother with small talk.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Perhaps.

Describe him in three words
Talkative, sincere, determined.

What do you think he made of you?
Hopefully that I was good company. We didn’t have a lot of shared experiences 
but that made for interesting conversation.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, it was late and we’d already had cups of straight vodka Uzbek-style.

And... did you kiss?
We did not.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
Chemistry – but that’s just luck.

Marks out of 10?
8.

months.
