Macarons. Simple, right?

 <https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000909> 
They did say macaroons were difficult... 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000909>

Spent about an hour whisking egg whites with a fork to no avail... Got bored, 
moved on and hoped for the best... Tasted alright though!

<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5001078>

My Mum made this but ran out of green food colouring hence psychedelic peas...

And finally ... this beautiful creation

 <https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5001477> 
When mermaids go bad... 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5001477>

Made this for my daughter's 8th birthday. Looked fine until I left it 
overnight - poor old thing crackled all over, so that she looked like an 85 
year old in a bikini top.
