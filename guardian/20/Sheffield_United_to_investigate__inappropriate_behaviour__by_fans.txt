Bradford’s travelling fans reported racist chanting from a small minority of 
United supporters, while the home striker Billy Sharp claimed he had coins 
thrown at him from the away end.

“The club has received complaints about both sets of fans from the fixture – 
including a number of contradictory reports,” read a club statement. “The 
Blades will take every step to track down and deal with those responsible for 
any inappropriate actions, which ruin the matchday experience for other 
supporters.

“Sheffield United is an inclusive family and community orientated club where 
everyone is made to feel welcome and it endeavours to improve on this principle 
year on year.”

United have taken steps to identify any offenders in response to comments made 
by the Bradford chairman, Mark Lawn, after the match.He told the Telegraph & 
Argus 
<http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/14171413.Lawn_criticises__racist_chants__during_Bradford_City_defeat/>
: “I thought we had gone beyond that stage in football. I’d hoped stuff like 
that and monkey chants were a thing of the past.

“I feel very sorry for the Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> board because they must 
be embarrassed by the morons who do that. Unfortunately it’s difficult to stop 
something like that. We’d look on cameras and if we could prove they are doing 
it, then ban them from the ground.”

Sharp later made light of the alleged coin-throwing incident when he said on 
Twitter: “CheersBradford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford> for 
the coins.”
