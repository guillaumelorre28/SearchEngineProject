His departure leaves Rotherham, who are 11 points from safety in the 
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> and set for a 
return to League One, looking for a third manager of the season and a sixth in 
14 months.

A club statement read: 
<http://www.themillers.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/rotherham-united-kenny-jackett-3442350.aspx>
 “Following the game against Leeds United at the weekend, Kenny Jackett 
tendered his resignation and accordingly, his employment with the club has 
terminated with immediate effect.

“Kenny’s resignation came as a shock to the club and is disappointing. The 
club will now focus on making appropriate arrangements for the first team.”

Jackett, who left Wolves in July after three seasons at Molineux, had signed a 
three-year contract. He is the shortest-serving permanent manager in 
Rotherham’s history, taking the record from the man he replaced.

The fitness coach Paul Warne will take over for an interim period, starting at 
Burton on Saturday.
