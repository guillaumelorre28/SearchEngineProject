Barcelona <https://www.whoscored.com/Teams/65> v Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.whoscored.com/Teams/63>


Looking to bounce back from their disappointment in el clásico at the weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
, favourites Barcelona host Real Madrid’s city rivals Atlético in the 
quarter-finals. Diego Simeone’s side are capable of frustrating the holders 
over two legs but, despite the spectacular feats they have achieved in breaking 
up the duopoly of La Liga, Atlético still have a poor recent record in this 
fixture.

Barcelona have won the last six meeting between the teams. However, Atlético – 
who last beat Barcelona at this stage of theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> in 2014 – have a 
sensational defensive record this season. They have conceded just three goals 
in the competition, though their struggles in front of goal will be a concern. 
Having played out two uninspiring goalless draws with PSV Eindhoven in the 
round of 16, they are now without a goal in 245 minutes of action in Europe.

The key man for the visitors may well be vice-captain Diego Godín, who has 
been passed fit after missing the 5-1 win over Real Betis at the weekend. He is 
Atlético’s highest rated player in the Champions League (7.69) and ranks second 
for interceptions (20) of players still in the tournament. Godín will trying to 
keep out his fellow Uruguayan Luis Suárez and Lionel Messi, who have scored 
more goals in the tournament (six each) than the entire Atlético squad (11).

In what is a rare meeting between Bayern Munich and Benfica, the Bundesliga 
champions are aiming to qualify for the Champions League semi-finals for the 
fifth successive year. The clubs face off for the first time in 20 years, 
having met in just three previous European ties: the Uefa Cup in 1996 and the 
European Cup in 1976 and 1982. Bayern went on reach the finals in those three 
season, which is something they have failed to do under Pep Guardiola, who will 
be desperate to win the competition before he leaves forManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>.

While the hosts will be resounding favourites on Tuesday and to progress to 
the final four,Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are not 
to be underestimated. They have won 19 of their last 20 matches in all 
competitions, with their only defeat in that run coming at the hands of rivals 
Porto, who Bayern dumped out of the Champions League at this stage last year 
courtesy of a thumping 6-1 win at the Allianz.

While a similar scoreline seems unlikely this week, Benfica have kept just one 
clean sheet in their last 10 Champions League matches away from home. The 
visitors will need to pose a threat of their own then, and while forward Jonas 
has been their main man in front of goal this season, Nicolás Gaitán has been 
the star of the show in Europe. Four goals and three assists mean the 
Argentinian is among the top 10 rated players in the tournament (7.95), though 
his score is below that of Thiago Alcântara (8.43) and Kingsley Coman (8.31) 
for the hosts, with the latter registering five assists from just 327 minutes 
of action.

The two wannabe superpowers of European football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/05/manchester-city-psg-champions-league-football-finance>
 go head-to-head on Wednesday, though it’s fair to say Paris Saint-Germain are 
in front of Manchester City in their bid to be considered among Europe’s elite. 
TheFrench club have already won their domestic title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/13/psg-troyes-9-0-ligue-1-title> 
at a canter and progressed to their fourth consecutive Champions League 
quarter-final at the expense of English opposition in the form of Chelsea, 
while City have reached the last eight for the first time.

Manuel Pellegrini’s side have underwhelmed this season and come into the game 
against PSG as underdogs, without injured captain Vincent Kompany. That said, 
they have conceded just once in their last five matches andthe return of Kevin 
De Bruyne at the weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report>
 sparked an immediate improvement in their attacking fluidity. The Belgian has 
been a real hit in the Premier League but he has disappointed in Europe, 
earning the lowest rating of any City player to make more than three starts 
(6.71).

PSG can focus all of their attention on the Champions League and will be 
favourites to reach the semi-finals for only the second time. They have 
conceded just three goals in this season’s tournament and only once at the Parc 
des Princes, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in sensational form, having scored a 
hat-trick to take his league tally to 30 at the weekend.

Real Madrid come into their tie with Wolfsburg as massive favourites with 
spirits high following their victory over Barcelona on Saturday that may mean
little to La Liga’s final standings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/04/real-madrid-win-barcelona-changes-things-la-liga-sid-lowe>
 but much to the morale of Zinedine Zidane’s players. They will need to guard 
against complacency and, while they came through a double header with Roma with 
a comfortable 4-0 aggregate scoreline, the tie was far from plain sailing, with 
the Italians missing numerous chances in both legs.

Does Wayne Rooney deserve a place in the England team at Euro 2016?

Dieter Hecking will know his side need to pose a threat of their own but be 
far more prolific in front of goal than Roma were in the round of 16. That 
said, Wolfsburg have disappointed this season after a fantastic campaign last 
time around to sit eighth following a heavy defeat to Bayer Leverkusen at the 
weekend. They will need a strong win at home to harbour any hopes of what would 
be a huge upset to progress given their horrendous away record this season. 
Only Frankfurt have picked up fewer points on the road in the Bundesliga (10), 
but Wolfsburg’s only defeats at home in all competitions this season have come 
againstBayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> and 
Borussia Dortmund.

Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> had been 
unconvincing on their travels under Zidane before their victory at the weekend 
but a win at the Camp Nou will have restored confidence, with Cristiano Ronaldo 
again the match winner. Ronaldo has 13 goals to his name in the Champions 
League this season – the same tally as Wolfsburg – and he has scored in each of 
his last four appearances in the tournament. He will be desperate to break his 
own record of 17 goals in any season of the competition, while Keylor Navas is 
yet concede a goal in the tournament, and is 133 minutes away from breaking 
Jens Lehmann’s record for of not being beaten in the Champions League.
