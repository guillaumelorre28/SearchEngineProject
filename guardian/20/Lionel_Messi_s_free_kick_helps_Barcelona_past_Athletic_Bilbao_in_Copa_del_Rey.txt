 and advance 4-3 on aggregate.

Luis Suárez’s scissor-kick had put Barça ahead on the night in the 35th minute 
while Brazil international Neymar earned and converted a penalty three minutes 
into the second half to score his first goal since October and put the home 
side in front in the tie.

Bilbao responded immediately, substitute defender Gorka Elustondo crossing for 
Barcelona-born Enric Saborit to firmly head home in the 51st minute. The goal 
emboldened the visitors for a 10-minute spell, with the tie heading towards 
extra time, but Barça withstood the pressure.

Messi had squandered two free-kicks in the first half but then steppted up to 
curl the ball in low off the post, his third decisive dead-ball goal in his 
side’s last three matches.
