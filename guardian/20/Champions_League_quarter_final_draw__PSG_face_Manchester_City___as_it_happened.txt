Well, some intriguing ties there. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> v Atlético stands out for me. 
Atlético have been beaten twice by Barça in La Liga this season but they just 
have an incredible way of frustrating teams in Europe. It might not be pretty 
but it will test the creative and swashbuckling power of Barcelona’s MSN more 
than any other tie.

As for Manchester City, well, they may benefit from PSG having already won 
Ligue 1. Bayern have had a habit of switching off once their domestic season 
has been wrapped up. Will PSG do the same? Man City will certainly hope so. 
Laurent Blanc’s challenge will be to keep the intensity levels up until three 
weeks’ time.

Some pedantry: “If Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
play Madrid and both matches are drawn, they will both remain undefeated,” says 
Pablo Miguez. Well, I suppose so Pablo but whoever loses on penalties won’t 
feel like they’ve kept their unbeaten record. Ah, there wouldn’t necessarily be 
penalties would there? Anyway, someone would have to lose.

Oh hang on, it’s Giorgio Marchetti doing the draw. He looks like a little 
Claudio Ranieri. Pedro was just there to glam it up a bit with his dashing good 
looks and booming voice. Giorgio will be assisted by Gianluca Zambrotta of Juve,
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Milan fame. He 
wasn’t bad was he? He’ll be trusted to pluck the balls out without dropping 
them.

With Champions League tombola-overlord Gianni Infantino installed as Fifa 
head-honcho these days, I’m guessing ball-plucking duties will remain with 
Michael Heselschwerdt, who oversaw the Europa League last-16 draw capably 
enough and even supplied us with the Liverpool v Man Utd tie. Hopefully he’ll 
deliver again today. I do miss Gianni, though. Oh, hang on, It’s Pedro Pinto on 
presenting duty. I’ve been on the Football Weekly podcastwith Pedro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/apr/12/football-weekly-very-extra-europa-league-video>
. Maybe I could present the semi-final draw. or Barry Glendenning. Or maybe 
not. Anyway, poor Michael, dropped for the big occasion.

Here are the Champions league 2015-16 season records of the teams left: 

Real Madrid: W7 D1 L0 F23 A3
PSG: W6 D1 L1 F16 A3
Manchester City: W5 D1 L2 F15 A9
Wolfsburg: W6 D0 L2 F10 A5
Benfica: W5 D1 L2 F13 A9
Bayern: W6 D1 L1 F25 A7
Barcelona: W6 D2 L0 F20 A5
Atlético Madrid: W4 D3 L1 F11 A3

So Barça and Real are the only teams who haven’t lost. A clásico would damage 
at least one of those undefeated records.

Luis Enrique has been busy blowing the Barça trumpet before the draw: “The 
only team I wouldn’t want to draw is Barça and we can’t get them,” honked the 
Barça manager.

Hello. So 16 becomes eight – and it’s quite an interesting eight too. You have 
the usual suspects in Bayern, Barça, Real Madrid andAtlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid>, the ever-more fearsome 
force of PSG, the in-form Portuguese league-leaders, Benfica (14 wins in their 
last 15 games), demob happy Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City … and 
Wolfsburg, who are defying the odds somewhat given that their league form is 
poor. Of the eight, four of them are reigning league champions, Barça, Benfica, 
PSG and Bayern.

This time last year, PSG drew Barcelona and Real and Atlético were also drawn 
together. Pep could travel back to the past if Bayern are drawn against 
Barcelona, or into the future if they face a trip toManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> at the Etihad.

The team I’d hate to face most (if I managed an elite European football club, 
that is), other thanBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
for obvious reasons, is Atlético. They just don’t concede goals. A very handy 
tactic in Europe.

There are no seedings for the last eight-draw and no country restrictions 
either. The teams drawn first will play the first leg of their ties at home.

The first legs will be played on 5-6 April, with the second legs played on 
12-13 April.

Right, here’s our take on the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> draw.

Well, some intriguing ties there. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> v Atlético stands out for me. 
Atlético have been beaten twice by Barça in La Liga this season but they just 
have an incredible way of frustrating teams in Europe. It might not be pretty 
but it will test the creative and swashbuckling power of Barcelona’s MSN more 
than any other tie.

As for Manchester City, well, they may benefit from PSG having already won 
Ligue 1. Bayern have had a habit of switching off once their domestic season 
has been wrapped up. Will PSG do the same? Man City will certainly hope so. 
Laurent Blanc’s challenge will be to keep the intensity levels up until three 
weeks’ time.

Wolfsburg v Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>

Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> v Benfica

Barcelona v Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid>

PSG v Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>

The first legs will be played on 5-6 April, with the second legs played on 
12-13 April.
 
And, of course, it’s PSG v Manchester City. Ibrahimovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/13/zlatan-ibrahimovic-paris-st-germain>
 and co make their way back over to England. They like it here.
 
It’s Barcelona v Atlético Madrid. It’s attack versus defence. Oof!

Next up: Bayern Munich v Benfica. So no reunions and no Etihad trip for Pep. 
 
It’s Wolfsburg v Real Madrid first out of the pot! Zidane will be happy with 
that.
 
Here we go …
 
Some pedantry: “If Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
play Madrid and both matches are drawn, they will both remain undefeated,” says 
Pablo Miguez. Well, I suppose so Pablo but whoever loses on penalties won’t 
feel like they’ve kept their unbeaten record. Ah, there wouldn’t necessarily be 
penalties would there? Anyway, someone would have to lose.
 
Oh hang on, it’s Giorgio Marchetti doing the draw. He looks like a little 
Claudio Ranieri. Pedro was just there to glam it up a bit with his dashing good 
looks and booming voice. Giorgio will be assisted by Gianluca Zambrotta of Juve,
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Milan fame. He 
wasn’t bad was he? He’ll be trusted to pluck the balls out without dropping 
them.
 
With Champions League tombola-overlord Gianni Infantino installed as Fifa 
head-honcho these days, I’m guessing ball-plucking duties will remain with 
Michael Heselschwerdt, who oversaw the Europa League last-16 draw capably 
enough and even supplied us with the Liverpool v Man Utd tie. Hopefully he’ll 
deliver again today. I do miss Gianni, though. Oh, hang on, It’s Pedro Pinto on 
presenting duty. I’ve been on the Football Weekly podcastwith Pedro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/apr/12/football-weekly-very-extra-europa-league-video>
. Maybe I could present the semi-final draw. or Barry Glendenning. Or maybe 
not. Anyway, poor Michael, dropped for the big occasion.
 
Here are the Champions league 2015-16 season records of the teams left: 

Real Madrid: W7 D1 L0 F23 A3
PSG: W6 D1 L1 F16 A3
Manchester City: W5 D1 L2 F15 A9
Wolfsburg: W6 D0 L2 F10 A5
Benfica: W5 D1 L2 F13 A9
Bayern: W6 D1 L1 F25 A7
Barcelona: W6 D2 L0 F20 A5
Atlético Madrid: W4 D3 L1 F11 A3

So Barça and Real are the only teams who haven’t lost. A clásico would damage 
at least one of those undefeated records.
 
Luis Enrique has been busy blowing the Barça trumpet before the draw: “The 
only team I wouldn’t want to draw is Barça and we can’t get them,” honked the 
Barça manager.
 
Hello. So 16 becomes eight – and it’s quite an interesting eight too. You have
