Gary Neville <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville> felt the 
anger of the Mestalla crowd after Valencia were beaten 2-0 by Celta Vigo on 
Sunday, conceding two goals in the last 10 minutes for a third successive 
defeat in La Liga which left them six points above the relegation zone.

The former Manchester City striker John Guidetti scored Celta’s first in the 
80th minute and their captain Hugo Mallo added the second soon afterwards, the 
home fans responding with chants of “Neville go now”.

Celta’s victory took them above Athletic Bilbao, who lost 2-1 at Espanyol, 
into the top six to boost their chances of European football next season.

Valencia, who were eliminated from the Europa League by Athletic Bilbao on 
away goals last Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/17/valencia-athletic-bilbao-europa-league-gary-neville>
, were fortunate to make it to half-time without conceding a goal after Celta 
created a series of excellent chances.

Valencia’s goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, had to scramble the ball off the line after 
the defender Shkrodan Mustafi deflected a cross off the near post and the 
Australia international had to make further saves from Guidetti and Daniel Wass.

Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> improved in the 
second half but fell behind when Guidetti latched on to a back-heel by Fabián 
Orellana to fire home. Then Mallo cut in from the right to beat Ryan at the 
near post.

Valencia could have conceded again before the final whistle sounded. 
Orellana’s attempted chip went just wide of the near post and then he struck 
the woodwork with the goal gaping.
