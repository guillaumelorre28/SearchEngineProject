A savoury toasted bun stuffed with cooked sausage topped with räksallad (shrimp 
salad), roasted shallots, salty pickles and tangy mustard may look like a 
regular hotdog, but the exquisite combination of toppings means it tastes 
divine – a bit like Nordic minimalism, which wraps high quality in simple 
packaging. Delicious.
