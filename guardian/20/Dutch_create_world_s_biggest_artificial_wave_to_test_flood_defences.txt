Studying the oceans is a matter of survival for the below-sea-level-dwelling 
Dutch, and scientists in theNetherlands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands> have now unveiled the world’s 
biggest manmade wave to prepare for the worst.

“Here we can test what happens if enormous waves hit our dykes,” said 
infrastructure minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen as she inaugurated the giant 
wave machine in the city of Delft on Monday.

The machine – named the Delta Flume – took three years to build and can send 
waves five metres high crashing down a 300-metre long and 9.5-metre deep 
channel.

Four powerful pistons behind a seven-metre high metal shield push 9m litres 
down the channel at a speed of 1,000 litres a second.

The aim is to simulate the power of the oceans to help Dutch engineers build 
better flood defences. Half of the country’s population lives below sea level 
on reclaimed land.

“Safety against floods is one of the main issues here in the Netherlands, so 
we want to test the dykes and the dunes,” said Bas Hofland, an expert in 
coastal defences.

“It is not possible to make it at a small scale, so we must have real 
life-scale dykes and dunes.”

After a centuries-long battle with the oceans, the Netherlands now calls 
itself the safest delta in the world – thanks to a network of dykes and dunes 
stretching over hundreds of miles.

“The water and its logistics are those sectors for which the Netherlands is 
known around the world,” Schultz van Haegen said.
