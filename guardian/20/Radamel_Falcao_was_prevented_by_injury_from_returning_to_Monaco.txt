The Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev has admitted the Ligue 1 club 
explored the possibility ofcutting short Radamel Falcao’s loan at Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/09/monaco-radamel-falcao-stay-chelsea>
, only for injury to end that prospect.

The Colombia striker joined Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> last summer after an 
unsuccessful loan at Manchester United.

But his spell at Stamford Bridge has been equally underwhelming, with just one 
goal and no appearances since October due to a thigh injury. A return date for 
Falcao is not known and Vasilyev revealed the former Porto and Atlético Madrid 
striker did return toMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> last 
week to be assessed with a view to returning to his parent club.

Vasilyev told RMC Sport: “It’s true that we’ve talked about Falcao on numerous 
occasions.

“The original idea was that he would return to Monaco to play the second half 
of the season. He came over and had a medical. Unfortunately, he was injured.

“So we took the decision that it would be better for him to stay with Chelsea. 
Could he return one day? I won’t close the door, that door remains open.”

Chelsea’s interim manager Guus Hiddink said he could understand the remarks. 
“For him it’s important to play, to start playing,” he said. “If you see his 
recent path here and also at Man United, not playing, that’s difficult for a 
player.”
