close range 20 minutes from full time after the visitors were reduced to 10 men

The hosts got off to a low-key start but gained the upper hand when 
Deportivo’s Fajr was sent off a minute into first-half stoppage time after a 
charge on Nicolas Gaitan earned him a second booking.

After Griezmann had an effort ruled out for offside, Yannick Carrasco came 
close eight minutes into the second half but his superb curling shot from the 
edge of the box was tipped onto the bar by Deportivo keeper German Lux.

The breakthrough eventually came when Gameiro collected a superb through ball 
from Juanfran in the box and Griezmann tapped in from his compatriot’s cross to 
give Atlético a deserved victory.
