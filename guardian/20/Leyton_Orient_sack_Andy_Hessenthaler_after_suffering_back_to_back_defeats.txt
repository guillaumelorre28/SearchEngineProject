The former Gillingham manager becomes the first managerial departure in the 
Football League this season following a three-match winless streak that left 
Orient 14th in League Two with three wins from nine games.

The 51-year-old, who signed a one-year deal during the summer, took over from 
the former player-manager Kevin Nolan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/12/kevin-nolan-leyton-orient-league-two-andy-hessenthaler>
 for the final five games of the 2015-16 campaign.

Despite a positive start to the season which saw Orient climb as high as 
fourth earlier in the month, the chairman Francesco Becchetti has made 
Hessenthaler his seventh managerial casualty in two years at the Matchroom 
Stadium following successive defeats to Yeovil and Notts County.

A statement on the club’s website read 
<http://www.leytonorient.com/news/article/2016-17/hessenthaler-departs-orient-3329205.aspx>
: “The club can confirm that Andy Hessenthaler has been relieved of his role as 
first team manager. We would like to thank Andy for his service to Leyton 
Orient since arriving in July 2015 and wish him well in his future career.

“Assistant manager Andy Edwards will be assuming Hessenthaler’s duties on an 
interim basis and will take charge of the team for tomorrow’s night’s Sky Bet 
League Two home game with Plymouth Argyle.”
