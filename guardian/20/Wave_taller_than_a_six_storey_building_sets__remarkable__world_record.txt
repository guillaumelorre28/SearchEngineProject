A towering 19-meter (62.3ft) wave in the North Atlantic has set a world record 
as the highest ever measured by a buoy, according to the UN’s weather agency.

An automated buoy measured the wave at a remote spot between Great Britain and 
Iceland on 4 February 2013 at 6.00 GMT,the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) said

Taller than a six-storey building, the huge wave occurred after a “very strong 
cold front” passed through the area, with winds of up to 43.8 knots (50.4mph).


“This is the first time we have ever measured a wave of 19 meters. It is a 
remarkable record,” the WMO assistant secretary general, Wenjian Zhang, said in 
the statement.


Classified as “the highest significant wave height as measured by a buoy” by 
the WMO Commission for Climatology’s Extremes Evaluation Committee, the wave 
crushed the previous record of 18.275 meters (59.96ft), measured in December 
2007 in the North Atlantic.

Wave height is defined as the distance from the crest of one wave to the 
trough of the next; significant wave height means the average of the highest 
one-third of waves measured by an instrument.


The North Atlantic, between the Grand Banks underwater plateau off Canada, the 
south ofIceland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland> and the west of 
Great Britain, is often the setting for gigantic waves, thanks to wind patterns 
which lead to “intense extra-tropical storms” sometimes called “bombs”, the WMO 
said.

The new wave height has been added to the WMO’s Global Weather & Climate 
Extremes Archive 
<https://wmo.asu.edu/content/world-meteorological-organization-global-weather-climate-extremes-archive>
, which tracks such milestones. The highest significant wave height measured by 
a ship observation occurred in the North Atlantic in February of 2000, and 
measured 29.05 meters (95.03 ft), according to the archive.

In the release, Dr Zhang emphasized that, though there have been strides in 
satellite technology, “the sustained observations and data records from moored 
and drifting buoys and ships still play a major role” in helping to understand 
the interaction between weather and ocean.


Automated buoys relay data on swells, sea current and temperatures for 
scientists, seafarers and climate researchers.
