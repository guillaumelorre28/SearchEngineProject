Arsenal are awaiting international clearance before confirming Laurent 
Koscielny as their player within "hours or days". The French centre-half has 
agreed personal terms on a €12m (£10.1m) move from Ligue 1 clubLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient>.

"The deal has not been confirmed because there are some administrative details 
to be validated," Lorient's general director, Serge Areguian, told the 
Guardian. "It will be made official in the hours or days to come."

It is a meteoric rise for Koscielny, who was playing for the Ligue 2 side 
Tours as recently as last year.

Even with the addition of the 24-year-old, Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> manager, recognises his side are 
light in central defence, where only the Belgium international Thomas Vermaelen 
and Switzerland's Johan Djourou are available.

Arsenal have sold Philippe Senderos to Fulham, while William Gallas and Mikaël 
Silvestre are believed to have played their last games at the Emirates Stadium 
after their contracts also expired.

Arsenal have also been linked with Bolton Wanderers' Gary Cahill and Fulham's 
Brede Hangeland.
