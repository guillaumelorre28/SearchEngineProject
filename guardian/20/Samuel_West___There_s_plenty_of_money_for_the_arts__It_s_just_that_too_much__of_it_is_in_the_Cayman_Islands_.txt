You’re currently directing April de Angelis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/angelis>’s new play After Electra 
<http://www.theatreroyal.com/whats-on/2015/after-electra/> in Plymouth. Why 
this play?
I read it and said yes very quickly. The last play I directed was [Alan 
Plater’s]Close the Coalhouse Door 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/apr/12/blogpost-alan-plater-newcastle-close-coalhouse-door-sam-west-sid-chaplin-alex-glasgow>
, about the history of the mining unions. There was a lot of homework. April’s 
play has a complex backstory, but it’s really about what occurs in a room 
between people.

Explain its title: Electra in Greek mythology was the woman who plotted to 
murder her mother…
“After” Electra as in “drawn from”, and also “chasing after”. You’ll have to 
see it to understand why. You don’t need to know the Greek play to enjoy this 
one. It’s cathartic: we go to see Greek tragedy not to learn how to murder our 
mothers but to learn why it’s a bad idea. There’s a good line in the original 
Sophocles: “Dying is not the worst. Worst is when you want to die but cannot.” 
It’s about an artist, Virgie [Marty Cruikshank], who wants to take control of 
her life and her body, and her daughter Haydn [Veronica Roberts]. It’s a very 
black comedy, full of brilliant one-liners. It explores motherhood and the 
guilt of balancing duty to children with duty to one’s art. There aren’t many 
tabloid stories condemning men who go off to pursue careers leaving their 
children at home, but if a mother does that, she’s demonised. It’s as if a 
mother should have some bottomless well of goodness on which to draw, which 
somehow enables her to sacrifice her own ambitions.

And life isn’t always like that?
No. Even in the theatre, a fairly egalitarian place, most of the structures 
are in place for the convenience of men rather than women. Most theatres don’t 
have creches, for example. When Vicky Featherstone took over as artistic 
director of the Royal Court, she was asked what single thing would have helped 
in her career and she said “childcare”.

You know about this yourself. You grew up in a theatre family. Both your 
parents [Prunella Scales and Timothy West] were on the stage.
Yes, I know what it is to have parents working away from home, trying to earn 
a living, to be good to their children. I don’t blame them for any of that. I 
understand the pressure they were under. I was very struck by something April 
said the other day, about feeling disempowered when her daughter was young, 
wondering where all her feminist bravado had gone.

This all feeds into the play. You have a baby daughter…
I’m glad I’m directing the play after becoming a parent. During [my 
daughter’s] first six months I tried to be home as much as I could. I was lucky 
to be filmingMr Selfridge [for ITV] so I could stay in London, and solvent. And 
asLaura [Wade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/sep/07/profile-laura-wade-the-riot-club-posh-bullingdon-club>
, his partner] is a writer, she was able to be down in Plymouth with our baby 
so I didn’t miss bath time. But I know it won’t always be straightforward, and 
I know everyone is struggling with these work-life challenges.

The play is about an elderly woman. It’s impossible not to think about your 
own mother, with whom you have worked so often…
It’s been emotional working on a play about an 84-year-old mother who is 
declining and wants to die, when my own mother, who is declining and has mild 
Alzheimer’s, wants nothing of the sort, yet finds her own ability to work – 
because she can no longer learn lines – impaired. I mustn’t generalise: as a 
family, our situation is much better than some others’. What I find most 
heartening is when I hear my mother read aloud, and find that she still has the 
most incredible gift for performing. Recently she did, very beautifully, a 
voiceover for an advert. It’s been winning awards. Radio producers, please take 
note.

You’re a busy tweeter <https://twitter.com/exitthelemming>. What is the appeal 
of Twitter?
It’s stimulating and useful. I can spread the word about what I’m up to, but I 
get back 10 times that via the various hubs I follow: articles, gigs, thoughts, 
jokes, puns, pictures. It’s great for journalism, activism, laughter. But the 
abuse problem is not being dealt with as well as it should. As a straight white 
male, I certainly see less of it, but I think we need to examine a society in 
which people hurl targeted abuse, especially towards women, under cover of 
anonymity. We have to fight it.

You describe yourself as a geek. Explain!
Far too many interests for someone trying to have a career: board games, 
Dungeons and Dragons, astronomy, stamp collecting, chamber music. I’ve been an 
avid follower of Wimbledon Football Club (now AFC) since I was 13. And I used 
to be a trainspotter…

A trainspotter? You’re sounding nerdy rather than geeky. I imagine you’re 
quite easy to send up…
Certainly. I was quite proud of my trainspotting. How much do you want me to 
send myself up? [Laughter] As a child I remember a grownup I admired telling me 
that I had all the makings of the world’s worst pedant. It was a good warning. 
[More laughter.]

And birdwatching? When did that start?
Only about 10 years ago. I was running Sheffield Theatres and living to the 
west of the city, the first time I’d really lived in the country, having grown 
up in south London. It was a good antidote to a stressful job. I went out most 
mornings. As Iris Murdoch said, you can be walking along, painting the whole 
world with your thoughts and sorrows and then you see a kestrel, and suddenly 
the world is all kestrel, and you are released.

There’s a theme developing here…
As a slightly scared child, I had a cataloguing gene, a way of making a 
complex world more manageable. I still feel, as I tick off a new species, that 
I’m making some sort of “progress” – ridiculous. More deeply, I’ve come to 
believe that we aren’t born into this world, we grow out of it, like leaves. 
When you’re a child, you think the world started when you were born. When you 
have a child, you see that everything up to that point was a part of their 
creation. Birding is a way of plugging into that energy.

You are chair of the National Campaign for the Arts. What’s the biggest 
challenge?
Well, public funding for the arts has fallen further and faster than ever 
before 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2015/mar/17/arts-index-2015-download-your-copy>
. We’ve got into the habit of thinking that public spending is bad. There’s 
plenty of money; it’s just that too much of it is in the Cayman Islands. The 
arts spread joy and encourage empathy. They’re not a luxury. Ill-health, 
prejudice, extremism – all these can be helped by the arts. Affordable access 
should be part of a civilised country’s life. That means proper investment.

The shadow arts minister, Chris Bryant, asked the other day: “Where are the 
Albert Finneys and the Glenda Jacksons?” Where are you on the debate about 
privately educated actors?
I’ve got nothing against Eton. It produced George Orwell, and also some 
extremely talented actors; it’s quite right that they should be prominent. What 
concerns me is that we don’t seem to have enough non-public school actors 
working in classical theatre. We need those voices.

It seems you could have had a few other careers: politician, naturalist, 
physicist, canal boat navigator? You’re keen on music too.
I used to play the cello and I still play the piano. When my daughter was born 
I thought she should hear some Bach so I struggled through the Aria of the 
Goldberg Variations. It was the first music she heard.

Is she still keen on Bach?
She’s more into late-70s punk. Another addiction. I have a jukebox 80% full of 
singles from 1978 and 1979… Buzzcocks, Magazine, Siouxsie and the Banshees. And 
I’m a big Brian Eno fan. I played herBy This River 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2WURHY3D4A>. Within three minutes she was 
asleep.
