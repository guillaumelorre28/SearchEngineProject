Arjen Robben headed the hosts in front after 67 minutes as Bayern, who 
suffered their first league setback witha 4-1 loss at second-placed Wolfsburg 
on Friday

, dug deep after Jérôme Boateng gave away a penalty and was sent off in the 
17th minute.

Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> failed to score from 
the spot, with Manuel Neuer saving Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s weak effort but 
after Robben’s goal Benedikt Höwedes levelled with a glancing header in the 
72nd minute to rescue a point and keep his team in fourth place.

The champions managed to protect their eight-point lead over a Wolfsburg side 
which failed to replicate last week’s form, rescuing a 1-1 draw atEintracht

Kevin De Bruyne’s 88th-minute equaliser, his third goal in two games.

Bayern have 46 points, ahead of Wolfsburg

Borussia Mönchengladbach, on 33, closed the gap on the Wolves thanks to a 1-0 
win over visiting Freiburg, with Patrick Herrmann on target. Schalke are fourth 
on 31 points.

“I am very satisfied,” the Bayern coach, Pep Guardiola, said. “Of course we 
wanted the three points but our performance was better [than last week].”

It was supposed to be a day of celebration, with the Allianz Arena sold out at 
its new capacity of 75,000, some 4,000 more than before. However, Boateng 
spoiled the home fans’ joy early on when he brought down Sidney Sam in the area 
but Choupo-Moting’s weak, low penalty was easily parried by Neuer.

Schalke lost most of their energy in the second half, with Bayern far more 
efficient with 10 men than earlier in the game. Guardiola took a big gamble 
when he brought on Robert Lewandowski midway through the second half but the 
move paid off when the Poland striker forced a corner that resulted in Robben 
giving the hosts the lead.

The Spanish coach celebrated wildly and even hugged a surprised fourth 
official but his spontaneous outburst of joy was short-lived.

Höwedes scored a deserved equaliser five minutes later to give the Schalke 
coach Roberto Di Matteo, who won the Champions League with Chelsea when they 
beat Bayern in their Munich stadium in 2013, something to smile about.
