The nine-times Ligue 1 champions Marseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> secured their top-flight 
status with a 1-0 victory at Angers.

Marseille, the only French side to have won the Champions League after lifting 
the trophy in 1993, had gone 11 league games without a win, slipping as low as 
16th in the standings with three matches to play.

“It’s a relief, it’s the minimum we can do for the club and for the 
supporters,” the midfielder Lassana Diarra said. “The club deserves better than 
this season.”

Michy Batshuayi’s 24th-minute goal was enough to beat Angers, taking Marseille 
up to 13th, eight points clear of 18th-placed Stade de Reims.

Marseille challenged for the title before an end-of-season slump last term, 
ending the campaign in fourth and missing out on Champions League qualification 
by two points.

Marcelo Bielsa stepped down as coach in the hours after their opening-day 
defeat by Caen this season and his replacement, Michel, lasted only until April 
when he was suspended following a poor run of form.

The assistant coach and former player, Franck Passi, took the reins until the 
season’s end and has guided Marseille to the French Cup final. They will play 
the champions, Paris Saint-Germain, on 21 May.

“It’s been a very difficult and a very long season,” the captain, Steve 
Mandanda, told reporters. “At least now we can begin to prepare well for the 
final.“

Margarita Louis-Dreyfus put the club up for sale in April and, although their 
Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> status has been 
secured, Marseille’s long-term future remains uncertain.
