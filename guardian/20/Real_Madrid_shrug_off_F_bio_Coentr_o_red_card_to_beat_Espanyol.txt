Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> returned to 
winning ways after consecutive defeats when the La Liga leaders shrugged off 
playing most of the second half with 10 men to secure a 3-0 win at home to 
mid-table Espanyol.

Beaten 2-1 at Valencia in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> last weekend and 2-0 at 
Atlético Madrid in a Copa del Rey last 16, first leg in midweek, Real took the 
lead at their Bernabéu when Cristiano Ronaldo set James Rodríguez up to score 
in the 12th minute.

Gareth Bale arrowed a free-kick over the wall and into the net off a post to 
make it 2-0 in the 28th minute but Fábio Coentrão was shown a straight red card 
for a dangerous tackle eight minutes into the second half.

Despite the loss of the full-back, Real remained in control and the substitute 
Nacho clipped home a third goal for the European champions, the defender’s 
first for the club, 14 minutes from time.

The victory stretched Real’s lead over second-placed Barcelona at the top to 
four points. Barça play at home to champions Atlético, who are third and level 
on 38 points with their hosts, on Sunday.

Real, whose Spanish record winning streak of 22 matches was ended by Valencia, 
have a game in hand over Barça and Atlético, with all three teams now having 
played 17 matches.
