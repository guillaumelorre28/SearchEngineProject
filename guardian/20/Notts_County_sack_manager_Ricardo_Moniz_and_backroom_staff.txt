Notts County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottscounty> have parted 
company with their manager, Ricardo Moniz.

The Magpies have won just two league games since October and sit 15th in the 
table following their relegation from League One last season.

The academy manager, Mick Halsall, and under-21 team coach, Richard Dryden, 
will take interim charge of the first team, the club said in a statement. The 
coaches Dave Kevan and Dean Yates have also left the League Two club.

The former Red Bull Salzburg and 1860 Munich manager – from the Netherlands – 
Moniz lasted less than nine months at Meadow Lane,having been appointed in April

.

The County chairman, Ray Trew, said: “I made it clear when appointing Ricardo 
that I wanted someone who would bring an exciting, attacking brand of football 
to Meadow Lane and I think it would be fair to say that in part he has done 
this, with some eye-catching attacking play on show at times this season.

“However, whilst showing considerable flair at times, particularly here at 
home, I feel that we have lacked a level of discipline and organisation in our 
defensive play throughout the season which has undermined our efforts and our 
right to play this free-flowing attacking style.”

Moniz’s last match in charge was a 2-2 draw against Morecambe on Monday.

Trew added: “My goal for this club is, and always has been, to improve and 
whilst I by no means want to keep chopping and changing managers, I refuse to 
let us stagnate and I feel that the time is right for a new approach to 
reignite our season and get us back on track to where we want and need to be.”
