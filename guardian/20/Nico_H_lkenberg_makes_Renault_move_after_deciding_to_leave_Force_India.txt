Nico Hülkenberg will join Renault after leaving the Force India team at the 
end of theFormula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> season. 
After Force India announced earlier on Friday that the 29-year-old was going, 
Renault confirmed he will be arriving next season on a “multi-year” deal.

“In his stint with Renault <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/renault>, 
Michael Schumacher not only helped make Germany an F1 nation, he also sparked 
my enthusiasm and fire for racing,” Hülkenberg said in a statement.

Either the Dane Kevin Magnussen or the British driver Jolyon Palmer – 
Renault’s current F1 pair – will have to make way for Hülkenberg, who thanked
Force India <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/force-india> for not blocking 
his move.

“I am grateful that Force India has given me the chance to take up this new 
opportunity,” he said. “It has always been my dream to work for a manufacturer 
team. F1’s new regulations [in 2017] will change the game, and give our team a 
good opportunity.”

There are four races left this season and Hülkenberg sits ninth in the 
drivers’ standings, one place behind his team-mate Sergio Pérez.

Force India, meanwhile, are vying with Williams for fourth place in the 
constructors’ championship in which they hold a 10-point lead. Both have 
Mercedes engines, while Renault provides its own.

“For the remaining races, I will give my best for Force India to reach fourth 
place,” Hülkenberg said. “This would be a great achievement for the whole Force 
India team, the biggest success in its history, and a great end to a fantastic 
time.”

The Force India team principal, Vijay Mallya, said: “Having spent five years 
with us, Nico has become a great friend and contributed a huge amount to the 
team’s success. He’s an outstanding driver, who has scored more points for this 
team than anybody else. While it’s true we will miss Nico, we respect his 
decision.”

Having first broken into F1 with Williams in 2010, Hülkenberg has 113 career 
races. His best finish was fourth place, which he has achieved three times. He 
also raced for Sauber.

Force India have been linked with a move for the 20-year-old French driver 
Esteban Ocon for next season. Ocon, a former Renault reserve driver, is racing 
for the Manor team.
