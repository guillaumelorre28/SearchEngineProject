 due to fans’ racist chanting.

The Serie A fixture was put on hold by referee Massimiliano Irrati for around 
three minutes after home supporters at the Olympic Stadium in Rome aimed racist 
abuse at the visiting centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly.

Lazio were fined €50,000 for the chants, plus a further €15,000 for insults 
aimed atNapoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> fans. Two sections 
of the ground close to the Curva Nord will also be closed for one match.

Lazio’s manager, Stefano Pioli, said after the game: “I would not have stopped 
the match as that only lends importance to a minority. If I had been referee I 
would not have stopped it. We also have players of colour and they are treated 
well.”

Koulibaly, however, described the chanting as “ugly” and praised the referee 
in a post on his Instagram account <https://www.instagram.com/p/BBWABrCx07q/>.

“I want to thank the Lazio <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> 
players, but especially the referee Irrati for his courage,” he wrote. “I thank 
my team-mates, the public and our fans, who have been a great support against 
these ugly chants. I want to thank everyone for the messages of solidarity 
which I have received.”
