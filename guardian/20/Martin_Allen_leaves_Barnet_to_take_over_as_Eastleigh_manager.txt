Martin Allen has left Barnet <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnet> to 
become the new manager of Vanarama National League side Eastleigh, the Sky Bet 
League Two club has announced.

The Bees revealed that Eastleigh made an approach for the 51-year-old on 
Wednesday following the departure of Ronnie Moore on the same day due to 
“personal circumstances”.

Tony Kleanthous, the Barnet chairman, told barnetfc.com: “Martin has asked to 
be released from his contract so he can join Eastleigh.

“The approach came out of the blue yesterday [Wednesday] but it was quite 
clear that Martin had decided that he wanted to take the opportunity they were 
offering to him.

“He leaves with our best wishes having done a great job helping to rebuild the 
football club after our relegation into the National League.

“Our promotion two years ago was one of my highlights as chairman and I was 
always aware Martin would be in demand as a result.

“The club is undergoing many changes. We have made the transition off the 
field needed for us to progress through the Football League and we must ensure 
our on-field development matches the facilities we have created.

“Martin’s departure presents us with an opportunity and we intend to appoint 
somebody who will help develop our younger players and integrate them into our 
first-team, as well as bringing in players who can play at a higher standard.”

The development team coach Rossi Eames will take charge of the first-team 
affairs on an interim basis, assisted by the Academy manager Henry Newman.
