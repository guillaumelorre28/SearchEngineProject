As Nadezhda Guriyeva huddled with her children on the floor of the sweltering 
school gymnasium, an explosive device rested ominously just a few feet away. 
Boris and Vera, Guriyeva’s two older children, were dressed for a folk dance 
performance that had been planned to celebrate the first day of school. Those 
festivities never began.

Boris and Vera were among the 334 people, including 186 children, who were 
killed amid explosions and hails of bullets after being held captive for two 
days ina terrorist attack on School No 1 in Beslan

Guriyeva’s youngest daughter, Irina, survived.

It was Irina’s escape that has allowed Guriyeva to carry on in the aftermath 
of such horror. “I had no choice,” Guriyeva says. “I had my little daughter. 
She was always watching me to see if I cried. I couldn’t even cry.”

Ten years have passed since armed militants stormed the school on 1 September 
2004, and took 1,100 children, mothers and teachers hostage in the gymnasium. 
The ordeal came to an end 52 hours later. But for the survivors and their loved 
ones, it changed everything.

“Some left for good and completely altered their lives,” says Guriyeva, who 
has taught at School No 1 for 36 years. She returned to work just two months 
after the tragedy. “Some dedicated their lives to investigating what happened. 
Some lend me a helping hand, for instance, with the museum [commemorating the 
tragedy]. Some still cry and live at the cemetery, trying to raise their 
children there.”

Guriyeva, 54, coped with witnessing the deaths of her own son and daughter in 
part by internalising her sorrow. “I decided that, however terrible the grief, 
you must not transfer it to other people,” she says. “It feels like it happened 
yesterday.”


After seizing the school that morning, dozens of Ingush and Chechen gunmen 
herded the hostages from the courtyard into the small gymnasium and rigged it 
with homemade bombs. They issued their demands:the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the war-torn North Caucasus republic of Chechnya

Guriyeva, who had already taught at the school for 26 years, was one of the 
last to be moved inside. Only then did she realise her three children were 
there.

“Ten years have gone by,” she says. “I just don’t understand how we survived 
it. Not dying from the explosions, but from those 52 hours we spent there. It 
was real horror.”

When the hostages failed to remain quiet, the gunmen executed a man at the 
front of the gymnasium to make their point.

Tears of blood

At first children were allowed to use the bathroom, where they tried to drink 
water to bring short relief from the stifling heat at the end of a fiercely hot 
summer. To this day, mourners bring open bottles of water to the gymnasium as 
offerings to the dead. Boris, 14, was running a temperature that day and was 
too weak to go.


“The militants broke the sinks and smashed the pipes so that we couldn’t drink 
water,” Guriyeva says. “The [children] tried to soak it up in their shirts 
where it dripped in order to bring it back. Some children brought their mums 
water in their mouths.”

Negotiations made no progress, and by the second day almost no children were 
allowed out.


After midday on 3 September, Guriyeva remembers an almost delirious longing 
for the standoff to end, whatever the consequences. It soon did. A deadly 
silence had often reigned in the hall. The militants had fired shots into the 
ceiling to keep them still. But already the hundreds of captives were becoming 
unruly.


One little girl who managed to escape ran straight to a drinking fountain, 
Guriyeva recalls. “She couldn’t stay away from the fountain - to the water,” 
she says. “A sniper killed her on the spot.”

Shortly after 1 pm, a powerful explosion shook the gymnasium.

Those who could summon the strength stood up and ran, though many were 
promptly gunned down as they fled, Guriyeva says. “From the second floor attic, 
the militants began firing at the backs of the children running away,” she says.

A second explosion followed quickly, bringing the roof down and igniting a 
fire. “When I came to, my little Verochka was no longer alive,” Guriyeva says.

She points to a photograph of Vera, who was 11-years-old at the time of the 
attack.

“She had the same expression as she has there. She had exactly that smile, 
only her eyes were closed and there were tears of blood on her cheeks,” 
Guriyeva says.

In her hand, Guriyeva recalls, Vera clasped a cross that she had found, and 
her arms were crossed over her chest. She had a shrapnel wound in the back of 
her head.


Boris was covered in blood, much of it Guriyeva’s. But shrapnel had penetrated 
his stomach and exited through his back.


Irina suffered only minor injuries, and Guriyeva told her to make a dash for 
it. Boris was still breathing, and Guriyeva stayed with him. With her arm badly 
injured, however, he was too heavy to carry. She dragged him to a group of 
hostages who were also unable to move due to their injuries. Fragments of body 
parts lay nearby.


The militants ordered Guriyeva out of the gymnasium toward the cafeteria. 
Grabbing a small girl by the hand, she ended up in the adjacent kitchen where, 
parched, they drank filthy water that their captors had used to defrost chicken 
legs. She told the little girl to wait for her there and returned to get Boris. 
The militants stopped her and turned her away. One of them smashed out her 
teeth with a rifle.

As Russian special forces moved in, Guriyeva escaped out of a window. Irina 
had made it too.

Both Boris’ and Vera’s remains would be scorched in the blaze that tore 
through the gym. Vera’s body was identified from the traditional dress she had 
worn for the planned folk dance.

“After such a cruel situation, every person has to find meaning in life again, 
to find something to live for - or to just fade away and end up in the 
cemetery, too. We had suicides among adult men. A fair number of our men ended 
their own lives,” says Guriyeva.

Questions still persist about culpability in the bloody conclusion of the 
crisis, including whether the militants or Russian security forces initiated 
the final firefight.Some were unable to forget these questions

.

Guriyeva’s husband, Stanislav, was tormented by thoughts of revenge and the 
conflicting belief that finding those responsible was impossible, and that 
mindless violence leads to more violence, she explains.

A year-and-a-half ago, at age 46, Stanislav passed away. He had turned to 
alcohol. “He couldn’t sort himself out. He turned to alcohol to forget, and 
alcohol finished him off,” Guriyeva says.

A new life

Two months after the tragedy, Guriyeva was teaching again.


A new school was built opposite School No 1, across the railway tracks where 
cows and goats graze. Multicoloured lettering above the entrance proclaims: 
“The start of a new life.”

“My first lesson was with my son’s old class,” she says. “I was walking down 
the hallway and a little girl came up to me and said: ‘Great, Nadezhda, you’ve 
come! Where’s Borya?’ People didn’t know at that point who had died and who 
hadn’t. Our first class, we simply cried together.”

For Guriyeva, teaching was a source of strength: it’s like acting, she says.

“Whether you like it or not, whether it hurts or not, whether your heart is 
breaking into pieces, you have to go out and teach children,” she says. “I had 
10 children outside the school classes whose homes I worked at. Before going 
in, it was: deep breath, put a smile on and go in, finish teaching, go out and 
cry all the way to the next home. Some of the children were so difficult.”

But for Guriyeva, it’s not about escaping the past.

“The story of School No 1 is our story,” she says. “The terrorist attack is 
our story. It’s hard. It’s terrifying. It’s bloody. But it is our story. We 
remember it. We didn’t move to a new school and begin a new life. We didn’t 
start afresh. We continue to live our life.”
