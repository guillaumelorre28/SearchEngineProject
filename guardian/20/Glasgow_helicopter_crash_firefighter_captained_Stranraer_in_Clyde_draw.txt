A firefighter who formed part of the rescue operation at the Glasgow 
helicopter disaster scene throughout Friday night captained Stranraer in a
Scottish Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup> tie on Saturday.

Frank McKeown was one of those involved in a huge operation at the Clutha 
Vaults pub after the tragic incident which has resulted at least eight deaths. 
After finishing work at 8am and with one hour's sleep, McKeown took his regular 
place in the heart of theStranraer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stranraer> defence for the match at 
Clyde, which ended in a 1-1 draw.

"What happened didn't sink in until I had left the job," McKeown said. "It was 
terrible, but I didn't think about pulling out of the game. I was really tired 
but I wanted to play. Football is a relief after something like that. I just 
tried to concentrate on the game to take my mind off things.

"When you look at the pictures you think how lucky you are and you appreciate 
things like being able to go out and play football. I have seen a lot of 
horrible things in my career but that is one of the worst. My thoughts are with 
the families of all those involved. The crews that were there did a great job."

McKeown was part of a team of 150 firefighters on the crash scene.

In a statement, Stranraer FC said: "Our sympathies go out to the family and 
friends of those who died and our thoughts are with those who were injured. We 
are enormously proud of how Frank helped during the disaster and the fact that 
he still played yesterday despite what he must have been through.

"It just goes to show that all of these players are part-time. Frank will 
regularly do a night shift and then come and play the next day. It shows the 
commitment inScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> from the 
part-time players."
