Vinny Samways has rejected the chance to return to English football by 
rejoiningLas Palmas <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laspalmas> until the 
end of the season.

The former Everton and Tottenham midfielder parted company with Sevilla 
earlier this month after barely half a season with the Primera Liga club.

He was believed to be interesting Walsall, but the chance to extend his career 
in Spain with his former club swayed him against a return to his native England.

Samways joined Las Palmas in the 1996-1997 season from Everton but left last 
summer after their relegation.

"Las Palmas and Vinny Samways have reached an agreement with the player until 
June 30," the Segunda Liga club confirmed.

The 34-year-old will replace injured midfielder Alex Castro until the end of 
the season.

Las Palmas are fifth in the Segunda Division, six points off a promotion place.
