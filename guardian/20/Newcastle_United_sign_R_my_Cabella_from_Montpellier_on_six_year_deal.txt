Rémy Cabella has completed his move to Newcastle. The club confirmed on Sunday 
night that the 24-year-old had signed a six-year contract after joining from 
the French clubMontpellier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/montpellier-football-team> for an 
undisclosed fee.

Cabella, who has been in Newcastle’s sights since they tried to sign him as a 
replacement for Yohan Cabaye in January, becomes Alan Pardew’s fourth summer 
acquisition after Siem de Jong, Jack Colback and Ayoze Pérez.

Cabella, an attacking midfielder, said: “It is great to finally be a Newcastle 
player. This is a move that I really wanted to make as I have heard nothing but 
good things aboutNewcastle United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> from everyone I spoke to.

“I wanted to join a great English club and that is why I have arrived here. 
I’m looking forward to pulling on the shirt and playing in this magnificent 
stadium, and I will give this club my maximum.”

Pardew said: “He is a player who I am sure will excite our fans. He has flair, 
hard work and commitment and is going to bring a talent, energy and quality to 
St James’ Park that our supporters will enjoy.

“Rémy has great ideas when the ball comes to him and along with Siem de Jong 
is going to improve an area where we definitely needed some help.”

Newcastle are still in the market for an out-and-out striker and are working 
to find a replacement for Mathieu Debuchy before allowing Arsenal to sign the 
full-back. To that end they have entered talks with Feyenoord over the Holland 
defender Daryl Janmaat.
