Gestede, who scored five times in the Premier League last season, has caught 
the attention

 of several Premier League sides despite starting only eight Championship 
matches for Villa this season. Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, as well 
as Newcastle United, were also interested in signing the former Blackburn 
striker but it appears Middlesbrough have won the race after convincing the 
28-year-old to move to the north-east.

Gestede was in the crowd at the Riverside Stadium for Boro’s 3-0 defeat by 
Liverpool and is expected to sign a three-year contract with the club.

His departure could lead to the Scotland striker Jordan Rhodes heading the 
other way, with Villa’s manager, Steve Bruce, interested in signing the player 
purchased from Blackburn last year.

Newcastle may now turn their attention to Brentford’s Scott Hogan, with Palace 
and Swansea both prepared to pay £15m for Newcastle’s Serbia striker, 
Aleksandar Mitrovic.
