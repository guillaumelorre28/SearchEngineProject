Full-time: Mansfield 1-2 Liverpool

But they do nothing with that minute other than try claim a handball that 
never was. It's all over.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are through.

5.54pm GMT 

93 mins There is one more minute for Mansfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mansfield> to salvage something here.

Updated at 5.56pm GMT

5.52pm GMT 

91 mins The CEO is urging her side on but to little efect at the moment. I've 
a feeling Liverpool will hold on from here ... but just as I type that Green 
forces Jones into a spectacular save

Updated at 7.30pm GMT

5.51pm GMT 

89 mins A free-kick in the corner is wasted by Mansfield but they do have 4 
more minutes left in which to snatch an equalizer.

5.49pm GMT 

86 mins  Geohaghon has been getting his throw on but to little effect so far. 
"You know, I have an idea that the officials are supposed to flag for an 
offence. They didn't. The press will have yet another field day, which is fair 
enough. What baffles me, however, is how the likes of Henry for instance is 
viewed as a paragon of virtue after he did worse against the ROI. Double 
standards?" ask Sally Officer. I can assure you, no one in Ireland sees Henry 
as "a paragon of virtue".

Updated at 5.50pm GMT

5.47pm GMT 

84 mins It looks like Liverpool are the more nervous of the two sides now. As 
deserved as that goal was for Mansfield, it might just have come a bit too late 
for them.

5.45pm GMT 

82 mins Another free-kick outside the box for Mansfield. They couldn't could 
they? No is the answer.

5.43pm GMT 

Goal! Mansfield 1-2 Liverpool (Green)

Where did that come from? A set-piece of course. A free-kick is floated in and 
cleared by Liverpool. But Daniel does well to recover it and sends the ball to 
the back post. When it reaches there it is turned into the danger zone and 
Green puts his side to within one from there. It ain't over just yet folks.

Updated at 5.43pm GMT

5.39pm GMT 

76 mins Down on Mansfield's left-hand side, Downing and Suarez link up well. 
The winger sends over a decent ball which Shelvey Fellaini's before shooting 
wide. He should have done better from that.

Updated at 7.31pm GMT

5.36pm GMT 

74 mins Set-pieces always seemed like Mansfield's best way of scoring today 
but they have continued to waste them all match. Their latest effort fails to 
make it past the first Liverpool defender.

5.35pm GMT 

72 mins The Mansfield fans have switched their attentions to the Liverpool 
fans and are now telling them what they think of them. Here's what another 
Liverpool fan, Seb, thinks of the last effort from Suarez. "I think it's a 
shame, as a Liverpool fan, that that was allowed. Suarez deserves goals and I 
think, and most would, that Liverpool would have probably won anyway. It just 
detracts from our efforts."

5.31pm GMT 

70 mins "I'm sure it wont affect the numerous articles slaughtering Luis 
tomorrow for single-handedly destroying the FA cup but he does always kiss his 
wrist after every goal, it's not to be provocative," argues Benjamin Nelson. He 
could've skipped it this time though, argues me.

Updated at 5.32pm GMT

5.30pm GMT 

67 mins Oh, I was almost typing goal there. Downing breaks forward, lays the 
ball to Suarez, who chests it and gets it into the path of Shelvey. He has some 
room to hit it but it is a tight angle and his shot does nothing. Would have 
been a great team goal though.

5.28pm GMT 

65 mins Evan Fanning with a funny. Liverpool, meanwhile, have regained control 
of the game.
Evan Fanning (@evanfanning) 
The greatest crime against football to take place on the pitch at Mansfield 
today remains Daniel Sturridge's dance

62 mins Just saw a picture of that handball. It is very, very blatant. The 
Mansfield fans let him know what they think he is. Duarte is a Liverpool fan by 
the way; hence the tweet.
Fernando Duarte (@Fernando_Duarte) 
That goal should never have stood.

Goal! Mansfield 0-2 Liverpool (Suarez)

Well it's a goal, but it shouldn't have been a goal. A wonderful pass 
from Shelvey finds Suarez, he feeds it to Downing who plays it back to the 
striker in the box. He shoots, his shot is blocked, he handles it for control 
and he then runs the ball into the net. He kisses his wrist to celebrate. That 
might just end any resistance Mansfield had.

Updated at 5.37pm GMT

5.19pm GMT 

57 mins Briscoe and Green are causing the Liverpool defence all sorts of 
worries right now. 

5.17pm GMT 

53 mins And there is another claim for a peno for Mansfield but this one is 
far stronger than the last as Allen really did use his arm to block Green's 
backheel from its goalward direction. Liverpool's response to this pressure? 
Bring Suarez on. Take Sturridge off. (He is welcomed with boos.) Suso is also 
hooked for Henderson

Updated at 5.18pm GMT

5.14pm GMT 

51 mins Mansfield are claiming that Carragher stopped their latest effort with 
his hand but it would have been a very harsh decision on Carragher if that had 
been given as a peno.

5.11pm GMT 

50mins "It is the emails that say they know what you are wearing - or worse 
yet, accurately describe it - that you should really worry about," says Marie 
Meyer accurately.

5.10pm GMT 

48 mins This is all Mansfield so far. They are really pouring the pressure on. 
If they can keep this up, who knows.

5.10pm GMT 

 46 mins  And the first chance of the half goes to Mansfield who come out 
swinging. It takes a good save from Jones from a sharp-angled shot from Howell 
to stop the Stags from drawing level. Oh and now Briscoe has just had a good 
effort blocked. Stormer of a start this.

Updated at 7.34pm GMT

5.06pm GMT 

The boys are back on pitch

45 mins Here we go yet again. Let's hope Coxy has earned his money at 
half-time and we get something more from Mansfield for this second half. He 
didn't think his side believed in themselves for the first one.

5.03pm GMT 

Can people please stop asking what I wearing?

It is beginning to freak me out. In a good way.

Updated at 5.06pm GMT

5.02pm GMT 

More half-time talk

Seamus Devlin is bold. Not bold in the childish sense of the word but bold in 
the Indiana Jones sense of the word. And he has something to offer all 
you Sturridge naysayers.

Would any Liverpool fan care to take a bet on who will score more goals each 
season, Sturridge or Jelavic? Brave man that would. Maybe even Sturridge or 
Baines?

Updated at 5.02pm GMT

4.58pm GMT 

Half time emails and tweets

"The going price for a striker is about £1m/goal/season. Sturridge should 
therefore represent good value. Michu and RVP are Marge Simpson Chanel Dress 
über bargains," types Niall Mullen, crowbarring in an excellent Simpsons 
reference. While below you will find Ishmael Lasting's thoughts on Matt 
Dony's argument-starter.
Ishmael Lasting (@ishmaellasting)

4.51pm GMT 

Half time: Mansfield 0-1 Liverpool

Magic. Of. The. Cup

4.50pm GMT 

44 mins More good link-up play between Shelvey and Sturridge has the striker 
running at goal. He shoots for glory but the tips of Marriott's fingers deny 
him a second goal. There's one minute of injury time to play.

Updated at 7.34pm GMT

4.48pm GMT 

43 mins I just got an email from someone asking me what I am wearing. That's 
very odd.

4.46pm GMT 

 42 mins "I think Mansfield will take heart from Suso's performance for 
Liverpool. He keeps losing the ball," jokes (probably) Jan Molby

4.45pm GMT 

41 mins This has gone flatter than an ironing board.

4.44pm GMT 

40 mins "Harry Crane seems to have hit that particular nail right where a nail 
wants to be hit," reckons Rob Marriott. "Sturridge is a capable player. He'll 
probably do okay for Liverpool, score a few goals, and I wouldn't expect a 
Carroll-esque humiliation. But the idea that we couldn't get anyone better for 
all that money is just ludicrous - I sometimes wonder if the club even employ 
any scouts any more, or if transfer targets are just plucked from a list of 
names that appear the most often in the trusty old Rumour Mill."

4.43pm GMT 

36 mins Lee Beevers gets the first yellow of the day. The resulting free-kick, 
near the corner of the box, is sent in and eventually cleared by the Stags' 
defence. In the scrap from that clearance, Lucas also enters the yellow book.

4.40pm GMT 

35 mins Sturridge gets the ball just outside the Mansfield box, he floats past 
a few defenders and lays the ball back for Shelvey – the two have combined well 
on a number of occasions today – but the Shelvester is surrounded by defenders 
and can't do anything with it.

Updated at 7.35pm GMT

4.38pm GMT 

33 mins Well, well. Now the crowd are back to life. After some nice passing 
and pressure, the aforementioned Green gets the ball on the edge of the box and 
thumps a shot towards Jones who is forced into a good save.

4.35pm GMT 

30 mins Another free-kick is whipped into the Liverpool box but the Reds, once 
more, deal with it easily enough. Harry Crane has some thoughts on Sturridge 
situation.

I was just about to say how good Sturridge was and tell Matt Dony he had 
nothing to worry about, then i went and looked at his stats. Apart from that 
spell at Bolton and a short time at Chelsea, he's been awful, 1 goal in 26 
before he went on loan and only 12 in 37 since he came back, and most of those 
were scored over a very short period. £12m? Michu and Hernandez cost £8m 
combined.

4.33pm GMT 

27 mins A 1990s-Republic-of-Ireland style long ball finds Green battling in 
the box with Coates. The defender bundles him over without really getting the 
ball and rather surprisingly, not one soul within the ground calls for a 
penalty.

Updated at 7.36pm GMT

4.30pm GMT 

25 mins This is too easy for Liverpool, even Downing looks like a good player. 
His has just swerved his way into the box and had a shot blocked.

Updated at 4.30pm GMT

4.28pm GMT 

24 mins Alistair Reece has got some love for the boy Sturridge: "I think the 
lad has the ability to do really well at Anfield, and I for one am glad to have 
a player like him at the club, especially as he has a point to prove."

4.27pm GMT 

22 mins And this is the first time that we see Mansfield's famed long throw 
from the incredibly named Exodus Geohaghon. He lobs it in, Delap, style, 
Liverpool head it away, Stoke style.

Updated at 4.29pm GMT

4.26pm GMT 

20 mins A good deliver from a Mansfield set-piece goes to waste when none of 
their players in the box bother to jump and head it. They still look a bit 
nervous poor chaps. Those of you expecting a cupset should probably look 
elsewhere.

Updated at 7.36pm GMT

4.24pm GMT 

19 mins I though Liverpool fans would be embracing Sturridge after that good 
start but Matt Dony is having none of it.

I really dislike Sturridge, and I'm furious he's now a Liverpool player. 
Saying that, I don't know which would give me most/least satisfaction; him 
being yet another useless, expensive signing that fans of other clubs can joke 
about over and over and over again, or me being proved wrong, and him being a 
great signing, knocking in goals at will. He's clearly got the raw ability to 
do that, so it could go either way.

4.22pm GMT 

17 mins "'I grew up on a farm in South Dakota, this Mansfield pitch is filling 
me with nostalgia' This reads like a limerick by Neil Young lyric, Ian. 
Beautiful," teary-eyes Ben Watson

4.20pm GMT 

14 mins What the Hell just happened there? Sturridge beats the offside trap, 
has hours and hours just to beat the keeper, He should, he doesn't. He tries to 
be far too clever and has his effort saved by Marriott. That should have been 
2-0. "Chelsea reject," croon the Mansfield fans

4.18pm GMT 

 13 mins Another wasted opportunity from Mansfield. They are looking more 
nervous than a teenager on a first date. Howell breaks forward and just needs 
to tap it to his his team-mate rampaging up the left wing. Instead he hits it 
with enough power to reach Brad Jones.

4.16pm GMT 

11 mins But now they can get their voices going. Some nice balling sees Wisdom 
give away a silly free-kick juts outside the box. Clements stands behind it. 
Clements hits the wall. 

Updated at 7.38pm GMT

4.14pm GMT 

9 mins The home crowd are rather silent now.

4.13pm GMT 

Goal! Mansfield 0-1 Liverpool (Sturridge)

Well that was all too easy. Shelvey picks up the ball up just near the centre 
circle, takes a stride or two forward and then splits the Mansfield defence 
with the juciest of passes. One on one with the keeper, Sturridge runs on to 
it, does his thing and puts his side ahead with a confident finish.

Updated at 4.17pm GMT

4.11pm GMT 

6 mins "I grew up on a farm in South Dakota," remembers Marie Meyer. "The 
Mansfield pitch is filling me with nostalgia." I've always wondered what South 
Dakota is like. Now I know.

4.09pm GMT 

5 mins And there is the first shot of match. Suso puts the trees in Sherwood 
Forest in more danger than Marriott's net.

4.08pm GMT 

4 mins Only one Liverpool player has worked his magic here before – anyone not 
watching ESPN know who that is? The first corner of the game goes to the Reds 
but Mansfield clear it away easy enough.

4.06pm GMT 

2 min "Seize the moment," said Cox to his troops in the dressing room. 
Inspirational stuff that. I take back what I said about the pitch by the way, 
it looks awful in the middle and Mansfield trained on it yesterday, the cheeky 
sods. Despite that Liverpool are passing it around easy enough so far. 
Mansfield yet to really get a touch so far.

4.04pm GMT 

1 min Here we go folks. Liverpool are in their traditional red, Mansfield are 
in their traditional blue and yellow. The away side play right to left and the 
home side do the opposite because if they didn't, well, it would all be just 
too easy for Liverpool wouldn't it? There is some serious noise coming from the 
stands.

Updated at 4.04pm GMT

3.59pm GMT 

The Liverpool lads are in the tunnel and, after an age, are joined by the 
Mansfield lads who are faffing around in the dressing room doing their laces 
and gelling the hair and whatever it is they have to do 5 minutes before 
kick-off. Almost time.

3.56pm GMT 

Phil Simmonds looks young in his picture but he was here all those years ago. 
"I was at Field Mill in around 1967 on a cold, snowy night when the Stags beat 
West Ham 3 -0. Since Hurst, Moore and Peters were playing for the Hammers that 
night I reckon Mansfield just about won the world cup. May history repeat 
itself."

3.52pm GMT 

Brendan says the pitch is fine. He's seen worse. Coxy, though, hopes it can be 
a "leveler". It looks all right to me. The groundsman is a Liverpool fan. In 
fact, everyone interviewed from Mansfield this week seems to be a Liverpool fan.

Good afternoon and welcome to Mansfield v Liverpool

"Hope," reckons Rich Hall, "is right below wishful thinking and right above 
performing a rain dance 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdyEdHRxSjk&feature=player_detailpage#t=115s>." 
And if this were any normal walk of life, the mayor of Mansfield would have 
spent the week wearing a crown of feathers and turquoise and leading the 
population of the town on a trip to the light in tribute to Winalagalis. 
Because with 93 league places and millions of pounds of players separating 
these sides, it would seem that hope, like it did with the entrants to Dante's 
hell, has abandoned the Stags.

But, fear not my mortals of the Mansfield persuasion, for as Luton 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jan/05/luton-wolverhampton-wanderers-fa-cup>
 andOldham 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jan/05/nottingham-forest-oldham-athletic-fa-cup>
 andMaccelsfield 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jan/05/macclesfield-town-cardiff-city-fa-cup>
 showed in glorious technicolor yesterday, the FA Cup is not no normal walk of 
life, oh no. And so, despite those 93-odd places, despite those millions of 
pounds, despite the lack of tribal dance noise coming from the Mansfield area, 
this match could be like David and Goliath, only this time David wins.

Mansfield have been in fairly decent form recently – they have lost just one 
game in their last 12 in all competitions; the other 11 consisted of five wins 
and six draws. But then again, Liverpool have been none too shabby of late as 
well. Discounting those blips againstAston Villa 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/16/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-report>
 andStoke 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/26/stoke-city-liverpool-premier-league-report>
, Brendan Rodgers' side won their last six games in all competitions, scoring 
15 and conceding a measly two. Both sides also come into the game following 
free-scoring victories – Mansfield doing one over the giants Alfreton Town, 
Liverpool doing one over the giants of Sunderland – but only one of these sides 
come into this game feeling anything amounting to pressure. That's why Big 
Brendan is taking this game so seriously.

"We have prepared exactly the same for Mansfield as we would Manchester 
United," he said. In fact, Rodgers is going to take this game so seriously that 
he is expected to let Brad Jones bring his 1980s movie-star good looks to the 
Liverpool net in place of Pepe Reina as well as allowing his reserve players 
like Steven Gerrard, Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel to put their feet up on the 
table and watch the game with a bag of Mega Monster Munch Flamin' Hot in hand 
while the real stars like Jamie Carragher and Sebastián Coates and Stewart 
Downing do some running around.

Speaking of taking things seriously, the Mansfield manager, Paul Cox, has 
quite the incentive towards victory today. He done got hitched on Friday (the 
reception was at Mansfield's Stadium – who says love is dead, eh?) and a 
certain 
not-to-be-named-because-all-they-want-is-publicity-betting-company-and-no-it's-not-the-one-you-are-thinking-of 
have promised to whisk foxy Coxy and his blushing bride away to a sun-blessed 
beach if a 4th-round spot is forthcoming for his side. It's been 44 years since 
the Stags took out a top-flight club from this competition but if his Cox's 
goalkeeper Alan Marriott, can pull off somethinglike this once again 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Pnpgyg9yNuU>, his 
manager may be feeling that sun soon enough.

As soon as the team news comes in, I'll let you know.
