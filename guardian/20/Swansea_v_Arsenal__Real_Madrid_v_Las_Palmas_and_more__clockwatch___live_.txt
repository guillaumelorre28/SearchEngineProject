And that’s that on the day Jamie Vardy scored in his eighth consecutive 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> match, 
Arsenal scored their 2,000th goal under Arsene Wenger, Jurgen Klopp registered 
his first league victory in English football, and Jose Mourinho answered 13 
questions in 54 seconds with 57 words. Breathless stuff.

Meanwhile you might have thought I’d forgotten about Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> and Las Palmas. Well, I did, 
yes, but no matter! The last we heard, it was 3-1 to the home side at 
half-time, and that’s exactly how it finished. Clockwatch: always in control, 
even when we’re not.

Kolarov misses a last-minute penalty for Manchester City! But it matters not, 
because it’s the last kick of the game. Here are the final Premier League 
scores, then. City stay top, but only just. Arsenal remain on their heels with 
a fine victory at Swansea. Leicester go third after a thriller at the 
Hawthorns, Jamie Vardy scoring for the eighthPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> game in a row. A third 
successive 0-0 for Manchester United, who were second best at Palace, but stay 
in fourth. And Watford see off West Ham, who won at Arsenal, Liverpool and Man 
City, but can’t do it at Vicarage Road!

Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United
Manchester City 2-1 Norwich City
Newcastle United 0-0 Stoke City
Swansea City 0-3 Arsenal
Watford 2-0 West Ham United
West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City

Hearts are going second in Scotland in style. A fourth goal for them at 
Partick Thistle, Osman Sow with an 86th-minute penalty. Meanwhile Yannick 
Bolasie has just flashed a header over the Manchester United bar from close 
range. Palace have been the better side at Selhurst, but it looks like United 
are going to deny them.

RED CARD! Russell Martin (Norwich City, 88)

A fine save by Martin to deny a fine Raheem Sterling shot. Problem is, he’s

Yohan Cabaye has just missed a sitter for Palace against Manchester United. 
Albert Adomah has made it two for Boro against Charlton. And Michael O’Halloran 
has made it four for St Johnstone at Hamilton. Meanwhile upwardly mobile 
Sheffield Wednesday have taken the lead against Nottingham Forest, Fernando 
Forestieri their hero there. A quiet first half, but the goals are flying in 
now.

GOAL! West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Leicester City (Mahrez 63)

Comeback experts Leicester certainly are at it again! Though there are shades 
of offside as Riyad Mahrez scores his second of the afternoon.

Ah, hold on, a chance for West Ham. No, ball-playing defender Andy ‘Franz’ 
Carroll has shinned it wide from 12 yards. It doesn’t look like being the big 
man’s day.

Watford are raining shots in on the West Ham goal. It’s still only 2-0, but 
the Hammers don’t have an answer at the moment. The Hornets gaveArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> a good run for their money a 
couple of weeks ago, before being overrun late in that particular match. The 
0-3 scoreline that day wasn’t representative of their performance, more of 
Arsenal’s quality in depth. Seems like they’re getting more of the breaks today.

Rory Loy has given Dundee the lead at Inverness Caley Thistle on 50 minutes. 
It’s been a miserable 60 seconds for the Highlanders, who saw David Raven sent 
off for cynically bringing down the last man just beforehand. The Caley Jags 
have certainly taken their foot off the gas since winning that Scottish Cup in 
May. They can be thankful for the early season struggles of Dundee United. 
Meanwhile Osman Sow has scored a second for Hearts at Partick Thistle. They’ll 
be going second tonight, providing they don’t let that lead slip.

GOAL! Watford 2-0 West Ham United (Ighalo 48)

Odion Ighalo has just met a left-wing cross first time, wheeching a fine shot 
home from the edge of the box. West Ham have won at Arsenal, Liverpool and
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, but look 
like going down to the newly promoted Hornets. Football, huh?

The half-times in Scotland. Featuring two strikes not previously mentioned: 
Graham Cummins giving St Johnstone a 40th-minute lead at Hamilton Academical, 
Juanma doing the same for Hearts on 38 at Partick. If Hearts hold onto their 
lead, they’ll leapfrog the pile of rubble that once was title-chasing Aberdeen 
into second place.

Celtic 3-1 Aberdeen (FT)
Simon McMahon’s Dundee United 0-0 Ross County
Hamilton Accies 0-1 St Johnstone
Caley Thistle 0-0 Dundee
Killie 0-0 Motherwell
Partick Thistle 0-1 Hearts

More injury woe for Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>? 
Too early to tell, perhaps. But Olivier Giroud is down getting treatment on a 
sore knee at Swansea. Meanwhile another goal for promotion-chasing Burnley, and 
another for Andre Gray: they’re 2-0 up at home to Huddersfield. Fulham are now 
four goals to the good at Bristol City, Ross McCormack and Ryan Tunnicliffe 
adding to the earlier Moussa Dembélé double.

And hats off to Jeff Stelling on Sky Sports, too. He’s just praised the 
Middlesbrough fans for their midweek torchlight solidarity for the Teesside 
steelworkers who have lost their jobs, going out of his way to bollock the 
government for their ideological intransigence. “If only they could see the 
light too, then everyone would be happy.” Preach on, brother.

Here’s the latest from Tannadice, courtesy of Simon McMahon. “No goals so far, 
but Dundee United have started very brightly against Ross County. So, expect 
the men from Dingwall to be leading by half-time.” No goals anywhere else in 
the Scottish top flight either. Well isn’t this quite the scene. All hail the 
swashbuckling stylings of Tony Pulis.

GOAL! West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Leicester City (Rondon 28)

A glancing header by Jose Salomon Rondon, and as things stand West Brom - who 
don’t score many, but don’t concede that often either - will be safely 
ensconced in the top half of the table.

Norwich have got back into the game at Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, thanks in part to some 
Wilfried Bony profligacy. He’s missed a couple of chances, and Matt Jarvis has 
gone down the other end and pinged a rising pearler towards the City goal. Joe 
Hart broke his heart with a spectacular save. Still no goals in the top t... ah 
hold on!

It had been a quiet start at the Liberty Stadium between Swansea and in-form 
(in thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> 
anyway) Arsenal, but the home side should be leading. Bafetimbi Gomis has just 
been put through on goal by Jonjo Shelvey, but spurned the chance after a lot 
of fussing and faffing. Still no goals in the top tier.

Cristiano Ronaldo has made it two for Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> against Las Palmas. Just the 
14 minutes gone there. Plenty of time for five more, and we’d be one vowel away 
from a Madness earworm.

In the Championship, there’s an early goal for in-form Burnley at 
Huddersfield, Andre Gray converting a 12th-minute penalty, a spot kick he’d 
earned himself. Andreas Weimann has given Derby County a seventh-minute lead 
against Rotherham United. And Moussa Dembele’s second-minute goal has put 
Fulham ahead at Bristol City. Other than that, nothing to say right now. 
Nothing to say. No. No. Nothing at all. Nothing to say.

Isco has given Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
an early lead against Las Palmas. The Spanish league leaders are 1-0 up after 
four minutes. The ball’s hit Andy Carroll on the arm in the West Ham box at 
Watford, but the hosts are getting nix. Manchester United meanwhile are living 
dangerously against Crystal Palace, Yannick Bolasie having sent a strange 
bouncing bomb onto the visitors’ bar, Wilfried Zaha and Scott Dann both going 
close as well.

started like a train against Norwich City; they’re well on top in the early 
stages. Meanwhile Jamie Vardy has been bothering theWest Bromwich Albion

no goals in the Premier League 3pm kick-offs to report as of yet.

So here’s Jose Mourinho’s post-match interview on BT Sport. Word for word.

Jose. A 3-1 defeat after a fabulous start, the game just got away from you 
there.
I have nothing, nothing to say.
Nothing to say about the game at all?
Nothing, nothing, I have nothing to say.
Nothing to say about the Lucas decision that left him on the pitch?
Nothing to say. I have nothing to say.
The Costa clash?
Nothing to say. I’m so sorry I have nothing to say.
Do you not think it’s time to have a chat to the fans, to give them some 
message, some indication of your thinking?
The fans are not stupid.
We heard them chanting your name.
The fans are not stupid.
You did say before this game that you weren’t worried. Are you a little bit 
more worried now?
No. [Pause. Narrows eyes.] Worried about what?
Your future, your own position at the club, the backing of the board?
No. No. 
Nothing about the game at all?
At all.
No individual performance you’d like to pick out?
No.
Nothing about the performance going ahead?
Nothing.
Nothing about the way we could fix it?
[Smiles ruefully] I cannot say.
Thank you for your time, Jose.
Thank you.

After Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat at home to Southampton, he took seven minutes to 
answer one question. This time he used 57 words to answer 13 questions in 54 
seconds. You’ve changed, Jose.

Full time at Stamford Bridge: Chelsea 1-3 Liverpool. Like a pint of plain, 
Barry Glendenning is your only man. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/oct/31/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live>
 But at this rate, with Chelsea making Leeds 1993 and Blackburn 1996 look like 
Manchester United circa 2000, how long will Jose be Chelsea’s? A lot of smiling 
is being done by Jurgen Klopp right now, though he was at studious pains to 
keep a respectfully grim look on his coupon as he shook Mourinho’s hand on the 
final whistle. The Chelsea manager scuttled off down the tunnel at great speed, 
but then he always does that. You may be hearing quite a lot about Mourinho and 
Chelsea in the next few hours and days. Keep ‘em peeled.

Wolves have closed out their 2-0 win at St Andrews. They spring into the top 
half of the table, for now at least, while Birmingham’s opportunity to grab 
second place for themselves for a wee while is gone. Meanwhile here’s our north 
of London correspondent Simon McMahon, with some early news from That Scotland. 
“On my way to Tannadice to see United play Ross County,” he reports. “Actually, 
I’m in the pub. You need a stiffener before watching United these days. A word 
too, for Cowdenbeath-Dunfermline in Scottish League One. There’ll not be many 
half and half scarves being sold before that one, I’ll wager.”

It’s now 3-1 to Liverpool at Chelsea.

Christian Benteke stood with the ball at his feet in the Chelsea box for over 
four minutes. Nobody bothered to make a challenge, and so eventually he swept 
the ball into the bottom left. Jurgen Klopp performed a series of jumps and 
skips with some air punches thrown in. Meanwhile at Parkhead, Adam Rooney pulls 
a goal back for Aberdeen in the 89th minute, but it’s too little, too late. 
That’s a 3-1 win for Celtic, who are now seven points clear of the Dons at the 
top of the Scottish Premiership. That’s five defeats and a draw for Aberdeen in 
their last six games. There’s a title challenge that petered out without too 
much fanfare.

The majority of the games are, of course, kicking off at 3pm. But there’s 
already action elsewhere. Celtic are 3-0 up at home to August-to-September 
sensations Aberdeen: Leigh Griffiths (2) and James Forrest the Parkhead heroes 
there. Wolverhampton Wanderers are very close to closing out a 2-0 victory at 
Birmingham City: Dave Edwards and Sheyi Ojo have done the damage there. And at 
Stamford Bridge, Liverpool are 13 minutes away from their first away victory 
against Chelsea since 2011. Phillipe Coutinho has scored twice to wipe out an 
early Ramires goal. You’ll need to head over to Barry Glendenning’s MBM for the 
detailed report on that.

Good afternoon!

Welcome to a super special Super Saturday of Saturday football! 
Traditionalists rejoice, because the afternoon fixtures today have a lovely, 
classic, old-school feel to them. Kicking off at the traditional time of 3pm on 
Saturday, the top five of the Premier League: Manchester City, Arsenal,West Ham 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited>, Manchester United 
and Leicester City. Throw in seventh-placed Crystal Palace, and it really will 
be all happening at the business end of the English league. Admittedly the 
biggest match of the weekend kicked off at the resolutely non-traditional time 
of 12.45pm, but you can’t have everything, and nobody’s bringing us down from 
this high anyway. Here’s what’s going on in the big-boy division, then ...

Crystal Palace v Manchester United
 Manchester City v Norwich City
 Newcastle United v Stoke City
 Swansea City v Arsenal
 Watford v West Ham United
West Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> v 
Leicester City

The match between Chelsea and Liverpool is reaching its heady denouement right 
about now.Go over here to find out what’s going on: Jose Mourinho, Jurgen 
Klopp, Barry Glendenning, it couldn’t be more star-studded if we’d somehow 
managed to resurrect Bob Hope and Lucille Ball. Don’t forget to come back here 
once it’s done, y’all.

In your actual Championship, this is what’s going on:

Bristol City v Fulham
 Burnley v Huddersfield Town
 Derby County v Rotherham United
 Ipswich Town v Cardiff City
 Impatient Disrespectful Usurpers v Hull City
 Middlesbrough v Charlton Athletic
 Reading v Brighton and Hove Albion
 Sheffield Wednesday v Nottingham Forest
 Preston North End v Bolton Wanderers

Birmingham City’s set-to with Wolverhampton Wanderers is being played out now, 
as is the stramash in Scotland between Celtic and Aberdeen, so there’ll be news 
of those results anon, if not sooner.Here’s the rest of the card north of the 
border:

Dundee United v Ross County
 Hamilton Academical v St Johnstone
 Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Dundee
 Kilmarnock v Motherwell
 Partick Thistle v Heart of Midlothian

And we’ll keep you up to date, in an easy-going swing-band rhythm, no 
promises, of what’s going on across Europe, where Spanish leadersReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are playing and German 
leaders Bayern Munich are not.Oh we’ve got it all going on. And on a glorious 
old-school Saturday, there’s only one way to get the ball rolling: ladies and 
gentlemen, Mr Keith Mansfield...

And that’s that on the day Jamie Vardy scored in his eighth consecutive 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> match, 
Arsenal scored their 2,000th goal under Arsene Wenger, Jurgen Klopp registered 
his first league victory in English football, and Jose Mourinho answered 13 
questions in 54 seconds with 57 words. Breathless stuff.

And in Scotland ...

Celtic 3-1 Aberdeen
Dundee United 1-0 Ross County
Hamilton Academical 2-4 St Johnstone
Inverness Caledonian Thistle 1-1 Dundee
Kilmarnock 0-1 Motherwell
Partick Thistle 0-4 Heart of Midlothian

“Hampden May 2010 it was not,” reports Dundee United’s Simon McMahon, “but 
I’ll take it.”

 
The Championship results for you:

Birmingham City 0-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers
Bristol City 1-4 Fulham
Burnley 2-1 Huddersfield Town
Derby County 3-0 Rotherham United
Ipswich Town 0-0 Cardiff City
Middlesbrough 3-0 Charlton Athletic
Rude Usurpers 0-2 Hull City
Reading 1-1 Brighton & Hove Albion
Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 Nottingham Forest
 
Meanwhile you might have thought I’d forgotten about Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> and Las Palmas. Well, I did, 
yes, but no matter! The last we heard, it was 3-1 to the home side at 
half-time, and that’s exactly how it finished. Clockwatch: always in control, 
even when we’re not.
 
Kolarov misses a last-minute penalty for Manchester City! But it matters not, 
because it’s the last kick of the game. Here are the final Premier League 
scores, then. City stay top, but only just. Arsenal remain on their heels with 
a fine victory at Swansea. Leicester go third after a thriller at the 
Hawthorns, Jamie Vardy scoring for the eighthPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> game in a row. A third 
successive 0-0 for Manchester United, who were second best at Palace, but stay 
in fourth. And Watford see off West Ham, who won at Arsenal, Liverpool and Man 
City, but can’t do it at Vicarage Road!

Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United
Manchester City 2-1 Norwich City
Newcastle United 0-0 Stoke City
Swansea City 0-3 Arsenal
Watford 2-0 West Ham United
West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity>
 
A late winner for stuggling Motherwell at Kilmarnock. Louis Moult has scored 
on 87. A Billy Mckay penalty on 81 minutes has given bottom club Dundee United 
the lead.
 
Hearts are going second in Scotland in style. A fourth goal for them at 
Partick Thistle, Osman Sow with an 86th-minute penalty. Meanwhile Yannick 
Bolasie has just flashed a header over the Manchester United bar from close 
range. Palace have been the better side at Selhurst, but it looks like United 
are going to deny them.
 
Yaya Toure slams the ball past John Ruddy, who is no Russell Martin. City will 
stay at the top of the table tonight after all.
 
A fine save by Martin to deny a fine Raheem Sterling shot. Problem is, he’s 
not the keeper. Bye bye!

The former Southampton striker scores his first goal for the Baggies from the 
spot. Are West Brom going to come back themselves? Is the biter about to be 
bitten?
 
Joe Hart, on his own line, drops a common-or-garden high ball, allowing 
Cameron Jerome to tap in. It’s an awful howler, andArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are going top as things stand.
 
So as things stand, Leicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> are going third. This sort 
of carry-on hasn’t been witnessed since the days of Matt Gillies. You have to
love football.
 
Eleven for the season. Seven in his last six. A goal in eight consecutive 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> games. That 
Jamie Vardy, huh?
 
Joel Campbell, in his 15th game for Arsenal, scores his first goal for the 
club, on the end of a lovely team move. This is over, andArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are the form horse in this 
division.
 
Yohan Cabaye has just missed a sitter for Palace against Manchester United. 
Albert Adomah has made it two for Boro against Charlton. And Michael O’Halloran 
has made it four for St Johnstone at Hamilton. Meanwhile upwardly mobile 
Sheffield Wednesday have taken the lead against Nottingham Forest, Fernando 
Forestieri their hero there. A quiet first half, but the goals are flying in 
now.
 
That should be that at the Liberty, though it’s a controversial one, Giroud 
having clattered into formerArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> keeper Lukasz Fabianski during 
the build up.
 
Against the run of play, Nicolás Otamendi has powered in a header to give the 
league leaders the advantage at the Etihad.
 
Juanma has grabbed his second of the day, and Hearts’ third, at Partick 
Thistle.They’ll be going second tonight. It’s now 3-0 to St Johnstone at 
Hamilton. Graham Cummins with the second after 49 minutes, David Wotherspoon 
making the result certain on 63. Greg Tansey has equalised for Inverness CT 
against Dundee, from the spot after 64 minutes. Meanwhile south of the border, 
in the Championship, David Nugent has scored the opener for Middlesbrough 
against Charlton, on the hour.
 
Comeback experts Leicester certainly are at it again! Though there are shades 
of offside as Riyad Mahrez scores his second of the afternoon.
 
Ah, hold on, a chance for West Ham. No, ball-playing defender Andy ‘Franz’ 
Carroll has shinned it wide from 12 yards. It doesn’t look like being the big 
man’s day.
 
Watford are raining shots in on the West Ham goal. It’s still only 2-0, but 
the Hammers don’t have an answer at the moment. The Hornets gaveArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> a good run for their money a 
couple of weeks ago, before being overrun late in that particular match. The 
0-3 scoreline that day wasn’t representative of their performance, more of 
Arsenal’s quality in depth. Seems like they’re getting more of the breaks today.
 
A seventh goal of the season for Riyad Mahrez and Leicester, who are never 
happier when they’re coming at teams from a losing position, appear to be at it 
again.
 
Championship leaders Brighton have taken the lead at Reading. Jamie Murphy 
with the opener just off junction 11 of the M4.
 
Rory Loy has given Dundee the lead at Inverness Caley Thistle on 50 minutes. 
It’s been a miserable 60 seconds for the Highlanders, who saw David Raven sent 
off for cynically bringing down the last man just beforehand. The Caley Jags 
have certainly taken their foot off the gas since winning that Scottish Cup in 
May. They can be thankful for the early season struggles of Dundee United. 
Meanwhile Osman Sow has scored a second for Hearts at Partick Thistle. They’ll 
be going second tonight, providing they don’t let that lead slip.

Olivier Giroud converts from a Mesut Ozil corner, and that’s 2,000 goals 
scored byArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> under the 
living legend Arsene Wenger! His knee presumably standing up, then.
 
Odion Ighalo has just met a left-wing cross first time, wheeching a fine shot 
home from the edge of the box. West Ham have won at Arsenal, Liverpool and
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, but look 
like going down to the newly promoted Hornets. Football, huh?
 
The second halves will be getting underway across the country. But of course 
the biggest football match of the day is in another code. Just in case you’ve 
forgotten, our man Dan Lucas is covering the Rugby World Cup Final between 
Scotland Australia and New Zealand. It starts about now.

The half-times in Scotland. Featuring two strikes not previously mentioned: 
Graham Cummins giving St Johnstone a 40th-minute lead at Hamilton Academical, 
Juanma doing the same for Hearts on 38 at Partick. If Hearts hold onto their 
lead, they’ll leapfrog the pile of rubble that once was title-chasing Aberdeen 
into second place.

Celtic 3-1 Aberdeen (FT)
Simon McMahon’s Dundee United 0-0 Ross County
Hamilton Accies 0-1 St Johnstone
Caley Thistle 0-0 Dundee
Killie 0-0 Motherwell
Partick Thistle 0-1 Hearts
 
Santana Trujillo pulled a goal back for Las Palmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laspalmas> at the Bernabeu on 38 minutes, 
but Jesé restored Real Madrid’s two-goal cushion just before the break. t’s 3-1 
to Rafa Benitez’s attack-minded [subs, please check] side at half time.
 
And so here are the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> half-times:

Chelsea 1-3 Liverpool (FT)
Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United
Manchester City 0-0 Norwich City
Newcastle United 0-0 Stoke City
Swansea City 0-0 Arsenal
Watford 1-0 West Ham United
West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Leicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity>
 
More injury woe for Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>? 
Too early to tell, perhaps. But Olivier Giroud is down getting treatment on a 
sore knee at Swansea. Meanwhile another goal for promotion-chasing Burnley, and 
another for Andre Gray: they’re 2-0 up at home to Huddersfield. Fulham are now 
four goals to the good at Bristol City, Ross McCormack and Ryan Tunnicliffe 
adding to the earlier Moussa Dembélé double.

Andy Carroll has just attempted a Cruyff Turn inside his own area. The result? 
You know the result. Odion Ighalo taps home amid the resulting mayhem. Oh Andy!
 
And hats off to Jeff Stelling on Sky Sports, too. He’s just praised the 
Middlesbrough fans for their midweek torchlight solidarity for the Teesside 
steelworkers who have lost their jobs, going out of his way to bollock the 
government for their ideological intransigence. “If only they could see the 
light too, then everyone would be happy.” Preach on, brother.

Here’s the latest from Tannadice, courtesy of Simon McMahon. “No goals so far, 
but Dundee United have started very brightly against Ross County. So, expect 
the men from Dingwall to be leading by half-time.” No goals anywhere else in 
the Scottish top flight either. Well isn’t this quite the scene. All hail the 
swashbuckling stylings of Tony Pulis.

 
A glancing header by Jose Salomon Rondon, and as things stand West Brom - who 
don’t score many, but don’t concede that often either - will be safely 
ensconced in the top half of the table.
 
Norwich have got back into the game at Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, thanks in part to some 
Wilfried Bony profligacy. He’s missed a couple of chances, and Matt Jarvis has 
gone down the other end and pinged a rising pearler towards the City goal. Joe 
Hart broke his heart with a spectacular save. Still no goals in the top t... ah 
hold on!
 
It had been a quiet start at the Liberty Stadium between Swansea and in-form 
(in thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> 
anyway) Arsenal, but the home side should be leading. Bafetimbi Gomis has just 
been put through on goal by Jonjo Shelvey, but spurned the chance after a lot 
of fussing and faffing. Still no goals in the top tier.
 
Hull City, currently second in the Championship, are looking to consolidate 
their position.Ahmed Elmohamady has opened the scoring against the Impatient 
Disrespectful Usurpers. A second goal of the day meanwhile for both Fulham and 
Moussa Dembele; the Cottagers are 2-0 up against Bristol City at Ashton Gate.

 
Cristiano Ronaldo has made it two for Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> against Las Palmas. Just the 
14 minutes gone there. Plenty of time for five more, and we’d be one vowel away 
from a Madness earworm.

against Las Palmas. Photograph: Ballesteros/EPA  
In the Championship, there’s an early goal for in-form Burnley at 
Huddersfield, Andre Gray converting a 12th-minute penalty, a spot kick he’d 
earned himself. Andreas Weimann has given Derby County a seventh-minute lead 
against Rotherham United. And Moussa Dembele’s second-minute goal has put 
Fulham ahead at Bristol City. Other than that, nothing to say right now. 
Nothing to say. No. No. Nothing at all. Nothing to say.
 
Isco has given Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
an early lead against Las Palmas. The Spanish league leaders are 1-0 up after 
four minutes. The ball’s hit Andy Carroll on the arm in the West Ham box at 
Watford, but the hosts are getting nix. Manchester United meanwhile are living 
dangerously against Crystal Palace, Yannick Bolasie having sent a strange 
bouncing bomb onto the visitors’ bar, Wilfried Zaha and Scott Dann both going 
close as well.
 
The Premier League form boys just keep on keepin’ on. Manchester City have 
started like a train against Norwich City; they’re well on top in the early 
stages. Meanwhile Jamie Vardy has been bothering theWest Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> woodwork at the Hawthorns. But 
no goals in the Premier League 3pm kick-offs to report as of yet.
 
By the way, if you want minute-by-minute action from Selhurst Park - and who 
wouldn’t? - Tim Hill is all over the big Palace-United clash. He’s just a click 
away.

Dwight Gayle has gone close early doors for Crystal Palace against Manchester 
United.It’s the first meaningful act of the day in the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, outside the Stamford 
Bridge media room, that is. All the games have kicked off, then.

 
So here’s Jose Mourinho’s post-match interview on BT Sport. Word for word.

Jose. A 3-1 defeat after a fabulous start, the game just got away from you 
there.
I have nothing, nothing to say.
Nothing to say about the game at all?
Nothing, nothing, I have nothing to say.
Nothing to say about the Lucas decision that left him on the pitch?
Nothing to say. I have nothing to say.
The Costa clash?
Nothing to say. I’m so sorry I have nothing to say.
Do you not think it’s time to have a chat to the fans, to give them some 
message, some indication of your thinking?
The fans are not stupid.
We heard them chanting your name.
The fans are not stupid.
You did say before this game that you weren’t worried. Are you a little bit 
more worried now?
No. [Pause. Narrows eyes.] Worried about what?
Your future, your own position at the club, the backing of the board?
No. No. 
Nothing about the game at all?
At all.
No individual performance you’d like to pick out?
No.
Nothing about the performance going ahead?
Nothing.
Nothing about the way we could fix it?
[Smiles ruefully] I cannot say.
Thank you for your time, Jose.
Thank you.

After Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat at home to Southampton, he took seven minutes to 
answer one question. This time he used 57 words to answer 13 questions in 54 
seconds. You’ve changed, Jose.
 
Full time at Stamford Bridge: Chelsea 1-3 Liverpool. Like a pint of plain, 
Barry Glendenning is your only man. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/oct/31/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live>
 But at this rate, with Chelsea making Leeds 1993 and Blackburn 1996 look like 
Manchester United circa 2000, how long will Jose be Chelsea’s? A lot of smiling 
is being done by Jurgen Klopp right now, though he was at studious pains to 
keep a respectfully grim look on his coupon as he shook Mourinho’s hand on the 
final whistle. The Chelsea manager scuttled off down the tunnel at great speed, 
but then he always does that. You may be hearing quite a lot about Mourinho and 
Chelsea in the next few hours and days. Keep ‘em peeled.

match at Stamford Bridge. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images  
Wolves have closed out their 2-0 win at St Andrews. They spring into the top 
half of the table, for now at least, while Birmingham’s opportunity to grab 
second place for themselves for a wee while is gone. Meanwhile here’s our north 
of London correspondent Simon McMahon, with some early news from That Scotland. 
“On my way to Tannadice to see United play Ross County,” he reports. “Actually, 
I’m in the pub. You need a stiffener before watching United these days. A word 
too, for Cowdenbeath-Dunfermline in Scottish League One. There’ll not be many 
half and half scarves being sold before that one, I’ll wager.”
 
It’s now 3-1 to Liverpool at Chelsea.

Sibley/Reuters 
Christian Benteke stood with the ball at his feet in the Chelsea box for over 
four minutes. Nobody bothered to make a challenge, and so eventually he swept 
the ball into the bottom left. Jurgen Klopp performed a series of jumps and 
skips with some air punches thrown in. Meanwhile at Parkhead, Adam Rooney pulls 
a goal back for Aberdeen in the 89th minute, but it’s too little, too late. 
That’s a 3-1 win for Celtic, who are now seven points clear of the Dons at the 
top of the Scottish Premiership. That’s five defeats and a draw for Aberdeen in 
their last six games. There’s a title challenge that petered out without too 
much fanfare.

Watson/PA 
The majority of the games are, of course, kicking off at 3pm. But there’s 
already action elsewhere. Celtic are 3-0 up at home to August-to-September 
sensations Aberdeen: Leigh Griffiths (2) and James Forrest the Parkhead heroes 
there. Wolverhampton Wanderers are very close to closing out a 2-0 victory at 
Birmingham City: Dave Edwards and Sheyi Ojo have done the damage there. And at 
Stamford Bridge, Liverpool are 13 minutes away from their first away victory 
against Chelsea since 2011. Phillipe Coutinho has scored twice to wipe out an 
early Ramires goal. You’ll need to head over to Barry Glendenning’s MBM for the 
detailed report on that.

Welcome to a super special Super Saturday of Saturday football! 
Traditionalists rejoice, because the afternoon fixtures today have a lovely, 
classic, old-school feel to them. Kicking off at the traditional time of 3pm on 
Saturday, the top five of the Premier League: Manchester City, Arsenal,West Ham 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited>, Manchester United 
and Leicester City. Throw in seventh-placed Crystal Palace, and it really will 
be all happening at the business end of the English league. Admittedly the 
biggest match of the weekend kicked off at the resolutely non-traditional time 
of 12.45pm, but you can’t have everything, and nobody’s bringing us down from 
this high anyway. Here’s what’s going on in the big-boy division, then ...

Crystal Palace v Manchester United
 Manchester City v Norwich City
 Newcastle United v Stoke City
 Swansea City v Arsenal
 Watford v West Ham United
West Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> v 
Leicester City

The match between Chelsea and Liverpool is reaching its heady denouement right 
about now.Go over here to find out what’s going on: Jose Mourinho, Jurgen 
Klopp, Barry Glendenning, it couldn’t be more star-studded if we’d somehow 
managed to resurrect Bob Hope and Lucille Ball. Don’t forget to come back here 
once it’s done, y’all.

In your actual Championship, this is what’s going on:

Bristol City v Fulham
 Burnley v Huddersfield Town
 Derby County v Rotherham United
 Ipswich Town v Cardiff City
 Impatient Disrespectful Usurpers v Hull City
 Middlesbrough v Charlton Athletic
 Reading v Brighton and Hove Albion
 Sheffield Wednesday v Nottingham Forest
 Preston North End v Bolton Wanderers

Birmingham City’s set-to with Wolverhampton Wanderers is being played out now, 
as is the stramash in Scotland between Celtic and Aberdeen, so there’ll be news 
of those results anon, if not sooner.Here’s the rest of the card north of the 
border:

Dundee United v Ross County
 Hamilton Academical v St Johnstone
 Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Dundee
 Kilmarnock v Motherwell
 Partick Thistle v Heart of Midlothian

And we’ll keep you up to date, in an easy-going swing-band rhythm, no 
promises, of what’s going on across Europe, where Spanish leadersReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are playing and German 
leaders Bayern Munich are not.Oh we’ve got it all going on. And on a glorious 
old-school Saturday, there’s only one way to get the ball rolling: ladies and 
gentlemen, Mr Keith Mansfield...
