Forget Brexit, or the correct way to dress a scone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/apr/22/how-to-make-perfect-scones>
 – there’s no quicker way to judge a person’s quality than to offer them a fig 
roll. The lesser individual is inclined to wrinkle their nose, much as if 
they’d been presented with a poo on a stick, while the sound fellow will 
exclaim, through a shower of buttery crumbs, “Oh, but I love fig rolls!”

While dry, bitter American cookies 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7376123.stm> go from strength to strength, 
this deliciously sticky, crumbly pastry is becoming an increasingly niche 
taste. I can only surmise that themass-produced variety 
<http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com/biscuits/fig/> has put people off – if 
so, consider this recipe my personal crusade to convert the world.

Pastry

The pastry used in commercial fig rolls is little more than a dry, crumbly 
casing you have to chew through to get to the sweet, jammy filling – the 
biscuit equivalent of the sandwiches at a birthday tea party. Make your own, 
and you can give it equal billing.

The recipes I try go down two different routes: those that deploy a rich, 
sweet buttery shortcrust – such asRosemary Shrager’s Bakes, Cakes & Puddings 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rosemary-Shragers-Bakes-Cakes-Puddings-Shrager-ebook/dp/B00JV1W282?ie=UTF8&btkr=1&ref_=dp-kindle-redirect>
 andPeyton and Byrne’s British Baking 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/British-Baking-Oliver-Peyton-ebook/dp/B007TNQWEE?ie=UTF8&btkr=1&ref_=dp-kindle-redirect>
 – and the ones fromRuby Tandoh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/02/fig-roll-lemon-drizzle-cake-recipe-ruby-tandoh-pepper>
, Good Food’s Barney Desmazery 
<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/sticky-toffee-fig-rolls> and the Little 
Loaf blog, 
<http://www.thelittleloaf.com/2013/12/11/festive-fig-rolls-with-orange-honey-cinnamon/>
 which dial back the sugar and add wholemeal flour to create something 
altogether more suited to the fig’s healthy reputation. While I put away a fair 
few of both, I prefer the contrast between the plainer pastries, particularly 
Tandoh’s, and the sugary filling.

The Little Loaf and Peyton and Byrne both add ground almonds as well as flour, 
but although nuts work well with the flavour of the fruit, I think they make 
the pastry too soft. My version is designed to act as a crisp, almost savoury 
contrast to the delights within – so I’ll be leaving out Peyton and Byrne’s 
spices and citrus zest, but keeping Tandoh’s baking powder for maximum 
lightness.

Note that wholemeal flours in particular seem to vary wildly in the amount of 
liquid they’ll soak up, which makes some of the pastries I try very difficult 
to work with, so use your own judgement as to how much milk to add to bring it 
together into a coherent dough.

The fruit

Desmazery, the Little Loaf and Peyton and Byrne all use soft dried figs, while 
Tandoh and Shrager prefer the cheaper, chewier dried variety, either soaked 
with bicarbonate of soda or boiled to soften them. Price apart, I’m not sure it 
makes much difference which you go for; the dried sort will just take a bit 
longer to prepare, but I do think boiling the filling until it dissolves into a 
kind of chutney, as Desmazery, Shrager and Peyton and Byrne suggest, is a 
worthwhile step. The flavours are more intense, and the consistency more 
uniform, than in those that simply mash the fruits together. (I would not, 
however, advise blitzing it to smithereens in a food processor – the Peyton and 
Byrne recipe proves the death of mine.)

Shrager adds currants and crystallised ginger to her figs, and the Little Loaf 
adds Medjool dates and grated apple – and the results are, as anyone who’s ever 
eaten a mince pie might predict, quite lovely. I’m a fig roll purist, though, 
and figs are the only fruit for me here. Inspired by the nutty pastries, 
however, I’ve decided to throw a few chopped almonds into the filling, instead, 
for both flavour and texture, but feel free to substitute another nut or dried 
fruit, if you prefer.

Flavouring

Citrus juice and zest supplies acidity and bitterness to help balance the 
sweetness of the fruit, and Tandoh and Peyton and Byrne’s lemon does this more 
effectively than the orange juice the others put in. A hint of sweet, aromatic 
mixed spice is more popular with my testers than Tandoh’s more innovative 
vanilla and black pepper – which proves my theory that, when it comes to 
childhood treats, we’re all little conservatives at heart.

Sweet as the figs are, they need a bit of extra sugar to make the leap from 
sticky to properly jammy. The Little Loaf uses honey, Tandoh soft light-brown 
sugar, and Peyton and Byrne, Shrager and Desmazery use caster sugar, with the 
last also throwing in a few chopped toffees for good measure, giving the 
filling a wonderful caramel flavour. I find they have a tendency to leak out of 
the pastry in a molten sea, however, so I’m going to substitute dark muscovado, 
whose subtle liquorice notes offer more than one-dimensional sweetness.

Finishing

Glazing the fig rolls with egg and sprinkling with sugar, as the Little Loaf 
recommends, helps to give the top of the pastry a bit of crunch, as well as 
providing aesthetic support. I’d suggest cutting the rolls before baking, 
rather than afterwards, as Desmazery suggests – unless you have a very steady 
hand, the pastry has a tendency to crumble once cooked. Size wise, the ideal 
falls somewhere between Shrager’s greedily generous 6cm widths and Peyton and 
Byrne’s slimline 3cm versions (which, I might add, bear little resemblance to 
the delicious monsters sold at their eponymous chain of cafes).

Happily, fig rolls keep well – a week in an airtight container and still going 
strong, though, unless you also make them six batches at a time, I suspect 
you’re unlikely to have reason to test this out.

Whisk together the flours, baking powder, sugar and a pinch of fine salt in a 
large bowl or food processor, then rub in the butter to make crumbs. Mix in the 
egg yolk and just enough milk to bring it together into a coherent dough, then 
form into a rough rectangle, wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, put the figs into a small saucepan with 4 tbsp water, the lemon 
juice and zest, sugar and spice. Bring to a simmer, then cook until soft and 
jammy; if using dried figs, this will take longer and you’ll probably need to 
add a little more water, so keep an eye on it. Take off the heat, stir in the 
almonds and leave to cool.

Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and line a baking sheet. Roll the pastry out 
on a lightly floured surface to about 20x30cm and 0.5cm thick, and cut in half 
lengthwise to give 2 slim strips.

Put a line of filling down one side of each, leaving a slight gap between it 
and the edge. Brush this with water, then fold the pastry over the top of the 
filling and press to seal. Cut into 4cm lengths and arrange on the baking 
sheet. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar, then bake for 20-25 
minutes until golden. Allow to cool.

Fig rolls: love them or loathe them (and will anyone dare to admit to 
preferring the American Fig Newton?) And, whether you’re a fan or not, which 
other classic biscuits would you like me to have a crack at?
