Ángel Di María scored his first domestic goal for Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> as the Ligue 1 champions 
eventually eased past a game Guingamp 3-0 at the Parc des Princes.

After Argentinian compatriot Javier Pastore opened the scoring with a clinical 
finish in the 18th minute, Di María, who moved to the capital club from 
Manchester United over the summer, doubled PSG’s lead with a quarter of an hour 
remaining.

Di María had opened his PSG account with a goal in the Champions League 
victory over Malmo last week, and he grabbed his first league strike by tapping 
in after Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s effort was spilled byGuingamp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/guingamp> goalkeeper Jonas Lossl.

Ibrahimovic then scored his first goal of the season in the 83rd minute but 
the Swedish striker then saw his penalty saved by Lossl moments later after 
Younousse Sankhare had felled Edinson Cavani in the area.

Unbeaten PSG are now four points clear at the top of the standings after their 
fifth victory in seven games.

Elsewhere, Angers’ miserly defence proved unbreakable once again as fellow 
in-form side Reims were held to a goalless draw at Stade Jean Bouin.

The impressive hosts have kept four clean sheets in their opening six games 
since promotion, leaving them in fifth place inLigue 1

Both sides showed plenty of endeavour in the opening 45 minutes but neither 
Angers’ Ludovic Butelle nor Reims’ Johnny Placide were forced into any real 
work in their respective goals.
