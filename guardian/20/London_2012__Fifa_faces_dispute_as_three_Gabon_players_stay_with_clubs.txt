Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> is facing a dispute over the 
release of three players for the Olympic football tournament.

The French clubs Lorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> and Le 
Mans have each refused to release a player for the Gabon squad, and the west 
African team have also failed to secure the release of a third player from a 
Gabon club.

Fifa lost a case in the court of arbitration for sport in 2008 which ruled 
that clubs were not obliged to release players and the governing body are now 
monitoring the situation withGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>.

A spokesman said: "The national federation are trying to come to an agreement 
with the clubs. We are aware of the situation and we are maintaining a watching 
brief."

The players involved are the first choice goalkeeper Didier Ovono from Le Mans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lemans>, the defender Bruno Ecuele from 
Lorient, and RÃ©my Ebanega from Gabon club US Bitam.

Each country has a squad of 18 players and Gabon are already down to the bare 
bones after another player was taken to hospital on crutches after a friendly 
match at the weekend.

Brazil are considering asking for a replacement for the goalkeeper Rafael 
Cabral due to an injury to the Santos player.
