Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> have confirmed 
Joe Dunne as the club's manager following the dismissal of John Ward last 
weekend.

The former United defender, Dunne, 39, who worked as Ward's assistant, has 
spent the last 16 years at the club. He had been installed as caretaker-manager 
for the second time following the defeat at Scunthorpe on Saturday.

Colchester's executive chairman, Robbie Cowling, said: "It was not an easy 
decision to part company with John Ward because he had worked so hard to 
achieve so much for Colchester United Football Club. However, it was an easy 
choice when it came to selecting John's successor.

"Joe has been with Colchester United for 16 years as a player, youth-team 
manager, reserve manager, assistant manager, caretaker manager and now he is 
first-team manager.

"Joe takes charge of Colchester United when the club's long-term prospects are 
the best they have ever been, but at a time when the short-term future is one 
of its most challenging."
