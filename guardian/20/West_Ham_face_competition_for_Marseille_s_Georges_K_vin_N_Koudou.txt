All three clubs have scouted the former Nantes player 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/24/premier-league-clubs-georges-kevin-nkoudou-scout>
 extensively this season, with representatives present at last month’s French 
Cup final when Marseille were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade de 
France. West Ham are understood to be ready to offer around £10m for the 
21-year-old, although it is likely that the French club’s asking price may be 
significantly higher,

However, with the chair Margarita Louis-Dreyfus having put Marseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> up for sale in April, they may 
be forced to accept a lower fee.

N’Koudou moved to the Stade Vélodrome last summer from Nantes for £1m and 
scored 11 goals in all competitions in his debut season for Marseille.
