Accrington Stanley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/accringtonstanley> 
have been fined £20,000 by the Football League after a commission revealed 
their manager, James Beattie, did not hold the necessary coaching 
qualifications.

The former England striker has been in charge of the League Two club since May 
last year but Beattie has still yet to acquire a Uefa B licence, which is a 
requirement for any manager in League One orLeague Two

A Football League-appointed commission levied the fine on Accrington, £15,000 
of which will be suspended provided Beattie achieves a Uefa B licence by May.

A statement from the Football League said Beattie, in his first managerial 
post, had not enrolled on a course or been able to confirm his place on a 
future course for a B licence.

Accrington said they would not be appealing against the charge.

A statement from the club read: "Accrington Stanley can confirm that the club 
has been fined £20,000, with £15,000 of this amount suspended, for breaching 
Football League regulations regarding manager coaching qualifications.

"This is a regrettable situation and measures have been put in place to ensure 
that James Beattie has gained the required qualifications by the deadline of 
May 1.

"The club do not intend to appeal against the charge."

Glenn Roeder, Gareth Southgate and Paul Ince have held Premier League 
positions despite not obtaining the necessary coaching badges, in their case a 
Uefa Pro Licence.

Only last month Tim Sherwood was handed the reins at Tottenham, without 
holding a Pro Licence, but he must enrol on a course within 12 weeks of his 
appointment.
