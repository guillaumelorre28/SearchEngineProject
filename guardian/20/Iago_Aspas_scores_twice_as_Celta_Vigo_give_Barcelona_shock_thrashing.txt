Manuel Nolito, a former Barca youth player, scored his fifth goal in as many 
games to put Celta ahead after 25 minutes with a pinpoint curling drive from 
the left of the area. Aspas then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper, 
Marc-Andre ter Stegen, for the second just minutes later.

It was clear that it was not going to be Barcelona’s day when Lionel Messi 
struck the woodwork after 52 minutes with only keeper Sergio Alvarez to beat, 
before Aspas raced clear and slotted home on 55 minutes.

Barcelona’s Neymar scored from a tight angle after 80 minutes, but the Celta 
substitute John Guidetti volleyed in his side’s fourth minutes later.

Celta lead La Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> with 
13 points, one more than Barca after five games, while Real, who are on 10 
points, play Athletic Bilbao later this evening.
