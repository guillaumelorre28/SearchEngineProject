90 min: Danger here! Lovren trips Rolan at the edge of the box, conceding a

81 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are 
retreating deeper and deeper. Not quite clinging on, but they sure don’t have 
control of this game.

79 min: Bordeaux are having plenty of the ball and popping it around 
competently until they get near the Liverpool box, whereupon their lack of 
imagination and precision makes things relatively easy for Liverpool. But it’s 
still a dicey 10 minutes forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to navigate and Klopp’s 
anxiety on the sideline is obvious.

76 min: Saivet sure fancies himself from distance. He tries another crack from

70 min: Benteke does his best to bully the two centrebacks and retrieve a long 
ball forward. For a moment it looks like he’ll bustle his way into the box but 
he never quite gets the ball under control and eventually the combined 
persistence of the centrebacks overpowers foils the striker.

67 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> sub: Can 
on, Allen off. The Welshman is applauded generously as he departs. He was a bit 
off in the first half but came on strong in the second. Until he was hauled off.

66 min: High endeavour from both sides but not much magic at the moment. It’s 
clear that most are missing their most creative players. Let’s see if aBordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> substitution can shake things 
up: Crivelli is replaced by the gigantic striker Diabaté.

58 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> surround the 
ref and demand a penalty after a header from a corner hits Benteke’s hands! 
They’ve got a strong case, in my view: there was no justifiable reason for 
Benteke to have his hands up around his face. But the ref disagrees.

55 min: Allen suddenly got the funk! He shimmies past his man and then lets 
fly from 25 yards, forcing Carrasso to bat the ball away awkwardly.

54 min: Goal! Allen and Firmino have been making up for their disappointing 
first halves since the resumption and they combined to tee up another chance 
for Benteke, who slapped into the net from 12 yards. But the ref rules it out 
for reasons that are not clear: he seems to have decided that Benteke fouled 
the defender in the build-up.

50 min: After several minutes of aimlessness from both sides, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> piece together a lovely move. 
Allen plays his part, taking possession and slipping a pass through to Firmino, 
who pulls the ball back to Benteke. It’s a great chance for the striker, 15 
yards out and in front of the goal .... but he leans back and launches it 
skywards!

As for the home players, Moreno and Ibe have been decent. Allen’s been sketchy 
but the msot disappointing has been Firmino, who has barely featured.

Half-time: Liverpool 2-1 Bordeaux

There was a point in that half when the match seemed to be lurching towards 
dreariness. Even Mignolet started dozing and that, paradoxically, perked things 
up, as Bordeaux scored a fine goal and triggered a finer reply from Liverpool. 
Benteke needs a big game to impress his new boss and Klopp has got to be 
chuffed with the goal that has put the home team in front. Round about now, 
Mignolet is getting the rollicking of his life in theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> dressing room, I’ll wager. Bet 
he’ll be out for the second half bang on time.

GOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Bordeaux (Benteke 45)

No blunders around that goal, that’s just stonking centreforward play from 
Benteke! Clyne raced down the right and hoiked in a good cross. Benteke took a 
touch to create space for a shot and then walloped it into the net from 18 
yards!
 A cracking finish from Christian Benteke means it’s 2-1 and Liverpool are in 
the driving seat. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters  The Liverpool striker has 
every reason to celebrate, that was a fantastic finish. Photograph: Carl

44 min: Fine play by Moreno down the left. He nutmegs Poko and bursts into the 
box. But, as too often tonight, his subsequent cross fails to beat the next 
defender.

42 min: Benteke tries to barge his way into the box but is repelled. 
Meanwhile, here is the truth, courtesy of Niall Mullen: “Daniel Sturridge is 
allowed to do whatever the hell he wants with his own body. Some players (Tommy 
Smith, say) play through injury with painkilling injections and end up with 
crippling osteoarthritis. Some players want their bodies to feel perfect (Ruud 
Van Nistelrooy say) before playing. Whatever the case it’s their bodies so 
their decision.”

40 min: Sané tries to make up for his blunder. He rises well to meet an 
in-swinging freekick but heads high over the bar. Mignolet is going to retrieve 
the ball. And maybe look up and contemplate the clouds while he’s at it, 
perhaps compose a gentle verse of poetry. This could take a while.

GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Bordeaux (Milner pen, 37)

Carrasso saved a stoppage time penalty last weekend but he got nowhere near 
Milner’s well-struck spotkick, diving to his right as the ball went the other 
way into the bottom corner. The sides are level, each having committed 
incredible goofs!

90+ 2min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> sub: 
Origi on for Ibe.
 
90+1 min: Mignolet does save! It wasn’t especially difficult but he punched 
Saivet’s curling shot to safety.
 
90 min: Danger here! Lovren trips Rolan at the edge of the box, conceding a 
freekick in a very dangerous position. Mignolet to the rescue?
 
87 min: Benteke flicks on a long ball towards Lallana. It runs out of play. 
But at least the ball is down the other end. Bordeaux’s territorial dominance 
was starting to spread edginess around Anfield.

85 min: Benteke booked for catching a player slightly late. 
 
84 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> make their 
last sub before taking a corner: Ounas on, Plasil off. Corner cleared by Lucas.
 
81 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are 
retreating deeper and deeper. Not quite clinging on, but they sure don’t have 
control of this game.
 
79 min: Bordeaux are having plenty of the ball and popping it around 
competently until they get near the Liverpool box, whereupon their lack of 
imagination and precision makes things relatively easy for Liverpool. But it’s 
still a dicey 10 minutes forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to navigate and Klopp’s 
anxiety on the sideline is obvious.
 
77 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> change: 
Mbelay on, Jussiê off.
 
76 min: Saivet sure fancies himself from distance. He tries another crack from 
40 yards. This one wobbles way wide, too.
 
74 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> sub: 
Firmino off, Lallana on.
 
73 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> roll 
forward. Can and Milner connive down the left before the Englander runs on to a 
pass from his German chum and hammers the ball into the sidenetting from an 
acute angle.

70 min: Benteke does his best to bully the two centrebacks and retrieve a long 
ball forward. For a moment it looks like he’ll bustle his way into the box but 
he never quite gets the ball under control and eventually the combined 
persistence of the centrebacks overpowers foils the striker.
 
67 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> sub: Can 
on, Allen off. The Welshman is applauded generously as he departs. He was a bit 
off in the first half but came on strong in the second. Until he was hauled off.
 
66 min: High endeavour from both sides but not much magic at the moment. It’s 
clear that most are missing their most creative players. Let’s see if aBordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> substitution can shake things 
up: Crivelli is replaced by the gigantic striker Diabaté.
 
63 min: Ibe booked for wellying the ball away in anger after a freekick is 
given against him.
 
62 min: Nice tidying up by Touré after a loose pass by Allen put Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> in bother. Touré and Lovren 
have been solid enough so far.
 
60 min: Lucas booked for a lubberly challenge in midfield on Plasil, who’s 
copped some stick tonight.
 
58 min: Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> surround the 
ref and demand a penalty after a header from a corner hits Benteke’s hands! 
They’ve got a strong case, in my view: there was no justifiable reason for 
Benteke to have his hands up around his face. But the ref disagrees.
 
56 min: Carrasso saves his team again, this time blocking Ibe’s shot with his 
feet after a good header by Firmino set the winger running clear on goal.

55 min: Allen suddenly got the funk! He shimmies past his man and then lets 
fly from 25 yards, forcing Carrasso to bat the ball away awkwardly.
 
54 min: Goal! Allen and Firmino have been making up for their disappointing 
first halves since the resumption and they combined to tee up another chance 
for Benteke, who slapped into the net from 12 yards. But the ref rules it out 
for reasons that are not clear: he seems to have decided that Benteke fouled 
the defender in the build-up.

50 min: After several minutes of aimlessness from both sides, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> piece together a lovely move. 
Allen plays his part, taking possession and slipping a pass through to Firmino, 
who pulls the ball back to Benteke. It’s a great chance for the striker, 15 
yards out and in front of the goal .... but he leans back and launches it 
skywards!
 
47 min: Saivet attempts a shot from 40 yards and it doesn’t even make it as 
far as the box.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> build 
from the back ...
 
46 min: The second half starts with the same personnel who started the first. 
 
As for the home players, Moreno and Ibe have been decent. Allen’s been sketchy 
but the msot disappointing has been Firmino, who has barely featured.
 
There was a point in that half when the match seemed to be lurching towards 
dreariness. Even Mignolet started dozing and that, paradoxically, perked things 
up, as Bordeaux scored a fine goal and triggered a finer reply from Liverpool. 
Benteke needs a big game to impress his new boss and Klopp has got to be 
chuffed with the goal that has put the home team in front. Round about now, 
Mignolet is getting the rollicking of his life in theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> dressing room, I’ll wager. Bet 
he’ll be out for the second half bang on time.
 
No blunders around that goal, that’s just stonking centreforward play from 
Benteke! Clyne raced down the right and hoiked in a good cross. Benteke took a 
touch to create space for a shot and then walloped it into the net from 18 
yards!

44 min: Fine play by Moreno down the left. He nutmegs Poko and bursts into the 
box. But, as too often tonight, his subsequent cross fails to beat the next 
defender.
 
42 min: Benteke tries to barge his way into the box but is repelled. 
Meanwhile, here is the truth, courtesy of Niall Mullen: “Daniel Sturridge is 
allowed to do whatever the hell he wants with his own body. Some players (Tommy 
Smith, say) play through injury with painkilling injections and end up with 
crippling osteoarthritis. Some players want their bodies to feel perfect (Ruud 
Van Nistelrooy say) before playing. Whatever the case it’s their bodies so 
their decision.”
 
40 min: Sané tries to make up for his blunder. He rises well to meet an 
in-swinging freekick but heads high over the bar. Mignolet is going to retrieve 
the ball. And maybe look up and contemplate the clouds while he’s at it, 
perhaps compose a gentle verse of poetry. This could take a while.
 
Carrasso saved a stoppage time penalty last weekend but he got nowhere near 
Milner’s well-struck spotkick, diving to his right as the ball went the other 
way into the bottom corner. The sides are level, each having committed 
incredible goofs!
