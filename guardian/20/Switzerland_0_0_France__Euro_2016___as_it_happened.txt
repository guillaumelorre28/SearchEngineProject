Full time: Switzerland 0-0 France

Peep peep! After a promising start it developed into a mediocre game, though 
the substitute Payet almost scored an incredible goal. The result suits both 
sides: France top the group, and get an easier draw, and Switzerland are 
through to the knockout stages of theEuropean Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/european-championship> for the first 
time. Thanks for your company; goodnight!

90+1 min That could easily have been a penalty for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. Lang’s deep cross was aimed 
towards Dzemalli, who was almost disrobed by Sagna as he tried to reach it. The 
referee either did not see it, or ignored it.

88 min Payet’s free-kick hits his own man, the crouching Matuidi, and goes 
wide for a goalkick. I’m not sure whether it was going in or not.

time, and the free-kick is perfectly positioned for Payet: 22 yards out, left 
of centre...

84 min “Agreed, Power Cube is a great one,” says Mark Turner, “but the 
tradition of good nicks lives on in Argentina, to the point where players

80 min “Hi Rob,” says Jörg Michner. “Kari Tulinius wondered if there is a 
better nickname for a contemporary player than “Power Cube” - I think there is: 
Roma’s Kevin Strootman is called “Er Lavatrice” by his teammates: The Washing 
Machine. It’s due to his ability to turn even the “dirtiest” (as in bad) passes 
he receives into “clean” (good) ones.”

FRANCE HIT THE BAR FOR THE THIRD TIME!

75 min Payet so nearly scores the goal of the tournament! Sissoko charged 70 
yards down the right, a magnificent run, before lifting a deliberate, very deep 
cross to Payet, arriving from out of shot on the left of the box. He was 12 
yards out, running at full speed, and opened his body to sidefoot a wonderful 
right-footed volley that beat Sommer and rattled the underside of the bar!

73 min “I do enjoy listening to Danny Murphy as a pundit and commentator,” 
says Matt Dony. “He’s knowledgeable without being patronising, enthusiastic but 
not over-excitable, and pretty funny at times. Go on, Rob, we’re all friends 
here. Was he the Secret Footballer?” No. But I agree, he’s terrific. While 
punditry has improved beyond recognition, there aren’t many good 
co-commentators around. Murphy is excellent at both.

One goal fromSwitzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> and 
they could face Germany in the last 16, and will almost certainly face Spain in 
the last eight if they get that far.

68 min “Is there a better nickname for a contemporary footballer than “Power 
Cube”?” asks Kari Tulinius. “It’s inventive and encapsulates Shaqiri as a 
player. Reading about football history, there are tons of great nicknames, “The 
Paper Man”, “The Galloping Major”, “Chopper Harris” and “The Poet of the Left 
Foot”. These have largely disappeared from the modern game, another fine 
tradition lost to our cynical age.”

There have been a few amusing ones, though, like ‘One Size’ Fitz Hall, Kiki 
‘Chris’ Musampa, and, er, that’s it.

63 min Dimitri Payet comes on for France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, replacing the slightly 
disappointing Kingsley Coman. Somebody get a camera on Slaven Bilic.

60 min France have stirred after a very sluggish start to the second half. As 
in 1998, their potential route to the final is so much easier if they avoid 
defeat in the final group match.

58 min Shaqiri goes flying after a tackle on the edge of the France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> box, but the referee ignores him 
and waves play on. He was definitely caught by Cabaye, even if he did 
exaggerate the fall.

57 min Pogba brilliantly resists a four-pronged challenge to maintain 
possession and find Griezmann. He plays a one-two with Gignac and then, from 20 
yards, lifts a right-footed shot that is pushed over by Sommer. It was a lovely 
attack, though a pretty comfortable save for Sommer in the end.

54 min Djourou’s poor pass allows Griezmann to break beyond Schar, and the 
last man Behrami has to get round to make a crucial block tackle. As he does 
so, the ball bursts and there’s a delay while they wait for a replacement. You 
don’t see that too often.

51 min Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> are 
technically the home side in this game, and they are playing like it: they have 
had more of the ball, particularly since the break, and here’s another corner 
on the left. Rodriguez swings it out and it’s headed clear.

47 min A fast start from the Swiss. Shaqiri plays a brilliant lofted reverse 
pass to find Embolo on the right wing, and his dangerous low cross is 
backheeled away from trouble by Koscielny in the six-yard box.

43 min I think this might be the best email we have ever received in an MBM, 
and the worst. “I really hope Germany get knocked out bySwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> in the first knockout rounds 
following a heroic rearguard effort, costing the German coach his job,” says 
Kielan Thompson. “Switzerland’s lauded centre-back partnership could then be 
asked by a controversy-seeking journo in a press conference about these 
consequences and Germany’s future prospects, a question fielded with a chuckle 
by one, who nervously defers the question to the other. The headline could be:
‘Schär: Djourou believe in life after Löw?’ A long shot but I’m hopeful.”

Peep peep! After a promising start it developed into a mediocre game, though 
the substitute Payet almost scored an incredible goal. The result suits both 
sides: France top the group, and get an easier draw, and Switzerland are 
through to the knockout stages of theEuropean Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/european-championship> for the first 
time. Thanks for your company; goodnight!

90+1 min That could easily have been a penalty for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. Lang’s deep cross was aimed 
towards Dzemalli, who was almost disrobed by Sagna as he tried to reach it. The 
referee either did not see it, or ignored it.
 
90 min There will be two added minutes.
 
88 min Payet’s free-kick hits his own man, the crouching Matuidi, and goes 
wide for a goalkick. I’m not sure whether it was going in or not.

87 min Schar handles just outside the Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> area. We’re into late-goal 
time, and the free-kick is perfectly positioned for Payet: 22 yards out, left 
of centre...
 
86 min Switzerland’s final substitution, with Michael Lang replacing Mehmedi.
 
85 min Xhaka’s shirt has been torn in half again. Imagine how much damage 
Claudio Gnetile could have done to the fabric of these Swiss shirts

84 min “Agreed, Power Cube is a great one,” says Mark Turner, “but the 
tradition of good nicks lives on in Argentina, to the point where players 
without one feel they haven’t made it. Though they never translate well, 
“Cosmic Barrel” for Maradona shines brightly in any language.”
 
83 min Koscielny is booked for clattering Lichtsteiner 35 yards from goal. The 
ensuing free-kick is cleared by Koscielny and Pogba.
 
81 min You usually say this about cricket rather than football, but Payet 
looks like he’s playing on a different pitch. His confidence is stratospheric 
at the moment.
 
80 min “Hi Rob,” says Jörg Michner. “Kari Tulinius wondered if there is a 
better nickname for a contemporary player than “Power Cube” - I think there is: 
Roma’s Kevin Strootman is called “Er Lavatrice” by his teammates: The Washing 
Machine. It’s due to his ability to turn even the “dirtiest” (as in bad) passes 
he receives into “clean” (good) ones.”
 
79 min Another Swiss substitution, with Gelson Fernandes replacing Shaqiri.
 
75 min Payet so nearly scores the goal of the tournament! Sissoko charged 70 
yards down the right, a magnificent run, before lifting a deliberate, very deep 
cross to Payet, arriving from out of shot on the left of the box. He was 12 
yards out, running at full speed, and opened his body to sidefoot a wonderful 
right-footed volley that beat Sommer and rattled the underside of the bar!

74 min Haris Seferovic replaces the lively Embolo up front for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>.
 
74 min “Switzerland,” says Simon McMahon, “are the Mike Atherton to France’s 
Allan Donald.” With the number of chances, they are more like the Roger Binny 
to France’s Chris Tavare.
 
73 min “I do enjoy listening to Danny Murphy as a pundit and commentator,” 
says Matt Dony. “He’s knowledgeable without being patronising, enthusiastic but 
not over-excitable, and pretty funny at times. Go on, Rob, we’re all friends 
here. Was he the Secret Footballer?” No. But I agree, he’s terrific. While 
punditry has improved beyond recognition, there aren’t many good 
co-commentators around. Murphy is excellent at both.
 
71 min France are playing a dangerous game here, sitting on their 0-0 lead. 
One goal fromSwitzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> and 
they could face Germany in the last 16, and will almost certainly face Spain in 
the last eight if they get that far.

68 min “Is there a better nickname for a contemporary footballer than “Power 
Cube”?” asks Kari Tulinius. “It’s inventive and encapsulates Shaqiri as a 
player. Reading about football history, there are tons of great nicknames, “The 
Paper Man”, “The Galloping Major”, “Chopper Harris” and “The Poet of the Left 
Foot”. These have largely disappeared from the modern game, another fine 
tradition lost to our cynical age.”

There have been a few amusing ones, though, like ‘One Size’ Fitz Hall, Kiki 
‘Chris’ Musampa, and, er, that’s it.
 
65 min Another corner for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, who have been excellent 
since they moved Shaqiri to No10 at the break. Shaqiri takes the corner, and 
whips it straight onto the roof of the net.
 
63 min Dimitri Payet comes on for France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, replacing the slightly 
disappointing Kingsley Coman. Somebody get a camera on Slaven Bilic.
 
62 min Sagna plays Sissoko into space on the right of the box ... and he slips 
over. The pitches are pretty poor in this tournament.

Botterill/Getty Images  
60 min France have stirred after a very sluggish start to the second half. As 
in 1998, their potential route to the final is so much easier if they avoid 
defeat in the final group match.
 
58 min Shaqiri goes flying after a tackle on the edge of the France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> box, but the referee ignores him 
and waves play on. He was definitely caught by Cabaye, even if he did 
exaggerate the fall.
 
57 min Pogba brilliantly resists a four-pronged challenge to maintain 
possession and find Griezmann. He plays a one-two with Gignac and then, from 20 
yards, lifts a right-footed shot that is pushed over by Sommer. It was a lovely 
attack, though a pretty comfortable save for Sommer in the end.

Fuentes/Reuters  
54 min Djourou’s poor pass allows Griezmann to break beyond Schar, and the 
last man Behrami has to get round to make a crucial block tackle. As he does 
so, the ball bursts and there’s a delay while they wait for a replacement. You 
don’t see that too often.
 
53 min Gignac’s firm low shot from 20 yards is comfortably held by Sommer.
 
51 min Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> are 
technically the home side in this game, and they are playing like it: they have 
had more of the ball, particularly since the break, and here’s another corner 
on the left. Rodriguez swings it out and it’s headed clear.
 
48 min Pogba tries one trick too many on the halfway line and is robbed, with 
a Swiss corner the eventual result. It’s headed away by Cabaye.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> have started this half 
superbly.
 
47 min A fast start from the Swiss. Shaqiri plays a brilliant lofted reverse 
pass to find Embolo on the right wing, and his dangerous low cross is 
backheeled away from trouble by Koscielny in the six-yard box.
 
46 min Peep peep! Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> begin the second half.

Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> have been useful 
and they are one goal away from winning the group. See you in 10 minutes for 
the second half.
 
44 min A fine long pass from Xhaka is miscontrolled by Shaqiri on the right

and the worst. “I really hope Germany get knocked out bySwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> in the first knockout rounds

Germany or Poland in the last 16, and then Spain in the quarters.
