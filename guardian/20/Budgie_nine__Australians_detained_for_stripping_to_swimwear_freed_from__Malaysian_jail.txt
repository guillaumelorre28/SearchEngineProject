Nine Australian men who stripped down to swimwear emblazoned with the 
Malaysian flag have been freed after spending four days in detention.

The men, aged between 25 and 29, pleaded guilty to public nuisance charges. 
They were were cautioned and discharged on Thursday at court near theformula one
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> race track where they were 
arrested on Sunday.

Judge Harith Sham did not convict or fine the men, who were allowed to leave 
Malaysia immediately.The maximum fine for a public nuisance crime 
<http://www.agc.gov.my/agcportal/uploads/files/Publications/LOM/EN/Penal%20Code%20%5BAct%20574%5D2.pdf>
 is 400 Malaysian Ringgit, about £76 or $127 AUD.

He said that regardless of their intention, the men had disrespected Malaysia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia> by unveiling the country’s 
national flag on their swimwear at the grand prix, according to the Australian 
Associated Press.

The Malaysian flag is a strong symbol of sovereignty and monarchy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/australians-who-stripped-to-malaysian-flag-briefs-risk-royal-insult>
 and the stunt angered many across the south-east Asian nation.

The judge added that he hoped their ordeal would remind the boys, who all 
dressed in suits for their court appearance, and others about respecting the 
culture and customs of Malaysia.

The lawyer representing the men, Shafee Abdullah, said they had spent four 
nights in a “not very friendly lock-up”.

One detainee, Thomas Whitworth, fainted during the court session and was given 
water and had his handcuffs removed. He collapsed after reading an letter of 
apology to the court that described the men’s “folly”.

Another member of the group, Jack Walker, is an adviser to the Australian 
government minister Christopher Pyne.

John Walker, Jack’s father, was at court and said it was an excellent result.

“There was no charge, there was no fine. The boys apologised. They recognised 
what they did was unacceptable but they have been completely cleared and are 
free to travel and go home and resume their lives,” he told reporters after the 
hearing.


He said their experience being locked up since Sunday was “horrendous”.


A spokeswoman for Pyne said the matter was being “handled appropriately by the 
Australian high commissioner”.

The head of research and development for Budgy Smuggler, the company that 
makes the bespoke swimwear the nine men wore, told the Guardian there had been 
an increase in sales around the world since the incident on Sunday.

Jarrod Allen said the company was unable to meet the demand for custom made 
flag swimwear.

“We probably owe the boys a few schooeys [schooners of beer]. After this 
cultural enlightenment, we’ll wait until they’re home though. Lesson learned,” 
he said.

“We’ve even had over a dozen orders from Malaysia although given the political 
sensitivity we are going to let them go through to the keeper and will not 
produce again. We’d never set out to intentionally disrespect,” he added.

A Muslim-majority nation, with many people holding conservative values, 
Malaysia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia> is also one of south-east 
Asia’s most accessible business and tourist destinations. But some visitors are 
unaware of local sensitivities.
