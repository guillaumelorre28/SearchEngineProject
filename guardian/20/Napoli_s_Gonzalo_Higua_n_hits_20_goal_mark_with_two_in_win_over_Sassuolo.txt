The sixth-placed visitors, who pulled off a shock 1-0 win at Internazionale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/10/sassuolo-serie-a-inter-penalty-win>
 in their previous match, looked like they might register another upset when 
they took the lead through Diego Falcinelli’s third-minute penalty.

But Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> equalised through 
José Callejón in the 19th minute, and Higuaín then bagged all three points for 
the home side, taking his tally for the season to 20 league goals with strikes 
in the 42nd minute and stoppage time.

Napoli had lost only once in all competitions since an opening day defeat at 
Sassuolo, but Eusebio Di Francesco’s side were the only team unbeaten against 
the top six. It looked like that record was set to continue when they was 
awarded an early penalty after Nicola Sansone was brought down by Raúl Albiol 
and Falcinelli converted from the spot.

It was end-to-end action, and Napoli levelled when Callejón headed in a 
pinpoint cross from Lorenzo Insigne.

Higuaín put Napoli in front from almost the same position three minutes before 
half-time, timing his run perfectly to get between two defenders and slot Marek 
Hamsik’s cross into the far right corner.

Both sides had chances in the second half before Higuaín sealed the result 
with the last kick of the game, managing to squeeze the ball between a diving 
Andrea Consigli and the post, following an assist by Callejón.
