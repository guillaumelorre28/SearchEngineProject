Useful for a light lunch or a lunchbox fix, the onion tart might be the best 
thing to come out of the south of France.

The recipe 

Peel three large onions, slice them, and let them cook in a deep pan with 
a little oil or butter until they are sweet, pale amber in colour and soft 
enough to crush between thumb and finger. This will take a good 20 minutes over 
a low heat, with a frequent stir. Take 375g of puff pastry and place it on 
a lightly floured baking sheet. Score a border, approximately 2cm in from the 
edges, with a sharp knife, making sure not to cut right through the pastry. 
Spread the softened onions over the pastry. Place a good jar of anchovies, 
maybe more, over the surface, in a lattice effect. Place a small black olive at 
the centre of each diamond shape. Bake for 20-30 minutes at 180-200C/gas mark 
4-6 until the pastry is risen and deep gold.

The trick 

The onions need a long, slow cooking. Keep the heat down and cook for a good 
20 minutes until they have softened. You should be able to crush them between 
your finger and thumb. If you use salted anchovies, drain them before adding to 
the onions.

The twist 

A little thyme in with the onions is a good thing. Add a few sun-dried 
tomatoes to the top, along with the olives. Use red onions instead of the 
classic white. Add a little garlic to the onions as they cook. Make mini 
versions, just the right size for a lunchbox. Use a classic shortcrust or filo 
instead of puff pastry. Add basil leaves to the onions.
