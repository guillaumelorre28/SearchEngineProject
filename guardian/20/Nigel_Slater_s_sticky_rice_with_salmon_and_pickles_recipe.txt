The recipe

Put 125g sushi rice into a bowl and cover it in warm water. Swish the rice 
around with your fingers then pour the water away. Repeat this process 3 or 4 
times.

Transfer the rice to a small saucepan, pour in 300ml of water and bring to the 
boil. Cover with a lid and simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat, 
leaving the lid in place.

Cook a 250g piece of salmon tail or fillet, seasoned and brushed with oil, 
under a hot oven grill for 4 or 5 minutes. In a dry pan, toast 3 tbsp sesame 
seeds till golden.

Finely grate a 2cm lump of peeled ginger. Tip half the sesame seeds into a 
mortar and crush them to a coarse paste with a peeled clove of garlic, half a 
tsp of sea salt and the grated ginger. Add 1 tbsp of black sesame seeds to the 
reserved seeds. Lift the lid of the rice and fold the sesame and ginger paste 
and the whole sesame seeds through it with a fork or chopsticks.

Divide the rice between 2 bowls. Break the warm fish into large pieces and add 
it to the rice, together with a few pickled vegetables as you wish.

The trick

Use a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and don’t be tempted to lift it until 
the rice has rested for 10 minutes after cooking. Much happens to the rice in 
those quiet moments under the saucepan lid.

The twist

I prefer a slightly sticky rice for this. Sushi rice is ideal – I find it 
particularly comforting – but you could use basmati, brown or white. I use 
pickled radish and pumpkin and cabbage on top of my rice, available in packets 
from Asian food stores, but home-made pickled carrots or beetroot are good, 
too. Smoked mackerel is a very delicious replacement for the salmon.
