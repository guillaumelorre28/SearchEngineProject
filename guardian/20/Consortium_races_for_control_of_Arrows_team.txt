A former director of Honda's motor racing division is gearing up to bid for a 
controlling stake in the ArrowsFormula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> team.

Rupert Manwaring is understood to be leading a consortium backed by European 
broadcasters and technology companies that is prepared to offer $40m (£24m) for 
the stake.

If his bid is successful Arrows founder Tom Walkinshaw is likely to be removed 
from the management structure to make way for a new team.

Mr Manwaring's offer follows Arrows' appointment of HSBC Investment Bank to 
sell all or part of the business in October.

Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, the venture group owned by Deutsche Bank, owns 
50% of Arrows. Morgan Grenfell recently paid $325m for a 12.5% stake in Bernie 
Ecclestone's Formula One holdings. Mr Walkinshaw owns 25%, with the rest owned 
by Prince Malik Ado Ibrahim, a Nigerian businessman who split from the team in 
October.

Morgan Grenfell is thought to want to reduce its stake in Arrows after buying 
into Mr Ecclestone's company, which controls the lucrative broadcasting rights 
to Formula One.

Pall Mall Capital Partners, the finance group that recently helped Apax 
Partners buy 49% of Prodrive, the company behind the Subaru rally team, is 
understood to have been the driving force behind Mr Manwaring's bid.

If successful he is likely to buy 51% of Arrows with the option to buy the 
remainder at a later date. Arrows, which has traditionally languished towards 
the bottom of the Formula One rankings, has a new car and engine for next 
season and is determined to improve its fortunes.

Morgan Grenfell and Mr Walkinshaw were thought to originally value Arrows at 
around £100m following strong interest from Asia and the Middle East but 
observers say their valuation may have been over-ambitious.
