Juventus were held to a surprise 1-1 draw at home to relegation-threatened 
Cagliari <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cagliari> as the champions 
turned one eye to Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final second leg at Real 
Madrid.

With a fourth consecutive Serie A title already in the bag after last week’s 
1-0 win over Sampdoria,Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> 
were on course for a routine victory when Paul Pogba’s deflected strike put 
them ahead on the stroke of half-time.

Luca Rossettini equalised five minutes from time, though, to keep Cagliari’s 
survival hopes alive.

With three games left Cagliari are in 18th place in the 20-team division with 
28 points, five behind Atalanta, who visit Palermo on Sunday.

With Juventus leading Real Madrid 2-1 ahead of the second-leg, coach 
Massimiliano Allegri predictably rested 10 players with the midfielder Claudio 
Marchisio the only player retained from the side that beat the Spanish giants 
on Tuesday.

Pogba, back after hamstring injury that had sidelined him since March, was 
outstanding throughout and was rewarded for his hard work when his fierce shot 
took a cruel deflection off Rossettini and past Zeljko Brkic in the visitors’ 
goal.

Rossettini responded to earn his side a point though when he poked in from 
close range after his initial header rebounded off the woodwork.
