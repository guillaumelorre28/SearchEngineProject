* One letter in each across solution clashed with an intersecting down 
solution. You had to select which of these clashing pairs of letters best 
fitted the grid. The correct letters (in normal grid order) spelled out THE 
ORIGIN OF SPECIES. The middle row of the grid (from 17 reading to the right) 
then had to be changed, in accordance with Darwin's evolutionary process, from 
MONKEY to PERSON.
