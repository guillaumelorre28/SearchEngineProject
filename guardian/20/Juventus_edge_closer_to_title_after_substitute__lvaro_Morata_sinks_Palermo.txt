The Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> substitute Álvaro 
Morata needed only 10 minutes and one superb strike in Palermo on Saturday to 
fire the champions to a 1-0 win, a 14-point lead in Serie A and another step 
closer to a seemingly inevitable 31st Scudetto.

Juve’s first triumph away from home in over two months gives them 64 points 
from 27 games, while second-placed AS Roma, who host Sampdoria on Monday, trail 
on 50 from 26 games.

“One less win needed to win the league,” the Juventus manager, Massimiliano 
Allegri, told Sky Sports Italia. “Probably six more victories and a few draws 
should be enough.”

The Spain international Morata came on in the 60th minute, replacing his 
compatriot Fernando Llorente in a match that appeared to be heading towards a 
goalless draw.

Yet 10 minutes later, he received a long pass from Claudio Marchisio, kept the 
defender Sinisa Andelkovic at a distance and rifled home an unstoppable 
left-foot shot from just outside the area.

“He scored a marvellous goal,” Allegri said. “I love 1-0 games. For the second 
straight time, we finished with a clean sheet. I’m very pleased.”

Andrea Barzagli was back in Juve’s starting lineup after playing his first 
five minutes of the season against Sassuolo on Monday.

The former Palermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> defender, 
playing alongside his Italian international team-mates Leonardo Bonucci and 
Giorgio Chiellini, looked in good form after the heel injury which has 
sidelined him since last summer’s World Cup.

“It’s very important to have Barzagli back,” Allegri beamed. “We’ll see how he 
feels tomorrow but the first game is usually easier than the second.”

Juventus visit Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday in the Champions League last 16 
second leg, having won the opening match 2-1.

“It’ll be much tougher in Germany,” Allegri concluded. “Scoring one goal won’t 
be enough, we’ll probably need two to advance.”
