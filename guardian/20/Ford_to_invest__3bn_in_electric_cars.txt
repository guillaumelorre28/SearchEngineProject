Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ford> is to invest $4.5bn (£3bn) in 
electric vehicles over the next five years as part of a push by global 
carmakers to overhaul their product range.

The US company will launch 13 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020, meaning that 40% 
of its models will come in an electric version, up from 13%.

Ford’s move comes amid pressure from regulators for carmakers to lower their 
emissions,the growing threat of technology companies Apple and Google launching 
a car

, and changing attitudes to vehicle ownership as people in cities use 
car-sharing services, taxis or public transport instead.

The pressure on carmakers has been increased by the diesel emissions scandal 
at Volkswagen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-systematic-failures-hans-dieter-potsch>
, which has revealed that its diesel cars were more polluting than previously 
thought.

The investment in electric vehicles will include hybrid cars that still have a 
traditional engine, but also pure battery-powered vehicles. Ford will launch a 
Focus Electric next year that can be charged to 80% in 30 minutes, two hours 
faster than at present, and run for 100 miles.

Raj Nair, chief technical officer at Ford, said: “The challenge isn’t who 
provides the most technology in a vehicle but who best organises that 
technology in a way that most excites and delights people. By observing 
consumers, we can better understand which features and strengths users truly 
use and value and create even better experiences for them.

“This new way of working brings together marketing, research, engineering and 
design in a new way to create meaningful user experiences, rather than 
individually developing technologies and features that need to be integrated 
into a final product.”
