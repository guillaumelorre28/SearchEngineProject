Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> scraped past 
Hertha Berlin courtesy of an Arjen Robben goal to stretch their lead at the top 
of the table to 10 points and equal a Bundesliga record for goals conceded 
after 13 games.

The champions were never at their best but hardly needed to be against a 
toothless home side who rarely ventured out of their half.

Bayern’s clean sheet meant they matched VfB Stuttgart’s 2003-04 record of 
letting in only three goals in the opening 13 matches of the season.

Robben fired home from 18 yards after a first-half flick from Thomas Müller as 
the Bavarian side cruised to their 10th win in 13 league matches to bounce back 
from the midweek Champions League defeat at Manchester City.

But there was little else of note from the club that on Friday posted a 
turnover of €528.7m (£420m) for 2013-14, with the 76,000 in the Olympic Stadium 
in Berlin getting only brief glimpses of Bayern’s attacking power.

“We cannot always play top football,” said the Dutch winger Robben afterwards. 
“Sometimes it is just about taking the three points.”

The Hertha keeper Thomas Kraft frustrated the striker Robert Lewandowski, 
twice denying him from point-blank range late in the game.
