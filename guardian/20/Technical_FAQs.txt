• Why does the stream keep pausing?

If the stream keeps pausing, buffering or stops altogether, try switching to a 
lower quality setting on the player.

The setting you should use depends on the speed of your internet connection. 
There are three different settings on the bottom right of the player - Hi, Mid 
and Lo.

The high quality setting requires a minimum connection speed of 2Mbps.
The medium quality setting requires a minimum connection speed of 1Mbps.
The low quality setting requires a minimum connection speed of 512k.
