Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a penalty before scoring an 80th-minute 
equaliser as an injury-hitBorussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> failed to win for the 
second straight game after stumbling to a 1-1 home draw against Hertha Berlin 
on Friday.

Hertha’s Valentin Stocker, who was sent off for a dangerous tackle in the 
final minutes, silenced the home crowd when he slotted in from close range 
after a sensational backheeled pass from Vedad Ibisevic in the 51st minute.

Dortmund, who also had a player sent off when Emre Mor was dismissed for 
pushing an opponent, levelled with Aubameyang’s sixth goal of the season.

Dortmund, who are missing close to a dozen players through injury and lost to 
Bayer Leverkusen in their last outing, are on 13 points in third place, one 
behind Hertha and three off leaders Bayern Munich, who take on Eintracht 
Frankfurt on Saturday.

The hosts had the upper hand throughout but struggled to break into the box in 
the first half. They upped the pressure after the break but Stocker struck 
against the run of play.

Aubameyang should have levelled when he had only the keeper, Rune Jarstein, to 
beat but his weak chip was palmed away with the ball then bouncing off a post.

The Gabon international then had a penalty saved by Jarstein in the 76th 
minute before redeeming himself four minutes later when he slid in at the far 
post to connect with an Ousmane Dembélé cutback to rescue a point for Dortmund.
