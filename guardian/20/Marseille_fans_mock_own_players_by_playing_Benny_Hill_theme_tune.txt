victories all season,Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> 
supporters have turned on their own players – by playing the Benny Hill theme 
song from the stands during their 0-0 draw at home to Bordeaux on Sunday 
evening.

The supporters also displayed several banners depicting goats – une chèvre is

Vélodrome stands.

Marseille, who finished fourth last season but are only six points above 
relegation with five games to play, have not won a league game since 2 
February. They are without a home win in the league since September.

Míchel’s team have, however, reached the French Cup semi-finals – where the 
play Sochaux next week – and made it to the last 32 of the Europa League.
