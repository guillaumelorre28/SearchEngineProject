Backers of an ambitious proposal to transform the UK’s power supply will learn 
in the next few weeks if they are to be given the go-ahead to build tidal 
lagoons to generate electricity. The green light could see a series of major 
lagoon projects costing more than £15bn being constructed around the coast of 
Britain.

A tidal lagoon generates electricity from the natural rise and fall of the 
tides. Rising water flows into dams many miles in length, driving turbines. It 
is then held back behind walls as the tide recedes before being released to 
drive the turbines again, generating thousands of megawatts of power.

A prototype is set for construction in Swansea Bay in the next few years – but 
only if it is given the go-ahead bya government review of tidal lagoon 
technology <https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-tidal-lagoons>, 
chaired by the former energy minister Charles Hendry, which is scheduled to 
release its recommendation early next month.

Green energy experts believe Hendry will give approval, although it remains to 
be seen if tidal lagoon technology – which was backed strongly by the former 
chancellor George Osborne in the last Conservative manifesto – finds favour 
with Theresa May’s administration.

Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Power Lagoon, the backer of the 
Swansea Bay prototype lagoon, said the technology could be an important 
zero-carbon source of electricity generation for the UK. “In addition, the 
money to build tidal lagoons will come from British investors and the expertise 
and technology we develop could be sold around the world,” he said. Tidal 
lagoons could also provide much of the power needed to make up for the 
predicted shortfall in UK energy that will be caused by the phasing out of coal 
plants and ageing nuclear reactors over the next decade, he added.

 How the Swansea Bay visitor centre might look. 
Six major projects have been earmarked for construction: a prototype at 
Swansea Bay; and then full-size lagoons at Cardiff, Newport, Colwyn Bay, 
Bridgwater Bay and west Cumbria. “The crucial point about tidal lagoons is that 
their power generation is not subject to the vagaries of the weather. It is 
predictable. We know exactly when every high tide will be for years ahead. In 
addition, the lagoons will be built to last – for about 120 years,” Shorrock 
said.

The £1.3bn Swansea Bay prototype has been designed to generate 350 megawatts 
of power – enough to supply 150,000 homes with electricity – and could be in 
operation by 2019. About 11 square kilometres of the bay would be surrounded by 
a 9km wall. Cycle paths would be built on the walls and a sailing and canoeing 
centre would be set up inside the lagoon.

Tides would sweep water into the lagoon and drive an array of 16 turbines, 
generating electricity. Then, after high tide has passed, the stored water 
would be released to pour back out of the lagoon to drive the turbines in the 
opposite direction – and generate more electricity. Shorrock claims the lagoon 
would be able to produce power for about 14 hours a day.

Swansea Bay electricity would cost around £89.90 per megawatt hour, he added, 
compared with the £92.50 per megawatt hour price predicted for electricity from 
theHinkley Point C <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c> 
nuclear plant. “However, when we scale up operations with the Cardiff lagoon – 
which will have 10 times the generating capacity of Swansea – we will be able 
to produce power for £65 a megawatt hour,” he said.

The Cardiff lagoon would cost £9bn to construct and contain 65 square 
kilometres of water within a 20km wall. It would have a capacity of 3,000 
megawatts of electricity – compared with the proposed 3,200 megawatts from 
Hinkley Point C.

A request for planning approval for the Cardiff lagoon is to be made by 2018 
with the aim of establishing a manufacturing industry for lagoon components in 
the UK.

However, it is the speed of this follow-up that worries many green 
campaigners. Most back the idea of the Swansea Bay test project but some fear 
that construction of much larger follow-up schemes – starting in Cardiff Bay 
but going on to Colwyn and Bridgwater shortly after – could begin too soon to 
adopt any lessons that will be learned from construction of the prototype 
lagoon.

This point was stressed by Mark Robins, of the RSPB. “The Swansea tidal lagoon 
could prove to be very useful but we will have to monitor how the first 
prototype affects the movement of silt in the estuary, disrupts bird 
populations and impacts on fish stocks before we scale up. This is a completely 
new technology and it is going to be built in a very complicated natural site – 
the Severn estuary. We need to be very careful how we go.”

Richard Benwell, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, agreed. “We are 
cautiously welcoming,” he said. “However, we would want the scheme’s impact to 
be very carefully monitored before building started on the next-generation 
lagoon at Cardiff.”

However, there is strong pressure from the scheme’s backers to instigate a 
speedy follow-up of the Swansea lagoon. They want to establish a supply chain 
for generators, turbines and other components to kick-start tidal technology in 
the UK, establish a series of major lagoon generators and eventually become the 
world leader in the field.

Some worry about the environmental dangers. Others stress the advantages for 
local economies aroundWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and 
Liverpool where tidal lagoons are likely to be clustered.

“This could become a global industry that started in the UK yet was not linked 
to the EU,” said Jane Davidson, pro vice-chancellor at the University of Wales 
Trinity Saint David and a former Welsh Assembly minister. “This could play a 
major role in subsidising low-income, lower-skills areas. It is something that, 
locally, we can pick up and run with.”

For its part, the UK climate change committee counselled caution in its report 
on renewable energy last year. “There may be a role for tidal lagoon power in 
providing predictable low-carbon electricity in the UK if projects can be 
delivered at acceptable cost. However, it is important that these proposals 
proceed with careful assessment of the potential environment impacts,” it 
warned.
