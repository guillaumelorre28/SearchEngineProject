The conservative backbencher George Christensen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-christensen> has backed the 
idea of the controversial mining company Adani getting a $1bn loan from the 
Turnbull government for a rail line in his Queensland electorate.

But an analyst has warned the government would have to conduct strict due 
diligence to ensure the loan was not funnelled through the Cayman Islands tax 
haven.

As Malcolm Turnbull met the Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, in Melbourne 
on Monday to discuss the project, more than300 people rallied in

 the city to protest against the plan to help fund the 388km railway line.

Adani’s proposed line, belonging to the group’s Carmichael rail project 
<http://www.adaniaustralia.com/businesses/carmichael-coal-mine-and-rail-project>
, would link the Galilee basin in Queensland to a new terminal at Abbot Point 
port to help it ship thermal coal to India.

Matt Canavan, the minister for northern Australia, confirmed on Monday that 
the government was considering lending $1bn towards the rail project.

But he said the proposal was still before the independent panel of the 
National Australia Infrastructure Fund, which would make a final recommendation 
to government on whether or not to support it, and the final decision could be 
months away.

A spokeswoman for the prime minister would not say what was discussed at the 
Melbourne meeting.


 Christensen wrote on his Facebook page on Monday that he “fully supported” 
the loan plan.


“The NAIF was established to support multi-user infrastructure that will 
enable economic expansion and employment in the North,” he wrote. “Adani’s 
railway line ticks all of those boxes.”

But Tim Buckley, an analyst from the Institute for Energy Economics and 
Financial Analysis, warned the NAIF and federal government would have to be 
mindful of the entity receiving the loan.

According to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the 
corporate structure of Adani’s Australian operations was extremely complicated, 
he told Guardian Australia. “The rail project is not part of Adani Mining Pty 
Ltd, it’s a completely separate proposal,” he said.

Buckley said it was unclear which company NAIF was considering lending money 
to. It could be Carmichael Rail Holdings, Carmichael Rail Network, Carmichael 
Rail Network Holdings or Carmichael Rail Pty Ltd, he said.

“Any one of those you would think would probably be the Carmichael railway 
line, unless they got the names wrong by accident,” he said.

“But [according to] Asic’s reports, you’ll find that the parent company is a 
Singapore tax haven-based entity, Carmichael Rail Singapore, and then above 
that ... you end up in Atulya Resources Limited, which is a Cayman Islands tax 
haven-based company.

“And that is the parent entity of the Adani family company, according to 
reports lodged.”

Ben Oquist from the Australia Institute said the NAIF process lacked 
transparency and basic questions about itsfunding guidelines and mandate 
<https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2016L00654> ought to be answered.

“Any private-sector project can be made commercial if you throw enough 
government money at it,” he said. “The Adani project is already an 
environmental nightmare we should not let it become a taxpayer-funded economic 
disaster as well.

 “Subsidising infrastructure for an unviable and foreign-owned mining project 
will inevitably mean more worthy local investments will miss out.”
