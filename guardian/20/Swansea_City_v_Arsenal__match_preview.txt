If Arsenal are serious about hunting down Chelsea, then nothing less than 
victory will do at Swansea. While the good news forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> is that Mesut Özil is back after 
illness, Hector Bellerín and Francis Coquelin are among a long list of 
absentees. Swansea have their own problems, with Neil Taylor and new signing 
Luciano Narsingh ruled out. Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, who has scored in his 
past four matches, could be the man to watch.Stuart James
