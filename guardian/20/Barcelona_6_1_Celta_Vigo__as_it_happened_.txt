For almost an hour of this game, Celta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> were on terms and causing far 
more problems than most visitors to this stadium. Even after Luis Suárez 
restored Barcelona’s lead with a breathtaking goal, Celta were right in the 
game with 15 minutes to play.

What followed was barely believable. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> accelerated mercilessly, a 
riot of rainbow flicks, rapid-fire interplay, and for the fourth goal, an 
extraordinary penalty fake that you’ll probably be seeing again.


Beating Celta was far from certain at half-time; in the end, they humiliated 
them. Perhaps, given their recent struggles against this side, that was all 
part of the plan. Either way, it was quite something to behold.

Thanks for joining me. Goodnight!

GOAL! Barcelona 6-1 Celta Vigo (Neymar)

Thank you, and goodnight. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have been extraordinary in the 
second half, and Neymar wraps up a thumping victory, getting himself on the 
scoresheet as (you guessed it) Messi and Suárez tee him up. Through on goal, he 
lifts the ball daintily over Sergio, and that’s six.

88 mins: It also seems that Suárez may have been encroaching when he scored 
that penalty. The officials were presumably as bewildered as everyone else.

86 mins: In the midst of Barcelona’s penalty antics, Wass went off, replaced 
by Pape Cheikh. It feels like an awfully long time since he could, maybe 
should, have equalised.

Barcelona 5-1 Celta Vigo (Rakitic)

I suppose the lesson here is to never, ever annoy Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Rakitic races through a 
ragged Celta back line, meets Suárez’s expert through ball, and lofts the ball 
over the increasingly forlorn keeper.

Barcelona 4-1 Celta Vigo (Suárez)

Now this... this is something else. Messi puts the ball on the spot, about to 
tuck away his 300thLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>
 goal... then rolls the ball to his right, allowing Suárez to steam in and slot 
the ball under Sergio! That is absolutely outrageous.

Penalty to Barcelona!

It’s all become too much for Celta, with Neymar rainbow flicking his way to a 
one-on-one which Sergio narrowly wins. Before they know it, Messi is coming at 
them from the other flank, and he is hauled down on the goal line. Needless, 
but understandable.

77 mins: Guidetti is replaced by Drazic, and earns a smattering of applause 
from the home supporters. Iniesta, replaced by Arda Turan, is given a more 
rousing send off. Suárez looked suitably sheepish after that choice bit of 
goal-hanging; it’s his goal though, and he’s now La Liga’s outright top scorer.

GOAL! Barcelona 3-1 Celta Vigo (Suárez)

Yes. Yes they will. Messi cuts in at speed from the right, then flicks a pass 
into Neymar’s path. It’s a touch overhit, but Neymar somehow rolls the ball 
around Sergio, then lofts the ball back across goal, all in a fraction of a 
second. It may have gone in anyway, but Suárez is at the far post to make sure.

73 mins: The hosts keep stroking the ball around, but Celta are patient, and 
then pounce in midfield, with Wass, a menacing box-to-box presence, motoring 
forward and firing on goal – but it’s too close to Bravo! Will they rue missing 
these chances?

Guidetti combine, the latter tees up Wass for a shot that pings just over the

66 mins: Oof! Guidetti has been a marvellous nuisance tonight, and he does to 
Mascherano what he did to Alba in the first half, muscling him off the ball 
effectively, setting up a shot from an angle – but a rush of blood sends it 
high over the bar.

62 minutes: Barcelona warming up nicely, with Suárez drilling a cross towards 
Neymar that Sergio collects smartly. Alves, who drew the ire of the crowd at 
times, looked mighty peeved to be substituted.

58 minutes: Celta can’t clear their lines, and Suárez slots the ball to Messi, 
then barrels into the area, anticipating an exquisite scooped pass from his 
team-mate, and smashing the ball past the helpless Sergio.

57 mins: The hosts are clanking through the gears, finding almost too many

Neymar has a shot that flies thirty feet over Sergio’s goal.

55 mins: Celta so nearly hand the initiative back to Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, as a misplaced pass presents 
the ball to Messi, thirty yards out. That, obviously, is a bad idea, and he 
picks out Iniesta. Only Sergio’s wrists of steel prevent his low shot from 
finding the net.

54 mins: Guidetti, who has done an excellent job as a lone striker, is still 
wound up about that handball, and grabs a handful of Alba’s shirt after the 
defender slumps to the ground too easily.

53 mins: Barça’s passing has been uncharacteristically askew tonight, but they 
almost worm their way through here. Iniesta and Neymar combine, before the 
Brazilian slips the ball to Messi. Celta’s defenders, swarming relentlessly, 
eventually stop the No10 in his tracks.

51 mins: Gerard Piqué is a lucky man, as the referee fails to spot a clear 
handball, with the centre-back in a tussle with Guidetti. The Celta striker is 
incensed.

49 mins: After such a rapid start to the second half, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have become a little tentative 
– perhaps confused by Celta’s obstinate refusal to sit in their own half.

46 mins: What a goal this would have been. Or rather, what an assist, as 
Neymar danced past Cabral, swivelling along the goal line and leaving the 
centre-back on his proverbial. He cut the ball back to Suárez, whose angled 
shot clatters the post! Roberto, following up, can only scoop the rebound wide.

We’ll be back under way shortly. It could be a long 45 minutes for Celta to 
endure, particularly as they played, and lost, a Copa del Rey semi-final on 
Thursday. Part of the reason Celta’s league form has stuttered in recent weeks 
is that –get this – they prioritised the Cup.

Half time: Barcelona 1-1 Celta Vigo

Despite a lack of form and first-team regulars, Celta have stood up to their 
hosts, and John Guidetti’s penalty has them level at the break. An intriguing 
second half coming up shortly.

45 mins: Mascherano tees up Alba with a raking pass down the left wing, and 
his cross deflects to Neymar, stationed in the corner of the penalty area – but 
his shot is high, wide and hopeless, in truth.

42 mins: Neymar is felled by Hugo Mallo, who gets a booking. Three of the 
Celta back four on yellow cards now, which can’t be good. Another presentable 
free kick, close to the left-hand corner of the penalty area...

GOAL! Barcelona 1-1 Celta Vigo (Guidetti penalty)

Guidetti fires a fierce spot-kick across Bravo, who dives the right way but 
can’t keep it out, before cupping his ears to the Camp Nou stands. Celta, on 
balance, just about deserve that.

Penalty to Celta Vigo!

Well, well. Alba gets in a muddle as Guidetti chases him down, seemingly in 
vain – and as the Swedish striker moves level with him, Alba oafishly clips his 
heels!

For almost an hour of this game, Celta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> were on terms and causing far 
more problems than most visitors to this stadium. Even after Luis Suárez 
restored Barcelona’s lead with a breathtaking goal, Celta were right in the 
game with 15 minutes to play.

What followed was barely believable. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> accelerated mercilessly, a 
riot of rainbow flicks, rapid-fire interplay, and for the fourth goal, an 
extraordinary penalty fake that you’ll probably be seeing again.


Beating Celta was far from certain at half-time; in the end, they humiliated 
them. Perhaps, given their recent struggles against this side, that was all 
part of the plan. Either way, it was quite something to behold.

Thanks for joining me. Goodnight!
 
Well that wasn’t bad, was it?
 
Thank you, and goodnight. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have been extraordinary in the 
second half, and Neymar wraps up a thumping victory, getting himself on the 
scoresheet as (you guessed it) Messi and Suárez tee him up. Through on goal, he 
lifts the ball daintily over Sergio, and that’s six.
 
88 mins: It also seems that Suárez may have been encroaching when he scored 
that penalty. The officials were presumably as bewildered as everyone else.
 
86 mins: In the midst of Barcelona’s penalty antics, Wass went off, replaced 
by Pape Cheikh. It feels like an awfully long time since he could, maybe 
should, have equalised.
 
“I hope Thierry Henry and Robert Pires were watching” says Charles Antaki.
 Always worth another look.  
I suppose the lesson here is to never, ever annoy Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Rakitic races through a 
ragged Celta back line, meets Suárez’s expert through ball, and lofts the ball 
over the increasingly forlorn keeper.
 
Now this... this is something else. Messi puts the ball on the spot, about to 
tuck away his 300thLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>
 goal... then rolls the ball to his right, allowing Suárez to steam in and slot 
the ball under Sergio! That is absolutely outrageous.
 
It’s all become too much for Celta, with Neymar rainbow flicking his way to a 
one-on-one which Sergio narrowly wins. Before they know it, Messi is coming at 
them from the other flank, and he is hauled down on the goal line. Needless, 
but understandable.
 
77 mins: Guidetti is replaced by Drazic, and earns a smattering of applause 
from the home supporters. Iniesta, replaced by Arda Turan, is given a more 
rousing send off. Suárez looked suitably sheepish after that choice bit of 
goal-hanging; it’s his goal though, and he’s now La Liga’s outright top scorer.
 
Yes. Yes they will. Messi cuts in at speed from the right, then flicks a pass 
into Neymar’s path. It’s a touch overhit, but Neymar somehow rolls the ball 
around Sergio, then lofts the ball back across goal, all in a fraction of a 
second. It may have gone in anyway, but Suárez is at the far post to make sure.
 
73 mins: The hosts keep stroking the ball around, but Celta are patient, and 
then pounce in midfield, with Wass, a menacing box-to-box presence, motoring 
forward and firing on goal – but it’s too close to Bravo! Will they rue missing 
these chances?
 
Footballers should never use social media, part 589:
 
70 mins: Barcelona trying to settle things down with a spell of sustained 
passing. For perhaps the first time tonight, this feels like a normalBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> home game.
 
68 mins: Celta are feeling their way back into this match, and after Mallo and 
Guidetti combine, the latter tees up Wass for a shot that pings just over the 
bar. It’s not over yet...
 
66 mins: Oof! Guidetti has been a marvellous nuisance tonight, and he does to 
Mascherano what he did to Alba in the first half, muscling him off the ball 
effectively, setting up a shot from an angle – but a rush of blood sends it 
high over the bar.
 
64 mins: A change for Celta, who have lost their way in this second half. Díaz 
replaces Pablo Hernández, who has run himself into the ground.
 
62 minutes: Barcelona warming up nicely, with Suárez drilling a cross towards 
Neymar that Sergio collects smartly. Alves, who drew the ire of the crowd at 
times, looked mighty peeved to be substituted.
 
60 minutes: I don’t know what was more impressive – the pass from Messi, or 
the fact that Suárez was expecting it. Changes forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, with Alves and Roberto off, 
and Aleix Vidal and Rakitic on.
 
58 minutes: Celta can’t clear their lines, and Suárez slots the ball to Messi, 
then barrels into the area, anticipating an exquisite scooped pass from his 
team-mate, and smashing the ball past the helpless Sergio.

 <https://twitter.com/CheapPanini/status/698972291607195652> February 14, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/CheapPanini/status/698972291607195652>  
It has been coming, and it was, quite frankly, sensational.
 
57 mins: The hosts are clanking through the gears, finding almost too many 
bodies in the box as Neymar and Suárez get in each other’s way. Eventually, 
Neymar has a shot that flies thirty feet over Sergio’s goal.
 
55 mins: Celta so nearly hand the initiative back to Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, as a misplaced pass presents 
the ball to Messi, thirty yards out. That, obviously, is a bad idea, and he 
picks out Iniesta. Only Sergio’s wrists of steel prevent his low shot from 
finding the net.
 
54 mins: Guidetti, who has done an excellent job as a lone striker, is still 
wound up about that handball, and grabs a handful of Alba’s shirt after the 
defender slumps to the ground too easily.
 
53 mins: Barça’s passing has been uncharacteristically askew tonight, but they 
almost worm their way through here. Iniesta and Neymar combine, before the 
Brazilian slips the ball to Messi. Celta’s defenders, swarming relentlessly, 
eventually stop the No10 in his tracks.
 
51 mins: Gerard Piqué is a lucky man, as the referee fails to spot a clear 
handball, with the centre-back in a tussle with Guidetti. The Celta striker is 
incensed.
 
49 mins: After such a rapid start to the second half, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have become a little tentative 
– perhaps confused by Celta’s obstinate refusal to sit in their own half.
 
46 mins: What a goal this would have been. Or rather, what an assist, as 
Neymar danced past Cabral, swivelling along the goal line and leaving the 
centre-back on his proverbial. He cut the ball back to Suárez, whose angled 
shot clatters the post! Roberto, following up, can only scoop the rebound wide.
 
It’s back on in Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>.
 
We’ll be back under way shortly. It could be a long 45 minutes for Celta to 
endure, particularly as they played, and lost, a Copa del Rey semi-final on 
Thursday. Part of the reason Celta’s league form has stuttered in recent weeks 
is that –get this – they prioritised the Cup.
 
Despite a lack of form and first-team regulars, Celta have stood up to their 
hosts, and John Guidetti’s penalty has them level at the break. An intriguing 
second half coming up shortly.
 
45 mins: Mascherano tees up Alba with a raking pass down the left wing, and 
his cross deflects to Neymar, stationed in the corner of the penalty area – but 
his shot is high, wide and hopeless, in truth.
 
43 mins: Neymar’s effort looks the part, but was always zipping a couple of 
feet over the bar.
 
42 mins: Neymar is felled by Hugo Mallo, who gets a booking. Three of the 
Celta back four on yellow cards now, which can’t be good. Another presentable 
free kick, close to the left-hand corner of the penalty area...
 
40 mins: Roberto, a persistent presence in the Celta penalty area, spins 
sharply before lofting a pass to Suárez, who fires low and wide across Sergio’s 
goal.
 
Guidetti fires a fierce spot-kick across Bravo, who dives the right way but 
can’t keep it out, before cupping his ears to the Camp Nou stands. Celta, on 
balance, just about deserve that.
 
Well, well. Alba gets in a muddle as Guidetti chases him down, seemingly in 
vain – and as the Swedish striker moves level with him, Alba oafishly clips his 
heels!
