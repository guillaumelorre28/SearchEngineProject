to meet the break clause without the anticipated £105m they are demanding for 
Pogba, the imminent transfer indicates that José Mourinho is moving ever closer 
to his prime transfer target.

Meanwhile, the Uruguayan defender Guillermo Varela is set to join Eintracht 
Frankfurt on a season-long loan from Manchester United. The Premier League club 
announced on their website on Saturday morning that they had reached agreement 
for the player to sign for the Bundesliga club. Varela made his senior United 
debut in a goalless home draw against West Ham last December and made 10 starts 
for the first team.

United - a 2-0 friendly win at Wigan last weekend - but did not travel to China 
for their pre‑season tour.
