, were the product of 58 days of continuous simulation and over the millennium 
Sheffield United proved to be the most successful club in England, winning the 
Premier League title 167 times.

Burnley were the second most successful, picking up 138 titles, but the 
Clarets were the most consistent in the league, taking part in 982 seasons in 
the top flight and claiming no fewer than 42 Champions League titles, one more 
thanSheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited>.

The current champions, Chelsea, get their hands on the title just once more in 
the next 1,000 years, however – the same number of times as FC Halifax Town and 
Forest Green Rovers. Spare a thought for Skelmersdale United, meanwhile. They 
are to reach seven FA Cup finals, losing each one.

Coventry City prove themselves to be big spenders, shelling out a world record 
$127m, £81m by today’s exchange rate, for Jérémy Lannoy from Bordeaux in 2044 
while it is Burnley who boast the biggest stadium in the country – the Harry 
Potts Arena which holds 112,278.

Despite 1,000 years elapsing, a number of records remain unbroken however. 
Aston Villa’s 128 goals in the 1930-31 season remains unrivalled, as does 
Blackpool’s 125 conceded in the same season. The most goals scored in a Premier 
League match is still five – achieved by Alan Shearer, Dimitar Berbatov, Andy 
Cole and Jermain Defoe. And despite all the expected advances in sports science 
over the next millennium, the oldest player to feature in the Premier League is 
still the goalkeeper John Burridge turning out for Manchester City against QPR 
in May 1995 at the age of 43 years and 162 days.
