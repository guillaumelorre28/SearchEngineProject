 Fanmail SS17 
Fanmail 

 Once a sustainable T-shirt label, New York’s Fanmail has expanded into 
wardrobe essentials. Fabrics are ethically sourced, cotton is organic, and all 
garments are made in NYC, with details of sources and suppliers printed on 
tags. For SS17 they’ve produced a velour collection for Mr Porter, the zip-up 
track tops from which we love. From £115,fanmail-us.com

Edward Crutchley

 Edward Crutchley is one of British fashion’s rising stars, slowly building a 
reputation for creativity with an emphasis on luxury fabrics. He also 
collaborates with Louis Vuitton on textile designs. They’re not cheap, but when 
you learn that the woven silk satin is British made and that the hand-dyed 
laser cut latex is the most complicated design the suppliers have made in 25 
years, it makes sense. From £700,brownsfashion.com

 De Bonne Fracture SS17

 De Bonne Facture quite literally means something that is well made. This is a 
collection for men who like style that doesn’t shout. Expect premium essentials 
like grandad shirts, relaxed chinos and seersucker jackets. Each piece comes 
with a hang tag with the name, location and history of the atelier that made 
it. From £110,debonnefacture.fr <http://www.debonnefacture.fr>

Castore

 Former athletes, brothers Tom and Phil Beahon started Castore to bring a new 
level of performance to men’s sportswear. Targeting a more discerning gym-goer, 
the label’s attention to detail is key, with each product going through six 
testing samples – twice the industry standard. And what’s more, all garments 
come with a two-year guarantee. From £85,castore.co.uk

Bruta

Artist Arthur Yates started his unisex shirt label, Bruta, three seasons ago – 
a riot of embroidered designs that are whimsical and fun. We love the 
goal-scoring football players and the vintage-look western style, perfect for 
making even grey days feel ice-cream worthy. From £120,harveynichols.com

 Sorensen SS17 
Sorensen

An updated approach to style based around six core archetypes: the driver, 
engineer, dancer, butcher, officer and painter (joined for SS17 by the 
seafarer). Styles riff on historical workwear associated with each character 
type. Think variations like a fluid tunic shirt for the painter and a stricter, 
neater look for the officer. Each season these pieces are added to, building a 
wardrobe for each one. The standout piece for SS17 is the dancer’s on-trend 
pink sweatshirt. From £80matchesfashion.com <http://matchesfashion.com>
