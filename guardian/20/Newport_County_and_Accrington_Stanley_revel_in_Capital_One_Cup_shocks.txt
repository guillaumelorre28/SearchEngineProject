Newport County, who were promoted to League Two via the play-offs in May, 
upset the defeated Championship play-off semi-finalistsBrighton at the Amex 
Stadium, scoring twice in extra-time to win 3-1. Danny Crow, a substitute who 
equalised after Ashley Barnes's opener for the hosts, scored a second before 
Conor Washington put the tie beyond doubt.

Newport's manager said "the gloss was taken off" by his defender Byron Anthony 
suffering a double fracture of his right leg in a challenge involving Iñigo 
Calderón, who was sent off.

Accrington Stanley's manager, James Beattie, praised his "heroic" players 
after the League Two side defeated the Championship'sMiddlesbrough at the 
Riverside. Again the team from the higher division took the lead, through Lukas 
Jutkiewicz, but Stanley level before the break with Marcus Carver's goal and 
snatched it late on with a strike by Piero Mingoia.

"I'm proud of them," said the former England striker Beattie. "We rode our 
luck at times, there's no denying that. There were some real heroic 
performances out there."

The Stevenage manager, Graham Westley, was grateful to his stand-in goalkeeper 
Steve Arnold for a superb display in the 2-0 win overIpswich. Arnold was called 
into the starting XI after Chris Day was injured in the warm-up but he made the 
most of his chance with a string of fine saves as second-half goals by Filipe 
Morais and Jordan Burrow put them through. "You've got to be able to believe in 
your squad and Steve Arnold is a very able and very capable goalkeeper – he did 
very well," said Westley.

Burton and Rotherham also beat higher-division opponents in Sheffield United 
and Wednesday respectively.
