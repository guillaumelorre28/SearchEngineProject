Frutos, who has long been fascinated by Cocteau’s life and imagination. It also 
comes with a dream cast, with Royal Ballet principalsEdward Watson 
<http://www.roh.org.uk/people/edward-watson> and Zenaida Yanowsky 
<http://www.roh.org.uk/people/zenaida-yanowsky> as the deviant siblings 
immersed in their dark and mysterious inner life, and with support from superb 
contemporary dancers including Jonathan Goddard and Clemmie Sveaas.

Shobana Jeyasingh – Material Men redux

In an early version of this piece, Shobana Jeyasingh contrasted the styles and 
personalities of two virtuoso performers: Sooraj Subramaniam and Shailesh 
Bahoran, one trained in classical Indian dance, the other a dynamic hip-hop 
performer. In this longer piece, Jeyasingh works with archive film footage to 
develop their shared family histories in the colonial era.Elena Kats-Chernin 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kats-Chernin>’s score is played live by 
the Smith Quartet.

Crystal Pite

It’s taken a while for the magisterial talent of Crystal Pite 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Pite> to get a proper showing in the UK, 
but next year her work appears on three stages. There’s her debut commission 
for the Royal Ballet, an ensemble piece for 40 dancers, set to Górecki’s 
Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, which matches the epic scale of Emergence, a work 
revived for Scottish Ballet and getting its London premiere in the summer. 
Finally, there’s a return showing ofBetroffenheit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/01/betroffenheit-review-human-suffering-transformed-into-heroic-brilliance>
, the transfixing, scouring study of grief and redemption she created with 
actor Jonathon Young. Grab tickets while you can.

Company Chordelia and Solar Bear – Lady Macbeth: Unsex Me Here 

Kally Lloyd-Jones <http://www.kallylloydjones.com/> deserves to be far more 
widely known outside her native Scotland: her beautifully imagined works tunnel 
deep into familiar stories and characters, throwing up new gems of insight. In 
Lady Macbeth, she works with three male performers to create a portrait of 
Shakespeare’s most unsettling heroine, exploring issues of guilt, power and the 
potent collision of masculine and feminine forces.
