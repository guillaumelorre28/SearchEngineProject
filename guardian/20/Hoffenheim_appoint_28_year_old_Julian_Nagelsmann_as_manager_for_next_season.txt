The club sacked Markus Gisdol on Monday, appointing the 61-year-old Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> veteran Huub Stevens 
as his successor until the end of the campaign, with the Dutchman tasked with 
keeping struggling Hoffenheim up.

“We know this is a courageous step but we see in him [Nagelsmann] such a huge 
coaching talent that we want to give him a prospect,” said the Hoffenheim 
sports director, Alexander Rosen, who confirmed Nagelsmann had been given a 
three-year deal.

Briefly an assistant coach during the 2012-13 campaign, Nagelsmann will remain 
with the Under-19s until the end of the season as he continues studying for his 
senior coaching licence.

“I am looking forward to a very tempting task and I would like to thank 
everybody for the trust and the opportunity given to me,” Nagelsmann, who 
coached Hoffenheim’s junior team to the 2014 German title, said in a club 
statement.

Hoffenheim, backed by the billionaire Dietmar Hopp, are in 17th place with one 
win and six points from their first 10 games of the season.
