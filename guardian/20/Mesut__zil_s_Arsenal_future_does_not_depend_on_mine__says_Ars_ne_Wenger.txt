Arsène Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger> has 
insisted that his own future will not form the “main part” of Mesut Özil’s 
decision as to whether to extend his contract with Arsenal.

The Germany midfielder is, alongside Alexis Sánchez, one of two key Arsenal 
players whose contracts at the club have 18 months left to run. The renewal of 
any deal has been the subject of much debate this season and Özil gave an 
interview in Germany this week in whichhe said his future would depend on 
whether Wenger himself stayed at the club

“I think [the interview] has been a bit misinterpreted,” Wenger said. “He 
would like to know what happens on the managerial front of course, but I don’t 
think that is the main part of his decision. It is part of it, but it’s not the 
only thing. There are many other ingredients in any negotiation and hopefully 
we will find a conclusion very quickly with him.”

It is thought that Özil is closer to agreeing terms with Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> than Sánchez, but Wenger refused 
to put a time frame on negotiations. “We do not master that situation alone,” 
was Wenger’s chosen expression. “Let’s not forget that all these players have 
18 months to go that’s a very long time in football. I’m very relaxed about the 
situation.”

In other transfer news, Wenger rejected out of hand reports that Arsenal had 
bid for the Italy striker Andrea Belotti. He denied Arsenal had made a bid, 
adding “that is what you call today fake news”. He did, however, concede that 
the full-back Carl Jenkinson could leave the club, with Crystal Palace the most 
likely destination.

“It’s a possibility that Carl will move in the next two or three days,” Wenger 
said. “It’s possible that it’s just a matter of time but I can’t tell you any 
more because we haven’t come to any conclusion yet.”

When pressed as to whether Palace was the likely destination he said. “You 
look well informed.”
