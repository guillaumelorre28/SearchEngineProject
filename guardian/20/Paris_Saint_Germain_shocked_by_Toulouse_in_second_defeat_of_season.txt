Toulouse <https://www.theguardian.com/football/toulouse> are now second on 14 
points, trailing Nice on goal difference before the leaders travel to Nancy on 
Sunday.

PSG, without Hatem Ben Arfa after the forward was omitted from the squad for 
the fourth match in a row by the coach, Unai Emery, were nervy after having 
Serge Aurier sent off in the 46th minute.

The visitors made a cautious start to the game but soon upped the pace and 
went close three times before the break.

The goalkeeper Alban Lafont denied Edinson Cavani from point-blank range with 
a superb save on the half-hour.

Cavani then connected with Maxwell’s 41st-minute cross following a sweeping 
move but Lafont parried the Uruguayan’s header.

Three minutes later Aurier’s header was cleared from under the bar by the 
defender Christopher Jullien.

Toulouse were the stronger team at the beginning of the second half and 
Bodiger converted a penalty in the 48th minute after Aurier fouled Ola Toivonen 
and picked up his second yellow card.

The PSG forward Javier Pastore went on for the Brazilian Lucas in the 57th 
minute but made little impact.

Durmaz put the result beyond doubt 11 minutes from time by beating keeper 
Alphonse Areola from close range after intercepting a poor Thiago Motta pass.

Monaco, handed their first defeat by Nice on Wednesday, can go top by beating 
Angers on Saturday.
