Hearts also confirmed the approach ahead of their game with Rangers, where a 
win would send the Jambos second in the Scottish Premiership.

“The club can confirm that MK Dons have made an official approach to Heart of 
Midlothian in relation to head coach Robbie Neilson,” read a statement.

“Robbie is aware of the approach but he remains fully focused on the immediate 
task at hand, which is of course, Rangers at home on Wednesday.

“No further comment or statement will be made by the club until after this 
match.”

Neilson has been in charge at Hearts since 2014 and has won 61 of his 105 
games, losing 22. He won the Scottish Championship in his first season and 
guided Hearts to third in the Premiership last season.

The 36-year-old also made 249 appearances for the club as a player between 
1996 and 2009, winning the Scottish Cup in 2006, before joining Leicester City.

Robinson left the Dons in October after just over six years at the club 
following a poor start to the season and the club are two points above the 
relegation zone after a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers Coventry on Saturday.

The former Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard held talks over the vacancy but 
claimed it was “too soon” for him to move into management.
