It’s a tough time to be an English football fan. The country is ridden with 
divisions

; theteam was been booted out of Euro 2016 by Iceland

; theplayers have been vilified by the press

; and thefans have been condemned for the violent acts of a minority

 in France.

You would be forgiven for thinking that the English are a tribe of 
isolationist, head-in-the-sand xenophobes who want nothing to do with Europe 
and are only interested in football for the fighting. But there’s more toEngland
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> than that. And there’s more to 
the football supporters who went to France this summer.

We set out to find the romance in international football and to show 
unequivocally that, whatever the political situation, Europe is stronger 
together and football is a beautiful vehicle for uniting people from all walks 
of life. We watched six matches in six days at six cities, and this is what we 
found.
