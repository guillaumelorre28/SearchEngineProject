Mark Cooper and Simon Grayson have urged their Swindon and Preston players to 
forget the past and focus on the present in Sunday’sLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> play-off final at 
Wembley. Swindon have failed on three occasions to win promotion to the second 
tier via the play-offs – in 2004, 2010 and 2013 – while Preston’s anguish runs 
deeper, having lost all nine of the previous play-offs they have contested.

“If I can give them one bit of advice, it would be that they need to play the 
game,” said Swindon’s Cooper. “They just need to play the game. This is a 
normal game. It’s not a cup final. It’s a league game and we need a win. That 
win can change everyone’s lives at the football club and they can get that win 
by just playing the game, not worrying about who’s in the Royal Box, not 
worrying about Aunty Irene in the stand and waving.”

Grayson has guided Blackpool, Leeds and Huddersfield out of League One and his 
sentiments are the same. “It’s going to be who handles the day,” he said. “Who 
handles the occasion, who has that little bit of luck here and there andwho 
takes their chances

 when they come along. The players must make sure they give their all and 
remain focused on what they need to do.

“Don’t get carried away with the whole day rather than what’s actually going 
to be happening on the pitch. They need to carry out the instructions on what 
we’ve worked on already, play the game and not the occasion.”
