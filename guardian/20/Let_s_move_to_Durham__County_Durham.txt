What’s going for it? Is it silly to move somewhere just because of one 
building? I think I could, you know. I’m an archi-geek, so perhaps more 
predisposed to being intoxicated by a smashing guildhall or a stately home. But 
still:Durham Cathedral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/durham-cathedral-opens-hidden-treasures-and-spaces-to-public>
, what a place. As buildings go, this is as good as it gets, equal to the 
Alhambra, the Pantheon or the Parthenon. Walk in and you’re beamed back to a 
time of monks and border raids, when Durham was the heart of a rather different 
northern powerhouse. I could move my bed, desk and a Baby Belling into the 
north aisle this second, though I doubt the bishop (or my wife, or my kids) 
would approve. The cathedral does dominate the city. Without it, Durham would 
be a pleasant, undemanding market town, albeit beautifully sited on a wooded 
loop of the river Wear and with a fine university attached. With it, though... 
Wow! But madness, right? Right?

The case against It’s a small city, constrained by its geography, so urbanites 
might get bored.

Well connected? Trains: Newcastle (15-20 minutes), York (45 minutes), 
Edinburgh (one hour 50), and London King’s Cross (three hours). Driving: half 
an hour to Newcastle, the Pennines or the coast.

From the streets

Lesley Aers “A big stock of late Victorian terraces, but most of these have 
been bought by landlords to let to students. This means good family houses are 
occupied for only half the year.”

Jean Rogers “The city population is 50% students: party town one half of the 
year, ghost town the other.”
