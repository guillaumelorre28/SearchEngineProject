Claire Williams, the deputy team principal of Williams, acknowledged 
negotiations have taken longer than seemed likely but said it would “not be 
nice to stop a driver who has such a great opportunity”.

She said: “It has been dragging on and I think everyone wants to know. It is a 
great opportunity for Valtteri and he has given a lot to Williams.

“We’ve always said if we can make this happen on terms that are positive for 
Williams then it is probably the right thing to do.

“No one needs or wants a driver in your team that really wants to be somewhere 
else. It is not nice either to stop a driver who has such a great opportunity, 
particularly at this point of Valtteri’s career, but it has to work for 
Williams and that is what we’ve been working hard on over the past six weeks.

“We are nearly there; we are at the tail end of it and hope we’ll be able to 
make an announcement this coming week.”

The 35-year-old Felipe Massa is thought most likely

 to make a Formula One comeback at Williams if Bottas moves on.

Williams also indicated their interest in signing Paddy Lowe, formerly of 
Mercedes, as technical director.

“Of course someone like Paddy, now that he is available, is going to be 
appealing to us,” she said. “He started his career at Williams – and what team 
wouldn’t want someone like Paddy Lowe?”
