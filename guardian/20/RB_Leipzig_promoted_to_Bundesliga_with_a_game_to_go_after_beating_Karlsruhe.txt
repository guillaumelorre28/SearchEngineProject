RB Leipzig <https://www.theguardian.com/football/red-bull-leipzig> became the 
second club to secure promotion to the Bundesliga after beating Karlsruhe 2-0 
to clinch runner-up spot in the second division. They joined the champions, 
Freiburg, in the top flight with a game to spare.

Emil Forsberg put them ahead six minutes after the restart to kick off 
celebrations in the stands.

An own goal from the goalkeeper Ren√© Vollath in the 86th minute made sure the 
young club, controlled by the Austrian energy drink company Red Bull, would 
play in the top division next season.

With tears in his eyes the coach Ralf Rangnick, formerly in charge of Schalke 
04, was mobbed by his players after the final whistle.

Leipzig were made to sweat for promotion after failing to win their last three 
matches, but the victory on Sunday opened up a five-point lead over 
third-placed Nuremberg with one match left. Nuremberg will play in a 
promotion/relegation playoff with the 16th-placedBundesliga

RB Leipzig have been big spenders for several seasons as they climbed the 
divisions,irking many other clubs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/06/rb-leipzig-sending-shockwaves-through-german-football>
, who have accused them of being little more than a marketing ploy for Red Bull.

They moved up from the fifth tier in 2009 to the second tier in 2014, winning 
promotion three times in five seasons.

Under German football rules they cannot be called Red Bull Leipzig and are 
officially known as RasenBallsport Leipzig or RB Leipzig.
