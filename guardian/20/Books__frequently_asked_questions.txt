 <>What's a list?

What are you reading? What are your favourite books? Which books do you think 
are overrated?

You can now make lists of these subjects and more on guardian.co.uk by 
searching for books <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/query> and 
clicking the 'add to list' button that appears in search results, on book pages 
and on author pages.

The titles of the lists currently available to you are:

• My summer reading
• To read
• Reading it
• I've read it
• Favourite books
• 100 must-read novels
• Overrated books
• Books I've reviewed
• Books to buy
• Favourite non-fiction-books
• Crime fiction to read before you die



 <>Can I share my list?

Yes. Each list you create will be public and have its own unique URL, so you 
can share it on Facebook, Twitter and other websites, or email them to people.



 <>Can I import a list from elsewhere?

We don't currently offer the option to import a list.



 <>How do I add a book to my list?

First, you have to sign in to your guardian.co.uk account 
<https://id.guardian.co.uk/signin>. If you don't already have an account, click 
here to register <https://id.guardian.co.uk/register>.

Find a book <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/query> you'd like to 
add to a list and click the "add to list" button that appears in search 
results, on book pages and on author pages.

When you click the "add to list" button you will be presented with a selection 
of list titles. Check the box next to the list(s) you want to add the book to.

Once you have clicked save, you should see a message telling you that you have 
successfully added the book to your list.



 <>Can I create my own list title?

Currently we are only able to offer pre-defined list titles.



 <>Can I add a book to more than one list?

You can add a book to as many of the lists as you like. When you're signed in 
you can edit lists to change the order or delete books from a list.



 <>How do I find my lists?

When you are signed in to your Guardian account, you will see your email 
address in the top lefthand corner of the screen. Click on the arrow next to 
this and select "Your lists" to see an index page of all the lists you have 
added books to.

everyone.

Reviews



 <>How do I write a book review?

Sign in to your guardian.co.uk account <https://id.guardian.co.uk/signin> and 
search for the book <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/query> you'd 
like to review. Clicking on the "review" button will take you to the review 
form on the dedicated page for your chosen book.

Type in a heading for your review and, if you want to, add a star rating. Then 
type (or paste) your review into the text box. You can use the buttons above 
the box to make text bold or italic, or mark a section of the text as a 
blockquote. You can also embed links to other sites by selecting text and 
clicking the "link" button.

Once you are happy with your review, click the "post" button to publish it.



 <>I've posted a review, can I edit it?

Be sure to read through your review carefully before posting it, as there is 
no edit function.



 <>Are reviews moderated?


If you see a user review that you feel does not comply with our community 
standards <http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards> you can alert the 
moderators by clicking the "report" button beside the review.



 <>Where will my review be published?


Reviews will be published on the dedicated page for your chosen book on 
guardian.co.uk, along with all other reviews for that book. You will also be 
able to find the reviews on your guardian.co.uk profile page.



 <>Can anyone write a review?


Anyone with a Guardian user account can write a review. If you don't have an 
account,click here to register <https://id.guardian.co.uk/register>.



 <>What's the difference between writing a review and joining a comment thread?


Comment threads are attached to features, Guardian and Observer book reviews, 
some news stories, blog posts and other editorial content, and allow readers to 
discuss the points raised in the piece. A review is your response to the book 
of your choice and, crucially, does not have to be in response to something we 
have published eg a critic's review.



 <>Will well-written reviews be recognised or rewarded in any way?


We will feature the reviews we have enjoyed reading in various places on the 
books front page <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books>.



 <>Is there anything I can do if a review is inaccurate or malicious?


If you see any user content that you feel does not comply with our community 
standards <http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards> you can alert the 
moderators by clicking the "report" button beside the review.

What's the difference between star-rating and reviewing?

You can give a star rating to your chosen book at the top of its dedicated 
book page without having to write a review – just click the "add your rating" 
link beneath the stars at the top of the page.

.

You don't need to be signed in to leave a star rating.

You can also add a star rating when you write a review, by clicking on the 
stars in the review box.

You can change your star rating by revisiting the page for a particular book 
at any time, as long as you are signed in.

Search



 <>What's an ISBN?


Every book has a unique ISBN and it stands for international standard book 
number. Our search recognises the 13-digit ISBN.



 <>How do I search by ISBN?


Type the 13-digit ISBN into the search box 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/query> and make sure the "search 
all (including ISBN)" button is selected.



 <>Why can't I find the book I want to review?


Try searching by 13-digit ISBN (see above). If you don't have the book to 
hand, book sites such as Amazon list ISBNs on each book page. If you are still 
unable to find the the book you want, please emailuserhelp@guardian.co.uk 
<mailto:userhelp@guardian.co.uk>

You can also improve your search results by searching by title or author only, 
using the buttons beneath the search box.

We use data from Nielsen to power our search. While we have access to millions 
of records of English-language books, there may occasionally be a book that is 
unavailable. If this is the case please let us know.
