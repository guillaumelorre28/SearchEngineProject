 in the Champions League in midweek with only Ronaldo, Pepe and Casemiro 
keeping their places.

The Brazilian right-back Danilo was booed by the home fans for his 
disappointing display at Wolfsburg when he came on in the second half but it 
was an otherwise positive afternoon for Real, who host Wolfsburg in their 
quarter-final second leg on Tuesday.

James was criticised for being caught laughing on the sidelines in Germany in 
midweek but the Colombia international lifted the crowd by scoring early on, 
his first goal in just under two months.

A fine piece of skill from Ronaldo allowed Vázquez to pass the ball into an 
empty net in the 18th minute before the record-breaker finished off a cutback 
from the lively Jesé a minute later. Ronaldo returned the favour for the 
23-year-old in the 39th minute as Real made it 4-0.

Eibar’s top scorer, Borja Baston, hit the crossbar in a rare attack for the 
visitors.
