RIP the shiny fitted kitchen. Goodbye wonky cupboard doors, farewell dodgy 
chrome fittings.Uncommon Projects <http://www.uncommonprojects.co.uk/> is a 
design company that is changing what we expect from a kitchen – with 
modernist-inspired designs and lots of plywood.

Eames made plywood splints in the Second World War – you can see a direct line 
to their chairs

“Plywood is an honest material,” says Alan Drumm. He’s sitting beside his 
business partner, James Hoy, in his own kitchen, a pleasing L-shaped design 
with sliding cork doors, each cupboard opening via a discreet recessed handle. 
Before they set up the company five years ago, Drumm was working as an 
architect on huge commissions (he says his last project, a private hospital, 
“stripped years off my life”), and Hoy was at a design company making tiny 
cereal packet toys. Both were “masters of detail”.

Today, their bespoke plywood furniture (projects start around £8,000) is so in 
demand that they have a full team, with commissions usually coming fromInstagram

on aMaggie’s Centre in Oldham

, and have been shortlisted for theDesigner Kitchen & Bathroom awards.

But for Drumm and Hoy, it’s all about the material. “Plywood has a rich 
history in design,” Drumm says, reaching for a heavy Le Corbusier catalogue.

to their classic chairs, and plywood’s use as a 60s building material,” Drumm 
says.

Plywood is made up of thin strips of wood laid in alternating directions and 
bonded with glue into sheets. Because of this construction method, it’s less 
susceptible to expansion and shrinkage, and remains an enduring (and relatively 
cheap) material. “You can join it in ways you can’t do with chipboard, you 
don’t need any little bits of metal, and it never deforms, never warps,” says 
Hoy. “It’s functional first, beautiful second.”

Though their kitchens are not cheap, they’re confident that they are the 
best-value bespoke kitchens you can buy. “I’d put money on it,” says Drumm. 
“And as people are increasingly having to make smaller spaces work, it becomes 
a really sound long-term investment. Especially when you get to an age when 
you’re growing out of Ikea.” Most of us have suffered the irritation of a door 
falling off, or having to buy an expensive fridge to fit into a modular design. 
And all-white kitchens that rarely remain so.

There’s something playful, too, about an Uncommon Project – muted primary 
colours, pieces slotted together like pleasing jigsaw pieces. “We like to push 
boundaries, but we try not to lead the client astray,” they say. Kitchen 
commissions led to living rooms, to offices, bedrooms, a shop, each project 
continuing their modernist aesthetic, their passion for plywood. “But really,” 
adds Hoy, “All we are is a set of details.”
