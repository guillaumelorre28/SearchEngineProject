Stoke have a poor record on Wearside but Mark Hughes will be hoping to return 
to winning ways after last week’s disappointing2-0 home FA Cup defeat to Wolves

correction is needed. Sunderland remain desperate to secure a win that seems 
near essential to sustaining David Moyes’s hopes of escaping relegation.Louise
