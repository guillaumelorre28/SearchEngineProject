Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ford> has reported higher quarterly 
profits driven by a record performance in North America, despite missing Wall 
Street estimates because of higher taxes.

Net income rose to $1.9bn (£1.24bn ) in the third quarter from $1.1bn a year 
ago. After taxes, earnings per share – excluding one-time items – were 45 cents 
a share, one penny short of the consensus analyst estimate. The company said 
the shortfall was due to taxes that came in higher than analysts expected.

Ford and its Detroit-based rival, General Motors, are both now earning the 
bulk of their profits selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the US. The 
average transaction price for an F-series large pickup truck rose about $2,000 
to $42,000 in the latest quarter, Ford chief financial officer Bob Shanks said.

Of Ford’s $35.8bn in automotive revenue, 66% was derived from North America in 
the quarter.

Ford and the United Auto Workers will soon begin contract negotiations in 
which the union is expected to push for a greater share of profits.

Once promising emerging markets such as Brazil have turned into money losers 
for Ford and GM. But Shanks said the company remained optimistic about China, 
and forecast a record fourth quarter in its Asia-Pacific operations.

In the latest quarter, Ford reported pretax profit of $2.7bn in North America, 
lifting profit margins to 11.3% in large part because of strong sales of its 
F-series truck line. The pretax profit for the full company was the same at 
$2.7bn.

Outside of North America, Ford lost $340m before taxes, although the company 
said losses in Europe and South America were narrowing.

Shanks said vehicle sales in China would be unchanged for the year at $24m, 
better than most analysts had expected a few months ago.
