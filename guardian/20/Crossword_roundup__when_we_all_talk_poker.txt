Quite something, no? The most revealing clue is probably this one ...

8ac One squeezed by awful mansion tax: Myleene ultimately probes (12)
[ Roman numeral for “one” inside anag. of “mansion tax” and the last letter 
(“ultimately”) of “Myleene” ]
[ I inside anag. of MANSIONTAXE ]

... for EXAMINATIONS, combining as it does the puzzle’s themes of the “mansion 
tax” and its most high-profile critic, thewell-briefed

... also, the mercenary end of the responses to the Labour policy waft across 
the surface readings of many clues; Klass’s CV is given piecemeal through the 
grid, and Tramp’s mention of that play THE ...

27ac English politician: tax houses uproar (7)
[ abbrev. for “English” + abbrev. for “politician” housed by synonym for 
“test”]
[ E+MP inside TEST ] 

... TEMPEST allows everything to coalesce in this extraordinary clue ...

14ac/28ac/21ac/4d Silly Myleene Klass thrived — financial red herring? How it 
stinks (The 27) (1,4,7,3,4-4,5)
[ anagram of “Myleene Klass thrived financial” ]

... for the Shakespearean line <http://www.bartleby.com/46/5/22.html> A VERY 
ANCIENT AND FISH-LIKE SMELL.

By the way, I thoroughly recommend the current puzzle in the New Statesman and 
will return anon to its topic.

Latter patter

Nimrod – known locally as Enigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
 – managed to confuse mein his Independent clue 
<http://independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_150115.bin> ... 

16d Kept one’s cards close to be just good enough for raised stakes (5,3)
[ synonym for “close”, “staked” by “raised” synonym for “to be just good 
enough for” ]
[ STOP AT containing reverse of DO ] 

... for STOOD PAT. I presumed that the game here was to make the everyday 
phrase seem to work plausibly in a card-playing context. But no!

STAND PAT is, before it is anything else, a piece of poker jargon. A “pat 
hand” is good enough to play without drawing, and to stand pat is, in the words 
of the OED:

(a) In Poker, to play, or declare one’s intention of playing, one’s hand just 
as it has been dealt, without drawing other cards.

But also:

(b) transf. To adhere to an existing state of things or to an avowed policy 
(esp. a high tariff), refusing to consider proposals for change or reform.

And so we get to the sense that’s there in Obama’s inauguration speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-address>
 ...

But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off 
unpleasant decisions – that time has surely passed.

... back when he’d combine Sam Cooke, D-Day and what turns out to be gambling 
lingo to promising effect. What else has poker gifted our lexicon?

Well, “busted” has never been a positive word, but via “flush” it also has the 
additional sense of squandered promise. There’s a fair chance that “po-faced” 
comes to us via the bluffer’s “poker face”. And: poor old poker. A game where 
you bet only your own money, take the consequences on the chin when you lose 
(and, even if you win,consider other options 
<http://www.flushdraw.net/news/faraz-jaka-homeless-loving/>). 

Yet its term for a valuable counter is now used to describe legal entities 
with a different sense of morality – and is also our next challenge. Reader, 
how would you clue BLUE-CHIP?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/jan/12/crossword-roundup-the-truth-about-brass-monkeys#show-all>
 for A MONKEY’S UNCLE. With the notable exception of gleety’s Rabelaisian 
“Blowed semen on a lucky pervert”, many of the submissions were 
uncharacteristically un-blue this time. I especially enjoyed yungylek’s 
sartorial advice “Darned sock - extremely effeminate and unmanly? I’d rethink 
that” and jonemm’s poignant “Nae luck, money’s gone. Unbelievable state of 
affairs”.

The runner-up is steveran’s “Monogram on keys unclear, characters buggered”; 
the winner is Peshwari’s ingenious “If a simian’s where Man came from, I’m one”.

Kudos to Peshwari; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
