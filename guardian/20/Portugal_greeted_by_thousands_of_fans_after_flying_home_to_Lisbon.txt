An open-top bus ride followed as the players met the president, Marcelo Rebelo 
de Sousa, who said he would honour them with an award for distinguished acts of 
public service.

“I have to praise everyone. I will commemorate them with the Order of Merit of 
Commanders – that is a decree that has never been given to the national team,” 
he told the broadcaster RTP.

The former Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who lost against Greece in the 
2004 final hosted by Portugal

praise on the players.
