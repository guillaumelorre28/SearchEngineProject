Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have signed the 
Lorient central defender Lamine Koné for an undisclosed fee. The France-born 
Ivory Coast international has agreed a deal until the end of the 2019-20 season.

Sunderland are second bottom of the Premier League and Sam Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> said: “Strengthening our 
defensive options was a priority and Lamine is a player who has impressed me 
when I’ve seen him play. He is big and strong, attributes you need to play in 
central defence and his arrival will give us healthy competition for places in 
a key position.”

The deal ends a protracted pursuit of Koné for the Premier League’s 
19th-placed team. Allardyce had twice ended his interest in the 26-year-old 
this month, with Sunderland initially cooling on a £5m deal before a loan move 
broke down.

Allardyce has signalled his intention to bring in another defender and an 
attacking player before the end of the transfer window having already signed

.

Sunderland are also monitoring Mathieu Debuchy’s situation at Arsenal as he 
looks for regular football before the Euro 2016 finals, although they face a 
battle with Aston Villa if they are to strike a loan deal.

Sebastián Coates could leave Sunderland with the former Liverpool player 
understood to be the subject of talks with Sporting Lisbon. The midfielder 
Charis Mavrias has joined Fortuna Dusseldorf on loan for the remainder of the 
season. The 21-year-old, who joined Sunderland from Panathinaikos in 2013, made 
only seven senior appearances and scored a single goal.
