How highly do you rate yourself? Find out by answering the questions below on

b) I enjoy showing off

c) I love being the centre of attention

d) I like being the boss

e) I insist other people respect me

This test measures your narcissism: the tendency to think very highly of 
oneself. In classical mythology, Narcissus saw his reflection in a lake and 
fell in love with it – and because this love was doomed to remain unrequited, 
either died of sorrow or killed himself (depending on whether it’s the Greek or 
Roman version).

The average total score on full versions of these tests is 10 out of a 
possible maximum of 25, so if your score was closer to the top end of that 
range, then you have a tendency towards narcissism.

Psychologists have long known that narcissists sometimes act aggressively when 
others put them down. But why? One idea is that narcissists become 
uncomfortable, angry and aggressive when they detect a discrepancy between 
their own positive view of themselves and someone else’s less positive view. 
Support for this “discrepancy” comes from a brain-scanning study which showed 
that narcissists react aggressively to their threatened ego only when brain 
systems responsible for detecting discrepancies are particularly active.

So if you want to challenge a narcissist and live to tell the tale, make sure 
you do so in a way that doesn’t challenge their inflated ego.
