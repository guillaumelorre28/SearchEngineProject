After League Cup – and Premier League – disappointments Everton could do with 
a decent FA Cup run and certainly need to avoid becoming victims of a 
giant-killing. With Keith Curle optimistic his League Two side’s “journey” can 
continue into the fifth round, Roberto Martínez would surely be wise to field a 
strong side in front of a capacity crowd at Brunton Park. However, an upset is 
unlikely asCarlisle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle> last 
defeated a top-flight side in the Cup way back in 1986.Louise Taylor
