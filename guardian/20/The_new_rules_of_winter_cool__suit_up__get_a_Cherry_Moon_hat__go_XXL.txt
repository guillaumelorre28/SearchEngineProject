It’s easy to get lazy in winter. Just get a padded jacket and voice some pithy 
thoughts about the election and you’re set until spring, right? Wrong. It is 
possible to be cool in winter. All you have to do is pretend it’s 1996, 
dry-clean that suit you never wear, get a baseball bat and buy everything in 
XL. Or hell, even XXL. Just let us be your guide …

 Strong suit … Tom Ford Photograph: Araya Diaz/WireImage 
Suit up


For a long time, it felt as if suits had been killed off – the casualty of 
casual dressing. But when Tom Ford talks, we listen. Apparenty, the designer 
and film director wore suits and boots on the set of his new filmNocturnal 
Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/tom-ford-suit-set-film-nocturnal-animals-director>
, proclaiming he felt “weak in trainers”. Take note: smartening up is totally 
that strong-arm emoji.

 Big hint … Raf Simons oversized coat. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock 
Buy everything in XXL


The oversized trend is this season’s overarching look. It can be seen from 
Topshop to Balenciaga, from menswear to womenswear, and, because of its 
flexibility (you can apply it to coats, trousers, jumpers), it probably won’t 
peak. Fashion has caught on, though, so if you want an oversized Raf Simons 
jacket, expect to pay upwards of £3,000 (even Topshop Unique’s tent-like pink 
padded jacket is more than £100). Our tip is to buy everything in XXL. 
Comically oversized. Better still, try menswear XXL.

Show logos


Granted, fashion tends to yo-yo on this one (sometimes it’s no logos on bags, 
sometimes it’s big logos on hoodies), but when it comes to underwear, in this 
post-capitalist, post-consumer, post-post world, logos are deeply cool. As long 
as they’re worn with a smidge of irony. And if flashing your Calvin Klein 
waistband feels a bit trite, try a designer name (Christian Dior) on your bra 
strap (like Bella Hadid) while saying something pithy about post-consumerism.

 Stepping back in time … Old Skool Vans. 
Wear Old Skool Vans 


Yes, Frank Ocean wore Vans to the White House, and the popularity of the “Damn 
Daniel” meme sawa 30% spike in sales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/24/how-vans-became-the-new-stan-smith-trainers#img-3>
. But sorry, Frank, those aren’t the right Vans. The Old Skool – the black ones 
with the squiggle down the side,yours for £52 
<http://www.office.co.uk/view/product/office_catalog/5,21/2421800000> – are 
worn by the frow and on the catwalk for Off-White. They also date back to 1977, 
which provides that stamp of authenticity.

 Cats for cool … a shirt from Silken Favours. 
Do Gucci on a budget


Love the new Gucci look but can’t afford the four-figure prices? Silken 
Favours is your friend. Set up by former model Vicki Murdoch in 2012, its 
designs include cowboy shirts with parrots, and blouses with leopards as 
standard. They might be £265 and up, but they are worth the investment. Not for 
wallflowers.

The Brain is Zeljko Buvac

, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp’s assistant; the Horatio to Klopp’s Hamlet, a 
quiet tactical force with a thousand-yard stare and dark, thick curtains for 
hair. It’s unlikely he sees himself as cool but, as the saying goes, the best 
leaders are those reluctant to lead. To pull off the sports luxe-Brain look, 
you also need a full head of hair, so it doubles as a great humblebrag.

So Called Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/09/my-so-called-life>
. The shearling and layered look worn by Jordan Catalano (played by Jared Leto) 
brings a dash of 90s realness to 2016, while his signature accessory (a choker) 
has popped up as this year’s gender-fluid look. See: Louis Vuitton, Raf 
Simons’s Robert Mapplethorpe collaboration and the Harry Styles shoot in 
Another Man magazine.

Reference Janet Jackson …


After Trump’s “nasty woman” attack on Hillary Clinton propelled Janet’s 1986 
hit Nasty back into the streaming charts, La Jackson herself was spotted in the 
tabloids heavily pregnant in a Y-3 male hoodie, challenging what we thought we 
knew about gender neutrality, modesty and maternity wear. It was a 
triple-whammy fashion moment from the woman who brought us athleisure 
boilersuits (Rhythm Nation), oversize boxy jackets (What Have You Done For Me 
Lately) and much more.

 Cult hero status … River Phoenix. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock 
… or River Phoenix (men) and Nico (women)


Cooly detached, iconic and ultimately self-destructive, River Phoenix and Nico 
fit the brief for cult hero status. Designer Ashley Williams put Phoenix at the 
centre of her latest collection, which riffs on suburban adolescence, and Nico, 
a singer who went from statuesque Teuton to goth goddess, continues to inspire 
with a film of her life having started shooting this year.

Use an analogue face mask


It is with a healthy does of scepticism that we pop this here because no face 
mask can ever replace the benefits of getting enough sleep and drinking plenty 
of water, but they can come close. It started with the SK-II, a pricey, 
super-luxe mask that erased any extracurriculars from the night before, but 
similar masks are now available from Garnier for a few quid. Justin Bieber uses 
them. So does Cristiano Ronaldo. Downside: you’ll resemble a damp Michael 
Myers; upside: that’s very Instagrammable.

Light your Instagrams with pink and blue


Pantone’s colour of 2016 <http://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2016> was 
Rose Quartz and Serenity, a sunset burst of pink and blues that perfectly

Raise your accessory game


Accessories are a natural entry-point into fashion. The thing to remember is 
that not all accessories need to have a point. Why line Gucci loafers with fur 
if not for the lols? Why not pretend your phone is a packet ofantidepressants

 video without ruffling a hem of her Gucci dress. Margot Robbie carried one in
Suicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/13/suicide-squad-spellbound-women-psychiatrists-film>
, making her an antihero with an edge. And, of course, fans ofThe Walking Dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/walking-dead-season-7-death-scene-leak>
 will know the part “Lucille” has played this season.

 World domination … Topman bomber jacket. 
Customise your bomber jacket


Bomber jackets are the grey squirrels of fashion. In whatever form – badged at 
Topman, shearling at Louis Vuitton – they are so ubiquitous they risk taking 
over the coat world. If you don’t already have one, then customised bomber 
jackets are your way in. Try Cinq à Sept or Gabriel Bruce’s merch bombers, 
which come emblazoned with “Come All Sufferers” (Florence Welch is a fan).

Layer like you mean it


This season, menswear dressing is all about being an onion. Here, maximalism 
simply means wearing the same item twice. Try experimental layering – wear two 
shirts (one short-sleeved, one long) or play with double-jacketing.

 Bags of style … Idea’s Winona bag. 
Carry a Winona bag


This has been the year of Winona Ryder’s comeback, thanks to her standout role 
inStranger Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/15/stranger-things-review-a-shot-of-80s-nostalgia-right-to-your-heart-winona-ryder>
. The understated way to pay tribute is with the Winona bag, created by Idea 
Books, the rare books store and publishing house set up by Angela Hill and 
David Owen in 2010, now boasting 265,000 followers on Instagram and a 
publishing deal with cult French label Vetements. Wearing the Winona bag 
(currently sold out) orT-shirt 
<http://www.ideanow.online/store#!/WINONA-T-Shirt-WHITE/p/65415820/category=19124322>
 shows that you are a) a fan of Winona and b) in on the Idea books thing. Two 
cool boxes ticked.

Laugh in the face of practicality


Question: how do you turn a jacket that might be familiar to a Millets shopper 
into something fashion? Answer:wear it in a weird way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/23/padded-down-how-should-you-wear-this-season-jacket>
. That’s the case this winter. Demna Gvasalia is the designer behind turning 
very sensible jackets into something that would be no help in a rain shower, as 
seenat Balenciaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/06/balenciaga-and-celine-catwalk-shows-impress-at-paris-fashion-week>
. Basically, if you wear your padded jacket around your shoulders rather than 
doing it up properly, you’re sorted.

Swap the Kardashian clan for the Smiths


As the Kardashians’ collective starlight begins to dim and Anwar Hadid fails 
to happen, another fashion-royal family is set to make its mark. Lucky Blue 
Smith is “the Mormon model with a million fans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/11/up-all-night-to-get-lucky-blue-smith>
”; now his sisters are everywhere. Daisy Clementine, Starlie Cheyenne and Pyper 
America (not My Little Ponies, despite their names) have collectively modelled 
for Moncler, were on the frow of Dolce and Gabbana and are in a surf-pop band, 
the Atomics. But which one’s the Khloé?

Don’t forget about the 80s …


From Stranger Things to Taylor Swift’s 1989 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/24/taylor-swift-1989-review> to 
Halt and Catch Fire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/half-and-catch-fire-season-three-mad-men>
, pop culture is saturated in DayGlo neon. In fashion terms, we’re hitting peak 
Sloaney party girl. Saint Laurent, House of Holland and Topshop Unique have not 
shied away from the lamé, puffs and power-pop video chic.

… but 1996 is coming up fast


Insiders looking for retro inspiration are gravitating to the 90s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/11/90s-are-back-how-to-get-the-look>
, specifically 1996 – the year cult teen witch movie The Craft came out, the 
Spice Girls ruled the charts and Britpop was still a thing. The fashion 
references are ripe for the taking: seechokers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/17/neck-and-neck-new-ways-to-wear-a-choker>
, trackie tops and those weird platform trainers, all back from the cultural 
dustbin and worn by those born in the year they were last popular.
