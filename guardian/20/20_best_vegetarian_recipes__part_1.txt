Romy Gill’s chana dal with chapati

There are so many different ways of cooking chana dal. My dad worked in the 
steel plant in Burnpur in West Bengal – people came from different states to 
work there, so my growing-up years in India were spent eating the most 
delicious food ever.

Serves 4-6
chana dal 250g
red onions 2 medium
hot water 1 litre
ground turmeric ½ tsp
salt to taste
rapeseed oil 4 tsp
black mustard seeds 1 tsp
garlic 2 tsp, grated
ginger 1 tsp, grated
tomato 1 large, finely chopped
fresh green chillies 2 tsp, chopped with seeds
ground coriander 1 tsp
ground cumin 1 tsp
garam masala ½ tsp
red kashmiri chillies 2 whole

For the chapati
wholemeal or plain flour 200g
lukewarm water 75ml
oil 1 tsp
butter for spreading

Soak the chana dal in cold water for 10 minutes, then wash it in cold water so 
that all the starch comes out.

Finely chop the red onions and keep aside. In a deep pan, on medium heat, cook 
the chana dal in the hot water, adding the turmeric and salt, for 30 minutes.

In another pan, heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. When they start to 
pop, add the chopped onions and soften slowly, taking care to make sure all of 
the onions get cooked. Make sure you don’t caramelise them.

Add the grated garlic and ginger and cook for 6-7 minutes on medium heat.

Add the chopped tomato and green chillies and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. 
Keep stirring so that the paste doesn’t get burnt.

Add all the spices along with whole red chillies and mix well. If the paste 
sticks to the base of the pan then add few drops of hot water.

Add the paste to the cooked chana dal. Cover the pan and cook on a very low 
heat for 3-4 minutes.

To make the chapatis, make a well in the middle of the flour in a bowl and 
pour in the water and oil. If the dough feels a little hard, add a few drops 
more water.

Mix into a dough and knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover 
with a tea towel and rest for an hour.

Make 8-10 balls of the dough. Sprinkle flour onto a board and roll out a ball 
to make a thin pancake about 3mm thickness.

Place the dough on a hot pancake pan over medium heat and turn over after 30 
seconds. Cook the second side for 1 minute, until small bubbles form.

Turn again and cook the first side, pressed lightly with a kitchen towel. It 
should start to rise. Make sure it is cooked evenly.

Smear it with butter and wrap it in a kitchen towel to keep warm before 
serving with the chana dal.

This cooking technique for the artichokes is termed ‘à la Grecque’. I like to 
use the smaller pointed variety of artichoke for this – but you can use the 
larger globe-shaped ones if that’s what you have. Lavosh is a flatbread 
originating in the Middle East. It’s easy to make and you can personalise it by 
adding your favourite seeds and spices – here I sprinkle it with sumac. The 
recipe makes more than you need here as it’s hard to make a small quantity. If 
you don’t have time to make it, then serve with crostini or shop-bought lavosh 
instead.


Serves 4 as a main course or 6 as a starter
long-stemmed globe artichokes 8-10 (1kg)
lemon ½, sliced 1cm thick
cider vinegar or other white vinegar 1 tbsp
banana shallot 1, sliced into rings
carrot ½, peeled and sliced
bay leaf 1
fresh hard herbs 1 tbsp (eg thyme, rosemary, oregano, sage)
garlic 1 clove, sliced
olive oil 125ml
water 400ml, plus extra as needed
salt and black pepper
salad leaves a handful (I used pea shoots)
sumac lavosh as much as you like (see below)


For the walnut sauce
walnut halves 50g, toasted
sourdough bread 40g, sliced (crusts left on), toasted then broken into pieces
lemon juice 75ml
lemon zest ½ tsp, finely grated
garlic 2 cloves, sliced
iced water 100ml
salt ½ tsp
olive oil 3½ tbsp

For the sumac lavosh
plain flour 170g, sieved
wholewheat flour 1 rounded tbsp
sugar 1 tsp
fine salt ½ tsp
extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp, plus 1 tsp extra for brushing
iced water 85ml, plus extra if needed
sumac 2 tsp
sea salt flakes for sprinkling

First cook the artichokes. Place the sliced lemon in a large saucepan with the 
cider vinegar, shallot, carrot, bay leaf, herbs and garlic clove. Add the olive 
oil, water, ½ tsp of coarsely ground black pepper and 1½ tsp of salt. Cut the 
stalks off the artichokes 6-8cm from the base. Remove the lower leaves until 
you can feel them becoming more tender – this usually means removing the outer 
two or three layers, using either your fingers or a small knife. Using a small 
sharp knife, peel the tough skin from the stalks, working from the cut end 
towards the head, as the stalks are edible and I hate to waste good food! Cut 
through the heads crossways half-way up and discard the top part. Trim any hard 
pieces from the head itself. Cut in half lengthways. Carefully cut out the very 
fine ‘choke’ hairs, or use a small teaspoon to do this. As each artichoke is 
ready, add it to the saucepan and stir to coat in the oil and vinegar to 
prevent it from discolouring. Once all the artichokes are prepared, add, if 
needed, just enough water to come to the top of the artichokes. Lay a paper 
cartouche on top, pressing it down, and poke a few holes in the paper. Bring to 
the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle boil and cook until you can easily 
insert a thick knife through the base and stem of the artichokes, about 12-15 
minutes. Leave to cool in the cooking liquid. They can be prepared up to 4 days 
in advance.

Make the walnut sauce. Place the walnuts, bread pieces, lemon juice and zest, 
garlic, iced water and salt in a small food processor (or use a stick or jug 
blender) and blitz to a puree. Add the oil and blitz again. Taste for seasoning.

To make the sumac lavosh, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Place the 
flours, sugar and salt in a kitchen mixer (a stand mixer rather than a food 
processor) and mix together. With the motor running, add 1 tablespoon of oil 
and the iced water and mix together until a pliable dough is formed. If it’s 
too dry, add a little extra iced water; if too wet, add a little extra 
wholewheat flour.

Mix for 4 minutes on medium-low speed. Take the dough out, roll it on the work 
surface into a ball, then wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes in 
the fridge.

Pull off walnut-sized pieces and roll out on a floured work surface as thin as 
you can. (At my restaurants we run it through our pasta rollers on the second 
thinnest setting.) Lay it on a baking sheet and leave to rest for 20 minutes 
(this will prevent it shrinking too much when baked). Bake until golden, 
turning the tray about 180 degrees after 8 minutes to colour it evenly. The 
lavosh is ready when it has turned dark golden, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and brush with the remaining oil and sprinkle with the 
sumac and some flaky salt while still hot. Once cooled, store in an airtight 
container. The dough freezes well and will last for 4 weeks, so just roll out 
what you need at the time.

To serve, lay the salad leaves on your plates and top with the mozzarella then 
the artichokes. Add some of the carrots, lemon slices and shallots from the 
cooking liquor, then dollop the walnut sauce on top. Finally, tuck in the sumac 
lavosh, broken into large shards.

Ratatouille, properly made without wateriness, is an adaptable and excellent 
dish. The ingredients can be adjusted to availability or your own pocket and it 
can be eaten hot or cold.

Ratatouille is a Provençal word, first recorded in the 18th century, though it 
is probably a good deal older than that. It is a cross betweentatouiller and 
ratouiller which, as the dictionary says, are expressive forms of touller, an 
old verb from the Latintudiculare, meaning to stir and crush.

Serves 8-10
aubergines 500g
courgettes 500g
salt
tomatoes 500g, skinned
sweet peppers 2-3
onions 2-3 large, sliced
olive oil 4 tbsp
garlic 2 large cloves, chopped
pepper, sugar, vinegar to taste
coriander seeds ¼ tsp, crushed
fresh basil or parsley leaves

Slice the aubergines and courgettes. Put them in a colander, sprinkle with a 
teaspoon of salt and leave for an hour to drain. Pat them dry with kitchen 
paper. Chop the tomatoes roughly. Remove the stalks and seeds from the peppers 
and cut them into strips.

Cook the onion slowly, without browning it, in the olive oil with the garlic. 
As it softens, add the aubergines and peppers. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. 
Put in the tomatoes and courgettes. Season with salt, pepper, and a little 
sugar and vinegar if the tomatoes lack flavour as they often do. Cook steadily 
without covering the pan until all wateriness has disappeared – about 50 
minutes. Ten minutes before the end, add the coriander. The vegetables should 
retain a certain identity, so do not crush them to a puree, although they 
should be stirred vigorously from time to time. Serve hot or cold, sprinkled 
with basil or parsley.

This is wholesome eating at its best. I find it hard to resist piercing the 
flaxen yolk over the plump pulses. Think of chard as two different vegetables 
as the stalks need a little more help than the leaves; cooking the stalks with 
the chickpeas softens their toughness.

Makes 6 small plates
dried chickpeas 300g
onions 3
extra virgin olive oil
dried chilli flakes 1 tsp
coriander seeds 2 tsp
salt
celery 2 sticks
carrot 1
garlic 3 cloves
Swiss chard 1 bunch
bay leaf 1
white wine 175ml
plum tomatoes 1 x 400g tin
malt vinegar a splash
eggs 6 medium, at room temperature
black pepper to taste

Put the chickpeas in a large bowl, cover with cold water and soak overnight.

When you are ready to cook, drain and rinse the chickpeas under cold running 
water. Place them in a pan and add water until it covers them by about 2.5cm. 
Peel and halve 1 onion and add it to the pan with a little olive oil, the 
chilli and the coriander seeds.

Bring the chickpeas to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 
checking after 30 minutes. Once the chickpeas are cooked remove them from the 
heat, drain them (reserving the cooking liquor) and season to taste.

Meanwhile peel, halve and dice the remaining 2 onions. Put the onions in a 
heavy-bottomed pan with a glug of olive oil and a good pinch of salt, cover 
with the lid and cook slowly over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring 
occasionally.

While the onions are cooking, peel, halve and dice the celery and carrot. 
Submerge the garlic cloves in warm water and leave for a few minutes – this 
will help the skin to pop off easily. Then cross-chop or use a pestle and 
mortar to mash the garlic with a good pinch of salt until it becomes paste-like.

Rinse the chard under cold running water and trim the ragged stalk ends. Using 
a small knife, remove the stalks from the leaves following their natural shape. 
Roughly chop the stalks into thin strips.

After the onions have been cooking for 10 minutes and are soft and tender, 
stir through the celery, carrot, garlic and chard stalks and add the bay leaf. 
Stir through and combine and cook for a further 15 minutes.

Pour over the wine and leave to reduce by half over a medium heat. Add the 
tomatoes and 300ml of the chickpea cooking liquor followed by the drained 
chickpeas. Give the mixture a good stir through and simmer for about 20 minutes 
until almost all the juices have been absorbed into the chickpeas. Season well 
while still warm, then fold through the chard leaves and cover with a pan lid 
to help them wilt into the mixture.

Place a pan of water with a splash of malt vinegar in it over a medium heat 
and bring to a simmer. Crack an egg into a glass or cup. Swirl the water around 
in a circular motion and once the water settles slightly and there is a tornado 
effect in the centre, lower the cup into the middle of the swirl so that it 
almost touches the water and tip the egg out in a quick fluid motion. Lightly 
poach for 3 minutes or until the white is just set. Remove the egg with a 
slotted spoon and drain on kitchen roll before placing on a plate. Repeat the 
poaching process with the remaining eggs. If you’re confident, poach 2 at a 
time.

Ladle the chickpeas into bowls. Place a poached egg on top of each serving of 
chickpeas and finish with a little extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and 
some black pepper.

I find this very special bowl, a fragrant curry of sorts, is the vegetarian 
equivalent of a chicken noodle soup, both for comfort and health benefits. Add 
more coconut cream or milk if you would like more of a soup-y feel; the recipe 
here provides more of a sauce at the base of the bowl. Curry leaves can be 
tricky to find fresh, but are transformative: try Asian food shops, large 
supermarkets and the internet.

Serves 4
carrots 6 small, scrubbed and thickly sliced if on the larger side
parsnips 2, scrubbed and thickly sliced
celeriac 1 small, peeled and roughly chopped
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
coconut oil 3 tbsp
root ginger a thumb
fresh turmeric a thumb
coriander with roots a small handful
shallots 2, finely sliced
black mustard seeds 1 tsp
garlic 1 clove, finely chopped
fresh curry leaves 1 sprig
green cardamom pods 3, lightly crushed
dried red chilli 1
coconut cream 200ml
water 200ml
lime juice of ½
cooked wild rice 200g
red amaranth or Thai basil to serve (optional)

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Spread the root vegetables out in a large 
roasting tin, season well and crumble 2 tablespoons of the coconut oil over 
them (or pour, if it is warm and liquid). Roast for 15 minutes, then use a 
spatula to toss the vegetables, distributing the melted oil evenly. Return to 
the oven for a further 15 minutes or so, until soft and caramelised.

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the ginger and turmeric. Finely chop the 
coriander roots and stalks. Set the coriander leaves aside.

Put the remaining tablespoon of coconut oil in a deep frying pan or medium 
saucepan and set it over a medium-low heat. Add the shallots with a pinch of 
salt and fry gently for a few minutes, stirring now and then.

Increase the heat and cook until they are beginning to catch at the edges, 
then add the mustard seeds and cook for a minute or two; they should pop and 
sizzle. Add the ginger, turmeric, coriander roots and stalks, garlic, curry 
leaves, cardamom and dried chilli, sauteing for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the 
coconut cream with the water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and 
simmer gently for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add the lime 
juice to brighten the flavours.

Divide the roast vegetables between serving bowls with the cooked wild rice. 
Ladle the broth over the top and finish with the coriander leaves and any other 
Asian herbs you have, such as red amaranth or Thai basil.
