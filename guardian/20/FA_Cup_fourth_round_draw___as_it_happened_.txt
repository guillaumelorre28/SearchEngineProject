Is there a special atmosphere to expect if Chelsea would entertain Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>?

asks Michael Schlagenhaufen via email. Yes, Michael, there would be a cracking 
atmosphere at Stamford Bridge but Millwall, as mentioned, will face a really 
difficult task atBradford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford> next 
week after their initial meeting at the Den ended 3-3 on Saturday.

Paul Airey has a valid point about Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united> v Manchester United:

I know this plea will fall on deaf ears, but wouldn’t it be refreshing if 
whoever reports on this fixture avoids the pitfall of writing about “United” if 
who they really mean is the team from Manchester rather than Cambridge?

We live in hope!

And Elliot Carr-Barnsley adds …


Cambridge versus Man U? I smell a punditry call up for Dion Dublin.

Elsewhere, among several standard and uninspiring fixtures, if Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win tonight Emile Heskey will 
be returning to Anfield in a Bolton shirt …

On that note, I’m off. Do pop over to AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool – live with 
Jacob Steinberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jan/05/afc-wimbledon-v-liverpool-fa-cup-live>
. Bye!

Well there you go. One guaranteed highlight – Cambridge United v Manchester 
United – and a couple of potentially tasty derbies: Chelsea v Millwall (if they 
beat Bradford in a replay, which is of course no easy task) and Birmingham City 
vWest Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom>

Quick “big up” for Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united>. Back in the Football 
League after a nine year absence, and in the fourth-round for the first time in 
fifteen years. Glory days. Would settle for a rerun of the rehearsal in the 
draw, albeit at the Abbey.

Yes, big up indeed – always great to see big teams having to step out of their 
comfort zone.

There is something terrible about the draw being made with eight teams still 
to play their third round fixture (not including replays). Then again, who had 
the bright idea of puttingEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>
 v West Ham on a Tuesday night? Such silliness.

Lawrie Sanchez, who was part of the victorious Wimbledon team in 1988, and 
Stef Loucaides, a local grassroots football coach, will be making tonight’s 
draw.

In the trial, Manchester City were drawn at home to Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united>, the lowest ranked team 
left in the competition.

Here we go, then. The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
fourth round draw – almost but not quite as good as the third round draw on the 
basis that there are fewer chances of a major shock.

Then again, there hasn’t been a giantkilling yet (step up AFC Wimbledon, who 
take on Liverpool right after these balls are pulled out of a drum?). Wrexham 
promised a surprise until Stoke’s Stephen Ireland ruined it, Sheffield 
Wednesday led at Man City briefly while Blyth Spartans threatened to upset 
Birmingham and Southport were denied in desperately late circumstances at Derby.
Sheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited>, on the 
basis of their outstanding record in knockout competitions, winning at a QPR 
side whose priorities lie elsewhere was hardly a shock. It pains to say, the 
#magicofthecup has not been all that magic so far.

Nevermind, we live in hope, eh?

Is there a special atmosphere to expect if Chelsea would entertain Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>?

asks Michael Schlagenhaufen via email. Yes, Michael, there would be a cracking 
atmosphere at Stamford Bridge but Millwall, as mentioned, will face a really 
difficult task atBradford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford> next 
week after their initial meeting at the Den ended 3-3 on Saturday.

Paul Airey has a valid point about Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united> v Manchester United:

I know this plea will fall on deaf ears, but wouldn’t it be refreshing if 
whoever reports on this fixture avoids the pitfall of writing about “United” if 
who they really mean is the team from Manchester rather than Cambridge?

We live in hope!

And Elliot Carr-Barnsley adds …


Cambridge versus Man U? I smell a punditry call up for Dion Dublin.

Elsewhere, among several standard and uninspiring fixtures, if Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win tonight Emile Heskey will 
be returning to Anfield in a Bolton shirt …

On that note, I’m off. Do pop over to AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool – live with

Douglas Hawthorn has been in contact via email:

Quick “big up” for Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united>. Back in the Football 
League after a nine year absence, and in the fourth-round for the first time in 
fifteen years. Glory days. Would settle for a rerun of the rehearsal in the 
draw, albeit at the Abbey.

Yes, big up indeed – always great to see big teams having to step out of their 
comfort zone.

There is something terrible about the draw being made with eight teams still 
to play their third round fixture (not including replays). Then again, who had 
the bright idea of puttingEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>
 v West Ham on a Tuesday night? Such silliness.
 
While we wait for the draw, why not pay Jacob Steinberg a visit over on the 
AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool MBM 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jan/05/afc-wimbledon-v-liverpool-fa-cup-live>
? Just promise you’ll come back in 10 minutes, ok?

Lawrie Sanchez, who was part of the victorious Wimbledon team in 1988, and 
Stef Loucaides, a local grassroots football coach, will be making tonight’s 
draw.

In the trial, Manchester City were drawn at home to Cambridge United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united>, the lowest ranked team 
left in the competition.
 
Here we go, then. The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
fourth round draw – almost but not quite as good as the third round draw on the 
basis that there are fewer chances of a major shock.

Then again, there hasn’t been a giantkilling yet (step up AFC Wimbledon, who 
take on Liverpool right after these balls are pulled out of a drum?). Wrexham 
promised a surprise until Stoke’s Stephen Ireland ruined it, Sheffield 
Wednesday led at Man City briefly while Blyth Spartans threatened to upset 
Birmingham and Southport were denied in desperately late circumstances at Derby.
Sheffield United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited>, on the 
basis of their outstanding record in knockout competitions, winning at a QPR 
side whose priorities lie elsewhere was hardly a shock. It pains to say, the 
#magicofthecup has not been all that magic so far.

Nevermind, we live in hope, eh?
