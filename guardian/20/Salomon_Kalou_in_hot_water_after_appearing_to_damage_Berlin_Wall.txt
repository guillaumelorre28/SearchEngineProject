The former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou may be facing a hefty fine after 
appearing to deface theBerlin Wall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/berlinwall> with a hammer and chisel during 
a television news report.

The 29-year-old Kalou, who plays for Hertha Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin>, was attempting to compare 
breaking off a piece of the wall with his intentions to break down the Schalke 
defence.

The wall, which divided Berlin between 1961 and 1989, is a protected monument, 
dating back to the fall of the German Democratic Party in 1991, and anyone 
found guilty of defacing it could face a fine of up to €10,000 (£7,145).

Authorities in Berlin are reportedly set to inspect whether any damage was 
done following a complaint from Kani Alavi, the chairman of the Eastside 
Gallery, which owns the copyright to the graffiti on the wall.

“I nearly fell off the sofa when I saw the footage,” Alavi told the Berliner 
Kurier newspaper 
<http://www.berliner-kurier.de/hertha-bsc/rote-karte-fuer-hertha-bsc-star-salomon-kalou--hier-haut-er-sich-ein-teures-eigentor-rein,7168990,30133830.html>
. “Here we have a well-paid celebrity increasing his market value at the 
expense of a national monument. Without respect. And with the clear backing of 
television.

“Just because there is no security patrolling the Gallery, doesn’t mean you 
can go around doing what you want. If he had done that at the Brandenburg Gate, 
the player would probably have been arrested.”

Hertha Berlin and Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> drew 
2-2 on Saturday but Kalou was unable to find the net.
