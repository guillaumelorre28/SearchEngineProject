Alonso still has a year left to run on his contract at McLaren but that has 
not stopped the Mercedes head of motorsport, Toto Wolff, from publicly 
speculating about tempting the two-times world champion to his team.

“You have to consider Fernando,” Wolff told Sky Sports. “He is a driver I 
respect a lot. He combines talent, speed and experience. It’s all there. But he 
is in a contract with McLaren-Honda at the moment and we just need to weigh all 
the other options up.”

Testing is due to start in February and Mercedes – thrown by the speed of 
Rosberg’s retirement – will need to act quickly in order to secure a new driver 
to race alongside Lewis Hamilton. Alonso has teamed up with Hamilton in the 
past at McLaren but they endured a difficult relationship, with Alonso 
eventually leaving at the end of the 2007 season after the pair had stopped 
talking to one another.

The young German former Mercedes test driver Pascal Wehrlein, 22, remains a 
more realistic option for Wolff, who insists both his drivers will share top 
billing. He could be used to keep the Mercedes seat warm for Alonso for a year 
until his contract comes up. Another possibility is the Williams driver 
Valtteri Bottas, the Finn who is managed by Wolff.

“We will maintain the system we have,” Wolff said. “Both drivers will have 
equal status and equal opportunity to the best of our abilities. We owe it to 
the fans. You can’t have a pecking order.”
