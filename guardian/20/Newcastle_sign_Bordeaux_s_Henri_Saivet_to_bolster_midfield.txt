capture of theBordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> 
midfielder Henri Saivet.

The 25-year-old Senegal international

undisclosed fee, understood to be in the region of £5m, on a 
five-and-a-half-year contract.

Saivet said: “I am very happy to be here at Newcastle. I am really proud to be 
able to play for this club and I am really excited at the challenge that lies 
ahead. St James’ Park is a really impressive and special stadium. In France 
there is nothing that compares to this and I can’t wait to get out there and 
help the team climb the table.”

Newcastle are 18th in the Premier League and have lost their last four games 
in all competitions 1-0

. McClaren will hope Saivet, who started his career as a winger but has played 
in central midfield for Bordeaux this season, is the first of several players 
to arrive at St James’ this month.

He said: “Henri is someone the club has been watching for a while and he has 
developed into an excellent player at Bordeaux. This is someone with a very 
good mentality, who is a tough player and a winner. Those are key qualities you 
need in the Premier League.”

Saivet came through the ranks at Bordeaux, making his senior debut at 17 and 
going on to score 23 goals in 178 appearances.
