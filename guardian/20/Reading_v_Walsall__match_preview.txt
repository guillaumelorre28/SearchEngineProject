Walsall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/walsall> travel to the Madejski 
Stadium with the manager, Sean O’Driscoll, challenging his side to put on a 
performance similar to that in the previous round against Brentford and prove 
they can defeat a Championship side again. However, last year’s semi-finalists, 
Reading, have the returning trio of Michael Hector, Stephen Quinn and captain 
Paul McShane back in contention and Brian McDermott will be confident his side 
can repeat the previous campaign’s heroics.Charlie Dear
