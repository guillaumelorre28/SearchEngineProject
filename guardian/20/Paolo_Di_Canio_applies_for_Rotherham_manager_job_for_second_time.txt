<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/01/paolo-di-canio-sunderland-sacking>

He also wanted the job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/30/paolo-di-canio-reject-rotherham-united>
 at the New York Stadium in September after Steve Evans was sacked, though did 
not get an interview.

Di Canio left Sunderland after a whirlwind 13 games at the Stadium of Light 
where, after initially keeping them in the Premier League and famously 
mastermindinga 3-0 Tyne-Wear derby success 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/14/newcastle-sunderland-premier-league-match-report>
 over Newcastle in the 2012-13 campaign, things turned sour the following 
season, with reports of a player revolt. He exited after taking just one point 
from the opening five games of the season.

Another out-of-work coach in the north east is also interested in the job. The 
former Newcastle manager John Carver,who called himself “the best coach in the 
Premier League” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/07/newcastle-john-carver-best-coach-premier-league>
, is looking to get back into the game after leaving the Magpies in the summer.

The position in South Yorkshire is vacant after Rotherham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rotherham> fired Redfearn just four 
months into a two-and-a-half-year deal. The former Leeds boss paid the price 
for back-to-back defeats against their Championship rivals Charlton and Bolton 
which left the club in the relegation zone. They are set to make a quick 
appointment, having yet to name a caretaker boss.

Redfearn’s 21-game spell at the helm is the shortest of any Rotherham manager 
since Dave Cusack in 1987-88.
