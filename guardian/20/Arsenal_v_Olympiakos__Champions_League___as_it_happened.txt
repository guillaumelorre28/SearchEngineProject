A disastrous night for Arsenal. Olympiakos had never won in England before. 
The camera picks out a couple of seething Arsenal fans. The rest of them look 
bemused and well they might. Their team has done it again. Arsenal were 
complacent. They were flat. There was a lack of urgency. They were a little 
unlucky at times but you cannot expect to be this careless at this level and 
get away with it. The first goal was a collective shambles, the second a 
nightmare for David Ospina, the decisive third from Alfred Finnbogason a dozy 
disgrace given that Arsenal had just equalised. Arsene Wenger said that Arsenal 
could not afford to drop points tonight. They have dropped points. They have 
dropped three points and after two games of theirChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> campaign, they are 
bottom of their group with zero points following chaotic defeats against Dinamo 
Zagreb and Olympiakos. Their next two games are against Bayern Munich, who won 
5-0 tonight. They’re probably going to need to get something against the German 
giants. It’s never simple with this lot, is it? Thanks for reading and 
emailing. Night.
 Olympiakos’s players celebrate their 3-2 victory. It’s no wonder they look so 
chuffed, it’s the first time they’ve won in England. Photograph: Glyn

90 min+1: Ozil slides a pass down the line towards Walcott, who finally has 
some space. He speeds into the area, cuts on to his right foot and wastefully 
bends a shot well wide. Did it take a deflection? The officials don’t think so. 
Another minute ticks by.

77 min: Fortounis is booked before the free-kick can be taken. He’s 
timewasting. Olympiakos are nervous. And they should be? Mesut Ozil is standing 
over the ball. He curls a splendid effort over the wall but Roberto flings 
himself to his left and paws it out. Arsenal try to force the rebound in but 
Olympiakos scramble the ball away desperately. Hernani is then caught in the 
face by a stray arm from Ozil. He makes sure to make the most of it and
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> are furious, 
demanding a red card for Ozil. The referee settles for yellow.

76 min: Ramsey’s pass is handled by Cambiasso 25 yards from goal. He’s booked, 
which is harsh. There wasn’t much Cambiasso could do to get out of the way of 
the ball.

cross from the right comes all the way to Fortounis on the left. He cuts inside 
and shoots from an angle. It’s straight at Ospina. By the way, Olympiakos’s

GOAL! Arsenal 2-3 Olympiakos (Finnbogason, 67 min)

Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> score another! 
Arsenal fall asleep straight from the kick-off and all of a sudden Seba plays 
the ball back from the left towards Fortounis, who’s in space inside the 
Arsenal area. He could shoot first time but instead he takes a touch and he’s 
closed down. The ball comes to Cambiasso,. He scoops it over the top to Pardo, 
who hooks the ball into the six-yard box, where Finnbogason daintily touches 
the ball beyond Ospina!

time in the second half,Olympiakos

takes a deflection and Roberto has to claw it behind for a corner. The ball is 
cleared as far as Cazorla. He piledrives one towards goal and Roberto beats the 
shot away!

61 min: Ramsey slips a wonderful pass through to Sanchez on the right. He’s in 
acres of space and drills a low ball into the six-yard box. Siovas almost sends 
it past his own goalkeeper, who prevents an own goal by deflecting it away - 
but only as far as Mertesacker. His low drive is saved brilliantly by Roberto 
but the ball bangs back to Cazorla, whose fierce volley is somehow headed off 
the line by Elabdellauoi! That is incredible defending! That shot was hit so 
hard that he needs treatment after getting in the way of it!

48 min: “My theory on why Ospina is starting: Wenger’s well known 
sentimentality,” says William Marzouk. “He knows Ospina did a good job last 
year, and so, having generally benched him in favor of Cech, is giving Ospina 
someChampions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> 
starts to be a good sport. We saw the same thing with Abou Diaby, all those 
contract renewels, b/c of Wenger’s loyalty.”

But did he? He was at fault for a few goals. I’m thinking of Monaco’s third 
here and Bafetimbi Gomis’s winner for Swansea.

46 min: A big half for Arsenal begins. They cannot afford to lose this game. 
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> have brought on 
Alfred Finnbogason for Brown Ideye. “I’ve seen and enjoyed Game of Thrones,” 
says Ryan Dunne. “But why watch any of the flavour of the month supposed must 
see programmes when one could rerewatch Seinfeld again? (be honest, I bet half 
the MBMs you do have you wishing you were in enjoying old Italia 90 videos or 
something instead!)“

Arsene Wenger said before the game that Cech has a slight calf injury, but I 
fancy he still would have caught that corner.

A slow motion replay suggests that the ball was over the line for Olympiakos’s 
second goal.Pulitzer please! “I didn’t see Dirty Dancing until about two years 
ago when my wife cajouled me into watching it,” says Jared Brown. “The famous 
corner in that film was as rubbish as the Arsenal’s response to those in this 
current horror flick.”

I can’t get my head round why Petr Cech isn’t playing. It’s a baffling 
decision. As for the rest of the Arsenal team, they’ve all been useless apart 
from Alexis Sanchez. “I genuinely felt sorry forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> when I saw the scoreline,” says 
Ian Copestake. “It’s as if they each took it in turns to read your preamble.”

There are two crucial aspects to Olympiakos’s second goal. The first is that 
David Ospina should wear a clown costume for the second half. The second is 
that it makes no sense not to have goalline technology in theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. As bad as that mistake 
was, I doubt the ball was over the line.

GOAL! Arsenal 1-2 Olympiakos (Fourtounis, 40 min)

That decision to rest Petr Cech doesn’t look too clever now. Fourtounis’s 
inswinger curls wickedly towards goal and seems to take Ospina by surprise. He 
gets his bearings wrong and for an inexplicable reason he pats the ball down - 
I’ve no idea why - andOlympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> claim that it’s over the 
line. Siovas tries to bundle it in to make sure but Arsenal hack it away. But 
wait! The referee has blown his whistle! The fifth official behind the goal is 
indicating the ball was over the line! I don’t think it is - the replays seem 
to suggest it’s not - but what a dreadful mistake by Ospina. This is farcical. 
The goal goes to Fourtounis but Ospina provided the inspiration, so let’s hope 
he gets the credit.
 Fourtounis pokes the ball over the line to put the visitors back in front.

A disastrous night for Arsenal. Olympiakos had never won in England before. 
The camera picks out a couple of seething Arsenal fans. The rest of them look 
bemused and well they might. Their team has done it again. Arsenal were 
complacent. They were flat. There was a lack of urgency. They were a little 
unlucky at times but you cannot expect to be this careless at this level and 
get away with it. The first goal was a collective shambles, the second a 
nightmare for David Ospina, the decisive third from Alfred Finnbogason a dozy 
disgrace given that Arsenal had just equalised. Arsene Wenger said that Arsenal 
could not afford to drop points tonight. They have dropped points. They have 
dropped three points and after two games of theirChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> campaign, they are 
bottom of their group with zero points following chaotic defeats against Dinamo 
Zagreb and Olympiakos. Their next two games are against Bayern Munich, who won 
5-0 tonight. They’re probably going to need to get something against the German 
giants. It’s never simple with this lot, is it? Thanks for reading and 
emailing. Night.

90 min+4: Oxlade-Chamberlain’s free-kick is headed away. Pardo wastes a

attack again. Ramsey scoops a ball into the area for Walcott. He tries to turn 
and shoot but he can’t shake off his marker! This is desperate stuff! The ball 
comes to Oxlade-Chamberlain. Another shot! It’s wide! And...
 
90 min+3: Salino fouls Campbell on the right.
 
90 min+1: Ozil slides a pass down the line towards Walcott, who finally has 
some space. He speeds into the area, cuts on to his right foot and wastefully 
bends a shot well wide. Did it take a deflection? The officials don’t think so. 
Another minute ticks by.
 
90 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross is deflected behind by Salino. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have a corner. Finnbogason heads 
it away. Ozil lobs it back into the area and Mertesacker heads tamely at 
Roberto. There will be four minutes of stoppage time.
 
89 min: Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> are 
defending superbly. They’re heading everything away. Ramsey tosses another 
hopeful into the box. It’s Roberto’s.
 
88 min: Cazorla hangs the ball high to the far post. It’s overhit but Roberto 
has to push it over - it may well have been destined for the top corner.
 
87 min: The tireless Sanchez earns a free-kick on the left. An opportunity for 
Arsenal to testOlympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> 
again.
 
86 min: Before the corner is taken, it’s time for Joel Campbell. Hector 
Bellerin goes off. The corner is taken. It’s headed away. Eventually the ball 
goes out of play and Vouras comes on for the excellent Fortounis.
 
85 min: Gibbs sends a superb ball into the area from the left. Sanchez throws 
himself at the ball and it looks destined for the back of the net, but he’s 
denied when the header flicks off the head of anOlympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> defender. Corner.
 
84 min: Kasami lofts a clever pass over the top of the Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defence. Fortounis almost 
fastens on to it but Ospina is out quickly to deny him.
 
83 min: The free-kick is headed away. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s shot is deflected 
wide. The corner is headed away. The frustration grows. Is it time for Joel 
Campbell?
 
82 min: Kasami catches Ramsey. Another free-kick to Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. This one is probably too far 
out for a shot.
 
80 min: Ramsey balloons the ball into orbit from 30 yards. The game enters the 
final 10 minutes. Arsenal trail. TheirChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> hopes will be in severe 
doubt if they don’t find an equaliser.
 
77 min: Fortounis is booked before the free-kick can be taken. He’s 
timewasting. Olympiakos are nervous. And they should be? Mesut Ozil is standing 
over the ball. He curls a splendid effort over the wall but Roberto flings 
himself to his left and paws it out. Arsenal try to force the rebound in but 
Olympiakos scramble the ball away desperately. Hernani is then caught in the 
face by a stray arm from Ozil. He makes sure to make the most of it and
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> are furious, 
demanding a red card for Ozil. The referee settles for yellow.

76 min: Ramsey’s pass is handled by Cambiasso 25 yards from goal. He’s booked, 
which is harsh. There wasn’t much Cambiasso could do to get out of the way of 
the ball.
 
75 min: Finnbogason is booked for stamping on Cazorla’s foot. That was a bit 
naughty.
 
73 min: Olympiakos take off Seba and bring on Hernani. 
 
71 min: Finnbogason pulls Sanchez’s shirt around 30 yards from goal. Sanchez 
and Cazorla are standing over the ball. Cazorla flicks the ball into the area 
but Sanchez can’t reach it. It’s Roberto’s.
 
69 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are rocking. A 
cross from the right comes all the way to Fortounis on the left. He cuts inside 
and shoots from an angle. It’s straight at Ospina. By the way, Olympiakos’s 
second goal has been given as an Ospina own goal.
 
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> score another! 
Arsenal fall asleep straight from the kick-off and all of a sudden Seba plays 
the ball back from the left towards Fortounis, who’s in space inside the 
Arsenal area. He could shoot first time but instead he takes a touch and he’s 
closed down. The ball comes to Cambiasso,. He scoops it over the top to Pardo, 
who hooks the ball into the six-yard box, where Finnbogason daintily touches 
the ball beyond Ospina!

Who else? Theo Walcott chips a delightful little ball into the middle from the 
right and Sanchez arrives to bullet a header into the bottom right corner! Now 
then, canArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> score another?

65 min: Roberto is booked for taking too long over a goal-kick. For the first 
time in the second half,Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> are hanging on. Ramsey’s 
introduction has transformed Arsenal. If they score one, they’ll score another.
 
64 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain blasts to the byline and crosses. His delivery 
takes a deflection and Roberto has to claw it behind for a corner. The ball is 
cleared as far as Cazorla. He piledrives one towards goal and Roberto beats the 
shot away!
 
62 min: Arsenal increase the pace again, Theo Walcott going on a mazy dribble 
inside from the right.Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> don’t know which way to look 
but eventually Walcott is shepherded out of play.
 
61 min: Ramsey slips a wonderful pass through to Sanchez on the right. He’s in 
acres of space and drills a low ball into the six-yard box. Siovas almost sends 
it past his own goalkeeper, who prevents an own goal by deflecting it away - 
but only as far as Mertesacker. His low drive is saved brilliantly by Roberto 
but the ball bangs back to Cazorla, whose fierce volley is somehow headed off 
the line by Elabdellauoi! That is incredible defending! That shot was hit so 
hard that he needs treatment after getting in the way of it!
 
60 min: Santi Cazorla tries to burst past Cambiasso on the left. He prods it 
behind for a corner. Aaron Ramsey replaces Francis Coquelin. The corner is 
cleared.
 
58 min: Arsenal’s passing is too slow and deliberate against Olympiakos’s 
massed defence.Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> need some 
rage.
 
57 min: Per Mertesacker replaces Laurent Koscielny, who pulled a hamstring 
when he stretched to win a tackle a few minutes ago.
 
56 min: Laurent Koscielny is down. He appears to be feeling his thigh. His 
evening may well be over. Per Mertesacker is getting ready.
 
54 min: Kasami lets fly from 30 yards. It bounces just in front of Ospina, who 
does well to hold on to the ball. If he had dropped it, Finnbogosan would have 
been on hand to snaffle up the rebound.
 
53 min: Cazorla lifts a cross into the box. Olivier Giroud is suspended. It’s 
going to be difficult forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
to score a header against this team.
 
51 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> need a hero. 
Where’s Mathieu Flamini?
 
50 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> concede 
possession cheaply near their own area. Finnbogosan introduces himself to the 
game by slashing well wide from 25 yards.
 
48 min: “My theory on why Ospina is starting: Wenger’s well known 
sentimentality,” says William Marzouk. “He knows Ospina did a good job last 
year, and so, having generally benched him in favor of Cech, is giving Ospina 
someChampions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> 
starts to be a good sport. We saw the same thing with Abou Diaby, all those 
contract renewels, b/c of Wenger’s loyalty.”

But did he? He was at fault for a few goals. I’m thinking of Monaco’s third 
here and Bafetimbi Gomis’s winner for Swansea.
 
46 min: A big half for Arsenal begins. They cannot afford to lose this game. 
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> have brought on 
Alfred Finnbogason for Brown Ideye. “I’ve seen and enjoyed Game of Thrones,” 
says Ryan Dunne. “But why watch any of the flavour of the month supposed must 
see programmes when one could rerewatch Seinfeld again? (be honest, I bet half 
the MBMs you do have you wishing you were in enjoying old Italia 90 videos or 
something instead!)“
 
Arsene Wenger said before the game that Cech has a slight calf injury, but I 
fancy he still would have caught that corner.
 
A slow motion replay suggests that the ball was over the line for Olympiakos’s 
second goal.Pulitzer please! “I didn’t see Dirty Dancing until about two years 
ago when my wife cajouled me into watching it,” says Jared Brown. “The famous 
corner in that film was as rubbish as the Arsenal’s response to those in this 
current horror flick.”
 
I can’t get my head round why Petr Cech isn’t playing. It’s a baffling 
decision. As for the rest of the Arsenal team, they’ve all been useless apart 
from Alexis Sanchez. “I genuinely felt sorry forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> when I saw the scoreline,” says 
Ian Copestake. “It’s as if they each took it in turns to read your preamble.”
 
There are two crucial aspects to Olympiakos’s second goal. The first is that 
David Ospina should wear a clown costume for the second half. The second is 
that it makes no sense not to have goalline technology in theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. As bad as that mistake 
was, I doubt the ball was over the line.
 
Oh, Arsenal!
 
45 min+1: There will be two minutes of stoppage time.
 
45 min: Gabriel steams through Salino. His studs were up and he’s booked. He’s 
slightly fortunate the referee didn’t take a sterner view of that one.
 
44 min: Alexis Sanchez is booked for questioning a decision. That’s petty on 
the part of the referee. Sanchez didn’t seem to do much.
 
43 min: David Ospina isn’t up to the required standard. Why isn’t Petr Cech 
playing?
 
That decision to rest Petr Cech doesn’t look too clever now. Fourtounis’s 
inswinger curls wickedly towards goal and seems to take Ospina by surprise. He 
gets his bearings wrong and for an inexplicable reason he pats the ball down - 
I’ve no idea why - andOlympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> claim that it’s over the 
line. Siovas tries to bundle it in to make sure but Arsenal hack it away. But 
wait! The referee has blown his whistle! The fifth official behind the goal is 
indicating the ball was over the line! I don’t think it is - the replays seem 
to suggest it’s not - but what a dreadful mistake by Ospina. This is farcical. 
The goal goes to Fourtounis but Ospina provided the inspiration, so let’s hope 
he gets the credit.
 Fourtounis pokes the ball over the line to put the visitors back in front.

of the goal. No matter what way you look at it, it’s a huge clanger by Ospina.
