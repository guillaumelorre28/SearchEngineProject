The male fan was arrested after a pyrotechnic was let off in the away end, 
causing the stand to be evacuated and the match to be held up for more than an 
hour.

A club statement read: “The matter remains in the hands of the authorities, 
but we have taken this step to send a further message that this type of 
behaviour will not be tolerated.

“The use of pyrotechnics within a stadium environment is reckless, 
irresponsible and potentially extremely dangerous.

“As was stated at the weekend, it simply has to stop. We will continue to do 
everything we can along with the authorities to stamp this out as we do not 
want it associated with our magnificent fans or this club in any way.

“In this particular case, the ban we have imposed on the individual is an 
interim measure. The matter is with the police and we will now follow their 
lead as to what we do next once due process has taken its course.”
