Mercedes are considering disciplinary action – which could mean a fine or even 
suspension – against Lewis Hamilton after the three‑times world champion twice 
flouted instructions as his team-mate,Nico Rosberg, won his maiden Formula One 
world championship

 on Sunday.

Hamilton won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, his 10th win of the season against 
Rosberg’s nine and his fourth successive victory. But it was not enough to 
prevent the second-placedRosberg winning the title by five points

Mercedes were angered by Hamilton’s refusal to respond to team orders to drive 
faster as he backed Rosberg into the drivers behind him, Sebastian Vettel and 
Max Verstappen; fourth place for Rosberg would have made Hamilton champion for 
the third year in a row.

Toto Wolff, the Mercedes head of motorsport, said: “Undermining a structure in 
public means you are putting yourself before the team. It is very simple. 
Anarchy does not work in any team and in any company.”

Wolff said he had not yet decided whether to crack down on a driver who has 
had 32 of his 53 race wins with the Silver Arrows since joining from McLaren in 
2013. “The other half of me says it was Lewis’s only chance of winning the 
championship at the stage and maybe you cannot demand a racing driver that is 
one of the best, if not the best out there, to comply in a situation where his 
instincts cannot make him comply.

“It is about finding a solution as to how to solve that in the future because 
a precedent has been set. Let me sleep overnight and come up with a solution.”

When pressed again about what he would be doing about Hamilton, he thought for 
a while before adding: “We need to look at the overall situation and ask what 
does it mean. Everything is possible from ‘let’s change the rules next year 
because it does not work in those critical races and maybe we want to give them 
more freedom.’ Or we could have the more harsh side, that we feel the values 
were not respected. I am not sure yet where my finger is going to point or the 
needle is going to go.”

Wolff made it clear Mercedes were happy to let the two drivers race unless it 
compromised “our No1 objective of winning the race”.

Wolff said the team had calculated the Ferrari driver Vettel, shod with 
fresher rubber, had a chance of passing Germany’s Rosberg and Hamilton and 
stealing victory for the Scuderia.

The British driver said: “I did nothing dangerous so I don’t feel I did 
anything unfair. We were fighting for the world championship. I was leading. I 
control the pace. That’s the rules.

“I don’t know why they didn’t just let us race. There was never a moment I 
felt I was going to lose the race but it is quite clear, their thought process.”

Rosberg said: “You can understand the team’s perspective and you can enjoy 
Lewis’s perspective, There were many moments that were not enjoyable.”

The frosty atmosphere between the Mercedes drivers was evident before the 
podium ceremony. Rosberg hoisted the sport’s commercial supremo, Bernie 
Ecclestone, into the air but ignored Hamilton. The handshakes and 
congratulations eventually came on the podium.

Hamilton was supported by Wolff’s opposite number at Red Bull, Christian 
Horner, who had cheekily suggested a few days earlier that the Mercedes driver 
should employ the strategy. Horner said: “I wouldn’t have expected him to do 
anything different. He played completely within the rules.

“Winning the race wasn’t going to be enough for him today, he needed cars 
between him and, if he’d charged off into the distance, he wouldn’t have 
created that possibility. So he won the race as slowly as he could. It’s like 
in a football game where the team might protect from the opposition by kicking 
the ball around and not enabling the opposition to get hold of the it. I didn’t 
see that he did anything wrong today.”

Horner, whose Red Bull dominated Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> before the rise of Mercedes in 
2014, added: “We know that Toto likes to control most things in the paddock, 
including other teams’ drivers. I understand that Toto has suggested that Lewis 
followed my instruction rather than his, and he should come and drive for Red 
Bull.

“Congratulations to Nico. He’s driven a great season and is a very worthy 
world champion. But it was naive to think there would be any different approach 
to this race with what’s at stake. Lewis drove a tactical race. He didn’t do 
anything dirty. He didn’t do anything against the rules. I think it would be 
unfair to criticise him for the way that he drove.”

However, Hamilton came under more fire after the post race press conference 
when he appeared churlish in defeat, prompting Vettel to praise his fellow 
German as a “worthy champion”.
