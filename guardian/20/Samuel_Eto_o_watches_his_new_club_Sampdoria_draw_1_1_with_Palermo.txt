Palermo at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris after completing a medical as he prepares 
to join the Serie A club from Everton.

Sampdoria hope the 33-year-old Cameroon striker will provide the extra 
firepower to secure a Champions League qualifying place.

second-half dominance into a victory.

Sampdoria, coached by Sinisa Mihaljovic, with 34 points from 20 games, moved 
above Rafael Benítez’s Napoli.

Paul Pogba scored one goal and created another as the leaders, Juventus
