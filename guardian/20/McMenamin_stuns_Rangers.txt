Livingston <https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston> may be struggling 
to survive in administration but a goal from the first-half substitute Colin 
McMenamin was no less than they deserved last night as they took the game to 
Rangers.Celtic can now wrap up the title on Sunday with a win at Kilmarnock.

Livingston began the livelier and a curling cross from Lee Makel took a 
deflection before whistling just past Stefan Klos' far post.Then David McNamee 
got the better of Paolo Vanoli in the box but after cutting inside his shot was 
too weak.

Rangers' first chance came in the 19th minute when Steven Thompson beat Marvin 
Andrews but the striker could only loft into the arms of Roddy McKenzie. But 
six minutes later Michael Mols firedRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> ahead. Vanoli's inswinging 
corner was retrieved by Gavin Rae,Thompson was able to head down the cross for 
Mols to lash home acrobatically.

Jamie McAllister fired wide as Livingston sought a way back and Klos was 
required to make another near-post save, this time from Rubio. For Rangers 
Stephen Hughes saw a shot charged down but at the other end McNamee fired in a 
cross that Frank de Boer had to hack behind for a corner.
