As the congregation spilled out of St Cristiolus church 
<http://parish.churchinwales.org.uk/d855/churches-en/st-cristiolus-eglwyswrw_-en/>
, the rain began to fall and the Rev Peter Ratcliffe gave a satisfied smile. 
“We had been praying for it to stop. Now we’re so near the record, we’re 
praying for it to carry on just a little longer. This is lovely.”

If the rain continues for a few more days – and the forecast suggests there is 
a very good chance it will – the village of Eglwyswrw in south-westWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> will break the UK record for the number 
of consecutive rainy days. Since the end of October the people of this 
picturesque corner of Pembrokeshire have endured every type of rain, from 
downpours to drizzle.

At times the water has raced into the river Gafren and on to Cardigan Bay; at 
others it has been little more than a trickle. But as of Sunday rain had been 
detected at the local weather station for 83 days in a row.

“It was grinding people down,” said county councillor John Davies. “But now 
people are embracing it and we hope we will break the record. I expect we’ll 
hold a party of some sort if we do next weekend.

“We’re used to it being warm and wet here but this has been the ultimate test. 
The rain was hard and relentless until Christmas. Since then we’ve had some 
breaks but there hasn’t been a day when it hasn’t rained at least a little.

“It’s been bad for some trades. Builders have had to plan around the showers 
and it’s been tough for farmers. The cattle are all right – they are indoors at 
this time of year. But the sheep are really struggling being constantly in mud.”

For those hoping to wrest the record from the Scottish island of Islay, where 
it rained for 89 consecutive days in 1923, there was a scare on Saturday when 
the villagers of Eglwyswrw stayed dry for the daylight hours. But at 10pm the 
rain came again and this accidental record attempt was kept intact.

Just up from the church, John Evans was huddled in front of the woodburner in 
the “pub” he has created in a garden shed and staying cheerful with a drop of 
his home brew beer. “You have to do what you can to stay happy,” he said.

“We’re also lucky that because we’re on top of a hill we haven’t had any 
flooding. You feel sorry for the people in the north of England who have been 
in such a mess. Yes, we’ve had lots of rain but we’re dong a lot better than 
them.”

Sian Jones, whose runs Brian Llewelyn a’i Ferched country stores 
<http://www.country-stores.com/> with her father, argued that the rainy spell 
was good news for the village. “I must admit I didn’t realise that it had been 
raining for so long until it made the local news.

“Then I thought: ‘Shit, it has been raining, that’s why we’re all feeling so 
desperate. But I think it’s good for the village. Before it was the place that 
nobody could pronounce, now it’s the really rainy place.”

The last time the village (whose name is pronounced Eg-loi-su-ru) hit the 
headlines was when the country stores CCTV cameras caught an elderly car driver
exiting the forecourt on two wheels 
<http://www.pembrokeshire-herald.com/18227/eglwyswrw-cctv-captures-elderly-motorists-dare-devil-driving/>
 after clipping the kerb. Jones sold the footage and is now dreaming up ways of 
making the wet weather pay. “We don’t sell any extra wellies – everyone has 
them already in a farming community like this – but we’re thinking of making up 
T-shirts and key fobs.”

There have been a few cynics. Meurig Thomas, who lives 10 miles away in the 
(slightly) drier village of Maenclochog,suggested cheekily on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/meurig.thomas.1> he was going to to start fundraising 
for the villagers of Eglwyswrw: “Thinking of starting a just giving page. With 
just £2 each they can go buy some man-up pills and get on with it like 
everybody else who’s had rain all winter and not harped on about it for 80 
days!!!”

 The scapegoats: Sarah-Jane Absalom and her son, Hugo, outside the church.

Some wonder if it will harm the tourist trade, others wonder if it might make 
second-home owners think twice about buying in the area, which is hugely 
popular with wealthy incomers (to the extent that a decline in Welsh speakers 
was picked up in the last census).

There is a serious aspect. Tom Hazelden 
<https://twitter.com/stevenmorris20/status/688752545263685632>, who has run the 
Eglwyswrw weather station for more than 40 years with his wife, Beryl, said 
this run of rain was due to climate change.

Tom, who was wearing shorts and a T-shirt despite the rain when the Guardian 
visited, dug out Beryl’s old handwritten weather logs to show how in Januarys 
past there always used to be some zeros in the rainfall column. “Now you’re 
lucky if you get a couple of noughts in a row. Things are changing.”

The villagers have found a scapegoat – Sarah-Jane Absalom and her family, who 
moved into the village just as the rains began. “I think I’m the wicked witch 
who has brought the curse of rain with me,” she said.

“It is a shame. We’re in a lovely area, just on the edge of the Preseli 
mountains 
<http://www.visitpembrokeshire.com/explore-pembrokeshire/preseli-mountains/>and 
we haven’t had much of a chance to get out and explore. Her five-year-old son, 
Hugo, is not worried about the record. For him it is simple. “I want it to stop 
so I can go out and play.”
