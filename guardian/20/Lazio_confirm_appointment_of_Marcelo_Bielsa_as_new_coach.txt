Bielsa, who has been without a post since abruptly leaving Marseille after the 
first match of last season, will arrive in the Italian capital at the weekend 
to sign his new deal.

“As revealed by news in the media today, SS Lazio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> announces that it has already 
deposited the contract of Marcelo Bielsa and his staff,” read a statement on 
Lazio’s website.

“The club also announces that, as per the communication received, the coach 
and his staff will be in Rome on Saturday July 9.”

, Bielsa had also been linked with a return to the Argentina national side – a 
post he held between 1998 and 2004 – but will instead begin his first spell in 
Italian football having previously managed in his homeland, Mexico and Spain.

Meanwhile, the Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson has reportedly failed to turn 
to pre-season training after being denied permission to play for Brazil at the 
Olympics.
