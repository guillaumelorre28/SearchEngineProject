This is our signature aperitif at Gymkhana <http://www.gymkhanalondon.com> 
restaurant in London. The citrus makes it a very refreshing palate-cleanser 
that helps take the edge off the working day. One is never enough, three 
perhaps too many. Serves one.

60ml London dry gin
8 dashes Angostura bitters 
120ml tonic water (we use Fevertree)
1 good-sized wedge each fresh lime, lemon and grapefruit

Pour the gin, bitters and tonic into a tall glass over lots of ice, squeeze in 
the juice from all the fruit and serve at once.
