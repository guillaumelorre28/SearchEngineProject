No Shakespeare play provides, for a British audience, a more perfect mirror of 
the times. The famousOlivier film <http://www.criterion.com/films/579-henry-v> 
(1944) is unashamedly triumphalist. Kenneth Branagh on stage (1984) andscreen 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZVxbrW7Ow> (1989) gave us a more troubled, 
anti-heroic Henry. Nicholas Hytnerkicked off his National Theatre tenure in 
2003 with a fine production 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/may/14/theatre.artsfeatures2>, starring 
Adrian Lester, that reflected the Iraq war and current debates about 
nationhood. For me the production that best caught the play's ambivalence about 
war and blend of rhetoric and realism wasTerry Hands's for the RSC in 1975 
<http://theshakespeareblog.com/2011/12/the-rscs-golden-years-terry-hands-and-alan-howard/>
.

At a time when Britain was riven by economic and industrial strife, it became 
a play about a leader wracked by self-doubt who emerges triumphant from a 
national crisis. Starting in drab rehearsal clothes, the production acquired 
visual colour as it swept along andAlan Howard 
<http://www.alanhoward.org.uk/henryvcorner.htm>, initially introspective but 
eventually allowing his voice to soar like a trumpet, was no Hooray Henry but a 
perfect figure of the times: a modest man willing himself to victory against 
the odds.
