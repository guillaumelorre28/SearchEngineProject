Bayern Munich scraped past Hertha Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin> 1-0 thanks to a late goal 
from Bastian Schweinsteiger and the Bundesliga title will belong to the 
Bavarians if Wolfsburg fail to win on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola’s league leaders are 15 points clear with four matches left and 
will celebrate their third successive domestic crown if second-placed Wolfsburg 
cannot manage a victory at Borussia Mönchengladbach.

“We may not be champions mathematically but in theory we are,” the Spaniard 
told reporters. “The title is almost ours, but we have to concentrate on other 
tasks. Our legs were a bit heavy today.”

Guardiola rested several players who helped crush Porto 6-1 in midweek to 
advance to the Champions League semi-finals.

Treble-chasing Bayern had Schweinsteiger fit again and Spaniard Javi Martínez 
back on the bench for the first time since tearing knee ligaments last year but 
never hit top form against the battling Berliners.

A fine run from Mitchell Weiser ended with him cutting the ball back for 
Schweinsteiger to score the only goal 10 minutes from time.
