 amid an investigation into his links to alleged child abuse, has said he will 
do all in his power to help the authorities.

Gradi, who was also the club’s director of football, reiterated his denial of 
any wrongdoing on Monday.

He said: “Having been notified by the Football Association on 25 November, I 
acknowledged my current interim suspension from football. I would like to 
reiterate that I will do everything within my power to assist all investigatory 
authorities.

“As I have previously stated, aside from denying any wrongdoing, it would be 
inappropriate and unfair on all parties to comment through the media at this 
time in connection with any allegations. I would also like to thank all those 
people who have come out in support of me. It is very much appreciated.”

In a separate statement, Crewe confirmed Gradi’s suspension by the FA.

The FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, said a review led by Clive Sheldon QC had been 
asked to “establish what, if anything, the FA and clubs knew about these 
allegations at the relevant time and what action was taken or should have taken 
place”.


He said the review would leave no stone unturned and that the FA would deal 
with the findings in a transparent and appropriate manner ‘wherever they take 
us”.
