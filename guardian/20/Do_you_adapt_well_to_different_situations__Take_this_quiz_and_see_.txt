How good are you at adapting your behaviour to different contexts, and what 
does this say about you? To find out, simply answer ‘true’ or ‘false’ to each 
of the following statements…

a) In a new social situation, I often look to others for clues about how to 
behave.

b) I’m much more likely to laugh out loud if I’m watching something funny with 
friends than on my own.

c) At a party I avoid expressing opinions that I think others will disagree 
with.

d) I sometimes pretend I’m enjoying an event or gathering when I’m not.

e) I’m good at telling white lies to people’s faces.

This questionnaire measured your self-monitoring. People with higher scores 
(ie more “true” than “false” responses) tend to change their behaviour 
depending on the role or situation they find themselves in. People with low 
scores have a more take-me-as-you-find-me approach. These people tend to have a 
similar disposition – whether that is grumpy, cheerful or laid-back – 
regardless of the situation.

Interestingly, studies suggest that people who score high for self-monitoring 
make good actors and entertainers, are good at public speaking, make better 
leaders, are better at inferring others’ personality from their appearance, are 
more impressed by physical attractiveness and – perhaps as a result – are more 
likely to have commitment-free sex.
