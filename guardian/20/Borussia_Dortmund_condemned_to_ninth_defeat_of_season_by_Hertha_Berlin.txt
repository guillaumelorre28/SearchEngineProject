Borussia Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> 
suffered their ninth defeat of the season, losing 1-0 at Hertha Berlin. On 
Tuesday they won their Champions League group, finishing ahead of Arsenal, but 
last season’s Bundesliga runners-up have only one point from their past seven 
away games.

The Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan had to go off with what looked like 
a hamstring injury in the 35th minute, allowing Jakub Blaszczykowski on for his 
comeback from a knee injury. The Poland captain had not played in 322 days.

But the goal came when Per Ciljan Skjelbred capitalised on a poor pass from 
Neven Subotic for Blaszczykowski and quickly fed the former Dortmund player 
Julian Schieber, who eluded Sebastian Kehl to score.

Schieber said: “I’m extremely happy that my team won. I’m sorry for my former 
team-mates.”

Dortmund had their goalkeeper Mitch Langerak to thank for keeping it 1-0 
before the break, his right foot enough to deny Roy Beerens.

The Dortmund coach, Jürgen Klopp, reacted by sending on the former Berlin 
striker Adrián Ramos for the defensively minded Kehl at the break.

Mats Hummels’ powerful header was kept out by the Berlin goalkeeper Thomas 
Kraft as Dortmund increased the pressure late on. He pulled off a great save to 
deny Ciro Immobile, who then headed an easier chance just wide.

Klopp said: “There were four or five huge chances. We didn’t use any of them.”
