When Philippe Kalt reached for his red card, ready to dismiss Guingamp 
goalkeeper Mamadou Samassa in the 89th minute of their Ligue 1 game at
Montpellier <https://www.theguardian.com/football/montpellier-football-team>, 
several team-mates rushed to intervene. Nothing new there – but Ivorian 
defender Benjamin Angoua took the protests to new levels by attempting to knock 
the red card clean out of Kalt’s grasp.

After a fumbled first attempt, Angoua managed to dislodge the card at the 
second time of asking, sending it fluttering to the ground. The tactic proved 
ineffective – once Kalt had retrieved the card, he promptly brandished it in 
the direction of Samassa, who had already begun the long walk back to the 
dressing room.

The ugly scene was typical of Guingamp’s start to the season – the Bretons are 
bottom of the league, having won just twice in all competitions this season. 
Samassa was sent off for remonstrating with the referee after Montpellier took 
a late 2-1 lead at La Mosson. The goalkeeper has had a tough month – he was 
also sent off for Mali in their African Nations Cup qualifier against Malawi.

Angoua is not the only player to take a novel approach to card evasion in 
recent weeks. Earlier this month,Granada’s Allan Nyom raced away downfield in 
an attempt to avoid a caution

. Just as in Fifa 94, the referee caught up with him eventually. Surprisingly, 
Kalt didn’t caution Angoua for his indiscretion, perhaps fearing a repeat 
incident with the yellow card.
