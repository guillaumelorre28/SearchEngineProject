Full-time: Chelsea 2-0 Scunthorpe

That’s it. A relatively straightforward passage to the fourth round for 
Chelsea, but Scunthorpe played well here. Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s first goal for 
the club sealed it after Costa opened the scoring in the opening half. That’s 
it from me.Join Nick Ames, now, for Tottenham v Leicester at White Hart Lane.

Clarke, along with the recently departed Williams, have been thoroughly

87 min: Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> go so 
close. Clarke hits a rasper towards the top corner but Begovic does wonderfully 
to save and touch the ball off the bar and out for a corner that amounts to 
nowt.

GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Scunthorpe (Loftus-Cheek)

69 min: That’s his first goal for Chelsea! Willian cutely feeds an overlapping 
Azpilicueta. He sends a low cross towards the penalty spot and Loftus-Cheek 
times his run superbly, tucking the ball into the bottom left corner, past 
Daniels. Cruel onScunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> 
at a time where they were growing in stature but that should be that.

61 min: Scunthorpe are beginning to press more higher up the pitch and Costa, 
dropping deep finds himself in trouble only for Bishop to put a little too much 
pressure on and concede a foul. TheScunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> player pushes Costa in the 
back but the Spain striker is calm by his standards and does not react. Seconds 
later Willian and Dawson square, up the other United skinhead picking up a 
booking.

58 min: Scunthorpe are certainly pushing forward a bit more but Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> look like they could turn up the 
heat if needed. Loftus-Cheek turns nicely on the right and plays a one-two with 
Willian but is fouled by Bishop before receiving the return.

54 min: A big penalty shout for Scunthorpe! Van Veen runs hard and direct. He 
hits the deck under pressure from Ramires when he reaches the box. The contact 
is so, so slight and the referee, Craig Pawson, waves play on. The visitors are 
furious but there really was not much in the challenge.

Half-time: Chelsea 1-0 Scunthorpe

45 min +1: Van Veen sends a cross towards Bishop and Madden from the right but 
neither can get to it. And that is the break. Chelsea were impressive in the 
opening 25 minutes butScunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> have grown into it and the 
tie is still alive.

That’s it. A relatively straightforward passage to the fourth round for 
Chelsea, but Scunthorpe played well here. Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s first goal for 
the club sealed it after Costa opened the scoring in the opening half. That’s 
it from me.Join Nick Ames, now, for Tottenham v Leicester at White Hart Lane.

90 min +2: Traore concedes a second. This will be the last play of the game. 
It reaches Bishop but he pokes narrowly wide.
 
90 min +2: Laird wins a corner through a cross from the left that is deflected 
out by Zouma.
 
90 min +1: And the first of those has been spent with Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> passing the ball across the back.
 
90 min: Three minutes to be added on, folks.
 
89 min: Scunthorpe are still going here, searching for a sweet consolation. 
Clarke, along with the recently departed Williams, have been thoroughly 
impressive.
 
87 min: Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> go so 
close. Clarke hits a rasper towards the top corner but Begovic does wonderfully 
to save and touch the ball off the bar and out for a corner that amounts to 
nowt.
 
85 min: And Chelsea’s final substitution sees Costa replaced by the third 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> kid, Traore.
 
84 min: It’s petering out now. Lots of niggly fouls and no real flow. Chelsea 
will be satisfied with their showing, though, andScunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> can take great heart from a 
spirited performance.
 
82 min: Van Veen’s afternoon is over, replaced by Wooton.
 
81 min: And if you were wondering why we didn’t use the entire names of those 
substitutions … Hakeeb Adeola Abiola Ayinde Adelakun
 
79 min: A double change for Scunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> as Williams is replaced by 
Adelakun and Dawson makes way for King.
 
76 min: Chelsea have a penalty shout as Kenedy hits the deck under Clarke’s 
fine challenge. The full-back’s tackle is brilliantly timed though.

73 min: Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> have a 
free kick on the left. Almost everybody expects a cross but Van Veen shoots, 
finding the side-netting. Some visiting fans jump up to celebrate, and 
Chelsea’s supporters respond by cheering ironically.
 
71 min: Now it is time for another promising youngster to make his Cup bow for 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> – Kenedy replacing Pedro.
 
69 min: That’s his first goal for Chelsea! Willian cutely feeds an overlapping 
Azpilicueta. He sends a low cross towards the penalty spot and Loftus-Cheek 
times his run superbly, tucking the ball into the bottom left corner, past 
Daniels. Cruel onScunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> 
at a time where they were growing in stature but that should be that.

67 min: Pedro is tripped by Dawson about 40 yards from Chelsea’s goal. If 
Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> are to equalise, 
it will be from a situation like this.
 
66 min: Ivanovic booked for knocking the ball out of Laird’s hand as he 
attempted to take a throw-in.
 
64 min: Ramires strikes wide harmlessly. On TV, Howard Webb reckons Van Veen 
should have been given a penalty a few minutes ago.
 
61 min: Scunthorpe are beginning to press more higher up the pitch and Costa, 
dropping deep finds himself in trouble only for Bishop to put a little too much 
pressure on and concede a foul. TheScunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> player pushes Costa in the 
back but the Spain striker is calm by his standards and does not react. Seconds 
later Willian and Dawson square, up the other United skinhead picking up a 
booking.
 
58 min: Scunthorpe are certainly pushing forward a bit more but Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> look like they could turn up the 
heat if needed. Loftus-Cheek turns nicely on the right and plays a one-two with 
Willian but is fouled by Bishop before receiving the return.
 
54 min: A big penalty shout for Scunthorpe! Van Veen runs hard and direct. He 
hits the deck under pressure from Ramires when he reaches the box. The contact 
is so, so slight and the referee, Craig Pawson, waves play on. The visitors are 
furious but there really was not much in the challenge.

53 min: Encouraging sign for Scunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> as Begovic makes a mess of a 
clearance and it allows the visitors to attack. The danger, though, is 
eventually cleared.

51 min: The ball takes one bounce and Ivanovic and Costa are close to reaching 
it but Daniels gets down to save.
 
50 min: Costa races down the left channel but Clarke puts an arm around the 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> striker and hauls him to 
the ground. Willian will swing it in.
 
48 min: Loftus-Cheek goes in late on Bishop. He plays the ball but it’s really 
mistimed and the studs of his right boot plant on Bishop’s right ankle. It 
should be a yellow card but theChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> youngster gets off with only a 
foul.
 
46 min: Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> restart. 
Can they get back into this or will Chelsea kill them off?
 
Ruben Loftus-Cheek is on for Oscar.
 
45 min +1: Van Veen sends a cross towards Bishop and Madden from the right but 
neither can get to it. And that is the break. Chelsea were impressive in the 
opening 25 minutes butScunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> have grown into it and the 
tie is still alive.
 
45 min: There will be one minute of added time.
 
44 min: Williams makes the most of a Cahill slip and races clear. But Zouma 
covers brilliantly, sliding across to concede a corner.
 
42 min: Ivanovic fouls Williams and Scunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> have what is almost a corner 
on the left. It’s taken low by Ness to Laird but he mis-kicks and Chelsea break.
