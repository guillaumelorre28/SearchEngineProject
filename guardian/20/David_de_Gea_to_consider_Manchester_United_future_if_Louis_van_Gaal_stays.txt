David de Gea is giving new thought to his future at Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> because of his 
deteriorating relationship with the manager Louis van Gaal.

The Spain goalkeeper, 25, saw his proposed move to Real Madrid collapse

 last summer after the paperwork was not signed off in time. De Gea had been 
due to sign a contract worth £9.2m a year which ran until 2021, with Real’s 
Keylor Navas going to Old Trafford in return.

However, despite another excellent campaign that saw him named United’s player 
of the year for a record third successive season, it is understood the 
goalkeeper is waiting to see whether United make a managerial change in the 
summer before committing his future.

If Van Gaal does stay on to complete the final year of the contract he signed 
whenhe succeeded David Moyes in May 2014

, it is believed that De Gea will press behind the scenes for a transfer.

United have been reported to have a pre-contract agreement with José Mourinho, 
who, like De Gea, is represented by the agent Jorge Mendes, and it is believed 
that their prospects of retaining the goalkeeper may rest on appointing the 
Portuguese. De Gea is said to be unhappy at the prospect of another season 
without Champions League football, although hesigned a new four-year contract

 with United in September.

 on Monday night also suggested that the Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic has been offered a year-long contract by United with the option of 
another year – a claim that was dismissed as “not factual” by his agent, Mino 
Raiola.
