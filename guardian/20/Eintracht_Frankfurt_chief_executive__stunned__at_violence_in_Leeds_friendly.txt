Police arrested 17 Frankfurt fans and 25 people in total following violent 
scenes before and after Eintracht’s 2-1 win on Tuesday, in which three Leeds 
supporters and two police officers were injured.

“I never see the pleasure in violence. I am stunned,” Bruchhagen told the 
German newspaper Die Welt. “I don’t know what it has to do with football.

“I regret that this has happened. It’s not in the tradition of Eintracht. It 
was obvious that on both sides there were people who wanted confrontation.”

Rival fans clashed on the pitch at the final whistle and were separated by 
riot police, who later used pepper spray to control a group of Frankfurt fans 
following more trouble in Eugendorf town centre.

Before the game about 50 Frankfurt fans stormed the stadium entrance, injuring 
two security staff, while fighting on the pitch after the game spilled over 
into the square in front of the stadium. A Leeds fans was arrested for throwing 
a bench at police.

Bruchhagen said he was not sure what action his club would take at this stage. 
He added: “What should we do? I don’t know right now. First we have to wait for 
the police report and look at who has been named. Then we will see if we have a 
legal recourse. The fighting was not instigated on our property.”

Leeds are expected to comment in due course having consulted with the police 
on Wednesday.
