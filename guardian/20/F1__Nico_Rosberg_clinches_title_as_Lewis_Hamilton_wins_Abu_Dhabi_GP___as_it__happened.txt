So Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> clung on to 
finish second in Abu Dhabi and secure his first F1 world title. Lewis 
Hamilton’s next task will be to explain his tactics to Mercedes, though it did 
make for a far more interesting finale so perhaps we should thank him. Outside 
the Mercedes bubble, Sebastian Vettel sealed fourth in the championship and 
Force India took fourth in the constructors’ race, while Jenson Button and 
Felipe Massa waved goodbye to the sport. That’s all from me, you can read our 
race report right below. Bye!

Mercedes’ Paddy Lowe, whose instructions Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> ignored: “To come through 
three amazing seasons, I think it’s nice and balanced that both guys have got a 
world championship under their belt. I don’t want to comment too much [on 
Hamilton’s tactics]. We weren’t driving the car, we don’t know how fast it was, 
but it did present some challenges. It was great to see Sebastian coming 
through which was a very good strategy from Ferrari. It was nail-biting for us 
on the pitwall, those final two laps. You don’t often see four cars crossing 
the line so close together.”

Nico Rosberg speaks! “That was definitely not the most enjoyable race, with 
Max at the beginning and then those guys coming up at the end. I’m glad it’s 
over, I’m ecstatic. I’m very, very proud to have done the feat that my dad 
achieved. It will be exciting to see him.”

Lewis Hamilton chats about himself winning races before remembering to 
congratulate Rosberg on his achievement. They share an awkward handshake, which 
David Coulthard makes them reenact for reasons which are not obvious.

Rosberg spins a few donuts on the pit-straight before diving into his team of 
mechanics for a spot of crowd-surfing. On seeing Bernie Ecclestone he launches 
the F1 chief into the air, who looks utterly unimpressed with that.

Mercedes’ Niki Lauda: “We need to speak to [Lewis] to give him an explanation. 
We tried to tell him, but he said ‘Leave me alone I know what I’m doing’ and 
thank God it worked out. I think it could have been done easier.” To put Lewis 
Hamilton’s tactics into perspective, his final lap was nine seconds slower than 
his fastest qualifying lap.

“We did it!” Rosberg cheers over team radio. He had to keep his cool as 
Hamilton turned up the pressure in the only way he could, backing Rosberg up 
against his team’s wishes, but a nervy second place was enough to seal the 
title by five points.

Lap 54/55 Hamilton to Mercedes: “Right now I’m losing the world championship 
so I’m not really bothered if I’m going to lose this race.” Vettel takes a look 
down the inside of Rosberg but can’t get through. Rosberg isn’t going to thank 
his team-mate for this.

Lap 53/55 Barely a second between Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel in P1, 2 and 3 
as the trio sweep around Yas Marina together. Rosberg will be the world 
champion even if he lets Vettel through – Verstappen is a further second back.

Lap 52/55 A brilliant move by Vettel who hurls his Ferrari around Verstappen’s 
Red Bull where there seemed no space to do so. He’s third and he is closing in 
on Rosberg’s rear wing. This isn’t over just yet, though remember Rosberg only 
needs to finish on the podium.

Lap 49/55 This is even more interesting: Rosberg has requested over team radio 
that Mercedes instruct Hamilton to let him through, saying he would cede the 
lead back to Hamilton at the end of the race if they were in the clear. Rosberg 
is not happy with just how slowly Hamilton is taking it, creating pressure from 
behind with Verstappen and Vettel closing in.

Lap 47/55 Vettel fires around the outside and almost collides with the front 
wing of Ricciardo as he completes the pass. Vettel is fourth and is around 6sec 
off the front of the race, with Hamilton slowing down significantly to back 
Rosberg into the pack. Interesting.

Lap 46/55 Hamilton is warned on team radio: “Vettel is an imminent threat,” 
after the Ferrari set a new fastest lap on his fresh-ish set of soft tyres. 
Considering how comfortable Rosberg has been so far, Hamilton will be relieved 
to hear that there is finally some pressure on his team-mate.

Lap 43/55 Rosberg is 12 uneventful laps from winning his first F1 world title. 
There is an event at the back, courtesy of Jolyon Palmer who nudges the back of 
Carlos Sainz and sends the Toro Rosso spinning.

Lap 39/55 Suddenly some chaos, firstly on the track as Ocon collides clumsily 
with Nasr at the back of the pack, sending debris into the air which Palmer 
butts off track with his nose cone. Then in the pits, where Vettel has a 
scruffy stop and various Ferrari mechanics throw red arms into the air in 
frustration. He returns in sixth.

Jenson Button speaks from the paddock: “I enjoyed today massively, the race 
was short but I enjoyed it. I’ll miss driving the car, and the team spirit, and 
I’ll have to find it elsewhere. People will say ‘oh it’s so sad Jenson didn’t 
finish on a high’ but it’s not. I’m happy.”

Lap 30/55 What should be Rosberg’s last stop of the season is perfectly 
executed by the Mercedes mechanics, and critically he returns well ahead of 
Verstappen and Ricciardo.

Lap 27/55 Ferrari react quickly to that pit stop but the undercut has worked 
beautifully for Ricciardo. Raikkonen pits and returns just behind the 
Australian’s Red Bull, and at the same time Verstappen skips past Pérez into 
fourth. Two key moves for the Red Bulls.

Lap 25/55 Hamilton is more than 4sec ahead of his team-mate, but crucially 
Rosberg has opened up a big lead over Raikkonen of around 7sec. Just as things 
are settling down, Ricciardo makes an early move for his second stop. He puts 
on the yellow-rimmed soft tyres and will run to the end.

Lap 20/55 Ricciardo tries to make a move on Raikkonen, but he runs wide and 
almost gives up fifth place to Vettel behind him. Up ahead Rosberg takes on 
Verstappen and when at first he doesn’t succeed, he comes back for more using 
DRS to get around the outside and fend off the young Red Bull driver! That was 
a brilliant move which carried an awful lot of risk.

So Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> clung on to 
finish second in Abu Dhabi and secure his first F1 world title. Lewis 
Hamilton’s next task will be to explain his tactics to Mercedes, though it did 
make for a far more interesting finale so perhaps we should thank him. Outside 
the Mercedes bubble, Sebastian Vettel sealed fourth in the championship and 
Force India took fourth in the constructors’ race, while Jenson Button and 
Felipe Massa waved goodbye to the sport. That’s all from me, you can read our 
race report right below. Bye!

Mercedes’ Paddy Lowe, whose instructions Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> ignored: “To come through 
three amazing seasons, I think it’s nice and balanced that both guys have got a 
world championship under their belt. I don’t want to comment too much [on 
Hamilton’s tactics]. We weren’t driving the car, we don’t know how fast it was, 
but it did present some challenges. It was great to see Sebastian coming 
through which was a very good strategy from Ferrari. It was nail-biting for us 
on the pitwall, those final two laps. You don’t often see four cars crossing 
the line so close together.”
 
Nico Rosberg speaks! “That was definitely not the most enjoyable race, with 
Max at the beginning and then those guys coming up at the end. I’m glad it’s 
over, I’m ecstatic. I’m very, very proud to have done the feat that my dad 
achieved. It will be exciting to see him.”
 
Lewis Hamilton chats about himself winning races before remembering to 
congratulate Rosberg on his achievement. They share an awkward handshake, which 
David Coulthard makes them reenact for reasons which are not obvious.
 
Hamilton and Rosberg share a podium but not a conversation or even a 
handshake, it seems. David Coulthard steps up for a bit of interview chat.

Rosberg spins a few donuts on the pit-straight before diving into his team of

Here’s our initial race report:

Mercedes’ Niki Lauda: “We need to speak to [Lewis] to give him an explanation. 
We tried to tell him, but he said ‘Leave me alone I know what I’m doing’ and 
thank God it worked out. I think it could have been done easier.” To put Lewis 
Hamilton’s tactics into perspective, his final lap was nine seconds slower than 
his fastest qualifying lap.
 
Hamilton’s Abu Dhabi GP win is his 10th of the season, the most any driver has 
picked up in a single year without winning the world title.
 
“We did it!” Rosberg cheers over team radio. He had to keep his cool as 
Hamilton turned up the pressure in the only way he could, backing Rosberg up 
against his team’s wishes, but a nervy second place was enough to seal the 
title by five points.
 
Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> wins the Abu 
Dhabi Grand Prix but Rosberg follows him through to win the drivers’ world 
championship, matching his father’s achievement 34 years ago.

Final lap Vettel starts the last lap with another attack but he can’t make it 
stick andNico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> is going 
to hold to win his maiden world championship, despite his team-mate’s best 
efforts.
 
Lap 54/55 Hamilton to Mercedes: “Right now I’m losing the world championship 
so I’m not really bothered if I’m going to lose this race.” Vettel takes a look 
down the inside of Rosberg but can’t get through. Rosberg isn’t going to thank 
his team-mate for this.
 
Lap 53/55 Barely a second between Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel in P1, 2 and 3 
as the trio sweep around Yas Marina together. Rosberg will be the world 
champion even if he lets Vettel through – Verstappen is a further second back.
 
Mercedes’ Paddy Lowe instructs Hamilton: “Pick up the pace to win the race.” 

Hamilton: “I’m actually in the lead right now. I’m quite comfortable.”
 
Lap 52/55 A brilliant move by Vettel who hurls his Ferrari around Verstappen’s 
Red Bull where there seemed no space to do so. He’s third and he is closing in 
on Rosberg’s rear wing. This isn’t over just yet, though remember Rosberg only 
needs to finish on the podium.
 
Lap 51/55 Verstappen is digging in and refusing to let Vettel pass. “Consider 
doing something?” suggests Rosberg to Mercedes up ahead, but Hamilton answers 
to no one at this point.
 
Lap 50/55 Shockingly it doesn’t appear Hamilton is going to let Rosberg 
through. Behind them, Vettel is trying to attack Verstappen and move into third 
but the Red Bull is not giving in easily.
 
Lap 49/55 This is even more interesting: Rosberg has requested over team radio 
that Mercedes instruct Hamilton to let him through, saying he would cede the 
lead back to Hamilton at the end of the race if they were in the clear. Rosberg 
is not happy with just how slowly Hamilton is taking it, creating pressure from 
behind with Verstappen and Vettel closing in.
 
Mercedes to Hamilton: “OK Lewis, this is an instruction: you need a 45.1 for 
the win.”

Hamilton to Mercedes: “I suggest you let us race.”
 
Lap 47/55 Vettel fires around the outside and almost collides with the front 
wing of Ricciardo as he completes the pass. Vettel is fourth and is around 6sec 
off the front of the race, with Hamilton slowing down significantly to back 
Rosberg into the pack. Interesting.

Mason/Getty Images  
Lap 46/55 Hamilton is warned on team radio: “Vettel is an imminent threat,” 
after the Ferrari set a new fastest lap on his fresh-ish set of soft tyres. 
Considering how comfortable Rosberg has been so far, Hamilton will be relieved 
to hear that there is finally some pressure on his team-mate.
 
Lap 44/55 Palmer pits and is under investigation for that incident which 
looked pretty careless on replay.
 
Lap 43/55 Rosberg is 12 uneventful laps from winning his first F1 world title. 
There is an event at the back, courtesy of Jolyon Palmer who nudges the back of 
Carlos Sainz and sends the Toro Rosso spinning.
 
Lap 42/55 Ferrari give Raikkonen the nod to let Vettel through into fifth, and 
that will help the German to secure fourth in the world championship ahead of 
Verstappen. “You need to give me the times of other cars please,” says Hamilton 
on team radio.
 
Lap 40/55 Vettel’s stop restores Hamilton’s place at the front of the race 
with Rosberg 1.2sec behind him. A Mercedes one-two will win Rosberg the world 
championship by five points.

Lap 39/55 Suddenly some chaos, firstly on the track as Ocon collides clumsily 
with Nasr at the back of the pack, sending debris into the air which Palmer 
butts off track with his nose cone. Then in the pits, where Vettel has a 
scruffy stop and various Ferrari mechanics throw red arms into the air in 
frustration. He returns in sixth.
 
Lap 37/55 “These tyres are really starting to go now,” says Vettel. The race 
leader is 5.5sec clear of Hamilton and sounds about ready to make his second 
stop. Rosberg remains trailing his team-mate by around 1.5sec.
 
Lap 35/55 Alonso sees another Force India boom past as Sergio Pérez pushes the 
McLaren back to ninth.
 
Lap 34/55 Hülkenberg screams past Alonso at turn one with some late braking to 
pinch seventh.
 
Lap 33/55 Vettel currently leads Hamilton by 7sec, and Rosberg by 8sec, with 
the Ferrari driver still to make his second pit stop. This is all going to plan 
forNico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>.

Jenson Button speaks from the paddock: “I enjoyed today massively, the race 
was short but I enjoyed it. I’ll miss driving the car, and the team spirit, and 
I’ll have to find it elsewhere. People will say ‘oh it’s so sad Jenson didn’t 
finish on a high’ but it’s not. I’m happy.”
 
Lap 30/55 What should be Rosberg’s last stop of the season is perfectly 
executed by the Mercedes mechanics, and critically he returns well ahead of 
Verstappen and Ricciardo.
 
Lap 29/55 It’s a routine 2.5sec stop for Hamilton, and momentarily Rosberg 
leads the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix until the German is called in by Mercedes at the 
end of the lap...
 
Lap 28/55 Pérez comes in for his second stop, and the Mercedes mechanics are 
prepping for a stop of their own – in comes Hamilton.
 
Lap 27/55 Ferrari react quickly to that pit stop but the undercut has worked 
beautifully for Ricciardo. Raikkonen pits and returns just behind the 
Australian’s Red Bull, and at the same time Verstappen skips past Pérez into 
fourth. Two key moves for the Red Bulls.
 
Lap 25/55 Hamilton is more than 4sec ahead of his team-mate, but crucially 
Rosberg has opened up a big lead over Raikkonen of around 7sec. Just as things 
are settling down, Ricciardo makes an early move for his second stop. He puts 
on the yellow-rimmed soft tyres and will run to the end.
