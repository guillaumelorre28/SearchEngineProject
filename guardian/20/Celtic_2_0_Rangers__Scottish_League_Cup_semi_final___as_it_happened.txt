Ronny Deila heads over to the Celtic fans and leads the celebrations with a 
series of fist-pumps which the crowd respond to with roars. His side are top of 
the league and into the season’s first cup final. Scott Brown was Roy 
Keane-esque in midfield, Virgil van Dijk marshalled the defence with ease and 
Kris Commons was a class act off the front. Surely Celtic must tie him down to 
a new contract. ForRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> it 
was a disappointing afternoon. They showed some fighting spirit in the second 
half but the misery continues.

90+2 min: Johansen finds Izaguirre in acres of space on the left and he is 
hauled down unceremoniously. Commons takes the free-kick but Rangers clear and 
Brown crunches Black rather brutally from behind. The Rangers players erupt in 
fury. Brown gets yellow and points to the scoreboard to taunt theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> players.

84 min: The players square up on the edge of the Rangers area and Guidetti is 
at the centre of it. He tries to wriggle free with the ball but is bundled over 
by McCulloch, who then accidentally treads on him. SomehowRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> get a free-kick and a few 
players have to be pulled apart.

77 min: The Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> fans are in 
full voice, believing their place in the final is already assured. Guidetti 
goes on a run down the left before the ball falls to Forrest. He drops the 
shoulder, ducks inside and has a crack but it’s easy for Simonsen.

70 min: Wallace wins the ball down the left with a robust challenge and has 
the chance to aim for Miller and Daly in the box. He mis-hits and the ball 
floats harmlessly over the bar. Rangers’ crossing has been truly abject today.

62 min: Griffiths is in behind on the right again after another route one ball 
unsettles theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> defence. He 
opts to take it first time with his weaker right foot but it’s a poor effort 
and comes to nothing.

anger after a foul is not given in the centre circle. It’s a long way back but 
at least the Ibrox club are competing now.

57 min: Stokes pumps a long ball forward and Griffiths is ahead of the last 
man. He uses his body to hold off Black but just as he is about to get his shot 
away the midfielder gets a foot in to knock the ball away. TheCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> fans howl for a penalty and Black 
did have his hands on the striker but the referee waves play on.

51 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> are much 
quicker in the tackle at the start of the second half but are still struggling 
to get out of their own half. Johansen finds space between the lines and plays 
a delightful little outside of the foot ball through to Commons bursting beyond 
the strikers. He is squeezed out before he can get any real purchase on his 
shot though.

48 min: Black fouls Johansen near the right touchline. Commons’s free-kick 
does not beat the first man but he picks the ball up gain, beats his marker and 
lets fly with his left from 25 yards again. It bounces viciously in front of 
Simonsen but he manages to push it away to safety.

Half-time: Celtic 2-0 Rangers

Well that was far too easy for the champions. They dominated the ball from the 
first minute and bullied Rangers off it when they did concede possession. 
Griffiths and Commons were clinical when given their chance and Celtic would 
have had more were it not for some poor refereeing and a great save from 
Simonsen, who might have done better for both goals.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> need to make changes at the 
break or they may be in for a hiding.

41 min: Great save by Simonsen. Stokes gathers on the left and crosses to 
Griffiths who nods down to Johansen breaking into the box. The winger meets it 
first time left-footed with the goal at his mercy but the goalkeeper stretches 
out a leg to keep the ball out.

39 min: Griffiths is released down the left and wins a corner off McGregor. 
Stokes puts another vicious inswinger into the six-yard box and this time Van 
Dijk meets it. It’s a wonderful chance but the giant Dutch centre-back 
shoulders it over.

35 min: Brown wins a rugged 50-50 with Black in the centre of the pitch and 
releases Griffiths with a dinked through ball. The goalscorer is through in 20 
yards of space but the referee calls the play back to give Celtic the 
free-kick. That is madness from the man in charge and theCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> players let him know that in no 
uncertain terms.

Celtic break down the left and Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> get a frantic foot in on the 
edge of the box. Unfortunately for them the ball breaks to Commons hanging 
around the D. Everyone knows what’s coming next and Commons delivers with 
aplomb, taking one touch with his right before arrowing a left-footed strike 
past Simonsen’s despairing dive and into the far top corner. Woof.

27 min: Gordon releases Stokes down the left with a quick throw out. The 
former Arsenal striker gives the ball away but it breaks kindly to him again 
and he fires a shot in from 25 yards. It has some pace and dip but is always 
going over the bar.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> eventually win a free-kick but 
send another straight into the arms of Gordon, who has got himself back into

15 min: The goal has come as a a real body blow to Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> and they are struggling to get a 
foothold in the game or get any service to Kenny Miller up front. Celtic break 
down the right and Johansen feeds Lustig who whips the ball in at pace. 
Griffiths meets it again but can only drift a header wide of goal this time. 
Good chance that.

Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> fail to close down the 
space on the right-hand side and Stefan Johansen is able to lift his head, pick 
out a players and place a perfect left-footed cross on to the head of Leigh 
Griffiths, who rises high and heads over Simonsen and into the net. Griffiths 
is booked for his celebrations but he has justified his selection within the 
first 10 minutes.

there’s nothing at all in that. That battle between the two midfield warriors

There are some worries about the Hampden pitch today. It was not great for the 
Dundee United v Aberdeen semi-final yesterday and seemed to be cutting up badly 
towards the end of the game. Will this give Rangers hope of closing the gap in 
class to reach theScottish League Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup> final? We’ll find out 
in two minutes time.

Celtic were one of the clubs who voted for Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> to be demoted to the third 
division, but it has hit them financially. Ewan Murray considers whether it is 
productive or mutually beneficial for the Old Firm’s separation to continue.

In the summer of 2012, Celtic’s board of directors found themselves in an 
invidious position, and through no fault whatsoever of their own. Thedebate 
surrounding which tier of Scottish football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jul/12/rangers-scottish-football-league>
 Rangers should restart football affairs after liquidation was frenzied in 
nature. Celtic’s supporters, and to be fair most others in the country, were 
noisily adamant Rangers should be placed in Division Three. An attempt by the 
Scottish Premier League to parachute the Ibrox club in at a higher level was 
understandably rejected. Still, bad feeling over that affair andthe actions of 
the game’s administrators 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/12/rangers-scottish-football-mess>
 has never really disappeared.

Celtic kept their powder dry before eventually admitting they had voted 
against a top-flightRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
proposal in order to protect “the integrity of the game”. Peter Lawwell, 
Celtic’s chief executive, had spoken earlier in the year of a standalone 
financial strategy. “We look after ourselves,” Lawwell added. “We don’t need 
any other club.”

In the context of the Old Firm, there is clear evidence which contradicts that 
sentiment. Lawwell may even have realised that at the time, while for obvious 
reasons being unable to say so in public. By last August, the chief executive 
was estimating that Rangers’ absence from the top flight was costingCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> £10m a season. Scottish football 
has a tedious league set-up which is entirely predicated on the earlier 
insistence from television companies of four Old Firm fixtures a season, a 
laughable scenario in many ways yet an unfortunate, telling reality.

So let’s look at those teams in more detail. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> make three changes from the side 
that beat Ross Country last time out. Guidetti, the on-loan Manchster City 
striker whose claim he wanted a hat-trick in this match caused such 
controversy, drops to the bench along with Matthews and Henderson. Lustig, 
Johansen and Stokes come into the side.

Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> make two changes with 
Aird replacing Templeton and midfielder Black in for striker Daly as Kenny 
McDowall looks to strengthen in the centre of the pitch.

Preamble

The last time these two sides met in April 2012 the Rangers players trudged 
off the field to the sound of the Three Degrees classic When Will I see You 
Again blaring over the Celtic Park Tannoy system. The home fans were in party 
mood after watching the champions elect deliver a comprehensive 3-0 victory 
over their bitter rivals, but it was the farcical and spectacular demise of the 
Ibrox club that they were revelling in most. Rangers were facing the prospect 
of life outside the top tier of Scottish football, and three months later their 
worst fears were realised when the other clubs votedto banish them to the third 
division 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/05/spl-counts-cost-of-rangers-banishment>
 for the financial implosion that sent them into liquidation. Football in 
Scotland has not been the same since.
Today, almost three years after the last man was clattered from behind in an 
Old Firm Derby, the two clubs will finally see each other again, witha place in 
the Scottish League Cup final against Dundee United up for grabs 
<http://http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/31/dundee-united-aberdeen-scottish-league-cup-match-report>
. Celtic sit top of the Premiership, having won their last four league matches 
without conceding a goal, and with Ronny Deila’s methods finally starting to 
bear fruit. Rangers are second in the Championship, 16 points behind Hearts and 
having seen their last two games postponed due to the weather. They are also 
currently embroiled in yet more off-field drama as the ever divisive Mike 
Ashley wrestles for control of the club.
Will any of this matter once the players get out in the pitch? Unlikely. Will 
there be rash tackles, flashpoints and flare-ups? Almost certainly. Will 
absence have made the players and fans grow fonder? Never. The Old Firm derby 
is back.


Kick off: 1.30pm

Ronny Deila heads over to the Celtic fans and leads the celebrations with a 
series of fist-pumps which the crowd respond to with roars. His side are top of 
the league and into the season’s first cup final. Scott Brown was Roy 
Keane-esque in midfield, Virgil van Dijk marshalled the defence with ease and 
Kris Commons was a class act off the front. Surely Celtic must tie him down to 
a new contract. ForRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> it 
was a disappointing afternoon. They showed some fighting spirit in the second 
half but the misery continues.
  
Celtic are into the Scottish League Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup> final to face Dundee 
United, and they did it with ease.

90+2 min: Johansen finds Izaguirre in acres of space on the left and he is 
hauled down unceremoniously. Commons takes the free-kick but Rangers clear and 
Brown crunches Black rather brutally from behind. The Rangers players erupt in 
fury. Brown gets yellow and points to the scoreboard to taunt theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> players.
 
90 min: McCulloch hoofs forward and Daly gives chase, but his flicked ball 
into space is easily claimed by Gordon.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> are mustering very little here.
 
87 min: Bitton strolls languidly towards the Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> goal but the Israeli 
midfielder’s poked shot is tame, dribbling wide of Simonsen’s net.
 
84 min: The players square up on the edge of the Rangers area and Guidetti is 
at the centre of it. He tries to wriggle free with the ball but is bundled over 
by McCulloch, who then accidentally treads on him. SomehowRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> get a free-kick and a few 
players have to be pulled apart.
 
81 min: Rangers substitution. Clark on for the 35-year-old Miller, who looks 
shot after battling up front on his own for much of the game.
 
80 min: Celtic’s flair players are having a field day now. Forrest swaps short 
passes with Commons and drives into the box, beating McCulloch and Foster with 
ease before crossing but the ball goes to safety.
 
77 min: The Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> fans are in 
full voice, believing their place in the final is already assured. Guidetti 
goes on a run down the left before the ball falls to Forrest. He drops the 
shoulder, ducks inside and has a crack but it’s easy for Simonsen.
 
73 min: Celtic substitution. Forrest on for Stokes, who has only ever scored 
once againstRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>. He won’t 
improve that tally this afternoon.
 
70 min: Wallace wins the ball down the left with a robust challenge and has 
the chance to aim for Miller and Daly in the box. He mis-hits and the ball 
floats harmlessly over the bar. Rangers’ crossing has been truly abject today.
 
68 min: Celtic substitution. Guidetti comes on to replace Griffiths. The boos 
ring out from theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
faithful. Guidetti has 22 minutes to score the hat-trick he desires.
 
65 min: Rangers manage to build up some pressure and Black has the chance to 
shoot from the edge of the box but is crowded out. Brown then comes in to sort 
things out forCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>. He really 
has been immense today. How he must have missed the Old Firm derbies these past 
three years.
 
62 min: Griffiths is in behind on the right again after another route one ball 
unsettles theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> defence. He 
opts to take it first time with his weaker right foot but it’s a poor effort 
and comes to nothing.
 
60 min: Tackles are flying in and the Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> bench are up on their feet in 
anger after a foul is not given in the centre circle. It’s a long way back but 
at least the Ibrox club are competing now.
 
57 min: Stokes pumps a long ball forward and Griffiths is ahead of the last 
man. He uses his body to hold off Black but just as he is about to get his shot 
away the midfielder gets a foot in to knock the ball away. TheCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> fans howl for a penalty and Black 
did have his hands on the striker but the referee waves play on.

55 min: Miller gets away down the right and manages to get his cross into the 
near post but Gordon claims. Miller has stayed down after being clattered by 
Van Dijk and theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
supporters are not happy but there was no malice in the challenge.
 
52 min: Celtic win a free-kick on the edge of the Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> box. Griffiths takes command and 
whips the ball left-footed over the wall but narrowly past Simonsen’s left-hand 
post.
 
51 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> are much 
quicker in the tackle at the start of the second half but are still struggling 
to get out of their own half. Johansen finds space between the lines and plays 
a delightful little outside of the foot ball through to Commons bursting beyond 
the strikers. He is squeezed out before he can get any real purchase on his 
shot though.
 
48 min: Black fouls Johansen near the right touchline. Commons’s free-kick 
does not beat the first man but he picks the ball up gain, beats his marker and 
lets fly with his left from 25 yards again. It bounces viciously in front of 
Simonsen but he manages to push it away to safety.
 
46 min: Rangers have brought on Jon Daly to replace the 19-year-old Canadian 
Fraser Aird in a bid to get some forward momentum. Kris Boyd remains on the 
bench though.
  
Well that was far too easy for the champions. They dominated the ball from the 
first minute and bullied Rangers off it when they did concede possession. 
Griffiths and Commons were clinical when given their chance and Celtic would 
have had more were it not for some poor refereeing and a great save from 
Simonsen, who might have done better for both goals.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> need to make changes at the 
break or they may be in for a hiding.
 
42 min: Lustig gets a yellow card for a studs up challenge in an irrelevant 
area of the pitch. Silly that.
 
41 min: Great save by Simonsen. Stokes gathers on the left and crosses to 
Griffiths who nods down to Johansen breaking into the box. The winger meets it 
first time left-footed with the goal at his mercy but the goalkeeper stretches 
out a leg to keep the ball out.
 
39 min: Griffiths is released down the left and wins a corner off McGregor. 
Stokes puts another vicious inswinger into the six-yard box and this time Van 
Dijk meets it. It’s a wonderful chance but the giant Dutch centre-back 
shoulders it over.
 
35 min: Brown wins a rugged 50-50 with Black in the centre of the pitch and 
releases Griffiths with a dinked through ball. The goalscorer is through in 20 
yards of space but the referee calls the play back to give Celtic the 
free-kick. That is madness from the man in charge and theCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> players let him know that in no 
uncertain terms.
 
Celtic break down the left and Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> get a frantic foot in on the 
edge of the box. Unfortunately for them the ball breaks to Commons hanging 
around the D. Everyone knows what’s coming next and Commons delivers with 
aplomb, taking one touch with his right before arrowing a left-footed strike 
past Simonsen’s despairing dive and into the far top corner. Woof.
 
What a screamer!

29 min: Stokes whips in an inswinging corner from the left and Van Dijk is 
narrowly beatean to the ball by Hutton. The ball goes straight up in the air 
and Simonsen gets a poor punch on it but the referee blows for a foul.
 
27 min: Gordon releases Stokes down the left with a quick throw out. The 
former Arsenal striker gives the ball away but it breaks kindly to him again 
and he fires a shot in from 25 yards. It has some pace and dip but is always 
going over the bar.
 
23 min: Brown is dictating play from the base of the Celtic midfield and Van 
Dijk is strolling forward from centre-back to link the play.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> eventually win a free-kick but 
send another straight into the arms of Gordon, who has got himself back into 
the Scotland squad recently after two years out of the game.
 
19 min: Nice play down the left by Miller results in Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> forcing a corner but Aird sends 
it miles too deep and the ball ends up back with Simonsen 10 seconds later.
 
15 min: The goal has come as a a real body blow to Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> and they are struggling to get a 
foothold in the game or get any service to Kenny Miller up front. Celtic break 
down the right and Johansen feeds Lustig who whips the ball in at pace. 
Griffiths meets it again but can only drift a header wide of goal this time. 
Good chance that.

 
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> fail to close down the 
space on the right-hand side and Stefan Johansen is able to lift his head, pick 
out a players and place a perfect left-footed cross on to the head of Leigh 
Griffiths, who rises high and heads over Simonsen and into the net. Griffiths 
is booked for his celebrations but he has justified his selection within the 
first 10 minutes.
 
Great cross and great header. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> draw first blood.

8 min: Brown is late on Hutton and gives away a free-kick in a dangerous 
position. Smith takes but fires it too close to the keeper and Gordon claims 
with ease.
 
5 min: Ian Black goes down as if he has been poleaxed by Scott Brown but 
there’s nothing at all in that. That battle between the two midfield warriors 
will be one to keep an eye on though.
 
2 min: Celtic put Rangers under some early pressure, dominating the ball and 
causing some slightly panicked defending beforeRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> finally get some possession to 
calm the nerves.
 
There are some worries about the Hampden pitch today. It was not great for the 
Dundee United v Aberdeen semi-final yesterday and seemed to be cutting up badly 
towards the end of the game. Will this give Rangers hope of closing the gap in 
class to reach theScottish League Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup> final? We’ll find out 
in two minutes time.
   
Celtic were one of the clubs who voted for Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> to be demoted to the third 
division, but it has hit them financially. Ewan Murray considers whether it is 
productive or mutually beneficial for the Old Firm’s separation to continue.

In the summer of 2012, Celtic’s board of directors found themselves in an 
invidious position, and through no fault whatsoever of their own. Thedebate 
surrounding which tier of Scottish football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jul/12/rangers-scottish-football-league>
 Rangers should restart football affairs after liquidation was frenzied in 
nature. Celtic’s supporters, and to be fair most others in the country, were 
noisily adamant Rangers should be placed in Division Three. An attempt by the 
Scottish Premier League to parachute the Ibrox club in at a higher level was 
understandably rejected. Still, bad feeling over that affair andthe actions of 
the game’s administrators 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/12/rangers-scottish-football-mess>
 has never really disappeared.

Celtic kept their powder dry before eventually admitting they had voted 
against a top-flightRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
proposal in order to protect “the integrity of the game”. Peter Lawwell, 
Celtic’s chief executive, had spoken earlier in the year of a standalone 
financial strategy. “We look after ourselves,” Lawwell added. “We don’t need 
any other club.”

In the context of the Old Firm, there is clear evidence which contradicts that 
sentiment. Lawwell may even have realised that at the time, while for obvious 
reasons being unable to say so in public. By last August, the chief executive 
was estimating that Rangers’ absence from the top flight was costingCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> £10m a season. Scottish football 
has a tedious league set-up which is entirely predicated on the earlier 
insistence from television companies of four Old Firm fixtures a season, a 
laughable scenario in many ways yet an unfortunate, telling reality.

So let’s look at those teams in more detail. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> make three changes from the side 
that beat Ross Country last time out. Guidetti, the on-loan Manchster City 
striker whose claim he wanted a hat-trick in this match caused such 
controversy, drops to the bench along with Matthews and Henderson. Lustig, 
Johansen and Stokes come into the side.

Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> make two changes with 
Aird replacing Templeton and midfielder Black in for striker Daly as Kenny 
McDowall looks to strengthen in the centre of the pitch.

The last time these two sides met in April 2012 the Rangers players trudged 
off the field to the sound of the Three Degrees classic When Will I see You 
Again blaring over the Celtic Park Tannoy system. The home fans were in party 
mood after watching the champions elect deliver a comprehensive 3-0 victory 
over their bitter rivals, but it was the farcical and spectacular demise of the 
Ibrox club that they were revelling in most. Rangers were facing the prospect 
of life outside the top tier of Scottish football, and three months later their 
worst fears were realised when the other clubs votedto banish them to the third 
division 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/05/spl-counts-cost-of-rangers-banishment>
 for the financial implosion that sent them into liquidation. Football in 
Scotland has not been the same since.
Today, almost three years after the last man was clattered from behind in an 
Old Firm Derby, the two clubs will finally see each other again, witha place in 
the Scottish League Cup final against Dundee United up for grabs 
<http://http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/31/dundee-united-aberdeen-scottish-league-cup-match-report>
. Celtic sit top of the Premiership, having won their last four league matches 
without conceding a goal, and with Ronny Deila’s methods finally starting to 
bear fruit. Rangers are second in the Championship, 16 points behind Hearts and 
having seen their last two games postponed due to the weather. They are also 
currently embroiled in yet more off-field drama as the ever divisive Mike 
Ashley wrestles for control of the club.
Will any of this matter once the players get out in the pitch? Unlikely. Will 
there be rash tackles, flashpoints and flare-ups? Almost certainly. Will 
absence have made the players and fans grow fonder? Never. The Old Firm derby 
is back.
