How religious are you? To find out, answer these questions:

1) Bill can drink a barrel of beer in six days. Bert can drink a barrel of 
beer in 12 days (assume they’re both really going for it). How long would it 
take them to drink a barrel together?

2) When it comes to maths, Jane is pretty average. In fact, on a recent test, 
her mark was both the 15th highest and the 15th lowest in the class. How many 
students are there in the class?

3) Ernie is a keen eBayer. He buys a rare comic for £60, sells it for £70, 
buys it back again for £80, then finally sells it for £90. What was his final 
profit?


Of course your answers (see below) can’t directly tell us anything about your 
own religious beliefs. But a recent study conducted in Canada found that 
atheists scored around 19% higher on such tests than people who identified as 
affiliated to a religion. The researchers also combined the findings of 
previous studies on this topic (more than 15,000 participants) into a 
meta-analysis, finding a significant, though modest, negative relationship 
between test performance and religious belief (0.18 on a scale from 0 to 1). 
These findings, on their own, don’t necessarily suggest that religious people 
are less intelligent, but that they tend to have a thinking style that is more 
intuitive than analytical.
