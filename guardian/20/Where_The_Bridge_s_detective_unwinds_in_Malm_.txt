The Ribersborgs Kallbadhus (cold bathing house) is at the end of a very long 
pier in the Öresund strait, the narrow sea channel between Sweden and Denmark. 
The location is stunning. From the pier there are views over the sea to the 
Öresund Bridge, which links the two countries. The Kallbadhus, built in 1898, 
offers sea swimming in outdoor unheated pools all year around – they get really 
cold in winter. As a true Swede I love a hot sauna, and I’ve also taken to the 
ancient Nordic tradition of swimming in the sea in the winter. At the 
Ribersborgs you can enjoy a long sauna and then go straight outside for a dip 
in the ice-cold sea. It’s a great endorphin kick.

You meet a great mix of people at the bath house – it’s frequented by little 
old ladies. People have swum here for centuries and you can really feel the 
history, the ancient traditions and the unchanged atmosphere. It is extremely 
calm and relaxing, a break from the fast pace of modern life.

 Bathers swim in the sea through the winter. 
When I’ve finished my sauna and swim, I go for a nice walk in the western 
harbour, a newly-built area of Malmö where the old harbour used to be. It is 
surrounded by canals and waterways and the architecture is modern and 
innovative – the landmark Turning Torso skyscraper, designed by Santiago 
Calatrava, is the star of the show. In The Bridge, my character, Saga Norén, 
lives in an apartment building close to here.
