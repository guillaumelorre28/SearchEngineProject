Although gazpacho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jun/24/how-to-make-perfect-gazpacho>
 may be more famous these days, ajo blanco is the original cold soup from one 
of the hottest parts of Europe. Predating the arrival of the new world’s 
tomatoes and peppers by several centuries, this thrifty mixture of Andalusian 
staplesdates back to the Moorish middle ages 
<http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/id/64/> – indeed, 
we have them to thank for the region’s abundant almond crop.

Stale bread, moistened with vinegar and water, thickened with nuts and spiced 
up with garlic is a richer proposition than gazpacho’s salad in a bowl, but 
well chilled, ajo blanco’s natural creaminess makes it a uniquely refreshing 
proposition, and a lovely starter for a summer lunch or dinner party.

The almonds

Despite the name of the soup, garlic is rarely the principal ingredient in ajo 
blanco, which I would characterise instead as an almond soup. The nuts can 
certainly take credit for the blanco element anyway: whizzed up with water, 
they create a kind of milk, which gives the dish its creamy colour and 
consistency. For this reason, they must be blanched to remove the skins – easy, 
if fiddly, to do yourself, but even easier to let someone else do for you.

Simon Hopkinson <http://www.simonhopkinson.tv/recipe/13/ajo-blanco.aspx> 
toasts the almonds lightly “to slightly gild; the palest, very palest tinge is 
all that is necessary, just to accentuate the taste of the nut” – and, as 
usual, he’s right (as well as poetic). Although the almonds shouldn’t dominate 
the flavour (adding almond extract, as one online recipe suggests, seems to me 
to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the soup), it’s nice to be able to 
taste them as well as see them.

Frank Camorra and Richard Cornish’s book MoVida 
<http://munchandnibble.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/ajo-blanco-or-dazzlingly-good-chilled.html>
, named after Camorra’s Australian restaurants, directs readers to soak the 
almonds in water overnight, presumably to soften them. If you’re going to use a 
pestle and mortar in the traditional fashion then this is probably helpful, but 
I don’t find my blender has much trouble.

The bread

The other white element. As befits as peasant dish, no doubt it would 
originally have been made with rough brown bread, but the modern version relies 
on refined flour for its colour. That said, I wouldn’t recommend using pappy 
soft white bread here – from previous adventures insummer pudding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jul/06/how-cook-perfect-summer-pudding>
 and the like, I find it becomes unpleasantly gummy when wet. A more robustly 
textured white loaf, the kind that doesn’t dissolve into mush at the merest 
hint of liquid, is ideal. I used a sourdough, but whatever you happen to have 
going stale will do.

Conversely, soaking the bread briefly does seem to give the soup a creamier 
texture, although I’m not sure why. You don’t need to leave it a full two 
hours, as Jeff Koehler’s book Spain suggests 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0cPVVesnAZoC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=ajo+blanco+grapes&source=bl&ots=hxuJMxoXjS&sig=0MYH2WH_LwmloNYGtdSTU9RhGDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirmM_umtzMAhWjAcAKHYHAAHE4HhDoAQgyMAM#v=onepage&q=ajo%20blanco%20grapes&f=false>
; even 10 minutes seems to do the trick. Restauranteurs Sam and Eddie Hart soak 
theirs in milk rather than water in their book Modern Spanish Cooking, while 
blogger Myriam de Solages <http://www.saveursenbalade.com/en/node/1093> prefers 
the almond variety, writing that “while it is true that milk is not essential 
in this recipe, ajo blanco tastes better when made with milk instead of water. 
It is even tastier if you use almond milk!” She’s right, it’s not essential, 
but a little milk at this stage does add a certain richness to the dish. I 
prefer the dairy variety, simply because almond milk isn’t terribly creamy, but 
feel free to make the switch.

The liquid

De Solages dilutes the soup with almond milk as well, while Koehler uses a 
mixture of dairy and water; everyone else sticks with water. I will, too: too 
much milk and it becomes almost like a thick, nutty porridge – more of a hearty 
bread sauce than a refreshing soup.

The garlic

Garlic, like chilli, should always be added to taste: the recipes I try range 
from half a clove per person in Jenny Linford’s lovely book Garlic, to three 
times that in Hopkinson’s recipe. I think ajo blanco ought to have a certain 
fire in its belly, but I’m going to settle for a happy medium of one clove per 
diner – adjust to suit your own taste and plans for the evening.

MoVida stirs garlicky alioli into the finished soup, which makes it taste 
distinctively Spanish, but also rather rich after a few mouthfuls. I suspect 
that, in the restaurant, they serve it in tiny, sophisticated portions, but 
that’s not what I’m about.

The fruit

Traditionally, ajo blanco was little more than bread, almonds and garlic, 
seasoned with vinegar and oil, but modern recipes often take their inspiration 
from gazpacho and whizz in some fruit as well (not for nothing is ajo blanco 
sometimes known as the white gazpacho). Hopkinson and Koehler go for cucumber, 
the former with jalapeño, the latter with the grapes more often used as a 
garnish, while the Harts use apple.

the Guardian 
Although grapes would be a neat addition, they don’t add very much besides 
sweetness, which I don’t think the soup needs. Green apple supplies a more 
satisfying acidity, but, surprisingly, cucumber proves the winner. Despite its 
subtle flavour, it makes the soup taste significantly more refreshing, perhaps 
because, subconsciously, it reminds us of gazpacho. Jalapeño, however, although 
popular for its grassy heat, feels like a transgression too far; the garlic 
should provide enough punch on its own.

Oil and vinegar

As with gazpacho, I think the difference between a good ajo blanco and a great 
one lies in the generous addition of both olive oil and sherry vinegar (De 
Solages’ balsamic is too sweet; if you don’t have sherry vinegar, I’d suggest 
the red wine variety instead). Hopkinson has the right idea; don’t be shy with 
either.

Garnish

Most gazpachos come garnished with grapes, which is why sieving and double 
sieving them, as the cheffier recipes demand, is problematic – the grapes just 
sink. However, it does give the soups a silky lightness that make them a better 
bet for a light starter. If it is to stand alone as a lunch, I’d recommend 
serving it as is.

Try and find aromatic muscat grapes if you can, although Linford’s melon makes 
a lovely alternative, and everyone enjoys Hopkinson’s membrillo chunks (which 
are sitting on the bottom of the bowl in the accompanying photographs). Given 
this is a meal in a bowl, however, a bit of textural contrast is welcome. This 
is why, I think, the Harts’ miniature salad of apple, raisins and pine nuts, 
and De Solages’ flaked almonds both prove so popular with testers. It’s always 
nice to be reminded of your teeth while you still have them.

MoVida make a muscat grape granita for their garnish – a very clever idea 
indeed, being both intensely grapey, and wonderfully cooling in its own right. 
If you’re out to impress, it’s simple to whip up (all you need is a freezer and 
fork), and guaranteed to make you look like a pro.

Resting

Although you can serve ajo blanco straight away, a couple of hours in the 
fridge will allow the flavours to mellow and mingle, much like your guests over 
a cold glass of fino.

(Serves 4)
220g blanched almonds
100g slightly stale white bread (crusts off)
A little milk or almond milk (optional)
600ml ice-cold water
4 smallish garlic cloves, roughly chopped, green sprout removed if necessary
1/2 cucumber, peeled and roughly chopped
200ml extra virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to garnish
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
8 grapes

Toast the almonds in a dry pan until just starting to colour, then tip out and 
allow to cool. Set 20g aside as garnish. Soak the bread in milk for 10 minutes 
if using, or cold water if not.

Put the remaining almonds into a blender or food processor. Squeeze out the 
bread and roughly tear into the blender. Add a dash of the water and whizz for 
a minute or so until fairly finely ground. Then, with the motor running, slowly 
add the water, followed by the garlic, cucumber, oil and vinegar. Whizz until 
smooth, then season to taste. Sieve if desired, and then chill for at least 2 
hours.

Divide between shallow bowls. Quarter and seed the grapes if necessary, 
roughly chop the remaining almonds, then arrange on top of the soup and finish 
with a final drizzle of oil.

Ajo blanco: gazpacho’s less sophisticated ancestor, or a rarer, more 
interesting pleasure? And which other chilled soups would you recommend for 
when the weather perks up?
