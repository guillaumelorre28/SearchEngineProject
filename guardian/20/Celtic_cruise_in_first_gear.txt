Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, the holders, with only 
Bobo Balde and Stilian Petrov of their regular line-up included, dictated the 
pace for almost all the match but at least in the early stages Second Division 
Alloa Athletic made it an old-fashioned cup tie in every sense.

Mark Cowan sent a good header from a Jimmy Fisher free-kick just wide after 
five minutes, Gregg Watson was booked for a foul on Shaun Maloney and Alloa's 
manager Terry Christie, a headmaster, was given a taste of his own medicine 
when he was sternly lectured by the referee for some touchline antics.

That initial flurry over, however, it was on to what was expected and, despite 
a fine save by Derek Soutar from a Petrov free-kick, after 19 minutes Celtic 
took the lead.

There seemed little danger when Balde moved forward but the big defender 
unleashed a speculative 25-yard drive which took a wicked bounce off the 
less-than-perfect pitch and although Soutar got a hand to the ball it finished 
in the net.

The rest of the first half was all about Celtic trying to add to their lead, 
and Soutar excelled with fine saves to deny Balde, Bobby Petta, Olivier Tebily 
and Momo Sylla.

Ian Little was booked for a foul on Balde as he tried to stop the tide. Three 
minutes before the interval, though, it was 2-0 as Morten Wieghorst celebrated 
his return after illness by heading a Jackie McNamara cross past Soutar.

The second half was never likely to be much of a contest and Celtic, with 
Jamie Smith on for Petrov, went three goals ahead when the substitute combined 
with Sylla to give Maloney a chance he accepted gratefully in the 56th minute.

Celtic were in total control and Petta made it 4-0 with a fine solo effort 
after 75 minutes. Sylla then scored the fifth - his first for the club - from 
close range seven minutes from the end.
