Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> was faster 
than his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Friday’s second practice session 
for the Malaysian Grand Prix.

Hamilton, who will go into Sunday’s race trailing Rosberg by eight points with 
six races to go, was 0.233sec faster than his rival, with the Ferrari of 
Sebastian Vettel in third place, four tenths of a second further behind.

Hamilton proved faster than Rosberg on hard tyres and repeated the trick later 
on when the pair switched to soft rubber. All the drivers had to contend with 
low grip levels because of the freshly track surface. The track temperature was 
also intense, reaching 56C at one point.

Earlier, in the first practice run, Rosberg was faster than Hamilton by almost 
half a second. Hamilton’s time was compromised by a lock-up as he went into 
turn nine.

Mercedes were again dominant, and they were followed by the Ferraris and then, 
feeling giddy in fifth, McLaren’s Fernando Alonso, who was followed by the Red 
Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen.

But the session’s most eye-catching moment came when Kevin Magnussen’s Renault 
caught fire. Magnussen had to jump out of his car as it burst into flames after 
he had completed his second installation lap.
