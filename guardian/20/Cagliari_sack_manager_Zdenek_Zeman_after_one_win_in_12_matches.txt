Zdenek Zeman has been sacked as the manager of Cagliari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cagliari> after a run of one win in their 
past 12 matches.

The club said on its website: “Cagliari Calcio announces that from now Zdenek 
Zeman leaves the technical guidance of the first team. The company would like 
to thank the coach and all his staff for the work done in recent months with 
great professionalism and dedication.”

Zeman was appointed in July and guided Cagliari to a 4-1 victory over 
Internazionale in September but a 3-1 defeat to Juventus last Thursday left 
them 18th in the league, three points adrift of safety inSerie A

Zeman, 67, has also coached Lazio, Roma, Fenerbahce and Red Star Belgrade 
during his 31-year managerial career.

Gianfranco Zola <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gianfranco-zola>, who 
played for Cagliari, is the early favourite to fill the vacant Stadio Sant’Elia 
position. Walter Zenga and Delio Rossi have also been mentioned.
