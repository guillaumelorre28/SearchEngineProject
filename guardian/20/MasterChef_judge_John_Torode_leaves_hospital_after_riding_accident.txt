The MasterChef <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/masterchef> judge 
John Torode has left hospital after a “lucky escape” in a riding accident.

A photo posted on Instagram of Torode, 51, in a hospital bed sparked concern 
for the Australian chef’s wellbeing. Lisa Faulkner, his partner, wrote that he 
was “very bruised” and thanked the staff of St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, 
west London.

Faulkner tagged the photo “#luckyescape” and “#blessed”, but the cause of the 
accident remained a mystery.

On Tuesday evening, after the photo prompted messages of support and concern, 
Faulkner tweeted <https://twitter.com/lisafaulkner1/status/813851416108404736> 
that Torode was “well and happy and sitting on the sofa and all is good”.

After the mystery accident had appeared on the splash of the Daily Star on 
Wednesday, Torode tweeted an explanation: he “took a tumble while out riding”.

He did not specify what he was riding. His agent had not responded to a 
request for comment at the time of publication.

The former Spooks actor Faulkner, 44, met Torode when she was the winner of 
Celebrity Masterchef in 2010. Before the accident the pair had posted photos 
from a Christmas stay at Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair.
