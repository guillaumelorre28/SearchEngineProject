Full time: Rangers 0-1 Celtic

Late heartbreak for Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> but 
they cannot complain too much. Celtic were utterly dominant and only the 
fingertips and toes of Matt Gilks kept the scoreline blank for so long. A 
classy Moussa Dembélé goal won the game and booked Celtic a return trip to 
Hampden Park to face Aberdeen in the League Cup final. That’s all from me, 
thanks for reading.

Celtic’s Moussa Dembélé leaves it late to defeat Rangers in Old Firm derby

90+1 min Four minutes to be added on. In the first of those Leigh Griffiths 
sprints though on goal chasing another long pass and should put the game to 
bed, but tries a scoop which the exceptional Matt Gilks reads.

GOAL! Rangers 0-1 Celtic (Dembélé, 88)

Finally Rangers’ resistance crumbles. An innocuous long ball isn’t dealt with 
and Leigh Griffiths spins into the box before crossing with the outside of his 
boot for the arriving Moussa Dembélé, who finishes brilliantly with a 
Cruyff-turn on the run at the near post.

86 min Yet another save from Matt Gilks who must have made 10 at least. This 
is one of Celtic’s better chances, James Forrest sprinting into the box on the 
overlap and collecting the ball in his stride before shooting towards the far 
corner, but the keeper gets his toe to it to keep it out.

84 min This game is being played at a breathless pace. Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> go forward through Joe Dodoo who 
tries to wriggle free of the Celtic defence before shooting low, but his strike 
hits a man in blue and deflects away from the target.

82 min A brilliantly measured tackle by Lee Wallace on Scott Sinclair in the 
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> box! Get it wrong and it 
is all but game over, but Wallace nudges the ball with his heel at just about 
the same moment as he cleans out the winger. It looked spot on despite Celtic’s 
protestations.

79 min Celtic’s shot count has ramped up to 18 now – Stuart Armstrong sees his 
effort go wide before James Forrest tries his luck from range with the same 
result. There has only been one team in this match for the most part, but all 
it takes is one chance and all that...

77 min Dembélé tries his luck with a curling effort which for once leaves 
Gilks stationary, but it loops wide. Barrie McKay, booked in the first half for 
a dive that wasn’t, is replaced by Joe Dodoo.

in the box. At the other end Griffiths is on the ball again and digs out a shot 
on target, but Gilks gets down to his right and holds it.

72 min Griffiths’ impact is immediate, flashing a cross along the six-yard box 
into the corridor of indecision where Clint Hill almost pokes the ball into his 
own net. To Brendan Rodgers’ frustration on the sideline, it runs just past the 
far post.

57 min Rogic lashes a shot from 25 yards which fizzes just past the post with 
Gilks beaten. A really well struck effort by one of the best players on the 
pitch.

53 min Chris Sutton is aghast. He can’t believe Craig Thomson has been 
“conned” by Clint Hill there. Sutton has probably let his impartiality hat slip 
a touch there but it did look suspiciously like a goal. Either way,Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have started pretty shakily in 
this second period and need to get themselves together.

Goal disallowed!

5o min Clint Hill goes down under a challenge by Erik Sviatchenko as the 
Danish defender hooks a header into the corner of the net from the penalty spot.
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> celebrate but Craig 
Thomson is quick to rule it out. Replays show it was a pretty soft foul, if one 
at all.

Kick-off!

Kenny Miller gets the second half going with a very modern pass straight back 
to his midfield with his first touch. No team-mate in sight near the 
centre-circle. I refuse to get used to it.

Half-time: Rangers 0-0 Celtic

Tom Rogic had the best chance of the half after Matt Gilks served him a 
ludicrous pass from his own goal-line, but the Celtic midfielder’s touch was 
almost as bad as Gilks’ and the keeper was able to shut him down.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have been on top but it’s all 
square at the break.

Late heartbreak for Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> but 
they cannot complain too much. Celtic were utterly dominant and only the 
fingertips and toes of Matt Gilks kept the scoreline blank for so long. A 
classy Moussa Dembélé goal won the game and booked Celtic a return trip to 
Hampden Park to face Aberdeen in the League Cup final. That’s all from me, 
thanks for reading.

90+4 min Dodoo can’t keep in a long diagonal pass and that might be that. 
 
90+3 min Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> come forwards 
but don’t have long if they are going to take this semi-final to extra time.
 
90+1 min Four minutes to be added on. In the first of those Leigh Griffiths 
sprints though on goal chasing another long pass and should put the game to 
bed, but tries a scoop which the exceptional Matt Gilks reads.
 
90 min Dembélé was booked, by the way, for charging into the crowd to 
celebrate. On BT Sport the decision has left Chris Sutton apoplectic.
 
Finally Rangers’ resistance crumbles. An innocuous long ball isn’t dealt with 
and Leigh Griffiths spins into the box before crossing with the outside of his 
boot for the arriving Moussa Dembélé, who finishes brilliantly with a 
Cruyff-turn on the run at the near post.

86 min Yet another save from Matt Gilks who must have made 10 at least. This 
is one of Celtic’s better chances, James Forrest sprinting into the box on the 
overlap and collecting the ball in his stride before shooting towards the far 
corner, but the keeper gets his toe to it to keep it out.
 
84 min This game is being played at a breathless pace. Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> go forward through Joe Dodoo who 
tries to wriggle free of the Celtic defence before shooting low, but his strike 
hits a man in blue and deflects away from the target.
 
82 min A brilliantly measured tackle by Lee Wallace on Scott Sinclair in the 
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> box! Get it wrong and it 
is all but game over, but Wallace nudges the ball with his heel at just about 
the same moment as he cleans out the winger. It looked spot on despite Celtic’s 
protestations.
 
79 min Celtic’s shot count has ramped up to 18 now – Stuart Armstrong sees his 
effort go wide before James Forrest tries his luck from range with the same 
result. There has only been one team in this match for the most part, but all 
it takes is one chance and all that...
 
77 min Dembélé tries his luck with a curling effort which for once leaves 
Gilks stationary, but it loops wide. Barrie McKay, booked in the first half for 
a dive that wasn’t, is replaced by Joe Dodoo.
 
76 min Half a chance for Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>
 on the break but Wallace’s cross is just too far away from the sub Joe Garner 
in the box. At the other end Griffiths is on the ball again and digs out a shot 
on target, but Gilks gets down to his right and holds it.
 
74 min Joe Dodoo is warming up and it looks like the 21-year-old striker will 
be the next into the fray forRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>.
 
72 min Griffiths’ impact is immediate, flashing a cross along the six-yard box 
into the corridor of indecision where Clint Hill almost pokes the ball into his 
own net. To Brendan Rodgers’ frustration on the sideline, it runs just past the 
far post.
 
70 min Kenny Miller doesn’t look to happy as he is replaced by Martyn Waghorn. 
Josh Windass leaves the field too, with Joe Garner taking his spot.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> make a switch too, with the 
impressive Tom Rogic making way for Leigh Griffiths. Griffiths called on 
Rodgers to play him alongside Dembélé from the start this week, but he will 
have to make do with the last 20 minutes.
 
67 min Halliday brings down Brown in a threatening position 25 yards out. 
Scott Sinclair steps up forCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
and sweeps an arcing free-kick towards the top corner but Matt Gilks stretches 
and pushes the ball on to the bar with his finger tips before snaffling the 
rebound. A brilliant save.
 
65 min Windass bursts through midfield and tries to find Miller breaking 
beyond the defenders, but passes too close to a Celtic shirt.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> need to take advantage of those 
moments.
 
63 min Brendan Rodgers makes the first change of the match: Stuart Armstrong 
replaces Nir Bitton.
 
61 min Excellent buildup by Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> with Rogic again at its heart. He 
chips forward for Dembélé who controls the ball on his chest in the box before 
spinning and volleying a shot towards the corner, but Gilks gets across to make 
another important stop.
 
59 min Huge chance for Rangers! They break down the right and Tavernier cuts a 
low cross to the penalty spot where Holt is arriving. He fires a powerful 
first-time shot on target but Simunovic does excellently to make the block.
 
57 min Rogic lashes a shot from 25 yards which fizzes just past the post with 
Gilks beaten. A really well struck effort by one of the best players on the 
pitch.
 
55 min How Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> could do 
with the injured Kranjcar to get his foot on the ball in midfield and gain some 
control. Things are a little frantic and that is playing into the Celtic’s 
hands.
 
53 min Chris Sutton is aghast. He can’t believe Craig Thomson has been 
“conned” by Clint Hill there. Sutton has probably let his impartiality hat slip 
a touch there but it did look suspiciously like a goal. Either way,Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have started pretty shakily in 
this second period and need to get themselves together.
 
5o min Clint Hill goes down under a challenge by Erik Sviatchenko as the 
Danish defender hooks a header into the corner of the net from the penalty spot.
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> celebrate but Craig 
Thomson is quick to rule it out. Replays show it was a pretty soft foul, if one 
at all.
 Sviatchenko scores the goal which is later disallowed. Photograph: Lee 
Smith/Reuters  
49 min Forrest has another sighter after Rogic had poked a pass into the 
forward, but Kiernan slides to block the chance. Corner.
 
47 min Scott Brown is throwing his weight around at the beginning of this 
half. His work helpsCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> move 
the ball to James Forrest who clatters a left-foot shot from the edge of the 
box just over Matt Gilks’ bar.
 
Kenny Miller gets the second half going with a very modern pass straight back 
to his midfield with his first touch. No team-mate in sight near the 
centre-circle. I refuse to get used to it.
 
Or for something more on-point, here’s one from the archives...
