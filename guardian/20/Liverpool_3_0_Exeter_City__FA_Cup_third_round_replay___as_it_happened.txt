So Liverpool advance to the fourth round, where they’ll meet West Ham United 
at Anfield.A chance for the Hammers to avenge their defeat in the 2006 final, 
and an opportunity forLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>
 to avenge the double West Ham have done over them this season. Liverpool’s 
young team were impressive on the whole tonight, against an Exeter team who 
should be given massive credit for their defensive organisation and solidity, 
but most of all their moxie. The Premier League side scored three fine goals, 
but once again Christian Benteke’s form is a cause for concern: Klopp’s 
aforementioned unspoken plan to kick-start his Anfield career needs a little 
more work. On the flip side, the Scouse Cafu is back. So it’s swings and 
roundabouts. Meanwhile hopefully Exeter will gain confidence from two 
impressive showings against Premier League opposition, and enjoy a burst up the 
League Two table. Nighty night.

FULL TIME: Liverpool 3-0 Exeter City

The free kick’s whipped into the Liverpool box. Ilori heads clear. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> break, four on one. Chirivella 
sends Benteke free down the inside left, and you don’t need me to tell you what 
happens next. Not for the first time this season, he panics when one on one 
with the keeper. A heavy touch as he tries to round him, and the chance is 
gone. That pretty much sums up his performance tonight, which was 89 minutes of 
nonsense admittedly embellished by a fine assist.

90 min +1: Holmes slips a pass down the left for Nichols, who crosses deep. 
Davies takes a snapshot from the right-hand edge of the box, but Enrique 
blocks. From a throw on the right, Smith bundles Wheeler over near the corner 
flag. A chance for a memorable consolation.

20 yards, his curler towards the top right clawed away by Olejnik. Then 
Teixeira has a go from wide left, but it’s deflected, taking all the sting from 
the shot.

87 min: Fine play by Benteke, who slides a pass wide right to release Ojo into 
acres. But he metaphorically yawns and scratches his arse, and doesn’t bother 
heading into the box in anticipation for the cross. He must be very frustrating 
to play with.

85 min: A brilliant sliderule pass down the Exeter right by Holmes finds 
Wheeler in space. His low ball nearly finds Nichols in the centre, but Ilori 
has read the danger well, and steps in to clear. That was nearly a very pretty 
consolation goal for Exeter, as smooth a move as we’ve seen all night.

84 min: Stewart releases Benteke into the Exeter area down the right. It’s a 
fine ball, some redemption for a young man who will have better nights, but 
Benteke has mistimed his run. Offside.

GOAL! Liverpool 3-0 Exeter City (Teixeira 82)

Nichols goes on a run down the Exeter right, and fires a dangerous low ball 
into theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area. It 
somehow threads its way along a route that circumvents all the men Exeter have 
thrown forward, allowing Ilori to clear. Benteke romps down the middle of the 
park, drawing four players to the right. He then curls a pass left to Teixeira 
in the left-hand side of the box. Teixeira opens his body and slams a shot past 
Olejnik. A fine finish, and that is so much better from Benteke. Much, if not 
all, is forgiven.

80 min: Chirivella comes on for Ibe. His first contribution is an attempted 
sidefooter from the edge of the box. It’s heading towards the bottom right. 
Benteke - who is also having a stinker but has less excuse than Stewart - gets 
in the way.

78 min: Stewart has been poor tonight. Everyone’s allowed a stinker. He plays 
yet another loose ball in the midfield, allowing Holmes to make good down the 
middle of the park. Fortunately for Stewart, Holmes loses control and a 
potentially dangerous move breaks down.

76 min: Exeter look visibly deflated, falling two behind after playing so well 
defensively for so long. Ojo has another sniff around the right-hand portion of 
the Exeter box, but can’t work position to shoot this time round. He lays off 
for Teixeira, who thinks about a shot from 25 yards, but opts to flick the ball 
wide for Brannagan. The move peters out.

GOAL! Liverpool 2-0 Exeter City (Ojo 74)

So having said all that - and this report should probably get an official 
assist -Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> finally get 
their second. And what a goal this is! Ojo picks up possession and eases into 
the Exeter area on the right. Woodman shuffles back, and back again. Bad 
decision: he’s given Ojo time and space to open his body up and flick-curl a 
delicious shot into the top left. That one was planted into the corner from the 
time it left his boot. A marvellous strike.

73 min: The tension around Anfield is palpable. Exeter’s fans are enjoying 
themselves, but everyone else in the stadium must be contemplating the very 
real possibility of an Exeter goal. For all Liverpool’s territorial domination, 
they’ve only got one goal to show for it. And you know how these things often 
pan out.

71 min: Ibe dribbles in from the left. He cuts the ball back to Teixeira on 
the left-hand edge of the D. He shoots, but Brown spreads himself to block 
marvellously. The ball breaks to Ojo on the right of the box. He drops a 
shoulder to come inside, and sends a weak dribbler towards the bottom right. 
Olejnik gathers.

69 min: A poor Stewart pass in the middle of the park sends Davies and Nichols 
off on the rampage down the right. Stewart tries to repair the damage himself, 
but only succeeds in clattering Holmes. A free kick out on the right. It’s 
thrown into a packed box, but once again Benteke batters a header clear. 
Perhaps they should convert him into a defender, the old Kenny Burns 
switcheroo. Steven Caulker gets a go up front every now and then, after all.

67 min: More of the sterile Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> domination. A lot of passing 
in the middle of the park. Smith tries to get things going with a burst down 
the left, but his cutback from the byline isn’t anywhere near Benteke or 
Brannagan, lurking in the six-yard box.

65 min: It’s a good end-to-end affair, this. Ibe cuts in from the right, 
exchanges passes with Brannagan, and tries to curl a low one into the bottom 
left. Not quite. Nichols launces another sortie down the Exeter right, and very 
nearly gets past Ilori. Again, not quite. Meanwhile the goalscorer Allen is 
replaced by Ojo.

64 min: Wheeler comes on for Oakley. This is Exeter’s “finishing XI” now, all 
right.

62 min: Another Exeter attack, Hoskins crossing from the left, Holmes guiding 
a weak header from the penalty spot straight at Mignolet. A fine chance there.
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> want to watch 
themselves here. They break upfield through Smith down the left. His low cross 
should be met by Benteke on the edge of the area, but Benteke inexplicably 
dummies. There’s nobody in red near him! This is an absurd performance from a 
player who cost over £30m.

60 min: To be fair to Benteke, he’s just made a major contribution here. 
Nichols wins a corner off Smith’s chest as he tries to flick the ball into the 
Liverpool box from the right. The corner’s sent into a packed mixer, and you 
know howLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> minds whirl 
in the middle of that. Benteke crashes a header clear, and the danger is over.

59 min: Brannagan flicks a ball down the centre to release Benteke on goal. 
The striker hesitates, allowing Brown to brush him off the ball and Olejnik to 
come out and smother. He’s a confidence vacuum.

58 min: Exeter can’t get hold of the ball at all. Some nice metronomic 
passing. But Klopp will be wishing for some crashing, driving heavy beats.
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are going nowhere. 
“I’ve always been fond of Joe Allen,” begins Matt Dony. “He’s a tidy player, 
keeps things ticking over nicely, and grew up a couple of towns over from me. 
But then I watch Xabi Alonso play. Even now, at 34, all those years after he 
left, watching him leaves me with a dull ache deep inside. Sigh.”

56 min: Brown clatters into the back of Benteke, just outside the Exeter area 
on the left. A free kick, which Benteke is ostentatiously waved away from. 
Brannagan chips the set piece into the box in the direction of the big striker, 
but it’s easily headed clear by Moore-Taylor. “Samson was most definitely 
Torres,” suggests James Cox. “He was rubbish after he had a haircut.”

54 min: From a corner on the right, Ibe cuts into the box and unleashes a 
screamer towards the top right. The ball bounds off the underside of the bar, 
99% of the ball over the line. But that’s not enough, a brilliant decision to 
wave play on. Neither Benteke nor Allen can convert the bouncing rebound, and 
Exeter clear. That’s a brilliant effort, and so unlucky. You can’t get closer 
to scoring than that.

52 min: Ibe skitters at pace into the Exeter area down the right, but absurdly 
runs the ball out of play at full pace. He was in some sort of zone there. But
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are beginning to 
press Exeter back.

50 min: Benteke nearly gets on the end fo Randall’s deep cross from the right, 
but it’s just a corner. Pinball in the Exeter area, Allan, Stewart and 
Brannagan all with the ball at their feet, but all unable to dig it out for a 
shot. Eventually Ibe gets involved, loitering by the right-hand post. He’s 
offside.

48 min: Randall goes on a power burst down the right. He breaks into the area 
and is brushed by Woodman. If Randall opted to go down, he’d have given the 
referee a decision there, as he was seriously knocked off balance. But he stays 
honest. He can’t keep the move going, though, despite stopping the ball from 
going out of play.

46 min: New Finishing Exeter are immediately on the front foot. Nichols makes 
a nuisance of himself on the edge of the box, forcing Stewart into a poor 
clearing header and allowing the substitute’s near-namesake Nicholls to cut in 
from the right and lash a wild shot high and left of goal. But that’s much 
better already from the visitors, who didn’t warm Mignolet’s hands in the first 
half.

And we're off again!

Two changes for Exeter: Butterfield and Morrison off, Hoskins and leading 
scorer Nichols on.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
get the ball rolling again, and will attack the Kop in the second half, their 
favoured state of affairs. “Have you considered that Joe Allen might be a 
latter day Samson?” asks Siobhan. “He’s a new man since he grew the hair and 
the beard.”

HALF TIME: Liverpool 1-0 Exeter City

Not much of a lead for all that dominance. Will Paul Tisdale’s “finishing XI” 
make the Premier League side pay? It could be a nervous second half for the 
hosts if they don’t up their game.

45 min: Benteke dribbles towards the Exeter box at pace, down the inside-left 
channel. He tries to carefully curl a low shot towards the bottom right, but 
it’s too ponderous and easily blocked by Moore-Taylor.

44 min: Liverpool continue to pass it around quite a lot, but they’re going 
nowhere. In that sense, this is just like watching the first team go about 
their business. No cutting edge. Exeter are holding their shape very well 
indeed.

42 min: Not much going on right now, apart from the continued fretting of 
Dundee United’s Simon McMahon (12 mins), who just won’t let it go. “Just dug 
out the programme from the European Cup semi-final 1st leg at Tannadice. Dundee 
United 2 Roma 0. 11th April 1984. There’s a prophetic piece inside by Mel 
Henderson, Public Relations Officer at Ipswich Town, who had played the 
Italians the previous season, entitled ‘What Awaits United in Rome’. On a 
lighter note, there’s also an advert for Paul Sturrock’s Video Library and 
Showroom ‘with approx. 700 titles in both Beta and VHS formats’.”

40 min: The corner is easily cleared, but Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are quickly coming back at 
Exeter, Ibe sending a screamer goalward from the right-hand edge of the D. It’s 
deflected for another corner, which leads to another Ibe shot. The young winger 
cuts in from the right, drops a shoulder, and sends a rising diagonal pearler 
inches wide and high of the top-left corner. A couple of very decent efforts 
there.

38 min: Ibe makes good down the right, reaches the byline, and pulls back for

So Liverpool advance to the fourth round, where they’ll meet West Ham United 
at Anfield.A chance for the Hammers to avenge their defeat in the 2006 final, 
and an opportunity forLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>
 to avenge the double West Ham have done over them this season. Liverpool’s 
young team were impressive on the whole tonight, against an Exeter team who 
should be given massive credit for their defensive organisation and solidity, 
but most of all their moxie. The Premier League side scored three fine goals, 
but once again Christian Benteke’s form is a cause for concern: Klopp’s 
aforementioned unspoken plan to kick-start his Anfield career needs a little 
more work. On the flip side, the Scouse Cafu is back. So it’s swings and 
roundabouts. Meanwhile hopefully Exeter will gain confidence from two 
impressive showings against Premier League opposition, and enjoy a burst up the 
League Two table. Nighty night.

final whistle. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  
The free kick’s whipped into the Liverpool box. Ilori heads clear. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> break, four on one. Chirivella 
sends Benteke free down the inside left, and you don’t need me to tell you what 
happens next. Not for the first time this season, he panics when one on one 
with the keeper. A heavy touch as he tries to round him, and the chance is 
gone. That pretty much sums up his performance tonight, which was 89 minutes of 
nonsense admittedly embellished by a fine assist.
 
90 min +1: Holmes slips a pass down the left for Nichols, who crosses deep. 
Davies takes a snapshot from the right-hand edge of the box, but Enrique 
blocks. From a throw on the right, Smith bundles Wheeler over near the corner 
flag. A chance for a memorable consolation.
 
90 min: There will be two added minutes.
 
89 min: It’s shooting practice for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> now. Benteke has a look from 
20 yards, his curler towards the top right clawed away by Olejnik. Then 
Teixeira has a go from wide left, but it’s deflected, taking all the sting from 
the shot.
 
87 min: Fine play by Benteke, who slides a pass wide right to release Ojo into 
acres. But he metaphorically yawns and scratches his arse, and doesn’t bother 
heading into the box in anticipation for the cross. He must be very frustrating 
to play with.
 
85 min: A brilliant sliderule pass down the Exeter right by Holmes finds 
Wheeler in space. His low ball nearly finds Nichols in the centre, but Ilori 
has read the danger well, and steps in to clear. That was nearly a very pretty 
consolation goal for Exeter, as smooth a move as we’ve seen all night.
 
84 min: Stewart releases Benteke into the Exeter area down the right. It’s a 
fine ball, some redemption for a young man who will have better nights, but 
Benteke has mistimed his run. Offside.
 
Nichols goes on a run down the Exeter right, and fires a dangerous low ball 
into theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area. It 
somehow threads its way along a route that circumvents all the men Exeter have 
thrown forward, allowing Ilori to clear. Benteke romps down the middle of the 
park, drawing four players to the right. He then curls a pass left to Teixeira 
in the left-hand side of the box. Teixeira opens his body and slams a shot past 
Olejnik. A fine finish, and that is so much better from Benteke. Much, if not 
all, is forgiven.

Noble/Reuters  Celebrates the goal ... Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  Then 
thanks Christian Benteke for his assist. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  
80 min: Chirivella comes on for Ibe. His first contribution is an attempted 
sidefooter from the edge of the box. It’s heading towards the bottom right. 
Benteke - who is also having a stinker but has less excuse than Stewart - gets 
in the way.
 
78 min: Stewart has been poor tonight. Everyone’s allowed a stinker. He plays 
yet another loose ball in the midfield, allowing Holmes to make good down the 
middle of the park. Fortunately for Stewart, Holmes loses control and a 
potentially dangerous move breaks down.
 
76 min: Exeter look visibly deflated, falling two behind after playing so well 
defensively for so long. Ojo has another sniff around the right-hand portion of 
the Exeter box, but can’t work position to shoot this time round. He lays off 
for Teixeira, who thinks about a shot from 25 yards, but opts to flick the ball 
wide for Brannagan. The move peters out.
 
So having said all that - and this report should probably get an official 
assist -Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> finally get 
their second. And what a goal this is! Ojo picks up possession and eases into 
the Exeter area on the right. Woodman shuffles back, and back again. Bad 
decision: he’s given Ojo time and space to open his body up and flick-curl a 
delicious shot into the top left. That one was planted into the corner from the 
time it left his boot. A marvellous strike.

Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images  Then celebrates. Photograph: John 
Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images  
73 min: The tension around Anfield is palpable. Exeter’s fans are enjoying 
themselves, but everyone else in the stadium must be contemplating the very 
real possibility of an Exeter goal. For all Liverpool’s territorial domination, 
they’ve only got one goal to show for it. And you know how these things often 
pan out.
 
71 min: Ibe dribbles in from the left. He cuts the ball back to Teixeira on 
the left-hand edge of the D. He shoots, but Brown spreads himself to block 
marvellously. The ball breaks to Ojo on the right of the box. He drops a 
shoulder to come inside, and sends a weak dribbler towards the bottom right. 
Olejnik gathers.
 
69 min: A poor Stewart pass in the middle of the park sends Davies and Nichols 
off on the rampage down the right. Stewart tries to repair the damage himself, 
but only succeeds in clattering Holmes. A free kick out on the right. It’s 
thrown into a packed box, but once again Benteke batters a header clear. 
Perhaps they should convert him into a defender, the old Kenny Burns 
switcheroo. Steven Caulker gets a go up front every now and then, after all.
 
67 min: More of the sterile Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> domination. A lot of passing 
in the middle of the park. Smith tries to get things going with a burst down 
the left, but his cutback from the byline isn’t anywhere near Benteke or 
Brannagan, lurking in the six-yard box.
  Liverpool’s Tiago Ilori, right. and Exeter’s Tom Nichols go a-high-kicking. 
Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA  
65 min: It’s a good end-to-end affair, this. Ibe cuts in from the right, 
exchanges passes with Brannagan, and tries to curl a low one into the bottom 
left. Not quite. Nichols launces another sortie down the Exeter right, and very 
nearly gets past Ilori. Again, not quite. Meanwhile the goalscorer Allen is 
replaced by Ojo.
 
64 min: Wheeler comes on for Oakley. This is Exeter’s “finishing XI” now, all 
right.
 
62 min: Another Exeter attack, Hoskins crossing from the left, Holmes guiding 
a weak header from the penalty spot straight at Mignolet. A fine chance there.
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> want to watch 
themselves here. They break upfield through Smith down the left. His low cross 
should be met by Benteke on the edge of the area, but Benteke inexplicably 
dummies. There’s nobody in red near him! This is an absurd performance from a 
player who cost over £30m.
 
60 min: To be fair to Benteke, he’s just made a major contribution here. 
Nichols wins a corner off Smith’s chest as he tries to flick the ball into the 
Liverpool box from the right. The corner’s sent into a packed mixer, and you 
know howLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> minds whirl 
in the middle of that. Benteke crashes a header clear, and the danger is over.
 
59 min: Brannagan flicks a ball down the centre to release Benteke on goal. 
The striker hesitates, allowing Brown to brush him off the ball and Olejnik to 
come out and smother. He’s a confidence vacuum.
 
58 min: Exeter can’t get hold of the ball at all. Some nice metronomic 
passing. But Klopp will be wishing for some crashing, driving heavy beats.
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are going nowhere. 
“I’ve always been fond of Joe Allen,” begins Matt Dony. “He’s a tidy player, 
keeps things ticking over nicely, and grew up a couple of towns over from me. 
But then I watch Xabi Alonso play. Even now, at 34, all those years after he 
left, watching him leaves me with a dull ache deep inside. Sigh.”
  Exeter City striker Tom Nichols poses a nuisance for Liverpool’s Jose Enrique. 
Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images  
56 min: Brown clatters into the back of Benteke, just outside the Exeter area 
on the left. A free kick, which Benteke is ostentatiously waved away from. 
Brannagan chips the set piece into the box in the direction of the big striker, 
but it’s easily headed clear by Moore-Taylor. “Samson was most definitely 
Torres,” suggests James Cox. “He was rubbish after he had a haircut.”
 
54 min: From a corner on the right, Ibe cuts into the box and unleashes a 
screamer towards the top right. The ball bounds off the underside of the bar, 
99% of the ball over the line. But that’s not enough, a brilliant decision to 
wave play on. Neither Benteke nor Allen can convert the bouncing rebound, and 
Exeter clear. That’s a brilliant effort, and so unlucky. You can’t get closer 
to scoring than that.
 
52 min: Ibe skitters at pace into the Exeter area down the right, but absurdly 
runs the ball out of play at full pace. He was in some sort of zone there. But
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are beginning to 
press Exeter back.
 
51 min: The biggest cheer of the evening, the goal included, as Randall is 
replaced by Flanagan, back after that long, long injury lay-off.
 
50 min: Benteke nearly gets on the end fo Randall’s deep cross from the right, 
but it’s just a corner. Pinball in the Exeter area, Allan, Stewart and 
Brannagan all with the ball at their feet, but all unable to dig it out for a 
shot. Eventually Ibe gets involved, loitering by the right-hand post. He’s 
offside.
 
48 min: Randall goes on a power burst down the right. He breaks into the area 
and is brushed by Woodman. If Randall opted to go down, he’d have given the 
referee a decision there, as he was seriously knocked off balance. But he stays 
honest. He can’t keep the move going, though, despite stopping the ball from 
going out of play.
 
46 min: New Finishing Exeter are immediately on the front foot. Nichols makes 
a nuisance of himself on the edge of the box, forcing Stewart into a poor 
clearing header and allowing the substitute’s near-namesake Nicholls to cut in 
from the right and lash a wild shot high and left of goal. But that’s much 
better already from the visitors, who didn’t warm Mignolet’s hands in the first 
half.
 
Two changes for Exeter: Butterfield and Morrison off, Hoskins and leading 
scorer Nichols on.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
get the ball rolling again, and will attack the Kop in the second half, their 
favoured state of affairs. “Have you considered that Joe Allen might be a 
latter day Samson?” asks Siobhan. “He’s a new man since he grew the hair and 
the beard.”
 
Half-time entertainment: The second half between Leicester and Spurs should be 
kicking off soon. How about that? Like a pint of plain, Bryan Graham’s your 
only man.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jan/20/tottenham-hotspur-v-leicester-city-fa-cup-third-round-replay-live> 
Not much of a lead for all that dominance. Will Paul Tisdale’s “finishing XI” 
make the Premier League side pay? It could be a nervous second half for the 
hosts if they don’t up their game.
 
45 min: Benteke dribbles towards the Exeter box at pace, down the inside-left 
channel. He tries to carefully curl a low shot towards the bottom right, but 
it’s too ponderous and easily blocked by Moore-Taylor.
 
44 min: Liverpool continue to pass it around quite a lot, but they’re going 
nowhere. In that sense, this is just like watching the first team go about 
their business. No cutting edge. Exeter are holding their shape very well 
indeed.
 
42 min: Not much going on right now, apart from the continued fretting of 
Dundee United’s Simon McMahon (12 mins), who just won’t let it go. “Just dug 
out the programme from the European Cup semi-final 1st leg at Tannadice. Dundee 
United 2 Roma 0. 11th April 1984. There’s a prophetic piece inside by Mel 
Henderson, Public Relations Officer at Ipswich Town, who had played the 
Italians the previous season, entitled ‘What Awaits United in Rome’. On a 
lighter note, there’s also an advert for Paul Sturrock’s Video Library and 
Showroom ‘with approx. 700 titles in both Beta and VHS formats’.”
 
40 min: The corner is easily cleared, but Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are quickly coming back at 
Exeter, Ibe sending a screamer goalward from the right-hand edge of the D. It’s 
deflected for another corner, which leads to another Ibe shot. The young winger 
cuts in from the right, drops a shoulder, and sends a rising diagonal pearler 
inches wide and high of the top-left corner. A couple of very decent efforts 
there.

blocked by Butterfield, for a corner on the right. Before that’s taken, here’s
