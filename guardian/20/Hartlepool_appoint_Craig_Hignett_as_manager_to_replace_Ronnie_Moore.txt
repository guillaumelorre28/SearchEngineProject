.

The League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> 
strugglers parted company with Moore on Wednesday and moved quickly to replace 
the 63-year-old with a former Pools midfielder.

Hignett, who also had playing spells with Middlesbrough, Blackburn, Bradford, 
Crewe and Barnsley among others, finished his playing career with a brief stint 
at Victoria Park in 2007.

The 46-year-old also spent time as assistant to Colin Cooper at Hartlepool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hartlepool> in the 2013-14 season. “It 
was essential that we moved quickly to get a new manager in place,” the 
chairman, Gary Coxall, told the club’s official website. “We immediately 
identified Craig as our No1 target and we believe he has all the right 
qualities to help instil confidence back into the players and help us move up 
the table.

“He has a wealth of experience in football and has been looking for an 
opportunity to move in to management so we’re delighted to give him that chance 
here at Victoria Park.”

Moore left Hartlepool in the wake of Tuesday night’s 2-1 home defeat to 
Stevenage which left them just one place and four points above the relegation 
zone.

Coxall said of Moore’s exit: “This is an extremely difficult decision, but one 
we feel is right for the football club. Ronnie has worked tirelessly to bring 
success to the club during his time at The Vic and we thank him sincerely for 
those efforts and wish him well for the future.”
