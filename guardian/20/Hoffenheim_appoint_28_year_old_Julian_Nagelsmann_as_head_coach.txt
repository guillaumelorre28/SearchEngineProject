 after less than four months in the role because of heart problems – and the 
club have decided that Nagelsmann, who was working as the Under-19s coach, will 
step up to the senior role early on a three-year contract.

Hoffenheim’s managing director, Dr Peter Görlich, told the club’s official 
website: “We have a duty of care to the club and of course the people involved. 
Together with Julian, we again carefully weighed up all the risks we considered 
in the autumn and have now decided the best way is for him to start earlier. He 
is keen and he can also give the team fresh impetus.”

Nagelsmann, who the club expect will pass his senior coaching examinations 
soon, said: “It’s a big challenge of course, made harder by the current points 
situation. But I am looking forward to working with the team.”

Nagelsmann played at youth level for 1860 Munich and Augsburg before his 
career was ended by persistent knee problems. Nagelsmann then moved into 
coaching with Augsburg, where he worked under Thomas Tuchel, the current 
Borussia Dortmund coach.
