I have never really thought of myself as the sort of cook who makes his own 
bits and pieces to serve with drinks. Too much fiddle and faff if you ask me. 
But then when I do, I realise I should have done so all along. Not just because 
what I’ve made often tastes better than anything I can buy, but because the 
effort is much more appreciated. Thoughtful drinks and homemade bits like the 
gin lemonade and bacon popcorn below aren’t a great deal of trouble and say 
MerryChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> far more 
effectively than arranging something you’ve just picked up from the shops on a 
plate.

With these drinks may I wish you all a happy and peaceful Christmas. See you 
in a couple of weeks.

Gin lemonade

Bright as the star in the east, a fresh, citrus-scented gin cocktail.

Makes enough for 4-6 small glasses
unwaxed lemons 2
caster sugar 5 tbsp
still mineral water 500ml
juniper berries 8
ice cubes 
gin (50ml to 250ml of lemonade)

Cut the lemons into large pieces, pips and all peel, and place in a blender 
jug then add the sugar and water. Process to a thick creamy-yellow liquor, then 
tip into a jug. Crack the juniper berries lightly using a heavy weight or 
pestle and mortar. Add to the lemon syrup then refrigerate.

Put ice into the glasses. Pour over the gin and top up with lemonade, and 
garnish with a slice of lemon.

Fennel seed and pancetta popcorn

Bacon fat works brilliantly with the fennel, lending a scent of porcetta.

For 8-10
bacon or pancetta 150g, sliced thinly
butter 125g
fennel seeds 2 tbsp
popping corn 125g

These bits say Merry Christmas better than anything from the shops

Lay the bacon or pancetta on a baking sheet and cook under a hot grill until 
crisp. Turn and cook the other side. You are after truly crisp flesh. Lift the 
rashers from the tray and place on kitchen paper. Reserve the fat in the tray, 
tipping it into a deep saucepan.

Melt 95g of the butter in a small pan. While it melts, bash the fennel seed 
using a pestle and mortar, to release its fragrance, not to crush to a powder, 
then add to the butter and stir, letting it warm gently. Turn off the heat.

Melt the remaining butter in the bacon fat over a moderate heat, then add the 
popping corn. Cover tightly with a lid, shaking the pan occasionally, until the 
kernels have popped. This will take anything between 3 and 5 minutes, depending 
on the heat and thickness of your pan.

Crumble the bacon or pancetta into tiny pieces, add to the fennel-seed butter 
with a little sea salt then fold into the popcorn and serve.

Pomegranate and prosecco

 Savoury and sweet: pomegranate and prosecco, with green olive pastries. 
Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer 
Deep ruby red, nicely balanced between sweet and sour, this is a perfect drink 
for Christmas morning.


Serves about 6
clementines 2
cardamom pods 6
pomegranate juice 350ml to taste
prosecco 1 bottle
ice

Balanced between sweet and sour, a prosecco cocktail is ideal for Christmas 
morning

Peel the clementines, and break into segments. Remove the skin and pith with 
your fingers, then lay the segments on a tray and place in the freezer for a 
couple of hours.

Crack the cardamom pods open with a heavy weight, such as a mortar, but don’t 
grind them to a powder.

Divide the pomegranate juice between glasses, add two segments of frozen 
clementines to each glass, then a cardamom pod. Top up with prosecco and serve 
with ice.

Green olive pastries

About the size of Danish pastries, these are best warm from the oven.


Makes about 12
green olives 200g (stoned weight 150g)
garlic 2 cloves
basil 10g
parsley leaves 5g
olive oil 120ml
parmesan 60g, grated
puff pastry 500g, ready made
egg a little beaten to glaze

If the olives have stones, remove them. Then put the olive flesh into the bowl 
of a food processor. Peel the garlic and add the cloves to the olives. Put the 
basil, leaves and stalks and the parsley leaves into the bowl of the food 
processor, then process, pouring in the olive oil as you go until you have a 
loose green paste. Stir in most of the grated parmesan, leaving a little to 
scatter over the finished pastries.

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

On a floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle of about 44 x 
30cm. Spread the olive paste over the surface of the pastry leaving a 2cm rim 
of bare pastry on all sides. Brush the rim with egg wash.

With the narrow edge towards you, roll the pastry up into a long thick 
sausage, pressing the edges tightly together to seal. Wrap the roll lightly in 
kitchen paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. It will firm up a little, making 
it easier to slice.

Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Cut the roll into finger- thick 
slices, placing them flat on the parchment. You will have about 12. Scatter a 
little of the remaining parmesan over the surface of each and bake for 12-15 
minutes or until crisp, golden and puffed.

Using a palette knife, remove the cooked pastries from the baking tray and 
serve warm.
