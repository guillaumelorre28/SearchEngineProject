"Don't you ever get tired of Hamlet?" a dramatist asked me last week. 
Absolutely not. The leading role is infinitely variable:as Oscar Wilde said 
<http://www.project-hamlet.info/reception/wilde.html>, "There are as many 
Hamlets as there are melancholies." And the play takes on a different colouring 
depending on time and place. It becomes politically subversive in countries 
either experiencing, or emerging from, an oppressive dictatorship.

With such a profusion of Hamlets (or should it be "a hesitation of Hamlets"?) 
to choose from, I've selected a key performance from each decade of my 
theatregoing life. FirstMichael Redgrave (1958) 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/hamlet/past_productions/rsc_stage_1958.shtml>, who was an 
unforgettably tormented intellectual. ThenDavid Warner (1964) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/06/theatre.rsc>, attenuated, 
insecure and heavily scarved; Derek Jacobi (1977), whom I saw play the role on 
a sodden night at Denmark's Kronborg Castle; the immaculately spoken Michael 
Pennington andJonathan Pryce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/22/10-best-hamlets-david-tennant>
, articulating his father's ghost (both 1980); a fiery and energeticKenneth 
Branagh (1992) <http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/hamlet/8529.shtml>; and David 
Tennant (2008) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jul/31/theatre.shakespeare>, who 
invested the role with his own whimsical humour. Most recently, there wasRory 
Kinnear (2010) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/oct/08/hamlet-review-rory-kinnear>, 
the observed of all observers in an eavesdropping tyranny.

I'm aware that leaves out a slew of fine Hamlets, including Nicol Williamson, 
Ben Kingsley,Albert Finney <http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/8829>, Mark Rylance,
Simon Russell Beale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/30/artsfeatures2> and Ben Whishaw 
<http://vimeo.com/16882678>. Of the two women I've seen play the role, the 
German actor Angela Winkler memorably highlighted Hamlet's tenderness. And, 
among several Hamlets on film, my favourite remainsGregory Kozintsev's 1971 
version 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/16/kozintsev-hamlet-king-lear-review>
, which reminded us that Hamlet is only one figure in a bustling, hyperactive 
court.

But if I had to pick the performance that has stayed with me through the years 
it would be that of Redgrave, who gave us every facet of the character: 
hysteria, danger, meditativeness and, towards the end, a beautifully stoical 
acceptance of death.
