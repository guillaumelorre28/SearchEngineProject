A lacklustre Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> 
needed a long-range goal from Spaniard Xabi Alonso to secure a 1-0 victory over 
Darmstadt 98 on Tuesday that put them into the quarter-finals of the German Cup.

The Bavarians, top of the Bundesliga and through to the knockout stage of the 
Champions League, looked tired following a congested run of fixtures and lacked 
the finishing touch despite being in control throughout the game.

Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller had numerous chances but neither could 
find the net, while Alonso eventually made the breakthrough with a powerful 
30-metre strike five minutes before the break.

Bayern again had the visitors on the backfoot in a pedestrian second half but 
could not add to their lead despite several good chances.

“We tried to score again but we couldn’t,” said the Bayern captain, Philipp 
Lahm. “We did not allow anything at the back but we could still have played a 
bit better in the last third of the pitch.“

Werder Bremen, struggling in the Bundesliga, came from a goal down to beat 
Borussia Mönchengladbach 4-3 with the Peruvian veteran Claudio Pizarro scoring 
one goal and setting up another. Fellow Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen also 
staged a comeback to beat fourth division Unterhaching 3-1.
