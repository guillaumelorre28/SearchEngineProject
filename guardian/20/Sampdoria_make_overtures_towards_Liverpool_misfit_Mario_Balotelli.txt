Balotelli’s agent, Mino Raiola, has been trying to find a suitable destination 
for his 25-year-old client, who is surplus to requirements for Jürgen Klopp at 
Anfield, and despite links with China and Turkey a return to his home country 
could be the most likely get-out.

“Balotelli is Balotelli’s own worst enemy,” Ferrero told Il Corriere dello 
Sport. “Just like [the controversial Samp striker Antonio] Cassano is Cassano’s 
own worst enemy.

“He’s a great player who’s stuck back in the 1960s, stuck in the days of 
Sapore di Sale <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76Abv8-Mbc>[a classic Italian 
song about relaxing on the beach]. He could relaunch [his career] at a 
passionate club like ours, but I think he’s still got mixed feelings. I’ve 
tried to tell him to come to Samp because he’s a great talent.”
