Three substitutes played a major role as Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> came from behind 
against Werder Bremen to move back to five points behind Bundesliga leaders 
Bayern Munich with six games to play. Dortmund came into the game knowing that 
Bayern had already beaten Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 earlier in the day. And the 
pressure appeared to have got to the home side when they trailed 2-1 with just 
13 minutes to play. But substitutes Shinji Kagawa, Adrián Ramos and the 
17-year-old American Christian Pulisic all played a part as Dortmund rallied to 
keep their title dream alive.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang broke the deadlock for the home side in the 
Westfalenstadion eight minutes after half-time, chipping the Bremen goalkeeper 
in style for his 23rd goal of the season after Henrikh Mkhitaryan played him 
through.

But Bremen equalised after a corner in the 69th minute when Alejandro Gálvez’s 
shot – which was heading wide – was deflected inside the left post by Dortmund 
midfielder Gonzalo Castro. Zlatko Junuzovic then stunned the home fans in the 
74th minute when he scooped the ball home despite the presence of five Dortmund 
defenders after a great run from Levin Oztunali.

Thomas Tuchel brought on Kagawa, and the Japanese international levelled the 
scores just three minutes later from Marcel Schmelzer’s cross. Ramos then 
scored the winner in the 82nd minute with a header from a Mkhitaryan corner 
that had been earned by Pulisic. Both players had just come on two minutes 
before.
