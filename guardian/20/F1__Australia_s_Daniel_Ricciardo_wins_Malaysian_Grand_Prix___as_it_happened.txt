The famous shoe has been dismissed by Mark Webber, who sensibly decides not to 
join in the quaffing of premium champagne from a sweaty shoe. Thanks for 
joining us on what was a great day for Red Bull, and a major twist in the 
battle for the championship. We‚Äôll go to Japan with Rosberg making Hamilton‚Äôs 
task that much harder in the last five races.

Keep an eye on The Guardian‚Äôs F1 coverage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> for all the wash-up from Sepang, 
and the build-up towards Suzuka.

Ricciardo takes a big sip of champagne from his shoe, and if it was the one 
he‚Äôs just driven 56 laps on a red hot day in then I hope the Red Bull team 
doctor is on standby with a vitamin injection to make sure he gets to Japan.

Max has had a sip too, but remember when you were that age - you‚Äôd drink 
anything.

Plenty of Aussie flags in the crowd to back their man. He started fourth, and 
now he‚Äôs got his fourth win. With Mark Webber handling interview duties on the 
podium this could be a memorable celebration.

A shattered Lewis has blown up like his engine (in a subdued, Lewis kind of

Lap 52 - Rosberg is now over 12 seconds in front of Raikkonen, but whether he 
finishes third or fourth it‚Äôs been a great recovery. Fernando Alonso also 
deserves credit for rising to seventh after starting last on the grid.

In mechanical news Kvyat has reported on the radio that his breaks are going 
to [bleep]. And it really did bleep.

Lap 51 - Five laps remaining and both the Red Bulls need to get past Marcus 
Ericsson. Verstappen loses a 10th of a second but it‚Äôs unlikely to be crucial 
now. The Aussie looks set for his fourth career victory.

Jolyon Palmer is still holding on to 10th, he‚Äôs two seconds in front of Sainz.

Lap 50 - Ricciardo still has a 1.1 second lead, but doesn‚Äôt appear to be in 
any danger of his teammate trying to nick first place from him.

Rosberg has extended his lead over Raikkonen back to more than 10 seconds. 

Meanwhile Esteban Guttierez‚Äôs disappearing left wheel will be investigated 
after the race.

Lap 49 - Max is making his move. The gap is now 1.1 seconds, down 0.3 in a 
lap. Raikkonen is less than 10 seconds behind Rosberg on the track, so at this 
stage he‚Äôll be jumping over him and onto the podium.

Lap 48 - The gap is down to 1.5 seconds, and Verstappen is pushing. Come on 
Max, give us the blockbuster finish! There‚Äôs no tension evident in the Red Bull 
pit.

Meanwhile at the other end of the field Felipe Nasr has pulled into the pits 
and retired his Sauber.

Lap 46 - Red Bull haven‚Äôt had a 1-2 finish since Brazil in 2013, and unless 
something happens that will be replayed on F1 highlights packages for years to 
come (possibly ending with somebody doing an impression of Piquet in 1982?) 
they‚Äôre on track here. The gap is still 1.7 seconds but there‚Äôs no indication 
of Verstappen having a go at his teammate yet.

Lap 44 - Subtle hints from the Red Bull garage that they‚Äôre happy to pack away 
their 1-2 finish and not risk losing everything. Verstappen is not driving like 
somebody who is satisfied with second place. The gap is less than two seconds.

Lap 43 - The Virtual Safety Car is out, and Ricciardo has a lead of 2.3 
seconds on his teammate. Down the other end of the points Jolyon Palmer is now 
sitting 10th, looking to grab the first points of his career.

Rosberg‚Äôs been given a 10 second penalty for the collision with Raikkonen, 
which will drop him back out of the podium positions. He‚Äôs just made up for it 
with the fastest lap.

Mercedes confirms that they had no prior warning of Hamilton‚Äôs engine blow-up, 
it came a surprise to them.

Lap 42 - Ricciardo and Verstappen come into the pits at the same time, causing 
Verstappen to lose about five seconds. We‚Äôve got 14 laps with the Red Bull cars 
on equal tyres.

Esteban Gutierrez is out of the race too, with a missing front left tire. He‚Äôs 
walking around looking at it like he‚Äôs thinking ‚ÄúI wonder where that went‚Äù. And 
the replay showed he had a point, it just popped off and rolled away.

Hamilton out from the lead!

Lap 41 - Lewis Hamilton is OUT! His engine has blown and he was retired. 
Hamilton is shattered, yelling ‚ÄúNo! no! no!‚Äù into the radio and taking a moment 
to compose his thoughts once he was out of the car. That‚Äôs a massive moment not 
just in today‚Äôs race but the battle for the title. Now Ricciardo leads 
Verstappen and the Red Bull battle takes on even more importance.

hands as Lewis extends the gap to 23.6 seconds. Button now our last man in the 
points.

Lap 38 - Rosberg grabs fourth with a brave, bold and brutal move on Raikkonen. 
They touch but both stay on track. Did either driver suffer mechanical damage? 
It could be crucial in the title race.

Lap 36 - Rosberg is having several longing looks at Kimi but can‚Äôt get close 
enough to have a go. The Constructor‚Äôs Championship is practically in the bag 
for Mercedes now, but given that he was just yelling ‚ÄúBLUE FLAG!‚Äù at Jolyon 
Palmer I‚Äôd love to hear Lewis‚Äô reaction if somebody got on the radio and told 
him.

Lap 35 - Rosberg is beginning to trouble Raikkonen now. Both have had two 
stops, and it‚Äôs been a great recovery from Nico after he was dragged into 
disaster at the start. The lead is still 18 over Ricciardo and 20 over 
Verstapped as Hulkenberg passes Sainz to enter the points.

Lap 34 - Not much more time gained between Hamilton and Verstappen on that 
lap. Carlos Sainz is the last man in the points, but Hulkenberg has just passed 
Ericsson and is coming for him quickly.

Lap 31 - After going through the field like the proverbial knife through hot 
butter Rosberg has found Raikkonen too much to deal with. Unless something out

The famous shoe has been dismissed by Mark Webber, who sensibly decides not to 
join in the quaffing of premium champagne from a sweaty shoe. Thanks for 
joining us on what was a great day for Red Bull, and a major twist in the 
battle for the championship. We‚Äôll go to Japan with Rosberg making Hamilton‚Äôs 
task that much harder in the last five races.

Keep an eye on The Guardian‚Äôs F1 coverage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> for all the wash-up from Sepang, 
and the build-up towards Suzuka.
 
Ricciardo takes a big sip of champagne from his shoe, and if it was the one 
he‚Äôs just driven 56 laps on a red hot day in then I hope the Red Bull team 
doctor is on standby with a vitamin injection to make sure he gets to Japan.

Max has had a sip too, but remember when you were that age - you‚Äôd drink 
anything.
 
Plenty of Aussie flags in the crowd to back their man. He started fourth, and 
now he‚Äôs got his fourth win. With Mark Webber handling interview duties on the 
podium this could be a memorable celebration.
 
This one‚Äôs for you Pascal

Your final classification from Sepang: 

1 - Ricciardo 
2 - Verstappen 
3 - Rosberg 
4 - Raikkonen 
5 - Bottas 
6 - Perez 
7 - Alonso 
8 - Hulkenberg 
9 - Button 
10 - Palmer 

and out of the points... 

11 - Sainz 
12 - Ericsson 
13 - Massa 
14 - Kvyat 
15 - Wehrlein 
16 - Ocon 

Failing to finish were Nasr, Hamilton, Gutierrez, Magnussen, Grosjean and 
Vettel.
 
Lap 56 - Ricciardo wins the Malaysian Grand Prix! He finishes 3.0 seconds in 
front of his Red Bull teammate Verstappen.Nico Rosberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> finishes third, 13.8 seconds 
in front of Raikkonen so he will remain in third place.

Rosberg has now got a 23 point lead in the championship.
 
Lap 55 - The race is over at the front, and Jolyon‚Äôs still holding on for 10th.
Renault Sport F1 (@RenaultSportF1) 
2 LAPS REMAINING! No one move ok? Do not jinx this!! #MalaysiaGP

 <https://twitter.com/RenaultSportF1/status/782500042837987328>  
Lap 54 - The gap is now more than three points and Ricciardo will pocket his 
first win since the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix. Aussie fans, he‚Äôs getting 
geographically closer to winning one on home soil!
 
Lap 53 - Crazy scenarios aside this one is over, the lead at the front is now 
2.4 seconds while Rosberg is still more than 10 seconds ahead of Raikkonen.
 
Lap 52 - Rosberg is now over 12 seconds in front of Raikkonen, but whether he 
finishes third or fourth it‚Äôs been a great recovery. Fernando Alonso also 
deserves credit for rising to seventh after starting last on the grid.

In mechanical news Kvyat has reported on the radio that his breaks are going 
to [bleep]. And it really did bleep.
 
Lap 51 - Five laps remaining and both the Red Bulls need to get past Marcus 
Ericsson. Verstappen loses a 10th of a second but it‚Äôs unlikely to be crucial 
now. The Aussie looks set for his fourth career victory.

Jolyon Palmer is still holding on to 10th, he‚Äôs two seconds in front of Sainz.
 
Lap 50 - Ricciardo still has a 1.1 second lead, but doesn‚Äôt appear to be in 
any danger of his teammate trying to nick first place from him.

Rosberg has extended his lead over Raikkonen back to more than 10 seconds. 

Meanwhile Esteban Guttierez‚Äôs disappearing left wheel will be investigated 
after the race.
 
Lap 49 - Max is making his move. The gap is now 1.1 seconds, down 0.3 in a 
lap. Raikkonen is less than 10 seconds behind Rosberg on the track, so at this 
stage he‚Äôll be jumping over him and onto the podium.
 
Lap 48 - The gap is down to 1.5 seconds, and Verstappen is pushing. Come on 
Max, give us the blockbuster finish! There‚Äôs no tension evident in the Red Bull 
pit.

Meanwhile at the other end of the field Felipe Nasr has pulled into the pits 
and retired his Sauber.
 
Lap 47 - Our current top 10 

1 - Ricciardo 
2 - Verstappen 
3 - Rosberg (with a 10 second penalty to come) 
4 - Raikkonen 
5 - Bottas 
6 - Perez 
7 - Alonso 
8 - Hulkenberg 
9 - Button 
10 - Palmer
 
Lap 46 - Red Bull haven‚Äôt had a 1-2 finish since Brazil in 2013, and unless 
something happens that will be replayed on F1 highlights packages for years to 
come (possibly ending with somebody doing an impression of Piquet in 1982?) 
they‚Äôre on track here. The gap is still 1.7 seconds but there‚Äôs no indication 
of Verstappen having a go at his teammate yet.
 
Lap 45 - The gap is two seconds as Ricciardo has a momentary slowdown while 
psasing the Sauber of Felipe Nasr. Verstappen has to get past him as well and 
the two are set for an interesting 10 laps.
 
Lap 44 - Subtle hints from the Red Bull garage that they‚Äôre happy to pack away 
their 1-2 finish and not risk losing everything. Verstappen is not driving like 
somebody who is satisfied with second place. The gap is less than two seconds.
 
Lap 43 - The Virtual Safety Car is out, and Ricciardo has a lead of 2.3 
seconds on his teammate. Down the other end of the points Jolyon Palmer is now 
sitting 10th, looking to grab the first points of his career.

Rosberg‚Äôs been given a 10 second penalty for the collision with Raikkonen, 
which will drop him back out of the podium positions. He‚Äôs just made up for it 
with the fastest lap.

Mercedes confirms that they had no prior warning of Hamilton‚Äôs engine blow-up, 
it came a surprise to them.
 MERCEDES AMG F1 (@MercedesAMGF1) 
Utter, utter dejection...
 <https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/782494659788570624> October 2, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/782494659788570624>  
Lap 42 - Ricciardo and Verstappen come into the pits at the same time, causing 
Verstappen to lose about five seconds. We‚Äôve got 14 laps with the Red Bull cars 
on equal tyres.

Esteban Gutierrez is out of the race too, with a missing front left tire. He‚Äôs 
walking around looking at it like he‚Äôs thinking ‚ÄúI wonder where that went‚Äù. And 
the replay showed he had a point, it just popped off and rolled away.
 
Lap 41 - Lewis Hamilton is OUT! His engine has blown and he was retired. 
Hamilton is shattered, yelling ‚ÄúNo! no! no!‚Äù into the radio and taking a moment 
to compose his thoughts once he was out of the car. That‚Äôs a massive moment not 
just in today‚Äôs race but the battle for the title. Now Ricciardo leads 
Verstappen and the Red Bull battle takes on even more importance.
 
Lap 40 - Ricciardo vs Verstappen are fighting their hearts out. Neither man is 
keen to step aside and let the other one go. This is playing into Hamilton‚Äôs 
hands as Lewis extends the gap to 23.6 seconds. Button now our last man in the 
points.
 
Lap 39 - The two Red Bulls go to war in a thrilling passing duel. Verstappen 
goes within inches of grabbing the lead but Ricciardo shuts the gate on him and 
retains second place. The gap to Hamilton is now 23 seconds.

Meanwhile the Rosberg vs Raikkonen incident is under investigation by the 
stewards.
 
Lap 38 - Rosberg grabs fourth with a brave, bold and brutal move on Raikkonen. 
They touch but both stay on track. Did either driver suffer mechanical damage? 
It could be crucial in the title race.
 
Lap 37 - The gap between Verstappen and Ricciardo has closed to just 0.6 
seconds, but Hamilton has pushed away to a 21 second lead which is approaching 
pit stop territory.
 
Lap 36 - Rosberg is having several longing looks at Kimi but can‚Äôt get close 
enough to have a go. The Constructor‚Äôs Championship is practically in the bag 
for Mercedes now, but given that he was just yelling ‚ÄúBLUE FLAG!‚Äù at Jolyon 
Palmer I‚Äôd love to hear Lewis‚Äô reaction if somebody got on the radio and told 
him.
 
Lap 35 - Rosberg is beginning to trouble Raikkonen now. Both have had two 
stops, and it‚Äôs been a great recovery from Nico after he was dragged into 
disaster at the start. The lead is still 18 over Ricciardo and 20 over 
Verstapped as Hulkenberg passes Sainz to enter the points.
 
Lap 34 - Not much more time gained between Hamilton and Verstappen on that 
lap. Carlos Sainz is the last man in the points, but Hulkenberg has just passed 
Ericsson and is coming for him quickly.
 
Lap 33 - Hamilton has picked up his pace, and the gap is almost 20 seconds now 
(and 16.2 to Ricciardo who we don‚Äôt expect to be a factor). Our last man on 
track is Ocon, running in 19th place in the Manor.
 
Lap 32 - The gap between Hamilton and Verstappen is now 18.5 seconds. He‚Äôs not 
far enough in front of he‚Äôs going to pit, but he‚Äôs gradually building up his 
lead towards the point where he might get away with it. We‚Äôre set for a 
grandstand finish here.
 
Lap 31 - After going through the field like the proverbial knife through hot 
butter Rosberg has found Raikkonen too much to deal with. Unless something out 
of the ordinary happens he‚Äôs going to concede his championship lead today. He 
exits the pits in sixth.
 
Lap 30 - The gap is building between first and third. Lewis is trying to build 
a gap to allow him a pit stop rather than risking getting the car through to 
the end without another visit.

A reminder that our retirements are Vettel, Grosjean and Magnussen
 
Lap 29 - Now that he‚Äôs out on his own Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> has the clear air to set the 
new fastest lap of the race. He‚Äôs 12.2 in front of Ricciardo who will likely 
need to stop again, and 16.8 up on Verstappen who won‚Äôt.
 
Lap 28 - The lead is just under 12 seconds, and depending on the strategy it‚Äôs 
Hamilton‚Äôs race to lose now.

Current top 10

1 - Hamilton
2 - Ricciardo
3 - Verstappen
4 - Raikkonen
5 - Rosberg
6 - Bottas (still hasn‚Äôt stopped)
7 - Perez
8 - Button
9 - Hulkenberg
10 - Palmer
 
Lap 27 - Verstappen is in! He reenters the race in third places, 16.8 seconds 
behind Hamilton and six behind Ricciardo.
 
Lap 26 - It‚Äôs six seconds the gap between Hamilton and Verstappen.

Meanwhile, as the Williams garage try to stay cool we‚Äôre waiting for an update 
about the wellbeing of the person who was wearing that Hello Kitty suit.

Lap 25 - Bottas still hasn‚Äôt pitted, going for a one stopper. He‚Äôs currently 
sixth. Verstappen reports he‚Äôs losing grip on the soft tyres.
 
Lap 24 - The track is still 54 degrees. Here‚Äôs a look at the current tyre

Lap 23 - The gap is down to 7.6 seconds, as speculation breaks out that any or 
all of Hamilton, Ricciardo and Raikkonen opt for a one stop strategy to catch 
Max.
 
Lap 22 - Verstappen leads by eight seconds, with extra encouragement from the 
garage to push a little harder. Bottas now the only man in the top 10 who 
hasn‚Äôt pitted.
 
Lap 21 - Ricciardo leads from Verstappen and Hamilton, but will lose the lead 
as he pits for the first time. Max hits the front by about eight seconds from 
Hamilton.
 
Lap 20 - Raikkonen defends his position against Verstappen into the last 
corner, then pulls into the pits alongside Hamilton. Rosberg goes past Bottas 
into fifth.
 
Lap 19 - In the battle for third for Verstappen is now 1.4 seconds behind 
Raikkonen, with the team telling him to catch and pass Kimi quickly. Max still 
the only man in the top five to have made a stop.
 
Lap 18 - Rosberg is up to seventh, while Kevin Magnussen is called into the 
pits to retire due to damage suffered earlier in the race. The lead is still 
just under six seconds.
 
Lap 17 - The lead is almost six seconds as Vettel responds to Verstappen‚Äôs 
claims that his move was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù by suggesting - as you would expect - it was 
merely a racing incident.
 
Lap 16 - Hamilton leads, but he‚Äôs only 16 seconds in front of Verstappen so he 
needs to get a move on. Ricciardo‚Äôs garage has just let him know they‚Äôll be 
putting hard tyres on when he pits.
