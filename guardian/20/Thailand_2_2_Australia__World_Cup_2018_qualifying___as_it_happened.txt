Socceroos stumble to third draw in a row

Jonathan Howcroft

Before the game the only question was by how many goals Asian Cup holders 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> would beat pointless 
Thailand by. And that faith seemed justified after Mile Jedinak’s early penalty 
reflected the Socceroos’ obvious ascendancy.

But after the pesky Dangda equalised midway through the half the game turned 
on its axis. Thailand gained in confidence, capitalising on Australia’s errors, 
and it was no surprise when they took a second-half lead.

Thereafter it was desperate stuff from the visitors and it took some 
eye-catching cameos from Nathan Burns and Mark Milligan to help snatch a late 
point.

It was as sluggish and off-key a performance as Ange Postecoglou has overseen 
in his time in control of Australia. Aaron Mooy endured his poorest game in a 
gold shirt and all around him players looked skittish.

Japan’s win over Saudi Arabia means after five matches Australia drop to third 
in Group B, and if the UAE defeat Iraq there could be four teams separated by 
just one point at the halfway mark of this phase. It’s not where Australia 
expected to find themselves after winning their opening two matches.

88 min: Australia finally enjoy some pressure after what seems like an age in 
defence but the likeliest source of a goal seems to be the other way with 
Thailand exposing the tired Socceroos on the counter.

This is a desperate end-to-end slog now.

86 min: HUGE chance for Thailand. Australia’s weary defence is cut open and 
Chatthong is through one on one but Ryan is up to the task, rushes out and 
smothers the opportunity.

85 min: Sainsbury the latest to dive in just outside the box and concede a 
free-kick that Ryan will not be happy about. Irvine defends superbly and repels

Deary me, Mooy misplaced two passes in the space of five seconds. He went half 
a season at Melbourne City before he gave the ball away so cheaply.

80 min: Irvine for Spiranovic is Postecoglou’s final change. Spiranovic is 
another who won’t want to watch the replay of tonight’s match.

77 min: The number of seemingly avoidable offsides to Socceroo forwards this 
match does not reflect favourably on the Australian education system. Kruse 
again wanders behind Thailand’s defence. Shortly afterwards Mooy turns out of 
space and into trouble. This is the poorest game I’ve seen the Huddersfield 
Town star play in years.

Ooof! From nowhere, Burns cuts inside and leathers a left-footed howitzer that 
clips the Thailand crossbar. This has been a handy cameo for the substitute.

75 min: Another foul on the edge of Australia’s penalty area. Wider this time, 
but another dangerous situation, made more dangerous by a lack of communication 
almost causing Smith to concede a corner when a goal kick was inevitable.

*Ball comes central*
*Brad Smith moves centrally*
*Thailand player drops out wide, receives the ball in behind*
Rinse and repeat. #THAvAUS <https://twitter.com/hashtag/THAvAUS?src=hash>

73 min: Thailand’s time to suffer Australian faults in the final third. Moving 
the ball nicely but failing to execute the killer pass when it mattered. The 
pitch is an increasing liability, by the way, divots and molehills all over the 
place.

68 min: Out of nowhere Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> again look the likelier 
winners. Credit is due to Postecoglou and his reshuffle, now, can they seal the 
deal? Degenek fouling Chatthong on the edge of Mat Ryan’s box won’t help. But 
the free-kick fails to raise green and gold pulses.

GOAL! Thailand 2-2 Australia (Jedinak 65)

Phew! That was unconvincing from Jedinak who stroked it low to the keeper’s 
right and it just sneaked through him for the equaliser.

PENALTY! - Australia

A third penalty of the night, a second for Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Jedinak fouled as he attacked 
a deep Mooy free-kick. Lots of shirt pulling and the Aussie skipper hit the 
deck.

63 min: Burns is buzzing, adding some much needed energy to the Australian 
performance, but once again the final pass catches its intended recipient off 
guard and the chance fizzles out.

That early profligacy with the game at their mercy is haunting Australia

62 min: The substitutes have helped Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> regroup and control the ball 
for the first time this half. Both Burns and Milligan involved to force a 
corner. Mooy’s delivery is then inch perfect onto the forehead of Jedinak but a 
diving save from the keeper keeps Thailand ahead.

Trying to figure out the Socceroos’ new formation. It’ll be a variation of a 
4-4-2, presumably a diamond, with Kruse and Burns up front.

PENALTY - Thailand

Thailand swarming all over Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> and one attack finally 
provokes a fault. Leckie, diving into an unnecessary challenge on Bunmathan, 
and a penalty had to be awarded.

53 min: The three defensive midfield screeners are now a strategic factor for 
Thailand. In the first half they were bypassed at will but since the break 
they’ve remained behind the ball throughout and Australia’s midfield looks 
unsure how to respond. Gold is ceding to blue around halfway often and these 
turnovers are dictating play Thailand’s way.

51 min: This has been a poor start to the half from Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Sloppy in possession and 
outfought by Thailand all over the pitch. It might need some lateral thinking 
from Postecoglou to regain control.

I’m inclined to agree with the former Socceroo, so long as an effort’s been 
made a half-time to figure out that broken link in the chain in the final third.

@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> I wonder if Australia's recent 
issues come down to the lack of a big name player in the side like Viduka, 
Cahill, Kewell before?

<https://twitter.com/sibo373/status/798505846003138560> 
Perhaps. Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have 
improved collectively in recent years but there isn’t the forceful personality 
to grab a game by the scruff of the neck or sprinkle that little bit of magic 
just when it’s needed. Peak Viduka would transform a night like this.

Half-time: Thailand 1-1 Australia

A thoroughly entertaining half of football ends 1-1. 

Both teams were committed to attack, Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> more often than Thailand but 
without the penetration Postecoglou would have hoped for. Jedinak’s early 
penalty was cancelled out midway through the half after Dangda finished off a 
lovely passage of play for the hosts.

45 min: The game stretches when Thailand attack but Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> can’t capitalise on the 
counter, preferring to slow play down and look for the cute release. So far 
that pass has eluded them with the home side getting enough bodies behind the 
ball when it counts.

43 min: The pitch is starting to resemble a firing range after a series of 
heavy artillery tests, making it impossible for either team to attack the ball 
with any confidence. Thailand continue their brief resurgence though, forcing 
Brad Smith into a desperate saving tackle.

41 min: The Socceroos have dominated the last 10 minutes but the killer pass 
remains elusive. Mooy this time fails to time his through-ball to Kruse when 
there was ample opportunity to feed his forward. Thailand respond with 
customary attacking elan - they really are lovely to watch - and Ryan had to be 
on his toes a couple of times.

39 min: Australia keep plugging away, looking for the ball to bobble in their 
favour near the Thai box. It almost does for Maclaren, whose penalty appeals 
are waved away. A Mooy corner comes to nought.

Australia only manage a draw in World Cup qualifier away to Thailand

Before the game the only question was by how many goals Asian Cup holders 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> would beat pointless 
Thailand by. And that faith seemed justified after Mile Jedinak’s early penalty 
reflected the Socceroos’ obvious ascendancy.

But after the pesky Dangda equalised midway through the half the game turned 
on its axis. Thailand gained in confidence, capitalising on Australia’s errors, 
and it was no surprise when they took a second-half lead.

Thereafter it was desperate stuff from the visitors and it took some 
eye-catching cameos from Nathan Burns and Mark Milligan to help snatch a late 
point.

It was as sluggish and off-key a performance as Ange Postecoglou has overseen 
in his time in control of Australia. Aaron Mooy endured his poorest game in a 
gold shirt and all around him players looked skittish.

Japan’s win over Saudi Arabia means after five matches Australia drop to third 
in Group B, and if the UAE defeat Iraq there could be four teams separated by 
just one point at the halfway mark of this phase. It’s not where Australia 
expected to find themselves after winning their opening two matches.

What a game! Frenetic, end-to-end, topsy-turvy stuff. 
 
90 + 5 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> clear, 
and the final whistle blows.
 
90 + 4 min: Still they come! Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> can’t retain possession and 
their desperate back four is again forced to rush around chasing blue runners. 
Corner... final seconds...
 
90 + 3 min: Thailand not giving up here and another burst down the left 
threatens Australia’s box. The crowd are adamant there was a handball too when 
a speculative shot flew in, but the referee decline to award a fourth penalty.
 
90 + 1 min: Irvine booked for hauling down a marauding Thai counterattack 
before it reached dangerous territory. You’ll take those every week for your 
team at this time of the game.
 
90 min: Kruse offside, again...
 
88 min: Australia finally enjoy some pressure after what seems like an age in 
defence but the likeliest source of a goal seems to be the other way with 
Thailand exposing the tired Socceroos on the counter.

This is a desperate end-to-end slog now. 
 
86 min: HUGE chance for Thailand. Australia’s weary defence is cut open and 
Chatthong is through one on one but Ryan is up to the task, rushes out and 
smothers the opportunity.
 
85 min: Sainsbury the latest to dive in just outside the box and concede a 
free-kick that Ryan will not be happy about. Irvine defends superbly and repels 
the threat.
 
84 min: First substitution for Thailand, Malapun - on debut - for Promrak.

Deary me, Mooy misplaced two passes in the space of five seconds. He went half 
a season at Melbourne City before he gave the ball away so cheaply.
 
82 min: A few injuries, cramp and fouls have taken the sting out of the game, 
for the first time in a frenetic match.
 
80 min: Irvine for Spiranovic is Postecoglou’s final change. Spiranovic is 
another who won’t want to watch the replay of tonight’s match.

77 min: The number of seemingly avoidable offsides to Socceroo forwards this 
match does not reflect favourably on the Australian education system. Kruse 
again wanders behind Thailand’s defence. Shortly afterwards Mooy turns out of 
space and into trouble. This is the poorest game I’ve seen the Huddersfield 
Town star play in years.

Ooof! From nowhere, Burns cuts inside and leathers a left-footed howitzer that 
clips the Thailand crossbar. This has been a handy cameo for the substitute.
 
75 min: Another foul on the edge of Australia’s penalty area. Wider this time, 
but another dangerous situation, made more dangerous by a lack of communication 
almost causing Smith to concede a corner when a goal kick was inevitable.

73 min: Thailand’s time to suffer Australian faults in the final third. Moving 
the ball nicely but failing to execute the killer pass when it mattered. The 
pitch is an increasing liability, by the way, divots and molehills all over the 
place.
 
71 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> negotiate a 
couple of corners but Thailand have monopolised possession since the equaliser.

68 min: Out of nowhere Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> again look the likelier 
winners. Credit is due to Postecoglou and his reshuffle, now, can they seal the 
deal? Degenek fouling Chatthong on the edge of Mat Ryan’s box won’t help. But 
the free-kick fails to raise green and gold pulses.
 
Phew! That was unconvincing from Jedinak who stroked it low to the keeper’s 
right and it just sneaked through him for the equaliser.
 
A third penalty of the night, a second for Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Jedinak fouled as he attacked 
a deep Mooy free-kick. Lots of shirt pulling and the Aussie skipper hit the 
deck.
 
63 min: Burns is buzzing, adding some much needed energy to the Australian 
performance, but once again the final pass catches its intended recipient off 
guard and the chance fizzles out.

That early profligacy with the game at their mercy is haunting Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>.
 
62 min: The substitutes have helped Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> regroup and control the ball 
for the first time this half. Both Burns and Milligan involved to force a 
corner. Mooy’s delivery is then inch perfect onto the forehead of Jedinak but a 
diving save from the keeper keeps Thailand ahead.

Trying to figure out the Socceroos’ new formation. It’ll be a variation of a 
4-4-2, presumably a diamond, with Kruse and Burns up front.
 
60 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> are 
shellshocked. Maclaren and Leckie have been sacrificed for Milligan and Burns.
 
Dangda calmly sends Ryan the wrong way and sends Thailand into a deserved lead.

Well well well...
 
Thailand swarming all over Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> and one attack finally 
provokes a fault. Leckie, diving into an unnecessary challenge on Bunmathan, 
and a penalty had to be awarded.
 
56 min: One-way traffic in Bangkok and it’s all in favour of the pointless 
locals. Songkrasin dribbles like George Best down the left and his cross causes 
chaos butAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> survive, 
just.
 
53 min: The three defensive midfield screeners are now a strategic factor for 
Thailand. In the first half they were bypassed at will but since the break 
they’ve remained behind the ball throughout and Australia’s midfield looks 
unsure how to respond. Gold is ceding to blue around halfway often and these 
turnovers are dictating play Thailand’s way.
 
51 min: This has been a poor start to the half from Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. Sloppy in possession and 
outfought by Thailand all over the pitch. It might need some lateral thinking 
from Postecoglou to regain control.
 
49 min: All Thailand so far who are first to every contested ball and making 
Mooy in particular look like his head’s still in the sheds.
 
47 min: Early chance for Thailand after Spiranovic is again penalised for 
going into a tackle too strongly but the free-kick from a dangerous position 
cannons into the wall.
 
46 min: Second half underway, and there are no changes from either side.

I’m inclined to agree with the former Socceroo, so long as an effort’s been 
made a half-time to figure out that broken link in the chain in the final third.
 Simon Boendermaker (@sibo373) 
@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> I wonder if Australia's recent 
issues come down to the lack of a big name player in the side like Viduka, 
Cahill, Kewell before?

<https://twitter.com/sibo373/status/798505846003138560> 
Perhaps. Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> have 
improved collectively in recent years but there isn’t the forceful personality 
to grab a game by the scruff of the neck or sprinkle that little bit of magic 
just when it’s needed. Peak Viduka would transform a night like this.
 
Brining you up to speed elsewhere in the group - Japan held on to defeat Saudi 
Arabia 2-1, meaning as things stand,Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> drop to third.
 
So, what does Ange Postecoglou say to his team at the break?

 <https://twitter.com/theafcdotcom/status/798507755413925888>  
A thoroughly entertaining half of football ends 1-1. 

Both teams were committed to attack, Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> more often than Thailand but 
without the penetration Postecoglou would have hoped for. Jedinak’s early 
penalty was cancelled out midway through the half after Dangda finished off a 
lovely passage of play for the hosts.
 
45 min: The game stretches when Thailand attack but Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> can’t capitalise on the 
counter, preferring to slow play down and look for the cute release. So far 
that pass has eluded them with the home side getting enough bodies behind the 
ball when it counts.
 
43 min: The pitch is starting to resemble a firing range after a series of 
heavy artillery tests, making it impossible for either team to attack the ball 
with any confidence. Thailand continue their brief resurgence though, forcing 
Brad Smith into a desperate saving tackle.
 
41 min: The Socceroos have dominated the last 10 minutes but the killer pass 
remains elusive. Mooy this time fails to time his through-ball to Kruse when 
there was ample opportunity to feed his forward. Thailand respond with 
customary attacking elan - they really are lovely to watch - and Ryan had to be 
on his toes a couple of times.
 
39 min: Australia keep plugging away, looking for the ball to bobble in their 
favour near the Thai box. It almost does for Maclaren, whose penalty appeals 
are waved away. A Mooy corner comes to nought.
 
37 min: Rogic lets fly from range, but it flies over the crossbar.
