Tottenham have signed Georges-Kévin Nkoudou from Marseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> on a five-year contract more 
than 40 days after he passed his medical, with the Spurs forward Clinton Njie 
joining the French club on a season-long loan.

In one of the most protracted transfer sagas of any transfer window and which 
saw the Spurs head of recruitment, Paul Mitchell,tender his resignation

, Nkoudou has signed a five-year deal at White Hart Lane for a fee of around 
£9.4m – a reduction of £1.6m from the fee agreed with Marseille in mid-July. 
The Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, attempted to restructure the deal despite 
the 21-year-old forward having already completed a medical and negotiations 
broke down.

That impasse led to Mitchell announcing he would leave, stating his dream job 
hadturned into a nightmare.

 The 34-year-old, who worked under Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton, must 
serve out a six-month notice period at the club before he is allowed to depart 
amid interest from Leicester.

Levy then decided to revive the deal and reopened discussions with Marseille’s 
new owner, coming toan agreement in principle

 on 19 August. Having spent a month in a London hotel, Nkoudou was then given 
permission to report to Tottenham’s training ground to join Pochettino’s squad, 
although that was not the end of his waiting game.

Spurs made two bids for Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha but were told the 
winger was not for sale. The deal was ratified by Levy on Wednesday – days 
after Pochettino had admitted his priority was to sign a new forward with pace 
after the departure of Nacer Chadli to West Bromwich.

At least Nkoudou could see the funny side of it. “Nkoudou signs but I’m 40 
years old now so I’m not sure to be as quick as I used to be,” he tweeted a few 
minutes after the deal was confirmed by Tottenham.

“I can’t wait to get to know the Premier League and the English game,” he 
added. “It suits my playing style, it’s explosive. Everyone knows I’m fast, I 
like to dribble around players so the English league is best for me.”

Born in Versailles, he began his career at Paris Saint-Germain before joining 
Nantes in 2013 and moved to the Stade Vélodrome last summer for only £1m.

Njie was understood to be initially reluctant to return to France having 
played only 184 minutes in the Premier League last season in eight appearances 
before being persuaded that his game time would be limited if he remained at 
Spurs.

Tottenham also made inquiries for Morgan Schneiderlin of Manchester United 
earlier in the week but were unwilling to match the club’s valuation. However 
Pau López, an Espanyol goalkeeper, has joined Spurs on a season-long loan and 
the club eventuallycompleted a late £30m move

 for France midfielder Moussa Sissoko from Newcastle.
