Olivier Giroud <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olivier-giroud> is likely 
to stay at Arsenal, according to his agent, playing down speculation linking 
the Arsenal striker with a move to Napoli.

Uncertainty surrounding the 29-year-old’s future at the Emirates intensified 
after reports the France international had been included in a deal to bring 
Napoli’s Argentinastriker Gonzalo Higuaín to Arsenal

 and Giroud’s agent, Michael Manuello, suggested any incoming striker would be 
a replacement for the injured Danny Welbeck, not for his client.

“Everything I’ve read on Giroud is not true. I personally have only said that 
ifArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> want to sell, then we 
will see,” Manuello told the London Evening Standard.

“I do not know where [the Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> 
story] came from. We never talked to Naples and there are no other persons 
appointed over me that can do this. We need to clarify this.

“You always need two strikers and Welbeck is out for nine months, 
unfortunately. But if you play in a great team, it is natural that we could 
face strong competition.”

Arsenal, who finished second in the Premier League last season, begin the new 
campaign on 14 August at home to Liverpool.
