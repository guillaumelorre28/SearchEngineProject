Glenn Walker scored the only goal of the game for Brackley Town as the 
Conference North side reached the second round of the FA Cup for the first time 
by upsettingGillingham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gillingham>.

They rode their luck in Monday night's first-round replay and were indebted to 
their 20-year-old goalkeeper Alastair Worby on more than one occasion but held 
on and will meet Macclesfield next month.

Walker's winning goal came in the 21st minute with a deflected strike from 
outside the box and League One Gillingham could not find a way back as they 
were denied by Worby and hit the post through Joe Martin and Cody McDonald.
