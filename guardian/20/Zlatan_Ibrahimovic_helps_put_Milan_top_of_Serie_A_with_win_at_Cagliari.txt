Milan will be top of SerieÂ A for 24 hours at least, after a 2-0 victory over 
Cagliari <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cagliari> at the Stadio 
Sant'Elia on Tuesday.

Cagliari had the bulk of the possession but lacked a cutting edge in front of 
goal and Milan picked up the points thanks to a fourth-minute Francesco Pisano 
own goal and aZlatan Ibrahimovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zlatan-ibrahimovic> strike on the hour. 
The win took Milan a point clear of Juventus, who can return to the top with 
victory at third-placed Udinese on Wednesday night.

In the day's other game, Siena and Fiorentina's keenly contested Tuscan derby 
at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence ended goalless.
