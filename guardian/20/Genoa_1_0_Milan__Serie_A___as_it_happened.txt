And that’s that. A reasonably good game, even if things did get rather scrappy 
in the closing stages. Genoa lacked ambition rather, even with their man 
advantage, and you suspect that hadMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> not been reduced to ten just 
before half-time, then they would have probably done enough to come back and 
win this one.

Still, Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> were the better team 
in the first-half, and held on in the face of some fine attacking from 
Balotelli (who was largely pretty good) and chums. That’s just their second win 
of the season.

90 mins + 3: Bacca goes to block a clearance from Burdisso, is penalised for 
it, but carries on like the striker had just stolen his shoes. One suspects it 
was less outrage, more a tactic to waste time. Then there’s some jiggery pokery 
with the crowd keeping the ball, before two are thrown on. Old as the hills.

89 mins: Bertolacci hoys over a free kick from out on the right, but Lamanna

88 mins: Ntcham tries a sneaky pass through looking for Gakpe, but the sub had

80 mins: Another sub for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>,

74 mins: Perotti breaks down the left and tries a rabona cross, but he can’t 
get the required elevation on it and Zapata clears. The ball breaks to Capel 
who cuts in from the right and shoots left-footed, but that goes comfortably 
over the bar.

73 mins: Laxalt finds himself on the right and bursts into the area from that

be offside, but he fires his shot just wide of the near post.

71 mins: Rincon goes to ground, claiming a slap in the face from Balotelli, 
but it was more a half-push near his face. Which isn’t quite the same. De 
Sciglio legs Capel up when the winger was going nowhere, which seems careless.

68 mins: Chance for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, as 
Adriano lays back a cross for Bertolacci, who shoots low aiming for the bottom 
corner, but Marchese - who had fallen over after the challenge from Adriano - 
unwittingly blocks the thing while prone.

his own half, brilliantly skips around a couple of defenders before Dzemaili 
wipes him out with a cynical trip. He’s booked.

66 mins: Balotelli cuts inside and tries to make room for a shot, but is 
tackled by a well-timed, but tough challenge from Dzemaili. Balotelli goes down 
clutching his shin, which may have been caught on the follow-through, but that 
was a fair tackle.

side of the box, but he’s off balance and shoots rather weakly, straight at 
Lamanna.

61 mins: Adriano produces a nice flick to give Bertolacci a chance to run at 
goal, but Di Maio drags him to the ground, is booked, and gives away a free 
kick about 25 yards out, and to the left. Balotelli eyes it up...

58 mins: Pavoletti is put clean through on goal...but once more he’s halted by 
the terrible upswing of the linesman’s flag. Being caught offside three times 
in seven minutes is impressive, in many ways.

57 mins: A nice flick on by Balotelli gives Bonaventura a shooting chance, 
which he takes but the effort doesn’t have enough power and Lamanna deals with 
it quite easily.

51 mins: Genoa launch a decent attack, keeping the ball for a while before 
Marchese loops over a cross from the left, looking for Pavoletti, but he was a 
yard or so offside.

49 mins: Brilliant stuff from Balotelli, who drives through the middle then 
plays Adriano in with a little rabona, the Brazilian shoots but it’s saved by 
Lamanna.Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> then claim a 
penalty as Bonaventura’s shot is blocked by Marchese’s arm, but the since the 
shot came from about four yards away, that would’ve been very harsh.

You’d struggle to argue that Genoa haven’t been the better team in that half, 
although they have been rather fortunate in many ways. Their goal came via a 
whacking great deflection, and the dismissal of Romagnoli was part of some very 
inconsistent refereeing. Mihajlovic will have some work to do ifMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are to get anything from this 
one, but by withdrawing De Jong rather than one of the forwards it doesn’t look 
like he’ll be putting the shutters up.

seconds for the break, and secondly that it’s De Jong that is withdrawn. 
Rodrigo Ely is the man who comes on.

44 mins: Looks like De Jong has dropped into defence, and it might not be the 
worst thing - he’ll probably be better there than on the right wing, where he 
was basically playing for much of the previous 43 minutes.

Red card for Romagnoli!

42 mins: Zapata stupidly gives the ball straight to Capel, who runs at goal 
but looks like he loses control of the ball, only for Romagnoli to shove his 
arm across the Spaniard’s face, which earns him a second booking, and he’s off.

40 mins: Dzmaili takes the free kick, it’s blocked by Balotelli in the wall, 
but play is halted after Zapata collides with Pavoletti in the area, the former 
requiring some treatment. The referee instructsMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> to kick the ball back to Genoa, 
and there’s some dissent from the crowd as Balotelli goes on the wind-up to 
keep the ball from them.

38 mins: De Jong fouls two Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>

second - a charge from behind on Dzemaili, is worth a free kick. Very good of

Cheers for reading - now head over here to follow the lunchtime Championship 
fixture betweenMiddlesbrough and Leeds with Niall McVeigh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/sep/27/middlesbrough-v-leeds-united-championship-live>
.
 
And that’s that. A reasonably good game, even if things did get rather scrappy 
in the closing stages. Genoa lacked ambition rather, even with their man 
advantage, and you suspect that hadMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> not been reduced to ten just 
before half-time, then they would have probably done enough to come back and 
win this one.

Still, Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> were the better team 
in the first-half, and held on in the face of some fine attacking from 
Balotelli (who was largely pretty good) and chums. That’s just their second win 
of the season.
 
Peeeeeeeeeep. 
 
90 mins + 6: ...Balotelli swings the cross over, Ely is unmarked...but he 
heads wide!
 
90 mins + 5: Izzo fouls Balotelli on the left and this really is Milan’s last 
chance...
 
90 mins + 4: Rincon attacks down the right, but Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> have been hanging on for a few 
minutes now and their attacks are decidedly half-hearted.
 
90 mins + 3: Bacca goes to block a clearance from Burdisso, is penalised for 
it, but carries on like the striker had just stolen his shoes. One suspects it 
was less outrage, more a tactic to waste time. Then there’s some jiggery pokery 
with the crowd keeping the ball, before two are thrown on. Old as the hills.
 
90 mins +1: Mihajlovic struts around his technical area dressed in his maroon 
waistcoat, like Mick Jagger if he’d gone shopping in Next.
 
90 mins: Four minutes of added time. De Sciglio celebrates by committing two 
fouls in 30 seconds.
 
89 mins: Bertolacci hoys over a free kick from out on the right, but Lamanna 
comes out to claim the cross. That golden Kucka chances might well have been 
their last.
 
88 mins: Ntcham tries a sneaky pass through looking for Gakpe, but the sub had 
stopped running, which was a set-back for the chances of that one working out, 
to say the least.
 
86 mins: Glorious chance for Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, as Bertolacci and Adriano 
combine to create some space and set up a chance for Kucka, but he shovels it 
way over the bar. He should’ve at least hit the target with that one.
 
85 mins: One last sub for Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> - 
Pavoletti’s assault on the linesman’s arm is over, and Serge Gakpe comes on.
 
84 mins: Balotelli swings a dangerous cross over from the right, but De Maio 
does well to stoop and head away with Bacca lurking.
 
83 mins: Genoa counter through the middle with Rincon, but is tracked back by 
Adriano, tripped, and theMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> 
man is booked.
 
81 mins: Balotelli charges through the middle and De Maio goes down clutching 
his chops, but he’s gently encouraged to get back up again by all concerned.
 
80 mins: Another sub for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, 
and they’re very much going for it - Bonaventura comes off, and Carlos Bacca is 
on. Looks like it will be a 4-2-3 system for the remainder.
 
77 mins: A combination of Bonaventura and Kucka try to create something on the 
left forMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, but only succeed 
in hitting the first man a couple of times with their crosses.
 
76 mins: ...but he hits it at about waist-height into the wall. 
 
75 mins: Change for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> - 
Montolivio is off, and Juraj Kucka, a former Genoa player, comes on. Meanwhile, 
Balotelli is lining up another free kick...
 
74 mins: Perotti breaks down the left and tries a rabona cross, but he can’t 
get the required elevation on it and Zapata clears. The ball breaks to Capel 
who cuts in from the right and shoots left-footed, but that goes comfortably 
over the bar.
 
73 mins: Laxalt finds himself on the right and bursts into the area from that 
side, he cuts back to Pavoletti, who since the ball was played backwards can’t 
be offside, but he fires his shot just wide of the near post.
 
71 mins: Rincon goes to ground, claiming a slap in the face from Balotelli, 
but it was more a half-push near his face. Which isn’t quite the same. De 
Sciglio legs Capel up when the winger was going nowhere, which seems careless.
 
70 mins: Another change for Genoa, and Manchester City loanee Olivier Ntcham 
comes on for Marchese. Looks likeGenoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> will switch to a back four with 
Ntcham slotting into midfield.
 
68 mins: Chance for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, as 
Adriano lays back a cross for Bertolacci, who shoots low aiming for the bottom 
corner, but Marchese - who had fallen over after the challenge from Adriano - 
unwittingly blocks the thing while prone.
 
67 mins: ...but that time it wasn’t. Balotelli picks the ball up well inside 
his own half, brilliantly skips around a couple of defenders before Dzemaili 
wipes him out with a cynical trip. He’s booked.
 
66 mins: Balotelli cuts inside and tries to make room for a shot, but is 
tackled by a well-timed, but tough challenge from Dzemaili. Balotelli goes down 
clutching his shin, which may have been caught on the follow-through, but that 
was a fair tackle.
 
64 mins: Another chance for Balotelli, as Bertolacci sets him free on the left 
side of the box, but he’s off balance and shoots rather weakly, straight at 
Lamanna.
 
62 mins: ...and curls it just over. 
 
61 mins: Adriano produces a nice flick to give Bertolacci a chance to run at 
goal, but Di Maio drags him to the ground, is booked, and gives away a free 
kick about 25 yards out, and to the left. Balotelli eyes it up...
 
58 mins: Pavoletti is put clean through on goal...but once more he’s halted by 
the terrible upswing of the linesman’s flag. Being caught offside three times 
in seven minutes is impressive, in many ways.
 
57 mins: A nice flick on by Balotelli gives Bonaventura a shooting chance, 
which he takes but the effort doesn’t have enough power and Lamanna deals with 
it quite easily.
 
56 mins: Sub for Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>, with 
Figueiras removed, replaced by Ardmando Izzo.
 
55 mins: Laxalt is well and truly pantsing Calabria here, and once again 
dances past the young full-back, who chops him down and gets himself a booking.
 
54 mins: Perotti is causing one or two problems with some neat passes, and 
after a couple of those he tries to feed Pavoletti, but perhaps in some sort of 
tribute to departedMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> manager 
Filippo Inzaghi, he’s once again offside.
 
52 mins: Montolivio wins a free kick out on the left for Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, which Bonaventura clips into 
the box, but Ely was doing some pushing, so nothing comes of it.
 
51 mins: Genoa launch a decent attack, keeping the ball for a while before 
Marchese loops over a cross from the left, looking for Pavoletti, but he was a 
yard or so offside.
 
49 mins: Brilliant stuff from Balotelli, who drives through the middle then 
plays Adriano in with a little rabona, the Brazilian shoots but it’s saved by 
Lamanna.Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> then claim a 
penalty as Bonaventura’s shot is blocked by Marchese’s arm, but the since the 
shot came from about four yards away, that would’ve been very harsh.
 
48 mins: Laxalt attacks down the left for Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa>, trying to get at Calabria, before 
cutting back to Dzemaili who tries a shot from about 25 yards, but shanks it 
and it flies well wide.
 
46 mins: The players are out for the second 45. Can Meeeeeeeeelan hold on, 
then come back? We shall find out soon, because that’s how time works.
 
You’d struggle to argue that Genoa haven’t been the better team in that half, 
although they have been rather fortunate in many ways. Their goal came via a 
whacking great deflection, and the dismissal of Romagnoli was part of some very 
inconsistent refereeing. Mihajlovic will have some work to do ifMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> are to get anything from this 
one, but by withdrawing De Jong rather than one of the forwards it doesn’t look 
like he’ll be putting the shutters up.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeep. 
 
45 mins +1: Sub for Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, 
which is a bit odd in two ways; firstly that Mihajlovic didn’t wait the 60 
seconds for the break, and secondly that it’s De Jong that is withdrawn. 
Rodrigo Ely is the man who comes on.
 
45 mins: Two minutes of added time, as Genoa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> immediately look to make the most 
of their advantage.
 
44 mins: Looks like De Jong has dropped into defence, and it might not be the 
worst thing - he’ll probably be better there than on the right wing, where he 
was basically playing for much of the previous 43 minutes.
 
43 mins: That probably was a booking, but Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> can feel slightly aggrieved 
given what this referee has let go elsewhere in this game.
 
42 mins: Zapata stupidly gives the ball straight to Capel, who runs at goal 
but looks like he loses control of the ball, only for Romagnoli to shove his 
arm across the Spaniard’s face, which earns him a second booking, and he’s off.
 
40 mins: Dzmaili takes the free kick, it’s blocked by Balotelli in the wall, 
but play is halted after Zapata collides with Pavoletti in the area, the former 
requiring some treatment. The referee instructsMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> to kick the ball back to Genoa, 
and there’s some dissent from the crowd as Balotelli goes on the wind-up to 
keep the ball from them.
 
39 mins: Genoa sweep down the pitch and Perotti feeds Pavoletti, but is 
tripped by Calabria. The young full-back looks like he’s drowning not waving, 
here.
 
38 mins: De Jong fouls two Genoa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/genoa> 
players in the space of about two seconds, and the referee decides that the 
second - a charge from behind on Dzemaili, is worth a free kick. Very good of 
him.
 
36 mins: Capel finds himself out on the right and cuts in, Arjen Robben style, 
firing a shot at goal, but it’s straight at Lopez and without the sort of power 
to trouble the keeper.
 
35 mins: A corner from the left for Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> is swung over, Balotelli and 
Zapata rise at the near post and the former gets there first, heading across 
goal but just wide of the back stick, with Romagnoli just unable to turn it 
home.
