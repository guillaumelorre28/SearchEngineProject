Scunthorpe United lost two goals and two goalkeepers in their League One game 
at home toBristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity>, with 
both players suffering broken arms.

First Sam Slocombe was injured punching away a cross after eight minutes and 
had to be replaced by James Severn. He conceded Bristol City’s first goal, a 
35th-minute penalty converted by Jay Emmanuel-Thomas. That had been given away 
by Andrew Boyce for a foul on Matt Smith – and seven minutes later Boyce found 
himself in goal.

Severn was involved in a collision with Emmanuel-Thomas and Mark Robins, the 
Scunthorpe manager,told the club’s website

: “We’ve lost two goalkeepers in this game to the same injury – both broken 
arms under a challenge from one of their players,” he added.

“I don’t know the full extent of the damage but it’s sufficient enough that 
I’m going to need at least one more goalkeeper. I’m massively disappointed for 
them both and I’m disappointed for all the players because we were the better 
team on the day.”

Boyce held firm until the 84th minute, when Luke Freeman secured a 2-0 win. 
Robins added: “I’m proud of my players because every one of them to a man has 
been absolutely magnificent. It typifies the spirit in the camp when Andrew 
Boyce goes in and takes over in goal but I’m just really disappointed. The 
supporters were magnificent. They could see what the players were trying to do 
and I thought we were excellent.”
