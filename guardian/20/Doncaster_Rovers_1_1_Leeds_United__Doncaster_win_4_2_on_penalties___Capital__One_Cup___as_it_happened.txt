Overall, that was not a good advert for the Capital One Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup>. A match characterised 
by a couple of bad tackles, a lot of bad shooting and an avalanche of terrible 
set-pieces is decided by a couple of bad penalties.

That Chris Wood penalty was terribly, terribly terrible. With Leeds already 
behind on penalties, he justhad to hit the target. He didn’t.

Byram’s penalty was high. This one was HIGH! Bold and capital. Hapless.

Byram aims high to the right, but spears it too high, and it clears the bar by

Score after extra time: Still Doncaster 1-1 Leeds

Given the quality of set pieces over the last two hours of football, this 
could go on for a while.

120+1 mins: Doncaster cross from the right, Turnbull catches, runs into

109 mins: As corners in this game go, that one was pretty magnificent. Still, 
it found only a Leeds head.

105+1 mins: Tyson collapses under pressure from Bellusci on the edge of the 
Leeds penalty area, but the referee is not impressed. Moments later, the 
whistle goes to end the first half of extra time. The PA plays Shout by Tears 
for Fears. The words “these are the things I can do without” seem pertinent, as 
this tense but far from terrific encounter just keeps on going.

105 mins: Leeds hit the post! Antenucci goes on a lovely run, cutting this way 
and that, but then he holds on to the ball too long, runs out of options, has a 
speculative shot on goal and sees it deflect onto the near post! It bounces out 
rather than in, though, and Doncaster clear.

100 mins: Another Leeds corner, again taken short, again comes to nothing. 
Really, this is getting quite aggravating. Useless short corners, useless loopy 
corners, we’ve had all sorts of corners except the good sort.

98 mins: After another short corner and a bit of passing around the edge of 
the area, Cooper shoots high for Leeds. If any of these players have a spare 
pair of boots, it’s time to put them on. The ones they’re wearing are useless.

95 mins: Leeds have their best chance for an aeon! It falls to Byram, found by 
Antenucci running left to right into the penalty area and shooting back across

90 mins: Coppinger crosses from the right, but by the time the ball reaches 
the middle Andy Williams is on the ground. Didn’t seem much in it, and the 
referee tells him to get up.

88 mins: Now Coppinger cuts in from the right and then shoots with his left 
foot across goal and wide. Great pressure from Doncaster, but no goal. Can they 
stop this game going to extra time? Um, please?

86 mins: Ooooooooh! A lovely cross from the right finds Williams beyond the 
back post, but he seems uncertain whether to head across goal and in, or across 
goal to Tyson, and heads wide of both goal and team-mate. Ever so close, though.

Coppinger on the right, and somehow nobody gets on the end of his cross. Corner.

it looks like he’s going to go all the way, but Taylor, I think, gets his foot 
in the way at the last moment.

Overall, that was not a good advert for the Capital One Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup>. A match characterised 
by a couple of bad tackles, a lot of bad shooting and an avalanche of terrible 
set-pieces is decided by a couple of bad penalties.
 
That Chris Wood penalty was terribly, terribly terrible. With Leeds already 
behind on penalties, he justhad to hit the target. He didn’t.

Smith/Reuters  
Richie Wellens sends Turnbull the wrong way, and for the first time in their 
history Leeds are out in the first round of the League Cup!
 
Byram’s penalty was high. This one was HIGH! Bold and capital. Hapless.
 
Turnbull goes to his right well before the ball is kicked. Forrester goes that 
way anyway, and hits high into the net.
 
Byram aims high to the right, but spears it too high, and it clears the bar by 
a couple of yards!
 
The goalkeeper dives to his right, and Williams sends the ball high to his 
left.
 
Luke Murphy sends his penalty into the roof of the net, with the keeper again 
going the wrong way.
 
Tyson smacks the ball incredibly hard down the middle, and Turnbull dives out 
of the way. Which is just as well, really.
 
Antenucci sends Stuckmann the wrong way and tucks the ball into the bottom 
left corner. Nice.
 
OK, penalties imminent. Leeds to go first.
 
Doncaster practiced penalties yesterday, holding a competition, which Paul 
Dickov won.
 
Given the quality of set pieces over the last two hours of football, this 
could go on for a while.
 
120+1 mins: Doncaster cross from the right, Turnbull catches, runs into 
Bellusci and stays down. Funny as it would be for one of the goalkeepers to 
injure themselves 20 seconds before a penalty shoot-out, he looks fine.
 
120+1 mins: One more minute.

extra man count. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX Shutterstock  
120 mins: Leeds take the best part of a minute over taking a throw-in, and 
then lose possession immediately.
 
119 mins: Penalties are but a minute away. Taylor-Sinclair celebrates by 
whacking a cross beyond everyone and out for a throw.
 
117 mins: Main hares from the halfway line towards the penalty area, and then 
shoots wildly over the bar.
 
116 mins: The corner finds a team-mate in the penalty area! But only because 
the team-mate involved, Chris Wood, gave his marker a shove in the back. Free 
kick.
 
115 mins: Nice work from Murphy on the left, who eventually finds Byram, who 
can’t really do anything, is crowded out and gets a corner.
 
113 mins: Bellusci goes down clutching his leg. And then he gets up again. 
Presumably a bit of cramp. Whatever it was, it can’t beat Bellusci.
 
112 mins: It is raining. 
 
111 mins: Coppinger takes on and beats Murphy rather nicely, but his cross 
goes to nobody in particular.
 
110 mins: Doncaster effortlessly parlay their corner into a Leeds throw-in.
 
109 mins: Forrester crosses from the left, and it might have dipped in at the 
far post had Turnbull not flappedc it wide! Another corner.
 
109 mins: As corners in this game go, that one was pretty magnificent. Still, 
it found only a Leeds head.
 
108 mins: Doncaster attack again, though, and win a corner after Bellusci 
clears a cross.
 
108 mins: A tired pass from Main hands possession to Leeds and ends a 
Doncaster attack. Main only came on in the 101st minute.
 
106 mins: And they’re back under way, for the final time!
 
105+1 mins: Tyson collapses under pressure from Bellusci on the edge of the 
Leeds penalty area, but the referee is not impressed. Moments later, the 
whistle goes to end the first half of extra time. The PA plays Shout by Tears 
for Fears. The words “these are the things I can do without” seem pertinent, as 
this tense but far from terrific encounter just keeps on going.
 
105 mins: Leeds hit the post! Antenucci goes on a lovely run, cutting this way 
and that, but then he holds on to the ball too long, runs out of options, has a 
speculative shot on goal and sees it deflect onto the near post! It bounces out 
rather than in, though, and Doncaster clear.
 
101 mins: Harry Middleston comes off, and Curtis Main comes on.
 
100 mins: Another Leeds corner, again taken short, again comes to nothing. 
Really, this is getting quite aggravating. Useless short corners, useless loopy 
corners, we’ve had all sorts of corners except the good sort.
 
98 mins: After another short corner and a bit of passing around the edge of 
the area, Cooper shoots high for Leeds. If any of these players have a spare 
pair of boots, it’s time to put them on. The ones they’re wearing are useless.
 
97 mins: Now Coppinger slides the ball across the penalty area to Wellens, who 
has to shoot first-time as various Leeds players throw themselves at him, and 
sends the ball high and wide.
 
96 mins: Taylor-Sinclair wins the disappointing shot of the evening award for 
a uselessly skewed right-footer from distance, after a free-kick was tapped 
into his path.
 
95 mins: Leeds have their best chance for an aeon! It falls to Byram, found by 
Antenucci running left to right into the penalty area and shooting back across 
goal, but Stuckmann saves with a strong right arm, the ball flying away to 
safety.
 
92 mins: Leeds win a corner, and waste it. The quality of set pieces has been 
dreadful in this game. There was one good Forrester delivery in the first half, 
but since then nowt.
 
91 mins: Leeds kick off again.
 
90+4 mins: The referee blows his whistle, and we’re going to have another half 
an hour!
 
90+3 mins: And Leeds run down the other end and win a corner of their own! It 
comes to nought as well.
 
90+3 mins: Taylor-Sinclair shoots! Cheeky! And also unsuccessful. Turnbull 
saves.
 
90+2 mins: A free-kick for Doncaster, on the right of the penalty area, after 
a cross is blocked with a hand. What can they do?
 
90+1 mins: Into stoppage time we go, and there will be three minutes of it. At 
least.

90 mins: Coppinger crosses from the right, but by the time the ball reaches 
the middle Andy Williams is on the ground. Didn’t seem much in it, and the 
referee tells him to get up.
 
88 mins: Now Coppinger cuts in from the right and then shoots with his left 
foot across goal and wide. Great pressure from Doncaster, but no goal. Can they 
stop this game going to extra time? Um, please?
 
87 mins: And another chance! Tyson is played through on the right, he blasts 
the ball goalwards and Turnbull pushes out to Forrester, 20 yards out and off 
balance, who shoots high.
 
86 mins: Ooooooooh! A lovely cross from the right finds Williams beyond the 
back post, but he seems uncertain whether to head across goal and in, or across 
goal to Tyson, and heads wide of both goal and team-mate. Ever so close, though.
 
85 mins: Doncaster are throwing men forward – six of them in the penalty area 
as I type – but all they seem to be doing is getting in each other’s way.
 
84 mins: Wellens goes down in midfield, Leeds attack, the home crowd howls. 
Doncaster win the ball back and counter, with Wellens still on the ground. The 
home crowd roars.

82 mins: Which is cleared. Then Forrester shoots low towards the near post, 
but Turnbull gathers.
 
82 mins: Ooooh! A good move from Doncaster ends with Williams finding 
Coppinger on the right, and somehow nobody gets on the end of his cross. Corner.
 
79 mins: Lovely run from Tyson, who slaloms into the penalty area and briefly 
it looks like he’s going to go all the way, but Taylor, I think, gets his foot 
in the way at the last moment.
 
76 mins: A cross from the right towards Chris Wood misses its target, but 
finds McCullough with a handful of yellow shirt. The Leeds fans howl for a 
penalty, but get nothing.
 
75 mins: One more Leeds substitution, Sam Bryam coming on, and Mowatt coming 
off. This match is meandering at the moment, in dire need of a bit of quality 
or a moment of random good fortune.
