Josh Magennis is understood to have made an allegation following his side’s

report of alleged “racial abuse” was received.

Magennis, 25, is in his second season with the Ayrshire club and the striker 
is also a Northern Ireland international.

Hearts <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> said in a statement on 
Saturday evening: “The club can confirm that following this afternoon’s game, a 
complaint was made to Police Scotland by a Kilmarnock player.

“The Kilmarnock player alleges that an abusive comment was made relating to 
his nationality by an individual seated within the home end at Tynecastle.

“The alleged abusive remark related to the player being Irish. The player is 
from Northern Ireland. To clarify, this allegation does not involve the 
player’s colour, religion or sexuality.

“Senior figures from both clubs were present when the player made the 
complaint and discussed the matter fully thereafter.

“Heart of Midlothian FC has a number of players of different nationality 
playing in the current squad and is very proud of the international make-up of 
our team.

“We will fully support any police investigation into reports of abuse such as 
the one which has been reported today.”

racial abuse from today’s match at Tynecastle Stadium, Edinburgh. Inquiries are 
ongoing.”
