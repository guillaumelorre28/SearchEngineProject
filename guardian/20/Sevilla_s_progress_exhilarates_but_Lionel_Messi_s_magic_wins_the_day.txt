Samir Nasri has finished training, his heart monitor laid on the window ledge 
with the others. The scans say he shouldn’t play but he says he will and his 
manager appreciates it. He’s perhaps La Liga’s best midfielder so far; the man 
his coach says makes the team breathe. Steven N’Zonzi, perhaps the second-best, 
ambles by in flip-flops and baggy shorts. Lifesized inflatable footballers lean 
against the fence; actual footballers ride buggies, alighting at the gym. 
Sergio Escudero grins and staff embrace him. News just in: he’s in the Spain 
squad. The groundsman, in cricketer’s shirt and sunhat, takes corners wide on 
his lawnmower. Alongside, a stand is being built; the B team play here and 
they’re second in Segunda, occupying a prohibited promotion place. As for the 
first team, they’re just three points off the top.

Sevilla 1-2 Barcelona: La Liga – as it happened

Friday afternoon at Sevilla’s Ramón Cisneros Palacios training ground with its 
giant billboard showing Jesús Navas and Sergio Ramos holding the World Cup and 
there’s optimism – lots of it. There’s whitewashed walls and it’s lived-in 
enough to feel real, not sterile and sanitised – laundry room in one corner, a 
couple of those pump-up players lie on the floor like casualties, air slowly 
escaping. Yet they’re the only thing about this place that’s deflated. Fourth 
domestically, virtually through in the Champions League, delighted to be denied 
a defence of the Europa League titlethey have won three years running 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/sevilla-liverpool-europa-league-final-basel-party>
, life is good. Sevilla are playing well and winning sooner than expected, the 
sporting director admits. “We thought the adaptation would be slower,” Monchi 
says.

His manager disagrees: “you always have that hope,” he has said. But, then, 
his manager is Jorge Sampaoli, an optimist and enthusiast whose influence is 
felt here, a man who laments footballers becoming “functionaries”, preferring 
them to be “artists”. He wants them to enjoy this. If at first the play wasn’t 
entirely convincing, the ideal remained and the results sustained them; now, 
they have both. They’ve won every home match andeven managed to win away, a 
year later 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/sevilla-get-the-monkey-off-their-back-at-last-but-still-seek-to-find-their-groove>
. They’ve lost just once – at San Mamés – and they beat Atlético Madrid whose 
captain, Gabi, claims they’re candidates for the title. Deep down, Sevilla’s 
players don’t think they are – then again, Gabi didn’t think Atlético were in 
2013-14 – but they are indeed enjoying this.

Defeated at the Etihad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league-match-report>
 without Gerard Piqué and Andres Iniesta, and not at their best, Barcelona are 
next at the Sánchez Pizjuán and some even consider Sevilla favourites. They’ve 
won five out of five and scored 17 there. Since the Super Cup, there’s been 
just one game when they’ve had less of the ball then their opponents – away at 
Juventus – and that was by just 1%. “It’ll be difficult,” the Barcelona manager 
Luis Enrique says. “They’re going to suffer,” Sevilla president José Castro 
says proudly. He invites the cast of Game of Thrones to see it; a game 
approached with anticipation, rather than anxiety. Friday, two days away, and 
there are smiles, chats, warmth, enthusiasm. Why shouldn’t they win?

Here’s why not, one member of the coaching staff confides: “If he has one 
those moments.”

He is Leo Messi. And he does. Asked if he could explain his footballing 
identity a fortnight ago, Sampaoli said: “Yes. Don’t be scared. Don’t wait. 
Think more about their goal than your own. Want the ball. Go for it.” That ball 
is yours: when it’s not, get it back. A five-second limit accelerates that. He 
is totally different to Unai Emery, Nico Pareja admits: attack, always. Don’t 
wait, dominate. There is a word Sampaoli uses a lot which others don’t, 
expressing something about his idea:someter. It doesn’t translate that well, 
but it’s in the vein of conquer, subjugate, impose, subject. He wants his team 
to impose itself on its opponents – to overrun them. His Chile team was perhaps 
the ultimate expression: a stampede, charging forward fearlessly.

When Sunday came, Sevilla did the same. Their first shot came after 34 
seconds, their second after 48. On 1.21, they had their third. Seventeen 
seconds later,Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> had 
their first, breaking through the pressure. It was rare that they did so, the 
waves more often crashing into them. Sevilla stampeded. Escudero volleyed wide. 
Vitolo’s shot was blocked. Then Vitolo scored. 15.02, the clock said. Sevilla 
had gone from one end of the pitch to the other, screeching through the space. 
One-nil and, it seemed, with more to come.

Quicker and quicker they went. Higher, too: cornering Barcelona, often quite 
literally squeezed into the smallest space by the corner flag and the fans – no 
way out. Pablo Sarabia was played in, but tried to lay it off with a backheel. 
Then he had a shot blocked. Vitolo put another one wide. Sevilla tore into 
their opponents. This wassometer, right there. An attack ended with one 
full-back delivering for the other. Sevilla were flying: Mariano, Vitolo, 
Luciano Vietto, Escudero – all of them, in fact. N’Zonzi and Nasri controlled; 
Barcelona, the team once defined by its midfield, didn’t have a midfield: it 
was all they could do to watchSevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> go by, too fast to be stopped. 
It was breathless and brilliant. Samuel Umtiti resisted. The shots racked up: 
seven to two. The ball was theirs, against Barcelona. The lead, too.

And then, with three minutes to go until half-time, Barcelona broke and Messi 
scored – gently, subtly sidefooting past the keeper – and something shifted. 
Something? Everything. Messi, above all. “That was decisive, emotionally,” 
Sampaoli admitted. Suddenly, Messi was everywhere. “We have a plan for 
Barcelona and another for Messi,” the Sevilla manager had said before the game; 
for 40 minutes it was successful, a minute later it was in pieces. Why didn’t 
the plan to stop Messi work, he was asked. “Because sometimes Messi lets you 
stop him and sometimes he doesn’t,” Sampaoli said. “When the game breaks 
[open], he’s unstoppable.”

The game broke open. Space appeared as Sevilla tired, unable to maintain that 
pressure, and Barcelona took control, even if control was never complete and 
the match remained alive until the last. From Neymar’s chance after 92mins, 
Sevilla went racing up the other end and could have equalised, the Pizjuán 
appealing for a penalty and complaining when only three minutes were added. Not 
just the Pizjuán either: everyone bar the shattered players wanted this to go 
on for longer. When the final whistle did go, with the final score 2-1 to the 
visitors, there was delight and relief for Barcelona and a kind of sad 
satisfaction for Sevilla. They had been brilliant even if they had been beaten.

Luis Enrique’s side, meanwhile, had responded superbly, amid the doubts. He 
described the game as “lovely, intrepid, between two teams that take risks”. It 
was also an important one, huge for his side. He insisted that it was a 
“deserved” one, too.

Denis Suárez produced his best performance since returning in the summer, 
passing his way into the match; Neymar ran at Mariano, easing the pressure at 
key moments; Sergio Busquets eventually got back on the ball, slowing the game 
down; Umtiti and Javier Mascherano sped about, putting out fires; Luis Suárez 
scored the winner. And Leo Messi, well, Leo Messi did everything and was 
everywhere.

Sevilla’s coaching staff always knew he might do something like this. They’d 
seen it before, after all. But even they didn’t expect something quite this 
good.

There is a cliche that gets trotted out endlessly when a less well-known 
player does something wonderful:if Messi had scored that we would be banging on 
about it for weeks. It’s not true; in fact, at times it feels like the opposite 
is true: Messi has made the remarkable so routine that it stops being so 
remarkable. It’s just him doing what he does. There’s not much new to say; all 
the good words ran out some time ago.Even swearing won’t do now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/mar/22/leo-messi-barcelona-la-liga-spain>
.

They say you could get a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters and they 
would eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare. Maybe, but you 
could get a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters – God knows, the Spanish 
sports media have tried – and they still wouldn’t come up with much that was 
new to describe Messi. Pep Guardiola was right when he said: “Don’t write about 
him – watch him.” Yet this time was different. Messi scored the goal that 
changed this game – so far, so standard – and then, even by his own standards, 
produced a second half performance that was absurd. Ludicrously good. So good 
as to warrant talking about for once, maybe even writing about. He’d scored one 
and assisted one; but for wasteful finishing, he could have scored three and 
assisted three. One of them, dribbling through a space that wasn’t there, would 
have been among the best two or three goals he has ever scored. If Messi had 
done that, we really would have been banging on about it for weeks. We may well 
go on about this display for weeks anyway. Perhaps even for years.

With the Game of Thrones cast up in the stands, the puns in the papers were 
inevitable: kings, thrones and majesty were all over the place, empires and 
ruling too. Perhaps the most telling was the quote from Lord Varys that made it 
into the media: “A very small man can cast a very large shadow.” Messi is a 
small man, but El País called him “gigantic”. He passed, dribbled, controlled: 
he dominated and defended, deactivated opponents and activated team-mates. He 
cast a shadow over this entire game. A shadow? Light, more like. Usually seen 
playing at his own pace, this time he was hyperactive and he was everywhere. A 
No10, No4, No9, No7 and No8 in one: Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. “He can play 
anywhere,” Luis Suárez said. “Messi ‘Distefanoed’ Sevilla,” AS claimed.

That is some statement. There may be no player who has ever impacted on the 
club game like Alfredo Di Stéfano, the man who was everything. As his team-mate 
Amancio Amaro put it: “He was a defender, a midfielder and a striker. He was a 
fucking robot!” L’Equipe called him “L’Omnipresent”. Helenio Herrera famously 
remarked: “if Pelé was the lead violinist, Di Stéfano was the whole orchestra.”

“Messi is football, football is Messi,” one headline claimed. “I’m not saying 
anything new: Messi is the best player in history,” Vitolo said last night. “No 
one is like Messi,” Luis Enrique insisted. The Sevilla president José Castro 
called him “an extraterrestrial”. Asked to explain the result, he said: “They 
have Messi and we don’t.” Castro looked exhausted – they all did. Yet they had 
been exhilarated too. We all had. “I’m obsessed with people leaving the stadium 
with a smile on their faces, having seen a team play with no inferiority 
complex and no fear against Barcelona,” Sampaoli had said. They saw that. They 
also saw Leo Messi.

Talking points

• Two belting good goals and two men might decide Gus Poyet’s future. Betis 
were beaten 2-0 by Villareal with goals from Roberto Soriano and Trigueros, 
leaving them just two points above the relegation zone and their manager on the 
edge. Last week fans chanted for him to be sacked; this week at least he 
avoided that away at the Madrigal but he is under no illusions. “Having a job 
depends on two people: the person who offers it and the person who takes it,” 
he said. “Not having a job is the same. No one knows what will happen tomorrow, 
or the day after.”

• Carlos Vela’s face said it all. He looked like he had been told a 
particularly good joke just before he went to do the touchline interview and 
seemed to be trying not to crack up all the way through, a huge smile seeking 
to escape, but just about kept under control. Obvious, perhaps, after his Real 
Sociedad side defeated Atlético 2-0, with two penalties, one of them coolly 
finished by him, the other scored by Willian José. And yet it was more 
significant that it might seem. For some time, Vela had disengaged and seemed 
disinterested. His recovery is hugely important for the side. Eusebio seems to 
have reached him in a way that others have not – and, yes, that does mean David 
Moyes in particular, but not only him. Real Sociedad are flying: they’ve won 
every game since the Basque derby in mid-October.

• This is Atletico’s worst start under Diego Simeone. Which seems odd when 
they’ve played better than before. But the explanation might be more simple 
than it seems: the fixtures. They have already been away to Barcelona, Celta, 
Real Sociedad, Sevilla and Celta. Next up, Real Madrid at home.

• Saturday’s afternoon games featured four goals – all of them penalties. The 
most controversial was for Las Palmas, who won 1-0 in the 94th minute after a 
tumble that looked suspiciously dive-y. And Osasuna felt very hard done to as 
well, Alavés getting a doubtful penalty quarter of an hour from the end. But it 
wasn’t all bad. Friday night gave us another 3-2 to start the weekend off and 
Sunday night in Seville was a great way to end it.

• Gareth Bale graces the cover of Marca and AS this morning, after Madrid 
eased their way to a not-always-that-impressive3-0 win over Leganés 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/real-madrid-barcelona-gareth-bale-sevilla-la-liga>
. He is, they say, the new leader of a team that has now gone 28 unbeaten. But 
this week it isRonaldo who has signed a new contract 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/cristiano-ronaldo-signs-new-five-year-real-madrid-contract>
.

• Valencia are the only team in Spain without a clean sheet this season. But 
it’s worse than that: they have now got just one clean sheet in 39 games, 
spread across five different managers. This week, they were beaten 2-1 by Celta 
Vigo thanks to one from John Guidetti and a beauty from Facundo Roncaglia. The 
relegation zone is just one point away.

• Time to start talking about the second division, then?
