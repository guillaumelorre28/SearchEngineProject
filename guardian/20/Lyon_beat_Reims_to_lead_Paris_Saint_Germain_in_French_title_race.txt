Lyon leapfrogged Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> on Sunday with a 4-2 away 
win againstReims that put them ahead of the champions, who had beaten Lille 6-1 
on Saturday, on goal difference.

It took Lyon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> six minutes to 
establish a 2-0 lead with goals from Corentin Tolisso and Alexandre Lacazette. 
An own-goal by Maxime Gonalons allowed Reims back into the game but Clinton 
Njié quickly added a third to restore the two-goal advantage.

That is how it stayed until the final stages when Reims’ Mickaël Tacalfred put 
into his own net before Gaëtan Charbonnier pulled a goal back before the end.

Lyon now have a four goal advantage over PSG but have played a game more.

Yannick Carrasco’s clinical 36th-minute goal set third-placed Monaco on course 
for a 3-0 win at doomed bottom clubLens.

Carrasco finished a powerful run by firing past Rémy Riou and goals from 
Anthony Martial and Bernardo Silva completed the victory which boosted Monaco’s 
push for a Champions League qualifying place after a disappointing draw in 
their previous match against Rennes.

However, St Etienne are only two points behind them after a 1-0 victory over 
Montpellier thanks to Max Gradel’s 20th-minute effort at the Stade 
Geoffroy-Guichard.
