group winners Zenit St Petersburg at home.
 Fans arrive to welcome Neville. 
Valencia are eighth in La Liga and visit ninth-placed Eibar, who are level on 
points, on Sunday.

Neville will live in Valencia from now on and is making learning Spanish his 
priority. His daughters and his wife are to join him at the end of the autumn 
term.
