The Football League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> 
would block QPR's Joey Barton joining one of its clubs on loan.

The 29-year-old is set to serve a 12-match ban after he was sent off on the 
final day of last season at Manchester City and was later found guilty of two 
counts of violent conduct by the Football Association.

Barton has spent pre-season training with the League Two side Fleetwood and 
has now returned to the west London club.

QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> had reportedly hoped to send 
the midfielder out on loan to a Football League club as his ban would be served 
quicker due to the volume of games played.

However, the Football League would oppose any such move and would refuse to 
register him while his ban remains.

The Football League is understood to be uncomfortable with the circumventing 
of the FA punishment and believe it would bring the loan system into disrepute.

QPR would not comment on the matter when contacted.
