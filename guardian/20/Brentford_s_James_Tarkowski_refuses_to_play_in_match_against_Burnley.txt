The statement read: “James Tarkowski will be the subject of internal 
disciplinary action after telling head coach Dean Smith that he did not wish to 
play againstBurnley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> in tonight’s 
Sky Bet Championship match.

“Following discussions with Smith, Tarkowski declared himself unavailable for 
the fixture despite being selected in the starting lineup. As a result of these 
actions, he will be disciplined by the club.

“Any resulting sanction will remain confidential and the club will make no 
further comment on potential punishment.

“Tarkowski has been the subject of transfer bids during the current January 
transfer window but none have matched the club’s valuation of the player. In 
fact, all recent bids have been substantially lower than one that was rejected 
last year.”

Tarkowski, valued at £5m by Brentford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford>, is said to be keen on a move 
back to the north-west and is aware of interest from the Clarets.

He told Get West London on Wednesday: “It’s between the clubs. I can’t decide 
if I’m moving from club to club. It’s up to Brentford to decide where my future 
lies.”
