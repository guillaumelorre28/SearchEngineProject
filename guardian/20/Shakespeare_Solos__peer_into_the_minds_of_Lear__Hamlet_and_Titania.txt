 Watch the trailer for Shakespeare Solos 
How do you make Shakespeare instantly available? One answer is to film star 
actors doing great speeches. The first six videos in the Guardian’sShakespeare 
Solos series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/01/leading-actors-film-new-shakespeare-solos-series-for-the-guardian>
 do just that. What they reveal is how the camera can be an aid, rather than an 
enemy, in revealing the intricate thought processes behind the lines.

 Eileen Atkins as Emilia 
Shakespeare acting today puts comprehension before rhetoric: that’s what 
happens here. One of my favourite scenes showsEileen Atkins sitting at a cafe 
table 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/feb/01/eileen-atkins-as-emilia-in-othello-if-wives-do-fall-shakespeare-solos-video>
 and using Emilia’s night-time words to Desdemona as a way of justifying the 
idea of female retaliation for male adultery. She might be any modern woman 
saying “what’s sauce for the goose” and Atkins, talking to the camera as if it 
were an intimate friend, suggests that Emilia’s “then let them use us well” is 
a feminist wake-up call to errant men.

 Ayesha Dharker as Titania 
That ability to use the camera, especially in microscopic closeup, is seen to 
equally strong effect inAyesha Dharker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/20/ayesha-dharker-i-try-to-talk-directors-out-of-casting-me>
’s rendering of Titania’s “the forgeries of jealousy” speech from A Midsummer 
Night’s Dream. You can do that speech in a variety of ways, either stressing 
its emotional anger or lovingly caressing its beauty. But, as Dharker itemises 
the chaos in nature resulting from her quarrel with Oberon, you see a tear 
slowly falling from her eyes: it is as if she feels a regret for mankind that 
“this same progeny of evils comes from our debate”. Will Dharker still be able 
to cry at will when she plays Titania on stage at Stratford later this month?

The stage gives you the total picture: the camera can process thought. Most 
actors playing King Lear have to shout themselves hoarse to compete with a 
battery of sound-effects during the storm scene.Roger Allam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/12/roger-allam-actor-endeavour-portrait>
, in this version, is up against nothing more than a wisp of dry-ice and allows 
the words to do the work: there is an angry defiance about Allam’s Lear so that 
when he cries: “Spit, fire! Spout, rain!” the plosive consonants evoke the 
chaos of nature. I can’t wait to see Allam play the king on stage.

Adrian Lester <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/adrian-lester> has already 
played Hamlet, for Peter Brook, so he knows his way round the “To be or not to 
be” speech: filmed in soul-searching close-up, Lester even raises his eyebrows 
on “to die – to sleep?” as if asking us the question.

In the case of David Morrissey’s witty rendering of Richard III’s opening 
speech, the camera shifts from profile shots to catch him head-on: this, above 
all speeches, shows a Shakespeare character treating the audience as fellow 
conspirators.

’s Juliet declaring her love for Romeo with guileless fervour. She displays all 
the anxiety of a young girl asking: “Dost thou love me?” and reassuring Romeo 
that she will be eternally true. Vanderham lets you see the mixed emotions 
coursing through Juliet’s brain.

What the six speeches confirm is that Shakespeare perfectly suits the camera, 
as long as you expose the sinews of thought and use the words as a key to the 
mind.
