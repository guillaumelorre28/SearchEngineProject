Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaketh: “We want to face the weakest team but 
it’s very hard to say which is the weakest. But the team we’re going to meet 
won’t be better than Qarabag.”

Qarabag weren’t bad (but did you watch the second leg? What about that pitch?! 
It ran like an ice rink!). Who to fear here? Astana are a very interesting 
proposition, from Kazakhstan, although their win over HJK Helsinki was a 
seat-of-the-pants affair. DoubtCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> would fancy that journey again. 
Logistically, they’d probably quite like last year’s group stage participants 
Malmo.

The draw season starts here!

So it begins. A gruelling, enervating regimen of attritional, overblown 
90-minute watches that ultimately deliver little but broken dreams and a 
nagging sense of awkwardness. With any luck we’ll still have a little energy 
for some football after all that but for now, welcome to the draw for the 
play-off round of this season’s Champions League!

Who can everybody get? Some of my colleagues did the hard work yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/06/champions-league-manchester-united-celtic>
 and looked at the five clubsManchester United could be drawn against. Spoiler 
alert: it’sClub Brugge, CSKA Moscow, Lazio, Monaco or Rapid Vienna.

For Celtic, the situation is different. That’s because they are in the 
Champions Route, which is sectioned off exclusively for league winners. Celtic, 
then, could faceMaccabi Tel Aviv, Partizan Belgrade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/partizanbelgrade>, Malmo, Skenderbeu 
Korce (they’re from Albania) or Astana (which you hopefully already know is in 
Kazakhstan).

Ping your emails in, anyway! Who would you like your boys to get?

First legs to be played on Tues/Weds 18/19 August; second legs to be played on 
Tues/Weds 25/26 August. Enjoy! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/07/manchester-united-to-face-club-brugge-in-champions-league-play-off>
 
Valencia v Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> also looks fun.
 
Rapid Vienna v Shakhtar Donetsk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shakhtardonetsk> is next.
 
Sporting Lisbon v CSKA Moscow <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cskamoscow>
 looks a good tie too.
 
Come on, experts, what do we expect from that?
 
Lazio v Bayer Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>
 is drawn first, thus robbing of us of a Ravel Morrison derby.
 
One thing to note – Shakhtar and CSKA Moscow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cskamoscow> cannot play each other for 
political reasons.
 
Now for the League Route....
 
BATE Borisov v Partizan Belgrade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/partizanbelgrade> gets the Champions 
Route tied up.
 
FC Basel v Maccabi Tel Aviv 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/maccabitelaviv> is the next tie.
 
They won’t mind that, tough game though it is.
 
Skenderbeu v Dinamo Zagreb <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dinamozagreb> 
is next.
 
Astana v APOEL is the first match to be drawn.
 
The Champions Route section of the draw will be made first. Disappointing lack 
of pageantry so far – looks like we’re going right ahead....
 
Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaketh: “We want to face the weakest team but 
it’s very hard to say which is the weakest. But the team we’re going to meet 
won’t be better than Qarabag.”

Qarabag weren’t bad (but did you watch the second leg? What about that pitch?! 
It ran like an ice rink!). Who to fear here? Astana are a very interesting 
proposition, from Kazakhstan, although their win over HJK Helsinki was a 
seat-of-the-pants affair. DoubtCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> would fancy that journey again. 
Logistically, they’d probably quite like last year’s group stage participants 
Malmo.
 
Would you like to see the runners and riders in full? Ok. Remember – the 
‘Champions Route’ and ‘League Route’ sections of the draw are separate, and 
seeds play non-seeds:
