chairman, Lee Power, since their time at Norwich City in the 1990s and 
previously sent players on loan to the club while in charge at Tottenham. 
Sherwood sat alongside Power in the stands on Saturday, while Brendan Rodgers 
and Chris Ramsey were also in attendance.

Power has said that Luke Williams will remain the club’s head coach, although 
Sherwood will “head up all aspects, including transfers, the way we play, the 
formations and the picking of the team”. Sherwood had been linked with the 
managerial vacancy at QPR,since filled by Ian Holloway.

“I’ve got a soft spot for this club. It was a club who developed a lot of 
Tottenham players who have gone on to big-money moves, Ryan Mason and Alex 
Pritchard,” Sherwood said at a press conference on Thursday.

A Morgan Fox own goal opened the scoring in Wiltshire, before Lloyd Jones 
doubled Town’s lead. John Goddard, the former Woking and England C midfielder, 
sealed Swindon’s second win in 11 matches in all competitions four minutes from 
time. Charlton, meanwhile, are now three games without a win under Russell 
Slade.
