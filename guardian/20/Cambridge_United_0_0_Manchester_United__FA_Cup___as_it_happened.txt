Michael Carrick was also interviewed. Truth be told, he wasn’t very 
interesting. Here’s a highlight:

First half was very scrappy, it was tough. Cambridge made it difficult for us. 
Second half we were a lot better, had some chances and on another day we could 
have won.

Richard Money, Cambridge manager, speaks:

I’m extremely proud of every one of them. First half we played well, we 
carried a threat, might have scored from a couple of set plays. And then second 
half it becomes what you’d expect it to be, world class players keeping the 
ball. I thought we defended really well. If we were going to get a result today 
the goalkeeper and the two centre-halves had to be very, very good. And they 
were.

We tried to make sure it didn’t phase them in the tunnel. Once we knew what 
the team was, get your head around who it is. Stick your chest out and then go 
and play. Try and enjoy it, work hard and see what happens. Our organisation is 
normally pretty good so we were confident we could compete when we needed to. 
It was just whether we could take anything that came our way.
 Manager Richard Money congratulates Chris Dunn at the end of the match.

A really entertaining cup tie, that. After a poor first half United had much 
the better of the second, and eventually made a couple of chances. Van Persie 
probably should have scored his, but that moment apart Cambridge defended 
excellently. They didn’t really create much, one first-half corner apart, but 
avoiding defeat was clearly the first priority, and probably the second one 
too, and they did that commendably.

“A draw was a dream result for us, and we’ve got it,” says Ryan Donaldson. 
“We’ll take a draw any day. Look at this, unbelievable. We went to Wembley 
twice last year, and the gaffer’s been saying that this cup run can give us 
those moments again. Not bad, is it?”

Final score: Cambridge United 0-0 Manchester United

90+4 mins: No, but it doesn’t matter! United get the ball and head off on a 
counter-attack that is curtailed by the referee’s whistle – this is going to a 
replay!

84 mins: Donaldson gets the ball on the right, he earns himself half a yard

81 mins: Januzaj has the ball on the left, and after teasing the full-back for

80 mins: Cambridge catch the crossing allergy, despite having the ball in a 
really fine position on the left, and eventually Valencia steals it off 
Chadwick’s toe, and the opportunity has gone.

78 mins: Nearly-a-chance! And nearly another! First, Di Maria gets the ball on 
the byline inside the penalty area, but a Cambridge boot meets his pull-back. 
And then a Cambridge head meets Herrera’s follow-up cross. And then Dunn 
punches Di Maria’s corner clear.

75 mins: Herrera finds Valencia, in plenty of space to cross. He doesn’t, 
instead rolling back to Herrera, now himself in plenty of space to cross. He 
doesn’t either. And by the time Valencia does cross, there’s a defender six 
inches away from him and it deflects out for a throw-in. Puzzling, that.

73 mins: Donaldson, popping up on the left of his own defence, messes up his 
pass, surrendering the ball to Herrera. He slides it to Valencia, who takes a 
heavy touch, and Donaldson seems to give him a push as he runs into the area. 
The United player stays on his feet – is there a “Just be Honest” sign in the 
away dressing-room too? – and Dunn collects the ball.

Persie, running clear, just to the left of goal, who should score! He volleys

69 mins: McGeehan gets booked for a foul on Di Maria. I think he looks quite 
like Coventry-era Stuart Pearce. Either that or Nik Kershaw.

67 mins: It’s raining quite hard now, and windy to boot. Twenty-two minutes to 
play. It’s increasingly clear that Cambridge, who could make more than their 
average annual income in a single afternoon should they take this to a replay, 
could get a result here.

64 mins: Cambridge had an excellent first half, but the visitors are starting 
to show a bit of class now. They still only have once chance to show for it, 
but the prospect of humiliation is perhaps, slowly, receding.

62 mins: Save! Carrick splits the defence with an excellent pass to Falcao, 
who takes one touch and then spears the ball goalwards, but Dunn is out fast, 
spreads himself well and the ball flicks off his boot and over the bar.

59 mins: Cambridge attack down the right and then cross towards the far post. 
Elliott goes for the ball, Valencia stops him, Elliott falls over. They both 
had a fistful of shirt, and the home fans’ roar for a penalty goes unanswered.

57 mins: There’s a fine line between sensibly packing your defence and having 
so many men behind the ball that nobody’s around to win it should it ever be 
cleared. Cambridge are treading that fine line currently, though United aren’t 
showing enough nous to find a way through.

And that’s all from me. Thanks for your time, your emails and your attention. 
Bye!
 
Michael Carrick was also interviewed. Truth be told, he wasn’t very 
interesting. Here’s a highlight:

First half was very scrappy, it was tough. Cambridge made it difficult for us. 
Second half we were a lot better, had some chances and on another day we could 
have won.
 
Richard Money, Cambridge manager, speaks:

I’m extremely proud of every one of them. First half we played well, we 
carried a threat, might have scored from a couple of set plays. And then second 
half it becomes what you’d expect it to be, world class players keeping the 
ball. I thought we defended really well. If we were going to get a result today 
the goalkeeper and the two centre-halves had to be very, very good. And they 
were.

We tried to make sure it didn’t phase them in the tunnel. Once we knew what 
the team was, get your head around who it is. Stick your chest out and then go 
and play. Try and enjoy it, work hard and see what happens. Our organisation is 
normally pretty good so we were confident we could compete when we needed to. 
It was just whether we could take anything that came our way.

A really entertaining cup tie, that. After a poor first half United had much 
the better of the second, and eventually made a couple of chances. Van Persie 
probably should have scored his, but that moment apart Cambridge defended 
excellently. They didn’t really create much, one first-half corner apart, but 
avoiding defeat was clearly the first priority, and probably the second one 
too, and they did that commendably.
 
“A draw was a dream result for us, and we’ve got it,” says Ryan Donaldson. 
“We’ll take a draw any day. Look at this, unbelievable. We went to Wembley 
twice last year, and the gaffer’s been saying that this cup run can give us 
those moments again. Not bad, is it?”
 
90+4 mins: No, but it doesn’t matter! United get the ball and head off on a 
counter-attack that is curtailed by the referee’s whistle – this is going to a 
replay!
 
90+3 mins: There are 20 seconds to play. Cambridge have a throw-in, deep into 
United’s half. Can they conjure a cross?
 
90+2 mins: Panic! Januzaj’s deflected shot is punched by Dunn but it falls to 
Di Maria at the edge of the area. His low, hard shot is also saved, and then 
the ball is hacked clear!

90+1 mins: The fourth official raises his board, and it has the number three 
on it.
 
90 mins: Januzaj’s low cross deflects to Dunn, and the 90 minutes are up (or 
will be in 10 seconds).
 
89 mins: Donaldson horribly overhits the free-kick, and De Gea collects easily.
 
88 mins: The ball rolls loose in midfield. Carrick and McGeehan race for it, 
the Cambridge player wins the race and then falls over. It’s a (somewhat 
generous) free kick.
 
87 mins: Di Maria crosses from the left but just too high for Falcao, who 
beats Taylor but can’t control his header.
 
86 mins: United bring Luke Shaw on, and take Blind off. Meanwhile, here’s a 
delightful picture gallery containing all the very finest images of this here

.
 
85 mins: The ball goes too close to De Gea, who flaps it clearish, not totally 
convincingly.
 
84 mins: Donaldson gets the ball on the right, he earns himself half a yard 
against Blind and then crosses excellently. Jones, I think, concedes a corner.

82 mins: Valencia crosses from the right, and the ever-vigilant Coulson heads 
clear.
 
81 mins: Januzaj has the ball on the left, and after teasing the full-back for 
a while he sends a low cross that screams along the six-yard line and out the 
other side!
 
80 mins: Cambridge catch the crossing allergy, despite having the ball in a 
really fine position on the left, and eventually Valencia steals it off 
Chadwick’s toe, and the opportunity has gone.
 
78 mins: Nearly-a-chance! And nearly another! First, Di Maria gets the ball on 
the byline inside the penalty area, but a Cambridge boot meets his pull-back. 
And then a Cambridge head meets Herrera’s follow-up cross. And then Dunn 
punches Di Maria’s corner clear.
 
76 mins: A substitution, and Cambridge-supporting former United winger Luke 
Chadwick comes on, to replace Hughes.
 
75 mins: Herrera finds Valencia, in plenty of space to cross. He doesn’t, 
instead rolling back to Herrera, now himself in plenty of space to cross. He 
doesn’t either. And by the time Valencia does cross, there’s a defender six 
inches away from him and it deflects out for a throw-in. Puzzling, that.
 
73 mins: Donaldson, popping up on the left of his own defence, messes up his 
pass, surrendering the ball to Herrera. He slides it to Valencia, who takes a 
heavy touch, and Donaldson seems to give him a push as he runs into the area. 
The United player stays on his feet – is there a “Just be Honest” sign in the 
away dressing-room too? – and Dunn collects the ball.
 
71 mins: Big miss! Di Maria chips the ball over the Cambridge defence to Van 
Persie, running clear, just to the left of goal, who should score! He volleys 
over the bar.

70 mins: Jones strides forwards, strides a little bit more forwards, strides a 
little further and then shoots wide.
 
69 mins: McGeehan gets booked for a foul on Di Maria. I think he looks quite 
like Coventry-era Stuart Pearce. Either that or Nik Kershaw.
 
67 mins: It’s raining quite hard now, and windy to boot. Twenty-two minutes to 
play. It’s increasingly clear that Cambridge, who could make more than their 
average annual income in a single afternoon should they take this to a replay, 
could get a result here.
 
67 mins: A double substitution for United, Wilson and Fellaini going off, Van 
Persie and Herrera coming on.
 
66 mins: Blind crosses from the left, Falcao goes for it but decides to leave 
it for Fellaini, just behind him. Fellaini is offside.

65 mins: Wilson gets booked for arriving late to a challenge with Elliott.
 
64 mins: Cambridge had an excellent first half, but the visitors are starting 
to show a bit of class now. They still only have once chance to show for it, 
but the prospect of humiliation is perhaps, slowly, receding.
 
62 mins: Save! Carrick splits the defence with an excellent pass to Falcao, 
who takes one touch and then spears the ball goalwards, but Dunn is out fast, 
spreads himself well and the ball flicks off his boot and over the bar.
 
59 mins: Cambridge attack down the right and then cross towards the far post. 
Elliott goes for the ball, Valencia stops him, Elliott falls over. They both 
had a fistful of shirt, and the home fans’ roar for a penalty goes unanswered.
 
57 mins: There’s a fine line between sensibly packing your defence and having 
so many men behind the ball that nobody’s around to win it should it ever be 
cleared. Cambridge are treading that fine line currently, though United aren’t 
showing enough nous to find a way through.
