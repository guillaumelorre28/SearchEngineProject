Cathro, a former Brechin and Forfar youth player, replaces Robbie Neilson, who 
has joined MK Dons, and his first match in charge will be against Rangers at 
Ibrox on Saturday.

Ann Budge, the Hearts owner and CEO, told the club website: “We are delighted 
to have secured the services of Ian Cathro and are confident he is the ideal 
candidate to take our club forward. He is widely regarded as one of the 
brightest young coaches in the game and has amassed a great deal of experience 
both at home and abroad. He may only be 30 years of age, but we are convinced 
that he has all the tools required to be a successful head coach.”

Cathro became the head of Dundee United’s youth academy at the age of 22 after 
being appointed by the then Tannadice manager, and now Hearts director of 
football, Craig Levein.

In 2012 he was appointed assistant manager at the Portuguese club Rio Ave 
before following the manager Nuno Espírito Santo to the La Liga side Valencia. 
Cathro then joined Newcastle’s coaching staff under Steve McClaren in 2015 and 
was kept on when Rafael Benítez replaced him towards the end of last season.
