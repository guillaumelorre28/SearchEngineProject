Data released by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons found 
thata record number of Brits – 51,000 – went under the knife

last year.

It’s not just women who are altering their appearance. The amount of men, in 
particular, getting cosmetic surgery doubled in the last decade – with the 
number of procedures rising from 2,440 to 4,614.

So why are more men changing the way they look? We asked our male readers to 
share their experiences of cosmetic surgery. Here’s what they told us:

A chest reduction: ‘I felt self-conscious in tight T-shirts’

I had a chest reduction mainly because I lacked confidence in the clothes that 
I’d wear. I had what you might call man boobs and even though the people I 
spoke to said I didn’t need to change anything, I felt really self-conscious. I 
would buy baggy T-shirts and not wear anything that was skin-tight.

I tried the gym for a year and worked out with a personal trainer, but it 
actually made my chest bigger because the muscle behind the tissue pushed it 
out more. Eventually, I had a consultation and then surgery months later.

I arrived in the morning, got ready within an hour, and went into theatre. The 
procedure was quite quick and pain free, the surgeon cut a half circle on the 
bottom of my nipple, removed my breast tissue and then performed liposuction to 
even out the area. After surgery I had to wear a compression vest for six weeks 
and then it was all fine. In fact, the only discomfort I encountered was from 
the vest which caused a lot of itching.

 I used to have a lot of problems going on dates but now, I feel more 
confident meeting people. I recently started a new job and a conversation about 
surgery came up. I said I’d had my chest reduction and I explained why and most 
people were interested and asked questions, but no one really judged me. There 
might still be a way to go in terms of men speaking openly but we are moving in 
the right direction.

A pinnaplasty: ‘My mum used to tape my ears back’

I went to an all-boys school and hated it – I got teased a lot about my ears, 
which stuck out. As a child my mum used to tape them back but of course it 
didn’t make any difference. Growing up, there was never a time when I looked in 
the mirror and wasn’t bothered by my appearance.

I got through it, and didn’t let it stop me having relationships, even though 
I was quite shy around girls, but I always felt that something wasn’t quite 
right. It was as an adult that I decided tp have a pinnaplasty. It was the best 
decision I’ve ever made.

It involved the doctor cutting out cartilage, then removing, reshaping and 
sewing my ears back. I remember hearing the surgeon saying to the nurse, “This 
is my favourite bit” as I heard the thread being pulled and my ear moving back. 
Of course, I couldn’t feel anything because I was under local anaesthetic.

It means that I just don’t think about my ears anymore. The weirdest thing is 
that most people didn’t realise I’d had anything done. In truth, I did it so I 
didn’t have to think about it anymore.


Men are expected to make a bit more effort nowadays, so I can see why surgery 
is on the rise, and we can also be just as insecure as women, but just talk 
about it less, maybe. I got my surgery because it had been something that 
bothered me my whole life, and I am not really in favour of getting something 
done for a temporary fix (like Botox or liposuction).

I can’t help but wonder if fewer men would feel the need to have surgery if 
they talked about things more. I wouldn’t have been able to talk about my ears 
or my surgery before. It took my own training as a therapist to help realise 
that perhaps I didn’t need to have surgery, and could have learned to accept 
myself and the way I was, with more confidence and less heartache. Men 
shouldn’t be ashamed to talk about their insecurities because it can help you 
realise that whatever you’re worried about is really not a big deal.

Liposuction: ‘There’s much more pressure on men these days’

My abdominoplasty and liposuction procedures were part of a quest to get a 
flat stomach that I’d undertaken for a piece with GQ, where I work as digital 
features editor. It followed a lifetime of weight issues that I wanted to put 
paid to (I was 21 stone at my biggest and I’m now just under 14 stone) and, 
before the procedures, I went to the gym eight times a week and overhauled my 
diet for the best part of a year.

I reached a point where my body fat percentage had dropped to 12%, my fitness 
levels were the highest they’d ever been, but no amount of training could get 
me a six-pack because I had loose skin around my abdomen. Chopping it off is 
the only way to get rid of it.

My procedures got mixed reactions. My friends, family and wife were very 
supportive (possibly because they’d suffered with my restrictive diet for so 
long) but there were cynics. A lot of the people I trained with told me that I 
should just hammer cardio workouts and wait for my skin snap back naturally.
My rationale for having work done was part of a broader weight-loss effort, 
but generally speaking there’s a great deal of pressure on men to be in shape 
so it’s not surprising that the number of men having cosmetic procedures has 
increased. We live in a vain age and men aren’t immune to that.

My procedures were relatively low-impact – I was back at work in the afternoon 
after a morning of lipo, so didn’t have to explain any absences. It wasn’t 
particularly painful either: I was under general anaesthetic for the 
abdominoplasty and local anaesthetic for the liposuction. Liposuction involves 
removing fat with a cannula (essentially a long, hollow needle with a hole on 
one side with a another hollow needle inside it connected to a suction device. 
The inner needle moves up and down inside the outer needle, chopping the fat 
from the skin through the hole, then sucking it into a storage tank).

As well as removing fat, lipo scars the inside of the skin. Scar tissue 
shrinks when it heals, so your skin is tightened from the inside.

Abdominoplasty involves removing excess skin from the abdomen (think of it as 
a light tummy tuck). In my case the cut line (and scar) were hidden under the 
waist (just below the top of my boxers) so I can still go swimming and it’s not 
obvious.

There’s still a degree of shame in having a cosmetic procedure. There were 
definitely a few raised eyebrows when I told people what I’d had done. It is 
easier for men to hide it, though – the stats show that most men have sculpting 
work on their upper body, and you can hide things like bulky bandages and 
compression vests under a baggy jumper. Procedures more popular with women 
like, say, breast augmentations or Botox, are a lot more difficult to slip 
under the radar.

However, I have no reservations discussing it, and broadly speaking most men 
reacted positively, if a little surprised. Friends and colleagues have yet to 
follow in my footsteps, though, regardless of their insecurities.
