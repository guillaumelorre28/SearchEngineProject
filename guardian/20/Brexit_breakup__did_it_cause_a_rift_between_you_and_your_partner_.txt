It’s not me, it’s you ... and more specifically your political beliefs. It 
seems that this is a sentiment more Brits can relate to after our decision to 
leave the European Union.

A new survey by the relationship charity, Relate, found a fifth of 300 
relationship support counsellors

 it spoke to had worked with clients who had argued over Brexit.

Gurpreet Singh, a Relate counsellor said: “I’ve seen several clients in 2016 
who have mentioned Brexit in counselling sessions. In some cases Brexit is 
causing anxiety about the future and this is putting pressure on the 
relationship.”

It’s not the first time the impact of this political decision has been linked 
to relationship troubles

. Earlier in the year the UK’s largest family law organisation,Resolution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/09/legal-aid-cuts-no-fault-divorce>
, which represents solicitors and those involved in family law across England 
and Wales said that the stress of Brexit is adding to pressure on couples on 
the brink of divorce.

Nigel Shepherd, the law firm’s chair, said: “We have come across a number of 
families in this country [who are splitting up] because one them voted 
differently [to the other] in the referendum ... They fell out in a big way 
because one voted for remain and one for leave.”

What’s more it can create uncertainty in relationships, with Europeans in 
Britain unsure about whether they will even be allowed to stay in the country 
(or perhaps whether they even want to) post-referendum.


Has your relationship come under strain since Brexit? Did you and your partner 
get divorced because of it? Or has it perhaps made your relationship stronger?
