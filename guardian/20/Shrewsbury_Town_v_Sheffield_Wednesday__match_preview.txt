Shrewsbury are struggling in League One but have already defeated another 
Championship side, Cardiff City, on home soil in the previous round. Micky 
Mellon said of his side’s chances: “It’s all about belief. We’re capable of 
anything, from one extreme to the other.”Sheffield Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldwednesday> will therefore see 
the taming of the Shrews as eminently possible providing they continue their 
impressive cup form this season. The 3-0 defeat of Arsenal in the League Cup 
was a standout display that if replicated will ensure victory for Carlos 
Carvalhal.Graham Searles
