The Brentford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford> midfielder Alan 
Judge has been warned by the Football Association after breaching its 
anti-doping regulations. The Republic of Ireland international suffers from 
asthma and was found with high levels of salbutamol in his system following a 
match in August. He has been warned as to his future conduct, issued with a 
reprimand and will be target tested for the next two years.

A statement on the FA’s website said the Bees’ player of the year “was charged 
after the presence of salbutamol, above the permitted threshold [used via an 
asthma inhaler] was found in his system and considered not to be an intended 
therapeutic use of the substance”.

Judge, who had been ruled out of Euro 2016 after suffering a serious leg break 
while playing for Brentford in April, denied the charge but it was found proven 
following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Wednesday. The 
statement added: “The sanction set by the Regulatory Commission was in 
accordance with the provisions relating to No Significant Fault or Negligence.”

Brentford released a statement clarifying the situation. It read: “Alan has 
suffered from exercise-induced asthma since he was a child and was given 
permission to use the inhaler.

“Following a match last August, Alan’s levels of salbutamol from his inhaler 
use were found to be slightly above the threshold. However, in mitigation, he 
provided a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding this.

“The FA found the case proven due to the level of salbutamol but acknowledged 
Alan’s strong arguments in mitigation by issuing a decision which confirmed 
that he demonstrated ‘no significant fault or negligence’. The club will not be 
making any further comment.”PA
