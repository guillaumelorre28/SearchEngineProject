Thomas Müller scored twice, including a spectacular 71st-minute bicycle kick, 
in Bayern Munich’s 3-1 comeback win over Darmstadt which enables theBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> leaders to move 11 
points clear at the top of the table.

Müller scored both goals in the second half as Bayern, who face Italy’s 
Juventus in the Champions League last 16 next week, were made to work hard 
against the promoted club.

Bundesliga top scorer, Robert Lewandowski, completed Bayern’s turnaround in 
the 84th minute with his 22nd goal of the campaign.

“I am satisfied because we were patient,” Bayern’s coach, Pep Guardiola, said. 
“We had 36 shots on goal but it is difficult against so many defenders.

“I am also happy Franck Ribéry is back from injury even if it is not yet 
enough for 90 minutes. From tomorrow, we are focusing on the Champions League.”

The hosts twice came close through Lewandowski in a one-sided start with 
Bayern pressing for an early goal andDarmstadt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/darmstadt> forced to defend desperately.

Arturo Vidal had a shot tipped over the bar and Arjen Robben failed to score 
when he went through one-on-one against the goalkeeper.

The hosts were punished for their profligacy when Darmstadt’s Sandro Wagner 
beat central defender Serdar Tasci at the near post to head in a cross and 
silence the 75,000 home supporters.

Bayern, however, kept up the pressure and Douglas Costa rattled the bar before 
it finally paid off with Müller chesting a ball down and slotting in.

Müller topped that with an even better effort, again controlling the ball with 
his chest in the box and scoring with an acrobatic bicycle kick for his 17th 
Bundesliga goal this season.

Lewandowski tapped in from close range from a Ribéry pass with the Frenchman 
coming on as a second-half substitute for his first appearance since December.

Bayern are on 59 points with second-placed Borussia Dortmund, on 48, facing 
Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday.
