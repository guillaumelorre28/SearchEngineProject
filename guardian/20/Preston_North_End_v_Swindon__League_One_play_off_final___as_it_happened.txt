Congratulations to Preston, they were by far the better team today, despite 
the fact that they only had around a third of the possession. Preston were 
definitely the third best team inLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> – they finished 10 
points clear of Swindon in fourth – and they fully deserve to go up.

Beckford was superb, terrorising Swindon’s back three with his pace and 
strength.

“Are you staying at Preston?” he is asked after the match. “We’ll see,” he 
replies, with the match ball in his hand.

Not exactly the strongest of replies there from Beckford. With that in mind, 
how many of that Swindon’s team will depart over the summer? You’d certainly 
think Luongo has played his last match for the Wiltshire club.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails. Tune in for the Championship play-off 
final tomorrow. Bye!

substitutions. Effectively have to play with 10 men for the rest of the game. 
Three minutes added for injury time. Preston are nearly there!

83 min: Another save from Johnstone, and it’s another cracker. Obika rises 
highest and gets the faintest of touches on an inswinging cross. It looks for 
all the world like it’s going to creep in the corner, but Johnstone somehow 
claws it out.

Johnson, he’s had a solid match for Preston.

77 min: Another chance for Davies! Johnson crosses to the back post, Garner 
heads back across goal, and Davies only needs to tap it in… no! He can’t quite 
stretch far enough, those hamstrings aren’t what they used to be.

hurls himself towards the ball to take the sting off the shot. Preston’s 
centre-back has had a super game, and he’s got his goal.

69 min: This tug-of-war is just getting started, it is five boys strong now. 
Eventually, a big tattooed man in a full Adidas tracksuit gets off his seat, 
wrestles the shirt of the boys and gives it to his wife. It’s unclear if man 
and wife had anything to do with the boys. Either way, daylight robbery!

68 min: Beckford dances his way round three, four challenges and wins a cheap 
throw-in. He’s been outstanding today, and is roundly cheered by the Preston 
fans. It looks as though he’s got a knock though, and he goes down. Kevin 
Davies is coming on! Beckford goes off to a standing ovation – obviously. He 
gives his shirt to a young lad in the crowd and an almighty tug-of-war 
commences between the young boy and an adversary.

67 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> make another 
change. Toffolo off, Williams on. Williams has scored 22 goals in all 
competitions this year, but Obika was preferred today, perhaps because of his 
fantastic impact in the semi-final v Sheffield United.

produce enough power on the header to trouble Johnstone, who makes a Hollywood

62 min: Penalty shout for Swindon. Bryne steals a march on Woods as he 
attempts to latch onto a diagonal ball and as the ball bounces, it strikes 
Woods on the arm inside the area. Woods didn’t know much about that, but his 
touch did prevent Byrne controlling the ball. Probably a penalty. Sub forSwindon

59 min: Garner battles to win Preston a corner, and he celebrates in front of 
the Preston faithful behind the goal to the left as though he’s just scored in

Kasim, perhaps suffering a serious bout of head-loss, sells Toffolo short and 
Garner pounces on the loose ball, sending Beckford through on goal once more. 
In contrast to the chance he missed six minutes ago, the striker is more 
composed and the outcome is different, cooly sliding the ball into the far 
corner as Foderingham advanced. Hat-trick for Beckford, the Championship for 
Preston!

53 min: Kasim is booked. He came through the back of Garner next to the corner 
flag, and when the ref blew for the foul, gave Garner a little kick on the 
ground. He’s having to be calmed down by his team-mates, his emotions are 
getting the better of him.

50 min: Great save from Foderingham! Beckford fluffs his chance to put this 
game to bed, and nab himself a hat-trick in the process, after being sent clean 
through by Garner. Beckford had space and time to steady himself and pick his 
spot, but he took his shot early, and Foderingham dives well to his right to 
turn it behind.

47 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> free-kick and 
Kasim is over the ball. It’s hit far too deep, and the ball trickles out for a 
goal kick. Cooper holds his hands up on the touchline as if to say, ‘what was 
that?’

46 min: This is the biggest half-time lead that there has ever been in a 
play-off final at any level. Quite the task for Swindon, but you sense that 
it’s not quite done yet.Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon>

Half-time: Preston 3-0 Swindon

Let’s hope Cooper claps some sense into his Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> players this half-time. They 
have most of the ball but, save for that Smith chance, not troubled Preston’s 
goal whatsoever.

45+1 min: Sky’s co-commentator, I’m not sure who it is, just ruined a lovely 
moment. He just described this game as “Preston’s La Decima” which is a bit of 
a stretch, but quite a nice idea – this is their tenth play-off appearance. 
Then he said “Johnstone and Johnson, they’re cleaning up aren’t they.” Urgh.

Garner wins a flick-on from another long Preston ball – he has quite the leap 
on him, doesn’t he? – and Beckford runs onto it. He twists and turns on the 
edge of the box, throwing a Cruyff turn in there for good measure, and curls a 
delightful shot into the far corner with his weaker left foot, before running 
straight into the arms of a delirious Grayson.Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> could have been 2-1 down if 
Smith had converted his chance, now they’re 3-0 down. Are Preston out of sight?

43 min: Golden chance for Smith! HOW HAS HE MISSED THAT? Bryne gets half a 
yard on the right and delivers a delicious cross to the back post. Smith 
outmuscles Wright but plants his header wide from two yards out. It was easier 
to score!

38 min: Gallagher, who received some treatment for a knock about 10 minutes 
ago, is not going to be able to continue. He is replaced by Browne and trudges 
off, littering the pitch with his sock tape in frustration. He’s not happy, but 
obviously not fit to continue.

28 min: Woods chops down Bryne, coming right through the back of Swindon’s 
right wing-back. That’s a yellow card all day long … no! Andrew Madley just has 
a word. Very lenient.

26 min: Gallacher goes down in a heap and there is a break in play as he 
receives treatment.

“I was thinking of going to this match,” emails Mark Judd, “travel chaos 
permitting, then my brother-in-law, a lifelong PNE fan, informed me what it was 
costing him to go from Preston: £25 for the coach, £52 for the match ticket, 
£2.50 for ticket admin fee, £6.50 to send the ticket to his home. So that is 
£86 before he even buys a programme, pint and pie. Still, having just seen PNE 
score within the 3rd minute I guessing he doesn’t care about the cost.”

Correct.

23 min: Stephens steps out with the ball and dribbles into space. The seas 
part, and the defender does a nifty stepover (!!!) to beat Welsh and unleashes 
a shot. Deflected over. Nice run though, that boy can play.

21 min: Preston have a very simple gameplan, it seems. Sit deep, soak up 
pressure, win the ball, hit it long to Beckford, who has got the legs on 
Stephens and Ricketts. It’s working.

19 min: Bryne wins a corner down the right. They’ll be aiming for 6ft4in 
striker Michael Smith, who looks and plays not too dissimilarly like Fulham’s 
Matt Smith by the way. He’s like a lightning rod in that penalty area. 
Johnstone punches clear, nothing doing.

16 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> have had 70% 
possession but they haven’t been in the game at all. They’ve got such a young 
team out today, have they perhaps been overawed by the occasion?

14 min: Mark Cooper looks absolutely shellshocked. He is just clapping. 
Pointlessly clapping. It’s unclear why.

Swindon just haven’t learned their lesson from the first goal: they are able 
to clear a Gallagher corner, but cannot prevent the former Blackburn man 
crossing for a second time, and centre-back Huntington ghosts in completely 
unmarked to tap in from five yards out! 2-0!

8 min: Beckford comes deep and gives the ball away. For all his danger in the 
penalty boxes, his link up play often does leave a lot to be desired, which is 
perhaps why he didn’t cut it higher up the leagues.

Still, he did do this in the play-off semi-final...

4 min: Thompson, who was attempting to mark Beckford, hasn’t got up. He’s 
really struggling here, and they’re calling for a stretcher. Replays show that 
Thompson’s knee buckled as he was grappling with Beckford, and then he fell 
awkwardly. He stretchered off, head in hands, not nice to see. We wish him 
well, he has only just returned from injury. The veteran defender Sam Ricketts, 
formerly of Hull and Bolton, comes on in his place. He’s nine years older than 
any otherSwindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> player out on 
the pitch!

Gallagher swings in the free kick from the left, and frankly, it is shocking 
defending at the back post: Thompson gets completely the wrong side of 
Beckford, who is able to simply sweep a volley into the back of the net from 
three yards out. Foderingham no chance! Wembley erupts! The Preston lot are 
going, unsurprisingly, potty.

2 min: Beckford stretches his legs for the first time, and outpaces Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> captain Nathan Thompson. 
Beckford is tripped, but the referee doesn’t book Thompson. He well might have, 
that was a dangerous Preston counter-attack. Free kick to Preston...

Preamble

Hello world! Welcome to the League One play-off final at Wembley, which is 
effectively a shoot-out between two teams that just love to cock it up.Preston 
North End <https://www.theguardian.com/football/preston> and Swindon both have 
absolutely abysmal records in the play-offs: Preston have failed to gain 
promotion in all nine attempts – a Football League record – whilst Swindon 
don’t fare much better, losing in 2004, 2010 and 2013. A case of the 
nosebleeds, white-line fever, whatever you want to call it, both have exhibited 
outstanding levels of ineptitude in post-seasons of the past.

Swindon oh-so-nearly messed it up this time too, racing into a seemingly 
comfortable 5-1 aggregate lead over Sheffield United in their play-off 
semi-final second leg, before channelling theSwindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> of play-offs past and 
capitulating. They scraped through 7-6 to book their place at Wembley today.

Preston can take heart from the fact that they came through their semi-final 
with Chesterfield with relative ease, winning 4-0 on aggregate, and they now 
have a manger, Simon Grayson, who is a bonafide expert of getting teams out of 
League One: the 45-year-old has done it with Blackpool, Leeds and Huddersfield.

And so it’s all set up: two teams slugging it out for a place in the Best 
League in the World™, which is the Championship for all of you that don’t know. 
The two seem evenly matched, with both beating each other in the league this 
season. Get ready for a thrilling 0-0 (34-33 on penalties) victory. Who will 
(again) lose their bottle? Who will hit the canvas first?

Find out at: 5.30pm BST

Congratulations to Preston, they were by far the better team today, despite 
the fact that they only had around a third of the possession. Preston were 
definitely the third best team inLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> – they finished 10 
points clear of Swindon in fourth – and they fully deserve to go up.

Beckford was superb, terrorising Swindon’s back three with his pace and 
strength.

“Are you staying at Preston?” he is asked after the match. “We’ll see,” he 
replies, with the match ball in his hand.

Not exactly the strongest of replies there from Beckford. With that in mind, 
how many of that Swindon’s team will depart over the summer? You’d certainly 
think Luongo has played his last match for the Wiltshire club.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails. Tune in for the Championship play-off 
final tomorrow. Bye!

90+2 min: Preston’s bench are hugging each other. Big man love going on right 
now. Paul Gallagher is crying.
 
90 min: Kasim is struggling with an injury, but Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> have made all of their 
substitutions. Effectively have to play with 10 men for the rest of the game. 
Three minutes added for injury time. Preston are nearly there!
 
88 min: David Moyes is at Wembley today to cheer Preston on. He was manager 
there from 1998-2002 remember.
 
85 min: Some of the Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> 
fans are leaving, and Preston’s supporters gleefully wave them off. Cheerio!
 
83 min: Another save from Johnstone, and it’s another cracker. Obika rises 
highest and gets the faintest of touches on an inswinging cross. It looks for 
all the world like it’s going to creep in the corner, but Johnstone somehow 
claws it out.
 
82 min: Johnstone makes his first meaningful save, beating away a swerving 
shot from Gladwin, who had hit it from 25 yards out. Laird comes on for 
Johnson, he’s had a solid match for Preston.
 
80 min: The tempo has dropped. It’s a big pitch at Wembley, and both side are 
showing signs of fatigue.

<https://twitter.com/SkyBetLeague1/status/602536833935880192>  
77 min: Another chance for Davies! Johnson crosses to the back post, Garner 
heads back across goal, and Davies only needs to tap it in… no! He can’t quite 
stretch far enough, those hamstrings aren’t what they used to be.
 
75 min: Thompson cuts in from the right, jinks inside Woods but Huntington 
hurls himself towards the ball to take the sting off the shot. Preston’s 
centre-back has had a super game, and he’s got his goal.
 
72 min: Free-kick to Preston, kick it at Kevin Davies, he played at the old 
Wembley, don’t you know. They do just that, but Davies nods wide.
 
69 min: This tug-of-war is just getting started, it is five boys strong now. 
Eventually, a big tattooed man in a full Adidas tracksuit gets off his seat, 
wrestles the shirt of the boys and gives it to his wife. It’s unclear if man 
and wife had anything to do with the boys. Either way, daylight robbery!
 
68 min: Beckford dances his way round three, four challenges and wins a cheap 
throw-in. He’s been outstanding today, and is roundly cheered by the Preston 
fans. It looks as though he’s got a knock though, and he goes down. Kevin 
Davies is coming on! Beckford goes off to a standing ovation – obviously. He 
gives his shirt to a young lad in the crowd and an almighty tug-of-war 
commences between the young boy and an adversary.
 
67 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> make another 
change. Toffolo off, Williams on. Williams has scored 22 goals in all 
competitions this year, but Obika was preferred today, perhaps because of his 
fantastic impact in the semi-final v Sheffield United.
 
65 min: First chance for Obika. He beats Huntington to a cross, but can’t 
produce enough power on the header to trouble Johnstone, who makes a Hollywood 
save for the cameras.
 
62 min: Penalty shout for Swindon. Bryne steals a march on Woods as he 
attempts to latch onto a diagonal ball and as the ball bounces, it strikes 
Woods on the arm inside the area. Woods didn’t know much about that, but his 
touch did prevent Byrne controlling the ball. Probably a penalty. Sub forSwindon
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon>, Gladwin off, Louis Thompson on.
 
59 min: Garner battles to win Preston a corner, and he celebrates in front of 
the Preston faithful behind the goal to the left as though he’s just scored in 
the World Cup final. The party has started in the stands – Mark Judd, I hope 
you find something nice to buy with that £86 you’ve got in your pocket.
 
Kasim, perhaps suffering a serious bout of head-loss, sells Toffolo short and 
Garner pounces on the loose ball, sending Beckford through on goal once more. 
In contrast to the chance he missed six minutes ago, the striker is more 
composed and the outcome is different, cooly sliding the ball into the far 
corner as Foderingham advanced. Hat-trick for Beckford, the Championship for 
Preston!

That’s that then.

53 min: Kasim is booked. He came through the back of Garner next to the corner 
flag, and when the ref blew for the foul, gave Garner a little kick on the 
ground. He’s having to be calmed down by his team-mates, his emotions are 
getting the better of him.
 
50 min: Great save from Foderingham! Beckford fluffs his chance to put this 
game to bed, and nab himself a hat-trick in the process, after being sent clean 
through by Garner. Beckford had space and time to steady himself and pick his 
spot, but he took his shot early, and Foderingham dives well to his right to 
turn it behind.
 
47 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> free-kick and 
Kasim is over the ball. It’s hit far too deep, and the ball trickles out for a 
goal kick. Cooper holds his hands up on the touchline as if to say, ‘what was 
that?’
 
46 min: This is the biggest half-time lead that there has ever been in a 
play-off final at any level. Quite the task for Swindon, but you sense that 
it’s not quite done yet.Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> 
need an early goal.
 
Peeep Peeeep! We’re off again.
 
Preston’s dressing room right now....
 
Let’s hope Cooper claps some sense into his Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> players this half-time. They 
have most of the ball but, save for that Smith chance, not troubled Preston’s 
goal whatsoever.
 
45+1 min: Sky’s co-commentator, I’m not sure who it is, just ruined a lovely 
moment. He just described this game as “Preston’s La Decima” which is a bit of 
a stretch, but quite a nice idea – this is their tenth play-off appearance. 
Then he said “Johnstone and Johnson, they’re cleaning up aren’t they.” Urgh.
 
Garner wins a flick-on from another long Preston ball – he has quite the leap 
on him, doesn’t he? – and Beckford runs onto it. He twists and turns on the 
edge of the box, throwing a Cruyff turn in there for good measure, and curls a 
delightful shot into the far corner with his weaker left foot, before running 
straight into the arms of a delirious Grayson.Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> could have been 2-1 down if 
Smith had converted his chance, now they’re 3-0 down. Are Preston out of sight?
 
WHAT. A. GOAL.
 Pick that one out the old onion bag. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA  
43 min: Golden chance for Smith! HOW HAS HE MISSED THAT? Bryne gets half a 
yard on the right and delivers a delicious cross to the back post. Smith 
outmuscles Wright but plants his header wide from two yards out. It was easier 
to score!
 
42 min: Free-kick to Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> 
and a chance to pack Preston’s box. This nice tiki-taka stuff isn’t working. 
Hoof it in! Headed away by Wright.
 
40 min: Can I just say, isn’t Preston’s kit lovely?
 Paul Huntington celebrates with Jermaine Beckford after scoring Preston’s 
second goal. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA  
38 min: Gallagher, who received some treatment for a knock about 10 minutes 
ago, is not going to be able to continue. He is replaced by Browne and trudges 
off, littering the pitch with his sock tape in frustration. He’s not happy, but 
obviously not fit to continue.
 
36 min: Again, it’s a very dangerous delivery, with Foderingham flapping in 
no-man’s land but captain Clarke is ruled offside at the back post. TheSwindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> marking has been shocking so far 
though!
 
35 min: Beckford wins a free kick with Stephens nibbling him from behind. Not 
literally. He gave him a kick. Free kick to Preston. Remember what happened 
last time?
 
33 min: Gladwin skips away from Kilkenny and delivers a cross but Johnstone 
claims. Isn’t it nice when a goalkeeper catches the ball?
 
30 min: Kilkenny kits another long diagonal towards Beckford, and for a 
moment, Swindon look exposed again. Beckford is adjudged to have fouled 
Ricketts butSwindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> need to be 
wary of that threat.
 
28 min: Woods chops down Bryne, coming right through the back of Swindon’s 
right wing-back. That’s a yellow card all day long … no! Andrew Madley just has 
a word. Very lenient.
 
26 min: Gallacher goes down in a heap and there is a break in play as he 
receives treatment.

“I was thinking of going to this match,” emails Mark Judd, “travel chaos 
permitting, then my brother-in-law, a lifelong PNE fan, informed me what it was 
costing him to go from Preston: £25 for the coach, £52 for the match ticket, 
£2.50 for ticket admin fee, £6.50 to send the ticket to his home. So that is 
£86 before he even buys a programme, pint and pie. Still, having just seen PNE 
score within the 3rd minute I guessing he doesn’t care about the cost.”

Correct.
 
23 min: Stephens steps out with the ball and dribbles into space. The seas 
part, and the defender does a nifty stepover (!!!) to beat Welsh and unleashes 
a shot. Deflected over. Nice run though, that boy can play.
 
21 min: Preston have a very simple gameplan, it seems. Sit deep, soak up 
pressure, win the ball, hit it long to Beckford, who has got the legs on 
Stephens and Ricketts. It’s working.
 
19 min: Bryne wins a corner down the right. They’ll be aiming for 6ft4in 
striker Michael Smith, who looks and plays not too dissimilarly like Fulham’s 
Matt Smith by the way. He’s like a lightning rod in that penalty area. 
Johnstone punches clear, nothing doing.
 
16 min: Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> have had 70% 
possession but they haven’t been in the game at all. They’ve got such a young 
team out today, have they perhaps been overawed by the occasion?
 
14 min: Mark Cooper looks absolutely shellshocked. He is just clapping. 
Pointlessly clapping. It’s unclear why.
 
Swindon just haven’t learned their lesson from the first goal: they are able 
to clear a Gallagher corner, but cannot prevent the former Blackburn man 
crossing for a second time, and centre-back Huntington ghosts in completely 
unmarked to tap in from five yards out! 2-0!
 
Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> are sinking without 
trace (Football Manager reference there for you).
 
8 min: Beckford comes deep and gives the ball away. For all his danger in the 
penalty boxes, his link up play often does leave a lot to be desired, which is 
perhaps why he didn’t cut it higher up the leagues.

Still, he did do this in the play-off semi-final...
 
6 min: Swindon are being in danger of overrun, and Ricketts’s first task is to 
track Gallagher, who is released down the left by Garner. Gallagher drives to 
the byline, but selfishly chooses to shoot. There were three bodies waiting for 
a cut back there.Swindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> clear.
 
4 min: Thompson, who was attempting to mark Beckford, hasn’t got up. He’s 
really struggling here, and they’re calling for a stretcher. Replays show that 
Thompson’s knee buckled as he was grappling with Beckford, and then he fell 
awkwardly. He stretchered off, head in hands, not nice to see. We wish him 
well, he has only just returned from injury. The veteran defender Sam Ricketts, 
formerly of Hull and Bolton, comes on in his place. He’s nine years older than 
any otherSwindon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> player out on 
the pitch!
 Swindon Town’s Nathan Thompson is checked on by the medic before being 
stretchered off. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA  
Gallagher swings in the free kick from the left, and frankly, it is shocking 
defending at the back post: Thompson gets completely the wrong side of 
Beckford, who is able to simply sweep a volley into the back of the net from 
three yards out. Foderingham no chance! Wembley erupts! The Preston lot are 
going, unsurprisingly, potty.

What a start!
 
2 min: Beckford stretches his legs for the first time, and outpaces Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> captain Nathan Thompson. 
Beckford is tripped, but the referee doesn’t book Thompson. He well might have, 
that was a dangerous Preston counter-attack. Free kick to Preston...
 
Peeeeep peeeep! And we’re off!

Hello world! Welcome to the League One play-off final at Wembley, which is 
effectively a shoot-out between two teams that just love to cock it up.Preston 
North End <https://www.theguardian.com/football/preston> and Swindon both have 
absolutely abysmal records in the play-offs: Preston have failed to gain 
promotion in all nine attempts – a Football League record – whilst Swindon 
don’t fare much better, losing in 2004, 2010 and 2013. A case of the 
nosebleeds, white-line fever, whatever you want to call it, both have exhibited 
outstanding levels of ineptitude in post-seasons of the past.

Swindon oh-so-nearly messed it up this time too, racing into a seemingly 
comfortable 5-1 aggregate lead over Sheffield United in their play-off 
semi-final second leg, before channelling theSwindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> of play-offs past and 
capitulating. They scraped through 7-6 to book their place at Wembley today.

Preston can take heart from the fact that they came through their semi-final 
with Chesterfield with relative ease, winning 4-0 on aggregate, and they now 
have a manger, Simon Grayson, who is a bonafide expert of getting teams out of 
League One: the 45-year-old has done it with Blackpool, Leeds and Huddersfield.

And so it’s all set up: two teams slugging it out for a place in the Best 
League in the World™, which is the Championship for all of you that don’t know. 
The two seem evenly matched, with both beating each other in the league this 
season. Get ready for a thrilling 0-0 (34-33 on penalties) victory. Who will 
(again) lose their bottle? Who will hit the canvas first?
