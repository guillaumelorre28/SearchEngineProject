You quote Tidal Lagoon Power <http://www.tidallagoonpower.com>, the company 
led by Mark Shorrock, as saying both “judge us on our record to date” and “no 
decisions have been taken” to source materials from Cornwall (Cornish up in 
arms over Swansea’s tidal power project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/31/worlds-first-tidal-lagoon-clean-energy-scheme-environmental-concerns>
, 1 June). Earlier this year Mr Shorrock visited Cornwall to “explain” that his 
company was applying for planning permission (since granted) to reopenDean 
quarry <http://deanquarry.com>, as a “super-quarry”, extracting 1.5m tonnes a 
year (compared with 0.2m tonnes when last in production), in order to supply 
the stone required for Swansea. How does Mr Shorrock reconcile his actions with 
his company’s statement that “no decisions have been taken”?

Furthermore, as a “green” advocate, how does he justify the threat to a newly 
established marine conservation zone by his proposal to build a 535 metre 
breakwater and jetty into the sea so close tothe Manacles and Lowland Point 
<http://www.coverack.org.uk/Boards08/Lowland%20Point%20walk%20handout.pdf>, an 
area of outstanding natural beauty? This ancient site is owned by the National 
Trust 
<https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lizard-point-and-kynance-cove/things-to-see-and-do/beaches/>
, whose admirable recent effort to protect the north Wales coast by purchasing 
a stretch of the Great Orme shows how effective a guardian it can be.
