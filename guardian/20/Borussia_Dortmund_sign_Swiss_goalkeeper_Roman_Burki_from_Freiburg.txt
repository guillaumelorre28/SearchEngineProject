Borussia Dortmund <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> have 
signed the Switzerland goalkeeper Roman Burki from relegated Freiburg.

Dortmund said the 24-year-old Burki “was one of the most reliable goalkeepers 
in theBundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> last 
season.”

Bürki, who has made two appearances for Switzerland, played all 34 of 
Freiburg’s Bundesliga games last season but could not prevent the club’s 
relegation on the final day.

Dortmund did not disclose the length of Burki’s contract or the transfer fee. 
He joins the established goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller and Mitch Langerak at 
Dortmund. His arrival calls Weidenfeller’s future into question with only one 
year remaining on the 34-year-old’s contract.

Burki is the club’s third summer signing, coming after the recruitment of 
Julian Weigl from 1860 Munich and Gonzalo Castro from Bayer Leverkeusen. Thomas 
Tuchel has taken over from Jürgen Klopp as the club’s manager.
