, the former Hibernian, Kilmarnock and Finland manager could not turn things 
around for the club where he played as a striker for five years.

“I would like to thank the players, staff and supporters,” Paatelainen said. 
“It has been a difficult winter and the challenge was huge but nevertheless I 
have enjoyed every day working for the club and with this group of players.”

A short statement on the Terrors’ website confirmed his departure, with the 
club now beginning the process of finding a replacement.

“Dundee United Football Club and Mixu Paatelainen have agreed the departure of 
Paatelainen as first team head coach with immediate effect,” it read. “The club 
thanks Mixu for his service and will now begin the search for a new head coach.”

The Raith Rovers manager Ray McKinnon has already been linked with the 
position but the Championship club are keen to keep the former United 
midfielder in charge as they go in search of promotion.

Eric Drysdale, a director at Rovers, said: “We have not had any contact from 
Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> or any other 
club regarding Ray McKinnon.

“And should any be forthcoming it would be extremely unwelcome. Ray and the 
team are fully concentrated on the play-off matches against Hibernian and 
nothing will distract them from this.”
