The comedian Shappi Khorsandi has withdrawn her novel from the longlist for a 
new British book prize exclusively for writers of colour because she “felt like 
my skin colour was up for an award rather than my book”.

The 12-book longlist for the inaugural Jhalak prize was announced on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/05/first-british-books-prize-for-bame-authors-unveils-inaugural-longlist>
. The prize was established to recognise excellence among British black, Asian 
and minority ethnic (BAME) writers and inspire publishers within the industry 
to “look beyond the present narrow margins”.

Longlisted authors include the former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman for 
her young adult novelChasing the Stars

 and the historian David Olusoga forBlack and British: A Forgotten History

.

Sunny Singh, the co-founder of the prize and chair of judges, said the 
longlist demonstrated “the strength, range and promise being produced by 
writers of colour in the UK today”.

On Twitter, Khorsandi, who was listed for her first novel Nina is Not OK, said 
that while she was “massively flattered”, she was withdrawing the book “because 
my novel is nothing to do with ethnic identity”.

Singh told the Bookseller she was disappointed by Khorsandi’s decision but 
respected it.

“The Jhalak longlist was compiled with much enthusiasm, love and respect for 
the extraordinary quality and range of work that was submitted,” she said. “The 
judges believe that each of the books on the longlist is there on literary 
merit and deserves as wide a readership as possible.”

Khorsandi’s publisher, Ebury, which submitted the book for the prize, said: 
“Shappi’s decision to withdraw from the longlist is a personal one, which we 
totally respect.”

Khorsandi, who is British and was born in Iran, wrote a memoir, A Beginner’s 
Guide to Acting English, in 2009. Nina is Not OK follows a 17-year-old who 
struggles to recall what happened to her during a night out with friends.

In one passage, she describes herself as “not ugly, I’m alright looking. My 
dad was half Moroccan so I’ve got olive skin and big Arab eyes, but my mum’s 
thin English lips and my Auntie Geanie’s ski-slope nose. On a good day, I’m 
Pocahontas. On a bad day – on most days – I’m a cave woman.”


The author and actor Richard E Grant praised Khorsandi’s novel as 
“unexpectedly moving, emotional and funny”.
