Now Stokes has returned to Easter Road in search of first-team football, 
having appeared forCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> only 
twice this season.

Alan Stubbs said: “Anthony is a fantastic footballer and will really 
strengthen the squad. We have a number of options in attack and real 
competition for places which is what every manager wants.” The Hibs manager 
added: “We are excited about Anthony coming here and I think he will prove to 
be a real asset.”

Stokes last played for Ronny Deila’s team in August and apologised

 after sending an ill-judged tweet when left in the stands at Inverness last 
month.

Despite his lack of action, the Celtic manager said the striker can still play 
his way back into his plans if he can rediscover his form elsewhere.

Deila said: “A lot of clubs have been in contact who want to have him on their 
team. We will see what Anthony wants and what is best for the club. He is happy 
to go out on loan. He wants to get some games under his belt.

“It’s important for everybody he finds himself, gets some good performances 
and can then perform for Celtic again. Does he still have a Celtic future? 
Yeah, everybody has that. He has a contract with the club and he knows the 
things he has to take care of. Hopefully he will get a good run of games, score 
some goals and get back in good confidence and the best shape he can be in.”

Hibs are third in the Championship, five points behind the leaders, Rangers.
