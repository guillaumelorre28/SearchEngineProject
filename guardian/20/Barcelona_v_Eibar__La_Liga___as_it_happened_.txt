89 mins This is wonderful from Messi. He got the ball outside the box, had his 
back to goal, held off one defender, and another, then turned superbly, 
accelerated past a few more defenders before stinging Irureta’s palms with a 
rasping drive from about 16 yards out.

85 mins That nasty Iniesta has given away a free-kick wide on the right, near 
the corner of the Barça box. Nieto swings it in and a brave Bravo comes and 
punches it clear. Bravo, Bravo, the crowd don’t shout.

This is vintage Messi. He gets the ball a decent way out from the goal. He 
puts on the accelerators, speeds towards the box, plays a delicious one-two on 
the edge of the area (with Neymar) before continuing his run and poking the 
ball into the far corner of the net.

Alves has had a lot of touches of the ball but failed to do a lot with them, 
until now. He is given fart too much time on the right and far too much space. 
This allows him to look up and perfectly pick out Neymar in the centre of the 
box and his lightening quick volley leaves Irureta with no chance.

70 mins Philip Podolsky has a suggestion for Messi’s best goal. He says: “The 
one v Zaragoza is of course sensational, but he does miscontrol the ball there. 
My favourite Messi slalom is against Valencia - not as visceral as Zaragoza, 
but the control and changes of direction are unreal”

Down the Barça end, Mathieu fluffs his clearing lines and allows Piovaccari to 
have the ball. The Italian tries to shoot on goal and he does, but his effort 
is weak and Bravo collects it easily enough.

67 mins Albentosa concedes a corner. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> take it quickly and Alves and 
Messi do their one-two thing. The Argentine is surrounded by defenders and the 
angle is tight but he still manages to get his shot off. Despite all his hard 
work, it comes to nothing.

This is great, just great. Xavi picked the ball up outside the box. He looked 
up and saw Messi in some space. He laid the ball off to the Argentine and ran 
into the box. Once there, he received an inch-perfect return ball (no defenders 
tracked his run) from Messi and the Spanish midfielder just dinked the ball 
over Irureta and into the net.

stuffed with creativity and talent, as Barça are, can be so short of ideas when

54 mins Javi Lara hauls Neymar to the ground in order to call a halt to a 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> attack. He gets a 
yellow for his troubles. Just before that, Sergi Roberto was the meat in a Javi 
Lara and Lillo sandwich and us in some pain. He won’t be carrying one and is 
replaced by crowd favourite, Iniesta.

Meanwhile, it’s a corner to Barça. Pique makes a late dash and finds space but 
heads over once more. He curses the heaves above afterwards.

50 mins Xavi’s pass from outside the box splits the defence and finds Alves 
wide on the right. He loops one to the back post where Neymar and Messi combine 
to foul Bóveda and give away a free-kick.

48 mins Alves is fouled near the corner flag on the right. Xavi and Pedro 
stand over the ball and it is Xavi who whips it in. Pique rises, unchallenged, 
and heads the ball over the ball. He should have done much better there.

46 mins Eibar start by attacking down the right before being forced back into 
their own half and losing possession. Barça then set up shop on the edge of the
Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> box and eventually win a 
corner. Xavi sends it over and it finds its way to Pedro. His stinging shot is 
blocked by Ekiza.

Half-time: Barcelona 0-0 Eibar

45 mins That’s your lot for now but there was quite a few minutes of action 
just before the half-time whistle blew. A long ball over the top meant that 
Saúl was played through on goal. He took the ball down with a beautiful first 
touch and his second touch forced Bravo into standing tall and pulling off a 
very decent one-on-one save. From the resulting corner, Barça broke and Lillo 
got the game’s second yellow card for hauling down Neymar (I think) and 
stopping the attack. Back in a few minutes.

42 mins OMG, as the kids say. From that free-kick, the Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defence go to sleep and when 
you combine that with a long ball down the left wing, Capa has time and space 
to attack. He bears down on goal, nips the ball over Bravo and with the goal at 
his mercy, he shifts the ball onto his right foot and should score but instead 
he puts it wide. That is the very definition of a let-off.

40 mins Neymar is the first name to go into the book. The home crowd don’t 
like it and they have a point. The Brazilian was trying to do a double 
drag-back, messed it up and managed to accidentally step on Dani García’s 
ankle. Yep, apparently, you go into the book for that.

38 mins Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> are holding their 
shape very well and their discipline and concentration is impressive, as they 
frustrate their hosts. The question is though, do they have the necessary 
energy to keep it going for 90 minutes?

36 mins Messi creeps forward on the right. At the very corner of the box, he 
dinks a cross over, trying to find the head of the on-rushing Xavi. The cross 
misses its target by inches and goes out for a goal-kick.

34 mins Alves gets the ball at his feet about 25 or 30 yards out, wide on the 
right. The sensible thing to do from such a position is shoot. Being a sensible 
person that is exactly what Alves does. His sensible shot is sensibly wide.

28 mins Sergi Roberto attacks down the left. He passes to Neymar and on the 
edge of the box, he regains possession. He decides it is his time to shoot and 
that he does but his effort is blocked on its journey to Irureta.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Their pressure is almost 
constant now. Irureta comes and claims it. He then flings the ball forward to 
try start an attack but within milliseconds Barça have the ball once more and 
put the pressure back on the Eibar goal.

Pedro through. The Spaniard can’t get to that but aEibar

ball into Messi’s path just outside the box. He curls his effort this wide.

22 mins Back to the first of those chances. It seemed there was the slightest 
of nudges on Messi and a penalty could have been claimed, according to the TV 
commentators. Would have been a touch harsh. Meanwhile, Barça have a corner.

20 mins Neymar runs and runs and ghosts past a job lot of Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> defenders. He is into the box when 
he passes to Messi. He looks to have his first of the game until he is hounded 
out of it by another job lot of Eiber defenders. Moments after that, he has 
another good chance to open his account for the night. He gets the ball at the 
corner of the box on the right, plays a delightful one-two with Alves and is 
only stopped from scoring by Irureta standing tall at his near post.

16 mins Neymar gets the ball outside the box. He cuts inside and passes to 
Xavi. He, in turn, spread it wide to Alves on the right. The Brazilian 
full-back swings the ball into the box but, like Messi’s free-kick a moment or 
two ago, it comes to nothing.

14 mins Javi Lara chops Messi down just outside the box. The Argentine and 
Xavi stand over the resulting free-kick. The latter curls it into the box but 
it misses everyone and goes out for a goal-kick.

12 mins Pique thumps a ball clear to give Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> a throw deep in opposition 
territory. It would be a good spot to do something but they mess it up and 
Barça get countering. They mess that up too.

10 mins Back to that last chance for a moment, the noise level in the stadium 
went up about a million decibels when Neymar looked to set up Messi. In terms 
of atmosphere, the Camp Nou is poor. Not Emirates poor, but poor nonetheless.

6 mins Eibar are already pressing quite high, not allowing Barça too much time 
on the ball. The danger with such an approach is, of course, that it leaves the 
defence open to attacks shouldBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> escape the pressure and 
pressing and pass their way around them. So far, though, they have yet to do 
that.

4 mins Barcelona get a throw on the right. Alves and Pedro combine before 
Messi passes to Sergi Roberto. His location is just outside the box and said 
box is more crowded than a bar on a Saturday night. Nevertheless, he tries to 
shoot. It comes to nothing. Down the other end,Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> float a free-kick into the box but 
do nothing with it.

Meanwhile,Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> get their first 
ever throw in the Camp Nou and try to use it to attack down the Barça left. 
They falter quickly and Barça get to passing.

1 min And it is off that we go. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are in their traditional home 
number while Eibar are in their changed blue number. The home side play left to 
right for the first half. Incidentally, Eibar are the highest placed Basque 
team in the league this season and by all accounts are going out to win 
tonight. They couldn’t, could they?

If you are one of those who have had your internet switched off for the last 
few days, you may not know that it is 10 years since Leo Messi’s first-team 
debut forBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. You may 
also not know that when he arrived at the Camp Nou, aged 13, securing a 
contract was not simple. You can read all about that in this piece by Sid Lowe.

Charly Rexach grins a familiar grin. “I’ll go down in Barcelona’s history,” he 
says. Born and raised in Pedralbes, the smart neighbourhood that lies up the 
hill from the Camp Nou, Rexach joined Barcelona at the age of 12 and he has 
spent almost half a century there, on and off. He played for the first team for 
17 years and has been coach, assistant coach, technical director and 
presidential adviser. But that’s not why he says he will go down in history. 
No, Rexach says he will go down in Barcelona’s history because one day he 
signed Lionel Messi – on a serviette. Or so the story goes.

Horacio Gaggioli still has the serviette hidden away somewhere, although there 
have been calls to place it in Barcelona’s museum. Every now and then he takes 
it out and shows it off carefully. On Sunday, 17 September 2000, Gaggioli was 
waiting for Messi at El Prat airport in Barcelona. Messi, aged 13, was flying 
across the Atlantic with his father, Jorge, and Fabián Soldini, the player’s 
agent and Gaggioli’s partner. Together with Josep Maria Minguella, they had 
arranged for Messi to have a trial at Barcelona.

Minguella had told Rexach, Barcelona’s technical director, that this kid was 
like Diego Maradona. Minguella knew: he was the one who had brought Maradona to 
Barcelona 20 years earlier. They put Messi up in the Hotel Plaza, at the foot 
of Montjuïc, where escalators head up the hill to the Olympic stadium. The 
following day, Messi trained with the Barcelona youth team, Cesc Fàbregas and 
Gerard Piqué among them. Messi did not reach five feet and he changed in 
silence. In the dressing room, they looked at him and could not believe how 
small he was; on the pitch, they looked at him and couldn’t believe how good he 
was.

2.21pm BST 14:21  <> 

Good evening and welcome

There’s this picture of Andrea Pirlo. He is wearing the regulation sunglasses, 
a jumper is knotted around his waist and a white T-shirt adorns his chest. 
Emblazoned across said T-shirt are the words: No Pirlo no party. The message is 
obvious. Stuff does not get cracking unlessl’architetto is in the house. Right 
now in Barcelona, the T-shirt would have to read: No Neymar, no Messi, no party.

The two South Americans have been on fire this season. The Brazilian has eight 
goals to his name already, while the Argentine has seven, as well as his seven 
assists. Backed by a defence that has yet to concede a goal in the league, they 
have led the club to the top of the Spanish table, with six wins from their 
opening seven games. However, international super stars that they are, the two 
have also spent the season break jet-setting around the globe – Neymar scored 
all four against Japan while Messi scored twice against Hong Kong – and Luis 
Enrique is worried that they might be tinsy, bit tired from flying first class, 
staying in plush hotels, living a life of unbridled luxury and playing against 
oppositions that are useful as a single sandbag against a tidal wave. The poor, 
poor chaps, who wouldn’t be tired from all that, eh?

And so word on the street is that Enrique is going to call off the shindig. 
Word is he is to give the lads a nice, relaxing rest on the bench for this 
evening’s game against Eibar so they can chat about video games or Le Corbusier 
lamps, or whatever it is footballers talk about when they play the role of 
substituteand, of course, stop Messi from surpassing Telmo Zarra’s 
six-decade-old La Liga scoring record of 251 goals. What a meany pants that 
Enrique fellow is, eh?

But why, oh why, oh why, you cry? Well it’s obvious inn’it? Enrique is doing 
so because he’s not looking at the here and now but into the horizon. Off in 
the not-too-distant future, he sees Ajax at home in the Champions League and he 
sees Real Madrid away in La Liga and he sees that they are two games that are a 
touch more important, with all due respects sirs, than the one against last 
season’s winners of the Segunda División. When the camera zooms in in him later 
on in the game, look at his fingers, you’ll notice they will be crossed. That’s 
an external sign that he is hoping that whatever ridiculously talented kid from 
La Masia he has thrown on in their stead does the necessaries and stops him 
from telling the two to get warmed up.

That will be a tough task though. Eibar may be in their first season in the 
top flight after gaining two consecutive promotions but, unlike a small child 
or a feeble old man, they are no pushovers. As Sid Lowe has pointed out: 
“Traditionally, Eibar was seen as a place where young players toughened up: 
David Silva had played here, Xabi Alonso too.” They are a strong, hard working 
and well organised side who currently sit in a respectable mid-table position 
with a defensive record that is bettered by Barcelona and Valencia. They have 
also already beaten Real Sociedad and where it not for a lack of nerves on 
Ángel Luis Rodríguez Díaz’s part, they might have walked away from their game 
with Atlético Madrid with a point. Late in the game with the Eibar trailing 2-1 
at the Vicente Calderon, the Spanish striker had a great opportunity to score 
but poked the ball the wrong side of the post. Not bad for a side whose entire 
budget couldn’t cover Leo Messi’s wages.
A run of three draws may have dampened the initial enthusiasm of that 
opening-day win over Sociedad but coming to Barcelona to play Barcelona for the 
first time in the club’s history should get their motor going once more. Asking 
any side to leave the Camp Nou with even a point is tougher than leather but 
should Enrique rest Messi and Neymar and should Eibar over come any nerves and 
other obstacles, there’s a chance there could be no party.Hey, stranger things 
have happened

That’s your lot. Messi will have to wait till the Real Madrid game to break 
that record. Thanks for all your emails and tweets. Speak soon. Bye!

 
90 mins There are three more minutes to be added on.

 
89 mins This is wonderful from Messi. He got the ball outside the box, had his 
back to goal, held off one defender, and another, then turned superbly, 
accelerated past a few more defenders before stinging Irureta’s palms with a 
rasping drive from about 16 yards out.

 
87 mins Impressive, no?
barcastuff (@barcastuff)

Barcelona's 25 goals in all competitions this season#fcblive

<https://twitter.com/barcastuff/status/523559063150657536>  
85 mins That nasty Iniesta has given away a free-kick wide on the right, near 
the corner of the Barça box. Nieto swings it in and a brave Bravo comes and 
punches it clear. Bravo, Bravo, the crowd don’t shout.

 
81 mins Corner to Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. 
They play it short and it comes to Iniesta. He tries to scoop it in bur Eibar 
deal with it. Speaking of Iniesta, He has just gone in the book for holding 
back the recently introduced sub, Dani Nieto.
 
79 mins Barça are playing keep-ball now. Pass, pass, pass it goes. Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> can’t get close to the round thing.

 
76 mins Some subs to tell you about. Neymar has been replaces by Munir and 
Sandro has come on for Pedro.

 
This is vintage Messi. He gets the ball a decent way out from the goal. He 
puts on the accelerators, speeds towards the box, plays a delicious one-two on 
the edge of the area (with Neymar) before continuing his run and poking the 
ball into the far corner of the net.

 
Just two more needed now (till the record is his).
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
250 - Lionel Messi has now scored 250 La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> goals (in 285 games), 
just one short of the all-time competition record. Lethal.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/523557875990691843>  
Alves has had a lot of touches of the ball but failed to do a lot with them, 
until now. He is given fart too much time on the right and far too much space. 
This allows him to look up and perfectly pick out Neymar in the centre of the 
box and his lightening quick volley leaves Irureta with no chance.

 
And that should be that.

70 mins Philip Podolsky has a suggestion for Messi’s best goal. He says: “The 
one v Zaragoza is of course sensational, but he does miscontrol the ball there. 
My favourite Messi slalom is against Valencia - not as visceral as Zaragoza, 
but the control and changes of direction are unreal”
 
68 mins Just the 101.
Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) 
THINK that's 101st assist from Messi since his debut ten years ago

<https://twitter.com/BumperGraham/status/523553107750711297> 
Down the Barça end, Mathieu fluffs his clearing lines and allows Piovaccari to 
have the ball. The Italian tries to shoot on goal and he does, but his effort 
is weak and Bravo collects it easily enough.

 
67 mins Albentosa concedes a corner. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> take it quickly and Alves and 
Messi do their one-two thing. The Argentine is surrounded by defenders and the 
angle is tight but he still manages to get his shot off. Despite all his hard 
work, it comes to nothing.

 
65 mins Impressive, no?

Barcelona: Have now scored in each of their last 56 La Liga

64 mins  Lillo introduces Neymar to the turf and Barça have a free-kick on the 
left, near the corner of the box. Xavi sends it in butEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> deal with it easily enough. 

 
This is great, just great. Xavi picked the ball up outside the box. He looked 
up and saw Messi in some space. He laid the ball off to the Argentine and ran 
into the box. Once there, he received an inch-perfect return ball (no defenders 
tracked his run) from Messi and the Spanish midfielder just dinked the ball 
over Irureta and into the net.
 
Well, isn’t my face red?
 Xavi turns away to celebrate after opening the scoring for Barcelona. 
Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images  
58 mins While Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> have 
performed above and beyond tonight, it is somewhat mind boggling how a side so 
stuffed with creativity and talent, as Barça are, can be so short of ideas when 
going forward.

 
56 mins Time for Eibar to make a sub. Off goes Javi Lara and on comes 
Piovaccari. Fun fact about Piovaccari.Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> are his 16th club.

 
54 mins Javi Lara hauls Neymar to the ground in order to call a halt to a 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> attack. He gets a 
yellow for his troubles. Just before that, Sergi Roberto was the meat in a Javi 
Lara and Lillo sandwich and us in some pain. He won’t be carrying one and is 
replaced by crowd favourite, Iniesta.

 
52 mins Speaking of Alves ...
WhoScored.com (@WhoScored) 
Dani Alves: Had at least 19 more touches (73) than any other player in the 
pitch in the first half ofBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> v Eibar
 <https://twitter.com/WhoScored/status/523548907079356417> October 18, 2014 
<https://twitter.com/WhoScored/status/523548907079356417> 
Meanwhile, it’s a corner to Barça. Pique makes a late dash and finds space but 
heads over once more. He curses the heaves above afterwards.

 
50 mins Xavi’s pass from outside the box splits the defence and finds Alves 
wide on the right. He loops one to the back post where Neymar and Messi combine 
to foul Bóveda and give away a free-kick.

 
48 mins Alves is fouled near the corner flag on the right. Xavi and Pedro 
stand over the ball and it is Xavi who whips it in. Pique rises, unchallenged, 
and heads the ball over the ball. He should have done much better there.

 
46 mins Eibar start by attacking down the right before being forced back into 
their own half and losing possession. Barça then set up shop on the edge of the
Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> box and eventually win a 
corner. Xavi sends it over and it finds its way to Pedro. His stinging shot is 
blocked by Ekiza.
 
45 mins And we are back. No changes to tell you about just yet. 

 
45 mins That’s your lot for now but there was quite a few minutes of action 
just before the half-time whistle blew. A long ball over the top meant that 
Saúl was played through on goal. He took the ball down with a beautiful first 
touch and his second touch forced Bravo into standing tall and pulling off a 
very decent one-on-one save. From the resulting corner, Barça broke and Lillo 
got the game’s second yellow card for hauling down Neymar (I think) and 
stopping the attack. Back in a few minutes.

 
42 mins OMG, as the kids say. From that free-kick, the Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defence go to sleep and when 
you combine that with a long ball down the left wing, Capa has time and space 
to attack. He bears down on goal, nips the ball over Bravo and with the goal at 
his mercy, he shifts the ball onto his right foot and should score but instead 
he puts it wide. That is the very definition of a let-off.

 
40 mins Neymar is the first name to go into the book. The home crowd don’t 
like it and they have a point. The Brazilian was trying to do a double 
drag-back, messed it up and managed to accidentally step on Dani García’s 
ankle. Yep, apparently, you go into the book for that.

 
38 mins Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> are holding their 
shape very well and their discipline and concentration is impressive, as they 
frustrate their hosts. The question is though, do they have the necessary 
energy to keep it going for 90 minutes?

 
36 mins Messi creeps forward on the right. At the very corner of the box, he 
dinks a cross over, trying to find the head of the on-rushing Xavi. The cross 
misses its target by inches and goes out for a goal-kick.

 
34 mins Alves gets the ball at his feet about 25 or 30 yards out, wide on the 
right. The sensible thing to do from such a position is shoot. Being a sensible 
person that is exactly what Alves does. His sensible shot is sensibly wide.

 
32 mins Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure.Pass. Pressure. Pass. 
Pressure. Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure.Pass. Pressure. Pass. 
Pressure. Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure. Pass. Pressure.Pass. Pressure. Pass. 
Pressure.
 
30 mins Anyone out there?

 
28 mins Sergi Roberto attacks down the left. He passes to Neymar and on the 
edge of the box, he regains possession. He decides it is his time to shoot and 
that he does but his effort is blocked on its journey to Irureta.
 
26 mins Another corner to Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Their pressure is almost 
constant now. Irureta comes and claims it. He then flings the ball forward to 
try start an attack but within milliseconds Barça have the ball once more and 
put the pressure back on the Eibar goal.

 
24 mins And up he pops again. After some slick running, Messi looks to play 
Pedro through. The Spaniard can’t get to that but aEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> foot does and said foot knocks the 
ball into Messi’s path just outside the box. He curls his effort this wide.

 
22 mins Back to the first of those chances. It seemed there was the slightest 
of nudges on Messi and a penalty could have been claimed, according to the TV 
commentators. Would have been a touch harsh. Meanwhile, Barça have a corner. 
Xavi sends it in andEibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> send it 
out.

 
20 mins Neymar runs and runs and ghosts past a job lot of Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> defenders. He is into the box when 
he passes to Messi. He looks to have his first of the game until he is hounded 
out of it by another job lot of Eiber defenders. Moments after that, he has 
another good chance to open his account for the night. He gets the ball at the 
corner of the box on the right, plays a delightful one-two with Alves and is 
only stopped from scoring by Irureta standing tall at his near post.

 
18 mins You knew this already, right? Yeah, me too.
barcastuff (@barcastuff) 
Eibar is the 249th team Barcelona face in their 115 years of history #fcblive

<https://twitter.com/barcastuff/status/523537369614798849>  
16 mins Neymar gets the ball outside the box. He cuts inside and passes to 
Xavi. He, in turn, spread it wide to Alves on the right. The Brazilian 
full-back swings the ball into the box but, like Messi’s free-kick a moment or 
two ago, it comes to nothing.

 
14 mins Javi Lara chops Messi down just outside the box. The Argentine and 
Xavi stand over the resulting free-kick. The latter curls it into the box but 
it misses everyone and goes out for a goal-kick.

 
12 mins Pique thumps a ball clear to give Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> a throw deep in opposition 
territory. It would be a good spot to do something but they mess it up and 
Barça get countering. They mess that up too.

 
10 mins Back to that last chance for a moment, the noise level in the stadium 
went up about a million decibels when Neymar looked to set up Messi. In terms 
of atmosphere, the Camp Nou is poor. Not Emirates poor, but poor nonetheless.

 
8 mins Neymar has the ball at his feet wide on the left. He works his way into 
the box and looks to set up Messi but anEibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> players gets to the pass before 
the Argentine and hoofs it out for a corner. That is sent over before Piqué 
sends it over the bar.

 
6 mins Eibar are already pressing quite high, not allowing Barça too much time 
on the ball. The danger with such an approach is, of course, that it leaves the 
defence open to attacks shouldBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> escape the pressure and 
pressing and pass their way around them. So far, though, they have yet to do 
that.

 
4 mins Barcelona get a throw on the right. Alves and Pedro combine before 
Messi passes to Sergi Roberto. His location is just outside the box and said 
box is more crowded than a bar on a Saturday night. Nevertheless, he tries to 
shoot. It comes to nothing. Down the other end,Eibar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> float a free-kick into the box but 
do nothing with it.

 
2 mins It took 20 second for the David v Goliath cliche to be knocked out. 
Meanwhile,Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> get their first 
ever throw in the Camp Nou and try to use it to attack down the Barça left. 
They falter quickly and Barça get to passing.

 
1 min And it is off that we go. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are in their traditional home 
number while Eibar are in their changed blue number. The home side play left to 
right for the first half. Incidentally, Eibar are the highest placed Basque 
team in the league this season and by all accounts are going out to win 
tonight. They couldn’t, could they?

 
Ten years, eh? And just a few more goals before that La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> record is his. Speaking 
of his goals, is this his best one?
 
If you are one of those who have had your internet switched off for the last 
few days, you may not know that it is 10 years since Leo Messi’s first-team 
debut forBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. You may 
also not know that when he arrived at the Camp Nou, aged 13, securing a 
contract was not simple. You can read all about that in this piece by Sid Lowe.

Charly Rexach grins a familiar grin. “I’ll go down in Barcelona’s history,” he 
says. Born and raised in Pedralbes, the smart neighbourhood that lies up the 
hill from the Camp Nou, Rexach joined Barcelona at the age of 12 and he has 
spent almost half a century there, on and off. He played for the first team for 
17 years and has been coach, assistant coach, technical director and 
presidential adviser. But that’s not why he says he will go down in history. 
No, Rexach says he will go down in Barcelona’s history because one day he 
signed Lionel Messi – on a serviette. Or so the story goes.

Horacio Gaggioli still has the serviette hidden away somewhere, although there 
have been calls to place it in Barcelona’s museum. Every now and then he takes 
it out and shows it off carefully. On Sunday, 17 September 2000, Gaggioli was 
waiting for Messi at El Prat airport in Barcelona. Messi, aged 13, was flying 
across the Atlantic with his father, Jorge, and Fabián Soldini, the player’s 
agent and Gaggioli’s partner. Together with Josep Maria Minguella, they had 
arranged for Messi to have a trial at Barcelona.

Minguella had told Rexach, Barcelona’s technical director, that this kid was 
like Diego Maradona. Minguella knew: he was the one who had brought Maradona to 
Barcelona 20 years earlier. They put Messi up in the Hotel Plaza, at the foot 
of Montjuïc, where escalators head up the hill to the Olympic stadium. The 
following day, Messi trained with the Barcelona youth team, Cesc Fàbregas and 
Gerard Piqué among them. Messi did not reach five feet and he changed in 
silence. In the dressing room, they looked at him and could not believe how 
small he was; on the pitch, they looked at him and couldn’t believe how good he 
was.

Earlier today, Cristiano Ronaldo continued his remarkable scoring record with 
a goal in each half as Real Madrid strolled to victory over Levante. You can

In a stark example of Luis Enrique being anti-Guardian premables, not only has 
he not rested Messi, he has not rested Neymar either. Bah! Anyboohoo, those two 
start while Mathieu gets another chance to impress at full-back and Iniesta can 
only make the bench (which really effs up the photo above too!). Those teams in 
full are as follows:

There’s this picture of Andrea Pirlo. He is wearing the regulation sunglasses, 
a jumper is knotted around his waist and a white T-shirt adorns his chest. 
Emblazoned across said T-shirt are the words: No Pirlo no party. The message is 
obvious. Stuff does not get cracking unlessl’architetto is in the house. Right 
now in Barcelona, the T-shirt would have to read: No Neymar, no Messi, no party.

The two South Americans have been on fire this season. The Brazilian has eight 
goals to his name already, while the Argentine has seven, as well as his seven 
assists. Backed by a defence that has yet to concede a goal in the league, they 
have led the club to the top of the Spanish table, with six wins from their 
opening seven games. However, international super stars that they are, the two 
have also spent the season break jet-setting around the globe – Neymar scored 
all four against Japan while Messi scored twice against Hong Kong – and Luis 
Enrique is worried that they might be tinsy, bit tired from flying first class, 
staying in plush hotels, living a life of unbridled luxury and playing against 
oppositions that are useful as a single sandbag against a tidal wave. The poor, 
poor chaps, who wouldn’t be tired from all that, eh?

And so word on the street is that Enrique is going to call off the shindig. 
Word is he is to give the lads a nice, relaxing rest on the bench for this 
evening’s game against Eibar so they can chat about video games or Le Corbusier 
lamps, or whatever it is footballers talk about when they play the role of 
substituteand, of course, stop Messi from surpassing Telmo Zarra’s 
six-decade-old La Liga scoring record of 251 goals. What a meany pants that 
Enrique fellow is, eh?

But why, oh why, oh why, you cry? Well it’s obvious inn’it? Enrique is doing 
so because he’s not looking at the here and now but into the horizon. Off in 
the not-too-distant future, he sees Ajax at home in the Champions League and he 
sees Real Madrid away in La Liga and he sees that they are two games that are a 
touch more important, with all due respects sirs, than the one against last 
season’s winners of the Segunda División. When the camera zooms in in him later 
on in the game, look at his fingers, you’ll notice they will be crossed. That’s 
an external sign that he is hoping that whatever ridiculously talented kid from 
La Masia he has thrown on in their stead does the necessaries and stops him 
from telling the two to get warmed up.

That will be a tough task though. Eibar may be in their first season in the 
top flight after gaining two consecutive promotions but, unlike a small child 
or a feeble old man, they are no pushovers. As Sid Lowe has pointed out: 
“Traditionally, Eibar was seen as a place where young players toughened up: 
David Silva had played here, Xabi Alonso too.” They are a strong, hard working 
and well organised side who currently sit in a respectable mid-table position 
with a defensive record that is bettered by Barcelona and Valencia. They have 
also already beaten Real Sociedad and where it not for a lack of nerves on 
Ángel Luis Rodríguez Díaz’s part, they might have walked away from their game 
with Atlético Madrid with a point. Late in the game with the Eibar trailing 2-1 
at the Vicente Calderon, the Spanish striker had a great opportunity to score 
but poked the ball the wrong side of the post. Not bad for a side whose entire 
budget couldn’t cover Leo Messi’s wages.
A run of three draws may have dampened the initial enthusiasm of that 
opening-day win over Sociedad but coming to Barcelona to play Barcelona for the 
first time in the club’s history should get their motor going once more. Asking 
any side to leave the Camp Nou with even a point is tougher than leather but 
should Enrique rest Messi and Neymar and should Eibar over come any nerves and 
other obstacles, there’s a chance there could be no party.Hey, stranger things 
have happened
