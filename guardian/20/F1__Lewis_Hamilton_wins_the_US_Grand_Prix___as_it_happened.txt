Gerard Butler and Daniel Ricciardo are having a love-in on the podium. Butler 
drinks fizz from his mate’s shoe. Now they are doing accents. It’s like a 
terrible stag-do, it’s awful. I can’t do this anymore, I’m off. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!

Lewis Hamilton holds the trophy aloft to polite applause from Nico Rosberg by 
his side. It wasn’t a classic race but the Briton was the fastest driver all 
weekend. That’s the 50th win of his career.

Ricciardo finishes third and he will rue the virtual safety car which denied 
him a chance to challenge for second. Vettel takes fourth, with Alonso clinging 
to a fine fifth and Sainz taking sixth, an impressive race by the Toro Rosso 
driver.

Lewis Hamilton wins the US Grand Prix!

Hamilton led from pole to flag and cruises over the line, letting out a 
“ye-ha!” over team radio. Nico Rosberg finishes second and his championship 
advantage has been cut to 26 points. Three races to go.

Final lap Hamilton begins the final lap with a 6sec advantage on Rosberg. 
“You’ve got a front-left puncture,” Massa is told. Ahead of him, Alonso is 
desperately trying to take fifth from Sainz and makes it stick with a bold

Lap 54/56 Bottas overtakes Nasr for the right to finish 15th. The opening-lap 
puncture really scuppered Bottas’s day.

Lap 53/56 Something just happened! Alonso and Massa go wheel to wheel and the 
McLaren driver makes it stick. Was there a bit of contact? Hard to tell, but 
both cars seem to have come out unscathed.

Lap 49/56 This battle between Sainz, Massa and Alonso for fifth, sixth and 
seventh is the most excitement we can find left on the track with things all 
but sewn up at the front. Hamilton will surely win this one and Rosberg will 
settle for second ahead of a grumpy Ricciardo in third. Further back, Jolyon 
Palmer is passed by his Renault team-mate Kevin Magnussen for 13th.

Sainz, who is up in fifth having started 10th on the grid. Massa is close and

Lap 42/56 Hamilton is cruising to a serene victory here. He remains 9sec ahead 
of his team-mate Rosberg, who is probably pretty satisfied with second right 
now given the way he lost that spot at the first corner.

Lap 41/56 The suspicion is that Raikkonen was released from the pits with a 
wheel gun still attached, and that is why he had to stop.

Lap 40/56 This is an extraordinary way to end a race. Raikkonen makes a 
pit-stop and returns to the track but is immediately told to stop by the team. 
He pulls over on the hill towards turn one, and rolls his Ferrari back down 
into the pits, which seems slightly dangerous to me. He can’t get his car all 
the way to his mechanics and that’s his race run.

Lap 37/56 Raikkonen is closing in on Ricciardo’s rear, though the Ferrari is 
planning to make one more stop. His team-mate Vettel meanwhile has had a wobble 
in the S-bends and almost lost control under absolutely no pressure. He manages 
to regain control but that looked rather concerning.

Lap 35/56 The virtual safety car has metaphorically done one, and it might 
have done it’s damage to Ricciardo’s afternoon. Red Bull tell him to get after 
Rosberg up ahead with the gap around 3sec. Here is the top 10 after 
Verstappen’s retirement, which has seen Jenson Button climb into a points 
position:

1 Hamilton
2 Rosberg
3 Ricciardo
4 Raikkonen
5 Vettel
6 Sainz
7 Massa
8 Alonso
9 Pérez
10 Button

Lap 34/56 “They got a free pit-stop basically,” bemoans Daniel Ricciardo on 
team radio after Mercedes took the opportunity to box both of their cars under 
the virtual safety car. His shot at finishing second may well have been 
scuppered by his team-mate’s retirement.

Lap 33/56 Mercedes take the opportunity under the virtual safety car to pit 
Lewis Hamilton. It’s a tidy stop and a moment later Rosberg is in too. They 
both return on the medium tyres and, barring any incidents, that should be 
their cue to go to the end of the race.

Lap 31/56 It won’t matter now because Verstappen is in big trouble! His car is 
trundling along the side of track as rivals fly past and it seems like he may 
be suffering an engine failure. This could be the end of his US Grand Prix.

Vettel.

without a call from the team! The mechanics get their sprint on and manage to 
change his tyres pretty swiftly, given the circumstances. “What happened Max?” 
they ask on radio. “Sorry, I thought you called me in.”

Lap 26/56 Rosberg was just starting to have a look down the inside of 
Ricciardo’s Red Bull when the Australian came in for a tyre change. He puts on 
mediums and will go to the end from here.

Lap 25/56 Raikkonen pits and puts on the super soft tyre, which suggests he is 
going to need to pit once more at some point before the end of this race. Had 
he put on the medium tyre then he probably wouldn’t have needed to come back in 
so it is an interesting strategy by Ferrari. He returns in P6 just ahead of 
Massa, who can’t find a way to sneak past.

Lap 23/56 Hamilton has extended his lead over Ricciardo to nearly 7sec and is 
looking extremely comfortable. However he really needs a leg-up from the 
Australian today to take a serious chunk out of Rosberg’s championship lead. 
Rosberg is 2sec back from the Red Bull in third.

Lap 17/56 Esteban Gutiérrez has a brake issue and his Haas slides off the 
track. Luckily there is a deep run-off area and he is able to swing back round 
on to the track before heading to the pits, but it doesn’t look like he will be 
emerging again. Gutiérrez becomes the second retiree after Hülkenberg.

Lap 13/56 Max Verstappen, currently down in 6th, sets a new fastest lap on the 
soft tyre. He lines up Kimi Raikkonen for a pass through the winding S-bends 
and clings on brilliantly to take 5th.

Lap 12/56 Hamilton puts on the soft tyres, so he is on an alternative strategy 
to Rosberg. For now Vettel leads the way but he about to make his first stop.

Lap 11/56 Rosberg is the first Mercedes to come in and he puts on the medium

similar when he comes in on the next lap.

This might be the best grid-walk ever witnessed. Brundle talks to skier 
Lindsey Vonn and angry chef Gordon Ramsey before being totally blanked by Venus 
Williams, who fully turns her back on him, on live TV. What next? Thrilling

This is unusual. Daniel Ricciardo is having a chinwag with Gerard Butler, and

Daniel Ricciardo speaks: “I’m looking to get a better start than Lewis and 
Nico and hopefully get into the lead by the end of lap one. Ideally I’d find a

Preamble

Lewis Hamilton continues to talk the talk when it comes to his championship 
hopes, but he must know that Nico Rosberg will have one glove on his first 
world title should the German win in Austin; his current 33-point lead with 
four races to go is recoverable but a 40+ lead with three left seems more than 
a stretch. It was vital then that Hamilton secured pole on Saturday at a 
circuit he so enjoys tearing around. Rosberg will start second with the Red 
Bull duo of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen on the second row.

Then again, a quick look back through some of this season’s turning points is 
a reminder that pole position does not always translate to top of the podium, 
especially when Hamilton is on the front. The technical problems that have 
dogged his starts are always lurking in the background and should they surface 
at the Circuit of the Americas, his hopes of a fourth US Grand Prix win will be 
in serious peril. More importantly, the championship will be Rosberg’s to lose.

Beyond the Mercedes drivers there is a whole field of action and plenty to 
look out for, most notably Red Bull’s timely late-season surge and Ferrari’s 
issues which leave Sebastian Vettel sounding a little more fed up with each 
passing session. Can Jolyon Palmer put on a show for Renault? Will Jenson 
Button be able to make an impact from the back? Will home-team Haas offer the 
crowd anything, at all, to cheer? We’ll soon find out.

Gerard Butler and Daniel Ricciardo are having a love-in on the podium. Butler 
drinks fizz from his mate’s shoe. Now they are doing accents. It’s like a 
terrible stag-do, it’s awful. I can’t do this anymore, I’m off. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!
 
Lewis Hamilton speaks: “I feel OK. I love being here in the States, it feels 
like home. The team did a great job this weekend.”
 
Lewis Hamilton holds the trophy aloft to polite applause from Nico Rosberg by 
his side. It wasn’t a classic race but the Briton was the fastest driver all 
weekend. That’s the 50th win of his career.
 
The podium awaits. Gerard Butler is on interview duty, I hear.

3 Ricciardo 
4 Vettel 
5 Alonso

8 Pérez
9 Button
10 Grosjean
 
Ricciardo finishes third and he will rue the virtual safety car which denied 
him a chance to challenge for second. Vettel takes fourth, with Alonso clinging 
to a fine fifth and Sainz taking sixth, an impressive race by the Toro Rosso 
driver.

advantage has been cut to 26 points. Three races to go.

Final lap Hamilton begins the final lap with a 6sec advantage on Rosberg. 
“You’ve got a front-left puncture,” Massa is told. Ahead of him, Alonso is 
desperately trying to take fifth from Sainz and makes it stick with a bold 
move! Brilliantly done.
 
Lap 55/56 Vettel pits, just because he can. He’s comfortably fourth. 
 
Lap 54/56 Bottas overtakes Nasr for the right to finish 15th. The opening-lap 
puncture really scuppered Bottas’s day.
 
Lap 53/56 Something just happened! Alonso and Massa go wheel to wheel and the 
McLaren driver makes it stick. Was there a bit of contact? Hard to tell, but 
both cars seem to have come out unscathed.
 
Lap 51/56 Alonso is in DRS territory behind Massa but is struggling to make it 
count.

Great fight for Alonso and Masa

Lap 49/56 This battle between Sainz, Massa and Alonso for fifth, sixth and 
seventh is the most excitement we can find left on the track with things all 
but sewn up at the front. Hamilton will surely win this one and Rosberg will 
settle for second ahead of a grumpy Ricciardo in third. Further back, Jolyon 
Palmer is passed by his Renault team-mate Kevin Magnussen for 13th.

Lap 47/56 Sainz and Massa have company with Fernando Alonso’s black McLaren 
desperately trying to find a route around them. Less than 1.5sec covers the 
three cars.
 
Lap 46/56 The various incidents in Austin have played in the hands of Carlos 
Sainz, who is up in fifth having started 10th on the grid. Massa is close and 
tries to get past the Toro Rosso but locks up and can’t quite complete the pass.
 
Lap 44/56 Ricciardo lets off some steam with a sweary tirade on team radio 
directed towards poor old Nico Rosberg.

Lap 42/56 Hamilton is cruising to a serene victory here. He remains 9sec ahead 
of his team-mate Rosberg, who is probably pretty satisfied with second right 
now given the way he lost that spot at the first corner.
 
Lap 41/56 The suspicion is that Raikkonen was released from the pits with a 
wheel gun still attached, and that is why he had to stop.
 
Lap 40/56 This is an extraordinary way to end a race. Raikkonen makes a 
pit-stop and returns to the track but is immediately told to stop by the team. 
He pulls over on the hill towards turn one, and rolls his Ferrari back down 
into the pits, which seems slightly dangerous to me. He can’t get his car all 
the way to his mechanics and that’s his race run.
 
Lap 38/56 Lewis Hamilton is 10sec clear of Nico Rosberg, who is a further 5sec 
up on Ricciardo and these three are in total control of the podium places.
 
Lap 37/56 Raikkonen is closing in on Ricciardo’s rear, though the Ferrari is 
planning to make one more stop. His team-mate Vettel meanwhile has had a wobble 
in the S-bends and almost lost control under absolutely no pressure. He manages 
to regain control but that looked rather concerning.
 
Lap 36/56 “Can you not help me out a bit here?” growls Jolyon Palmer over team 
radio. He is stuck behind his Renault team-mate, Kevin Magnussen, in 15th and 
is not being allowed through.
 
Lap 35/56 The virtual safety car has metaphorically done one, and it might 
have done it’s damage to Ricciardo’s afternoon. Red Bull tell him to get after 
Rosberg up ahead with the gap around 3sec. Here is the top 10 after 
Verstappen’s retirement, which has seen Jenson Button climb into a points 
position:

1 Hamilton
2 Rosberg
3 Ricciardo
4 Raikkonen
5 Vettel
6 Sainz
7 Massa
8 Alonso
9 Pérez
10 Button
 
Lap 34/56 “They got a free pit-stop basically,” bemoans Daniel Ricciardo on 
team radio after Mercedes took the opportunity to box both of their cars under 
the virtual safety car. His shot at finishing second may well have been 
scuppered by his team-mate’s retirement.
 
Lap 33/56 Mercedes take the opportunity under the virtual safety car to pit 
Lewis Hamilton. It’s a tidy stop and a moment later Rosberg is in too. They 
both return on the medium tyres and, barring any incidents, that should be 
their cue to go to the end of the race.
 
Lap 32/56 Verstappen’s Red Bull comes to a sorry end on the grass. The virtual 
safety car is out, virtually speaking.

Lap 31/56 It won’t matter now because Verstappen is in big trouble! His car is 
trundling along the side of track as rivals fly past and it seems like he may 
be suffering an engine failure. This could be the end of his US Grand Prix.
 
Lap 30/56 That mis-step leaves Verstappen sixth and he may not get those lost 
places back. We will find out very soon because Ferrari are looking to pit 
Vettel.
 
Lap 28/56 Chaos in the Red Bull garage as Max Verstappen goes rogue and pits 
without a call from the team! The mechanics get their sprint on and manage to 
change his tyres pretty swiftly, given the circumstances. “What happened Max?” 
they ask on radio. “Sorry, I thought you called me in.”
 
Lap 26/56 Rosberg was just starting to have a look down the inside of 
Ricciardo’s Red Bull when the Australian came in for a tyre change. He puts on 
mediums and will go to the end from here.
 
Lap 25/56 Raikkonen pits and puts on the super soft tyre, which suggests he is 
going to need to pit once more at some point before the end of this race. Had 
he put on the medium tyre then he probably wouldn’t have needed to come back in 
so it is an interesting strategy by Ferrari. He returns in P6 just ahead of 
Massa, who can’t find a way to sneak past.

Lap 23/56 Hamilton has extended his lead over Ricciardo to nearly 7sec and is 
looking extremely comfortable. However he really needs a leg-up from the 
Australian today to take a serious chunk out of Rosberg’s championship lead. 
Rosberg is 2sec back from the Red Bull in third.
 
Lap 21/56 “Max, just make sure you finish this stint,” say Red Bull to 
Verstappen. “I’m not here to finish fourth,” comes the reply as the teenager 
continues to put pressure on Rosberg.
 
Lap 19/56 Hamilton has built up a 5sec advantage over Ricciardo. Rosberg is 
around 1sec back from the Australian but it is the other Red Bull he has to 
worry about. Verstappen is all over the back of the championship leader.

Lap 17/56 Esteban Gutiérrez has a brake issue and his Haas slides off the 
track. Luckily there is a deep run-off area and he is able to swing back round 
on to the track before heading to the pits, but it doesn’t look like he will be 
emerging again. Gutiérrez becomes the second retiree after Hülkenberg.
 
Lap 15/56 Vettel comes in to put on soft tyres like most of the rest of the 
field, and returns in P6. Now that everyone who’s anyone has pitted, here is the
top 10:

1 Hamilton
2 Ricciardo
3 Rosberg
4 Verstappen
5 Raikkonen
6 Vettel
7 Massa
8 Sainz
9 Kvyat
10 Alonso
 
Lap 14/56 Yellow flags in sector one for debris. Meanwhile, Daniil Kvyat has 
been given a 10-second penalty for causing a collision with Sergio Pérez.
 
Lap 13/56 Max Verstappen, currently down in 6th, sets a new fastest lap on the 
soft tyre. He lines up Kimi Raikkonen for a pass through the winding S-bends 
and clings on brilliantly to take 5th.
 
Lap 12/56 Hamilton puts on the soft tyres, so he is on an alternative strategy 
to Rosberg. For now Vettel leads the way but he about to make his first stop.
 
Lap 11/56 Rosberg is the first Mercedes to come in and he puts on the medium 
tyre. It’s a pretty smooth stop and Hamilton will be hoping for something 
similar when he comes in on the next lap.
 
Lap 9/56 Raikkonen pits too before returning behind Button, but he quickly 
picks off the McLaren, and a moment later Verstappen does the very same.
 
Lap 8/56 A couple of collisions from the opening lap are being investigated by 
the stewards – more if anything comes of it. “Box Daniel, box,” say Red Bull 
and Ricciardo comes in for the soft tyre.
 
Lap 6/56 Sergio Pérez finds Daniil Kvyat’s slipstream along the pit straight 
and attacks at turn one to take 13th.
 
Lap 5/56 Replays of the start from Ricciardo’s viewpoint show him angle his 
car in towards the first corner and power inside Nico Rosberg to grab 2nd 
place, and he hasn’t looked back.
 
Lap 3/56 In the commotion at the front Kimi Raikkonen managed to sweep around 
Max Verstappen in the opening couple of corners and has made 4th his. Jenson 
Button meanwhile is flying, up from 19th on the grid to 10th. Hamilton out in 
front, with Ricciardo 2nd and Rosberg 3rd.
 
Lap 1/56 “Puncture, puncture,” says Valtteri Bottas over radio after contact 
on the opening corner. Nico Hülkenberg is the other big loser from the opening 
lap and he has retired, having collided with Sebastian Vettel at turn one who 
was fine to continue.

Rosberg at the first corner!
