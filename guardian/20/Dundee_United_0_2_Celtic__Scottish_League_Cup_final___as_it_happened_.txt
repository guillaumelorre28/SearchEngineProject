FULL-TIME Dundee United 0-2 Celtic

Celtic are League Cup winners for the first time since 2009. The first part of 
a domestic treble is claimed, now for the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay in 
midweek against …Dundee United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited>. Before they face each 
other in the league next Saturday. They deserved this win today and once Sean 
Dillon was shown a straight red at 0-1, there was going to be no way back for 
United. Thanks for reading. Bye!

PENALTY SAVED!

What a dreadful take from Forrest. He’s passed it along the ground and 
straight at Cierzniak. He may have to answer some questions from Guidetti for 
that. It remains 0-2.

79 min: Guidetti lays it off to Forrest, who picks his spot and side foots 
into the net with his right. That should be game over. It came after Morris 
made an incredible tackle to deny Guidetti initially but the ball broke kindly 
to Johansen who fed it back in.

71 min: Celtic are dominating possession but Dundee United

Denayer is the latest to waste a chance to make it 2-0 when heading a Johansen 
cross over from five yards. Poor from the centre-half.

68 min: Stokes spots Ambrose free on the right. His cross meets Griffiths near 
the penalty spot but the strike has too much on it and it sails over.

66 min: McGowan has been defending well on the right, in the area vacated by 
Dillon, since United have dropped to 10 men but Griffiths finally manages to 
get a cross in towards Johansen. Fojut is in place to clear. But only back as 
far as that flank again. Griffiths drives another cross in towards the 
near-post. Johansen is on hand to shoot but Fojut disrupts him enough for the 
attempt to miss the target.

Sean Dillon is sent off!

55 min: The Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> 
captain comes in late and high on Izaguirre after a heavy touch near halfway. 
His studs are planted on the defender’s shin and the referee has no other 
option but to brandish the red card. There may not be any way back now.

54 min: United’s only obviously outlet to hurt Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> is for Dow to pick the ball up 
deep and find a Bilate run in front of him. They have options on the bench, 
mind, but how long before McNamara makes a change and goes for attack?

50 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have United 
pinned back. All 10 men in tangerine are stuck in their own half. Struggling to 
see what they can do to get back into this game apart from keep it to 1-0 and 
throw everything forward in the final 15 minutes.

44 min: Shout for a Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
penalty as Griffiths goes down following a tangle with Fojut. It’s completely 
accidental and appears to be just outside the area. No matter, play continues 
despite the half-hearted claims.

Celtic are League Cup winners for the first time since 2009. The first part of 
a domestic treble is claimed, now for the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay in 
midweek against …Dundee United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited>. Before they face each 
other in the league next Saturday. They deserved this win today and once Sean 
Dillon was shown a straight red at 0-1, there was going to be no way back for 
United. Thanks for reading. Bye!

 
90 min +1: Johansen, played in by Forrest, shoots over.
 
90 min: There will be three added minutes.
 
90 min: Fojut half-heartedly shoots. And misses the target.
 
89 min: Stokes cuts in from the left and shoots over with his right boot. 
Hopefully there isn’t too much added time.
 
88 min: Johansen has been given man of the match. Deservedly so. He has been 
head and shoulders above the rest out there this afternoon.
 
What a dreadful take from Forrest. He’s passed it along the ground and 
straight at Cierzniak. He may have to answer some questions from Guidetti for 
that. It remains 0-2.
 
85 min: It’s all going terribly wrong now. Forrest is dragged down by Dixon. 
Forrest will take it despite an argument with Guidetti who also wants it.
 
83 min: Johansen has been really good today. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are pulling out the flicks and 
tricks now, teasing the United defence. Yet more cup final heartache for 
McNamara’s spirited side.
 
82 min: Henderson on for Bitton. That is Celtic’s final change of the game.
 
81 min: Erskine blasts well over at the other end. And lots of the United fans 
are heading for the exit.
 
79 min: Guidetti lays it off to Forrest, who picks his spot and side foots 
into the net with his right. That should be game over. It came after Morris 
made an incredible tackle to deny Guidetti initially but the ball broke kindly 
to Johansen who fed it back in.
 
79 min: Game, set and match, Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
78 min: Dow’s delivery is hesitantly cleared by a nervy looking Gordon.
 
78 min: Hope lives on for the Tangerines! Dixon wins a corner off Denayer!
 
77 min: A rare United attack sees Dow find Erskine but Van Dijk covers well 
and makes a good interception.
 
75 min: Van Dijk heads wide from close range under pressure from Morris.
 
73 min: Stokes shoots wide after a lovely dummy from Johansen after an 
Izaguirre cutback from the left endline.
 
72 min: Another United sub: Erskine on for Paton.
 
71 min: Celtic are dominating possession but Dundee United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> are still holding firm. 
Denayer is the latest to waste a chance to make it 2-0 when heading a Johansen 
cross over from five yards. Poor from the centre-half.
 
69 min: Double substitution for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> now as Griffiths and Commons make 
way for Guidetti and Forrest.
 
68 min: Stokes spots Ambrose free on the right. His cross meets Griffiths near 
the penalty spot but the strike has too much on it and it sails over.
 
66 min: McGowan has been defending well on the right, in the area vacated by 
Dillon, since United have dropped to 10 men but Griffiths finally manages to 
get a cross in towards Johansen. Fojut is in place to clear. But only back as 
far as that flank again. Griffiths drives another cross in towards the 
near-post. Johansen is on hand to shoot but Fojut disrupts him enough for the 
attempt to miss the target.
 
Simon McMahon, understandably, is feeling sorry for himself at the moment. 
He’s emailed in:

A Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> AND a 
Scotland supporter. I must have been a VERY bad person in a previous life.
 
62 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> should be looking 
for a second to kill the tie off now but the game has become quite ragged since 
the sending off.
 
60 min: Bilate, who looked the most lively of Dundee United’s attacking 
players, is off in place of Anier. Ambrose, meanwhile, looks OK to continue.
 
58 min: Now Paton is booked for lunging in on Ambrose, who is down injured.
 
55 min: The Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> 
captain comes in late and high on Izaguirre after a heavy touch near halfway. 
His studs are planted on the defender’s shin and the referee has no other 
option but to brandish the red card. There may not be any way back now.
 
54 min: United’s only obviously outlet to hurt Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> is for Dow to pick the ball up 
deep and find a Bilate run in front of him. They have options on the bench, 
mind, but how long before McNamara makes a change and goes for attack?
 
51 min: Just as I write that, United break through Bilate but his shot from 25 
yards is saved by Gordon, via a deflection off Denayer.
 
50 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have United 
pinned back. All 10 men in tangerine are stuck in their own half. Struggling to 
see what they can do to get back into this game apart from keep it to 1-0 and 
throw everything forward in the final 15 minutes.
 
47 min: Stokes plays a neat give-and-go with Izaguirre before firing a cross 
towards Griffiths, who dives but cannot connect.
 
46 min: Well they’ve started by winning a corner inside 40 seconds. Dixon 
takes it short to Dow. dow gives it back and Dixon hits it towards the 
back-post. It’s cleared.
 
Dundee United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited> restart at 
Hampden. Can they acquire enough attacking impetus to fashion a comeback?
 
45 min + 3: They both get up and appear OK. And that’s the break. Commons’ 
goal, with United down to 10 men while Dillon’s injury was being attended to, 
separates them on the scoreboard butCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have been utterly dominant.
 
45 min + 2: Play is stopped again after an accidental clash of heads between 
Johansen and Morris.
 
45 min +1: Johansen and Stokes play a beautiful one-two but Butcher makes an 
important interception. Corner, taken by Stokes, is cleared by Dillon. Commons 
takes down the clearance with his right and shoots with his left. Saved by 
Cierzniak.
 
45 min: There will be two minutes added time.
 
44 min: Shout for a Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
penalty as Griffiths goes down following a tangle with Fojut. It’s completely 
accidental and appears to be just outside the area. No matter, play continues 
despite the half-hearted claims.
 
42 min: Bit of a lull in play now. But Dillon is still not running freely – 
would not be surprised if there is a change at half-time.
 
39 min: Commons splits the United defence with a pass to Griffiths but 
Cierzniak is quick off his mark to hook the danger away.
 
36 min: … and from that United break. Bilate plays it to Dow who makes it into 
the area and hits the deck under pressure from Brown. There are claims for a 
penalty after Brown puts a very slight hand on his back but the referee waves 
play on to a chorus of boos from the Tangerines’ fans who are at the opposite 
end of the ground.
 
35 min: Commons turns after a Brown pass and shoots rapidly. Cierzniak is down 
to save. Celtic’s corner is taken by Stokes and cleared at the near post.
 
34 min: The Tangerines are getting a little tetchy now and McGowan is shown a 
yellow card for clattering Brown with a late challenge near halfway. Some mild 
shoving ensues and when it calms down against Stokes’ free-kick is claimed by 
Cierzniak.
