What a stinker of a start for Paul Clement at Derby. At the weekend, they 
couldn’t break down 10-man Bolton in a 0-0 draw, and now they’ve lost to a team 
two leagues below them. It’s way to early to make judgements on Clement’s 
tenure but they looked toothless going forward tonight against a very 
inexperienced Pompey defence: one shot on target all night, and that was 
Shackell’s goal from a corner.

On the flip side, Paul Cook is flying! He’s also brought in some relatively 
big names into the club this summer, but it is a good mixture between new faces 
and home-grown academy graduates, and it was those who shone brightest tonight: 
Adam Webster was a lion at the heart of Portsmouth’s defence, blocking and 
heading everything, and of course 18-year-old Conor Chaplin came off the bench 
to score a wonderful winner, just his second senior goal for Pompey.Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> are in the second-round draw, 
which will take place tomorrow evening.

Elsewhere tonight <https://www.theguardian.com/football/live>, there were 3-1 
wins for Preston at Crewe, and Middlesbrough at Oldham.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets, see you next time! Bye!

90+2 min: Martin gets the ball to feet and swivels and shoots on the turn, but 
it’s two yards wide. The home fans can smell victory, the first whistles start 
to emanate from the stands.

87 min: Stevens is forced to concede a corner, and Derby’s supporters roar 
them forward. Remember how Derby scored their goal. This time though, Webster 
wins the ball, as he has done for most of the night.

85 min: Pompey are trying to push out, but they can only pump it long and 
Derby come right back at them. Chaplin tries to dribble out, but the 5ft6in 
goalscorer is shrugged off easily by Thorne, who absolutely dwarfs the Pompey 
man.

79 min: Ooooooo was that a penalty?! Russell is absolutely chopped in half by 
Hollands on the very edge of Portsmouth’s area. The Scot definitely fell inside 
the box, but did the contact happen inside or out? Replays definitely suggest 
it was inside. Free-kick given, which Russell duly despatches three yards over 
the bar, before holding his head in his hands. A lucky break for the League Two 
side!

GOAL! Portsmouth 2-1 Derby County (Chaplin 76)

What an impact from the substitute! Pompey are ahead again, this goal was a 
cracker! Stevens latches onto a quite beautiful lofted pass down the left, and 
drives both a powerful and accurate low cross back towards the edge of the box. 
Such is the verve on the cross, Chaplin only has to worry about direction of 
his shot, and the ball pings off his right foot into the far corner. 2-1!
 Conor Chaplin, hidden left, fires in Portsmouth’s second goal. Photograph:

GOAL! Portsmouth 1-1 Derby County (Shackell 73)

Derby score with their first effort on target, and it comes from a corner. 
What did I say about the set-pieces? Derby didn’t look like scoring any other 
way. Shackell simply outjumps both Holland and Evans at the back post, and nods 
it past Jones. Bennett is coming off for Tollitt.

70 min: Both sides make a change. One Pompey academy graduate, Haunstrup, 
makes way for another, Conor Chaplin, who is 18-years-old but has been at the 
club since the age of six.

George Thorne, who had a loan spell at Pompey back in 2011/12 comes on for 
Ssewankambo.

63 min: Hollands gets a foot in on Baird and suddenly Bennett is one-on-one 
with Shackell. Fratton Park rises in anticipation, as it has every time the 
24-year-old has got the ball, but Derby’s new signing stands tall and blocks 
Bennett’s shot, before Evans launches the rebound a good five metres over the 
bar.

56 min: Chance for Stockley, saved by Grant … twice! Well the 32-year-old has 
gone a little way to redeeming himself there. Bennett, ever the menace, hangs a 
cross up that seems to take an eternity to find Stockley’s forehead at the back 
post. His initial header is blocked by Pearce, but the striker is quicker to 
find his feet and lashes the second ball straight into Grant’s mid-riff who did 
well to come off his line and close the angle. Davies tries again from another 
effort, but it’s a poor effort and Grant is able to gather.

54 min: Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> make 
their first change and surprisingly it’s the goalscorer McGurk who comes off to 
a standing ovation. Stevens, a starter for Pompey in the league at the weekend, 
comes on.

GOAL! Portsmouth 1-0 Derby (McGurk 49)

A howler from Derby keeper Grant! He lost his first team place to Scott Carson 
at the weekend, and has done himself no favours here. Stockley pulls right on 
the right, has time to deliver a cross and McGurk, running from deep, beats 
Pearce in the air. It’s not a particularly powerful header, and not really even 
in the corner, but Grant just palms it inside his own post. Absolute shocker! 
We’ve got another upset on our hands!
 Lee Grant lets Adam McGurk’s header go through his hands and into the net.

47 min: Weimann gets a run on Clarke but fires his shot into the side-netting.

I can’t overstate just how low this camera angle is. Sky are continuing to 
apologise for it, as Paul Merson gives his own unique take on first-half 
proceedings.

“Are there other stadiums that have such a camera setup?” asks J.R.?

Tottenham in the Europa League? Or West Ham’s new-ish one?

 Here’s the ridiculously low camera angle. Photograph: Sky Sports

“As a Derby fan I assure you that Paulo Wanchope is indeed peak legend at 
Pride Park,” emails Sam Kammerling. “He scored this goal against Man Utd on his 
flipping debut. He was also hilarious to watch running, and had that lazy magic 
of Berbatov about him - he would do bugger all for an hour then produce the 
kind of skill that would make you drool. Although, I have always had a tendency 
to over-salivate, so the drooling might be subjective.”


I can assure you Sam, I was drooling right there with you. Possibly my 
favourite Central/South American to play in the Premier League? Any other 
shouts? Maybe Juninho?

45 min: Hendrick plays a one-two to get away from Hollands and drives into 
Pompey’s box, but his left-foot shot is weak and flies two or three yards wide. 
Jones had it well covered.

42 min: An email from J.R. in Illinois. “Am I correct in assuming that we have 
the same feed of this game in the US that you have there? The main camera angle 
they are using is practically at pitch level and very close to the pitch which 
makes it very challenging (read: impossible) to get any sort of wider view of 
the proceedings.”

Imagine if you’re trying to do an MBM report on it! This is actually down to a 
“health and safety” issue, according to Sky Sports, which means they can’t 
mount their cameras in the normal position.

36 min: Pompey’s energy levels have been so high so far, but as the half ebbs 
on, they appear to be fading. Russell is becoming increasingly dominant, in 
that space between midfield and attack and when Derby turn it on, Pompey can’t 
live with them. Russell isn’t tracked as he gets to the byline and he dribbles 
into the six yard box and cuts back, but somehow Dawkins can’t turn it in. 
Pompey hanging on a bit now.

33 min: Evans is adjudged to have felled Hendrick and Derby have a promising 
set-piece outside Portsmouth’s box. It’s fairly central and Russell strikes it, 
but Holland jumps like a salmon in the wall and nods it away. How often do we 
see a player duck out of that? League Two doesn’t duck.

30 min: First real chance for Derby! Dawkins skips round a challenge and after 
some slick interplay with Weimann, Forsyth gets to the byline and cuts back to 
Hendrick, who takes a touch, shoots but sees his effort deflected behind after 
a magnificent block by Webster. What a block.

28 min: Ben Close looks a real gem in the middle of that Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> midfield. Lots of neat little 
touches, the academy graduate really glides across the term. The 19-year-old is 
not afraid of a challenge either, despite his slight frame, tracking back well 
to deny Darren Bent on a Derby counter-attack.

he dropped down a division from Doncaster to play atPortsmouth

19 min: Derby have their first prolonged period of play and it’s Jonny Russell 
at the heart of it, probing and sniping. He gets half a yard on the right and 
floats a cross to the back post, but Clarke just beats Bent to the ball.

16 min: Bennett has had a storming start, dropping deep into space and neither 
Hendrick or Baird are picking him up. First the Pompey man tracks back to win a 
free-kick and then he drives forward, cutting inside and unleashing a shot just 
wide of Grant’s near post.

14 min: Davies has the freedom of Fratton Park on this right-hand side. He 
crosses deep but it deflects off Ssewankambo and goes out for a corner. He’s 
had a nervy start on his debut. The corner is cleared.

12 min: Portsmouth’s pressure continues: the ball pinballs around Derby’s box, 
and Shackell half clears, and McGurk flashes a low cross-shot across the area 
which is just behind Stockley at the far post!

5 min: Pompey have started very nicely, popping the ball about. They don’t 
seem to be intimidated at all. Close and Hollands play a one-two to escape 
Baird and Haunstrup gets forward to deliver a cross, but it’s well gathered by 
Grant.

3 min: First Bent, then Weimann make inroads down Portsmouth’s right, but the 
ball is just too strong. Davies aside, this is a very youngPortsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> defence, and a very 
experienced Derby attack.

Ben Davies brings out the home side to a raucous crowd. They have made seven 
changes since their win over Dagenham and Redbridge.

Chris Baird, captain for the night and formerly of Southampton, leads out 
Derby, dressed all in white. He is one of only three players that played for 
Derby at Bolton. Alex Pearce and Isak Ssewankambo, who played with Chelsea in 
his youth.

Preamble

Derby fans, you’ve probably already had enough excitement today, haven’t you?

Firstly there was that was warm pang of nostalgia after footage emerged that 
Rams legend Paolo Wanchope had panged the heck out of a nobody at a Costa Rica 
Under-23 match. Actually I’m not sure it was Wanchope that did the chopping or 
that he qualifies as a County legend, seeing as he was only there for two 
seasons in the late 90s, but for the purposes of this preamble … he did! He is!
Pang! Chop! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/aug/12/former-manchester-city-striker-paulo-wanchope-punch-up-costa-rica-video>
Speaking of a man that likes a scrap, Joey Barton is fast approaching over the 
horizon. After the scouser wasbrushed off the porch of West Ham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/11/west-ham-joey-barton-deal-protests-supporters>
 late last night, like a hard rock guitar solo in the late 1980s, the odds have 
been Slashed to nearly evens for the 32-year-old to sign for Derby on a free 
transfer. Barton would presumably be employed to fill the void created byWill 
Hughes’s knee injury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/11/will-hughes-derby-county-six-months-out-surgery-anterior-cruciate-ligament>
, which is expected to keep the youngster out for six months.

A violent video, a transfer rumour: Rams fans, have you enough energy to even 
contemplate aCapital One Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup> first-round tie against 
Portsmouth? Of course you have!

After sleeping through Saturday’s 0-0 snoozefest, in which Derby failed to 
overcome 10-man Bolton, Derby’s fans could probably do with some excitement. 
Under new manager ex-Real Madrid assistant manager Paul Clement, the club are 
among the favourites for promotion from the Championship this season, and have 
made a some big-name signings including Tom Ince (on a permanent deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/03/tom-ince-derby-county-hull-permanent-transfer>
),Jason Shackell from Burnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/23/jason-shackell-derby-burnley-sky-bet-transfer-fund>
, andAndreas Weimann from Aston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/18/andreas-weimann-derby-county-aston-villa>
. Clement and co will be hoping for a confidence-boosting win tonight to get 
their season up-and-running: with Charlton at home on Saturday, the squad may 
well be rotated, but we should see Darren Bent, who was an unused substitute 
against Bolton.

Portsmouth love a cup run. And whilst the halcyon days of 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/18/facup.portsmouth> are but a 
distant memory, Pompey are on the up. They League Two side are also favourites 
to win their division, and now managed by Paul Cook, who won this division with 
Chesterfield two seasons ago and led them to the League One play-off semi-final 
in May. He has made a host of signings, including the wily Michael Doyle from 
Sheffield United and Kyle Bennett, who scored twice on his debut against 
Dagenham and Redbridge at the weekend.

Portsmouth remain a huge club and the fans, who now own the club, will revel 
in hosting this cup tie.We saw upsets a plenty last night

close  
What a stinker of a start for Paul Clement at Derby. At the weekend, they 
couldn’t break down 10-man Bolton in a 0-0 draw, and now they’ve lost to a team 
two leagues below them. It’s way to early to make judgements on Clement’s 
tenure but they looked toothless going forward tonight against a very 
inexperienced Pompey defence: one shot on target all night, and that was 
Shackell’s goal from a corner.

On the flip side, Paul Cook is flying! He’s also brought in some relatively 
big names into the club this summer, but it is a good mixture between new faces 
and home-grown academy graduates, and it was those who shone brightest tonight: 
Adam Webster was a lion at the heart of Portsmouth’s defence, blocking and 
heading everything, and of course 18-year-old Conor Chaplin came off the bench 
to score a wonderful winner, just his second senior goal for Pompey.Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> are in the second-round draw, 
which will take place tomorrow evening.

Elsewhere tonight <https://www.theguardian.com/football/live>, there were 3-1 
wins for Preston at Crewe, and Middlesbrough at Oldham.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets, see you next time! Bye!

 
There are now eight Championship sides that have been dumped out of the 
Capital One Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup> in this 
first round!

Andrew Couldridge/Reuters  
90+4 min: Thorne is booked for trying to win the ball back. He didn’t succeed. 
 
90+2 min: Martin gets the ball to feet and swivels and shoots on the turn, but 
it’s two yards wide. The home fans can smell victory, the first whistles start 
to emanate from the stands.
 
90+1 min: Corner to Derby. But there’s a streaker on the pitch. And breathe. 
 
90 min: Four minutes added on for injury time. 
 
89 min: Derby optimistically appeal for a penalty shout after Forsyth’s cross 
is blocked by Davies with a mixture of hip and arm. Nothing doing.
 
87 min: Stevens is forced to concede a corner, and Derby’s supporters roar 
them forward. Remember how Derby scored their goal. This time though, Webster 
wins the ball, as he has done for most of the night.
 
85 min: Pompey are trying to push out, but they can only pump it long and 
Derby come right back at them. Chaplin tries to dribble out, but the 5ft6in 
goalscorer is shrugged off easily by Thorne, who absolutely dwarfs the Pompey 
man.
 
83 min: “As a neutral, the ridiculous camera angle adds an entertaining sense 
of peril,” emails Matt Dony. “Half the passes being hit, you have no idea where 
they’re going. It could be a magnificent through-ball, it could be a tame scuff 
to the opposition. It’s exciting finding out! Also, bet Tom Ince is glad he 
turned down Inter for this...”
 
81 min: Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> now have 
every man behind the ball. Backs-to-the-wall stuff now as Derby pour forward, 
with Ince the lead orchestrator.
 
79 min: Ooooooo was that a penalty?! Russell is absolutely chopped in half by 
Hollands on the very edge of Portsmouth’s area. The Scot definitely fell inside 
the box, but did the contact happen inside or out? Replays definitely suggest 
it was inside. Free-kick given, which Russell duly despatches three yards over 
the bar, before holding his head in his hands. A lucky break for the League Two 
side!
 
What an impact from the substitute! Pompey are ahead again, this goal was a 
cracker! Stevens latches onto a quite beautiful lofted pass down the left, and 
drives both a powerful and accurate low cross back towards the edge of the box. 
Such is the verve on the cross, Chaplin only has to worry about direction of 
his shot, and the ball pings off his right foot into the far corner. 2-1!

Shaun Boggust/Colorsport/Corbis  Happy happy joy joy.  
Derby score with their first effort on target, and it comes from a corner. 
What did I say about the set-pieces? Derby didn’t look like scoring any other 
way. Shackell simply outjumps both Holland and Evans at the back post, and nods 
it past Jones. Bennett is coming off for Tollitt.

70 min: Both sides make a change. One Pompey academy graduate, Haunstrup, 
makes way for another, Conor Chaplin, who is 18-years-old but has been at the 
club since the age of six.

George Thorne, who had a loan spell at Pompey back in 2011/12 comes on for 
Ssewankambo.
 
68 min: Paul Cook looks relaxed on the sidelines, laughing. Paul Cook never 
laughs. He shouts. That’s what he does. What is going on?
 
66 min: Bennett is in the throng of things again, pulling left and feeding 
Stevens, who is now playing at left-back. It’s aPortsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> corner but again they have no 
luck. Derby have had the better of them at set-pieces tonight. At least that’s 
something Rams fans …
 
63 min: Hollands gets a foot in on Baird and suddenly Bennett is one-on-one 
with Shackell. Fratton Park rises in anticipation, as it has every time the 
24-year-old has got the ball, but Derby’s new signing stands tall and blocks 
Bennett’s shot, before Evans launches the rebound a good five metres over the 
bar.
 
60 min: Clement has seen enough, here come the big boys: Ince and Martin are 
coming on for Dawkins and Bent, who has had the fewer touches than anyone else 
on the pitch including the two goalkeepers. In fairness, the service to him has 
been poor. Still …
 
59 min: Davies is penalised for tugging back Forsyth. Cheap foul. But it’s 
well headed away by Webster. Another Pompey academy graduate, the 20-year-old 
has been a rock all night.
 
56 min: Chance for Stockley, saved by Grant … twice! Well the 32-year-old has 
gone a little way to redeeming himself there. Bennett, ever the menace, hangs a 
cross up that seems to take an eternity to find Stockley’s forehead at the back 
post. His initial header is blocked by Pearce, but the striker is quicker to 
find his feet and lashes the second ball straight into Grant’s mid-riff who did 
well to come off his line and close the angle. Davies tries again from another 
effort, but it’s a poor effort and Grant is able to gather.
 
54 min: Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> make 
their first change and surprisingly it’s the goalscorer McGurk who comes off to 
a standing ovation. Stevens, a starter for Pompey in the league at the weekend, 
comes on.
 
51 min: “1-0 on our big day out!” chant the Pompey faithful. Derby manager 
Clement stands unmovved on the touchline, his arms crossed. Oh, I bet the 
Bernabéu seems a long way away now, Paul!
 
A howler from Derby keeper Grant! He lost his first team place to Scott Carson 
at the weekend, and has done himself no favours here. Stockley pulls right on 
the right, has time to deliver a cross and McGurk, running from deep, beats 
Pearce in the air. It’s not a particularly powerful header, and not really even 
in the corner, but Grant just palms it inside his own post. Absolute shocker! 
We’ve got another upset on our hands!

47 min: Weimann gets a run on Clarke but fires his shot into the side-netting. 
That boy has really got wheels when he wants to get going.
 
Peeeep peeeep! And we’re underway again. No changes made by either side.

Elsewhere, other Capital One Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup> half-time scores are as 
follows:

Crewe 1-2 Preston
Oldham 0-2 Middlesbrough
 
I can’t overstate just how low this camera angle is. Sky are continuing to 
apologise for it, as Paul Merson gives his own unique take on first-half 
proceedings.

“Are there other stadiums that have such a camera setup?” asks J.R.?

Tottenham in the Europa League? Or West Ham’s new-ish one?

 Here’s the ridiculously low camera angle. Photograph: Sky Sports  
“As a Derby fan I assure you that Paulo Wanchope is indeed peak legend at 
Pride Park,” emails Sam Kammerling. “He scored this goal against Man Utd on his 
flipping debut. He was also hilarious to watch running, and had that lazy magic 
of Berbatov about him - he would do bugger all for an hour then produce the 
kind of skill that would make you drool. Although, I have always had a tendency 
to over-salivate, so the drooling might be subjective.”


I can assure you Sam, I was drooling right there with you. Possibly my 
favourite Central/South American to play in the Premier League? Any other 
shouts? Maybe Juninho?

We’re all square at the break.
 
45 min: Hendrick plays a one-two to get away from Hollands and drives into 
Pompey’s box, but his left-foot shot is weak and flies two or three yards wide. 
Jones had it well covered.
 
42 min: An email from J.R. in Illinois. “Am I correct in assuming that we have 
the same feed of this game in the US that you have there? The main camera angle 
they are using is practically at pitch level and very close to the pitch which 
makes it very challenging (read: impossible) to get any sort of wider view of 
the proceedings.”

Imagine if you’re trying to do an MBM report on it! This is actually down to a 
“health and safety” issue, according to Sky Sports, which means they can’t 
mount their cameras in the normal position.
  Portsmouth’s Ben Davies gets to grips with Derby County’s Andreas Weimann. 
Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters  
39 min: Forsyth almost falls off the pitch as he tiptoes down the touchline, 
the pitch falls away very sharply as soon as you stray outside the white lines 
here!
 
36 min: Pompey’s energy levels have been so high so far, but as the half ebbs 
on, they appear to be fading. Russell is becoming increasingly dominant, in 
that space between midfield and attack and when Derby turn it on, Pompey can’t 
live with them. Russell isn’t tracked as he gets to the byline and he dribbles 
into the six yard box and cuts back, but somehow Dawkins can’t turn it in. 
Pompey hanging on a bit now.
 
33 min: Evans is adjudged to have felled Hendrick and Derby have a promising 
set-piece outside Portsmouth’s box. It’s fairly central and Russell strikes it, 
but Holland jumps like a salmon in the wall and nods it away. How often do we 
see a player duck out of that? League Two doesn’t duck.
 
30 min: First real chance for Derby! Dawkins skips round a challenge and after 
some slick interplay with Weimann, Forsyth gets to the byline and cuts back to 
Hendrick, who takes a touch, shoots but sees his effort deflected behind after 
a magnificent block by Webster. What a block.
 
28 min: Ben Close looks a real gem in the middle of that Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> midfield. Lots of neat little 
touches, the academy graduate really glides across the term. The 19-year-old is 
not afraid of a challenge either, despite his slight frame, tracking back well 
to deny Darren Bent on a Derby counter-attack.
  Pompey’s Gareth Evans and Derby’s Darren Bent go up for a header. Photograph: 
James Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock  
25 min: Bennett has another pot-shot, he’s a real livewire. Strange to think 
he dropped down a division from Doncaster to play atPortsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth>, but I guess that still shows 
what a pull this south-coast club still have.
 
23 min: Pompey win another corner, with Shackell slicing his clearance behind, 
but again the home side can’t make anything of it.

Elsewhere tonight, Middlesbrough have taken a 1-0 lead at Oldham through Yanic 
Wilschut. Preston, who played out a 0-0 draw with Boro on Sunday, are 2-0 up at 
Crewe. You can follow the latest live scores of all tonight’s gameshere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live>.
 
21 min: Baird bring the ball out of defence. “Stand up if you hate the scum” 
shout thePortsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> fans. 
Baird was at Southampton for six years, remember.
 
19 min: Derby have their first prolonged period of play and it’s Jonny Russell 
at the heart of it, probing and sniping. He gets half a yard on the right and 
floats a cross to the back post, but Clarke just beats Bent to the ball.
 
16 min: Bennett has had a storming start, dropping deep into space and neither 
Hendrick or Baird are picking him up. First the Pompey man tracks back to win a 
free-kick and then he drives forward, cutting inside and unleashing a shot just 
wide of Grant’s near post.
 Kyle Bennett fires a shot towards the Derby goal. Photograph: James 
Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock  
14 min: Davies has the freedom of Fratton Park on this right-hand side. He 
crosses deep but it deflects off Ssewankambo and goes out for a corner. He’s 
had a nervy start on his debut. The corner is cleared.
 
12 min: Portsmouth’s pressure continues: the ball pinballs around Derby’s box, 
and Shackell half clears, and McGurk flashes a low cross-shot across the area 
which is just behind Stockley at the far post!
 
10 min: Derby haven’t had a kick so far.
 
8 min: Free-kick to Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> inside Derby’s half and the 
cavalry, Webster and Clarke, on loan from Ipswich, canter up from the back. But 
it’s again too strong a delivery by Davies, formerly of Derby.
 
5 min: Pompey have started very nicely, popping the ball about. They don’t 
seem to be intimidated at all. Close and Hollands play a one-two to escape 
Baird and Haunstrup gets forward to deliver a cross, but it’s well gathered by 
Grant.
 
3 min: First Bent, then Weimann make inroads down Portsmouth’s right, but the 
ball is just too strong. Davies aside, this is a very youngPortsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> defence, and a very 
experienced Derby attack.
 
Peeep peeep! We’re off!
 
Ben Davies brings out the home side to a raucous crowd. They have made seven 
changes since their win over Dagenham and Redbridge.

Chris Baird, captain for the night and formerly of Southampton, leads out 
Derby, dressed all in white. He is one of only three players that played for 
Derby at Bolton. Alex Pearce and Isak Ssewankambo, who played with Chelsea in 
his youth.
 
Doesn’t seem Will Hughes is all that put off by the prospect of surgery on his 
knee then …
Will Hughes (@wjhughes19) 
Mmmmm morphine

Craig Bryson is also sidelined after injuring his knee at Bolton: he’ll be 
ruled out for two to four weeks.
 
The teams:

Portsmouth: Jones, Davies, Webster, Clarke, Haunstrup, Hollands, Close, Evans, 
McGurk, Bennett, Stockley.Subs: Stevens, Burgess, Tubbs, Tollitt, Chaplin, 
Murphy, Atangana.

Derby: Grant, Ssewankambo, Pearce, Shackell, Forsyth, Baird, Hendrick, 
Russell, Dawkins, Weimann, Bent.Subs: Keogh, Martin, Carson, Ince, Hanson, 
Thorne, Warnock.

 
Derby fans, you’ve probably already had enough excitement today, haven’t you?

Firstly there was that was warm pang of nostalgia after footage emerged that 
Rams legend Paolo Wanchope had panged the heck out of a nobody at a Costa Rica 
Under-23 match. Actually I’m not sure it was Wanchope that did the chopping or 
that he qualifies as a County legend, seeing as he was only there for two 
seasons in the late 90s, but for the purposes of this preamble … he did! He is!
Pang! Chop! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/aug/12/former-manchester-city-striker-paulo-wanchope-punch-up-costa-rica-video>
Speaking of a man that likes a scrap, Joey Barton is fast approaching over the 
horizon. After the scouser wasbrushed off the porch of West Ham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/11/west-ham-joey-barton-deal-protests-supporters>
 late last night, like a hard rock guitar solo in the late 1980s, the odds have 
been Slashed to nearly evens for the 32-year-old to sign for Derby on a free 
transfer. Barton would presumably be employed to fill the void created byWill 
Hughes’s knee injury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/11/will-hughes-derby-county-six-months-out-surgery-anterior-cruciate-ligament>
, which is expected to keep the youngster out for six months.

A violent video, a transfer rumour: Rams fans, have you enough energy to even 
contemplate aCapital One Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup> first-round tie against 
Portsmouth? Of course you have!

After sleeping through Saturday’s 0-0 snoozefest, in which Derby failed to 
overcome 10-man Bolton, Derby’s fans could probably do with some excitement. 
Under new manager ex-Real Madrid assistant manager Paul Clement, the club are 
among the favourites for promotion from the Championship this season, and have 
made a some big-name signings including Tom Ince (on a permanent deal

, andAndreas Weimann from Aston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/18/andreas-weimann-derby-county-aston-villa>
. Clement and co will be hoping for a confidence-boosting win tonight to get 
their season up-and-running: with Charlton at home on Saturday, the squad may 
well be rotated, but we should see Darren Bent, who was an unused substitute 
against Bolton.

Portsmouth love a cup run. And whilst the halcyon days of 2008

distant memory, Pompey are on the up. They League Two side are also favourites

Chesterfield two seasons ago and led them to the League One play-off semi-final 
in May. He has made a host of signings, including the wily Michael Doyle from 
Sheffield United and Kyle Bennett, who scored twice on his debut against 
Dagenham and Redbridge at the weekend.
