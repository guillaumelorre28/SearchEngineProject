The Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> assistant manager, 
John Collins, has revealed Anthony Stokes will go out on loan but insists his 
career at the club is not necessarily over.

The Republic of Ireland forward has been frozen out of Ronny Deila’s plans 
this season, playing just twice, and was recentlysuspended for two weeks

 for tweeting his dissatisfaction at being left out of the squad after 
travelling to Inverness.

The Caley Thistle manager, John Hughes, who was in charge of the 27-year-old 
at Falkirk and Hibernian, has inquired about the possibility of teaming up with 
the player again.

Asked if allowing Stokes to leave on loan signalled the end of his career at 
Parkhead, Collins said: “It signals it for the rest of this season if he goes 
on loan.

“But you never know in football. The door is always open. The manager and 
Anthony have decided it would be good for him to get some game time.

“There has been a relationship with those two [Hughes and Stokes] before, they 
have worked well with each other in the past so it might be a good place for 
Anthony to go.

“There are other teams interested as well but we won’t force him to go where 
he doesn’t want to go, it will be his choice. He has to go away, score goals 
and play well, that is what football is all about.

“His attitude lately in training has been very good so hopefully he has turned 
the corner. But he needs games.”

On speculation that Aiden McGeady could return from Everton, Collins, speaking 
ahead of the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie against Stranraer at Stair Park on 
Sunday, said: “I don’t think it was realistic. He is a Premier League player on 
Premier League wages.

“We have always got to be realistic. We have budgets and there is a big gap 
between the Premier League and the Championship and our league. I would rule 
that out, yes.”
