Our content has now been served over HTTPS 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS> for two months and we thought it was time 
to share some of the reasons, processes and challenges behind the project.


The reasons for our move 


Privacy 

By using HTTPS, internet service providers (ISPs) are not able to track 
<https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ISPsAreThreats> the pages our 
readers are accessing. It means we protect the privacy of our readers when 
accessing content that may disclose political opinions, faith, sexual 
orientation or any information that may be used against them. It matches our 
core values. We believe that protecting our visitors is good internet 
citizenship.

Security

Once on HTTPS, we prevent malicious third parties from inserting code into our 
site, or tracking what our visitors are doing.

SEO

It also gives us other benefits such as a potential increase in search 
results. For the reasons mentioned above Googlehas announced that it will 
favour https content 
<https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/12/indexing-https-pages-by-default.html>
. It is also helping us decipher traffic from secure and ‘unknown’ referrers.

Content authoring and integrity

By switching to HTTPS, browsers will ensure that the content displayed is 
actually published by the Guardian. Without HTTPS someone between the browser 
and our website could maliciously display other content or alter our content.

New features

 It allows us to take advantage of emerging technologies, such as service 
workers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/aug/19/how-we-made-the-riorun-progressive-web-app>
, web notifications, ‘add to homescreen’ prompts and offline web pages. This is 
critical to developing relationships with audiences who are either unable to, 
or choose not to download the app, such as the majority of audiences in South 
America or India.

Revenues

Network and internet providers will not be able to inject ads 
<http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/>
 and profit from the Guardian’s content without the Guardian being reimbursed.

Why has this taken so long?




Editorial challenges

We had several specific challenges in front of us:

 *  avoiding negative audience and revenue impacts 
For a long time ad agencies and ad exchange networks have not adopted HTTPS 
<https://rrees.me/2014/04/27/why-dont-online-publishers-use-https/>, 
jeopardising revenues of any free mainstream website willing to switch to 
HTTPS. Despite Google’s willingness and actions on this subject 
<https://security.googleblog.com/2015/04/ads-take-step-towards-https-everywhere.html>
 there was a risk of having a negative impact we could not afford.

 * continuing to allow embeds to be inserted in articles 
Our articles often contain various external components such as YouTube videos 
or tweets. For each of them we had to find a way to embed them securely or 
another solution if the providers did not support HTTPS.

 * keeping our older interactives working 
Interactive content <https://www.theguardian.com/interactive> is created 
differently to our standard articles with a lot of variation in technologies 
used over the years and without HTTPS being a concern at the time.

Approach & techniques

The migration was such a big change that it was not possible to highlight all 
the problems at the beginning of the project, nor find a solution on paper for 
each of them. We had to work iteratively and solve these issues as they arose.

 To overcome those challenges rather than draw a big plan we decided to defeat 
in detail <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail>:

 * Migrate one small audience section to HTTPS 
 * Identify the problems and track them 
 * Fix the problems that need to be fixed before the next section migration  <>

 Evolution of The Guardian HTTPS traffic 
One advantage of this strategy is that it enabled us to detect real problems 
rather than discussing hypothetical ones and improve our confidence step by 
step.


We have complemented this approach with 3 techniques:

 * Monitoring 
We closely monitored audience numbers, revenues, mixed content 
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content> warnings 
and errors after each section migration.


 * Decoupling backends and frontend migrations 
We migrated our backend systems before the frontend. Our content API 
<http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/> was returning HTTPS links 
for all content ahead of time and we updated our internal tools and 
integrations to support the new scheme at an early stage. By doing this we 
ensured that any problems we found as part of a section migration to HTTPS were 
limited to the website itself and could be identified quickly.

 * Usage of early adopters 
We added the ability for users to enable the entire website to HTTPS. We 
offered this ability to readers willing to report issues andencouraged our 
engineers to enable this feature 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food>. We enabled us to 
discover several issues before they were seen by end users. At the same time we 
ensured that our journalists were shown this secure version of the site when 
previewing content. This allowed us to capture any further unknown issues and 
find solutions to problems early on.

How did we technically migrate?


Conditional redirection to HTTPS

To enable a migration per section we have leveraged the capability of our CDN 
provider <https://www.fastly.com/> to write easily and apply very fast 
redirection rules based on the path of the request (our path contains the 
section of an article).

We used this, not the upgrade-insecure-requests 
<https://www.w3.org/TR/upgrade-insecure-requests/#upgrade_insecure_requests> 
option for two reasons. Most importantly, this feature was (and is currently 
still) notsupported by enough browsers 
<http://caniuse.com/#feat=upgradeinsecurerequests>. Secondly the specification 
isquite complex 
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31950470/what-is-the-upgrade-insecure-requests-http-header>
 and interaction with HSTS 
<https://www.w3.org/TR/upgrade-insecure-requests/#hsts> was not crystal clear 
to us and HSTS was our final goal. This meant that, sadly, the
upgrade-insecure-requests feature was not useful to us in practice.

Content-Security-Policy <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP>
 with report only

This feature 
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only>
 has enabled us to log all mixed mode warning and errors and analyse them 
later. Passive content was still displayed, so minimising impact for the end 
users. We switched toblock only recently when we were confident there would be 
almost no impact.

Rewriting of old content

To migrate historic interactive content we wrote a simple script to update a 
predefined list of urls to HTTPS. We migrated most of the interactive archive 
using this tool before enabling HTTPS on them.

HSTS header

The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header 
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security>
 lets a web site inform the browser that it should never load the site using 
HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using 
HTTP to HTTPS requests instead. It is intended to protect against
man-in-the-middle attacks 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack> such as SSL stripping 
<http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-09/Marlinspike/BlackHat-DC-09-Marlinspike-Defeating-SSL.pdf>
.

We added this header at the very end of the migration after all sections were 
redirected to HTTPS, which meant we were extremely confident that adding the 
header would not have any negative impact.

Removal of short urls

Before Twitter stopped counting url characters 
<https://blog.twitter.com/2016/doing-more-with-140-characters> and forced all 
urls to be shortened by its own service 
<https://support.twitter.com/articles/109623> short urls had a utility. This is 
no longer the case. Our short url implementation also had a negative impact on 
latency as it was forcing the browser to perform three redirects. This is
clearly something you want to avoid with HTTPS 
<https://www.keycdn.com/blog/https-performance-overhead/>, so we simply decided 
to stop using them <https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/13568>.

Acknowledgements


This outcome is the result of great collaboration between our editorial, 
commercial and digital departments. We would like to thank every individual 
that has been involved in this work and will leave the final word to David:

When I uttered the words “what are the challenges of making our website wholly 
https?” back in 2013 I knew that things were not straightforward. I could only 
have guessed at the actual complexity. At least everybody agreed it was 
actually a good thing we should aim to do with the Snowden revelations at the 
time, but this was not like setting up a site from scratch. The benefits of 
moving to HTTPS and ultimately HSTS were understood. Extending users extra 
privacy from monitoring and engendering trust from authenticity of the site are 
all not only good security practice but elements of building a better 
relationship with your consumers. The other contributors to this blog will 
explain far more eloquently then me, but essentially we have almost built from 
scratch by migrating hosting and CMS components all in the past 3 years. The 
site you see now is triumph of design and effort. Well done to all involved.
