Paris Saint-Germain’s League Cup quarter-final was halted for 15 minutes when 
furious St-Etienne supporters threw objects on to the pitch after Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic’s controversial winner.

The pressure was firmly on the PSG manager, Laurent Blanc, following 
Saturday’s 4-2 defeat at Bastia – his side’s third straight league game without 
a win – and the relief was evident at the final whistle as several players 
congratulated the understudy goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez.

However, it was Ibrahimovic’s 72nd-minute winner that provided the biggest 
talking point of the night.

The Sweden striker had seen two first-half efforts saved by the St-Etienne 
goalkeeper, Stéphane Ruffier, before he chested in Lucas’s cross from the 
right. Ruffier was adamant he had scooped the ball away before it crossed the 
line and, although replays showed the goal had been correctly awarded, the home 
fans made their displeasure known.

Objects including a plastic bottle were thrown at the match officials, 
prompting the referee, Saïd Ennjimi, to take the players’ off the field as a 
precautionary measure.

The match resumed after the St-Etienne coach, Christophe Galtier, had urged 
supporters to calm down and PSG held on for a badly needed victory.
