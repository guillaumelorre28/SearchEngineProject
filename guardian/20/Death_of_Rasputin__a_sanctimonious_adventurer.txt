 The mysterious end of the famous Russian religious adventurer Rasputin removes 
from Russian life a figure whose importance is measured not so much by the 
magnitude of his own personality as by the conditions of society which enabled 
him to flourish. Grishka Rasputin, the 'Starets', stands for those 'dark 
forces' of Russian public life of which we have heard so much lately, in the 
Duma debates, in various Russian public speeches and other reports from Russia.
It is not edifying to contemplate this figure of a religious charlatan who had 
risen to an unprecedented position in certain higher circles of Petrograd 
society. To begin with, his very name would be an insurmountable barrier for 
any man who had similar ambitions in any other country. He started life with a 
contemptuous abbreviation of his full Christian name (Gregory) and a surname 
which is a derivation of the adjective rasputny, meaning 'loose living'.

This is not surprising considering his parentage. His father was a 
good-for-nothing scamp of a peasant, without any regular occupation, and who 
had dark antecedents. As is common in Siberia, where there are so many men 
'without a name', i.e. with a past over which they prefer to throw a veil, his 
father does not seem to have had a regular surname. So he was nicknamed 
'Rasputin' in keeping with his reputation...

...Whether he was a mystic or a charlatan, or a mixture of both elements, a 
mixture well known to neuro-pathologists, it is certain that his death removes 
from Russian life a most sinister and dangerous figure.
