Scandinavian food has enjoyed its time in the spotlight the last few years, 
but some dishes and food traditions are easier to export than others. And one 
dish that is unlikely to gain popularity outside our borders issurströmming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/feb/07/umea-sweden-food-european-capital-culture>
 – Sweden’s infamous fermented herring.

Eaten since the 16th century, this is herring caught just before spawning, 
then fermented with enough salt to stop it from rotting, then packed into tins 
and left for at least six months.

In northern Sweden, surströmming is a delicacy – and the surströmming season 
(for two weeks from the third Thursday in August) is celebrated with parties 
where aficionados gather in gardens to sample the delights. I use the term 
“delights” loosely, for when you open a tin, the smell is so overpowering most 
people run for cover. One only has to Google “surströmming” to see the effects 
of the smell on people who are not accustomed to it. It has frequently been 
voted the most putrid food smell in the world.

That said, once the smell from the pressurised tin dissipates, you are left 
with little fillets of herring that are then put ontotunnbröd (flatbread) and 
topped with sliced new potato, chopped red onion and sour cream. You wrap it 
all up and eat it – and it does taste rather nice.

Only a few restaurants serve it – one is Restaurant Hjerta in Stockholm 
<http://restauranghjerta.se/en>, which has an outdoor surströmming party on 23 
September – but it is widely available in supermarkets.

Surströmming should always be refrigerated even when unopened – and must only 
be opened outdoors. You have been warned.

For a food item that is easier to fall in love with, look to the Swedish 
obsession with smoked, creamed cod roe called smörgåskaviar. One brand of it, 
Kalles Kaviar, is sold in little blue tubes in stores that are also famous for 
selling bookshelves. It’s salty, creamy and delicious and can be used on many a 
sandwich, usually with egg in some form. I love it with poached egg and avocado 
on toast in the morning.
