and Aaron Wilbraham’s 19th goal of the season wrapped up the points in the 87th 
minute, the striker finishing well from Freeman’s cut-back.

Kyle Bennett put Rovers ahead in the 17th minute, cutting inside to curl the 
ball into the top corner. United levelled in the 29th minute from the spot 
after Jamie McCombe upended Matt Done and Jose Baxter made no mistake.

flicking Steven Davies’ cross in off the post, moments after James Coppinger 
had hit the woodwork at the other end.

2-2 on the hour only for Davies to win it for United with a superb curling 
effort 19 minutes from time.
