How guilty (if at all) would you feel after eating the following animals? If 
you’re a vegetarian or vegan, you can instead ask yourself how you would feel 
about a friend or family member who ate each of these animals.

a) chicken

b) tapir (a large mammal used for food in some South American cultures)

c) zebra (one of the latest health-food trends)

d) dog (eaten in some parts of China and Korea)

If you said that it gets worse as you move from a) to d) then – like most of 
us – your attitudes to eating animals are certainly illogical, and perhaps even 
a little self-serving.

A recent study conducted at Lancaster University found that (meat-eating) 
participants rated it as morally worse to eat an animal that is commonly used 
for food in a different culture (eg tapir) than their own culture (eg chicken).

Now, does it make a difference if I tell you that zebras, while nowhere near 
as clever as dogs, are much more intelligent than tapirs?

The study also found that the intelligence of an animal matters, but only when 
it comes to animals that the participants themselves didn’t eat. Learning that 
zebras are highly intelligent makes people feel worse about eating them (which 
is why I predicted you would rate eating zebras as worse than eating a tapir). 
It’s also why people don’t think twice about eating poor old chickens.
