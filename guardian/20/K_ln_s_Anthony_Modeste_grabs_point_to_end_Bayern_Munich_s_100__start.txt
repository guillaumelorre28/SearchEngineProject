Bayern Munich’s perfect Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> start came to a halt 
when they drew 1-1 with visiting Köln on Saturday after winning their first 
five matches of the season.

The Bavarians, who lost to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League in midweek, 
hit the woodwork three times and controlled the game but failed to make their 
dominance count, withKöln <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cologne> 
protecting their undefeated run this season.

Bayern struggled against the hard-working Köln defenders for 40 minutes before 
Joshua Kimmich dived to head in a beautiful Juan Bernat cross for the lead.

Thomas Müller came close to adding another four minutes after the restart as 
did Robert Lewandowski soon afterwards, with Bayern keeping up the pressure and 
looking to kill off the game.

But it was Köln who scored when Anthony Modeste timed his run to perfection, 
taking off inside the penalty area to volley a cross into Manuel Neuer’s goal 
for his fifth of the campaign.

The hosts were left stunned for a few minutes with Köln trying to hit them 
again on the counterattack, with Yuya Osako’s effort being for the visitors 
ruled out for offside.

Köln’s goalkeeper, Timo Horn, made the save of the day when he punched a 
point-blank Müller volley on to the crossbar and the Bavarians also hit the 
woodwork with a powerful low drive by Bernat five minutes from time.

The last big chance fell to the visitors, however, with Simon Zoller coming 
agonisingly close to a stoppage-time winner as his shot rolled just wide of the 
post.

Bayern moved up to 16 points, with Hertha Berlin second on 13, after easing 
past Hamburg 2-0. Borussia Dortmund, in third on 12 points, travel to Bayer 
Leverkusen later on Saturday.
