Waris, who plays for Lorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient>, 
was incensed by a tackle from the winger Jimmy Briand during the 2-2 draw which 
was not given as a foul by the referee. He reacted by launching into a kung 
fu-style kick on his opponent, which resulted in a straight red card.

That earned Waris an automatic two-match suspension but a disciplinary 
committee opted to extend his ban to six matches following his reaction on the 
sidelines, which saw the 24-year-oldkick water bottles in frustration

“What happened on Saturday is strange, crazy,” Waris told Ouest France 
<http://www.ouest-france.fr/fc-lorient-waris-je-reconnais-mes-torts-et-je-mexcuse-3816230>
. “This is the first time in my life that I have got angry like that, on the 
pitch or off it. I still wonder how I could respond like that, although there 
were causes.

“The guy fouls me. He was not sanctioned and I have a bad reaction to severe 
tackles. I should not have done it but I had no intention of hurting him or to 
kill him. I just wanted to scare him.”
