Fenerbahce look set to name Dick Advocaat as coach following the sacking of 
Vitor Pereira after the Dutchman resigned just three months into his job as 
assistant to Holland’s Danny Blind.

The Turkish sports newspaper Fanatik said Advocaat had confirmed his 
appointment, saying he had thought he would not return to club management but 
that Fenerbahce had made him “an unbelievable offer”.

The Istanbul club said in a statement it had cancelled Pereira’s contract 
after he had violated terms of the deal. The issue will now be taken to Fifa 
and the court of arbitration for sport. A brief Dutch FA statement said 
Advocaat had “indicated he is going to work somewhere else”.

“I am shocked and disappointed,” said Blind, who wanted the 68-year-old to 
help him as the team sought to overcome the disappointment of missing out on 
Euro 2016 by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.

“When I approached Dick last year to be assistant he gave me the impression he 
wanted to do it long term. But we have to carry on, from now on what is 
important is our upcoming matches against Greece and Sweden.”

Advocaat’s first game could be in Turkey against Grasshoppers Zurich in the 
first leg of the play-offs for the Europa League on Thursday.

As head coach, Advocaat took Holland to the World Cup finals in 1994 and the 
European Championships 10 years later. His last job as a club coach wasat 
Sunderland where he resigned last October
