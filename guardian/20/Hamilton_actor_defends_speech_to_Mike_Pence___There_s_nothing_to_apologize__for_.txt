 for the incident.

“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays the US’s 
third vice-president, Aaron Burr, in the acclaimed musical, toldCBS’s This 
Morning

“If people are coming to see Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton> to leave their politics behind, 
you came to the wrong show,” he told ABC’s The View.

The vice-president-elect was leaving the theatre with his Secret Service 
protection shortly after theBroadway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/broadway> show – a hip-hop musical about the 
life of founding father Alexander Hamilton – ended on Friday night, when Dixon 
stepped forward to read a message written by the producers, cast and crew, 
including the show’s creator and former star Lin-Manuel Miranda.

“He was walking out and then he stopped and he turned and he listened,” Dixon 
told The View.

The message welcomed Pence to the show and continued: “We are the diverse 
Americans who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not 
protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our 
inalienable rights … we hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our 
American values and work on behalf of all of us.

“We thank you for sharing this wonderful American story, told by a diverse 
group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations.”

In response, Trump tweeted on Saturday that Pence had been “harassed” and the 
cast should apologize.

The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should 
immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior

Pence seemed less exercised by Dixon’s statement. “I did hear what was said 
from the stage,” he said on Sunday. “I can tell you I wasn’t offended by what 
was said. I will leave to others whether that was the appropriate venue to say 
it.”

On The View, Dixon said: “The way it was received, the way he [Pence] 
responded, is testament to the fact it was the right time and place.” He said 
actors and cultural figures had a responsibility to use their roles to discuss 
politics, and if there was a chance to speak with elected officials, “you must 
seize that opportunity”.

He pointed out that theater is often political and that the Hamilton cast and 
crew worked hard before the election to get people registered to vote.

“Art is meant to bring people together; it’s meant to raise 
conscientiousness,” he said on CBS.


When asked on Monday why Trump responded to the comments in the manner that he 
did, Dixon replied: “I don’t know if we have enough time to delve into the 
psychology of President-elect Trump.”
