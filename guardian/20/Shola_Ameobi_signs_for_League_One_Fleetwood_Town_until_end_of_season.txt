The former Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi has signed for League One 
Fleetwood Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fleetwood-town> until the 
end of the season.

The former England Under-21 and Nigerian international had recently been 
released by Bolton Wanderers after their financial problems worsened and will 
be available for relegation-threatened Fleetwood’s match at Port Vale on 
Saturday.

The club’s manager Steven Pressley said of the 34-year-old striker 
<http://www.fleetwoodtownfc.com/news/article/ameobi-fleetwood-town-newcastle-united-international-footballer-2950998.aspx>
: “In January we signed a number of younger players and it was vital to the 
group that we brought in a player with experience.

“We certainly couldn’t get any more experience than Shola Ameobi and we are 
absolutely delighted with that. He is not only a very good player; he is a 
terrific character that can bring a lot to the group.

“It is vital that he has been playing, as sometimes unattached players at this 
stage in the season, the one thing they are lacking is a level of fitness.

“Shola has been involved at Bolton Wanderers on a regular basis for the vast 
majority of the season and he is raring to go ahead of Saturday’s trip to Port 
Vale.”

Ameobi scored 81 goals in 228 appearances for Newcastle, Stoke, Crystal Palace 
and Bolton.
