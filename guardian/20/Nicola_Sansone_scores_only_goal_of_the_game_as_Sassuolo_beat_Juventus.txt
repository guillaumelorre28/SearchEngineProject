Juventus slumped to another surprise defeat on Wednesday when they lost 1-0 at 
Sassuolo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sassuolo>.

Juve’s three-game unbeaten streak, which was accompanied by three consecutive 
clean sheets, was wrecked by a first-half goal from Nicola Sansone. The 
visitors were without several key players and conceded in the 20th minute 
thanks to an exquisite free-kick by Sansone that left the goalkeeper, Gigi 
Buffon, with no chance.

Things got worse for the Turin side before half-time when a frustrated Giorgio 
Chiellini earned himself a second yellow card for hacking down Domenico Berardi.

Nevertheless, they enjoyed plenty of possession in the second half and had 
their chances to equalise. Paul Pogba went the closest with a shot that was 
inches wide after a delicate layoff from Mario Mandzukic while Juan Cuadrado’s 
fierce long-range drive forced Gianluca Pegolo into a decent save.

The defeat leaves Juve in 12th place with 12 points from 10 matches. Sassuolo 
are fifth with 18 points.
