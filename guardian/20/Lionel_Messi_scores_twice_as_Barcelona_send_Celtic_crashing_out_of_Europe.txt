Celtic should not feel shamed by falling victim to a Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> team inspired by Lionel Messi. 
More disappointing for Brendan Rodgers than this result in isolation, one 
assumes, is the fact elimination from Europe was simultaneously confirmed. 
Celtic’s manager must continue his rebuilding process when engaged only in 
domestic pursuits, with even the Europa League denied to his side.

Barcelona were vastly superior on an evening when they did not seem to touch 
top gear. They will qualify for theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> last 16 as group 
winners. “This was a very difficult section,” said the Barcelona coach, Luis 
Enrique. “It is great to come first with a game to spare.”

Messi’s prominence, so often taken for granted, was a joy to watch. The 
sharing of goals between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Manchester City means 
watch is precisely what Celtic will have to do after the final match of Group 
C. WhenCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> travel to 
Manchester for matchday six, there will be nothing tangible at stake for either 
team

Rodgers was not exaggerating with the pre-match assertion that his players 
must produce “the game of their lives”. Rules of modern-day football finance 
have created a gulf between clubs such as these. Barcelona’s potency had been 
illustrated in the 7-0 demolition of Celtic in September. This game at least 
followed a different pattern.

“The team deserve great credit,” insisted Rodgers. “We weren’t fearful 
tonight. As a coach you look for improvement. I think this team has made 
significant improvement. This experience was always going to be invaluable for 
us.”

Luís Enrique had not been able to call upon Messi for last weekend’s draw with 
Málaga. The Argentinian returned for this game after recovering from a stomach 
bug.

Messi was duly prominent from the outset. His feeding of Neymar created a 
ninth-minute opportunity which the Brazilian could not convert. Messi himself 
was soon wasteful when failing to connect with a terrific Sergio Busquets pass. 
The same accusation could also be applied as he flicked an Ivan Rakitic header 
over the bar from all of four yards. With 20 minutes played, perhaps Celtic 
could dream their illustrious visitors were to endure one of those nights.

Such hope would prove in vain. Messi’s opening goal, taken first time, owed 
plenty to a wonderful, lofted Neymar pass in the 24th minute. The Barcelona 
captain clipped the ball home.

Brilliance from Craig Gordon kept Barça’s advantage at one by the interval. 
The Scotland goalkeeper produced acrobatics to deny Luis Suárez at point-blank 
range, Messi the architect. By this juncture, Barcelona were dominant.

Celtic were dealt a half-time blow when the injured Scott Sinclair had to go 
off. The 27-year-old has seen his career rejuvenated since a summer move from 
Aston Villa.

Sinclair’s replacement forged the 53rd-minute chance from which the home side 
should have equalised. James Forrest’s cross found the head of Moussa Dembélé, 
who failed to further enhance a blossoming reputation when directly in front of 
goal, Marc-André ter Stegen afforded a straightforward save. “Hopefully as time 
goes on, we learn to take the chances as they come,” Rodgers said.

How costly this miss was to prove. In Barcelona’s next attack Suárez was 
hauled to the ground in the Celtic area by Emilio Izaguirre. The penalty was 
quite correctly awarded, despite the post-match complaints of Rodgers, with 
Messi stepping forward to give his team breathing space. The only shock 
thereafter was that the 29-year-old did not complete a hat-trick.

Neymar, having received a booking for a clash with Mikael Lustig, was 
fortunate not to collect another for a trip on the same player. “Handbags,” was 
the Luis Enrique assessment afterwards. His lack of concern rather summed up 
Barça’s evening.
