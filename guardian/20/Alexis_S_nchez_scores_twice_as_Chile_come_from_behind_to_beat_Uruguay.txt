Arsène Wenger had warned that playing the forward in the game in Santiago 
could be a “suicidal decision” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/10/arsene-wenger-alexis-sanchez-suicidal-injury>
 that threatened to leave him with a more serious injury.

The striker’s performance will go some way to allaying Wenger’s fears, with a 
Premier League fixture against Manchester United at lunchtime on Saturday 
foremost in his mind.

Edinson Cavani had put Uruguay in front after 14 minutes in Chile before the 
hosts hit back just before the half-time break through Eduardo Vargas’ header.


Sánchez put the Copa América champions ahead from the edge of the box on the 
hour mark before adding a second soon after – his 36th international goal – to 
leave him just one shy of Marcelo Salas’ all-time record for Chile.

Uruguay had a chance to pull one back and set up a grandstand finish, but 
Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo foiled Luis Suárez from the spot late on.

In San Juan, a Lionel Messi masterclass, netting a brilliant free-kick before 
laying on two more goals, put Argentina’s qualifying campaign back on track 
with a resounding 3-0 win over Colombia.

The win lifted Messi’s team, recovering from two successive defeats, into 
fifth place in the South American group with 19 points, one behind Ecuador and 
Chile.

Brazil, away to Peru in Lima in a later match, top the table with 24 points 
while Uruguay are second with 23. Colombia dropped to sixth on 18 points.
