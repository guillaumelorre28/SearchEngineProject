If there is any champagne in the mini-bar of his hotel room, José Mourinho 
might just crack open a bottle this morning and raise a toast to Milan and its 
football clubs. Firstly toInternazionale, whose new Chinese owners are eager to 
make a big statement in the transfer market even if that statement is “we have 
more money than sense”. Accordingly, Inter are preparing to make a bid forWayne 
Rooney, who is expected to be warmly welcomed by the club’s ultras by dint of 
not being Mauro Icardi.

AC Milan, meanwhile, want to relieve United of Memphis Depay and there are 
only two complications: 1) Marseille also want the winger and 2) Mourinho 
can’t remember where he left him. Still, one of the paparazzi outside 
Mourinho’s hotel could probably locate Memphis so he’ll be found soon 
enough and then it’ll just be a case of seeing which club wants him more. 
Either way, it’s win-win for United and it’s a long time since we’ve been 
able to say that.

A good thing about the Rooney-to-Inter offer is that it is expected to be 
made even if the club sack Frank de Boer, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/frank-de-boer-inter-era-europa-league-southampton>
 which they may do soon. But the
Dutchman will not be replaced by Laurent Blanc, apparently because he 
fancies his chance of getting that Manchester United gig if Mourinho can’t 
get over his London homesick blues soon. As for Ryan Giggs, he could be on his 
way toWigan Athletic, who are keen to hire him as a replacement for the sacked 
Gary Caldwell.

 Giggs was a great player so should be well able to manage Wigan’s way out of 
the Championship relegation zone. That’s how it works, right? Wolves, 
meanwhile, are looking to hire Sam Allardyce and may, or may not, soon open 
negotiations over pints of wine in a hotel bar.

Paris Saint-Germain are willing to pay the buyout clause in the contract of 
Antoine Greizmann, which is a cool 100m euro. That equates to £85m. No, 
hold on, it equates to £86m. No, its changed again, it’s £88m. Actually, 
it’s ... oh sod it, we can’t keep up. The point is PSG are going to make a 
humungous offer and Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> might just try to 
exceed it because
paying another world record fee might just elevate them above Everton in 
the Premier League table.

Barcelona are lining up a bid for Glen Johnson. Do not adjust your 
computer. The Catalans have problems at right-back and are aware that 
Johnson has been playing so well for Stoke in between injuries that he has 
forced his way back into the England reckoning, and if a player is good 
enough for Gareth Southgate and England then he must be good enough for 
Barça. Do not adjust your computer.

Tony Pulis’s plan to give West Bromwich Albion an exciting makeover (again, 
do not adjust your computer) include signing the Cologne striker Anthony 
Modeste and Sporting Lisbon’s midfielder Adrien Silva.

Spurs are going to complete the sale of Nabil Bentaleb to Schalke, who have 
been impressed with the 21-year-old during his loan stint at the club. 
Spurs are also said to be in talks with a the taxi firm Uber over naming 
rights for their new stadium, which, presumably, could become known as the 
London Uberground.
