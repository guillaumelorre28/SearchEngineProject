Are you the type of person who makes friends easily? Find out with something 
called the wall-sit test. Squat against a wall with your knees at a 90-degree 
angle, and keep your back straight. Hold this position for as long as you can, 
timing yourself with your phone.

How did you get on? When this study was completed under test conditions at the 
University of Oxford, the average was just under two minutes (113 seconds, to 
be precise). The most iron-willed participant held on for an impressive 6.5 
minutes.

What has this got to do with making friends? Well, the researchers found that 
the greater a person’s tolerance to pain (as measured by the wall-sit test), 
the greater the size of his or her “outer network”. All but the most antisocial 
of us have an inner network of core friends; the outer network is the number of 
more distant friends – those we’re in touch with once or twice a month.

Someone who can wall-sit for about a minute typically has somewhere between 
one and 10 friends of this type, while someone who can hold on for three 
minutes typically has between 10 and 20.

This isn’t because both physical pain and second-tier friends are something to 
be endured. In fact, the binding of a particular endorphin (the brain’s 
“feel-good” chemicals) to the brain’s painkilling system is associated with 
both pain tolerance and social bonding. The more active this system, the better 
you are at both.
