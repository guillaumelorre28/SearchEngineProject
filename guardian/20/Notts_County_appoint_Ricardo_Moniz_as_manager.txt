Notts County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottscounty> have appointed 
Ricardo Moniz as their manager just a week after they announced that he was 
unable to commit to the role.

The former Tottenham coach pulled out of the running due to “family reasons” 
at the end of March but on Tuesday moved to Meadow Lane on a three-year deal.

The 50-year-old Dutchman has six games to save them from relegation into 
League Two, with the Magpies currently one point from safety.

Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of 
Shaun Derry on 23 March, with Paul Hart and Mick Halsall taking caretaker 
charge of their recent games.

But Moniz, who steered Red Bull Salzburg to the Austrian league and cup double 
in 2011-12, will now take over.
