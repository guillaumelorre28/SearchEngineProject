Marlowe and Shakespeare were both playwrights (Marlowe finally credited among 
cast of Bard’s co-writers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/23/christopher-marlowe-credited-as-one-of-shakespeares-co-writers>
, 24 October). When first coined by Ben Jonson in hisEpigrams 
<http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692epigrams.htm>, the word had a distinct 
whiff of derision, but it was nevertheless rooted in the working life of the 
period. Wrights, from the Old English“wryhta” 
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wright>, roughly equivalent 
to “worker”, were craftsmen, builders or repairers.

In the same way as shipwrights, wainwrights and wheelwrights, playwrights no 
doubt worked together to craft stage plays from the best material to hand. All 
three writers were of relatively humble origin, being respectively the sons of 
a shoemaker, a glover and a (master) bricklayer, artisans well-grounded in 
respectable labour. And it is after all, the quality of the plays they wrought 
that still speaks of their craftsmanship, no matter the hands that held the 
quill.
