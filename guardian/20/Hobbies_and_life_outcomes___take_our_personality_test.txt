Personality tests have long been used to predict people’s life outcomes – and 
not always that successfully. But a HOT new kid on the block – theHolland 
Occupational Themes <http://personality-testing.info/tests/RIASEC/> – might be 
the best test yet.

Based on your hobbies and interests, which category from the six below do you 
feel you fall into? In other words, are your hobbies mainly...

Realistic hands-on activities using tools, machines, animals 
Investigative museums, science
Artistic making music or art
Social interacting with others
Enterprising running stalls or selling online
Conventional computers, data

A recent study found that the answers given on this questionnaire could 
predict a whole host of lifestyle factors 10 years later. Realistic types are 
high earners, and the least likely to be unemployed, with artistic types the 
opposite. The latter also see themselves as less healthy than others of the 
same age, though there’s no evidence that this is actually the case.

Social and conventional types might sound like polar opposites, but both are 
particularly likely to get married and to have children within 10 years of 
leaving school.

However, only the social types are also likely to be low earners. Enterprising 
types are the opposite: high earners who tend not to marry (or even have a 
single serious relationship) within this period. Finally, investigative types 
are an enigma, scoring neither the highest or lowest on any of these measures 
of professional and personal life – a mystery that they themselves would 
presumably enjoy investigating.
