José Mourinho <https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho> is set to 
complete the £12.5m signing of the St Etienne centre-half Kurt Zouma, although 
Chelsea will loan him back to the French club for the remainder of the season.

The Chelsea manager has been active in the January window, buying Nemanja Matic

 for a combined £32m andmoving out Juan Mata

 andKevin De Bruyne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/18/chelsea-sell-kevin-de-bruyne-wolfsburg>
 for £53.5m, together with Michael Essien on a free transfer. Mourinho had said 
at the start of the month that he envisaged no business in or out of the club.

Zouma, the 19-year-old France youth international, who was a part of the team 
that won the Under-20 World Cup last year, is considered as one for the future 
atChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> and, as such, he fits 
into Mourinho's long-term plan for the club.

But the acquisition will raise questions about John Terry's future, with the 
captain, who is out of contract in the summer, yet to agree a new deal. Chelsea 
have a policy of offering only one-year extensions to players in their thirties 
– Terry is 33 – and he would like a longer contract.

Mourinho has said that nothing would be discussed with regard to Terry's 
situation in January butthere remained trust on all sides 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/24/chelsea-jose-mourinho-john-terry>
 and the confidence that a solution would be found. Terry is enjoying a fine 
season in which he has not missed a single minute in the Premier League, having 
previously fallen from favour under the former manager Rafael Benítez.

Zouma has attracted the attention of many clubs, despite being banned for 10 
matches in November for a leg-breaking tackle on the Sochaux midfielder Thomas 
Guerbert, for which he was sent off. Zouma apologised to Guerbert and insisted 
it was an accident.
