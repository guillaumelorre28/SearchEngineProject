Bayern Munich routed helpless Werder Bremen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen> 6-0 to maintain their 
leadership of the Bundesliga. Philipp Lahm and Mario Götze both scored twice as 
Bayern warmed up for Tuesday’s Champions League game at Roma with a comfortable 
win. Robert Lewandowski, injured playing for Poland against Scotland on 
Tuesday, remained on the bench.

Lahm, Bayern’s captain hammered the ball home for his first goal of the season 
in the 20th, and Xabi Alonso scored his firstBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> goal seven minutes 
later, when he shot under the Bremen wall inside the left post. It was the 
Spaniard’s 61st touch of the ball.

Alonso, who set a Bundesliga record with his 206 ball touches in the previous 
game against Cologne, had 21 touches in the first five minutes alone, two more 
than all the Bremen players together.

Thomas Müller scored a penalty in the 43rd, and Götze claimed his first with a 
fine finish inside the far post two minutes later.

With one eye on the trip to Roma, Pep Guardiola took off Alonso and Arjen 
Robben just after the hour, replacing them with Xherdan Shaqiri and Franck 
Ribéry. Ribéry was making his comeback from a left knee injury.

Lahm scored two goals in a Bundesliga game for the first time by claiming his 
second in the 79th, before Götze scored again in the 86th.

Bremen became the first side not to have a single shot on goal in 6,495 
Bundesliga games since records were kept in 1993-94.

“It is usually a bit difficult coming back from an international break but we 
played really well,” Bayern’s coach, Pep Guardiola, said. “We now have three 
more points and can focus on our Champions League game.”
