Your browser or password manager’s autofill might be inadvertently giving away 
your information to unscrupulous phishers using hidden text boxes on sites.


Finnish web developer and hacker Viljami Kuosmanen discovered 
<https://github.com/anttiviljami/browser-autofill-phishing> that several web 
browsers, including Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari and Opera, as well as some 
plugins andutilities such as LastPass 
<https://forums.lastpass.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=240115>, can be tricked into 
giving away a user’s personal information through their profile-based autofill 
systems.

The phising attack is brutally simple. Kuosmanen discovered that when a user 
attempts to fill in information in some simple text boxes, such as name and 
email address, the autofill system, which is intended to avoid tedious 
repetition of standard information such as your address, will input other 
profile-based information into any other text boxes – even when those boxes are 
not visible on the page.

It means that when a user inputs seemingly innocent, basic information into a 
site, the autofill system could be giving away much more sensitive information 
at the same time should the user confirm the autofill. Chrome’s autofill 
system, which is switched on by default, stores data on email addresses, phone 
numbers, mailing addresses, organisations, credit card information and various 
other bits and pieces.

This is why I don't like autofill in web forms. #phishing

Kuosmanen set up a site to demonstrate the issue 
<https://anttiviljami.github.io/browser-autofill-phishing/>, showing a text box 
for a user’s name and email address, with text boxes for address and phone 
number hidden from view, autofilled by Chrome.

Mozilla’s Firefox is immune to the problem, as it does not yet have a 
multi-box autofill system and cannot be tricked into filling text boxes by 
programatic means,according to Mozilla principle security engineer Daniel Veditz
 <https://twitter.com/dveditz/status/818610764286218240>. A more complete 
autofill system is currently in development for Firefox, however.

The phishing attack still relies on users being tricked into entering at least 
some information into an online form, but unsuspecting users could be tricked 
into entering more than they bargained for relatively easily.

Users can protect themselves from this kind of phishing attack by disabling 
the autofill system within their browser or extension settings.
