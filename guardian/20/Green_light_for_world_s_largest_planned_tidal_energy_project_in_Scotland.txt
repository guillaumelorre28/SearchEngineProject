Construction of the largest planned tidal energy project in the world is 
expected to begin off the Scottish coast next month, developers have announced.

Atlantis, majority owner of the MeyGen project, said it had finalised all of 
the conditions required to initiate its first drawdown from financiers The 
Crown Estate and Scottish Enterprise.

The project has the potential to power nearly 175,000 homes through a network 
of 269 turbines on the seabed at Ness of Quoys in Caithness, north-eastScotland

The company’s share price dipped on Friday but Atlantis said it “knows of no 
trading or operational reason to warrant this change”, particularly given the 
good progress it is making on MeyGen.

In an announcement to investors, Atlantis said: “The major construction and 
supply contractors to this iconic project have commenced design, engineering 
and procurement works in readiness for commencement of onshore construction at 
the project site in Caithness in January 2015.

“The equity investments in the project by Scottish Enterprise (through the 
RenewableEnergy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Investment 
Fund) and Atlantis value the MeyGen project on a post-money equity basis at 
over £70m.

“Onshore construction at the Ness of Quoys project site is expected to 
commence in January 2015, with ABB due to start construction of the onshore 
infrastructure for connection to the electricity transmission grid for power 
export.

“We believe MeyGen is the largest planned tidal energy project in the world 
with a capacity of almost 400MW.”

The first power to the national grid is expected to be delivered in 2016.
