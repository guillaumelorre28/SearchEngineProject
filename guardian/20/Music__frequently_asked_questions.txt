Lists

Lists are a way of compiling your favourite (or not-so-favourite) artists and 
albums on guardian.co.uk. So, for example, if you went to see a band last night 
and it was the best gig you've ever been to, you can look up their artist page 
and add them to your "best live acts" list. Or if you want to make a list of 
your favourite artists/albums and share it with your friends on Facebook or 
Twitter, you can do that too. Check out some examples oflists of artists 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lists/recently-added/artist> and lists of 
albums <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lists/recently-added/album> created by 
other users.

 <>
Yes. Each list you create will be public and have its own unique URL, so you 
can share it on Facebook, Twitter and other websites, or email them to people.

 <>
We don't currently offer the option to import a list.

All the lists you create on guardian.co.uk are public, so will be visible to 
everyone.

Artist pages

 <>
We have created thousands of pages on guardian.co.uk/music so that you can 
find out about all kinds of bands and other musical acts, even if we've never 
written anything about them.

These pages are automatically generated using MusicBrainz IDs 
<http://musicbrainz.org/> and pulling in information from across the web. For 
example, the biography details for an artist are supplied by last.fm, you can 
watch YouTube videos relating to the artist and where available, we link to the 
artist's official website, Twitter/Facebook/MySpace pages and more. When we 
have published an article, video or audio about an artist that will also appear 
on the page.
 <>

You can find an artist page by typing the artist's name into the search box on 
guardian.co.uk/music <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music>. It sits below the 
advert on the right-hand side of the page and it looks like this:


Alternatively this A-Z list of popular artists is a good place to start 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/list/artists>.

 <>
If you spot any problems or have any concerns with the information on any 
artist page emailuserhelp@guardian.co.uk <mailto:userhelp@guardian.co.uk>
 <>
There will soon be the option to review a live performance by an artist, and 
to review albums by artists.

 <>
If we have any articles with comments open relating to an artist, you should 
be able to find them on their artist page.

Album pages

 <>What's an album page?
There is now a page on guardian.co.uk for almost every album ever released. 
These are created automatically using data from MusicBrainz, last.fm and other 
sources from around the web. Where we have written a Guardian or Observer 
review about an album it should appear on that page. There will be many pages 
that do not contain Guardian or Observer content – but you can help us fill in 
the gaps in our music coverage (and complement what's already there) by writing 
reviews on these album pages too.

If you want a more technically-minded explanation of how we've created these 
pages,you can get that here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/aug/02/music-album-pages>.

 <>How do I find an album page?
These are the easiest ways to find an album page:

• Look up an artist page (this this A-Z list of popular artists is a good 
place to start <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/list/artists>, or use the 
search box on the right-hand side of guardian.co.uk/music 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music>) where, for the most part, the links to all 
their album pages can be found.

• There will be a link to the album page on all our album reviews from now on 
– so if you feel inspired to write a review straight after reading one of our 
critics' opinions it will be easy for you to do that. You can find the link at 
the bottom of the review - it looks like this:

 <>What can I do on an album page?
You can add a star rating, add the album to a list, review the album, share 
the page on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social site, find out the 
tracklisting of the first release of the album (and other information) and read 
Guardian and Observer reviews.

 <>How do I write an album review?
First, you'll need to sign into your guardian.co.uk account 
<https://id.guardian.co.uk/signin>. If you don't already have an account, click 
here to register <https://id.guardian.co.uk/register>.

After you have signed in, go to the page for the album you want to review. A 
box at the end of the album page prompts you to add a star rating, enter a 
title for your review, and type (or paste) your review. When you have finished 
filling in this box, hit the preview button and make sure you are happy with 
what you have written before clicking "post review", as there is no way to edit 
the review once it has been published.

• For some tips on how to write a good album review, read this article and its 
comments 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/02/alexis-petridis-writing-album-reviews>

 <>Can I share an album review I've written on Facebook and Twitter?
Each review has its own unique url that you can share with friends – click 
'permalink' on your published review to access the link. Alternatively you can 
use the Twitter and Facebook buttons that appear on every page to share the 
whole album page, complete with your review.

 <>Can I discuss an album?
If there are articles with comments open about a particular album, you should 
be able to find it on the album page.

 <>Can I respond to another reader's review?
The ability to comment on another reader's review is not currently available.

 <>There's a mistake on an album page. Who should I tell?
If you spot any problems or have any concerns with the information on any 
artist page emailuserhelp@guardian.co.uk <mailto:userhelp@guardian.co.uk>
