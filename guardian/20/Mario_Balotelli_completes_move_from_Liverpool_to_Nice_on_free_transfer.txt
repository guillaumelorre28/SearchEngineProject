Mario Balotelli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mario-balotelli> has 
signed for Nice on a free transfer. The misfit Italian, who was deemed by 
Jürgen Kloppp to be surplus to requirements, joins on a one-year deal.

With the addition of Sadio Mané from Southampton, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are well-stocked for forwards 
and were keen to remove Balotelli from their books. Having signed for £16m in 
2014, Balotelli managed only four goals in 28 appearances.

“We are very pleased to welcome Mario,” said the Nice president, Jean-Pierre 
Rivère. “We hope thatNice <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice>, in a 
family atmosphere, will help him rediscover his joy for the game. We both know 
that nothing will be easy but with the desire and support of all our fans, 
we’ll help him to flourish and bring his talent to the service of the team.”

Balotelli will have his first training session on Thursday and be presented to 
the media on Friday.

Liverpool also allowed the departure of Luis Alberto to Lazio for £4.3m plus 
add-ons. Liverpool paid nearly £7m for the midfielder in 2013 but the 
23-year-old failed to hold down a first-team berth. The deal with Lazio 
includes a 30% sell-on agreement.

Two payers left Liverpol on season’s loans: the 23-year-old defender Andre 
Wisdom has gone to the Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg and the winger Lazar 
Markovic, a Brendan Rodgers signing unused by Jürgen Klopp, joined Sporting 
Lisbon.
