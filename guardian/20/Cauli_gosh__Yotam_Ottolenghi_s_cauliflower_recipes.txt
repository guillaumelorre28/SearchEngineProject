What with all the campaigning going on right now (and we all know that’s only 
going to get worse), I’ve decided that after this week I’m going to step down 
from a cause I’ve long advocated. I’m not sure politics is meant to work like 
this – no votes have been cast, no deals brokered – but no matter: it finally 
looks as if the cauliflower battle is won. 

The pro-cauli campaign has been going on long enough for everyone who’s ever 
going to be convinced to be, well, convinced: cauliflower is not a dowdy, 
dreary, bland charity case. My part in proceedings started way back in 2007, 
when I was still pretty new to this game. “If you’ve always thought cauliflower 
can’t be exciting,” I wrote in this magazine ofa salad that paired florets with 
sweet sultanas and sharp olives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/17/features.weekend1>, 
“here’s a dish that might make you want to reconsider.”

A while later, I took part in a 2009 edition of BBC Radio 4’s Food Programme 
that was dedicated to the cauliflower <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00m0jvq>
 and in the course of which I bemoaned its usurpation by its cousin, broccoli. 
For that show, I chargrilled cauliflower, then doused it in grain mustard, 
dill, garlic and cider vinegar, hoping this would bring new supporters to the 
barricades. Similarly, in 2010, when sharinga recipe for cauliflower cake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/02/cauliflower-cake-recipe-yotam-ottolenghi>
, I came clean that the dish was “part of my ongoing campaign to give 
cauliflower some well-earned glory”.

Ever since, I have banged on about cauliflower to anyone who’d listen. I’ve 
suggestedroasting the florets and mixing them with dates and capers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/08/salty-sweet-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-artichoke-cauliflower-sweetcorn>
,or with grapes and cheddar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/18/ottolenghi-cauliflower-grape-cheddar-salad>
. I’ve usedgrated cauliflower in a tabbouleh-like salad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/06/yotam-ottolenghi-cherry-beetroot-recipes>
, and treated it much as we do potatoes infrittatas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/feb/17/foodanddrink.recipes>, 
fritters 
<http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/cauliflower-and-cumin-fritters-with-lime-yoghurt-shop>
 andpakoras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/artichoke-salad-cauliflower-pakora-recipe>
. I have deep-fried it and served it with atahini- or yoghurt-based sauce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/17/fried-cauliflower-tahini-recipe-ottolenghi>
; and I have turned it intoa lemony soup topped with mustard croutons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/02/arancini-recipe-cauliflower-soup-yotam-ottolenghi>
.

All this is not to say I’ve been a lone voice on the cauliflower campaign 
trail. Far from it. Long-standing veterans of the movement – Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstallpredicted in a 2009 column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/10/cauliflower-broccoli-recipes>
 that it could be the next big vegetable – have stood shoulder to shoulder with 
more recent converts, fromthe Hemsley sisters’ 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/2012/07/11/hemsley-and-hemsley-chicken-curry-with-cauliflower-rice>
 ingenious grated and steamed cauliflower as a light alternative to rice, to
Jack Monroe’s passanda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/jack-monroe-cauliflower-pasanda-recipe>
 that celebrates its versatility for those on tight budgets, as well as meaty 
roast cauli “steaks” dreamed up byJason Neroni of the Superba Snack Bar in LA 
<http://www.tastingtable.com/entry_detail/chefs_recipes/10259/Superba_Snack_Bars_Cauliflower_Steaks_Recipe.htm>
.

Now, this once-maligned vegetable is feted on menus and dinner tables more or 
less everywhere – it’s giving even the ubiquitous kale a run for its money. So 
it’s time for me to move on and stand up for other minority veg. Turnip, 
kohlrabi, swede: I’ve got your backs.

spectacular combination of roast and grated raw cauliflower.’ Photograph:

I’ve always loved roast cauliflower, and I’ve also been known to rave about 
how tasty it is grated raw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/06/yotam-ottolenghi-cherry-beetroot-recipes>
, so imagine how delighted I was to discover that the combination of the two 
works spectacularly well. Serves two to four.

60ml sunflower oil
1 medium onion, peeled and sliced thin
1 large cauliflower, leaves removed and base trimmed
60ml olive oil
Salt
25g parsley leaves, finely chopped
10g mint leaves, roughly chopped
7g tarragon leaves, finely chopped
The seeds from ½ medium pomegranate (about 80g net weight)
35g pistachios, toasted and lightly crushed
¾ tsp ground cumin
1 tbsp lemon juice

Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Put the sunflower oil in a small sauté 
pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for eight to 10 minutes, 
until golden-brown and starting to crisp. Remove from the heat and set aside to 
cool.

Coarsely grate a third of the cauliflower (about 160g-worth) and set aside in 
a large bowl. Break the remaining cauliflower into medium-sized florets about 
3cm wide at the top. Toss the florets in half the olive oil and a 
quarter-teaspoon of salt, then spread out on a baking tray. Roast for 20 
minutes, until cooked through and a dark golden-brown. Remove and set aside to 
cool.

Add the onions and their oil to the grated cauliflower, then stir in the 
remaining olive oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Add the remaining 
ingredients apart from the roast florets, mix well, then gently fold in the 
florets and serve at once.

Mustardy cauliflower cheese

A neat take on a classic. Serves four.

50g puy lentils
1 large cauliflower, separated into 4cm florets
2 tbsp ghee
2 banana shallots, peeled and diced fine
1½ tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp curry powder
1 tsp mustard powder
2 green chillis, deseeded and finely diced
1 tsp black mustard seeds
200ml double cream
90g mature cheddar, grated
15g parmesan, grated
Salt
15g panko breadcrumbs
5g parsley, finely chopped

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Tip the lentils into a small pan filled 
with boiling water and simmer for 18 minutes, until al dente. Drain, refresh 
and leave to drip-dry.

Steam the cauliflower over boiling water for five minutes, until just 
softening, remove and set aside.

Melt the ghee in a round, 24cm casserole pan on a medium heat, and sauté the 
shallots for eight minutes, until soft and golden. Add the cumin, curry and 
mustard powders, and chilli, and cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute, then stir in the cream, 80g of the 
cheddar, all the parmesan and half a teaspoon of salt. Simmer for a minute or 
two, so the sauce thickens slightly, then add the lentils and cauliflower. Stir 
gently, simmer for a minute more, then take off the heat.

In a small bowl, mix the panko, remaining cheddar and parsley. Sprinkle over 
the cauliflower, then bake for eight minutes, until bubbling and hot. Brown 
under a high grill for two to four minutes, until the top is golden and crisp 
(watch that it doesn’t burn). Remove, leave to cool down slightly and serve.

Roasted whole cauliflower with creme fraiche

Keep all the leaves on the head of cauliflower for this: when roasted, they 
are deliciously crisp and tasty. The addition of a few chopped anchovies would 
be a flavoursome addition to the butter: you won’t need the salt if you do 
this. I like to serve this in the centre of the table, for people to share with 
drinks at the start of a meal. We break the cauliflower apart with our hands 
(let it cool down a little first), dip the individual florets and crisp green 
leaves into the creme fraiche sauce and sprinkle with salt. For those who 
prefer eating with a knife and fork on separate small plates, just cut the 
cauli into quarters and serve individually. Serves four as a starter.

1 large cauliflower with its leaves intact
150g creme fraiche
1 tbsp lemon juice
70g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
3 tbsp olive oil
Coarse sea salt

Using a pair of scissors, lightly trim the leaves at the top of the 
cauliflower, so that about 5cm of the cauliflower’s head is exposed.  

Fill a pan large enough to fit the cauliflower in salty water. Bring to a boil 
and carefully lower in the cauliflower exposed head down: don’t worry if the 
base sticks out a little. Bring back to a boil, cook for six minutes, then 
transfer the cauliflower to a colander, exposed head down. Set aside for 10 
minutes, to drain and cool.

Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Mix together the creme fraiche and 
lemon juice, and set aside in the fridge until required.

Mix the butter with the oil. Put the cauliflower stem side down in a medium 
baking tray and spread the butter mix all over the white flower. Sprinkle over 
a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, and roast for an hour and a half to two 
hours, basting the cauliflower with the buttery juices five or six times 
during cooking. The cauliflower is done when it’s super-tender and a dark 
golden-brown, and the leaves are crisp and charred. Remove from the oven and 
serve with the lemony creme fraiche and a little extra salt for sprinkling on 
topalongside.
