After appearing in the TV series Skins, aged 16, Dev Patel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/21/dev-patel-didn-t-know-what-getting-into-slumdog-marigold-hotel>
, has not looked back. He starred in the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, The 
Second Best Marigold Hotel (as a super-keen hotel manager) and The Man Who Knew 
Infinity (as the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan). Now he stars 
in Lion, based on the true story of Saroo Brierley, an Indian street boy who 
got lost 1,000 miles from home, was put in an orphanage and sent to Australia 
for adoption. Twenty-five years on, Saroo started to search for his mother, 
using Google maps.

Congratulations on your Golden Globe nomination for Lion. Is Saroo the most 
demanding role you’ve played?
I’m 26 and, like most actors my age, hungry to show emotional range. This role 
enabled me to play a character suffering real pain, a change from the scripts 
that want you as a funny sidekick. It took eight months to prepare. I wanted to 
commit every fibre of my being to getting it right. I had to bulk up, grow my 
hair, learn the accent. At my last audition, where I met the director Garth 
Davis, I’d been inThe Man Who Knew Infinity and was skinny, with a buzzcut. I 
had to get myself a personal trainer and started eating like a glutton – 
downing the protein shakes.

I never went to acting school. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned from 
great directors and my co-stars

It is a movie about mothers and sons. What did your mother make of it?
I brought my mum, father, sister and grandparents to the London film festival 
premiere in Leicester Square. It was a beautiful, full-circle moment. Ten years 
previously I’d stood outside that cinema at theHancock premiere waiting, for 
three hours, for Will Smith. I got a picture of his forehead and remember 
thinking: wow, this is so incredible. Now my goofy mug is on these pictures and 
I’m standing next toNicole Kidman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman>. My mum was very proud, and 
torn to pieces by the film.

Wasn’t your mother responsible for getting you into acting in the first place?
She is a big inspiration. She is a social butterfly, jovial, a real character. 
I’m far more introverted. She is the one made to go on screen, not me. The 
reason I’m in the industry is because of her. She saw an advert for theSkins 
audition inMetro, tore it out and dragged me along to the National Youth 
Theatre in London. I had to bunk off school.

You had lots of energy as a boy. Do you still?
It’s different now – I’d call it drive. When I was younger I was hyperactive. 
I did martial arts. When my friends saw me at the martial arts academy, they’d 
say: “This is a different Dev: you’re so calm and disciplined.” That is a big 
part of acting too. Part of the prep with Garth was trying to find stillness. 
Saroo is split in two – the child [Sunny Pawar] reacts to a harsh city and uses 
street smartness to survive. The Australian adult is more inward, battling 
demons, trawling through pixels on his laptop, trying to find his mother.

How did the real Saroo contribute?
He is a generous, confident young man. We’ve become close friends. He told me 
that when he first came to Australia as a child, he’d go to bed, his heart 
would race and he’d feel himself coming out of his body, hovering over India. 
He felt himself materialise on the streets, he’d find his mother and brother 
and tell them he was OK. He’d do that every night and wake in the morning 
sweating and exhausted.

Do you keep discovering new aspects of India with each film you make there?
India is a constant source of inspiration. I’m on my fifth film – The Hotel 
Mumbai <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5461944/> – about the attacks on the Taj 
hotel in 2008, another Australian/Indian co-production. ForLion, I travelled 
across India on trains and felt the isolation – partly because of not speaking 
the language. At each stop I’d hear a different dialect as the landscape slowly 
changed…
Watch the trailer for Lion. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jviCd7JqNc> 
You used to worry that the roles on offer for you were limited – do you still?
Yes and no. There should not be any limitation to playing my culture. I’m a 
British Asian, it is part of the fabric of who I am. My grandparents are from 
India and Nairobi. So what I’m trying to say is thatLion and Marigold and The 
Man Who Knew Infinity are completely different. Journalists sometimes label 
them as “Indian guys” as if this were an umbrella term.

What have you learned from working with great actors such as Judi Dench, 
Maggie Smith and Nicole Kidman? And what do they have in common?
They have a curiosity about life, a sense of humour and emotional reserve. I 
never went to acting school. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned from great 
directors and my co-stars. Acting is about honesty. When I began, I was trying 
to squeeze as much emotion out of roles as I could and get big laughs. Now it’s 
about doing less, cutting away the fat.

Did Google advise on Lion? And are you technical – your clapped-out BlackBerry 
has been mentioned in interviews…
Google helped us by digging out the 2008 version of Google Earth from their 
archives… and, no, I’m not technical. I’ve updated my BlackBerry only because I 
needed Uber. I have an iPhone but a very old one.

Do you ever feel your life is a dream?
All the time. I’m just this guy from Rayners Lane, how the hell did this 
happen? I’ve a friend, Sam, who tells me a story about perspective: think about 
living even two doors down from where you started – imagine how drastically 
different your life would have been. I’m lucky to have incredible parents. It 
takes a lot to let your son go at 16 to chase his dream. I’m excited to be 
bringing them to LA for the first time to stay in my new house.

 What projects of your own are you working on?
I’m writing a hyper-modern action film, based on 5,000-year-old Hindu 
mythology, set in a heightened Bombay – an anthem for youth.

Do you ever stop working?
I’m about to catch a plane to Australia and have 22 hours peace. Saroo and his 
family will be there for the Sydney premiere.

Do Saroo and his family approve of the film?
Our producer told me that they rented a private theatre to see it. Saroo sat 
in one corner to experience the film alone. Sue and John, the mother and 
father, were in the middle, holding hands. Mantosh [his adoptive brother] was 
in the other corner. When the lights came up, they all came together and were 
holding each other’s hands and crying. I thought that was beautiful.

Lion opens on Friday
