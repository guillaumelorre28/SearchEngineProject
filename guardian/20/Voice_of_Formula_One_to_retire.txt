Murray Walker, the voice of Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone>, is to retire from his job at 
the end of the 2001 season.

He had become as famous for his television malapropisms as for his 
encyclopaedic knowledge of the sport, with remarks such as, "Do my eyes deceive 
me or is Senna's car sounding a bit rough?".

But critics have claimed he has become worse in the past few years and 
suggested he should retire.

Walker, who has been covering the sport for 51 years, reacted bitterly to a 
recent article in the Daily Mail which accused him of being like Albert Steptoe.

Mr Walker worked for the BBC for 40 years before shocking the TV establishment 
by joining ITV when it bought the rights to Grand Prix racing three years ago.

After fighting in the second world war, he worked in the advertising industry 
where he worked as a copywriter for petfood and confectionery products.

ITV is to announce the name of his replacement today.
