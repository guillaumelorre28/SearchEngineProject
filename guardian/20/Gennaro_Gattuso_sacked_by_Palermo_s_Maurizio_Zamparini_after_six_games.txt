Gennaro Gattuso's coaching adventure at Palermo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> has lasted only six competitive 
games as the former Italy and Milan midfielder was sacked on Wednesday.

The 35-year-old was shown the door following Tuesday's 2-1 defeat at Bari, 
their second straight loss in Serie B. They lost 1-0 at La Spezia on Saturday.

Under Gattuso, Palermo have won two of their opening six games, not enough to 
impress Palermo's president, Maurizio Zamparini, who has opted to make a 
coaching change.

A statement from Zamparini said: "It is with true and profound sadness that I 
announce the dismissal of Gennaro Gattuso as coach of the first team. The 
results have forced us to take this decision.

"Perhaps he [Gattuso] and I have taken a step too far in what was his first 
experience as coach, in a club and a city as challenging as Palermo is. I have 
decided to appoint experienced Giuseppe Iachini as his replacement, handing him 
the task to lead the team back to Serie A."

Palermo were relegated to the second tier last season. Gattuso joined the 
Sicilian club this summer after a spell as a Sion player-coach last term. He 
becomes the 20th manager to be sacked by Zamparini since the Italian 
businessman bought Palermo 11 years ago.
