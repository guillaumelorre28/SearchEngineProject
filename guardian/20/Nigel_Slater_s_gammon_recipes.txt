Too often, a piece of gammon is cooked only at Christmas and even then only 
when it’s large enough to brain a goose. Yet the smaller cuts, a kilo or so in 
weight, are good value and will satisfy six of you. There may even be some left 
for a sandwich. Thin slices stuffed into a soft roll with wisps of watercress 
and a splodge of mouth-tingling chilli jam gets my vote. Especially if it’s 
eaten in the style of a couch potato.

A spicy glaze will offset the mildness of the meat. Mustard and chilli is the 
usual suggestion, but I like some sweetness there, too, in the form of honey or 
marmalade. It’s better still if there is enough glaze to bubble down in the pan 
and allow each of us a spoonful of hot sauce to spread on our moist, pink ham.

Remove the skin and spread the glaze over the joyous, quivering fat beneath

This time I used maple syrup and apricot preserve, the latter added for its 
deep fruitiness, spiked rather enthusiastically with two mustards and ground 
chilli. The English mustard slaps you in the face, while the mellower French 
comes along to apologise. The balance of sweet and heat can be tweaked exactly 
as you wish.

I simmer the meat for an hour then remove the string and the skin, spreading 
the glaze over the joyous, quivering fat beneath. This gives you deliciously 
juicy meat with a dark and bittersweet edge. Keep an eye on it in the oven, a 
few minutes too long and you will have the devil of a roasting tin to contend 
with.

Any leftover meat is a prime candidate for a salad the next day. I made one 
this week that would be a happy recipient for the leftovers, the ham torn 
rather than sliced and tossed among the figs, crisp beetroot and hazelnuts of 
the season. I offer the salad over the page, and leave it up to you to add the 
ham as the mood takes you.

Maple mustard gammon

The glaze is on the spicy side. If you wish, reduce the amount of English 
mustard by half. Washing up can be a bit of a chore. May I suggest a nonstick 
roasting tin?

Serves 6
gammon 1½kg, unsmoked, boned, rolled and tied
bay leaves 3
onion ½ 
black peppercorns 12
cinnamon stick 1
peaches 3

For the marinade:
maple syrup 250ml 
apricot or peach jam 3 tbsp
English mustard 3 tsp
grain mustard 3 tbsp
ground chilli ½ tsp

Put the gammon, rolled and tied, into a very large pot then add the bay 
leaves, onion, peppercorns and cinnamon. Pour in enough water to almost cover 
the top of the meat, a good 2 litres. Bring the water to the boil, then skim 
and discard any froth that rises to the surface. Leave at a gentle simmer, 
partially covered by a lid, for an hour. Check from time to time that the water 
isn’t reducing too much – it should always be just covering the meat. Turn the 
meat over after half an hour.

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.

What you are after is a golden sticky crust and sweet pink meat

Lift the gammon from its cooking liquor and into a roasting tin. You can 
dispense with the cooking water as it has done its job and is probably too 
salty to use as stock. Remove the string and flabby skin from the gammon, 
leaving in place the fat that lies underneath. Score the fat with a large 
kitchen knife, preferably in a lattice pattern, so the marinade can get below 
the surface.

Make the marinade by mixing the maple syrup, jam, mustards and chilli 
together. Spoon the marinade over the meat, pushing it right into the scored 
fat with the back of a spoon. Slice the peaches in half, remove the stones and 
place the fruit around the meat, turning them in the marinade.

Bake for 25 minutes, basting the meat a couple of times with the marinade from 
the tin. It will thicken as the meat cooks. What you are after is a golden, 
sticky crust and sweet pink meat.

Serve in thin slices, together with a tuft of watercress if you fancy, and the 
peaches and sauce from the tin.

The Observer 
Serves 2
For the dressing:
honey 1 tsp
white wine vinegar 2 tbsp
fennel seeds 2 tsp
beetroot 1 small, red, white or candy 
cobnuts or hazelnuts a handful
apples 2 small
lemon juice 1 squeeze
figs 4
blue cheese 200g

Put the honey in a bowl, then combine with the white wine vinegar. Lightly 
crush the fennel seeds using a pestle and mortar then add them. Peel and thinly 
slice the beetroot then push the slices into the marinade, turning them over so 
they are thoroughly coated. Set aside and leave for a good hour.

If you are using fresh cobnuts, crack open the shells and extract the nuts. 
Don’t toast them, simply cut them in half. If you are using hazelnuts then 
toast them in a dry, shallow pan and rub them in a dry cloth until the skins 
flake off. You may need more than one attempt. Cut the nuts in half.

Cut the apples in quarters and remove the core. Slice into thin wedges and 
toss briefly in a little lemon juice to stop discolouring. Tear the figs in 
half. Toss together the apples, figs and nuts, and pile on plates. Set the 
beetroot slices among them. Break the blue cheese into large pieces and tuck 
into the salad. Trickle the marinade from the beetroot over the salad.
