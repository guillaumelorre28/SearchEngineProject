More than 20 MPs have signed a motion condemning football clubs for banning 
journalists from their grounds <http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2013-14/844>. 

The early day motion names five clubs - Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest>, Crawley Town, Port 
Vale and Rotherham - as culprits.

It calls on the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> and the Football 
Association to introduce a code of conduct about the treatment of journalists.

Thus far, 23 MPs have signed up, of whom 20 are Labour members. Perhaps Tories 
were unimpressed with the motion's supportive reference to the National Union 
of Journalists, whichwrote to Newcastle's owner, Mike Ashley, in October to 
complain about the ban on journalists.

So well done to Peter Bottomley for being the lone Conservative signatoryâ€¦ for 
the moment anyway.
