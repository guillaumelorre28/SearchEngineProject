Reus, who missed Euro 2016 and has not played since he sustained an adductor 
muscle injury in May, returned to team training this week and was reported to 
be in contention, despite a lack of match fitness.

“[Marco Reus] has minor heel problems. In order to not risk anything given his 
very long absence, playing is not possible tomorrow,” Dortmund said on Friday.

The Ruhr valley club, who have already qualified for the Champions League’s 
knockout stage

, are fifth in the Bundesliga, six points behind the leaders Bayern.

Carlo Ancelotti’s side will be without the winger Arjen Robben, who was ruled 
out with a muscle injury sustained on international duty, the defender Javi 
Martínez and the winger Kingsley Coman.

Robben was injured while playing for Holland against Luxembourg last week but 
hoped to be fit for the match.

The Brazilian Douglas Costa and Chile’s Arturo Vidal are also doubtful after 
they also returned with minor injuries from their international matches. “We 
had a lot of problems with the international matches,” said Ancelotti. “Other 
teams have problems with their international players as well.

“The schedule in the European competitions is too full. I am no sports 
administrator but there has to be a solution.”
