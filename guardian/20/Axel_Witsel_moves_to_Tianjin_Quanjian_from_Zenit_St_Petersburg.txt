“It was a very difficult decision because on one hand there was a great team 
and a top club like Juventus,” Witsel said this week.

“But on the other there was a crucial offer for my family that I couldn’t turn 
down. The leadership at Juventus have always behaved like gentlemen with me and 
I can only be grateful to them.

“I will cheer for Juventus and I hope they can win the Champions League. Then 
who knows, maybe one day in the future our paths will finally meet.”
