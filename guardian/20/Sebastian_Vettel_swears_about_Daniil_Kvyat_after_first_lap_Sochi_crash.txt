Nico Rosberg won the Russian Grand Prix after making it through the first few 
corners cleanly and remaining cool throughout the race, unaware that behind him 
tempers had flared. Ferrari’sSebastian Vettel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sebastian-vettel> let loose an 
expletive-filled tirade after he was knocked out on lap one of the Russian 
Grand Prix by Red Bull’s Daniil Kvyat. Indeed, such was Vettel’s fury that he 
went on to have words with his former boss Christian Horner, Kvyat’s team 
principal.

The drivers already had history after Vettel was very critical of Kvyat when 
he dived up the inside of him on turn oneat the last round in China

, causing him to turn into his Ferrari team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen. Here Kvyat 
was too hot going into turn two and went up the back of Vettel before giving 
him another tap, causing him to spin into the wall at turn three, ending his 
race.

Vettel, who has one DNF already after failing to start in Bahrain, was not 
pleased even before he knew who had caused the accident. “I’m out. Crashed. 
Somebody hit me in the fucking rear at turn two and then somebody hit me in the 
fucking rear again in turn three,” he shouted. “Honestly, what the fuck are we 
doing here?”

Kvyat was given a stop-go penalty which, said Vettel, “doesn’t help me, as I 
am hereand the race is still happening

”. Asked if he would speak to the Russian driver, he said: “If anybody needs to 
talk to somebody, I guess it is him.” Indeed, to ensure that someone did Vettel 
went to Horner, with whom he had won four world championships, on the pit wall 
mid-race, to ensure the message he would not say publicly was passed on.

“Obviously he was slightly frustrated,” said Horner, when asked what Vettel 
had said. “All I could do was apologise because this week it was unfortunately 
a mistake by Daniil Kvyat.”

Horner added of the Russian: “The emotions run high with all these guys. At 
his home race I think he’s just gone for too much too soon.”

Having made his point, Vettel left the track without his usual press 
interviews.
