It used to be said that no actor ever succeeded as Macbeth and that it was 
more a brilliant poem than a stageable play. Both ideas have been knocked on 
the head in my lifetime. As a teenager, I was lucky enough to seeOlivier's 
guilt-haunted, spiritually desolate Macbeth

 (1955) three times. Two later productions forced one to re-examine the play 
itself.Trevor Nunn <http://www.mckellen.com/stage/nunn.htm> in 1976 turned 
Stratford's The Other Place – nothing more than a converted tin shed – into a 
place of conspiratorial black magic: we, the audience, sat around a chalk 
circle in which Ian McKellen's thane and Judi Dench's Lady Macbeth seemed to be 
in touch with the forces of darkness. Then in 2007 Rupert Goold directed a 
production, first in Chichester and later in the West End and New York, that 
seemed even more horrific: the Witches appeared in the guise of ministering 
nurses, blood spewed out of kitchen-taps andPatrick Stewart turned Macbeth into 
a figure of Stalinesque monstrosity

Macbeths, I also recall Yukio Ninagawa's Japanese production (Edinburgh 1985), 
which with its cascading cherry-blossom and plangent music became a melancholic 
meditation on human transience.
