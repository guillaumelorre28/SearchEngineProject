The winner of Brazil’s MasterChef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/masterchef> Professionals show has 
been hailed as a feminist hero after shrugging off sexist comments and boorish 
behaviour from her male competitors who ignored her suggestions, undermined her 
abilities – and on one occasion even told her to sweep the floor.

The victory for Dayse Paparoto, 32, from Mogi das Cruzes in the interior of 
São Paulo state was seen as vindication by Brazilians angry over what they saw 
as sexist, condescending treatment meted out to her by the male competitors.

It was the latest in a series of episodes when social media has provided an 
outlet for frustration over Brazilian machismo.

“You’re our warrior,” tweeted one viewer after Paparoto was crowned winner on 
Tuesday night.

Brazilian media reported her male contestants were downcast after her win. 
One, Ivo Lopes, had even once been her boss. At one point during the 
competition, Lopes had said: “Working with a woman in the kitchen is a little 
more delicate, I’ll be realistic. She ends up being a little more fragile.”

Many Brazilians were appalled – and took to social media to show it. One 
widely shared tweet 
<https://twitter.com/janellemonelle/status/806337261600174082> joked that the 
Paparoto’s main dish would be “fragile sexist in a soup of tears”.

A video compilation of the worst moments Paparoto endured has been watched 12m 
times on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/bia.varanis/posts/1038222369637917?pnref=story>. Her 
frustration was palpable as the men failed in tasks because they had brushed 
aside her suggestions or flatly ignored her. It included the moment when Lopes 
told her to “get a broom and sweep the floor”.


“Respect the girls,” posted Bia Varanis, who shared the video.

In one interview from the programme featured on the Facebook video 
compilation, Paparoto addressed the issue.

“In a man’s mind, to go to the final against another man, OK. But to go to the 
final with a woman, the possibility to lose to a woman, I think it gets to 
them, it’s a little embarrassing, for them,” she said.

But despite the reaction from viewers, Paparoto told the Guardian she did not 
feel she faced sexism on the show.

“I don’t see myself as a feminist,” she said. “I think there is sexism in any 
place in the world, not just inBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil>
, not just in the kitchen, not in the office. It is everywhere.”

Paparoto said she was surprised to win.

“I am a little insecure as a person,” she said, adding that for the time being 
she plans to keep working at São Paulo’s Feed Food restaurant, which shared 
photos of her holding the trophy on its Facebook.

“It is not an easy profession,” Paparoto, who has been a chef for 14 years, 
added. “You have to handle a lot of pressure.”

Brazilian women – and also men – are increasingly using social media to 
challenge the sexism rooted in this deeply conservative and traditional society.

In 2014, after many Brazilians said in a survey that women wearing revealing 
clothing were to blame for sexual assaults, tens of thousands posted photos 
online with the slogan “I don’t deserve to be raped”.

The following year, Brazil’s MasterChef programme also provoked online outrage 
from Brazilian women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/11/brazil-explicit-tweets-junior-masterchef-star-online-campaign-against-abuse-sexual-harassment>
 after men posted lewd comments on social media about a 12-year-old girl 
contestant. Tens of thousands shared experiences of sexual harassment and abuse 
they had suffered as children and teenagers, using the hashtag #primeiroassédio 
(first harassment).
