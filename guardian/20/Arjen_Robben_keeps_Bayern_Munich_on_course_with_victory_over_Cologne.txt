Arjen Robben continued his spectacular form by setting up two goals and 
scoring another to guide the reigning championsBayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> to a 4-1 win over Cologne 
at the Allianz Arena on Friday and crown celebrations for their 115-year 
anniversary.

The Bavarians, who have now scored 18 goals in their last three Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> games, extended their 
lead at the top of the table to 11 points over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, who 
travel to in-form Werder Bremen on Sunday.

Bayern started the party with a third-minute goal from Bastian Schweinsteiger 
who rose high to head in a Robben corner. Franck Ribéry doubled the lead seven 
minutes later with a low drive through the legs of a defender as Bayern carved 
through the Cologne defence at will.

However, the visitors pulled one back when Anthony Ujah nodded the ball in on 
the stroke of half-time.

Bayern struggled in the second half as the hard-working Cologne defence 
contained them more efficiently, and were almost level when Ujah forced Manuel 
Neuer to make the save of the game when the Nigerian’s point-blank volley was 
turned aside by the Germany No1.

The Bundesliga top scorer Robben then settled Bayern nerves with a cleverly 
placed header at the far post on 67 minutes for his 17th league goal of the 
season.

Robert Lewandowski made it 4-1 when he chested the ball over the line 
following another assist from the 31-year-old Robben.

Bayern are now on 58 points with Wolfsburg on 47. Borussia Moenchengladbach 
are a further 10 points behind in third.

Last season’s runners-up Borussia Dortmund, eyeing a fourth straight win, take 
on fourth-placed Schalke in the Ruhr Valley derby on Saturday.
