My first memory of this play 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/16/how-we-made-top-girls>, which 
I directed at theRoyal Court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/royal-court-theatre> in 1982, differs from 
Caryl’s. So, I may be purveying a myth here, but I am sticking with it.

We had gone for a walk to the Chelsea Physic Garden 
<http://chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk/> and had stopped to sit by a bed of 
Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) when Caryl handed me two typewritten pages. They 
were monologues, one from a Victorian traveller (Isabella Bird) and another 
from a Japanese courtesan (Lady Nijo), which Caryl had begun to intercut.

In the succeeding weeks, I read the evolution of this extraordinary dinner 
party, attended by famous women from history, includingPope Joan 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Joan> and Bruegel’s Dulle Griet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/14/art>. And I read it with 
increasing dismay. It was clear the play demanded a cast of at least 16 – way 
beyond the reach of the Royal Court in the early 80s. In a subsequent meeting, 
she gently explained that the whole play could be doubled and played with a 
cast of seven.

Top Girls opened in August. It received good reviews but by no means raved. 
Then in December it opened at the Public Theater in New York.Joe Papp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/11/theatre.stage> shamelessly 
presented it as a major London hit and the show was packed out. It opened for a 
second run at London’s Royal Court in February 1983, now billed truthfully as a 
New York hit – and it duly packed out.

 Suspicious mind … Katherine Tozer and Kevin McKidd in Far Away at the Royal 
Court, 2000. Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis 
Written in 2000, Far Away ranks, in my mind at least, as the last great play 
of the previous century – or the first great play of this one. It begins with a 
child, newly arrived in the home of her aunt, complaining that she can’t sleep 
because she can hear people screaming in the shed. By the end of the scene, she 
has received her first education in the terrible necessities of war. In the 
play’s final scene, war is total: the weather is on the side of the Japanese, 
while gravity has made a tactical alliance with the Bolivians. The sheer power 
of Caryl Churchill’s imagination, along with an economy of language that never 
fails to astonish, forces the viewer to confront a picture of an entire planet 
mobilised against itself. I have been haunted by this play since the first time 
I read it. But I can’t stop reading it.

Information at the Royal Court, 2012. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the 
Guardian 
What’s extraordinary is how each work is so different. In 2012, I was in Love 
and Information: it’s a series of scenes, some very short, that are 
predominantly two-handers. There were more than 100 characters shared by a cast 
of 16 with a range of ages, backgrounds and races.

They’re essentially intimate conversations: we were asked to make the simplest 
connections we could in order to tell each story, rather than over-define what 
the characters’ relationships were. It felt like you were handing the baton 
over from scene to scene. It was invigorating, but terrifying. At one point I 
was playing an opera singer, then a pregnant woman, then a nagging wife …

Even in its structure, it was so ahead of its time. Caryl captured something 
about us living in an information age – how we’ve all become more adept at 
receiving information in small chunks, how the way we process that information 
affects how we all connect.

She doesn’t impose her views, which some people find almost uncomfortable. 
They want to know what Love and Information meant. She never felt like she 
needed to say. She encourages you to observe and answer those questions for 
yourself.

I grow vegetables now in my little garden. I’m obsessed. I have tomatoes, 
celery, chillies. I’m growing lettuce, too.

I water the lettuce, but it just isn’t yielding. Is it the lettuce or is it 
me? Did the garden centre give me bad seeds, or am I not caring for it 
correctly? Should I buy some special soil for it? Is it too exposed? Too much 
sun? Too much water? I hate the lettuce. I want to kill it. This one’s no good. 
I only want lettuce that will grow to be really green and crisp.

As I think about ripping the lettuce up, I remember lines from A Number, 
Caryl’s play about the question of nature and nurture, of who we are and how we 
are. “We’ve got 99% the same genes as any other person. We’ve got 90% the same 
as a chimpanzee. We’ve got 30% the same as a lettuce. Does that cheer you up at 
all? … It makes me feel I belong.”

I leave the lettuce be.
