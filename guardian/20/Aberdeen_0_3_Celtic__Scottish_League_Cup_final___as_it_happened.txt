Celtic fans celebrate with their fans after a thoroughly deserved victory. 
Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> showed plenty of 
endeavour, but rarely threatened Craig Gordon, and lacked the quality Celtic 
showed in taking the first-half goals that decided this final.

It‚Äôs a historic day for Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, 
as they take their trophy count into treble figures. More immediately, it‚Äôs 
their first under Brendan Rodgers, and with a healthy league lead, they have 
every chance of securing a different kind of treble later this season.

Thanks for joining me. Ewan Murray‚Äôs report will follow shortly. Bye!
 Scott Brown and Craig Gordon celebrate winning the final with the trophy.

More on Jayden Stockley, from Matt Loten:

‚ÄúAs a Portsmouth fan, I also got the chance to watch Stockley up close in the 
basement league last season. After a couple of goals in a dozen loan 
appearances, we surprisingly declined to take our interest further, deciding 
instead that pretty much anyone else on the planet would do as good a job.‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit sorry for the lad.

52 mins: Rooney collects Shinnie‚Äôs ball down the left, and threads a dangerous 
low ball across goal. There‚Äôs nobody in a red shirt in the box, but Izaguirre 
nervously puts it behind. The corner almost falls to O‚ÄôConnor, who is inches 
from connecting with a diving header.

Here‚Äôs Simon McMahon: 

‚ÄúAfternoon Niall. Of course, Dundee United would have beaten Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> in the semi-final, and would 
now be giving Celtic a better game, had we not inexplicably lost to Morton in 
the last eight. We‚Äôd most likely have beaten Barcelona midweek too, given that 
our competitive record against them is played 4, won 4. Anyway, cocktails on me 
if this goes to extra time.‚Äù

42 mins: A goal for Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> 
here would give them a glimmer of hope for the second half. Maddison‚Äôs corner 
is met by O‚ÄôConnor, but his looped header is claimed by Gordon.

40 mins: Celtic fans are engaged in a mass ‚Äòhuddle‚Äô behind the goal, making 
Hampden Park bounce. Their mood is only improved by Rooney‚Äôs wild effort from 
20 yards, which flies into the stand.

Celtic brush Aberdeen aside and claim League Cup as 100th major trophy

Celtic fans celebrate with their fans after a thoroughly deserved victory. 
Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> showed plenty of 
endeavour, but rarely threatened Craig Gordon, and lacked the quality Celtic 
showed in taking the first-half goals that decided this final.

It‚Äôs a historic day for Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, 
as they take their trophy count into treble figures. More immediately, it‚Äôs 
their first under Brendan Rodgers, and with a healthy league lead, they have 
every chance of securing a different kind of treble later this season.

Thanks for joining me. Ewan Murray‚Äôs report will follow shortly. Bye!
 Scott Brown and Craig Gordon celebrate winning the final with the trophy.

<https://twitter.com/celticfc/status/802918183548157952>  
91 mins: Celtic fans belt out ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll Never Walk Alone‚Äô, scarves aloft. This 
one has been over since Demb√©l√© slotted that penalty away.
 
90 mins: Forrest, the game‚Äôs standout player is replaced by Griffiths, who 
looks miffed after waiting four minutes to come on. There‚Äôs only two minutes 
left.
 
89 mins: Maddison, Aberdeen‚Äôs standout player today, curls a shot straight at 
Gordon as the Dons search for a consolation.
 
More on Jayden Stockley, from Matt Loten:

‚ÄúAs a Portsmouth fan, I also got the chance to watch Stockley up close in the 
basement league last season. After a couple of goals in a dozen loan 
appearances, we surprisingly declined to take our interest further, deciding 
instead that pretty much anyone else on the planet would do as good a job.‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit sorry for the lad.
 
87 mins: Leigh Griffiths is coming on, and will touch the trophy for longer 
than the ball.
 
85 mins: Chris Sutton and Stewart are now disagreeing for the sake of it as 
the game winds down. Sutton certainly has the air of a man directing an angry 
customer to the small print.
 
83 mins: Forrest finds space down the right and picks out Armstrong with a low 
cross. Armstrong fires wide ‚Äì that should‚Äôve been four.
 
81 mins: Niall McGinn caught offside, leading to a lengthy commentary box row 
between Michael Stewart and Chris Sutton, the latter admonishing McGinn for 
mistiming his run. Derek Rae has to step in after a full minute of back and 
forth.
 
79 mins: Adam Rooney‚Äôs afternoon is over. He‚Äôs replaced by Wes Burns.
 
‚ÄúI watched Jayden Stockley on a number of occasions at (the real) St James 
Park, whilst he was on loan with Exeter City towards the end of last season‚Äù 
says Robin Durie.

‚ÄúHe had a bit of potential, but, in truth, jobbing Division 4 striker seemed 
to be pretty much his level... orScottish League Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup> Final substitute. 
Which casts further light on where things stand with Scottish football. Sadly.‚Äù

He did score a lovely chip a few weeks ago...
 
77 mins: Rogic, scorer of the opening goal, goes off to a huge ovation. He‚Äôs 
replaced by Callum McGregor.
 
75 mins: Armstrong is given time to cut inside, twist and turn before firing 
over from the edge of the box.Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> have repeatedly failed to close 
Celtic down in the final third, and are going to pay for it.
 
74 mins: Stockley and McGinn have been unable to make any impact, with Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> sitting deep to see this out. 
McGinn does get a low cross in, but it‚Äôs cleared with ease at the near post.
 
72 mins: Maddison dances past Bitton, who tugs at his shirt and is booked. 
Replays show that theAberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> 
man went down a little enthusiastically, and his free kick sails straight into 
Craig Gordon‚Äôs arms.
 
69 mins: Scott Brown is showboating in the middle of the park. For Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen>, Johnny Hayes is replaced by 
Niall McGinn.
 
67 mins: Celtic fans light up their phones in tribute to the 1967 European Cup 
winning team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/21/lisbon-lions-celtic-internazionale>
. Aberdeen are doing nothing to spoil their celebratory mood.
 
66 mins: The commentators reckon this will be Brendan Rodgers‚Äô first trophy as 
a manager. Surely this picture says different?
 Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  
64 mins: Changes! Stockley is on for O‚ÄôConnor a minute too late, while Nir 
Bitton replaces Patrick Roberts forCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
Moussa Demb√©l√©, who has scored in the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-final, 
sends Lewis the wrong way to complete the set, and surely win the League Cup for
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.

Cairnduff/Reuters  
O‚ÄôConnor, about to be replaced, is caught cold by Forrest cutting into the 
area to collect Rogic‚Äôs pass, and upends theCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> midfielder. That‚Äôs stonewall, I‚Äôm 
afraid.
 
60 mins: Armstrong overhits a through ball to Roberts, who pushes Logan over 
in pursuit of a lost cause.Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> give the ball away in midfield, 
and Rogic hits a shot from distance that Lewis is right behind.
 
59 mins: Izaguirre misjudges a high ball, allowing it to bounce through to 
O‚ÄôConnor, whose attempted pull back floats over the bar. Jayden Stockley is set 
to come on forAberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen>.
 
58 mins: Forrest, who has been excellent alongside Rogic in midfield, is given 
space to step forward, and fires an angled shot just over the bar.
 
57 mins: Aberdeen finding some joy with direct balls into the box, and Logan 
gets forward from right-back to collect Hayes‚Äô cut-back ‚Äì but Forrest does 
brilliantly to deflect his shot over the bar. From the corner, Maddison is 
offside.
 
55 mins: In another curious bit of officiating, Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> win a corner after McLean‚Äôs 
header. Maddison aims for the near post, Celtic head clear, and Brown is there 
to deal with Maddison‚Äôs low return ball.
 
54 mins: Celtic again look to settle things down, draining Aberdeen‚Äôs momentum 
with a long spell of possession ‚Äì until a foul on Izaguirre goes unpunished,
Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> break, and McLean 
heads wide from Hayes‚Äô cross.
 
52 mins: Rooney collects Shinnie‚Äôs ball down the left, and threads a dangerous 
low ball across goal. There‚Äôs nobody in a red shirt in the box, but Izaguirre 
nervously puts it behind. The corner almost falls to O‚ÄôConnor, who is inches 
from connecting with a diving header.
 
50 mins: Jack lifts a long free kick into the box, and Rooney can‚Äôt get a 
touch on Taylor‚Äôs useful flick-on. Lustig eases the pressure by winning a cheap 
free kick, going down in stages in front of McLean, who is penalised.
 
49 mins: Maddison breaks away at speed and Brown does the necessary, 
body-checking his willowy opponent and earning an inevitable booking.
 
47 mins: Aberdeen make a meal of dealing with a Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> attack, with Roberts getting in 
behind and heading back towards Forrest, who prods the ball towards Demb√©l√©, 
whose header from an angle is blocked by Lewis.
 
Here‚Äôs Simon McMahon: 

‚ÄúAfternoon Niall. Of course, Dundee United would have beaten Aberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> in the semi-final, and would 
now be giving Celtic a better game, had we not inexplicably lost to Morton in 
the last eight. We‚Äôd most likely have beaten Barcelona midweek too, given that 
our competitive record against them is played 4, won 4. Anyway, cocktails on me 
if this goes to extra time.‚Äù
 
46 mins: Rogic is again given too much space in midfield, but his attempted 
pass to Demb√©l√© is cut out by Taylor.
 
We‚Äôre off. Both sides playing towards their own fans in the second half.
 
The players are heading back out for the second half; no changes for either 
side.Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> do have a few 
attacking options on the bench.
 
Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> learnt a hard lesson 
in that first half ‚Äì you‚Äôve got to track the runners:
 
Two well-taken goals from Tom Rogic and James Forrest, and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have a deserved lead; trophy 
No100 is 45 minutes away.
 
44 mins: Hayes lifts a long free kick into the area, and Taylor uses his 
considerable frame to get above Scott Brown ‚Äì but his flick-on is cleared.
 
42 mins: A goal for Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> 
here would give them a glimmer of hope for the second half. Maddison‚Äôs corner 
is met by O‚ÄôConnor, but his looped header is claimed by Gordon.
 
40 mins: Celtic fans are engaged in a mass ‚Äòhuddle‚Äô behind the goal, making 
Hampden Park bounce. Their mood is only improved by Rooney‚Äôs wild effort from 
20 yards, which flies into the stand.
 
38 mins: Aberdeen, completely overrun in the lead-up to Forrest‚Äôs goal, win a 
corner, but Taylor has the ball taken away from him by a vital near-post touch 
from Demb√©l√©.
 
James Forrest is again allowed to run forward from central midfield, steps 
away from O‚ÄôConnor and fires into the far corner from 20 yards! Expertly taken, 
andCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are in control.
