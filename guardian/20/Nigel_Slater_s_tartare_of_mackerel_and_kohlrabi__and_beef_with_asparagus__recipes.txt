Two mackerel glistening on crushed ice. Stiff as boards, shining blue and 
black and silver. Fish so fresh I shall not even show them the bars of the 
grill. Their flesh, so sweet and firm, will instead be eaten raw, diced and 
tossed with something crisp (cucumber maybe, or apple) and dressed very 
gingerly with Japanese pepper and a squirt of lime.

Once I have the fish at home, filleted by the fishmonger and its annoying pin 
bones removed with kitchen tweezers, I change my mind about the cucumber and 
toss the diced fish with shredded kohlrabi as crisp as a Granny Smith. The 
seasoning is shichimi togarashi, the table condiment almost as popular in Japan 
as black pepper is here. It usually contains ground chilli, sesame, orange 
peel, ginger and nori, but there are variations. Think hot, sweet and aromatic. 
We pile the mackerel on to tissue-thin crackers.

A day or two later, there is a tartare of meat, too. A piece of lean, raw 
steak dressed with eye-watering fresh horseradish and the salty warmth of 
anchovy. And there is raw asparagus at its side, crisp and snappy, tossed with 
a mustardy dressing. The oven is having a well-earned rest.

Tartare of mackerel and kohlrabi

I like some thin croutes or crackers with this, such as carta di musica. To 
skin the mackerel, place a fillet, skin-side down, on a chopping board. Holding 
the tail end with your thumb and finger, slide the knife in as close to your 
finger as you can, then, keeping the blade as flat to the skin as possible, 
slide it between flesh and skin, slicing the flesh away from the skin. Use only 
fresh fish and keep it cold at all times.

Serves 4 as a starter or light lunch kohlrabi 75g 
lemon juice 2 tbsp
mackerel fillet 350g
pickled sushi ginger 6 pieces 
togarashi seasoning 1-2 tsp to taste
lime juice 2 tsp
shoyu sauce 3-4 tsp to taste
shiso leaves (optional, to serve)


For the salad:
samphire 75g
cherry tomatoes 200g
mirin 25ml
lime juice 2 tsp
sesame oil ½ tsp


Cut any long stems and leaves from the kohlrabi. You don’t need to peel it if 
the skin is pale and thin. Squeeze the lemon juice into a mixing bowl. Grate 
the kohlrabi on the coarse teeth of a grater into the juice, tossing gently to 
coat and to prevent the white flesh from discolouring.

The fish, so sweet and firm, will be eaten raw, diced and tossed with 
something crisp

Using a very sharp, thin cook’s knife, remove the skin from the mackerel. Chop 
the flesh finely. How finely you do this is up to you, but I prefer it 
somewhere between fine dice and coarse mince. Much depends on how dextrous you 
are with your knife.

Shred the ginger and add it to the fish. Gently fold the togarashi seasoning, 
lime juice and shoyu sauce into the fish then introduce the kohlrabi, tossing 
it all together without mashing the fish. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 
for an hour.

Rinse the samphire in cold water then put it into a bowl of cold water and ice 
for 30 minutes to crisp up. To make the salad accompaniment, remove the stalks 
from the tomatoes, then cut each in half or quarters depending on their size. 
In a small bowl mix together the mirin, lime juice and sesame oil.

Remove the samphire from the iced water, shake it dry, then add to the 
tomatoes. Pour the dressing over, toss it all together and chill until needed.

To serve, place the shiso or salad leaves on a long serving plate, then add a 
few spoonfuls of the tartare on each. Serve with the tomato salad.

the Observer 
The pickled cucumber is available from Asian stores and online, but you could 
use the usual European, less salty, ones if you prefer. The steak is up to you. 
Flank is good if you can find it, fillet if you can afford it.

rump steak 450g
parsley 5g
cucumber ½, small
Japanese pickled cucumber 3 tsp
anchovy fillets 3 
horseradish root a short piece, fresh 


For the salad:
Dijon mustard 2 tsp
water 25ml
olive oil 50ml
white-wine vinegar 2 tsp
spring onions 3
parsley leaves a small handful
asparagus 8 spears


The meat needs to be very cold. Slice it thinly, then put the slice on a plate 
and leave to chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. You just need to thoroughly 
chill and firm the meat.

Remove the leaves from the parsley, chop them quite finely, and put them in a 
mixing bowl. Roughly chop the pickled cucumber and add it to the parsley. Pat 
the anchovy with kitchen paper to remove any excess oil or salt then chop it 
finely and add it to the parsley. Grate 1 tbsp of fresh horseradish into the 
mixing bowl and toss the ingredients together.

Remove the meat from the freezer and cut into very fine dice. Fold the beef 
into the parsley and anchovy mixture. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the 
fridge.

Make the dressing: put the mustard, water, olive oil and white-wine vinegar 
into a jar, tighten the lid and shake it vigorously to mix. Remove the toughest 
of the green shoots from the spring onion and discard, then finely slice the 
white and pale green stems and add to the dressing.

Slice each piece of asparagus into two or three short lengths, then cut each 
piece in half lengthways. Toss the asparagus in the dressing and set aside.

To serve: place small piles of the beef on to plates, then at their side put 
large spoonfuls of the asparagus salad.
