Dominic Cooper: ‘I eat vast quantities of cheese to wind down’

Brought up in Greenwich, London, Dominic Cooper trained at the London Academy 
of Music and Dramatic Art. In 2001 he made his stage debut inMother Clap’s 
Molly House <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/sep/06/theatre.artsfeatures>
 and in 2003 starred inHis Dark Materials 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jan/05/theatre.fiction>, both at the 
National Theatre. In 2004 he was cast as Dakin in Alan Bennett’s playThe 
History Boys <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/23/theatre>; he played 
the role around the world and starred inthe film adaptation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/15/comedy.drama> in 2006. The same 
year, he was nominated for a Drama Desk award for the play’s Broadway 
production. He is starring inThe Libertine 
<http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/the-libertine/> at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 
until 3 December.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
It always starts with such good intentions, but ends up getting more and more 
chaotic. When I begin, I head to the stage when the auditorium is still closed; 
I like to lie down on the stage and breathe. Before the first night, I go among 
the stalls with another cast member, feeding each other lines to get a sense of 
the acoustics. But when you become more comfortable, you push it to the brink. 
I remember, fromThe History Boys in New York, a bunch of boys hurtling through 
the stage door with a red-faced stage manager in a sweaty panic, while we had 
pizza falling out of our mouths.

Have you ever missed an entrance?
Yes. I’ll never forget sitting with one of the History Boys, Andrew Knott, on 
the fire escape, chatting some sort of garbage about how one would rob a bank, 
and hearing these screams: our cue had been made and people were just 
improvising on stage because they didn’t know what else to do, and we’d missed 
almost the entire scene. That was lack of professionalism – it was after doing 
the play for years, but you can’t ever allow that to happen.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
Embarrassingly, at the moment I have the most extraordinarily vast dressing 
room at the Haymarket theatre. It’s bigger than my apartment in London, and 
done in a rather womb-like red. I always try and make a space as cosy as 
possible, light it nicely. But in this job the truth is I’m never in it – I 
rush in beforehand, hitch myself into a pair of tights, put on a periwig, and 
dash out again. It’s lovely having your own space, but then you go into the 
other guys’ dressing rooms and they’re together and there’s much more of an 
atmosphere.

How do you take care of yourself during a production run?
You start well, but a lot of it is quite hard to maintain, like any routine. 
I’ve never done a part like this – I’m on stage and talking most of the time, 
so I’m lucky I haven’t had any problems with my voice yet. It takes a vast 
amount out of you, especially when the stage is raked and you’re wearing the 
kind of shoes we are wearing. I suddenly realised it’s been seven years since I 
didPhèdre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/14/phedre-mirren-lyttelton-review> 
on stage [at the National], and being seven years older, you notice how much 
more exhausted you are. I remember actors constantly working out their nap 
time, and it is actually really important.

What do you love about being on stage?
It’s the reason I fell in love with acting. It’s mostly down to the 
interaction with the audience, and trying to understand the complexities of how 
different audiences react to the same piece of work. It still baffles me beyond 
belief how an audience evolve together in a group throughout an evening, and 
how you really have to be quite sensitive to them. It’s a never-ending 
challenge, which makes it terribly exciting. You’re constantly reworking 
yourself to make it better.

And anything you dislike about it?
It can frustrate you at times – especially if you’re doing something that has 
a lot of comedic moments in it and you get used to certain reactions, and then 
they don’t come again, you get annoyed with yourself for expecting that 
reaction, or getting complacent. But sometimes an audience can be completely 
silent and you think they’re not having a good time, but they’ve been loving it.

How do you wind down after a performance?
At the moment I go and eat vast quantities of cheese next door. Cheese and red 
wine – I’ve turned into the character. It’s nice to go and chat with people, 
and you need to calm down after the high energy that you’ve just been using to 
perform. You can’t just go home, really.

Do you like to receive guests in your dressing room?
It’s lovely when people come up. I don’t expect them to ever have to talk 
about the show, because I think it’s difficult for people to take in what 
they’ve just seen in such a short space of time. An age-old joke amongst actors 
and directors is that the only thing you can really say when you go round to a 
dressing room is, “Well done, how fantastic.” But it’s great when people pop 
up, except it’s terribly embarrassing because I never have anything nice to 
offer. Some rather unwashed, cracked champagne flutes with a bit of a sparkling 
Tesco prosecco are never received with much excitement. I must sort that out.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
When I did the National Theatre’s 50 Years on Stage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/nov/04/national-theatre-50th-birthday-highlights>
, I got a framed poster of Kraftwerk’s albumRadioactivity. That was a really 
thoughtful and gorgeous gift – it’s a cool poster, I love the band, and it 
reminds me of the production, which was a very special evening to be part of.

Rada-trained actor and theatre director Mark Rylance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance> has appeared in a number of 
acclaimed productions on both sides of the Atlantic, winning the Olivier award 
for best actor twice and the Tony for best actor in a play three times. He was 
born in Ashford, Kent, to English-teacher parents, and from 1995 to 2005 was 
the first artistic director ofShakespeare’s Globe in London 
<http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/?gclid=CjwKEAiAgavBBRCA7ZbggrLSkUcSJACWDexAvqsTyM0EnKUeZMogind_sd7AicOtyIMcciOe0NMWthoC8NXw_wcB>
. He is currently starring inNice Fish <http://www.nicefishtheplay.co.uk/>, a 
play he co-wrote with Louis Jenkins; directed by his wife Claire Van Kampen, 
it’s at the Harold Pinter theatre in London’s West End until 11 February.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I like to play some kind of game with the rest of the cast and stage 
management, such as ping pong or volleyball – a game that brings everyone out 
of their heads, out of their anxieties, into the present moment. And if it’s a 
game with a gentle competitive edge, it introduces that feeling of having an 
objective; those things get me in the right frame of mind. I read once that 
people asked Tina Turner: “How do you come out on stage with such a sense of 
love for the audience?” She revealed that she imagined the audience… that they 
had come from a distance, what their lives might be like. I’ve taken some of 
that on.

At the Globe, we used to do a ceremony at the beginning of each season. There 
was always an atmosphere of “We should count our lucky stars and remember the 
ancestors who have given us this thing.” Also, I was aware that the Globe is 
made of a thousand oak trees, all of them alive and all of them with their 
particular energy, and so there was a sense of it being a living building.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
I like to have pictures or cards that relate to particular aspects of the 
character I’m playing; pictures of people who are like them. I have gifts from 
my wife, from old friends. I wear a necklace that my daughter Juliet gave me: I 
feel it’s an expression of her love and her love for me is a protective, 
healthy thing. I like to put coloured lightbulbs in, too – bright green, 
yellow. I feel like I have some sort of fantasy that I’m in acarnevale or 
touring around with the circus. I like to share dressing rooms with other 
actors; ideally, I’d like the whole company to be together at the beginning and 
at the end of the play and share whatever joys or fears or things that are 
going on.

How do you take care of yourself during a production run?
There’s a physical aspect to performing eight times a week and exercise is 
important. I like to ride my bicycle to work and home afterwards, to have a 
sense of the city that I’m playing in. Mentally and spiritually, the biggest 
struggle in my career has been getting critical voices. It’s good to have a 
critical voice, like having a great editor who can improve your writing. I 
think of that voice like a coach, and at a certain stage in my career I 
realised I needed to have the coach stay in that little box that they have on 
the sideline in football matches. I didn’t wantJosé Mourinho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho> running around on the 
pitch shouting at me during the game. I was happy to have his advice after the 
game and before and maybe in the interval. But I was letting him run around on 
stage and shout at me all the time and that wasn’t so good. The best solution, 
for me at least, was not to kill the coach, but rather to define the 
relationship: that there is a time for critical thinking, and another time when 
you’re in the middle of the play and you just have to do the best you can and 
be forgiving of yourself.

What do you love most about being on stage?
I love the things that happen that aren’t prepared, that seem like mistakes 
but actually are a doorway into something new. And I love the kind of 
collective consciousness that takes place in a theatre when a play is working 
and the audience has been drawn into it and they’re hypersensitive and engaged.

And anything you dislike about it?
I don’t know that I dislike anything about it. Sometimes, if you’re doing a 
long run there are times you can feel you’ve got stuck in a rut, much like 
anyone can feel that about any job they do. But actually, even those days are 
usually just before something new happens.

How do you wind down after a performance?
I love going for a drink or a meal with the cast or friends or people who’ve 
come. I also like very much to have a game of poker on stage after a two-show 
day, with the crew and cast in the empty theatre. Those are great evenings. I 
take particular care now – I didn’t use to – to not only take off my costume 
but to also make sure I take off the obsessions or the needs of the character. 
Make sure I’m just me, Mark, and I’m just a person, not doing the thing that 
happens on stage.

Suki Dhanda for the Observer 
Born in Southall, west London, Duff trained at the Drama Centre 
<http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/drama-centre-london/> in London. She was nominated 
for an Olivier award for best actress in a supporting role forCollected Stories 
at the Royal Haymarket in 2000, and for best actress for her role inSaint Joan 
at the National in 2007. She is also known for her TV roles inShameless 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shameless> and The Virgin Queen 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjMrDcAK5c>, and for films including, most 
recently,Suffragette <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=056FI2Pq9RY> (2015). She 
is currently starring inOil 
<https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/oil/7-oct-2016-26-nov-2016> at the Almeida 
until 26 November.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I love to play games with the other actors, but they’re always 
character-dependent. I’m a really superstitious actor, so I have lots of silly 
little things that I do, and they change with every play. I don’t tell people, 
because I am a bit embarrassed about them. But I always, always have a shower 
at the half-hour call: it’s this feeling like I have to wash the day away, so 
that I’m all clean and fresh for the world of the play. I know it seems daft 
and a bit pretentious, but it’s like being a blank canvas. There’s something 
about water that just washes away everything that you bring into the theatre 
with you.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
In this particular theatre, all the girls are in the dressing room together, 
so it’s very giddy and giggly, and we have a blast. I love dressing rooms: 
they’re gorgeous rooms, full of cards and flowers, and they smell heavenly 
because of the makeup and perfume. Quite often you’ll use music to key into a 
character, so I always have that on standby with headphones. I also have a 
perfume for each character. I think there’s a little sense-memory about it, so 
if ever I smell that perfume on somebody else it will always remind me of a 
story I’ve told.

How do you take care of yourself during a production run?
I’ve got a six-year-old, so anything spiritual or physical left the building 
about six years ago. I’d love to say I do some marvellous laughing yoga or 
something an hour before a show, but I don’t. Generally speaking, I just get 
from the school run to the stage door. But I try to sleep as much as I can, and 
take care of my voice.

What do you love most about being on stage?
I think the most exciting thing is the space between you and the audience. 
There’s a real heat in that sort of invisible string you get between people – 
like somebody is holding your hand.

And anything you dislike about it?
I love it completely, but sometimes I get a bit cross about ticket prices. I 
wish that theatre was available to all kinds of people.

How do you wind down after a performance?
I like to sit with the other actors and have a bit of a giggle and a glass of 
wine. Or I like to get home and sneak in and watch my little boy sleeping. 
That’s a quite nice little wind-down. It puts me back in the real world.

Do you like to receive guests in your dressing room?
No. It’s a bit weird having outsiders come into your dressing room. It becomes 
this little zone that you become quite a purist about, and you only want people 
who are involved in there. We’re very territorial about our dressing rooms.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
I remember working at the Donmar Warehouse 
<http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/#eMxa8jFjPpvbR0sm.97> a few years ago and 
somebody gave me a life-size Elvis Presley cut-out, which I loved – I’m a huge 
fan. I stood him in the corner of my dressing room for the entire run – 
sometimes I might talk to him as well. I don’t have him any more – it was a 
long time ago, and I don’t know where I’d put him at home.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/25/michael-c-hall-interview-cold-in-july>
, 45, began his acting career on stage. Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, he 
first appeared on Broadway in 1999 as The Emcee in Sam Mendes’s production of
Cabaret and then took the title role in Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014. He 
is currently starring in the musicalLazarus <https://lazarusmusical.com/>, by 
David Bowie and Enda Walsh, at King’s Cross theatre, London, until 22 January.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I think rituals develop from production to production; I don’t have any 
hard-and-fast ones. With this show I’m on stage about 20 minutes before the 
show officially begins, so I allow that time to be a daily meditation. But 
that’s lying on stage in front of a 900-plus-seat theatre, people who have come 
to watch the show, so it’s not exactly private time.

What do you have in your dressing room?
In the past, with dressing rooms and other rooms that are in any way 
temporary, I’ve been inclined to treat them like a prison cell: “This isn’t my 
home; I’m not going to stay here for ever.” But lately I’ve done more to 
personalise them. With Lazarus it’s a pretty small space, but I’ve surrounded 
myself with some images that for one reason or another evoke the spirit of the 
show. Most of them are abstract: there’s aDavid Bomberg 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/david-bomberg-777> print called Ju-Jitsu 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bomberg-ju-jitsu-t00585> and an old, 
psychedelicMark Rothko <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rothko> image 
that looks like some sort of memory of a home planet. 

But music is important in my dressing room, too – music that helps. At the 
Mercury prize <http://www.mercuryprize.com/> ceremony I heard this band the 
Comet Is Coming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/01/the-comet-is-coming-psych-jazz-sun-ra-legacy>
, an electronic jazz group, and I was blown away by their performance. I got 
that album and I’ve been listening to it every night before the show. 

What do you love most about being on stage?
The immediacy. The fact that no one is waiting to take their turn; everyone is 
there occupying the space together, audience and actors.

And anything you dislike about it?
Cold season! Cold theatres. People coughing. It’s been pretty much perpetual 
withLazarus in London. But a lot of the cast are coughing too.

How do you wind down after a performance?
With this show, the first thing I do is shower. I take off my soaked costume, 
soaked with… well, some of us call it milk, some of us call it angel blood; 
whatever it is, I don’t want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I’m pretty 
much doused in it by the end of the show. So I take a shower and wash that and 
the evening off. Then I head home. I don’t really go out after the show very 
often any more. I am somewhat adrenalised at the end, and it usually takes at 
least a couple of hours before I feel like I can get into bed and hope to fall 
asleep. 

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
It would have to be a handwritten note and gift that I received from David 
Bowie on the opening night of the production in New York. It was a letter I’ll 
always cherish, and a gift that was a personal artefact from his life – one 
that I will keep for ever as a talisman. I opened the card and started reading 
it before I knew who it was from, and about halfway through the first page I 
realised it was from David and I was floored.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I like to get a feel of the auditorium. And all the usual warmup things: voice 
work, stretching. I quite like skipping. I like to delay having my costume on 
until the very last moment: I try to time it so that at the beginners’ call the 
last shoe is going on. I don’t like sitting around in costume; I feel the 
character is here now; it’s time for them to go and do what they need to do.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
It’s quite spartan: toiletries, my script, a couple of books. I don’t like 
clutter; I like to have a clear and focused space. There are no crystals, no 
glow-sticks, no blow-up dolls. I don’t have a lucky charm, but I feel 
incomplete if I don’t have the right hoodie around.

How do you take care of yourself during a production run?
I’m a bit of a gym enthusiast; I enjoy the discipline, the focus of it. The 
benefits for me are obvious: you are healthier; your lungs in particular are in 
good shape. The whole point of the training is not that you exhaust yourself 
before you actually get to the important bit – it’s to make yourself ready. I 
make sure I lay off the booze; if the next day you’ve got an eight-hour 
rehearsal, you don’t want to be groggy. At the end of the day I like to watch 
some mindless television at home, hang out with the family or play on the 
PlayStation. Anything to get your head out of it.

Is there anything you dislike about being on stage?
It is my passion and I absolutely love it. Every job comes with its downsides, 
but as far as I can see that’s the gig. I suppose the thing that can get me is 
when you see a member of the audience on their phones… save your money, stay at 
home.

How do you wind down after a performance?
There’s the practical stuff: you shower, it shakes the character off, as it 
were. I like to have at least five minutes alone, just quiet, on my own. That’s 
more of a personal wind-down, going: “We’re done, breathe. Now you can be you 
again.” If I have visitors I’ll hang out with them, have a drink, that’s always 
nice. The other thing I find very important is I walk – whether it’s just to 
public transport, or home of an evening, to unwind.

Do you like to receive guests in your dressing room?
I don’t. As far as I’m concerned that’s my office. It’s not a lounge, it’s not 
a greeting room… It’s the one space where you can go and gather your thoughts. 
In some instances, when there are VIPs who can’t necessarily sit with you in 
the bar, then yes, of course, you can allow someone to come in for five 
minutes. But generally, if I’m in the dressing room I’m in the zone. I’ll come 
and hang out at the bar and we can have a drink there.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
Recently I got a lovely T-shirt from a fellow cast member, who said: “This is 
to replace all the T-shirts that you sacrificed in the rehearsal.” We were 
rehearsingOthello and I went through a fair few sweaty T-shirts and a couple 
got ripped in the enthusiasm of it… Nothing violent or untoward, just, you 
know, it happens. To get a replacement made me laugh.

Part of a theatrical dynasty, Dublin-born Niamh Cusack, 57, is the daughter of 
actors Cyril Cusack and Maureen Kiely and the sister of actors Sinéad, Sorcha 
and Catherine. In a career spanning more than 30 years, she has worked 
extensively at the RSC and the National, including playing Desdemona inOthello 
opposite Ben Kingsley and in the National’s award-winning production ofThe 
Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/03/curious-incident-dog-review>. 
She is married to fellow actor Finbar Lynch and stars inGhosts 
<http://homemcr.org/production/ghosts/> at Home, Manchester, until 3 December. 

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I always cycle in to work. It’s a wonderful transition from my real life to my 
life in the theatre. I really treasure it. Then I do a voice warm-up. For the 
past 10 years I’ve also knitted in the wings because it calms me down. I like 
to get down there in plenty of time, sit with my knitting, listen to the 
audience and have a little think about the play. My knitting is crap by the 
way, all I do is squares. If my teacher from school could see me now, she’d be 
laughing.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
My dressing table starts off pristine and very quickly looks like a bomb site. 
For me the dressing room is a bit like a monk’s cell – I’m not trying to make 
it beautiful, it’s a very simple place. I always have a tiny little photograph 
taken in a photo booth of my husband and my son which is about 15 years old now 
so they look different, but I love it. And I always have a book of poetry 
because I find poetry very inspirational and somehow you always find something 
that pertains to the play. My husband gave me Carol Ann Duffy’s complete works, 
which I’ve brought up with me forGhosts.

What do you love most about being on stage?
I love the fact that it’s live and changes every night.

And anything you dislike about it?
Mobile phones going off. And people in the front row who don’t want to be 
there, people who are wriggling and squiggling, fidgety and not engaged.

How do you wind down after a performance?
I really love my cycle home in the dark. That’s really precious. And then a 
glass of wine with my man. It’s very simple.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
About 24 years ago I worked with a director called Karel Reisz who, sadly, is 
now dead. He directed me in a production ofA Doll’s House and, for the press 
night, he gave me a lucky charm, which was a silver doll’s house. On the back 
was engraved: “To Nora (the character I was playing), from the Bruiser”. Karel 
was probably one of the kindest, most astute and humane people I’ve known but 
when he gave notes he shot from the hip. So we nicknamed him the Bruiser. The 
charm was really precious to me and I wore it inside my costume on every show I 
did. Then sadly I wore it in a play at the Royal Court and it must have fallen 
off. We looked high and low and couldn’t find it because it was a tiny little 
thing.

A Cambridge graduate with a first in English, Simon Russell Beale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/simon-russell-beale>, 55, has described 
acting as “three-dimensional literary criticism”. Born in Penang, Malaysia, the 
son of an army medic, in the 1980s he made his name as a comic actor at the 
Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1990, an RSC production ofTroilus and Cressida 
began Beale’s long creative partnership with director Sam Mendes, who he has 
called his “professional soulmate”. His many accolades include the 2003 Olivier 
theatre award for best actor, for his role inUncle Vanya at the Donmar 
Warehouse. He is currently starring as Prospero in The Tempest at the RSC in 
collaboration with Intel and in association with The Imaginarium Studiosuntil 
21 January.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
I go through the whole part very, very quickly on stage. Hamlet takes an hour, 
Lear took 45 minutes. It gets the whole brain and mouth going. A lot of actors 
have developed their own sort of system, and very often it’s from drama school. 
But I left drama school early, so I never developed one.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
I have the emptiest dressing room in the world but I do often use it as an 
office. If the dressing room is big enough I always have a piano if I can get 
one. I’ll come in early to play for a couple of hours. The piano is for my soul 
really, it just calms me and I love it. And one day I will play those fucking 
Chopin etudes. I am determined!

What do you love most about being on stage?
There’s a type of silence when people are listening which is amazing. When I 
didThe Seagull, Chekhov bizarrely asks for an enormously long period, I think 
it’s about two minutes or something, of silence on stage while my character 
prepares to shoot himself – typical Chekhov. We decided to observe Chekhov’s 
request, so I was basically standing entirely still for over a minute. It was 
extraordinary. The silence becomes somehow thick.

And anything you dislike about it?
Like a lot of British actors I’m not very good at curtain calls. I find them 
both pleasurable and embarrassing, a little bit squirmy.

Do you like to receive guests in your dressing room after a show?
No, because I want a beer! It’s got to be a draught beer in a pub so when 
people come and see me they always say, “Shall we meet in the local pub?” I 
used to drink bitter but when I was doingHamlet I started wanting something 
cold. That first beer after a performance is one of the best drinks ever.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
Most of the things I remember about first nights are cards rather than gifts. 
If you get a lovely note from Nick Hytner or Sam Mendes, that makes you feel 
great. Nick didn’t even direct me inKing Lear [at the National in 2014], but 
his card to me when it opened was beautiful and I’ve kept it. I don’t like 
champagne, never really been interested in it, so people have learned that 
there’s absolutely no point in sending me a bottle. But I do like flowers.

The best present I ever got, though, was from my mother years ago. What’s 
clever about her, and Dad continues this as well, they try and find something 
thematic from the show in the gift. I was doing Katie Mitchell’s brilliant 
production ofGhosts by Ibsen and the last line is: “Mother, give me the sun”, 
before the character sinks into death. Mum sent me – and I’ve still got it on 
the wall in my flat – a gold sun with a face on it. I can’t quite describe it, 
it’s not a picture, it’s 3D, you can stick it on the wall. It’s like those 
ducks people used to put on walls! I remember thinking, “Oh you are clever”. It 
was just so witty, my mother sending me a sun.

Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer 
Born in south-east London, Jade Anouka trained at Guildford School of Acting 
and made her professional debut at the Greenwich theatre in 2003. She has since 
worked extensively at the RSC and the Globe, including playing Ophelia in 
Dominic Dromgoole’s 2011 production ofHamlet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/05/hamlet-review>. In 2014, she 
won a Stage award for acting excellence for her performance in the one-woman 
showChef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/edinburgh-festival-2014-fringe-no-gimmicks-please>
 at the Edinburgh festival and she made her West End debut earlier this year in 
Jamie Lloyd’s production ofDoctor Faustus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/26/doctor-faustus-review-kit-harington-duke-of-yorks-theatre-game-of-thrones>
. She is currently appearing in Phyllida Lloyd’s all-femaleShakespeare trilogy 
<http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/donmar-kings-cross/2016/shakespeare-trilogy#RHQjjfEhLp10sjhU.97>
 at Donmar King’s Cross until 17 December.

What’s your pre-stage ritual?
They change from show to show. And once they’re set, I have to do them for 
every performance, otherwise it feels weird. With the Donmar all-female 
Shakespeares, we’ve had group rituals that we do together. One is – I’m not 
sure I should say this – called “testicles, spectacles, wallet and watch”. It 
started when we didJulius Caesar in 2012. Right before every show, we’d say out 
loud: “Testicles, spectacles, wallet and watch” and do actions for each word. 
Then off we’d go on stage.

My other thing – I guess it’s a comfort thing – is I have to make sure I’ve 
got a bottle of water at each exit. These Shakespeare productions are played in 
the round, so we’ve got four entrances and exits and I have to make sure 
there’s a bottle in each one. Sometimes, I don’t even drink it; I just know 
it’s there.

What do you normally have in your dressing room?
A cafetiere is paramount. I’ve got a cafetiere that makes one cup of coffee. I 
also always need a bed. I’ve never had a dressing room with an actual bed, so I 
have a makeshift one in the corner or under the dressing table. This time 
round, it’s a prop they weren’t going to use in the show – a sleeping bag – so 
I nabbed it. There are 16 of us crammed into one dressing room so it’s quite 
busy but I do always have music on my headphones and I can curl up in my 
sleeping bag and have a little peace and quiet. It’s important to have an area 
of calm, especially when you’ve got two, even three shows in a day. So I have 
my music, my bed and my coffee.

How do you take care of yourself during a production run?
I’m not usually a health freak, but I always find being fit and healthy puts 
you in good stead for the run of a show. Exercise keeps me sane. I did do some 
actual training for the trilogy too. I play Hotspur inHenry IV and we’ve 
imagined him as a boxer, so I went down toMiguel’s gym 
<http://www.miguelsboxinggym.co.uk/> in Brixton and built up my boxing 
technique.

What do you love most about being on stage?
The buzz. It’s probably a mixture of fear and excitement and I find that 
really addictive. When you’re on stage, it’s like everything takes off, it’s 
almost like you’re flying. Plus you get to step into the shoes of people who 
live extraordinary lives – for example, with this show, I get to imagine being 
a boxer or leading an army.

How do you wind down afterwards?
A small glass of red. Or a bourbon. Even if I go straight home after a show I 
can’t sleep, I feel wired, so I’ll always stick on Netflix or iPlayer. If I’m 
feeling the need for something a bit light,The Secret Life of Four Year Olds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/11/secret-life-of-four-year-olds-review>
 always gets me crying with laughter.

Do you like to receive guests in your dressing room?
Totally. For the last show I did, Doctor Faustus, me and Jenna Russell shared 
a dressing room and we had our friends round a lot, popping in to say ‘Hi’. We 
had a little kitchenette, so we could offer people a nice cold glass of bubbly 
or something. I find it all part of the experience. When friends come to the 
theatre they’re having a bit of a night out, it’s a special occasion, and so 
I’ll get a drink in and some nibbles. I like welcoming them. One of my rules is 
work hard, play hard. I don’t let it affect the work, but I do think if you 
work hard, you deserve to throw a few shapes of an evening.

What’s the best first-night gift you’ve received?
One of my best mates gave me a cute little hip flask for my first job out of 
drama school, which was at the RSC. It’s got roses on it and it’s lived on my 
dressing room table ever since. It’s been really great, partly because it’s 
such a reminder of how far I’ve come.
