Fans rook refuge on the field while the incident was addressed by firefighters.

Carlisle continued to post updates on their Twitter account, adding a picture 
of a firefighter in the stand but adding: “Exeter are hopeful of getting the 
game restarted soon.”

After a lengthy delay, which also involved a problem with the floodlights, 
Exeter posted an update, saying: “The players are back in the ground and have 
now returned to the tunnel. City players back out on the field and warming up 
now. All okay here folks!”
