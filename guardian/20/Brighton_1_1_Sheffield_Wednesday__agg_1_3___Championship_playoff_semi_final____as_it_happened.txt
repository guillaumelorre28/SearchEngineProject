Wednesday jump around in delight. The Brighton full back Bruno meanwhile 
crumples to the floor, pressing his bearded face into the turf, sobbing his 
heart out. Stockdale tries to pick him up. It takes a while. Poor Bruno. Poor 
Brighton. They were simply stunning in that first half, a relentless attacking 
force of nature. On another day they’d have scored the goals they needed. But 
the luck wasn’t with them - witness all those injuries, Hooper’s cheeky shove 
on Dunk, Knockaert’s brilliant free kick hitting the inside of the post yet 
staying out - and once again it isn’t to be their year. The Championship can be 
proud of them. They would have graced the Premier League. But take nothing away 
from Wednesday, who were defensively resolute, and in truth the better side for 
the other three halves of football in this two-legged affair. Is their 16-year 
exile from the Premier League about to end? Only Hull City or Derby  can stop 
them a week on Saturday. Nighty night!

Sheffield Wednesday rock Brighton to reach Championship play-off final

FULL TIME: Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday (agg 1-3)

Forestieri nearly breaks clear down the left. Then up the other end, Wilson 
drags a 25-yarder wide right. And that’s it! Wednesday are going to Wembley, 
where they’ll most likely, unless something very strange happens tomorrow 
night, be playing Hull City for a place in the 2016-17 Premier League!

90 min +4: The ball breaks to Wilson on the edge of the box. He slips, but 
Brighton get a second chance as the ball squirts right to Dunk. He’s one on one 
with Westwood! But he batters his shot straight at the keeper, who parries 
easily. A corner results, but nothing comes of it. Brighton’s last chance, slim 
as it was, has gone.
 James Wilson slips as he shoots past Barry Bannan and Glenn Loovens.

90 min +2: A slight melee in the Wednesday box, and the ball falls at the feet 
of Knockaert, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. But he nearly takes 
a complete air shot, and feathers the ball out of play for a goal kick.

90 min: LuaLua cuts in from the left and sends a low, lame shot wide left of 
the post. Westwood guides it wide. A feeling that this is all over. But this is 
not quite all over! There will be six added minutes. Six! East wasn’t joking 
when he pointed at his imaginary watch while Wallace waddled off.

89 min: Skalak, down the right now, loops long, forcing Lees into the 
concession of a corner. But the resulting set piece sees Bruno give away a 
cheap free kick in the midst of all the bustle, and the pressure, such as it 
was, is released. The away fans are in full party mode now. It’s like 
Leicester-on-Sea.

88 min: Knockaert, down the left, finds Dunk on the penalty spot with a low 
cross. But the big emergency striker can’t sort his feet out. Bannan scampers 
off with the ball.

87 min: “Hull City, we’re coming for you!” trill the travelling Wednesdayites. 
Fair to say they don’t have much faith in Derby County, then. Or, indeed, 
Brighton, whose race seems run. Nuhiu has a shot from 20 yards, but it’s not 
very good. The clock, however, ticks on.

85 min: Skalak makes ground down the left and fires low into the Wednesday 
area. Wilson tries to manufacture a shot on the turn, sending the ball sailing 
high and wide left. At the restart, Nuhiu barges into the back of Kayal, a 
clumsy nonsense that earns a yellow card. Is everyone on a yellow now?

83 min: Brighton are beginning to lose their discipline, and their heads. 
Forestieri is brought down on the left by Rosenior. A chance to roll around the 
turf awhile, as seconds slip away.

80 min: Nuhiu and Lee work down the right to earn Wednesday’s first corner of 
the match. Stockdale punches the set piece clear. Kayal tries to find Knockaert 
with a Hollywood pass on the counter, but it sails harmlessly through to 
Westwood.

79 min: Brighton still have all the ball, but Wednesday look super-organised. 
The away fans are making the most noise now. Time is not the hosts’ friend.

76 min: Wednesday batter it long. Nuhiu rises high and sends the ball wide 
right for Lee, who returns it to the far post. Nuhiu has peeled off and meets 
the cross, but heads over harmlessly. For a second, though, Brighton were 
exposed.

74 min: Nuhiu embarks on a very strange dribble from the Wednesday right back 
towards his own box. Skalak nips the ball off him, and Loovens is forced to 
concede the foul before the chance of a shot opens up. A free kick, 30 yards 
out, just to the left of goal. After interminable faffing, LuaLua blooters a 
daft effort straight into the wall. What a waste.

70 min: It’s attack versus defence, Wednesday sitting deep. Brighton have all 
the possession, but the visitors are holding their shape well. They’re not 
giving up any chances.

68 min: Skalak dances down the left, grooving himself into a bit of space. He 
chips a cross to the far post, but there’s nobody in blue and white over there. 
Pudil clears. Brighton are beginning to play with hectic desperation. They’re 
not quite as smooth in attack as they were in that first half. Then again, that 
first half was exceptional, even if all their efforts got them nowhere.

66 min: Wallace felt his hamstring after taking that shot, and now he plonks 
himself down on the turf. Tick, tock, tick, tock, there goes time! LuaLua 
charges up and leans over him in a very threatening manner. For a second it 
looked as though the Brighton man was intending to hoof his opponent’s nut 
clean off his shoulders. The referee reminds everyone how old they are, and we 
carry on. Or, more accurately, the game carries on: Wallace limps off, to be 
replaced by Jeremy Helan.

making one. The nerves, the desperation, the panic, it’s palpable.

59 min: Hunt is booked for time wasting at a throw. Carlos Carvalhal, on the 
touchline, wasn’t particularly happy at the two Kayal incidents; he’s 
positively livid now.

58 min: Kayal is very, very lucky not to be walking. He slides in on Wallace, 
two feet up, not in total control. It should at least be a second yellow, but 
referee Roger East opts to perform the palms-to-the-turf calm-down mime 
instead. Lucky Kayal.
 No complaints from Kayal as he is shown the yellow card. Photograph: Gareth

56 min: From the free kick, there’s a game of head tennis in the Wednesday 
box, and then the visitors break upfield through Forestieri. He’s bombing down 
the left at high speed, and is wiped out by the most cynical charge you’ll ever 
see from Kayal. A yellow card. For a second, the Amex fell silent anticipating 
red. But it was on the halfway line, and there was a covering man in the 
middle. Still.

55 min: Hutchinson shoves Kayal in the back. A free kick, and he’s booked for 
arguing the toss. He’s then got to be pulled away from Kayal, as the pair lock 
horns. What a preposterous performance.

53 min: Wednesday are beginning to get a foothold in this game. It’s about 
time. A quiet period for Brighton. The crowd do their best to raise their 
heroes. It’s some atmosphere at the Amex. The play-offs are magnificent

51 min: Brighton press hard, but Kayal and Knockaert combine to lose the ball 
and Wednesday break. Bannan’s given much too much time down the inside-left 
channel, and he sends a bouncing bomb towards the bottom right from the edge of 
the box. Stockdale spills the ball, and it breaks wide right to Wallace, who 
looks for Forestieri in the middle. Fortunately for Brighton, and especially 
Stockdale, Bong -New Fast Automatic Daffodils earworm alert!

danger.

49 min: Kayal latches onto a loose Bannan clearance and drives down the 
middle. He then slips the ball just to his left for Wilson, who hits low 
towards the bottom right. Westwood’s claiming that one all day. But Brighton 
look just that little bit sharper, again.

48 min: ... the ball’s hit long for Sidwell, who returns it back left for 
Skalak. He shoots towards the bottom left. Westwood parries. Wilson has another 
go, from a tighter angle. The keeper gathers. Brighton obviously aren’t in the 
mood to spend the summer wondering.

And we're off again!

The visitors get the ball rolling once more. They’ve hooked Lopez and sent on 
Sam Hutchinson, a defensive move. What they have, they’re looking to hold. 
Incidentally, away goals don’t count double. Two more goals for Brighton, and 
we’ll be heading to extra time.

HALF TIME: Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday (agg 1-3)

And that - phew - is that for the first half! A brilliantly entertaining match 
so far. Brightonshould be leading. Wednesday could be leading. A sense that 
anything could happen yet. Don’t go away! No flipping!

45 min +4: Wednesday then breeze up the other end, Forestieri curling a ball 
into the box for Hooper, who heads it straight at Stockdale when it was surely 
easier to score! The keeper is able to claw it away, rather well in fairness.

45 min +3: Wilson burns down the right and earns a corner off the back of a 
sliding Pudil. Knockaert takes long, forcing Hunt to concede a corner on the 
other side. And from that one, there’s an astonishing scramble in the Wednesday 
box, Dunk failing to connect properly with a header from six yards, then Lee 
clearing a Greer prod off the line!

43 min: Brighton’s energy levels have fallen a little, no surprise given the 
time/effort/reward ratios. Wednesday are more than happy with the resulting 
lull in proceedings. “A wise man once told me that the only way to ensure that 
the bread falls jam side up every time, is to drop the bread on the floor 
first, and then put the jam on,” writes Simon McMahon. “I think he was saying 
‘you make your own luck’. Or maybe he just liked bread and jam.”

39 min: Brighton knock it around the middle awhile, before Kayal tries to 
press down the right. He’s upended by Lopez, who very nearly talks himself into 
the book. A free kick, and a chance for Brighton to load the box.

Wednesday jump around in delight. The Brighton full back Bruno meanwhile 
crumples to the floor, pressing his bearded face into the turf, sobbing his 
heart out. Stockdale tries to pick him up. It takes a while. Poor Bruno. Poor 
Brighton. They were simply stunning in that first half, a relentless attacking 
force of nature. On another day they’d have scored the goals they needed. But 
the luck wasn’t with them - witness all those injuries, Hooper’s cheeky shove 
on Dunk, Knockaert’s brilliant free kick hitting the inside of the post yet 
staying out - and once again it isn’t to be their year. The Championship can be 
proud of them. They would have graced the Premier League. But take nothing away 
from Wednesday, who were defensively resolute, and in truth the better side for 
the other three halves of football in this two-legged affair. Is their 16-year 
exile from the Premier League about to end? Only Hull City or Derby  can stop 
them a week on Saturday. Nighty night!

Forestieri nearly breaks clear down the left. Then up the other end, Wilson 
drags a 25-yarder wide right. And that’s it! Wednesday are going to Wembley, 
where they’ll most likely, unless something very strange happens tomorrow 
night, be playing Hull City for a place in the 2016-17 Premier League!
 
90 min +4: The ball breaks to Wilson on the edge of the box. He slips, but 
Brighton get a second chance as the ball squirts right to Dunk. He’s one on one 
with Westwood! But he batters his shot straight at the keeper, who parries 
easily. A corner results, but nothing comes of it. Brighton’s last chance, slim 
as it was, has gone.

90 min +3: Forestieri chases after a long lump down the middle. Stockdale 
comes out of his area and beats him to the ball. Just. But just is enough.
 
90 min +2: A slight melee in the Wednesday box, and the ball falls at the feet 
of Knockaert, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. But he nearly takes 
a complete air shot, and feathers the ball out of play for a goal kick.
 
90 min: LuaLua cuts in from the left and sends a low, lame shot wide left of 
the post. Westwood guides it wide. A feeling that this is all over. But this is 
not quite all over! There will be six added minutes. Six! East wasn’t joking 
when he pointed at his imaginary watch while Wallace waddled off.
 
89 min: Skalak, down the right now, loops long, forcing Lees into the 
concession of a corner. But the resulting set piece sees Bruno give away a 
cheap free kick in the midst of all the bustle, and the pressure, such as it 
was, is released. The away fans are in full party mode now. It’s like 
Leicester-on-Sea.

88 min: Knockaert, down the left, finds Dunk on the penalty spot with a low 
cross. But the big emergency striker can’t sort his feet out. Bannan scampers 
off with the ball.
 
87 min: “Hull City, we’re coming for you!” trill the travelling Wednesdayites. 
Fair to say they don’t have much faith in Derby County, then. Or, indeed, 
Brighton, whose race seems run. Nuhiu has a shot from 20 yards, but it’s not 
very good. The clock, however, ticks on.
 
85 min: Skalak makes ground down the left and fires low into the Wednesday 
area. Wilson tries to manufacture a shot on the turn, sending the ball sailing 
high and wide left. At the restart, Nuhiu barges into the back of Kayal, a 
clumsy nonsense that earns a yellow card. Is everyone on a yellow now?
 
83 min: Brighton are beginning to lose their discipline, and their heads. 
Forestieri is brought down on the left by Rosenior. A chance to roll around the 
turf awhile, as seconds slip away.
 
82 min: Helan powers down the left wing, cuts inside, and is brought down by 
Bruno, who hooks his arm around the Wednesday player’s neck. A booking for a 
cynical foul.

81 min: LuaLua purchases a fairly cheap free kick off Lee down the left. 
Another chance to load the box. Skalak takes. Lees eyebrows the high ball out 
for a corner on the right. Loovens then batters the corner clear with a 
magnificent clearing header.

80 min: Nuhiu and Lee work down the right to earn Wednesday’s first corner of 
the match. Stockdale punches the set piece clear. Kayal tries to find Knockaert 
with a Hollywood pass on the counter, but it sails harmlessly through to 
Westwood.

79 min: Brighton still have all the ball, but Wednesday look super-organised. 
The away fans are making the most noise now. Time is not the hosts’ friend.
 
77 min: Liam Rosenior comes on for Greer.
 
76 min: Wednesday batter it long. Nuhiu rises high and sends the ball wide 
right for Lee, who returns it to the far post. Nuhiu has peeled off and meets 
the cross, but heads over harmlessly. For a second, though, Brighton were 
exposed.
 
74 min: Nuhiu embarks on a very strange dribble from the Wednesday right back 
towards his own box. Skalak nips the ball off him, and Loovens is forced to 
concede the foul before the chance of a shot opens up. A free kick, 30 yards 
out, just to the left of goal. After interminable faffing, LuaLua blooters a 
daft effort straight into the wall. What a waste.
 
71 min: Hooper is replaced by Adthe Nuhiu. He takes an age to get off. Referee 
East does the ostentatious watch-tapping mime in the Wednesday bench’s 
direction. Expect some added-time drama!
 
70 min: It’s attack versus defence, Wednesday sitting deep. Brighton have all 
the possession, but the visitors are holding their shape well. They’re not 
giving up any chances.
 
68 min: Skalak dances down the left, grooving himself into a bit of space. He 
chips a cross to the far post, but there’s nobody in blue and white over there. 
Pudil clears. Brighton are beginning to play with hectic desperation. They’re 
not quite as smooth in attack as they were in that first half. Then again, that 
first half was exceptional, even if all their efforts got them nowhere.
 
66 min: Wallace felt his hamstring after taking that shot, and now he plonks 
himself down on the turf. Tick, tock, tick, tock, there goes time! LuaLua 
charges up and leans over him in a very threatening manner. For a second it 
looked as though the Brighton man was intending to hoof his opponent’s nut 
clean off his shoulders. The referee reminds everyone how old they are, and we 
carry on. Or, more accurately, the game carries on: Wallace limps off, to be 
replaced by Jeremy Helan.
 
64 min: Wallace takes a blast from the best part of 35 yards. The ball 
balloons into the air and falls harmlessly back to earth by Stockdale.
 
63 min: Knockaert is booked for chasing after Forestieri and hacking him down 
from behind. He can’t have any complaints, and in fairness doesn’t bother 
making one. The nerves, the desperation, the panic, it’s palpable.
 
62 min: Baldock, who has been quiet, verging on ineffectual, is replaced by 
Kazenga LuaLua.
 
61 min: A free kick for Brighton out on the left, the freshly booked Hunt 
having clattered into Skalak. The hosts load the box. Skalak then idiotically 
blooters the set piece high over the bar. Three rugby points, but those are no 
good!
 
59 min: Hunt is booked for time wasting at a throw. Carlos Carvalhal, on the 
touchline, wasn’t particularly happy at the two Kayal incidents; he’s 
positively livid now.
 
58 min: Kayal is very, very lucky not to be walking. He slides in on Wallace, 
two feet up, not in total control. It should at least be a second yellow, but 
referee Roger East opts to perform the palms-to-the-turf calm-down mime 
instead. Lucky Kayal.

Fuller/PA  
56 min: From the free kick, there’s a game of head tennis in the Wednesday 
box, and then the visitors break upfield through Forestieri. He’s bombing down 
the left at high speed, and is wiped out by the most cynical charge you’ll ever 
see from Kayal. A yellow card. For a second, the Amex fell silent anticipating 
red. But it was on the halfway line, and there was a covering man in the 
middle. Still.

55 min: Hutchinson shoves Kayal in the back. A free kick, and he’s booked for 
arguing the toss. He’s then got to be pulled away from Kayal, as the pair lock 
horns. What a preposterous performance.
 
53 min: Wednesday are beginning to get a foothold in this game. It’s about 
time. A quiet period for Brighton. The crowd do their best to raise their 
heroes. It’s some atmosphere at the Amex. The play-offs are magnificent 
entertainment. Cruel, but magnificent.
 
51 min: Brighton press hard, but Kayal and Knockaert combine to lose the ball 
and Wednesday break. Bannan’s given much too much time down the inside-left 
channel, and he sends a bouncing bomb towards the bottom right from the edge of 
the box. Stockdale spills the ball, and it breaks wide right to Wallace, who 
looks for Forestieri in the middle. Fortunately for Brighton, and especially 
Stockdale, Bong -New Fast Automatic Daffodils earworm alert! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YP0a-u_Gek> - is on hand to snuff out the 
danger.
 
49 min: Kayal latches onto a loose Bannan clearance and drives down the 
middle. He then slips the ball just to his left for Wilson, who hits low 
towards the bottom right. Westwood’s claiming that one all day. But Brighton 
look just that little bit sharper, again.
 
48 min: ... the ball’s hit long for Sidwell, who returns it back left for 
Skalak. He shoots towards the bottom left. Westwood parries. Wilson has another 
go, from a tighter angle. The keeper gathers. Brighton obviously aren’t in the 
mood to spend the summer wondering.
 
47 min: Bong and Skalak combine down the left to earn a corner. From which...
 
The visitors get the ball rolling once more. They’ve hooked Lopez and sent on 
Sam Hutchinson, a defensive move. What they have, they’re looking to hold. 
Incidentally, away goals don’t count double. Two more goals for Brighton, and 
we’ll be heading to extra time.
 
Half-time entertainment: Here’s Brighton taking their British Caledonian 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA5E1fPvWQY> helicopter to the 1983 FA Cup 
final, soundtracked by their cup final song. ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♭ ♮ ♯ “Football’s our game 
/ Brighton’s our name!” ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬
 
And that - phew - is that for the first half! A brilliantly entertaining match 
so far. Brightonshould be leading. Wednesday could be leading. A sense that 
anything could happen yet. Don’t go away! No flipping!
 
45 min +4: Wednesday then breeze up the other end, Forestieri curling a ball 
into the box for Hooper, who heads it straight at Stockdale when it was surely 
easier to score! The keeper is able to claw it away, rather well in fairness.
 
45 min +3: Wilson burns down the right and earns a corner off the back of a 
sliding Pudil. Knockaert takes long, forcing Hunt to concede a corner on the 
other side. And from that one, there’s an astonishing scramble in the Wednesday 
box, Dunk failing to connect properly with a header from six yards, then Lee 
clearing a Greer prod off the line!

45 min +1: Sidwell eases down the right and floats a cross into the box. Dunk 
rises on the penalty spot and aims for the top left, but his header sails high 
over the bar.
 
45 min: There will be four added minutes in this half. A suggestion from the 
referee and his assistants that Wednesday have been rather guilty of 
time-wasting.
 
43 min: Brighton’s energy levels have fallen a little, no surprise given the 
time/effort/reward ratios. Wednesday are more than happy with the resulting 
lull in proceedings. “A wise man once told me that the only way to ensure that 
the bread falls jam side up every time, is to drop the bread on the floor 
first, and then put the jam on,” writes Simon McMahon. “I think he was saying 
‘you make your own luck’. Or maybe he just liked bread and jam.”
 
41 min: Knockaert hits the free kick deep, panicking Hunt into heading behind 
for a corner on the left. The corner’s hit long, and Bruno tries to squeeze a 
header home from a tight angle to the right of the goal. It’s catching practice 
for Westwood.
 
39 min: Brighton knock it around the middle awhile, before Kayal tries to 
press down the right. He’s upended by Lopez, who very nearly talks himself into 
the book. A free kick, and a chance for Brighton to load the box.
 
36 min: Boom! Skalak! The nearest the MBM has ever got to a Sly and the Family 
Stone reference, and a fine free kick which whistles inches over the bar. That 
very nearly found the top left. Westwood wasn’t getting to that.

35 min: Wilson attempts a Cruyff Turn down the inside-left channel, and is 
cleaned out by Lee. A free kick, 25 yards out, just to the left of the goal.
