Newcastle United's French revolution is gathering pace. Not content with 
signing the midfielder Yohan Cabaye from Lille and the winger Sylvain Marveaux 
from Rennes this month, as well as the French-born Senegal striker Demba Ba, 
formerly of West Ham, Alan Pardew has his sights set on at least two more 
France-based players.

The agent Pierre Frelot has confirmed that Newcastle are interested in two of 
his clients, the St-Etienne and France midfielder Blaise Matuidi and PSG's 
Turkish striker Mevlut Erding, and that both men are receptive to hearing what 
Pardew has to say.

Meanwhile Newcastle's manager appears ready to listen to offers for the 
Argentinian winger Jonás Gutiérrez but has made it clear he hopes to keep 
Gutiérrez's central-defensive compatriot Fabricio Coloccini.

Joey Barton has once again used his Twitter account to reiterate a desire to 
remain at St James' Park before departing on a free transfer when his contract 
runs out in May but José Enrique, Newcastle's left-back, is still expected to 
leave.
