This effervescent south Indian sundowner uses masala chai, a spice-flavoured 
tea you can buy in most supermarkets. Serves one.

4 fresh basil leaves
60ml whisky (we use Chivas Regal <http://www.chivas.com/en/gb/>)
50ml masala tea, chilled
50ml grapefruit syrup (made 1:1 sugar with grapefruit juice)
10ml fresh lime juice
Prosecco to finish
1 sprig fresh basil and 1 slice grapefruit, to garnish

Muddle (ie, bash) the basil in a cocktail shaker, add the whisky, tea, syrup 
and lime, and shake over ice. Strain into a chilled wine glass over ice, top 
with prosecco, and garnish.
