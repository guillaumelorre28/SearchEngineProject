Full-time: Man Utd 4-1 Fenerbahce

A dire 30 minutes was followed by three goals in 15 minutes, including two 
confidence-boosters for Paul Pogba. Juan Mata and Michael Carrick impressed and 
Wayne Rooney was bright and inventive in attack too. Things are looking up 
before Chelsea visit Old Trafford. Thanks for keeping me company. The match 
report is here.

90+1 min: Rooney nods the ball to Martial and is sent scurrying back into the 
box by the young forward. But he can’t get the ball out of his feet and 
Fenerbahce clear. “Happiness by Ken Dodd isn’t bad either,” offers Simon 
McMahon, neatly wrapping this MBM up.

87 min: “Happiness is a seriously uncomfortable film to watch, though a good 
one nonetheless,” writes David Wall. “I think I’d dispute the description of is 
as a comedy though, even a dark one. That is, unless you mean it in the 
Dante-esque sense.” Maybe I’m just seriously warped, David. Mata goes close to 
scoring United’s fifth with a right-footed snap-shot from 15 yards. Rooney was 
involved again. He’s been involved in most of the good things that United have 
done tonight.

85 min: Emenike has given Fenerbahce the injection of pace they sorely lacked 
in the first half. He connects with Souza, who forces De Gea into a good save. 
Emenike has been a regular starter in the league. Advocaat got his first XI 
wrong for this one.

Goal! Man Utd 4-1 Fenerbahce (Van Persie 83)

Topal stops Rooney in his tracks with a brilliantly timed tackle. He lofts a 
pitching-wedge-style ball forwards to Emenike, who burst away from Bailly, cuts 
back onto his right foot and drills a pass into Van Persie, who sidefoots home 
from six yards. The whole ground stands to applaud and then Van Persie’s name 
rings around the ground. A lovely moment – and one United fans could afford to 
applaud having scored four goals.

79 min: Memphis does a lovely two-step shuffle on the left, making mince meat 
of Sener before darting towards the touchline and trying to squeeze a shot in 
at goal from a ridiculous angle when he’d have been better off pulling it back. 
Still, a bright moment from the substitute.

76 min: “Happiness by Todd Solondz came out one year before American Beauty. 
It basically tells the same story but it’s more extreme. It’s also pretty 
hipster to prefer the former before the latter,” offers Axel Shut. Happiness is 
as dark a dark comedy as I’ve ever seen Todd. It’s making me feel weird just 
thinking about it. United are letting Fenerbahce play the ball around a bit. 
Oh, but hang on, United steal it, Carrick slides a ball forwards to Memphis, 
who shows good feet on this occasion to swivel and play in Mata, whose first 
touch drags the ball on to his right foot quite brilliantly, only to then 
side-foot the ball at Demirel, who still saves well, mind.

73 min: Van Persie has just emerged from a tackle half undressed. I think it 
was Rojo who did the undressing. Meanwhile Fosu-Mensah is on for Pogba, who has 
had a much more enjoyable evening than he did at Anfield, scoring two goals and 
playing a big part in Lingard’s. So expect him to have much more lead in his 
pencil going into the Chelsea match.

71 min: Rooney and Mata combine well in attack. They’ve had a lovely little 
understanding since that dire first 30 minutes. The ball comes to Memphis and 
the ball ends up with Fenerbahce. He rushed that. Too anxious to prove himself.

67 min: “American Beauty is a very good film in a very narrow genre: the 
Hollywood arty, Oscar bait movie,” offers Brian Russell. “It’s got a 
conventional structure, has an ending where everyone learns something, and is 
conventionally well-acted by leading Hollywood actors.It is quite gripping, 
well executed and very watchable but doesn’t stray outside the lines or take 
any risks.” So, if it were a footballer it would be a Michael Ballack type 
figure then?

64 min: File this under American Beauty miscellany: “As the game seems to be 
putting itself to bed, can I just add this factoid about ‘American Beauty’? 
After paying off his manager and agent, you know what Sam Mendes’ director’s 
fee was?” asks Russell Richardson. No, go on tell us. “A princely $30,000 (for 
about 18 months’ work). How long would it take Zlatan (today) to earn that?” He 
just has. Oh, and again.

63 min: Manchester Utd break after that second corner and Rooney races – yes 
races – through the middle of the park before slipping in Mata on his right. 
The Spaniard looks up and spies Lingard in the box but plays it just a tad 
behind him. A crisp break though.

62 min: Emenike is fouled on the right. Van Persie delivers another lovely 
ball into the six-yard box but Shaw heads clear for a corner. Emenike has 
brightened things up in Fenerbahce’s attack. the corner is poor, mind. A second 
is even worse.

60 min: A little cameo from Van Persie. Emenike brings a long ball out of the 
sky with a delightful touch and flicks it on to Van Persie beside him. The 
Dutchman lines his shot up and whips a left-footer towards De Gea’s top-right 
corner, but it’s a few inches wide. He’s got beautiful technique when he 
strikes the ball.

58 min: Now I know that Fenerbahce have hardly been resistant opponents 
tonight but Rooney’s link-up play has been very good. He appears to be better 
with his back to goal than when he’s facing it. His vision looking for 
onrushing team-mates has been exemplary.

55 min: Dundalk are beating Zenit 1-0. If they win that they go top of the 
group. That would be a quite remarkable achievement. the ball almost squirts 
free to Martial, who is running into the box to connect with it after some far 
from composed defending by Fenerbahce but Sener just pokes a toe out of it and 
clears the danger.

53 min: Shaw is fouled by Alper Potuk but it isn’t given. So Shaw kicks him 
back and concedes a free-kick himself. Van Persie whips an inswinger into the 
box. It’s a great delivery aimed at Skrtel, whose every touch is being booed 
now, but United defend it well. They’re a tall, physical team these days.

51 min: “American Beauty was in no way overrated. Yes, some of the dialogue is 
faintly ridiculous: ‘so much beauty...’ etc. etc; but as a tale of repression, 
depression and mid-life crisis it is insightful, powerfully-acted and 
frequently hilarious,” writes Matt Loten, in the absence of anything happening 
at Old Trafford. “Annette Bening’s intense but fragile Carolyn is only just 
bettered by Kevin Spacey at the end of a 90s masterclass in acting which took 
in Seven, The Usual Suspectsand LA Confidential. I can still recite most of his 
opening monologue off by heart.” Oh please do. No, actually don’t. But thanks 
for the email.

49 min: Well, this game can slow right down again now. It’s dead. United have 
killed it with that bright and breezy goal. Vokan Sen drives a ball across 
goal. It’s a very good ball after a nippy run to the right touchline, but no 
one takes a gamble to get in a position to prod it home.

Goal! Man Utd 4-0 Fenerbahce (Lingard 47)

Wow! Pogba picks a loose ball up in midfield and shows good strength to hold 
off his marker before zipping a little pass into the feet of Rooney. He plays a 
first-time ball to Lingard, who knocks the ball out of his feet and crashes a 
shot into the left corner of the goal from 25 yards. A fine goal and a 
wonderful finish.

“What on Earth was that celebration by Pogba/Lingard? What would they do in a 
big game! Bring out a parade or cheerleaders???” asks Nick Parmenter. In case 
you didn’t see it, it was reminiscent of PJ and Duncan’s Let’s Get Ready To 
Rumble dance. Do they practise that stuff? And where do they practise that 
stuff?

Half-time: Man Utd 3-0 Fenerbahce

Well, 30 minutes in I’d have eaten my right hand if you’d told me the first 
half would end 3-0 to Man Utd. From ponderous and predictable two wonderful 
passes led to two penalties. The third goal, albeit coming from a mistake, came 
about thanks to the kind of hungry and incisive play that was sorely missing at 
the start. José may even afford himself a smile.

Goal! Man Utd 3-0 Fenerbahce (Pogba 45)

Kjaer gives the ball away under no pressure as he tries to play the ball out 
to the full-back position. Rooney pounces on it like a hungry dog and fizzes a 
pass into the box, where Lingard takes a feather-toed left-footed touch before 
laying the ball back to Pogba, whose eyes light up as he curls a delicious 
right-footed shot into the top-left corner. A brilliant goal and a ruthless 
punishing of a poor mistake. Lingard’s touch was quite brilliant.

44 min: “I thought American Beauty was terrible,” writes JR in Illinois. “At 
least the half hour or so I saw before turning it off. Of course it was nowhere 
near as bad as The Bonfire of the Vanities which is possibly the worst film 
ever.” Meanwhile, Pogba fouls Alper Potuk, who dusts himself off and prepares 
to whip the ball in from a dangerous position on the left. He plays it in deep 
but Smalling jumps highest and clears under pressure. That was a good ball in.

43 min: Mata’s been so much better than anyone else out there tonight. He 
curls a delicious cross in towards Smalling, who stays up after a United 
corner, but Skrtel leaps above him and does enough to prevent him getting a 
clean head on the ball. Fenerbahce clear and United gain possession again.

41 min: United sit back and allow Fenerbahce to enjoy a bit of possession. 
They work the ball down the right and win another corner. This time they play 
it short, but no beef. Sen’s resulting cross is easily cleared by Bailly.

39 min: Fenerbahce win a corner on the right. It’s whipped into a squabble of 
blue, yellow and red and yet it’s the green of De Gea who rises above them to 
pluck the ball out of the air. What a keeper he is.

37 min: United’s two goals came about thanks to two positive passes forwards. 
There haven’t been enough of those from United tonight. Mata’s for Martial was 
hit with his left foot on the turn. A really delightful and thoroughly 
brilliant pass. Nothing like the 30 minutes of football that preceded it.

34 min: David de Gea (who else?) prevents Souza from getting a goal back for 
Fenerbahce. It followed a rare misjudgement by Carrick. The corner that follows 
is plucked from the air by De Gea.

A dire 30 minutes was followed by three goals in 15 minutes, including two 
confidence-boosters for Paul Pogba. Juan Mata and Michael Carrick impressed and 
Wayne Rooney was bright and inventive in attack too. Things are looking up 
before Chelsea visit Old Trafford. Thanks for keeping me company. The match 
report is here.

 And I’ll leave you with Kevin Spacey being weird.

90+1 min: Rooney nods the ball to Martial and is sent scurrying back into the 
box by the young forward. But he can’t get the ball out of his feet and 
Fenerbahce clear. “Happiness by Ken Dodd isn’t bad either,” offers Simon 
McMahon, neatly wrapping this MBM up.
 
90 min: Fosu-Mensah sends a low shot skidding into Demirel’s midriff. There 
will be two more minutes of this.
 
87 min: “Happiness is a seriously uncomfortable film to watch, though a good 
one nonetheless,” writes David Wall. “I think I’d dispute the description of is 
as a comedy though, even a dark one. That is, unless you mean it in the 
Dante-esque sense.” Maybe I’m just seriously warped, David. Mata goes close to 
scoring United’s fifth with a right-footed snap-shot from 15 yards. Rooney was 
involved again. He’s been involved in most of the good things that United have 
done tonight.
 
85 min: Emenike has given Fenerbahce the injection of pace they sorely lacked 
in the first half. He connects with Souza, who forces De Gea into a good save. 
Emenike has been a regular starter in the league. Advocaat got his first XI 
wrong for this one.
 
Topal stops Rooney in his tracks with a brilliantly timed tackle. He lofts a 
pitching-wedge-style ball forwards to Emenike, who burst away from Bailly, cuts 
back onto his right foot and drills a pass into Van Persie, who sidefoots home 
from six yards. The whole ground stands to applaud and then Van Persie’s name 
rings around the ground. A lovely moment – and one United fans could afford to 
applaud having scored four goals.

Trafford. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters  
81 min: Emenike whacks a cross into Rojo’s hand in the penalty box. Emenike 
wants a penalty. The referee doesn’t give it.
 
79 min: Memphis does a lovely two-step shuffle on the left, making mince meat 
of Sener before darting towards the touchline and trying to squeeze a shot in 
at goal from a ridiculous angle when he’d have been better off pulling it back. 
Still, a bright moment from the substitute.
 
76 min: “Happiness by Todd Solondz came out one year before American Beauty. 
It basically tells the same story but it’s more extreme. It’s also pretty 
hipster to prefer the former before the latter,” offers Axel Shut. Happiness is 
as dark a dark comedy as I’ve ever seen Todd. It’s making me feel weird just 
thinking about it. United are letting Fenerbahce play the ball around a bit. 
Oh, but hang on, United steal it, Carrick slides a ball forwards to Memphis, 
who shows good feet on this occasion to swivel and play in Mata, whose first 
touch drags the ball on to his right foot quite brilliantly, only to then 
side-foot the ball at Demirel, who still saves well, mind.
 
73 min: Van Persie has just emerged from a tackle half undressed. I think it 
was Rojo who did the undressing. Meanwhile Fosu-Mensah is on for Pogba, who has 
had a much more enjoyable evening than he did at Anfield, scoring two goals and 
playing a big part in Lingard’s. So expect him to have much more lead in his 
pencil going into the Chelsea match.

71 min: Rooney and Mata combine well in attack. They’ve had a lovely little 
understanding since that dire first 30 minutes. The ball comes to Memphis and 
the ball ends up with Fenerbahce. He rushed that. Too anxious to prove himself.
 
69 min: Some red-hot Fenerbahce substitution action for you: Koybasi is on for 
Volkan Sen. Meanwhile, man watches football …

67 min: “American Beauty is a very good film in a very narrow genre: the 
Hollywood arty, Oscar bait movie,” offers Brian Russell. “It’s got a 
conventional structure, has an ending where everyone learns something, and is 
conventionally well-acted by leading Hollywood actors.It is quite gripping, 
well executed and very watchable but doesn’t stray outside the lines or take 
any risks.” So, if it were a footballer it would be a Michael Ballack type 
figure then?
 
65 min: Memphis is on for Lingard. Memphis? Mourinho really is going through 
his squad now. Lingard is given a ovation by the appreciative crowd. He’s had a 
fine game. A lovely assist and a belter of a goal.
 
64 min: File this under American Beauty miscellany: “As the game seems to be 
putting itself to bed, can I just add this factoid about ‘American Beauty’? 
After paying off his manager and agent, you know what Sam Mendes’ director’s 
fee was?” asks Russell Richardson. No, go on tell us. “A princely $30,000 (for 
about 18 months’ work). How long would it take Zlatan (today) to earn that?” He 
just has. Oh, and again.
 
63 min: Manchester Utd break after that second corner and Rooney races – yes 
races – through the middle of the park before slipping in Mata on his right. 
The Spaniard looks up and spies Lingard in the box but plays it just a tad 
behind him. A crisp break though.
 
62 min: Emenike is fouled on the right. Van Persie delivers another lovely 
ball into the six-yard box but Shaw heads clear for a corner. Emenike has 
brightened things up in Fenerbahce’s attack. the corner is poor, mind. A second 
is even worse.
 
60 min: A little cameo from Van Persie. Emenike brings a long ball out of the 
sky with a delightful touch and flicks it on to Van Persie beside him. The 
Dutchman lines his shot up and whips a left-footer towards De Gea’s top-right 
corner, but it’s a few inches wide. He’s got beautiful technique when he 
strikes the ball.
 
58 min: Now I know that Fenerbahce have hardly been resistant opponents 
tonight but Rooney’s link-up play has been very good. He appears to be better 
with his back to goal than when he’s facing it. His vision looking for 
onrushing team-mates has been exemplary.
 
57 min: United are pass, pass, passing Fenerbahce into submission. Surely 
Mourinho will be tempted to rest Pogba or Mata now won’t he?
 
55 min: Dundalk are beating Zenit 1-0. If they win that they go top of the 
group. That would be a quite remarkable achievement. the ball almost squirts 
free to Martial, who is running into the box to connect with it after some far 
from composed defending by Fenerbahce but Sener just pokes a toe out of it and 
clears the danger.
 
53 min: Shaw is fouled by Alper Potuk but it isn’t given. So Shaw kicks him 
back and concedes a free-kick himself. Van Persie whips an inswinger into the 
box. It’s a great delivery aimed at Skrtel, whose every touch is being booed 
now, but United defend it well. They’re a tall, physical team these days.
 
51 min: “American Beauty was in no way overrated. Yes, some of the dialogue is 
faintly ridiculous: ‘so much beauty...’ etc. etc; but as a tale of repression, 
depression and mid-life crisis it is insightful, powerfully-acted and 
frequently hilarious,” writes Matt Loten, in the absence of anything happening 
at Old Trafford. “Annette Bening’s intense but fragile Carolyn is only just 
bettered by Kevin Spacey at the end of a 90s masterclass in acting which took 
in Seven, The Usual Suspectsand LA Confidential. I can still recite most of his 
opening monologue off by heart.” Oh please do. No, actually don’t. But thanks 
for the email.
 
49 min: Well, this game can slow right down again now. It’s dead. United have 
killed it with that bright and breezy goal. Vokan Sen drives a ball across 
goal. It’s a very good ball after a nippy run to the right touchline, but no 
one takes a gamble to get in a position to prod it home.
 
Wow! Pogba picks a loose ball up in midfield and shows good strength to hold 
off his marker before zipping a little pass into the feet of Rooney. He plays a 
first-time ball to Lingard, who knocks the ball out of his feet and crashes a 
shot into the left corner of the goal from 25 yards. A fine goal and a 
wonderful finish.

45 min: Emenike is on for Kjaer, who made that costly error for Fenerbahce 
before the break. And Rojo is on for Smalling.
 
“What on Earth was that celebration by Pogba/Lingard? What would they do in a 
big game! Bring out a parade or cheerleaders???” asks Nick Parmenter. In case 
you didn’t see it, it was reminiscent of PJ and Duncan’s Let’s Get Ready To 
Rumble dance. Do they practise that stuff? And where do they practise that 
stuff?
Juventitrè (@Juventitre) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> To call Am Beauty overrated 
or terrible is to ignore how original/smart it was IN ITS TIME, when things 
were generally quiet.

Well, there’s a view on American Beauty. 
 
Well, 30 minutes in I’d have eaten my right hand if you’d told me the first 
half would end 3-0 to Man Utd. From ponderous and predictable two wonderful 
passes led to two penalties. The third goal, albeit coming from a mistake, came 
about thanks to the kind of hungry and incisive play that was sorely missing at 
the start. José may even afford himself a smile.

Kjaer gives the ball away under no pressure as he tries to play the ball out 
to the full-back position. Rooney pounces on it like a hungry dog and fizzes a 
pass into the box, where Lingard takes a feather-toed left-footed touch before 
laying the ball back to Pogba, whose eyes light up as he curls a delicious 
right-footed shot into the top-left corner. A brilliant goal and a ruthless 
punishing of a poor mistake. Lingard’s touch was quite brilliant.

44 min: “I thought American Beauty was terrible,” writes JR in Illinois. “At 
least the half hour or so I saw before turning it off. Of course it was nowhere 
near as bad as The Bonfire of the Vanities which is possibly the worst film 
ever.” Meanwhile, Pogba fouls Alper Potuk, who dusts himself off and prepares 
to whip the ball in from a dangerous position on the left. He plays it in deep 
but Smalling jumps highest and clears under pressure. That was a good ball in.
 
43 min: Mata’s been so much better than anyone else out there tonight. He 
curls a delicious cross in towards Smalling, who stays up after a United 
corner, but Skrtel leaps above him and does enough to prevent him getting a 
clean head on the ball. Fenerbahce clear and United gain possession again.
 
41 min: United sit back and allow Fenerbahce to enjoy a bit of possession. 
They work the ball down the right and win another corner. This time they play 
it short, but no beef. Sen’s resulting cross is easily cleared by Bailly.
 
39 min: Fenerbahce win a corner on the right. It’s whipped into a squabble of 
blue, yellow and red and yet it’s the green of De Gea who rises above them to 
pluck the ball out of the air. What a keeper he is.
 
37 min: United’s two goals came about thanks to two positive passes forwards. 
There haven’t been enough of those from United tonight. Mata’s for Martial was 
hit with his left foot on the turn. A really delightful and thoroughly 
brilliant pass. Nothing like the 30 minutes of football that preceded it.
 
34 min: David de Gea (who else?) prevents Souza from getting a goal back for 
Fenerbahce. It followed a rare misjudgement by Carrick. The corner that follows 
is plucked from the air by De Gea.
