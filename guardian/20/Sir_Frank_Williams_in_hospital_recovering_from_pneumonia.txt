Sir Frank Williams, team principal and founder of the Williams Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> team, is in hospital recovering 
from pneumonia.

The 74-year-old, who established Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/williams> as a grand prix constructor in the 
1970s, has guided the British team to seven drivers’ titles and nine 
constructors’ championships. He is recognised as the world’s oldest surviving 
tetraplegic following a car crash in 1986.

His daughter Claire Williams, the team’s deputy principal, has missed a number 
of recent races and is not in Mexico this weekend in order to be at her 
father’s side.

“Frank, as you know, was taken ill at the Monza race and he’s been a fixture 
in the paddock for so many decades now it’s strange not to have him with us,” 
said Mike O’Driscoll, the team’s chief executive, on Friday.

“He’s had a tough time in hospital. He’s contracted pneumonia. He is making a 
recovery, a slow and steady recovery. We hope to see him back at Grove very 
soon. We all know how determined he is.

“We expect Claire to be back at a race, she’s wanted to stay close to home, 
close to Frank but in this modern world you are [never] more than a phone call 
away and we stay connected.

“She’s part of everything that happens on a minute-by-minute and day-by-day 
basis. We hope to see her by the end of the year and hopefully that will be Abu 
Dhabi.”

Williams entered their first race in 1977 and enjoyed tremendous success in 
the 1980s and 1990s, winning the drivers’ championship on seven occasions.

The British drivers Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill won their sole titles with 
Williams in 1992 and 1996 respectively.

Williams, who has been in a wheelchair since his car accident in France, was 
knighted in 1999 for his services to motor sport.
