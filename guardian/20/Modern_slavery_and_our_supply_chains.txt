The Scott Trust Ltd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust>, the 
owner of the Guardian, works to minimise the risk of modern slavery and human 
rights violations across the entire operation and its supply chains. Our 
organisation has a history of engaging with human rights issues more broadly, 
which frames this activity.

We have set out details of the steps that we have taken to ensure that slavery 
and human trafficking is not taking place in supply chains or in any part of 
the business in ourModern Slavery Statement 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/07/25/Statement-ModernSlaveryAct.pdf>. This is 
in line with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

The Guardian Sourcing Values 
<http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1442417974511/SourcingValuesPDF3.pdf> provide the 
framework against which an ethical assessment of our suppliers will be 
measured. They were developed in recognition of the fact that we rely on 
suppliers and partners, and we do not always have direct control over our 
impact on the environment and people.
