The Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> defender has 
endured a torrid time with injury since Jürgen Klopp arrived at Anfield, 
rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament on England Under-21 duty just days 
after the new manager took charge and then suffering an achilles problem in 
pre-season.

Gomez, who made an impressive start to his Anfield career under Brendan 
Rodgers and is highly regarded by Klopp, returned to full training last week. 
The 19-year-old is still some way from match fitness, however, and Wagner‚ best 
man at Klopp’s wedding‚ is interested in offering the former Charlton Athletic 
player much-needed game time from January.

Huddersfield have made a fine start to the Championship season but missed the 
chance to draw level on points with Newcastle United on Wednesday when they 
suffered a 3-1 defeat at Preston North End.
