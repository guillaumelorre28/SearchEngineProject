A Cambridge United <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cambridge-united> 
supporter is fighting for his life after being assaulted following his club’s 
match against Southend on Saturday.

Simon Dobbin, a 41-year-old from Mildenhall in Suffolk, was injured in a fight 
two hours after the 0-0 draw at Roots Hall.

Reports have claimed that he was jumped on by a group of up to 15 rival fans 
outside the Railway pub and a brawl ensued, leaving Dobbin with a serious head 
injury.

He was taken to the Royal London Hospital, where he remains on a life support 
machine.

“They said if Simon doesn’t come around soon, he may never wake up,” Dobbin’s 
father-in-law, Jim Faley,told the Bury Free Press

.

“We are all hoping, but in the back of our minds we are not 100% sure. Even if 
he comes out in a wheelchair, at least he will still be with us.

“They just used him like a football. According to some people, if it wasn’t 
for his friend laying on top of him they would have killed him.”

Police used CS gas to break up the fight and arrested two men - a 33-year-old 
fromSouthend <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southend> and 47-year-old 
from Cambridge - at the scene. A 23-year-old man was also arrested by officers 
on suspicion of GBH.

Friends of Dobbin have organised a charity match in his honour, which will 
take place at Mildenhall Town FC on Sunday.

“After the tragic and horrific events earlier in the week this game is to give 
back to Simon and his family some of what was taken by the darker side of the 
beautiful game,”read the Facebook page created for the event.
