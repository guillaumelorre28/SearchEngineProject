Shinji Kagawa starred on his return for Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> in a 3-1 win over 
Freiburg in the Bundesliga in Saturday.

Kagawa, back at Dortmund after an unhappy two-year spell at Manchester United, 
was given a hero’s welcome by fans who remembered his role in helping the club 
to back-to-backBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> titles in 2011 and 
2012. The Japan midfielder had a hand in Adrián Ramos’s opening goal in the 
34th minute, playing through Kevin Großkreutz to cross for the Colombian 
striker at the post. Kagawa then scored on a counterattack in the 41st minute, 
when Henrikh Mkhitaryan let Ramos’ cross through for him to pick his spot with 
a low shot.

Kagawa had to go off in the 64th with cramp, a “good sign” according to the 
Dortmund coach Jürgen Klopp, while the Dortmund midfielder Sebastian Kehl said: 
“Shinji was smiling the whole time, at least until he got the cramp.”

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang secured the result with a chip over the outrushing 
goalkeeper in the 78th minute, just three minutes after coming on as a 
substitute.

Oliver Sorg claimed Freiburg’s consolation in the final minute, by which time 
the home side appeared to have had already turned attention to Tuesday’s visit 
of Arsenal in the Champions League.
