Jay O'Shea scored twice to give Chesterfield a 2-0 victory at Burton Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burton-albion> and seal their promotion 
to League One.

The Irishman's second-half double also puts the Spireites in pole position to 
win the League Two title going into the final weekend. The win saw Paul Cook's 
side leapfrog Scunthorpe and Rochdale –both of whom were promoted on Saturday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2014/apr/26/football-league-blog-barnsley-birminham-torquay>
 – and ensures they will go up as champions if they beat Fleetwood at home on 
Saturday.

Burton are assured of a play-off spot themselves and entertain fellow 
promotion chasers Southend United on the final day.

Torquay were relegated from League Two on Saturday despite winning 3-1 at 
Mansfield Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/league-two-round-up>, their 
third away victory in a row. They will be joined in the Conference by Wycombe 
Wanderers if Northampton Town or Bristol Rovers get a point in their final 
game. Anything less than a win for Wanderers at Torquay will seal their fate 
anyway.
