Prosecutor Lee Harris said Bent, who played for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, Ipswich and Charlton in 
England’s top league, was “wild with rage” as he confronted officers after 
calling police to report intruders in his flat. No intruders were discovered, 
but officers found a small amount of cocaine. The incident occurred on 13 
September last year.

Judge Stephen Climie told Bent on Friday he had lost his good character and 
his self-respect, but praised him for his work with a youth football team.
