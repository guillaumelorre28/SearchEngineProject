 after pictures appeared to show theMK Dons midfielder Samir Carruthers and 
Shrewsbury striker James Collins urinating into a glass

and the latter throwing the contents over a balcony.

Ayling was pictured alongside Carruthers, with his arm around the Dons player 
at one point and while there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part the 
24-year-old issued a statement in which he said he was “devastated” to have 
caused offence.

“I would like to apologise for any embarrassment I have caused my club,” 
Ayling said. “Looking at the pictures in the cold light of day I regret, 
firstly, that I put myself in that situation and secondly that I didn’t remove 
myself from it earlier.

“We were on a sanctioned team day out and I’m devastated it ended up in the 
national media and causing offence.

“I’m grateful for the thorough investigation into this matter made by the 
club, which has cleared my name of any indecent behaviour.

“I’m looking forward to getting back to the important business on Saturday 
against Bolton Wanderers at Ashton Gate and making City fans proud.”

Both Carruthers and Collins, currently on loan at Northampton, issued 
apologies on Wednesday after being disciplined by their clubs over Tuesday’s 
incident.

Carruthers, 22, was fined two weeks’ wages and suspended by MK Dons for a 
period that includes their match on Saturday against Brighton. Collins, 25, was 
also fined two weeks’ wages.

The players’ clubs all launched investigations into the incident on Wednesday 
andBristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> were 
satisfied that although Ayling had been in the group, he had not participated.

The Robins manager, Lee Johnson, said Ayling had been naive, adding: “It was a 
sanctioned day out by me. Cheltenham is a great day out, and it has been before 
in the past for Bristol City teams.

“No City players were involved in bad behaviour on that balcony. They’re 
guilty of a bit of naivety.

“Anywhere you go, anything you do, you’re representing the badge. I think it’s 
a stark reminder to any footballer that it’s so easy for any situation, with 
social media, that it can all blow up.”
