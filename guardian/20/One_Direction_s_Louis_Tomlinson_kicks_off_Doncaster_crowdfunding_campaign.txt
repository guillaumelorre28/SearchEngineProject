A young Doncaster Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/doncaster> FC 
footballer is launching an online crowdfunding campaign to raise £2m to help 
fans secure the club's future.

It probably helps that his other job is being one fifth of One Direction. 
Louis Tomlinson's affinity for Rovers is well known – he's eventurned out for 
the club's reserve team

 – but now he's putting his fame to financial use.

Tomlinson has teamed up with the club's former chairman John Ryan to launch 
the campaign on British website Crowdfunder <http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/trust>
, announcing their plans at an event in London followingearlier reports that 
they had taken over the club

.

The pair have formed the Tomlinson Ryan Trust to pledge a "six-figure sum" to 
the campaign: £500,000, judging by the total displayed on the project's 
Crowdfunder page.

"Louis and John want to take Doncaster Rovers back to the Championship, and 
build a club capable of reaching the Premier League," explains the campaign's 
pitch. "Most importantly, they want to make sure the local community has a club 
to support and enjoy for generations to come."

Specifically, the campaign is aiming to raise enough money to buy a stake of 
up to 5% of the club, while investing in its squad, youth development and 
marketing to build its brand in the UK and beyond.

"For me, this is all about the football, the community and restoring the 
excitement and desire to making Doncaster Rovers the most exciting club to play 
for in Yorkshire," said Tomlinson.

"I grew up in Doncaster and have felt the love for football run through the 
town, it's for that reason that I have a real personal passion to make 
Doncaster Rovers a success story."

Ryan and Tomlinson opted to use Crowdfunder rather than higher-profile 
international sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The site has so far housed 
more than 4,000 projects, raising £2m in the process – so if the Doncaster 
Rovers project hits its target, it would double that total.
