I have a good friend named Tomos Parry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/04/tomos-parry-kitty-fishers-last-meal-supper>
 who is also a chef. Having done stints at institutions including the River 
Cafe, which by popular definition makes you a “proper chef”, Tom’s cooking is 
grounded in an understanding of good technique and familiar ingredients. Yet 
his food is unmistakably his own: incredibly simple, movingly delicious.

We were on holiday together in Mallorca last year and spent a lot of time 
preparing extended lunches: roasting legs of lamb over vine wood and dry fennel 
bush we found in the grounds of the house where we were staying, grilling 
langoustine with the fat from cured pig’s cheeks, picking sea urchins off the 
rocks in our flip-flops and storing them in our straw hats. We’d go back to the 
house and crack open their spiny shells, scoop out the delicate orange flesh 
and wash it down with a beer.

How you add seasoning is as important as knowing what to add

None of those things, though, was the highlight of my week. My favourite was 
the simplest. Tom rummaged in the fridge one lunchtime and came up with 
something based onpetit pois à la française 
<http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/nigella-lawson/petits-pois-a-la-francaise-recipe.html>
. Frozen peas, some salad, a splash of white wine, a dash of milk. It took him 
all of five minutes to make and it was the best thing I’d eaten in ages.

Why was that? Tom had done no planning. He’d used underwhelming ingredients. 
But he was able to improvise because he knew what he was doing with heat and, 
most importantly, with seasoning. He knew how the latter would lift those 
humble components into something greater than the sum of their parts. The meal 
was a good example of how crucial seasoning is – perhaps the common denominator 
in all good cooking.

The two Thai recipes here live or die by good seasoning. The Thais have vastly 
more complex and engaging options when it comes to seasoning than we do in the 
west. We might typically have salts, sugars and vinegars to play with (to my 
mind, pepper is less a seasoning than a spice). But in Thai cuisine, and in my 
kitchen, you see palm sugar (warming sweetness) and caster sugar (more urgent, 
impactive sweetness), fish sauce (clean, salty, umami), fermented shrimp paste 
(heavy, earthy salt and deeper umami), fermented freshwater fish (more about 
this later), a couple of types of citrus and sea salt.

While that may sound excessive, cooking Thai food has taught me that sometimes 
how you add seasoning is as important as knowing what to add. All those salty, 
pungent fishy things give you so many options.

Let’s say you are seasoning a curry that will stay hot for a while: then gapi 
(fermented shrimp paste) may be the best option, as it doesn’t intensify in hot 
liquid in quite the same way as fish sauce. However, if a freshly made, tart 
dipping sauce needs zip, then the clean immediacy of fish sauce might be 
perfect. Both add saltiness, but in very different ways.

Gaeng omm is a simple curry soup. It’s principally herbal and pungent, the 
kind of reassuring farmer’s food you are likely to find in more rural areas of 
Isaan, the mountainous north-eastern region of Thailand that borders Laos and 
Cambodia. I have found that it benefits from being seasoned at the last moment, 
so that the curry doesn’t absorb all the liveliness of the citrus flavours and 
the fish sauce. Season it too early and you have a salty bowl of deadened pork 
and lemongrass. But take it off the heat and add a light dash of fish sauce and 
a spritz of fresh lemon or lime and you’ll find these seasonings lift the 
herbal notes beyond what you expected. Gaeng omm is served with jasmine rice, 
the neutral nuttiness of which counterbalances the curry’s seasoning.

On occasion, a specific type of seasoning works perfectly with the ingredients 
in the dish. Just as braised lettuce and peas work best simmered with a little 
sea salt (table or rock salt wouldn’t do), my example would be mushroom salad 
withpla raa, fermented freshwater fish made with roasted rice, which helps to 
define the pungent, spicy, citric food of Isaan.

I miss the extra information we sacrifice with refining, and I am prepared to 
ingest a little stink and rot to get it

Charred, umami-rich mushrooms combined with pla raa and fish sauce, then 
balanced with roasted chilli and citrus, is quite a devious combination. You 
can get pla raa from specialist Asian retailers such asimportfood.com 
<http://importfood.com>, although we source a milder version for use in this 
salad. When travelling, I have eaten versions made with crushed mud snails and 
found the unrefined gutsiness to be addictive. Refined foods are delicious in 
their ability to lift, balance and give poise to a dish, but I always miss the 
extra information we sacrifice with refining, and I am prepared to ingest a 
little stink and rot to get it.

Isaan mushroom salad

Serves 4
4 large handfuls meaty mixed mushrooms (such as oyster or wild mushrooms), 
tough stems trimmed and reserved to make mushroom stock
Vegetable oil, for frying
A pinch of salt
4-5 shallots/1 red onion, finely chopped
Half a handful of mint leaves, roughly chopped
1 tbsp roasted sticky rice powder (optional)

For the dressing
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tbsp mushroom stock (see below)
1 tbsp palm sugar (or caster sugar)
1 tsp dried red chilli powder
2 lemongrass sticks, outer stalks removed, finely chopped

1 In a heavy-based pan (or even better, on a barbecue), cook the mushrooms in 
a little oil with a pinch of salt.

2 To make the mushroom stock, grill or fry the mushroom trimmings, then boil 
with a cup of water, and reduce by half.

3 Combine the dressing ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

4 Add the remaining ingredients to the mushrooms, cover with the dressing and 
mix well. Taste the liquor for seasoning: it should be umami-rich and a little 
sour: adjust if need be. Heap on to a plate and serve.

Herbal pork curry soup from Isaan (gaeng om)

Often eaten with laap – a meat-based salad usually made with chicken, duck, 
pork or beef – or grilled meats, this is a herbal, cleansing soup, seasoned with
pla raaor fish sauce.

Serves 3-4, as part of a meal
For the paste (produces 10 portions)
10g long red chillies, soaked then roasted over a flame to bring them to life, 
then sliced
15g lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves peeled, using the fragrant inner 
leaves, finely sliced
2-3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
1 makrut lime leaf, smashed into a paste

For the soup
300g pork shoulder or belly meat, cut into 1cm thick, bite-size pieces
2 tbsp vegetable oil
750ml chicken or pork stock
1 large handful of lemon basil or Thai basil leaves
1 large bunch dill, cut into 3cm strips, stems included
30ml fish sauce/pla raa if you can find it
A squeeze of lemon or lime

1 Grind the paste ingredients finely in a pestle and mortar in the order 
listed.

2 Rub the paste into the meat and, in a large wok or saucepan, fry on a low 
heat in the oil until fragrant, about 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to let it 
burn.

3 Add the stock and simmer until it has thickened to the consistency of 
minestrone. It should have reddish oily slick on the surface.

4 Remove from the heat, add the basil and dill, stir in the fish sauce or pla 
raa in small quantities and taste as you go.

5 Squeeze in the lemon or lime, stir and taste. It should be fragrant, and 
have a balance of spicy and sour and slightly salty.

6 Pour the curry into a large bowl and serve with unseasoned steamed Thai 
jasmine rice.
