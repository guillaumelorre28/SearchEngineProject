Everton will take that point. It keeps them top of their group on five points, 
with Wolfsburg in second place with four points after they beat Krasnodar 4-2 
earlier. Thanks for reading. Bye.

90 min: Origi wins a corner off Hibbert on the left. Can Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> do anything with it? “I went the 
same way as JR in Illinois (Wikipedia) and felt a wave of anxiety and sadness 
that since I’ve spent the last twenty years in North America, I’ve lost touch 
culturally with my country of birth,” says John Willoug. “Then I had a massive 
flood of relief and happiness on the same subject.”

89 min: Mendes bursts through the middle, beating a couple of Everton 
defenders, and then messes up an easy pass to Martin. The chance is gone and
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> counter. Besic finds 
Eto’o on the left and he cuts inside before sending a curler not too far wide 
of the far post.

71 min: Howard wins yet another battle with Origi. It’s like the World Cup 
never ended. Origi was released by a sharp pass from Balmont but Howard was 
alert to the danger, speeding off his line to smother just in time. Moments 
later, Balmont tries a volley from 30 yards; straight at Howard.

64 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> make their 
first change. Romelu Lukaku replaces Steven Pienaar - and Lukaku almost makes 
an instant impact! He runs on to a loose ball, capitalising on some indecision, 
and rolls a pass through to the onrushing McGeady but his scuff is half-saved 
by Eneyama and Souare completes the clearance.
 Aiden McGeady watches the ball beat goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama but it is 
eventually cleared, still 0-0. Photograph: Etienne Laurent/EPA

all eleven players in the penalty area,” says Duncan Smith. “Only McGeady is 
even close to the edge of the box. There’s not only no out ball, but theEverton

60 min: “Am I the only Liverpool-supporting MBMer who, while following the 
match while ‘working’, thinks that Origi might suit our presently striker-free 
club?” says Lou Roper. “Oh. I suppose Brentan--sorry, Brendan--knows best, 
though?’ I thought it was part of the agreement that Origi had to go back to
Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> on loan.

58 min: So, after all that, a corner to Lille on the right, which almost 
results in a chance for the home side. A low ball was helped into the six-yard 
box and it seemed likeEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
were about to crack but fortunately for them, Barkley managed to hack clear.

57 min: Pienaar and Beria are both booked after some nonsense. Beria twice 
appealed for handball against Baines after he blocked crosses with his arms 
raised, but had to settle for a corner instead. It didn’t look like handball in 
either case but the replays didn’t tell us much. That didn’t stop Beria 
appealing, much to the annoyance of Pienaar, causing the two to engage in 
lively debate. In the end, a booking for the pair of them. They are, unless I’m 
much mistaken, grown adults.

56 min: Eto’o takes it, not Baines, but although his low bouncer beats the 
wall, it’s a tame effort, straight at Enyeama.

54 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> make their way 
up the other end and Barkley is fouled on the edge of the area by Balmont. It’s 
made for a right-footer but Baines might fancy it. “I liked the one with the 
hat,” announces Tim Jones.

53 min (the football version): Lille threaten again and of course it’s Origi 
who’s threatening. He turns effortlessly away from his marker and then whistles 
a drive not too far over the bar from 20 yards. Howard didn’t seem too 
concerned.

50 min: Mavuba slides a good pass down the left to Origi, who tries to sprint 
away from Jagielka, who does just about enough to concede a corner. Credit to 
Jagielka for not letting the very quick Origi to race away from him. The corner 
is headed away.

Everton will take that point. It keeps them top of their group on five points, 
with Wolfsburg in second place with four points after they beat Krasnodar 4-2 
earlier. Thanks for reading. Bye.
 
A brilliant performance from James McCarthy.
 
90 min+2: Ross Barkley off, James McCarthy on.
 
90 min+1: No.
 
90 min: Origi wins a corner off Hibbert on the left. Can Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> do anything with it? “I went the 
same way as JR in Illinois (Wikipedia) and felt a wave of anxiety and sadness 
that since I’ve spent the last twenty years in North America, I’ve lost touch 
culturally with my country of birth,” says John Willoug. “Then I had a massive 
flood of relief and happiness on the same subject.”
 
89 min: Mendes bursts through the middle, beating a couple of Everton 
defenders, and then messes up an easy pass to Martin. The chance is gone and
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> counter. Besic finds 
Eto’o on the left and he cuts inside before sending a curler not too far wide 
of the far post.
 
86 min: Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> make a change, 
Mavuba replaced by Marvin “The Martian” Martin.

yellow cards for their trouble. Photograph: Matthew Impey/Wired Photos/Rex  
85 min: “Up until this very minute i had never heard of S Club 7,” says JR in 
Illinois. “I am thinking I have not been missing anything and don’t want to 
chance being proven wrong so I will absolutely not click on the video you 
provided. I did give them a quick lookup on Wikipedia. I’m going to go ahead 
and assume that Paul Cattermole is Lee’s brother.”
 
82 min: Christian Atsu on, Aiden McGeady off, thus meaning I can issue my 
daily reminder that Chelsea own Christian Atsu.
 
81 min: Eto’o ... Besic ... Hibbert ... Hibbert ... in the Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> area ... in space ... Hibbert ... 
Hibbert ... HIBBERT ... GOAL? No.
 
79 min: The Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> fans are 
passing the time by singing the French national anthem. It’s one of the best. 
But not as good as Italy’s, to be fair.
 
78 min: Watching corners get headed away by the man at the near post never 
fails to lift my spirits.
 
75 min: Simon Kjaer blasts his effort straight into the wall. And that’s the 
end of that.
 
74 min: A twist, a turn, a shimmy from Gueye, and a trip by Besic, already on 
a booking, givesLille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> a free-kick 
in a dangerous position.
 
73 min: Ryan Mendes replaces Rodelin for Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille>.
 
71 min: Howard wins yet another battle with Origi. It’s like the World Cup 
never ended. Origi was released by a sharp pass from Balmont but Howard was 
alert to the danger, speeding off his line to smother just in time. Moments 
later, Balmont tries a volley from 30 yards; straight at Howard.
 
68 min: “Once again, Hibbert’s made a dart forward” must be the most joyful 
sentence ever to be uttered.
 
65 min: Barkley’s shot from the left is deflected a few yards over. Corner. 
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have livened up all of a 
sudden.
 
64 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> make their 
first change. Romelu Lukaku replaces Steven Pienaar - and Lukaku almost makes 
an instant impact! He runs on to a loose ball, capitalising on some indecision, 
and rolls a pass through to the onrushing McGeady but his scuff is half-saved 
by Eneyama and Souare completes the clearance.

eventually cleared, still 0-0. Photograph: Etienne Laurent/EPA  
62 min: “Half the uncertainty from the Lille corners stems from Everton having 
all eleven players in the penalty area,” says Duncan Smith. “Only McGeady is 
even close to the edge of the box. There’s not only no out ball, but theEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> players are getting in each 
others way. Bizarre tactical decision.”
 
60 min: “Am I the only Liverpool-supporting MBMer who, while following the 
match while ‘working’, thinks that Origi might suit our presently striker-free 
club?” says Lou Roper. “Oh. I suppose Brentan--sorry, Brendan--knows best, 
though?’ I thought it was part of the agreement that Origi had to go back to
Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> on loan.
 
58 min: So, after all that, a corner to Lille on the right, which almost 
results in a chance for the home side. A low ball was helped into the six-yard 
box and it seemed likeEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
were about to crack but fortunately for them, Barkley managed to hack clear.
 
57 min: Pienaar and Beria are both booked after some nonsense. Beria twice 
appealed for handball against Baines after he blocked crosses with his arms 
raised, but had to settle for a corner instead. It didn’t look like handball in 
either case but the replays didn’t tell us much. That didn’t stop Beria 
appealing, much to the annoyance of Pienaar, causing the two to engage in 
lively debate. In the end, a booking for the pair of them. They are, unless I’m 
much mistaken, grown adults.
 
56 min: Eto’o takes it, not Baines, but although his low bouncer beats the 
wall, it’s a tame effort, straight at Enyeama.
 
54 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> make their way 
up the other end and Barkley is fouled on the edge of the area by Balmont. It’s 
made for a right-footer but Baines might fancy it. “I liked the one with the 
hat,” announces Tim Jones.
 
53 min (the football version): Lille threaten again and of course it’s Origi 
who’s threatening. He turns effortlessly away from his marker and then whistles 
a drive not too far over the bar from 20 yards. Howard didn’t seem too 
concerned.
 
53 min: Who was your favourite member of S Club 7?
 
50 min: Mavuba slides a good pass down the left to Origi, who tries to sprint 
away from Jagielka, who does just about enough to concede a corner. Credit to 
Jagielka for not letting the very quick Origi to race away from him. The corner 
is headed away.
 
48 min: Nothing has happened yet. Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have not been good on the ball.
 
46 min: Off we go again. Here’s hoping for better in this second half. We
