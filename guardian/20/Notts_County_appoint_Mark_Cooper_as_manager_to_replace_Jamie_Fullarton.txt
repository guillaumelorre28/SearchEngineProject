Notts County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottscounty> have appointed 
Mark Cooper as their new manager on a deal that will initially run until the 
end of the season.

Jamie Fullarton was following Saturday’s heavy 4-1 defeat at home to Exeter, 
69 days and 12 games after taking charge.

The club’s owner, Ray Trew, has moved swiftly to bring in Cooper, 47, on an 
incentivised deal whereby, if the former Swindon manager reaches an agreed 
points total, it will automatically result in a permanent contract.

“I said on Saturday that what we need now, as a club, is stability, as we look 
to resolve the change of ownership, and that is why I have turned to Mark to 
bring his experience and knowledge to the club to help turn things around on 
the pitch,” Trew said in a statement.

“To be fair to Mark and to reward him, should he manage to get things moving 
in the right direction, I have agreed a points total with him, which will 
remain confidential, at which point his deal will become permanent.

“I think what we all want is for Notts to be successful and, if Mark can bring 
that, then it is only right that he is given the role full-time, which I think 
any new owner would agree with. The challenge has been set and I look forward 
to seeing what he can bring to the role.”

Cooper, who parted company with Swindon

 last October, will take charge of his first game at Portsmouth next weekend.
