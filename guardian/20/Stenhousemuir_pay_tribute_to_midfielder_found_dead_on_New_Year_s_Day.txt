Stenhousemuir <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stenhousemuir> have paid 
tribute to the midfielder Kyle Doherty, who was found dead on New Year’s Day, 
aged 19, following a night out in Manchester.

Doherty’s body was found approximately 20 hours after he was reported missing 
from Suede bar, off Deansgate, where he had been celebrating the new year with 
friends.

“I am extremely saddened to have to report that one of our under-20s team 
players, Kyle Doherty, has been found dead following a night out in 
Manchester,” said the Stenhousemuir chairman, Bill Darroch, in a club statement.

“We are all devastated by this news and our immediate thoughts are with Kyle’s 
family and friends at this sad and difficult time. Kyle was a talented 
footballer and had been a part of Stenhousemuir since signing for us in July 
2013. He had become a regular in our under-20s team and was starting to break 
through in to the first-team squad. He was liked and valued by his team-mates 
and coaches alike. He will be missed by all who knew him.

“The entire club is in shock at this most terrible of news and we offer our 
deepest condolences to Kyle’s family and friends.”

Doherty was last seen by friends at 12.30am reported missing at 1.45am on New 
Year’s Day and it is believed he fell into a courtyard, where his body was 
found at approximately 10pm, inside the historic Milton Hall building at the 
junction of St John Street and Deansgate.

The Stenhousemuir midfielder Sean Dickson joined Darroch in paying tribute 
Doherty, writing on his Twitter account: “RIP Kyle. Was a pleasure to play 
along side him. A great player and an even better lad will be greatly missed.”
