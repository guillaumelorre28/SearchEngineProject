Lester gained acclaim when he played Hamlet for director Peter Brook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/19/peter-brook-theatre-director-at-90>
 in a stripped-back production at the Bouffes du Nord theatre in Paris in 2000 
and theYoung Vic in London the following year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/aug/23/theatre.artsfeatures>. For 
Shakespeare Solos, he delivers the “to be or not to be” soliloquy which the 
actor describes as “Shakespeare at his best”. Lester said he hardly had to 
relearn the soliloquy before filming the video as he and Brook had spent “so 
long getting it in the blood” for the stage production. Lester, who is 
currently appearing inRed Velvet at the Garrick theatre in London 
<http://www.branaghtheatre.com/red-velvet/>, said the speech captures the 
“quiet, profound nature” of Hamlet’s despair and that it is also “an 
intellectual outpouring, because Hamlet is a very bookish person. But at the 
heart of it is a very fundamental question about whether he should live or die.”

 Adrian Lester as Hamlet 
For Lester, playing Shakespeare on camera was “quite liberating, because the 
complexity of all of those thoughts can be brought right down for the screen. 
You don’t have to do anything but believe what you’re saying … rather than 
turning front and centre [on stage] and firing it down to the audience. The 
complexity of thought has a delicacy to it. You have to be careful about it – 
at times, it can be slightly destroyed when you’re concentrating on technically 
making sure the audience can hear you and delivering the kind of bombast 
required.”

 Roger Allam as King Lear 
While Lester’s solo found him returning to a familiar speech, Roger Allam’s 
gave him the opportunity to play a part he has long desired a crack at: King 
Lear, which is often described as a mountain of a role. One stormy night, when 
he wasplaying Falstaff at Shakespeare’s Globe in London in 2010 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/henry-iv-parts-1-and-2-shakespeares-globe-london-2027756.html>
, Allam surprised audiences by suddenly going into Lear’s “Blow, winds, and 
crack your cheeks” speech. He performs those lines for Shakespeare Solos.

 Eileen Atkins as Emilia 
The videos, directed by Dan Susman, have been mostly shot at the Guardian’s 
multimedia studio but Atkins was filmed on location at a restaurant for her 
performance as Emilia from Othello. We are put in Desdemona’s place as Atkins 
intimately addresses the camera: “But I do think it is their husbands’ faults 
if wives do fall.” Emilia is one of the characters Atkins is currently playing 
in her one-woman show at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.

 Joanna Vanderham as Juliet 
Joanna Vanderham, who played Desdemona for the RSC last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/othello-rsc-stratford-hugh-quarshie-lucian-msamati-joanna-vanderham>
, chose lines from the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet for her solo, which 
was recorded by candlelight. “I auditioned for Juliet at high school and I 
missed out,” laughs the star of the BBC1 drama The Paradise, who has recently 
appeared in the West End in The Dazzle. “Romeo and Juliet is such a beautiful 
play. The strength of their love is so admirable. It took me a while to get my 
head around that depth of love and to accept that it can exist. In her speech 
you can feel how many different thoughts she’s got going at one time. It’s 
quite incredible how Shakespeare can turn his hand to any age, any gender, and 
capture them absolutely perfectly. It is a 13-year-old girl’s mind: all these 
different thoughts that come out in a stream.”

 David Morrissey as Richard III 
David Morrissey, who was a member of the RSC in the late 1980s and is 
currently starring inHangmen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/27/hangmen-martin-mcdonagh-royal-court-review-david-morrissey-reece-shearsmith-tremendous-terrifying>
 in the West End, was cast as Richard III for his solo and delivers the 
scheming Richard’s opening speech. While the majority of the videos offer a 
one-off opportunity to see these actors try out new roles, Ayesha Dharker’s 
solo also offers a taste of one of this year’s most anticipated Shakespeare 
productions. She recorded Titania’s “these are the forgeries of jealousy” 
speech from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Dharker takes up the role of Titaniaon 
stage in Stratford 
<http://www.rsc.org.uk/a-midsummer-nights-dream/about-the-play> later this 
month. That production will tour the UK from March to June, with local amateur 
companies joining the RSC’s actors on stage.
