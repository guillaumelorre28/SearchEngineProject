Márquez, the world championship leader who dislocated his shoulder in Sunday 
morning's warm-up session, started on pole on his Honda but Yamaha's Lorenzo 
made an early move to overtake him.

Márquez, bidding for his fifth win in a row, fought back to regain the lead on 
the last lap before Lorenzo nipped past him again to seal victory on the line 
by less than a tenth of a second.

Honda's Dani Pedrosa finished third to complete a Spanish sweep of the podium, 
while Briton Cal Crutchlow, who suffered a 180mph crash in practice, finished 
seventh.

Later Márquez was docked two points for failing to observe safety regulations 
during the warm-up session that led to his crash.

The Spaniard did not slow down when yellow flags were waved after an earlier 
accident before crashing at the same place on the track and causing the 
dislocation.

"He [Márquez] continued at racing speed and did not slow down and be prepared 
to stop as required by the regulations," FIM, the sport's ruling body, said in 
a statement.

"His subsequent crash at the same point as the previous accident seriously 
endangered the rider being attended and the marshals in the accident zone.

"A Race Direction hearing was held. The decision is to impose two penalty 
points on the 2013 season total of theMotoGP

said.
