Welcome back, beginners, to our ongoing series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners>
 which tries to show that cryptic clues are considerably less baffling than 
they tend to seem.

This time, it’s a device that you’re already familiar with from your 
non-crosswording life, but also one which you may not always realise you’re 
being asked to put into solving action.

Before we proceed, let’s reassure ourselves that cryptic clues typically offer 
no fewer than two ways to find the answer, in either order: a definition of it 
(indicated inbold in the examples that follow) and some wordplay.

More happily still, in a genuine puzzle environment you’re not dealing with 
each clue in brute isolation: you will have help from the letters of the other 
clues, giving you multiple ways in to each miniature puzzle. Fear not!

How does it work?

Cryptic clues will, on occasion, feature a number, either as a numeral like 
“4” or a word like, well, “four”.

After absorbing the advice below, your instinct will, rightly, be to swiftly 
translate that number into Roman numerals …

 * one = I 
 * five = V 
 * ten = X 
 * fifty = L 
... and so on <http://math2.org/math/general/numnotation.htm>, then to regard 
the letter or letters you’ve come up with as a likely part of the answer. As 
you do so, it’s important to put out of your mind any bewilderment at those 
Europeans and their mule-headed adherence to this ineffectual alternative to 
al-Andalusian numerals. For you, that baffling ambiguity is, typically for 
crosswording, transformed from ugly bug to beguiling feature.

(If you want to pause, however, and wonder why it is that schoolchildren have 
continued to absorb this obsolete technology, or why a television programme 
might end with a © and what is effectively a miniature puzzle ... well, go 
nuts.)

When you come back, reacquaint yourself if necessary 
<http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/roman-numerals.htm> with the kooky 
means by which Roman numerals get to four and nine, and so on. Then you’re 
ready to substitute!

For example, here’s a clue 
<http://independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_221114.bin> by 
Nimrod (known locally asEnigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
) ...

16d Four-year climber (3)
[ Roman numeral for “four” + abbrev. for “year” ]
[ IV + Y ]

... where the Roman 4 gets us almost all of the way to the answer, IVY.

Or you might have to combine this device with one of the others we’ve met 
here. Rememberputting one thing inside another

? Wonderful!Here’s Osmosis 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=23821> ...

11a Scientific pioneer, 50, appearing in long film (9)
[ L inside synonym for “long” and synonym for “mist”]
[ L inside ACHE and MIST ]

... asking you to do just that for ALCHEMIST. 

Some more examples

Part of the fun is seeing something as potentially dreary as a number used to 
add texture to a cryptic clue that effectively works as a short story.Here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26398>’s Pasquale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale>
 ...

13ac Excursion transporting a hundred female partners to watch men? Rascals! 
(10)
[ synonym for “excursion” containing Roman numeral for “a hundred”, then term 
for “female partners to watch men”]
[ C inside SALLY and WAGS ]

... clueing SCALLYWAGS. And here <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rufus>’s 
Rufus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/feb/22/meet-the-setter-rufus>
 ...

5ac Well-known batsman gets 500 and is honoured (6)
[ name of a “well-known batsman” + Roman numeral for “500” ]
[ GRACE + D ]

... depicting GRACED using an implausibly heart-warming moment at the crease.

It’s not always that simple

Now then. A device isn’t going to be beloved of setters if it only has that 
one single interpretation, is it?

It’s time to ’fess that a number in a clue is equally like to refer to, well, 
another clue. That is to say, a “4”might mean that you should start mouthing 
“IV” to yourself, but itmight just as well mean that the meaning of the answer 
to (or, I concede, the letters in the answer of) four across (or, I should add, 
four down) are going to provide your starting point.

Sorry. Here’s a good example 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26375>, from Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul>
, from a puzzle in which 23 down is INDIA:

16ac Six abandoning support for members somewhere in 23 (4)
[ remove Roman numeral for “six” from a synonym for “support for members”]
[ VIAGRA – VI ]

So, at one end of the clue, the numbers travel via Rome to become letters; at 
the other, the numbers send you off to another part of the grid and XXIII has 
nothing to do with the VIAGRA that is the answer.

Here’s another example <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26198>, 
fromQaos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/nov/29/crossword-blog-setter-qaos>
, from a puzzle in which one down is CHIC:

14d 50% off 1 ice cream? (6-4)
[ half of the answer to one down ]
[ half of CHIC ]

So Qaos is asking you to lop off half of CHIC, then work backwards to see that 
IC is one before 100, which is 99, which in its own way isan ice cream 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2BWjgLEMNo>. And so you can take a moment to 
write NINETY-NINE into the grid, hyphenation per your discretion.

It won’t surprise you to learn that there is controversy 
<http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question45219.html> over whether a “real Roman” 
would have represented 99 with an IC, or with XCIX. It’s a fun enough debate if 
you’re into that kind of thing, but for crosswording purposes, you’re entering 
a world in which IC simply is 99, IM simply is 999 – and the clues are the more 
elegant for it. Understandably so, since the English language has many more 
words containing IC than it does XCIXs.

Beyond that? Here, please, is surely not the place to examine the Listener 
<http://listenercrossword.com/>’s penchant for the medieval Roman numerals 
<http://www.highlightpress.com.au/cryptic-clue-roman-numerals.html> for, god 
help us, 7, 11, 70, 80, 90, 150, 160 and so on. Get a copy ofChambers 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/chambers-dictionary-4.html> and godspeed. But 
I will mentiona clue 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c8b3542ecd30139d9ca4f9702f0/print_solution/3>
 byAnax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/nov/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-anax>
 as a sample of another kind of willful mischief:

11ac Sex with a spiteful person (5)
[ Roman numeral corresponding to “sex” + synonym for “a”]
[ VI + PER ]

Oh, Anax. Indeed: what we call “six” was known by the Romans as “sex” and 
written “VI”. And that inconspicuous word “a” can, I grant you, mean “per” –in 
phrases like “10 times a day”. And so VIPER is, strictly speaking, a fair 
answer. And a wonderful solve.

Over to you

Newcomers, any questions? And seasoned solvers, any favourite examples to 
share? I have recently been deeply tickled bythis 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=23676>, from a 
setter I take to be Sleuth:

15d Top Forty in Rome on radio (5)
[ Roman numeral for “forty”, as you would hear it on the radio ]
[ soundalike for XL ]

EXCEL-lent.
