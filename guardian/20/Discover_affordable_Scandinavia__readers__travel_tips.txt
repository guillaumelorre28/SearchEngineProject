Winning tip: Sea lido near Stockholm, Sweden


You’ll find this 1920s Swedish bathhouse and open sea lido a half hour’s train 
ride from Stockholm city centre. Saltisbadet is run by a group of volunteers, 
who restored it after decades of neglect. The main building, three-tiered and 
entirely made of wood, juts into the sea and is flanked by a little beach and 
sailing boats. A restaurant on the deck serves simple, delicious Swedish food. 
There is no better place to let a day drift by. Have a sauna, go for a swim, 
snooze in a deckchair, and jump off the roof (more pirate ship plank than 
diving board) into the sea – if you’re feeling brave enough.
• Admission £6, saltisbadet.se <http://www.saltisbadet.se/index.htm>

A nature trip that’s easier to reach from London than some UK beauty spots, 
Sweden’s Dalsland region – in the country’s Lake District – offers the right 
blend of wilderness and accessibility. We did a four-day long weekend of 
canoeing and camping and managed around 120km, starting from Ed on the Lake 
Stora Le. We drank directly from the lake it was so clean (although caution is 
advised), and although you can camp anywhere, there are maintained campsites 
with sawdust toilets and basic shelters at scenic points in the surrounding
Tresticklans national park 
<https://sverigesnationalparker.se/en/choose-park---list/tresticklan-national-park/visitor-information/getting-here/>
 – we had a private island every night! Nearest airports are Gothenberg and 
Rygge both of which have a 1.5-hour train link to Ed costing from £17. Canoe 
rental is around £20 a day fromCanondal <http://www.canodal.com/>, and all food 
can be bought from the supermarket and taken with you. The entire trip is 
doable from around £200pp (perhaps less if you grab a particularly cheap 
flight).

Holiday rentals are very cheap in Scandinavia in the last two weeks of August 
and early September when UK schools are still off – we’ve found it cheaper than 
the UK. For example, we’ve stayed in an idyllic three-bedroom house five metres 
from the shoreline on a small island off southern Sweden for £400 for a week in 
August throughNovasol <http://www.novasol.co.uk/>.

For those who like to enjoy a local beer on holiday, Iceland might seem a 
pretty expensive place to go. However, there are two tricks which can cut the 
cost of your tipple. At Keflavík airport there’s a duty-free shop in arrivals 
where you can pick up tax-free alcohol, including many local brands (personal 
favourites: Einstök beer and Reyka vodka). Many Icelanders do the same thing 
when they arrive in the country, to take advantage of the vastly reduced 
prices. Indeed, locals tend to head out later in the evening once they’re well 
lubricated with their own stock. Another money-saving aid is theReykjavík Appy 
Hour app <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reykjavik-appy-hour/id536126333?mt=8>
. It’ll tell you exactly where to go to find two-for-one deals, and when they 
operate.

 is the birthplace of fantastic plastic and offers a more authentic alternative 
to its British cousin in Windsor. At the end of August (when the Scandinavian 
children are back at school), the theme park is empty, apart from the UK 
families who all had the same clever idea as you. To further cut costs, a quick 
look onGerman ebay <http://www.ebay.de/bhp/legoland-ticket> will find 2-for-1 
vouchers for only one euro (search for “Legoland gutschein”), meaning that the 
children get in free! British Airways and Ryanair both fly direct to Billund.

The blue lagoon may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but at almost £50 a 
ticket and a fair distance outside Reykjavik, some travellers might prefer a 
closer, cheaper alternative such as the warm and wonderful Laugardalslaug 
baths, a huge outdoor swimming pool complex in the heart of the city next to 
the botanical gardens. They are best explored late at night, when steam rises 
from the water and the northern lights may be flickering above. There’s a 
50-metre indoor pool and outdoor pools, thermal pools, hot tubs, a steam bath, 
waterslides and a saltwater pool. It’s an affordable and truly Icelandic 
experience which you can attend every day of your visit if you fancy.

If you rent an all-electric car in Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/29/norway-electric-cars-sale> 
you are, for now, exempt from parking fees and toll payments (including ferries 
– very useful in the Stavanger area) and can use bus lanes. Charging points are 
free and plentiful. However, we opted for a hybrid car for our trip starting in 
Stavanger. We were sceptical when the man at the rental office told us we 
wouldn’t have to top up the tank despite planning to drive over 500km around 
the mountains and fjords of Rogaland. But he was right (we used just over 
quarter of a tank) and left the country happy that our visitor eco-footprint 
had been tiny. We chose the hybrid as we planned a few longer drives, but if 
you’re planning on staying in the city an even more economic option would be to 
go totally electric, charging points are free and plentiful.

Af Chapman is a hostel on a 19th-century ship moored by the tranquil island of 
Skeppsholmen just a few minutes’ walk from the centre of Stockholm and directly 
opposite the Royal Castle. It’s an excellent, affordable alternative to 
expensive hotels and increasingly pricey Airbnb apartments in the city. The 
rooms have been carefully restored – wooden interiors and a clean Scandinavian 
aesthetic – while the terrace provides great views across the Old Town. The 
onboard cafe offers breakfast and light meals.
