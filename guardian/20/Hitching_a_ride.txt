Dennis and the TAG Group - each owning 30% in the Group - will continue to be 
in charge of operational management. McLaren, along with Ferrari are touted as 
the front runners in the up coming grand prix championship starting in March.

DaimlerChrysler was yesterday reported to be in talks before merging its car 
business with the dominant Italian car maker Fiat. Newspaper La Repubblica 
reported that the Agnelli family, which founded the company at the beginning of 
the last century, are buying Fiat shares with voting rights, including 
preference shares, to strengthen the family holding. The family is thought to 
want 51% of voting rights in before a scheduled extraordinary shareholders 
meeting. Such a level of voting rights would allow the family to carry out 
"without excessive difficulty" the spin-off of the car business. Fiat refused 
to comment on the reports which have driven its share price up 5% to €34.50 
(£21.50). It has seen its share of the car market in Italy grow in the past 
year. It had 39.1% of the new car market in last month, up from 32.7% in 
January 1999.
