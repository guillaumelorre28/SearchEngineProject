The day was never going to end without a booking for Fellaini, was it? In 
fairness, I’m not sure he deserved it, as he merely gave Djuric a gentle push. 
Not that he’ll be too bothered: the match he’ll now miss is against Gibraltar, 
who, by the way, are now 4-0 down to Estonia.

89 min: Ronaldo pulls out a tackle near half-way: very wise, as going into 
challenges with Andorrans is like playing chicken with a steamroller.

GOAL! Portugal 6-0 Andorra (A Silva 86)

Another nice goal for Portugal. Quaresma caught the keeper by surprise with a 
cheeky freekick with the outside of his right foot, and Silva fired in the 
rebound, via a nick off a defender.

GOAL! Belgium 4-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Lukaku 79)

A proper budgie. Lukaku collects a flipped pass from Hazard at the edge of the 
area, then holds off one defender as he turns and barges past another and curls 
a shot into the top corner with the aid of a deflection! His brother Jordan, 
who was subbed off injured earlier on, waves a crutch in the air on the 
sidelines in celebration!

78 min: Zippy interplay by Belgium - they can be so fine when they play with 
speed. Hazard and Mertens combine with each other - using Lukaku as a wall as 
they go - but Hazard fails to crown the move with a goal, curling over from 18 
yards.

GOAL! Estonia 3-0 Gibraltar (Kait 71)

I didn’t see the goal because I was watching more top-level fouling, Lulic 
getting booked for booting the back of Hazard’s calf as the Chelsea player 
embarked on a trademark skedaddle towards the box.

Gameiro is replaced by Gignac, having made his point and, surely, confirmed 
himself as France’s top predator, what with Karim Benzema still in exile.

Greizman is the creator, Gameiro the deadly finisher. That’s a format that 
risks doing a lot of damage for a good while yet.

GOAL! Portugal 5-0 Andorra (Ronaldo 68)

Another goal for Ronaldo -his fourth of the game - and another exquisite 
finish. Fonte headed the ball towards the near post after reaching a long cross 
from the other side, and Ronaldo swivels and catches it beautifully on the 
bounce to wallop a low shot into the net from eight yards. Guess there was no 
question of him coming off when there were more goals up fro grabs.

RED CARD!

Apparently Andorra have committed 15 fouls so far against Portugal. Thats the 
problem with statistics: they say nothing aboutquality - Andorra have been 
ludicrously wild in their tackling. Oh, and just as I was writing that they got 
their first red card of the evening, Rubio being ordered off for sweeping 
Ronaldo off his feet with an absurd late swipe. I’ll be concentrating mostly on 
this game from here on in, its very much one for the purists. Textbook 
recklessness from the visitors.

GOAL! Holland 3-1 Belarus (Klaassen 55)

Klaasen converts the rebound after a shot by Janssen came back off a post. 
That complicates the Belarussian revival that began early in the second half 
when Rios pulled a goal back for the visitors.

GOAL! Hungary 1-1 Switzerland (Szalai 53)

OK, that last entry may have been premature. Hungary have drawn level 
quick-sharp with a close-range tap-in. Which is not to be confused with a 
50-yard tap-in, obviously.

Pjanic cops an elbow in the face from Vertonghen, plus a knee in the back, as 
the pair challenge for a high ball. Not a foul, just impressive flexibility and 
reach from the Belgian.

GOAL! Portugal 4-0 Andorra (Ronaldo 46)

Ronaldo sweeps the ball into the net from 12 yards to complete his hat-trick 
and perhaps also his match: no point in him hanging around now, not with so 
many Andorran bogeymen about.

GOAL! Portugal 3-0 Andorra (Cancelo 43)

That’s an unbelievable goal! The young fullback dashes to the byline and tries 
to flash the ball across the face of goal - but it takes a bobble, hits him on 
the shin and flies into the net past a bewildered keeper from a ridiculous 
angle! That’s some kind of cosmic punishment for the minnows’ carefree hacking.

Andorra’s tackling is outrageous. There’s a thin line between admirable 
determination and vicious recklessness - and Andorra drive a tank through it. 
No way this match is going to end without a red card or two: only question is 
whether the first one goes to an Andorran fouler or a Portugal player who 
retaliates.

France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> are in le groove now. 
Gameiro plays in the Sidibé with an extravagant backheeled pass. The fullback 
collects the ball and then goes down in the box under a challenge by Milanov. 
The ref is unmoved.

GOAL! Belgium 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Hazard 28)

A contest that was extremely closed suddenly looks over. Bosnia have 
collapsed, and they were punished by a lovely finish by Hazard, who feinted his 
way past Begovic before tapping into the net from close range.

GOAL! France 1-1 Bulgaria (Gameiro 23)

Sagna makes up for conceding the penalty by swinging in a beautiful cross from 
the right It’s exactly the sort of service that Gameiro thrives off, and the 
striker proves the point by diving to send a header into the net.

A lively start to the game in Brussels, where both sides have shown their

We have liftoff! All matches are now underway. Let’s have a friendly bet as to 
which match will get the first goal. I’m saying Portugal v Andorra. If I’m 
right, you all have to down a pint immediately. If I’m wrong, I have to. So, 
er, come onFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, Gibraltar, 
Switzerland, Hungary et al!

As the Belgian and Bosnian players exchange pre-match handslaps, Thibaut 
Courtois and Asmir Begovic resist any temptation to put in extra force in an 
attempt to secure the Chelsea No1 spot. The ref in this game - for those of you 
seeking another English angle - is Martin Atkinson.

A chunk of the crowd at the Stade de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> is booing the Bulgarian national 
anthem. Obviously they can hold a grudge even longer than Gérard Houllier and 
David Ginola.

Preamble:

Hi. If you’re reading this, then you’re probably not one of those people who 
regards international football as a damnable nuisance that gets in the way of 
club action. Or maybe you are, and you’re tuning in just to find out whether 
your favourite player is going to survive today’s fixture list and return to 
your favourite club intact – if that’s the case, then be advised that I’ll be 
sure to let you know if Alfreton Town’s Adam Priestly pulls up with a calf 
strain while on duty forGibraltar in Estonia today. Otherwise, let’s all look 
forward to some intriguing matches, including:


 * A first competitive meeting between Greece and Cyprus for nearly 30 years. 
 * Roberto Martinez’s biggest test so far as Belgium manager, as he and 
Thierry Henry try to rouse an injury-ravaged side to victory over
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who began their campaign last month by marmalising Estonia. 
Beware of the backlash, Gibraltar! 
 * Portugal’s inevitable victory over Andorra, and Switzerland’s attempt to 
stay ahead of the European champions by winning away inHungary, who have ground 
to make up and respect to regain after drawing 0-0 with the Faroe Islands last 
month. 
 * Holland began restoring their own damaged dignity by drawing 1-1 in Sweden 
last month but still have a long way to go to convince anyone that the country 
of Cruyff, Van Basten and Kromkamp is back as a footballing force. A home win 
overBelarus today may seem like flimsy evidence but no case could be built 
without it given that Group A is among the toughest ones in Europe, with 
Holland and Sweden accompanied by France and Bulgaria France. Which bring us on 
to … 
 * France’s latest attempt to reassert the quality that Didier Deschamps has 
not yet managed to bring out, andBulgaria’s attempt to channel the spirit of 
Emil Kostadinov, the man who put the ‘oh là là là là là là là là là là” and “
aïe, aïe, aïe!” into “spectacular last minute winner”. Here, a thing of beauty 
is a joy forever:
oh là là là là là là là là là là ... aïe, aïe, aïe! 
Here’s the full list of matches we’ll be following:

 * Belgium v Bos-Herz 
 * Estoniav Gibraltar 
 * France v Bulgaria 
 * Greece v Cyprus 
 * Hungaryv Switzerlnd 
 * Latvia v Faroe Isl 
 * Luxembourg v Sweden 
 * Holland v Belarus 
 * 

 * 

 * One notable result from earlier in the day was a fine draw for the Cranes 
of Uganda in Tamale:Ghana 0-0 Uganda 
 * 

 *

 Switzerland’s Valentin Stocker, who scored late, celebrates after the game.

The day was never going to end without a booking for Fellaini, was it? In 
fairness, I’m not sure he deserved it, as he merely gave Djuric a gentle push. 
Not that he’ll be too bothered: the match he’ll now miss is against Gibraltar, 
who, by the way, are now 4-0 down to Estonia.
 
Dzemaili heads on, and Stocker smashes into the net from 10 yards! Can the 
Swiss hold on to their lead this time?
 
89 min: Ronaldo pulls out a tackle near half-way: very wise, as going into 
challenges with Andorrans is like playing chicken with a steamroller.
 
Another nice goal for Portugal. Quaresma caught the keeper by surprise with a 
cheeky freekick with the outside of his right foot, and Silva fired in the 
rebound, via a nick off a defender.
 
Go on, guess to who. Yes, our heroes, Andorra. It could have been almost any 
of them, but it was Rebes.
 
Lukaku exits to loud cheers and is replaced by Benteke. 
 
A proper budgie. Lukaku collects a flipped pass from Hazard at the edge of the 
area, then holds off one defender as he turns and barges past another and curls 
a shot into the top corner with the aid of a deflection! His brother Jordan, 
who was subbed off injured earlier on, waves a crutch in the air on the 
sidelines in celebration!

78 min: Zippy interplay by Belgium - they can be so fine when they play with 
speed. Hazard and Mertens combine with each other - using Lukaku as a wall as 
they go - but Hazard fails to crown the move with a goal, curling over from 18 
yards.
 
I didn’t see the goal because I was watching more top-level fouling, Lulic 
getting booked for booting the back of Hazard’s calf as the Chelsea player 
embarked on a trademark skedaddle towards the box.
 
Gameiro is replaced by Gignac, having made his point and, surely, confirmed 
himself as France’s top predator, what with Karim Benzema still in exile.
 
The Faroes almost have victory wrapped up like mummies. 
 
Blimey, goals don’t have go to Switzerland’s head: for the second time in the 
game they concede straight after taking the lead, again to Szalai.
 
The Swiss are back in front in Budapest thanks to a lovely finish by Rodriguez 
from a cross by Behrami.
 
The defender fires into the net from close range after a good delivery by 
Mertens following a corner. Thierry Henry must be proud.

Greizman is the creator, Gameiro the deadly finisher. That’s a format that 
risks doing a lot of damage for a good while yet.
 Kevin Gameiro beats Bulgaria’s Zhivko Milanov to the ball and slots in the 
fourth. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images  
Another goal for Ronaldo -his fourth of the game - and another exquisite 
finish. Fonte headed the ball towards the near post after reaching a long cross 
from the other side, and Ronaldo swivels and catches it beautifully on the 
bounce to wallop a low shot into the net from eight yards. Guess there was no 
question of him coming off when there were more goals up fro grabs.
 
The deadlock is broken in Luxembourg, as the Lustig drives into the net 
following a corner from Berg. Can the Swedes withstand the onslaught that is 
sure to come their way now?
 
The Tottenham striker finally gets his goal, courtesy of a blast from outside 
the box.
 
Apparently Andorra have committed 15 fouls so far against Portugal. Thats the 
problem with statistics: they say nothing aboutquality - Andorra have been 
ludicrously wild in their tackling. Oh, and just as I was writing that they got 
their first red card of the evening, Rubio being ordered off for sweeping 
Ronaldo off his feet with an absurd late swipe. I’ll be concentrating mostly on 
this game from here on in, its very much one for the purists. Textbook 
recklessness from the visitors.

 
After putting up valiant resistance in the first half, Gibraltar are trailin’ 
in Tallinn.
 
Klaasen converts the rebound after a shot by Janssen came back off a post. 
That complicates the Belarussian revival that began early in the second half 
when Rios pulled a goal back for the visitors.
 
OK, that last entry may have been premature. Hungary have drawn level 
quick-sharp with a close-range tap-in. Which is not to be confused with a 
50-yard tap-in, obviously.
 
Switzerland are on their way to maximum points from two matches. They are on 
course to finish above the European champions and the continent’s new rising 
force, the Faroe Islands.

Payet, who’s really sparkling now for France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, fires over a wicked cross. 
Koscielny leaps high and twists his neck to get a good header on it, but it 
drops just wide.
 
Pjanic cops an elbow in the face from Vertonghen, plus a knee in the back, as 
the pair challenge for a high ball. Not a foul, just impressive flexibility and 
reach from the Belgian.

Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images  
Ronaldo sweeps the ball into the net from 12 yards to complete his hat-trick 
and perhaps also his match: no point in him hanging around now, not with so 
many Andorran bogeymen about.
 
With the exception of Andorra, its a good night for the minnows so far. Faroe 
Islands are leading 1-0 in Latvia. Gibraltar are drawing 0-0 in Estonia. And 
Sweden are bravely holding out for 0-0 away to Luxembourg. Here are all the 
scores so far:

Group A

France 3-1 Bulgaria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bulgaria>

Holland 2-0 Belarus

Luxembourg 0-0 Sweden

Group B

Hungary 0-0 Switzerland

Portugal 3-0 Andorra

Latvia 0-1 Faroe Islands 

Group H:

Estonia 0-0 Gibraltar

Belgium 2-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

Greece 2-0 Cyprus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cyprus>

Welcome to Hellas. 
 
That’s an unbelievable goal! The young fullback dashes to the byline and tries 
to flash the ball across the face of goal - but it takes a bobble, hits him on 
the shin and flies into the net past a bewildered keeper from a ridiculous 
angle! That’s some kind of cosmic punishment for the minnows’ carefree hacking.
 
Gah! I was so entranced by Andorra’s spectacular brutality that I missed the 
goal that puts France almost beyondBulgaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bulgaria>. Let’s say he kungfu-kicked it 
into the net as a kind of tribute to Andorra.
 
Andorra’s tackling is outrageous. There’s a thin line between admirable 
determination and vicious recklessness - and Andorra drive a tank through it. 
No way this match is going to end without a red card or two: only question is 
whether the first one goes to an Andorran fouler or a Portugal player who 
retaliates.
 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> are in le groove now. 
Gameiro plays in the Sidibé with an extravagant backheeled pass. The fullback 
collects the ball and then goes down in the box under a challenge by Milanov. 
The ref is unmoved.
 
The Spartak Moscow winger nabs his second goal of the game - and the second 
international goal of his young career. The Oranje are on a roll.

A contest that was extremely closed suddenly looks over. Bosnia have 
collapsed, and they were punished by a lovely finish by Hazard, who feinted his 
way past Begovic before tapping into the net from close range.
 Eden Hazard doubles the Belgium lead. Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images  
The defender deflects the ball into his own net.
 
The Faroes are on course to go top of their group - ahead of the European 
champions! - if scores stay the same.
 
Sagna’s eventful night has come to a premature end: he’s hobbled off to be 
replaced by Sidibé.
 
Payet curls in a cross from the right ... Griezman tries to get his head to it 
but misses ... and the ball bounces into the corner of the net!
 
Sagna makes up for conceding the penalty by swinging in a beautiful cross from 
the right It’s exactly the sort of service that Gameiro thrives off, and the 
striker proves the point by diving to send a header into the net.

France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> are making few inroads 
into the extremely diligent Bulgarian defence. But Griezmann has started to 
conjure space but is quickly closed down whenever he does. Pogba and Payet have 
yet to come to the party.
 
Holland are on the verge of their first competitive victory! Wake up your 
neighbours! Quincy Promes was the scorer, with his first for his country.

Pogba sidesteps an opponent in midfield and decides to have a bang for the top 
corner from 35 yards. The ball leaves his left foot at a 45 degree angle and 
nearly hits the corner flag.
 
The former Fulham flop puts his country in front by spanking the ball into net 
from a cross by Fortounis.
 
Bulgaria’s speed and sharpness on the counter-attack are causing France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> lots of bother, as is the 
visitors’ defending. Interesting game afoot here.
 
A superb block by Pirgov thwarts Gameiro, who seemed odds-on to equalise from 
eight yards until the defender threw himself in front of the shot.

In the time it took to have a scan at the scores elsewhere, Ronaldo scored two 
goals. His hat-trick will be along any minute now, surely ...

A perfect penalty: hard, low and into the net off the post! Lloris had no 
chance ... and the spirit of Emil Kostadinov is a alive and well and living in 
Paris!
 
Sagna is beaten by Milanov and then stupidly tugs him down - clear penalty!

Tessier/Reuters  
A lively start to the game in Brussels, where both sides have shown their 
attacking intent in the opening minutes and events are proceeding at a nice 
clip - and both are looking defensively frail, with Jordan Lukaku already 
making a mistake at the back for Belgium. No shots yet, mind.
 
We have liftoff! All matches are now underway. Let’s have a friendly bet as to 
which match will get the first goal. I’m saying Portugal v Andorra. If I’m 
right, you all have to down a pint immediately. If I’m wrong, I have to. So, 
er, come onFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france>, Gibraltar, 
Switzerland, Hungary et al!
 
As the Belgian and Bosnian players exchange pre-match handslaps, Thibaut 
Courtois and Asmir Begovic resist any temptation to put in extra force in an 
attempt to secure the Chelsea No1 spot. The ref in this game - for those of you 
seeking another English angle - is Martin Atkinson.
 
A chunk of the crowd at the Stade de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> is booing the Bulgarian national 
anthem. Obviously they can hold a grudge even longer than Gérard Houllier and 
David Ginola.

Hi. If you’re reading this, then you’re probably not one of those people who 
regards international football as a damnable nuisance that gets in the way of 
club action. Or maybe you are, and you’re tuning in just to find out whether 
your favourite player is going to survive today’s fixture list and return to 
your favourite club intact – if that’s the case, then be advised that I’ll be 
sure to let you know if Alfreton Town’s Adam Priestly pulls up with a calf 
strain while on duty forGibraltar in Estonia today. Otherwise, let’s all look 
forward to some intriguing matches, including:


 * A first competitive meeting between Greece and Cyprus for nearly 30 years. 
 * Roberto Martinez’s biggest test so far as Belgium manager, as he and 
Thierry Henry try to rouse an injury-ravaged side to victory over
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who began their campaign last month by marmalising Estonia. 
Beware of the backlash, Gibraltar! 
 * Portugal’s inevitable victory over Andorra, and Switzerland’s attempt to 
stay ahead of the European champions by winning away inHungary, who have ground 
to make up and respect to regain after drawing 0-0 with the Faroe Islands last 
month. 
 * Holland began restoring their own damaged dignity by drawing 1-1 in Sweden 
last month but still have a long way to go to convince anyone that the country 
of Cruyff, Van Basten and Kromkamp is back as a footballing force. A home win 
overBelarus today may seem like flimsy evidence but no case could be built 
without it given that Group A is among the toughest ones in Europe, with 
Holland and Sweden accompanied by France and Bulgaria France. Which bring us on 
to … 
 * France’s latest attempt to reassert the quality that Didier Deschamps has 
not yet managed to bring out, andBulgaria’s attempt to channel the spirit of 
Emil Kostadinov, the man who put the ‘oh là là là là là là là là là là” and “
aïe, aïe, aïe!” into “spectacular last minute winner”. Here, a thing of beauty 
is a joy forever:
oh là là là là là là là là là là ... aïe, aïe, aïe! 
Here’s the full list of matches we’ll be following:

 * Belgium v Bos-Herz 
 * Estoniav Gibraltar 
 * France v Bulgaria 
 * Greece v Cyprus 
 * Hungaryv Switzerlnd 
 * Latvia v Faroe Isl 
 * Luxembourg v Sweden 
 * Holland v Belarus 
 * 

 * 

 * One notable result from earlier in the day was a fine draw for the Cranes 
of Uganda in Tamale:Ghana 0-0 Uganda 
 * 

 *
