Six men, including at least three Crewe players, have been arrested in 
connection with an alleged sexual assault.

The League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> club 
had been on a pre-season training camp in Cornwall when the alleged incident 
took place in Redruth.

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman confirmed the arrests. "At 4.30am [on 
Saturday] police in Redruth received a complaint of a sexual assault against a 
woman aged in her early 20s," he said. "The incident is alleged to have 
occurred at a property in Redruth. As a result of inquiries five men aged 35, 
19, 18 and two aged 24 were arrested in connection with the incident. They 
remain in custody centres in Camborne and Newquay.

"Earlier this evening a sixth man was arrested in Cheshire, aged 21 years. He 
will be taken back to Cornwall where he will be formally interviewed."

A spokesman for the club confirmed that Crewe players were being held. "I can 
confirm some players have been arrested. From what we know there are three 
arrested and two helping with inquiries over an alleged sexual assault. The 
details are a bit sketchy so we can't really comment at the moment," he said.
