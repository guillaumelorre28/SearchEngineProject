The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 

I would say Bill Burr. He’s incredibly funny. I’m usually a really bad 
audience member when I watch standup as I start daydreaming, but with him I’m 
completely hooked the whole way through.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 

Chappelle’s Show’s Rick James sketch is a classic. That whole series is full 
of great ones.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen 

Da Ali G Show. I’m talking food falling out of my mouth, not being able to eat 
my dinner funny.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen 

The Naked Gun because it’s the first comedy I ever recall seeing. I watched it 
again not long ago and found that my judgment had been pretty accurate back in 
the day. It’s still super funny, and Leslie Nielsen was such a good clown.

The funniest person I know 

My friends back home in Norway are hilarious. They have a great sense of 
humour.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 

I would say a bow tie. It’s a strange piece of clothing and I always feel out 
of my comfort zone when I have to wear it.

The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten 

Once when I was super drunk I fell asleep in bed with a slice of pizza in my 
mouth. I woke up eight hours later with the TV on loud and the whole slice 
still in my mouth. It was nice as it meant that breakfast was already ready!

The funniest dream I’ve ever had 

The other day I dreamed I was in a jungle and all the animals were wearing 
boxer shorts. I don’t know why I seem more comfortable with animals wearing 
underwear in my dreams.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny 

The names of German sausages.

The funniest word 

Jagdwurst – it’s a type of German sausage
