A great victory for Atlético, and a deserved one. They defended superbly, and 
their margin of victory might have been bigger had Antoine Griezmann not missed 
that late penalty. Bayern had most of the ball but struggled to create clear 
chances, although Lewandowski missed a late header when he got free from Savic. 
Good game, good football, good times. Thanks for reading. Bye!

86 min Vidal is booked for that late tackle on Saul, but Atleti can’t make the

78 min Oh, what a chance! Lewandowski. Alonso whipped a cross in, Lewandowski 
got free, about 10 yards out, but headed just wide! Should have hit the target. 
Big chance!

76 min Ribery wins a corner off Savic. Poor clearance from Koke, and Ribery 
with a chance to shoot … it’s deflected over. And then Bayern totally waste the 
subsequent corner by taking it short.

75 min Great play from Torres, who went round Hummels and stood it up at the 
back post, but Griezmann didn’t quite have the inches, and it’s behind for a 
goal kick.
 Atlético’s Antoine Griezmann beats Bayern’s Javi Martinez to the header.

63 min Still no way through for Bayern.

Here’s Matjaz Hribar with some extremely useful information: “I would say 
Slovene. It is approximately like Briton, Slovenian like British. But then 
again, in daily communication, Slovenian is used a lot instead of Slovene. Bad 
English or our love for adjectives? I hope this helps you.

“Btw, Oblak written means cloud in English. For pronunciation, just the accent 
is changed: Óblak vs Oblák (cloud).”

Thanks Matjaz!

61 min Still Bayern are finding it difficult to penetrate. There’s just no 
space for them in the final third. So Arjen Robben is summoned from the bench, 
and he’ll replace Thomas Müller, who’s been quiet.

54 min Atlético have so many players back whenever Bayern break. They’re 
extremely adept at denying the opposition space, aren’t they?

52 min It’s been a good start to the second half from Bayern: they’ve pushed 
Atleti right back into their own territory. Bayern’s back four are right on 
halfway. But that’s a waste from Xabi Alonso, and it’s behind for a goal kick.

49 min Gabi fouls Thiago, and Xabi Alonso’s free kick is headed behind by 
Savic for a corner. And Müller heads wide! He was totally free at the back 
post, but the angle was tight, and he didn’t quite get the connection. Oblak 
probably had it covered, in any case.

Half-time: Atlético Madrid 1-0 Bayern Munich

An entertaining first half, and Atleti lead. They’ve been defensive, and 
cautious, but Carrasco scored an excellent goal, and Fernando Torres should 
have had another, but inexplicably headed against the post from three yards 
out. Bayern have enjoyed most of the ball, and are gorgeous in possession, but 
have been throttled by Atlético’s stout defence. Lots to look forward to in the 
second half; see you in 15.

A great victory for Atlético, and a deserved one. They defended superbly, and 
their margin of victory might have been bigger had Antoine Griezmann not missed 
that late penalty. Bayern had most of the ball but struggled to create clear 
chances, although Lewandowski missed a late header when he got free from Savic. 
Good game, good football, good times. Thanks for reading. Bye!

That’s it!
 
90 min +4 Neuer is in the centre circle. Ribery is dispossessed on the edge of 
the box, and Atleti bring it clear.
 
90 min +2 Thomas Partey replaces Griezmann as Atleti look to run down the 
clock.
 
90 min +1 Gameiro shoots into the side netting. Five minutes of added time!
 
90 min Gaitan is tripped, and Bayern are frustrated. We’re into stoppage time, 
and Atleti force a corner.
 
88 min Robben looks to dribble, but Atleti have men back, and they clear the 
danger.
 
86 min Vidal is booked for that late tackle on Saul, but Atleti can’t make the 
subsequent free kick count.
 
85 min Just back to the penalty: Griezmann feinted slightly, Neuer stayed up, 
and Griezmann just smacked it against the crossbar. Not dissimilar at all from 
the one in last year’s final.
 
84 min Now Vidal and Saul are down after a nasty clash on the edge of the box, 
so we’ll take a break.
 
Off the bar! Amazing.

Vidal on Filipe Luis! Reckless, and Szymon Marciniak didn’t hesitate.
 
81 min Robben from the edge of the box! It’s just wide. He hit it with curl, 
on his left foot, but a yard the wrong side of the post.
 Arjen Robben rues his missed chance. Photograph: Paul Hanna/Reuters  
79 min Nico Gaitan is on for Fernando Torres.
 
78 min Oh, what a chance! Lewandowski. Alonso whipped a cross in, Lewandowski 
got free, about 10 yards out, but headed just wide! Should have hit the target. 
Big chance!
 
76 min Ribery wins a corner off Savic. Poor clearance from Koke, and Ribery 
with a chance to shoot … it’s deflected over. And then Bayern totally waste the 
subsequent corner by taking it short.
 
75 min Great play from Torres, who went round Hummels and stood it up at the 
back post, but Griezmann didn’t quite have the inches, and it’s behind for a 
goal kick.
 Atlético’s Antoine Griezmann beats Bayern’s Javi Martinez to the header.

72 min Joshua Kimmich is on for Thiago, incidentally.
 
70 min Kevin Gameiro replaces the goalscorer, who’s given many cheers by the 
home fans.
 
69 min Robben hasn’t had the chance to run at Filipe Luis yet. Carrasco has 
done really well to double up on that flank.
 
66 min Carrasco has a pop from distance, and Neuer does well to get down and 
parry.
 
63 min Still no way through for Bayern.

Here’s Matjaz Hribar with some extremely useful information: “I would say 
Slovene. It is approximately like Briton, Slovenian like British. But then 
again, in daily communication, Slovenian is used a lot instead of Slovene. Bad 
English or our love for adjectives? I hope this helps you.

“Btw, Oblak written means cloud in English. For pronunciation, just the accent 
is changed: Óblak vs Oblák (cloud).”

Thanks Matjaz!
 
62 min And now Mats Hummels is on for Jerome Boateng, who hasn’t looked fit.
 
61 min Still Bayern are finding it difficult to penetrate. There’s just no 
space for them in the final third. So Arjen Robben is summoned from the bench, 
and he’ll replace Thomas Müller, who’s been quiet.
 
59 min Thiago, who’s already been booked, is late on Carrasco. Careful now!
 
58 min Juanfran skates into the area and wins a corner off Boateng. 
Lewandowski wanted a penalty moments earlier after Savic came in from behind. 
I’ve seen them given!
 
56 min Alaba shoots, and Oblak, taking no chances, pushes it behind for 
corner. He might have held that, but Atleti do enough to hustle the ball clear.
 
54 min Atlético have so many players back whenever Bayern break. They’re 
extremely adept at denying the opposition space, aren’t they?

Niguez. Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images  
52 min It’s been a good start to the second half from Bayern: they’ve pushed 
Atleti right back into their own territory. Bayern’s back four are right on 
halfway. But that’s a waste from Xabi Alonso, and it’s behind for a goal kick.
 
49 min Gabi fouls Thiago, and Xabi Alonso’s free kick is headed behind by 
Savic for a corner. And Müller heads wide! He was totally free at the back 
post, but the angle was tight, and he didn’t quite get the connection. Oblak 
probably had it covered, in any case.
 
48 min Incidentally, Celtic have just gone 3-2 up against Man City! Absurd. 
Probably a half-decent atmosphere at Parkhead.

47 min Teasing ball in from the left side from Koke, but no one attacked it, 
and it’s all the way through to Manuel Neuer.
 
46 min We’re back! And no changes from either side.
 
An entertaining first half, and Atleti lead. They’ve been defensive, and 
cautious, but Carrasco scored an excellent goal, and Fernando Torres should 
have had another, but inexplicably headed against the post from three yards 
out. Bayern have enjoyed most of the ball, and are gorgeous in possession, but 
have been throttled by Atlético’s stout defence. Lots to look forward to in the 
second half; see you in 15.
 
45 min Good defending from Javi Martinez to ease Carrsaco off it and win the 
goal kick. Carrasco looks full of running, though.
 
43 min Alaba crosses, Juanfran sticks out a leg, Lewandowksi lunges, and Oblak 
collects. It’s not quite running right for Bayern.
 
41 min Gabi’s ball in is delicious, but Godin is called for push.
 
40 min Boateng went in very hard on Saul, and is booked. He took the ball, but 
he was off his feet, and caught Saul on the follow-through. Bayern’s third
