It was an unusual burglary, in which four or five laptops were stolen from a 
Scottish renewable energy manufacturer in the dead of a March night in 2011. So 
innovative was the company that it had been been visited by a 60-strong 
delegation led by China’s then vice-premier only two months before.

Nothing else was taken from the company and the crime, while irritating, went 
unsolved and forgotten – until a few years later pictures began emerging that 
showed a remarkably similar project manufactured in the world’s most populous 
country.

Then some people who were involved in the Scottish company, Pelamis Wave 
Power, started making a connection between the break-in and the politician’s 
visit, which was rounded off with dinner and whisky tasting at Edinburgh Castle 
hosted by the then Scottish secretary, Michael Moore.

Max Carcas, who was business development director at Pelamis until 2012, said 
the similarities between the Scottish and Chinese products were striking. 
Speaking publicly for the first time, he said: “Some of the details may be 
different but they are clearly testing a Pelamis concept.”

 The Chinese device. 
It might be that China’s engineers had been working along roughly the same 
lines as the UK engineers. Or it may be thatChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> attempted to replicate the design 
based on pictures of the Pelamis project freely available on the web.

Or there could be a darker explanation: that Pelamis was targeted by China, 
which has been repeatedly accused of pursuing an aggressive industrial 
espionage strategy. The answer matters, given security concerns raised by the 
government’s award of the Hinkley Point nuclear contract to China.

“It was a tremendous feather in our cap to be the only place in the UK outside 
of London that the Chinese vice-premier visited,” Carcas said. “We did have a 
break-in about 10 weeks after, when a number of laptops were stolen. It was 
curious that whoever broke in went straight to our office on the second floor 
rather than the other company on the first floor or the ground floor.”


Carcas, who is now managing director of the renewable energy consultancy 
Caelulum, added: “I could infer all sorts of things but I do not want to say.”

Ironically, Pelamis is now defunct but the Chinese product, Hailong (Dragon) 
1, still appears to be under development.

Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> has been at the forefront 
of the development of wave technology for decades. Pelamis was one of the 
cutting-edge companies, originally named the Ocean Power Delivery company when 
founded in 1998 and renamed Pelamis Wave Power in 2007.

The company, which employed a staff of 50, developed a giant energy wave 
machine, which it named Pelamis. It looked like a metal snake, facing directly 
into the waves, harnessing the power of the sea. It had a unique hinged joint 
system that helped regulate energy flow as waves ran down its length.

 Other revolutionary features included a sophisticated control system and a 
quick mechanism for releasing it into the sea and recovering it. In 2004, it 
became the first wave-energy machine to generate electricity into the grid.

China expressed interest in December 2010 in an email to Pelamis: “It is 
decided that His Excellency, Mr Li Keqiang, vice-premier of the state council 
of China, and the delegation (60 people) headed by him will pay a visit to the 
Pelamis SeaEnergy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Converter 
between 16.40 and 17.00 on Sunday 9 January.”

 Li, who is now premier of China, was accompanied by other senior Chinese 
government officials and was shown round the key stages in the construction of 
Pelamis at the site in Leith, Edinburgh.

Moore was his host for the visit and recalled the Chinese had been very 
impressed. Asked about the coincidence of the visit, the break-in and emergence 
of a similar Chinese project, Moore said: “I am afraid I am not going to 
speculate. It is intriguing.”


The day was rounded off with the dinner at the castle. A Scottish government 
memo setting out the itinerary said: “Evening dinner at castle with whisky 
tasting, Scottish dancing, crown jewels.”


Any faint hopes that the Chinese might invest in the Pelamis project proved 
fruitless however. Three years later, in November 2014, Pelamis went into 
administration, having run out of funding after 17 years developing the project 
at a cost of £95m.

Two months after the Chinese visit, on the night of Monday 22 March 2011, the 
Pelamis office was broken into. The burglar – or burglars – managed to get 
through a perimeter fence and then the front door. They skipped the first-floor 
office of the German engineering giant Siemens and continued to Pelamis on the 
second floor.

Police Scotland, in a statement confirming the break-in, said no one had ever 
been caught. “Entry was forced to a business premises on Bath Road in Edinburgh 
between 11pm 21 March and 6.45 am on 22 March 2011,” the police said.


 “A number of laptops, collectively worth a four-figure sum, were stolen from 
within. Officers conducted extensive inquiries at the time and any new 
information received will be thoroughly investigated.”

Break-ins at dockyards are not unusual. Pelamis had suffered before when 
copper cables were stolen from its site. But theft of laptops from its office 
was a first.


The pictures from China, show that the product, as well as looking roughly the 
same, also seems to have specific features such as a similar-looking hinged 
joint system and a similar system for placing in and recovering the project 
from the sea. Tests on the Hailong 1 were carried out in in 2014 and again in 
2015 but on both occasions the tests had to be suspended because of rough seas.

 The Chinese wave-power device in the sea. 
The Hailong 1 appears to have been built at the No 710 Research Institute, 
part of the Chinese Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, a commercial operation. 
The institute is also involved in developing military projects.


The Guardian sent a series of questions to the Chinese government asking for 
details about the origins of the Hailong 1 project but has had no reply. There 
is no suggestion that the Chinese premier is connected with the company or that 
he knows anything about the burglary.


Despite the similarities, neither the UK nor Scottish governments has any 
plans to challenge China over the patent. Calum Macfarlane, a spokesman for 
Wave Energy Scotland, said: “The IP [intellectual property] is not protected in 
China.”


Carn Gibson, who spent 15 years at Pelamis, where he was engineering manager, 
is disappointed that funding for the Pelamis project could not be found in the 
UK and appeared sanguine about the Chinese design.

Gibson, who is now senior consulting engineer at Quoceant, a new company that 
grew out of Pelamis, said he regarded it as a compliment that the Chinese may 
have thought it was an idea worth copying, especially if they were able to turn 
it into a viable commercial proposition. He was rueful though that it was being 
developed in the South China Sea rather than the Atlantic.
