Craig Clay came within inches of firing Grimsby into the FA Cup third round as 
League OneShrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> were 
held at Blundell Park in a 0-0 stalemate.

The midfielder’s late effort for non-League Grimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby>, with the outside of his right 
foot from the edge of the box, flew agonisingly wide in the dying moments as a 
largely second-best Shrewsbury held on to book a replay back at the Greenhous 
Meadow.

The home fans were on their feet in anticipation and it would have been what 
the National League hosts deserved after an impressive performance.

Grimsby raced out of the blocks and Jon-Paul Pittman forced a fine save by 
Jayson Leutwiler on 19 minutes. And they almost broke the deadlock again just 
shy of the half-hour point. Pittman’s through-ball was smashed against the bar 
by his strike partner, Padraig Amond.

Paul Hurst’s side continued to press after the break and they struck the 
woodwork again after 62 minutes when Conor Townsend’s deep cross dropped on to 
the bar. Scott Vernon should then have fired Shrewsbury into the lead moments 
later after racing clear but James McKeown bravely denied him.

Grimsby created a host of fine chances late on but were forced to settle for a 
replay,with a visit to the Championship side Cardiff City the eventual prize 
for progressing into the third round
