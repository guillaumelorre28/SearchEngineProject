Bury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bury>, League One's bottom club, 
have issued a desperate plea for investment as the club tries to raise £1m to 
avoid going out of business.

The Shakers are currently under a transfer embargo imposed by the Football 
League after accepting a loan from the Professional Footballers' Association.

They have now taken the unusual step of releasing a boardroom statement 
<http://www.buryfc.co.uk/news/article/bury-fc-statement-764293.aspx> revealing 
the extent of their financial problems and asking for external help.

The statement read: "At this moment in time the situation is now critical, we 
are quickly running out of money by trying short-term fixes that are not 
working long-term. Without this investment the club will cease to trade and 
there will be no more professional football played at Gigg Lane.

"We are looking for a number of people, local businessmen or women to join a 
consortium and invest £100,000 each, with a guaranteed payback.

"We have a responsibility to all of our staff, players and creditors to not 
allow the situation to get any worse."
