Elche have been relegated from La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> because of unpaid debts 
to the tax authorities and Eibar will take their place in Spain’s top flight 
next season.

Elche, who ended the season in 13th place, were punished for “very serious 
infractions” of Spain’s sports law and league rules and also fined just over 
€180,000 (£132,000).

Based near Alicante in south-east Spain, Elche have already said they would 
appeal if they were relegated over their tax debts, which they have insisted 
are due to be settled in full by the end of July.

The Basque club Eibar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eibar> were 
playing in La Liga for the first time in 2014-15 and went down on the final day 
of the season after finishing 18th.
