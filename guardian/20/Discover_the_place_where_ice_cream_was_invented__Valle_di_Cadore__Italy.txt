When you think Italy, you think football, pasta, ice-cream. It was winter and 
I was in northern Italy, feeling a bit lonely. I had the number of an Italian 
ice-cream maker, so I gave him a call. He picked me up at Dobbiaco, in theSouth 
Tirol region <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/dolomites>, and we drove 
through the snow to a valley just over the border in Veneto. With an expansive 
gesture he proclaimed: “Here, do the ice-cream makers live.” It sounded so 
mythical I thought there had to be a novel in it.

My novel is about an ice-cream maker from Italy who has a shop in Rotterdam, 
where I live.It’s based on the tradition of Italian ice-cream makers travelling 
abroad to their ice-cream parlours at the end of spring and returning to Italy 
at the end of autumn. This migration is made by a lot of ice-cream makers, to 
and from cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Germany.

Half of the inhabitants in Valle di Cadore are ice-cream makers or work in a 
gelateria. There are six or seven tiny villages in the valley, and in winter 
everyone’s there; but in spring and summer its empty: the pizzeria opens only 
at weekends and there’s no queue at the butcher’s.

In the village of Pieve di Cadore is the house where Titian, the Renaissance 
painter, was born and lived until he was 12. After that, he went to Venice to 
start painting.

Several very old men in the valley told me their great grandfathers invented 
ice-cream. Before refrigerators, you needed ice or snow to make ice-cream, and 
there are a lot of high mountains around there. I did a beautiful trip with two 
ice-cream makers to the Tre Cime di Lavaredo: there are no mountains in Europe 
more photogenic than these three Dolomite peaks. Elizabeth David’s bookHarvest 
of the Cold Months tells how people collected ice and snow high in the 
mountains and brought it down to the cities where they added sugar and fruit.

Some people think the Chinese invented ice-cream. Marco Polo is said to have 
brought recipes to Europe from China. But obviously Italians disagree – very 
strongly. Italian ice-cream is different from other ice-creams around the 
world. I went to the Mostra Internazionale del Gelato in Belluno, and you could 
really taste the difference. Americans like ice-cream really tight, with no air 
in it; in real Italian ice-cream, there is a lot of air to make it smooth. 
Australians like it with a bite or a crunch – from roasted almonds or caramel, 
say.

I think I’ve tasted 64 flavours of ice-cream and spat out three. I’ve tried 
ice-cream of everything – blood, bread, cooked ham… You can make ice-cream from 
anything. I tried one made from an energy drink, which was really green. In my 
novel, the eldest brother makes a vanilla that’s as smooth and firm “as the 
behind of Sophia Loren”. That’s the ultimate gelato – soft and steady at the 
same time.

Gelateria Avalon, in Bolzano, calls itself an officina del gelo, because it’s 
really a laboratory where they make new tastes. And in Ragusa, Sicily, there’s 
a parlour called Gelati Divini, where I tasted olive oil and ricotta ice-cream.

 Gelati DiVini, Ragusa, Sicily 
I thought being an ice-cream maker must be the best job in the world. I’m less 
romantic about it now. Everyone goes for ice-cream in summer, but they don’t 
know the story of the people who make it, sometimes for 17 hours a day. It’s 
hard, and there are people who didn’t want to go into ice-cream making but had 
to because of this family tradition. This is what the novel is about.
