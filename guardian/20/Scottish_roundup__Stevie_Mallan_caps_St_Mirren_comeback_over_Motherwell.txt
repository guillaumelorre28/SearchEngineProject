unleashed his stoppage-time winner to hand interim St Mirren manager Gary Teale 
his third win in the last four games. Motherwell finished the game with 10 men 
after striker Scott McDonald was sent off for elbowing Buddies youngster Thomas 
Reilly and he now faces a three-match ban which will rule him out of the 
play-off final later this month.
