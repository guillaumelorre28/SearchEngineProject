Dear subscribers

Some of you may have noticed that today's online version of the quick 
crossword is not the same as that printed in the paper. Wednesday's Quick 
crossword No 11855 was mistakenly uploaded onto the site today. Our apologies. 
We will publish Quick crossword No 11854 on the site on Wednesday.

We would also like to take this opportunity to explain the problem encountered 
by subscribers wishing to complete the Genius crossword on Monday morning. The 
clue for 1 down did not show up due to technical issues and this issue has now 
been resolved. Thank you for your patience.

Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience these issues have 
caused you.
