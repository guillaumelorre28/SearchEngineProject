After a period of review, it is with great regret that we have to say goodbye 
to the Guardian Unlimited talkboards. We are unable to continue to support this 
separate platform.

Community is a vital part of our service at theguardian.com and we hope to be 
able to introduce forums on that platform in the coming months.

It's been more than a decade -- you all practically invented social 
networking. Thank you for all your contributions.

We hope you'll be able to use the comment thread underneath this blog post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2011/feb/28/guardian-unlimited-talkboards>
 to find each other and regroup.
