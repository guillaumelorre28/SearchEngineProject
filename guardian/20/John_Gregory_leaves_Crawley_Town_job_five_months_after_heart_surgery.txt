John Gregory has left Crawley Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/crawley-town>, the club has confirmed. 
The former Aston Villa manager has not taken charge of the Reds in 2015 having 
stepped down from his position to undergo major open heart surgery in December.

The interim manager, Dean Saunders, failed to keep Crawley in League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> and they were 
relegated on the final day, and on Saturday morning an official club statement 
revealed they have reached an agreement with 60-year-old Gregory, who will now 
leave with immediate effect.

“Thankfully, John is now on the road to a full recovery and the board of 
directors would like to place on record their sincere thanks to John for his 
efforts during his time in charge and his continued support of the club during 
his recent illness,” it read. “He will always be a welcome visitor to the 
Checkatrade.com Stadium.”

Gregory added: “I would just like to take the opportunity to thank everyone at 
Crawley Town FC for their support over the last 18 months. Unfortunately I did 
not get the results on the field this season that I managed to get during the 
second half of 2013-14. Dean Saunders inherited the difficult task of trying to 
rescue our season with 24 games to go in January of this year.

“I would like to thank the board of directors, in particular, for standing by 
me and supporting me during the very difficult time I endured whilst undergoing 
open heart surgery. It was brilliant to see the stadium full for the last match 
of the season. I hope that the Crawley Town fans stand by their team and help 
to bring back the glory days again very soon.”
