Safe from relegation but unable to reach the League One play-offs, Doncaster 
Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/doncaster> may have nothing left 
to play for this season – and judging by the highlights reel of Saturday’s 
goalless draw with Fleetwood Town, it showed.

Manfully sticking to the task of producing highlights from the Keepmoat 
Stadium the club have published a full 27 seconds of best bits from the weekend.

Said best bits include kick-off, full-time and … not a lot else. Their season 
may be over but at least Doncaster have not lost their sense of humour.

 Doncaster’s goalless draw with Fleetwood last weekend will not linger long in 
the memory. 
One dismayed supporter took a unique approach to his 250-word match report, 
explaining, at length, the difficulties of watching paint dry.

“The problem with paint drying is that it’s hard to know what you are going to 
get,”wrote Jack Peat for Popular Stand 
<https://popularstand.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/doncaster-rovers-0-0-fleetwood-town-250-word-match-report/>
. “You’ve painted the fireplace wall and returned after supper to find it is 
bone dry, but take the same paint with a matt finish and apply it to the 
upstairs bathroom and all of a sudden you’re left red faced with paint all over 
your paws.”

“Dealing with this veritable mixed bag of outcomes is one of life’s great 
challenges,” he continued, before concluding: “Rovers and Fleetwood drew 0-0. I 
won’t bore you with the details.”
