“We have to keep believing it can go forward after three or four months in 
which it didn’t. Today was a step in the right direction,” said the Dortmund 
coach, Jürgen Klopp, whose team had 22 shots at goal compared to seven from the 
home side.

Dortmund had already gone close through Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and midfielder 
Shinji Kagawa before a wayward back pass from Mike Frantz gifted the ball to 
Aubameyang, who took it past the goalkeeper and gave Reus a simple tap-in.

It was the first Dortmund league goal of the year, and the visitors pushed for 
more. Aubameyang claimed his first goal with a cool finish in the 56th minute 
after Gundogan sent him through, and then sealed the win in the with 20 minutes 
left when he was set up by Kagawa.

“It was a mental problem,” Aubameyang said of Dortmund’s poor season. “The 
coach found the right words and he made the right calls. That’s how we got the 
result.”
