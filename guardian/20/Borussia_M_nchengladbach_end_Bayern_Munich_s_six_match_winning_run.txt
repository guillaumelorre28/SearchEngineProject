Bayern Munich’s six-match winning run in the Bundesliga came to an abrupt end 
as Raffael scored twice to earnBorussia Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> a 2-0 win at 
the Allianz Arena.

The league leaders fell behind in the 30th minute and found themselves two 
down in the 77th minute as the visitors strengthened their Champions League 
qualification ambitions.

The win moved Gladbach up to third place, two points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen 
and eight clear of Schalke in fifth.

There was more bad news for Bayern after the game when winger Arjen Robben was 
ruled out for several weeks with a stomach muscle tear after his comeback 
lasted a mere 24 minutes.

The Dutchman could now be a doubt for Bayern’s Champions League quarter-final 
first leg against Porto on 15 April with the club saying he would be out “for 
several weeks.”

“His injury is almost as bad as the defeat,” said Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.

The 31-year-old Holland forward had only returned to training this week after 
being sidelined for a week with a back injury sustained against Shakhtar 
Donetsk in the Champions League on 12 March.

The winger, who missed last week’s win over Werder Bremen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen> and was a surprise 
inclusion in the starting lineup on Sunday, is the league’s second-top scorer 
with 17 goals this term. Robben has also set up seven goals for Bayern, who are 
10 points clear of Wolfsburg at the top of the Bundesliga after they drew with 
Mainz on Sunday.
