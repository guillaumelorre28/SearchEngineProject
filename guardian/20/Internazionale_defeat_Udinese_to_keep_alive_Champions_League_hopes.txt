Stevan Jovetic scored twice and Internazionale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale> beat Udinese 3-1 in Serie 
A on Saturday to keep alive their hopes of catching Roma for the final 
Champions League spot.

With three matches remaining, fourth-placed Inter moved within four points of 
Roma, who host second-place Napoli on Monday.

The match at San Siro marked the first time in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> history that neither 
squad featured an Italian in their starting lineup.

Juventus, who visit Fiorentina on Sunday, can clinch a fifth straight title if 
gaining more points than Napoli in this round.

After Cyril Thereau put Udinese <https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> 
ahead with a difficult volley, Jovetic responded with goals either side of 
half-time, and Éder added the last for the hosts in added time.

Jovetic

 tapped in a short cross from Mauro Icardi for his first then used his chest to 
score his second, meeting a cross from Jonathan Biabiany that was slightly 
deflected by the Udinese goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis.

“We were able to turn the match around, which is the toughest challenge in 
football especially since we were behind already from the eighth minute,” 
Jovetic said.

It was Éder’s first goal since moving to Inter in January on loan from 
Sampdoria. A Brazilian-born Italy international, Éder is expected to play a big 
role in the Azzurri’s attack at the upcoming European Championship.

Udinese’s Bruno Fernandes hit the crossbar before Jovetic’s second, and the 
Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic preserved the lead with a tough save on Duván 
Zapata seconds before Éder scored at the other end.

Inter’s Indonesian president, Erick Thohir, attended the match with 
representatives of China’s Suning Commerce Group as he seeks new investors for 
the club.
