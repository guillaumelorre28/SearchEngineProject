“We are very pleased that three important members of our team have committed 
to us for the long term. Francis has made tremendous technical strides over the 
past few years because he’s so focused every day,” Wenger said.

“Olivier has big experience in the game now and has become a more and more 
complete player since joining us. Laurent is a key part of our squad and I 
believe one of the best defenders in the world. So overall, this is great news 
for us.”

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are also looking to 
negotiate deals with Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez. Wenger has yet to announce 
any plans regarding his contract, which expires in the summer. Özil has said he
