To celebrate Shakespeare's 450th anniversary, I've selected vintage 
productions and performances from my theatregoing lifetime. The basic criteria 
are simple. Did a production change one's perspective on the play? Did a 
particular performance brand itself on the memory? My focus is mainly, but not 
exclusively, on the British stage. But I've learned a lot from visiting foreign 
productions and, obviously, from seeing Shakespeare on film and television. My 
list, which over the next month will embrace the entire Shakespeare canon, is 
nothing if not personal. I start with a trio of popular favourites before 
tackling the plays in rough order of composition. I'm keen to know what your 
choice of great productions and performances would be.
