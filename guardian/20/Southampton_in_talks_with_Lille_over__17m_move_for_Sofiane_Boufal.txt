The 22-year-old is currently recuperating after injuring a knee in May and is 
not expected to play again until the middle of next month. However, that has 
not stopped Southampton from firming up their interest, with the manager Claude 
Puel understood to have pushed for the signing after watching Boufal in action 
last season.

Talks began this week, with Southampton initially having a €15m bid rejected. 
But a source close to the player has indicated that there is a confidence 
between both parties that a deal can be agreed, withLille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> holding out for a fee worth an 
initial €20m and €5m in potential future bonuses.

Boufal won the award for Best African Player in Ligue 1 and a product of the 
youth system at Angers, he is comfortable out wide or as a No10. Born in Paris, 
he opted to represent Morocco – for whom he qualifies through his parents – 
this year and made his debut against Cape Verde in March.
