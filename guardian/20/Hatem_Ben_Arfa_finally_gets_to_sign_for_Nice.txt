Nice <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> have finally got their man 
after announcing their first signing of the summer in Hatem Ben Arfa.

The 28-year-old France winger joined the Ligue 1 club in January, a day after 
he was released from his contract with Newcastle United but could not play for

.

Ben Arfa was on a season-long loan at Hull starting in September 2014 before 
he joined up with Nice four months later, but Fifa ruled the France 
international could not play any part for the French side as he had already 
been involved with a maximum two teams that term – playing in a reserves match 
for Newcastle and for the first team at the Tigers.

Fifa regulations state: “Players may be registered with a maximum of three 
clubs during one season. During this period, the player is only eligible to 
play official matches for two clubs.”

Nice have now completed the arrival of the player for a second time and their 
chairman Jean-Pierre Rivère was delighted to reveal their first summer signing.

He told the club’s official website ogcnice.com 
<http://www.ogcnice.com/fr/actualite/24024/le-mercato-souvre-avec-ben-arfa>: 
“It’s a gamble for us and for him. He is not expected [to lead us] as a messiah 
but as an element that will integrate into our squad.

“After a period without playing, it will be complicated for him. But he has 
great talent, and we will do everything so he can express [himself and feel at] 
home.”

The Nice coach Claude Puel has also reached an agreement to bring the Ivory 
Coast midfielder Jean Seri to the Allianz Riviera from Portuguese side Paços 
Ferreira.

The 23-year-old has made 51 Primeira Liga appearances since moving to the club 
in August 2013. It is understood that Nice have agreed a provisional four-year 
contract for Seri.
