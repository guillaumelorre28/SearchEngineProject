Ten-man Paris St Germain got the defence of their Ligue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> title off to a good start 
on Friday when Lucas’s second-half strike earned them a 1-0 win at Lille.

The champions had their midfielder Adrien Rabiot sent off in the 28th minute 
for two bookings but Lucas, the Brazilian, secured three points with a goal 
just before the hour.

PSG were without the injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic but they still looked 
a cut above their opponents in the season curtain-raiser at the Pierre Mauroy 
stadium in northern France. They were at times shaken byLille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> but their defence held firm and 
they needed only one clear chance to take advantage despite going down to 10 
men.

PSG, with their recruit from Manchester United, Angel Di Maria, watching from 
the stands, dominated the early exchanges and Edinson Cavani, operating as a 
lone striker, was guilty of missing a clear chance in the 26th minute.

It was Lille who had the first shot on target when Benjamin Corchia’s 
long-range shot was blocked by Kevin Trapp, though that was as close as the 
hosts came to scoring.

PSG looked more comfortable in midfield after Blanc brought on the experienced 
Thiago Motta for Javier Pastore at half-time. They clearly had the upper hand 
and in the 57th minute Lucas controlled Blaise Matuidi’s defence-splitting pass 
and rounded Vincent Enyeama before tucking the ball into the net.

Last year’s runners-up, Olympique Lyonnais, start their campaign on Sunday at 
home against Lorient.
