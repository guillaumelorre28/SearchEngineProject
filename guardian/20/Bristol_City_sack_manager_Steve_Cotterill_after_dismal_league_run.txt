Bristol City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> have sacked 
their manager Steve Cotterill after a miserable run of one win from their past 
12 matches in all competitions.

The 51-year-old guided the club to the League One title and also oversaw the 
Johnstone’s Paint Trophy win at Wembley last season.

But the Championship club have found the going tough in recent weeks and 
despite holding Premier League side West Bromwich Albionto a draw on Saturday

, the club are third-bottom of the Championship.

The former Cheltenham and Burnley manager was embroiled in a post-match 
argument with fans following the 2-1 home defeat by Preston, which proved to be 
Cotterill’s last match in charge.

The club’s chairman Keith Dawe said: “I brought Steve Cotterill into Bristol 
City just over two years ago as I believed he could keep us in League One that 
year and build from there.

“Steve did keep us in the division and went on, in conjunction with the rest 
of the organisation, to deliver a League One championship and Johnstone’s Paint 
Trophy. That season will live in the memory for a long time.

“Sadly, since the highs of last March and May things have not gone our way on 
the pitch and Steve has now left the club.”

Cotterill had given his pre-match press briefing on Thursday before hosting 
Middlesbrough, and revealed the club’s failure to sign the Bolton striker Zach 
Clough despite agreeing a £2m.

The club’s assistant manager John Pemberton and under-21 coach Wade Elliott 
will take charge of the team in the interim period.
