Here’s the simplest personality test you’ll ever take. It consists of a single 
question:

Of your siblings, are you the oldest child, second oldest, third oldest… 
or perhaps the youngest?


For more than 100 years, psychologists have debated the relationship between 
birth order and personality. You’ve probably heard of “middle-child syndrome”. 
It’s the idea that the middle child misses out on both the privileges given to 
the oldest child and the allowances made for the baby of the family, and this 
may explain why they become withdrawn or resentful.

Firstborns are often thought to care more about pleasing their parents, and to 
be conscientious and dominant, with laterborns being more easy-going, sociable 
and creative.

However, 2015 saw the publication of two very large studies looking at almost 
400,000 people overall, which showed that these claims are largely myths. 
Although firstborns did emerge as fractionally more conscientious and less 
sociable than laterborns, they bucked the expected trend by coming out as more 
agreeable and less neurotic. More importantly, the size of this effect was 
tiny, with birth order explaining well under 1% of variability between 
different people with regard to personality.

The lesson is clear: whatever your strengths and weaknesses in terms of 
personality and intelligence, your position relative to your siblings is almost 
certainly not to blame.
