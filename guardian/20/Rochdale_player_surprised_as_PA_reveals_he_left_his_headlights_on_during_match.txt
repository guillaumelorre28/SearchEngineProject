The announcement was made during a break in play in the first half of the 
League One fixture – surprising the 20-year-old midfielder Callum Camps, who 
later went on to open the scoring.

“I was listening to the PA because the ball was out of play, and as soon as I 
heard the reg I was thinking: ‘That’s my number plate,’” he told BBC Radio 
Manchester.

“I thought I’d blocked someone in, so I said to [team-mate] Jamie Allen: 
‘That’s my car, that,’ and he said: ‘What?’ I said again: ‘That’s my car 
they’ve just called out.’

“I looked over to Kevin Gibbins [the head of sports science] and said: ‘My 
car’s just been read out, can you sort it out?’”

Gillingham’s John Egan equalised in the 77th minute, keeping the away side in 
the play-off places, withRochdale
