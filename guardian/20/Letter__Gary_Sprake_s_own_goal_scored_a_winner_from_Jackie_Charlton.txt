Gary Sprake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/gary-sprake-obituary>’s faux 
pas, when he threw the muddy ball into his own net, produced one of the great 
football quotes. Centre-half Jackie Charlton, with his back to the goal waiting 
for the ball, was astonished to hear a loud roar from the crowd and see 
bald-headed referee Roger Kirkpatrick, famous for back-pedalling at speed, 
appear over his shoulder. When the ref explained what had happened, Charlton 
complained: “You can’t give a goal for that!”
