@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Is that the worst possible 
draw for the English clubs?

Maybe, but still, come on … they are two mouthwatering ties Charlie, no?
Elliot Jacobs (@jakeadopter) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> in light of the CL having 
become a Barca vs the rest cakewalk, this draw highlights the Europa League as 
the one to watch

Right, almost time for the draw (I think). The big news is that the man who 
has stepped intoGianni Infantino’s shoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/26/fifa-election-who-will-succeed-sepp-blatter-president-live>
 as Uefa draw overlord is Michael Heselswerdt (Uefa’s head of club 
competitions), who has a doctorate. Perhaps in tombola. I don’t know. Anyway, 
he’s doing a reasonable job, although he lacks the knowing smile that Infantino 
wears so well. Slightly wooden delivery too.

The bookies have Dortmund as 7/2 favourites to lift the trophy (and what a 
lovely trophy it is by the way - name a prettier football gong, go on …). Well, 
they are second in a league where finishing second is like finishing first. 
They’re only eight points behind Bundesliga behemoths Bayern Munich. They also 
have goal magnetPierre-Emerick Aubameyang 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/12/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-yaya-toure-african-player-year>
 slamming them home for fun. He’s scored 28 goals in 30 games. Incredible. 
Sevilla are second favourites, above Spurs, and then it’s Liverpool just above 
Manchester United, which seems pretty generous to Jürgen Klopp’s side, who have 
been more inconsistent than United, despite their wobbles this season.

Hello. There are some grand old teams in the pot for the Europa League last 16 
draw. There are no seedings. Nor is there any country protection. We could be 
in for some tasty ties. Jürgen Kloppcould travel back to Dortmund with Liverpool

,Gary Neville

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/25/manchester-united-midtjylland-europa-league-match-report>
 with Valencia – or there could even be a Manchester United v Liverpool 
double-header. Oof! Meanwhile, nobody wants to meet Spursafter their demolition 
job on Fiorentina last night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/25/tottenham-hotspur-fiorentina-europa-league-match-report>
. The big question is, who is going to look after the Uefa tombola while Gianni 
Infantino is trying to land the big job at the Fifa elections?

Anyway, here are the teams who will be in the pot: 

 * Braga (Portugal) 
 * Valencia (Spain) 
 * Sparta Prague (Czech Republic) 
 * Lazio (Italy) 
 * Shakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine) 
 * Athletic Bilbao (Spain) 
 * Bayer Leverkusen (Germany) 
 * Liverpool (England) 
 * Manchester United (England) 
 * Tottenham Hotspur (England) 
 * Fenerbahce (Turkey) 
 * Basel (Switzerland) 
 * Borussia Dortmund (Germany) 
 * Sevilla (Spain) 
 * Villarreal (Spain) 
 * Anderlecht (Belgium) 
The draw is due to take place at midday GMT. Games will be played on 10 and 17 
March.

Thanks for your tweets. The Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> eh? Bye. 
 
Liverpool and Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have never met before 
in European competition. A quick look at Manchester United’s fixtures shows 
that they have a Manchester derby three days after the second leg against 
Liverpool. What a week for United fans!Liverpool, meanwhile, have an away day 
at Southampton.
 charlie (@charlie_s) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Is that the worst possible 
draw for the English clubs?

Shakhtar Donetsk v Anderlecht

Basel v Sevilla

Villarreal v Bayer Leverkusen

Athletic Bilbao v Valencia

Liverpool v Manchester United

Sparta Prague v Lazio

Borussia Dortmund v Tottenham Hotspur

Fenerbahce v Braga

(First team drawn to play home leg first)

Games will be played on 10 and 17 March.






 
Fenerbahce v Braga finishes things off. 
 
Borussia Dortmund v Tottenham Hotspur! What a tie that is. Spurs get the home 
leg second in a mouthwatering fixture. Two teams pressing each other to within 
an inch of their lives, no doubt.

Why Tottenham may be the least ‘Spursy’ team in recent Spurs history

Sparta Prague v Lazio!
 
It’s Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> v Manchester 
United! There we go. This is what happens when Gianni Infantino isn’t doing the 
draw. You get madness. He is a safe pair of hands indeed. He’ll never get the 
Fifa job.

So United get the home leg second. Oof!

It’s Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> v Bayer 
Leverkusen!
 
It’s Basel v Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> up next!

The final is being staged at their stadium on 18 May. 
 
The first tie out of the bowl is …

Shakhtar Donetsk v Anderlecht
 
One last point. The first team out of the bowl plays the first leg at home. 
 
Who is Heselswerdt’s sidekick then? It’s Alex Frei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/21/euro2004.sport24>! A Basel 
and Switzerland legend. He scored 18 goals in 38 Europa League/Uefa Cup 
appearances. Very decent. But can he pluck balls from a bowl safely? Let’s see 
shall we …
 
Right, almost time for the draw (I think). The big news is that the man who 
has stepped intoGianni Infantino’s shoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/26/fifa-election-who-will-succeed-sepp-blatter-president-live>
