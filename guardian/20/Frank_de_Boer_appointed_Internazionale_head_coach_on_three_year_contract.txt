“I hope to get us on the right track as soon as possible,” de Boer said at his 
unveiling. “But obviously it’s not going to be easy.

“We speak the same language - myself, the president and the management team,” 
he added. “We want to win.”

De Boer had been linked with Premier League clubs Everton and Southampton 
before those vacancies werefilled by Ronald Koeman

 respectively. De Boerresigned as Ajax head coach in May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/frank-de-boer-leaves-ajax-everton>
 but won four consecutive Eredivisie titles with the club between 2011 and 2014.

Inter came fourth in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> last season, failing to 
qualify for the Champions League for the fifth consecutive year. “Serie A has 
really grown and it’s getting better and better,” De Boer said. “In my eyes 
it’s a huge league. I had [pressure] at Ajax and Barcelona too. It’s completely 
normal.”

Mancini, meanwhile, left Internazionale after his relationship with the 
Chinese company Suning Holdings broke down over the summer.

De Boer’s first assignment will be a friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach 
in Ancona on Wednesday night, with a match against Celtic in Limerick to follow 
before the Serie A season starts at Chievo on 21 August.
