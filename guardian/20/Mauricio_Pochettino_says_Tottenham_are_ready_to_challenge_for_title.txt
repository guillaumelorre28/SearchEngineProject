Pochettino believes that his squad are more mature than they were last season, 
when they pushed for the title only to fall away in the final matches, and the 
Spurs manager felt that the win over West Brom sent out a powerful message.

Tottenham had beaten Manchester City in October only to stumble thereafter 
but, followingthe victory over Chelsea

 in their previous league game, they did not drop their levels. Far from it. 
Pochettino said the hammering of West Brom was one of the most complete 
performances of his tenure. “After [beating] Chelsea, it was a big challenge 
for us to keep the momentum and show that we are mature enough to fight for big 
things – and this was a very good example of that,” Pochettino said. “We have 
more belief now and we are much better than last season. We have nine more 
points than we had at this stage of last season [after 21 games].

“We are showing that we have learnt a lot from last season. We are more 
mature. Today, we did not even concede a corner. The performance was brilliant, 
especially in the first 45 minutes. Now, we are looking at [Saturday’s 
opponents] Manchester City. That is the most important game.”

Kane took his tally for the league season to 13 in 16 matches – he has two 
more in the Champions League – to round off a momentous week. Last weekend, he 
became a father for the first time. “It’s a different life for Harry now with 
the baby but he won’t change because he is very mature,” Pochettino said.

The only downside for Tottenham was the serious ankle ligament injury that 
forced off Jan Vertonghen in the second half. “It looks very bad,” Pochettino 
said. “His ankle is badly swollen.”
