Christmas is the one time of year when our stomachs can rest blessedly free 
from the vagaries of fashion – even people who’ve spent the last 12 months 
dining exclusively on kimchi and salted caramel cronuts are happy to sit down 
on 25 December to a menuthat hasn’t changed all that much since the 18th 
century. 
<http://www.historytoday.com/maggie-black/common-room-christmas-dinner-1773> 
But, although change for the sake of it is to be frowned upon (and I’ll die 
before I admitbacon has any place in a trifle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/28/heston-goes-the-whole-hog-this-christmas-with-bacon-and-banana-trifle>
), some new traditions are to be welcomed with open arms.

Personally, Italian panettone leaves me cold; more Germanic imports, stodgier 
and richer, fit in much better with the British weather. Chief among these 
recent additions, as far as I’m concerned, is stollen, arichly fruited bread 
from Dresden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/02/foodanddrink.recipes>, 
often spiked with the familiar flavour of marzipan, making it like the decadent 
love child of a hot cross bun and afestive fruit cake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/17/how-cook-perfect-christmas-cake>
. I can’t get enough of the stuff, but – although it’s perfectly possible to 
buy very decent examples from certain discount supermarkets – it’s one of those 
things that is even better made at home, and not just because it makes the 
whole house smell of Christmas.

Flour

The two German recipes I try – from Luisa Weiss’s Classic German Baking 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0BByCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=stollen+luisa+weiss&source=bl&ots=MfpAobsqWw&sig=lT4qcUjKvUUv8_n7anTFfzVUKsg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT3_6ineLQAhUMDMAKHSq8BqgQ6AEISzAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false>
 and the lovelyA Sausage Has Two blog 
<http://www.asausagehastwo.com/recipe-christmas-stollen/> – call for plain 
flour, as doesMartha Stewart 
<http://www.marthastewart.com/354111/christmas-morning-stollen>, while the 
Serious Eats version 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/marzipan-stollen-recipe-german-bread-christmas.html>
 uses strong bread flour. Generally speaking, of course, the latter, with its 
higher protein content, is the better bet for bread, as the extra gluten gives 
dough a stronger, more elastic structure. But stollen is no ordinary bread; in 
fact, it’s supposed to be fairly dense and tight, which means that plain flour 
seems the way to go here.


Doves Farm <http://www.apple.com>, producers of various organic flours, give a 
recipe for stollen using wheat, rye and einkorn flour on its blog, which sounds 
pleasingly Germanic. This is one recipe where you can get away with 
substituting heavier flours, given the results will never be featherlight, but 
although it definitely tastes interesting, it doesn’t taste like stollen to me: 
“A bit worthy,” says one tester, going in for another piece.


I’ll be starting my stollen with a very quick pre-ferment, in which the yeast, 
flour and milk are left to their own devices for 30 minutes, as in the Serious 
Eats recipe. I think it gives the loaf a more complex flavour (although its 
poor rise suggests I probably overheated the milk and managed to kill off half 
the yeast) – you can leave it longer if you like, but half an hour seems just 
about doable at this frenetic time of year.


Raising agent

More modern stollen recipes sometimes use baking powder instead of the 
traditional yeast, which makes their preparation much quicker. Indeed, 
quarkstollen, where the low-fat fresh cheese is added to the dough to add 
“moisture and tenderness” in Weiss’s words, is almost always made like this 
(note: if time is of the essence and you can’t find quark, Stewart goes for the 
more widely available ricotta instead). This is certainly handy if you have a 
yen for instant gratification, but the baking powder versions lack the depth of 
flavour of the yeast-raised ones, so it’sdefinitely a compromise.

The butter and eggs

There is no getting away from the fact that stollen is a decadent proposition, 
designed to celebrate one of the biggest feasts in the church year, and the 
amount of butter that goes into it may raise a few eyebrows. The two richest 
recipes I try come from A Sausage Has Two and Serious Eats, which both use a 
ratio of about one part butter to three parts flour – an amount so large that, 
making the first, I’m moved to double check it before pouring it in (melting 
the butter, as A Sausage Has Two and Doves Farm suggest, proves easier than 
rubbing it into the dough, as in the other recipes). It is no coincidence that 
these two have the softest textures and the richest flavours, so I am afraid 
you will have to accept the inevitable and slice it more thinly if this 
concerns you. In the same spirit, Serious Eats’s egg yolks, rather than whole 
eggs, will give the dough a more tender crumb and a deeper colour and flavour.

Interestingly, A Sausage Has Two calls for the dry dough to rest for 40 
minutes before adding the butter, although at this point it looks only half 
finished, and surrounded by unincorporated flour. I suspect this is because too 
much fat can stop the bread from rising, but since this doesn’t seem to be a 
problem in the Doves Farm version – and since I am already using a pre-ferment 
and would like to keep the stages to a minimum – I’m not going to bother.

The flavourings

Sugar is a must in stollen, but the amounts vary wildly, with Doves Farm using 
a ratio of 1:13 sugar to flour and Stewart confirming the idea that Americans 
have a sweet tooth by sticking in more than six times that amount. Although her 
bread is lovely, it is very sweet in comparison with many of the others, and 
testers decide they prefer the contrast between a more savoury crumb and the 
plump, sweet fruit within, so my stollen will be towards the more austere end 
of the spectrum.


The spices you choose to include are largely up to you (one of the joys of 
making this at home) but, to give an idea of the options available, A Sausage 
Has Two and Doves Farm use vanilla, Stewart cardamon and mace and Doves Farm 
mixed spice. (Interestingly, Weiss eschews any spices: clearly, this is a 
plainer affair than your average British festive bake.) Predictably, I like 
nutmeg and cardamom, but feel free to pick your own favourite poison.

Fruit and nuts

Although fruit isn’t a must either – Weiss goes for nuts and lemon zest alone 
– I love the pops of juicy sweetness it offers, especially when soaked in booze 
or clementine juice (as in the Doves Farm recipe) beforehand. Dark rum seems to 
be the most popular choice, suggesting the Germans have a taste for the 
tropical, but Serious Eats’s bourbon and Doves Farm’s brandy both work 
perfectly well if you don’t happen to have anything else knocking about. Again, 
the mixture of fruit is largely up to you, although I like a variety of colours 
and textures in mine and a good handful of candied peel (if you’re averse to 
the latter, feel free to substitute some freshly grated lemon or orange zest or 
to eschew citrus altogether).


Almonds, although not mandatory, add a pleasant crunch. Weiss uses them ground 
as well, which tastes lovely but, in the heavier, more buttery dough I’m 
planning, would probably sink any chances of it rising even slightly. If you’d 
like even more of an almond flavour, Stewart’s almond essence is a clever 
addition, although I prefer to get mine through the addition of a snake of 
marzipan. This is definitely optional – the oldest recipes don’t include it – 
but, really,why wouldn’t you?

Shaping, cooking and glazing

As the pictures prove, explaining how to shape a stollen is more difficult 
than actually doing it – in fact, I suspect a line must have been missed out of 
Weiss’s recipe, because I do nothing more than roll it out and stick it in the 
oven, from where it emerges an hour later, a solid, if tasty, brick. It’s 
easiest, I think, towatch it being done 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T93FWFDIseU>.


Don’t be tempted to overbake it: stollen is better a bit squidgy than dry and 
crusty. Traditionally, it is glazed with several layers of melted butter and 
icing sugar to keep it fresh – because this is definitely what it needs at this 
point – and then matured for at least a week before consumption. I dare you to 
try to keep it that long.

Makes 1 stollen
100g dried fruit of your choice (I like sultanas, currants and morello 
cherries)
2 tbsp dark rum or other spirit
160ml whole milk
3 tsp dried active yeast
425g plain flour, plus 1 tbsp
150g butter, plus 2 tbsp to glaze
50g caster sugar
1 level tsp fine salt
½ tsp ground nutmeg or other spice of your choice
2 egg yolks
25g mixed peel
150g marzipan
25g flaked almonds
4 tbsp icing sugar

Put the fruit in a bowl with the rum, cover and leave to soak. Meanwhile, heat 
the milk until just warm. Whisk together the yeast and extra 1 tbsp of flour 
then whisk in the milk and leave to sit for between 30 minutes and an hour 
until the top is covered with a mass of tiny bubbles. While it is fermenting, 
melt the butter (except for the extra 2 tbsp) and set aside to cool slightly.


Mix the remaining flour, sugar, salt and spice in a large mixing bowl and then 
pour in the milk mixture along with the yolks. Mix well, then stir in the 
melted butter until you have a coherent dough. Turn out on to a clean surface 
and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and slightly elastic. Cover and 
set aside somewhere warm for about an hour until slightly risen.

Turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead in the soaked fruit – 
discarding (or consuming) any liquid that hasn’t been absorbed – plus the mixed 
peel and nuts until well dispersed. Put back into the bowl, cover and leave for 
another 30 minutes.

Turn out on the same surface and flatten into a rough oval shape, then use a 
rolling pin to make a trench down the length of the oval, about a third of the 
way in. Fold in the two ends of the trench slightly to make a lip at either 
end, then roll the marzipan into a sausage the same length as the dough and 
place in the trench. Fold the larger side over the top of the marzipan and 
press down to seal on the other side – it’s easiest to watch this done online. 
Put on a lined baking tray and leave to rise for another 40 minutes. Heat the 
oven to 200C.

Bake the stollen for about 30 minutes until it is golden and a skewer comes 
out clean. Meanwhile, melt the extra butter, then brush over the loaf, sprinkle 
with icing sugar, and repeat this several times until the stollen has a white 
glaze. Allow to cool, wrap well and store for at least two days – and up to a 
week – before tucking in.

Stollen: better than Christmas cake or a poor cousin to panettone? How do you 
like yours, and which imported festive traditions have become part of your 
annual celebrations?
