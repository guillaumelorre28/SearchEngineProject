Cristiano Ronaldo scored on his return from injury as Real Madrid thrashed 
promoted Osasuna 5-2 at the Bernabéu to equal the club’s 1960-61 record of 15 
successive La Liga wins. Even better for Real,Barcelona’s later home defeat to 
Alavés 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/barcelona-alaves-la-liga-match-report>
 left Zinedine Zidane’s side alone at the top.

Ronaldo started the rout by knocking home an inviting cut-back from Gareth 
Bale in the sixth minute, with goals from Danilo and Sergio Ramos sending 
Madrid 3-0 up before the break. Pepe and Luka Modric were also on target before 
headers from Oriol Riera and David Garcia provided some consolation for the 
visitors, who saw Roberto Torres miss a 73rd-minute penalty and Cayetano Bonnín 
sent off in the 80th.

Real’s 15th consecutive La Liga win under Zidane matched the club record set 
by Miguel Muñoz’s side in the 1960-61 season, when Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc 
Puskas and Francisco “Paco” Gento were in the team. One more win would equal 
Barcelona’s 2010-11La Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>
 record of 16 in a row.

Madrid sat back for a while after Ronaldo’s goal, allowing Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> plenty of possession that the 
visitors failed to capitalise on. Zidane’s side then picked up the pace, with 
Toni Kroos firing into the side netting when the goalkeeper Nauzet Pérez palmed 
the ball into his path after a deflected cross from Ronaldo.

Pérez was caught out of position in the 40th minute when he rushed out to flap 
away the ball only for it to find the Brazilian defender Danilo, who scored 
from a deflected strike.

Ramos went close with a header from a corner earlier in the half and found the 
net shortly before the interval in identical fashion, this time directing his 
effort in under the crossbar.

Pepe added the fourth from another Kroos corner in the 56th, Pérez fumbling 
the ball in off the Portugal centre-back’s header.

Modric made it 5-0 with a fine effort in the 62nd minute, curling the ball 
into the far corner from outside the penalty area, before Karim Benzema and 
Lucas Vázquez came on for Ronaldo and Bale.

Real again took their foot off the gas and Osasuna pulled two goals back, 
through Riera’s header from Miguel Ángel de las Cuevas’s cross and another 
nodded effort from David García.

Bonnín went off for his second bookable offence but hopes of a comeback were 
futile in any case.
