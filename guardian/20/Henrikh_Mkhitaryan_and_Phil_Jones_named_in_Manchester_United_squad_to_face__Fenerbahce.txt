While that was the last of the Armenian’s five appearances, Jones has not 
featured since 2 January – due to ankle and knee injuries – when he was also 
replaced at the interval of a victory over Swansea City.

Rooney is set to start due to the captain currently being out of the manager’s 
first XI for the Premier League.

United are second to Feyenoord in Group A, with each club on six points. 
Fenerbahce, who United beat 4-1 a fortnight ago in the reverse game at Old 
Trafford, are third on four points, with Zorya Luhansk bottom, with one.
