Robert Lewandowski's second-half goal took Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> clear at the top of the 
Bundesliga thanks to a 1-0 win over Werder Bremen in a one-sided match at the 
Westfalenstadion.

Lewandowski netted the only goal of the game in the 55th minute but Dortmund 
should have won more convincingly as they created enough chances to win by a 
huge margin.

Bremen lost their unbeaten start to the season but apart from a Marko 
Arnautovic effort before half-time and a Franco Di Santo shot, they spent much 
of the game defending their own goal. The chances came thick and fast for the 
home side with Marco Reus terrorising the Bremen defence. A combination of the 
visitors' goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz and some wasteful finishing ensured the 
visitors were still in the game after half an hour.

The crossbar came to Bremen's rescue as Jakub Blaszczykowski's shot cannoned 
out. Lewandowski then went close several times before Arnautovic almost 
silenced the home fans on the stroke of half-time, his shot brushing the far 
post on its way wide.

It was a similar story in the second half with Dortmund dominating and they 
finally scored 10 minutes in. Reus squared the ball from the right to the 
unmarked Lewandowski who had an easy tap-in.

Di Santo came on for his Bremen debut and he almost marked it with a goal, 
testing Roman Weidenfeller's alertness four minutes from time. An equaliser 
would have been cruel on Dortmund but their failure to add a second meant they 
had to suffer for their third win in a row.
