<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/johnny-russell-derby-county-hull-city-championship-play-off-wembley-match-report>
 – a result which sent Steve Bruce’s side through to face Sheffield Wednesday 
in the final thanks to a 3-2 aggregate victory. An ugly confrontation between a 
Hull supporter and Derby captain Richard Keogh when the Republic of Ireland 
international appears to be goaded has been circulating on social media.

The FA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> has confirmed to the Guardian 
that it already has opened an investigation and will be liaising with both 
clubs. No time-frame has been set for a decision to be made.

Last year, Aston Villa were fined £200,000

 after their victory in the FA Cup quarter-final over West Brom, while Reading 
had to pay out £100,00 after a similar incident at the Madejski Stadium.
