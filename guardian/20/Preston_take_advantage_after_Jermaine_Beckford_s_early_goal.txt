Preston North End <https://www.theguardian.com/football/preston>, haunted by 
nine successive play-off failures, took a tentative step towards reaching the 
Championship with a 1-0 semi-final first-leg win at Chesterfield on Thursday.

The former Everton striker Jermaine Beckford grabbed a first-half winner for 
North End to give them hope of improving on a dismal record of having departed 
at the play-off semi-final stage six times since 1989.

Beckford raced on to a through ball and slotted in a calm finish for his 10th 
goal in his past 16 appearances.

Preston fell into the play-offs on the final day of the season when an 18-game 
unbeaten run ended at Colchester and MK Dons snatched second place inLeague One
