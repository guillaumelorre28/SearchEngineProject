The club’s chairman, Tony Stewart, said: “It is with a heavy heart that we’ve 
parted company with Neil today. As we all know football is a results driven 
business and with 16 games to go our aim has to be to retain our Championship 
status.

“Everyone at the club wishes Neil well with his future career and thank him 
for his efforts and endeavour. Our focus now is 100% behind appointing a first 
team manager as soon as possible.”

Redfearn, who replaced Steve Evans, had previously managed Leeds, Scarborough 
and Halifax.
