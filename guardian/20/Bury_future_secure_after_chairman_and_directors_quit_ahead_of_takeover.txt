Bury's future looks safe after a takeover which has seen the chairman, Brian 
Fenton, and board of directors resign with immediate effect. The club announced 
in April that they needed Â£1m to survive.

The club, who were relegated from League One

, said that the manager, Kevin Blackwell, will receive the backing of the 
incoming board members.

A statement on buryfc.co.uk read: "The paperwork for the takeover has been 
formally completed. The board of directors have all resigned in order for new 
board members to be appointed during the next few days. It is hoped that the 
paperwork can be concluded by 5pm on Wednesday 29 May. This will allow wages, 
HMRC and loans obtained from the PFA to be fully repaid, and allow the club to 
move forward.

"The new board of directors will be bringing in key individuals to assist in 
bringing new ideas and business models to ensure the financial security ofBury

"The new board of directors have met with Kevin Blackwell and support him 100% 
in his vision of returning Bury to the position it deserves. The new board 
would like to thank Jim Lomas and Neville Neville for their support and hard 
work in assisting with the due diligence process. Without their input this 
would not have been possible."
