The industrial apartment that theatre designer Tom Scutt calls home is tucked 
away on an unassuming street in east London. Flitting around his kitchen making 
coffee – and it’s exactly the sort of kitchen you see in coffee adverts, all 
open shelves and aspiration – you’d never guess from his breezy chat that Scutt 
is horrifically jetlagged. Later, he’ll show me a rooster he drew at 3am in the 
absence of sleep. It’s brilliant, detailed and, given that the rooster is 
wearing a wrestling singlet, a little leftfield – much like Scutt himself.

The jetlag is due to Scutt’s return from New York, where he designed his second
MTV Video Music Awards show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2016/aug/28/vma-2016-mtv-video-music-awards-live-kanye-britney-beyonce>
, and where he’s preparing for the opening of Les Liaisons Dangereuses,
transferring to Broadway after its sell-out run at the Donmar Warehouse in 
London 
<http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/donmar-new-york/2016/les-liaisons-dangereuses#joADtoB6uY1qj4Hy.97>
. Scutt’s CV reads like a checklist of every must-see play in recent years: 
Constellations by Nick Payne,starring Rafe Spall and Sally Hawkins in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/20/constellations-review> and Jake 
Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson on Broadway

;The Deep Blue Sea at the National Theatre, starring Helen McCrory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/09/the-deep-blue-sea-review-helen-mccrory-national-theatre>
; and theAlmeida production of Mike Bartlett’s King Charles III 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/king-charles-3-flawed-premise-royally-entertaining>
, for which Scutt landed a Tony nomination this year after its transfer to New 
York.

Do people assume his home will be the definition of good taste on account of 
his work? “I don’t know, but if ever a fancy dress party comes up, it’s a 
designer’s nightmare because people have… expectations,” he grins. “It can make 
Halloween quite stressful.” His flat is loft-style, with white walls, exposed 
bricks, wooden floors, and an open-plan kitchen/living room – compact but light 
thanks to vast industrial metal windows from which you can see the Barbican. 
But it’s what Scutt has filled the space with, from furniture to curiosities 
that draw the eye.

Many of the items (such as a driftwood figure and stones he collected on a 
beach last New Year while away with friends) remind him of memorable, happy 
times. Others reference his career: a butterfly glass display box, from a 
production of Alice Through The Looking Glass, that Scutt has filled with old 
family photos; a poster for a production of Coriolanus his dad produced while 
at Cambridge; and, of course, souvenirs of Scutt’s own productions.

We conduct the interview sitting on “Anna Chancellor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/26/anna-chancellor-young-chekhov-the-seagull-national-theatre-q-and-a>
” and “Kara Tointon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/29/kara-tointon-interview-absent-friends>
”. Scutt explains: “Most of my furniture comes from shows I’ve done. This Ercol 
sofa is from a [2011]double bill at Chichester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/15/south-downs-browning-version-review>
 of Terence Rattigan’s The Browning Version and South Downs by David Hare that 
starred Anna Chancellor. She spent a lot of time sitting on the sofa, so it’s 
named after her. Similarly, actor Kara Tointon spent most ofAlan Ayckbourn’s 
Absent Friends 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/10/absent-friends-review> [2012] in 
that replica Eames chair you’re sitting in.”

Of his own house, he says, “It’s about creating a space that you can 
simultaneously be inspired by and isn’t too invasive – it doesn’t cloud your 
head too much. The things that inspire me are constantly changing, so I like to 
have regular clear-outs. It’s a bit like clothes – the ones you haven’t worn 
for years can be got rid of. The same is true of objects: if there’s something 
I haven’t got anything from for a while, I know it’s time for it to go.”

There are other bits of pop culture detritus, too: Kermit the Frog (Scutt is a 
Muppets <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-muppets> fan), and a Tintin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tintin> figure. The latter stands atop a 
black cube that, it transpires, is a scale model of one featured in Scutt’s 
breakthrough show,Mike Bartlett’s dystopian 13 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/26/13-review>, at the National 
Theatre in 2011.

For all the importance of possessions, Scutt’s understanding of the notion of 
home has changed over the years. “I used to live in a two-bedroom house where I 
had my studio in the spare room. I fooled myself into believing I needed loads 
of space because I’m a theatre designer, and have all these model boxes and 
stuff. Moving here, I was apprehensive about downscaling, but I realised that 
actually the problem all along was that I had too much space. I just couldn’t 
control it.”

Furthermore, his parents moved from the family home, so he “can’t physically 
return to that nostalgic place any more”; and he rents rather than owns, which 
means “I’m on the move every three years or so.” As a result, home is more 
about people and less about the physical space.

“There’s a nomadic, often lonely, lifestyle that comes with my job, not only 
in terms of geographical places, but the way people pass through your life. You 
make these families on the job, and then you move on. So I made the decision to 
live near friends and have that support network close by. My best friend lives 
45 seconds away, so living here is the best I’ve ever felt.”
