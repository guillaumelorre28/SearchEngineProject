As Kieran said in his tweet, Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have lost their shape of late 
and were very vulnerable to the counter so this goal came as no surprise. It 
started with Piatti (who came on for De Paul) losing the ball at the corner of 
the Lyon box by passing to no one. Darder picked it up and fed Tolisso. He 
played the ball to Lacazette who returned the favour and the midfielder found 
the striker’s run with a defence splitting pass. Lacazette latched onto that 
pass and ran on to beat Doménech with ease.

75 mins Very much so:
Kieran Canning (@KieranCanning) 
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have lost their shape 
completely here. Lyon should have killed this off on the break already

Meanwhile, Valencia have another corner. It falls to Parejo. He controls it on 
his knee and, under pressure from a storm of red shirts, he snaps at his 
effort. It goes wide.

71 mins Speaking of Lacazette. On the edge of the box, he poked the ball 
through theValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> defence and 
into the path of Darder. He looked certain to score but a superb save from 
Doménech stopped him from doing so.

69 mins Lyon get their first yellow card of the game (thanks to a Tolisso foul 
on Parejo) and almost get their second goal of the game. A swift counter saw 
Cornet set free down the right. He pegged his way towards goal and then, using 
the outside of his boot, curled a most dangerous ball across the goal. 
Lacazette was this close to get his toe on it.

swoops to the rescue and puts in a game-saving challenge on the young Lyon

55 mins Cancelo wins a corner under pressure from Bedimo. De Paul takes. It 
comes off the head of Abdennour and then Mustafi feeds it wide to De Paul, who 
has taken up a spot on the right, near the corner of the box. He tries to beat 
his man, Grenier, who stops him by putting his hand across De Paul’s chest. It 
is a nothing challenge but De Paul goes down like he has been hit by a ton of 
bricks andValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> get a free. 
It comes to nothing.

Lyon have been excellent down their right-hand side so it’s no surprise that 
that is where the goal has come from. Rafael, as he has done so often this 
evening, fed the ball Cornet. He had a bit of time and space and so he wandered 
forward. Once inside the box, he cut inside, stepped over the ball and, even 
though he was surrounded by threeValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> players, he curled it into the 
top corner of the net. Doménech had no chance.

Well, well Neville’s first game ends in defeat. And it’s hard to argue that 
they deserved anything other than that. He has lots of work to do there. That’s 
all from me. Thanks for the correspondence! See ya!

90 + 1 mins It’s all over in Chelsea and Arsenal.
 
90 mins There will be three more minutes before we are all put out of our 
misery.
 
89 mins It’s fair to say that this one has petered out.

87 mins “Valencia could be drawn against Manchester United in the Europa Cup” 
points out Raymond Reardon. “Who will the Class of 92 support?”
 
84 mins The fans are heading for home or for a late night snack at the Walk to 
Wok at 10 Calle de San Vicente Mártir.
 
82 mins Some more sub news for what it’s worth. Koné replaces Sergi and 
Beauvue replaces Lacazette.
 
80 mins Game. Definitely. Over.

As Kieran said in his tweet, Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have lost their shape of late 
and were very vulnerable to the counter so this goal came as no surprise. It 
started with Piatti (who came on for De Paul) losing the ball at the corner of 
the Lyon box by passing to no one. Darder picked it up and fed Tolisso. He 
played the ball to Lacazette who returned the favour and the midfielder found 
the striker’s run with a defence splitting pass. Lacazette latched onto that 
pass and ran on to beat Doménech with ease.
 
Game. Over.

75 mins Very much so:
Kieran Canning (@KieranCanning) 
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> have lost their shape 
completely here. Lyon should have killed this off on the break already
 <https://twitter.com/KieranCanning/status/674698907453169664> December 9, 2015
 <https://twitter.com/KieranCanning/status/674698907453169664> 
Meanwhile, Valencia have another corner. It falls to Parejo. He controls it on 
his knee and, under pressure from a storm of red shirts, he snaps at his 
effort. It goes wide.
 
73 mins Just before that effort, by the way, Ghezzal replaced Grenie.
 
71 mins Speaking of Lacazette. On the edge of the box, he poked the ball 
through theValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> defence and 
into the path of Darder. He looked certain to score but a superb save from 
Doménech stopped him from doing so.
 
69 mins Lyon get their first yellow card of the game (thanks to a Tolisso foul 
on Parejo) and almost get their second goal of the game. A swift counter saw 
Cornet set free down the right. He pegged his way towards goal and then, using 
the outside of his boot, curled a most dangerous ball across the goal. 
Lacazette was this close to get his toe on it.
 
67 mins All of a sudden, the Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> fans have woken up and with 
good reason because ...
Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) 
GOAL! Gent 1-1 Zenit (Dzyuba 65) #UCL 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCL?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/674697400896868352> December 9, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/674697400896868352> 
All Neville’s side need to do now is score twice.
 
65 mins Down the other end, a Lacazette pass sets Cornet free. He is through 
on goal and this looks bad forValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> until out of nowhere, Abdennour 
swoops to the rescue and puts in a game-saving challenge on the young Lyon 
player.
 
64 mins Negredo does his best to try and thread a through ball but the bad 
news forValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> is that 
Alcácer, who has been anonymous this evening, is caught offside.
 
63 mins There has been another goal in the Arsenal game. Paul Doyle etc etc etc
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/dec/09/olympiakos-arsenal-champions-league-live>
.
 
61 mins Another Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> 
attack but this time it’s Negredo who is the fulcrum of it. He barges his way 
into the box but looks to belt one in from close range but a host of red clad 
bodies get in the way and block his effort.
 
59 mins While that email was being copied and pasted, Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> had two right-footed, 
outside-of-the-box chances. The first one came from Cancelo and the second came 
from Fuego. Lopes did well to deal with both of them.
 
57 mins “Having certain long-standing allegiances,” says Matt Dony “I can’t 
really believe I’m going to say this, but I hopeGary Neville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-neville> makes a real success of it. 
I hope he gets something out of this match, and goes on to make a bit of an 
impact in La Liga. Right. Now I’m off to wash my hands after typing that. Out, 
damned spot.”
 
55 mins Cancelo wins a corner under pressure from Bedimo. De Paul takes. It 
comes off the head of Abdennour and then Mustafi feeds it wide to De Paul, who 
has taken up a spot on the right, near the corner of the box. He tries to beat 
his man, Grenier, who stops him by putting his hand across De Paul’s chest. It 
is a nothing challenge but De Paul goes down like he has been hit by a ton of 
bricks andValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> get a free. 
It comes to nothing.
 
53 mins Danilo is replaced by Negredo. The crowd really like that one.
 
51 mins There has been a goal in the Chelsea game. Join Nick Miller for that 
one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/dec/09/chelsea-v-porto-champions-league-live>
. There has been no change in the score between Gent and Zenit, just in case 
you were wondering, which you probably weren’t, unless, of course, you are a 
hardcore Valencia fan but then if you are a hardcore Valencia fan you probably 
know already that the score between Gent and Zenit has not changed.
 
49 mins The first corner of the second half goes to Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. De Paul takes it and Lopes 
comes to punch it. He makes a hash of it but Lyon clear the ball anyway.
 
48 mins ... and floats the ball to the back post and the head of Mustafi. He 
uses his noggin to send the ball back across the box but the referee calls it 
all to a stop as Mustafi was offside.
 
47 mins There has been another goal in the Arsenal game. Join Paul Doyle for 
all the necessary information on that one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/dec/09/olympiakos-arsenal-champions-league-live>
. Meanwhile, a challenge on Danilo by Tolisso gives Valencia a free-kick in the 
centre of the pitch about 35 yards out. Parejo takes ...
 
45 mins Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep! We are back. No changes to tell you about just yet.
 
Is it just me or has Conor McGregor’s accent changed recently?
 
That’s your lot for now. Back in a few.
 
45 mins There will be one more minute and a corner to Lyon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon>. That comes to nothing.
 
43 mins The crowd are not happy. Firstly because they think their team 
should’ve been awarded a penalty – that was never a penalty. Secondly because 
Lopes was taking too long over a free. Thirdly because Santi Mina hacked down 
Gonalons and got a yellow card – that was always a yellow card.
 
42 mins Meanwhile in Belgium ...

became the second Valencia player to go into the book. He will miss the next 
game shouldValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> go through.
