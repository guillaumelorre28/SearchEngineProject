With most non-league sides not in action until Sunday, opportunities for 
upsets were at a premium on Saturday, when the most surprising result was
Chesterfield’s 1-0 win at League One high-flyers MK Dons.

Karl Robinson’s side had won five and drawn one of their previous six games 
but were knocked out by Armand Gnanduillet’s 53rd-minute header forChesterfield

One non-league side definitely through are Wrexham of the Conference Premier, 
who beat Ryman League Premier teamMaidstone United 3-1. Andy Bishop was the 
Welsh side’s match-winner, scoring twice.

Any hopes Plymouth had of causing a shock at Sheffield United disappeared in 
an eventful opening to the second half in which the League Two side missed a 
penalty and their opponents scored two. Argyle won a spot-kick early in the 
second half when Lewis Alessandra was fouled by Jay McEveley, but Reuben Reid 
sent the resulting penalty high over the bar.

They were punished when United won penalties in the 55th and 62nd minutes – 
for fouls by Ben Purrington on Marc McNulty, and Peter Hartley on Jamie Murphy 
respectively – that were converted by Jose Baxter. McNulty made it 3-0 in the 
closing stages.

Accrington of League Two are still in the hat after a 1-1 home draw with the 
League One strugglersYeovil, while the Doncaster manager, Paul Dickov, enjoyed 
a winning return to his former clubOldham. Genseric Kusunga’s own goal in the 
86th minute settled a tight encounter.
