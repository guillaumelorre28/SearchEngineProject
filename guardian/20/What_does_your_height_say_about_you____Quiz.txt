It’s not particularly surprising that taller men (though not taller women) 
score more highly on measures of dominance and independence.

Less well known is that, for reasons that are not yet understood, taller 
people – both men and women – tend to be more suspicious.

But perhaps most surprisingly of all, a recent study found a link between 
height and politics. This study looked back to the 2005 general election 
(Labour’s most recent victory), in which the Tories took around 30% of the vote 
overall. Figures obtained from a follow-up questionnaire found that this jumped 
to around 35% among the very tall, but fell to below 20% among the shortest 
voters. In fact, for every extra inch in height, support for the Conservatives 
grew by 0.6%.

This link isn’t quite as surprising as it might at first appear. It has long 
been known that taller people tend to earn more, and you will not be at all 
surprised to learn that higher earners are more likely to vote Conservative. 
The same study found that, on average, every extra £1,000 on your salary makes 
you 2-3% more likely to be a Tory voter.
