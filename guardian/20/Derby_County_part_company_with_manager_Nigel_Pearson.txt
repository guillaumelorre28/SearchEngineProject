It was widely expected that Pearson, who was appointed on 27 May, would leave 
Derbyafter a furious argument with Mel Morris

, the Championship club’s owner, led to him being suspended before the game at 
Cardiff City at the end of September.

Pearson met Morris at Derby’s training ground the day before the match against 
Cardiff to discuss in part the club’s poor start to the season and it is 
understood the conversation became extremely heated. The club opened an 
internal investigation into the incident as well as other concerns about 
Pearson’s approach, but following the manager’s departure the investigation is 
now closed.

“As a result of the mutual termination of Nigel Pearson’s employment agreement 
with Derby County any disciplinary process has now ceased,” read the statement.

“The board of Derby County will now turn their attention to appointing a new 
manager as soon as possible and expect to announce a successor in a timely 
fashion.”

Derby’s next match is at home against Leeds on 15 October.
