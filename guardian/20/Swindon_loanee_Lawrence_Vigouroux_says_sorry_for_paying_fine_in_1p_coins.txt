The Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper 
Lawrence Vigouroux has returned to Swindon Town on loan after apologising for 
paying a £50 fine with 5,000 1p pieces.

The 21-year-old had played nine games for Swindon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/swindon> after joining them on a 
season-long loan, but was sent back to Anfield on Monday after he used the 
coins to pay his fine for turning up late to training.

The manager Mark Cooper told the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34400657>: “Lawrence is going to come 
back, he is very humble and very apologetic. He knows the way he behaved was 
wrong and he has been in the changing room after the game and apologised to the 
players.

“He asked them if they wanted him back and they all said yes. Lawrence is an 
exceptional young goalkeeper and it’s important he learns from this little 
mishap and it will benefit his career going forward.”

The Swindon manager said he appreciated the humour, but that it had been 
perhaps misguided. “I thought it was brilliant banter, but in the context it 
was the wrong way to go about it. We are giving him a second chance, and I’m 
sure he will be grateful.”

A club statement 
<http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-lawrence-vigouroux-2719388.aspx>
 refered to the incident as “an individual indisrection”, saying Vigouroux had 
been called to a meeting in Liverpool by his parent club’s academy staff to 
explain his actions: “Following on from this meeting, Vigouroux has now 
returned to SN1 and will be available for selection again this weekend.”
