The Northern Premier League club, part owned by the former Manchester United 
players Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and his brother 
Phil, defeated County 2-0 last Friday and having secured a home draw again, 
will fancy their chances of progression to the third round, where they would be 
in the draw with United.

Eastleigh, who beat Crewe Alexandra on Saturday and sit seventh in the 
Vanarama National League, face an all non-league tie at another Northern 
Premier League club, Stourbridge.

And Brackley Town, who came from two goals down to secure a 2-2 draw with 
Newport County, face a trip to Barnet should they win their replay next week. 
Brackley are managed by Kevin Wilkin, who last season led Wrexham into the 
third round where they led 1-0 at Premier League Stoke City only to lose 
eventually 3-1, with the three Stoke goals coming in the final 10 minutes. 
Chesham, winners at Bristol Rovers on Sunday, could play Bradford City if the 
Yorkshire club win a replay against Aldershot Town.
