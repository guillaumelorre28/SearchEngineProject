Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez both hit the woodwork as Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were held 0-0 by Espanyol in a 
hard-fought derby that could see Atlético Madrid go top of La Liga if they beat 
the bottom side Levante later on Saturday.

Barça set a Spanish record of 180 goals in 2015 but their normally prolific 
attack drew a blank against their local rivals who were strong in the 
challenge, especially in the first half, and succeeded in disrupting their play.

Messi hit the crossbar with a 30-yard free kick in the first half while 
Suárez, who has 26 goals this season, was surprisingly wasteful in front of an 
open goal in the second half with his shot hitting the post.

Barça have 39 points, a point more than Atlético, with both having played 17 
games. Third-placed Real Madrid are on 36 points and are away to Valencia on 
Sunday.
