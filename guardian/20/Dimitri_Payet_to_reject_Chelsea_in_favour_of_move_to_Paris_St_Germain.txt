Dimitri Payet is set to join Paris St-Germain, despite interest from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. The Premier League champions 
have tracked the St-Etienne winger and it was reported in France this morning 
that they were considering a £7m bid.

Chelsea admire the 23-year-old's qualities, which include being two‑footed and 
able to play on either flank. He started the season with a flurry of goals and 
positive headlines but he sees his next move as being to PSG. There is the 
suspicion that St-Etienne have used Chelsea's interest in Payet to force PSG 
into a decisive move.

Payet is part of Laurent Blanc's new generation of France internationals and 
he has featured as a substitute in their last three fixtures – the Euro 2012 
qualifiers against Romania and Luxembourg and the friendly against England.

He advertised his talent with assists against both Romania and Luxembourg. 
Blanc is rebuilding after the disastrous World Cup campaign in South Africa.
