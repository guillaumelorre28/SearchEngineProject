My girlfriend of six years suddenly decided to have her breasts enlarged. The 
results are visually spectacular and definitely turn me on, but to be honest, 
now I’m not quite sure what to do with them during sex. They feel different, 
and I know she was in pain for a while so I don’t want to hurt her. What do you 
suggest?

If her augmentation was a recent operation, you would do well to be cautious 
for a while, because there can be some residual soreness. Most importantly, try 
to have a fact-finding conversation that begins with expressing your 
appreciation of her new appearance. Once she seems relaxed and open to a 
discussion, inquire about the healing process, and ask if she has pain in any 
specific areas, or if there is something you ought to be careful about. You 
should also find out if her doctor has issued any warnings or made any 
recommendations. There might be at least a temporary loss of sensation, so it 
would be best to keep checking with her about what feels good and what does 
not. Try different types of caresses and strokes in different locations while 
she provides immediate feedback. Use a simple gauge such as a scale of one to 
10, with 10 being the highest level of pleasurable sensation – this is also 
a way for her to assess and quantify the gradual repair of nerve endings. Try 
to make this exercise seductive, and avoid letting it become too technical.
