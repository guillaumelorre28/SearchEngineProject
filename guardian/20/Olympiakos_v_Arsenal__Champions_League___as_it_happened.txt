Full-time: Olympiakos 0-3 Arsenal

A perfect night for Arsenal! After a jittery start they grew into the game and 
emerged as masterful winners thanks to a hat-trick by Giroud, excellent 
performances by Campbell, Ozil, Koscielny and Mertesacker. They’re recovered 
from an awful start to the campaign and reached the knockout stage for the 16th 
year in succession. Wenger said beforehand that it would be the greatest escape 
of his reign and he and his players can now bask in deserved acclaim. Keep this 
up, get all their injured players back, and they might yet have an even 
longer-lasting laugh.

substitution: Oxlade-Chamberlain trots on, and Campbell walks off to a loud and 
fully deserved ovation - from both sets of fans, as the Greeks remain grateful 
for the performances he put in for them when he was on loan.

89 min: “Is this one of the least Arsenal-esque performances of recent times?” 
wonders Tom Atkins. “Big name players delivering, no late dramas, no injuries 
and a magnificent hat-trick by a big striker. Satchel may not be on the field 
but the impact he’s had on the side is evident.” It’s going to be weird hearing
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans not being able to 
complain about anything.

86 min: It’s been a dream night for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> ... but not quite wild enough 
for Monreal to be able to smash a 25-yard volley into the top corner. Instead 
it goes out for a throw-in.

still going through the motion though: he’s just replaced Pardo with 
Finnboggason, for all the good it’ll do.

80 min: Ozil stands over a freekick at the corner of the Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> box. He tries to catch out 
the keeper at the near post but Roberto punches away. “The only question now is 
which Arsenal player will get injured,” wonders Scott Wedel. Maybe, but at the 
moment this is shaping up to be a night of unadulterated triumph for Arsenal 
and Wenger. The big players mentioned beforehand have turned up - Giroud and 
Ozil - and several others have risen to the occasion too, especially Campbell 
and, after a dodgy start, Mertesacker.

77 min: Ramsey, another fine performer tonight, gains possession in midfield 
and spreads it wide to Campbell. For once the Costa Rican’s pass is imprecise, 
as he over-hits an intended ball to Giroud.

74 min: Campbell’s on the gallop again. After starting a move in his own half, 
he lopes forward and threads a pass through to Giroud, whose first-time shot is 
saved by the keeper. Turns out the Frenchman was offside anyway. At this rate, 
Wenger should take Campbell off to make sure he doesn’t get the booking that 
would rule him out of the first leg of their next tie.

69 min: Olympiakos seem burst. Arsenal are in platform boots and strutting 
now. You can tell by the way they use their walk that they’re a last 16 team 
and know it.Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> know 
it too. Only question now is whether Campbell will get the goal his 
performances deserves.

three goals (and avoid conceding any more), as a 3-2 Arsenal victory would send

62 min: What a chance for Olympiakos! A powerful shot/cross falls to Ideye, 
whose first touch is heavy ... and that gives Mertesacker just enough time to 
lunge in with a saving tackle! Get that wrong and it was a penalty or an open 
goal for Ideye! Chances keep coming at both ends here. It’s up for grabs 
alright!

61 min: There are more goals here for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, no doubt. Walcott had a chance 
just now but appeared to be slightly put off by Giround’s run across him and 
then got confused about whether to shoot or pass to the Frenchman. In the end 
he dabbed the ball to the nearest defender.

59 min: I’ve just seen a replay of the goal and feel the need to emphasis how 
well Campbell did to create it. Composure, deftness and awareness - the Costa 
Rican showed the lot as he dragged the ball away from a defender and rolled it 
perfectly into the path of Giroud, who would have been guilty of a crime 
against football it he’d messed up the finish: but he didn’t, he slapped it 
under the keeper well.

atmosphere! Cech has just had to fling himself across his goal to tip a curling 
20-yard shot by Fortounis around the post. Decent stop!

56 min: Oooh! That nearly sealed it for Arsenal! Campbell again did 
brilliantly, hooking in a cross that found its way to Walcott at the far post 
(after Giroud went down in suspicious circumstances). The forward’s shot on the 
bounce takes a nick off a defender and flies just wide!

55 min: Strong play by Koscielny induces Pardos to make a fool of himself, 
throwing himself to the turf and clutching his face in the hope that the ref 
will give him a freekick, all because he couldn’t get around the defender and 
take the ball.

51 min: No point in Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> going defensive now: they 
need a goal. And they go in immediate search of one and win a corner. Siovas 
meets it with a powerful header from 10 yards ... but it straight at Cech, who 
holds it calmly.

GOAL! Olympiakos 0-2 Arsenal (Giroud 49)

Guess that means his ankle is OK! Moments after hobbling back on to the pitch, 
Giroud receives a pass from Campbell - who did superbly - and slots it into the 
net from 12 yards! As things stand,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are about to pull off the great 
escape!

After a bit of treatment he hobbles off ...

47 min: Nope, Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> 
haven’t suddenly gone defensive! They come charging out of the blocks at the 
start of the second half, Pardo dazzles past Monreal down the left and hoiks in 
a vicious cross. Mertesacker does well to head away from right in front of his 
own goal.

team’s definitely playing with the handbrake on.” I wonder whetherOlympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> wish they had played with the 
handbrake on in the first half? Their boldness has been admirable and could 
have paid off but, well, it hasn’t so far. Will they be more defensive in the 
second half and try to cling on for a 1-0 defeat?

Half-time: Olympiakos 0-1 Arsenal

Another half like that will do Arsenal just fine! They started shakily but 
scored with a nicely constructed goal and have since grown in solidity.
Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> are certainly 
dangerous but Arsenal have shown that they, too, carry a threat on the break. 
This game is tautly poised. It’s up for grabs now!

A perfect night for Arsenal! After a jittery start they grew into the game and 
emerged as masterful winners thanks to a hat-trick by Giroud, excellent 
performances by Campbell, Ozil, Koscielny and Mertesacker. They’re recovered 
from an awful start to the campaign and reached the knockout stage for the 16th 
year in succession. Wenger said beforehand that it would be the greatest escape 
of his reign and he and his players can now bask in deserved acclaim. Keep this 
up, get all their injured players back, and they might yet have an even 
longer-lasting laugh.

90+2 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> sub: Giroud 
off, Chambers on.
 
90 +1 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
substitution: Oxlade-Chamberlain trots on, and Campbell walks off to a loud and 
fully deserved ovation - from both sets of fans, as the Greeks remain grateful 
for the performances he put in for them when he was on loan.
 
89 min: “Is this one of the least Arsenal-esque performances of recent times?” 
wonders Tom Atkins. “Big name players delivering, no late dramas, no injuries 
and a magnificent hat-trick by a big striker. Satchel may not be on the field 
but the impact he’s had on the side is evident.” It’s going to be weird hearing
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans not being able to 
complain about anything.
 
86 min: It’s been a dream night for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> ... but not quite wild enough 
for Monreal to be able to smash a 25-yard volley into the top corner. Instead 
it goes out for a throw-in.
 
84 min: You know the home fans have given up when they can’t even summon 
enough hostility to boo the PA’s information notice toArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans. Manager Mauro Silva is 
still going through the motion though: he’s just replaced Pardo with 
Finnboggason, for all the good it’ll do.
 
83 min: So, Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans, who 
do you fancy meeting in the last 16? Wolfsburg or Zenit, right?
 
80 min: Ozil stands over a freekick at the corner of the Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> box. He tries to catch out 
the keeper at the near post but Roberto punches away. “The only question now is 
which Arsenal player will get injured,” wonders Scott Wedel. Maybe, but at the 
moment this is shaping up to be a night of unadulterated triumph for Arsenal 
and Wenger. The big players mentioned beforehand have turned up - Giroud and 
Ozil - and several others have risen to the occasion too, especially Campbell 
and, after a dodgy start, Mertesacker.
 
77 min: Ramsey, another fine performer tonight, gains possession in midfield 
and spreads it wide to Campbell. For once the Costa Rican’s pass is imprecise, 
as he over-hits an intended ball to Giroud.
 
74 min: Campbell’s on the gallop again. After starting a move in his own half, 
he lopes forward and threads a pass through to Giroud, whose first-time shot is 
saved by the keeper. Turns out the Frenchman was offside anyway. At this rate, 
Wenger should take Campbell off to make sure he doesn’t get the booking that 
would rule him out of the first leg of their next tie.
 
73 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> change: 
Walcott’s race is run; on comes Gibbs in his place.
 
72 min: Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> sub: 
Kasami off, Dominguez on.
 
69 min: Olympiakos seem burst. Arsenal are in platform boots and strutting 
now. You can tell by the way they use their walk that they’re a last 16 team 
and know it.Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> know 
it too. Only question now is whether Campbell will get the goal his 
performances deserves.
 
67 min: Just to recap: Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> have 23 minutes to score 
three goals (and avoid conceding any more), as a 3-2 Arsenal victory would send 
Wenger’s men through.
 
Giroud sends the keeper the wrong way to complete his hat-trick and, surely, 
Arsenal’s great escape!

After a swift break, Monreal’s shot from 16 yards crashes agaisnt the hands of 
Eladeballaoui! Giroud will take the spotkick!
 
62 min: What a chance for Olympiakos! A powerful shot/cross falls to Ideye, 
whose first touch is heavy ... and that gives Mertesacker just enough time to 
lunge in with a saving tackle! Get that wrong and it was a penalty or an open 
goal for Ideye! Chances keep coming at both ends here. It’s up for grabs 
alright!
 
61 min: There are more goals here for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, no doubt. Walcott had a chance 
just now but appeared to be slightly put off by Giround’s run across him and 
then got confused about whether to shoot or pass to the Frenchman. In the end 
he dabbed the ball to the nearest defender.
 
59 min: I’ve just seen a replay of the goal and feel the need to emphasis how 
well Campbell did to create it. Composure, deftness and awareness - the Costa 
Rican showed the lot as he dragged the ball away from a defender and rolled it 
perfectly into the path of Giroud, who would have been guilty of a crime 
against football it he’d messed up the finish: but he didn’t, he slapped it 
under the keeper well.
 
58 min: This is a marvellously open game now, amid an achingly taut 
atmosphere! Cech has just had to fling himself across his goal to tip a curling 
20-yard shot by Fortounis around the post. Decent stop!
 
56 min: Oooh! That nearly sealed it for Arsenal! Campbell again did 
brilliantly, hooking in a cross that found its way to Walcott at the far post 
(after Giroud went down in suspicious circumstances). The forward’s shot on the 
bounce takes a nick off a defender and flies just wide!
 
55 min: Strong play by Koscielny induces Pardos to make a fool of himself, 
throwing himself to the turf and clutching his face in the hope that the ref 
will give him a freekick, all because he couldn’t get around the defender and 
take the ball.

51 min: No point in Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> going defensive now: they 
need a goal. And they go in immediate search of one and win a corner. Siovas 
meets it with a powerful header from 10 yards ... but it straight at Cech, who 
holds it calmly.
 
Guess that means his ankle is OK! Moments after hobbling back on to the pitch, 
Giroud receives a pass from Campbell - who did superbly - and slots it into the 
net from 12 yards! As things stand,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are about to pull off the great 
escape!

48 min: Uh-oh. Arsenal’s injury blues may be about to get deeper: Giroud is 
down and looking in serious pain after turning his ankle. You never quite know 
with Giroud - he does like a roll on the ground - but this one does look dicey. 
After a bit of treatment he hobbles off ...
 
47 min: Nope, Olympiakos <https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> 
haven’t suddenly gone defensive! They come charging out of the blocks at the 
start of the second half, Pardo dazzles past Monreal down the left and hoiks in 
a vicious cross. Mertesacker does well to head away from right in front of his 
own goal.
 
46 min: “Patrick McCabe [27 mins] was right on,” hollers Mike Nichols. 
“Cazorla brings the ball out of defence, picks out the right pass going 
forward, and helps push the pace, especially on the counter. Without him, the 
team’s definitely playing with the handbrake on.” I wonder whetherOlympiakos
