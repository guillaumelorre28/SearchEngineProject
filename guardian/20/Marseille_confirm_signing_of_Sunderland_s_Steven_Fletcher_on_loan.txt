In perhaps Monday’s oddest transfer Steven Fletcher swapped a relegation 
battle at the Stadium of Light for mid-table security at the Stade Vélodrome as 
Sunderland’s out-of-favour Scotland striker signed forMarseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> on loan.

The 28-year-old – whose departure prompted plenty of quips about there being 
one Scot in France this summer after all – may not have impressed Sam Allardyce 
but the Ligue One side have apparently identified him as the perfect attacking 
partner for the much coveted Michy Batshuayi.

Fletcher, who cost £12m when Martin O’Neill brought him to the north-east from 
Wolves in 2012, has made only 10 appearances under Allardyce and was entering 
the final six months of his contract atSunderland

Michel, the Marseille manager, is said to believe the partnership with 
Fletcher – who has scored four times in 16 games this season – could prove 
instrumental in persuading Batshuayi to stay put in the south of France. A 
prolific 22-year-old Belgian, Batshuayi averages a goal every other game and is 
admired by, among others Stoke, Newcastle and Spurs. Indeed, Stoke and 
Newcastle are understood to have made late bids for him before the transfer 
window closed.

Overall Fletcher scored 23 goals in 86 matches at Sunderland but now he will 
be receiving crosses from two former Newcastle United wingers, Rémy Cabella and 
Florian Thauvin, the latter having newly arrived back at Marseille on loan from 
St James’ Park.

After signing Wahbi Khazri,

 the Tunisia playmaker, from Bordeaux for £9m over the weekend, Allardyce 
needed to balance his budget on Wearside and offloading the well remunerated 
Fletcher for a loan fee went some way towards achieving that aim, particularly 
as Marseille are believed to be paying 100% of the striker’s wages.

Meanwhile Jordi Gómez, the Sunderland midfielder, has joined Blackburn, also 
on loan, until the end of the season.
