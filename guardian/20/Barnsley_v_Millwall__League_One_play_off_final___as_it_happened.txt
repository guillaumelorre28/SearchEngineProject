Hammill: “An unbelievable feeling, we’ve worked hard since November, 
sacrificed a lot and this is absolutely deserved. I’m made up for all the 
players and staff, they fully deserve it.”

Isgrove: “No better way to top a great season. [The first goal] settled down 
any nerves we had at the start and as soon as we started moving the ball we 
never looked like losing.”

Heckingbottom: “I said we’d wait until after the season [to decide his 
future]. Now we can decide. I couldn’t be any prouder. Any single thing we’ve 
asked them to do throughout the season, they’ve done it. They deserve every 
little bit the celebrations they’ll have.”

What a story this is. They were at rock bottom; they’ve now shot right up 
though the top. Barnsley were the better side today, barring that revival by 
Millwall just before half-time, and played some vibrant stuff. They’ll be fun 
to watch in the second tier if this is anything to go by. They celebrate,
Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> slump to the floor.

and Davies catches it superbly.

87 min: James Wells writes in with some good analysis –

“One has to wonder whether Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> would have conceded the first 
and third goals if they had their first choice defenders, instead of the 
makeshift backline they had to field today through suspension and injury.
“Either way, I think Harris, like Simeone last night went too long without 
making a change to freshen things up and inject some energy back into their 
teams.”


I agree with both points and the second definitely rings true. Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, in the meantime, are pressing 
for a fourth but Winnall can’t convert.

81 min: It’s – yes – a Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>
 corner after a ricochet from far out goes in their favour. First, Fletcher is 
replaced by Ivan Toney. Haven’t seen much of Fletcher in this half but what an 
impact he has had here.

79 min: Onyedinma shows great speed to reach the line but can only run the 
ball out for a goal kick. Again, Barnsley must be praised to the hilt for 
regaining the momentum so superbly here, butMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> can only be disappointed. I 
think the loss of Martin, which effectively lost them Ferguson too, was a big 
moment.

76 min: Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> bring Fred 
Onyedinma on for Thompson. It’s an attacking move but I just don’t think they 
have done enough here. It was understandable that they wouldn’t go hell for 
leather straight after the break but they’ve let Barnsley have the initiative, 
really, and showed none of the proactivity they displayed in the 15 minutes 
before half-time. They’ll regret that.

Goal! Barnsley 3-1 Millwall (Isgrove 74)

That should do it! A good Hammill delivery is glanced behind for a corner on 
the right. Hourihane whips it in, Archer comes out to claim it but, perhaps 
impeded by one of his own defenders, it outjumped by the smallest man on the 
pitch! It’s Isgrove, who flashes a header into the empty net and givesBarnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> a solid foot in the 
Championship!
 Isgrove gets up to meet the corner and smashes it in for Barnsley’s third 
goal. Photograph: Nigel French/PA  And celebrates. Photograph: Martin

Isgrove, coming in towards the far post, and Ferguson has to do his left-back 
duties well. Corner toBarnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, 
but a free-kick is given after it is taken.

69 min: O’Brien has moved to the right flank, it seems. I think losing 
Ferguson’s threat on the left really stalled them.

67 min: Close for Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> – 
at last! Morison gets to O’Brien’s through ball ahead of Davies, rounds him, 
but the angle is tight and he is heading away from goal. He scoops a cross up 
into the six-yard box and it bounces around, nobody can quite clear, but then 
O’Brien turns onto it and finds the recovering Davies well placed to save his 
shot. They need more of that.

very well at the moment. They have not panicked. Hammill goes short, takes the 
return and stands up an inviting cross to the back post but nobody can quite

59 min: Oooh, Gregory is almost let in there, running onto Abdou’s header and 
seeing a defender’s clearance ricochet off him – but Davies collects before the 
striker can react.

57 min: Not the thrill-a-minute fare of earlier but you can see why Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> wouldn’t want to go gung-ho 
just yet. They have time, and they have firepower. But you’d expect them to 
ramp things up after the hour.

right-back getting his angles correct and conceding only a corner. The winger 
gets two bites at it, but Archer claims the second one.

get it towards goal. At the other end, Mawson stops the resulting goal-kick 
finding its way to Morison.

50 min: Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> win another 
corner, Craig coming in to divert a Hammill ball away from Winnall. They have 
started the half well. This time it’s right-sided and Hammill tries a 
training-ground move that results in a little chip towards the near post, but 
it goes wrong and drifts out of play.

48 min: That Ferguson-O’Brien balance will be crucial to Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>, you’d think. Seemed a bit of a 
blow that Ferguson, a lively customer, had been moved to left-back after 
Martin’s injury just before half-time. Can O’Brien take the mantle, and make 
space for Ferguson to roam into?

Nearly ready for the second half here ... will Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> maintain their momentum or can 
Barnsley score what would probably be a decisive third? Barnsley need to stay 
calm, I think, and look for the counter. The players are back out.

Half-time: Barnsley 2-1 Millwall

Well, this has been what you’d want from a play-off final hasn’t it? 
Fletcher’s clinical finish after 88 seconds was followed by a jawdropping 
strike from Hammill and at that stage Barnsley were rampant. ButMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>, to their credit, used their 
experience to dig themselves a foothold and got back into it through Beevers. 
They finished the half on top and if I were you I wouldn’t go anywhere.

45+3 min: Not quite. Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> 
win a late corner from their first real attacking move for some time. Archer 
flaps at Hourihane’s delivery but, it transpires, was impeded.

45+2 min: Ferguson seeks Gregory with a diagonal ball but Davies takes and 
that is probably that for this half.

45 min: More respite for Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> with a free-kick 35 yards out. 
Brownhill tries a speculative one after the ball is laid off to him, but it’s 
high, wide and pretty darn ugly.

43 min: Yes, hamstring. Another defensive change for Millwall then, with the 
left-back leaving the fray now. On comes Aiden O’Brien, a forward, so I think 
that means Ferguson will move to left-back. Will that hinderMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> in two positions – neutralising 
Ferguson’s threat on the wing – or offer them another marauding option from 
full-back?

42 min: Now Millwall’s Martin is down and Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> might be glad of a stoppage or 
two. He seems in a bit of pain – and a replay shows that he went down off the 
ball. Looks like a hamstring....

38 min: Millwall look a totally different side now, playing at a completely 
new intensity, although an unnecessary attempt at trickery by Ferguson scuppers 
another attack.Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, so 
slick for most of the half, could probably use half-time now. But it’s still 
some way away.

their fans again. In by Ferguson, out bravely by Mawson, who is fouled. You

Goal! Barnsley 2-1 Millwall (Beevers 34)

Now then! Ferguson wins a corner, which he then swings out from the left. 
Morison wins the header at the near post, the ball is kept in play at the back 
stick, Craig takes a swipe and miscues into the path of Barnsley-born Beevers, 
who holds off his man cleverly and lashes home! They’d just started to 
threaten, and now they’re right back in it!

31 min: A bit better from Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> as the ball is switched wide to 
Ferguson, probably their main threat so far. He has a run at Scowen but never 
really gets enough space to pick someone out, and his cross from the byline is 
claimed by Davies.

27 min: Not too much noise from the Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> end now. They have two big goal 
threats up top and perhaps have the physical edge but they’ve yet to fashion a 
real chance beyond that early Beevers header, which now looks costly. Barnsley 
have just been fresher, zippier, and deserve the lead.

Congratulations to them, commiserations to a fine Millwall side too, and 
thanks a lot for your company this afternoon – it was a crackingLeague One

Hammill: “An unbelievable feeling, we’ve worked hard since November, 
sacrificed a lot and this is absolutely deserved. I’m made up for all the 
players and staff, they fully deserve it.”

Isgrove: “No better way to top a great season. [The first goal] settled down 
any nerves we had at the start and as soon as we started moving the ball we 
never looked like losing.”

Heckingbottom: “I said we’d wait until after the season [to decide his 
future]. Now we can decide. I couldn’t be any prouder. Any single thing we’ve 
asked them to do throughout the season, they’ve done it. They deserve every 
little bit the celebrations they’ll have.”
 
What a story this is. They were at rock bottom; they’ve now shot right up 
though the top. Barnsley were the better side today, barring that revival by 
Millwall just before half-time, and played some vibrant stuff. They’ll be fun 
to watch in the second tier if this is anything to go by. They celebrate,
Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> slump to the floor.
 
And you would have to say that they fully deserve it.

pain of losing. Photograph: Nigel French/PA  
90+3 min: They do win a corner though, right in the depths of added time now, 
and Davies catches it superbly.
 
90+2 min: It almost opens up for Morison on the left of the area, but 
Brownhill darts in smartly and that was probably the last chance forMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> to offer anything of 
consequence.
 
90 min: Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> are four 
added minutes from promotion.
 
89 min: Hammill almost has the chance for another after good work from Toney, 
but Williams blocks.Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> 
have gone.
 
87 min: James Wells writes in with some good analysis –

“One has to wonder whether Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> would have conceded the first 
and third goals if they had their first choice defenders, instead of the 
makeshift backline they had to field today through suspension and injury.
“Either way, I think Harris, like Simeone last night went too long without 
making a change to freshen things up and inject some energy back into their 
teams.”


I agree with both points and the second definitely rings true. Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, in the meantime, are pressing 
for a fourth but Winnall can’t convert.
 
86 min: And that *was* the chance. O’Brien finds Taylor, who is through on 
Davies, but the ‘keeper gets down well and saves to his right. It needed to go 
in.
 
85 min: That could have been the chance, Morison of all people putting in a 
super cross that O’Brien, where Morison usually would be at the far post, is a 
bit surprised to see reach him and heads behind. Then Isgrove, scorer of what 
is surely the clincher, is replaced by Watkins forBarnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>.
 
83 min: Gregory does well to keep a ball in on the right but nobody can get 
onto his cross. IfMillwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> are 
to make this at all interesting something has to happen now-ish.
 
82 min: Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> will have 
liked that 90-second delay ...and would have liked it even more if another 
imaginative set-piece (and they’ve tried a few) finds its way to Winnall, who 
had peeled back really cleverly, and the striker lashes over.
 
82 min: And a third Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> 
change. Edwards off, Shaun Williams on.
 
81 min: It’s – yes – a Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>
 corner after a ricochet from far out goes in their favour. First, Fletcher is 
replaced by Ivan Toney. Haven’t seen much of Fletcher in this half but what an 
impact he has had here.
 
79 min: Onyedinma shows great speed to reach the line but can only run the 
ball out for a goal kick. Again, Barnsley must be praised to the hilt for 
regaining the momentum so superbly here, butMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> can only be disappointed. I 
think the loss of Martin, which effectively lost them Ferguson too, was a big 
moment.
 
76 min: Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> bring Fred 
Onyedinma on for Thompson. It’s an attacking move but I just don’t think they 
have done enough here. It was understandable that they wouldn’t go hell for 
leather straight after the break but they’ve let Barnsley have the initiative, 
really, and showed none of the proactivity they displayed in the 15 minutes 
before half-time. They’ll regret that.
 
That should do it! A good Hammill delivery is glanced behind for a corner on 
the right. Hourihane whips it in, Archer comes out to claim it but, perhaps 
impeded by one of his own defenders, it outjumped by the smallest man on the 
pitch! It’s Isgrove, who flashes a header into the empty net and givesBarnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> a solid foot in the 
Championship!
 Isgrove gets up to meet the corner and smashes it in for Barnsley’s third 
goal. Photograph: Nigel French/PA  And celebrates. Photograph: Martin 
Dalton/REX/Shutterstock  
72 min: The game is drifting away from Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> a bit. Time to bring on some 
cavalry?
 
71 min: Ooooh, very clever low ball from Hammill all the way across to 
Isgrove, coming in towards the far post, and Ferguson has to do his left-back 
duties well. Corner toBarnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, 
but a free-kick is given after it is taken.
 
69 min: O’Brien has moved to the right flank, it seems. I think losing 
Ferguson’s threat on the left really stalled them.
 
67 min: Close for Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> – 
at last! Morison gets to O’Brien’s through ball ahead of Davies, rounds him, 
but the angle is tight and he is heading away from goal. He scoops a cross up 
into the six-yard box and it bounces around, nobody can quite clear, but then 
O’Brien turns onto it and finds the recovering Davies well placed to save his 
shot. They need more of that.
 Morison goes around Davies. Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/Shutterstock  
65 min: Inviting early wall from Hourihane, bent around the back with Winnall 
lurking at the far post. He can’t quite get there but applauds the very worthy 
intent.
 
63 min: Poor from Taylor though, Davies collecting with no opposition and Neil 
Harris looks unhappy on the touchline.
 
63 min: Agricultural stuff from Roberts out on the left touchline, cleaning 
Gregory out. Free kick, yellow card, chance ...
 Roberts (4) takes out Gregory. Photograph: ProSports/REX/Shutterstock  
62 min: Hammill has another try on his weaker left foot after taking the ball 
a long way, but it’s easy for Archer.
 
60 min: Another corner for Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, who I think are playing this 
very well at the moment. They have not panicked. Hammill goes short, takes the 
return and stands up an inviting cross to the back post but nobody can quite 
get up for it.
 
59 min: Oooh, Gregory is almost let in there, running onto Abdou’s header and 
seeing a defender’s clearance ricochet off him – but Davies collects before the 
striker can react.
 Gregory just fails to reach the through ball. Photograph: 
ProSports/REX/Shutterstock  
57 min: Not the thrill-a-minute fare of earlier but you can see why Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> wouldn’t want to go gung-ho 
just yet. They have time, and they have firepower. But you’d expect them to 
ramp things up after the hour.
 
56 min: Hamill gets a run at Edwards and is shown onto his left foot, the 
right-back getting his angles correct and conceding only a corner. The winger 
gets two bites at it, but Archer claims the second one.
 
54 min: Isgrove crosses from the right and Winnall wins the header but can’t 
get it towards goal. At the other end, Mawson stops the resulting goal-kick 
finding its way to Morison.
 
53 min: Yes, this is what Barnsley would have wanted. No threat from Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> yet in this half and, in 
general, it’s fairly scrappy although Winnall is dropping deep into a few 
pockets and causing bother.
 
51 min: Craig is in again to stop Winnall having a crack, this time on the 
edge of the box. Nothing passive aboutBarnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> here, they’ve come out with 
renewed vim.
 
50 min: Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> win another 
corner, Craig coming in to divert a Hammill ball away from Winnall. They have 
started the half well. This time it’s right-sided and Hammill tries a 
training-ground move that results in a little chip towards the near post, but 
it goes wrong and drifts out of play.
 
48 min: That Ferguson-O’Brien balance will be crucial to Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>, you’d think. Seemed a bit of a 
blow that Ferguson, a lively customer, had been moved to left-back after 
Martin’s injury just before half-time. Can O’Brien take the mantle, and make 
space for Ferguson to roam into?
 
46 min: Good early work by Fletcher down by the right byline, winning a 
corner. In by Hourihane but there’s a foul in there andMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> survive.
 
They have swapped sides, as is convention. Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> have kicked us off.
 
Nearly ready for the second half here ... will Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> maintain their momentum or can 
Barnsley score what would probably be a decisive third? Barnsley need to stay 
calm, I think, and look for the counter. The players are back out.
 
If you’re an exiled Barnsley or Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> fan – or even if you aren’t – 
then don’t be shy. How are you feeling?
 
Well, this has been what you’d want from a play-off final hasn’t it? 
Fletcher’s clinical finish after 88 seconds was followed by a jawdropping 
strike from Hammill and at that stage Barnsley were rampant. ButMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>, to their credit, used their 
experience to dig themselves a foothold and got back into it through Beevers. 
They finished the half on top and if I were you I wouldn’t go anywhere.
 
45+3 min: Not quite. Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> 
win a late corner from their first real attacking move for some time. Archer 
flaps at Hourihane’s delivery but, it transpires, was impeded.
 
45+2 min: Ferguson seeks Gregory with a diagonal ball but Davies takes and 
that is probably that for this half.
 
45+1 min: Edwards throws long from far, far up the pitch and it comes to 
nothing. Three minutes added here.
 
45 min: More respite for Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> with a free-kick 35 yards out. 
Brownhill tries a speculative one after the ball is laid off to him, but it’s 
high, wide and pretty darn ugly.
 
44 min: No, calf. But still. Martin’s off.
 
43 min: Yes, hamstring. Another defensive change for Millwall then, with the 
left-back leaving the fray now. On comes Aiden O’Brien, a forward, so I think 
that means Ferguson will move to left-back. Will that hinderMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> in two positions – neutralising 
Ferguson’s threat on the wing – or offer them another marauding option from 
full-back?
 
42 min: Now Millwall’s Martin is down and Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> might be glad of a stoppage or 
two. He seems in a bit of pain – and a replay shows that he went down off the 
ball. Looks like a hamstring....
 
40 min: Clash of heads near halfway and Winnall is down, but gets up and does 
not appear to need treatment.
 
38 min: Millwall look a totally different side now, playing at a completely 
new intensity, although an unnecessary attempt at trickery by Ferguson scuppers 
another attack.Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley>, so 
slick for most of the half, could probably use half-time now. But it’s still 
some way away.
 
37 min: Another left-sided corner for Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall>, who are now being roared on by 
their fans again. In by Ferguson, out bravely by Mawson, who is fouled. You 
know all the things you want in a play-off final? This game has them. It’s 
superb.
 
Now then! Ferguson wins a corner, which he then swings out from the left. 
Morison wins the header at the near post, the ball is kept in play at the back 
stick, Craig takes a swipe and miscues into the path of Barnsley-born Beevers, 
who holds off his man cleverly and lashes home! They’d just started to 
threaten, and now they’re right back in it!

33 min: Morison wins a header and again Taylor has a glimmer, but Mawson 
defends well. A few little sights forMillwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> in the last few minutes, a bit 
more cohesion, but they have to score the next goal.
 
32 min: Superbly in now by Scowen, as Gregory and Taylor link up on the edge 
of the area. He gets in to deny the latter, and then Edwards’ latest howitzer 
is headed out.
 
31 min: A bit better from Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> as the ball is switched wide to 
Ferguson, probably their main threat so far. He has a run at Scowen but never 
really gets enough space to pick someone out, and his cross from the byline is 
claimed by Davies.
 
29 min: After a little break while Taylor has some treatment, Edwards pumps 
the free-kick forwards but Winnall is there to head away.
 
28 min: Late from Williams on Chris Taylor just inside the Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> half, and the Barnsley man is 
rightly booked.
 
27 min: Not too much noise from the Millwall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> end now. They have two big goal 
threats up top and perhaps have the physical edge but they’ve yet to fashion a 
real chance beyond that early Beevers header, which now looks costly. Barnsley 
have just been fresher, zippier, and deserve the lead.
