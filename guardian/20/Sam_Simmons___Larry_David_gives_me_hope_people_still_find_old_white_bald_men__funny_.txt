The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 

Judith Lucy, a total genius Australian comedian. She is so very, very dry, and 
so very, very bitter, she could honestly give any of yours a run.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 

Numberwang from That Mitchell And Webb Look. I don’t know who was responsible 
for this sketch but it’s very funny. Oh, and Birds by the Look Around You crew.

The funniest person I know 

My mother, she is pure evil propped up by a frilly apricot U-shaped pillow, 
devouring Danielle Steel novels and spitting venom from her bed.

The funniest word 

Tolerance. Especially in respect to people who are “tolerant” of race: “Yes 
I’lltolerate that ethnic group.”

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen 

Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry David gives me hope that people still find old 
white bald men funny.

The funniest book I’ve ever read 

Hop On Pop by Dr Seuss, I love the bit where he hops on Pop. The simplicity of 
his thought is brilliant. Looking for a solution in Gaza? Try reading about the 
Zax.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen 

Step Brothers starring John C Reilly and Will Ferrell playing 39-year-old 
children. It’s embarrassing how much I love this movie.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 

Parachute pants coupled with a Hypercolor T-shirt, a horrific fad in Oz in the 
early 90s where the colour of the T-shirt would change with heat, so your 
armpits would glow a hot neon pink.

The funniest number 

Twelve: a terrible awkward age, the countdown to the horror of Christmas, end 
of a good night.

The funniest dream I’ve ever had 

I once dreamed I was a celebrity chef who baked cakes in the shape of vaginas. 
I was pretty disappointed when I woke up.
