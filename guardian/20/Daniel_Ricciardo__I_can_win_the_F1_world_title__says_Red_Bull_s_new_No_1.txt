Australian Formula One ace Daniel Ricciardo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daniel-ricciardo> is now on a mission to win 
the world title after his breakout season.

Ricciardo won three races in his first year at Infiniti Red Bull and finished 
third in the championship standings.

The 25-year-old from Western Australia said he has raised his sights and now 
considers himself a title contender.

“I definitely think I can,” he said. “It’s a long season and a lot comes into 
play, but I definitely believe if I got the opportunity and the equipment 
behind me, then I can do it.

“I proved this year I’m a race winner and can race hard at the front and deal 
with the pressure.”

He is now the number one driver at Red Bull after four-time world champion 
Sebastian Vettel moved to Ferrari

Ricciardo was speaking at Thursday’s launch of the 2015 Melbourne Grand Prix, 
on 15 March.

He famously started this season by finishing second at Albert Park, only for 
officials to disqualify him

.

“Looking back, what happened on Sunday night here, if anything, just fuelled a 
bigger fire which was already in me,” he said.

“It served me well for the rest of the season. It gave me a taste and then 
took it away, so it made me want to get back there.

“I’m already hanging out for March – try and get a little bit of redemption.”

Ricciardo added that the Albert Park circuit suited him, saying it was one of 
his three favourite F1 venues.

The affable F1 pilot also said the added weight of public expectation would 
not be a burden.

Next March will be the 20th race in Melbourne since it was moved from Adelaide.

“It honestly doesn’t change the way I feel or my approach,” he said. “I’m 
aware there will always be a bit more hype.

“If anything, at the home race, it’s a little bit easier to stay motivated - 
more or less the whole home crowd is behind me. It’s not more difficult.”
