My earliest memory of a backstage space is a bunch of us crouched behind an 
overturned table in a school library, where I had created a play about 
something or other – The Wizard Of Oz, I think. I must have been about eight. 
The invisible but ever so tangible line between backstage and on stage can be 
terrifying to cross, especially when you have to immediately say something like 
“To be or not to be”, or “Now is the winter of our discontent.” It is the 
nearest I come in this life, I sometimes imagine, to being born and dying.

To be backstage during a play is to be in a twofold world of secrecy and 
revelation. It is to live in two periods at once: the time of your own life and 
the time of the character you are playing. There is a similar feeling in 
standing next to a river, a bonfire, on a platform when a fast train is 
approaching, or, I imagine, beside an open door on an aeroplane.

Backstage, I always have one ear to the house, judging the energy of the 
audience from their response to other scenes, enjoying the innovations and 
discoveries of my fellow actors, and privately harnessing the aspects of 
myself, the thoughts and actions, that are appropriate for my character. In 
Twelfth Night,I was playing the Countess Olivia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/18/twelfth-night-richard-iii-review>
, a grieving aristocrat who has inherited control of her house and its 
difficult occupants after the death of her beloved father and brother.

Enjoying a run of full houses – well, there’s nothing like it. It is like 
sailing a fast ship on a sunny, windy day

Just as there is a certain ritual to the action on stage, so there is 
backstage. The quiet preparation for an entrance, the quick costume change, the 
motivated exit that deflates rapidly in the dark, the jubilant energy you get 
with an expressive audience, the relaxed energy of actors who have finished 
their part and are waiting for the final call, the regular absence from the 
stage that allows for reading, correspondence or games of ping pong: all the 
backstage after-and-before shadows exactly what happens on stage; it is both a 
private and a social space.

The experience is at its best during an ensemble play such as Twelfth Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/01/stephen-fry-twelfth-night-all-male>
. Every company is an ensemble, but some plays are not so evenly shared between 
as many players. In this production, the ensemble was enriched because many of 
us had worked together regularly over a number of years. Directed by Tim 
Carroll, we used as many of the known practices of Shakespeare’s day as we 
could, trying not to do anything they couldn’t have. Hence we were an all-male 
company, with three of us playing female roles. We used authentic makeup, 
including silk wigs, and performed in a shared candlelight on a wooden stage: 
no scenery, minimal props and furniture.

The Belasco <http://www.shubertorganization.com/theatres/belasco/> theatre, 
where these pictures were taken, is an old Broadway house with a large stage. 
We had room in the wings for two oak “standings”, an old Elizabethan term for 
raised platforms on which an audience could stand or sit. All our entrances 
were via two doors in a reconstructed oak screen, which also provided a high 
gallery for our musicians.

But we didn’t choose the Belasco for its size; we chose it for the great space 
underneath the stage, where those who wished could dress together, and where we 
could have a ping pong table and post-show social club (sometimes during the 
show as well). I had heard that Houdini had created this deep space under the 
Belasco, to enable an elephant to disappear by dropping through a trapdoor into 
a tank of water. My friends there denied this, but there was certainly room. It 
was so cold that winter, we spent many a memorable late evening in our Houdini 
cave, after the play had finished, playing ping pong and table football, 
entertaining guests. At our Christmas party,Stephen Fry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-fry> donned his Santa Claus suit 
and passed out the gifts.

A good theatre feels like a great ship. Front of house, its stalls, circle and 
balcony, are like three great sails filled each day with the imaginative life 
of an audience. Backstage feels like life below decks. Enjoying a run of full 
houses – well, there’s nothing like it, in all the different jobs I have been 
lucky enough to experience, perhaps nothing like it in life. It is like sailing 
a fast ship on a sunny, windy day.

Over the years, we must have performed Twelfth Night at least 300 times in 
different formations, with actors leaving and returning, or moving to different 
parts. Some have grown too old to play their part, such as our first Viola,
Eddie Redmayne <https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne>. Some have 
passed, bless them. In New York, some, such as Stephen Fry, were joining us for 
the first time. It was for me the most mature, humorous and accomplished 
ensemble I have worked with; I trust we will perform a few more before we are 
done.
