This documentary about the rise and fall of Tommy Byrne 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Byrne_(racing_driver)>, a talented but 
troubled also-ran on the motor racing circuit, is most interesting for the 
insight it gives into the ugly, elitist attitudes in Formula One. But unlike 
Asif Kapadia’sSenna, there’s not much here to recommend the film to non-fans of 
the sport.
Watch a trailer for Crash and Burn.
