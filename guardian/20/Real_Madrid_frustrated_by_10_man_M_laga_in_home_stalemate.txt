A toothless Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> were 
held 0-0 at home by 10-man Málaga as Rafa Benítez’s side relinquished the lead 
of La Liga.

Real pushed forward from the start but a combination of fine goalkeeping from 
Carlos Kameni and near misses prevented them from breaking the deadlock.

Málaga’s most dangerous player Nordin Amrabat was sent off for elbowing 
Marcelo after 76 minutes, but Real could not find a way through, and it was a 
frustrating match for Cristiano Ronaldo and his fellow forwards.
