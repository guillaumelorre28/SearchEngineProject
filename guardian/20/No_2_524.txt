 Age: 55. 
 What's up, another middle-aged rock star gone completely mad? Not at all. Mr 
Wakeman is a responsible citizen, and devoted his only UK concert this year to 
charity.

 And the deserving cause was?  The Conservative party. 

 Oh! I'm sorry ... I didn't know. Few know of Mr Wakeman's selfless work among 
the forgotten ones, the neglected and dispossessed of British society.

 You mean he... He goes among them? Yes. This week he lends his star quality 
to the Tory party conference.

 Wow. Blair must be jealous, he could only get Bono. Yeah, and Michael Howard 
gets to meet the man who left and rejoined prog-rock legends Yes five times, 
co-invented the Birotron electronic keyboard, and made the official soundtrack 
to the 1982 World Cup, G'ol√©!

 I remember it well.  Who doesn't? Besides, Wakeman's played as a session 
musician for Lou Reed, David Bowie, the Clash, Black Sabbath, Brotherhood of 
Man, and the Honourable Nicholas Soames MP (Con, Mid-Sussex).

 I find that hard to believe. I made it up about the Clash. 

 Wait! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Howard deposed in a coup - huge 
light show, big chords - man with long blond hair bounds on to the stage - 
starts playing five keyboards at once - it's the new Tory leader!

 I'm not sure the party's quite ready for Boris Johnson. I was thinking about 
Rick.

 But what's his message? School discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, 
lower taxes, controlled immigration, a Birotron in every home.

 Don't say: "Given the choice between Howard's 47-minute keynote address and 
Yes's 18-minute prog-rock masterpiece Close to the Edge, I choose the 
wrist-slashing option.

 Do say:  "Oh, are you the pop chappie? Marvellous, marvellous, absolutely 
splendid. Prefer Classic FM myself, but my granddaughter simply adores that 
Dodo woman."
