Hoffenheim on loan for the rest of the season.

Much was expected of the 24-year-old when the club beat Chelsea to the 
striker’s signature last January

 and want to play my part in keeping the team up.”

Kramaric has made only five appearances this season, with his only goal coming

Claudio Ranieri <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/claudio-ranieri> 
understands the striker’s desperation to get first-team football, especially 
with Croatia playing at Euro 2016.

“Andrej has the European Championships to think about this summer, so it’s 
important for him that he has the opportunity to play,” he said. “He is a 
fantastic player and a great professional but, in this moment, we have other 
strikers that are playing well. I spoke with him to understand what he wants to 
do and a loan is a solution that works for everybody. We will watch him closely 
at Hoffenheim.”
