Most IQ tests involve answering a whole load of difficult questions. But 
here’s one with just two. Best of all, they’re simple:

1. Does living in a crowded area get you down?
(a) a lot (b) a bit (c) not at all

2. Would you prefer to socialise with friends every day as opposed to just 
once or twice a week?
(a) hell, yeah! (b) maybe a bit (c) no

If you said (b) or (c) for the first question and (c) for the second, then you 
are showing the response pattern typical of intelligent people. In general, 
living in an area with high-population density is associated with lower levels 
of life satisfaction. However, the study on which this quiz is based found that 
high-population density had a larger negative effect for the lower IQ group (an 
average of 81, as measured by a standard IQ test) than the higher IQ group (an 
average of 116). Standard IQ tests are designed so that the average for the 
population as a whole is 100.


What is more, hanging out with friends every day, as opposed to just a couple 
of times a week, is associated with greater life satisfaction among the lower 
IQ group but lower satisfaction among the brainboxes. Interestingly, these 
geniuses don’t seem to be smart enough to recognise what makes them happy. The 
study found intelligent people tended to socialise more often than less 
intelligent people, even though they generally derived less pleasure – and more 
irritation – from doing so.
