Lionel Messi handed his strike-partner Luis Suárez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/luis-suarez> a hat-trick on a plate with 
an audaciously taken penalty as Barcelona beat Celta Vigo 6-1 in La Liga on 
Sunday.

The Argentina superstar rolled his 81st-minute spot-kick into Suárez’s path to 
allow him to complete his treble as the hosts at Camp Nou recovered from a 
low-key start to win in style and maintain top place. Had Messi scored the 
penalty himself, it would have been his 300thLa Liga

Barça were far from their fluent best before the break but took a 20th-minute 
lead when Messi, having gone close with an earlier attempt, curled a superb 
free-kick over the wall and beyond keeper Sergio Álvarez’s despairing dive.

But the lead was extinguished six minutes before the break when, having been 
tripped by Jordi Alba, the Celta striker John Guidetti scored the resulting 
penalty despite goalkeeper Claudio Bravo going the right way.

Suárez restored the home side’s lead when he played a delicious 59th-minute 
one-two with Messi and nonchalantly dispatched the return pass, and it was 3-1 
15 minutes from time when he stabbed Neymar’s shot over the line after Messi 
and the Brazilian had torn the visitors apart.

The Uruguay striker completed his hat-trick in outrageous fashion and further 
goals from substitute Ivan Rakitic and Neymar completed the rout.
