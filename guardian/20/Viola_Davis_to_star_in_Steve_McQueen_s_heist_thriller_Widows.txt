Viola Davis has paired up with 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen> for the film-maker’s 
forthcoming heist thriller Widows.

Based on the 1983 British miniseries of the same name, from Prime Suspect’s 
Lynda La Plante, the adaptation will boast a screenplay from Gone Girl writer 
Gillian Flynn, who is co-writing the film with McQueen.

Like the show, the film will center on four armed robbers who get killed in a 
failed heist attempt, leaving their widows to finish the job using their 
husbands’ notebooks as guidance. Davis will probably play one of the widows, 
althoughVariety 
<http://variety.com/2016/film/news/viola-davis-steve-mcqueen-widows-1201862194/>
, the outlet that broke the news, hasn’t confirmed her role.

Widows marks McQueen’s first film since winning the best picture Oscar for 12 
Years a Slave in 2014. The slavery drama won an additional two Oscars, for best 
supporting actress (Lupita Nyong’o) and best adapted screenplay (John Ridley).

McQueen is said to have completed the pilot for Codes of Conduct

, an HBO series about a black man rising through high society in New York. That 
project, set to star Devon Terrell, Helena Bonham Carter and Rebecca Hall, has, 
however, been put on the back burner, per Variety, to allow McQueen to place 
all of his focus on Widows.

Jennifer Lawrence is rumored to have been approached to co-star alongside 
Davis but was forced to pass due to scheduling conflicts.

McQueen, meanwhile, says he also has plans to shoot a film about the black 
American actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson

I wanted to make the second afterHunger

didn’t have the juice.”

Davis most recently starred in the summer hit Suicide Squad. She can also be 
seen in the current third season of ABC’s show How to Get Away With Murder.
