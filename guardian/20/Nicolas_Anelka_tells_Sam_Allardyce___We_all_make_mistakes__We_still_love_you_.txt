 following the overnight news that Allardyce had left his post.

He said: “So sorry for this story big sam! U were the right man for England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> and I still believe u are! 
Doesn’t matter what u did or what u said we all do mistakes … The most 
important is we still love u! Thanks for everything”.

Anelka, whose peripatetic career took him to 11 clubs, including two spells at 
Paris Saint-Germain, was sacked by West Bromwich in 2014following his use of 
the allegedly antisemitic ‘quenelle’ gesture when celebrating a goal

. His postings on social media during the case was cited by the club as one of 
the reasons for terminating his contract.
