Eintracht Frankfurt <https://www.theguardian.com/football/eintrachtfrankfurt> 
are in talks with the Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner over a possible £3m 
transfer.

The Bundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> club 
said on its website that it had held "concluding talks" with the 25-year-old 
Dane and his agents on Tuesday. Bendtner joined Arsenal eight years ago but has 
not played for them since August 2011, having been sent on season-long loans to 
Sunderland and Juventus.

Frankfurt added that their sporting director Bruno Hübner was in "close 
contact" with Arsène Wenger and a decision would be made "in the next couple of 
days".
