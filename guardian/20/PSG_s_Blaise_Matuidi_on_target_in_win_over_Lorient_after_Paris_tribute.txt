Paris St Germain took another step towards a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title 
when they beatLorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> 2-1 away 
on Saturday thanks to first-half goals from Hervin Ongenda and Blaise Matuidi.

PSG have 38 points from 14 games and lead second-placed Olympique Lyonnais, 
who slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Nice on Friday, by 13 points after a routine win.

The league’s top scorer, Benjamin Moukandjo, pulled a goal back late on as 
Lorient stayed seventh on 20 points.

There was a release of doves and a minute’s silence before kick-off to honour 
the 130 victims of last week’s Paris attacks.

With PSG sitting on a comfortable lead at the top of the league, their coach, 
Laurent Blanc, gave Ongenda his first start of the season and the 20-year-old 
striker did not disappoint.

He tapped home in the 26th minute from Gregory van der Wiel’s cross as the 
visitors took a deserved lead.

Ongenda then played a one-two with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose cross was netted 
by Matuidi from point-blank range in the 32nd.

Moukandjo leapfrogged Ibrahimovic at the top of the scoring charts by heading 
home his 10th goal of the season from Romain Philippoteaux’s cross.
