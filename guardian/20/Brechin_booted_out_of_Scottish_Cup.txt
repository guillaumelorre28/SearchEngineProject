Brechin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brechin> City have been kicked 
out of the Scottish Cup after it emerged that the club fielded two ineligible 
players in their fourth-round win over Hamilton Academicals.

City, currently mid-table in the Second Division were due to play a 
potentially money-spinning tie against Aberdeen in the last 16, but Hamilton, 
currently sitting at the top of the First Division, will now take their place 
against the Dons for a spot in the quarter-finals.

The Scottish FA initially ordered a replay and handed Brechin a Â£10,000 fine 
after it became clear that Michael Paton - on loan from Aberdeen - should not 
have played in City's 2-1 extra-time win on January 28. When the Scottish FA 
then discovered that Willie Dyer was also not eligible they sent Hamilton 
through in Brechin's stead.

Both players arrived at the club after the original 0-0 draw at Hamilton on 
January 12. Only players registered before the initial tie are permitted to 
play in replays.
