McCafferty, who lives in Belfast, said: “I understand it was wrong. I was 
wrong and I did wrong and I am sorry. I have remorse. I know if I’m found 
guilty I will have to serve time, and I’ve said to myself that’s what I’ll have 
to pay back for what I’ve done. I’m OK with that. I hope that will cleanse my 
soul.”

The coach admitted his guilt to the paper after preying on teenagers in the 
1980s and 90s while coaching boys’ and junior teams in West Lothian. He also 
told the newspaper he abused young players at Celtic between 1990 and 1996.

McCafferty gave the Daily Record the names of five of his victims but has 
stated there were around a dozen boys in total whom he preyed on. He said he 
never raped boys but admitted sexually touching their private parts. He 
admitted to regular sexual contact, including fondling and masturbation, with 
his victims.

“I’ve regretted it for years. It has haunted me and I’ve not had a good 
night’s sleep for a long time,” McCafferty said. “Tonight, I feel unburdened.”

When asked why he had decided to confess, he said: “Now I can take a breath 
again. My concern is if someone hurts me when I’m walking down the street.”
