Spurs played sporadically reasonably. Kane should have equalised in the second 
half, but there were few chances. In the first 10 minutes they attacked down 
the right three times, but then they gave up on enterprising wing-play and got 
stuck in a rut in the middle of the pitch. The defending for both Monaco goals 
was disappointing at best, though they were well taken.Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> lost 4-1 at White Hart Lane in 
the Europa League last December, but this was a significantly slicker 
performance.

A couple of disappointed Spurs players talk to BTSport. Firstly, Toby 
ALderweireld:

We scored and created some kind of momentum. In the second half we were much 
better, had chances to win the game but the goal wouldn’t come. We put a lot of 
energy into it, but we couldn’t force anything. For us now we have to get a 
good result away from home, and then three points at home.

And then Dele Alli:

I thought we started poorly today and they punished us for it. But I think we 
did enough to win the game today, we just didn’t take the chances. They’re a 
great team and they’re hard to play against. But we dominated the game in the 
second half, we’ve done what we needed to do, but we just couldn’t score. We 
just need to pick ourselves up now and make sure we win the next game.

87 mins: Space opens up behind Monaco’s defence, and Sissoko sprints into it, 
but Janssen’s pass is overhit, and Subasic gets there first. As Jenas points 
out on co-commentary, even a half-decent pass would have given the Frenchman a 
great goalscoring chance then.

Sidibé and Lemar in particular – have had excellent games.

84 mins: Lemar goes on another lithe run down the right, and when Spurs clear 
his cross Alli gives it right away again. They then hog the ball for a while, 
until Andrea Raggi attempts an over-ambitious pass and fluffs it.

81 mins: Sidibé goes on a thrilling run down the left, tricking and sprinting 
past Walker, but his cross is deflected straight to Lloris. Still, fine running.

79 mins: Spurs fashion a great chance! And Kane fluffs it! Janssen does the 
running, huffing and puffing down the right, spinning past Jemerson and passing 
inside to Kane, who works the ball onto his left foot, pulls back his leg and, 
with the goal gaping, thumps the ball straight at Subasic.
 It’s close but no cigar for Harry Kane. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images

74 mins: Lemar is given the ball in the right-hand corner of the pitch, and 
dances around the perimeter of the box until he’s within left-foot-shooting 
distance of goal, whereupon he has a shot with his left foot. It’s blocked, 
loops into the air, and lands in Lloris’s arms.

72 mins: Dele Alli goes on a lovely run down the left. He doesn’t do much with 
the ball, but he swerves his body this way and that, flummoxing all defenders 
who dare to cross his patch, before randomly and for no obvious reason 
forgetting to stop the ball rolling gently out of play.

but the pass is overhit and it goes out of play. It has, over the last few

themselves for a while. Or at least until they get into the Spurs half, when 
they lose it.

the box isn’t a PK if the corner hasn’t been taken yet? And the logic behind 
that?” asks Evan Haas. If the ball isn’t in play, you can’t concede a penalty. 
Or a free kick. Or anything else. But you can still get yourself booked or 
indeed sent off.

repeatedly rap on theMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> door.

55 mins: As Spurs prepare to take the corner, Fabinho and Alli tussle, and the 
Englishman falls over. The referee waves a card. For a while there’s a 
suspicion that he had also given a penalty, andMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> players look utterly horrified, 
though given that the corner hadn’t been taken at the time that was never 
really an option.
 Dele Alli goes to ground. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  The 
Monaco players plead with the fifth official but they needn’t have worried as 
the ball wasn’t in play so the “offence” doesn’t count. Photograph: Tom Jenkins

That was a fun half of football, though Tottenham fans might not agree. Given 
the scoreline, more drama is surely guaranteed in half two.

Good half that. Every detail easily explainable by Wembley, the size of the

The whistle blows, the crowd roars, and that atmosphere at the break has been 
totally changed by that late Spurs goal.

45+3 mins: Spurs have the wind in their sails now. Lamela gets forward, but 
his cross is to nobody very much. Then he crosses again, with his left foot 
this time, and Alli flings a boot at the ball and only just misses!

GOAL! Tottenham 1-2 Monaco (Alderweireld, 45 mins)

And Lamela’s corner is headed in by Toby Alderweireld! He runs to the near 
post, outjumps Glik, and thumps the ball goalwards!

26 mins: Walker, picked out by Eriksen’s lovely lofted pass, crosses nicely, 
but it’s headed clearish and when it’s worked back to Walker there must be some 
weird spinny stuff going on because the ball bounces weirdly and confuses him.

And with that, I’m off. Here’s David Hytner’s match report from Wembley. Bye!

Tottenham left to lament Wembley woes after Lemar strikes for Monaco

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-monaco-champions-league-group-e-match-report> 
Spurs played sporadically reasonably. Kane should have equalised in the second 
half, but there were few chances. In the first 10 minutes they attacked down 
the right three times, but then they gave up on enterprising wing-play and got 
stuck in a rut in the middle of the pitch. The defending for both Monaco goals 
was disappointing at best, though they were well taken.Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> lost 4-1 at White Hart Lane in 
the Europa League last December, but this was a significantly slicker 
performance.
 
The other game in this group tonight ended Leverkusen 2-2 CSKA Moscow, with 
the home side taking a two-goal lead in the first 15 minutes and then losing it 
again before half-time.
 
A couple of disappointed Spurs players talk to BTSport. Firstly, Toby 
ALderweireld:

We scored and created some kind of momentum. In the second half we were much 
better, had chances to win the game but the goal wouldn’t come. We put a lot of 
energy into it, but we couldn’t force anything. For us now we have to get a 
good result away from home, and then three points at home.

And then Dele Alli:

I thought we started poorly today and they punished us for it. But I think we 
did enough to win the game today, we just didn’t take the chances. They’re a 
great team and they’re hard to play against. But we dominated the game in the 
second half, we’ve done what we needed to do, but we just couldn’t score. We 
just need to pick ourselves up now and make sure we win the next game.
 
90+4 mins: And that’s it! Tottenham bring 85,000 people to Wembley, but not 
their A-game, and are beaten.

win. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA  
90+4 mins: Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> convert that 
free kick into a throw-in, 40 seconds later.
 
90+3 mins: With 30 seconds to play, Alderweireld commits a foul on the halfway 
line, and that should be that.
 
90+1 mins: Vertonghen wins the header, but finds neither power nor the target.
 
90+1 mins: We’re in stoppage time, and there’ll be about three minutes of it. 
It’s do or die time for Spurs, and they start it with another corner.
 
87 mins: Space opens up behind Monaco’s defence, and Sissoko sprints into it, 
but Janssen’s pass is overhit, and Subasic gets there first. As Jenas points 
out on co-commentary, even a half-decent pass would have given the Frenchman a 
great goalscoring chance then.
 
86 mins: Spurs have a 10-0 lead on corners, and a 64.9%-35.1% possession 
advantage. Still, this has been a fine away performance fromMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco>, and several of their players – 
Sidibé and Lemar in particular – have had excellent games.
 
84 mins: Lemar goes on another lithe run down the right, and when Spurs clear 
his cross Alli gives it right away again. They then hog the ball for a while, 
until Andrea Raggi attempts an over-ambitious pass and fluffs it.
 
83 mins: There is no momentum in this game at the moment. It’s bitty and 
disjointed.
 The Monaco defence deal adequately with the threat of a mis-firing Harry 
Kane. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  
81 mins: Substitutions for both teams: Tottenham bring Moussa Sissoko on for 
Dier, andMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> bring Valère 
Germain on for Falcao, who still does not appear to be injured, but you can’t 
be sure.
 
81 mins: Sidibé goes on a thrilling run down the left, tricking and sprinting 
past Walker, but his cross is deflected straight to Lloris. Still, fine running.
 
79 mins: Spurs fashion a great chance! And Kane fluffs it! Janssen does the 
running, huffing and puffing down the right, spinning past Jemerson and passing 
inside to Kane, who works the ball onto his left foot, pulls back his leg and, 
with the goal gaping, thumps the ball straight at Subasic.

77 mins: Walker’s cross is headed out to Alli at the edge of the area, but his 
shot is curly and pretty but weak and easily saved.
 
74 mins: Lemar is given the ball in the right-hand corner of the pitch, and 
dances around the perimeter of the box until he’s within left-foot-shooting 
distance of goal, whereupon he has a shot with his left foot. It’s blocked, 
loops into the air, and lands in Lloris’s arms.
 
72 mins: Dele Alli goes on a lovely run down the left. He doesn’t do much with 
the ball, but he swerves his body this way and that, flummoxing all defenders 
who dare to cross his patch, before randomly and for no obvious reason 
forgetting to stop the ball rolling gently out of play.
 
71 mins: A substitution for Spurs, who take off Lamela and bring on Vincent 
Janssen.
 
68 mins: Alderweireld brings the ball out of defence, then takes a heavy touch 
and gives it away for little reason.Monaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> try to play in Bernardo Silva, 
but the pass is overhit and it goes out of play. It has, over the last few 
minutes, become that kind of game.
 
65 mins: A lengthy period in which Spurs dominated and didn’t win any corners 
ends eventually with an intriguingMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> semi-break in which no one ever 
seems to have the ball under control but they still manage to work it among 
themselves for a while. Or at least until they get into the Spurs half, when 
they lose it.
  A concerned looking Mauricio Pochettino looks on from the touchline as Spurs 
try to find a way back into the game. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  
61 mins: This one is sent into the mixer, and then headed out of it again.
 
61 mins: This is played short, worked around a bit, and then Eriksen is 
tackled by Falcao, who still isn’t injured. Another corner.
 
60 mins: From this one Dembélé’s low shot is deflected wide. Another cross.
 
60 mins: Nothing comes of the corner, and the ball goes back to the halfway 
line, then Spurs come forward again, and win another corner.
 
58 mins: Another Spurs corner. “Can someone explain why a yellow card foul in 
the box isn’t a PK if the corner hasn’t been taken yet? And the logic behind 
that?” asks Evan Haas. If the ball isn’t in play, you can’t concede a penalty. 
Or a free kick. Or anything else. But you can still get yourself booked or 
indeed sent off.
 
58 mins: Tottenham have a bit of wind in their sails now, and are starting to 
repeatedly rap on theMonaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> door. 
Traditionally, this is when they concede two goals.
 
55 mins: As Spurs prepare to take the corner, Fabinho and Alli tussle, and the 
Englishman falls over. The referee waves a card. For a while there’s a 
suspicion that he had also given a penalty, andMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> players look utterly horrified, 
though given that the corner hadn’t been taken at the time that was never 
really an option.
 Dele Alli goes to ground. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  The 
Monaco players plead with the fifth official but they needn’t have worried as 
the ball wasn’t in play so the “offence” doesn’t count. Photograph: Tom Jenkins 
for the Guardian  
54 mins: Kane is played in down ye olde inside right channel, cuts onto his 
left foot, ignores a couple of team-mates in the middle, and shoots into the 
legs of the diving, blocking Jemerson.
 
53 mins: The official attendance is in. And it’s quite big.

51 mins: Eriksen hits the wall.
 
51 mins: Eriksen and Lamela stand over the ball, looking threatening. It’s 
about 25 yards out.
 
50 mins: All is brought down by Glik, who is booked and proceeds to give the 
referee a mouthful of vitriol. You wouldn’t get away with that in the Premier 
League, son.
 
49 mins: That 47th-minute Eriksen cross followed a lovely bit of nutmeggery 
from Dele Alli.
 
49 mins: Ooooh! Alli slams a 20-yard shot that was dipping below the bar 
before Subasic tips it over!
 
48 mins: Ooh! Eriksen crosses from the left and Kane is straining his neck 
muscles before Jemerson flicks it to safety.
 
47 mins: Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> start brightly, 
but after several smart passes Sidibé’s cross from the left is emphatically 
overhit.
 
46 mins: They’re off! Again!
 
A half-time substitution for Spurs: Mousa Dembélé is coming on, and Son 
Heung-Min is off.
 
That was a fun half of football, though Tottenham fans might not agree. Given 
the scoreline, more drama is surely guaranteed in half two.
 Barney Ronay (@barneyronay) 
Good half that. Every detail easily explainable by Wembley, the size of the 
pitch, foreigners being unfairly inspired etc etc

The whistle blows, the crowd roars, and that atmosphere at the break has been 
totally changed by that late Spurs goal.
 
45+3 mins: Spurs have the wind in their sails now. Lamela gets forward, but 
his cross is to nobody very much. Then he crosses again, with his left foot 
this time, and Alli flings a boot at the ball and only just misses!
 
45+2 mins: This came in before the Tottenham goal, but the answer’s still the 
same.

45+1 mins: There will be about three minutes of stoppage time.
 
And Lamela’s corner is headed in by Toby Alderweireld! He runs to the near 
post, outjumps Glik, and thumps the ball goalwards!

Guardian  Toby Alderweireld celebrates scoring their first goal with Erik 
Lamela. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters  
45 mins: Kane wins a corner on the right, which is good a moment as his side 
have had for a while.
 
42 mins: There’s a slightly mournful chorus of When the Spurs Go Marching In 
echoing around Wembley at the moment. Spurs started well, but for the last 20 
minutes or so they’ve been very flat.
 
38 mins: Spurs fans were asked to wear white to the match tonight, to match 
the flag their defence would be waving.
 
37 mins: Dier gives the ball away, and Falcao sets off on a run towards the 
Spurs area that ends with Alderweireld getting his body in front of the ball, 
and then booting it out of play.
 
35 mins: Kane exhibits a textbook innocentface after sliding in late on 
Fabinho and getting booked.
 
34 mins: Falcao just touched the ball. He then looked over his shoulder, saw 
Alderweireld bearing down on him, and paused to win a free kick. He remains 
uninjured.
 
Oh. Sidibé crosses from the left, Lemar’s header hits Vertonghen in the back 
and he latches onto the rebound and crashes a left-foot volley into the roof of 
the net.
