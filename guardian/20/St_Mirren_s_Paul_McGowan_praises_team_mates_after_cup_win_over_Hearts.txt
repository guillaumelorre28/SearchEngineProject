St Mirren's midfielder Paul McGowan believes the players did the club proud by 
ending a 26-year wait for a trophy in winning theScottish League Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup> at Hampden Park on 
Sunday.

Goals from EsmaÃ«l Goncalves, Steven Thompson and Conor Newton outstripped a 
double from Hearts' Ryan Stevenson to cement a 3-2 victory for Danny Lennon's 
Buddies.

The trophy was St Mirren's first since Scottish Cup glory in 1987 and McGowan 
told BBC Scotland: "It's unbelievable.

"I'm so proud of every one of the players and it's a great day. We truly 
deserved it.

"It's been coming for St Mirren <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren>
, they're a great club with great fans and it's been a great day."

St Mirren faced an uphill battle when Stevenson opened the scoring in the 10th 
minute but they did not look back after Goncalves levelled eight minutes before 
the break.

Thompson scored 50 seconds after the restart and Newton's first St Mirren goal 
rendered Stevenson's 86th-minute response forHearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> a mere consolation.

"They came and pressed us quite high and gave us a bit of trouble and so they 
moved me back into midfield and I helped us a lot there," McGowan added.

"It was a great day for us and I'm proud as anything. It's a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try and win a cup here and we've done it and 
made every one of the fans and our families proud. I can't ask for any more."
