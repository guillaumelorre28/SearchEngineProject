Bayern Munich edged past struggling Werder Bremen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen> 1-0 on Saturday courtesy of 
Thomas Müller’s first-half goal to set a Bundesliga record for the best start 
to a season with their ninth consecutive victory.

The Germany striker, in sensational form this season, was left unmarked in the 
box to latch on to a superb Thiago Alcântara chip and tap in from close range 
in the 23rd minute for his ninth league goal as Bayern improved the record they 
had set themselves in the 2012-13 season.

The champions, who never needed to hit top form and eased off late in the game 
granting the home team more space, climb to a maximum 27 points, restoring 
their seven-point lead over second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-0 at 
Mainz on Friday. Bayern face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday.

“We won a very difficult game,” said Pep Guardiola, whose team are chasing a 
record fourth consecutiveBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> title. “Werder were 
defending deep and they made it really hard for us.”

“It was difficult finding spaces, especially because we did not have wingers. 
But I want to congratulate my team as this win means a lot to me.”

Bayern were missing half a dozen players, including the injured wingers Franck 
Ribéry, Arjen Robben and Kingsley Coman, with Guardiola also resting another 
winger, Douglas Costa. But they still comfortably dominated Werder, who have 
now lost five consecutive Bundesliga matches.

The hosts had some efforts on goal and tested keeper Manuel Neuer but neither 
Anthony Ujah nor the former Bayern striker Claudio Pizarro, who came on as a 
late substitute, could find the equaliser. The former German champions are 
stuck on seven points in 14th place.
