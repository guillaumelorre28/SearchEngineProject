 disappointing draws with two promoted sides, Leganés and Alavés, leaving them 
trailing Barcelona and Real Madrid.

Griezmann had been scathing in his criticism after those draws, warning the 
team could be in the “relegation fight” instead of the title race for a fourth 
straight year. The France forward led by example at the Balaídos stadium, and 
also apologised for doubting his team.

“I had to play a match like that,” he said. “I am very happy with the team, 
for our effort. I want to say I am sorry for what I said [after the Leganés 
draw] because I shouldn’t have said it in public.”

Griezmann, who was named the best player

at this summer’s European Championship for leading France to the final, showed 
why he is sometimes seen as La Liga’s most valuable player.

While Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are surrounded by top talent at 
Barcelona and Real Madrid, Griezmann almost single-handedly decided the match.

He sparked Atlético into life after an ineffective first half. His move wide 
allowed Koke to slip forward, and Griezmann found his run with a pinpoint cross 
for the midfielder to volley home in the 52nd minute.

Griezmann’s delicate header into the corner from Saúl Ñíguez’s cross doubled 
the lead in the 73rd minute, and he followed that with a second header eight 
minutes later from Juanfran’s cross. Ángel Correa, on as a substitute, scored 
the fourth.
