<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/16/bbc-breakfast-presenter-victoria-fritz-labour-minutes-after-appearing-live-tv>
. The BBC Breakfast presenter went into early labour soon after reading the

she gave birth to a baby boy with the help of fellow presenter Sally Nugent.

fingernail-sized glass frog, so determined to protect his tadpoles from wasps 
that he went around kicking them in the face.

With her aviators and her withering one-liners, the most badass police 
sergeant in West Yorkshire (stunningly played by Sarah Lancashire) had a 
storming year. In the line of duty, she bludgeoned sheep, tracked down killers, 
tried to talk her colleague down from the edge – and still had time to stop her 
family from being firebombed. Roll onHappy Valley

Fittingly for 2016, a vast swathe of this year’s Eurovision was given over to 
tortured ballads about how awful people are. Most tortured of all came from 
Ukrainian Jamala, who sang a song about the mass Crimean deportation of 1944. 
The song won the competition, which must havenarked Putin off something rotten

If Leicester won the Premier League, he said, he’d present Match of the Day in

This is the moment he transformed into a folk hero.

Game of Thrones <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> is 
a show stuffed full of characters that know how to make an entrance. But this 
year, the little Lady Mormont (played by Bella Ramsey) trumped them all with 
one heartfelt speech: “House Mormont remembers. The north remembers. We know no 
king but the king in the north, whose name is Stark.”

Keeley Hawes, for suffering

Depressed and devious in Line of Duty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/12/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2016-no-8-line-of-duty>

child onThe Missing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/09/the-missing-the-most-grisly-gripping-show-on-television>
, Hawes deserves a special BBC gong for unmitigated horror in the name of 
television drama.

Clare Balding, for true heroism

The perfect Olympic host. She was calm, competent, just patriotic enough – and 
she admitted when she knew nothing about a sport.

At heart, we’re all Fleabag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/18/fleabag-the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2016-no-2-fleabag>
. We’re all grasping and self-centred, pinging around aimlessly as we try to 
find a speck of meaningful connection in a world that isn’t interested. For 
verbalising this better than anyone, Fleabag is a hero of the year.

Channel 4 became full-blown supervillains for nicking Bake Off from the BBC. 
Admittedly the real baddies are Love Productions, for demanding more money than 
the BBC could pay. But, still,Channel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> played its part in irreparably 
ruining a TV show everyone loved.

Paul Hollywood, the deserter award

True, Paul Hollywood <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/paul-hollywood> 
is loyal to Love Productions because they made him a star. And, true, Channel 4 
must have offered him an absolute boatload of cash to stay on in the Bake Off 
tent. Still, a bit of team spirit wouldn’t have hurt.

Dot Cottan, the devilish golfer award

The villain formerly known as The Caddy finally got his comeuppance in Line of 
Duty, as three series’ worth of misdeeds and cover-ups came crashing down on 
his head. “Urgent exit required” indeed.

Paul Spector, the good-looking but vile psychopath award

Narrowly edged out Happy Valley’s Tommy Lee Royce in this most hotly contested 
of categories. Met his end in the third series of The Fall, though not before 
attacking DSI Stella Gibson in a brutal, hard-to-watch finale.

Ross Poldark, the borderline rape award

Oh Ross, you were supposed to be one of the good guys. Instead the dashing 
Captain Poldark rode off for a tempestuous reckoning with Elizabeth, igniting a
fierce audience debate about consent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/poldark-rape-scene-prettifying-it-doesnt-make-it-ok-elizabeth-said-no>
 and breaking Demelza’s heart in the process.

Anything with a plug in Black Mirror, the ‘tech is killing us’ award

If 2016 taught us anything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/19/rise-of-the-robots-how-tech-took-over-tv-in-2016>
 it’s that technology is not always on our side – and no show reflected that 
better than Charlie Brooker’s near-future nightmare. If in doubt, unplug all 
devices and back gingerly away.

Any human in Westworld, the ‘abhorrent non-host’ award

HBO’s sci-fi drama teased us with many possible villains, from Ed Harris’s Man 
in Black through the mysterious Wyatt to the wild west theme park’s creative 
director, Robert Ford. Yet, as the finale revealed, the show’s true baddies are 
the humans, both employees and visitors, who exploit and torment the hosts.

The campest baddie of the year. He strutted around, swinging his baseball bat 
Lucille all over the shop in a creepily priapic manner. He hot-diggidy-dogged 
his way into having copious wives and a reign of tyranny in the zombie 
apocalypse. And by the half-series end, he was the only thing worth watchingThe 
Walking Dead <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-walking-dead> for.

You will have your own reasons for hating Honey G. You may dislike her for 
being an X Factor novelty act who outstayed her welcome. You may dislike how 
she appropriated black culture for laughs. And you may dislike her for just not 
being very good. Either way, she’s on our list for her utter buffoonery.

The Demogorgon, the Upside Down award

We loathe Stranger Things’ big bad not so much for kidnapping Will, because 
after all a monster’s got to eat, but for what it did to Barb.Poor Barb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/17/shannon-purser-interview-people-had-barbs-face-tattooed-on-their-bodies-stranger-things>
.

Anatole Kuragin, the War and Peace award


Creepy Anatole spent five episodes racking up the boos by openly searching for 
a rich wife, fondling every woman who crossed his path, including his haughty 
sister, Helene, and finally seducing Natasha away from the noble Andre. His 
comeuppance? A brutal leg amputation after the battle of Borodino.

Jack Thorne’s ambitious, nuanced drama kept us guessing for four weeks before 
revealing that yes Robbie Coltrane’s Paul Finchley, theNational Treasure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/national-treasure-review-robbie-coltrane>
 of the title, was guilty of rape and having sex with a minor – albeit not in 
the eyes of the law, who acquitted him of all charges after the credibility of 
the main witnesses was undermined.

John Inverdale, the dark ages award

Inverdale had a truly terrible Olympics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/15/andy-murray-john-inverdale-olympic-tennis-bbc-williams>
, from his incoherent musings about what a James Bond film set in Rio would be 
like to his remark to Andy Murray: “You’re the first person ever to win two 
Olympic tennis gold medals.” A helpful Murray pointed out that Venus and Serena 
Williams are people as well.

Everyone was right about her. She’s an awful person and she deserves everything 
she gets.
