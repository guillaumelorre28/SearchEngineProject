Spices can turn simple ingredients into luxurious dishes, and today’s dal is a 
case in point. Humble split peas are made heady with just a handful of spices, 
while the cod fillets served with them are also transformed by a tempered oil 
of mustard seed and curry leaf. The tart that follows is a British take on 
pecan pie – walnuts are the star of this show, brought into their own with a 
mixed spice and vanilla-seasoned honey filling.

Roast mustard seed cod with split pea dal 

Buy fresh curry leaves in larger supermarkets and Asian food stores; they’re 
worth buying in bulk, too, because they freeze so well. The dal is mighty fine 
just as it is with hot, buttered rice or even all on its own. Serves four.

5 tbsp vegetable oil
4 180g cod fillets
2 dried red chillies
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 small handful fresh curry leaves
1 lime, quartered, to serve
1 big handful fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped

For the spice mix
1 tsp coriander seeds 
1½ tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
½ tsp fenugreek 
1 heaped tsp black peppercorns
2.5cm cinnamon stick

For the dal
400g yellow split peas
1 tomato, halved
2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved
2 dried red chillies
1 bay leaf
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Wash the split peas, then put them in a pan with the tomato, garlic, chillies 
and bay. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and 
spoon any scum off the top. Cook for 30-40 minutes, until soft and falling 
apart (add water as required), then drain, keeping a little liquid in the mix; 
if you prefer a smoother finish, mash with a fork.

Warm the spice mix ingredients in a dry frying pan for a few minutes, until 
fragrant, then grind. Season the dal to taste, then add the spice mix half a 
tablespoon at a time, tasting as you go – I like it quite well seasoned, so 
will use anything from one to two tablespoons of the spices. Keep warm while 
you cook the fish.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high 
flame. Pat dry the fish with kitchen paper, season and fry for three to four 
minutes, until golden, then flip and repeat on the other side. When ready, the 
flesh should be translucent and naturally come apart in lovely big flakes.

Once the fish is cooked, spoon a generous helping of dal on to four warm 
plates or deep bowls, and lay a piece of fish on top. Heat the rest of the oil 
in a saucepan on a medium flame, fry the chillies, stirring, for a second or 
two, then add the mustard seeds and curry leaves. As soon as the mustard pops 
and the leaves turn translucent, spoon over the fish and serve with a lime 
wedge, a sprinkle of coriander and maybe buttered rice.

Use a local honey, if possible: it has proven health-boosting properties, and 
you’ll also be supporting local bee initiatives. Serves eight to 10.

For the pastry
130g unsalted butter, chilled 
50g caster sugar
Zest of 1 lemon
225g plain flour
¼ tsp fine sea salt
1 medium egg

For the filling
60g dark brown muscovado sugar
40g light brown soft sugar
200g floral runny honey
100g unsalted butter
¼ tsp mixed spice
½ tsp vanilla extract
¼ tsp fine sea salt
½ tsp lemon juice
350g walnuts, two-thirds bashed into rough crumbs, the rest cut in half
2 large eggs, lightly beaten

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6, and put a flat baking sheet in the oven 
to heat up.

For the pastry, blitz the butter, sugar and lemon zest in a food processor, 
then pulse in the flour and salt until just combined. Briefly beat in the egg 
to form a dough, then tip out on to a lightly floured surface and knead to 
bring it all together; work the dough as little as possible. Shape the dough 
into a disc and roll to 0.5cm thick – this should be more than enough 
generously to line a round, loose-bottomed, fluted 23cm x 2cm tart tin. Roll 
the pastry around the rolling pin, then lift and unroll it straight on to the 
tin. Press into the sides and corners of the tin, using your knuckles, cover 
loosely with clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.

Line the pastry with baking paper and fill with baking beans. Slide the tart 
tin on to the heated baking sheet and blind bake for 20 minutes. Remove the 
beans, trim the pastry and bake for seven minutes more, until golden. Remove, 
and turn down the heat to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

While the pastry is baking, gently heat the sugars, honey and butter in a pan 
until the sugar dissolves. Off the heat, stir in the mixed spice, vanilla, 
salt, lemon and walnut crumbs, then stir in the beaten eggs until the mix 
emulsifies. Spoon into the baked tart case, top with the half-walnuts and slide 
back into the oven for 20-25 minutes, until nut-brown and set. Leave to cool 
before removing from the tin, then cut into slices and serve with ice-cream or 
softly whipped cream.

And for the rest of the week…

Make double or triple the amount of spice mix, so you’ve got some to hand to 
turn cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage or aubergines into fast midweek curries 
with the help of an onion and/or tin of tomatoes. The dal makes a spectacular 
soup, so double the quantities, thin down the leftovers with stock and finish 
in the same way. If you have any excess pastry, bag it, label it, freeze it 
and, on the next rainy day, make an irresistible jam roly-poly.
