Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> have reached an 
agreement in principle to sign the Nice striker Loïc Rémy. The 23-year-old is 
due at the Stade Velodrome today to undergo a medical after Nice accepted 
Marseille's offer which, according to reports, is in the region of €15m 
(£12.4m). Remy has been courted by Premier League clubs this summer but is 
delighted to be closing in on a move to the defending Ligue 1 champions.

"I am very pleased and proud that Marseille are interested in me," Rémy told 
L'Equipe. "After waiting so long for a transfer, everything has accelerated 
very quickly. I'm surprised. I need time to think but I am committed [to 
moving]."

Rémy has emerged as the hottest prospect in France after impressing at Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> following a switch from Lyon in 
2008. He has scored 26 goals in 68 games for the club.

Marseille are also interested in the Toulouse striker André-Pierre Gignac but 
his club have denied receiving an offer for the France international. Toulouse 
this morning said: "Contrary to reports in the media last night, Toulouse have 
not received an offer from Marseille for André-Pierre Gignac."
