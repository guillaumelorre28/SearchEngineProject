Mark Leftly (Curry house owners call for new visa rules to end chef crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/curry-restaurants-crisis-immigration-rules-chefs>
, 23 April) is right to highlight the need for British curry houses to recruit 
more chefs lest this now essential part of our gastronomic landscape fades 
away. But he is entirely wrong to support specialist visa arrangements to do 
so. Such a proposal enables the trade and the wider Asian communities to ignore 
their own responsibilities on three counts. First, after having Asian 
restaurants in the UK for 50 years there should be a well-developed 
apprenticeship model of training organised and funded by those who have built 
successful businesses here. This is a massive sector of the catering business 
in this country. Why aren’t the restaurant owners taking responsibility for 
their own development and recruitment of staff? Second, why is there a problem 
recruiting young people into this business but not into other spheres of work 
such as IT, medicine, dentistry, accountancy, pharmacy? Is it that working in a 
restaurant is too unattractive? Third, there is a substantial supply of highly 
qualified chefs in the UK already – the women who cook for their families every 
day. From my experience of visiting Pakistani families they are excellent at 
the job, have easily transferable skills and could be recruited immediately to 
solve this shortfall. Why are they not encouraged to move into the workplace?
