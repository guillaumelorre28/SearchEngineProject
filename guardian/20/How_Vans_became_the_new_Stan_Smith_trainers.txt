In fashion, ubiquity is usually a sign that a change is about to take place. 
If so, then Stan Smith trainers could be about to be replaced as the trainer of 
choice. Surprisingly, their heir apparent are Vans. Surprising, because the 
trainer is more associated with Avril Lavigne, terrible Nu Metal bands and Jeff 
Spicoli (Sean Penn) from Fast Times at Ridgemont High than high fashion choices.

But it was clear that something had shifted when Frank Ocean turned up at the 
White House state dinner

 last week wearing checked, slip-on Vans. “First time doing it, probably 
because it’s my first time here,” he said when questioned on his shoe choice.

In part, the popularity of Vans is indicative of the growing influence of 
skatewear in fashion, withPalace

, the Thrasher T-shirt and Vogue.com’s skater week bridging the gap, for better 
or worse, between the two worlds. It also helps that Vans are relatively cheap 
to buy (around £70).

Fashion has been quietly embracing the shoe, with regular collaborations with 
Supreme, Gosha Rubchinskiy and Jerry Lorenzo’s Fear of God, while the male 
models at Virgil Abloh’s Off-White label wore the Old Skool design – black 
trainer with wide white sole – at his show. This design was also a fixture on 
the frow among the sea of Gucci loafers. “I’d definitely agree Vans (in 
particular the Old Skool), seemed to have replaced the Adidas Stan Smith as the 
fashion crowd’s favourite sneaker,” says Mr Porter’s shoe buyer, David Morris.

A 30% sales spike came from the Damn Daniel meme, which went viral earlier 
this year. In the clip we heard a voice that was half Brian Molko from Placebo, 
half Shaggy from Scooby Doo cooing: “Damn Daniel, back at it again with the 
white Vans!” wearing different outfits matched with mainly white Vans.The clip 
became A Thing in February <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFcyTuopbI> with 
around 350,000 retweets and the duo of Daniel (Lara) and film-maker Josh Holz 
appearing on Ellen and being referenced on Jane the Virgin. “The national media 
attention the brand received is a wild demonstration of how creative 
expression, youth culture and loyalty can conspire to cause a phenomenon. Well 
done, Daniel, well done,” said chief operating officer Steve Rendle.

The appeal of Vans is similar to that of Stan Smith trainers, in that it’s 
about wearability and simplicity. It’s about “the fact that they can be styled 
with a vast array of categories from designer, contemporary and classic 
brands,” according to Morris. Which suggests a life span for many seasons to 
come.
