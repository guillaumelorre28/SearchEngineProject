Ibrahimovic will not face retrospective action following a clash with the 
Denmark international Kjaer despite pictures appearing to show him grabbing his 
opponent by the throat. Milorad Mazic, the referee, did not take any action at 
the time, but it is understood the incident was seen by the fourth official, 
who determined no sanction was necessary.

The matter will therefore not be subject to review by European governing body 
Uefa, and no retrospective action can take place. Kjaer, who moved to Turkey in 
2015 from Lille, admitted he had aimed to mark Ibrahimovic “as tightly as 
possible” but did not see any reason for him to be charged.

“I actually didn’t hear what he said but I do know that he wasn’t happy,” 
Kjaer told Swedish Channel 9. “But that’s the way I know him from the pitch. He 
is the kind of chest-puffing player, who is arrogant. That is his way of 
playing. My way of playing is to mark him as tightly as possible and to give 
him as little space as possible, because he is a good player.

Of the throttling incident, Kjaer added. “It is a part of football and I don’t 
take it too seriously. It is not the first time I play against him and I know 
how he reacts. It is not a problem. It is, like I said, a part of the game.”

The Fenerbahce manager, Dick Advocaat, also played down the incident after the 
match. “That is part of football,” he said. “I don’t talk about individuals.”

Ibrahimovic, who has not scored in his last six games, had been an early 
replacement for the injured Paul Pogba.
