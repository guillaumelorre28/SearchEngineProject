FULL TIME: Bayern Munich 1-0 Benfica

And that’s that! Bayern scored early and threatened to steamroller Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>. But the Portuguese giants grew 
into the game, held firm, and are right in this tie at the halfway point. In 
fact, they passed up a couple of great chances to grab a precious away goal, 
but they’ll be happy enough to have limited Bayern to their one-goal home 
victory. The home fans aren’t as content, though, and you get the impression 
they won’t be that unhappy to see the back of Pep Guardiola. The second leg in 
Lisbon promises to be a cracker.

90 min +2: Benfica are giving Bayern the high, hard press. It’s all very

87 min: Lahm powers down the right before slipping a ball forward for Coman, 
who loops long, looking for Lewandowski at the far post. The ball sails 
harmlessly out of play for a goal kick.

81 min: Lewandowski intercepts a weak Lindelof clearing header, and sparks an 
intense period of Bayern pressure. First Thiago nearly breaks into the box down 
the inside-left channel. Then Ribery cuts in from the left and shoots low, 
straight at Ederson. Then finally Bernat tries to force the ball down the 
inside-left channel to release Lewandowski, but the striker is caught offside, 
and cops the flak from the home support. Which is a bit off, seeing he set the 
whole thing rolling in the first place.

79 min: Ribery and Muller zip down the left wing together. They’re on the same 
flank, but not the same mental wavelength, because the former manages to catch 
the latter offside with the simplest of passes. A few whistles from the crowd.

78 min: Coman hugs the right-hand touchline and nears the corner flag, before 
hoicking a cross out of play on the left. That pretty much sums up Bayern’s 
second-half performance. The home fans don’t sound particularly made up.

73 min: Ribery tries to inject a bit of energy into Bayern’s performance. He 
tears down the left, reaches the byline, and pulls one back for Lewandowski, 
whose attempted flick from the left-hand corner of the six-yard area is weak 
and straight at Ederson. Bayern were rampant for the first 20-25 minutes of 
this match. They’ve not been anywhere near as good since. On the touchline, Pep 
Guardiola has his hands in his pockets, like everything’s fine and dandy. Which 
it still is, but only just.

72 min: Jonas strides down the inside-left channel and is impeded by Vidal. 
Free kick, 40 yards out. The ball’s floated into the area. Bayern don’t deal 
with it. First Gaitan takes a fresh-air swipe, then Lindelof, haring in at the 
far post, misses completely as well. Farcical. Bayern are playing a dangerous 
game here.

69 min: Corner for Bayern down the left. It’s sent all the way back to Lahm, 
35 yards out. Lahm hoicks it into the mixer, in the 1980s English style. Jardel 
heads clear. Pep Guardiola, ladies and gentlemen!

67 min: Ribery rips down the left wing, lays off to Muller, who rolls a pass 
back to Thiago. The inventive Thiago gently floats a pass towards Vidal on the 
penalty spot. Vidal turns, and creams a riser straight at Ederson. The keeper 
tips over, and it turns out Vidal was offside anyway. But what a pass by 
Thiago! A lovely player.

64 min: What an absurd miss! Andre Almedia beats Ribery to the ball down the 
right, and makes off into the Bayern box. His low cross finds Jonas, free, ten 
yards out. He blooters his shot straight into the chest of Javi Martinez, 
claims a penalty, then slashes a second effort over the bar from close range. 
Actually, that’stwo absurd misses, isn’t it. Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> should be level. Bayern have 
fallen right off the pace. The home side aren’t very happy, though the away 
fans are making an almighty racket. Marvellous.

62 min: Lewandowski powers in from the left and threatens to break past 
Lindelof, who drags the striker down and is booked. All in the centre of the 
field, so the resulting free kick comes to nothing.

59 min: It’s been a bad couple of minutes for Jonas. He picks up a yellow for 
standing on Vidal’s ankle, so he’s suspended for the second leg. Actually, it’s 
swings and roundabouts, that, because it was a nasty looking challenge. He’s 
lucky not to see red. So at least he’ll see out the rest of this match. If he 
behaves.

57 min: Renato Sanches, cutting in from the left, chips delicately forward 
towards Jonas on the edge of the Bayern box. He flicks the ball round the 
corner, and past Alaba, for himself. He’s one on one with Neuer! But shoots 
straight at the keeper. What a chance to grab an away goal! Bayern go straight 
up the other end and nearly makes it two, Bernat gliding down the inside-left 
channel and sending a low diagonal shot inches wide of the right-hand post.

cross towards Lewandowski, who can’t get a header away. The ball breaks to 
Douglas Costa on the right-hand corner of the box. He cuts inside and looks for 
the top left. But only succeeds in battering the ball straight into poor 
Jardel’s coupon. Jardel stands tall for a second, before collapsing backwards 
like a felled tree. He’s OK after a dab with the magic sponge, but there were 
cartoon birds circling his head for a few seconds there.

release Lewandowski into theBenfica

at Ederson, and he was offside anyway. But Bayern are starting this half

48 min: ... the ball drops to Vidal, to the right of the D. He attempts to 
shoot goalwards, but screws a comically awful shot away to his left, the ball 
landing with snooker-style check side on the left-hand corner of the box and 
away.

HALF TIME: Bayern Munich 1-0 Benfica

A long Benfica throw from the left. Mitroglou attempts to lash one home from 
the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. It’s deflected back to Gaitan, whose 
drive from the penalty spot is blocked by a sliding Vidal. And that’s that for 
the first half. Benfica will be happy enough, having conceded so early. They 
looked in real trouble for a while, but held on and gained confidence towards 
the end of the half. Second 45 should be a cracker. No flipping! Though having 
said that,Barca are losing at home

And that’s that! Bayern scored early and threatened to steamroller Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>. But the Portuguese giants grew 
into the game, held firm, and are right in this tie at the halfway point. In 
fact, they passed up a couple of great chances to grab a precious away goal, 
but they’ll be happy enough to have limited Bayern to their one-goal home 
victory. The home fans aren’t as content, though, and you get the impression 
they won’t be that unhappy to see the back of Pep Guardiola. The second leg in 
Lisbon promises to be a cracker.

90 min +4: Eliseu takes a good 30 seconds over a different throw. 
Professionalism at its finest.
 
90 min +3: Ribery, in a tight position on the left, screws a cross-cum-shot 
across the face of goal and out of play on the right.Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> don’t bother rushing to take the 
throw.
 
90 min +2: Benfica are giving Bayern the high, hard press. It’s all very 
scrappy in the midfield, just as the visitors like it. The clock keeps ticking.
 
90 min +1: Samaris comes on for Pizzi. The next four minutes are so crucial to 
the balance of this quarter final.Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> will be pretty happy with their 
evening’s work. So far.
 
90 min: There will be five added minutes. Five!
 
89 min: Lahm and Gotze combine marvellously down the inside-right channel, 
opening up a bit of space. Then Vidal slides a diagonal pass towards 
Lewandowski, on the left of theBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> D. He’s free on goal! Instead of 
shooting, he rolls the ball across for Lahm, who has kept on keeping on. But 
the pass is woefully overcooked, and Lahm can’t meet it. What a nonsense!
 
87 min: Lahm powers down the right before slipping a ball forward for Coman, 
who loops long, looking for Lewandowski at the far post. The ball sails 
harmlessly out of play for a goal kick.
 
85 min: Muller is replaced by 2014’s Mario Gotze.
 
84 min: Corner for Bayern on the right. Vidal whips it onto Lewandowski’s 
head. The striker batters his header over the bar from 12 yards.

82 min: Salvio comes on for Jonas. Coman breaks down the left and feeds 
Lewandowski, who twists and turns but can’t get a shot away. The whistles are 
getting louder.
 
81 min: Lewandowski intercepts a weak Lindelof clearing header, and sparks an 
intense period of Bayern pressure. First Thiago nearly breaks into the box down 
the inside-left channel. Then Ribery cuts in from the left and shoots low, 
straight at Ederson. Then finally Bernat tries to force the ball down the 
inside-left channel to release Lewandowski, but the striker is caught offside, 
and cops the flak from the home support. Which is a bit off, seeing he set the 
whole thing rolling in the first place.
 
79 min: Ribery and Muller zip down the left wing together. They’re on the same 
flank, but not the same mental wavelength, because the former manages to catch 
the latter offside with the simplest of passes. A few whistles from the crowd.
 
78 min: Coman hugs the right-hand touchline and nears the corner flag, before 
hoicking a cross out of play on the left. That pretty much sums up Bayern’s 
second-half performance. The home fans don’t sound particularly made up.
 
75 min: It’s gone scrappy again. Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> will be happy enough with this.
 
73 min: Ribery tries to inject a bit of energy into Bayern’s performance. He 
tears down the left, reaches the byline, and pulls one back for Lewandowski, 
whose attempted flick from the left-hand corner of the six-yard area is weak 
and straight at Ederson. Bayern were rampant for the first 20-25 minutes of 
this match. They’ve not been anywhere near as good since. On the touchline, Pep 
Guardiola has his hands in his pockets, like everything’s fine and dandy. Which 
it still is, but only just.

Andersen/AFP/Getty Images  
72 min: Jonas strides down the inside-left channel and is impeded by Vidal. 
Free kick, 40 yards out. The ball’s floated into the area. Bayern don’t deal 
with it. First Gaitan takes a fresh-air swipe, then Lindelof, haring in at the 
far post, misses completely as well. Farcical. Bayern are playing a dangerous 
game here.
 
70 min: Both sides make a change. Douglas Costa is replaced by Kingsley Coman 
for Bayern, while the visitors trade Mitroglou for Raul Jimenez.
 
69 min: Corner for Bayern down the left. It’s sent all the way back to Lahm, 
35 yards out. Lahm hoicks it into the mixer, in the 1980s English style. Jardel 
heads clear. Pep Guardiola, ladies and gentlemen!
 
67 min: Ribery rips down the left wing, lays off to Muller, who rolls a pass 
back to Thiago. The inventive Thiago gently floats a pass towards Vidal on the 
penalty spot. Vidal turns, and creams a riser straight at Ederson. The keeper 
tips over, and it turns out Vidal was offside anyway. But what a pass by 
Thiago! A lovely player.

64 min: What an absurd miss! Andre Almedia beats Ribery to the ball down the 
right, and makes off into the Bayern box. His low cross finds Jonas, free, ten 
yards out. He blooters his shot straight into the chest of Javi Martinez, 
claims a penalty, then slashes a second effort over the bar from close range. 
Actually, that’stwo absurd misses, isn’t it. Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> should be level. Bayern have 
fallen right off the pace. The home side aren’t very happy, though the away 
fans are making an almighty racket. Marvellous.

62 min: Lewandowski powers in from the left and threatens to break past 
Lindelof, who drags the striker down and is booked. All in the centre of the 
field, so the resulting free kick comes to nothing.
 
60 min: Bayern make the first change of the evening: Javi Martinez comes on 
for young Kimmich.
 
59 min: It’s been a bad couple of minutes for Jonas. He picks up a yellow for 
standing on Vidal’s ankle, so he’s suspended for the second leg. Actually, it’s 
swings and roundabouts, that, because it was a nasty looking challenge. He’s 
lucky not to see red. So at least he’ll see out the rest of this match. If he 
behaves.

57 min: Renato Sanches, cutting in from the left, chips delicately forward 
towards Jonas on the edge of the Bayern box. He flicks the ball round the 
corner, and past Alaba, for himself. He’s one on one with Neuer! But shoots 
straight at the keeper. What a chance to grab an away goal! Bayern go straight 
up the other end and nearly makes it two, Bernat gliding down the inside-left 
channel and sending a low diagonal shot inches wide of the right-hand post.
 
54 min: The busy Bernat makes space for himself down the left and scoops a 
cross towards Lewandowski, who can’t get a header away. The ball breaks to 
Douglas Costa on the right-hand corner of the box. He cuts inside and looks for 
the top left. But only succeeds in battering the ball straight into poor 
Jardel’s coupon. Jardel stands tall for a second, before collapsing backwards 
like a felled tree. He’s OK after a dab with the magic sponge, but there were 
cartoon birds circling his head for a few seconds there.
 
52 min: More Bayern possession. Douglas Costa and Lahm seeing an awful lot of 
the ball. But not doing a whole load with it.Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are holding their shape well 
now, and looking comfortable enough.
 
50 min: Muller, 25 yards out, plays a cute ball down the middle of the park to 
release Lewandowski into theBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> box. The striker shoots straight 
at Ederson, and he was offside anyway. But Bayern are starting this half 
strongly.

offside. Photograph: Sven Hoppe/EPA  
48 min: ... the ball drops to Vidal, to the right of the D. He attempts to 
shoot goalwards, but screws a comically awful shot away to his left, the ball 
landing with snooker-style check side on the left-hand corner of the box and 
away.
 
47 min: A slow start to the second period. Bayern seeing the lion’s share of 
possession, though it’s all in their own half. But then suddenly they launch it 
long down the left, Ribery winning a throw deep inBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> territory. He takes it quickly 
towards Bernat, who fires low and hard towards Lewandowski at the near post. 
It’s bundled out for a corner. From which ...
 
No changes. The hosts get the second half underway.
