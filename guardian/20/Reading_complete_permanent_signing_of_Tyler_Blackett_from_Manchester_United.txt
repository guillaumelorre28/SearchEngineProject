Reading’s manager, Jaap Stam, has turned to his former club Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> to sign the defender 
Tyler Blackett on a permanent deal. The 22-year-old attended the Royals’ 2-2 
Championship draw with Brighton on Saturday before agreeing terms on a 
three-year contract.

Stam said on Reading’s official website: “As we know, Tyler is a talented 
defender who has played for United’s first team. He can play as a left-back or 
a left-sided centre-back. He has got great potential in the sense that he is 
quick and athletic, defensively he is strong and he is good at set pieces.

“As a defender he can go and play high up the pitch as well and that is what 
we need in the squad.”

Blackett made 12 appearances for United’s first team, making his debut in 
2014, and also had loan spells with Blackpool, Birmingham and,last season, 
Celtic

the under-21s in 2014. The signing is Reading’s third of the summer after the 
arrivals of John Swift and Liam Moore.
