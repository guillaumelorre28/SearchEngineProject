A southern American classic, the red velvet has its origins 
<http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#redvelvet> in the 19th century, 
when cakes as soft and fine as that fancy fabric were the height of culinary 
fashion. And although the colouring came much later –variously said 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/red-velvet-cake-from-gimmick-to-american-classic.html>
 to stem from the faint reddish hue that results from a collision of alkaline 
bicarbonate of soda with acidic cocoa, or the “red” brown sugar sometimes used 
– by the mid-20th century, it had become the cake’s calling card. One early 
recipe, printed in Texas’s Amarillo Globe-Times in the summer of 1960, calls 
for four tablespoons of food dye.

Mississippi native and Saveur magazine food editor Ben Mims explains the red 
velvet’s attraction 
<http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Sweet-Southern-Dreams>: “The deep 
crimson cake against the luminous white frosting is pure Southern drama. It’s
Shirley MacLaine in Steel Magnolias 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1miYOeX44I> hacking into the blood-coloured 
tail of an armadillo-shaped groom’s cake. It’s my mother’s ceramic-white skin 
contrasted by her lips, always burnished with brick-red lipstick.”

The red velvet arrived in Britain much more recently on the coat-tails of the 
early noughties Sex-and-the-City-era cupcake craze – and, frankly, had us 
mystified as to its intended flavour. But we were missing the point; while a 
red velvet cake should taste of cocoa, vanilla and buttermilk, it is chiefly 
distinctive for its soft, silky texture and aggressive crimson colour. If you 
don’t want a red cake, you should probably make something else. If you want 
something for tea that could stop traffic, read on.

The batter

That fine, silky texture should be smooth rather than fluffy; moist, but never 
dense. For a really soft, tender crumb, there needs to be a higher proportion 
of fat than in your standard sponge, and that fat should be butter. I try 
vegetable shortening, as suggested in Carolyn A Knutsen’s recipe,published in 
the New York Times in 1977 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/25/archives/de-gustibus-red-velvet-cake-returns-tomato-paste-lingers-on.html?_r=0>
, and a mixture of vegetable oil and butter, as pastry chefMaria del Mar Sacasa 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/let-them-eat-natural-red-velvet-cake-recipe.html>
 recommends on the Serious Eats website, but neither comes close for flavour.

The distinctive tang of red velvet is part of its attraction, and most recipes 
get this from a combination of buttermilk and vinegar. These acidic ingredients 
not only help to balance the richness of the butter, but react with bicarbonate 
of soda to create bubbles, further aerating the batter.Southern Living 
<http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/red-velvet-layer-cake> chooses sour cream over 
buttermilk, but my testers find the cake too fudgey and dense, “almost like a 
brownie”. It turns out youcan add too much fat.


Mims <http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Red-Velvet-Cake-1000089787> uses 
baking powder rather than straight bicarbonate of soda; an odd decision given 
that baking powder already contains acid and, in theory, should have no need of 
any more, which might be why his cake has a slightly odd flavour. That said, my 
panel come out strongly in favour of del Mar Sacasa’s cake for texture, which 
uses both – it’s lighter than the others, without being at all dry, so I’m 
going to take the bare bones of my recipe from her.

The colour

With the velvet part of the recipe sorted, it’s time to turn my attention to 
the red bit, which proves more problematic. The first three I make are 
definitely brown velvet cakes, which sounds like something you might take to a 
70s-themed party. I realise belatedly that the natural food colourings I’ve 
used are not what the industry might term “bake stable”, so I apologise toCooks 
Country magazine <https://www.americastestkitchen.com/search?q=red+velvet+cake> 
and Knutsen for their sad-looking cakes.

The colour of Del Mar Sacasa’s cake, however, is entirely deliberate; she’s 
not a fan of “those bright carmine cupcakes peddled by overhyped bakeries”, 
which she describes as “dry, stale and lacking in flavour and substance”. For 
some reason, this translates into a refusal to use food colourings; instead she 
goes for pureed beetroot and red wine, which gives her cake a warm reddish 
brown colour. It tastes delicious, but I don’t really get the point. If I 
wanted a red wine and chocolate cake, I’d make one.

A red velvet cake should be unapologetically, showstoppingly gaudy – the baked 
equivalent ofDolly Parton <https://www.theguardian.com/music/dolly-parton>. And 
for that, I’m afraid, you need artificial colourings of the sort used by the 
pros – they’reeasily available online 
<http://www.souschef.co.uk/intense-red-colour.html#feefo>, or from specialist 
baking suppliers. If you’d prefer to avoid them, I’d dispense with any kind of 
colouring – beetroot adds its own flavour, and this is not the kind of cake 
that would consider “earthy” a compliment.

You also need to keep the rest of the batter as pale as possible, which rules 
out Del Mar Sacasa’s dark brown sugar, or indeed Knutsen’s generous hand with 
the cocoa. A hint of chocolate, and a hint of vanilla, is all that’s required; 
Del Mar Sacasa adds almond extract, too, but again, this falls into the 
nice-but-not-red-velvet category.

A word about the cocoa: most recipes call for “Dutch process” powder, which 
has beentreated to neutralise some of the acidity 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/difference-dutch-process-natural-cocoa-powder-substitute.html>
 (which means that it won’t react with the bicarbonate of soda to make the cake 
red, though given the amount of colouring they use, this is neither here nor 
there). In Europe, almost all cocoa is treated in this way so, if you’re based 
here, this isn’t something you need to worry about. If not, check the packaging.

The icing

Sorry, “frosting”. Modern red velvet recipes usually go for that all-American 
favourite,cream cheese 
<http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-frosting-36>, but testers find 
this a bit sickly on top of such a buttery cake – especially since, like 
Southern Living, I’m going to hell in a handcart with a three-layer behemoth 
(whoever coined the phrase “less is more” clearly didn’t like cake).

Much more interesting are the boiled icings more commonly found in older 
versions, which start by heating a mixture of sugar, flour and milk until 
thickened to the consistency of Bird’s custard, and then whip in butter to give 
an icing which is rich, but not overpoweringly so. In Mims and Del Mar Sacasa’s 
versions, it really does melt in the mouth. It’s a bit more work than cream 
cheese, but well worth it. The latter flavours hers with more wine and blood 
orange juice and zest (not that I could find a fresh blood orange in August), 
but plain vanilla is more traditional.

Knutsen gives a recipe for an even more curious icing that puzzles me still – 
butter, egg yolks and sugar are whisked together over a gentle heat until 
thickened, and then mixed with raisins and pecans to give a kind of chewy 
toffee which can be spread, with some difficulty, over the delicate cake 
beneath. It’s delicious… but it doesn’t feel much like icing. I do like the 
crunch of the pecans though, so – since rhinestones aren’t edible – I’m going 
to add a few as decoration.

Perfect red velvet cake

(Makes 1 large cake)
575g plain flour
2 tbsp cocoa
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
450g butter, at room temperature
450g white caster sugar
5 large eggs, beaten
385ml buttermilk
1 tsp vanilla extract
Artificial red colouring
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 tbsp cider vinegar

For the icing:
285g sugar
50g flour
350ml milk
250g unsalted butter, softened
2 tsp vanilla extract
25g pecans, to serve

Grease and line 3 x 23cm tins with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 
180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.

Beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the eggs, 
one at a time, beating well to incorporate between each addition.

Whisk together the buttermilk, vanilla and enough red colouring to give a 
vivid red colour. Add a third of the flour to the batter and fold in, followed 
by half the buttermilk, and repeat until it’s all used up.

Stir the bicarb and vinegar together and add to the mixture, then divide 
between the tins and bake for about 25-30 minutes, until just firm.

For the icing, mix the sugar and flour in a large pan and stir in the milk 
gradually to make a smooth paste. Slowly bring to the boil, stirring regularly, 
then cook, stirring, until the consistency of thick custard, which should take 
5-10 minutes. Allow to cool completely, then add a quarter to the butter and 
beat until fluffy. Add the rest, along with the vanilla and a good pinch of 
salt, and beat until very light.

Spread the icing between the layers of the cake, then cover the top and sides 
with the remaining icing. Decorate with pecans. Refrigerate if not eating 
immediately.

Red velvet cake: silly gimmick or gloriously tacky food of the gods? Does it 
make you see red or glimpse heaven? And where do you stand on artificial food 
colourings – and is there any point making it without them?
