The League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> side 
Mansfield have appointed Adam Murray as their new manager.

Murray, the captain, who has been in caretaker charge since Paul Cox’s 
departure last month, was confirmed as the permanent manager at a press 
conference at the One Call Stadium on Friday. The 33-year-old, who becomes the 
youngest manager in the Football League, confirmed his backroom staff will 
remain the same.

“After much thought and consideration, I feel the time is right for me to take 
this step into management,” hetold the club’s website

. “I’m excited about this challenge and new adventure and I believe I have the 
knowledge, ability and contacts throughout the game to be successful. This is 
the proudest day of my career to date.”

Mansfield’s chairman John Radford and the club’s board of directors spoke to 
seven candidates on Tuesday, including Murray, after the experienced midfielder 
decided to put his name forward for the job.

Murray has been in temporary charge for three matches, winning two and losing 
one, since Cox left by mutual consent after three-and-a-half years in charge. 
His departure came two days after the Stags were held to a 1-1 draw in the FA 
Cup by non-league side Concord Rangers.

Cox, 42, led the club to the Conference title and promotion back into the 
Football League in 2013 after a five-year absence. Murray’s first match as 
permanent manager will be away to Cambridge in the FA Cup second round on 
Saturday.
