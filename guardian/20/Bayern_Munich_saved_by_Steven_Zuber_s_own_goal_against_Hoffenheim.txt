Bayern fell a goal behind when Kerem Demirbay’s thundering shot in the 16th 
minute left their goalkeeper Manuel Neuer rooted to the spot.

Hoffenheim were doing well to contain the Bavarians’ attacks but could do 
nothing when Steven Zuber slid into the box to clear a cutback from Douglas 
Costa but instead sent the ball into his own net.

Carlo Ancelotti’s men were more aggressive after the break with both Mats 
Hummels and Thomas Müller hitting the post, but Hoffenheim managed to hold on 
to snatch a point.

Bayern remain top on 24 points with RB Leipzig, in second spot on 21, hosting 
Mainz on Sunday. Hoffenheim are third on 20.
