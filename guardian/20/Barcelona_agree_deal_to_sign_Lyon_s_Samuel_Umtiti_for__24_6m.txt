The 22-year-old, who is expected to replace the suspended Adil Rami when 
France face Iceland in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 on Sunday, has been 
tracked by Luis Enrique’s side for some time after they were frustrated in 
their attempts to sign Paris Saint-Germain’s Marquinhos.

Negotiations between the two clubs have been ongoing for some time and Lyon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> president Jean-Michel Aulas has 
confirmed reports that a fee of €30m (£24.6m) has been agreed.

“We anticipate the eventual departure of Umtiti. Samuel has an exclusive 
agreement for him to join Barcelona,”he told RMC Sport 
<http://rmc.bfmtv.com/mediaplayer/live-audio/>.

“We made a promise that if he could play for the club of his heart, he would 
leave. It’s part of the commitment which we have made, as was done for Karim 
Benzema when he went to Real Madrid. Right now, Samuel is withLes Bleus and is 
focused on the Euros and the fact that he can play Sunday against Iceland. If 
the three parties agree, it is possible that he will leave us.”
