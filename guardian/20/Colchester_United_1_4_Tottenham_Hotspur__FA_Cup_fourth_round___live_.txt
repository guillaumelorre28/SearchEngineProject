FULL TIME: Colchester United 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur

And that’s that! Spurs ease their way into the fifth round for the first time 
in four seasons. Deservedly so: they were brilliant at times, the real deal all 
right. ButColchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> did 
themselves proud too, adjusting to the early loss of their central defence, and 
staying competitive until late in the game. But Spurs got the breaks at the 
crucial moments - Dier’s deflected goal, Sordell’s shot against the post - and 
hey, you make your own luck. A very entertaining cup tie. Follow that, Lionel 
Richie.

89 min: Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> touch the 
ball! This is exhibition stuff now. But the League One strugglers have 
performed well today, and were right in this tie until that late burst of 
scoring.

84 min: The crazy run of Goal Every 120 Seconds is broken, but only just. Son 
dribbles with purpose down the right and reaches the byline. He’s got men in 
the middle, but his low cross, driven into a mixer at the near post, somehow 
squirts clear of danger instead of heading into the net.

GOAL! Colchester United 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur (Carroll 82)

It’s turned into a goalfest! Chadli twists and turns down the left. He fires 
low into the centre, where Carroll sweetly volleys past Kean from close range.

GOAL! Colchester United 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur (Davies 80 og)

As the game restarts, a fan rushes onto the pitch and asks Vorm for his 
autograph! What brazen chutzpah! And thenColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> get onto the scoresheet! 
Massey is found in space down the left. His low shot crashes off the right-hand 
post and back across the goalline. Davies, rushing back, can’t stop himself 
running the ball into the net.
 A fan can’t wait to ask Michel Vorm for his autograph and invades the pitch.

Carroll, on the right of the Colchester

Trippier on the wing. Trippier curls a delightful medium-height cross to the 
near post. Chadli stoops ahead of Kent, and guides the ball into the bottom

76 min: Dier is caught sleeping on the ball. Sordell nips it off him, 
exchanges passes with Massey, and tears clear on goal! He opens up his body, 
and looks to sidefoot into the bottom right. He beats Vorm, but the ball 
crashes off the base of the right-hand post and away. So close to getting back 
into this game! Lower-league sides need all the luck they can get in theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup>, and nothing’s going Colchester’s 
way.

73 min: Massey has been Colchester’s best player today. He beats a couple of 
players down the left and fires a shot towards the bottom left. It’s blocked 
easily enough. The ball breaks to the right of the D, where Brindley attempts 
to replicate Chadli’s goal. Not quite.

in the vicinity of Essex Google is not wrong in telling me that Lionel Richie 
will be playing there in June.”

captain’s armband to Eriksen, and departs the field of play. Son comes on in 
his wake.

GOAL! Colchester United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur (Dier 64)

Oh dear, such a shame for Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester>, who are dished out a 
terrible slice of luck. Dier has the ball 25 yards out, a little to the right 
of centre. He looks for the top right. It’s not a particularly good effort, but 
slams into the back of Briggs, and takes a huge left-turn into the left-hand 
side of the net, bouncing at an agonisingly slow speed past Kean, wrong-footed 
and rendered impotent.

62 min: Somehow, Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> 
are still within touching distance of Tottenham. So it’s time to make their 
last roll of the dice. An attacking change: the midfielder Ambrose is replaced 
by the striker Sordell.

60 min: I should be writing Colchester United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> (Chadli 60) in big 
letters. But I’m not. Kane bursts down the left, into the area, and slips the 
ball low to Chadli. He spins to make space. He’s free, eight yards out. He’s 
got to score! But he batters a rising shot onto the crossbar, and that’s that. 
What a miss!

58 min: Kane powers into the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> box from the left, but can’t 
find space to shoot. The ball finds its way to Chadli, who twists and turns on 
the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, but isn’t able to make room for an 
effort on goal. Colchester’s makeshift defence slammed the door shut very 
impressively there. For a brief moment it looked like a second Spurs goal was 
on the cards.

56 min: Porter and Wimmer challenge a ball down the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> inside-left channel. Wimmer 
sticks his leg out to guide it back to Vorm. Porter goes over Wimmer’s leg and 
claims a penalty, but he’s never getting that. Spurs meanwhile make their first 
change, hooking Lamela and throwing on Dembele.

55 min: Yes, much better indeed. Ambrose skitters down the right and curls a 
glorious deep cross towards Porter at the far post. It’s begging to be met by a 
diving header. But Porter tries to meet it with a high boot, and the chance is 
gone.

54 min: A speculative hoof down the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> right. Moncur sticks out a 
boot and takes it down brilliantly. He romps down the wing and this time finds 
Ambrose in the middle. Ambrose shoots, and the effort from the edge of the box 
is deflected inches wide of the right-hand post. Had that been on target, it 
was creeping in with Vorm’s feet planted. From the corner, the ball finds 
Massey wide on the left. He blooters a shot goalwards, but Vorm has it covered. 
This is much better from the home side!

52 min: Garvan rakes a delicious pass down the left flank to release Massey 
into space. Massey makes it to the box, before pulling the ball back for 
Moncur, who turns in a tight space and sees his snapshot blocked pretty much 
the nanosecond the ball comes off his boot. Ambrose was in the middle, in 
space, waiting for a pass there.

50 min: Massey has been busy in attack for the home side. He earns himself a 
little space down the left, and decides to take a shot from distance. It’s a 
weak effort, and deflected through to Vorm.

49 min: Lamela appears to be in the mood to put this tie to bed early in this 
second half. He dribbles in from the left, and again looks for the bottom 
right. Again his effort is wide, but he’s getting chances.Colchester

47 min: Briggs tries to Beckenbauer his way through the middle of the park. 
Bad decision. He gifts the ball to Kane, who drifts down the Spurs right before 
dinking the ball across to Lamela, who takes a touch to burst clear into the
Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> box down the 
inside-left channel. He’s got Brindley on his shoulder, and the full back does 
enough to put him off. Lamela goes for the bottom right, and squeezes the ball 
past Kean, but also past the right-hand post.

And we're off again!

Great news regarding Alex Wynter: he’s conscious and sitting up in hospital. 
So hopefully, touch all sorts of wooden items, he’ll be OK. Spurs get the ball 
rolling for the second half. And here’s Steve Wiles with a Colchester-centric 
take on that eventful first half: “All things considered, when you bear in mind 
we’ve lost our entire central defence, played for a quarter of the half with 
ten men, are currently playing an inexperienced kid at centre back (but watch 
him, he’s gonna be good) along with a left back who finds himself there by 
accident ... the sheer fact we started to find our way into this match is a 
credit. Even if we clearly look like blokes running after a ball vs athletes I 
couldn’t be more proud of the guys.”

HALF TIME: Colchester United 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur

Not the worst scoreline for United at half time, given the early loss of both 
central defenders, and Tottenham’s subsequent dominance. In fact, had Moncur 
picked the right pass towards the end of that half, the teams might be going in 
level. Strange game in that respect, though Spurs have been much the better 
side. Could be a fascinating second half. Stay tuned!

45 min +5: Vincent-Young hasn’t lost the confidence to attack. He makes off 
down the left again, drifts inside, and so nearly releases Moncur, cutting in 
from the right, with a sliderule pass. But Dier steps in to intercept, having 
read Vincent-Young’s intentions perfectly.

45 min +1: Eriksen skates across the front of the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> area, left to right. He 
considers shooting, but slips Trippier free into the box instead. Trippier 
fires into the centre, low and hard. Kane can’t quite guide it home from close 
range, and Kent is able to hook clear while sliding along hysterically on the 
seat of his pants. Brilliant football all round.

41 min: Moncur dribbles down the middle of the park at pace. Spurs are light 
at the back, and if Moncur rolls a pass down the inside-right channel for 
Porter, he’ll send his strike partner free on goal. But he’s high on life, and 
decides to go it alone. Spurs finally swarm around him before he can reach the 
box. Far too late, he tries to find Porter, by now on the left, but his flick 
is no good. A real chance for the League One side to draw level has been 
spurned.

And that’s that! Spurs ease their way into the fifth round for the first time 
in four seasons. Deservedly so: they were brilliant at times, the real deal all 
right. ButColchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> did 
themselves proud too, adjusting to the early loss of their central defence, and 
staying competitive until late in the game. But Spurs got the breaks at the 
crucial moments - Dier’s deflected goal, Sordell’s shot against the post - and 
hey, you make your own luck. A very entertaining cup tie. Follow that, Lionel 
Richie.

90 min: There will be two additional minutes.
 
89 min: Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> touch the 
ball! This is exhibition stuff now. But the League One strugglers have 
performed well today, and were right in this tie until that late burst of 
scoring.
 
88 min: See 86 min. Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> haven’t had a touch for some 
time now.
 
86 min: Spurs calm it all down, knocking it back and forth in the Dad v 
Toddler style, running down the clock in a most professional manner.
 
84 min: The crazy run of Goal Every 120 Seconds is broken, but only just. Son 
dribbles with purpose down the right and reaches the byline. He’s got men in 
the middle, but his low cross, driven into a mixer at the near post, somehow 
squirts clear of danger instead of heading into the net.
 
It’s turned into a goalfest! Chadli twists and turns down the left. He fires 
low into the centre, where Carroll sweetly volleys past Kean from close range.

As the game restarts, a fan rushes onto the pitch and asks Vorm for his 
autograph! What brazen chutzpah! And thenColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> get onto the scoresheet! 
Massey is found in space down the left. His low shot crashes off the right-hand 
post and back across the goalline. Davies, rushing back, can’t stop himself 
running the ball into the net.
 A fan can’t wait to ask Michel Vorm for his autograph and invades the pitch.

Carroll, on the right of the Colchester

near post. Chadli stoops ahead of Kent, and guides the ball into the bottom 
right.

77 min: Eriksen is replaced by Onomah.
 
76 min: Dier is caught sleeping on the ball. Sordell nips it off him, 
exchanges passes with Massey, and tears clear on goal! He opens up his body, 
and looks to sidefoot into the bottom right. He beats Vorm, but the ball 
crashes off the base of the right-hand post and away. So close to getting back 
into this game! Lower-league sides need all the luck they can get in theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup>, and nothing’s going Colchester’s 
way.

73 min: Massey has been Colchester’s best player today. He beats a couple of 
players down the left and fires a shot towards the bottom left. It’s blocked 
easily enough. The ball breaks to the right of the D, where Brindley attempts 
to replicate Chadli’s goal. Not quite.
 
72 min: Son cuts in from the right and turns on the jets. He looks for the 
bottom left. Kean does well to get down and parry the shot clear.
 
71 min: Spurs with more of the stroking, left and right and left again, all 
across the back. “Google tells me that the Weston Homes Community Stadium is 
closed today,” reports JR in Illinois, who has too much time on his hands. “I 
am surprised that someone is wrong on the internet, but hopefully for everyone 
in the vicinity of Essex Google is not wrong in telling me that Lionel Richie 
will be playing there in June.”
 
69 min: Spurs hog the ball, knocking it hither and yon. Already they’re 
looking to run down the clock in a fuss-free fashion.
 
67 min: A sign that Tottenham know this tie is now over. Kane hands the 
captain’s armband to Eriksen, and departs the field of play. Son comes on in 
his wake.
 
66 min: That said, Spurs should be four or five goals up, so it’s swings and 
roundabouts.

Oh dear, such a shame for Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester>, who are dished out a 
terrible slice of luck. Dier has the ball 25 yards out, a little to the right 
of centre. He looks for the top right. It’s not a particularly good effort, but 
slams into the back of Briggs, and takes a huge left-turn into the left-hand 
side of the net, bouncing at an agonisingly slow speed past Kean, wrong-footed 
and rendered impotent.

62 min: Somehow, Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> 
are still within touching distance of Tottenham. So it’s time to make their 
last roll of the dice. An attacking change: the midfielder Ambrose is replaced 
by the striker Sordell.
 
60 min: I should be writing Colchester United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> (Chadli 60) in big 
letters. But I’m not. Kane bursts down the left, into the area, and slips the 
ball low to Chadli. He spins to make space. He’s free, eight yards out. He’s 
got to score! But he batters a rising shot onto the crossbar, and that’s that. 
What a miss!
 
58 min: Kane powers into the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> box from the left, but can’t 
find space to shoot. The ball finds its way to Chadli, who twists and turns on 
the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, but isn’t able to make room for an 
effort on goal. Colchester’s makeshift defence slammed the door shut very 
impressively there. For a brief moment it looked like a second Spurs goal was 
on the cards.
 
56 min: Porter and Wimmer challenge a ball down the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> inside-left channel. Wimmer 
sticks his leg out to guide it back to Vorm. Porter goes over Wimmer’s leg and 
claims a penalty, but he’s never getting that. Spurs meanwhile make their first 
change, hooking Lamela and throwing on Dembele.
 
55 min: Yes, much better indeed. Ambrose skitters down the right and curls a 
glorious deep cross towards Porter at the far post. It’s begging to be met by a 
diving header. But Porter tries to meet it with a high boot, and the chance is 
gone.
 
54 min: A speculative hoof down the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> right. Moncur sticks out a 
boot and takes it down brilliantly. He romps down the wing and this time finds 
Ambrose in the middle. Ambrose shoots, and the effort from the edge of the box 
is deflected inches wide of the right-hand post. Had that been on target, it 
was creeping in with Vorm’s feet planted. From the corner, the ball finds 
Massey wide on the left. He blooters a shot goalwards, but Vorm has it covered. 
This is much better from the home side!
 
52 min: Garvan rakes a delicious pass down the left flank to release Massey 
into space. Massey makes it to the box, before pulling the ball back for 
Moncur, who turns in a tight space and sees his snapshot blocked pretty much 
the nanosecond the ball comes off his boot. Ambrose was in the middle, in 
space, waiting for a pass there.
 
50 min: Massey has been busy in attack for the home side. He earns himself a 
little space down the left, and decides to take a shot from distance. It’s a 
weak effort, and deflected through to Vorm.
 
49 min: Lamela appears to be in the mood to put this tie to bed early in this 
second half. He dribbles in from the left, and again looks for the bottom 
right. Again his effort is wide, but he’s getting chances.Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> have come out a little cold.

47 min: Briggs tries to Beckenbauer his way through the middle of the park. 
Bad decision. He gifts the ball to Kane, who drifts down the Spurs right before 
dinking the ball across to Lamela, who takes a touch to burst clear into the
Colchester <https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> box down the 
inside-left channel. He’s got Brindley on his shoulder, and the full back does 
enough to put him off. Lamela goes for the bottom right, and squeezes the ball 
past Kean, but also past the right-hand post.
 
Great news regarding Alex Wynter: he’s conscious and sitting up in hospital. 
So hopefully, touch all sorts of wooden items, he’ll be OK. Spurs get the ball 
rolling for the second half. And here’s Steve Wiles with a Colchester-centric 
take on that eventful first half: “All things considered, when you bear in mind 
we’ve lost our entire central defence, played for a quarter of the half with 
ten men, are currently playing an inexperienced kid at centre back (but watch 
him, he’s gonna be good) along with a left back who finds himself there by 
accident ... the sheer fact we started to find our way into this match is a 
credit. Even if we clearly look like blokes running after a ball vs athletes I 
couldn’t be more proud of the guys.”

Not the worst scoreline for United at half time, given the early loss of both 
central defenders, and Tottenham’s subsequent dominance. In fact, had Moncur 
picked the right pass towards the end of that half, the teams might be going in 
level. Strange game in that respect, though Spurs have been much the better 
side. Could be a fascinating second half. Stay tuned!
 
45 min +5: Vincent-Young hasn’t lost the confidence to attack. He makes off 
down the left again, drifts inside, and so nearly releases Moncur, cutting in 
from the right, with a sliderule pass. But Dier steps in to intercept, having 
read Vincent-Young’s intentions perfectly.
 
45 min +3: Vincent-Young attacks down the left. But he passes inside to 
nobody, and Kane’s first to the ball. Kane drives into theColchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> half, and tries to burst past 
Kent. If he manages it, he’s clear on goal, but Kent stays strong, block 
tackles, and clears upfield. Marvellous defending!
 
45 min +1: Eriksen skates across the front of the Colchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester> area, left to right. He 
considers shooting, but slips Trippier free into the box instead. Trippier 
fires into the centre, low and hard. Kane can’t quite guide it home from close 
range, and Kent is able to hook clear while sliding along hysterically on the 
seat of his pants. Brilliant football all round.
 
45 min: There will be six minutes added to this half, in the wake of Wynter’s 
early injury.
 
44 min: Space for Davies down the left. Once again he reaches the byline. But 
his pullback doesn’t find Kane. Kent hoicks clear.
 
43 min: A lot of Spurs passing. But right now, they’re going nowhere.
 
41 min: Moncur dribbles down the middle of the park at pace. Spurs are light 
at the back, and if Moncur rolls a pass down the inside-right channel for 
Porter, he’ll send his strike partner free on goal. But he’s high on life, and 
decides to go it alone. Spurs finally swarm around him before he can reach the 
box. Far too late, he tries to find Porter, by now on the left, but his flick 
is no good. A real chance for the League One side to draw level has been 
spurned.
