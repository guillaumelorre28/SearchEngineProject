The Colombian forward Felipe Pardo scored twice after coming on as a 
second-half substitute to keep Olympiakos on course for the last 16 of the
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> as they 
defeated Dinamo Zagreb 2-1.

But it was Dinamo, despite their defensive tactics, who took the lead when 
Armin Hodzic headed home in the 21st minute.Olympiakos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/olympiakos> squandered a golden chance to 
equalise after 54 minutes when the Dinamo goalkeeper Eduardo saved a penalty by 
Kostas Fortounis, who then also failed to capitalise on the rebound.

Pardo then came on and with his first touch levelled the scores in the 65th 
minute, curling a left-footed shot past Eduardo after the former West Bromwich 
Albion striker Ideye Brown had beaten two defenders to set him up.

The Colombian then sealed Olympiakosâ€™ third successive win in Group F in the 
final minute. They have nine points as doBayern Munich who thrashed Arsenal 5-1

yellow card with 11 minutes left, and he will miss the trip to Arsenal on 24
