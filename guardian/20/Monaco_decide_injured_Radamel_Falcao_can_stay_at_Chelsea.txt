The Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/radamel-falcao> looks set to stay at 
Stamford Bridge for the rest of the season after Monaco ruled out taking him 
back early.

The Colombian is on loan from the Ligue 1 club but has struggled to make a 
notable contribution since José Mourinhobrought him in during the summer

.

Falcao has not featured at all since the end of October because of a thigh 
injury, on which he underwent checks at Monaco’s training ground this week.

Monaco believe he faces an extended spell out of action

, meaning recalling him to the Stade Louis II is not an appealing option.

The Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said in an interview on the club’s 
DailyMotion page: “Falcao is currently injured. He has six to eight weeks to go 
like that. We have decided not to take him back toMonaco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> for the moment.”

Halfway through a season-long loan with Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, the former Atletico Madrid 
striker has scored only one goal. He went through a similar goal drought while 
at Manchester United last season.

With Diego Costa and Loïc Rémy ahead of him in the pecking order even a fit 
Falcao would appear unlikely to get much playing time with Chelsea for the rest 
of the season.

Press Association Sport understands Falcao recently rejected approaches from 
Mexican and Turkish clubs.

His contract with Monaco expires in 2018. Monaco signed the striker from 
Atlético in 2013 but he spent just one season in Ligue 1, suffering a major 
knee injury midway through it, before embarking on a disappointing loan spell 
at Old Trafford.
