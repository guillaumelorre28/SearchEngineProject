Who should play Othello? In Britain, the last white men to do so, as far as I 
can tell, wereAnthony Hopkins <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anthony-hopkins>
 in the 1981 BBC Shakespeare series and Michael Gambon in a late 1980s 
production in Scarborough. Since then, the play has been enriched by the 
casting of black actors as Othello. But, much as I welcome this, and support
Lenny Henry <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lenny-henry> championing 
greater diversity on televison, I wonder whether we should place a lifetime ban 
on white actors playing the role.

With the exception of Paul Robeson – in 1959, long past his peak – the first 
Othellos I saw were white: Harry Andrews,Laurence Olivier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier> (electrifying), Brewster Mason, 
Donald Sinden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/interactive/2009/feb/04/theatre>, Paul 
Scofield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/mar/20/paulscofield19222008>
 and Orson Welles in his weirdly compelling 1952 film. Since then we have seen 
a succession of notable black actors in the role including Willard White (1987),
David Harewood <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-harewood> (1998), Ray 
Fearon (1999),Nonso Anonzie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/nov/10/theatre2> (2004), Sello Maake 
ka-Ncube <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/25/theatre2> (2004), Henry 
(2009),Clarke Peters <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/clarke-peters> (2011) 
andAdrian Lester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/23/adrian-lester-red-velvet-ira-aldridge-othello>
 (2013).

But I've been struck lately by a simple fact: the more you put the play into 
modern dress, you more you favour Iago by giving him credence as a barrack-room 
fanatic, as withIan McKellen <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen> 
andAntony Sher <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/antony-sher>, or as a 
military pedagogue, as withSimon Russell Beale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/simon-russell-beale>, whom I seem to recall 
reading a 1940s Penguin Classic.

All this is a way of saying that my preferred production and performance was 
that ofMichael Grandage <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/michael-grandage> at 
the Donmar in 2007, starringChiwetel Ejiofor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chiwetel-ejiofor>. Set in the 17th century,
Grandage's production 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/dec/05/theatre.shakespeare> reminded 
you why the play is called Othello. And Ejiofor gave us everything we could 
hope for: the dignity, the rage, the self-delusion, the sublime word-music. 
With an achingly beautiful Desdemona fromKelly Reilly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/02/kelly-reilly-above-suspicion-interview>
 and a sharp-tongued Emilia from Michelle Fairley, Grandage's production 
ushered us into the world of high tragedy.
