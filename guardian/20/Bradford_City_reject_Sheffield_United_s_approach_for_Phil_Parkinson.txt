Bradford City have turned down an approach from Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> to speak to Phil 
Parkinson.

The Blades are in the hunt for a new manager after sacking Nigel Clough and 
his entire backroom team on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/25/sheffield-united-sack-manager-nigel-clough>
. But Bradford are desperate to keep hold of Parkinson, 47, who has a year left 
to run on his current contract at Valley Parade.

Bradford’s joint-chairman Mark Lawn said: “It’s true we’ve been contacted by 
Sheffield United. They want to speak to Phil, but we’ve turned their request 
down. We’ve made it perfectly clear that we want Phil to stay.”

When asked if Bradford’s board will open talks with Parkinson over a new deal, 
Lawn added: “That’s up to Phil. We’d be happy to do that. He has another year 
left on his contract and he knows we always look to negotiate new contracts at 
the end of their terms.”

Lawn refused to comment on whether Parkinson had a get-out clause in his deal 
that the Blades had failed to activate.

“I’m not willing to discuss the finer points of Phil’s deal,” he added.

Parkinson agreed a three-year deal at the end of the 2012-13 season after 
leading Bradford to the League Cup final and to promotion from League Two. He 
guided the club to a seventh-placed finish inLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> this season, missing 
out on the play-offs by four points.

Clough paid the price for the Blades’ failure to win promotion via the 
play-offs when they lost to Swindon Town in the semi-finals.

The South Yorkshire club, searching for their eighth manager since being 
relegated from the Premier League in 2007, will embark on a fifth straight 
campaign in the third tier in August.
