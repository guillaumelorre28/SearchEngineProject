The Brechin City goalkeeper Graeme Smith has admitted Saturday’s gaffe when he 
turned up at the wrong stadium for his side’s meeting withStenhousemuir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stenhousemuir> was not the first time he 
has got his wires crossed over the venue for a match.

Smith, who mistakenly arrived at Stenhousemuir’s Ochilview Park

 for the Scottish League One match before realising it was a home match, had to 
drive 89 miles to make it to Glebe Park for the kick-off. The 32-year-old made 
it in time but could not prevent his side from slipping to a 2-1 defeat that 
kept them bottom of the table.

In an interview with the Daily Record

, Smith said he will have to be more prepared having revealed he made a similar 
mistake during his youth team days with Rangers.

“I thought it was a bit strange when I arrived as I didn’t see any of the City 
players and Alan Grieve our kit man who’s always early was nowhere to be seen,” 
he said.

“When I saw another team arrive with different coloured track suits it 
suddenly clicked that I was in the wrong place. I phoned my wife to find out 
where I should be and she told me we were playing at Glebe Park.

“That left me with just under an hour and a half to get myself to Glebe Park 
which is just over 85 miles away. Luckily the roads were fine and I arrived 25 
minutes before kick-off.

Smith added: “Incredibly, this is not the first time it’s happened to me as 
when I was a kid with Rangers I remember turning up to the wrong ground. It’s 
something that I don’t want to make a habit of so I’ll be keeping a close look 
at the fixture card in future.”
