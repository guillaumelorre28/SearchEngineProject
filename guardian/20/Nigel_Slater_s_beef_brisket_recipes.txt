You’ll need a spoon. The broth surrounding the beef has been in the oven for 
four hours, along with a handful of caramelised shallots, black peppercorns, 
thyme sprigs and bay leaves. I could have used traditional stock, but preferred 
to make one out of dried mushrooms: a dark coloured, bosky liquor in which to 
coax a cheap cut of meat towards tenderness. The brisket was bargain enough, as 
you would expect from a cut situated at the front of the belly, a piece of meat 
that works hard throughout the animal’s life. I asked the butcher to leave the 
fat on my brisket in place, so that it would soften to a quivering mass and 
slowly enrich the gravy during its long sojourn in the oven.

If you crave homely warmth and bonhomie, head for the cheap, fat-rich cuts of 
meat

I cut the meat into thick, wobbly slices and laid them in wide, shallow 
dishes, the sort you might use for pasta, then spooned the shiny, 
mahogany-coloured broth round the meat. There was a temptation to add soft, 
pale dollops of mashed parsnips or butter beans, but instead I voted for swede, 
mashing it to a cream with a ridiculous quantity of butter and black pepper. 
Ideally, there would have been a thick fog outside, or, better still, a howling 
storm crashing at the windows. But you can’t have everything.

What we did have was enough silky brown meat for the next day, which I pulled 
into jagged strips and tossed with vinegar-crisped cabbage, finely shredded 
kale (yes, that again) and some sprouted radish seeds from the wholefood shop. 
I dressed it with a cool dill and mustard seed-flecked cream dressing.

If you want a quick fix then eat an expensive cut of meat, but if you crave 
homely warmth and bonhomie, the feeling that all is well with our world 
(especially when it isn’t) then it’s the cheap, fat-rich cuts to head for. The 
ones that enrich their cooking liquor to a point where you can feel the 
goodness seeping through to your soul with every mouthful. You’re going to need 
that spoon.

Braised beef brisket with porcini and onion gravy

The dried porcini will add about three quid to the cost of this dish, but you 
get a lot of flavour for your money. We ate this with mashed swede, and loads 
of butter and black pepper.

Serves 6-8
dried porcini 25g
beef brisket 1.5kg, rolled and tied
banana shallots 6
carrots 350g, small ones
black peppercorns 12
bay leaves 4
thyme sprigs 6
swede 1, mashed to serve

Put the kettle on. Set the oven at 230C/gas mark 8. Put the dried porcini in a 
heatproof bowl, then pour the boiling water over it, cover with a plate and 
leave to soak for 25 minutes. This will give you a deeply flavourful broth.

Place the rolled and tied brisket in a large casserole, then put it in the 
oven and roast for 25 minutes. Peel and trim the shallots and halve them 
lengthways. Scrub and halve the carrots lengthways. Add them to the casserole 
together with the porcini and its broth, the peppercorns, bay and thyme, then 
cover with a lid. Lower the heat to 160C and bake for 4 hours.

Remove the brisket from its broth and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Put the 
casserole over a high heat, bring the contents to the boil and leave until 
reduced by about one-third. Slice the brisket into thick pieces, dividing it 
between deep plates, then spoon over the broth and vegetables.

For the mashed swede Peel a large swede and cut it into large chunks, pile it 
into a steamer basket or colander and cook over a pan of boiling water for 20 
minutes until soft. Tip into a bowl and crush thoroughly with a potato masher. 
Add a thick slice of butter (about 30g) and lots of coarsely ground black 
pepper. Beat firmly with a wooden spoon till fluffy. Serve in generous mounds 
in the broth that surrounds the beef.

The clean crunch of raw cabbage and kohlrabi gives a refreshing reboot to 
yesterday’s brisket. Slice thickly then tear into rough-edged shards, pulling 
at the meat with your fingertips.

brisket cooked leftovers
white cabbage 150g
red cabbage 125g
white wine vinegar 50ml
kohlrabi 1, small 
lemon 1, juiced
parsley 20g
yellow mustard seeds 1 tbsp
black mustard seeds 1 tbsp
olive oil 3 tbsp
dill 10g
kale 4 small leaves
sprouted seeds 4 handfuls
double cream 4 tbsp


Finely shred the red and white cabbages and mix together in a large bowl. Pour 
over the vinegar, toss together and leave for 20 minutes.

The clean crunch of raw cabbage and kohlrabi gives a refreshing reboot to 
yesterday’s brisket

Slice the kohlrabi as thinly as possible. You should be able to see through 
it. Place the slices on a plate, slightly overlapping. Squeeze the lemon juice 
over them and set aside.

Finely chop the parsley and add to the shredded cabbage. Warm a frying pan 
over a moderate heat and add the black and yellow mustard seeds. When the seeds 
start to pop, tip them into a small bowl and add the olive oil. Finely chop the 
dill and combine with the mustard seeds.

Wash, dry and finely shred the kale leaves then add them to the cabbage. Wash 
the sprouted seeds and toss with the cabbage and kale. Tease the leftover 
brisket into small shards or chunks, and add to the salad.

Transfer the cabbage and beef to a serving dish or platter. Stir the double 
cream into the mustard seed and oil, season lightly with salt and black pepper, 
then trickle over the salad and serve.
