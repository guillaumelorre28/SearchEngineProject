Andy Carroll <https://www.theguardian.com/football/andy-carroll> is back on 
the treatment table and will miss Sunday’s FA Cup fifth-round tie at Blackburn 
Rovers.

The 27-year-old had just returned from a month out with a hamstring problem 
when he suffered an adductor injury after coming on as a substitute during last 
weekend’s2-2 draw at Norwich

Carroll has been beset by injury problems since joining the club and has 
started only 31 Premier League games in two and a half years. But the 
co-chairman David Gold hopes the latest setback will not mean another lengthy 
lay-off for their £15m club-record signing.

Gold wrote on Twitter: “Andy has a slight injury and will be rested for the 
game against Blackburn.”

Slaven Bilic faces a striker shortage for the trip to Ewood Park after Enner 
Valencia was also injured against Norwich. The Ecuador international limped off 
after sustaining an ankle knock midway through the second half at Carrow Road.

With Diafra Sakho still sidelined because of a thigh injury and Nikica Jelavic 
completing his move

 to the Chinese second division side Beijing Renhe earlier this week, Bilic may 
have to throwthe January signing Emmanuel Emenike

 in for his full debut up front.

Bilic does have some positive fitness news, however, after Manuel Lanzini 
returned to training this week. The Argentinian midfielder, who has scored four 
goals in 14 appearances this season, is available after six weeks outwith a 
thigh injury
