So just the one goal, a pretty scrappy one from Ji, but Chelsea’s overall play 
was far superior with the goalscorer and Eni Aluko providing plenty of threat. 
Notts never really got going, and barely created anything.

That’s Chelsea’s first major trophy, after losing out on the WSL title in the 
last minutes of last season. Aluko praises manager Emma Hayes in her post-match 
interview, who herself says she knewChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> were going to win from the 
opening minute.

90 mins + 2: A foul throw! Sophie Walton doesn’t carry out the most basic task 
in football correctly, and is called for it in the closing minutes. Now THAT is 
careless.

90 mins + 1: Three minutes of added time though, and Notts could still cause 
some problems. However Davidson makes her way into the corner with the help of 
a lovely Cruyff turn that leaves a few defenders grasping.

89 mins: Borges does brilliantly to dribble the ball right into the corner, 
then wins a corner-kick by smacking the thing off the shins of a defender. They 
commit a grand total of one player to the box for said kick.

85 mins: Chance for O’Sullivan shortly after coming on. Notts going for the 
‘mixer’ approach now, lifting the ball into the area where the sub is 
relatively unmarked, but mistimes her jump to the point that she can’t get 
anything on the header.

78 mins: Bit of a Hail Mary ball into the middle for Notts, hoying the thing 
towards the back post where the sub Whelan is, but she can’t quite wrap her 
foot around the thing and the effort goes wide.

73 mins: From that corner flicks from Fahey and Aluko find Flaherty on the 
edge of the six-yard box, but she lefts it over the bar with the outside of her 
right foot.

72 mins: Chelsea counter at some pace, with Aluko again down the right, but 
this time she doesn’t do quite as well, jinking right when the pass left to Ji 
looked on, and she can’t get either a cross or shot into a dangerous area. She 
does manage to win a corner, though.

70 mins: Ji tries an effort that we’ll file under ‘ambitious’ from about 35 
yards out. It’s straight at Telford, but a bit of late dip and a bounce in 
front of the County keeper at least makes it a little difficult, but she 
gathers safely in the end.

66 mins: More Aluko (other players are on the pitch, promise), as she skims 
over a cross from the right, but it bounces away andChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> can’t capitalise on the chance.

64 mins: There’s Aluko again, given as much time as she likes on the edge of 
the box before firing in a low right-footed shot across goal, but Telford does 
well to not only make the save, but push it away from the lurkingChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> forwards hoping for a follow-up.

63 mins: And up the other end Aluko gets away once more, dashing down the 
right having been played in by Spence, but she dithers slightly and the 
cut-back, aiming in theory for Ji, is pretty shoddy and the attack breaks down.

61 mins: Close for Notts! Twice! A corner comes over from the right, it drops 
out to the Canadian on the edge of the box and she fires in a shot, it deflects 
off Flaherty and goes just - just - wide. From the next corner Crichton gets up 
at the near post and heads towards goal, but Davidson is waiting on the line to 
clear. Closest they’ve come all game, and all in the same minute.

59 mins: Salty challenge by Clarke on Chapman, initially trying a little shove 
in the back but then going full out with a hack to the side of the shins. No 
censure beyond a metaphorical wagged finger from the ref, mind.

56 mins: And here is that change - Susi is on, with Rachel Williams coming 
off. A full-back for a forward seems like a slightly odd move when you’re 1-0 
down, but Susi might play on the wing with Ellen White pushed up top.

determined to play all the positions.

Blundell finding herself in oodles of space on the right and she puts over a

home, completely missing the ball around eight yards from goal.

A fairly even one until around the half hour mark, but then Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> - or more specifically Eni Aluko 
- seemed to get their arses in gear and caused some serious bother, largely 
from the left, from where she created the only goal for Ji.

44 mins: Smashing move from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, started by Aluko in the 
left-back position for some reason (although her performance is starting to 
resemble Superman playing table tennis against himself), with some slick 
passing opening up some space on the right, the cross comes over and Drew 
Spence attempts what we’ll call an ‘ambitious’ overhead kick, but she skews it 
a fair way wide.

40 mins: That five minute burst of creativity from Aluko was hugely 
impressive, and this Notts defence don’t look terribly certain about how to 
deal with not just her pace, but her close control.

quick feet again making a chance as she pokes it to Ji around ten yards out. 
She can’t get the shot away immediately, but after a brief scramble the ball 
pops out and eludes Telford, giving Ji the easiest task of poking it over an

And that’ll be it for this one. Cheers for reading, and ta ra. 
 
Katie Chapman leads the Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
players up the steps, and lifts the FA Cup for the ninth - ninth! - time, with 
the help of Claire Rafferty.
 
So just the one goal, a pretty scrappy one from Ji, but Chelsea’s overall play 
was far superior with the goalscorer and Eni Aluko providing plenty of threat. 
Notts never really got going, and barely created anything.

That’s Chelsea’s first major trophy, after losing out on the WSL title in the 
last minutes of last season. Aluko praises manager Emma Hayes in her post-match 
interview, who herself says she knewChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> were going to win from the 
opening minute.
 
And they deserve it, too...

90 mins + 2: A foul throw! Sophie Walton doesn’t carry out the most basic task 
in football correctly, and is called for it in the closing minutes. Now THAT is 
careless.
 
90 mins + 1: Three minutes of added time though, and Notts could still cause 
some problems. However Davidson makes her way into the corner with the help of 
a lovely Cruyff turn that leaves a few defenders grasping.
 
90 mins: Chelsea employ the old ‘make a late sub by taking off the furthest 
player from the bench’ to wind down a bit of time, with Ji jogging across the 
pitch to be replaced by Laura Coombs.
 
89 mins: Borges does brilliantly to dribble the ball right into the corner, 
then wins a corner-kick by smacking the thing off the shins of a defender. They 
commit a grand total of one player to the box for said kick.
 
87 mins: Chelsea bunkering in for the last few minutes now. Could be an error 
to invite the late pressure...
 
86 mins: By-the-by, Manchester City are getting shanked 4-0 in a pre-season 
friendly against Stuttgart, and it’s not even half-time yet. Oy vey.
 
85 mins: Chance for O’Sullivan shortly after coming on. Notts going for the 
‘mixer’ approach now, lifting the ball into the area where the sub is 
relatively unmarked, but mistimes her jump to the point that she can’t get 
anything on the header.
 
83 mins: Ji hoys a ball into the middle looking for Chapman, who can’t get a 
proper head on it but the ball does drop to Spence, who steadies herself on the 
edge of the box but drags the right-footed shot well wide.
 
82 mins: Another Notts sub, with Fiona O’Sullivan on for Crichton. Meanwhile - 
freestyle!

80 mins: Chelsea’s first change - Ana Marques Borges is introduced, with Eni 
Aluko withdrawn. Can only assume there’s an injury involved there, or that 
Aluko has knackered herself out trying to play about five different positions.
 
78 mins: Bit of a Hail Mary ball into the middle for Notts, hoying the thing 
towards the back post where the sub Whelan is, but she can’t quite wrap her 
foot around the thing and the effort goes wide.
 Today’s very respectable attendance figure. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA  
76 mins: Sub for Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> - 
Danielle Buet is off, and Aileen Whelan comes on.
 
74 mins: 30,710 inside Wembley for this one, which as you’d imagine is a 
record for a Women’s FA Cup final.
 
73 mins: From that corner flicks from Fahey and Aluko find Flaherty on the 
edge of the six-yard box, but she lefts it over the bar with the outside of her 
right foot.
 
72 mins: Chelsea counter at some pace, with Aluko again down the right, but 
this time she doesn’t do quite as well, jinking right when the pass left to Ji 
looked on, and she can’t get either a cross or shot into a dangerous area. She 
does manage to win a corner, though.
 
70 mins: Ji tries an effort that we’ll file under ‘ambitious’ from about 35 
yards out. It’s straight at Telford, but a bit of late dip and a bounce in 
front of the County keeper at least makes it a little difficult, but she 
gathers safely in the end.
 
66 mins: More Aluko (other players are on the pitch, promise), as she skims 
over a cross from the right, but it bounces away andChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> can’t capitalise on the chance.
 
64 mins: There’s Aluko again, given as much time as she likes on the edge of 
the box before firing in a low right-footed shot across goal, but Telford does 
well to not only make the save, but push it away from the lurkingChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> forwards hoping for a follow-up.
 
63 mins: And up the other end Aluko gets away once more, dashing down the 
right having been played in by Spence, but she dithers slightly and the 
cut-back, aiming in theory for Ji, is pretty shoddy and the attack breaks down.
 
61 mins: Close for Notts! Twice! A corner comes over from the right, it drops 
out to the Canadian on the edge of the box and she fires in a shot, it deflects 
off Flaherty and goes just - just - wide. From the next corner Crichton gets up 
at the near post and heads towards goal, but Davidson is waiting on the line to 
clear. Closest they’ve come all game, and all in the same minute.
 
59 mins: Salty challenge by Clarke on Chapman, initially trying a little shove 
in the back but then going full out with a hack to the side of the shins. No 
censure beyond a metaphorical wagged finger from the ref, mind.

58 mins: The boss is watching. Can everyone send in a few emails saying how 
brilliant I am, please?

56 mins: And here is that change - Susi is on, with Rachel Williams coming 
off. A full-back for a forward seems like a slightly odd move when you’re 1-0 
down, but Susi might play on the wing with Ellen White pushed up top.
 
55 mins: Almost a chance for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, as Blundell slips a pass 
through to Spence, but Turner does well to usher the ball away from that 
particular brand of trouble.
 
54 mins: Looks like an early change for Notts in this second-half, with Dunia 
Susi having removed the trackie and receiving her final instructions.
 
51 mins: Looks like Ji is playing a little deeper in this half, with Spence 
pushed further up field. Aluko again pops up in the left-back region, seemingly 
determined to play all the positions.
 
48 mins: Davidson makes tracks down the Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> right before quite literally 
slipping over. One of those occasions when the football could’ve been nicely 
enhanced with a swanee whistle.
 
46 mins: Notts quite literally get the ball rolling. And Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are on the attack straight away, 
Blundell finding herself in oodles of space on the right and she puts over a 
cross, but Aluko can’t quite get her feet organised enough to turn the thing 
home, completely missing the ball around eight yards from goal.
 
And the players are back out for the second half. Looks like no changes for 
either side.
 
A fairly even one until around the half hour mark, but then Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> - or more specifically Eni Aluko 
- seemed to get their arses in gear and caused some serious bother, largely 
from the left, from where she created the only goal for Ji.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeep, peeeeeeeeeeep, peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: One minute of added time. 
 
44 mins: Smashing move from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, started by Aluko in the 
left-back position for some reason (although her performance is starting to 
resemble Superman playing table tennis against himself), with some slick 
passing opening up some space on the right, the cross comes over and Drew 
Spence attempts what we’ll call an ‘ambitious’ overhead kick, but she skews it 
a fair way wide.
 
42 mins: First yellow card of the final goes to Katie Chapman, who goes into 
the book for what we’ll call a ‘pragmatic’ pull back on Turner, who looked like 
she was away down the right.

40 mins: That five minute burst of creativity from Aluko was hugely 
impressive, and this Notts defence don’t look terribly certain about how to 
deal with not just her pace, but her close control.
 
37 mins: Aluko was at the heart of things again, belting in from the left, her 
quick feet again making a chance as she pokes it to Ji around ten yards out. 
She can’t get the shot away immediately, but after a brief scramble the ball 
pops out and eludes Telford, giving Ji the easiest task of poking it over an 
unguarded line.
