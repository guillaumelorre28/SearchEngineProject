But Bilic says he has no intention of getting rid of Carroll, who has looked

.

“The club are not willing to listen to offers,” Bilic said. “We want Andy to 
stay and perform like he does in most games.

“Nobody at the club wants to sell him, he’s a very good player. But whenever 
he scores a couple of goals the rumours start.

“The only way he can stop the rumours is to play badly, which we don’t want 
him to do. We don’t want to sell him. He’s very good in the dressing room and I 
know he’s happy here.”

Bilic also reported positive fitness news regarding the midfielder Manuel 
Lanzini.

It was feared the Argentinian would be sidelined for up to six weeks with the 
thigh injury he suffered against Liverpool last Saturday, but Bilic said: “He’s 
working hard on his recovery and hopefully he will be back in two or three 
weeks.”

Victor Moses will not be fit for Saturday’s FA Cup tie at home to Wolves, but 
is due back in full training next week, while the striker Diafra Sakho could be 
back at the beginning of February following a thigh injury.
