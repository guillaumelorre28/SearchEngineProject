Albanian authorities have issued arrest warrants for Leyton Orient’s owner 
Francesco Becchetti and his mother, with the pair and two business associates 
accused of fraud-related offences and money laundering over a failed 
hydroelectric scheme that allegedly cost the government tens of millions of 
euros in grants and unpaid taxes.

Becchetti, who bought the east London club last July, made his fortune in 
waste disposal and recycling but now faces having his assets seized in Albania. 
Prosecutors said they issued the warrants on Monday.

Becchetti began investments in Albania in the 1990s following the fall of 
Communism, but a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office said he no longer lives 
in the country.

The investigation into his activities was launched over a major hydroelectric 
plant that was never built. The charges against him carry a maximum prison 
sentence of 15 years.

There were reports last month

that Becchetti is considering selling the club following their relegation to 
League Two. He purchased 90% of the club from Barry Hearn for £4m.
