which the city of Cambridge is known.”

these are serious allegations.”

The Cambridge Fans United chairman, Robert Osbourn, said: “I am aware the club 
is investigating the claims and is seeking to identify those involved so 
appropriate action can be taken.

“CFU supports the club’s investigation wholeheartedly and would urge anyone 
who saw and heard what happened to contact the club.”
