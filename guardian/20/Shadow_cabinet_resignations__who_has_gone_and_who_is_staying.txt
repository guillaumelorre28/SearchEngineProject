Gone from shadow cabinet

Hilary Benn
The shadow foreign secretary was sacked in a phone call at 1am on Sunday after 
making clear that he had lost faith in Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. His card had 
been marked since he intervened in last December’s parliamentary debate on 
airstrikes in Syria.

Heidi Alexander
The shadow health secretary gained fans within the party for mastering the 
health brief and holding Jeremy Hunt to account. As MP for Lewisham East, she 
backed Andy Burnham to be leader last year and emailed activists during the 
campaign to say that Corbyn’s election “would cause division”.

Gloria De Piero
The MP for Ashfield and former GMTV presenter was a surprise member of 
Corbyn’s shadow cabinet given that she is a member of the Blairite pressure 
group Progress. The shadow minister for young people and voter registration is 
seen as a prized asset because she is a working-class woman who cuts through to 
traditional core voters.

Ian Murray
The Scottish secretary was seen as impossible to sack because he is Labour’s 
only surviving MP in Scotland. Murray, 39, is a party moderate who has 
attempted to work with Corbyn. Colleagues say he has become increasingly vocal 
about Corbyn’s alleged inability to lead a campaign.

Lilian Greenwood
The shadow secretary for transport took up the job in 2011 under Ed Miliband. 
Closely associated with Unison, the MP for Nottingham South is one of a group 
of union-backed frontbenchers who believe that Corbyn cannot carry on as leader.

Lucy Powell
The shadow education secretary ran Ed Miliband’s campaign to become Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader. The MP for Manchester 
Central is the daughter of a social worker and a headteacher. Powell disclosed 
in September that she had not spoken to Corbyn during her previous three years 
in parliament. She was one of a handful of party centrists who received 
promotions under his leadership last year.

Kerry McCarthy
The shadow environment secretary was once seen as a Gordon Brown loyalist. The 
MP for Bristol East was said to be unhappy with Corbyn’s plans to scrap Trident 
and has expressed concerns to friends about Corbyn’s lack of leadership.

Seema Malhotra
The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury had previously remained loyal to 
Corbyn despite being understood to have had some personal misgivings about his 
ability to lead and his economic policies. The MP for Feltham and Heston is a 
former adviser to Corbyn critics Liam Byrne and Ian Austin.

Vernon Coaker 
The shadow Northern Ireland secretary has struggled with serving in Corbyn’s 
team. The veteran MP for Gedling has told journalists that he felt obliged to 
join the shadow cabinet so that he could argue from the “centre” of the party.

Lord Falconer
Charles Falconer, the shadow justice secretary and former close associate of 
Tony Blair, was an incongruous fit with Corbyn. In September he upset Corbyn 
supporters by disagreeing with the Labour leader’s plan to strip the Bank of 
England of its independence. In January he publicly disagreed with the decision 
to sack the Europe minister, Pat McFadden.

Karl Turner 
The shadow attorney general was appointed in January 2016. The MP for Kingston 
upon Hull East has rarely rebelled against party policy, according to the 
websiteTheyworkforyou.com <http://www.theyworkforyou.com/>. He had stepped up 
to replace Catherine McKinnell, who quit complaining of Labour’s “increasingly 
negative path”.

Chris Bryant
Chris Bryant was never a key Corbyn ally, though that did not stop him 
standing up for his party leader in the House of Commons. He was shadow culture 
secretary and turned down the defence brief over what he called major policy 
differences, ending up with a demotion to shadow leader of the Commons.

Lisa Nandy
The MP for Wigan since 2010 has resigned as shadow secretary of state for 
energy and climate change. She is seen as being on the left wing of the party, 
where Corbyn’s more natural allies are.

Owen Smith
Smith has been MP for Pontypridd since 2010 and was formerly a BBC radio 
producer. He has resigned as shadow secretary of state for work and pensions 
and called – with Nandy – for Tom Watson to be caretaker leader.

Angela Eagle
The MP for Wallasey is chair of Labour’s National Policy Forum, and has 
resigned as shadow business secretary and shadow first secretary of state. She 
was minister of state for pensions and ageing in the last Labour government.

John Healey
The former trade union and charity campaigner has been the MP for Wentworth 
and Dearne since 1997. He has resigned as shadow minister of state for housing 
and planning.

Nia Griffith
The Welsh Labour politician has resigned as shadow Welsh secretary after 
serving in the role for nine months. Griffith has been MP for Llanelli since 
2005. She was born in Dublin and her family is from south Wales. Before 
entering parliament she worked as a teacher.

Maria Eagle 
The MP for Garston and Halewood has resigned as shadow secretary of state for 
culture, media and sport. In the last Labour government she was a minister of 
state for both the equalities office and the Ministry of Justice.

Kate Green
The MP for Stretford and Urmston has resigned as shadow minister for women and 
equalities.

Luciana Berger 
The Liverpool Wavertree MP has resigned as shadow mental health minister. She 
backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election and was a shadow health minister 
under Ed Miliband.

Staying as shadow cabinet members


Andy Burnham 
The shadow home secretary has tweeted that he is not “going to take part in a 
coup”. Burnham, the MP for Leigh, ran for leader and lost out to Ed Miliband in 
2010. He hopes to be Greater Manchester’s first directly elected mayor in a 
vote next May.

John McDonnell
McDonnell is seen as Corbyn’s primary ally, although the shadow chancellor was 
forced on Sunday morning to deny rumours that he was manoeuvring to replace his 
friend as leader. “I will never stand for leadership of the Labour party. If 
Jeremy has to stand for another leadership election, I will chair his campaign 
and I think the Labour party members will elect him again – but I think that’s 
unnecessary,” he said.

Diane Abbott
Abbott has been the Labour leader’s fiercest advocate. The now shadow health 
secretary did the rounds on Sunday morning’s TV shows insisting that Corbyn 
would not stand down as leader and would win any leadership election that was 
called.

Jon Trickett
The shadow secretary of state for local government told the Guardian he was 
100% behind Corbyn. “We need to get on with the business of offering an 
alternative vision of a Britain outside the EU to the one offered by [Michael] 
Gove and [Nigel] Farage, which is small-minded, inward looking and 
chauvinistic,” he said.

Emily Thornberry
Thornberry, who represents the neighbouring constituency to Corbyn’s, told the 
BBC that she was surprised by the resignations and that only the shadow 
Scotland secretary,Ian Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ian-murray>
, who resigned on Sunday morning, had spoken out against Corbyn at Friday’s 
shadow cabinet meeting.


Lord Bassam of Brighton
A former leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Steve Bassam was made a 
life peer in 1997 and has been the chief whip in the House of Lords since May 
2010. Bassam is refusing to back Corbyn as leader; he can’t resign from the 
shadow cabinet but is refusing to attend meetings until he leaves.

Angela Smith
The Labour MP for Basildon from 1997 until 2010, Lady Smith served as a 
Cabinet Office minister in Gordon Brown’s government. She was made a life 
peeress in 2010 and became leader of the opposition in the House of Lords in 
May 2015. Smith is refusing to back Corbyn as leader; she can’t resign from the 
shadow cabinet but is refusing to attend meetings until he leaves.

Maskell, Cat Smith and Dave Anderson. Composite: PA/Rex/Guardian 
The new shadow cabinet appointments 

Shadow foreign secretary – Emily Thornberry
Thornberry replaces Hilary Benn. She will be expected to scrutinise the 
process of detangling Britain from the EU and any new trade deals with the rest 
of the world.She resigned from the shadow cabinet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/20/emily-thornberry-resigns-rochester-tweet-labour-shadow-cabinet>
 during the 2014 Rochester byelection after tweeting a photograph of a council 
house draped in a flag of St George.

Shadow health secretary – Diane Abbott
A close friend of Corbyn’s for 40 years and the first black woman elected to 
the House of Commons. The MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington has been a 
health minister before, under Ed Miliband, and is seen as a good media 
performer. Her abrasive style has meant that she has quite a few opponents in 
the parliamentary party.

Shadow education secretary – Pat Glass
The MP for North West Durham has a long-term interest in education – she was a 
government adviser on special needs education and was in parliament’s education 
select committee. Just a month ago, while campaigning to stay in the EU, she 
was forced to apologise after suffering her own “Gillian Duffy” moment – she
called a member of the public “a horrible racist” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/labour-europe-minister-apologises-after-calling-voter-a-horrible-racist>
, mistakenly thinking that a microphone had been turned off.

Shadow transport secretary – Andy McDonald
The MP for Middlesbrough was elected in 2012 following the death of Sir Stuart 
Bell and has been the shadow rail minister under Corbyn since January. He 
nominated Andy Burnham to be leader and is respected by the Corbynistas for his 
campaign work.

Shadow defence secretary – Clive Lewis 
The newly elected MP for Norwich South has been at the centre of the Corbyn 
project. A former BBC reporter who served in Afghanistan, many were surprised 
when he was not given this brief during the last reshuffle. Seen as a future 
leadership contender if and when Corbyn steps down.

Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury – Rebecca Long-Bailey
Part of the 2015 intake of Corbyn supporters, the MP for Salford and Eccles 
was selected for the seat following a bitter internal selection process. 
Trained as a solicitor, she has been backed by the union Unite.

Shadow international development secretary – Kate Osamor
MP for Edmonton since May 2015. Previously a GP practice manager and trade 
union activist. She claimed the 2011 riots were the result of “justified” anger 
at racist policing and the police shooting of Mark Duggan as a “clear 
miscarriage of justice”.

Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary – Rachel Maskell
MP for York Central since May 2015. Formerly a care worker and physiotherapist 
as well as a trade union official. During the refugee crisis of September 2015, 
she called on the UK to open its doors to all refugees. A keen cyclist.

Shadow voter engagement and youth affairs – Cat Smith
MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood since 2015. Before entering parliament, she 
worked for Corbyn and as a policy officer for the British Association of Social 
Workers. She was one of the 36 Labour MPs to nominate Corbyn for leader and is 
often seen and heard in the media defending his leadership.

Shadow Northern Ireland secretary – Dave Anderson
The MP for Blaydon since 2005 is a former miner and care worker. He is also a 
former president of Unison and chairs the Labour friends of Iraq group.
