Allardyce revealed on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/25/sunderland-sam-allardyce-manchester-city-preview>
 that he had two players lined up as he attempts to strengthen the squad he 
inherited from Dick Advocaat as quickly as possible when the winter transfer 
window opens. It appears 27-year-old Ivory Coast international Koné could be 
the first.

The Lorient vice-president Alex Hayes said: “We have received an offer that we 
have accepted. It is now up to Lamine to find an agreement withSunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> and to pass the medical 
before the transfer can be made official.”

It is understood Koné, who has been tracked by Allardyce since his time at 
West Ham, flew to England on Tuesday to open talks.
