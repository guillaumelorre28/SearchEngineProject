The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 
Dave Chappelle. I couldn’t believe I was there.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had 
Someone once shouted: “We know you’re acting and this isn’t real” at a gig in 
Cambridge. I was 25, playing a 50-year-old lounge singer called Michael 
Eggwater whose thoughts were playing through the speakers at the venue. Caught 
red-handed.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 
TV-wise, Kristen Wiig playing Liza Minnelli trying to turn a lamp off. She is 
the funniest character actor in the world in my humble opinion. Wiig, not 
Minnelli; actually, Minnelli, why not?

The funniest word 
Toilet.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned 
As a 10-year-old, I got my mum to buy me some canvas platform shoes because I 
really liked the Spice Girls. I was already the tallest boy in my year by a 
foot.

The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten 


People being effusive about incredibly bland food makes me die with laughter. 
I once had to leave a restaurant to get some air because a family friend sent 
his compliments to the chef about a piece of rock cake that tasted like gravel.

The funniest person I know 
Aside from the peers I gig with and make stuff with, I would say Tom Davis is 
my king. The man is a force. I feel like I’m being tickled by a body-builder 
when he’s around.

The funniest book I’ve ever read 
Robert Popper’s The Timewaster Letters are the height for me. Indescribably 
funny.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had 
A very straight fringe, very short sides and a very long back. Hair’s mad!

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard 
I bought a Spider-Man 2 joke book from a charity shop; all the jokes are 
Spider-Man 2-themed. I understand three. Here’s my fave. Q: What paper could 
Peter Parker never work for? A: The Times. I don’t know why it’s a joke. I 
think it’s a fact. If it’s a fact, why can’t he work for the Times?
