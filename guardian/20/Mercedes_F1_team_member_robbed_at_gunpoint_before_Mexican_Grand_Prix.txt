While both the member of the Mercedes team, who was not wearing branded 
apparel, and driver were unhurt in the ordeal, the incident is likely to raise 
security concerns before Sunday’s race. The member of Mercedes staff has chosen 
to stay in Mexico for the race. 

“A team member was robbed while travelling from the airport towards the city 
on Wednesday when in heavy stationary traffic,” a Mercedes spokesperson told 
Press Association Sport. 

“Wallets and watches were taken and there were no physical injuries, but they 
were a little shaken up for obvious reasons.” 

The spokesperson declined to elaborate on whether the team would take further 
safety precautions, and that the Mercedes personnel was unnamed but not of high 
profile. 

In the latest security guidelines issued by the British government, crime and 
violence is recorded as “a serious problem” in Mexico, while visitors are urged 
to “keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights”.

Jenson Button was threatened by gunmen in Sao Paolo before the 2010 Brazilian 
Grand Prix. Button, then the reigning world champion, was returning to his 
hotel following qualifying at the Interlagos circuit when his vehicle was 
approached by at least three men brandishing machine guns. 

Button, who was travelling with his late father John, trainer Mike Collier and 
manager Richard Goddard, managed to flee the scene unharmed in the incident. 

Meanwhile, three Sauber engineers were robbed at gunpoint on the same evening. 
They were also unhurt.
