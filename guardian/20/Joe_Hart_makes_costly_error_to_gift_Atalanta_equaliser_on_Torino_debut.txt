Atalanta secured the three points after Franck Kessie sent Hart the wrong way 
from the penalty spot eight minutes from time, despite the goalkeeper’s best 
attempts to distract the midfielder by walking behind his goal.

The 29-year-old joined Torino on a season-long loan from Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/joe-hart-torino-excited-test-serie-a-transfer-window-manchester-city>
 after being told he would not be the first-choice goalkeeper under Pep 
Guardiola, with the City manager signing Barcelona’s Claudio Bravo to be the 
club’s No1.

Hart had been at City 10 years and won the Premier League in 2012 and 2014. 
“Torino’s offer came at the right moment for me, in the right manner, and I’m 
very excited to test myself in an important and beautiful league such as Serie 
A,” said Hart, after arriving in Italy at the end of last month.

With Guardiola making clear his preference for a ball-playing goalkeeper, 
Willy Caballero was preferred to Hart for the opening three Premier League 
matches of the season. Bravo made his debut in the Manchester derby on Saturday 
andwas also heavily scrutinised following his mistake

 in the buildup to United’s goal in City’s 2-1 win at Old Trafford.

Roma’s Francesco Totti showed he still has what it takes to turn a match 
around, on the verge of his 40th birthday.

Roma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> trailed Sampdoria 2-1 at 
half-time, with the interval lasting more than an hour owing to a downpour at 
the Stadio Olimpico. Totti warmed up alone in the rain before coming on at the 
start of the second half, setting up Edin Dzeko with a pinpoint pass for the 
equaliser, and then converted an injury-time penalty to seal victory.

While he rarely starts these days, Totti has scored five goals and set up 
three more in his past eight games. After calmly beating Emiliano Viviano with 
the 93rd-minute penalty, the Roma legend took his shirt off and ran to 
celebrate under the Curva Sud where the club’s ultras sit.

“I try to do my part and contribute, just like I’ve been doing for 25 years 
around here,” Totti said “For the first time, to be honest, I was a bit afraid 
of missing. But I couldn’t miss under the Curva.”

“If I’m in this form, why quit?” Totti said when asked if this will be his 
final season.

Roma moved level with Napoli, two points behind league leaders Juventus.

In another match affected by heavy rain, Genoa and Fiorentina were locked at 
0-0 when their game was suspended after 28 minutes. The rest of the match will 
be played at a later date.

At the San Siro, Udinese’s Stipe Perica scored late to earn victory over 
Milan, who have taken only three points from three games. It was Milan’s second 
consecutive defeat under new coach Vincenzo Montella.

The Milan castoff Simone Verdi scored as Bologna beat Cagliari 2-1, while 
Alessandro Gamberini and Stefan de Vrij traded second-half goals in a 1-1 draw 
between Verona and Lazio.
