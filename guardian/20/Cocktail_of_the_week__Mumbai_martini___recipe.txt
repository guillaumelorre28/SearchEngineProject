A delicately spiced take on the classic martini that’s deliciously refreshing 
after a long day. Serves one.

10 curry leaves, plus 1 to garnish
2 thin slices fresh ginger (or 1 tsp ginger juice)
50ml vodka (we use Wyborowa <http://www.wybo.com>)
15ml fresh lemon juice
10ml sugar syrup or gomme syrup

Muddle the curry leaves and ginger slices (if using) in a shaker. Add all the 
liquids and a handful of ice cubes, shake vigorously and double strain into a 
frozen martini glass. Garnish with a curry leaf and serve.
