In 2006 the powers-that-be in London renamed the Bradford-based National 
Museum ofPhotography <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography>, 
Film and Television the National Media Museum. I couldn’t believe it and I 
wrote to tell the new director what I thought of the change.

“Don’t worry,” he replied. “We’ll have a chair in photography.”

“A chair!” I said. “We used to have a whole museum.”

“The National Museum of Film, Photography and Television” was, it’s true, a 
bit of a mouthful, but at least everyone knew what was in the building and what 
they could hope to see. What does “media” mean when a museum’s concerned?

No wonder admissions have slumped since the heyday of the 1980s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/06/opposition-grows-to-bradford-photography-collection-move>
 – we don’t know what it’s for.

In 1988 the NMPFT was named museum of the year. That was the year I was lucky 
enough to be its fellow in photography, following in the footsteps ofFay Godwin 
 
<https://imagesonline.bl.uk/?service=page&action=show_page&name=Fay-Godwin&language=en>
andRaghubir Singh <http://www.raghubirsingh.com/home_en.php>, both major 
players in the art. The fellow the year after me wasPaul Graham 
<http://www.paulgrahamarchive.com/>, another star.

The fellowship involved some teaching at the local college and a few workshops 
at weekends, but I was the one who was doing all the learning. The museum, 
originally a theatre, was stuffed to the gills with great old photographs and 
had many hands-on exhibits in the photographic and television studios. It was 
always full of kids and enthusiasts, and they genuinely loved it.

When I made my pitch to Colin Ford, the director at the time, I wanted to 
spend a year at Bradford Football Club, which was then still recovering from the
1985 fire that killed 56 people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/11/families-bradford-city-fire-victims-anniversary-service-football>
. I wanted to show how a real football club worked day in, day out.

It was always full of kids and enthusiasts, and they genuinely loved it

My duties included producing an exhibition at the end of the year, and my 
dream was to put up 50 photographs without a football in any of them.

I already had a connection to the museum. When it opened in 1985, I was asked 
to provide a set of photographs for an installation recreating a national 
newspaper picture desk. Visitors could pick up a phone and hear me talking 
about my work over the years for the Observer as a sports photographer. I was 
in good company, asDon McCullin 
<http://www.hamiltonsgallery.com/artists/29-Don-McCullin/overview/> had the 
desk next to me.

Unfortunately on one visit when I lifted the phone to hear my dreaded Mick 
Jagger London twang, it wasn’t my voice that I heard but that of Don talking 
eloquently about his time covering war and destruction all around the world.

It must have been very confusing for the young visitors – but hey, the 
pictures were great.

The current plan to move the Royal Photographic Society collection south to 
London’s Victoria & Albert Museumhas been described 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/02/bradford-photography-collection-move-vanda-reviled-vandalism>
 as an “act of cultural vandalism” and has strengthened fears that the ultimate 
goal is to close the museum entirely. That would be a tragedy for anybody who 
cares about the arts in the north.

The National Media Museum’s bosses should think again, change the name of the 
museum back to what it was and watch the crowds come rolling back again –just 
like at Bradford City 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3150942/Bradford-City-course-18-000-season-ticket-sales-incredible-response-social-media-campaign.html>
.

Incidentally, when the time came to open the exhibition I couldn’t get hold of 
any of the players I had photographed. They had all been sold.

It’s a tough life being a footballer – or a museum.

1. Hansom Cab in Trafalgar Square, WJ Warren, c1898 – I love the atmosphere in 
this shot, taken with a plate camera on a tripod 120 years ago. I’m not sure we 
could do it any better today.

3. Parian Vase, Grapes and Silver Cup, Roger Fenton, c1860 – Fenton made more 
than 50 still lifes. The silver cup appeared in many and often reflected the 
camera.

4. The Open Door, William Henry Fox Talbot, 1844 – One of the stars of early 
photography, Fox Talbot conducted most of his experiments at Lacock Abbey in 
Wiltshire. This photo, taken in the abbey courtyard, is stunning for 1844.
