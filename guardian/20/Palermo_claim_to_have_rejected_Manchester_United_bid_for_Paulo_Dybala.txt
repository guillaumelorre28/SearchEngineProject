Palermo claim they have rejected interest from Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> in the 21-year-old 
striker Paulo Dybala.

But the Italian club’s president, Maurizio Zamparini, says he is willing to 
talk again in the summer about the Argentinian, who has scored nine goals in 17 
appearances this season.

“Dybala is worth over €40m [£31m] but I won’t sell him until June,” Zamparini 
told Radio Due. “Many foreign clubs asked after him, including Manchester 
United. I told the English side that he is not for sale right now, but we can 
talk about it again in six months. In my view, he is the best striker in Europe 
at the moment.”

Palermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> signed Dybala from the 
Argentinian club Instituto for £9m in 2012. Afterwards Zamparini described him 
as “the new Sergio Agüero”.
