The idea is, I suppose, that tarts are more suited to summer, pies to winter. 
An open topped pastry case is the ideal opportunity to show off slices of 
knobbly, seasonal tomatoes or an OCD arrangement of summer berries. A pie’s 
second layer of pastry will satisfy our winter need for the comfort of golden 
dough. And yet we happily bring out a pork pie at a July picnic or eat an 
open-topped tarte tatin on a wet weekend in February. And as much as I like the 
visual appeal of a tart, it is that extra layer of pastry that gets my vote 
rain or shine.

All of which may explain why, with the sun high in the sky, I found myself 
making a double-crusted rabbit and tarragon pie. It’s a short hop from steak 
and kidney yet the white meat and green herbs planted it firmly in the summer 
eating category. I skirted the rabbit’s tendency to dryness by browning the 
meat then poaching it in stock with shallots and thyme. That stock ended up as 
the heart and soul of the filling, thickened with butter and flour.

This week also saw an apricot pie on the table, made with pastry so soft it 
hugged the shape of the fruit, giving the impression of a cluster of apricot 
dumplings. I included lemon zest in the pastry that brought out the fruit’s 
characteristic shyness. Long live the double crust.

Rabbit, chicken and tarragon pie

If rabbit isn’t your thing, then use chicken instead, making sure a generous 
proportion of it is brown leg and thigh meat. You will need a deep pie dish 
approximately 30x20cm.

Serves 6
For the pastry:
plain flour 200g
lard 50g
butter 50g
egg 1, beaten

For the filling:
olive oil 4 tbsp 
wild rabbit meat 1.2kg, prepared but on the bone
chicken thighs 2, skinned
shallots 200g, small
button mushrooms 150g
carrots 200g, small
thyme 10 sprigs
butter 50g
plain flour 50g
stock 700ml (from cooking the rabbit)
parsley 4 tbsp, chopped
tarragon 2 tbsp, chopped
egg a little, beaten

Make the pastry: put the flour into the bowl of a food processor, add the lard 
and butter, cut into small pieces, then process to coarse crumbs.


Add the egg to the mixture and enough cold water to give a firm but rollable 
dough. Roll into a thick, fat cylinder, wrap in clingfilm and chill for 20 
minutes.

Warm the oil in a large, wide pan over a moderate heat. Add the rabbit and 
chicken pieces, browning on both sides and removing to a large casserole as 
they become ready. Peel the shallots and colour lightly in the oil in which you 
browned the meat, then add the mushrooms, cut in halves or quarters, as you 
think fit. When they are golden, transfer the mushrooms and shallots to the 
rabbit pan, then pour over 2 litres of water and bring to the boil. Peel the 
carrots and halve them lengthways. Add the thyme sprigs and lower the heat. Let 
everything simmer for an hour with the occasional stir, adding the carrots 
halfway through the cooking time.

Remove the chicken and vegetables with a draining ladle and transfer to a deep 
pie dish. Leave the stock simmering while you tear the meat from the bones into 
large pieces.

Melt the butter in a heavy pan, add the flour and cook over a moderate heat, 
stirring, for a couple of minutes. Pour in 700ml of the stock and stir until 
you have a thickish gravy. Add the meat, vegetables and chopped herbs, check 
the seasoning, then tip into a deep-sided baking dish.

Slice the pastry into ½cm thick discs, then lay them, slightly overlapping, 
over the filling. Brush with a little beaten egg and bake for 40 minutes or so, 
until golden.

My favourite pastry is very soft and a little fragile to handle. I get round 
this by kneading the dough, briefly and tenderly, on a lightly floured wooden 
board before rolling.

Serves 6
For the pastry:
butter 150g
golden caster sugar 150g
egg 1
lemon grated zest of 1 small one
plain flour 250g
baking powder 1tsp
milk and sugar a little to finish

For the filling:
apricots 750g, ripe ones
caster sugar 2tbsp
orange grated zest of 1 small one
cornflour 1 heaped tbsp

Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg, then the 
lemon zest. Sift in the flour and baking powder and fold into the butter and 
sugar mixture. Form the dough into a ball and knead lightly on a floured 
surface then cut in half. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an 
hour. Use half of the dough to line a buttered 24cm metal pie plate. Place 
this, and the remaining half, in the fridge.

Set the oven at 180/gas mark 4. Halve the apricots and remove their stones. 
Put the apricots in a bowl, toss with the sugar, orange zest and cornflour, 
then spoon on to the pie lining. Roll the reserved pastry to fit the top. Brush 
the rim of the pastry in the pie plate with milk, then lower on the pastry top. 
Seal the edges, pressing or pinching them together, then brush the pie with 
milk and dust with sugar. Pierce a small hole in the centre to let the steam 
out. Bake for 45 minutes or so until the crust is pale gold. Leave to settle 
for 10-15 minutes before serving.
