Celta Vigo eliminated Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> in the Copa del Rey 
quarter-finals with a 3-2 victory at the Vicente Calderón.

Pablo Hernández scored twice as Celta upset Atlético, who had lost only once 
in their previous 24 games, to reach the semi-final.

Following a goalless draw in the first leg, the Atlético coach, Diego Simeone, 
again left striker Jackson Martínez on the bench with Luciano Vietto partnering 
Antoine Griezmann in attack. Both sides have struggled for goals in recent 
games – Atlético’s 0-0 draw with Sevilla on Sunday cost them the lead in La 
Liga.

Atlético’s Koke struck an early shot just wide and Saúl Ñíguez had an effort 
saved by Ruben Blanco before Celta took a surprise lead with Hernández given 
space to head in a Fabian Orellana cross.

Griezmann slotted home after a Yannick Carrasco shot was parried into his path 
by Blanco but Celta took charge of the match at the start of the second half.

Saúl gave the ball away to John Guidetti who powered home a 25-metre drive and 
Correa struck the crossbar at the other end before Hernández got his second 
with a header from Hugo Mallo’s cross.

Correa finished clinically after a fine run to make it 3-2 but Celta held out, 
despite being pinned back in the closing stages, to reach the semi-final of the 
cup for the first time in 15 years.
