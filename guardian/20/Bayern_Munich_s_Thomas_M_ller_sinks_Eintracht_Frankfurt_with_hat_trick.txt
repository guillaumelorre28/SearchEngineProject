seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Müller’s opening goal on the rebound in the 22nd minute was a bad omen for 
Frankfurt, with the attacking midfielder having scored in 50 previousBundesliga

winning 47 and drawing three.

The Germany international doubled the visitors’ lead when he tapped in a 
Franck Ribéry pass in the 64th minute though Bayern, who booked their spot in 
the Champions League last 16 this week with a win over Roma, never hitting top 
form.

Müller completed his hat-trick three minutes later when he raced clear to beat 
Felix Wiedwald for his sixth goal of the season.

Xherdan Shaqiri then deflected a Sebastian Rode shot into the goal as Bayern 
completed a sixth win in their past seven league games.

The Bavarians are top on 27 points, seven ahead of both second-placed 
Wolfsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach in third, who are in action on Sunday.
