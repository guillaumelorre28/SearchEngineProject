. Pearson took Leicester into the Premier League as champions in 2014 and kept 
the club in the top flight against all odds the following season before being 
sacked.

“We are delighted to welcome Nigel to the club,” said Derby’s chairman, Mel 
Morris. “He is a proven winner, a highly experienced manager who has a track 
record of success in the Championship and has also coached successfully in the
