Gonzalo Castro opened the scoring in the 20th minute, firing from distance 
into the top right corner after the initial effort of Marco Reus was blocked by 
a defender.

With Dortmund wasting a host of chances, Reus finally settled the issue with 
15 minutes remaining, set up by Shinji Kagawa on a counterattack as Hertha were 
threatening a response.

Reus then set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan to round off the scoring in the 83rd 
minute.

Dortmund advanced to their third successive final, while Hertha had been 
bidding to reach their first such showpiece since 1979.

Bayern had defeated Werder Bremen 2-0 at home on Tuesday to reach their 21st 
final.
