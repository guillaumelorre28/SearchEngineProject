Warnock will work alongside Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson, named as 
assistant manager and first-team coach respectively, while the existing staff 
members James Rowberry, Martyn Margetson and Lee Southernwood will continue as 
part of the back-room team.

The former Sheffield United, QPR and Crystal Palace manager was most recently 
in charge at Rotherham, leading the relegation-threatened team to Championship 
safety last season after being appointed on a short-term deal. Cardiff, who are 
currently second-bottom of the Championship, are hoping for a similar outcome.

Warnock was offered a long-term contract by Rotherham in the summer but turned 
it down. Cardiff is his 14th managerial appointment.

Trollope succeeded Russell Slade in the summer but has lasted only 12 matches 
, paying the price for a disappointing start to the campaign. He won only two 
of his 11 Championship games and oversaw defeat in the EFL Cup at the hands of 
his old club, Bristol Rovers.
