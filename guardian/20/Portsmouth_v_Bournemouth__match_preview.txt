Eight years is a long time in football, especially on the south coast. Back in 
2008, Portsmouth were on their way to winning the FA Cup under Harry Redknapp 
whileBournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> were 
eliminated in the second round by Millwall having scraped past non-league 
Barrow in a replay in the first round. The Cherries ended up being relegated 
from League One and survived dropping out of the Football League altogether by 
the skin of their teeth the following season. In 2016, the meeting of two clubs 
separated by 50 miles has seen their traditional roles reversed so it will be 
intriguing to see whether Portsmouth’s Paul Cook can plot a way past Eddie 
Howe’s Premier League side.Ed Aarons
