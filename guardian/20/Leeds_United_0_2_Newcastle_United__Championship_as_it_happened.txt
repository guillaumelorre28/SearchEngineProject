Well, Leeds didn’t play very well but they shouldn’t beat themselves up too 
much about losing to this Newcastle side. That’s eight wins on the spin for 
Rafa Benitez’s men, and they go five points clear at the top of the table. It’d 
be a fair old surprise if they dropped from that position, and you wouldn’t bet 
against them maintaining at least that gap from the rest until May.

90 mins + 3: Mitrovic is down, looks like he’s complaining about some sort of 
abdominal problem. Not sure how that came about, but he doesn’t look overly 
perturbed.

90 mins: Three minutes of added time. Darlow comes out to punch a cross and 
nearly gets himself into an unpleasant difficulty, but just about gets away

88 mins: The game is petering out now, which is a bit of a shame, but an

85 mins: Close to a slight moment of slapstick for Newcastle. A group of 
defenders leave a long ball for each other, forcing Darlow to come out and deal 
with matters, his clearance is charged down by Antonsson but goes wide. At 
least that will give something for notorious perfectionist Benitez to get his 
teeth into after the game.

83 mins: Diame dispossesses Phillips, Newcastle advance down the right flank 
at the sort of leisurely pace you’d expect from a team 2-0 up and cruising, and 
win a corner. Then, Isaac Hayden comes on for Colback.

81 mins: Ach, it’s not breaking for Leeds: Ayling chips a cross into the box, 
it’s slightly too high for Antonsson but then falls to Wood...nearly, just 
going too far away from his outstretched right foot, and it’s eventually 
cleared.

76 mins: Ayling hoiks a big cross into the middle from way out on the right, 
but Darlow comes out confidently and claims, with Wood advancing on him. Good 
keeping from a man who hasn’t been overly-employed thus far today.

73 mins: Some slow and steady build-up down the left for Leeds, eventually a 
cross is delivered to the back stick where Doukara heads towards goal, but it’s 
easily saved.

70 mins: Iffy corner delivery has been an issue this half for Leeds: a few 
minutes ago Roofe plunked a corner far too long and it sailed over everyone, 
and this time he grubbed it to the near-post and a chance is wasted.

68 mins: Ayline booms in a big cross from deep on the right, which Anita in 
the end deals with fairly well by turning it behind for a corner, but it was 
one of those with potential slapstick calamity written all over it.

65 mins: Perez produces a delicious turn in the box to set up a crossing 
chance, but it’s cleared at the near-post by Jansson. The corner is skimmed out 
to Ritchie on the edge of the box, but that effort is blocked before it can 
really penetrate the penalty area.

64 mins: Yeesh, so close for Leeds. Sacko immediately gets involved by 
dispossessing Dummett, then feeds Doukara who waits, waits, waits and 
eventually slides a ball through the Newcastle defence, but it was just too 
heavy for the run of Roofe.

62 mins: Sub for Leeds: Vieira off, and Hadi Sacko comes on. Looks like a 
change of formation too, perhaps something closer to a 4-4-2 with Doukara 
pushed further forwards.

59 mins: Colback gets a booking, and quite rightly so, after scooping the ball 
back with his hands just as O’Kane looked to have the better of him, breaking 
towards the Newcastle goal.

56 mins: Quite possibly. 
Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) 
Genuinely think this Newcastle side, with this manager, would finish in the 
top 10-12 in the Premier League this season.

Shelvey lines up a shot, slips and it nearly turns into a decent pass to 
Ritchie.

54 mins: Despite Leeds playing well, Newcastle are two up and with a lovely 
goal. Some terrific intricate passing between Shelvey, Anita and Perez presents 
a crossing chance, and Gayle is there - in far too much space - on the edge of 
the six yard box to turn the ball home. Lovely stuff.

52 mins: Bit of a coming together between Shelvey and Ayling: the latter went 
in moderately hard on the former, and Shelvey thought about sticking one on his 
opponent, but appeared to change his mind at the very last minute. Wisely, too.

49 mins: Roofe does well to skip around Clark, his first cross is cleared but 
his second drops to O’Kane, who turns beautifully, shoots across goal and 
Darlow has to make a fine save. That was a little like the goal Harry Kane 
scored for England v Germany at the start of the year. Only, well, it didn’t go

This one’s on simmer rather than full-on boil so far, but it’s been most 
enjoyable nonetheless. Newcastle just about ahead, but Leeds got back into it 
in the closing stages of the half, and could quite easily have a penalty for 
their troubles.

43 mins: The corner results in an enormous bundle of players falling over in 
the six yard box - at least six - and eventually another corner. From that, 
Colback stops a cross into the box with his arm, but the ref gives nothing - it 
was hit at him from close range, but he did have his arm up at a weird angle. 
Lucky to get away with that one. Very lucky, in fact.

42 mins: Leeds’s full-backs look like their most dangerous attackers at the 
moment, which might be a little troubling for Monk. Ayling bustles in from the 
right, the ball eventually makes its way over to Taylor on the left, and he 
fizzes in a low cross that’s put behind for a corner.

40 mins: Roofe shoots from the edge of the box but it’s deflected wide. The 
subsequent corner is headed clear, and Leeds continue to be kept very much at 
arms length.

38 mins: Taylor bundles his way into the box from the left, trying to force 
something - anything - for Leeds here. He tumbles with Colback, Anita and 
Ritchie nearby, but despite some rather desperate please from the stands, 
nothing is given.

35 mins: Wood muscles away a defender or two and lays the ball off to Vieira, 
but the shot is flayed high and wide. Frustration emerging in the stands now.

plucks the cross from the air.

Still, when he does come good...

minute-by-minute of Middlesbrough v Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/20/middlesbrough-chelsea-premier-league-live>
 in the shiny division, just started a few minutes ago.
 
Well, Leeds didn’t play very well but they shouldn’t beat themselves up too 
much about losing to this Newcastle side. That’s eight wins on the spin for 
Rafa Benitez’s men, and they go five points clear at the top of the table. It’d 
be a fair old surprise if they dropped from that position, and you wouldn’t bet 
against them maintaining at least that gap from the rest until May.
 
Peeeeeeep peeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 
 
90 mins + 3: Mitrovic is down, looks like he’s complaining about some sort of 
abdominal problem. Not sure how that came about, but he doesn’t look overly 
perturbed.
 
90 mins + 2: Diame lopes forwards and shoots from range, but there’s not much 
oomph behind the shot and Green gathers without much bother.
 
90 mins: Three minutes of added time. Darlow comes out to punch a cross and 
nearly gets himself into an unpleasant difficulty, but just about gets away 
with it.
 
88 mins: The game is petering out now, which is a bit of a shame, but an 
indication of what a thorough - if not spectacular - performance this has been 
from Newcastle.
 
85 mins: Close to a slight moment of slapstick for Newcastle. A group of 
defenders leave a long ball for each other, forcing Darlow to come out and deal 
with matters, his clearance is charged down by Antonsson but goes wide. At 
least that will give something for notorious perfectionist Benitez to get his 
teeth into after the game.
 
83 mins: Diame dispossesses Phillips, Newcastle advance down the right flank 
at the sort of leisurely pace you’d expect from a team 2-0 up and cruising, and 
win a corner. Then, Isaac Hayden comes on for Colback.
 
81 mins: Ach, it’s not breaking for Leeds: Ayling chips a cross into the box, 
it’s slightly too high for Antonsson but then falls to Wood...nearly, just 
going too far away from his outstretched right foot, and it’s eventually 
cleared.
 
79 mins: And for Newcastle, big Aleksandar Mitrovic comes on in place of Gayle.
 
78 mins: Sub for Leeds - Doukara is done, and Marcus Antonsson replaces him. 
 
76 mins: Ayling hoiks a big cross into the middle from way out on the right, 
but Darlow comes out confidently and claims, with Wood advancing on him. Good 
keeping from a man who hasn’t been overly-employed thus far today.
 
75 mins: Quieter few minutes. Now a change for Newcastle, as Gouffran departs 
and Mo Diame enters.
 
73 mins: Some slow and steady build-up down the left for Leeds, eventually a 
cross is delivered to the back stick where Doukara heads towards goal, but it’s 
easily saved.
 
70 mins: Iffy corner delivery has been an issue this half for Leeds: a few 
minutes ago Roofe plunked a corner far too long and it sailed over everyone, 
and this time he grubbed it to the near-post and a chance is wasted.
 
68 mins: Ayline booms in a big cross from deep on the right, which Anita in 
the end deals with fairly well by turning it behind for a corner, but it was 
one of those with potential slapstick calamity written all over it.
 
65 mins: Perez produces a delicious turn in the box to set up a crossing 
chance, but it’s cleared at the near-post by Jansson. The corner is skimmed out 
to Ritchie on the edge of the box, but that effort is blocked before it can 
really penetrate the penalty area.
 
64 mins: Yeesh, so close for Leeds. Sacko immediately gets involved by 
dispossessing Dummett, then feeds Doukara who waits, waits, waits and 
eventually slides a ball through the Newcastle defence, but it was just too 
heavy for the run of Roofe.
 
62 mins: Sub for Leeds: Vieira off, and Hadi Sacko comes on. Looks like a 
change of formation too, perhaps something closer to a 4-4-2 with Doukara 
pushed further forwards.
 
61 mins: Leeds try to exert some pressure, and Ayling trundles in from the 
right, takes a shot but it’s deflected and loops over the bar.
 
59 mins: Colback gets a booking, and quite rightly so, after scooping the ball 
back with his hands just as O’Kane looked to have the better of him, breaking 
towards the Newcastle goal.
 
56 mins: Quite possibly.

Genuinely think this Newcastle side, with this manager, would finish in the 
top 10-12 in the Premier League this season.

Shelvey lines up a shot, slips and it nearly turns into a decent pass to 
Ritchie.
 
54 mins: Despite Leeds playing well, Newcastle are two up and with a lovely 
goal. Some terrific intricate passing between Shelvey, Anita and Perez presents 
a crossing chance, and Gayle is there - in far too much space - on the edge of 
the six yard box to turn the ball home. Lovely stuff.
 
What a delightful goal.

52 mins: Bit of a coming together between Shelvey and Ayling: the latter went 
in moderately hard on the former, and Shelvey thought about sticking one on his 
opponent, but appeared to change his mind at the very last minute. Wisely, too.
 
51 mins: Leeds have certainly started the second half in better style. They’re 
pinning Newcastle back more effectively.
 
49 mins: Roofe does well to skip around Clark, his first cross is cleared but 
his second drops to O’Kane, who turns beautifully, shoots across goal and 
Darlow has to make a fine save. That was a little like the goal Harry Kane 
scored for England v Germany at the start of the year. Only, well, it didn’t go 
in.
 
46 mins: We’re away. 
 
We’re out for the second half. Football!
 
This one’s on simmer rather than full-on boil so far, but it’s been most 
enjoyable nonetheless. Newcastle just about ahead, but Leeds got back into it 
in the closing stages of the half, and could quite easily have a penalty for 
their troubles.
 
Peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: Pontus Jansson - who looks like he should be playing drums for Rancid 
- got booked for protesting against that non-handball, by the way. One minute 
of added time.
 
43 mins: The corner results in an enormous bundle of players falling over in 
the six yard box - at least six - and eventually another corner. From that, 
Colback stops a cross into the box with his arm, but the ref gives nothing - it 
was hit at him from close range, but he did have his arm up at a weird angle. 
Lucky to get away with that one. Very lucky, in fact.
 
42 mins: Leeds’s full-backs look like their most dangerous attackers at the 
moment, which might be a little troubling for Monk. Ayling bustles in from the 
right, the ball eventually makes its way over to Taylor on the left, and he 
fizzes in a low cross that’s put behind for a corner.
 
40 mins: Roofe shoots from the edge of the box but it’s deflected wide. The 
subsequent corner is headed clear, and Leeds continue to be kept very much at 
arms length.
 
38 mins: Taylor bundles his way into the box from the left, trying to force 
something - anything - for Leeds here. He tumbles with Colback, Anita and 
Ritchie nearby, but despite some rather desperate please from the stands, 
nothing is given.
 
37 mins: Shelvey gets a talking to by the referee after going through the back 
of Vieira. Lucky not to get a yellow there.

Meanwhile, today isn’t Rob Green’s worst...

35 mins: Wood muscles away a defender or two and lays the ball off to Vieira, 
but the shot is flayed high and wide. Frustration emerging in the stands now.
 
33 mins: Roofe gets down the right and swings a cross over, but he didn’t 
allow enough time for any of his teammates to get into the box, and Darlow 
plucks the cross from the air.

Still, when he does come good...
 
31 mins: Phillips whips the corner in from the left and a man at the near post 
- could be Jansson, could be Wood - gets a head to it, but Darlow gets down 
well to save.
