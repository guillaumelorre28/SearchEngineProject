Exeter were well worth their draw

Despite the tantalising prospect of a trip to Anfield for the League Two side, 
Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> might be a 
little disappointed that they didn’t win tonight. They were 2-1 up and bossing 
the game when Brad Smith stepped up to rescue his side. It was Tom Nichols who 
opened the scoring for Exeter after nine minutes, with Jerome Sinclair 
restoring parity for Liverpool three minutes later. Lee Holmes restored 
Exeter’s lead, taking advantage from an Adam Bogdan flap to score directly from 
a corner just before half-time, but Smith equalised for Liverpool after 73 
minutes with a goal that came against the run of play. Exeter were excellent 
tonight, but hats off to Liverpool’s youngsters who showed great determination 
to dig in and get the draw.

90+1 min: The fourth official suggests four minutes of added time as Exeter

Alex Nicholls into the box and clear a cross from the left.

88 min: Craig Woodman plays the ball into space down the channels, but there’s 
nobody there to capitalise and get on the ball. There are a lot of very tired 
players out there after a very entertaining game of football.

87 min: “Is it your hamstring? Is it your hamstring?” chorus Exeter’s fans as 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalscorer Brad 
Smith goes down holding his leg. Apparently it’s no more than a touch of cramp, 
as he soon declares himself fit to continue.

83 min: There’s a loud penalty appeal as Ojo goes down in the box under a 
challenge from a defender I must confess I can’t identify, but replays show the 
defender in question won the ball. My first impression was that it should have 
been a penalty, but it was incorrect.

75 min: That was a good finish from the young Australian, who took full 
advantage of Moore-Taylor’s fairly poor effort to clear a cross from Sheyi Ojo 
to return the ball with interest, sending a low volley flashing past Olejnik.
 Liverpool’s Brad Smith celebrates after volleying in the equaliser.

69 min: Indeed, the way this game is going, it’s Exeter who are in charge, 
looking hungrier, fitter and more likely to score next. If they could extend 
their lead, you’d think that would be that.

66 min: Jordan Tillson gets down the left and picks out Lee Holmes, whose 
cross is cut out by Cameron Randall. Moments later, Tillson and Holmes combine 
to get in behind Liverpool’s defence again. On BBC, Danny Murphy points out 
that Tiago Ilori is looking very tired, going through the motions with his 
socks around his ankles. He can’t be the only player on this hugely 
inexperiencedLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> team 
who is far from match fit.

64 min: Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> 
substitution: Aaron Davies on for his fellow Welshman Christian Ribeiro. Like 
David Noble, he too has been struggling with injury but has played well 
tonight. He should have scored two goals.

63 min: Ilori gets a good telling-off but no booking for bringing down Tom 
Nichols on the edge of the penalty area. Nichols gets the ball over the 
defensive wall, but it fails to deep under the bar. A decent effort; close but 
no cigar.

52 min: There are handbags between Jamie Read and Tiago Ilori after an 
on-the-ball tussle on the sideline results in the former slamming the latter 
into the advertising hoardings. Stuart Attwell intervenes, tells both players 
to behave themselves and play quickly resumes.

who does well to palm a Christian Benteke bullet-header over the bar from close

49 min: Penalty shout! Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> look to have an excellent 
claim for a spot-kick turned down when Christian Ribeiro goes down under a 
“challenge” from Kevin Stewart as he sprinted into the Liverpool penalty area 
from the right flank. Replays show he tripped over his feet. Naughty boy for 
appealing so emphatically.

46 min: Liverpool’s players were sent out of their poky dressing room several 
minutes before Exeter’s joined them and in the commentary box, Danny Murphy 
notes that rather than do stretches or sprints in a bid to get ready for the 
second half, they just stood around chatting.

Second half: Exeter City 2-1 Liverpool

Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> get the ball 
rolling for the second half. If they can continue getting in behind Liverpool’s 
full-backs and getting early crosses into the box, they have every chance of 
extending their lead. Liverpool have looked good going forward, but their 
defending has at times looked nothing short of atrocious. They should really be 
3-1 up, as Christian Ribeiro missed a wonderful chance to score with a header 
not long before they went ahead.

Half-time: Exeter City 2-1 Liverpool

Stuart Attwell blows for half-time at the end of a full-blooded, highly 
entertaining 45 minutes of FA Cup final. Exeter City opened the scoring after 
nine minutes through Tom Nichols, prompting a period of dominance from 
Liverpool in which Jerome Sinclair equalised.Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> played their way back into 
the game and tormented their visitors with crosses, eventually scoring through 
one when Lee Holmes scored directly from a corner. He made Adam Bogdan look 
quite the chump in the process.

45+1 min: Oh dear. Adam Bogdan drops the second high profile clanger of his 
few appearances this season, allowing Lee Holmes to score directly from a 
corner. He made a complete dog’s breakfast of that, allow himself to be 
outmuscled and intimidated by Exeter’s strikers as the ball sailed from the 
boot of Lee Holmes out by the touchline and over his head into the back of the 
net.Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> lead 
Liverpool 2-1.
 Adam Bogdan flaps as the ball goes past him from a Lee Holmes’ corner.

40 min: Fantastic play from Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc>, with Lee Holmes getting 
two superb crosses in quick succession into the Liverpool penalty area. Up from 
defence, Christian Ribeiro is on hand to meet the second with a meaty header 
which he sends no more than a foot wide of the left upright with the goal at 
his mercy. Another marvellous opportunity goes a begging.

27 min: Lee Holmes and Craig Woodman combine down the left wing for Exeter and 
win a throw-in. The ball’s worked across the right, from where it’s sent into 
the penalty area and falls nicely for David Noble in the penalty area. He 
blasts over from about 10 yards before halfheartedly appealing for a penalty 
after going down under a challenge from Connor Randall. He should have scored - 
that was a marvellous opportunity.

Despite the tantalising prospect of a trip to Anfield for the League Two side, 
Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> might be a 
little disappointed that they didn’t win tonight. They were 2-1 up and bossing 
the game when Brad Smith stepped up to rescue his side. It was Tom Nichols who 
opened the scoring for Exeter after nine minutes, with Jerome Sinclair 
restoring parity for Liverpool three minutes later. Lee Holmes restored 
Exeter’s lead, taking advantage from an Adam Bogdan flap to score directly from 
a corner just before half-time, but Smith equalised for Liverpool after 73 
minutes with a goal that came against the run of play. Exeter were excellent 
tonight, but hats off to Liverpool’s youngsters who showed great determination 
to dig in and get the draw.

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It’s all over. Despite having led twice, Exeter are 
forced to settle for a draw and the trip to Anfield that comes with it. Having 
showcased some of their potential stars of the future,Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> showed great resilience to 
earn a replay they could really do without.
 
90+3 min: Chirivilla finds himself in possession on the edge of the Exeter 
penalty area, but is unable to find a way through the phalanx of defenders in 
front of him. Exeter hack clear.
 
90+2 min: Exeter win a corner and the delivery is good. In an attempt to get 
his head on the ball, Jordan Moore-Taylor falls over, prompting optimistic 
shouts for a penalty from the home fans.
 
90+1 min: The fourth official suggests four minutes of added time as Exeter 
embark on a counter-attack. Cameron Brannagan does superbly to track the run of 
Alex Nicholls into the box and clear a cross from the left.
 
90 min: We go into the final minute, with the score level. 
 
88 min: Craig Woodman plays the ball into space down the channels, but there’s 
nobody there to capitalise and get on the ball. There are a lot of very tired 
players out there after a very entertaining game of football.
 
87 min: “Is it your hamstring? Is it your hamstring?” chorus Exeter’s fans as 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalscorer Brad 
Smith goes down holding his leg. Apparently it’s no more than a touch of cramp, 
as he soon declares himself fit to continue.
 
85 min: Exeter make a final substitution: Joel Grant on for Lee Holmes, who 
scored the Grecian’s second.
 
83 min: There’s a loud penalty appeal as Ojo goes down in the box under a 
challenge from a defender I must confess I can’t identify, but replays show the 
defender in question won the ball. My first impression was that it should have 
been a penalty, but it was incorrect.
 
81 min: Christian Benteke picks out a Joao Teixeira run into the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area, but Bobby 
Olejnik is quick off his line to get down and save.

80 min: After good build-up play on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area, 
Tom Nichols flashes a wonderful ball across the face of theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goal, but there’s nobody on 
hand to convert.
 
78 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win a 
free-kick near the corner flag. Brad Smith sends the ball into the penalty 
area, but it’s not quite near enough to Christian Benteke for the striker to 
get on the end of it.
 
77 min: Liverpool make their third change, with Joe Maguire coming on for 
Tiago Ilori, who is so exhausted he can hardly walk. With Jurgen Klopp having 
used all three of his substitutions, Lucas and Adam Lallana remain on the bench.
 
75 min: That was a good finish from the young Australian, who took full 
advantage of Moore-Taylor’s fairly poor effort to clear a cross from Sheyi Ojo 
to return the ball with interest, sending a low volley flashing past Olejnik.

72 min: Danny Murphy says what we’re all thinking: “Why did Jurgen Klopp bring 
Adam Lallana and put him on the bench if he had no intention of throwing him on 
in an emregency situation ifLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> were losing?”
 
71 min: Liverpool substitution: Jerome Sinclair off, Sheyi Ojo on for his 
debut. His first contribution as a seniorLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> player is to get on the ball 
and send a wayward cross sailing over the bar and out of play.
 
69 min: Indeed, the way this game is going, it’s Exeter who are in charge, 
looking hungrier, fitter and more likely to score next. If they could extend 
their lead, you’d think that would be that.
 
66 min: Jordan Tillson gets down the left and picks out Lee Holmes, whose 
cross is cut out by Cameron Randall. Moments later, Tillson and Holmes combine 
to get in behind Liverpool’s defence again. On BBC, Danny Murphy points out 
that Tiago Ilori is looking very tired, going through the motions with his 
socks around his ankles. He can’t be the only player on this hugely 
inexperiencedLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> team 
who is far from match fit.

Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images  
64 min: Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> 
substitution: Aaron Davies on for his fellow Welshman Christian Ribeiro. Like 
David Noble, he too has been struggling with injury but has played well 
tonight. He should have scored two goals.
 
63 min: Ilori gets a good telling-off but no booking for bringing down Tom 
Nichols on the edge of the penalty area. Nichols gets the ball over the 
defensive wall, but it fails to deep under the bar. A decent effort; close but 
no cigar.
 
61 min: Exeter Cty substitution: David Noble off after a fine performance, 
38-year-old Matt Oakley on. That’s Matt Oakley who was anFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> runner-up with Southampton in 
2003.

 
60 min: Lee Holmes is unable to emulate his first half heroics, curling his 
corner to the near post, where it’s cleared. There’s less than 30 minutes to go 
andLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> trail 2-1.
 
60 min: Lee Holmes wins another corner for Exeter. 
 
58 min: Christian Ribeiro towers above Connor Randall at the far post to get 
on the end of a marvellous cross from the left. He steers his header wide of 
the upright. Liverpool substitution: Nineteen-year-old debutant Ryan Kent off, 
Pedro Chirivella on for his secondLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> appearance.
 
55 min: Jamie Read picks up a Alex Nicholls pass from deep on the edge of the 
Liverpool penalty area. Turning, he attempts to pick out Tom Nichols, but his 
pass is wayward and a good chance goes to waste. Not for the first time this 
evening,Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> looked in 
all sorts of bother under a high ball.
 
52 min: There are handbags between Jamie Read and Tiago Ilori after an 
on-the-ball tussle on the sideline results in the former slamming the latter 
into the advertising hoardings. Stuart Attwell intervenes, tells both players 
to behave themselves and play quickly resumes.
 
50 min: Fine save from Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik, 
who does well to palm a Christian Benteke bullet-header over the bar from close 
range. Connor Brannagan’s cross from the left flank was sublime.
 
49 min: Penalty shout! Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> look to have an excellent 
claim for a spot-kick turned down when Christian Ribeiro goes down under a 
“challenge” from Kevin Stewart as he sprinted into the Liverpool penalty area 
from the right flank. Replays show he tripped over his feet. Naughty boy for 
appealing so emphatically.
 
47 min: Connor Randall tries to pick out Christian Benteke in the Exeter box, 
but the striker’s flick rolls out of play.
 
46 min: Liverpool’s players were sent out of their poky dressing room several 
minutes before Exeter’s joined them and in the commentary box, Danny Murphy 
notes that rather than do stretches or sprints in a bid to get ready for the 
second half, they just stood around chatting.
 
Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> get the ball 
rolling for the second half. If they can continue getting in behind Liverpool’s 
full-backs and getting early crosses into the box, they have every chance of 
extending their lead. Liverpool have looked good going forward, but their 
defending has at times looked nothing short of atrocious. They should really be 
3-1 up, as Christian Ribeiro missed a wonderful chance to score with a header 
not long before they went ahead.
 
Stuart Attwell blows for half-time at the end of a full-blooded, highly 
entertaining 45 minutes of FA Cup final. Exeter City opened the scoring after 
nine minutes through Tom Nichols, prompting a period of dominance from 
Liverpool in which Jerome Sinclair equalised.Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> played their way back into 
the game and tormented their visitors with crosses, eventually scoring through 
one when Lee Holmes scored directly from a corner. He made Adam Bogdan look 
quite the chump in the process.
 
45+1 min: Oh dear. Adam Bogdan drops the second high profile clanger of his 
few appearances this season, allowing Lee Holmes to score directly from a 
corner. He made a complete dog’s breakfast of that, allow himself to be 
outmuscled and intimidated by Exeter’s strikers as the ball sailed from the 
boot of Lee Holmes out by the touchline and over his head into the back of the 
net.Exeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> lead 
Liverpool 2-1.

45 min: Lee Holmes scores directly from a corner. 
 
44 min: Exeter win a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory and the ball’s 
worked to Ribeiro, who wins a corner as he attempts to cross into theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area.
 
43 min: Exeter win a free-kick wide on the right, almost in line with the edge 
of the penalty area. Again the delivery is good, butLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> clear.
 
40 min: Fantastic play from Exeter City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc>, with Lee Holmes getting 
two superb crosses in quick succession into the Liverpool penalty area. Up from 
defence, Christian Ribeiro is on hand to meet the second with a meaty header 
which he sends no more than a foot wide of the left upright with the goal at 
his mercy. Another marvellous opportunity goes a begging.

39 min: From about 30 yards out, Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> midfielder Kevin Stewart runs 
on to the ball and unleashes a low drive that takes a deflection en route to 
goal. In the Exeter goal, Bobby Olejnik gets down to his right to save.
 
38 min: Liverpool win a free-kick just inside their own half, which Jose 
Enrique lofts towards the edge of the penalty area for Christian Benteke to 
attack in the air. The Belgian wins the header, but can’t control it and Exeter 
clear.
 
36 min: Lee Holmes tries to send a cross into the penalty area from the left, 
but his effort is put out for a corner. Christian Benteke is on hand to head 
the ball clear when it’s curled into the penalty area.
 
34 min: Brannagan plays the ball up to the corner flag for Jerome Sinclair to 
chase, but theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
goalscorer is immediately surrounded by defenders and loses possession, 
allowing Exeter to clear their lines.
 
33 min: Another Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
corner and again, Exeter clear.
 
32 min: Liverpool corner, which Cameron Brannagan swings into the penalty 
area. Christian Riberio rises to clear.
 
27 min: Lee Holmes and Craig Woodman combine down the left wing for Exeter and 
win a throw-in. The ball’s worked across the right, from where it’s sent into 
the penalty area and falls nicely for David Noble in the penalty area. He 
blasts over from about 10 yards before halfheartedly appealing for a penalty 
after going down under a challenge from Connor Randall. He should have scored - 
that was a marvellous opportunity.

down the right by Read. Nothing comes of it andLiverpool
