Deep in Bolivia’s Madidi national park, Kamilla Seidler – the head chef of the 
Gustu <http://www.gustubo.restaurantgustu.com/> restaurant in La Paz – was 
looking at a basket ofcusí, the fruit of the babassu palm. An oil processed 
from the seeds is already marketed as a hair and skin product, but Seidler 
suspected it could have culinary potential, too.


“Bring me three kilos of it and in a month I can tell you all kinds of things 
you can do with it,” she told Agustina Aponte, who was representing a group of 
women from Yaguarú, one of 31 campesino and indigenous communities living 
within Madidi’s 1.89m hectares.

While the Bolivian government is pushing to open its protected areas to oil 
and gas firms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2015/jun/05/bolivia-national-parks-oil-gas>
, the women had come to participate in an initiative to exploit the park’s 
natural resources in a more sustainable – and appetizing – way.

Chefs from across Latin America, scientists from the Wildlife Conservation 
Society, and staff from Bolivia’s environment ministry and the Danish 
International Development Agency had also travelled to the park to discuss 
sustainable rainforest products.

 The meeting was intended to prove that there is demand among leading chefs 
for forest produce such as wild cacao ororeja de mono mushrooms – but also to 
help native communities understand just how much commercial potential there is 
in the flora and fauna they come across on a daily basis.

“The first thing we have to do is document the biodiversity. To understand 
what is there,” said Rob Wallace, of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), 
who has been exploring the protected area for the past 17 years.


Wallace and his team have catalogued more plant and animal species in Madidi 
than any other national park in the world, identifying those that are edible 
with the help of native guides.

Out of the forest came camu camu (a cherry-sized fruit with 30 times the 
vitamin C of an orange) andmajo (another palm fruit that can be pressed to 
produce a milk, which could offer an alternative for the lactose intolerant). 
There was rare wild cacao and the honey from stingless bees. Some arrived in 
carefully labelled boxes, others in old Coca-Cola bottles.

“In our experience, it’s difficult to connect with the product,” Seidler told 
the indigenous women. “There’s a market, but we need the connection. Together 
we can work on the quality.”


The Peruvian chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino, part of a Rainforest to Table 
<http://rainforesttotable.com/> organization that includes Seidler, spoke about 
ají negro, a spicy yuca reduction that he encountered in Pucaurquillo, a 
Bora-Huitoto village in the Peruvian Amazon.

In 2015, his Lima restaurants and kitchens of two Amazon river cruise ships 
<http://www.aquaexpeditions.com/> he runs purchased 40,000 Peruvian soles of 
it, completely changing the economy of the village while giving value to their 
culture. There is hope that a similar model could work in Madidi too.

The expedition was spearheaded by the team behind Gustu, the La Paz restaurant 
launched in 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/noma-cofounder-new-scheme-bolivia>
 by Claus Meyer, the Danish co-founder ofNoma <http://noma.dk/>, three times 
voted the best restaurant in the world.

Since then, Meyer’s Melting Pot organization has grown into an engine for 
sustainable culinary development, helping opena dozen small cafeterias and 
cooking schools <http://meltingpot-bolivia.org/manqa/> in impoverished 
neighbourhoods and creating a logistics network to connect artisanal producers 
with chefs and consumers.


Yet connecting with Bolivia’s isolated and undeveloped Amazonian regions, 
which make up nearly half of the country’s territory, has been a challenge. In 
urban centres such as La Paz and Santa Cruz, few know native fruits such as 
açaí or that the world’s largest production of castañas, aka Brazil nuts, is 
actually inBolivia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia>.

When Seidler first arrived in Bolivia from her native Denmark in 2012, she 
went to dinner at the home of Kenzo Hirose, one of the restaurant’s chefs, who 
comes from a jungle village on the Rio Beni. She encountered fruits and fish 
she had never seen. “[But] where are these products in the markets of La Paz?” 
she asked.

The visitors’ most significant achievement has been establishing a 
relationship with a group of Tacana hunters who harvest caimans for three weeks 
each year according to quotas based on population surveys managed by the WCS. 
The skins are sold to Gucci, and the tail meat is sold to Gustu. Despite 
growing demand, bureaucracy has kept other hunters from coming forward, 
requiring a six-day journey to La Paz for permission, and more restaurants from 
obtaining licenses to sell the meat.


“Formalization and consistency can often make bringing products to a market 
impossible,” Jacob Olander, who managesCanopy Bridge <http://canopybridge.com/>
, a global network that connects suppliers and buyers of wild-harvested 
products, told the group. “Restaurants can offer to be an interesting 
intermediary.”


Near the end of the trip, Seidler mentioned that for years she had heard tales 
of a wild vanilla from Madidi, but had never seen it. “Everyone keeps telling 
me it’s as big as a banana,” she said.

The next day a guide from Chalalan found three pods growing near the lodge. 
They were as big as bananas.
