The funniest standup I’ve ever seen



This bloke called Ivan The Comedy <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> 
Referee back when I started in 503 BC. Completely baffled the audience, made me 
cry laughing… mostly at how baffled we all were.

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen



Billy Connolly as the Ayatollah on Not The Nine O’Clock News.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had



Purple backcomb. I tried so hard to be a goth. The purple dye didn’t really 
work on my black hair. I looked like a plum.

The funniest person I know



My son. When he was eight, someone – not me, definitely not me – called him a 
“smart arse”. In a heartbeat he replied: “Your arse is smarter. Yours can TALK!”

The funniest book I’ve ever read



I’ll go with High Fidelity by Nick Hornby.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen



Still Fawlty Towers. I get to enjoy my children enjoying it now. They roll 
around the sofa crying with laughter.

The funniest dream I’ve ever had



That Donald Trump got a lead role in Hamilton.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen



Stir Crazy.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had



“May we borrow your womb?” You had to be there.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned



I recently bought a donkey costume. Haven’t worn it yet; waiting for a special 
occasion.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny



When people write “escaped goat” instead of “scapegoat”.

The funniest number



1889, the year Chaplin was born.

The funniest word



Haberdasher.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard



Why doesn’t Elton John like iceberg lettuce? Cos he’s a Rocket Man.
