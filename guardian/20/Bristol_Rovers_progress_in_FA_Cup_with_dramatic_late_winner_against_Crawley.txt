John-Joe O'Toole hit a dramatic stoppage-time winner as League Two Bristol 
Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers> came from behind to 
clinch an FA Cup third-round tie at Birmingham City with a 2-1 win at Crawley.

O'Toole edged his side through in the first minute of added time with a low 
shot at the near post.

Crawley started well and went ahead on 14 minutes when Nicky Adams crossed 
perfectly and Jamie Proctor headed in at the far post, before Elliot Richards 
equalised with seven minutes to go.
