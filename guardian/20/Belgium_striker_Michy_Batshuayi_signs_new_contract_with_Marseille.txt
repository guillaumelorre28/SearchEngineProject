The 22-year-old has committed his future to Marseille until 2020, the club 
said on their official website. TheMarseille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> defender Benjamin Mendy has 
also signed a contract extension until 2019.

It is understood that Tottenham, Newcastle and Palace all expressed an 
interest in signing Batshuayi, who moved to France from the Belgian side 
Standard Liège in August 2014.

However, with the Brussels-born player keen to cement his place in the Red 
Devils’ national side before this summer’s European Championship finals in 
France, he has been persuaded to remain with Marseilles.

However, Batshuayi, who has scored 11 goals in Ligue 1 so far this season, is 
likely to be a target for English clubs in the summer.
