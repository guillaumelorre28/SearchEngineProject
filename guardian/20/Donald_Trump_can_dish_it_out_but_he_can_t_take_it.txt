“The cast of Hamilton was rude to a very good man” tweeted Donald Trump after 
the cast of said show asked the US president-elect’s running-mate Mike Pence, 
who was sitting in the audience, to “uphold our American values” (Broadside 
against Broadway: Trump attacks ‘overrated’ Hamilton cast for voicing fears 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/20/hamilton-donald-trump-mike-pence>
, 21 November). The fatuous Trump insisted it was “insulting” of Hamilton’s 
cast “to treat our great future VP to a theatre lecture”.

What this incident shows is that Trump is like every bully that has ever 
thrown his weight around a playground – he can dish it out but he can’t take 
it. Trump’s whole campaign was offensive, bad-mannered and disrespectful – 
especially toward Muslims, Mexicans and black people, whom he abused in the 
most disgusting terms. He can expect people to respond in kind.

If Trump thinks the mild rebuke Pence received was “insulting” he will find 
the next four years an eye-opener. Trump and the nest of bigots he is 
assembling into an administration may well have power but they will never have 
respect.

• Hamilton: An American Musical taps in to the US psyche. It tells the story 
of how founding father Alexander Hamilton forged America’s identity through the 
free market. How appropriate that the next US vice-president,Mike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, should want to see it before 
taking office.

“Will you protect diverse America?” pleaded the cast. They may have a point. 
At best, Pence has not supported LGBT rights, and he has actively opposed equal 
marriage. YetHamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton> was gay. His 
love affair with John Laurens under other – less homophobic – circumstances 
would be one of the great love stories of all time. It is likely that 
Hamilton’s decision to die in his duel with Aaron Burr was because he was 
heartbroken. Let’s hope Pence heeds the concerns of the show’s cast, but also 
becomes enlightened by the play’s unstated message. Denying LGBT people full 
equality demeans us all.

• If the Queen could cope with Nicolae Ceaușescu, she’ll be able to cope with 
a visit from Donald Trump (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/20/nigel-farage-invitation-donald-trump-inauguration>
, 21 November). There’s that upper-class English way of smiling and sneering, 
ever so slightly, at the same time.
