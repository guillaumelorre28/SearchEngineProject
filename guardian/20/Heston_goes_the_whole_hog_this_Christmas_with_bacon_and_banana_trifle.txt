Supermarkets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets> are opening a 
new front in the fight for consumers’ Christmas cash, deploying their top chefs 
to cook up eye-catching twists on festive British classics.

Waitrose <https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose> will on Monday unveil 
the latest gastronomic gamble from Heston Blumenthal – a bacon and banana 
flavoured trifle, which it hopes will build on the success of the 
Michelin-starred chef’s best-selling“hidden orange” Christmas pudding

combinations – with creations such assnail porridge

 served at hisFat Duck  <http://www.thefatduck.co.uk/>restaurant – says he was 
inspired for his latest pudding by childhood memories of enjoying a bacon and 
banana sandwich during the school holidays.


“I loved how you wouldn’t normally think of putting those two flavours 
together but they just worked so well,” he said.

“I can’t wait to hear about people’s reactions when they see and taste this 
fantastic dessert at theirChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> dinner table – it’ll 
definitely be a talking point.”


Heston’s new trifle includes a caramelised banana compote topped with 
rum-soaked chocolate sponge, a layer of salted caramel sauce, chocolate 
shavings, a creamy vanilla custard with a smoky bacon flavoured cream – all 
topped with sprinkles of gold cocoa nibs. The trifle also comes with a handy 
sachet of bacon pieces for customers to add themselves.

Supermarkets have been pushing the boundaries to produce Christmas desserts 
and puddings to satisfy consumers of all ages, tastes and budgets, with growing 
pressure to create the season’s “must have” product.

“From Heston’s Middle Eastern Persian pudding, molten hidden centres and 
mature puds, to edible gold lustres and bejewelled fruit and nut decorations, 
bling is in.”

Marks & Spencer has already triumphed in seasonal taste tests. Its Belgian 
Chocolate and Orange Star Christmas Pudding, costing £12, was recently crowned
the best of the Christmas pudding bunch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/19/budget-bubbly-and-mince-pies-triumph-in-christmas-taste-test>
 inGood Housekeeping’s Christmas tasting.

Also highly rated in the same poll were Iceland’s Luxury 12-month Matured 
Christmas Pudding and Morrisons’ Jewelled Top Christmas Pudding.

Behind the scenes, Iceland executive chef Neil Nugent has been transforming 
the store’s frozen food range (and fusty image) into an award-winning offering 
with highly affordable quality Christmas foods, while ITV chef James Martin is 
an adviser to Asda.


The new Heston trifle will launch in Waitrose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose> shops this week as part of a 
meal deal – where it will be available in packs of mini trifles costing £3.99 – 
to allow customers to try ahead of the launch of the larger £12.99 Christmas 
offering.

Not all Blumenthal’s Christmas products have cleared supermarket shelves. In 
2011, Waitrose launched his new range of pine sugar-flavouredmince pies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/12/christmas-early-heston-blumenthal>
, which the chef declared were “delicious eaten warm from the oven and then 
sprinkled with pine sugar for a Christmas tree aroma”.

Consumers were not so sure, however, with huge quantities discounted after 
Christmas.
