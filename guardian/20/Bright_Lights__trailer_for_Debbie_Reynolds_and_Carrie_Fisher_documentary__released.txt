The mother-daughter duo died within a day of each other last week, and HBO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/hbo> has now brought the premiere date for 
the documentary forward. It originally premiered at the 2016 Cannes film 
festival.

It focuses on the close bond between the pair, who lived as neighbors in 
Hollywood, and their struggles with depression, finance and age. It received 
positive reviews on the festival circuit, with the Hollywood Reporter’s David 
Rooney praising its “bittersweet pleasure

she’s such an amazing character,” Fishersaid

Fisher died of a heart attack on 27 December and Reynolds died of a stroke on 
28 December. The pair will be remembered at a joint private memorial this week.

The film will premiere on HBO on 7 January.
