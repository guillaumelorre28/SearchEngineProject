The MediaGuardian morning briefing aims to keep its subscribers up to date 
with the most important media news, but we’re hoping to offer a little bit 
more. From now on, we won’t be just giving you the headlines - we’ll be 
highlighting what some of the biggest stories mean for the industry, as well as 
collecting coverage from around the web that you’ll want to read.

We hope you’ll find these new emails even more useful and interesting - and 
we’ll be regularly asking for feedback about how to improve them.
