Full-time: Inter 1-0 Southampton

That could barely have gone worse for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. For so long a famous 
victory looked there for the taking but instead they leave the San Siro with 
nothing but a slightly sickening feeling. Inter may not be the force they one 
were but they still handed out a painful lesson, punishing Saints for errant 
finishing and a moment of slack defending. The group is anyone’s now.

90+4 min: After tricky work by Boufal, Van Dijk tries to get off a shot at the 
edge of the area. It bounces off a defender to Ward-Prowse, who tries a 
scissors volley from the edge of the box. It goes agonisingly wide.

90+3 min: Van Dijk cops a belt in the face as he jumps for a ball. As he’s on 
the ground he kicks out Beckham-style at the offender and is mighty lucky that 
he doesn’t make contact.

89 min: What a save by Handanovic! From a corner Austin challenged for the 
ball and then it bounced down right in front of him, just four yards from goal. 
He tried to poke it into the net but the keeper threw himself at it and made a 
brilliant reflex save!

82 min: Another perfect delivery by Ward-Prowse, who drops a freekick from the 
left on to the foot of VAn Dijk, who’s eight yards out, right in front of goal 
and unattended by any defenders! And he shoots straight at Handanovic, who 
saves with his feet. That a terrible miss by a fabulous player, to add to the 
one he perpetrated against Hapoel Beer Sheva. Baffling really.

Southampton substitution: Davis on, Rodriguez off. Positive change, that. 
Rodriguez looked jaded and Davis can provide some creative savviness.

RED CARD

Brozovic makes a ludicrous tackle for a player on a yellow card, sliding 
through the back of Hojberg to win the ball in midfield. The ref issues the 
inevitable second yellow and off trudges the offender. Now, canSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> take advantage?

GOAL! Inter 1-0 Southampton (Candreva 67)

Well, that was impeccable timing! Santon cut a cross back from the left and 
Candreva drifted into the box unnoticed by anyone in stripes, including Van 
Dijk. He swept the ball first-time into the net and wheeled off in celebration! 
They’ve landed that sucker punch we warned about. That’s the first goal from 
open play that Saints have conceded in eight matches.

60 min: Brozovic booked for a spiteful late tackle on Austin. He could easily 
have avoided the player as he slid in but lifted his leg to make sure he caught 
him.

58 min: Fine pass by Gnoukouri to reward a clever run by Icardi. But Yoshida 
makes an equally fine block to spare Forster from having to make his first save 
of the night.

57 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are 
bossing this. They’ll be dismayed if they don’t win. Even more so if they’re 
done by a sucker punch, which is all Inter took capable of. These one-time 
giants really playing like tiddlers.

47 min: Cute ball down the left by McQueen. Long sped on to it before going 
down under a tackle by Miranda. And the bad news is that Long seems to have 
suffered a hamstring injury. On comes Austin in his place. That, at least, 
should improve Saints’ finishing.

Half-time: Inter 0-0 Southampton

My guess is Puel won’t be full of cheer during the break. He’ll know his team 
should be in front. They were in charge for most of that half and created 
several clear chances, especially through Martins and Tadic down the right, but 
they have failed to finish. Austin will be introduced soon, I’ll wager. Maybe 
the lesser-spotted Boufal, too.

36 min: Two defenders converge on the dancing Tadic and shove him to the 
ground right in front of the linesman. Throw-in, reckons the linesman. Was his 
view obscured by the fresh air?

33 min: Inter get a sniff on the counter. But Eder has to wait for support 
and, when it eventually arrives, his cross is cut out by Yoshida.

down the right, cracks one wide from just inside the box.

29 min: Another chance missed by Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. This time it was 
Ward-Prowse, who leaned back and lifted a shot over from 18 yards after being 
teed up by Martina. Finishing has been a problem for Saints all season - long 
than that, in fact - and it would be a shame if it cost them tonight. Because 
in all other respects they are much better than this Inter shower.

28 min: Martina hoofs the ball forward following an Inter attack. Rodriguez 
collects it and bounds forward. McQueen provides support on the left. Rodriguez 
gives and goes. McQueen charges forward and then pings in a good cross. 
Handanovic gets a touch to it and deflects it on to the face of Rodriguez, who 
had slid in to try to get a touch with his feet. The ball bounces of the 
Saints’ player’s head and towards the goal! But it’s cleared off the line.
 Jay Rodriguez’s shot is saved by Samir Handanovic of Inter Milan. Photograph:

23 min: Ward-Prowse curls in a wonderful freekick but, inexplicably, none of 
his team-mates saw it coming. If someone had mad an appropriate move to meet 
it, a goal was there for the taking. Only Charlie Austin has those instincts,

22 min: More polished play by Southampton. A patient, progressive move 
culminates with Tadic throwing some shapes on the right and then chipping a 
dangerous cross to the back post. Inter defend well. ButSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> will be back - they’ve been 
significantly better than the hot so far.

19 min: Hojbjerg relieves Candreva of possession in midfield and strides 
forward. He plays the ball wide to Martins, who clips a nice cross over to the 
back post. Long jumps high, as usual, and heads into the keeper’s arms. But 
there’d have been no goal even if the ball had found the net because the ref 
spotted a push by Long.

17 min: A promising Saints move fizzles out when Hojbjerg plays a stray pass. 
That’s not like him. That’s several times now, though, that Saints have got 
into good positions but failed to see the move through.

14 min: Southampton have been the better side so far: more coherent, bolder 
and even more determined. “As a Portsmouth fan whose first love affair with a 
foreign team was the Inter Milan of the mid-2000s - Adriano in his prime, 
Javier Zanetti, Vieri, Cambiasso, Toldo, and the rest - there’s no prizes for 
guessing who I’m backing tonight,” confesses Matt Loten. “Unfortunately, even 
having made a raft of changes, I can see aSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> victory on the horizon. What 
on earth happened to the glorious Inter side that dominated Serie A and, 
briefly, Europe under Jose Mourinho? Rafa made a convenient scapegoat, but to 
move on Sneijder, Milito, Eto’o, Chivu and Maicon and replace them all with 
pale imitations was a rebuilding effort of spectacular inadequacy.”

11 min: After a foul on Romeu, the lion of Southampton’s midfield, Tadic tries 
to score with a freekick from 30 yards at the San Siro. That’s taking fantasy 
too far, and his shot didn’t even make it past the wall.

8 min: Aie! A heavy touch by Rodriguez kills a great chance for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. The ball broke to the 
forward and he ran into the left-hand side of the box and had the option of 
centring for Tadic or sidestepping the last defender and shooting. But one 
hefty touch gave the defender an opportunity to intervene and that’s what he 
did. Rodriguez, let’s remember, is still trying to regain his sharpness after a 
harrowing run of injuries.

7 min: Hojbjerg does brilliantly to win possession in midfield and then fizzes 
a pass down the right to Tadic, who rolls Murillo and starts scampering towards 
the box ... until the ref pulls him back for fouling Murilla.

4 min: Trouble afoot for Southampton! There really shouldn’t have been, but 
Martina didn’t look before playing a back pass from the right-back area and 
offered a chance for Icardi. The striker beat Forster to the ball but the 
goalkeeper stayed on his feet and forced the striker out of play. A reprieve 
for Martina.

2 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have 
started in the way Puel has introduced, dominating possession but not just for 
the hell of it: they’re a-probin’ with pace. And their fans are having a loud 
party. It seems like there’s only one team at the San Siro in these very early 
stages.

The teams come together for an anti-racism promotional photo and an 
opportunity, perhaps, for the Inter players to ask Virgil Van Dijk and Shane 
Long for autographs.

Here they come, Inter and Southampton march out together at the San Siro. The 
stadium, admittedly, looks less than a half-full but you can sure hear the 
travelling fans, who are crooning joyfully about the Saints going marching in. 
The Nerrazzuri are in their classic black and blue gear, whileSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are in their almost as 
classic red and white stripes but with red shorts.

Teams

Inter: Handanovic; Nagayomo, Miranda, Murillo, Santon; Gnoukouri, Medel, 
Brozovic; Candreva, Icardi, Eder

Subs: Carrizo, Palacio, Ansaldi Banega, D’ambrosio, Perisic, Yao

Southampton: Forster; Martina, Yoshida, Van Dijk, McQueen; Romeu, Ward-Prowse, 
Hojbjerg; Rodriguez, Long, Tadic

Subs: McCarthy, Clasie, Fonte, Davis, Austin, Boufal, Stephens

Referee: G Mazelka (Lithuania)

So Puel has churned again: he’s made five changes to the lineup that 
overwhelmed Burnley on Sunday. Charlie Austin drops to the bench despite 
scoring seven goals in his last six matches but Shane Long is a fine man for 
the counter-attack so the omission of Jose Fonte from central defence is a more 
dicey call, with Maya Yoshida being the replacement. For smiles, look at 
left-back: Sam McQueen, who came on as a sub against Burnley after the injury 
to Matt Targett, gets his first senior start – at the San Siro, if you please! 
Equally heartening, Sofiane Boufal is on the bench so Saints fans may finally 
get a look at their £16m summer signing from Lille. As for Inter, Icardi starts 
- who knows what the locals will make of that?

Preamble

Hello and welcome to the rest of your lives or, to be precise, an event that 
Southampton fans will be talking about forever more no matter how many times 
you ask them to pipe down. Quite right, too. This time six years ago 
Southampton were picking themselves up from a 2-0 League One defeat to 
Huddersfield Town while Inter were still high on winning Serie A and the 
Champions League. Now the clubs meet as equals. In fact, Southampton could even 
claim to be superior, as they are top ofEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> Group K with four 
points from two matches while Inter are bottom with nothing to their name but, 
well, a name. But what a name.

Internazionale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale>, one of 
the most prestigious clubs on the planet, 18 times champions of Italy, three 
times champions of Europe and hallowed canvass of men who have enriched 
sporting history, from managers such as Helenio Herrera, Giovanni Trappatoni 
and - drum roll please - Roy Hodgson to players such as Giacinto Fachetti, 
Lothar Matthaus and Luis Suarez (the Spanish genius rather than the Uruguayan 
one). Southampton’s trophy cabinet, by contrast, contains one FA Cup, one 
Johnston’s Paint Trophy and a well thumbed programme from the 1992 Zenith Data 
Systems jamboree. OK, so they’ve duelled with a couple of European heavyweights 
before – notably when they lost narrowly to a Hamburg side that was in the 
fading stages of Ernst Happel’s reign – but this match, against this club in 
this venue, feels bigger than anything the club has ever experienced on the 
international stage. Word is that around 7,000 Saints fans have headed to San 
Siro where at this very moment they are quivering with the giddy glee of 
stoners at Woodstock. This will go down in history.

And who’s to say it won’t go down as a famous Saints win? Inter are struggling 
under Frank de Boer while Southampton have found a nice groove under Claude 
Puel, who can point to an encouraging precedent: ten years agohis Lille team 
beat AC Milan 2-0 to become the first French side to win at the San Siro 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF3DAt4yPHg>. Puel’s got Southampton playing 
attractively and effectively, with muscle, sharpness and unpredictable passing 
patterns. He has chopped and changed his team successfully but must surely 
start his strongest available lineup here, which, alas, will not include his 
first-choice full-backs because of injuries. We’ll bring you news of the team 
selections as soon as we get it. If Inter start with Mauro Icardi, that’ll add 
extra spice to the atmosphere, though let’s hopeall stupidity is kept in check 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga>
. Tonight,as Debbie Harry once implored 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tko1G6XRiQ>, make it magnificent.

Southampton take fight to 10-man Inter but Antonio Candreva strike earns spoils
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/internazionale-southampton-europa-league-group-k-match-report> 
That could barely have gone worse for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. For so long a famous 
victory looked there for the taking but instead they leave the San Siro with 
nothing but a slightly sickening feeling. Inter may not be the force they one 
were but they still handed out a painful lesson, punishing Saints for errant 
finishing and a moment of slack defending. The group is anyone’s now.
 
90+4 min: After tricky work by Boufal, Van Dijk tries to get off a shot at the 
edge of the area. It bounces off a defender to Ward-Prowse, who tries a 
scissors volley from the edge of the box. It goes agonisingly wide.
 
90+3 min: Van Dijk cops a belt in the face as he jumps for a ball. As he’s on 
the ground he kicks out Beckham-style at the offender and is mighty lucky that 
he doesn’t make contact.
 
90+2 min: Inter are piling sandbags around their box as Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> pour forward ...
 
90 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> will 
have at least five more minutes to equalise.
 
89 min: What a save by Handanovic! From a corner Austin challenged for the 
ball and then it bounced down right in front of him, just four yards from goal. 
He tried to poke it into the net but the keeper threw himself at it and made a 
brilliant reflex save!

McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock  
88 min: Corner for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> after a long-range shot by 
Romeu is deflected wide. Ward-Prowse delivers with customary precision, and Van 
Dijk’s downward header is cleared off the line for another corner.
 
Inter substitution: Perisic on, Eder off. 
 
85 min: Hojbjerg booked for a dumb foul as he tried to make up for letting the 
ball run away from him.
 
82 min: Another perfect delivery by Ward-Prowse, who drops a freekick from the 
left on to the foot of VAn Dijk, who’s eight yards out, right in front of goal 
and unattended by any defenders! And he shoots straight at Handanovic, who 
saves with his feet. That a terrible miss by a fabulous player, to add to the 
one he perpetrated against Hapoel Beer Sheva. Baffling really.

Inter substitution: Ansaldi on, Candreva off. 
 
Southampton substitution: Davis on, Rodriguez off. Positive change, that. 
Rodriguez looked jaded and Davis can provide some creative savviness.
 
Brozovic makes a ludicrous tackle for a player on a yellow card, sliding 
through the back of Hojberg to win the ball in midfield. The ref issues the 
inevitable second yellow and off trudges the offender. Now, canSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> take advantage?

76 min: Boufal is playing mainly off the left at the moment, in case you’re 
wondering.
 
Southampton substitution: Tadic off, Boufal on for his first appearance. Can 
he introduce himself with style?
 
73 min: A bewitching turn by Icardi takes out Van Dijk. The striker tries to 
cap that with a goal but his shot is deflected wide.
 
72 min: Candreva swings an inviting cross into the Southampton box from the 
right. It’s fractionally too long for Icardi.Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> needed to take back the 
initiative here.
 
70 min: The mood among the few home fans has improved and Inter are playing 
with a tad more zest.Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>, not so much. McQueen 
concedes a corner with a stay back-header. Fortunately for him, the corner 
yields nothing.
 
Well, that was impeccable timing! Santon cut a cross back from the left and 
Candreva drifted into the box unnoticed by anyone in stripes, including Van 
Dijk. He swept the ball first-time into the net and wheeled off in celebration! 
They’ve landed that sucker punch we warned about. That’s the first goal from 
open play that Saints have conceded in eight matches.

Cacace/AFP/Getty Images  
66 min: Virgil Van Dijk is a marvel. Nearly everything he does is pure class. 
What a feat it was bySouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> to replace Toby Alderweireld 
so seamlessly. And what folly by other clubs not to pay attention to Scottish 
football.
 
63 min: The game is going through a scruffy spell, which suits Inter. 
 
60 min: Brozovic booked for a spiteful late tackle on Austin. He could easily 
have avoided the player as he slid in but lifted his leg to make sure he caught 
him.
 
58 min: Fine pass by Gnoukouri to reward a clever run by Icardi. But Yoshida 
makes an equally fine block to spare Forster from having to make his first save 
of the night.
 
57 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are 
bossing this. They’ll be dismayed if they don’t win. Even more so if they’re 
done by a sucker punch, which is all Inter took capable of. These one-time 
giants really playing like tiddlers.
 
55 min: Rodriguez pounces on a breaking ball and plays it first time through 
to Austin, who lets fly from 20 yards. Inches wide!
 Charlie Austin fires just wide. Photograph: Kieran 
McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock  
53 min: Icardi does nothing to endear himself to the home fans, as he takes a 
pass from Eder and blazes high and wide from 16 yards.
 
51 min: Rodriguez nods the ball into the net from a Tadic corner and 7,000 
travelling fans go bonkers! But their celebrations are aborted when they 
realise the ref had whistled for a (non-existent) foul.
 
50 min: Superb pass by Van Dijk, bisecting Inter’s rearguard and playing the 
ball into the path of McQueen. who has been full of enterprise all night. But 
the left-back’s cross didn’t match the buildup.
 
47 min: Cute ball down the left by McQueen. Long sped on to it before going 
down under a tackle by Miranda. And the bad news is that Long seems to have 
suffered a hamstring injury. On comes Austin in his place. That, at least, 
should improve Saints’ finishing.
 
46 min: No personnel changes during the break. 
 
My guess is Puel won’t be full of cheer during the break. He’ll know his team 
should be in front. They were in charge for most of that half and created 
several clear chances, especially through Martins and Tadic down the right, but 
they have failed to finish. Austin will be introduced soon, I’ll wager. Maybe 
the lesser-spotted Boufal, too.
 
43 min: Brozovic cuts in-field and tries a shot from 20 yards. It’s blocked by 
Romeu- who else? The corner is cleared by Van Dijk - who else?
 
41 min: Eder tries to rouse the smattering of home fans with a decent low shot 
from distance. It whizzes just wide.
 
40 min: After a sad bout of mundane passing, Inter inevitably lose the ball. 
It’s becoming clear why their stadium is much less than half full.
 
38 min: Martina and Tadic combine yet again down the right. Long does 
brilliantly to flick on the ensuing cross ... and Rodriguez stretches to try to 
poke it into the net at the back post but just can’t get there. 
 Jay Rodriguez stretches but fails to get on the end of the cross. Photograph: 
Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock  
36 min: Two defenders converge on the dancing Tadic and shove him to the 
ground right in front of the linesman. Throw-in, reckons the linesman. Was his 
view obscured by the fresh air?
 
33 min: Inter get a sniff on the counter. But Eder has to wait for support 
and, when it eventually arrives, his cross is cut out by Yoshida.
 
31 min: Another Saints chance, another miss! Martina, who’s continually free 
down the right, cracks one wide from just inside the box.
 
29 min: Another chance missed by Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. This time it was 
Ward-Prowse, who leaned back and lifted a shot over from 18 yards after being 
teed up by Martina. Finishing has been a problem for Saints all season - long 
than that, in fact - and it would be a shame if it cost them tonight. Because 
in all other respects they are much better than this Inter shower.
 
28 min: Martina hoofs the ball forward following an Inter attack. Rodriguez 
collects it and bounds forward. McQueen provides support on the left. Rodriguez 
gives and goes. McQueen charges forward and then pings in a good cross. 
Handanovic gets a touch to it and deflects it on to the face of Rodriguez, who 
had slid in to try to get a touch with his feet. The ball bounces of the 
Saints’ player’s head and towards the goal! But it’s cleared off the line.

Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock  
26 min: This Inter side, to be fair, are just a crap tribute act. 
 
23 min: Ward-Prowse curls in a wonderful freekick but, inexplicably, none of 
his team-mates saw it coming. If someone had mad an appropriate move to meet 
it, a goal was there for the taking. Only Charlie Austin has those instincts, 
however, and he’s parked on the bench.
 
22 min: More polished play by Southampton. A patient, progressive move 
culminates with Tadic throwing some shapes on the right and then chipping a 
dangerous cross to the back post. Inter defend well. ButSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> will be back - they’ve been 
significantly better than the hot so far.

Alessandro Garofalo/Reuters  
19 min: Hojbjerg relieves Candreva of possession in midfield and strides 
forward. He plays the ball wide to Martins, who clips a nice cross over to the 
back post. Long jumps high, as usual, and heads into the keeper’s arms. But 
there’d have been no goal even if the ball had found the net because the ref 
spotted a push by Long.
 
17 min: A promising Saints move fizzles out when Hojbjerg plays a stray pass. 
That’s not like him. That’s several times now, though, that Saints have got 
into good positions but failed to see the move through.
 
14 min: Southampton have been the better side so far: more coherent, bolder 
and even more determined. “As a Portsmouth fan whose first love affair with a 
foreign team was the Inter Milan of the mid-2000s - Adriano in his prime, 
Javier Zanetti, Vieri, Cambiasso, Toldo, and the rest - there’s no prizes for 
guessing who I’m backing tonight,” confesses Matt Loten. “Unfortunately, even 
having made a raft of changes, I can see aSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> victory on the horizon. What 
on earth happened to the glorious Inter side that dominated Serie A and, 
briefly, Europe under Jose Mourinho? Rafa made a convenient scapegoat, but to 
move on Sneijder, Milito, Eto’o, Chivu and Maicon and replace them all with 
pale imitations was a rebuilding effort of spectacular inadequacy.”
 
11 min: After a foul on Romeu, the lion of Southampton’s midfield, Tadic tries 
to score with a freekick from 30 yards at the San Siro. That’s taking fantasy 
too far, and his shot didn’t even make it past the wall.
 
8 min: Aie! A heavy touch by Rodriguez kills a great chance for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. The ball broke to the 
forward and he ran into the left-hand side of the box and had the option of 
centring for Tadic or sidestepping the last defender and shooting. But one 
hefty touch gave the defender an opportunity to intervene and that’s what he 
did. Rodriguez, let’s remember, is still trying to regain his sharpness after a 
harrowing run of injuries.
 
7 min: Hojbjerg does brilliantly to win possession in midfield and then fizzes 
a pass down the right to Tadic, who rolls Murillo and starts scampering towards 
the box ... until the ref pulls him back for fouling Murilla.

Bruno/AP  
4 min: Trouble afoot for Southampton! There really shouldn’t have been, but 
Martina didn’t look before playing a back pass from the right-back area and 
offered a chance for Icardi. The striker beat Forster to the ball but the 
goalkeeper stayed on his feet and forced the striker out of play. A reprieve 
for Martina.
 
2 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have 
started in the way Puel has introduced, dominating possession but not just for 
the hell of it: they’re a-probin’ with pace. And their fans are having a loud 
party. It seems like there’s only one team at the San Siro in these very early 
stages.
 
1 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> kick off.
 
The teams come together for an anti-racism promotional photo and an 
opportunity, perhaps, for the Inter players to ask Virgil Van Dijk and Shane 
Long for autographs.
 
Here they come, Inter and Southampton march out together at the San Siro. The 
stadium, admittedly, looks less than a half-full but you can sure hear the 
travelling fans, who are crooning joyfully about the Saints going marching in. 
The Nerrazzuri are in their classic black and blue gear, whileSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are in their almost as 
classic red and white stripes but with red shorts.
 
Inter: Handanovic; Nagayomo, Miranda, Murillo, Santon; Gnoukouri, Medel, 
Brozovic; Candreva, Icardi, Eder

Subs: Carrizo, Palacio, Ansaldi Banega, D’ambrosio, Perisic, Yao

Southampton: Forster; Martina, Yoshida, Van Dijk, McQueen; Romeu, Ward-Prowse, 
Hojbjerg; Rodriguez, Long, Tadic

Subs: McCarthy, Clasie, Fonte, Davis, Austin, Boufal, Stephens

Referee: G Mazelka (Lithuania)

So Puel has churned again: he’s made five changes to the lineup that 
overwhelmed Burnley on Sunday. Charlie Austin drops to the bench despite 
scoring seven goals in his last six matches but Shane Long is a fine man for 
the counter-attack so the omission of Jose Fonte from central defence is a more 
dicey call, with Maya Yoshida being the replacement. For smiles, look at 
left-back: Sam McQueen, who came on as a sub against Burnley after the injury 
to Matt Targett, gets his first senior start – at the San Siro, if you please! 
Equally heartening, Sofiane Boufal is on the bench so Saints fans may finally 
get a look at their £16m summer signing from Lille. As for Inter, Icardi starts 
- who knows what the locals will make of that?
