After a shock result, a bitter exit and weeks of turmoil, finally the country 
has a new leader to guide us to a brighter future.Welcome (probably) Sam 
Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/21/sam-allardyce-new-england-manager-live>
, England manager and, for many, the epitome of an English manager. A master of 
the relegation battle, renowned for his robust, direct style, it’s easy to 
caricature “Big Sam”. So easy in fact thatMike Bassett: England Manager 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282744/> did the job in cinemas 15 years ago. Mr 
Allardyce reportedly impressed the FA with his sophisticated take on sport 
psychology and has a tactical nous sure to surprise, especially following Roy 
Hodgson. But he will now be in the spotlight like never before; seven 
acrimonious months at Newcastle is arguably his biggest job to date. He joked 
in 2012 that it was down to racism – “I won’t ever be going to a top-four club 
because I’m not called Allardici” – but his Englishness has surely bolstered 
the claim of a manager whose only honours are the Irish first division title, 
and the third division withNotts County in 1998

. If the rumours are true thatthe FA’s first choice 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/07/20/sam-allardyce-to-take-england-reins-but-only-after-arsene-wenger/>
 was his polar opposite, Arsène Wenger, it’s easy to feel that English football 
is in its usual state of chaos. Less a principled, English for England choice: 
rather, Mr Allardyce represents the best worst option for perhaps the most 
unappealing job in the game.
