Although I’m Punjabi by birth, I grew up in West Bengal. This is a region of 
India famous for fish, rice, sweets and mustard in all its forms, but its 
culinary influences reach far beyond these staples. Kolkata – the Bengali 
capital – is a major seaport and, along with a history of both Turkic and 
British rule, this makes it an ethnically diverse, metropolitan city.

In the 1870s, the city became home to a market designed for westerners, which 
saw the likes of chana (yellow split peas) introduced by the Portuguese, and 
European puff pastry, which was then redeveloped into patties. In the 19th 
century, Chinese immigrants started arriving, eventually opening restaurants to 
serve both their own community and the existing population, whose native 
recipes they spiced up with hot sauces and sliced chillies to create a number 
of hybrid dishes. These Chinese restaurants are still important to the famous 
food offering on Kolkata’s Park Street.

My mother would cook recipes learned from people who came from all over India, 
and I was exposed to a wide range of techniques and styles of cookery as a 
child. From Bengali cuisine alone there was lots to learn, frombhapa (either 
fish or vegetables cooked by steaming with spices) topaturi (fish that is 
sliced, basted with mustard oil and spices and cooked in a banana leaf).

Like my mother before me, and like West Bengal itself, my recipes draw on 
disparate inspirations, tweaked to the ingredients I happen to have at hand and 
– even better – those that can be found wherever you are. I use a global 
palette. My mission is not authenticity, but to represent the spirit of Indian 
food, which, by nature, can be easily adapted. This week’s recipes highlight 
both the flexibility and multiculturality inherent to my cooking.

The paneer (Indian curd cheese) dish harks back to my Punjabi roots, but 
builds upon them with layers of flavour from elsewhere. I’ve combined it with
panch phoron– the classic spice mix of West Bengal (cumin, fennel, fenugreek, 
mustard and nigella seeds) – and the Chinese-inspired sweet-and-sour notes of 
honey and soy sauce.

When I was young, my mother would buy soy sauce from a specialist Chinese 
shop, and then – as we weren’t used to its intense umami saltiness – she would 
dilute it, sometimes to make a dipping sauce with spring onions, fresh ginger, 
green chillies and sugar for Nepalese dumplings, known asmomo.

My spicy pork belly recipe is inspired firstly by a Goan friend of my 
father’s. He used to make something similar to vindaloo if not totally 
authentic, marinating cubes of pork belly in vinegar, chillies and garlic, and 
cooking it on the hob with potatoes (vindaloo’ comes from Portuguese words 
‘vinho’ (wine-vinegar) & ‘alho’ (garlic) the following day. I still have that 
taste in my mind today, but rather than making it into a curry, I’ve taken 
influence from his flavour base and made a slow-cooked pork belly. This aspect 
to the dish was inspired by the Ukrainian chefOlia Hercules 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/olia-hercules>, who recently made pork 
belly with my tamarind chutney. In the recipe below, I’ve also added tamarind, 
balancing its tartness with apple juice (which replaces the Goan’s use of 
vinegar). The mustard seeds are a Bengali addition, and instead of potatoes, 
I’ve used plums for some brightness and lightness.

While cucumber and mint appear most recognisably in a raita sauce, my earthy 
beetroot version, served here alongside the spicy pork, makes a gently sweet 
(not to mention beautiful) accompaniment. It’s inspired by my mother, a great 
beetroot champion, who would use the purple root fresh in everything when it 
was in season. And when it wasn’t, we’d get our fix from eating it fermented. 
Now that I live in the UK, fresh beetroot is always available, and this bowlful 
of pastel pink has become a perennial pleasure.

Spicy roasted pulled pork belly with tamarind (main picture)


My two daughters were born in Britain and this sweet, mild and tender dish 
suits their palates. This is a real crowdpleaser.

Serves 6
2kg pork belly
6 tsp tamarind paste
2 tsp mustard seeds
2 tsp red Kashmiri chilli powder
2 bay leaves
1 tsp crushed black pepper
10 plums, cut in half and stones removed
1 savoy cabbage, chopped
500ml apple juice
Salt, to taste
2 tsp rapeseed oil

1 Preheat your oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. In a roasting tray, rub the 
bottom side of the pork belly with the tamarind, mustard seeds, chilli and a 
little bit of salt. On the fat side, rub it with salt, oil and pepper. Add all 
of the apple juice to the bottom of the tray. Cover with foil and roast for 2 
hours.

2 After 2 hours, take the meat out of the tray, put the plums and cabbage 
underneath it and return the meat to the oven. Cook for a further hour.
