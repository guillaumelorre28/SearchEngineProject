Trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Norway, Apoel looked to be heading out as 
the game entered stoppage time.

However, Giannis Gianniotas, Vander and Tomas De Vincenti, the third coming in 
the ninth minute of time added-on, struck to snatch a 3-0 second-leg win and 
shatter the hopes of the Norwegian league leaders and domestic champions.

The match featured eight bookings including three in injury time.
