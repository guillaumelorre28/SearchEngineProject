The Threepenny Opera at the English National Theatre

louche and low-life, 28 May

) gave that theatre an unparalleled opportunity to intervene in our public 
life, as the authors, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, would have wished. 
“Robbing a bank’s no crime compared to owning one,” Brecht wrote in their next 
joint work, Happy End, a line he quickly transported back to the revived The 
Threepenny Opera. How this barbed satire might have resonated with today’s 
bankers’ millions. Instead we get, in Michael Billington’s words, Peachum as “a 
louche figure in high heels” and “a past liaison between Macheath and Tiger 
Brown”. Could anything indicate our decadence more powerfully?
