The future of the reported Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> target Paulo Dybala will be 
decided in the next two weeks, according to Palermo’s president Maurizio 
Zamparini.

Dybala is Palermo’s leading scorer

 with 13 Serie A goals and is thought to have attracted the attention of top 
European clubs including Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Palermo are 
keen to cash in on the 21-year-old after the Argentinian forward turned down a 
three-year contract extension in January.

“At least three teams are really interested in him,” Zamparini told the 
Italian newspaper Giornale di Sicilia. “The apple is ripe and we are ready to 
pick it.

“I think in 10, or a maximum of 15 days we will know his future. We will meet 
with the player and his agent to complete the deal. Those who understand 
football realise his potential.”

Dybala, who moved to Palermo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> in 
2012 from his home club Instituto, has scored 13 goals and set up 10 more in 34 
league appearances to ensure the Sicilian side will have another season in 
Italy’s top flight.

Palermo gained promotion to Serie A last season and are 10th in the standings 
with four games remaining.
