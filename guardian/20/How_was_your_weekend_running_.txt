Now that it’s less than a week to the big day, let’s talk Christmas Day runs. 
What’s your tradition? The other day I was chatting with someone, explaining 
that myself and the other half usually go for a longish, rambly run together 
before picking up the breakfast croissants and pain au choc treats. “Blimey” 
she said, “Don’t you even take Christmas Day off?” I was a bit nonplussed, 
before I realised that she meant that for her, running was simply a chore - and 
if there’s one day you don’t do chores, it’s Christmas Day.

But if you love running, why wouldn’t you do it on the one day of the year 
where you are almost guaranteed no traffic, good company, smiley faces (yes, 
even in London!) and a vast amount of food later on? It’s pretty much my 
favourite run of the year. Though I admit that I may be alone when it comes to 
my other personal tradition of a truly evil track session on Christmas Eve 
morning ...

But back to the weekend that’s just gone. Any PBs to report? My long run moved 
to Saturday due to party-hosting duties (happy birthday today to myvery own 
junior parkrunner!

) and I’ll say this for getting 20 miles out of the way by Saturday lunchtime - 
it gives you plenty of time to eat recovery cake ...

Share your own tales of weekend triumphs and woes - and plans for Christmas 
Day running - below the line as always.
