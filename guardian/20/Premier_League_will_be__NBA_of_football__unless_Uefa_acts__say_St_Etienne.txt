The co-president of St Etienne Bernard Caiazzo has called on Uefa to take 
action to stop the Premier League becoming “the NBA of football” after it 
receivesa record £5.14bn from its latest TV deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-sky-bt>
.

Caiazzo believes France’s Ligue 1 and other leagues in Europe will be left 
behind by the English top flight at the start of the 2016-17 season, when the 
Premier League’s TV revenue will stand at around £8.5bn for three years, taking 
into account the value of international rights.

“The Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> will 
become the NBA of football. It will be greater than the Champions League. Clubs 
such as Manchester United or Chelsea will have budgets of €700 or €800m,” he 
was quoted as saying in the French media. “What is happening in England will 
impact on Germany, Italy, Spain. And I do not imagine that Uefa will not react. 
But there will be a greater attention if the request comes from Bayern 
[Munich], Real [Madrid] , Barcelona or Milan instead of St Etienne.”

Caiazzo’s comments are of particular interest given that he recently confirmed 
thatSt Etienne <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stetienne> are in talks 
with Manchester City over the possibility of creating a partnership that will 
allow the Premier League club to benefit from the French club’s young talent.

Caiazzo told the Independent 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/manchester-city-plan-to-link-up-with-stetienne-confirmed-by-president-10040001.html>
: “It all looks very serious. City have been impressed by our talent for 
producing players of Champions League standard. These people are willing to 
work in depth.”
