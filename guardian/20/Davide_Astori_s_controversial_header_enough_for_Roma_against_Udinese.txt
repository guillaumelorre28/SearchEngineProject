Roma boosted their Serie A title challenge with a 1-0 win at Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese> on Tuesday amid controversy over 
whether Davide Astori’s header had crossed the line for the game’s only goal.

Astori’s header from a Francesco Totti free-kick bounced down off the 
underside of the crossbar and into the arms of the Udinese goalkeeper Orestis 
Karnezis in the 17th minute.

The referee Marco Guida initially appeared to wave play on but then seemed to 
change his mind and awarded the goal amid angry Udinese protests.

“The goalline official told me it wasn’t a goal but it’s the referee who 
decides and I think he saw it correctly,” Astori said.

Goalline technology is not used in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball>, although the Italian 
league employs additional assistant referees, a system, pioneered by Uefa, that 
features an extra official on each goalline.

Television replays were inconclusive because of a goal post obstructing the 
view of the ball.

There was more controversy in the second half when Panagiotis Kone appeared to 
be bundled over by Urby Emanuelson but the home team’s appeals for a penalty 
were turned down. The win putsRoma <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> 
level on 39 points with Serie A leaders Juventus, who host Internazionale later 
on Tuesday.
