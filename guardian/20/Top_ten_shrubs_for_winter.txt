Blue-stem willow

The common name of Salix irrorata may be a slight bending of the truth 
(imagine glaucous grey instead, possibly lavender blue in the right light) but 
this robust species is far happier in damp, troublesome soil than many other 
shrubs. The stems are initially deep red, before developing their grey bloom as 
winter arrives, and later that season they’re joined by showy catkins that 
start out the fluffiest grey, then become dusted with yellow pollen as they 
mature.

Stem colour is best in full sun, and catkins are most prolific on new wood, so 
hard-prune each spring. A similar effect can be achieved with white-stemmed 
bramble(Rubus cockburnianus 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/16128/i-Rubus-cockburnianus-i-(F)/Details>) if 
you prefer arching stems to upright ones.

An obvious choice, but I’ll take the hit because this shrub is simply 
stunning. Position this cornus anywhere but the front of a border, because it’s 
pretty dull in summer yet it makes a good foil for smaller deciduous shrubs or 
herbaceous perennials. Come winter, though, the vivid stems - golden yellow at 
the base and pink-orange at the tips - will shine out like a beacon. Best 
planted in groups for maximum glow – prune back hard just as the buds break in 
spring.

 Cream of the crop:Stachyurus ‘Magpie’ is ideal for training against shady 
walls.
 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
A scrambling deciduous shrub, you can easily add impact to shady walls by 
training this woodland dweller against them. Kept moist and cool at the roots 
with a thick mulch, the lanky stems lend themselves perfectly to fan training.

One used to grow against the staff entrance of the RHS Wisley 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/gardens/wisley> laboratory building. Walking past it in 
summer was nice enough – I used to gaze at the teardrop-shaped leaves that were 
splashed on their margins with yellow, cream and white variegations. But come 
late winter, this shrub reveals its trump card: pendulous racemes of cream, 
bell-shaped flowers. It heightened my spirits before many a staff meeting. 
Fragrant winter hazel (Corylopsis glabrescens 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/4499/Corylopsis-glabrescens/Details>) is a good 
substitute if you’d prefer a free-standing shrub for shade, with the bonus of 
fragrant flowers, too.

Loropetalum chinense ‘Fire Dance’

Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing more uplifting than the waft then sight of 
a witch hazel in full bloom, but this hamamelis relative is a refreshing change 
to the usual yellows and oranges. It bears hot pink spidery winter flowers 
among small evergreen leaves which have a dusky purple tone. It’s not fully 
hardy, so we grow ours in a pot (50:50 mix of John Innes No 3 and ericaceous 
compost) so it can be brought into a conservatory or cool greenhouse for 
winter. Keep the roots just moist during this time.

 Point taken:Rosa pteracantha’s flowers are mundane, but its oversized red 
thorns are a winter treat. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
This vigorous species rose would be a fairly mundane garden addition (the 
white flowers are average) were it not for its oversized transparent red 
thorns. Site it at the back of a border or allow it to be freestanding in rough 
grassland – it can easily throw up shoots 10ft long. Removing a proportion of 
older stems completely in winter will ensure a succession of new, vigorous 
shoots – these have the showiest thorns.

 Tassel treats:Garrya elliptica ‘James Roof’ needs a sunny, sheltered spot. 
Photograph: RM Floral/Alamy Stock Photo 
Another classic. This evergreen shrub works well against sunny, sheltered 
walls (it’s prone to leaf scorch otherwise, which looks pretty ugly). It minds 
its own business for three quarters of the year, but come late autumn, tiny 
silver catkins emerge against the holly-like leaves. Slowly but surely they 
elongate – and by mid to late winter they’ve stretched to 20cm in length. This 
male variety has particularly long catkins.

evergreen foliage. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
Another great contender for the conservatory or greenhouse during winter, this 
mound-forming evergreen shrub (as the name implies) bears needle-like foliage – 
green on top and silver underneath.

The tubular spider-like flowers of Grevillea rosmarinifolia 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/8115/Grevillea-rosmarinifolia/Details> are 
rosy-red and appear in clustered bursts from midwinter right through till 
summer. Grow it in a pot of ericaceous compost so it can easily be moved 
outside during the warmer months – or popped aside when it’s having a rest from 
all that flowering.

Abeliophyllum distichum Roseum Group 

Meet the forsythia’s less brazen cousin, the white forsythia 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=2> (or, in this case, pale 
pink). It’s far more dainty than a yellow forsythia, too, producing lax shoots 
that can be wall-trained if you have the patience. Site it against a sunny 
backdrop to encourage wood to ripen (this improves winter hardiness). A frost 
would turn flowers brown, so the shelter of a sunny wall or fence helps keep 
cold at bay. Claims of fragrance are true, but only just in my experience. But 
the spidery winter and spring flowers more than make up for it.

 Notable shrub:Correa ‘Dusky Bells’ throws out blooms from October to March. 
Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
One more contender for the winter conservatory is the Australian fuchsia. This 
particular variety has deep, buff-pink bells as flowers. The gentle reflex 
makes them look a little like the dress you’d wear if attempting a ballroom 
waltz. The blooms can appear any time from October till March, so you get 
plenty of bang for your buck.

Keep these tender evergreens compact by occasionally pinching out any straggly 
shoots. In time you may need to insert a few canes to support larger plants, 
but generally growth is sturdy and woody unless low light or high temperatures 
cause it to stretch.

 Pink perfume: the fragrant flowers of Daphne odora ‘Aureomarginata’ are set 
against variegated leaves. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
I tend to shy away from daphnes, having seen far too many samples brought to 
the RHS advisory desks that just look sickly. Their roots are fussy – soil 
can’t be too dry, too wet or too shallow, and roots mustn’t “cook” in full sun. 
Exposure to any of these scenarios knocks plants back considerably and recovery 
is slow.

Having said that, the Beth Chatto mantra “right plant, right place” is never 
more apt. This particular variegated daphne also graced a shady yet 
free-draining border of the Wisley laboratory, and when it was in full winter 
bloom I would find any excuse to walk across the courtyard from the advisory 
offices to the library, visitor reception, pathology lab or wherever just so 
that I could inhale the air. The variegation is an attractive addition, too.
