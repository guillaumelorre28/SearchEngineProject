John Gregory has been confirmed as the new manager of Crawley Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/crawley-town> on an 18-month contract.

Gregory, 59, spent four years at Villa Park between 1998 and 2002 but last 
managed in England at Queens Park Rangers in 2007. During his time away from 
English football Gregory managed two clubs in Israel, Maccabi Ahi Nazareth – 
with whom he was relegated from the Premier League – and Ashdod, as well as 
another in Kazakhstan, FC Kairat, who he left in 2012.

"I'm delighted to be here, back in English football at a club who have made 
tremendous progress over the last three years,"Gregory told the club's official 
website 
<http://www.crawleytownfc.com/news/article/john-gregory-appointment-1212013.aspx>
. "When I met the directors I was impressed by their ambition to keep on moving 
Crawley Town forward. You can't stand still in football and the potential at 
this club is enormous. We have got a good squad of players and I have every 
confidence that they can challenge for the play-offs. You have to aim high and 
I'm really looking forward to getting on the training ground with the players 
and kicking on."

Crawley sacked their previous manager Richie Barker last week. The 38-year-old 
former Bury manager had been in charge since August 2012 and took them to 10th 
place inLeague One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> 
last season. However, they have not won any of their last eight league games, 
scoring only once, and lie in 15th place.
