They travel to Munich in midweek with only goal difference separating the only 
two sides still to have a 100% record.

Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke>, meanwhile, remain 
inside the bottom two with no points from three league games under Markus 
Weinzierl, although they have picked up wins in both the German Cup and the 
Europa League.

In Sunday’s other game Mainz got the better of Weinzierl’s former club Augsburg
 with a 3-1 win in Bavaria lifting them to ninth.

Jhon Cordoba set Martin Schmidt’s men on their way to victory, although 
Kostantinos Stafylidis levelled for the hosts before Yunus Malli restored 
Mainz’s lead.

Yoshinori Muto sealed Mainz’s first win of the season, although a red card for 
José Rodríguez in stoppage time will mean Schmidt must make at least one change 
for his side’s trip to bottom-placed Werder Bremen on Wednesday.
