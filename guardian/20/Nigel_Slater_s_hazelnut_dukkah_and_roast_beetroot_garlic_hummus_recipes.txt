There are coriander and cumin seeds toasting in a dry, shallow pan on the hob. 
Once they are deep walnut brown, I toss in sesame seeds and continue to toast 
till they’re golden. Once they darken to a deep brown-gold and their smell, 
warm and aromatic, filters through the kitchen, I put them in the mortar and 
crush them, with a sort of twisting, pounding action – the very same push and 
twist action with which I make pesto if I’m not using the food processor.

I continue until they resemble rough crumbs, after which they are joined by 
toasted, skinned hazelnuts and almonds, flakes of sea salt and dried thyme. It 
is not often I use dried herbs, but bear with me. I carry on bashing at the mix 
till I have a deeply fragrant, crunchy mix, neither paste nor powder, but 
somewhere in between, and deeply, headily scented. This seed-spice mixture then 
gets put into a glass jar, tightly lidded and placed within arm’s reach till 
needed.

The spice mix, my version of the dukkah found throughout the Middle East, is 
invaluable for introducing crunch, spice and aroma to everything from creamed 
chickpeas to mashed broad beans. It offers texture to a smooth purée and warm 
spicy notes to anything mild and creamy, perhaps a broad bean hummus or a purée 
of sweet roots such as beetroot, or pumpkin.

Stir the seed and spice mix into a little olive oil and you have an intense 
dip for torn pieces of warm flatbread, or for dipping sticks of celery or 
boiled eggs into. If I am using yogurt as a sauce for trickling over couscous, 
grilled chicken or steamed vegetables then out comes this spice mix, tossed 
like a farmer scattering seed, over the surface. Sometimes I tip it straight 
from the jar into my hand and eat it like a fistful of peanuts.

Hazelnut dukkah

hazelnuts 75g
almonds 100g 
coriander seeds 2 tbsp
cumin seeds 1 tbsp
sesame seeds 3 tbsp
black sesame seeds 3 tbsp
sea salt flakes 1 tsp
black pepper ½ tsp
dried thyme 1 tbsp 


Put the kettle on. Warm a dry, shallow pan over a low heat, then add the 
hazelnuts and let their skins darken, occasionally shaking the pan to prevent 
them from burning.

I bash the spices and seeds till I have a fragrant, crunchy mix

Put the almonds into a heatproof mixing bowl then pour over the boiling water 
from the kettle and leave to soak for 10 minutes. When the hazelnuts are deep 
brown in colour, remove from the heat and tip them into a clean tea towel. Rub 
the hazelnuts together in the tea towel until the skins flake off. Remove the 
nuts from the towel and return to the pan, toasting them to a deep, warm brown. 
Roughly chop them, leaving some of the pieces quite large.

Remove the almonds from the hot water with a draining spoon and pop them out 
of their skins. A quick squeeze between thumb and forefinger should do it. Put 
the almonds into the shallow pan and brown as evenly as you can, then tip on to 
a chopping board and roughly chop, or into a food processor and blitz.

In the shallow pan, toast the coriander and cumin seeds till dark and 
fragrant, taking great care not to burn them, then tip them into a mortar. 
Toast the sesame seeds for a couple of minutes, till the white ones turn 
golden. Crush the spices and seeds to a coarse powder with a pestle. (Use a 
mixing bowl and pound with a rolling pin if you have no pestle and mortar.) Add 
the nuts to the ground spices then stir in the salt, pepper and the dried thyme.

When cool, pack into a storage jar. It will keep for a couple of weeks.

 ‘The spice mix offers texture to a smooth purée and warm spicy notes to 
anything mild and creamy’: Nigel Slater’s roast beetroot garlic hummus recipe.

You can make a quick version of this with ready-cooked beetroot, canned 
chickpeas and raw garlic, blitzed to a purée in a food processor, but I prefer 
this version. Roasting the beetroot, garlic and chickpeas together is unusual 
but gives a sweet, mellow quality. You will need some warm flatbread or hot 
toast on the side. The hummus keeps well enough for a day or two in the fridge, 
tightly covered with clingfilm.

Makes enough for 8
chickpeas 2 x 400g tins
beetroot 500g
garlic 4 cloves
water 200ml
olive oil 5 tbsp


To finish:
tahini 1 tbsp
olive oil 200ml
lemon juice 100ml
hazelnut dukkah to serve


Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Line a baking tin with foil, leaving enough 
to fold over and seal the contents. Rinse the chickpeas in running water then 
tip them into the foil-lined baking tin. Peel the beetroot then chop each into 
about six pieces and add them to the chickpeas. Peel the garlic, then tuck 
among the beetroot. Pour in the water and olive oil, season lightly then fold 
over the foil and seal by lightly scrunching the edges together. Bake for an 
hour then open the foil and test for tenderness. If you can’t insert a metal 
skewer or knife point with the minimum of pressure then return to the oven for 
a little longer.

Transfer the beetroot, garlic, about three-quarters of the chickpeas and any 
liquid to a food processor and process to a smooth purée. Mix in the tahini, 
olive oil and lemon juice, then taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if 
required. Scrape into a serving bowl, cover with clingfilm then refrigerate 
till necessary.

Serve with some of the hazelnut dukkah and the remaining chickpeas scattered 
over.
