Bayern Munich attacked right from the start against Borussia Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> and went ahead 
after 16 minutes when Arturo Vidal powered home a header from Rafinha’s cross.

Fifteen minutes later, Douglas Costa celebrated his first start of the season 
by taking David Alaba’s cross on his chest and firing the ball inside the left 
post. The Brazilian ran over to two Munich fans, posed and took a selfie with 
them.

It was all Munich with Mönchengladbach offering next to nothing in attack. But 
for an early shot over the bar on a counterattack from Fabian Johnson, every 
other effort in the first half came from the home side.

Munich were able to conserve energy for the second half, when André Hahn 
struck the post for the visitors.
