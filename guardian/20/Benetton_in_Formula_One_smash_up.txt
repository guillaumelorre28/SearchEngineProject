Formula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> motor racing has 
been hit by a blazing row over the leak of investment talks involving Benetton, 
the Italian clothing retailer and team owner. Last week City investment house 
Morgan Grenfell Private Equity surprised the racing world by paying $325 
million for a 12.5 per cent stake in tycoon Bernie Ecclestone's grand prix 
organisation. MGPE is also seeking investors - which were to have included 
Benetton's 21 Investimenti - for another 37.5 per cent, worth $975m.

As a result of the premature publicity Benetton has now frozen negotiations 
with MGPE that would have seen it taking a stake of between 5 and 10 per cent, 
worth up to Â£160m , in Formula One. Benetton is furious that the secret talks 
were leaked by an unknown source to the Financial Times last week.

'We're still trying to decide whether it's worth doing,' a Benetton adviser 
said. 'Talks have been postponed. When you read your name in the press like 
this, it doesn't give the best signal.'

The row comes as the racing season reaches its climax, with the Japanese Grand 
Prix today, at which Britain's Eddie Irvine and Finland's Mika Hakkinen will 
battle it out for the championship title.

21 Investimenti, headed by Alessandro Benetton, has taken stakes in a wide 
range of firms across Europe. This week London will see the European launch of 
its boo.com, an Internet sports retailer.
