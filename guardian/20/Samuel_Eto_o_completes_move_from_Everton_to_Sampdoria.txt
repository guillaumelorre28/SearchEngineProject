Samuel Eto’o has completed his protracted move from Everton to the Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria>. The 33-year-old striker, a 
four-times African footballer of the year and Champions League winner with 
Barcelona and Internazionale, has joined on a two-and-a-half year deal with the 
Serie A club.

Roberto Martínez thanked Eto’o, who joined Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> on a free transfer in August 
2014. He scored four goals in 20 appearances.

The Everton manager told the club’s website 
<http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/01/27/etoo-completes-sampdoria-move>: “We 
thank Samuel for his efforts and for bringing his knowhow to the team and to 
Finch Farm where he passed on some of his terrific experience to all of the 
young players in particular.

“The memory of his performances in Europe stand out especially. On behalf of 
all Evertonians, we wish him well for the next chapter in his career.”
