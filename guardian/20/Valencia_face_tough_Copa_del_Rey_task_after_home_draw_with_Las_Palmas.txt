The former England and Manchester United defender took over as the coach at 
the Mestalla last month after Nuno Espírito Santo was sacked but has yet to 
secure a win in La Liga in six attempts. Fans waved white handkerchiefs at the 
final whistle .

The draw left Neville frustrated but he was upbeat about Valencia’s 
performance. “When you draw a game at home you are always disappointed,” the
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> manager said. “But if 
we play like we did today again we will win matches.”

Valencia fell behind in the 38th minute when the midfielder Wilfried Zahibo 
headed past his own goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from a free-kick.

Paco Alcácer equalised in the 61st minute with a well-struck shot from just 
outside the area but the home side were unable to make sustained late pressure 
count.

Álvaro Negredo fluffed a great chance in the third minute of added time when 
he failed to connect cleanly with a José Luis Gayà centre, leavingLas Palmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laspalmas> with an advantage for next 
week’s return leg in the Canary Islands.
