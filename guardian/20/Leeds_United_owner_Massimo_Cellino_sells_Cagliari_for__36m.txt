The Leeds United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited> owner 
Massimo Cellino has sold Cagliari to an Italian company Fluorsid Group, the 
Serie A club have announced.

Fluorsid, a chemical company based in Cagliari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cagliari> and owned by the Giulini 
family, has acquired a 100% stake of the Sardinia football club for a reported 
€45m (£36m).

A statement from the club read: “Today a contract has been signed for the sale 
of the 100% stake of Cagliari Calcio to Fluorsid Group.”

Cellino purchased Cagliari in 1992 and had been looking to sell the club since 
acquiring a 75% stake in Leeds earlier this year.

He revealed last week he had entered negotiations with the Giulini family to 
hand over the club after the sale of Cagliari to an American consortium group 
fell through earlier this month.

“During the first few months of 2014, I convinced myself that the time had 
come to end my 22-year experience at the helm of Cagliari Calcio,” Cellino told 
the club website.

“They have been intense and marvellous years during which I have experienced 
unforgettable moments. I want to thank everyone that has accompanied me in this 
journey.

“The club shareholders have taken a careful decision with regards to the 
sporting ambitions of the club, the seriousness of the project and the 
adherence of the territorial values.

“Cagliari Calcio is in need and deserves a precise and ambitious project. 
Fluorside Group and Tommaso Giulini are a guarantee in this sense. The fans can 
be calm. Cagliari Calcio will continue a journey of sustainable growth.”

The new owner Giulini inherits a club that finished 15th in the Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> standings, seven points 
clear of the drop zone.
