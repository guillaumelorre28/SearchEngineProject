<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> club have confirmed 
the 60-year-old former Aston Villa manager will require a lengthy period of 
recovery.

Saunders, who was last in work as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, will 
step in and be in charge of Sunday’s game against Colchester. A club statement 
read: “Crawley Town can confirm that team manager John Gregory is stepping down 
from his position with immediate effect.

“John will be undergoing a major open-heart surgery operation at the beginning 
of January and afterwards will need a lengthy period of recuperation. This 
operation needs to be done as soon as possible but is not stress-related.

“The club have appointed Dean Saunders as interim team manager. Dean will be 
responsible for every aspect of the playing side including coaching, player 
recruitment and scouting.

“After an illustrious 19-year playing career Dean had spells as assistant 
manager at Blackburn, Newcastle and with the Welsh national team. He was in 
charge for three years at Wrexham before spells at Doncaster Rovers and Wolves.

“The club would urge all our supporters to get behind Dean, starting on Sunday 
when he will take charge of the team for the home game against Colchester 
United.”

Saunders takes over with Crawley in the relegation zone in League One 
following Boxing Day’s 4-1 defeat at fellow strugglers Leyton Orient.
