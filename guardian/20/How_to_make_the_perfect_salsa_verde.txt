Sometimes, someone says something so perfectly that it’s pointless to try and 
put it any better yourself. Nigel Slater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/15/nigel-slater-soothing-sausage-recipes>
’s love letter to “a sausage in the pan” in Real Food has stuck with me for 
almost two decades, and it’s recently been joined byRachel Roddy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-roddy>’s description of salsa 
verde: “A gorgeous green goddess of a sauce that precipitates a number of 
adjectives you could be fined for overusing: grassy, peppery, warm, musty, 
briny, fishy, oily, brilliant.”

That’s it in a perfectly formed nutshell: a piquant, aromatic condiment 
traditionally relied upon to bring a little zing to poached meats or fish, but 
which is also perfectly delicious with everything from roasted cauliflower to 
scrambled eggs. Like so many Italian classics, salsa verde boasts countless 
regional variations, all of which are claimed to be the only true version. But 
where’s the best place to start?

The herbs

Parsley is non-negotiable in salsa verde – as with tabbouleh, it’s the 
backbone of the dish, so I’m slightly surprised to discover that the Silver 
Spoon’s recipe 
<http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/home-garden/food/hake-with-salsa-verde-32112.html>
 calls for a single sprig, “leaves only”. After making it even with a very 
generously endowed stem, I decide something must have been lost in translation 
for the seminal Italian cook book, given they use no other herbs – presumably a 
single bunch was intended.

Roddy <https://racheleats.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/the-sauce-is-greener/> uses 
equal parts of parsley and basil with a little less mint in her book Five 
Quarters, andTessa Kiros’s Limoncello and Linen Water

Although one of the beauties of salsa verde is its infinite tweakability, I 
think the tarragon- and thyme-based variations are less versatile than the 
others – they would both be lovely with chicken or fish, but their powerful 
flavours work less well with other meats. The more subtle sweetness of basil 
seems a more harmonious pairing with peppery parsley: I can’t taste the mint in 
such small quantities, so I suspect its inclusion is merely homeopathic. If 
you’re a massive mint fan, feel free to stick in a great, generous handful 
instead.

contain garlic, but in fact Boswell favours finely chopped shallot or red 
onion, and Hartnett and Katie Parla and Kristina Gill’s lovely new bookTasting

Felicity Cloake for the Guardian 
Garlic is always a happy pairing with parsley, but Boswell macerates his 
shallots in red wine vinegar for 45 minutes, which gives them a bright acidity 
that, for me, seems the very essence of salsa verde, which should either cut 
through rich, fatty ingredients or pep up soft, bland ones. Controversial it 
may be, but I’m going with the shallot. Use a couple of small cloves of garlic 
if this offends you.

The sour stuff

Though pickled onions may be unusual, almost all the recipes I try involve 
something a bit vinegary: often capers (though Roddy and Boswell both prefer 
the salted variety) and sometimes gherkins, as in the Hartnett and the Silver 
Spoon recipes. Kiros adds a little Dijon mustard (an ingredient also favoured 
by the River Cafe’s Classic Italian Cookbook), and Locatelli, Parla and Gill 
and the Silver Spoon all dash in some white wine vinegar, too.

I also try substituting lemon juice, as Marcella Hazan, a true grande dame of 
Italian cookery, informs me in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking that 
this is more appropriate with fish, but my testers prefer the fuller, fruitier 
sharpness of red wine vinegar for general purposes. Capers, they decide, ought 
to be salted – as well they might, given they didn’t spend 10 minutes trying to 
rinse the salt off the things.

The salty stuff

Capers, of course, can stand alone in a vegetarian salsa verde, but they can’t 
match the anchovy for sheer umami. Not everyone uses them, but those who do are 
generous (Roddy sticks in an entire tin) and I’m inclined to be so, too; this 
should be a sauce of bold flavours.

Spices

That said, we agree that Kiros’s chilli powder tastes out of place here – if 
you must have heat, the sharper warmth of chilli flakes would be preferable. 
Or, of course, get busy with an aptly enormous pepper grinder.

To thicken or not to thicken?

Though salsa verde can be made from little more than herbs, oil and a few 
capers or anchovies, some of the recipes I try thicken it with boiled egg yolk 
(Locatelli and the Silver Spoon), mashed potato (the Silver Spoon) and 
breadcrumbs (dried for Locatelli, fresh and soaked in a little vinegar for 
Parla and Gill). The potato doesn’t find much favour (though salsa verde is 
delicious with potatoes, particularly the new season variety), but the egg 
yolks and breadcrumbs bulk it out sufficiently to turn it into a delicious 
stuffing or sandwich relish. Popular opinion states, however, that neither is 
strictly necessary in this basic version.

The method

Perhaps more contentious than any single ingredient in salsa verde is the 
manufacturing process. Locatelli writes: “I prefer to make salsa verde with a 
mortar and pestle, the way it was made for centuries before modern kitchen 
gadgets came along. You can, of course, use a food processor, but it tends to 
warm up the sauce and darken the fantastic bright green colour, whereas in a 
mortar you don’t crush out any of the flavour or colour.” Roddy, however, 
prefers it “chopped by hand, as it has more substance and a more distinct 
texture, which is obliterated into a more consistent, pleasing smoothness by a 
food processor”. Hartnett recommends a mini-processor for the task.

I’m inclined, again, to agree with Roddy when she writes that: “It’s not that 
one is better than the other, only different.” Hartnett’s silkier variety is 
just as pleasing as the chunkier chopped ones, and slides over meat better – 
but, oddly enough, Locatelli’s tastes markedly more aromatic than either, even 
to those of us who haven’t spent 15 minutes working the pestle and mortar. Do 
whatever you have time for, but give the pounded version a try when you have 
some anger to work off, just to see if you also think it’s worth the effort.

I’m going to leave the last word to Roddy on this one. Read the advice above, 
try the version below… and then go ahead and make the recipe your own.

 Felicity Cloake’s perfect salsa verde. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the 
Guardian 
(Makes 1 small jar)

1 small shallot, finely chopped

2 tbsp red wine vinegar

4 anchovies, rinsed if packed in salt

Leaves from about 30g flat-leaf parsley (about 20g leaves)

Leaves from about 30g basil (about 20g leaves)

2 tbsp salted capers, rinsed and roughly chopped

120-150ml extra virgin olive oil

Put the shallot in a small non-metallic bowl with the vinegar and leave to 
soak for 45 minutes.

After half an hour, mash the anchovies in a pestle and mortar, then gradually 
add the herbs and capers and pound to a smoothish paste (I prefer to leave it a 
little chunky, which is why I add the capers last).

Stir in the shallot, with a little of the soaking vinegar, then slowly whisk 
in the oil until you achieve your desired consistency. Taste and add more of 
the vinegar if you like, plus seasoning if necessary. Store in an air-tight 
container in the fridge.

Salsa verde – cheerfully adaptable or infinitely abused by meddling 
foreigners? Which particular regional variation do you prefer, and what do you 
serve it with?
