Falkirk have suspended their PA announcer for making "inappropriate" comments 
aboutRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> at the weekend.

The stadium announcer reportedly referred to Rangers as "Sevco Franchise" when 
reading out half-time scores during the interval at Falkirk's game against 
Raith Rovers on Saturday. The Scottish First Division side have also apologised 
to Rangers and launched an investigation.

The remarks make reference to Sevco Scotland, the name of the company who 
purchased the business and assets of Rangers in the summer, after the club was 
consigned to liquidation. Shareholders voted in favour of the owner Sevco 
Scotland Limited changing its name to The Rangers Football Club Limited at an 
extraordinary general meeting in July.

A statement from Falkirk's chairman Martin Ritchie on their official website 
read: "We have already apologised to Rangers FC and would now like to apologise 
to the many Rangers supporters who have been in contact with the club.Falkirk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk> FC are treating this incident 
very seriously and the individual concerned has been suspended from his duties, 
pending a full investigation by the club."

The two clubs are to face each other in the second round of the Ramsdens Cup 
on Tuesday at the Falkirk Stadium, before meeting again in the Scottish 
Communities League Cup at Ibrox next week.

When asked about the comments, Rangers' manager Ally McCoist said: "I couldn't 
give a monkey's, to be honest with you. If he wants to have a wee dig, he can 
have a wee dig. I don't have a problem with it at all. It's probably not the 
right thing to do, I'd have to say, but I've got far bigger things to worry 
about than that."
