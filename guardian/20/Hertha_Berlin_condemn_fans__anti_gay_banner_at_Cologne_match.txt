Hertha Berlin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin> have 
criticised supporters who displayed a large anti-gay banner during the side’s 
Bundesliga win against Cologne on Saturday.

The banner, approximately 50 metres long, said: “WH96: Rather a mother than 
two fathers!” It was apparently directed at a Cologne ultra group called Die 
Wilde Horde 1996 (WH96), whose members have been involved in an ongoing spat 
with their Berlin counterparts.

Hertha reacted with a tweet to its fans to “Leave out the stupidity! Hertha 
Berlin has always distanced itself from every form of discrimination.”

The banner had drawn a mostly negative reaction on social media. Football 
magazine 11 Freunde wrote: “A pity, Hertha, everything thrown away again.”

Paul Keuter, a Hertha board member, responded by saying: “This stupid 
discrimination has definitely nothing to do with Hertha Berlin.”

The German football federation is looking into the matter, the chairman of its 
supervisory board Anton Nachreiner told Cologne newspaper Express.
