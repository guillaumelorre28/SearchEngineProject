Blackpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackpool> have said the 
choice of song at Saturday’s game was unintentional, after some of Bradford’s 
fans took offence at the lyrics in the Billy Joel song and later complained on 
social media.

“The club would like to apologise for any unintentional offence caused by a 
song played at [Saturday’s] match,” Blackpool said on their official Twitter 
site.

Bradford made no reference to the song during the live commentary on their 
official website and have not commented on the incident.

The Bradford fire occurred during the club’s final home league game against 
Lincoln in 1985, killing 54 Bradford fans, two Lincoln fans and injuring dozens 
more.

The fire is thought to have been started accidentally when a lit cigarette was 
dropped under Valley Parade’s wooden main stand.
