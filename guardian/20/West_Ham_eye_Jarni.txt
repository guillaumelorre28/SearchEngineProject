The Croatian international Robert Jarni will soon be in England for a trial 
with West Ham, according to his current clubLas Palmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laspalmas>.

The 32-year-old wing-back has not been in his coach Fernando Vazquez's plans 
this season and the Spanish side confirmed on their website that they were keen 
to offload him.

Jarni, whose former clubs include Real Madrid, Juventus, Torino and Real 
Betis, signed for Coventry in 1998 but left without playing a game in England 
after an apparent change of heart. Capped 67 times by Croatia, he made 26 
appearances in the Liga last season and scored twice.

The former Chelsea and Brentford manager David Webb has resigned from Third 
Division Southend United. The 56-year-old, who recently had tests for a heart 
complaint, leaves after exactly a year in charge, with his assistant manager 
Rob Newman placed in temporary control.

Webb told the club's official website: "When I came in there were times when I 
sat in the office until one or two in the morning looking at situations. I've 
got to say I don't think that, as hard as I have worked, those problems have 
gone away."

European football's governing body Uefa expects Chelsea's Uefa Cup game 
against Hapoel Tel Aviv to go ahead in Israel next Thursday but will monitor 
the ramifications of the Afghan campaign.
