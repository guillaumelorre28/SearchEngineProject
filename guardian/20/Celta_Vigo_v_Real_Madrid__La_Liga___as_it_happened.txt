Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> march on, and 
are just two points behind Barcelona at the top of La Liga, but they were lucky 
here. Both teams’ defending was suicidal, which made for a thrilling game, and 
a hatful of chances. Ultimately Real’s players showed their quality in 
finishing those opportunities – Hernandez in particular – but Celta can feel 
aggrieved that they didn’t get the rub of the green from the referee.

Isco didn’t have the best game, but he did whip out a spinning roulette pass 
to set up Real’s third goal, so at least we can hang our collective hats on 
that. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!

90+2 min: With their six at the back, Real are popping it about, as the clock 
counts down. They’ve definitely got away with one here, and but for a couple of 
lucky bounces, and a couple of decisions in their favour, could well have lost. 
As it is, they are still in the title race.

89 min: Krohn-Dehli and Carvajal are both shown a yellow card for dissent, 
with Real angry at the fact that Celta didn’t kick the ball out of play so that 
Kroos could receive treatment. The German appeared to jar his knee in a 
challenge with Bongonda. Carvajal will also now miss the next match, which 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing, based upon tonight’s performance.

87 min: Nolito has been a constant menace tonight, he is a definite contender 
to be man-of-the-match along with Hernandez. He is very one-footed though, and 
Varane should know that he will want to cut back on his right. Nolito does 
exactly that, but flashes his shot wide.

@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> my 4 year old could 
slot into reals Dfence the way they r playin tonight. Where do u think Nolito 
will be next season?

<https://twitter.com/KukuAgamiCPH/status/592424085398884353> 
I would love to see him in England, I think his direct approach in the final 
third and the way he commits defenders would really suit the Premier League. 
Looks to have the physique for it, too. Perhaps a club like Southampton?

84 min: Ramos is booked for going in late on Celta’s Hernandez. That’s 10 
yellow cards for the season now, so he will be suspended for Real’s match 
against Almeria on Wednesday.

81 min: The tempo of the match has gone out of the game since Orellana and 
Mina went off. That will suit Real fine, Ronaldo is happy simply to play 
keep-ball. The Portuguese has been booed all night by the Celta fans.

79 min: Another decision goes against Celta, Berizzo is furious on the 
touchline: Nolito cutting in off his left and going down under the challenge of 
Carvajal. It’s a poor tackle but the referee waives play on. Lucky Carvajal, 
he’s had a poor match, and Porto’s Danilo, who is due to join Real in the 
summer, will be watching this with glee.

77 min: Krohn-Dehli is again harshly penalised for a challenge on Carvajal. 
Celta definitely haven’t got the run of the decisions tonight. The rejection of 
that penalty claim when the score just before the hour mark is looking costly 
for the home side.

72 min: More subs, as Larrivey is replaced by Charles, which is presumably to 
protect the former, whose head wound is STILL bleeding. Pepe, meanwhile comes 
on for… Hernandez! So the Mexican won’t get his hat-trick, but he’s a real team 
player and smiles as he jogs up the pitch, before lapping up the high-fives on 
the bench. Real now playing five at the back.

70 min: Celta make their first change: Orellana coming off for Bongonda. 
That’s surprising to me, the Chilean has arguably been Celta’s best player!

“Celta/RM: slightly more interesting than Arsenal/Chelsea” suggests Mark 
Turner. Erm, yep.

Celta have magnificent going forward tonight, but shocking at the back. Ramos 
is allowed to walk the ball out of defence, and entering Celta half, he has 
time to pick his pass with the outside of his foot, deliciously lifting it into 
the path of Hernandez, who takes one touch and calmly finishes past Sergio with 
a sidefoot shot. Game over?

defensive shape, with Isco playing a little deeper, and Rodriguez tucking in on 
the right. They need it too, they’ve had just 45% possession so far!

62 min: Chance for Hernandez! Real are sitting back, which is causing them 
problems, but they continue to look dangerous in hitting Celta on the break: 
Ronaldo sprints down the right, lays the ball across the box to Hernandez but 
the Mexican misses at the far post. The pass from Ronaldo was probably a little 
heavy in truth, but Hernandez still should have done better with his left foot, 
or taken a touch back onto his right.

59 min: Nolito is continuing his roasting of Carvajal, stepping over the ball, 
leaving the right-back for dead and coasting into the area. Illarramendi slides 
in to cover, but he can only clear for a corner. It’s whipped into the six-yard 
box, pinballs off various heels and knees, and somehow is cleared. Real are 
living very dangerously here, they desperately need to make a tactical change.

57 min: Surely a penalty for Celta! Oh, that’s as clearcut as you’re ever 
likely to see: Kroos clattering into Orellana from behind. How the referee 
doesn’t give that is beyond me.

54 min: This is end to end stuff, the tempo of this game is relentless. Both 
Celta and Real are attacking with little regard for their respective defences. 
Hernandez holds the ball up well and slips it to Kroos who sprays a trademark 
diagonal to Ronaldo. Cristiano turns on the burners, and races to within 
shooting range before unleashing… it’s blocked by Cabral (with his arm?!) and 
the ball breaks to Isco. Sergio is out of his goal but he’s able to shepherd 
Isco away from goal, and the Real move fizzles out!

52 min: This is all Celta! Real haven’t got going yet, and they’re being 
constantly outbattled in the middle of the pitch. Orellana makes another break 
and shoots from the edge of the box, but it’s easy for Casillas. Casillas pumps 
it long as he tries to find Hernandez on the break, but Jonny pulls him down 
cynically. Booked.

50 min: Krohn-Dehli looks to have picked the pocket of Kroos to set up yet 
another Celta attack but the Danish midfielder is pulled back for a foul. It’s 
probably the wrong decision by the referee, and Orellana lets him know about it 
in no uncertain terms. Yellow card for dissent.

49 min: Mina tries his luck with a crafty lob after racing through. Varane was 
catching the Celta man who took his shot early but it sailed wide. It was an 
ambitious effort from the youngster, Mina is just 19 remember!

47 min: Carvajal has had a torrid game, Orellana is the latest to sail past 
the Real right-back, cutting in from the left. The Chilean tries the same trick 
on Ramos but it doesn’t work and the ball breaks to Augusto. Augusto could 
shoot, but he shifts it right to Mallo who tries his luck from a narrow angle, 
but the ball flies over the bar. Good start from Celta, they’ve lost none of 
their attacking verve from the first half. But can they tighten it up at the 
back?

This was the flick that Isco produced to release Ronaldo in the build up to 
Real’s third goal. Woof.

“I’ve seen Isco on three occasions at the UEFA Euro U-21s two years ago,” 
claims Philip Podolsky, “and, along with Thiago Alcantara, he made everybody 
else look clumsy amateurs. Like you said, he’s got that whole Baggio/Iniesta 
glide thing going on, plus he’s a supreme athlete and a deadly finisher. An 
all-time-great in the making IMO.”

What a suckerpunch for Celta before half-time. They have played so well going 
forward but have looked overexposed at the back, Jonny in particular at 
left-back. Isco wins the ball on the half-way line, flicks it to Ronaldo who 
cuts inside, and with Celta caught up the pitch, Rodriguez is completely 
unmarked on Real’s right. The Colombian duly receives a pass to feet, cuts back 
inside on his favoured left and shoots. It’s on target, but a massive 
deflection takes is away from a helpless Sergio. There was nothing that the 
keeper could do! Real lead!

GOAL! Celta Vigo 2-3 Real Madrid (Rodriguez 43)

It will go down as Rodriguez’s goal, but this takes a huge deflection off

41 min: Ronaldo hits the post! Hernandez takes down a long ball with instant 
control and releases Ronaldo, who times his run to perfection to break clear of 
the defence. The pass is perhaps a little heavy, and Ronaldo is forced wide, 
but he sends his shot towards the far post. It hits it full and bounces out: 
Real do not get the same luck that Celta received earlier!

39 min: Nolito is continuing to torment Carvajal on that left-hand side, 
turning the Real man inside in. Illarramendi gets back to give his teammate 
some support, but Nolito lays the ball back to Krohn-Dehli to shoot from range… 
excellent block from Ramos! The man knows no fear.

36 min: Neither midfield has really stamped its authority on the game. 
Illarramendi has done a pretty poor job of protecting his back four. Orellana 
is being given the freedom of the field at present. He finds Larrivey again, 
whose first touch is little heavy, but he gets his shot off. Casillas saves 
easily.

33 min: Blood is continuing to seep through Larrivey’s swimming cap and onto 
his light blue shirt, so there’s a small break in play so the striker can 
replace his jersey.

30 min: Isco’s footwork … my word. I’ll admit this MBM is in danger of turning 
into a bit of a love in for the Spaniard, but you just have to marvel at his 
balance: caressing the ball with his instep and then rolling it round his 
markers with the sole of his boot. Majestic.

Real’s lead lasted just four minutes! The standard of defending in this match 
has been er, questionable, but we don’t mind: it’s raining goals! Real’s 
defence is unlocked with just one pass, splitting the defence and Mina races 
clear: he’s one-on-one with Casillas and squeezes a shot low, but it hits the 
post. Initially it looks as thought Marcelo is going to clean up the rebound 
but he’s thrown off balance, and Mina is there to tap home his own rebound. 2-2!

He started the game brightly, and Hernandez has got his goal. Coming deep to 
collect the ball from Isco, he turns his man well, plays a one-two with 
Rodriguez and fires low under the onrushing Sergio. It was a narrow angle but 
he never looked like missing. His trademark smile flashes across his face. What 
a cutie.

22 min: Ooooo nasty clash of heads, as Ramos and Larrivey come together. It’s 
the Celta man who comes off worse, and he is forced to come off to receive 
treatment. He’s back on his feet though and returns to the field wearing a 
swimming cap in order to stem the flow of blood! Tom Daley eat your heart out.

This is brilliant from Ronaldo. The Portuguese picks the ball up wide and 
dribbles to the byline as though his life depends on it. Celta’s defence can’t 
live with him, and he ghosts past Mallo before cutting the ball back across the 
face of goal. It is half-cleared, but the ball breaks kindly to Kroos on the 
edge of the area, and the German side-foots it into the corner! Ancelotti 
visibly looks relieved on the sideline!

11 min: Can Real muster a response? John McEnerney certainly thinks so on the 
email.

“Evening Michael, Real may make hard work of this one tonight but they should 
win. They’ll be on a high after avoiding FCB & Bayern in the CL, they’ve been 
showing flashes of the early season form recently that made them Winter 
Champions(pure malarkey). Carlo is out at the end of the season no matter what 
happens which is a shame, he’s one of the best around & has the trophies to 
prove it. He’d be better off kicking back for a while after Chelsea, PSG & Real 
you’d need a break from mad presidents/owners & players(Zlatan). He’d be nuts 
to take the MCFC job. The Italian FA might give him a call! Going back to AC 
wouldn’t be the worst idea he’d have a few years to get them back to a 
respectable level in European football jaysus they’ve gone to the dogs along 
with most of Serie A. Enjoy it.”

Do we have an upset on the cards? Nolito picks the ball off Jonny, and drives 
into the area from the left flank. Carvajal is completely flat-footed as Nolito 
drives inside him, and his nifty footwork also avoids the backtracking Kroos 
and the advancing Ramos. One more touch to steady himself, and yes! His shot 
finds the bottom corner, just inside the near post. What a goal, beating three 
players!

Keep your eye on Nolito tonight. He scored Celta’s winner last week at Eibar 
and has been a dangerous threat on the left flank all season, earning his first 
cap for Spain in November after inspiringCelta to victory at Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/01/barcelona-celta-vigo-la-liga-match-report>
. If you want to learn a bit more about the 28-year-old, you could do worse than
read this from Sid Lowe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/03/celta-vigo-nolito-jonny-castro-luis-suarez-lionel-messi-barcelona-la-liga>
:

The first time Nolito got noticed was eight years ago when he was 20 and 
playing for tiny Second Division B side Écija. Écija drew with thegalácticos in 
the Copa del Rey and he scored the goal. The following morning, the headline on 
the front cover of Marca ran: “Not Beckham, not Ronaldo, not Reyes, not 
Robinho: Golito de Nolito.” And there he was, standing by the local news stand, 
reading all about it. Everyone else was reading about him, too. By the end of 
the season, Nolito joined Barcelona. This weekend, he was at it again. Nolito’s
golito, or little goal, had become a taconcito, or little backheel.

Not that it was easy. That was back in 2006. Nolito admits that he was not 
really ready for the move to Barcelona – he was big for a start – and he has 
had to leave to return in triumph. His has not been a smooth progression. It 
has taken eight years to get here and he has not travelled the most direct 
route.

Nolito is from Sanlúcar, in Cádiz in the south of Spain, where funny comes as 
standard and the cliche is of fantasy footballers, entertainers who are in it 
for the kicks. Listening to him talk, complete with whistling and jokes and 
giggling pottymouth, sprinkled with host bread and milk, it is hard not to like 
him. Watching him play on the left of a front three, his game sprinkled with 
touch and vision, speed and skill, it is hard not to like him, too.

Nolito admits that structured football, the pressure of competition, was not 
always his thing and yet he has worked extremely hard to be where he is; there 
has been resistance as well as brilliance. “There was a concrete fútbol sala 
court below my flat,” he told El País. “I joined a team but where I most played 
was down there. That’s been lost a bit. I would play there until 10 o’clock at 
night when they came and dragged me home. My memories of it as a kid was that 
it was always full. Now there are mobiles and consoles and computers. I go home 
I see it empty and it makes me sad. I go and watch kids play now and I see 
parents shouting at them, and I think: ‘Leave your kid alone! You think he’s 
Maradona. They’re there to enjoy themselves. You’re demanding 20 goals and four 
overhead kicks from them.’”

At 13, Nolito was working in a butchers’; at 16 he went to Valencia and back, 
not yet ready for the professional game; he joined third division Sanluqueño at 
19 and at 20 he eclipsed Madrid’s galaxy with Écija, when he wasn’t even 
playing that often. Barcelona B came for him the following year and he shone 
with Luis Enrique but first-team opportunities were limited. He played only 
twice in 2010-11, even as he starred for Barcelona B. Pep Guardiola wanted him 
to stay, insisting he “completely deserves” an opportunity in the first team, 
while coaching staff said he was “a bullet”. But it changed little. “If I was 
20, maybe, but I’m 24 now,” Nolito said. “I’m realistic: we have the best 
forwards in the world [ahead of me].”

A season at Benfica followed, with 11 goals in 29 games, and then a loan at 
Granada; the risk of him heading backwards lingered. Luis Enrique then brought 
him to Celta and last season he was superb, scoring 14 times. And that was 
despite Luis Enrique leaving him out of the starting lineup during an 
eight-week chunk of the season – a decision that Nolito admits was absolutely 
right. Now he is under different management and it is still working; in fact, 
Berizzo’s variation on a similar style may suit him even better and playing 
alongside Larrivey, signed from Rayo, certainly does. “They’re different but 
don’t ask me how … I haven’t got a clue about management,” he says.

Perhaps the surprise is that he is still there at all. In the summer, there 
was the chance to go to England; a huge contract was placed before him. “So why 
didn’t you?” Nolito was asked this during an interview on Al Primer Toque radio 
show last week. “Because it’s cold, it rains a lot and the food’s bad,” he 
replied. “Besides,” he added, “I’m happy here. Why would I change? I earn 
enough money. My family is poor [originally], I’m poor [originally], and I’m 
happy with what I’ve got. What do I need more for? Greed rips the bag.”

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti talked about Isco and Hernandez in the pre-match 
press conference:

It’s not normal when that frustration causes you to react poorly on the pitch 
though. It’s worrying if your frustration causes you to drop off in training. 
That hasn’t been the case with either Isco or Chicharito.

It’s healthy for the squad to have players who are fighting for a place and 
working hard and diligently. Chicharito is a good example of that, he hasn’t 
played much but because of his professionalism he was ready when it mattered.

The Italian confirmed that Hernandez’s future would be deciding in the summer. 
With Benzema out, this is another big chance for the Mexican to impress,
following his heroics in midweek against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League

Preamble

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but one gets the feeling that 
Madrid are one wrong result away from gifting the La Liga title to Barcelona. 
Should Real slip up atCelta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> tonight, you would expect 
Barcelona to become champions: the only remaining match that one would think 
the Catalan could drop points is at Atlético Madrid on 17 May. Should Real lose 
tonight, or even draw, Barcelona could afford to lose that match at Atléti and 
still win the title. Got that? Good.

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but they do have injuries to a 
number of important players: Luka Modric is out for six weeks due to knee 
ligament strain, Gareth Bale is out with a calf problem sustained last week 
against Malaga, and Karim Benzema has nagging knee knack. That’s two third of 
BBC! Imagine just having C against the mighty Celta Vigo!Oh, wait…  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/06/real-madrid-celta-vigo-la-liga-match-report>

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but one of their best players 
this season, Isco, ain’t all that happy. “I am more than hurt, so I’m not very 
happy,” he said this week. See, told you. Having played out of his skin earlier 
this season, Isco has spent large portions of recent weeks on the bench, with 
Carlo Ancelotti preferring James Rodriguez in his three-man midfield alongside 
Toni Kroos and Modric. Thing is, Isco is quite good at football, something that 
the Real fans that watch him every week (until recently) seem to have figured 
out. In February, Iker Casillas called him “the most important player for the 
future of Spanish football.” He’s a bonafide fans (and my personal) favourite, 
and with good reason: one of those players that seems utterly in control of 
everything he does. He always seems to have time on the ball, a preposterously 
low centre of gravity, is two-footed, a languid velvet style that seems as 
though he is gliding (with a deceptive turn of pace) rather than running around 
the pitch. Chess Grandmasters often claim to be able to see dozens of moves 
ahead in their matches, and you get the sense Isco always already knows what he 
is going to do before the ball arrives at his feet, which seem to have the 
touch of a well-worn baseball glove lined with velcro. Aged just 23, he’s 
coming into his prime: Real would be fools to let someone of his ilk leave but 
they’ve done it before to players that are not consideredgalácticos, and given 
the right offer, they could do it again in the summer. Here’s to hoping they 
won’t. With the injury to Modric, Isco will start for Real tonight against 
Celta to make his 100th appearance for the club. Here’s hoping we catch a 
glimpse of some of theISCO DISCO tonight…

Kick off: 9pm in Vigo, 8pm in London

close  
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> march on, and 
are just two points behind Barcelona at the top of La Liga, but they were lucky 
here. Both teams’ defending was suicidal, which made for a thrilling game, and 
a hatful of chances. Ultimately Real’s players showed their quality in 
finishing those opportunities – Hernandez in particular – but Celta can feel 
aggrieved that they didn’t get the rub of the green from the referee.

Isco didn’t have the best game, but he did whip out a spinning roulette pass 
to set up Real’s third goal, so at least we can hang our collective hats on 
that. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!
 
Carlo Ancelotti breathes a sigh of relief.
 
90+2 min: With their six at the back, Real are popping it about, as the clock 
counts down. They’ve definitely got away with one here, and but for a couple of 
lucky bounces, and a couple of decisions in their favour, could well have lost. 
As it is, they are still in the title race.
 
90 min: Three minutes added for injury time.
 
89 min: Krohn-Dehli and Carvajal are both shown a yellow card for dissent, 
with Real angry at the fact that Celta didn’t kick the ball out of play so that 
Kroos could receive treatment. The German appeared to jar his knee in a 
challenge with Bongonda. Carvajal will also now miss the next match, which 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing, based upon tonight’s performance.
 
87 min: Nolito has been a constant menace tonight, he is a definite contender 
to be man-of-the-match along with Hernandez. He is very one-footed though, and 
Varane should know that he will want to cut back on his right. Nolito does 
exactly that, but flashes his shot wide.

@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> my 4 year old could 
slot into reals Dfence the way they r playin tonight. Where do u think Nolito 
will be next season?

<https://twitter.com/KukuAgamiCPH/status/592424085398884353> 
I would love to see him in England, I think his direct approach in the final 
third and the way he commits defenders would really suit the Premier League. 
Looks to have the physique for it, too. Perhaps a club like Southampton?
 
85 min: Real make their final change, Arbeloa on for Rodriguez. Real now have 
six defenders, two midfielders and two attackers on the field!
 
84 min: Ramos is booked for going in late on Celta’s Hernandez. That’s 10 
yellow cards for the season now, so he will be suspended for Real’s match 
against Almeria on Wednesday.
 
82 min: Real make another sub: Jesé on for Isco.
 
81 min: The tempo of the match has gone out of the game since Orellana and 
Mina went off. That will suit Real fine, Ronaldo is happy simply to play 
keep-ball. The Portuguese has been booed all night by the Celta fans.
 
79 min: Another decision goes against Celta, Berizzo is furious on the 
touchline: Nolito cutting in off his left and going down under the challenge of 
Carvajal. It’s a poor tackle but the referee waives play on. Lucky Carvajal, 
he’s had a poor match, and Porto’s Danilo, who is due to join Real in the 
summer, will be watching this with glee.
 
77 min: Krohn-Dehli is again harshly penalised for a challenge on Carvajal. 
Celta definitely haven’t got the run of the decisions tonight. The rejection of 
that penalty claim when the score just before the hour mark is looking costly 
for the home side.
 
74 min: Celta’s final change: Hernandez replaces Mina. Looks like damage 
limitation from Celta, they’ve taken off two of their best players tonight!
 
72 min: More subs, as Larrivey is replaced by Charles, which is presumably to 
protect the former, whose head wound is STILL bleeding. Pepe, meanwhile comes 
on for… Hernandez! So the Mexican won’t get his hat-trick, but he’s a real team 
player and smiles as he jogs up the pitch, before lapping up the high-fives on 
the bench. Real now playing five at the back.
 
70 min: Celta make their first change: Orellana coming off for Bongonda. 
That’s surprising to me, the Chilean has arguably been Celta’s best player!

“Celta/RM: slightly more interesting than Arsenal/Chelsea” suggests Mark 
Turner. Erm, yep.
 
Celta have magnificent going forward tonight, but shocking at the back. Ramos 
is allowed to walk the ball out of defence, and entering Celta half, he has 
time to pick his pass with the outside of his foot, deliciously lifting it into 
the path of Hernandez, who takes one touch and calmly finishes past Sergio with 
a sidefoot shot. Game over?

It’s that man again!
 
66 min: For the first time in the match, Real seem to have found a decent 
defensive shape, with Isco playing a little deeper, and Rodriguez tucking in on 
the right. They need it too, they’ve had just 45% possession so far!
 
64 min: Larrivey is having his head wound cleaned yet again. Celta are a man 
light, but continue to attack, winning a throw in high up the pitch.
 
62 min: Chance for Hernandez! Real are sitting back, which is causing them 
problems, but they continue to look dangerous in hitting Celta on the break: 
Ronaldo sprints down the right, lays the ball across the box to Hernandez but 
the Mexican misses at the far post. The pass from Ronaldo was probably a little 
heavy in truth, but Hernandez still should have done better with his left foot, 
or taken a touch back onto his right.
 
59 min: Nolito is continuing his roasting of Carvajal, stepping over the ball, 
leaving the right-back for dead and coasting into the area. Illarramendi slides 
in to cover, but he can only clear for a corner. It’s whipped into the six-yard 
box, pinballs off various heels and knees, and somehow is cleared. Real are 
living very dangerously here, they desperately need to make a tactical change.
 
57 min: Surely a penalty for Celta! Oh, that’s as clearcut as you’re ever 
likely to see: Kroos clattering into Orellana from behind. How the referee 
doesn’t give that is beyond me.
 
54 min: This is end to end stuff, the tempo of this game is relentless. Both 
Celta and Real are attacking with little regard for their respective defences. 
Hernandez holds the ball up well and slips it to Kroos who sprays a trademark 
diagonal to Ronaldo. Cristiano turns on the burners, and races to within 
shooting range before unleashing… it’s blocked by Cabral (with his arm?!) and 
the ball breaks to Isco. Sergio is out of his goal but he’s able to shepherd 
Isco away from goal, and the Real move fizzles out!
 
52 min: This is all Celta! Real haven’t got going yet, and they’re being 
constantly outbattled in the middle of the pitch. Orellana makes another break 
and shoots from the edge of the box, but it’s easy for Casillas. Casillas pumps 
it long as he tries to find Hernandez on the break, but Jonny pulls him down 
cynically. Booked.
 
50 min: Krohn-Dehli looks to have picked the pocket of Kroos to set up yet 
another Celta attack but the Danish midfielder is pulled back for a foul. It’s 
probably the wrong decision by the referee, and Orellana lets him know about it 
in no uncertain terms. Yellow card for dissent.
 
49 min: Mina tries his luck with a crafty lob after racing through. Varane was 
catching the Celta man who took his shot early but it sailed wide. It was an 
ambitious effort from the youngster, Mina is just 19 remember!
 
47 min: Carvajal has had a torrid game, Orellana is the latest to sail past 
the Real right-back, cutting in from the left. The Chilean tries the same trick 
on Ramos but it doesn’t work and the ball breaks to Augusto. Augusto could 
shoot, but he shifts it right to Mallo who tries his luck from a narrow angle, 
but the ball flies over the bar. Good start from Celta, they’ve lost none of 
their attacking verve from the first half. But can they tighten it up at the 
back?
 
Peeep! We’re off again! Neither side makes any substitutions. 
 
This was the flick that Isco produced to release Ronaldo in the build up to 
Real’s third goal. Woof.

“I’ve seen Isco on three occasions at the UEFA Euro U-21s two years ago,” 
claims Philip Podolsky, “and, along with Thiago Alcantara, he made everybody 
else look clumsy amateurs. Like you said, he’s got that whole Baggio/Iniesta 
glide thing going on, plus he’s a supreme athlete and a deadly finisher. An 
all-time-great in the making IMO.”
 
A breathless first-half!
 
45 min: One minute added on here. I’m surprised that there hasn’t been more 
time added just for the five goal celebrations we’ve had in this half!
 
What a suckerpunch for Celta before half-time. They have played so well going 
forward but have looked overexposed at the back, Jonny in particular at 
left-back. Isco wins the ball on the half-way line, flicks it to Ronaldo who 
cuts inside, and with Celta caught up the pitch, Rodriguez is completely 
unmarked on Real’s right. The Colombian duly receives a pass to feet, cuts back 
inside on his favoured left and shoots. It’s on target, but a massive 
deflection takes is away from a helpless Sergio. There was nothing that the 
keeper could do! Real lead!
 
It will go down as Rodriguez’s goal, but this takes a huge deflection off 
Fontas!

41 min: Ronaldo hits the post! Hernandez takes down a long ball with instant 
control and releases Ronaldo, who times his run to perfection to break clear of 
the defence. The pass is perhaps a little heavy, and Ronaldo is forced wide, 
but he sends his shot towards the far post. It hits it full and bounces out: 
Real do not get the same luck that Celta received earlier!
 
39 min: Nolito is continuing to torment Carvajal on that left-hand side, 
turning the Real man inside in. Illarramendi gets back to give his teammate 
some support, but Nolito lays the ball back to Krohn-Dehli to shoot from range… 
excellent block from Ramos! The man knows no fear.
 
36 min: Neither midfield has really stamped its authority on the game. 
Illarramendi has done a pretty poor job of protecting his back four. Orellana 
is being given the freedom of the field at present. He finds Larrivey again, 
whose first touch is little heavy, but he gets his shot off. Casillas saves 
easily.
 
33 min: Blood is continuing to seep through Larrivey’s swimming cap and onto 
his light blue shirt, so there’s a small break in play so the striker can 
replace his jersey.
 
30 min: Isco’s footwork … my word. I’ll admit this MBM is in danger of turning 
into a bit of a love in for the Spaniard, but you just have to marvel at his 
balance: caressing the ball with his instep and then rolling it round his 
markers with the sole of his boot. Majestic.

Real’s lead lasted just four minutes! The standard of defending in this match 
has been er, questionable, but we don’t mind: it’s raining goals! Real’s 
defence is unlocked with just one pass, splitting the defence and Mina races 
clear: he’s one-on-one with Casillas and squeezes a shot low, but it hits the 
post. Initially it looks as thought Marcelo is going to clean up the rebound 
but he’s thrown off balance, and Mina is there to tap home his own rebound. 2-2!
 With Marcelo helpess on the ground, Mina smashes in the rebound to tie the 
match at 2-2. Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images  
It’s all going off in Vigo!
 
He started the game brightly, and Hernandez has got his goal. Coming deep to 
collect the ball from Isco, he turns his man well, plays a one-two with 
Rodriguez and fires low under the onrushing Sergio. It was a narrow angle but 
he never looked like missing. His trademark smile flashes across his face. What 
a cutie.
 
Chicharitooooo!

22 min: Ooooo nasty clash of heads, as Ramos and Larrivey come together. It’s 
the Celta man who comes off worse, and he is forced to come off to receive 
treatment. He’s back on his feet though and returns to the field wearing a 
swimming cap in order to stem the flow of blood! Tom Daley eat your heart out.

19 min: Hernandez is posing a real threat in behind. His pace is worrying 
Celta, who are dropping increasingly deeper.
 
This is brilliant from Ronaldo. The Portuguese picks the ball up wide and 
dribbles to the byline as though his life depends on it. Celta’s defence can’t 
live with him, and he ghosts past Mallo before cutting the ball back across the 
face of goal. It is half-cleared, but the ball breaks kindly to Kroos on the 
edge of the area, and the German side-foots it into the corner! Ancelotti 
visibly looks relieved on the sideline!
 
And there it is!

Doyle/Getty Images  
11 min: Can Real muster a response? John McEnerney certainly thinks so on the 
email.

“Evening Michael, Real may make hard work of this one tonight but they should 
win. They’ll be on a high after avoiding FCB & Bayern in the CL, they’ve been 
showing flashes of the early season form recently that made them Winter 
Champions(pure malarkey). Carlo is out at the end of the season no matter what 
happens which is a shame, he’s one of the best around & has the trophies to 
prove it. He’d be better off kicking back for a while after Chelsea, PSG & Real 
you’d need a break from mad presidents/owners & players(Zlatan). He’d be nuts 
to take the MCFC job. The Italian FA might give him a call! Going back to AC 
wouldn’t be the worst idea he’d have a few years to get them back to a 
respectable level in European football jaysus they’ve gone to the dogs along 
with most of Serie A. Enjoy it.”
 
Do we have an upset on the cards? Nolito picks the ball off Jonny, and drives 
into the area from the left flank. Carvajal is completely flat-footed as Nolito 
drives inside him, and his nifty footwork also avoids the backtracking Kroos 
and the advancing Ramos. One more touch to steady himself, and yes! His shot 
finds the bottom corner, just inside the near post. What a goal, beating three 
players!
 
It’s that man Nolito! What did we say?!
 
7 min: Ronaldo races down the right. He shimmies left and then right and earns 
a cheap corner. Headed well away by Cabral.
 
3 min: Real settling into their rhythm, controlling possession. Celta are 
pressing high up the pitch to good effect, with Isco and then Kroos barged off 
the ball.
 
Peeep peeep! We’re off!
 
Celta Vigo are in good form, and have won three and drawn one of their last 
five matches; their only defeat coming at home to Barcelona 1-0. Here come the 
teams!
 
Keep your eye on Nolito tonight. He scored Celta’s winner last week at Eibar 
and has been a dangerous threat on the left flank all season, earning his first 
cap for Spain in November after inspiringCelta to victory at Barcelona

read this from Sid Lowe

:

The first time Nolito got noticed was eight years ago when he was 20 and 
playing for tiny Second Division B side Écija. Écija drew with thegalácticos in 
the Copa del Rey and he scored the goal. The following morning, the headline on 
the front cover of Marca ran: “Not Beckham, not Ronaldo, not Reyes, not 
Robinho: Golito de Nolito.” And there he was, standing by the local news stand, 
reading all about it. Everyone else was reading about him, too. By the end of 
the season, Nolito joined Barcelona. This weekend, he was at it again. Nolito’s
golito, or little goal, had become a taconcito, or little backheel.

Not that it was easy. That was back in 2006. Nolito admits that he was not 
really ready for the move to Barcelona – he was big for a start – and he has 
had to leave to return in triumph. His has not been a smooth progression. It 
has taken eight years to get here and he has not travelled the most direct 
route.

Nolito is from Sanlúcar, in Cádiz in the south of Spain, where funny comes as 
standard and the cliche is of fantasy footballers, entertainers who are in it 
for the kicks. Listening to him talk, complete with whistling and jokes and 
giggling pottymouth, sprinkled with host bread and milk, it is hard not to like 
him. Watching him play on the left of a front three, his game sprinkled with 
touch and vision, speed and skill, it is hard not to like him, too.

Nolito admits that structured football, the pressure of competition, was not 
always his thing and yet he has worked extremely hard to be where he is; there 
has been resistance as well as brilliance. “There was a concrete fútbol sala 
court below my flat,” he told El País. “I joined a team but where I most played 
was down there. That’s been lost a bit. I would play there until 10 o’clock at 
night when they came and dragged me home. My memories of it as a kid was that 
it was always full. Now there are mobiles and consoles and computers. I go home 
I see it empty and it makes me sad. I go and watch kids play now and I see 
parents shouting at them, and I think: ‘Leave your kid alone! You think he’s 
Maradona. They’re there to enjoy themselves. You’re demanding 20 goals and four 
overhead kicks from them.’”

At 13, Nolito was working in a butchers’; at 16 he went to Valencia and back, 
not yet ready for the professional game; he joined third division Sanluqueño at 
19 and at 20 he eclipsed Madrid’s galaxy with Écija, when he wasn’t even 
playing that often. Barcelona B came for him the following year and he shone 
with Luis Enrique but first-team opportunities were limited. He played only 
twice in 2010-11, even as he starred for Barcelona B. Pep Guardiola wanted him 
to stay, insisting he “completely deserves” an opportunity in the first team, 
while coaching staff said he was “a bullet”. But it changed little. “If I was 
20, maybe, but I’m 24 now,” Nolito said. “I’m realistic: we have the best 
forwards in the world [ahead of me].”

A season at Benfica followed, with 11 goals in 29 games, and then a loan at 
Granada; the risk of him heading backwards lingered. Luis Enrique then brought 
him to Celta and last season he was superb, scoring 14 times. And that was 
despite Luis Enrique leaving him out of the starting lineup during an 
eight-week chunk of the season – a decision that Nolito admits was absolutely 
right. Now he is under different management and it is still working; in fact, 
Berizzo’s variation on a similar style may suit him even better and playing 
alongside Larrivey, signed from Rayo, certainly does. “They’re different but 
don’t ask me how … I haven’t got a clue about management,” he says.

Perhaps the surprise is that he is still there at all. In the summer, there 
was the chance to go to England; a huge contract was placed before him. “So why 
didn’t you?” Nolito was asked this during an interview on Al Primer Toque radio 
show last week. “Because it’s cold, it rains a lot and the food’s bad,” he 
replied. “Besides,” he added, “I’m happy here. Why would I change? I earn 
enough money. My family is poor [originally], I’m poor [originally], and I’m 
happy with what I’ve got. What do I need more for? Greed rips the bag.”
 
Real manager Carlo Ancelotti talked about Isco and Hernandez in the pre-match 
press conference:

It’s not normal when that frustration causes you to react poorly on the pitch 
though. It’s worrying if your frustration causes you to drop off in training. 
That hasn’t been the case with either Isco or Chicharito.

It’s healthy for the squad to have players who are fighting for a place and 
working hard and diligently. Chicharito is a good example of that, he hasn’t 
played much but because of his professionalism he was ready when it mattered.

The Italian confirmed that Hernandez’s future would be deciding in the summer. 
With Benzema out, this is another big chance for the Mexican to impress,
following his heroics in midweek against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but one gets the feeling that 
Madrid are one wrong result away from gifting the La Liga title to Barcelona. 
Should Real slip up atCelta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> tonight, you would expect 
Barcelona to become champions: the only remaining match that one would think 
the Catalan could drop points is at Atlético Madrid on 17 May. Should Real lose 
tonight, or even draw, Barcelona could afford to lose that match at Atléti and 
still win the title. Got that? Good.

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but they do have injuries to a 
number of important players: Luka Modric is out for six weeks due to knee 
ligament strain, Gareth Bale is out with a calf problem sustained last week 
against Malaga, and Karim Benzema has nagging knee knack. That’s two third of 
BBC! Imagine just having C against the mighty Celta Vigo!Oh, wait…

REAL MADRID ARE IN CRISIS! Not really, reader, but one of their best players 
this season, Isco, ain’t all that happy. “I am more than hurt, so I’m not very 
happy,” he said this week. See, told you. Having played out of his skin earlier 
this season, Isco has spent large portions of recent weeks on the bench, with 
Carlo Ancelotti preferring James Rodriguez in his three-man midfield alongside 
Toni Kroos and Modric. Thing is, Isco is quite good at football, something that 
the Real fans that watch him every week (until recently) seem to have figured 
out. In February, Iker Casillas called him “the most important player for the 
future of Spanish football.” He’s a bonafide fans (and my personal) favourite, 
and with good reason: one of those players that seems utterly in control of 
everything he does. He always seems to have time on the ball, a preposterously 
low centre of gravity, is two-footed, a languid velvet style that seems as 
though he is gliding (with a deceptive turn of pace) rather than running around 
the pitch. Chess Grandmasters often claim to be able to see dozens of moves 
ahead in their matches, and you get the sense Isco always already knows what he 
is going to do before the ball arrives at his feet, which seem to have the 
touch of a well-worn baseball glove lined with velcro. Aged just 23, he’s 
coming into his prime: Real would be fools to let someone of his ilk leave but 
they’ve done it before to players that are not consideredgalácticos, and given 
the right offer, they could do it again in the summer. Here’s to hoping they 
won’t. With the injury to Modric, Isco will start for Real tonight against 
Celta to make his 100th appearance for the club. Here’s hoping we catch a 
glimpse of some of theISCO DISCO tonight…

Kick off: 9pm in Vigo, 8pm in London
