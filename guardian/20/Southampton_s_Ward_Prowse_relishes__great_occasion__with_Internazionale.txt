James Ward-Prowse believes Southampton have earned their Europa League home 
tie againstInternazionale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale> 
and challenged his team-mates to rise to the occasion. The 22-year-old came 
through the club’s academy before breaking into the first team when he made his 
debut in a League Cup tie in 2011.

Having been part of the club when they dropped down to League One in 2009‑10 
amid financial turmoil before then fighting their way back up to the top flight 
in 2012, Ward-Prowse knows full well what Thursday’s fixture will mean to 
everyone at St Mary’s. “It is going to be a great occasion. The club has worked 
incredibly hard for nights like this and we as players, the manager and staff 
want to be involved in games like this. A lot rests on the game, so bring it 
on,” he said.

“Having been at the club for a long time, obviously I have seen the growth of 
the club on and off the pitch. Being a player here, it is great to see the rise 
of the club and it was a great feeling at the San Siro. This is a great game 
against a European giant and we will be looking to make sure we come out on top.

“The fans stuck with the club through thick and thin, through the bad times 
and these are the good times now. A few of them would have been travelling to 
League One fixtures, and now we are hosting Inter Milan in theEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league>. We have a chance to 
qualify and hopefully they can get behind us to see us over the line.”
