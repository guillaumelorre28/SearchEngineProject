Melbourne Victory chalked up their fifth win on the trot with a clinical 2-0 
defeat of Adelaide United at Coopers Stadium.


James Troisi starred for the visitors with a goal and an assist, while bottom 
side Adelaide remain without a win since beating Wellington Phoenix on 4 
December.

Troisi was lively early on and set up Fahid Ben Khalfallah in the seventh 
minute with a through ball but the attack was thwarted by Tarek Elrich and 
Eugene Galekovic.


The Reds then had a couple of chances when Sergi Guardiola poked his shot past 
the upright in the 10th minute before Sergio Cirio also narrowly missed the 
target after a brilliant solo run.


With chances flowing at both ends, it took something special from 
Adelaide-born Troisi to break the deadlock on 22 minutes.


Leigh Broxham found plenty of space on the left flank and whipped in a cross 
which was only partially cleared, leaving Troisi to bend a first-time shot into 
the top corner from the edge of the box.


Besart Berisha had been quiet for much of the first half but would have 
doubled Victory’s lead with a close range header if not for a quick reflex save 
from Galekovic.


After the restart the intensity continued from both sides with the Reds 
pushing for an equaliser and one nearly came just after the hour when Isaias 
struck a superb free-kick from 25 metres only for it to rebound off the cross 
bar.

Three minutes later Troisi popped up again to dent any hopes of a United fight 
back, this time providing the assist. The Victory playmaker whipped in a free 
kick to the near post where Berisha was perfectly placed to place a powerful 
header into the bottom corner.

A late strike from Morten Nordstrand secured the Newcastle Jets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastle-jets> a 3-2 upset victory over 
Brisbane Roar earlier in the day.


In an action-packed contest at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday in which the lead 
changed hands three times, it appeared a draw was looming after an 82nd-minute 
penalty from striker Jamie Maclaren pulled Brisbane level.


But Danish import Nordstrand popped up just two minutes later to drive a 
dagger through the Roar’s hearts, standing his ground and firing from close 
range after an aerial contest with goalkeeper Michael Theo, who was 
yellow-carded for protesting the incident afterwards.


It was no less than what the Jets deserved after delivering one of the biggest 
shocks of theA-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> season so 
far.


It is the Roar’s first defeat in nearly 12 months at home, and came after 
Newcastle also smashed them 4-0 back in round two at McDonald Jones Stadium.


Tommy Oar’s first goal for Brisbane in more than seven years opened the scores 
after just 15 minutes, and they looked comfortable 1-0 up.


The Jets struck back right on the stroke of half-time, as Andrew Hoole 
dribbled his way through a flat-footed Roar defence and found the top corner 
with a rocket from 20 metres, stunning the crowd of 14,470.


Then in the 72nd minute, Newcastle’s other winger Andrew Nabbout made it 2-1, 
heading in a cross from full-back Jason Hoffman that caught a slight deflection 
off Jade North’s head along the way.


Brisbane thought they’d done enough to salvage at least a point when Maclaren 
scored his seventh goal of the season from the spot, after Nigel Boogaard 
brought down Jack Hingert in the penalty box with a clumsy challenge.


However, Nordstrand had the final say, pushing the Jets back into the top six 
and leaving the Roar in danger of losing touch with breakaway ladder leaders 
Sydney FC.


The Roar meet Victory next week at AAMI Park, while Newcastle are at home to 
Perth Glory.
