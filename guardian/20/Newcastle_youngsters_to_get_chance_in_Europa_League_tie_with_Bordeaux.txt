Newcastle United's flight to Bordeaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> was severely delayed on 
Wednesday due to snow on Tyneside but, with Alan Pardew's side already 
qualified for the Europa League's knockout stages, stress proved minimal.

A young side, featuring possibly as many as six academy graduates, is likely 
to be selected in south-west France on Thursday evening allowing senior players 
to rest before Monday's trip to Fulham.

Currently one point behind the Group D leaders, Bordeaux, Newcastle know 
victory could offer them an "easier" knockout draw but Pardew has said that 
finishing second and facing the prospect of meeting a team that has dropped 
down from the Champions League does not overly concern him.

Accordingly Demba Ba, Cheik Tioté and Davide Santon – who all suffered knocks 
during Monday's 3-0 win against Wigan – were among those first-team players 
left at home as Pardew offered places on the Bordeaux-bound flight to two 
reserves, Yven Moyo and Conor Newton, both of whom are still to make a 
first-team appearance. There was though still no place for Xisco, the club's 
unwanted but highly-paid Spanish striker.

While Tim Krul, Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Cissé are likely to be named on 
the bench, Nile Ranger – the striker Pardew not so long ago said would never 
play for Newcastle again following his documented brushs with the law – could 
start in attack.

Newcastle possible Elliot; Tavernier, Perch, Williamson, Ferguson; Anita, 
Bigirimina, Marveaux; Ranger, Shola Ameobi, Sammy Ameobi
