A League Two player has been banned for two years by the Football Association 
after failing a drugs test.

Gerard Kinsella, of Fleetwood Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fleetwood-town>, admitted an FA charge 
after a sample he gave in February contained the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.

The 21-year-old midfielder has been hit with a 24-month suspension, backdated 
to the date the sample was collected, and will be banned from football until 
February 2015.

An FA statement read: "Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, 
Fleetwood Town's Gerard Kinsella has been suspended from football and all 
football activities for two years, subject to any appeal, after he admitted an 
FA charge in relation to a breach of its anti-doping regulations.

"Kinsella was charged under FA Rule E25 for a breach of Regulation Three after 
he gave a sample following an out-of-competition test which contained the 
presence of a prohibited substance, namely Nandrolone, listed as an anabolic 
androgenic steroid in the 2013 Prohibited List of the World Anti-Doping Code.

"The player, who requested a personal hearing, will serve a 24-month 
suspension commencing 5 February 2013 (backdated to the date of sample 
collection) until 4 February 2015 [inclusive]."

Kinsella, who was on Everton's books as a youngster, signed for Fleetwood last 
summer but has yet to make a first-team appearance.

He did have a spell on loan with non-league Telford last season, playing seven 
games and scoring one goal.

A Fleetwood spokesman said: "Fleetwood Town will make a full statement about 
Gerard Kinsella in the fullness of time.

"The verdict has only recently been made public by the FA and we have no 
further comment at this stage."
