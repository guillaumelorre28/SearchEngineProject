Aitor Karanka claimed he was always confident Middlesbrough’s season would get 
back on track after theChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> leaders recorded a sixth 
successive win following his mini exile.

One month ago, the day before a third defeat in four against Charlton, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/13/charlton-athletic-middlesbrough-championship-match-report>
 Karanka failed to take training following a stormy meeting with his players 
that had threatened to derail their promotion campaign. He was not in the 
dugout for that defeat but, in the six fixtures since he returned, Boro have 
not dropped a point and two Jordan Rhodes goals, the second in stoppage time, 
earned them a 2-1 win over already-relegated Boltonon Saturday.

Rather than unsettling Karanka’s squad, the bust-up appears to have had a 
galvanising effect andMiddlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> will be within touching 
distance of the top flight should they defeat fellow high-fliers Burnley on 
Tuesday.

“We had lost games in January, February and March because we had players 
leaving and important players injured in difficult moments,” Karanka said.

“It was difficult to manage that situation and we lost games. Those games were 
games when we thought we were going to win easy. We lost those games, we made 
mistakes and we knew thatafter Hull – the most important part of the season 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/18/middlesbrough-hull-city-championship-match-report>
 – we had to be ready.

“One month ago I said I was much calmer than I was last season because I had a 
much better squad than I had last season; we are more mature, they are stronger 
and the fixtures are better than we had last season.”

It was the £9m signing of Rhodes from Blackburn Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/middlesbrough-jordan-rhodes-transfer-blackburn>
, and his role in Karanka’s system, that had caused some of the tension but the 
striker gave a timely reminder of his quality with a second-half double after 
Josh Vela gave Bolton the lead.

Rhodes had scored only twice in his previous 13 games at his new club, yet 
Karanka has kept an arm around the 26-year-old’s shoulder and never doubted his 
touch in front of goal would return.

“I told him after the game that a goalscorer can’t forget to score goals in 
two months,” Karanka said. “Always one day it would arrive that he would score 
goals and it was today – two important goals.

“I don’t think it’s been easy for him. He’s not a strong character, you can 
see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when 
you do your best and you’re unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting 
himself. Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the 
team.”

Bolton’s relegation fate had already been sealed with a 4-1 defeat at Derby 
last weekend but they showed more spirit against a club now 59 points above 
them in the table.

The interim manager, Jimmy Phillips, wants that performance to be the 
benchmark in their final four encounters. “That’s got to be the case from now 
until the end of the season,” he said. “We encourage players to get on the 
ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, 
because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive 
edge and defensive shape.

“There’s still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve 
better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set 
the players up for next season for those that are going to be here.”
