Heaven 17



It’s not exactly hidden but if you go up to the Heaven 17 bar at the Gothia 
Towers Hotel, order a king size. It is a huge pile of prawns with mayonnaise 
and egg on a great piece of rye bread. It tastes of the sea and happiness. 
Accompanied by a local brewed beer, you have a bit of magic. Also, the views of 
the city at night cannot be beat.

Canal tour

The canals evoke a Scandinavian Amsterdam, softened by steamy cafes that could 
almost be in Vienna. Only when you tuck into wintry-white seafood, served by 
statuesque blondes, do you remember you’re in Sweden. Try a Paddan canal boat 
tour, which sweeps under 20 bridges, including Osthyvel, the “cheese-slicer” 
bridge, which is so low you have to lie flat to pass underneath it. In winter, 
rugs are provided, along with gingerbread biscuits and steaming glögg – hot 
mulled wine.

Restaurant 2112

The city is well known for inventing the heavy metal genre of the Gothenburg 
Sound made famous by bands such as Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates and In 
Flames. Two members of the latter, Björn Gelotte and Peter Iwers, opened a high 
quality burger restaurant and bar called Restaurant 2112, named after thealbum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/06/rush-2112-deluxe-review> by 
Canadian rock band Rush. If you want to mingle with Gothenburg’s rock elite, or 
just sample the fine foods and beers, this is the place to go.

If you get a one-day or three-day ticket for Gothenburg’s public transport, 
you can do a tour on the ferry for free. Hop on and hop off as many times as 
you like or just stay on the ferry all the way through. On a sunny day, it’s a 
summer must-do!

An island north of Gothenburg, Marstrand is reached by bus or tour boats. The 
island has somewhat of a snobby reputation due to it being the centre of the 
sailing world in West Sweden, but it has good restaurants, cafes and boutique 
shops, and is a great place to walk or swim. Marstrand is also a must for 
discerning Abba fans, as the video forWinner Takes It All 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLd-P6lZMms> was filmed there.

The Feskekörka
 Feast at the Feskekörka Photograph: ideaswoman 

The “Fish Church”. Well, you have to, really, don’t you, just for the name. 
But oh, the fishy delights inside, from vast salads to fish pies, to take out 
and eat contentedly at the picnic tables outside or across the canal in the 
park. If you’re feeling in need of a more formal lunch, there’s a restaurant 
upstairs.

Botaniska trädgården (Gothenburg Botanical Garden)

With more than 170 hectares this is one of Europe’s largest gardens. The 
greenhouses have the largest collection of tropical orchids in Sweden, 
carnivorous plants and the rare Easter Island tree, which is extinct in its 
natural environment. A series of exhibitions are held in the greenhouses every 
year and the garden has a comprehensive schedule of activities all year round. 
The garden is close to the nature reserveÄnggårdsbergen 
<http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastragotaland/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/naturreservat/lanets-naturreservat/goteborg/anggardsbergen/Pages/index.aspx>
, where the scientific tree collection, the arboretum, is located. The 
Botanical Garden has two stars in the Michelin Green Guide and guided tours are 
arranged daily during the summer season.

To escape the hustle and bustle of the bars and clubs of Gothenburg, try a 
short journey south (less than an hour) to a beautiful beach at Askimsbadet, 
with its own official surf clubhouse as well.

As a frequent visitor to Gothenburg I soon heard of the food and wine at Bar 
Centro, located on a quiet back street. Apparently it is the place where chefs 
go on their nights off (always a good sign in my book). The enthusiastic staff 
serve dishes of the kind which you could expect from an osteria in Trastevere 
and the assortment of natural wines is nothing short of remarkable. A true gem!
