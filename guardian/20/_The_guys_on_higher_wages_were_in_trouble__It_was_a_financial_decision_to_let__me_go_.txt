Eddie Forrest, 23, has played for Stirling Albion, Airdrie and most recently 
Motherwell. He is a defender. Due to marry fiancee Denise next week. 
I wouldn't treat a dog the way I've been treated recently and I honestly don't 
know how the people who have put Scottish football in the kind of mess it's now 
in can sleep at night.

When I signed a three-year contract with Motherwell last summer I did so in 
good faith yet last week the interim administrator basically sacked me and 
offered me a one-off payment of £250.

I didn't even take the money because myself and the other lads sacked by the 
club are looking to take the whole matter further. As far as we can, in fact.

It can't be right to be able to tear up the remaining two years of a contract 
just like that and offer someone a couple of hundred pounds by way of 
compensation. We have to fight it.

It's been an unbelievable time for me and what makes it worse is that this is 
the second occasion I've been at a club that has gone into administration.

Now, on top of everything, last week Airdrie went completely bust and I am 
still owed £9,800 by them. I can't imagine I'll ever see that now but as a 
creditor I hope to get something back although it might only be 10p in the 
pound.

Scottish football is a shambles at the moment and with no TV money next season 
it can only get worse but that can't stop me from trying to get another club - 
either full-time or part-time. I signed on the dole for the first time on 
Friday and that was a culture shock but I have to get some money from somewhere.

I bought a house on the strength of my new Motherwell contract a few months 
ago and I'm getting married in less than two weeks. Fortunately the wedding and 
honeymoon in Malta is already paid for but I have a mortgage.
