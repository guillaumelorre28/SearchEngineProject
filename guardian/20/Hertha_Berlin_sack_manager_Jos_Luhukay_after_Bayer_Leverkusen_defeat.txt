Struggling Hertha Berlin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin> 
sacked Jos Luhukay on Thursday, a day after their 1-0 defeat to Bayer 
Leverkusen, a third straight loss that left them deep in relegation trouble.

The former Hertha player Pal Dardai, the reserve-team coach, will take over, 
assisted by Rainer Widmayer, the club said.

Hertha have lost five and won just one of their past seven league games and 
Wednesday’s defeat dropped them to 17th in the table, two points above 
last-placed Borussia Dortmund.

“Hertha part ways with coach Jos Luhukay with immediate effect,” the club said 
in a statement. “After analysing the current situation, the club decided on 
Thursday to also part ways with assistants Markus Gellhaus and Rob Reekers.“

The 51-year-old Dutchman took over Hertha after they were relegated to the 
second division in 2012 and helped them win promotion in his first season in 
charge. He is the fifthBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> manager to lose his 
job this season.
