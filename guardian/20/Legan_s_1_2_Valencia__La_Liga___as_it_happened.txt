Thanks for your company. To recap, Valencia went a goal down through 
Szymanowski but fought back through Nani, controversially, and Suarez. 
Szymanowski then missed a penalty – or rather, Alves saved – butValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> were a much slicker proposition 
after their equaliser. Two wins in a row now for Los Che. The fightback gathers 
pace! Enjoy the rest of your day.

That’s it! I think they deserved it, eventually.

90+4 min: Parejo has a chance to make it three, now, but his shot is blocked 
really well. Kone then breaks, and his cross is knocked down for Luciano ... 
but it’s cleared from ahead of him. Bakkali will now come on forValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in Nani’s stead, and then I 
fancy that’ll be it.

90+1 min: Leganes apply some pressure with a couple of long throws. Mantovani 
beats Mangala to flick one in the direction of goal, but it’s smuggled away 
after a mild panic forValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. 
Three added minutes here. Alberto Martin is booked now. Eight in total, not 
really been an especially dirty game though.

83 min: Kone has a chance there – Leganes aren’t dead yet. Great delivery from 
the right and the sub flicks it just over ... I think if he was an inch taller 
he’d have got the right purchase on that. At the other end, Rodrigo forces a 
fairly regulation save from Serantes with an angled strike.

81 min: Nani earns himself a yellow card – the game’s sixth and Valencia’s 
fourth – for quite needlessly clipping Ramos, who was going towards his own 
goal-line, down by the corner flag.

79 min: Medjani wins a header from a free-kick but a Leganes player is caught 
offside. Mangala, by the way, just entered the shot and I have to say he’s had 
a pretty convincing game so far.

72 min: Another Alves punch results in a chance. This time he made some 
purchase, to be fair, but straight to Luciano on the edge of the area and he 
drills *just* wide of the post.

Saved by Alves!

Justice done? Either way – Alves saves brilliantly and makes amends, diving to 
his right to fingertip Szymanowski’s spot kick away! That was an excellent

Penalty to Leganes!

Well! Szymanowski crosses from the left, it’s headed up into the air, Alves 
misses his punch and then is adjudged to have dragged Martin down. Looked 
soft...

57 min: Leganes have woken up; they’d become passive and Suarez’s goal has 
been a big jolt in a game they were well in control of until the equaliser. 
What areValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> like at 
hanging onto a lead? They’ve shown some good character here so far and don’t 
look like a relegation side.

54 min: How does Szymanowski not equalise there? It’s a carbon-copy of the 
goal he scored ... except it’s not a goal. He steals in again at the far post 
and it’s actually an easier chance – Montoya is nowhere and there’s no 
challenge. But he puts his free header high and wide. It really should have 
been 2-2 immediately.

Goal! Leganes 1-2 Valencia (Suarez 52)

And Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> take the lead! 
Nani takes a corner short and receives it back. He cuts inside, fizzes a low 
cross in and Suarez, poking out a leg, diverts the ball into the net. What a 
big goal that could be! Since equalising, they’ve deserved it.

50 min: And now Nani is down so the ball has been kicked out. Bit of a knock 
to the face, possibly, as he grapped for a cross but it doesn’t seem to have 
been much. Like Perez, he’ll be OK.

47 min: Sweeping early move from Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, which results in a Nani cross 
being cleared by Adrian. I wondered if he might have been better cutting the 
ball back for an onrushing team-mate there.

Half-time: Leganes 1-1 Valencia

And it’s the home side who are probably quite glad to hear the whistle. 
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, behind to a very good 
Szymanowski goal, equalised in controversial fashion through Nani and finished 
the first period well on top. I’ll see you right here again in 15.

44 min: Plenty of replays of the goal going around. And on the super slow-mo 
I’m inclined to stick with the conclusion that it was a foul by Rodrigo. It’s 
Rodrigo, now, who nods a right-sided cross down to the penalty spot but without 
a team-mate on hand.

Thanks for your company. To recap, Valencia went a goal down through 
Szymanowski but fought back through Nani, controversially, and Suarez. 
Szymanowski then missed a penalty – or rather, Alves saved – butValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> were a much slicker proposition 
after their equaliser. Two wins in a row now for Los Che. The fightback gathers 
pace! Enjoy the rest of your day.
 
That’s it! I think they deserved it, eventually.
 
90+4 min: Parejo has a chance to make it three, now, but his shot is blocked 
really well. Kone then breaks, and his cross is knocked down for Luciano ... 
but it’s cleared from ahead of him. Bakkali will now come on forValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in Nani’s stead, and then I 
fancy that’ll be it.
 
90+1 min: Leganes apply some pressure with a couple of long throws. Mantovani 
beats Mangala to flick one in the direction of goal, but it’s smuggled away 
after a mild panic forValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. 
Three added minutes here. Alberto Martin is booked now. Eight in total, not 
really been an especially dirty game though.
 
89 min: Can Leganes conjure one last chance? They’re at arm’s length at the 
moment. Looks to me as if that penalty miss and that controversial firstValencia
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> goal will be the two moments 
that tipped the scales here. Nani tries to add some gloss as I speak, drilling 
just wide.
 
87 min: Defensive change for Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. The big centre-back Aymen 
Abdennour replaces Rodrigo. No bones about that, they’re shutting this down.
 
86 min: Serantes claims a Parejo free-kick really well and looks to set his 
team away. They attack, but Parejo is back outside his own area to dispossess 
Kone.
 
84 min: Leganes introduce the Venezuelan forward Machis in place of Marin. 
Last throw of the dice.
 
83 min: Kone has a chance there – Leganes aren’t dead yet. Great delivery from 
the right and the sub flicks it just over ... I think if he was an inch taller 
he’d have got the right purchase on that. At the other end, Rodrigo forces a 
fairly regulation save from Serantes with an angled strike.
 
81 min: Nani earns himself a yellow card – the game’s sixth and Valencia’s 
fourth – for quite needlessly clipping Ramos, who was going towards his own 
goal-line, down by the corner flag.
 
79 min: Medjani wins a header from a free-kick but a Leganes player is caught 
offside. Mangala, by the way, just entered the shot and I have to say he’s had 
a pretty convincing game so far.
 
77 min: Leganes are looking a bit leggy. Leganes. Leggy. But they are, and 
it’s hard to see them forcing an equaliser at the moment unlessValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> make another mistake.
 
75 min: Staggering Diego Alves stat just reached my ears. He has saved 49% of 
penalties he has faced. The new Paul Cooper.
 
73 min: Then Nani blasts over from 20 yards. Wouldn’t bet against another goal 
here.
 
72 min: Another Alves punch results in a chance. This time he made some 
purchase, to be fair, but straight to Luciano on the edge of the area and he 
drills *just* wide of the post.
 
71 min: Kone can’t keep a reasonable ball in for Leganes, who will soon start 
to find they are running out of time.
 
69 min: And another chance, as Gaya flashes the ball across the face of goal 
when he should probably have hit the target.Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> now make a chance, bringing 
Munir on for Cancelo.
 
68 min: Chance for Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> on 
the counter! It’s Parejo, arriving late on edge of the box, who looks to place 
his shot above Serantes but the ‘keeper flips it over. A corner results, but 
that’s cleared.
 
67 min: Luciano and Alves have both been booked after a stand-off at a Valencia
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> free kick.
 
65 min: Well, perhaps that was Leganes’ big chance. But it also, arguably, 
told us something about the jitteriness at the heart ofValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. Leganes look to expose that 
again by making a change up front – Kone on for Guerrero.
 
Justice done? Either way – Alves saves brilliantly and makes amends, diving to 
his right to fingertip Szymanowski’s spot kick away! That was an excellent 
save, there wasn’t too much wrong with the kick itself.
 
Well! Szymanowski crosses from the left, it’s headed up into the air, Alves 
misses his punch and then is adjudged to have dragged Martin down. Looked 
soft...
 
59 min: The home side make a sub – off comes Unai Lopez and in his stead 
arrives the Brazilian Luciano.
 
57 min: Leganes have woken up; they’d become passive and Suarez’s goal has 
been a big jolt in a game they were well in control of until the equaliser. 
What areValencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> like at 
hanging onto a lead? They’ve shown some good character here so far and don’t 
look like a relegation side.
 
54 min: How does Szymanowski not equalise there? It’s a carbon-copy of the 
goal he scored ... except it’s not a goal. He steals in again at the far post 
and it’s actually an easier chance – Montoya is nowhere and there’s no 
challenge. But he puts his free header high and wide. It really should have 
been 2-2 immediately.
 
And Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> take the lead! 
Nani takes a corner short and receives it back. He cuts inside, fizzes a low 
cross in and Suarez, poking out a leg, diverts the ball into the net. What a 
big goal that could be! Since equalising, they’ve deserved it.
 
52 min: Mantovani, who has his hair died in Leganes’ blue and white – think 
Marc Bircham – is involved in something of a “discussion” with Perez before a 
home free-kick, which is floated in from deep and cleated.
 
50 min: And now Nani is down so the ball has been kicked out. Bit of a knock 
to the face, possibly, as he grapped for a cross but it doesn’t seem to have 
been much. Like Perez, he’ll be OK.
 
48 min: Perez is – again – down after being clipped by Timor, with whom he has 
had running battle at times. He’ll be OK.
 
47 min: Sweeping early move from Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, which results in a Nani cross 
being cleared by Adrian. I wondered if he might have been better cutting the 
ball back for an onrushing team-mate there.
 
Can Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> build on that bit 
of pre-break momentum?
 
And it’s the home side who are probably quite glad to hear the whistle. 
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, behind to a very good 
Szymanowski goal, equalised in controversial fashion through Nani and finished 
the first period well on top. I’ll see you right here again in 15.
 
44 min: Plenty of replays of the goal going around. And on the super slow-mo 
I’m inclined to stick with the conclusion that it was a foul by Rodrigo. It’s 
Rodrigo, now, who nods a right-sided cross down to the penalty spot but without 
a team-mate on hand.
