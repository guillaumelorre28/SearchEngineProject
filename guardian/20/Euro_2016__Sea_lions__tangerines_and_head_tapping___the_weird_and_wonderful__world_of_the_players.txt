Position Defender

Club Hamburg

Date of birth 18 January 1987

The centre-back moved to Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal from second division club 
Etoile Carouge at the age of 16 in 2004. He played only 86 league games during 
10 years at the north London club but was a respected member of the squad 
before joining Hamburg in 2014. There he has been mainly fighting relegation - 
as well as his team-mate Valon Behrami at half-time against Wolfsburg in April 
2015. He was born in the Ivory Coast as a result of his father’s extra-marital 
affair in 1986. Back in Switzerland, Joachim Djourou told his Swiss wife, 
Danièle, what had happened. Daniéle, however, did not react how one might 
expect and Johan Djourou told Blick in 2014: “My mum inSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> did not have any kids at the 
time and, while she was disappointed with what my dad had done, she forgave him 
and did not hesitate to adopt me.”

Position Forward

Club Chelsea

Date of birth 28 July 1987

Strong, fast and tireless but not on a rich run of form. When he made his 
debut for CD Raqui in Tenerife, where his father worked on a petrol station 
forecourt, Pedro’s nickname was “mascot” because of his size. He arrived at 
Barcelona in 2004 and made his first-team breakthrough four years later. The 
sports centre where he played as a boy is now called Pedro Rodríguez, and at 
the Canary Islands zoo he used to visit there’s a sea lion named Pedrito in his 
honour. In 2014 Pedro celebrated Pedrito’s birthday by taking him a cake 
covered in fish. He told the press: “Pedrito’s doing well.”

Position Defender

Club Tottenham Hotspur

Date of birth 24 April 1987

His decision to choose Tottenham over Arsenal four years ago raised more than 
a few eyebrows but given recent events in north London, Vertonghen can feel 
pretty smug. Having grown up with Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen at 
Ajax’s famed youth academy, the 29-year-old looked at home in Tottenham’s push 
for the Premier League title and will play a big role in Belgium’s campaign in 
France, even if it is as a left-back. Headmits to enjoying reading in his spare 
time rather than playing video games. Vertonghen won a lot of sympathy in 
October 2015 when his team-mates were turning up in their posh cars - Axel 
Witsel in a Cadillac, Kevin De Bruyne in a fancy SUV - and the Tottenham 
defender wasdropped off by his mum in a nine-year-old Toyota Corolla

. He was even given a goodbye kiss. The Corolla has a huge emotional 
significance for the family Vertonghen. It was the last car his parents bought 
before his dad passed away. Vertonghen doesn’t have a car in Belgium and always 
stays with his family when the national squad come together. In London he 
drives a Porsche.

Kombarov was a first-choice pick under Fabio Capello at the World Cup but the

Kirill, a right-sided defender, is a team-mate at Spartak Moscow but has never

Position Midfielder

Club Borussia Dortmund

Date of birth 8 September 1995

No one - apart from Thomas Tuchel perhaps - could have foreseen what an impact 
the talented midfielder would have in his first season as a Bundesliga player. 
Signed from second division 1860 Munich in the summer of 2015 he has played 
almost all of Dortmund’s games in 2015-16, becoming a leader in midfield at the 
age of 20. “He has taken a taxi into the limelight,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung 
in August 2015. One of the reasons he is so mature is that the controversial 
1860 Munich manager Ricardo Moniz (it is still difficult to know whether he was 
a genius or mad, according to Süddeutsche) made him captain when he was 18. “He 
will become a man now,” said Moniz. A qualified retail salesman, Weigl did some 
of his qualification in the Borussia fan shop. “I nearly sold my own shirt,” he 
said.

Date of birth 3 August 1989

In May 2015 Olga Rakitskaya organised a concert, attended by her husband’s

video of her song, “Hello, my city” – a sentimental tune about a wish to return 
home to a city long departed. Darijo Srna’s pregnant wife even cried; the 
tragic tale surrounding Donetsk is well known and the Croatian right-back has 
became a genuine “Donchanin”. As for Yaroslav himself, many fans of the 
national team have been angered that he does not sing the national anthem 
before games. Olga explains: “Yaroslav is just so focused on the game. I sing 
for him, by the television set.” There is also another, very trivial, reason – 
Rakitskiy says he simply cannot sing unless, perhaps, he is drunk.

Date of birth 1 May 1982

The captain, with a record 129 caps, is slowing down but still effective. He 
has one tattoo of a footballing deer – ‘srna’ in Croatian – another in tribute 
to his older brother, Igor, who has Down’s syndrome, and recently donated 100 
laptops to Ukrainian children affected by conflict. Career highlights include 
scoring a 30-yard free-kick against Australia in the 2006 World Cup game which 
featured Graham Poll’s three yellow-card blunder. Slaven Bilić said of Srna in 
2012: “They bring him down and he seems broken, but then he gets up and carries 
on running. Like he’s Robocop.” In late 2014Srna bought 20 tonnes of tangerines 
<http://shakhtar.com/en/news/33765> from the plantations near his home town of 
Metkovic. He paid to get them shipped to elementary schools in the war-torn 
Donbass region, where more than 23,000 kids received them along with special 
postcards bearing his picture.

Topal is nicknamed “Spiderman” on account of the good use to which he puts his

players have been unfortunate enough to have faced, and survived, two attempts 
on their life. Last April Topal was travelling in aFenerbahce team bus that was

on its way to Trabzon airport following their 5-1 win at Caykur Rizespor. 
Somehow only the driver of the bus, Ufuk Kiran, was injured and, had he not hit 
the brakes as quickly as he did, the entire squad and staff on board would have 
veered off a cliff on to the rocks below. Last summerTopal’s car was shot at

Date of birth 21 March 1989

A fundamental part of the side, tireless and relentless, providing a wide 
attacking outlet from the back. He was released from the Barcelona youth system 
in 2005 and moved from midfield into defence at Valencia. Barça re-signed him 
in 2012 for €14m, and he now has a €150m buyout clause. Fast, tetchy and 
confrontational on the pitch, off it he relaxes by playing chess (“it makes you 
think”), clothes-shopping, listening to flamenco music and sleeping “for 12 to 
13 hours at night. Then I nap for two, three or four hours more. It’s one of 
the keys to my strength.”

Club Celta Vigo

Date of birth 15 April 1992

Predicted a huge future in the game after joining Manchester City as a

exceptional loan spell at Feyenoord in 2011-12. His career was revived by 
joining Celta Vigo in the summer of 2015. A hugely charismatic figure, the 
Swedish public fell in love with him during the Under-21 European Championship, 
when his leadership and tireless running (and goals) won the title. A joker in 
the dressing room, he was widely praised for going for a kick-about in a local 
park with an eight-year-old after the Champions League final in 2015.Also 
famous for his post-match interview 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnXtFlx1FI> after Sweden had beaten Denmark 
in the Under-21 Euros: “When you lose 4-1 it’s a bit embarrassing. We’re the 
best in the Nordics!” The eyes grow a little wild. “We’re going to play in the 
final! We’re Sweden! The rest can just go home! We were superior. Totally 
superior. This is the worst team we’ve met in the tournament.”

Position Striker

Club Lille OSC

Date of birth 22 December 1987

The only out-and-out striker in the Portugal squad had a difficult upbringing. 
Éder was born in Guinea-Bissau but his parents moved toPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> when he was young and struggled 
for money so from the age of eight he was living at a boarding college called 
Lar o Girassol. He was raised there, without his family, and played for the 
amateur club Ademia until he was 18. “It helped me to grow into the man that I 
have become and aided my football career. Of course, at times it was a little 
bit tough, which is normal, but I enjoyed it a lot,” he told the Swansea City 
website in 2015. “I met so many of my friends there, and it was good to have 
that life experience.”
