Chesterfield fought back from two goals down to secure a replay against 
Scunthorpe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scunthorpe> United – with a 
fourth-round tie at Derby County the prize for the eventual victors.

Jay O’Shea converted a cross with five minutes to go to make it 2‑2 – 14 
minutes after Eoin Doyle had pulled a goal back from the penalty spot following 
a foul on Gary Roberts.

The teams will replay at the Proact Stadium on Tuesday.

Scunthorpe took the lead when the Chelsea loanee Alex Davey fired in from the 
edge of the box and after Lyle Taylor capitalised on an error from Ritchie 
Humphreys to make it 2-0, they looked on course to go through.

However Chesterfield – who had to play and beat MK Dons twice to reach this 
stage after fielding an ineligible player – piled on the pressure and 
eventually found a way past the goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.
