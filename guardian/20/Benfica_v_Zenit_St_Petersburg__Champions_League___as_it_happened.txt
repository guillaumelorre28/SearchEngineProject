GOAL! Benfica 1-0 Zenit St Petersburg (Jonas, 90min+1)

And just like that Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have 
snatched the lead! Gaitan’s free kick into the area finds the head of Jonas six 
yards from the goal, who pounds it perfectly into the back of the net for the 
crucial goal!

81 min: A second switch for Zenit, Zhirkov entering for Shatov. Both sides 
have one remaining. Two thoughts from the gallery, first from liveblog regular 
Ezra Finkelstein ...

It must be hard for the Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> 
and Zenit fans.Even thought hey are throught o the second round,people are 
focusing on a different game,Chelsea PSG.

... then from Jeremy Dresner:

Short straw for you Bryan 

The tactician AVB is obviously going to use superior team discipline to just 
shut down the game. Obviously try to ‘do a napoleon number’ on Benfica and 
freeze them out in the Russian winter’s return leg.

I’m not watching but that’s what I figured would happen is that right? 0-0 all 
over it?

A reasonable point. Why even watch?

69 min: Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> very nearly 
open the scoring when the ball falls to Gaitan, who brilliantly feigns a shot 
before passing the defender and uncorking a shot on goal from point-blank 
range. Brilliant save by Lodygin! Gaitan then has a chance to put home the 
rebound but his follow-up attempt sails over the bar.
 Nicolas Gaitan fires in another shot, the score remains the same. Photograph:

67 min: Criscito is late to arrive and fouls Almeida, drawing a yellow card. 
He becomes the fourth player to start today’s match who won’t be available for 
the return leg. Pizzi’s free kick is struck too hard and Zenit clear.

59 min: Javi Garcia shown yellow for a handball and that’s another player who 
won’t be playing in the return leg in two weeks’ time. Andre Almeida and 
Jardel, both in the book today, will also miss the crucial 9 March match.

57 min: Chaos in the Zenit area and the ball falls to the foot of an onrushing 
Gaitan, whose right-footed effort is blasted well wide. More chances with 
greater frequency through the first dozen minutes here but no closer to our 
first goal.

54 min: Sanches vaults over Garcia right near midfield while vying for a 50-50 
ball and their bodies clatter every which way. The referee orders a free kick 
for Zenit miles from the goal. It’s played short and Zenit will try to build up 
patiently from the middle third. Until they don’t. A hasty, directionless ball 
forward, ostensibly for Hulk, badly misses the mark and is out for aBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> goal kick.

36 min: Benfica’s Jardel shown yellow after throwing Hulk to the turf away 
from the ball. The burly Brazilian strikes it low to the far post and with pace 
but misses two yards wide right. Chances beginning to trickle in here.

3 min: Zenit have won the first free kick of the match, from roughly 35 yards. 
Some jostling in the box between players the referee must sort out. The effort 
curls up and bends dangerously toward the goal but Julio Cesar easily collects 
it.

Hello and welcome to today’s opening leg of the Champions League last 16 tie 
between Benfica andZenit St Petersburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg> at Lisbon’s Estádio da 
Luz. The Russian champions, currently at sixth in their domestic league, are 
back in action after a two-month break, having not taken the pitch since a 2-1 
loss to Gent in their final group-stage match on 9 December. Meanwhile, Benfica 
enter with the aftertaste of defeat for the first time in nearly as long: on 
Friday they saw an 11-match winning streak dating back to mid-December snapped 
in a 2-1 loss to Porto, their cross-town rivals.

Kickoff is just over a quarter hour from now. We’ll be back with the team 
information in short order.

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not read Martin Laurence’s 
preview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2016/feb/16/champions-league-fixtures-psg-chelsea-roma-real-madrid>
 of today’s match.

These clubs are meeting for the fifth time in four years in the Champions 
League. Zenit have had the better of the fixtures, winning three, but Benfica’s 
one victory in that time proved the most decisive with an injury time goal from 
Nelson Oliveira – now of Nottingham Forest – taking the Portuguese club through 
on away goals at this stage of the competition in 2012. The man of the match on 
that day wasAxel Witsel <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/25191/>, who has 
since switched between the two clubs.

André Villas-Boas has confirmed he will be leaving Zenit at the end of a 
bitterly disappointing league campaign. Last season’s Russian Premier League 
champions sit fourth, having won just three of their last 12 matches, and will 
again rely on star manHulk <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/16886>. The 
Brazilian earned the second highest group stage rating (8.79), courtesy of 
three goals and four assists, but will have to cope with abuse from the home 
support due to his Porto past.

Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> suffered their first 
defeat in 15 league matches against Hulk’s old employers on Friday but they 
have been in sensational form lately, picking up 40 points from a possible 42 
before that defeat to Porto. They will be strong favourites as a result, with 
all eyes on sought-after 18-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches, who secured an 
excellent rating of 7.41 across his two group stage appearances.

That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure 
to check back later for a full match report.
 
And there’s the final whistle! What a finish for Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>, who will bring a 1-0 lead into 
the return leg in St Petersburg in two weeks’ time.
 
90 min+3: Ten-man Zenit looking to muscle their way down the pick but the 
midfielder keying the attack is dispossessed and here come Benfical. Gaitan 
running with the ball, passing to Jimenez, back to Samaris, whose speculative 
shot from outside the area is on target and turned away by the Zenit keeper.
 
90 min+2: Jonas shown yellow following an excessive celebration.

And just like that Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have 
snatched the lead! Gaitan’s free kick into the area finds the head of Jonas six 
yards from the goal, who pounds it perfectly into the back of the net for the 
crucial goal!

2016 <https://twitter.com/La_Graderia31/status/699708337538134016>  
90 min: Zenit’s Criscito earns a second yellow for a foul on Almeida and he’s 
been sent off. The Russians will need to play stoppage time a man down, 
starting with a free kick here.
 
89 min: Eliseu hacks down Anyukov near midfield. Chances of a goal looking 
less and less likely.
 
87 min: The final sub for Zenit as daMauricio enters for Danny.
 
85 min: Renato Sanches whistled for a foul on Hulk. Eliseu’s shot on the 
re-start is turned away by Witsel.Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> looking increasingly desperate 
to get on the board here.
 
81 min: A second switch for Zenit, Zhirkov entering for Shatov. Both sides 
have one remaining. Two thoughts from the gallery, first from liveblog regular 
Ezra Finkelstein ...

It must be hard for the Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> 
and Zenit fans.Even thought hey are throught o the second round,people are 
focusing on a different game,Chelsea PSG.

... then from Jeremy Dresner:

Short straw for you Bryan 

The tactician AVB is obviously going to use superior team discipline to just 
shut down the game. Obviously try to ‘do a napoleon number’ on Benfica and 
freeze them out in the Russian winter’s return leg.

I’m not watching but that’s what I figured would happen is that right? 0-0 all 
over it?

A reasonable point. Why even watch?
 
79 min: Moments after Almeida’s shot is turned away, Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> win a corner. Carcela-Gonzalez 
takes it but the keeper Lodygin travels well off his line to intercept it.
 
75 min: Criscito fouled by Carcela-Gonzalez while trying to start the Zenit 
attack along the left flank near midfield. But a quarter hour remains with the 
sides still deadlocked at nil-nil.
 
74 min: Dzyuba exits in place of Kokorin, Zenit’s first substitution of the 
match.
 
72 min: Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> win a corner 
and Gaitan will take it. The ball falls to Jardel, whose well struck effort 
misses wide. The hosts are no doubt knocking at the door here.
 
71 min: Twenty minutes left and Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> have made a second switch, 
Carcela-Gonzalez entering for Pizzi.
 Rui Vitoria looks towards the referee for the decision. Photograph: Patricia 
de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images  
69 min: Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> very nearly 
open the scoring when the ball falls to Gaitan, who brilliantly feigns a shot 
before passing the defender and uncorking a shot on goal from point-blank 
range. Brilliant save by Lodygin! Gaitan then has a chance to put home the 
rebound but his follow-up attempt sails over the bar.

Jose Sena Goulao/EPA  
67 min: Criscito is late to arrive and fouls Almeida, drawing a yellow card. 
He becomes the fourth player to start today’s match who won’t be available for 
the return leg. Pizzi’s free kick is struck too hard and Zenit clear.
 
64 min: Ball played to Hulk in the area and he tries to maneuver for space as 
threeBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> players close in. 
He crashes to the turf but the referee hardly spares a glance. Cleanly defended.

Moreira/AFP/Getty Images  
63 min: An attacking switch as Jimenez enters for Mitroglou, Benfica’s first 
switch of the match.
 
61 min: A half hour left and the Estádio da Luz faithful are urging their men 
on. Looks like the first subs of the match are readying to enter the match.
 
60 min: Danny with a nifty dash of skill to maneuver past a defender, but he’s 
flagged for offside.
 
59 min: Javi Garcia shown yellow for a handball and that’s another player who 
won’t be playing in the return leg in two weeks’ time. Andre Almeida and 
Jardel, both in the book today, will also miss the crucial 9 March match.
 
57 min: Chaos in the Zenit area and the ball falls to the foot of an onrushing 
Gaitan, whose right-footed effort is blasted well wide. More chances with 
greater frequency through the first dozen minutes here but no closer to our 
first goal.
 
54 min: Sanches vaults over Garcia right near midfield while vying for a 50-50 
ball and their bodies clatter every which way. The referee orders a free kick 
for Zenit miles from the goal. It’s played short and Zenit will try to build up 
patiently from the middle third. Until they don’t. A hasty, directionless ball 
forward, ostensibly for Hulk, badly misses the mark and is out for aBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> goal kick.
 
53 min: Cesar punches the corner away and Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> are on the counter. Ball played 
forward on a series of short, quick passes to Mitroglou, who is dispossessed in 
the final third and now Zenit are back on another counter. More crowd-friendly, 
incisive play here early.
 
51 min: Benfica have come out swinging, but now Zenit have responded with a 
pair of shots by Witzel, both turned away by the keeper. A corner to Zenit, 
Hulk to take it.
 
48 min: An effort on goal by the youngster Renato Sanches, but it sails high 
over the target.
 
47 min: Gaitan is short of the target and easily turned away by Shatov, who is 
camped out by the near post.
 
46 min: We’re off and running in the second half. Quite literally as Benfica’s 
kickoff is played wide to Gaitan and he surges up the flank to win a corner. A 
look at the first-half stats.

Clearly the referee has seen enough, calling a stop to the first half without 
so much as a second added on. Here’s hoping the second stanza the action and 
flow to match the caliber of talent on the pitch.

Franca/AP  
43 min: Another foul by Pizzi, this time on Shatov, and now the Portuguese 
becomes the thirdBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> player 
to find his name in the referee’s book. A rhythmless slog of a first half drags 
itself toward the whistle.
 
40 min: Hulk’s errant left arm lands on Gaitan’s shoulder and the Argentine 
sells it, winning the foul. Samaris to take the free kick, but it’s cleared.
 
38 min: Jonas with a foul on the Zenit captain Danny along the sideline and 
Lodygin will take the free kick. Nothing.
 
36 min: Benfica’s Jardel shown yellow after throwing Hulk to the turf away 
from the ball. The burly Brazilian strikes it low to the far post and with pace 
but misses two yards wide right. Chances beginning to trickle in here.

32 min: Witsel drags down Jonas away from the ball and he’s correctly shown 
yellow. Renato Sanches to take it and Mitroglou buries in the back of the net! 
Unfortunately forBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> he’s 
offside by a yard and the linesman sees it.
 
29 min: Jonas finds space inside the area and uncorks a low-lying shot toward 
the corner, but it’s turned away by Lombaerts. Best chance of the match for 
either side as we approach the half-hour mark.
 
25 min: Benfica dominating possession by a two-to-one margin thus far, 67% to 
33%, with 167 total passes for the hosts compared to 66 for the visitors.
 
22 min: Mitroglou has a go on goal but Lombaerts turns it away. It’s briefly 
cleared but from midfield a ball is played through to Zenit’s Dzyuba, but the 
flag goes up and he’s ruled offside.
 Konstantinos Mitroglou fires the ball between Lombaerts and Garay. 
Photograph: Francisco Leong/AFP/Getty Images  
21 min: Benfica with a more patient build-up from the back into the final 
third, but they’re dispossessed and Zenit are quick downfield on the 
counter-attack. Hulk slaloms around threeBenfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> defenders but the ball is taken 
off him. Neither goalkeeper has been tested through 20 minutes.
 
17 min: Almeida sees yellow for a foul on Criscito, which gives Zenit a good 
look at goal on a set piece. Hulk’s effort is low and cleared out by a defender 
giving Zenit a throw-in, but it’s sent down near the goal line and out to give
Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> a goal kick.
 
14 min: Back-to-back corners won for Zenit with Hulk taking both, but neither 
create much danger. Ball turned away to midfield where the teams are now 
trading possession.
 
12 min: Pizzi wins another foul for Benfica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>, but his effort is easily 
corralled by the Zenit keeper.
 
10 min: A very physical start for both sides so far with Zenit deployed in a 
very conservative formation.
 
6 min: Criscito hacks down Benfica’s Pizzi and he wins the foul. Jardel to 
take the free kick but nothing comes of it.
 
3 min: Zenit have won the first free kick of the match, from roughly 35 yards. 
Some jostling in the box between players the referee must sort out. The effort 
curls up and bends dangerously toward the goal but Julio Cesar easily collects 
it.
 
1 min: And we’re off! Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica>

Hello and welcome to today’s opening leg of the Champions League last 16 tie 
between Benfica andZenit St Petersburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg> at Lisbon’s Estádio da 
Luz. The Russian champions, currently at sixth in their domestic league, are 
back in action after a two-month break, having not taken the pitch since a 2-1 
loss to Gent in their final group-stage match on 9 December. Meanwhile, Benfica 
enter with the aftertaste of defeat for the first time in nearly as long: on 
Friday they saw an 11-match winning streak dating back to mid-December snapped 
in a 2-1 loss to Porto, their cross-town rivals.

Kickoff is just over a quarter hour from now. We’ll be back with the team 
information in short order.
 
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not read Martin Laurence’s 
preview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2016/feb/16/champions-league-fixtures-psg-chelsea-roma-real-madrid>
 of today’s match.

These clubs are meeting for the fifth time in four years in the Champions 
League. Zenit have had the better of the fixtures, winning three, but Benfica’s 
one victory in that time proved the most decisive with an injury time goal from 
Nelson Oliveira – now of Nottingham Forest – taking the Portuguese club through 
on away goals at this stage of the competition in 2012. The man of the match on 
that day wasAxel Witsel <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/25191/>, who has 
since switched between the two clubs.

André Villas-Boas has confirmed he will be leaving Zenit at the end of a 
bitterly disappointing league campaign. Last season’s Russian Premier League 
champions sit fourth, having won just three of their last 12 matches, and will 
again rely on star manHulk <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/16886>. The 
Brazilian earned the second highest group stage rating (8.79), courtesy of 
three goals and four assists, but will have to cope with abuse from the home 
support due to his Porto past.

Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> suffered their first 
defeat in 15 league matches against Hulk’s old employers on Friday but they 
have been in sensational form lately, picking up 40 points from a possible 42 
before that defeat to Porto. They will be strong favourites as a result, with 
all eyes on sought-after 18-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches, who secured an 
excellent rating of 7.41 across his two group stage appearances.
