Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> may have thought he 
had discovered Italy’s achilles heel when he suggested in a private meeting 
recently that the country would capitulate to British demands in Brexit 
negotiations because it would be loath to “sell less prosecco”.

But in Veneto, where the fizzy wine is made, Johnson’s not-so-subtle threat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/european-ministers-boris-johnson-prosecco-claim-brexit>
 against one of Italy’s most fashionable exports to Britain was met with 
bemusement and even confusion.

“It was quite funny … He’s like an actor. He’s not in a position to manage 
[the business of] prosecco and the taste of the English people,” said Filippo 
Cigoli, the UK export manager for Maschio dei Cavalieri.

In the last 48 hours, Cigoli said, he had not heard a word about the 
controversy from his customers in the UK. “I just received orders,” he said 
with a laugh.

He gets so many orders, in fact, that Cigoli regularly turns down requests 
from British supermarkets for more and more prosecco, because he simply does 
not have enough.

“I refuse a million bottles per week, as if it’s peanuts. As if it’s a glass 
of water. What can I say? Maybe there is something behind Johnson’s words that 
we don’t yet understand, but considering how the business is going, it will not 
change anything,” Cigoli said.

The controversy began when Italy’s economic development minister, Carlo 
Calenda, said he had beeninsulted by Johnson during a meeting 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/u-k-s-brexit-policy-chaos-is-unacceptable-italy-s-calenda-says>
 in which the two had been discussing Brexit.


“He basically said: ‘I don’t want free movement of people but I want the 
single market,’” Calenda told Bloomberg Television. “I said: ‘No way.’ He said: 
‘You’ll sell less prosecco.’ I said: ‘OK, you’ll sell less fish and chips, but 
I’ll sell less prosecco to one country and you’ll sell less to 27 countries.’ 
Putting things on this level is a bit insulting.”

Italian and UK officials have sought to downplay the disagreement, with the 
Italians saying they were eager to put the matter behind them and did not want 
to blow the significance of the exchange out of proportion. Prosecco had 
probably not been singled out on purpose, said one Italian official, who 
nevertheless believed it was “inappropriate” to be discussing specific export 
issues at this stage.

For Stefano Zanette, the head of the Prosecco Consortium, the fracas hardly 
spelled doom. “InItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> we say you 
shouldn’t bandage your head before you break it,” he said. If consumption of 
prosecco dropped in the UK because it had become much more expensive for 
British consumers post-Brexit, “we will manage that by betting on other 
markets”, he said.

At least one producer was perturbed by the fact that in an export market where 
defence and heavy machinery are by far the biggest economic drivers between the 
UK and Italy, a product as life-affirming as prosecco would be caught up in a 
nasty political melodrama.

Sales of prosecco to the UK have increased from 38 million bottles in 2013 to 
94 million last year, in a market that is now worth more than €220m, according 
to Italy’s prosecco consortium.

“We love England and the English love this drink and we have to focus on these 
things,” said Giovanni Iaconis, the export manager of La Jara. “It’s a market. 
It’s what binds us. When I think of London, it’s a place of gastronomy, why 
should we fight over it?”

He suggested the spat could be resolved simply by sending Johnson a case of 
the bubbly stuff. “The world is connected through food and drink. Tomorrow it 
will be würstel from Germany and potatoes from France. Prosecco and fish and 
chips ought not to be used as weapons.”

Pietro Biscontin, general director of La Delizia, another prosecco maker, said 
such “political skirmishes” did not give him cause for concern. “The British 
market is very receptive. They are willing to pay. Brexit is good for prosecco 
because it will make people who won cheer and will console those who lost,” he 
said.
