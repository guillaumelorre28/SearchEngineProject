The nominations for a key indicator of the Oscars, the Producers Guild of 
America’s awards, have been announced, solidifying the impression that the 
Academy Awards is a three-way race.

La La Land <https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land>, Manchester By the 
Sea and Moonlight are emerging as the three strongest Oscar contenders, and 
have all been nominated in the 10-film list for the PGA’s Zanuck trophy, which 
recognises the year’s best theatrical motion picture. Superhero movie Deadpool 
is arguably the most surprising entry of the remaining nominations, but Tom 
Ford’s thriller Nocturnal Animals has been left out, despite strong showings in 
other awards line-ups.

In the past, the Producers Guild award has been a reliable guide to the 
subsequent winner of the best picture Oscar, with 19 out of 27 winners of 
previous awards matching. In 2016, however, the result diverged when The Big 
Short took the PGA and Spotlight brought home the Oscar.

The guild has also announced its nominations for best animated film, which 
include the year’s top-grossing film in the US,Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-dory>. Seven out of the 11 previous 
winners have gone on to win the equivalent Oscar. These join previously 
revealed contenders in documentary and TV.

The winners will be announced on 28 January at a ceremony in Beverly Hills.
