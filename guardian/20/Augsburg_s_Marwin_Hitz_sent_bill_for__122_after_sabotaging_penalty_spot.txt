The Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz has been sent a bill for €122.92 (£89.24) 
by the head of Cologne’s sporting venues (KSS) after he was caught sabotaging 
the penalty spot during aBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> match at the weekend.

With the scores level at 0-0, Hitz deliberately dug his studs into the turf

 and swivelled a few times for maximum impact just before Anthony Modeste 
stepped up to take a penalty. The former Blackburn striker then slipped and 
Hitz made the save, with Augsburg going on to win 1-0.

The Switzerland goalkeeper attempted to play down the incident before 
conceding that he had been in the wrong. But, despite escaping punishment from 
the Bundesliga, Hans Rütten sent Hitz a bill to cover the cost of repairing the 
pitch, which included buying a square metre of turf for €22.50, employing a 
member of groundstaff for two hours (€40.25) and tax.

“Strictly speaking, it was the wanton destruction of KSS property,” Rütten 
said. “What Marwin Hitz did had little to do with fair play. It’s not about the 
money. But a bit of punishment does no harm. If Marwin Hitz pays, then we will 
donate the amount to the children’s hospital in Cologne.”

To his credit, Hitz took the punishment with good grace. “With a wink, I like 
to pay my debts,” he wrote on Twitter. “In addition, I will make a donation to 
the children’s hospital.”
