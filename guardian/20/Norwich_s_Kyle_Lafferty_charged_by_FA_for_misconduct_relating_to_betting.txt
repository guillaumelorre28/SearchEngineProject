The Norwich striker Kyle Lafferty has been charged by the Football Association 
with misconduct in relation to betting.

The 28-year-old Northern Ireland international is alleged to have broken FA 
rules by betting on a match in February.

The governing body said in a statement: “Kyle Lafferty has been charged by the 
FA for misconduct in relation to betting.

“It is alleged that on February 20, 2016, the Norwich City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norwichcity> forward placed a bet on the 
result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football 
match or competition in breach of FA rule E8. He has until 5 August 2016 to 
respond to the charge.”

Norwich did not have a match on the date in question, which saw a selection of 
FA Cup fifth-round games played along with Football League fixtures.
