Dollmaker Liz Lee fondly remembers the thrill of visiting her grandmother’s 
house and peering into the glass-fronted cabinet of treasures she kept.

Surveying her own collections today gives her a similar tingle of delight. “My 
style is an eclectic jumble of antique, kitsch and nostalgia,” she says. Dainty 
china tea sets are a particular weakness. “I have boxes of chinaware – I can’t 
help myself. If I spot a beautifully decorated 40s tea set, I’ll grab it and 
clasp it to my bosom! I have so many saucers that one stack is set aside just 
for feeding my chihuahua, Pixie.”

The kitsch finds in Lee’s seaside cottage in Ramsgate, Kent, were won at 
amusement arcades and found in charity shops. Her horse brasses, copper pans 
and display cabinets crammed with all manner of mementoes are firmly rooted in 
an old-school tradition.

Vintage dolls also have a special place in Lee’s heart – which is 
understandable given her job. “My dolls are hand-painted, but nothing like 
those ghastly Reborn babies,” she says. Her own collection not only features 
Italian handpainted dolls but also Tammys and Sindys – Britain’s more 
“wholesome” answers to Barbie. Pride of place on the landing goes to her 
Spanish doll. “When I was young, we all had pen friends abroad and there was a 
fad for sending each other dolls in national costume,” she says. “I longed to 
get a flamenco dancer, but never did – so I bought myself this one recently to 
make up for it.”

So what does Lee think lies at the heart of her ongoing love affair with 
kitsch? “I think it’s very comforting,” she says. “Particularly in times of 
recession, there’s an urge to look back and try to reconnect with a past that 
seems much more appealing and safe.”

From an aesthetic point of view, Lee also likes the optimistic, bright colours 
that come with retro style.

Her collection of vintage needlepoint pictures shines out with synthetic 
clarity, as does her sunshine yellow kitchen, made from freestanding units that 
she bought in various local junk shops. In the bathroom and guest bedroom, 
sherbert pink adds a more romantic 50s filter, while the bedroom is resplendent 
in the yellow, hot pink and black of a box of liquorice allsorts.

“I deliberately chose colours that feel uplifting first thing in the morning,” 
says Lee. “Every other front door in Ramsgate is painted in downpipe grey. I’d 
just like to say: ‘Plenty of other colours are available…’”

Lee has lived in Ramsgate for five years and says that, like its neighbouring 
towns in this corner of the Kent coast, the place is slowly changing. But the 
area remains a good hunting ground for all things vintage, including wool and 
fabrics, which Lee turns into clothes for the collectable dolls that she makes 
by hand. “Every few weeks another new shop or restaurant opens here,” she says. 
“One day it will become gentrified, but it’s a fair way off yet – thank 
goodness.”
