Mourinho is putting the blame squarely on the players: “I think they deserved 
to win. Football is not just about quality, it’s also about effort, commitment, 
playing to the limits and giving everything. A team that concedes a goal after 
two minutes is a team that is not ready, not prepared, not concentrated .. it’s 
our fault. After their second goal we had a reaction but we didn’t deserve more 
because football is 90 minutes and it is to be played at the maximum of your 
desire, concentration and capacity ... At the start it was like they were 
playing the Champions League final and we were playing a sumer friendly. That’s 
the reality.”

“I’m a City fan but I would not wish this on my worst enemy,” says William 
Corkhill. “United players are just not interested. It’s kind of depressing. I 
can’t believe I’m saying this.”

Full-time: Fenerbahce 2-1 Manchester United

Three superb goals but only one winner and it wasn’t United, who now have an 
uphill task to make it out of the group stages. They will need to summon a lot 
more creativity to get the points they need from their remaining games and, 
indeed, to make any further inroads on the Premier League. They were woeful at 
the back but most of the problem was in midfield, where there was too much 
clutter and too little fluency, both before and after Pogba departed with an 
unspecified injury. Ibrahimovic and Rooney get in the way too often. They are 
stunting the growth of Rashford and Martial.

Until Mourinho finds a solution, best get used to more of this sort of thing:

@Paul_Doyle <https://twitter.com/Paul_Doyle> just like Newcastle i reckon it 
would be beneficial for Man Utd if they got relegated and started over

rejuvenated, leaps high and sticks a good header on it, forcing Ismail to head

GOAL! Fenerbahce 2-1 United (Rooney 89)

That’s a superb goal! Rooney received the ball about 28 yards out, turned his 
man and then lashed it into the top corner past a despairing dive. A bolt from 
the blue! A blast from the past!

80 min: “Your little stats graphic thingamajig says United already have two 
whole shots on goal,” carps Matthew Turner. Really, I can’t remember them. 
Obviously either one or both of us is making stuff up, it’s up to you to try to 
figure out which. Kinda like the US presidential election.

79 min: Fener rip United apart again! United just can’t handle their pace. 
Lens again got in down the right and Mehmet Topal found him with an easy pass. 
Lens then flashed the ball across the face of goal and Emenike hurled himself 
at it and missed by millimetres!

United manage their first shot on target?
 Another dismal Europa League trip for Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United.

76 min: Emenike rasps one at De Gea from 20 yards and the goalkeeper needs two

69 min: United are opened up with embarrassing ease! Lens galloped forward 
down the right as Shaw was stranded up field. As soon as the Dutchman got the 
ball he took a touch and crossed to Emenike, who got away from Rojo and Blind 
with absurd ease and should have made it 3-0. But his first touch was gauche

GOAL! Fenerbahce 2-0 United (Lens 59)

It’s another beauty, and another shot that takes De gea by surprise! Lens 
curls a sumptuous shot around the wall and just inside the post, as De Gea 
watches in impotent dismay! The curl and power from a short run-up left him 
befuddled.

58 min: Martial - United’s sharpest attacker so far - skins his man down the

José Mourinho slams Manchester United’s ‘summer friendly’ attitude

Manchester United downed by stunning strikes from Fenerbahce's Sow and Lens

Mourinho is putting the blame squarely on the players: “I think they deserved 
to win. Football is not just about quality, it’s also about effort, commitment, 
playing to the limits and giving everything. A team that concedes a goal after 
two minutes is a team that is not ready, not prepared, not concentrated .. it’s 
our fault. After their second goal we had a reaction but we didn’t deserve more 
because football is 90 minutes and it is to be played at the maximum of your 
desire, concentration and capacity ... At the start it was like they were 
playing the Champions League final and we were playing a sumer friendly. That’s 
the reality.”

“I’m a City fan but I would not wish this on my worst enemy,” says William 
Corkhill. “United players are just not interested. It’s kind of depressing. I 
can’t believe I’m saying this.”
 
Three superb goals but only one winner and it wasn’t United, who now have an 
uphill task to make it out of the group stages. They will need to summon a lot 
more creativity to get the points they need from their remaining games and, 
indeed, to make any further inroads on the Premier League. They were woeful at 
the back but most of the problem was in midfield, where there was too much 
clutter and too little fluency, both before and after Pogba departed with an 
unspecified injury. Ibrahimovic and Rooney get in the way too often. They are 
stunting the growth of Rashford and Martial.

Until Mourinho finds a solution, best get used to more of this sort of thing:

90+3 min: Mkhitaryan fires over a corner. The keeper claims. 
 
90+2 min: Corner to United. Mata sends over an outswinger. Rooney, suddenly 
rejuvenated, leaps high and sticks a good header on it, forcing Ismail to head 
off the line for another corner.

90 min: United have four minutes to punish Fener for failing to take any of 
the chances they had to make it 3-0 ....
 
That’s a superb goal! Rooney received the ball about 28 yards out, turned his 
man and then lashed it into the top corner past a despairing dive. A bolt from 
the blue! A blast from the past!

Fener substitution: Ismail on, Sow off. 
 
84 min: Martial tries a different approach - a direct shot from 25+ yards - 
but gets nowhere near the target.
 
83 min: Zorya Luhansk are still holding 10-man Feyenoord to a 1-1. United are 
still trying to pick a dainty pattern through Fenerbahce despite having no 
success whatsoever so far.
 
80 min: “Your little stats graphic thingamajig says United already have two 
whole shots on goal,” carps Matthew Turner. Really, I can’t remember them. 
Obviously either one or both of us is making stuff up, it’s up to you to try to 
figure out which. Kinda like the US presidential election.
 
79 min: Fener rip United apart again! United just can’t handle their pace. 
Lens again got in down the right and Mehmet Topal found him with an easy pass. 
Lens then flashed the ball across the face of goal and Emenike hurled himself 
at it and missed by millimetres!
 
77 min: Anyone want to give me odds on Fenerbahce scoring a third goal before 
United manage their first shot on target?
 Another dismal Europa League trip for Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United.

76 min: Emenike rasps one at De Gea from 20 yards and the goalkeeper needs two 
attempts to hold it. United’s central defenders, meanwhile, have no idea how to 
contain Emenike.
 
75 min: Rooney drops deep, collects the ball and attempts a spectacular 
crossfield pass, which is intercepted. Yes, I did just cut and paste that from 
previous entries.
 
75 min: Mata chops down Alper to abort another Fener counter-attack. The 
ensuing yellow card is richly deserved.
 
73 min: Ibrahimovic tries to blem the freekick into the net from nigh-on 30 
yards. But he barely gets the ball off the ground and the wall whack it clear.
 
71 min: Skrtel booked for catching a United player from behind for old time’s 
sake. It was Ibrahimovic, as it happened.

Skrtel. Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters  
69 min: United are opened up with embarrassing ease! Lens galloped forward 
down the right as Shaw was stranded up field. As soon as the Dutchman got the 
ball he took a touch and crossed to Emenike, who got away from Rojo and Blind 
with absurd ease and should have made it 3-0. But his first touch was gauche 
and De Gea was able to bundle the ball away.
 
Fener substitution: Emenike on, Sen off. 
 
66 min: Rooney drops deep to collect a pass. He looks up and flights a cross 
to Ibrahimovic, who takes it down on his thigh and then tries to wow his way 
past three defenders. He fails.
 
64 min: In this group’s other match, Zorya Luhansk are currently holding 
Feyenoord to 1-1 so there may be at least some good news for United today.
 
United substitution: Mkhitaryan on, Rashford off. Mourinho turns to Mkhitaryan 
as a last resort.
 
It’s another beauty, and another shot that takes De gea by surprise! Lens 
curls a sumptuous shot around the wall and just inside the post, as De Gea 
watches in impotent dismay! The curl and power from a short run-up left him 
befuddled.

59 min: Ibrahimovic chases Mehmet Topal and then tugs him back several yards 
outside the United area. Freekick in a dangerous position...
 
58 min: Martial - United’s sharpest attacker so far - skins his man down the 
left and fires in a flow cross. It’s cleared as far as Mata, whose quick 
slapshot from 14 yards whizzes a couple of yards wide.
 
57 min: Alper booked for persistently irritating behaviour.
 
55 min: Martial cuts in from the left and clips a decent cross into the box. 
Rooney gets a glancing header on it about 10 yards out but fails to direct it 
on target.
 
53 min: Don’t wish to labour the point ... but that’s exactly what Rooney and 
Ibrahimovic are doing. They’re just getting in the way and slowing things down 
for United. It’s no good having them as notional strikers while Martial and 
Rashford are marginalised on the flanks. Mourinho must see this.
