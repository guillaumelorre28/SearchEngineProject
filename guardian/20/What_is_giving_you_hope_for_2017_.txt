There is no denying that 2016 has been a hard year. With much political 
uncertainty, terror and death, it has left many feeling slightly bereft of hope.


That’s why what we really need as we welcome in 2017 is some optimism. This 
week Guardian writers have been offering theirreasons to be hopeful

As Harry Leslie Smith wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/30/reasons-to-be-hopeful-2016-britain-welfare-state>
:




As my life has been long, I have seen Britain up against the setting sun of 
history before. I witnessed our country on its knees from theGreat Depression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/17/remember-great-depression-no-doesnt-seem-anyone-does>
; with its back to the wall and underthreat of invasion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/botched-nazi-spy-mission-sabotage-germany>
 by the Nazis. Over my nine decades of life, I’ve known despair but never 
hopelessness.
