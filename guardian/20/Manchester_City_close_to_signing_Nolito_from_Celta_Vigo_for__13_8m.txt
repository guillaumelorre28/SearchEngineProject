Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> are 
confident of completing the signing of the Spain forward Nolito from Celta Vigo 
as Pep Guardiola steps up his recruitment drive for the new Premier League 
season.

The 29-year-old, whose real name is Manuel Agudo Durán, is currently part of 
the Spain squad at Euro 2016 having scored 12 goals in La Liga last season.
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> had also registered 
an interest in signing the player, who began his career at Camp Nou before 
moving to Benfica and then Granada and has a release clause of €18m (£13.8m).

But it is understood City have already agreed personal terms with Nolito over 
a three-year contract with an option of a one-year extension worth around €4m a 
season, with the player keen to link up with Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium.

If he does arrive, Nolito would become Guardiola’s second signing since he 
succeeded Manuel Pellegrini as manager. Germany international lkay Gündogan
joined the club

earlier this month, although attempts to buy Aymeric Laporte were scuppered 
when the French defender signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao.
