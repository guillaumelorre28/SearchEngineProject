A 45-year-old man was arrested on Monday in an investigation into a £10.25m 
loan made to a club by a borough council.

Northamptonshire police issued a statement saying the man, who has been 
released on conditional bail, is “helping with inquiries”.

Northampton Borough Council loaned Northampton

stadium development at the League Two club in 2013. The proposed work was never 
completed and, in November 2015, police launched an investigation into “alleged 
financial irregularities”.

The BBC said <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-35411230> 
the man arrested was the former club chairman, David Cardoza, though police had 
yet to confirm that information.

Northamptonshire police launched a criminal investigation in November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/23/northampton-town-police-council-criminal-investigation>
 into alleged financial irregularities at Northampton Town over the loan for a 
new east stand, which has not been built. A team of around a dozen police 
officers served a warrant on the club and seized documents and computer 
equipment for investigation.

At the same time Cardoza agreed to sell his stake to Kelvin Thomas, the former 
Oxford United chairman, who paid off a £166,000 debt owed to HM Revenue & 
Customs.

Det Chief Insp Paul Spicer said: “This remains a very complex investigation 
and, as such, it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment at 
this time.”
