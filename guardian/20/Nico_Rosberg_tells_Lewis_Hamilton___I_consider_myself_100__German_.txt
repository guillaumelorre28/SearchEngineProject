Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg> has described 
himself as “100% German” following Lewis Hamilton’s latest jibe at his Mercedes 
team-mate’s upbringing.

After his triumph at the British Grand Prix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-grand-prix> on Sunday Hamilton was 
asked how valuable it would be to win Rosberg’s home race in Germany on 20 July.

Responding with a grin, Hamilton said: “To be honest, Nico has never actually 
been in Germany, so it’s not really his home race.”

Hamilton then recounted a tale of their karting days when Rosberg used to 
stand by a flag of Monaco, given he was raised in the principality from four 
months old after being born in Wiesbaden.

In response to Hamilton’s comments, following the first of two days of an 
in-season test at Silverstone - with his team-mate to take the wheel on 
Wednesday - Rosberg said: “Anyone can judge however they want.”

Asked whether he is as German as Hamilton is British, Rosberg said: “Not 
really, because I didn’t grow up in Germany, but I consider myself 100% German.”

Rosberg would love to follow in the footsteps of Michael Schumacher and 
Sebastian Vettel and win in front of his home fans. Looking ahead to the race, 
Rosberg said: “It’ll be great, driving the Silver Arrow – a dominant Silver 
Arrow – it will be special. I hope I get a lot of support, and I’m looking 
forward to it.

“But even the British crowd at Silverstone were great. OK, they supported 
Lewis, but I got a lot of respect, and that was really nice to see.

“In some ways even I could enjoy the great atmosphere they brought to the race 
track at the weekend.”

With the 11 teams at the test focusing on a variety of different aspects of 
set-up and development, it meant the times were largely irrelevant.

Overall, Rosberg finished third on the timesheet with a lap of 1min 35.573sec, 
with Williams’s Felipe Massa quickest in 1:35.242.
