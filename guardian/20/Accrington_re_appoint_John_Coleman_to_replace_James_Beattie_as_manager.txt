Accrington have appointed John Coleman as the club’s new manager for a second 
time.

The 51-year-old was at the helm between 1999 and 2012, during which time he 
took the Lancashire club from the Northern Premier League first division to the 
Football League following a 44-year absence.

Coleman and his assistant, Jimmy Bell, who both moved on to Rochdale in 2012, 
have left their roles with the League of Ireland Premier Division side Sligo 
Rovers to return to Accrington on rolling contracts.

Stanley had been without a manager since former England striker James Beattie 
left by mutual consent last week

.

“We hope this is going to be an exciting time for the players, staff and 
supporters,”Coleman told the club’s official website 
<http://accringtonstanley.co.uk/2014/09/coley-returns/>.

“It’s certainly an exciting time for me and Jimmy. We’ve never really stopped 
supporting the club since we left, we’ve seen a lot of games and we can’t wait 
to work with this group of players.

“It’s no secret that I’ve wanted to manage in the Football League again and 
when a job comes up at a club as close to your heart as Accrington then that 
ticks two boxes.”

The club’s chairman, Peter Marsden, said: “John and Jimmy’s passion and 
enthusiasm and knowledge of the game are legendary.”

Coleman inherits a side positioned 20th in Sky Bet League Two having lost five 
of their eight games.
