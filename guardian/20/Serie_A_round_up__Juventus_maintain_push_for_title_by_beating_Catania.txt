Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> maintained their 
charge for a third successive Serie A title by winning 1-0 at 10-man Catania in 
a fiery match.

Carlos Tevez scored the only goal to take him level with Torino's Ciro 
Immobile at the top of the scoring charts.

Catania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/catania> were forced to play 
with 10 men for much of the second half after Gonzalo Bergessio was dismissed 
following a second booking. Both coaches were also sent to the stands for 
protests during the first period.

Juventus restored their 14-point lead over Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma>, who have a game in hand.

Earlier Fiorentina snatched a late 1-0 win at 10-man Napoli to boost their 
chances of sneaking into the Champions League.Internazionale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/internazionale> are four points further 
back after a last-minute goal consigned them to a 2-1 defeat at home to 
Atalanta. Parma are level with Inter but have a game in hand after they drew 
1-1 with Genoa in the lunchtime kick-off.

Lazio are five points off a European spot after being held to a 1-1 draw by 
Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>. Hellas Verona's European 
bid was dented again as they lost 5-0 at Sampdoria.

Elsewhere Udinese beat Sassuolo 1-0 and Bologna won a relegation fight against 
Cagliari by the same score.

It was top against bottom in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> and 55 points separated 
Juventus and Catania going into the match. Tension was high from the start as 
the Juventus bus was pelted with objects on its way to the stadium.

Juventus struggled but broke the deadlock shortly before the hour. Dani 
Osvaldo nodded back a long ball from Andrea Pirlo for Tevez to race forward and 
fire home an angled drive for his 16th goal of the season. Catania had been 
playing well but any chance of getting back into the match evaporated when 
Bergessio was shown a second yellow card for an elbow on Giorgio Chiellini.

Both Napoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> and Fiorentina were 
in need of a confidence boost after crashing out of the Europa League in 
midweek.

Fiorentina's goalkeeper, Neto, pulled off a number of fine saves before Faouzi 
Ghoulam's sending-off in the 37th minute. Ghoulam brought down Marko Bakic on 
the edge of the area and was promptly dismissed for denying a clear goalscoring 
opportunity, although replays appeared to show the Algeria defender had played 
the ball.

Napoli continued to test Neto and appeared to have secured a point but 
Alessandro Matri drew Pepe Reina and cut it back for Manuel Pasqual to cross to 
the far post where Joaquin headed home two minutes from time. Fiorentina moved 
seven points behind third-place Napoli.

There was also a late goal in Milan, where Giacomo Bonaventura scored the 
winner 10 seconds from time as he was left unmarked at the far post to head a 
free-kick between Samir Handanovic's legs. Bonaventura had givenAtalanta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atalanta> the lead in the 35th minute 
when Maxi Moralez rolled the ball across for him to finish off a rapid 
counterattack.

But Inter were immediately level when Mauro Icardi latched on to Fredy 
Guarín's through-ball and cut across Mario Yepes before firing into the bottom 
left corner. To celebrate he held up a T-shirt dedicated to his girlfriend 
Wanda Nera, the ex-wife of his former Sampdoria team-mate Maxi López.

Inter should have sealed the match in the second half but Guarín smashed a 
shot off the crossbar and Rodrigo Palacio sent a glancing header on to the left 
upright.

Both sides could have snatched the win. Inter's Jonathan cleared off his own 
line three minutes from time before chipping the ball off the underside of the 
crossbar at the other end. Atalanta also hit the woodwork in the first half, 
when Germán Denis headed Bonaventura's cross off the crossbar.

Parma maintained their charge towards a European spot by extending their 
club-record unbeaten run to 17 matches.

Milan's coach, Clarence Seedorf, was under pressure with seven defeats in his 
12 matches in charge. His side took the lead when Abdoulay Konko deflected 
Kaká's shot into his own net. However, Álvaro González headed in the equaliser 
on the hour and the substitute Mario Balotelli was unlucky as his effort hit 
the right post eight minutes from time.

Udinese's captain, Antonio Di Natale, scored his 10th goal of the season to 
ensure he reached double figures in goals for the eighth consecutive season. It 
was a good way to mark his 324th league appearance for Udinese – a club record.

Di Natale could have had a second but kicked up a chunk of turf as he 
ballooned a penalty over the bar. Sassuolo also missed a penalty.
