A game in the Turkish league between Trabzonspor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/trabzonspor> and Fenerbahce was abandoned 
after an assistant referee was assaulted.

Trabzonspor were 4-0 down at home when the incident took place and their fans 
had been throwing projectiles on to the field. Then one fan jumped on to the 
pitch and pushed the official, Volkan Bayarslan, to the ground. He then punched 
Bayarslan while he was on the ground.

The game was immediately called off with both sets of players and officials 
running off the field.

Fenerbahce are likely to be awarded a win for the game meaning the points 
difference between themselves and Besiktas, the Super Lig leaders, will be 
reduced to three with four weeks to go.
