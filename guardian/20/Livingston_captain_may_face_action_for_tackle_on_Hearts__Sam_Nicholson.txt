The Livingston <https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston> captain, 
Jason Talbot, may face action from the Scottish Football Association over the 
tackle that left Hearts’ Sam Nicholson needing stitches to his face.

Talbot received a yellow card for his high tackle that ended Nicholson’s 
participation in the match and left him requiring extensive treatment.

The Hearts head coach, Robbie Neilson, was angry with the incident and that 
Talbot was not sent off by the referee Brian Colvin and according toBBC Scotland
 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31294574>, the SFA’s compliance officer 
intends to speak to the official and may seek to issue retrospective punishment.

After Saturday’s match, which Hearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> won 3-2, Neilson said: “Sam is 
going to be OK but he has three or four puncture marks on his face. It wasn’t a 
great tackle and I’ve let the referee know my views.”
