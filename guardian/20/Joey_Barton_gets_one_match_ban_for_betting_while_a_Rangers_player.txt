Joey Barton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/joey-barton> has been handed 
a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association betting rules.

The former Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> midfielder 
admitted breaching the SFA’s zero-tolerance rules, which forbid players 
gambling on any match.

The 34-year-old - whose Rangers contract was terminated last week - placed 44 
bets on games between July 1, when his Ibrox deal started, until 15 September. 
His suspension will be carried over if and when he signs for a new club in 
January.
