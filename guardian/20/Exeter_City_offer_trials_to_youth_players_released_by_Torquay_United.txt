Exeter City have offered all youth players released by Torquay United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torquay-united> the chance of a trial, 
after the Gulls announced they are to close their academy to cut costs.

Conference side Torquay confirmed last week that they will no longer run any 
youth teams for all ages below the under-18 bracket, meaning more than 120 
young players from the south-west will have less chance of earning a 
professional deal one day.

However, the League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club Exeter have 
stepped in to offer them an opportunity to impress their academy scouts, and 
the Grecians will also try to help the coaches of former Torquay academy teams 
find new employment.

The Exeter academy manager Simon Hayward said: “We are pleased that we are 
able to offer each of the boys a trial and a chance to become part of the club, 
and hopefully help many of them achieve their dream of becoming a professional 
footballer.

“Sadly many of those invited for a trial will not be offered registrations – 
we just don’t have the space to take everyone – but we feel that every player 
in their situation deserves the opportunity.

“Similarly we will be speaking soon with coaches who have lost their jobs at 
Torquay to see whether there are opportunities within our set-up and we will 
help them in any way we can.”
