Thank you so much for all of your questions. I can honestly say that's the 
most fun I've ever had in the Guardian building. My DVD, What Do I Do Now? is 
out now, and will make an ideal Christmas present/drinks coaster.

Which do you prefer – writing your own stand-up routines or writing for your 
sitcom?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17102995> Guardian contributor 
JoshWiddicombe  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17102995> 06 December 
2016 2:01pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88929893> 
I find writing is the most fun I have in comedy. I think writing for the 
sitcom more fun, because I get to do it with someone else - my co-writer Tom 
Craine. However, writing a sitcom is far more time-consuming and far more 
difficult than I think anyone realises. Sitcom writing is difficult because 
it's not just about writing jokes - there's a very fine balance between 
characters, plot, and comedy, that if you get one thing wrong, the whole castle 
comes falling down. This wasn't the case when I was writing football quizzes 
for the Guardian.

I stand by it. Correct me if I'm wrong... didn't Barry used to do standup? So 
he'd definitely know what funny is.

Two questions: First, what is your favourite cheese? Second, are you a posh 
boy like Jack Whitehall or do you just have a posh name?

Favourite cheese: Emmental. Which would hint at me being a posh boy. However, 
sorry to disappoint you, but I went to a comprehensive school (admittedly quite 
a nice one in the middle of Dartmoor). So I'm not very posh. Not that there's 
anything wrong with that – I think Jack Whitehall is brilliant, and one of my 
current tour supports, Ivo Graham, went to both Eton and Oxford. Yet somehow is 
still a nice guy.

Brexit and the US election recently?

I think back to earlier series of Last Leg and the long speeches against the 
inequality, minority bashing, and hypocrisy of the Tories and UKIP …

Speaking personally, I have never really given any strong political views on 
television, be it Last Leg or Celebrity Pointless. I see myself primarily as a 
comedian, and my aim on the Last Leg is to be as funny as I can about the news. 
But I think Adam has been opinionated on Brexit and Donald Trump, the two big 
stories of the year, and I don't think anyone would question what his views 
are, and that is what Adam is brilliant at.

I have never bought into this view that some people have that the job of the 
comedian is to espouse opinions and change the world - I think the job of a 
comedian is to be funny. If they want to offer opinions and talk about 
politics, that is great, but I never set out to do that, and I am fully aware 
there are people far more informed and politically intelligent than me. So I'll 
stick to what I'm good at.

It's neither, really. I'm not walking down the street hoping that people spot 
me, but I'm certainly not complaining if people come up to me. Because it's 
part of the job I have which allows me to do my comedy around the country and 
on TV. However, there was one person in Frome did make me question if this was 
the career I wanted.

Hi Josh. 

A few years ago you played the Cheese and Grain in Frome. I didn’t go, but our 
paths crossed in the Co-op that starry night. I walked in and saw you browsing 
the chocolate aisle. Didn’t realise it was you at first, you didn’t realise it 
was me either. Our eyes met, there was a fleeting of recognition, you saw me 
and I saw you, it was magical. I held a loaf of bread and lifted it in your 
direction as an acknowledgement and then you appeared to just run out of the 
shop like a shop lifter.

I always imagine with fondness that you went back into your gig and told the 
story of the time you had to run for your life from a goggled eyed local, with 
a toothy smile, who showed you his loaf. Ah happy times.

See you soon. 

PS. I’ve still kept that loaf …

Putting aside all the obvious hits they would have to play, if contractually 
obliged when I booked them for my garden party, I would insist on the following 
songs: Sing, Miss America, Trouble in the Message Centre, One Born Every 
Minute, Swallows in the Heatwave, You're So Great, and Trimm Trabb. NB My 
garden isn't even big enough to fit Blur in.

Is the panel show dead?

Despite the annual blog on the Guardian claiming this, the panel show seems to 
be going very well. There are loads of successful panel shows on TV, and while 
they maybe aren't getting the viewers they got five years ago, neither is any 
other TV show, because people are watching less TV and have a wider range of 
channels. The news is getting less viewers than it once did, but I'm pretty 
sure that'll continue as a genre. A lot of people found panel shows too 
competitive and blokey, and I genuinely think in the last few years, the tone 
of panel shows and the ones that have launched have been a lot more discursive 
and friendly, and I think that can only be good for the genre. But then I would 
say that - I'm on every bloody one of them.

Because I spent some very boring teenage years there. Everyone has the right 
to slag off where you come from in the same way that only you have the right to 
slag off your own family. If anyone else slags off Devon, I get very prickly 
about it. But come on - what a boring place to grow up. At my primary school, 
there were four people in my year. The case rests.

Thank you so much for all of your questions. I can honestly say that's the 
most fun I've ever had in the Guardian building. My DVD, What Do I Do Now? is 
out now, and will make an ideal Christmas present/drinks coaster.

Which do you prefer – writing your own stand-up routines or writing for your 
sitcom?

I find writing is the most fun I have in comedy. I think writing for the 
sitcom more fun, because I get to do it with someone else - my co-writer Tom 
Craine. However, writing a sitcom is far more time-consuming and far more 
difficult than I think anyone realises. Sitcom writing is difficult because 
it's not just about writing jokes - there's a very fine balance between 
characters, plot, and comedy, that if you get one thing wrong, the whole castle 
comes falling down. This wasn't the case when I was writing football quizzes 
for the Guardian.

I stand by it. Correct me if I'm wrong... didn't Barry used to do standup? So 
he'd definitely know what funny is.

I think that they think my life is very different to what it is. The most 
attention I've had was in a supermarket in Frome.

Two questions: First, what is your favourite cheese? Second, are you a posh

Favourite cheese: Emmental. Which would hint at me being a posh boy. However, 
sorry to disappoint you, but I went to a comprehensive school (admittedly quite 
a nice one in the middle of Dartmoor). So I'm not very posh. Not that there's 
anything wrong with that – I think Jack Whitehall is brilliant, and one of my 
current tour supports, Ivo Graham, went to both Eton and Oxford. Yet somehow is 
still a nice guy.

Have you been attempting to be more neutral for UK political issues like 
Brexit and the US election recently?

I think back to earlier series of Last Leg and the long speeches against the 
inequality, minority bashing, and hypocrisy of the Tories and UKIP …

Speaking personally, I have never really given any strong political views on 
television, be it Last Leg or Celebrity Pointless. I see myself primarily as a 
comedian, and my aim on the Last Leg is to be as funny as I can about the news. 
But I think Adam has been opinionated on Brexit and Donald Trump, the two big 
stories of the year, and I don't think anyone would question what his views 
are, and that is what Adam is brilliant at.

I have never bought into this view that some people have that the job of the 
comedian is to espouse opinions and change the world - I think the job of a 
comedian is to be funny. If they want to offer opinions and talk about 
politics, that is great, but I never set out to do that, and I am fully aware 
there are people far more informed and politically intelligent than me. So I'll 
stick to what I'm good at.

It's neither, really. I'm not walking down the street hoping that people spot 
me, but I'm certainly not complaining if people come up to me. Because it's 
part of the job I have which allows me to do my comedy around the country and 
on TV. However, there was one person in Frome did make me question if this was 
the career I wanted.

Hi Josh. 

A few years ago you played the Cheese and Grain in Frome. I didn’t go, but our 
paths crossed in the Co-op that starry night. I walked in and saw you browsing 
the chocolate aisle. Didn’t realise it was you at first, you didn’t realise it 
was me either. Our eyes met, there was a fleeting of recognition, you saw me 
and I saw you, it was magical. I held a loaf of bread and lifted it in your 
direction as an acknowledgement and then you appeared to just run out of the 
shop like a shop lifter.

I always imagine with fondness that you went back into your gig and told the 
story of the time you had to run for your life from a goggled eyed local, with 
a toothy smile, who showed you his loaf. Ah happy times.

See you soon. 

PS. I’ve still kept that loaf …

I think this speaks for itself. Was it wholegrain?

Putting aside all the obvious hits they would have to play, if contractually 
obliged when I booked them for my garden party, I would insist on the following 
songs: Sing, Miss America, Trouble in the Message Centre, One Born Every 
Minute, Swallows in the Heatwave, You're So Great, and Trimm Trabb. NB My 
garden isn't even big enough to fit Blur in.

Is the panel show dead?

Despite the annual blog on the Guardian claiming this, the panel show seems to 
be going very well. There are loads of successful panel shows on TV, and while 
they maybe aren't getting the viewers they got five years ago, neither is any 
other TV show, because people are watching less TV and have a wider range of 
channels. The news is getting less viewers than it once did, but I'm pretty 
sure that'll continue as a genre. A lot of people found panel shows too 
competitive and blokey, and I genuinely think in the last few years, the tone 
of panel shows and the ones that have launched have been a lot more discursive 
and friendly, and I think that can only be good for the genre. But then I would 
say that - I'm on every bloody one of them.

Why do you take the piss out of Devon when it’s a wonderful place to live?

Because I spent some very boring teenage years there. Everyone has the right 
to slag off where you come from in the same way that only you have the right to 
slag off your own family. If anyone else slags off Devon, I get very prickly 
about it. But come on - what a boring place to grow up. At my primary school, 
there were four people in my year. The case rests.
