The German football federation will consult with Fifa as it investigates Bayer 
Leverkusen's 2-1 win over Hoffenheim. Hoffenheim lodged an appeal against 
Friday'sBundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> 
result after losing the game to Stefan Kiessling's headed "goal", which was 
awarded despite clearly missing the target. The ball hit the outside of the net 
and rolled into the goal through a hole in the netting.

"I didn't really see it, I turned away but I was surprised to see the ball in. 
I didn't know how it got in," Kiessling said. The DFB said in a statement on 
Saturday that it will consult both teams, the referee, its control committee 
and football's governing body Fifa "to clarify the legal position for such 
cases internationally".

Hoffenheim wants a replay, as happened when Bayern Munich scored a phantom 
winner against Nürnberg, in 1994.
