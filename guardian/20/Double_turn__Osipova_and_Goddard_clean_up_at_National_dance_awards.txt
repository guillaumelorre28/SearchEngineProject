It was a bit of a surprise that a list of winners culled from almost 400 
nominations – and from the votes of 60 critics – could end up with as many 
overlaps and duplications as those at the National dance awards. But there were 
some stonkingly good performances on the UK dance stage last year that deserved 
recognition. Few who saw Natalia Osipova’s shockingly reimaginedGiselle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/19/royal-ballet-giselle-review> or 
Jonathan Goddard’s juggernaut of aDracula 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/17/mark-bruce-company-dracula-review>
 would quarrel with them getting outstanding dancer awards for those roles. And 
given the standard of their dancing in other productions last year, it’s not 
such a stretch to award them prizes in the best dancer category, either. It’s 
the first time in the history of these awards that two dancers have won both 
categories in a single year.

Other benchmarks were also set. Akram Khan’s war-themed Dust won him his sixth 
NDA in the best modern choreography category. This powerful work was a tricky 
one to categorise. It was commissioned by English National Ballet for itsLest 
We Forget programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/11/tamara-rojo-english-national-ballet-first-world-war>
 on the first world war, yet Khan took no prisoners with the very contemporary, 
earthed intensity of its style. And it was certainly the boldness of this 
collaboration that took ENB towards their own outstanding company award.

Another repeat winner this year is Christopher Wheeldon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/may/04/christopher-wheeldon-interview>, 
picking up his fifth award for best classical choreography. His adaptation of 
Shakespeare’sThe Winter’s Tale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/royal-ballet-winters-tale-review-christopher-wheeldon>
 is a well-deserved winner, but it was good to see he had tough competition 
compared to some of the more lacklustre shortlists of previous years.

A new category to recognise emerging talent was introduced, and a wide variety 
of names were put forward, including choreographers James Cousins and Drew 
McOnie. In the end, the award went toRoyal Ballet dancer Francesca Hayward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/19/francesca-hayward-next-great-ballerina>
, whose talent in ballets such as Rhapsody and Manon has seemed less to emerge 
than to burst, fully-formed, onstage.

A popular winner this year was Wendy Houstoun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/26/wendy-houstoun-interview-dance-flame-nigel-charnock-pact>
, who picked up outstanding female performance for her solo showPact With 
Pointlessness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/09/wendy-houstoun-pact-with-pointlessness-purcell-room-review>
. Houstoun is a brilliant, singular voice in the dance world, and her riffs on 
death, ageing, love, language and the meaning of life have become sharper, 
funnier and more necessary the older she gets.
