The funniest standup I’ve ever seen 

There’s a great video that no longer exists of a guy called Nick Sun trying to 
perform to an empty dancefloor at two in the morning a festival where 
everyone’s completely high and wants him to leave. He abandons his material 
straight away and refuses to go off until he gets a standing ovation.

The funniest person I know 

The guy who beat me to “funniest person” in our uni yearbook, Jordan Perry. He 
now works at the Foreign Office and I don’t hold grudges.

Probably the one from Not The Nine O’Clock News where Rowan Atkinson keeps 
putting more and more toilets in the model bathroom. I’ve never seen anything 
else like it.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

When Gordon Brown <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown> called 
Gillian Duffy a “bigoted woman”.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard

When my dad tried to tell the panda eats, shoots and leaves joke, and said the 
punchline as eats, shoots and goes.


The funniest word

“Egregious”, but only in that League Of Gentlemen sketch.


The funniest book I’ve ever read

I suspect this makes me sound a total prune but I really did find Don Quixote 
incredibly funny.


The funniest film I’ve ever seen

Anchorman, on condition that it has to be Anchorman the first time I watched 
it.

The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten 

It’s more just sad but when I was 17 I decided to liven up a lasagne by 
putting bananas in it. I forced myself to eat it all so mum and dad wouldn’t 
come home and ask me what on earth I was thinking.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had

In school I found my “thing” when I started washing my hair just before going 
to bed, which made it form a sort of wave shape the following day. Take note, 
anxious teens!

The funniest number

Eight – and large numbers beginning therewith.
