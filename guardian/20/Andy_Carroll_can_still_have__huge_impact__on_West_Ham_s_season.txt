The West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, has confirmed Andy Carroll is facing up to 
six weeks out

 with his latest injury setback.

The striker suffered a hamstring problem just 12 minutes into Tuesday night’s 
3-1 win at Bournemouth

 and Bilic admits the 27-year-old is “gutted” at facing yet another spell on 
the sidelines.

“He’s having a scan but it’s another one of those, four to six weeks,” said 
Bilic. “He’s a positive lad, but of course he is gutted for several reasons. He 
felt he was back and enjoying his football.

“It’s not the end of the world, though. If everything goes well he will be 
back very soon so there is no reason to be negative.

“If it goes as we expect then he will be back for a significant part of the 
season, the last 10 to 15 games, with enough time to make a huge impact on our 
season.”

Carroll has been beset by injuries since moving to Upton Park, making just 31 
starts in three years following his club-record £18m switch from Liverpool.

He returned to action in September following a long-term ankle injury and then 
had a spell out before Christmas with a groin strain.

However, Carroll has scored twice in his last four appearances, helping the 
Hammers to victories over Southampton and Liverpool, so his latest absence is 
another blow especially as his fellow striker Diafra Sakho is still missing 
with a thigh problem.

Bilic does, though, have some positive fitness news with the winger Victor 
Moses available to face Newcastle on Saturday after six weeks out with a 
hamstring injury.

The midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté and forward Mauro Zárate are also fit after 
missing the Bournemouth game.
